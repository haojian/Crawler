Been going here for years and Philippe's is known to be a local game day spot when the Dodgers are at home so it can get crowded especially before and after game time. 蔛topped in yesterday before UFC event at Staples and as usual never disappoints. 蔅eef dip (double dipped), potato salad, and lemonade; $9. �This place really is a L.A. landmark and if you ever find yourself at Union Station across the street or just within reach i would highly recommend! 蔖arking has improved just be careful to read all the signs since we did get towed once back in the day; YES it is that good that even a horrible experience like being towed for grabbin food before a Dodgers game cannot detour a beef dip craving.

Went to Phillipe's for the first time on a Saturday afternoon about 2pm. 蔠e were able to park in their lot across the street without any problem. 蔜he restaurant however, was PACKED. 蔠e waiting in line for 25-30 minutes to order our food. 蔠e were concerned that there would be no place to sit and eat because of how packed the restaurant was. We did have to hunt around for about 10 minutes and ended up sharing a 4 seat table with to ladies and that was ok. We ordered two beef french dips, a ham french dip (which we later discovered was actually LAMB), cole slaw, macaroni salad, pickles and banana cream pie. 蔠e wanted to try many different things since we had never been there. We were happy with the food, but honestly, it was just OK. 蔍 could get this same food in ANY deli and because its 30 minutes away, I wouldn't be clammering to go back any time soon because it just wasn't that special. �Just ok.

3.5 I love French dipped everything, but this place did not meet the expectations I had for it. I think in general, you can't mess up anything french dipped unless the meat sucked and the bread was stale or something. I guess I came here expecting for something way beyond average... and as I waited over an hour to get my beef doubled dipped sandwich ($6.50), my expectations grew and grew and grew. By the time my friends and I got our food, we went upstairs and found a party leaving so we swooped in and began our feast. (To note: there are a few rooms upstairs with park bench-like tables inside.) I took a bite and it was indeed... a great 蔲rench dipped sandwich. Then why a 3 star rating rather than a 4? Because I was disappointed that it wasn't significantly and strikingly better than I was expecting, but perhaps I was expecting too much? I wanted to be amazed, especially since Philippe's has been opened since 1908 and SPECIALIZES in the french dipped sandwiches. Also, their mustard tastes like horseradish sauce and I particularly don't like that taste. I squeezed some of the mustard onto my sandwich thinking it would taste like your standard American yellow mustard, but it tasted like horseradish and that made me spit out that first bite. That alone may have ruined it for me. Other meats that come with that sandwich include: pork ($6.50), ham ($6.50), lamb ($8.00), and turkey ($6.50). I tried the lamb french dipped sandwich as well and it was pretty good. Useful Tips: -Parking is a hassle... as it tends to be in LA. -Breakfast 6-10AM (corn beef hash!) -They serve wine & beer -Take-Out option -Lemonade is 79 cents! -CASH ONLY I would try this place again if my friends wanted to go or if I wanted a GOOD french dipped sandwich, but Philippe's is not a restaurant I'd rave and recommend to everyone. I'm not a fan... but I didn't say it wasn't good. You ought to try it for the experience and to see for yourself whether you would disagree by saying it's the best French dipped sandwich you ever tried!

I've been going here for years and found myself here in June while visiting. 蔕n this trip, I took the Pirate and my Mom, both whom have never been to Philippe's. 蔋ow is that possible I never shared this Los Angeles jewel with them? Philippe's has a million things to eat not just french dip sandwich's, but I always get the beef dip. 蔍 also ALWAYS get the sandwich double dip because they DO NOT serve the Au jus on the side. 蔜he sandwich is still plenty moist. 蔕n this trip I also ordered the potato salad and the cole slaw as sides with a slice of the coconut cream pie for a sweet treat. The potato salad has a sweet under tone and I prefer a savory one, but still is good. 蔜he cole slaw was finely chopped and like any ol' typical deli slaw. 蔠e've been spoiled by all the modern versions of slaw that I'd skip this choice next time. But WHAT is up with that coconut cream pie.???!!!!! 蔍t's simply magical in every way possible. 蔄 mile high, creamy , not too sweet, sinfully delicious yumminess...... Get it and don't look back. Now I the lines look long, but they do go quickly. They only except cash, but there is an ATM. The restaurant is oddly shaped so don't be upset if you do not see immediate seating, I've never been there and not gotten a seat. 蔜here are family style benches, have a seat meet some new people an ask them about their choices.... The saddest part about or trip occurred and 30 minutes after we had left down town for my Mom's house on the hill....she said 蕆eally wish I had bought another sandwich to take home....and a piece of that pie.... Oh Mom you should have said something.....darn it.

Double-dip beef sandwich with Swiss cheese, side of potato salad, pickle and a slice of boysenberry pie is the best way to start the weekend! Phillipes usually has a line, but it moves at a fairly decent rate, the decor is old L.A. From the pics on the walls to the uniforms the waitresses wear and the counter service. Sandwiches are around $6 each, lamb is $8. Ample parking, great food, try it if your in the area.

You know, I'm not a french dip sandwich connoisseur, but I wasn't expecting to think that there was room for improvement with my sandwich. I got the double dip and still found it to be bland...and for someone whose palate lands more often in bland territory, that's saying something. Maybe I should have asked for extra au jus on the side? Thankfully the beef was tender and juicy, just not terribly flavorful. I like the setup of the restaurant; it feels like a slice of history with its odd quirks and magazine-stand-looking station inside the restaurant, its cash-only policy and presumably odd parking (we were lucky enough to land a meter directly in front of the entrance that still had half an hour on it!!). But still...it was just okay for me.

I came here when I was a teenager and had my very first Beef Dip ever there! It made such a special memory and I don't think that I have ever 蔴ad such a tender or better one since. But, �you know as memories 蔳o, going back and expecting things 蕋o be as special as a memory that has had decades to grow into something even greater than it really was can be a big set up for disappointment. Well, I got a chance to relive my memories yesterday and was not disappointed. Everything was exactly the same as I remembered, right down to the jars of pickled hardboiled eggs on the 蔯ounters and the most tender Beef Dip I have ever had. The same saw dust was on the FLoor! Or so it seemed! The long tables and the tapioca and the fact that it was all exactly the same made it even more wonderful in a world where nothing stays the same. I guess when something doesn't need improving, don't mess with it! After 100 years in business, they keep doing it right. My only complaint would be about the luke warm water that they provide for you 蔠ITHOUT ice. I guess they really want you to order a drink!

This place is simple, old-fashioned goodness! My husband and I go out of our way to come here when we're in the Los Angeles area. The sandwiches are really good, the lemonade is tasty and cheap and their home made mustard is delicious but packs a punch! I've had the pork and the beef, I get it single dipped; of the two they are both awesome but I'd probably recommend the beef. One thing to be aware of: this place is always really busy, most of the time there's not an established line so it can be a little hectic.

2800 plus reviews a cultural landmark plus plenty of TV time, so what can I add to this. How about some tips. First off if you are from out of town try not to come during the week at lunch time. With that said if you happen to be in the area or lunch time is your only chance to visit you should do so. They have two parking lots one behind the restaurant another across the St. It's Cash only - ATM on site Feel free to ask the people making your sandwich questions When you pay put your money in the little tray they will provide for you If you like spice try some of the spicy mustard They have beer and wine The place is really big inside, plenty of seating for small or large groups (lunchtime not so much) Union station metro leaves you just a couple of blocks away

I loooooooooooove Philippe's french dip sandwiches. The only thing that really sucks about this place is when the lines are incredibly LONG. It IS worth the wait, however.

Thank goodness it was like 3pm and there was no line cause he told me it gets insane. 蔠e found parking right in front and he ordered for me since I had no idea what was going on. 2 beef sandwiches double dipped with swiss, 1 banana cream pie, 1 pumpkin pie, 2 lemonades, and 2 iced teas. What can I say? We do it big. Delicious. I'm not a fan of mustard but he said it's bomb and really spicy...so I'll take his word for it. Definitely a homey feel to it.

I made 2 mistakes at Philippe: 1. I thought sandwiches came with condiments and sides. Nope, a beef sandwich is literally just meat and bread. Make sure you get some toppings and side dishes (potato salad or coleslaw, perhaps) to bring out all the flavors of the sandwich. I think with some pickles and cheese or something, this would have been a tasty sandwich. 2. I ordered turkey. It gave off a little whiff of off poultry. Most people seem to get the beef or pork, and with good reason. Ah well. Now I know better.

I just went to Philippe for the fifth-or-so time in a period of about three or four years, and I must say, the Beef Dip never ceases to satisfy and thrill my taste buds. 蔍'm pretty sure I only get the Beef Dip sandwich every time--and it is delicious--but Philippe also has Ham, Pork, Lamb, and Turkey. 蔜he bread is dipped on the inside, so the flavor soaks into it nicely while preserving the hold of the bread's crust, so your hands don't get wet and messy. 蔈ach sandwich is filled with plenty of meat - not an obnoxious amount but a good enough amount that most will be satisfied. 蔜here are hot (spicy) mustard condiment bottles on each table which is a cheap but exciting thrill for newcomers and revisiting customers alike; the spiciness carries a shooting sensation similar to that of wasabi. 蔄t the end of the day, these are just sandwiches, but sometimes, the simple things do the job better. Aside from what makes Philippe famous, the french dip sandwiches, the menu is quite extensive, with Tapioca pudding, brownies, cookies, various pies which look incredible, coffee, tea, soda, breakfast foods, and just a bunch of other things. 蔜he seating is plenty but might feel limited during peak hours, because the place is absolutely packed (think waiting in long lines for food and finding it difficult to find a seat). 蔍 went yesterday around 4 p.m. and the lines were only five minutes long - that was great. There was an old man around his 60's bussing the tables, who gestured my date and me to sit together and hand him a camera so that he could take a picture of us for us; this was really strange, but I appreciate his intentions (note: he had as bright a smile as his decrepit cheek muscles would allow, and he also approached other tables similarly). 蔍'm not one to often take pictures, so because of this, I'll have one for once. Summary/TL; DR: 蔈veryone needs to try Philippe's French Dip sandwiches at least once. 蔜he parking is somewhat limited, but it usually only takes a few minutes to find a spot; because it's a sandwich place, the traffic is constantly flowing, and people are going in and out. 蔍t's a simple and exciting food adventure in a usually PACKED place; you'll be in line for roughly 10-20 (dpo busyness). 蔉inding seats for larger parties will be a problem during prime hours, but going in a small group of 2-3 is no problem.

Try the original french dip sandwich, but Do Not....I repeat DO NOT forget to add some of the spicy horseradish mustard. Ouch. It'll flush out your nasals and maybe put a tear in your eye if you put too much like I did. Feel the burn and enjoy every bite. 蔐ooks small in size, but it'll fill you up. The cole slaw! Man, I liked it. It's tough to find a good cole slaw. This one was just the right tangy, fresh and not over dressed at all. The potato salad was pretty good. Kind of mashed. Mushed. Tasty. I'd order it again. The macaroni salad meh. Kind of bleh. Too much mayo for me. The lemonade was okay. Before you go getting all nervous thinking there's nowhere to sit, un-bunch your panties cause there's plenty more seats upstairs. However, if you're afraid of mental institutions and wards you might want to stay downstairs. Has that kind of feel up there. Kind of weird. There's a large brick wall you can leave some personal graffiti on. Please no gum. That's just gross. Have you seen that huge, disgusting wall of gum in Seattle, WA? I have. Yeah, this is not that concept. Parking: in the private lot attached to the building or across street in their second private lot. Was fine for a Saturday at peak evening hour.

Ok this ways I have a couple things to say about this zombie land! Food- very good & well priced! But what an ODD experience. Everyone in there was moving in slow motion like zombies. (especially the staff) It was busy and you could hear a pin drop on the floor! I felt like i was in line at the dmv, since you stand in a line to order in complete silence. We also had the added bonus of meeting Fred- the man inside the dumpster that was next to our car!

I came here at night so fortunately I didn't have to wait long. The sandwich was very good, but I guess I was expecting something eye-opening due to all the hype surrounding this place. The criticism I have here, though, is the price; they're such a name that they can charge whatever they want and still be packed, and I just found them too expensive for a french dip. I don't regret stopping here for a bite, but I couldn't afford to be a regular.

I've been wanting to go here for a while b/c French Dips are my fav. sandwich. Today I was going out to LA to Amoeba Music 蔭nd figured I should stop by to try this place. It is raved as one of the city's staple restaurants and I have been dying to go here, so I did. My friend joined along and has been before so she knew the drill. According to my friend we were there on a "lucky day" because there was hardly anyone waiting in line. It only took a few minutes but in those few minutes to get our food but we did have to sort of elbow our way in to order. We both ordered beef dips, I got a double dip, shared macaroni salad, lemonade and Iced Tea, bag a chips each, and a brownie. The sandwich was really good and I definately want to try the other kinds (ham, pork). The Iced Tea was refreshing and the chips were just the indivual lays bags you can get at the store. The macaroni salad was really good and I would recommend it because I'm usually not a fan of mac salad. The brownie was SOOOO YUMMY! Definately recommend it. All in all; I enjoyed my meal, would go back, and recommend it.

I'm used to French dip sandwiches coming with a small cup of jus (beef juice), so when I was presented with an already soaked, though only slightly so, beef sandwich, I was a little disappointed. For $6.50, you get a lukewarm, rather average looking sandwich with an average amount of thinly sliced beef dipped in beef juices. I know, their sandwiches are 'huge' but for some reason I expected something so much more impressive. I shared with a friend, and even tried a little bit of their spicy mustard, which, I must say, burns with a horshradish with no other - Try it first before you drench your sandwiches in it! The meat... was dry. HOW it was dry, even after being dipped, I do not understand. *Service: Incredibly friendly and welcoming. They're so well done and dressed up! *Lines: They move pretty fast, but you have to make yourself noticed. *Parking: TWO parking lots, free parking whattup *Food: ...Mediocre.

A staple of Chinatown in L.A., Phillippe's is the quintessential inexpensive French dip of the city. 蔍've been coming here before Dodgers games for about 10 years now and have enjoyed every sandwich, coleslaw, lemonade and biscuit since. 蔍f it's your first time, get one of the sandwiches (Ham, Beef, Pork, Turkey or Lamb), a side order of coleslaw and a beer or fresh lemonade to wash it down. 蔄t the tables you will find a very spicy horseradish mustard (eater beware, it's pretty common to get the spicy sniffles if you're not careful). Even though there are 2 nearby parking lots (including one adjacent to the restaurant), it might be a 5-10 minute wait to snag a spot. 蔐ike I said earlier, this is a great place to hit up before or after a Dodger game if you're willing to wait in a line a few minutes. 蔍f you can't find a place to site downstairs, don't fret, there is seating on an upstairs level accesible by stairs.

My friend and I have been to Cole's and we finally made it back to Philippe's. After having Philippe's again it really sheds a light on just how BAD Cole's is. At Philippe's we found parking right away in a private lot FOR FREE, Cole's is Street parking. At Philippe's you get the ambiance of what a French Dip sandwich place should be and by ambiance I mean you have to wait in line, walk up to the counter & order your food, saw dust on the floor, Cole's is a side down restaurant with extremely slow service. At Philippe's you get a soggy French Dip sandwich that is just a bunch of goodness in your mouth, Cole's sandwich comes out looking like it was prepared for a sandwich presentation on a hard French roll. When I am in the mood for another French Dip sandwich I will come back to Philippe's and will probably never again go to Cole's. CASH ONLY.

Ah yes, one of my favorite little side-trips while I am in or around LA. Philippe has a famous dip sandwich. 蔍 believe they claim to be the first, but I am no historian. 蔠hat I can say is that they dip the entire sandwhich for you. 蔍t truly is delicious and definitely within the top 3 of dip sandwiches I have eaten. There are several different meats to try. 蔠hile I tend to gravitate toward the classic beef dip, many do prefer the lamb dip. Very casual. 蔛awdust on the floor, seat yourself. 蔊et in line to order. 蔜hey assemble and dip the sandwich right in front of you. 蔊o sit down and eat. The real kicker for me here is the location. 蔣ou are steps away from Chinatown and Olvera Street. 蔊reat place for a day trip. They open early at 6:00 a.m. and close kind of late at 10 p.m. which is pretty cool. My only complaint is that I'm not really into the sides. 蔜he sandwich is great and the only thing I will recommend. 蔋ence, 4 stars for the knock-out product.

Philippe is located a short walk from Chinatown, and you'll be lucky to find parking in the restaurant lot, so you might end up parking on the street unless you want to park at nearby parking lots for a fee of a few dollars. �The busboy service can be slow so finding clean tables to sit at after you order/pickup your food may be difficult, or it may also be due to Philippe being packed and busy. the routine of this place is, you lineup, order your food, you pay, they give it to you, you find a place to sit, and enjoy the french dip sandwiches are delicious, but not very filling in my opinion, so if you come in hungry, consider buying two sandwiches or buy their chili (also great) on the side, and the mustard for the sandwiches gives the sandwich a good kick (not normal mustard, similar to wasabi but milder, but worth a try on your sandwich!) i like the style of the restaurant, they kept the history of the place and haven't had to change much with the times, they have a snack stand with candies you'll find everyday and some that are hard to come by, I'll definitely go back when I get the chance or if i am in the area, and i intend to just indulge myself and put myself into a food coma the next time i go A historical landmark right next to chinatown that must be experienced at least once, so go, go to Philippe!!

Everyone should try the beef dip and I highly recommend using the hot mustard sparingly at first even if you like hot mustard, this one is exceptionally hot. I really like their chili as well. Every time I am there I see a ton of people with the pot roast, so my new goal is to order that one day, if I can ever refrain from getting a beef dip! I always make it a point to sample the deserts. I enjoy the custard, tapioca pudding and definitely the chocolate silk pie!

For first time visitors, make sure you figure out the line process. There are generally several lines of people, and the parties at the front of the line go to whichever nearest waitress is free. It can seem a little chaotic, especially when there's 100 people in line, but it somehow works out fine. And be sure to check out the Dodgers memorabilia case on the wall. Tommy Lasorda, Connie Mack autographs, and some neat old World Series tickets :) PS: the hot mustard is hot, but it's great. PPS: don't forget to bring cash, no credit or debit cards

Place is absolutely a bucket list place. Its a Los Angeles legend and even if you have to go out of your way to get here, just do it. The place has such a historic feel with its great sandwiches and great sides. The place reminds me of the DMV with the crowd of people in multiple lines. But instead of waiting to pay for terrible DMV fees you actually pay to get a killer sandwich. Watch out for that mustard and ease in to it cause it will kick you in the face. Also loved that they have Ranger IPA on tap, while not the best IPA out there it still goes great with a sandwich...pass me the mustard and my beer please. CHEERS

CASH ONLY. COME PREPARED. Now that we've got that covered, your dipped sandwich is as big as a hot dog bun, a little wider, but just to give you an idea of length because it's pretty small for just two or whatever toppings it comes with. The dip is good, not great. Like other Yelpers have mentioned..come in between lunch or dinner as the lines will get long, although, they have many registers open. The seating is weird as it's in between the lines and some in the back area. I suggest everyone trying it at least once to experience the ambience of the place. They're communal tables, the floors have shavings, the walls are filled with black and white photos. This place is more for a quick lunch and go, not really to stay for hours.

There's a lot of hype around this place, and I've been waiting to go for like 3 years. �Beef french dip is exactly as advertised: tender beef, good au ju on the bread that gives it a crunchy outside but softer inside. 蔜he .75 for cheese is maybe a little marked up when I think about it, but the swiss cheese element does add a little nutty and contrast to the beef. Pickles are delicious too. 蔍 have no problem with phallic shaped foods Doesn't exactly live up to it's amazing hype, but definitely is a good spot for french dipped sandwiches. 蔠ill be back

I went to a basketball game downtown today, and as I don't get downtown that often I had a trip planned for Langers Deli. Wouldn't you know closed for Memorial day. Oh well plan B was Phillipe. I'd never been here before, but had see it on TV somewhere and was game to give it a try. Came in early between the B-fast and lunch times plus it was a holiday so almost no wait hooray! Got me a beef double dipped, cup of chili and a iced tea to wash it down. Had my dip in hand in couple of min. and found a seat and with my first bite I knew I had me a winner. The sandwich could have used a little more meat on it but the taste was fantastic. The au jus added just the right flavor. Not too salty but very bold and beefy. The bread holds up well to the dip and does not get completely soggy like others I've had. I added the hot mustard half way through after noticing another customer using it. It completed a great sammy with a nice horseradish kick. The chili was a decent surprise too, meaty and flavorful. It was not really spicy like I prefer chili, but a little more as they call it straight chili. 蔍t would have been better if it had some fresh chopped onions and cheese on it, but it was tasty just by itself. Tasted kind of like the stuff my grandma used to make when I was a kid. The food here is good on its own merits. Great French dip! Good chili too. Priced good! Cash only. I'll be back to Philippe again for sure.

After coming here for a few times it's time to write a review. My friends see this place on MVF and they wanna come bc they make it look so damn good on the show. Unfortunately they almost always have the same reaction after the first bite which is slight disappointment. �I've tried the lamb, pork and beef and I think the lamb is the best but most expensive at $8.50. �The meat is cut thicker and its more flavorful. The pork and beef are sliced thinly but are both dry and that hasnt changed since the first time I've come. �Make sure to ask to double dip the sandwich or else it will be dry on dry. The lines here are pretty long esp on weekends so come on a weekday if you can. 蔜he sandwiches are pricey for the size and are $6.50 and $8.00 for the lamb. 蔜he price knocks the rating down from 3 to 2. I'll come here if people want to but I wouldn't request to come here.

I wanted to try this place for the longest time and came here a couple weeks ago with a coworker after shopping at Fashion District. It was about 1pm, but every line was packed. I swear, it'll take me a couple times before I get used to the system of this place. We both had the beef sandwiches double-dipped with provolone and shared the potato and macaroni salad. We were eyeing the banana cream pies, because they were massive slices but decided that we had enough food. The bread was perfect with that flakey outermost layer but despite being double dipped, my sandwich was still a bit dry. I was told that it depends on who's dipping the sandwiches and if you're lucky. I prefer my cheese melted on sandwiches but I appreciated the provolone nonetheless. The macaroni salad was mehs- little bite-size pieces of macaroni. The potato salad was what really won me over (in terms of potato salad contests, that is). I haven't had such a delicious and old-school style potato salad since fifth grade when my history teacher made it for a potluck we had for class using his mom's recipe passed down from generations. The place was rich in history, but not my preferred setting. I don't care too much, but it's a bit awkward when other people are waiting for food and staring at you eat. I want to give this place a 3.5 if possible. Prices are not bad, but I'm still a bit peeved about my sandwich. I'd come back again for their potato salad though!

I'm a big fan of french dips and supposedly this is the best?! It may be the first, but it's not the best. I feel like I'm in jail here-- waiting in long lines for food, eating off recycled grey paper plates, getting water from a sink, going through hall ways and having to sit at these elementary cafeteria tables, which is not a very fun environment to have lunch. I got the lamb which cost me $7.50 with nothing else. Extra side of chips & macaroni salad is $1.25 each. I've tried the beef double dipped $6 as well and it was little to none flavor. If it weren't for the double dipped, there would be ABSOLUTELY no taste at all. Don't waste your money here! Go to Arby's instead. It's half the price and you get curly fries and a drink! MVF, you failed me.

I finally made it to Philippe to try the beef dip. 蔍 had already tried the beef dip at Cole's. I do not believe I have a preference for either location's beef dip. 蔜hey are both good. 蔅oth have tender tasty beef, and a good au jus. I tried the potato salad as my side. 蔍t was pretty good. 蔜he cole slaw is also good. I am not a fan of the cafeteria style of Philippe. 蔍 also do not like that they only take cash. If I get a craving for a beef dip I will go to Cole's. 蔜hey have fries, a better setting, and a full bar. 蔍 will still eat at Philippe if someone else so desires.

First of all, the single star is ONLY for the recent price increase of the Lamb Sandwich. Food is great, however, I went last Saturday and discovered my favorite sandwich's price was jacked up to $8.00. This is ridiculous!!!! The size of the meal is the same yet the price goes up? Not happy at all! Hate to say it, but looks like Cole's will be getting my business!

French dip, as you should know by now, is the joint. But what I really fiend for at Philippes is their potato salad. Its one of those things that most places just don't get right, but here its effin' perfect. I throw in some spicy mustard for an extra kick. I'd make the trip down there just for that. Also, their chili with a bag of Fritos mixed in. That's my ish right there.

My favorite restaurant of all time for several reasons. 1) Nostalgia. My father used to take me after the Shrine Expo Comic Book/Sci-Fi conventions of my youth. He'd give me a quarter and I'd go into the press style phone booths and call the only person I knew the number for, my grandmother. 2) It's a good place to eat with a group or eat all by yourself. This makes it an ideal place for any situation. �) Their french dip roast beef and potato salad is the apex of idea of french dip and potato salad. One summer, I tried to order the other meats and sides. I gave up after the third try because I WAS MISSING THE BEST MEAL OF ALL TIME. 4) A great selections of deserts. They serve regular soda and chips but I don't know why, you should be trying their homemade sides and lemonade. There is a great Mexican food stand on Olvera Street just a few blocks away, but I never eat there because of how close it is to Philippe's. Once it was closed by the board of health for a small cockroach infestation, and that's the only time I had the delicious taquitos at the Mexican place. But they opened up a few hours later, and I was right back in the game, much like everyone else who didn't care about the pest problem. I wish they were open til' 2am. I'd go now.

I love this place. It's very simple and to the point. You order a sandwich with or without cheese, your choice of sauce, and level of dippage. I got turkey with swiss WET, and it was one of the best things I've tried since I've been in LA. My friend got the roast beef (no cheese) dipped once, which was also great. What I love about adding the cheese is that they dip it after making the sandwich, so the cheese is thoroughly melted. It's INEXPENSIVE and they have BEER for $2! You cant go wrong. Short walk from union station and close to the Dodger's stadium. The inside of the restaurant is old-timey and reminds me a bit of a barn, but don't let this discourage you. Cash only, but there's an ATM inside. It's a great place for a quick bite, you won't regret it.

Stopped by during the lunch rush on a Sunday. Parking is bad, then again it's LA so it's expected. It's a large restaurant with plenty of seating. The line moved fast considering how busy it was. We tried the double dipped beef sandwich, side of macaroni salad, two lemonades, a bottle water, mixed green salad and coconut cream pie...total came to $23. The food was ok, so glad we did not go out of the way to get here. Maybe a little on the pricey side for what it is but glad we were able to experience the original

Eaters rejoice! Philippe's hardly needs my review but I'll give my .02 anyway. �) We've always heard of Philippe's and how awesome the sandwiches are, but we never figured to make the two hour drive from San Diego just for a taste of history. 蔒y sister and brother-in-law finally checked it out and they came back raving about how good it was. Being a Yelper, I take personal recommendations very seriously. 蔍 sold the idea to my two hungriest friends and set a date with glory, or infamy, depending on which side you were on. We arrived at the lunch hour, circled for parking a few times before karma kicked in. 蔜he lines were nearly out the door and our hunger deepened with every shuffle forward. 蔜hirty minutes later we were seconds from the counter, the urgency of ordering struck us all into panic mode. 蔔ot wanting to wait in line again, we all decided on making a larger than normal order. You know, just to be sure we gave an honest accounting of the menu. 蔕ne of each, please! �$30 later and shameful tray loaded with lunch for three, we made my way to the tables. �All the sandwiches were awesomely delicious. 蔍 liked the turkey and pork the best. 蔜he beef had that rainbow sheen on it; luckily it didn't make me sick. �Against my better judgment, I got them all single dipped. 蔔ext time I'd definitely do double, if not completely drenched. 蔜he dry crusty bread really soaks up the Au Jus and that's really where the flavor comes from. 蔜he side dishes were nothing special and nothing I would order again. 蔄fter all, the real reason to come here is for the sandwiches. Sharing tables with complete strangers was great. 蔈veryone was super friendly (and hungry). 蔆onversation was light, mouths were full, and the only reason to communicate was to get them to pass the spicy mustard. 蔍t was delicious! It tasted like a mix of spicy Asian mustard and horseradish. 蔍 would have bought some to go, but that line was long too. Worth the two hour drive? 蔣es, especially if you're craving a piece of French Dip history.

Today was the first time I had tried Philippe after a friend suggested it. 蔒aybe my expectations were high because it has a 蕆eputation as a top food spot in Los Angeles 蔍 have to say I was disappointed with the place.First of all the place only takes cash. There is an ATM in the restaurant but you will get a $2.00 charge to take out cash. 蔜he lines were not long when I was there but the chaos of ordering can be annoying. There is no standard line to order, you just have to walk up to an available waitress behind the counter and get her attention. The food was pricey for a small sandwich roll will very little meat. The sandwich is very simple, a roll dipped in au jus with a few layers of thinly cooked meat. There is no soda fountain and no free refills on drinks. The sandwich itself 蔵s very average tasting. It reminded me of something that you throw together with leftovers after a prime roast dinner. I would say that if it were around the $3.00 range it would be better represented. I tried both the pork and beef dipped sandwich and was equally disappointed. The food was average, the service reminded me of a high school cafeteria, and the price was too high. Not to mention the location is in a very rundown area. When leaving the restaurant I was thrown gang signs from a moron with his face covered in tattoos. If you are in Los Angeles looking for a dive spot to eat I would suggest Jerry's Famous Deli. Pinks, or Tommy's burger.

This place is a classic. 蔍've been going here, not often enough, for a long time. 蔖hilippe just never seems to change much and is consistently good. As others have said, sandwiches aren't huge. 蔄 sandwich alone wouldn't satisfy most appetites. 蔒y favorites are the beef, lamb, and pork, not necessarily in that order - double dipped. The side orders are good and fill in the gaps. 蔍 especially like the cole slaw. 蔍n general I don't like sweet cole slaw and this is sweet but well balanced. 蔍t is rough enough to know a human made it, and It was crisp and fresh. 蔙eally yummie. 蔛o are the other sides. Desserts look good too. 蔜he custard and tapioca pudding were yummy. After all these years there are still a few things about Philippes that are mysteries to me: 蕋he upstairs dining room (haven't seen it yet) and the chili and the beef stew. One of the things I really like is their discipline in handling money. 蔄lthough the ladies who make the sandwiches take your money and return change, they never touch it. 蔜hey only touch the tray. Suggestion to first timers: 蔛tand around for a bit and watch the process. 蔍t is a bit intimidating and confusing. 蔅ut once you know what is happening it is a lot less frustrating! 蔆ash only. 蔇on't expect the nice ladies to be gushingly sweet or exceedingly patient -- they are nice but alsways want to be fast and efficient.

Must Order: Pork Dip, Beef Dip and Banana Cream Pie I don't live in California but I visit the OC fairly often and fly into LAX. Well on this trip, I was starving. Airlines don't serve food on planes anymore and on a 5 hour morning flight, I get HUNGRY. Thankfully, we all agreed on going to Philippe's. My BF was in charge of ordering for the 4 of us. I can usually trust him to go all out and over order which is perfectly fine with me. Hey, when I'm on vacation, I'm eating anything and everything I can because I won't be able to have it any time soon! Anywho, to the food. We had (2) Beef Dips, (2) Lamb Dips, (1) Pork Dip, (1) Ham Dip, (1) Lemon Meringue Pie, (1) Banana Cream Pie, pickled egg, coleslaw and potato salad and lemonade. Pork Dip [5 Tummy Rubs]: I'm starting with this one first because it was a HUGE mistake to only order (1) of these. And I thought I could trust my BF to order properly... sheesh. The pork is delicious, tender and juicy. There's a great flavor to it that almost, just almost, reminds me of Chinese Roast Pork but this is pulled pork. It was SO delicious that we were tempted to get back in line and order another sandwich. For me this ranked #1 of the sandwiches. Beef Dip [4 Tummy Rubs]: This was my #2. There's nothing like a classic beef dip tender and lovingly dipped in au jus deliciousness. I loved the flavor, it wasn't in your face but it was so good and even comforting. Lamb Dip [3 Tummy Rubs]: This was my #3. The lamb was tender and tasted good but when you've got pork and beef dip as options, I have to say that those will win over lamb in my eyes. The lamb had only a slight gamey taste to it but I happen to LOVE lamb ribs and lamb chops so this wasn't a concern to me. Ham Dip [2Tummy Rubs]: Not my favorite. If you like sliced home cooked ham this is a good sandwich, but if you're looking for a good porking, I'd go with the pork dip. Lemon Meringue Pie [3 Tummy Rubs]: My BF raved about this from the last time he went so of course we got one. I liked it but I've had better. Banana Cream Pie [5 Tummy Rubs]: This was the surprise hit. It was SOOOO good. Probably one of the best banana cream pies I've had! There is a whole banana in it and there's a slight almondy flavor to the pie which was yummy. In the end we all were fighting over the last bites. Pickled Egg [2 Tummy Rubs]: This was definitely interesting. It comes out to you bright purple. If you like pickled food this one be a good one to try. Coleslaw & potato salad [No Tummy Rubs]: I can't comment on these because I don't eat anything with mayo in it. But the boys ended up putting the coleslaw in their ham sandwiches and said it made it significantly better. Lemonade [4 Tummy Rubs]: This tasted yummy and refreshing. It wasn't overly sweet or overly tart. It was just right and a nice compliment to all the sandwiches I was eating! Overall, it's worth the stop especially if you're being picked up or picking someone up from LAX. It wasn't that much of a drive from LAX and the sandwiches make your empty tummy feel better. Expect lines and it's CASH ONLY. Go with a group so you can try different sandwiches.

Everyone says, "Poe, oh, Poe dear, you simply must go!" Why? So I can wait in line forever to get a small, dry sandwich that I paid too much for? I went once. It's a place you have to go once to say you went so you can tell everyone to pipe down. It's a place you go to once so you can tell your idiot friend that you really don't want to go to ever again even though, "Bro, this is a historical fucking sandwich, bro.

Quick warnings: CASH ONLY and can get very BUSY before games due to the proximity of Dodger's stadium. You've been warned! I was heading to an early movie showing at LA Live downtown so I stopped at Phillippe. Parking can suck in the area but it is nice that they have a good-sized wraparound parking lot where I was fortunate and got a spot. We stepped inside and this place was packed. The lines seemed long, but they actually move decent. (Better than Pinks! Boooo Pinks!). I ordred the beef dip sandwich with a side of macaroni salad, cup of soup special (chicken tortilla), and an ice tea. $0.65 for ice-tea and $0.75 for lemonade (very cool!). �The sandwich was pretty dry for a dipped sandwich, but the beef quality was good and not fatty. The bread was a tad bit stale, but it works ok on a dipped sandwich. The macaroni salad was very good. I really like the relish they add to the macaroni! The soup wasn't very hot, luke warm at best. The flavor was pretty bland as well, but I have had worse. Looking forward to maybe another trip back, just not soon. Docking stars for the CASH only and food being a little off - c'mon just pay your taxes like the rest of us, this isn't the 1800's. You can install credit card machines no problem.

I have been meaning to review this place for a while. This is one of those LA iconic must-go-to places. Its been on every food show and i had always been curious to try it. On my last visit to LA, I made a point of going... First impression when i walked in and saw the lines was "Is this the BMV?". Its organized chaos in this place. There are like 5 lines with 50 people in each line and they move so fast, its hard to believe. The staff here is phenomenal. Really that is the only way to put it. I really didnt know what to order so i let them pick and i ended up with a Beef Dip and potato salad. Both were very good and i would definitely come back again. The joint itself has a funky layout. There is some kind of Train museum/exhibit thing in the restaurant which i didn't really understand, but my kids loved it. Not the cleanest place, but its not dirty either. I am not sure why.. but there was sawdust all over the floor.. Very interesting stuff to look at and the people are very friendly. Next time i want to try the Pork Dip. I think it was about $10 a person when you throw in a drink. Personally i think that is a little high, but.. Its LA.

This place is located near Chinatown so finding a parking spot wasn't a pleasant experience. After taking forever searching for a parking spot, we finally got to see what the fuss was all about at this place. When we walked in, there were multiple lines to the wall. They are known for their french dipped sandwiches so we decided to try all the selections they had to offer. We tried the beef, pork, ham, lamb, and turkey. The best was the lamb and the most plain was the turkey. They also had the spicy mustard condiment that added a strong kick to their sandwiches. The seating area is self-serve. The place is pretty spacious so even if it was packed, you can still find a seat. Their chili is the best I've ever had. It was just delicious! If I am ever around the area, I'd drop by again, worth the wait!

Things to live by: All servers behind the counter except the first on the right will take orders for sandwiches. It seems everyone always goes to the left with massive lines. CASH ONLY. They do have an ATM. The first server on the right can sell salads, soups, sides, etc, just no sandwiches. Sandwiches: the double dip beef is a fav. They dip the bread in the au jus just enough to not be soggy, but kick up the flavor. It's not on their menu options. Macaroni Salad, delish. 蔍f you go for their mustard, the horseradish factor will kick ya if you aren't prepared. As a local, I do not go near here on the weekends, but on a weekday, even at lunch time, a seat is open. Be prepared to sit at a table with others. Easy to see why it's a LA landmark eatery.

I've been to Philippe's 3 times and I've always ordered the popular French Dip Beef Sandwich and each time I've been disappointed. The beef is dry, chewy and tastes unseasoned unless you enhance it with mustard and pepper. As for the famous juice the sandwich bread is dipped in, it just doesn't have any flavor you'd expect, which just leaves me with soggy bread. Why I only ordered the French Dip Beef Sandwich? I thought that if I tried it enough, I'd end up liking it as much as the other Philippe loyalist, but that was not the case. That was obvious this afternoon, I was disappointed once again. I also wasn't that thrilled with the potato salad that had entirely too much mayonnaise. There is sawdust on the floor, cool vintage decor and communal tables that bring a diverse crowd together. However, the service is slow and their famous French Dip is not worth the drive or the wait in line.

My friend took me here for the first time, and seeing as he's an incredibly weird guy, I was suspicious at first. I tried to equate it to anywhere I'd been before, and eventually came to realize that the closest thing was my highschool cafeteria. Ladies who don't speak great english take your order and then direct you to put the money (cash only) on a tray and then they poke it with a pencil eraser like it's made out of contact poison. Then they take it to the master lunchlady who is the only one allowed to touch the poison money, and she gives you your poison change conveyed to you on the same platter. Then they give you a french dip on a soggy recycled paper plate. I like french dips, and this one was pretty good. I could have eaten at least two and a half of what they gave me, but I decided to give it another shot. I took my little friend alex there a few days later. His first comment was to look at me in fear and ask "Does a giant hamster live here?" The wood shavings all over the floor are a little weird. Whether a giant hamster does live there, or if it's to clean up kids' puke as it was in highschool, I'm not really sure, but it does kind of smell like a hamster cage. We went and ordered our french dip, quarantine money protocol was followed, and boom. Two small french dips on soggy paper plates. That'll be $15, somehow. Alright. The french dip was pretty good, but it was small, you're not trusted to dip your own french (they just pour it on for you), and seriously how much does that sandwitch cost to make? Some roast beef, a small amount of gravy, a roll and a single slice of swiss cheese, mass produced, can't run them more than a dollar, maybe two, to make. And it's not like they have some crazy process in making it, I saw the woman slap it together. $15 for something I could eat by myself and still be hungry isn't cute unless it causes diabetes or is illegal, and this was neither. 蔝nless I'm spending $10 to experience the joy of walking through wood-shaving laden highschool cafeteria nostalgia, I don't get it. My friend wasn't impressed. That further reinforced that I wasn't really all that impressed, either. If I ever need to get food when I'm sick and not very hungry though, I'll probably go back. Not only will their little french dip fill me up, but if I throw up while I'm there, the wood shavings will make it way easier to clean up. Win win.

I got in a long, long line in a really old school, historic eatery dating back to the early 20th century. 蔆ool. �After many minutes, but no problem since I could peruse the joint and entertain myself, I finally got to order my lamb french dip. 蔍 also ordered a "Bordeaux" to go with my lamb. �I sat down and opened my mouth and took a bite.........the lamb was dry, tasteless, and bland. 蔜he bread was dry and dead tasting even with the dip into the jus. 蔜he red wine was SWILL. 蔈ven two buck chuck from Trader Joe's was better.

I've heard so many good things about this place and their French Dip sandwiches. I've seen them featured in TV a couple of times. I was very excited to finally try it. I got their beef dip sandwich and it was just okay. It tasted like an ordinary beef dip sandwich. I didn't really taste anything special about it. I guess the big deal was just cuz they were the originators of the sandwich. The food was priced very cheaply. I hadn't bought food that cheap in a long time living in LA. I got their potato salad and it was good too. Also their tapioca was tasty. I drank an iced tea. Make sure to have cash cuz they don't take card! They do have an ATM machine there. I think it charged $2 or $2.50. I didn't realize they didn't take card till I got to the front of the line and I ordered my food, despite the large signs everywhere indicating that. The lady was nice and let me run over to the ATM to take out some cash. The lady my friend ordered from wasn't as nice to her. She was a bit impatient with my friend. Lunch time there is not very good for vegetarians. They do have salads but that's pretty much it. My friend ordered a piece of bread with cheese. I was there around lunch time on a Sunday during Ciclavia. When I first arrived the place wasn't crowded at peak time it got very crowded. The lines do move fast though and there are plenty of lines. The seating is communal. There are lunch tables everywhere and you will sit with a bunch of strangers. I don't mind this but I did encounter one woman who started moving our food cuz we let her know we were almost done. So rude! Parking was easy enough. I'm not sure if it was just cuz of Ciclavia, though. I found parking in 2 minutes but I think it can get hard during peak lunch time. They have 2 lots with free parking. If those are full there is also metered parking.

What can I say that hasn't been said in the 2,667 reviews that came before this one? 蔜he five stars are for the simplicity of a damned good sangweesh that hasn't been tampered with for over 100 years. 蔜oo bland? 蔔o salty? 蔔o 蔜oo big? 蔔o. 蔜oo small? 蔔o. 蔍t's just right. 蔍t was just right in 1908 and it's still just right in 2012.

I get it. 蔈veryone thinks they can build a better mouse trap. 蔈ven though Bill Gates makes real shitty software, you'd be a douche to try to tell a guy who's 蔱arned a trillion dollars selling shitty software how to make better software. 蔅ut I cannot resist the temptation to make a recommendation to a sandwich shop that tells its customers not to make recommendations, so here goes: 蔋ow about a couple more cash registers?

I went there with my bf the other day and he ordered a whole pie. They had only one but was missing one slice. A nice lady who was helping him originally was gonna just add another slice from different pie but another person came up to her and said she can't do that. My bf asked the owner but he still said you can't add another one, you have to pay the whole price even though it's missing one slice and not gonna give you any discount. So he paid the whole price but was very unhappy. I couldn't understand why they had to act like an old robot that can't be flexible. Also I think their sandwich is good but nothing impressive and it's over priced.

Came here when I first moved out to Los Angeles. Apparently, this is one of the hotspots and absolutely must haves. A bit strange that such a classic place is located in Chinatown, but what the hey - it's an original landmark. Parking is plenty and convenient, which is never a bad thing when in LA. AMBIANCE: Classic! Upon entrance, you can immediately tell that this place is special. It is still reminiscent of what it looked like when it first opened. It is deli style with the glass display with homemade desserts covered with cellophane. The tables are the long-cafeteria style with seats. You will be sharing tables with strangers, but it doesn't feel awkward at all. Something about being inside that everyone just automatically appears more friendly. FOOD: I ordered a coke and the French Dip, and boy - it was good! The bread was dipped in the fat prior to being placed on top of the sandwich, so it was flavorful! It was altogether awesome! SERVICE: The servers are older women in hairnets and they take orders and put together the items while you stand there. So while this process seem like it takes awhile, there are many lines and many cashiers that it actually becomes pretty smooth. After the meal, an older gentleman came by to clean our table. Since you pick up the food when you order - there's really no additional interactions with the servers. SUMMARY: It is cheap, fun, and classic. A definite must-go!

I really don't get what the fuss is about here. Every time I come to try their French dipped sandwiches, the meat is dry (I've had both beef and pork) and the jus is the only thing saving the sandwich from total disaster. Prices are high, lines are long, and service is downright rude. Not a fan.

Funny how I ended up here. My story started off at the Los Angeles district attorneys office building for an appt. to see the judge. I needed my case to be cleared. I was late to the morning court service so I had two hours to kill before the afternoon doors were opened. I yelped for lunch and stumbled upon Philippes. Funny how I bookmarked this place a year ago after watching it on Diners Drive Ins and Dives. I was coming here for lunch! Walking in was walking into a bit of history. Old school and very traditional, rusty and old. But that's what made Philippes attractive, for tourists and foodies. I went straight for the classic beef dip w/ side of cole slaw. I tried to ignore the hype about this place but sadly, the dip wasn't all that great. It was just okay. The dip needed more seasoning, more flavor. It was still a little dry after one dip. But what did help was the hot mustard sauce. That, with a bite of cole slaw actually made enjoy the sandwich a lot more. This place has history written all over but food is just average. Try not to expect so much but do enjoy the atmosphere and decor here!

Total disorganization and confusion. They had four registers open. I stood in line for 20 minutes. Nothing happened. Nobody moved. They are a cash only business, and they have four freaking things on the menu. It should not take this long. I felt like I was stuck in a time warp. I saw people cutting in line, so moved over to where they were standing. I had cash in hand ready to place my order. Some lady in a bonnet and apron asked me if I was waiting for my food. No! I'm waiting to PLACE my order. It was putting me in a foul mood. I had to get out of there. I don't care for the ambiance. What is that, saw-dust on the floor? The costumes that the ladies wear are bogus. I guess they are going for the Mennonite/Amish look. Not a good place to go to if you are in a hurry. I'm sure the food here sucks too.

After going through Jaymie Lynn S.'s bucket list, I stumbled upon Philippe and decided to come here with her. I've never heard of it before, but apparently it's been hyped up like crazy by the Travel Channel as one of L.A.'s go to places. Unfortunately, 蕋his is one of those establishments that doesn't live up to its hype. I cam around 11am on a Friday after beating L.A. traffic and torrential downpours. One of the best things here is the huge parking lot, which was about half full when I came. By this time of the day however, you will be waiting about 10 min in line just to order. I hoped the food would make up for the wait... I ordered the Lamb Dip with a slice of American cheese. I expected something exceptional, delicious, and mind blowing, but was met with a simple sandwich I could have easily made by myself. The bread felt and tasted like something you would see in the discount section at Food 4 Less. You're given two or three palm sized slices of lamb at best, so your sandwich just feels dull and empty. The cheese was simple American and added some contrast to an otherwise terribly plain sandwich. Worst thing is the lady who made our sandwich wasn't even wearing gloves. I'll admit a B rating for any Asian restaurant just stands for "better tasting," but this doesn't apply here. For $9, I could have easily went to Subway and gotten a much better tasting sandwich.

After watching Man v. Food, I really wanted to try out this "Los Angeles tradition." It does live up to its reputation and I urge anyone who passes by LA to dry by Chinatown and try it. Try the lamb. That is my favourite one. I've been here a few times and up till now, it's never too dry. I really do enjoy the french dip style -- sometimes I ask them to dip my bread also. If that's your thing, definitely go ahead. There's not a lot that needs to be said about Philippe -- it's just a great sandwich store. They also sell other things -- desserts, macaroni salads, chili. At least in my experience, these dishes aren't super spectacular so if it's a first visit, you can do without them. Finally, it's always packed. Be sure to wait!

Just because the media raves about a place doesn't mean that it's great; more than likely, it's going to be over-rated. I first heard about this place a few years back during a USC college football game-day tailgate food review and thought the pictures of these french dipped sandwiches look quite amazing and decided I had to come try for myself. The first time I tried it, I ordered a beef dip, double-dipped. It was still quite dry but worst of all, it was bland. The au jus broth needed better seasoning in my opinion. I thought to myself, maybe I wasn't eating it right. So I tried their signature hot mustard. Which was overwhelmingly hot. Way too much horse-radish. I would describe it as eating a sandwich spread with wasabi. Not too good. I recently came back a few years later because a friend wanted to try it. This time it was a little better. But that's because I'm old enough to drink now. Their selection of wine and beer is decent. I enjoyed their cabernet. Would be more convenient if they accepted credit cards so I could open a tab. 蔅ut the sandwich is still overrated. I tried the lamb dip this time and had it wet. It wasn't dry this time around but I don't get what's so great about it. It was tender enough but lacked a distinguished gameness that would have gone well with the cab. 蔍've also started enjoying the various types of mustards as I've gotten older but I have to say I don't think I'll ever acquire the taste for Philippe's house mustard I do like the ambience of the place somewhat.. Can be overcrowded if you come at the wrong time on weekends. And during this time, the employees can be less friendly but I supposed I'd be too if I had a bunch of hungry people screaming orders at me because the place can get loud. If you really want to try it, you can always do take out. I wouldn't come here again, but I suppose you should try it once just to say you've been there done that when you were in the area.

It's too bad I have to come down to Los Angeles to enjoy these sandwiches but when I'm down there it's more than worth the trip. Interesting that this last time I was there they changed the mustard dispensers and the sandwiches seemingly were smaller. Maybe it's me but who cares? Still good after all of these years.

OMG my review for this place disappeared somehow. I LOVE THIS JOINT! but hey what do you expect from a Triple D destination! This is my favorite grub spot within 5 miles of Grand Central Station. Also better known as Downtown LA! The king of dips IMHO. Its gotten a bit more expensive over the years but the grub here is awesome. I always end up with the roast beef au jus I get extra au jus on the side and a couple of gerkin pickles. I love to drink the mini draft beer or have some of the fresh squeezed lemonade. They have several meats available here. For example my grandfathers favorite is the lamb dip. 蔍 started coming here with my grandfather in the early 80s after USC games that I would go to with him. It was a great experience and even lasted into the 2000s before my grandfather had to stop attending games. Consequently not only is it awesome food, but it holds a super special place in my heart. Ohhhhh we cant forget the rolls can we. They are beyond awesome as well. 蔛o soft and tasty on the inside and so absolutely perfectly crusty outside. After being double dipped or single dipped into the au jus, it softens and makes the rolls so much more tasty! ...now i am pissed at myself since its 10:45 and I am craving this chit... grrrrr... ohhh well sometime soon I will go get some more. Their grub is just soooo tasty that I love it and then some. Pro Tip: Do not park in the parking lot adjacent to the restaurant, park across the street in the second lot Pro Tip #2: share a bench with a few strangers and make a couple of new friends to broaden the experience and enjoy some new company! Pro Tip #3: There is an ATM on site but it is CASH ONLY!!! Pro Tip #4: Check all the lines from the stairs to see which is the shortest... Anticipate waiting a bit to order your food while standing in line.

The home of the French dip sandwich is located within walking distance from Union Station. If you're coming for lunch, expect long lines but, trust me, it's worth the wait. The menu is pretty simple and the prices are extremely reasonable. I've tried all the meats and they're all good. Trust me and get your sandwich double dipped with spicy mustard. Don't forget to get a side or a dessert. Their pies are freshly baked everyday and their sides are homemade. Honestly, you really can't lose here. Just a tip: 蔜his is a cash only joint. Sure, there's an ATM but do you really want to pay extra fees? Also, the ladies cannot touch the money with their hands so place your payment on the plate when you get to the front of the line.

For me, Phillipe did not live up to the amazing reviews from my friends who frequent the restaurant. The famous french dip sandwich was probably my least favorite part of the experience, because I found it bland, soggy, and too small for the price. My side order of potato salad was just okay... nothing special. I wasn't crazy about the restaurant itself either--to me it felt too campy, and the set-up for ordering food at the counter was peculiar (though I guess a high-traffic place such as this probably processes customers much quicker this way). After being completely underwhelmed by an un-impactful meal and dining experience, I don't plan on returning to Phillipe.

What can you really say about this landmark restaurant that hasn't already been said? The spicy mustard is crazy spicy so squirt with caution!! 蔍 found that out the hard way and almost sneezed myself to death. The coffee is 50 cents, or something close to that, a cup. 蔣um! The coffee cake is to die for! Can't beat the dipped roast beef sandwiches.... Don't come during lunch time in Downtown L.A.. 蔍 made the mistake of taking my mom out to lunch during lunch hour and the place was super packed! 蔍t was hard to find a seat and order. 蔅ut what do you expect? 蔜he prices are reasonable and the food is just plain amazing. I didn't know it was located close to China Town, but it makes the experience of Philippe in DTLA that much more enjoyable. I will totally go back and next time not at lunch.

So I decided to try this restaurant before going to a Dodgers game. The reviews on Yelp got me excited about this place, however, when I actually got my food I was quite disappointed. I'm not really sure what the big hype is, but I could've made a better french dip myself at home. They weren't very generous with the amount of meat they put in the sandwich, and the sides were so-so. I won't be going back.

Glad I finally got to try the lamb dip. The lamb slices are thick and the cheese is soooo good. It did taste a little dry -- maybe because it's a sandwich made to be dipped? Still, I think the meat could have been juicier. The horseradish mustard (which turned my nose bright red since I piled it on) was awesome and makes up for anything and everything though. Although the sandwich doesn't really look that big, it is definitely heavy and coma-inducing. Good enough for me to ignore the nagging feeling that it's a sandwich I could totally put together myself if I weren't so lazy.

Yelp really doesn't need another great review of Phillippe, but here it is anyway. Its an institution, but unlike so many L.A. "institutions", annoying vegan hipsters haven't taken it over and made it, well, annoying. (see my review of Porto's for more on that) I always try and get there early (before noon)to beat the large lines, but even so, they move pretty fast, and there are a whole counter of them. Just pick the shortest one. The beef dip is the best, no, it is not "huge" but somehow it is very filling. I like their sides, particularly the potato salad. It is totally "old school"...the drinks are in a small glass, and no refills! My kids are fans of the turkey (thick cut, roasted turkey) and the pork. Get the pickle. I like their fruit pies, but the cream pies are just not my fave, not a fan of the cream on it. I just love sitting there, eating my sammie in the old, crumbly place with all the rest of the nuts that live here in L.A. Plus you can always spy a tourist or two who doesn't know what they're doing, it makes you feel like such a "local". 蔍ts that rare place in L.A. that actually has that sense of "place".

The biggest con since Bernir Madoff. Pricey, extra-small portions, everything al a carte (a bag of potato chips will set you back one or two digits!) AND to top it off - you are guaranteed the opportunity to dine next to an unremoved cafeteria tray. Thanks but no thanks - I'll stick with Subway.

After seeing Philippe's on Travel Channel...and hearing about it from friends, I knew I had to add it to my LA Bucket List. I am disappointed to report...it was not worth it. I ordered the Lamb, double dipped (as so many people recommended). 蔍 was not impressed. 蔠hile the meat itself was quite good, I don't think the sandwich as a whole was very appetizing. 蔉or example, ordering the double dip, I thought it would make the meat more juicy, but all it really did was make the bread soggy. 蔔o change was made to the meat. :[ There is free parking in two lots they own. �a major plus for being in downtown!) Dmitriy S. and I arrived just before 11 on a weekday, and there was still ample parking, but at just after 1, when we were heading out, it was clear that things had picked up while we ate. �Overall, I suppose it is worth a try for the experience, and to say you've been to the "world famous Philippe," but there are most certainly much better places out there.

Honestly... I have to say, I really do not get ALL the hype about this place. It is definitely not the worst place I have been, but far from being as spectacular as I have heard. First of all it was a giant mess as far as organized. The registers kept closing and a couple customers were rudely shoving their way in front of you and actually shocked and acting like they were entitled when you speak out about it. I abhor people like that. There is an extensive menu on one wall, but I had heard such rave reviews about the �french dip sandwiches that I wanted to see what all the fuss was about. I ordered the Turkey dip and a baked apple. The baked apple was divine. It was the first one I have ever had and it did not disappoint. I wish I could say the same for the sandwich... the turkey was a bit dry and quite frankly I have made sandwiches that tasted better, myself, and I am horribly inefficient in the kitchen. Everyone swears by the Lamb... but I am not a fan of Lamb so maybe I am missing out on what all the hoopla is about.. but I can say, I would not recommend the turkey. Would I come back here? 蔖robably. I believe in giving a place more that one chance, only because sometimes you go back and they are having a better day or some of their menu items are better than others. So I would try something else next time... but definitely not the turkey... And it 蔵s not on my list of top places to return to, but if I am in the neighborhood and I feel like trying a sandwich or breakfast item, I might stop back by... If there other food is better, than I will have no problem reviewing my review... but as of right now, the 3 stars is mostly for the baked apple.

Roast Beef Dip!!! I'm not sure what else to say. I've never thought about this place as a destination, like "hey, let's go to Phillipes". It's always an after thought when I pass by (I take the back roads into Alhambra/South Pass). The deciding factor is if I see a parking spot, then the "god's are shining on me". I also like that they have some kind of "grandfather clause" that allows them to keep the rustic (inside of a barn) decor. The sandwich with xtra au jus and a lemonade put me in such a shiny mood that my co-workers got me a gift certificate -- Hey, wait a minute. What are you guys trying to say?

It's not a good idea to bring your old school granny here. Mine went ballistic when she saw the prices (they rose since we've last been here) and worse I forgot they accept 'cash only'. And then the sandwich is the equivalent size of two white castles, with more bread than meat. Although their food is good, I'm not sure if its worth the money anymore.

I came here on a late Saturday afternoon, and true to form, there was a ridiculous-out-the-door line. 蔅ut I'd heard a lot about this iconic place, and since I was in the neighborhood, I thought I'd give it a try. 蔖lus, the Man vs. Food episode made it look really, really good. They have a big menu and all sorts of items in the display case, but it seemed all anyone wanted was a sandwich and maybe a side of macaroni salad or apple pie. 蔠hen I got up to the counter (half an hour later), I ordered the lamb sandwich, no cheese, single dipped because I thought double dipping would make it too soggy. 蔍 noticed the lady sliced the mean right off a cooked lamb leg, and I gave the place a few brownie points for that. 蔜he rest of the meats, however, looked pre-sliced. �As I was waiting for my sandwich, I realized why this place as a perpetual wait--there is only ONE cash register. 蔜here are about 10 ladies who prepare and serve your food, and they bring your money on a little tray to a single lady at a cash register. 蔄ny brownie points I had given the place were immediately taken back. 蔣ou'd think that in the 100+ years this place has been around, they would've stepped up their game a bit and invested in an item (another register...or five) that would speed things along. 蔍'm not sure why they keep it this way (perhaps tradition?), but it makes very little sense. As for the sandwich, overall, it was just ok. 蔜he meat was very tender, but there wasn't as much flavor as I had anticipated. 蔖erhaps if I had gotten it double dipped, I would've tasted more flavor, but as it was, it was pretty bland. 蔍 added the hot mustard, but I didn't particularly like it on the sandwich. 蔍t covered up any flavor the sandwich had with a strong horseradish taste and distracted with that burning up your nose and into your brain sensation you get from eating too much wasabi at once. 蔍 think the sandwich would've been better served with a course brown mustard and perhaps a giardinera mix of peppers. 蔄t $8 a sandwich, I was hoping for more. I likely won't be back. 蔍t's a total time waste, and there is better food to be had elsewhere.

The original French dip!! Hasn't changed at all over the decades. All the order lines feature a waitress " carver" that puts the sandwich together and puts a plate out for the money and a tip! I guess they're the original sandwich makers! I do like that they still have the old school vinegar eggs, and they make their own mustard. The beef, the lamb, and the pork are my favorites, however I have seen the turkey and that looks good! 蔍 actually come for the breakfast more often, just your basic breakfast eggs and sausage with coffee. I have had the pork chops also that were really hearty and good. I feel its the same thing with all these old classic eateries.... there are places that now are much better for taste. However... you can only get that nostalgia, comforting taste and feel from the original. I really hope they never change a thing!!

I LOVE Eli G.'s review to this place, BUTTT I'm going to have to disagree on a couple of details. Eating a dipped sandwich from this place ISN'T like have sex with a really ugly girl (well, in my case, a really ugly guy). Its actually more like having sex with a REALLY HOT GUY whom you thought was going to give you the best ride of your life but then before you even get to that halfway point, he finishes. And then its like a double dick slap to the face when you ask for a double dipped sandwich for that extra wet sensation but when you finally get to putting your mouth around it, there's not drop of jus to be found. Almost worse then when Mr. Hottie disappointed but then got up and walked off to the bathroom with his head held high as if it was the best ride he'd ever given anyone in his life. Pathetic, disappointing with absolutely nothing to slurp. On the plus side, I liked the brownie I ordered ! 1 star for that ! Yay ! Happy eating (;

I was excited to try this place because of all the praise it's received. I arrived later in the afternoon to avoid the lunch rush and ordered within 5 minutes. I got the beef sandwich with a side of macaroni salad and an ice tea. They only take cash so keep that in mind. You put my money on the little money tray, which the server takes back to the cashier and who in turn puts your change back on the tray. Your server never touches the money. I'm presuming that way the server, who also handles your food, doesn't have to touch the filthy stuff. This was probably the highlight of the experience. Once the server gets your food, which comes on paper plates, she puts it on a tray and away you go. Everything looked ordinary but that didn't deter me. I decided to sit on one of the long family/group style tables and prepared myself for something extraordinary. I took my pictures (See Photo) and grab some napkins from one of the dispensers to prepare. Then I took my first bite. Hmm. Everything had good flavor but it was just okay. Decent but ordinary. I also thought since they were famous for their french dip sandwiches you'd get some great au jus sauce to dip it in. Nope, they dip it for you and that's what you get. What a bummer. I love retro places and this still has that 50's feel. Sadly, it felt more like the communist 50's. My server seemed miserable, along with everyone else working there. Not one smile to be seen or thank you to be heard. Made the whole experience kind of sad, like grade school cafeteria gloom and doom. It's amazing what a simple smile can do. I would like to go back and try the delicious looking pies, but I'm not going out of my way for it. (Photo Available)

Have been going to Philippe's for over 20 years. Walk in. Notice the line, don't freak, it moves pretty fast, just get your money out and know what you want. CASH ONLY folks... ATM machine on the wall opposite of the ordering counter... .. The lady's that serve you have been working there longer than most of us have been alive, watch as they make your order while you wait. Don't forget to tip them for putting your meal together quick and with a smile... My Order: Turkey double Dipped w/ Blue Cheese (slathered with hot mustard at the table) (yes turkey is GREAT with blue) Pickled Egg.. a must Potato Salad if I'm really hungry Tapioca pudding to finish it off I have tried every sandwich more than once all, single dipped, doubled dipped or all wet..... I feel that my order has been perfected.... If it is your first time at Philippe's. (and you don't want a turkey sandwich) 蔍 suggest 蕐ou try the Lamb, double dipped. It will give you the most flavor for you buck.. not a fan of lamb? Try the Pork... Don't eat pork?.. okay get the beef... Don't like beef? umm... �you must have been coming in to use the ATM, please exit to the right or left.. Thank you... If not continue reading... Don't expect a side of Au jus with your dip... the bread is dipped when you order. If you order a dip- one half of your bread with be dunked (you'll want more) double dip- both pieces of bread go for a dip (perfect amount) all wet- the entirety of your sandwich gets a bath .. (beware soggy) Try the pickled egg. Yes, they are purple. Do you like pickles? Fan of hard boiled eggs? Whats the problem? order it trust me.. Tasty stuff .. Tapioca pudding is my favorite tapioca.. great way to end the meal.. i usually end up taking the little plastic cup home and eating it later.. If you really aren't in the mood for a dip, Clam Chowder is good. If their for breakfast corn beef hash plate good deal.. Enjoy this LA landmark.. bite by bite... **Side Note- I have been to Cole's twice. I get that the two french dip places opened around the same time, and they both have a french dip on the menu. I however, do not believe they should be compared. Cole's is a sit down dining experience. Their french dip is served w/ thin sliced beef with au jus on the side... Pretty tasty.. their downfall however is the roll .. It feels like a cheap gas station sandwich roll. Thank goodness for the tasty au jus to soak up..

I've been here many times, and hadn't ordered more than coffee and a roll. They really aren't vegetarian friendly. However, I participated in a 'Best Breakfast Hike,' and this was our first breakfast stop. The breakfast combo was recommended ($7.25, french toast or pancakes, sausage or bacon, 2 eggs and small juice or coffee), and it was a pretty standard breakfast. Tasty, but not mind blowing, and not as big as I expected (not for sharing). The homemade donut and coffee cake were recommended, too, and I found them to be ordinary. The coffee (whose price recently went up) is excellent and only 45 cents! CASH ONLY.

This place is amazing!! I was here on Friday for the first time and had the beef french dip, it was absolutely perfect. Bread was soaked but managed to stay crispy the entire time. The beef is tender and the au jus is not to salty, it is perfect.

Double-dipped please! 蔠ith swiss and a custard cup. 蔕h, and chili? 蔛ure. 蔄nd get me a bowl of corn chowder too, that's too delicious to not drizzle some on the sandwich. Parking is a little tougher on weekends, but there's the lot and street parking. 蔆ash only, which is the only reason this isn't five-star. 蔖rices have gone up over the years, but still great quality food at a very reasonable price.

3.5 stars. Just because something is (supposedly) "the original," doesn't make it "the best." .... The actual food is alright. The environment is fun and it's more of a "ooh history!" kind of a visit. Philippe's is a fast-paced and always busy eatery so there is usually a 30 minute plus wait. I don't mind at all really. And kudos for the staff for being efficient and helpful. The french dip beef sandwich and turkey sandwich was just OK. It's a nice bite to eat but I don't know what all the fuss is about in regards to the food. The meat quality wasn't anything great like some reviews are saying. It's a few steps up from gas station food but the food is nothing worth driving a long distance for. I would have preferred that I get the au jus on the side so I can dip to my heart's content instead of being forced to eat pre-dipped bread that gets soggy faster. I realize this could be a logistical nightmare - trying to serve up hundreds of little side containers of dip could be hectic and messy....I wonder if I was simply supposed to ASK for it on the side??? Maybe I did it wrong...hmm. For us, Philippe's was more about the experience and taking part of a historic and popular place. I mean, really, the sandwiches are just straight forward, regular tasting, regular quality. The macaroni and potato salads were good. I preferred the potato salad. Way too much mayo in the macaroni. Thankfully these were served cold - I was a bit concerned at first because it looked like they were just leaving the salads in a room temperature case. But worry not! :P The lemonade was refreshing, as was the sweet and tangy grapefruit juice. I would get the juices again if I ever decide to revisit. We sat upstairs - it was very quiet and reminded us of those old Russian or Asian elementary school rooms. Kind of dim and a bit creepy but the community feeling is nice. All in all, a nice relaxed experience but the food is simply on par - it's worth coming to for the legend of the place but don't expect great food - just average food.

When I first heard about Philippe's, I just kept thinking it was the kind of french dip sandwich where you take the sandwich and dip it in au jus. Taking a recommendation from the cashier, she told me to get the beef french dipped sandwich. I got it and I didn't see any au jus for dipping, because the sandwich is dipped (once or twice) then given to you. My friend got an apple to share and I got the sweet pickles and macaroni salad. The beef was good, but I wanted it to be dipped again!! I didn't know!! But I've also heard that if you get it dipped twice, it's too soggy (conflicted). So, I thought a little mustard would fix the sandwich up and so I slathered it onto half my sandwich, took a bite, and was spitting fire out my mouth. It was hot spicy mustard and I didn't know. Luckily, I got a lemonade and didn't put mustard on my entire sandwich. Overall, sandwich was ok, lemonade ok, sides ok, but apple pie was delicious!! I kept seeing people walking around with these baked apples & a huge scoop of vanilla ice cream, I want that next time!! Coming back for the pies and other desserts, not sure about the sandwich.

Go.... Order yourself 2 of the Pork sandwiches, single dip, no cheese, and a root beer. Then put on a dab of the insane mustard (not too much there hot pants!!...you'll be cryin' like a bitch!)....to me the taste is pure heaven. I go about once every 2 months for my fix.. This is a true, traditional French Dip pork sandwich...basic, but one of, if not the best French Dip sandwiches (didn't they invent the damn thing?). Fuck the beef, lamb, turkey...whatever...they're all o.k (actually better than o.k).....I just love that extra tenderness from the pork. The discussion between Philippe's and Cole's is really a no brainer. I go to Cole's for the bar (awesome old school style), not the french dip (which they stopped doing properly 20 years ago)...I go to Philippe's for the french dip, which to my knowledge hasn't changed in 100 years.

I may be a little biases! I have been coming here since I was a little girl with my mom and dad and the place has great memories. Now I bring my son here and anyone else who will trek downtown with me. 蔍 love introducing people to this place! So ready, here is what you order your first trip!! �- 1 turkey double dipped sandwich - 1 side of cole slaw - 1 lemonade - 1 roll of choloate necco wafers from the old skool candy counter just before you leave. The place is great. 蔣es, there are long lines (especially on Dodger game day, but just get over it, it is worth the wait and the experience) and yes, they only take cash (I widh this would change, but honestly who cares because there is an ATM in the back)! Parking is either in the lot right behind the restuarant or across the street in thier second lot. Other things to know: the lines on the left move faster (maybe this is my imagination), the baked apples are grand and only available in season), the mustard is HOT (be careful), the place is very, very casual and 蕋o no other restuarant compares to this place. I think I will go again tonight!

I'm not a native Angeleno so I may not have the same affinity for Phillipe's as most do. 蔍 saw it many times while walking by and had to try a restaurant that has been around since 1908. 蔍 love trying old restaurants. 蔜his place has a lot of character with old style menus, old counter workers with hairnets who dress like they're back in 1940, cramped seating, and plenty of memorabilia decorating the walls of this old timey establishment. 蔔othing modern here which is great because it's like going back in time. �I never tried a french dip sandwich prior to going here. 蔍'm glad I tried my first where they claim to have invented it. 蔍 usually get the turkey french dipped sandwich with macaroni salad. 蔜he food is delicious and the prices are inexpensive. 蔜he downside is that the servings are not large so you might leave hungry. �The lines are usually very long which is a good thing because it shows you how popular the restaurant is and you see 3 or 4 generations of families eating here. 蔄s a newcomer to Los Angeles, it makes you want to eat here and be part of an LA landmark. 蔍t's also nice to go to a popular place in LA that's not filled with wanna-be actors, tourists, or other transplants. 蔊oing here, you're around real LA folks. 蔕n the other hand, if you don't like long lines, noise, cramped seating then this might not be the place for you.

Meh. Really, everyone? You're that impressed? I came for the donuts which my boyfriend said were rated some of the best in LA. I was skeptical (still am) and went with him early one morning. Somehow the woman managed to mess up our order of 4 donuts and two coffees (one with cream). The donuts seemed excessively greasy. The coffee was average. The woman at the register clearly didn't get enough sleep the night before or something. Totally unimpressed.

Immediately walking into the restaurant, you will notice the sawdust on the floor. Honestly, I came here because it was on Man vs Food. And that's the only reason I stayed. I expected the sandwiches to be a little bigger and just looking better. But for the prices, I am satisfied. Lamb is the most expensive ($8) and you're doing yourself a service if you get it. Double dipped and with swiss cheese was my poison. I wouldn't try anything else besides the sandwiches. The clam chowder was pretty watered down. Take that as you will. Should you visit? Hell yes. But unlike your sandwiches, it's not necessarily something you must "double dip".

I had the French-dipped lamb sandwich. O-M-GEEEEEEE. The lamb meat was soooooo tender! If heaven came in form of a physical object, it'd be this lamb meat! I wish they put more lamb meat into their sandwich. The thickness of the bread thinned out the flavor.

You can never go wrong with the french dip here. It just hits the spot since the bread is not too soft or hard and the meat is not overly seasoned BUT I highly recommend the mustard on the side but be careful because it is powerful. Luckily the sides, and drinks such as the lemonade are inexpensive but the sandwiches have gone up in prize...$6.50 each so it's more like a treat than an everyday kinda meal and the fact that you have to contend with the lines and be early especially when the Dodgers are playing.

One of the awesome things that Duke D. and I found out is that we both have the same goal of trying out foods in cities of their namesakes and finding places that were the creators of some common food item. We made a day/afternoon trip out of going to LA to finally get the French dip sandwich at Philippe's. When we both got there, boy was it busy! It was so crowded by regulars and newbies alike. You can see in my picture that it was nuts (and brownie points if you can spot me - let's play "Where's Minerva?"). We finally got to order and made sure to get an original beef sandwich. That was just fantastic. We both actually liked it better than the other sandwich we got. It had a nice thick helping of sliced beef and enough of the sauce on the bun to make the sandwich savory; the sauce kept the bites from being too dry. We also got a side of potato salad that boy oh boy, I loved. I'm a fan of potato salad but especially of how they had cut the potato up into small pieces. The other order was a lamb sandwich with Swiss due to some suggestions/tips I had seen on Yelp. We also each had gotten lemonades for each of us since they were around 75 cents (can't remember) each. They were delicious! The lamb sandwich was pretty good but was the lesser of the two sandwiches. Nice chunks of meat though. What a crowded place to visit but it sure was fun to eat a bit of history. (Note: cash only place)

Ok, I think I have this sandwich figured out. 蔍t's not about the meat, it's about the au jus. �918 was the first year that Philippe himself dropped the sandwich in au jus by accident. 蔜he legend is that the customer agreed to eat it anyway and loved it so much that the next day he came back with friends and asked for all of their sandwiches to be dropped in the au jus. 蔜hus the french dip was born. 蔛o it makes sense that this 100 year old recipe for au jus has been perfected here. From the minute you walk in, you know you are eating at a landmark. 蔜his building is actually the 2nd location of Philippe's. 蔜he first had to be relocated, when the 101 was built. 蔜his building has been serving french dips continuously since 1951 and what an operation they have. 蔄t least 8 or more lines at the counter. 蔠hoever takes your order will also be making your sandwich. 蔣ou have 5 choices, French Dip with roast beef, pork, lamb, turkey, or ham. 蔣ou can have the sandwich single or double dipped. 蔍 highly recommend double dipped unless you have a problem with the texture of soggy bread. �The biggest reason for the double dip, is that the au jus is where all the flavor of this sandwich comes from. 蔠e tried 3 different sandwiches, the roast beef, the pork, and the turkey. 蔄ll three had the same au jus on it. 蔜he turkey was actually the best of the three, with very juicy slices of roasted turkey breast. 蔜he pork came in second and was also quite moist. 蔜he roast beef was the driest meat of the three. 蔍f you eat just the roast beef 蔮y itself, it's not very impressive. 蔏ind of bland and dry. 蔜his is why there are quite a few 3 star reviews on yelp, and I get it. 蔜he au jus is so flavorful that it doesn't really matter what meat you have on your sandwich. 蔛o it comes down to how moist the meat is, because all the sandwiches kind of taste the same. �The true enjoyment of this sandwich for me was the melted swiss cheese next to the brown soggy au jus soaked french roll. 蔜heir technique is to dip the roll, not the whole sandwich, so that's why the roast beef stays on the dry side. 蔜he French rolls were very fresh and just a little crispy on the outside. 蔜his allows them to get soggy without completely falling apart. 蔕n the table is their home made mustard. 蔅e VERY careful with this mustard, It will burn your nostrils just like a Chinese Hot Mustard. 蔍 didn't notice the mustard until right at the end, which was a good thing. 蔍 slathered it on my final bite and WOW. 蔍t had the effect of smelling salts on me as it woke me violently from my food coma. 蔍'm thinking getting a bottle of that, would be a lot cheaper than 5 hour energy. 蔎ust a little between cheek and gum would do the trick. We tried all three sides of potato salad, macaroni salad, 蔭nd cole slaw. 蔜he cole slaw won that battle and was nice and sweet, but very home made tasting with crunchy cabbage. 蔄lso of note were their kosher pickles. 蔜hey are sold whole, but aren't too big and they will slice them i quarters for you. 蔜hey are very crunchy and savory. 蔍 wish I would have gotten some extra to go. 蔍'll have to save that for next time, along with the apple pie that I missed. 蔍 also have a feeling that the Ham dip might be a very good thing. 蔅land ham? 蔍 don't think that exists, so I'll be reporting on that next. Cash only!!! But they have an ATM on site.

we tried the beef & the lamb sandwiches & I loved the lamb the most. I think the lamb has more flavor to it & the meat is so much more tender. The spicy mustard is like yellow wasabi, so be careful how much you use, otherwise, you'd pay for it, like i did. 蔆ash only, so come prepared.

This place is delicious. It is a small, unpretentious sandwich/deli type restaurant, but don't let that fool you. They are home to the original French dip, and it is great.

Came here during the morning when it wasn't too packed and got my order pretty fast. Ordered the roast beef double dip but as I set down and read more reviews, I think I should've ordered the lamb instead. The roast beef wasn't anything extraordinary, in fact very ordinary. Overall, it totally didn't live up to the hype.

Occasion: Lunch with Susan What I Had: Pork French Dip Sandwich Blueberry pie Food Review: The food isn't as amazing as I'd hoped! The pork french dip sandwich is what Philippe is most famous for, and so I decided I'd have to try it. It was juicy, the hot mustard tasted a lot like wasabi, and the pork was the fattiest pork I've ever had. Good and bad to all of this! The blueberry pie was better than the sandwich. I will say that the sandwich buns were pretty good: super soft, but crunchy and flaky on top. �Service Review: Nothing in particular about the service. You leave your platters and disposable plates on your table and a clean-up crew takes care of it. Venue Review: This is experiential dining in one respect. There were about 5 long lines of people waiting to get their order taken at the counter, where they would prepare and hand you your food on the spot. There is plenty of seating everywhere, from high tables to booths. There is also private parking in two lots behind the restaurant. Overall Impression: Philippe reminds me of The Original Pantry Cafe in that they are both historic and very iconic restaurants, but don't have much to offer when it comes to an objective evaluation of their food. This was a fun little excursion nonetheless because the venue is practically a museum dating back to 1908.

After seeing that Phillipe was featured on "Best Thing I've Ever Ate," I decided to see what the hype was all about. Sadly, I was disappointed with the food. The sandwich was not very savory. It felt as if I was eating a blob of unsalted butter. The sides were pretty good, but I probably wouldn't return for the sandwich. ( not worth 8 bucks) This is probably a bias review, since I'm not a fan of French dipped sandwiches.

C'est magnifique! Alright, so I've been dying to try this place for a while now. Plus, what sane carnivore doesn't love a French dip? My boyfriend and I tried the beef and the lamb. We liked the lamb better than the beef because it was more tender. Make sure to try some of their mustard, but beware because it is spicy! (I think it has horseradish in it.) And, mmm their lemonade is tasty (and under a dollar). The pink beans and coleslaw are pretty tasty too. Sadly enough we didn't have room for dessert, but the pumpkin pie was desperately trying to lure me back in line. The interior has a nostalgic feel creating a comfortable and casual dining environment. Make sure to bring cash! There are ATMs, but it's easier just to have it already.

If you go earlier in the morning or in the middle of the afternoon, parking is much better and the lines are much much shorter. Also bring cash. Everything can be a tiny bit pricey, but it's quite good and the portions are alright. The french dips are nice and the hot mustard is the best thing here. Standard things like potato salad, macaroni salad, and coleslaw are good as well.

Why all the hoopla?! It's been over a year since I wrote my last review, but i felt the need to get off my lazy bum and write a review based on my experience at Phillipe. 蔛o why relapse all of a sudden? 蔕ne word probably would best describe it: DISAPPOINTMENT. �A few years back while watching the food network, i saw a little a skit about how Phillipe's invented the french dip sub. 蔅eing a huge fan on the french dip sub, i knew that i must one day try it out for myself. That day finally came...and it's very sad to say I couldn't be more disappointed. I'll just list the pros and cons below: Cons 1. Long wait (about an hour on the Saturday I went) - due to DOG SLOW service 2. Weird seating arrangement - The ordering line runs parallel to the some of the seating, making it a little awkward when trying to eat your sandwich in piece. 3. The most important factor is the actual taste of my sub. 蔄nother yelper probably said it best, "original doesn't always make it the best". 蔍n the case, it was just plain boring. 蔜he bread was bland. 蔜he meat itself was standard. 蔜astes like beef, but just didn't have that savory taste i was expecting. 蔒ost importantly though was the au jus. 蔍t had almost no flavor and I had my sub completely submerged in it. Pros 1 only 1 pro - The parking. 蔜hey have a parking lot just adjacent to the actual building, so save your quarters and park there. �Sorry Phillipe - I had high hopes for you, but maybe my hopes were a little to high? 蔠hichever the case, I'm giving you 2 stars for your dog slow service, awkward seating, and your bland sandwich.

I love Philippes! Almost every time I come to Los Angeles, I want to come here! This is usually a required stop when going to China Town. When you first walk in, you notice a very long deli counter and a huge crowd! I typically get the Turkey French Dipped sandwich, a bowl of straight chili (no beans) and a glass of lemonade! The chili is amazing considering it is very simple! The turkey is sooooooooooooo good! It is juicy and perfectly flavored. I also like that bread is dipped in the juice! This makes the bread soft and juicy. While I have never tried the eggs, potato salad or other deli items, I hear they are very good. There is also a ton of seating in Philippe's! There are long tables everywhere and more on the second floor! The staff here is very nice! If you want to make them mad though, ask for fries and see what happens!

If you're looking for a quality, tasty french dip then look no further. The lines are usually long but they move quickly. I think that tells you right there how popular this place is and how good the food is. There's plenty of seating at tables, booths, and on stools. The restaurant has an old-school vibe to it. If you are a fan of au jus sauce then ask for the sandwich "double dipped". Cheese is also an option for the sandwiches, but I feel like it can overwhelm the beefy french dip flavory goodness. I've also tried the potato salad and pickles which are both fantastic sides. You really can't mess up by coming here.

I was really really looking forward to trying the double dipped sandwich here but I was pretty disappointed in the end. 蔍 ordered the beef dipped sandwich (single dipped) with swiss cheese and the sandwich turned out to be dry and rather flavorless. 蔍 tried my friend's sandwich which was the same but double dipped and it just ended up tasting soggier than mine. However for wasabi lovers out there, if you dot the sandwich with drops of mustard they have provided on the tables the taste will improve significantly! 蔍f you don't really enjoy the taste of wasabi then I would warn against the mustard they have there!!!! This place is a three star for me only because the sandwiches were not what I expected but everything else tasted AMAZING. The lemonade at Philippe's was absolutely great :) 蔜heir potato salad was really enjoyable, and it had the perfect amount of onions in it to give it a strong taste. 蔍 highly recommend trying that as well as their pudding. 蔜he pudding actually kind of reminds me of an asian dessert (Taro Coconut Milk with Tapioca). 蔍t's sweet with a milky taste to it. Overall slightly disappointed in Philippe's but they do have a couple of things worth trying out!

I'm a sucker for a piece of juicy meat, but unfortunately the sandwiches here were a complete turnoff. Anything but juicy, despite the dip, and completely seasonless, necessitating careful application of the horseradish-powered mustard. The french onion soup consisted of canned broth and a negligible pinch of cold shredded cheese dropped into the bowl before serving. The sides were forgettable. The best things here? 蔜he iced tea, and pickles! The lines become a jumbled mess pretty quickly, and there's a parking lot with some metered street parking as well. The restaurant is located on the fringe of L.A.'s chinatown, and walking distance to Olivera St.

I'm probably the last person in LA to try Philippe's, but I can't say it was worth the wait. I got the lamb (w/ swiss) everyone seems to be raving about with a side of macaroni salad and a cup of chili. Total $14. The double dipped lamb was... just okay. It was a little salty, a little gamey, and a little dry. I should've done a single dip to see the difference. The macaroni salad was meh and too much for one person but chili was okay. Forgot to try the picked egg though. I should've gone to Yang Chow instead.

I have to admit...I didn't love Philippe's. 蔍 feel like a traitor to LA. 蔅ut I just have had better French Dip Sandwiches, regardless of whether this is the original or not. The bun is dipped for you, so you don't get to control how soggy your sandwich is (which is how it ends up--soggy, instead of lightly moistened). 蔜he meat has almost no flavor, a cold slice of cheese is slapped on and there isn't any horseradish to put on them. 蔜here is spicy mustard, which is very hot (I loved it), but it absolutely masked any of the beef flavor, no matter how little you put on. 蔍 did do a few tiny dabs on the lamb sandwich and the mustard complimented it MUCH better without masking the flavor. The one thing I did love? 蔜he coleslaw. 蔍t's nothing special, and is even a little runny, but tastes just exactly the way I like it. We got there around 8pm on a Thursday night, so the Chinatown area was dead and a little ghetto creepy, but inside the restaurant my boyfriend kept talking about how "cozy" it felt. Like I said, I hate to admit it, but I think I prefer other French Dips.....

I think this is one of those places in LA that just sort of rests on its laurels and its "old school" appeal. The decor is cool, there is something to be said for eating in a place that has been open since the dawn of human civilization. Or at least since people still had use for multiple phone booths in a restaurant. But, the french dip and potato salad I got were just ok, nothing special. In my opinion, this place is cool to go check out once if you've never been, but there is nothing enticing enough for me to make a second visit.

She explained everything in a very friendly tone and didn't roll her eyes when we told her how excited we were to try their food and how we saw them on TV.

Another LA Institution. 蔛o many reviews so I will keep this short and sweet.

Order some cole slaw and a bowl a chili and get dipping. �They have about six beers on tap, mostly microbrews. �Water is self serve on the dining room floor. Don't sit on the benches unless you absolutely have to since you will be bumped a few times at least by the people standing in line. �Look for a line that is moving quick before choosing a line to stand in. 蔜here are definitely faster moving attendants working the line. 3pm seems to be the time when the lunch crowd leaves and it empties out until around 5pm when the early dinner people show up. 蔖lan accordingly if you don't like the crowd. 蔉or example, do not go after a Laker or Dodger game lets out. �Enjoy the atmosphere, the friendly workers, the great crowd, and of course, the epic food experience.

WOW. This place has like 2000+ reviews?!?! Parking was good, the lines are disorienting. Don't get me wrong, the lamb sandwiches were orgasmic, I wasn't a fan of their famous hot mustard because I just felt it was just Yellow Wasabi.... the problem I knocked off 2 stars? While ordering with my dad who has broken english, the lady at the counter rolled her eyes.... and I've never gotten pissed off while ordering anything.... and this was a first. I think her name was Evangelina. She had glasses, try not to get in line with this one. The b!tch had a nasty attitude before we were ordering and what she did to my dad threw me off the deep-end. So I yelled back at her my order and gave her a death look.... which ended up quieting her ass down and not saying one more word the whole time. My dad wanted to leave a tip and I told him no. When she finished the sandwiches (which were only 3 by the way) she dropped them on the counter, smiled, and said 'Sorry' and when she gave us our change she walked away super fast. I don't care how busy it is, this was the poorest excuse of customer service I've ever had. If it weren't for the super awesome sandwich I ate this place would have gotten one star. This place needs to fire some idiots that work here.

What a complete and utter disappointment. We were downtown on other business and decided to hit up Phillipe's after hearing all the raves and seeing it featured on the Food Network. Are you kidding me? We had the beef dip and ham sandwich. The meat was tender but there was very little of it and was tasteless and no au jus on the side? What kind of a french dip is that? It's not. Our friend's ham sandwich was supposed to have mayo on it but they forgot so she decided to put the mustard on it. Nice move Phillipe's. Putting 5 alarm mustard on the table with no warning? I also had the cream spinach that was decent and the pickled egg was average. I will give them props on the beer and wine selections. Silver Oak for $12 a glass? I didn't get any but I wonder how many ounces they pour. At that price I am thinking 4 ounces. Anyone know? I may go back and try the lamb sandwich but will not go out of my way. They get two stars for the wine, beer and parking.

I've been waiting a LONG time to try Philippe's sandwiches! 蔍t's touted as having the best French dipped sandwiches around. �蔜his place has been around for 110+ years and won the James Beard Award in 1999. 蔍 believe it was also featured on the Man Vs Food TV show. We arrived at 7:00 pm on a Wednesday night and were greeted by three lines of about 10 people each. 蔜here were about 5-6 ladies working feverishly behind the counters - taking orders, making sandwiches, and running around to make the customers happy! ��I ordered the French dipped sandwich made of Lamb ($7.00). �(Note: There are choices of beef, pork, lamb, turkey, and one other kind of meat). 蔠hen I ordered it, the server reached for an entire roasted leg of lamb and started to skillfully cut off 5-6 slices of lamb. �The lamb was cooked until it was well-done. 蔄fter weighing the meat and plopping it back down on the bottom of the sandwich, she took her knife and stuck the top half of the bread and dipped it in the special juice sauce. �蔜he lamb sandwich was pretty good! 蔋owever, to me, it lacked salt and flavoring. 蔜his was easily fixed by adding the Philippe hot mustard sauce that sits on every table. �The mustard sauce is spicy and hot - like they added both yellow mustard and horseradish to ordinary mustard. �Grade: 蔅. I also ordered a side of cole slaw - which was perhaps my favorite cole slaw that I've eatn in So. Cal. 蔍t was milky, creamy, and sweet. �Delish! 蔊rade: 蔄+ I couldn't resist ordering a side of beef chili with onions and cheddar cheese. 蔜he cup of the chili came with 4 saltine crackers. �It was fun to eat, but it didn't wow me. 蔊rade: 蔆+. I asked the server for a side order of yellow banana-peppers for my sandwich. 蔍t added a nice vinegar flavor and a kick to the traditionally boring sandwich. 蔔ice touch! What I liked most about this place is the environment and friendly staff. �First, everyone either sits on picnic tables and wooden stools or on bar-table sized tables with high chairs. 蔜here is saw dust everywhere on the floor - it was like eating in a barn. The staff were super outstanding! 蔐adies at the counter knew their stuff and the bus-staff were very friendly and quick. 蔍 especially appreciated the fact that the manager was walking the floor and addressed the "non-patrons" that decided to come into the restaurant to just hang out. Food: 蔅 Service: 蔄- Atmosphere: 蔄

I love this place, one of the best restaurants in LA. The environment is very relaxed, i think I remember it having sawdust on the floor - one of those places, haha. But I went after the lunch craze. The beef dip is amazing SERIOUSLY. The sides are good as well, the tapioca pudding was delicious, well if you're a tapioca freak like me. The servers were mostly all older woman with that kind of blunt attitude, very endearing :)

This was my first time eating here, but I have had people bring me sandwiches from here before. The ordering system is strange, and the cashiers are a bit... not rude, but not friendly, whatever you call that. The Beef dip sandwich is awesome, especially double dipped with their spicy mustard (I think they make their own). The lemonade is perfect, not too sweet and under a buck. I liked the potato salad, but I wish the had bigger sandwiches because one isn't enough, but 2 is too much. It's right next to chinatown and easy to get too... Next time I'm gonna try the Turkey dip sandwich, my buddy said it was really good and he is probably the second most picky eater that I know.

Hands down the best french dip sandwhich ever! Beef, lamb, pork, turkey, don't matter. They are all good. 蔜he meats are always tender and flavorful. 蔜he bread is always freshly baked. The au jus is perfect. 蔜he mustard is extremely hot, but damn good. All the sides are also good and a great compliment to the sandwhich. 蔍 live in the bay area, but always try and go here when I am in the LA area.

Been going here for years! �They have a variety of foods to choose from, but don't stray far from the french dip sammies! 蔄ll you need to know is "DOUBLE DIPPED" and order more than one iced tea or lemonade if that's your drink (the glasses are small and there are no refills). Use the hot mustard on the table! 蔍 despise mustard but this is more like horseradish than anything (not much mustard flavor). 蔍t's hot, it will clear your sinuses, and it's a must. 蔣ou can always buy a jar for $4.25 and take some home with you. Couple things to take note of: The lines can be long, but they have several and are worth the wait! Cash only (they do have an ATM). Beware peak lunch time hours and this place does get PACKED. Many people aren't aware but there are some hidden tables to the left of the counters through a doorway under the stairs.

The first thing I remember when we walked in was all the people in line staring at us (which was towards the entrance) looking famished for some double dipped sandwiches and had no more than a 1 inch gap between the person in front of them to make sure there was no line cutting. Totally understandable. Yes, the line was scary. A little claustrophobic being sandwiched between hungry people. 30 minute wait to order- but worth every minute. We ordered the beef double dipped sandwich, their homemade special chili, one lemonade, and a custard cup for dessert. The beef double dipped sandwich was make-your-mouth-water-all-over-again delicious. The chili was loaded with ground beef and beans and was quite tasty. The lemonade was the perfect beverage to go with our meal. The custard cup was just okay for me, but my fiance really enjoyed it. Remember to bring some green dinero - Cash only. Overall, a wonderful first visit! Must come back again. You can also walk up the hill and explore the little stores in Chinatown.

I can't believe I haven't reviewed this place yet. I have memories of coming here as a kid, and as a teenager. I've seen it on food network and every time I think of a beef dip this place comes to mind. I visited here last week after not having been in at least 10 years because I lived up north, and when I moved down I just never found myself in the area. Well, when pondering where to grab a bite to eat before the Lakers game that wouldn't be a cookie cutter restaurant (like Chilis or Yard House) this place came to mind. At 6 pm I'd half expected it to be packed with business men drinking beers and enjoying a happy hours. I found a parking spot right in front of the building and walked into a completely empty place. So glad there wasn't a line, yet somehow it still took 30 minutes to get my order in and food and drink. As I turned around with tray in hand (double dipped beef and a beer) I'd noticed that a line had formed and the place began to fill up. I also noticed most of the people were wearing purple or Lakers gear. Turns out I wasn't the only one with the idea. The sandwich was delicious, I poured on the hot mustard. 蔜he meat wasn't dry (as I see some other reviews say it was), but I did get it double dipped. They had some pies that looked really good, and I plan on getting some next time. Remember they take cash only, but if you do forget don't fret, there's an ATM.

There is the debate of Philippes vs Coles. 蔍 vote for Philippes. 蔜he sandwiches are outstanding whether it be the beef, lamb or turkey. 蔜he sides are good. 蔍 just love this old school, communal eating atmosphere. 蔇irt cheap drinks and the mustard is nice and spicy. 蔇on't get me wrong, I like Coles also. 蔅ut Coles is better for Varnish in the back. 蔅ut with regards to the sandwiches, I prefer Philippes because the sandwiches are so basic. Great place to go before a Dodger game or late at night. 蔐ong lines, but there are several lines that move quickly. PS - I had the benefit of the nickel tour because this is a client. 蔋owever, I would feel the same after watching the tour of the kitchen on TV.

Would have got a 4 star if it wasn't for a long wait in a scorching sun. 蔠e waited about 30 min. 蔖retty decent price for a sandwich. The parking was across the street but it took another 10min to find a spot. 蔠e ordered roast beef sandwich, pork sandwich , Chilli and banana cream pie. �The chili was perfect as it contained no beans. 蔈ven though the sandwich was delicious, I thought it was a little overrated. �Don't forget, it's cash only. 蔜he outside parking lot was a hassle as it was full we had to wait for a spot to open up. �蔒aybe because it was the peak time.

How can you turn down an original french dip sandwich??? The answer is: you can't. 蔖hilippe's has always been a favorite amongst the old timers, but still remains with with the new emerging foodies of our time. Always get the lamb french dip, 2 pickled eggs, a beer, and if I'm feeling frisky I'll get a pice of pie or cake:) �When you walk in, the lines may seem to much to handle, but they are pros at fast servicing and know had to feed their guests in a timely manner. 蔛plit up into two floors, you have the option of grabbing lunch with all the hustle and bustle of all the hungry customers or you can head on up stairs for a more intimate affair. 蔇on't get me wrong, Philippe's didn't make their name because of the fabulous ambience and decor so don't get your hopes up. 蔋owever, your stomach won't be disappointed after filling it with the one of the best French dips around and don't forget dousing on the spicy mustard! 蔕ne complaint though: they won't give you au jus on the side! Asked every single time and they just won't do it....

The French Dip. I will drive from the valley to this place just for a sandwich. 蔍t's that good. It's a fun place to eat and the unique service is fun to experience. For those not in the know: Walk in and you will see a ton of people seemingly just standing around between long rows of tables. 蔜hese are the lines. Get in one and wait. When you get to the counter a server will take your order and make your food on the spot. Ask for your sandwich (lamb, beef, pork, or chicken, the lamb is an extra dollar but really good) single, double or wet; Single, is one half of the roll dipped in jus. Double is both halves dipped. Wet is the entire sandwich plunged into the jus. Go with wet, as you cannot get a side of jus for later dipping (lame). Get yourself a side of macaroni salad or coleslaw. And do yourself a favor a try a cup of chili no beans. 蔍t's amazing. You can also order your drinks, they have decent iced tea, and good lemonade. Coffee is $.09, no joke. 蔇ecaf is something like $.67. You will then be told your total, given a small tray set on top of the counter, put your cash here. 蔔O CREDIT CARDS or DEBIT. Your tray will be taken and change returned. You will then be given a large tray with all your food. Take that and sit at the communal long tables, or go up the stairs and there are smaller more private tables. Free water is available self-serve just around the corner from the counter on the right. They also serve pie, which I have not tried, but looks delicious. Great place, fun and right in the beginning of Chinatown.

Since childhood the French Dip has always been one of my favorites sandwiches, so of course it has been my wish to try the place that it all started. On a whim my boyfriend and I ended up driving to LA for the day. Normally I like to plan and prepare in advance before I go anywhere so I was totally unprepared when we ended up in LA. When I asked myself what can we get in LA that is truly special a few things came to mind: Pinks Hot Dogs, Roscoe's Chicken and Waffles, or something from "The Best Thing I Ever Ate" 蔮ut none of those seemed appealing at the moment. Then a light bulb went off in my head, Philippe's. The place that gave us all the gift of the French Dip, a place where where culinary history happened. A place that any French Dip lover should visit at least once in their life. The beef french dip is a very good, though it is not t best that I have ever had. I got mine with Swiss cheese which complemented the flavor of the meat. The meat itself was very tender and perfectly sliced. Even though I had my sandwich double dipped there were a few bites that were on the dry side. The bites that were saturated with Au jus were just perfect though. Potato salad was very yummy. The potatoes were chopped very small and had a nice ratio of eggs mixed into them. Prices were very reasonable, and you can't beat 75 cents for a glass of lemonade. Even the kids selling lemonade on the corner don't sell it that cheap, if you can find them anymore. Philippe's is worth checking out and a must if you love french dips. A place where there is history and good food that won't leave you with an empty pocket. LA has a lot of great food so don't settle on something less than legend- wait for it -dary.

Having heard lots of great things about this place, I was super excited! Sadly, I was not impressed. They have their own parking lot, so parking wasn't too difficult. However, the lines were super long! I think I waited for about 40 minutes, slow service. I ordered a double dipped Lamb sandwich with swiss cheese. The meat was dry and after half, I just couldn't eat anymore. i wish I had gotten claw slaw to go along with it. Might have made it better. I also ordered their pineapple pie (b/c they ran out of banana cream) and it was mostly jelly. Overall, wasn't worth the wait, but at least the price was reasonable.

Superb! I always heard of this place but waited till now to come here. Why did I wait so damn long?? This is definitely very old school LA, and the crowd--and what a large crowd it was--totally represented LA in its mass diversity. The lines were really long and every single one of them reached the back wall, BUT they moved quite fast. We got the pork and beef french dips, the lemonade, and a slice of boysenberry pie. The pork was absolutely delicious, the bread had just enough crunch, and the meat was nice and juicy. The beef was kind of dry, but maybe that was just a fluke on that day. The pie was also very good... buttery and probably absolutely bad for you. There's plenty of space upstairs so make sure you head up and check out the various rooms for seating. Definitely an LA favorite and will be back for more!

Woohoo for french dip & the great prices! My vote goes out to Philippe restaurant as far as flavors go & prices as opposed to coles. I get the beef dip, with the potatoe salad on the side. I'm not a big fan of potato salad, but I like the flavor combination. I get a lemonade on the side & since my recent of age celebration from now on I'll be ordering a beer! The brownies for dessert are heaven sent. I'm so glad my significant other took me to this place! It's one of my favorite restaurants! The lines are long but they have plenty of seating. They also only accept Cash.

The thought of bright purple pickled boiled eggs, cole slaw, and potato salad already has my mouth watering!! How is it that I barely visited this place for the first time having lived so close to L.A.?! I'm prettyyyy embarrassed. hahah. now back to the review! Parking: There's street parking and there's also a lot just across the street from philippes! Decor: This place has been here for a long time and other than the usual maintenance, Philipes looks like it stood it's grounds against time. There aren't any fancy tables or chairs, or anything so overly polished that you would think they get the kind of business that they do. Instead, there are a lot of old school photos that brings you back in time. There are wooden high-chair bar stools, booths, and long tables with chairs lined up on both sides. Service: Everyone that was behind the counter wore the ol'school philippe's uniform with a genuine smile. It was like watching one big family work together. (: Food: Given it was my first time, my friend ordered for the both of us (: +_Pickled boiled eggs: These babies were BRiGHT purple! Which isn't the most appetizing color but I'm glad I tried them. We thinkk maybe they were pickled along with some beets, perhaps? +_Cole slaw: If you're getting philippe's you best get their cole slaw! They go hand in hand with any of their french dipped sandwiches!! :D +_Potato salad: These reminded me of picnics and bbqs, they weren't overly dressed or had too much of one ingredient. yummmmmm. TRY IT!! +_French dipped beef sandwich: YUMMMMMM. What made this flavorful, delicious sandwich even better had to be Philippe's famous HOT MUSTARD! Be warned though, their hot mustard is almost like horse redish! One squirt to many, and you'll be squinting your face like you're giving someone the stink eye! HAHAH ... I did that a couple times :P but boyyyy does it hit the spot!! Drinks: +_lemonade: where else can you get a glass of lemonade for just .80 cents nowadays? it was good, a bit watered down and sweet for me but it was ok. Philippes is a must try. Given any lakers or dodger's game you will see this place full with people in jerseys or those team colors. (: Lunch time can be veryyyyy busy too! It's also a good place for big groups and or families :D yayy!

After having eaten multiple times at both Cole's and Philippe's, I can honestly say that the beef dip sandwich at Philippe's is better. At Philippe's, the sandwich bun is not too bulky and the meat is quite lean. However, what makes the sandwich better at Philippe's is the au jus. The au jus is very flavorful and makes the sandwich extremely tasty. While the sandwiches at Cole's are not quite as good as the ones at Philippe's, the sides and drinks at Cole's are top notch and the restaurant has a great atmosphere. But for those beef French dip purists, Philippe's is the place.

I have been coming to Philippe's for several years now. The food is always consistent and delicious. The lines are always long especially during peak hours and at least 5 or 6 deep during off-peak hours. The lamb french dip is absolutely divine. For those of you who fear ordering the lamb, I assure you that the lamb is moist and does not have a hint of gaminess at all. Think of the lamb sandwich as a beefier beef sandwich. The cut of the meat is thicker as well. I prefer a single dip over a double as I find the double dip to make the sandwich too soggy. Add plenty of hot mustard, some pickled beets, and a side of potato salad and I'm a happy camper.

Anyone who knows anything about LA history and classic LA eating joints, knows about Phillippe's! The best spot to grub before a Dodger game indeed...on Opening Day this place is a tradition for me and my friends. They keep it Ol' School with wood shavings on the floor and Wooden Tables. The Turkey and Pork are my fave's but you can't go wrong with the Lamb or Beef, either way make sure you have a side of Cole Slaw because they some of the best around, maybe even better than KFC!! Simply put this is a must for anyone visiting LA, or just passing by...you won't regret it. Honorable Mention: 蔖ork, Double Dipped, with a side of Slaw and 2 Lemonades!!

After eating here years and years ago, I never wanted to have another French Dip sandwich. I hated the sandwich and the experience. When some friends decided to come in for lunch, I decided to tag along for the company. I even ate a little Chinese food first so I wouldn't be so hungry and disappointed in the food. To my surprise, I actually enjoyed my double dipped beef sandwich. The potato salad had a lot of egg and mustard, just how my grandma used to prepare it. The pickled egg didn't have as much flavor as I would have liked. The ones at Joe Jost's are much better. Even with the long line and wait, lunch was satisfying and pleasant.

*THE GENERAL INFORMATION* VEGGIE FACTOR: Possible, but not recommended KID FACTOR: OK NOISE FACTOR: OK PARKING: Two lots plus metered street parking; be prepared to circle at rush hours. =============================== *THE REVIEW* INTRO: Seventy-five years in L.A., and today's the first time in my life at Phillipe the Original! A friend's invitation was what got me there. FOOD & DRINK: Huge variety of side dishes: salads, desserts, pastries, pies, puddings, drinks, both alco and non-alco. Entire breakfasts and lunches available. But of course the big feature is the French dip. I had a beef triple dip, a kosher dill, a small bag of baked potato chips and a lemonade. First the beef dip: It's indeed tasty but not thrilling. I've had better elsewhere. The kick-ass hot mustard really helps. I ordered the triple dip, hoping the French roll would be saturated: soaked and dripping with the au jus, but it didn't happen. The halves of the roll were dipped just so as to wet their surfaces; very disappointing to me, but still tasted OK. But that carver was CHINTZY CHINTZY CHINTZY with the au jus!!! The dill pickle was one of the best I've had besides Bubbe's kosher dills. The lemonade was tasty, and the bag of Frito-Lay baked potatoes was just that. If I ever go back (not unlikely), I'll experiment with other items on the menu. SERVICE: Totally straightforward. It's mostly do-it-yourself. You get in line, tell the carver what you want, give her the cash (cash only), she puts your stuff on a tray, you go find a place to sit. AMBIANCE/ATMOSPHERE: This is the part that's fun! The whole place is dedicated to no-frills straight-ahead comfort food. Nothing fancy, it's all plain and functional both food and furniture. You sit at communal tables. I chatted with my friend. Being there is a trip: room after room both upstairs and down; it's a huge place. Many of the rooms have themes: one is dedicated to railroads, another to celebrity clowns, still another to baseball, etc. Sawdust on the floor. Long red linoleum-topped tables. Straight-backed chairs and round stools. High-backed booths. Brown paper napkins. Mustard in soft plastic squirt dispensers. Phillipe the Original -- like Pink's, like Tommy's, like the Apple Pan, like the absolutely abominable Tito's Tacos (BARF BLECHH ACHH GAG) -- is more a state of mind than anything else. It's fun to go there, fun to be there, fun to eat there. The food is good, but it doesn't particularly set your hair on fire. And that's OK. What's that? You say you've never been? Well then, take a look at this neat video of Emeril Lagasse visiting Phillipe's. You'll see Emeril talking to the owner, and you'll go in the kitchen to see how they cook the beef and the au jus, and how they make that hot mustard. (Be sure to play the video at highest p setting and full screen!) Emeril chats with some customers and even talks to the mayor on Tom LaBonge's cell phone: 蔴ttp://www.youtube.com/w�蔈njoy! =============================== *THE WRAP-UP* PRICE RANGE: A bit high �-- PAYMENT: Cash only! --- RED FLAG: Parking can be iffy --- GREEN FLAG: The ambiance �-- AMBER FLAG: Don't expect "haute cuisine" --- BOTTOM LINE: Absolutely worth a trip or two!

When I was growing up, a trip to Philippe's was as routine as doing laundry or going to church. This absolutely classic Los Angeles landmark has been serving the best French dipped sandwiches for about a century, and has been a constant along the lines of maintaining quality and tradition. Very little has changed over the years in this unique cafeteria-style eatery in downtown LA. They still serve the same recipes for potato salad and cole slaw, and they still serve the same soft, crusty bread filled with slow-cooked, juicy slices of turkey, beef, lamb, or pork. Whether you half dip, or go full-monty with a double-dip, you can't go wrong. 蔠hile the beef truly shines, the lamb and turkey here are also quite tasty. �Philippe's is like a time capsule. Saw dust on the ground, memorabilia strewn throughout it's simple, bare-bones interior. Long wooden communal tables in each of their multiple dining rooms, giving you the feel of an early 20th century commissary. I love the dining rooms upstairs with wide open windows and the names of random visitors etched and tagged onto the old walls. My regular order is a beef dip with swiss (double dipped)--succulent and moist without falling apart. A side of potato salad or a bag of chips, and I'm good to go. Did I mention that this is one of the best sandwiches in LA AND it's super cheap?! A beautiful lunch for under $8! Some may argue that Cole's (also downtown) were the originators of the French dip...but after you've had Philippe's, you'll know the truth. I mean, even established Food & Travel shows have bowed down to this establishment! Notes: They have free parking in the back, but it's usually not hard to find street parking. They are also much busier during the weekends, but the wait is not too bad at all (compared to other places). Order at the counter; find a random line (there are many) and know what you want by the time you get up there. Amazingly, even bleu cheese on either beef or lamb is also scrumptious here. Oh, and they make their own hot mustard...and it is H-O-T!

I was in the area and wanted to check out this place to see what the hype is about. 蔍 got there ahead of the lunch crowd just after 11am and was fortunate enough to find a parking space in the rear lot (with about 20 stalls). 蔍 ordered the pork sandwich (single dip as I didn't want it to be soggy) and a lemonade, about $9 with tips out the door. 蔍 was the second in line so the wait was just a couple of minutes. The meat was tender and seasoned just to my taste; the bun was slightly damped with au jus to add flavor to the whole experience. 蔍 would have rated Philippe with 5 stars had the size of the sandwich been a little bigger....one sandwich (about the size of a 6-inch Subway) didn't quite do it for me. 蔍 could have had a slice of their pies to complete my meal; however, by the time I was done with the sandwich, the line was too long for me to get my desert. If you like to add some heat to the sandwich, try their amazing horseradish mustard.....it's the best. The next time I am in the neighborhood, I'll try the beef or lamb. Getting here before 11:30am is a must to avoid the crowd and challenges with parking.

My friends and I were strolling around china town feeling hungry so we decided to go to Philippe since it was only a 4 minute walk from our parking area. We went inside and the look of it caught my attention. It felt really old school walking in with the wood chips on the ground. ANYWAYS. time to talk about he food. I tried all flavors and what I found the juiciest and tastiest was the pork sandwich. it was pretty damn good i have to admit. the lemonade was okay but good enough for its price. It's a nice place to come kick it for lunch and chill with your friends if you're around the los angeles area

To be honest with everyone here, I've lived downtown for almost a year now and I just heard about Philippe's about two months ago when one of my co-workers came back from lunch waving a Philippe's t-shirt she just bought along with her dipped beef. Since I'm attracted to bright colors, the t-shirt peaked my interest about Philippe's and I planned my trip. My boy and I rolled through Chinatown on a Saturday and found a parking spot in the Philippe's parking lot - it was pure luck. The lot is behind the restaurant and it's a bit tight, but there is street parking so I wasn't too worried. The inside of the restaurant is pretty roomy but it did get crowded and tight when we had to stand in line to order. There are no instructional signs as to where you need to stand or what you need to do - I have to admit, I was lost when all I saw was a mass of people standing around - but the lines start at each of the seven to ten clerks standing behind the refrigerated display case - just pick a line and wait....wait, wait, then wait some more. We ended up waiting between thirty to forty minutes. The options are not bountiful. They have a large menu along one side of a wall but I could barely read it so I just stuck with what I knew. We ordered two double-dipped beef sandwiches, one bag of chips, and a pickle - all of this came out to about $17. The sandwich wasn't bad... it was pretty good actually but a bit on the small size. And, with the request for my sandwich being double-dipped, I was expecting the meat to be juicy, but it was a bit dry. Oh, and NO DEBIT/CREDIT cards... I hate this since I never carry cash on me. I guess paying $6.50 for a sandwich I was expecting a bit more. Don't get me wrong, the sandwich was good but for the price and the taste, I'd rather make the trip down to Buena Park and hit up Portillo's - still the best beef in So. Cal.

Philippe's is something of a historic landmark-- and they're still serving up some awesome food at decent prices after 100 years of business. On my first visit here I did find the service style confusing; there isn't a single queue like I've come to expect at most counter-service restaurants. 蔠ithin a couple of minutes, though, a regular noticed our distress and informed us that we just needed to queue up in front of any of the servers behind the counter. 蔉ive minutes later we were on our way to a old wooden table in a corner of the cavernous dining room with plates full of some of best french dips and macaroni salad I've ever had! 蔜he hot mustard on the table was excellent too, and you can't go wrong with a 65-cent iced tea or a choice of microbrews to wash it down. I will definitely have to return here for a sandwich the next time I'm in the area, and hopefully stop in for breakfast as well!

Went to Philippe's for the first time last night. I have now had Cole's and Philipe's and I would have to give the ambiance edge to Cole's. 蔆ole's has more of a speak-easy-ish vibe to it and is more of a sit down and get served restaurant. Philippe's is more of cafeteria style restaurant. 蔉or that reason, you do get your food EXTREMELY quick. 蔍 ordered, ate and was out in 10 minutes. My girlfriend did not like the fact that at Philippe's, they dip the bread in the Au Jus then make the sandwich and serve it to you. 蔍n Philippe's defense, the bread was not drenched. 蔍t was more of just the side facing the meat touched the Au Jus. 蔍 do like how Philippe's gives you the Au Jus on the side. As far as pricing, Philippe's has a slight advantage. 蔄 sandwich is $6.50 while at Cole's you are going to spend $7, however, you can get the Big for $10 or half a big and a side for $9. �If you are going to also have a drink, the atmosphere and alcohol selection is superior at Cole's. Most importantly, overall flavor, I think you are splitting hairs. 蔜he meat at both are very good. 蔄t Philippe's you needed a little salt since they did not provide the Au Jus on the side but their Spicy Mustard was delicious. I can see a strong argument for both. 蔍f I want a delicious French dip and be able to get in and out quickly then I'd go with Philippe's, if I am trying to be served and have some drinks and kick it for a bit, I'd go with Cole's.

2012 - Good Eats' New Year Resolution #1 - Will wait no more... Always wanted to try Philippe...Now is the Time! Now that I have tried, I am so sorry that I waited so long. Hubby was down right hostile at me for not showing him the way to Philippe's "Lamb & Blue Cheese French Dip" sooner. We have only been in L.A. for 16 years...ha! Also got the Pork with Swiss, single dip. I think it was perfect! Not too wet, just enough to flavor the sandwich. Of course the Hot Mustard on the table is a must with the sandwich. Pickle, Coleslaw and Potato Salad were great. It wasn't hard to resist the pickled egg and pig's feet. Did see many people enjoying these "specialty items." What we couldn't resist was the 9 cents coffee. So we got a slice of Lemon Meringue to go with it. Pie was okay. But the coffee tasted at least like a 29 cents cup of coffee! Happy New Year to the Ladies (behind the counter) in uniform! Good work and we'll be back.

I'll just add my two cents here... The roast beef sandwich, as a whole, is delicious! 蔜he soft french roll, the au jus, the beef. 蔣es, the beef, when comsumed by itself, isn't very flavorful, but the combination of the above ingredients makes for a well prepared sandwich. �The hot mustard, to me, is like icing on the cake. 蔍 dollop so much on the sandwich that I'm practically tearing and trying to not breath in the fumes, but after a few seconds, am still able to crack a smile and say "ohhhh.... that's good stuff!".

I'd say the age of this location and how they have held on to the tradition is very impressive. It is not a fancy place, it is not particularly nice. It really made me feel like I could have been back in the 20's getting my one meal for the day. The line was a long (Sunday night, right during dinner time), the diners were very typical downtown LA, the service was prompt and friendly enough, the sandwich itself was pretty tasty but not amazing. I would not go out of my way for that french dip (unfortunately). I wish there had of been something that really stood out about the experience except for the age of the establishment. Servers were in cute little old-school outfits, that added a neat little flair. Did they used to have the dipping au jus as a side and nixed that at some point? I have always had a french dip with the au jus on the side. Meat is pre-dipped so the bread is a bit soggy but gets cool by the time you are eating it. All in all it was an okay experience, the wait and lack of "wow" with the sandwich what I was hoping would be a real foodie experience. Salads were HUGE, I was expecting a side salad and got pretty much an entire head of romain chopped up with really yummy croutons and dressing.

Debated between trying this place and Cole's, have never been to either. Picked here because they have a parking lot and couldn't find parking near Coles. Phillipes is also in a better area of downtown. When you first walkin, the lines look like total chaos, but they move quickly. Tried a single dip beef sandwich, cole slaw, potato salad, a giant pickle, tea and lemonade. Was a fan of everything except the potato salad. It was just too sweet, which is a really weird description for potato salad, I know. Was worried about finding seating until I found out there was a bunch more seating upstairs. Next time I visit, I want to try some of their donuts. I'm a donut fanatic and they looked delicious. I still plan to try Coles to compare. Cash only, which I hate.

I'm not going to lie, I had never heard of this place until this past Sunday. Then again, I'm not up in LA very often. Apparently it was featured in Man Vs. Food, but I guess I missed that episode. I was in LA with some friends to go to Santee Alley, and we stopped here for lunch. I ordered a lamb sandwich, single dipped, with bleu cheese, potato salad, and a brownie. �The lamb sandwich was delicious. That plus the horseradish mustard they have on the tables is boss. The potato salad was ok, nothing to write home about. The brownie was nice and thick. A+++++ WOULD EAT HERE AGAIN Seriously, though, it was pretty great.

An LA institution that gives you the feel of an old school diner. The place to eat before going to a Dodger game. I had the lamb double dip which was great but the best thing was the mustard that has a flavor and heat that cannot be replicated. The prices are cheap on some thing moderate on others and the sandwiches themselves are not as big as the seem in photos but if your in LA this is a must. Make sure you take home a bottle of the mustard. The only reason why they don't get the 5th star is because I did not think the meat itself was all that flavorful.

So I don't know if it was the hype for this place or what, but I was kind of disappointed when I got the chance to go here. 蔏eep in mind that I don't live super close to Phillipe's so I've only been here once, but first impressions are hard to get past. �The worst part was the line. 蔠e got there at 10:20, right when breakfast was ending. 蔅ad idea. 蔠e wanted lunch and breakfast takes forever to cook so we waited in line for 35 minutes even though there were only 5 people in front of us! 蔙idiculous! �The way they have the ordering system set up is so stupid. 蔍t's basically a 4-line free for all where you have to pick a line and hope it goes fast and then when you order they fill your order right then and there no matter how long it takes while everybody else waits. 蔄lso, the whole one cashier idea was dumb...slows everything down. 蔄s you can tell, the wait basically killed it for me because once I got the food, it was good, but nothing life-altering making the wait seem soooo not worth it. I got the french dip sandwich with beef which was good, but needed more juice and more meat. 蔒y boyfriend got the french dip with lamb which was better cause it had more meat, but kind of chewy. 蔄lso, we got double dipped but it still wasn't enough juice. 蔍t would've been nice to have some on the side. 蔛ome of the pie and the other goodies like pie and potato salad up in the front display looked really good and maybe that would change my opinion later, but as for now, this place gets 2 stars, maybe 2.5. 蔋onestly, maybe I just had a bad experience but I was not nearly as impressed as I thought I would be. 蔍f you have nothing better to do for about at least an hour than to stand in line for food, then this is your place.

Does it really matter what review I write on a place with nearly 2500 reviews? 蔔ot really. 蔅ut Ill give it a go anyway. Arrived around 7:30. 蔕ld style deli with sawdust/wood chippings on the floor. 蔆ool. 蔄t this point I realize just how spoiled I am in this day and age. 蔒ultiple lit menu boards at the places I go. 蔛imple to find items and information given to me in scientifically proven ways to get me to what I want to order (or subversively what THEY want me to order). 蔋er it's a bit of work finding all you want to eat. 蔄 HUUUUGE BOARD on one side of the deli has everything they have. 蔛crew it, 蔍ll just point at the stuff in the large and overly empty deli cases.

There is not one reviewer than can say enough about this place. Phillippe The Original has the best dipped sandwiches around. We all have our favorites and I would my top two are the turkey with american cheese, and the roast beef with blue cheese. Both are to die for! And of course you need plenty of their hot mustard to get the full effect and taste! FYI, the mustard is very strong and should be taste tested first before you squirt a bunch on your sandwich. Note, they do not take credit card or debit cards. Cash only. They do have an ATM machine on site if you need cash. Yes, the coffee is 9 cents a cup and its good tasting. Of the sides that they offer my favorite is the macaroni salad, and in a close second place is the potato salad. Also, if you want an interesting, natural desert go for the baked apple. You will love it. Its one of those old style deli places were you go to the counter tell the lady what you want and she bring it to the counter. Its very fresh tasting food. You will become addicted to the taste of their sandwiches. I swear you are going to need a love one to drag you the door to stop from not ordering another one. The ambiance of Philippe is very casual, friendly and nice. They have plenty of old pictures of what LA used to look like throughout the years. Parking can be an issue as their private lot is small and always filled. There is street parking available which you have to pay the city of LA for. Go once and you will be a customer for life.

I had to come to this place after it was featured on Anthony Bourdain's show, "The Layover." The lamb dipped sandwiches were DELICIOUS.

Don't be discourage by the long lines because it moves fairly quick.

So, maybe I just don't think french dip is that great or maybe it was just Phillipe's. I don't know because this is the only french dip I've ever had. But I was very unimpressed. I got my beef sandwich double dipped like everyone on yelp said to, but eh. It was honestly just okay. Just a beef sandwich, nothing special. Not good or bad. The clam chowder was also just okay. 蔍 was also confused by their ordering system because the lines were a bit disorganized. At least the parking was convenient.

On my day off (Friday) my wife and I decided to try the breakfast menu at Philippe's as a change of pace from the usual BF joints. After parking in the free lot across the street, we entered the building and behold! no noisy crowds and a real quiet din that was a real change of pace from the many times we have been here for lunch or early dinner! We ordered the eggs and corned beef hash and eggs and bacon. My hash tasted very familiar like the stuff that came out of a can; eggs were perfectly done as was the cottage potatoes; the over easy eggs were also perfectly done and the thick slices of bacon were done right. We found a booth which is a rare treat as these booths are always filled during lunch time. Service was quick and our order taker was very friendly with a smile. The coffee was excellent and free refills. They also offer salsa on the side that came in little glass syrup pitchers. Nice touch. We will be back for breakfast again.

Wasn't my first time at Philippe's but the food still has the magic in every bite. Order for two, to-go: One Lamb, one pork, and one beef sandwich; Side of cole slaw and potato salad; Piece of coffee cake. 蔐unch for two came out to about $25. 蔔ot too shabby. �I started out with the pork sandwich, and it was tasty. 蔒ake sure not to throw on too much of that horseradish because it is SPICY! 蔜hat zing can clear up any stuffy sinus in a second. 蔜he pork was juicy and tender, but because we to-go'd the food, double dipped was not ordered. 蔍f you're eating at Philippe's, I'd say to double dip. 蔒akes the sandwiches that much juicier. 蔜he slaw went very well with the sandwiches. 蔍t's simple and not too sweet. 蔍 liked the pork, liked the bite of beef I had, but I am so glad I saved the lamb for last. 蔜hat lamb sandwich is tops for me. 蔍t's tender and juicy. 蔍t's a little pricier than the others, but for good reason. 蔄lso, the coffee cake is good! 蔍'm not into pastries or baked goods, but their coffee was not overly sweet, not overly crumbly, but overly delicious. Quick notes: 1- Cash only! 2- Free parking. 3- Lines are long. Scope out the shortest ones (usually towards the ends). 4- Seating is available upstairs as well. 5- Coffee 10 cents. Lemonade 75. Iced tea 65. 蔍t's like we're in the 50's.

We tried this place a few months back after hearing great praise from a friend, but were honestly not that impressed.

This place is about as good as it gets. Especially if you are looking for an authentic LA spot. They claim to have invented the famous French Dip sandwhich and I have not been to a place that does it better. Recently I also discovered that they serve breakfast on a trip to catch up with a bunch of old high school classmates. I had the 2 eggs & cornbeef hash meal there with a coffee and a side of biscuits. It came to just under $8. It's also only 9 cents for a cup of coffee there. The corn beef was very nicely done, delicious and there was a good amount of it on the plate. The eggs were nicely done and tasty. The biscuits were super flaky and light and absolutely delicious. My biggest discovery is not that Phillipe's is a good restaurant to go to but that it offers a great breakfast for very inexpensive. Also the lines which are normally ridiculous for lunch are very small for breakfast.

I've only been to Philippe's once, and only recently, which I think is a shame. 蔍 think there are remnants here of an old, famous Los Angeles eatery, but a lot of that seems to have gotten lost. Their specialty is the french dip, which comes in various meats. 蔜he sandwich, for $6, is smaller than expected. 蔜he ambience is almost non-existent ... the building is getting older and less attractive. 蔛ervice is friendly, but more interested in getting you served and onto the next customer. 蔖arking is easy (adjacent private lot). If you crave a french dip and are in the area, check them out. 蔕therwise, stay in your part of town. 蔣ou can probably find an equally good French Dip at Denny's.

I've been coming to Phillppe since I was a kid, and we just love it! 蔖arking is free while you dine there and cash only, but they have an ATM inside, 蕄lace has been open since 1908. Place is very unique and old-fashion style, their know for their double-dipped sandwiches w/a variety of different types of meat. 蔜hey still sell a cup of coffee for $0.09 cents, which is pretty cool in this economy we are in. Other things they serve, are side dishes such as cole slaw, potato salad, soup of the day, a variety of desserts and other variety of options. The sandwich by itself is roughly about $6 so w/a full menu depending on what u get for 1 person your pretty much averaging about $11 per person. This place is about a block and half from Olivera street and across the street is the union station, and very close to chinatown. 蔜he majority of the time you will find long lines, and have to search for a table, b/c it usually is always quite crowd. 蔖lace is very casual, not elegant, but its recorded as an landmark in LA since the place has been open for 103 years old. 蔍f you havent been here, you need to come at least once and give it a try it, they're food is delicious! :-)

I had the lamb and my wife had the beef sandwich. 蔅oth are a very bland simple sandwich and are nothing to think twice about. 蔜his place is nothing more than an information cascade. An information cascade occurs when people observe the actions of others and then make the same choice that the others have made, independently of their own private information signals. Because it is usually sensible to do what other people are doing, the phenomenon is assumed to be the result of rational choice. Nevertheless, information cascades can sometimes lead to arbitrary or even erroneous decisions.

Long lines. Scarce parking. Communal seating. Tourists. Schizophrenic customers in line in front of you who want to start a dialogue about the shelf life of their spicy mustard. Who cares? When the food is amazing, none of that matters. I had a double roast beef double dipped sandwich, macaroni salad, lemonade and a pickle. Double dipped still wasn't very juicy, so next time I'm going to order it "wet." Coffee is $.09! I can see why Phillipes has been around for 100 years, and why it has been featured on Food Network. I hope it is around another 100 years, and I hope I live to 100 so I can eat many more French Dip sandwiches. Yum!

Alright the Philippe's french dip was pretty good, and so were the pickles and mustard. But above all: 蔲reaky, funky, pulp fiction-y... It's all about the atmosphere and the characters in this place.

The line was long but prompt when we came one Saturday morning. The floor was covered in sawdust, eliciting a nostalgic feeling. It helps that they have roasted/baked whole green tomatoes and pig's feet at the counter where you order. Their original French-dipped sandwich was really really good. The bread was soft on the inside and has a slight soft shell on the outside. The juice has the right amount of saltiness and beefiness. I don't think this sandwich would work if the bread wasn't fresh or if I took this sandwich to go.

I came here twice but I had forgotten how it tasted like the first time I was there. Horrible, right!? When I was in LA with a few friends last weekend, we came here for lunch. The lines were insanely long with 948163949263 people in each line! The upstairs dining area feels like an ex-insane asylum and to freak out my friends some more, there's a door labeled "ward room," ahhh! It's an entirely different environment from downstairs so if you want a vibrant and enjoyable one, find a table downstairs! Now to the French dip sandwich! I ordered the pork and oh my goodness. It was SO tender and soft! It just MELTS in my mouth! I want another sandwich just thinking about it right now! For a sandwich like this, it is definitely worth the wait!

I've been wanting to go here forever! Wow. What's not to like? There's a free lot across the street, inside it's like time stood still - and that includes the prices. I had the beef french dip, not realizing you could have it dipped extra! I have an excuse to go back now. The coleslaw is tangy and lightly dressed, and the pickles are tasty (but no match for the ones we make at home, alas). I can't wait to go back and try the other things on their menu!

I would give it 3.5 stars if I could. I hate this saying but, "It is, what it is." It's decent, I liked the pickled egg, with my french dip. I don't like that they don't give you the au jus sauce on the side, instead they dip it for you. The potato salad was pretty tasty, but I haven't found myself hurrying back here for more like I do with Langers Deli. I will probably come back because it's on the way home from work, and it's a novelty spot.

Made another impromptu visit to Philippe's after some disc golf up at Chavez Ridge in Elysian Park with the guys. Relatively empty for a Sunday afternoon around 1PM. Took about 5 minutes to hit the counter to order my food. Got a beef sandwich (double-dipped), pickled egg (super freakin good), pickle, lemonade and a slice of pecan pie (honestly some of the best pecan pie I've ever had). $14 bucks. Yeah...I can see why this place has been here for over 100 years. So good!

Delicious sandwiches. I went her for my friends birthday celebration. Lines were LONNGG, but well worth the wait. I got the beef sandwich (6.50), 蕇ide of mac salad (1.50) , iced tea (65 cents). The sandwich was single dipped, the beef was very lean, not fatty whatsoever. The french roll was nice and crusty on the outside, middle was a bit soggy, but hey it's a FRENCH DIPPED SANDWICH...what are you expecting? If you like horseradish, than you must add a little of Phillipe's hot mustard, mmmm:) . Has a nice kick to it, so be careful, don't squeeze a bunch of it on your sandwich. The mac salad, was pretty simple, mac/ mayo/ relish. Simple, but good. The iced tea, nice and strong, unsweetened, exactly the way I like it, but it's in a really small cup..than again it is only 65 cents aha. Cheap, and good food. Gotta admit my friends and I were really confused on the system of how the restaurant worked out considering it's hella crowded. In the end everything's pretty straightforward, go order what you want, pay and that it's. Don't know what you want? Look around what everyone else might be ordering, I didn't even know they had chili or soup till I saw other people order it. Menu is really hard to see once it's crowded, so figure out what you want to eat before you come is my advice to you. Parking's free though, so no need for a long walk!

This review was in my draft folder for quite a while. When I started it, there were just over 1500 reviews. Now there are over 2300 reviews. The odds of anyone reading this specific review - pretty slim. But that's ok. What more can be said about this place? �read some of the 2371 reviews - that's a pretty common opening sentiment). I've been coming here for over 20 years are nothing has changed in all that time. 蔵 mean that in the best possible way. The hot mustard is hot. 蔜he pig's feet are the best in LA. The double dipped beef is considered paltry by some, but the taste is unquestionably great. I guess that is the only warning to really have - the portions aren't as huge as people have come to expect nowadays. I'd put this review at a 4 for the food, add half a star for the history and ambiance and add another half star for the awesome pickled pig's feet.

I've been wanting to try this place since I first heard about it. I finally got the chance last night right before the Lakers game. I was worried that it might be packed even though it was about 5:30. It was completely empty. Service was terribly slow though (it took about 20 minutes). I ordered 2 beers and 2 beef sandwiches double dipped. I loaded it up with their hot mustard, and was surprised at how good it was. I'd anticipated the meat to be dry, but it wasn't. One sandwich wasn't enough food for me, but two would have been too much. I think next time I'd get a side or some pie. It got more 蔮usy at it got closer to game time, but still nothing like I'd imagine it to be during the day's lunch time. Since I'm always going to court down the street I definitely plan on stopping by here again to grab some lunch.

Decor: I love the throwback idea. The decor is original and unique. I loved the telephone booths, sawdust, tables, and ordering system. Sandwich: The french dip was less than desirable.. I wish I could give this review more stars because of the restaurant's longevity as a Los Angeles historic landmark but the food was just not good!! The sandwich tasted just mehh, the potato salad was un-inspiring and the lemonade too sweet. The beef had no flavor and the bread tasted like that of a Ralph's bakery. There was nothing special about the sandwich. $6 for sandwich - not so much. $6 for the decor & one time experience - decent.

So this may well be a LA institution but I just found it okay like so many LA institutions. I ordered the house special - beef French dip sandwich and topped it off with the house spicy mustard. The first two bites of my sandwich were good and the wasabi-like kick of the mustard added a nice bite - unfortunately the rest of my sandwich become a soggy mess soon there after. If they were just willing to give me au jus on the side instead of letting the bread sop it all up before I could finish my sandwich it would be much more satisfying.

I hate to admit it, but I'm not a fan of their sandwiches. The whole dipped sandwich thing just doesn't appeal to me. Even with a double dip, I still find the sandwiches to be a bit dry. I've heard you can ask for the au jus on the side, but they've denied me every time I've asked for it and I've yet to see anyone get it on the side. Maybe they only do it for regulars? If I had to get a sandwich, I'd go with the lamb as it is the best of the bunch. So why 4 stars despite my low opinion of their famous French dip? I really like just about everything else they serve. The sides are OK. Good deli style salads, but nothing mind-blowing. The soup, on the other hand, is delicious. The last few times I've gotten just soup and either a side or some bread. The chili is always good, but I'll opt for the tomato bisque when that is the soup of the day. If the soup Nazi worked here I'd take his abuse to get some more of their soup. The desserts are also very good. The soup keeps me coming back whenever I'm in the area, although I avoid it on weekends as it is packed.

I love French dip sandwiches... Especially when they are made with rare juicy prime rib and super rich au jus... The sandwich at Phillipe is not to be confused with what I just described. Maybe this is one of those LA landmarks, and now that I've tried it I can move on to bigger and better things... The lines are long and I found the beef dip sandwich to be very average... It was edible but not especially flavorful. The hot mustard though is definitely worth a try though if you do come here... It is very strong! All in all my experience was ok, but I'm not sure I will be back any time too soon.

Been coming here FOR YEARS, seriously. My dad worked for Amtrak so we walked to Phillipe's from Union Station just about everyday. 蔍 wasn't as adventurous back then and always just stuck to my roast beef with either Swiss cheese or on those good days, Blue cheese. 蔣ou must like Blue Cheese to order it though, they will slab a thick, hearty block of it onto your sandwich. �The turkey is good, juicy and moist, and the LAMB, oh the LAMB sandwich is to die for. 蔍 usually get it with American cheese or Jack cheese, and the Lamb is perfect. 蔛omething I never would have got when I was a kid but glad I will eat it now. 蔍 get my sandwich double dipped, occasionally "wet" but that gets it too soaked and I like a little bread to not be drenched. �Put some of their hot mustard on it, but just a little because it is hot and that is a good, cheap sandwich. 蔕h, and the world's BEST coleslaw as well, finish it with a custard...OMG. Can't forget about Phillipe's lemonade, cheap and delicious.

(Dined 4/07/12 SA @ 9pm): Philippe, you Frenchie, you've done Los Angeles proud with your simply food, and to this day, your restaurant is a cherished memory and tie to our fair city's glorious past. After an early evening of drinking at the 4th Annual L.A. Beer Fest held this year on the Paramount Studios lot, my friends and I decided to return to an old favorite we used to haunt in our earlier years, Philippe The Original Restaurant...or simply Philippe's for short; we can claim it as our own! Truly a Los Angeles institution all visitors and residents should always visit time and time again! There was a sparkle in our eyes when the word "Philippe" was spoken in reference to where we should grab a bite and chill for a bit. As we pulled into the parking lot, a giddiness came over us and the anticipation built-up within. We shared many great times here together in one formed group or other (we were missing one friend to completely round out the posse), but the restaurant itself was also a friend, and we were happy to see her again. Even at this time of night, the place was still half full (place closes at 10pm), a testament to the experience one can have and the heritage she has within the city of Angels. We each walked through the sawdust on the floor, stepped up to our respective carvers, and place our orders. I ordered the French-dipped pork sandwich ($6.50), a bowl of cream of broccoli soup ($4.70), a side of macaroni salad ($1.25), and a glass of lemonade ($0.75 - no refills). We each got our food and sat down at the nearest available wooden table and bench family-style, so feel free to introduce yourself to your dining neighbor,and if you're really outgoing ask if you can have a bite of their food! The charm of Philippe's was that the food is simple and prepared in a homestyle way. Don't expect fancy froufrou stuff here; just damn good food. My pork sandwich au jus on a soft and flaky baked french roll with a squirt of hot mustard was simplicity at its best! Coupled with the health serving of macaroni salad and a perfect tart-to-sweet lemonade...c'est magnifique! The bowl of cream of broccoli could have been a separate meal on its own. Mmm...I love me some cream of broccoli! ��The service was very good. My carver, an older jovial woman named Judy whom I believe has been working here for many years, was diligent, affable, and seemed to be enjoying herself. There was no wait staff; however, there was a bus staff who would come by and remove any empty paper plates we had. Parking is ample as they have their own lot, but should you visit during the daytime, expect to grab street parking in the surrounding area unless you've got luck on your side! Save yourself the hassle and park a block or so in either direction and walk it. Overall, another treasure of the bygone era of Los Angeles charm and the simple life can be found here, and any longtime self-respecting Angeleno should patronize this place in order to connect oneself to the heritage of the city. I found complete value at Philippe The Original Restaurant, as noted by the prices I quoted above (total bill was around $13 before tip), but you get filled-up on a good meal and if you're lucky a conversation with a complete stranger. They are famous for their French-dipped sandwiches (and that really is the main reason people pack this place), but you must order some of the sides complete the meal. The atmosphere was totally casual and great for the entire family. Don't you dare come in here looking pretentious. Come in here as if were going to a baseball game (a great to come after a Dodgers game, or even enjoy the game here!) or a picnic. My only knock is that they take only cash; thus, they don't take my credit card of choice...AMEX! For this reason, it pains me to not be able to give them five stars; sorry.

.., came here after the Dodger's spanked the Pirates 15-1 this past Sunday. The lines were crazy as expected. At one point the power even shut down when we were just 2 people away from ordering. Everyone boo'd & my stomach just growled. The power came back on & everyone cheered, it was pretty funny. My gf Diane & I went w/ her family, so they scored on seats while Diane & I got the food. I went w/ my usual turkey sandwich. I know the majority of people come here for the beef, but I love their lamb & turkey. Turkey especially! Just the way it tastes w/ that hot mustard, hot damn it's good. Usually any other time I'd chow down on their other meats, but when I want that hot mustard, when I really wanna taste that hot mustard in its finest form, I go w/ the turkey. But that's just my tastebud's opinion. The sandwiches went up a $1 from the last time we been here. Now all their sandwiches are $6, $7 for the lamb I believe. It's still cheap though, I could easily blow a $20 just to have more for the road. The potato salad was delicious, w/ their tasty slice of apple pie to finish you off before sending you off into a food coma, the patrons @ Philippe's that night slept well my friends. Check it out!

The guy I was dating took me here and I think he just hyped it up so much that I ended up being disappointed with what I got. I got the beef dipped sandwich and just found it too soggy for my liking. Meat was good and I did like the flavoring, I just prefer that my bread isn't that soggy. Maybe I'm just a hater because I'm not a huge fan of dipped sandwiches.

I am deeply in love with Philippe's. I know one other place claims to be also the "original French Dip sandwich place" (Cole's to be exact) but for me Philippe is the one and only "French Dip" place :) I love the roast beef sandwich, pickle and lemonade. I always order my sandwich "double dip" or "wet" but the server doesn't always give you "wet" even if you ask for it. (Wet basically means dips in the au juice 3 times) Sure, this place is always crowded with people and it means you need to wait for a while before you can order yours, but it is so worth the waiting! It also only takes cash and that's kind of inconvenient for some people, but for me I like it that way. I like that this place keeps its tradition in an old-fashioned way! So, next time you are in this area, try the sandwich at Philippe's! Go easy on the mustard! It is so spicy, but oh so tasty!

Came here yesterday to get a quick glance at all the buzz reviews this place is getting. I got a beef dip for 2go. I was originally thinking of getting 2, but after seeing the price, I decided to hold off at one, and take a bite out of it 1st before deciding if its worth another buy. I took a bite and frankly wasn't that impressed. The meat was flavorful but nothing very impressive. The dip sandwich is rather small for a price that steep (and it doesn't come with anything else). So, i left without getting a 2nd one. Also, if you're gonna buy it for 2go, you should eat it soon! The beef dip's buns got REAL soggy very quickly! Kinda nasty if you ask me...... they should have gave u the sauce in a separate container. . environment wise, I have to agree with some of the other yelpers. Jail, school cafeteria...etc.... my initial impression was that this place is like a barn. You got all kinds of ppl in there (young/old, most of them sloppy/poor looking. I didn't really see anyone dressed very well. Seems like a popular place with local old people?). The place is suppose to be like an old style bar environment, but it looks so dated and old- in a bad way. Place just feels sloppy and poorly decorated. The bathroom smells as well. . the entrance has a small shop, which looks very odd and out of place to me. And yes, this place is cash only, which is dumb. We live in the modern world, restaurants should learn to take credit cards! (esp considering how crowded this place gets, making it a "cash only" is just plain dumb, no wonder the lines get so long!). . on my way to bathroom, i notice a small counter where u can get water?...the machine for that looks kinda old and dirty. Also, when I ordered, i notice at the display counter, there's like this pig knuckle in the container, looks like its been there for a while- it just looks a bit gross, and i really wonder how sanitary the place is. The only thing good about this place is they manage to keep the restaurant cool despite the large dinning area (and tons of ppl as well), so yah...they did crank up the AC, which is good. (but i find there's still somehow bugs flying around ppl when I'm in line for ordering). . I know they have a lot of other stuffs to try, but given my impression of the poor decor, 蕋he high price of the beef dip, and the mediocre taste..... i have to say.... I'm not exactly on the edge of my seat to come back soon.

Finally got a chance to check this place out! Standing in one of several long lines to order food reminded me immediately of Katz's Deli in NY, so the feelings of excitement were definitely pouring in. After a 20 minute wait, I ordered their classic french dipped beef sandwich and a side of Chili and macaroni salad. All said, everything was about 10 bucks...good value! Unfortunately, the food doesn't blow you away quite like you were expecting. The beef sandwich was rather bland, and they won't offer you the Au Jus like at any other place with dips (The Hat). The chili was great, and the sides were good too. It's too bad that the sandwich itself was rather average, but I'm glad I got to finally experience the food and environment here at Philippe! Remember it's CASH ONLY!

Hmm..... love the idea of this place.... and some of the food items are indeed delish... but overall... it's a "go only once in a blue moon" type of restaurant.... - like the mustard and the spiciness of it - not a fan of the pies - too heavy - the sandwiches are OK... but not great. Could do better with the seasoning and the bread just OK. all in all..... if no for the history and its icon status.... this place would be "just OK"

I've been coming here since I was a tiny little girl. Every time we would visit our relatives in LA or go to Disneyland, this place was a must have. Even during my college years, I would continue coming here for a quick bite and also found that it was great for hangovers too... just saying ;) The French-dipped sandwiches are still the best ever. The horseradish sauce tastes great, but sometimes it's hard not to put too much on for watery eyes. Watch out for that. The style and efficiency works well with how this spot is set-up, especially when it's crowded.

This is hands down one of my favorite places to eat! When I'm in LA I do go out of the way to pick up some food from here. Especially if its before a Dodger game! This place will be PACKED pre-game, so be prepared to wait in a long line and have CASH. Inside is an old fashion deli style set up with tables lined up with some sawdust on the floor. This place hats a LOT of history in it. Its been here since the early 1900's and isnt going anywhere anytime soon. If you have never been here you MUST try the Double Dipped Beef Sandwich. Its a staple of this restaurant and it puts this place on the map! I think they are about $6 a sandwich now and they are a decent size. The coleslaw is also pretty good, the Chili is damn good as well! You can still get a glad of lemonade for 35 cents I think too and coffee is like 15 cents lol. Its also just a block away from Olviera street so you can easily walk over before or after and check that place out!

First thing's first, the lines are LONG. Be patient once you get in (if you go during rush hour), the wait is worth it. The Roast Beef Dipped Sandwich was pretty delicious. Yummy enough for Kristina to eat even though she isn't a big fan of roast beef. We also ordered the potato salad and a banana cream pie. Both was scrumptious. We actually wanted to order another slice of pie but the line was still ridiculously long after we ate. Another plus was the CHEAP Lemonade and Ice Tea. Both were $0.75!!!! Take note they this place is CASH ONLY! They do have an ATM inside, but just to save the convenience fee, bring cash beforehand. It's a great place to try but the wait might shy some people away. Just wait. It's gooooodd!!!

Went here with a friend after watching Man v. Food. Got myself the most expensive sandwich on the menu double dipped with an apple pie and chocolate brownie. I was not super-satisfied with this place. Went in on a Friday during lunch hours. Restaurant was packed with people waiting in line. Best part of the whole meal would be their hot mustard! The biggest downfall for this restaurant would be the price. Very pricey for a sandwich. However, I wouldn't mind stopping by again sometime.

When I think of the 'classic LA experience', a stop here is required. The reviews say it all, I can't add anything new. When I go, I get a beef dip (double dip), bowl of chili (no beans), a pickle, a lemonade, and a Dr. Pepper. The sandwich is smallish, a tad pricey, but very very good. 蔜he chili is true chili and some of the best I've ever had. 蔜he house made pickle is just right, the lemonade pure and simple. 蔍 get the Dr. Pepper to wash it all down since the lemonade is tiny.

I felt like I had been transported n time, back to the days of the Gold Rush. I suddenly felt like a miner, shoving some tasteless piece of meat with a soggy (also tasteless) piece of stale bread down my throat, so I could go back to the mine and fetch for more gold. I couldn't finish the sandwich, if you can call it that. Might be a tourist attraction, but taste wise... What a rip off!!! This food should not even be served for free. The potato salad...

I went to Philippe's after seeing it on "The Best Thing I Ever Ate". After hearing Wolfgang Pucks's praises of this Los Angeles institution, I was very excited about this place.Well after I had the roast beef sandwich, double dipped in Au Jus , and with extra horse radish mustard, I have to say that it was just A-OK. It wasn't the best sandwich I ever had, but it was good. I found that the Au Jus was a tad too salty. Will I return? Yes. Will drive there out of my way to get the sandwich? Hecks no.

Cash only. Got the beef sandwich single dip, but make sure you get the sandwiches double dipped though, a lot better and juicier! Definitely, have to add the hot mustard to your sandwich makes things more interesting as you bite into your simple sandwich, it tastes like horseradish with a hit of wasabi. �Can't forget to get the potato salad and coleslaw, then your meal is complete! The decor inside very old school. 蔠ood shavings on the floor and you got your self seating after you order. It's just a simple french dip sandwich, don't expect anything greater. 蔅ut I am a fan! Won't go everyday, but its something I'll stop by to have lunch or dinner if I'm in the area and craving french dip sandwiches.

Bf wanted to try this place and I need to go to Chinatown, so we stopped by on Sat. We arrived about 11:30am and both parking lots were pretty full and there were lines for every servers at the counter. 蔅ut since, it's only 11:30am, the line were not too bad (two three people waiting at each line). We tried lamb, pork, and beef. We also had a coffee, lemonade and a beer. Oh, and a baked apple. Costed us about $32. Bf was the one who wanted the lamb the most, but end up not eating it because it has a wet dog smell. I did not smell it and it did not have the gamey taste of lamb, so I ended up finished the lamb. The pork was also tender, but the beef was just so so. Bf said the meat was a bit salty but I think it's fine. The baked apple was yummy, but both of us think the sugary water could be more exciting, like some spices or wine in it. You could order your coffee black or with cream, and add your sugar at the table. It's just regular coffee like the one you get at IHOP 蕂r Dennny's, nothing fancy and not super water down like some said. If you are a coffee snob or need to wake up, go get Starbucks instead. :p �Since I had the baked apple, I cannot comment on the lemonade as I think I did not get the real taste of it.

I don't live in L.A., but after my recent visit, I admit to kind of liking it. 蔍ronically, I feel the same about French dip sandwiches. 蔍 don't ever order them, they're not a part of my rolladex of ordered foods (yeah, bitches, I just said rolladex, I was born in 85), but after taking down a Philippe's beef French dip, I can genuinely say I kind of liked it. �The boyfriend, who lives in nearby Dana Point, and has really pretty eyes, had raved about this place for years. 蔋e had lived in L.A. on and off growing up (child of divorce, you know), and had these fond memories of piling into the perpetually crowded space before Dodgers games and watching his estranged Father order double dipped sandwiches and devour them amongst the lunch lady, assembly line cooks and chalk-scribbled brick walls. 蔜he place is charming, I don't see how any reviewer can dispute that, though I realize charm and sentimentality can only get you so far. 蔄fter all, you need good food to have a good experience. I walked up the flight of stairs to find a good table on the second floor only to find that the second floor was totally empty in addition to being bright and cozy. 蔠hile I waited for him to return I walked along the brick walls reading the scribbles from past customers and current fans. 蔍 like the idea of allowing your customers to leave something behind, a hand print or name, something vulgar or ridiculous, someone loves someone. 蔖erhaps the concept isn't original, the same as the peanut shells along the floor, but that doesn't make it any less inviting or interesting. �He returned with trays of food, a sandwich for each of us, a bag of potato chips and two Blue Moons. 蔜he bread was flaky and tasty, not soggy, and the meat tasted fresh and tender, not over or under salted, just right for our hangover lunch. 蔍 tasted the hot mustard even though I hate hot mustard as I believe it tastes like a chemical of sorts. 蔛omething you're not supposed to eat like perfume or shit that goes in the motor in your car. 蔍 gagged. I get that Philippe's is sort of a novelty place, there are a lot of people that seemingly hate it because of what it is, because it's FAMOUS and perhaps the food is not as good as a dozen other places in L.A. 蔕ne must remember though that a place often doesn't blow up simply because of the food and it's not HORRIBLE for a joint to be known for its longevity, rich history and loyal fans. ��Personally, I enjoyed the crowded ambiance and simple beef sandwich on a Sunday. 蔜he beef, bread and cold beer pulled my hangover instantly and the boyfriend with pretty eyes was practically giddy scarfing down his lunch and telling me all about his childhood days at Philippe's.

The first time i went, I had ordered my meal to-go (French Dipped Beef with Swiss Cheese- single dipped, Chili, Cole slaw, and Potato salad) and immediately regretted it. Never order to go unless it's a short trip. I rushed through 30 min of traffic to watch a Heat finals game on TV. In my defense as a Laker fan, I was only watching the Heat game because my LeBron loving friend bought me lunch at Philippe's. But I digress. The sandwich didn't travel well through traffic, but the chili, cole slaw, and potato salad surprisingly did. All were pretty tasty and made up for what the sandwich lacked. The second time I went, I immediately ate my sandwich (same order as before). And OMG eating it fresh made a difference. The sandwich + the hot mustard = PERFECTION. The sides were as good as I remembered- Cole slaw: as close to homemade as it gets- perfectly seasoned and the cabbage was not soggy. Chili: they offer a beanless chili and WOW- that alone makes a trip out here worth it. Potato Salad: also very good. Since I was eating there this time, I ordered an Arnold Palmer and the lemonade they used to make it is incredibly refreshing. 4 stars because despite how delicious the food is- getting it was a hassle. The lines are disorganized and long and I was thankful my friend showed me the ropes the 1st time around. The menu is to the far right, so take a glance at that if you want more than just a sandwich. Finding an seat is also a chore during peak hours- so either come when it's dead or get ready to be aggressive over a table.

2,333 Yelp reviews so they get one extra star. However, go here knowing that you are paying for 'bragging rights to say that you ate here', and don't expect much more. 蔄 landmark place going strong based on being a landmark place that TV shows love to film at, I guess. Saturday afternoon review. Turkey sandwich with Swiss cheese, double dipped and still dry. 蔔ever tasted the cheese or meat. 蔄dded the hot mustard to get some flavor. French dip, double dipped, and still lacking flavor. 蔜he hot mustard must be served only to mask the blandness of the sandwich. Coleslaw that wasn't dry. 蔔o mustard required. 蔜asty. Potato salad that wasn't as good as envisioned. Iced tea, the "$.79 special". 蔛mall glass, no refills. Chocolate cream pie, best part of the lunch. 蔜hick chocolate cream topped with mega whipped cream. The line expert behind us that was upset because he said we weren't standing in line properly. 蔐et's see: 蔜oes and nose pointed toward the lady that works behind the counter. 蔣ep, sounds like we were standing in line just proper enough, so thanks for butting in to our conversation, you Philippe shirt wearing regular know-it-all! 蔍 am sure the group ahead of us from Oregon also loved your little tirade. 蔊od knows they sure turned around enough wanting to know who gave you the power of Line King.

There is no place in LA that makes me feel more like I am a part of the city than Philippe. Sitting a communal tables, standing in line, the din, the confusion, the tradition it all makes up one unique and yet vaguely familiar experience. I'm not going to rehash what over 2,000 reviewers have already said, but I'd just like to add the following. 1. Explore the place. Far too many people sit in the same place. Go upstairs- maybe leave your name for your kids to find. 2. The lamb dip is the best and the pies are good. 3. The mustard. 4. The very very best thing about Philippe. Bring foil or wax paper and cargo pants, 蔮uy two sandwiches, wrap those dips (single dip or it will be too soggy) and stick them in the pockets of your pants. Attend dodger game and eat those sandwiches instead of Dodger dogs. You will feel so wise and smart. Maybe wait until McCourt has sold the team- but try it for sure.

I came here while on vacation and could not wait to try the french dip. Sadly, I had to wait in line for almost 40 minutes at about 1pm on a Monday..boo!! I swear I had the slowest woman in the world helping with my line...the other lines were moving a bit faster, but not by much. I ordered the beef french dip, double dipped, and a cup of tomato bisque. My sandwich was good, but no way near as good as others I have had. The soup was tasty, but after waiting in line soooooo long I was not happy. I also had lemonade for only 79 cents, what a bargain right? wrong !! There are no refills AND it is served in a very small glass. I ended up getting 2 glasses to avoid having to get back in line. I tried my husband's turkey dip and it was fantastic, way better than the beef. Their chili isn't too bad either. And you must try their spicy mustard, it is fabulous! Please use sparingly at first, my husband looked like he was crying 蔭fter he doused his sandwich with it. I would recommend coming during the week, around 2-3pm to avoid the really long lines. FYI : This place is CASH ONLY...there is an ATM inside.

Thank you Yelpers for your insight on trying new menu items in old established restaurants. I've been eating french-dip sandwiches at Philippe's since I was a kid growing up in East LA in the 60's. My dad would bring them home from work and he had been eating there since he was a kid in the 30's. Anyways, on my last trip to LA to visit him, we stopped by on the way from LAX and checking Yelp, I read the many praises about their coleslaw & banana cream pie which I've never tried. Wow, pretty darn good, esp the slaw. No room for the highly rated chili between the slaw, pie & 2 french dip sandwiches (!), but definitely on my radar for the next trip out west.

Definitely lived up to its reputation! Cash only. Make sure you get the sandwiches double dipped! You can ask for extra dipping sauce. The mustard is extra spicy!! Like horseradish/wasabi spicy! First time I ever had mustard like that! Chili was pretty good too, but the sandwich was the key thing! It was so good that I highly debated whether to go back and order another one after being stuffed. My mouth just watered just thinking of the sandwich again. Drool..

UHHHHHHHH....What? I paid 6 bucks for a sandwich that I can make for $1 at home? Two pieces of soggy bread with two slices of beef? Ummmmm. Ok. It didn't even taste good. It was very salty. I am NOT jumping on this bandwagon. I honestly think that most people give this place a good rating because they are following the crowd. Maybe this place was once good, I wouldn't know because I just came here for the first time last Monday. Is it a good value? Definitely not. It may appeal to different people's tastes, but I cannot imagine anybody giving this place anything over 4 stars. I mean, 6 bucks? Overkill! I'd rather have a 5 dollar foot long from subway. I'll give the extra buck to a hobo who hopefully wont try to save up to spend it on this place. The macaroni salad was okay, and so was the lemonade. I hope no one is offended. Philippe's just isn't my thing.

Another must see LA Institution. �The first time you visit this place it will instantly transport you back to the 1930's. 蔜he decor and furnishings, all from the mid turn of the century, it's as if time itself has stood still, even the wall clock is caged to prevent it from escaping into the modern world. 蔠hen you walk through the door, you'll notice the sawdust on the floor, the bench type seating and the multiple lines formed at the counter. 蔍t's a Brooklyn style cafeteria which is now extinct and can't even be found in Brooklyn any more. 蔄 time more reminiscent of the Depression Era, located right here in Downtown LA. Reality finally chimes in around the noon hour when hoards of starving patrons and tourist coming off of sightseeing tour buses, pour into this LA Landmark trying to get the attention of the waitress's working the counter. 蔜he fight for seating is another reality. 蔈verybody must fend for themselves, finally you'll give in and sit on any open stool lining one of the many bench tables crowded with ravenous customers. 蔣ou'll find yourself rubbing elbows with a perfect stranger, making conversation with them and sharing the home made horseradish mustard. 蔜he seating arrangement forces you be social, there is no choice because the quarters are tight. �The French Dipped Sandwiches is this place's claim to fame. 蔜hey profess to be the originators but there are three other institutions that have staked this claim. 蔎ohnnie's and Petrillo's both located in Culver City and Cole's in Downtown LA. 蔜he fight is on going and continues to this day. �The sandwiches and the other faire are decent enough, I mean, how much can you praise cafeteria food? 蔜he Double Dipped Roast Beef is good, it's simply a wad of meat in between two halved French Rolls, dipped in the drippings from the meat or auju. 蔄lthough, the prices have kept up with todays inflation, the cost for a Cup O'Joe is still a thin dime and surprisingly good. 蔍 remember as a lad when the coffee was only a nickel. 蔄bout ten years ago they were forced to doubled the price, it even made the local news. �A dime for coffee? 蔠ho could afford it anymore? 蔠hat a travesty! �The coffee is brewed from Farmer's Bros. 蔍t comes in an oversized tin can and I am sure Philippe's takes a beating on every cup they sell. 蔅ut it's not the coffee they are trying to sell, it's Nostalgia. Times is Tough! 蔄nd Brother can you spare a dime?

I was watching Man vs food: Los angeles edition. They mentioned this place for being the birthplace of the french dipped sandwich. And they have been opened for over 100 years. How can I not give this place a try?! Pros: - The french dip in beef & lamb impressed me the most! I got all 4 different types (beef, chicken, lamb, and ham). It was sooo good! - Make sure you get extra aju on the side! - Friendly people & workers - Amazing desserts Cons: - Super long lines - Long wait - Parking can be hectic - The place is sooo crowded that finding a seat can be hard - Cash only I love this place! I want to give it 5 stars but the location and the wait just makes it go down to 4 stars. However, what do you expect for a place in downtown...near china town!!! I love the french dips here! I can say it was the best I ever had! I gotta go back and try out the rest of their menu now!

LIVES UP TO HYPE! As soon as you walk in your hit with a wave of oldschoolness. The floors are covered in woodchips (if someone knows why some bars/places are like this PLEASE let me know ^_^). 蔄nyway, lines are pretty long during prime lunch time hour, but they had like 12 cash registers, each working super fast, so it wasnt a wait at all. Lets be real, dont you hate those places with like 40 cash registers but only 2 are open??!! (cough* Walmart cough) Anyway, this place is cash only so bring some with you, or be prepared to get charged a $3 service fee from one of the many ATMs they have on site. Onwards ho to the food review! I ordered the beef sandwich (GET THIS B*T&* DOUBLE DIPPED!!!) soooo good. It was literally like a tsunami of flavor goodness, tsunamiing in my mouth. The macaroni salad was pretty good too, nothing special hurr, but the lemonade was bomb! Maybe cuz its was like 98 degrees outside, and it came in a lil glass for like $.75. Either way it was super refreshing! Overall the meal cost me like $10, but way worth it. I wish i lived closer to here...DEF worth a visit!

Personally, I liked the run-down atmosphere and the double-dipped sandwiches.

This place is a guaranteed good... given you get the right things :) The Lamb Dip is my first choice... The Beef Dip second.... I particularly like the lamb because they pull out this lamb leg and cut the meat right off the bone... it's super tender and not overly lamby or lamby at all in my opinion... cheese is optional but I always opt YES... and the spicy mustard... BOOM! 蔖ut it all together... LOVE in your mouth! Beef is great also, I don't think it's as tender as the lamb but it's still very tender... I've also had the Pork, as I'm a huge fan of pork... tho I found it to be the dryer of the 3. 蔒aybe if they switched it up and offered a Pork Belly Dip... Oooooooh.... NOM! They also have a variety of sides and desserts for you to try, decent... So things to remember... 1. They usually dip the face of the bread for you, so by default they will not serve with a side of dip as you might imagine... When ordering, you can order it '...Dip' meaning they dip one side of the bread or '...Double Dip' meaning both sides of the bread will be dipped. I've asked for dip on the side before and have gotten mixed responses... I don't see why they would have a problem with this but certain waitresses have had a problem with this... so it's a gamble I guess... 2. Go for the Spicy Mustard! :) You and your friends will have a nice cry together but in the end, it will bring you closer HA! Ambience is super old school, picnic table casual... don't be afraid to share or offer to share... it's metro friendly and super chill

Single or double dip? Doesn't matter, it won't help the dryness and blandness of the meats. (OK, this review took me over a year in writing since I have been procrastinating for a long time. Yes, I'm behind on my reviews, but enough about me.) Now back to this place: I give it props for being in business for a hundred something years and for supporting the community, but that's about the nicest thing I'll say about this establishment. We've all seen the TV shows where they hype up a establishment and make it something like it was the best thing on earth since slice bread. My experience here was similar to Pink's Hot Dog: Disappointed and Underwhelmed. Wow, they talked about the juiciness of the different cuts of meats and the ever popular single dip or double dip in au jus. What you have is a soggy sandwich that's lacking both in flavor and substance. No, it didn't live up to the hype for me. *insert "Don't Believe The Hype" soundtrack here by Public Enemy* In case you're wondering, we had the Pastrami and Lamb. No amount of seasoning can save their meats with how awfully dry they were. It was tough to chew and the only thing I was begging for after eating them was some dental floss. Their sandwiches can't stand a fighting chance against Ike's Place, Little Lucca's and even Tommy's Joynt. Hey, at least I can cross out another list on my bucket list.

I'm sure my review amongst the 2000+ adds nothing here, but still worth a little chime. 蔖hilippe's is one of those neat little iconic places that you rarely find in southern california. 蔙eminds me somewhat of Katz Deli in NYC, but not as clean or cool, however, it has it's own charm and appeal. 蔄ll I had was the roast beef double dipped. 蔍t was indeed a pretty good sandwich. 蔍 don't remember the price, but it was pretty fair. 蔍 would say I hadn't had a proper french dip sandwich until I ate it here! 蔍 would like to go back to try some of the other meats, but it would have to be at an opportune time, when in downtown LA, non lunch hours. 蔍 went there at 4pm on a Saturday, not a terrible crowd and plenty of free parking.

I'm always looking for a good sandwich. This place fits the bill. Choice of beef, pork, lamb, ham, or turkey. I tried the roast pork and was not disappointed. The meat was juicy, the bread was just right, but the best part was the 9-cent cup of coffee. The best 9-cent cup of coffee I've ever had! Great ambiance, that this place is located in the middle of Chinatown. The place is popular, and the line was long during the weekday lunchtime. I'll definitely be back to try the other sandwiches, and the 9-cent cup o' coffee!

I've heard so many great things about this place from friends...so today, hunnie took me here so I can try it...He's been here before and told me it was good... I was expecting to love this place but sadly, I was disappointed....first impression as I walked in is the feeling of walking into a pit stop joint on the way to vegas...the line wasn't too long...we waited about 10-15 mins to order our food...if you're hungry (like I was) this is good bc they hand you your food as you order it...don't have to wait too long to receive for your food...only a few mins... * chicken tortilla soup- it was ok...I've had better...I had to add salt to it *chill- had a few bites of hunnie's chilli...nothing special * beef sandwich- I think it was supposed to be dipped in au jus sauce but mine didn't taste like it was..some parts of.the bread was hard and dry...beef was also dry..I even added the chilli to it..no luck....I only ate half...and let me remind you that I was hungry and the sandwich itself is not that big =/.. * the decor- 蕎as like...an old school cafeteria diner kinda feeling...there are shreds of some short on the floor...I believe it's suppose to go with the theme but made it seem messy like they didn't sweep the floor for a few days... * service- the workers were dressed in diner outfits...cute...I like places that have unique uniforms like that...tho the girl that took our order didn't smile once or even greet us as we walked up to her register....after she told us the total...hunnie put the cash on the counter and she just left it there (as she was doing god knows what) and after she was done she set a cash plate on the counter and said "there" as in instructing us to place the money on there o_O...whatever...at least she wasn't rude.... 2 sodas, 1 small soup, 1 chilli, and 2 beef sandwichs for 25 bucks...do I think it's worth it?? not so much... overall, I didn't have a hateful experience where I would never come here again...I's probably come here and give them a 2nd try one of these days but I know I wouldn't be the first to suggest this place if we ever try to decide where to eat when in LA

My husband saw this on some show so of course we had to try it. We were really excited to come here, but disappointed by the food. We had one beef with provolone and one lamb. I LOVE lamb, but this lamb was too chewy, gamey and still rather flavorless. The beef was the best though nothing special. We ate quickly and left so it was no more than the equivalent of a fast food stop, if we ate fast food that is. Pretty disappointing. I did love the nostalgia of the place and our son enjoyed the train paraphernalia. I would not go back though, but they don't need our business. I'm sure they're always packed!

My Dad used to take me here during the summer when I would go to work with him and I've always had fond, delicious memories. I've been here a handful of times as an adult and the food isn't nearly as good as I remember and I think the sandwiches are a tad overpriced. I do love their hot mustard but thats about it. Considering the long lines and the horrible parking situation I probably won't go out of my way to eat here again. Also, last time I came I had the beef dip and the meat was fatty and had a strange after taste.

Well, what can I say. Philippe's sells Doritos. You know, for the times you've thought "You know what would pair perfectly with this french dip? Some Nacho Cheesier Doritos". The only lasting image I have of Philippe's is the woman in front of me in line, who looked like she just came from an episode of Hoarders, getting a bag of Doritos with her french dip. Now, to a person with a normal, developed palatte, that's a disgusting combination. Philippe's is not for people with normal, developed palattes. Every day, this place serves hundreds of mouth-breathing drones who will eat somewhere because it's "an LA classic", not because it's actually good. The sandwich is completely ordinary, and Philippe's dips the sandwich for you and gives you no au jus on the side, which is pretty annoying. All in an environment that makes me feel like I'm at the DMV. So come to Philippe's, get your grade D beef sandwich with no au jus on the side, ignore how bad it is and focus on how it's "historical", be impressed by stupid shit like sawdust on the floor, and have some Doritos on the side. PS: The chili literally looks like a bowl of dog shit.

Glad to make one of my last meals in Southern California at an LA Dining Legend. Philippe's makes a mean french dip sandwich. Beef sandwich - $6 Lamb sandwich - $7.50 Tomato Bisque Soup Ice tea Lamb sandwich was great. You get chunky pieces of it, and your bread is mildly soaked from the dip. The beef is outstanding, hearty and juicy. Saw someone order a tomato bisque and had to try it - totally worth it, light and flavorful. Private lot and street parking. Cash only. Came at 12:00pm on Monday and it wasn't too packed, left at 1:00pm and the place was worse than a sardine can.

Emeril Lagasse, Adam Richman, Anthony Bourdain. I'm calling all you suckas out. I don't feel like I can trust you guys more. I actually find all of them entertaining but Philippe is the epitome of overrated food. It's been featured on the Travel channel and the Food Network multiple times. But it's just not that good. You can get a much better sandwich at The Hat or Johnny's Pastrami on West Adams. I visited Philippe for the first time after living in L.A. for over 25 years, just because I was in the area. And it doesn't live up to the hype; not even close. I mean, it doesn't even look that good on television, and I was never tempted to try this place; my instincts were right. I ordered the pork, beef and turkey dipped sandwiches and the pork was the only one that stood out. Their hot mustard was good too. The turkey, predictably, was on the dry side. The beef, again predictably, was too lean. So in the future, I'll pass on the average $6 sandwiches, the laughably long lines, the sawdust covered floors, the noisy dining space, and leave Philippe to the sheep that don't know any better. A word of advice: The emperor. He's not wearing any clothes.

Located in LA's chinatown, there's a seedy vibe about this place but it ain't all that bad, or that spectacular either. For those of you who have been to Katz Deli in NYC, there's a visual similarity between the two, but the system of food purchases very different. 蔞ery visually similar less the photos on the wall as seen at katz. Here you just order to a person and a money collector next to the food server takes your cash, and, its cash only here. The place is known for their French Dipped Sandwiches which means the meat is slow cooked for a very VERY long time. 蔜he au jeaux, or juices of the meat, is used to soggify the bread and this heavenly cooked meat (turkey, pork, lamb, or beef, pick your sin) is placed in between. The quality is not bad, but it isn't something that I'd ever have to go out of the way to eat at. 蔜he mustard here, if you like hot mustard, is very good. The prices are pretty good too and the serving size reasonsable for those diet conscious. The line seems too slow and that could very well be the fault of the customers who seem a bit like zombies. Not bad but not drop dead or memorable. 蔜he overall cleanliness of this place seems questionable after your food tray is given to you. 蔜he tables, restroom, and overall ecology of this place seems like stale, rotten, scruffed out Los Angeles. Tip: Weekdays at around 6pm is a good time to eat here while the lousy LA traffic clears up.

Had what was supposed to be a quick, late lunch here around 3:30 on Saturday. We were not expecting the lines, but we dealt, and it was worth it! It did take the three of us about 30 minutes or so to get to the front of the line, order, and wait for our food. Cheap eats, cash only. They do have an ATM in here if you need to get cash. I went with a beef sandwich with swiss cheese and a pickled egg, my friend got a salad, and my other friend had cantaloupe and potato salad. My sandwich was great! Not too big, not too small. The beef was juicy, made the bread somewhat soggy, but it was toasted enough that it didn't fall apart. I liked the pickled egg too - I want to make some at home! The potato salad was awesome. If I ever return, I will get a large order of that to go!

All this hype...and what's the big deal? Salty dip. Mediocre meat. I ate two sandwiches: pork and lamb. And my mouth is full of salt, I had to order 3 iced tea, 1 pudding and two orders to mac/cheese to wash it down. The spicy mustard didn't help. This morning I woke up, I still can taste the salt. Ok, it's a landmark. Whatever. Some interesting decor. Second floor is great for big groups. That's about it. Thank you but not returning. One observation though. If the serving size indeed reflects what pple consume in the early 1900s, then yes we humans have grown bigger and evolved to consume more. Scary.

The bread was my favorite part. 蔆rispy and light. 蔜he meat was a little too dry for me. 蔜he mustard was spicy but didn't give the meat much more "juice" to help it go down. 蔄ccording to yelp, this place seemed to be winning compared to Coles, but I think I prefer Coles better. 蔣ou can actually sit down calmly and maybe have a cold drink or a guiness float. 蔣ou can dip your own sandwiches in their super soaking bread, and tie it all up with their signature spicy tangy pickle. �If you really enjoy a good beef deep, this ghetto but awesome place called Dino (its a family chain) near USC health science-mission st, is my favorite place. 蔍t's heavy on the meat but they use different types of meat which makes it super tender. 蔄lso, great mustard and pickles in the pre-dipped sandwich.

Extremely over-hyped. 蔍 tried the beef, turkey, and lamb dip ($6, $6, $7.50, respectively). 蔕f the three sandwiches, beef was the best. 蔋owever, it wasn't anything special. 蔍 also tried the mac salad (meh- noodles were too soft), potato salad (meh), cole slaw (meh- too runny, sweet, and boring), and banana cream pie (yuck - the cream had the consistency of whipped butter, bananas were brown, and the pie crust was khaki color). 蔜he only thing I enjoyed was the can of Coke Zero and maybe the bread (reminds me of cuban bread). �The ordering process is an event - chaos, really. 蔖eople form 'lines' in front of each of the 10 women behind the counter; 10 vague lines. �Lines' meander around and in between long bar height picnic tables. 蔛eating is first-come, first-serve. 蔖lates are made of recycled paper (think egg crate), menu seems overwhelming at first glance, and menu board is much too small and far and high. 蔛ervers seem very nice, but many are older and slow. 蔆ASH ONLY!!! 蔖arking is free, but, limited.

On a Thursday night like tonight, you can hear a pin drop here. No hustle, no long lines, and plenty of space to eat. With a couple of coworkers, I ventured to my second visit to try the beef sandwich and the lemonade for a cool $6.75. The sandwich wasn't piping hot, which I wish it were. On the other hand it was filled with beef and quite fatty and delicious. I washed down the soggy bread and meat with some of the watery, ice cube-filled lemonade and somehow my stomach wasn't too agitated. For the most part, I thought, it could have been better or worse. If you haven't heard of the famous Cole's/Phillipe's debate regarding the first and best french dip sandwich in town, just read below to other reviews or Google it. It's been going on for ages, and I can't help but pick Phillipe's despite their lack of fancy decor. This place screams blue collar, and has been shut down before by the health department (roach infestation in 2010). 蔔o matter, they've been given a clean bill of health, and the establishment has been open for over 100 years. Parking is ample, and I'll probably be back. Why? Because it's not that expensive, and Phililpe's got 'comfort food' written all over it.

NICOLE NGO IS NOT AMUSED! Yeah, it's historical. Yeah, it's cheap. Yeah, it's kitchy and kind of cute atmosphere. ...BUT THATS BESIDES THE POINT!!! The sandwiches are simply not that great! Double dipped was a soggy sad excuse and cover up for the dryness of the meat. Oh and the chili tasted like overly salty dog food.

When a restaurant is opened for more than 100 years, that speaks for itself. 蔍 went for the first time and was convinced that the time tested food here deserves the hype. 蔍 had beef French Dip, which was delicious. 蔍 was a bit disappointed when they would not give me extra dip. 蔍nstead, they re-dip the sandwich for me. 蔝nlike other French Dip else where, the beef here was not very salted. 蔍t tasted great with the house special mustard sauce. 蔍 tried my friend's Beef Stew and Chili which were very very good. 蔜he side dishes, including the cole slaw, marcaroni and potato salad were all very tasty and non-salty. 蔜he 20 minutes wait was reasonable. 蔍t seems that the patron of the restaurant was from all walks of life. 蔍 love the price, too. �6.50 for sandwich and $0.65 for the lemonade! �BTW, this is where French Dip was started contrary to what I thought before. 蔍 had thought French Dip was from France! :)

Philippe the Original was one of the first places I tried for lunch when I relocated from the east coast to the west coast. Upon setting foot inside, I recall being surprised and impressed that a throwback like this exists, and in fact thrives, in Los Angeles. When evaluating establishments that are an institution, I'm always careful to assess whether the food is actually good or if nostalgia is the true draw. In this case, I'm torn. On one hand, the french dip is small but recommendable. On the other hand, how impressed could I have been with my sandwich if I waited over three years between my first and second visits here? Order the french dip. Don't order the potato salad.

This review is long overdue, probably the only bright side to jury duty. 蔜hey might be a tiny bit overhyped...but still worth it. 蔆afeteria style service is cool for such great food. Plus it's a short 25 cent bus ride from any court house, but as impressive as the public transport in LA is you can take it from anywhere! Especially if you have a bike :) The French dip is amazing, I had the pork and the beef along with an apple pie and fresh lemonade, just about as good as it gets. It's super touristy, but its a great spot to hangout after a long day, they also have a pretty cool almost dorm looking upstairs that creates a less busy experience. I enjoyed it, good mix of everything.

Philippe's is definitely a legend in LA. There's a feud over whether or not this is the actual creator of the French dip sandwich. Well either way, the sandwiches here are the best. I've driven past here numerous times and always wanted to pull over and stuff my face with their amazing sandwiches. After seeing them featured on Man V. Food it made my urges even more frequent. Finally I came here for lunch with a friend of mine who is visiting from out of town. We showed up around noon on a Wednesday to find the place completely packed. I would imagine they get slammed every day around lunch time with folks driving over from their cubicles in downtown. When you walk inside the multiple lines are first thing noticeable. Pick the shortest one and chill until you finally reach the front. The huge menu is hanging on the wall to the right, but the menu really boils down to their French dips and multiple side dishes. The ordering style is pretty easy to grasp. Walk up to the counter, order your meat and cheese, then your sides and drinks, then pay. Simple. It's way easier than the ticket system like at Katz's in New York. I decided to go with the double dip Turkey sandwich with jack cheese. After I got my sandwich, we searched around for a bit while looking for a table. This gave the au jus time to soak into the bread. Once the au jus seeps into the bread, it causes each bite to be a soggy, deliciously amazing flavor bomb in your mouth. Their meats are also sliced fresh and they give nice, big slices of cheese. If you come during lunch hour, you'll be lucky to snag a table (there are tons more tables upstairs). They also have their famous mustard in squirt bottles on each table. The mustard is like a mix between horse radish and yellow mustard. I only tried a little bit of it and I can definitely see how it could become way too overpowering if spread over the entire sandwich. Philippe's is a nice place to visit every once in a while but the huge crowds and long lines will get old if you return frequently. On the way out be sure to check out their humungous selection of Philippe's souvenirs!

I have been eating Philippe's since I was a child. 蔉or the record, we say it "Phil-lee-pay's", not "Phil-leep's." In my opinion, you can't compare Philippe's French Dip to any other place, because nobody does it like them (it's kind of like the Tito's Taco thing that people don't get). I never knew until I was much older that at other places, ordering a French Dip meant you had to dip your sandwich in a little cup of juice. 蔄t Philippe's, your sammy comes pre-sogged. 蔄nd that's the way I like it! �Add in the fabulous sides, scrummy pies, and original ambience, and it's five-stars all the way! 蔠hen I am craving a French Dip, no other will do. 蔍 do mine with potato salad, 2 iced teas, and hot mustard. 蔋oly sinus burning!

Everything about Philippe the O.G. is simple. Simple Food: They have more than sandwiches, but who really cares? 蔣ou come for the French dip- a French bread roll, filled with sliced meat of your choice (beef, pork, lamb, turkey). That's it! All drenched in roasted meat juice. 蔕hhhh yesssss. (I think I just heard a vegan whimper). Be sure to go with the double dip because 2 dips are better than one. Trust. Simple Prices: Sandwiches range from $6 to $8. Add-ons will cost you. Oh and it's CASH ONLY! �ATM inside) Simple Service: 蔜here are no waiters... Just a long counter and long lines. But don't let the herds of people scare you. 蔉or every white-haired, little cafeteria lady behind the counter is a line. 蔖ick one and I promise it will move faster than you think. Place your order, wait for it, then seat yourself. 蔣ou don't even have to clean up afterwards. Simple Digs: Stepping into this big old building is like stepping into a black and white movie. There's 2 floors of dining space and a free parking lot in back for Philippe patrons off Ord Street. We got a plain beef dip and a lamb with Swiss, double dipped.... Dayam. 蔅oth were delicious, but I'd say the lamb is the better of the two. I wouldn't mind a bit more artery clogging au jus either...Next time, I may have to get it "wet"...no matter how dirty that sounds. We also got a bag of chips, dill pickles, potato salad and coleslaw. 蔄ll good. All cheap. Ignore the haters. Philippe's is simply old-fashioned and a tasty little piece of historic Los Angeles.

I've been coming here for at least 15 years to which I can recall. Place is bommmbyyyyy! While their prices have slowly been increasing over the years, I'll always get my regulars: - Pork dip sandwich (double dip if you like it wet(; ) - Side of pickles - Side of Potato Salad - Blueberry Pie - Lemonade That's all you need... well I mean, you can't forget the copious amounts of hot mustard. All mentioned above plus another sandwich and a soda will cost you $20.20. This place has been around since 1908. Need I say more?

Went here about 30 years ago, and my friends and I weren't impressed. Decided to try it again thinking perhaps I didn't remember correctly? Nah... I did, not impressed again. The food is pricey $$$ and very little meat. Meat is fatty (I like it lean) and I've had better at Lucky Boy's. So many other great places to eat if you have to go to Downtown LA. I'd pass on this one! I was just looking at the photos people have posted. Notice the pickle is as big as the sandwich? LOL

2.5 Stars. Ordered: Beef Dip The beef and the bread is good. Meat is soft and tender, not dry or chewy. Bread is soft on the inside and a nice crisp on the outside. The AuJus is very very salty which is gross. Halfway into eatting the sandwich, I started removing the drenched/soggy parts of the bread, as the salty AuJus really just killed the sandwich for me...

Wow! I need to venture over to this neck of the woods more often! Well, I guess it wouldn't be a venture over to this entire neck of the woods though, since I'll be automatically and magnetically drawn in by the Philippe tractor beam. In any case, I stopped by here after some aimless wandering around downtown on a lazy Sunday afternoon. It looked scarily crowded, but I was reassured that it would be ok and not to worry. I was a little puzzled by the tables to eat at in the same place where you line up to order, but it wasn't so crowded that I would have to see this curiosity in action. The line moved quite quickly, and we were able to order in a fairly prompt fashion. Since it was my first visit, I tried the double dipped roast beef with swiss, and also some macaroni salad and potato salad. They bring the order right up and hand it to you in a tray and you are on your own to forage for a table to sit at. I guess there's an upstairs too but I wasn't lucky enough to check it out this time around. Next time for sure! So it wasn't too hard to find a table in a nice quiet corner, where I was able to get to business. They have their hot mustard on the table, so I gave that a shot. It was similar to the hot mustard they have at chinese restaurants, pretty damn good on a roast beef sandwich I must say! The sandwiches themselves aren't too big, so this could be a good or bad thing. They definitely weren't smallish though, so I'm not complaining. The meat was cooked oh so perfectly - soft and a little bit chewy, but not too much! The bread was also perfecto! I definitely want to try some of the other meats next time - and there will definitely be a next time! The potato salad tray was just brought out when I ordered, and man was it fresh and tasty! Surely I will have more of this when I return. SInce it's more of a seat yourself type place, it wasn't the cleanest place ever, but it wasn't dirty by any means. The bathroom was so-so considering the number of people that come through this place. I heard from my cousin that the beef stew is good, definitely wanna check that out on another visit too. A pretty decent assortment of beers are on hand if you want to have a nice cold brewski with your food, what more could you ask for!!!!!!! They even have breakfast and other pie stuff, I don't know how many times I am going to have to return...ughhhhhhhhhhh Philippe the OG = WOOOOOO!!!!!!!!!!!!

The restaurant is slightly confusing, but just stand in one of the lines at the counter and order. There are picnic tables and booths available and it wasn't packed on a a weekday. Got a lamb and a beef french dip sandwich, with a side of potato salad and pea soup, and a lemonade. The sandwiches were delicious, though smaller than I expected. The potato salad was really good, but the pea soup was a little bland, as was the lemonade. Overall, the prices were very reasonable and the food was generally delicious. I would definitely come back again some time.

Philippe Original has been satisfying bellies since 1908 and that says a lot! 蔜his no muss, no fuss sandwich place has one of the best french dips (at least in So Cal). 蔣ou can get a beef, pork, lamb, ham, or turkey sandwich which are all $6 except for the lamb which happens to be my favorite ($7.50). 蔜hey also charge extra for the cheese (50 cents) but you can get it dipped as many times as you want for free! �) They also serve breakfast foods which I haven't tried so I can't vouch for that but the sides are pretty good (ie. Macaroni, Potato Salad, and Coleslaw). You should also try the hot mustard on your sandwich but be careful, it's REALLY HOT. 蔜here's a reason why they only give you a small container of that stuff! 蔜hat shit is so hot it just might make you tear up! 蔜here's no shame in that men! They have a FREE parking lot next to the restaurant and across the street so that makes things convenient. 蔜he only bad thing is its REALLY busy around lunchtime, 11am to 1pm. 蔜ry going after 1:30pm. Also it's CASH ONLY and don't forget to tip your sandwich maker! �)

Ok, I admit the food is not that good. I've had the beef stew, the pie, the pickled eggs, sampled many side dishes and of course the French dip. But I love the atmosphere of the place. The line is a bit of a mess, but part of the fun. We've always been able to find a seat even when they're crowded. It's a fun and flavorful atmosphere, and I'll keep going back and taking visitors there. But yeah, okay rating for mediocre food.

I had been wanting to come here for years but never felt like dealing with the crowds. Finally, with some relatives in town we decided to trek out there (from Silver Lake it's a ten minute drive :D ... we got lucky and got one of the coveted parking spots, though my cousins were able to find a metered spot just a block away, so not too bad. It was fully packed last Sunday before noon and we waited just about 10 minutes in line or so. The person who takes your order also makes your food so the lines appear to move pretty slow, but it isn't too bad since there are several lines. The woman who served us was pretty friendly and we got a variety of sandwiches, all delish. I ordered the pork sandwich- double dipped, and I think it was perfection. I made a last minute game changing switch to double dip from a single, and I'm really glad I did. The single dipped looked pretty dry, but the "wet" looked pretty wet. So I think the double is a good balance. I think it would be nice if they gave you a little cup of the au jus on the side, but they don't. They'll give you peppers and pickles if you ask. The mustard is on the tables and is incredible, but you only need a couple dabs! trust me! Oh and it's cash only but they have a little ATM inside. And you have to put your cash on the little tray on the counter because the person prepping your food can not touch it for sanitary reasons ... I like it! All in all, a pretty cool place with a ton of history, worth going when you're in the mood for a french dip and/or want to take tourists to something unique. Oh and when we were there they stopped everything to sing happy birthday to a cute old man who is a regular there. That warmed my heart :-)

Beef double dip = Arby's french dip half dunked in beef stock. �Hot mustard = mustard powder with too much wasabi Lemonade = bitter and artificial Coffee = tepid, vending machine brew Blueberry pie = a grocery chain pie This place wants to be like Katz's but doesn't come close. 蔜he reason why this place is cheap is because the quality of ingredients are cheap. 蔈ven with the free parking the food isn't worth my time or money.

There are about a handful of places that I have not reviewed on Yelp but have eaten at many times and Phillippe's is the prime example. I have been coming here for about 37 years since I was about 8 and have loved every visit. Today was no exception. People can tend to take a restaurant they really like for granite and truly do not realize how much a place can be so much apart of their life. Now there are some people I know that have only had the dips. Beef, lamb, turkey or pork and they don't deviate. They always order the same thing when they visit Phillippe's. Not me. I also like eating here for breakfast. The first time I did was when I served on jury duty downtown. I ordered the ham steak with with a cheese omelet. I like to order a cup of their homemade chili and plop it on top of the omelet. It's very, very good. The next time I visit and order a omelet I'm going to ask them if they can put some of their beef dip meat inside my omelet. Now that would be a hell of an omelet. Today I went for lunch and ordered a double dip beef dip, a bowl of chili, cold slaw, a slice of blue berry pie and a bottle of Coors Light. Total bill $18 but it was well worth every dollar. I've had every dip sandwich except for the lamb. My favorite is the beef with plenty of their signature hot mustard. If you have a stuffy nose this mustard will clear it right up. My dip as usual was perfect. If the sandwich is all that your here for you will need two if your really hungry but I like to mix it up with a side of chili and cold slaw. Their cold slaw is crunchy and sweet. The chile (straight chili) is really good. I like to have them add cheese and onions on top. Now this is the first time that I have order their pie. On a scale from 1 to 10 I give the blue berry pie a 6. This place is iconic and I could go on about the decor and how walking in here is like walking back in time. This is the only place in L.A. where one can get a cup of coffee for only 9� Great story: A couple of years ago I was taking the Goldline down to watch a Clipper game with my brother on New Years Eve when I started talking to a couple from Toronto, Canada. They asked me if there was a Subway sandwich in downtown. I told them don't waste your money. They had never been to California and I told them if they truly wanted to experience downtown Los Angeles go to Phillippe's. I had told them that this was the restaurant that originated the beef dip. With a smile they thanked me and I directed them to Phillippe's. If you really want to have great conversations. Buy a shirt from Phillippe's. I can't tell you how many people have come up to me with stories even in Colorado I had someone say "Oh my god I love going to that place when I'm in Los Angeles!"

Lemon meringue? hmm.. so so. 蔄nd I'm a pickle lover so I ordered it on the side as well - they are so fresh and crisp! They give you a lot of food so you wanna be ready!

I don't get it. What's so alluring/great about this place? I mean I give them credit for staying open at the same location for well over 100 years but come on, the sandwiches aren't that great. I got the beef dip and my gosh, it was flavorless. A little salt wouldn't kill you. At the end of the day, once you look past the 'mystique' of the joint, it's just an old, ghetto, oversized cafeteria. That's it. A VERY VERY VERY LOW 3 stars. Recommendation: Put some salt on that beef

Tried both the turkey and beef dipped sandwiches. The turkey is ok, it's kind of dry. I thought the beef was a little bit better. I didn't get it with any of their sides, but there were a lot to choose from... chips, pickles, coleslaw, potato salad, they even had slices of pie and carrot cake! The drinks are really affordable ($0.75 for lemonade and $.65 for iced tea i believe), but the sandwiches were $6-$7 which was a little steep in my opinion for the size. You have to try the hot mustard, it's really really good! That's what saved the sandwich in my opinion. All in all, i thought it was OK. I'll probably try something else if I'm ever in the area again.

French dipped sandwiches never really appealed to me. I thought it was disgusting dipping a sandwich into a meaty broth. I was wrong. That shit was gooooooood. I thought it was boring to just order a sandwich with just the bread and the meat, but it was goooooood. I ordered the roast beef and my friend ordered the lamb. We split our halves of the sandwich. OMg. Just get the lamb. The bread was still crunchy even though it was dipped into a broth. The meat was so juicy and tender. Delish! That is all.

Another LA legend that it's taken me forever to try. I got lucky the other day and had a work event at the California Endowment, which happens to be right across the street. I pulled into a free parking spot and headed in for some breakfast as I had some time to kill. Sadly it wasn't later in the day as I really wanted to try their famous french dip but felt pretty gross having it at 10 in the morning (though other people were definitely doing it!). Instead, I went with the breakfast combo. For a little over $7, you get two eggs, sausage or bacon, juice and pancakes or their 'famous' french toast. I can never resist anything that's labeled as famous, so I of course went with the French toast and was very pleased with my decision! The breakfast was simple but well made, and came out super fast! During breakfast time there were plenty of seats to choose from, and I was pleasantly surprised to find that they had outlets and free wifi for my laptop - Philippe is down with modern technology! It was fun to watch the characters and the regulars in the place as I enjoyed my breakfast and got some work done. And they had some private looking booths (they kind of reminded me of confessionals at church) that woul be nice if you wanted to get away a bit more. All in all it was a lovely experience and I can't wait to go back for that french dip!

I've been to this landmark establishment twice and I have to say the second time was better than the first. The lines can get pretty long during lunch/dinner, but it's not too bad, the line moves pretty quickly. I prefer the double dipped beef sandwich with Swiss over the Pork that tends to be a little more dry. When you walk inside, you can't help but think of the history this place has.

Sawdust, sandwiches and photos of old LA are a great combo. French dips = delicious, 10 cent coffee = a curious but welcome pricing oddity. Tips if you haven't been there before: the mustard is hotter than it looks, you pay by putting your cash in the little tray the cashier puts in front of you, and it's customary to tip even though this isn't a sit down restaurant.

One of the best french dip sandwiches i've ever had. Not sure why they are such "Soup Nazi's" about the Au Jus dipping sauce. They won't give you a side for dipping so ask for "Double Dipped" if you like extra or if you take it "To Go" you can take some Au Jus with you. Don't complain or there will be No Au Jus for you! The spicy mustard on the table is awesome if you like to feel the burn. THe coleslaw is also pretty tasty. The place has a cool look and feel to it that is kind of timeless and nostalgic. I think it's cash only.

YUM, the french dip and the great mustard (housemade) was delish! 蔛uch a great sandwich and great prices - lemonade was yummy and quenches your thirst after a nice wait in line. 蕋hey have banana cream pies and peach pies. 蔍 think it's a must go just for the historical side of the restaurant, it's a great little find that's been around for over a hundred years. 蔊reat to talk to older adults while in line stating that they have been there since they were born?! 蔛o cool. 蔐otsa community tables so you can get to know your neighbors :)

I kept putting off going to Philippe's French Dip Sandwiches in North Alameda St in the Dt area of LA because people wanted to come with but if i waited any longer i would never get my sandwich... These are supposed to be the best french dipped sandwiches in the area, I ordered the Roast Beef, douple dipped sandwich with an arnold palmer... The deli carver prepared my sandwich and gave me my drink in like 2 mins... First impression: My sandwich looks sad and skinny. I remember my roast beef sandwiches being pretty big...if i dont have to smash my sandwich down in order to be able to put it in my mouth then something's not right... I asked for the double dipped sandwich and i thought it would be soaked in the "au jus" but it was barely dipped...some parts of my sandwich the bread was still hard and in others i got no meat. This was a very dissapointing french dipped roast beef sandwich. The only thing i was not dissapointed in was their spicy horseradish mustard; it was SPICY!! and my arnold palmer was also good ;) Sad part of it is that i would totally come back to try another one of their sandwiches or maybe even the same one just have them dip my sandwich another two times... just because i love roast beef sandwiches...or maybe i'll just go to arby's LOL

My Dad used to take me here when I was a kid. 蔍 recently started going again, maybe 7-8 years ago, with friends before seeing a Dodger game. 蔍 love it. 蔠ent again Monday. 蔒y friend and I each had a french dip sandwich, a side, a piece of pie and something to drink. 蔜otal bill, for both of us, including tip, $30. 蔉ood was tasty and plentiful. 蔜he only reason it does not get a 5-star is because the food is pretty basic. 蔅ut basic, when you want it, is really great! 蔉un atmosphere. 蔍f you go upstairs it's a little less atmosphere but usually a lot less crowded.

The trick is to hit this joint on the off hours on a non game day. Devoid of tourists and those ridiculous lumberjack hipsters...lol...what a joke. Get rid of them and it's like being in L.A Confidential. I like when the freaks are there.....homeless, vatos, solo business stiffs, drunks, ex-prostitutes, etc. It makes me remember L.A when it was dangerous. Standing order: a cup of chili, roast beef double dip (maybe two) and a slice of blueberry pie. I eat and listen to the freaks mumble to themselves....aahhhh....heaven.

Ahhh...the tradition! 蔛ince 1908. 蔜he first french dip came about (according to restaurant legend) after a roll was accidently dropped in the au jus by an employee, but the policeman/customer ate it anyway. 蔄nd the rest is history. I had always wanted to eat here after hearing about it from my Dodger friends. 蔎ust a mile and a half away from the stadium. I ate here before the Dodger game on Tuesday night. 蔜he game I might add, where soon-to-be Cy Young Award winner Clayton Kershaw won his 20th. 蔅ut I digress.... The place is located on Alameda. 蔛eemed to have ample parking with two lots when I first showed up. 蔍 got here at around 4:30 PM on a game day and the place was just starting to get busy. 蔍 ordered two french dips (beef) a bag of Doritos and a 16 ounce Stella Artois for my wife and me, which came to about $21 bucks. 蔜he sandwhiches were not huge, but were a "melt in your mouth goodness" and were $6 a piece. 蔣ou need to try the hot mustard - the kick from the horseradish really finishes the taste of the sandwich and the au jus. The place is old, but quaint. 蔜wo stories, lots of tables. 蔜he upstairs has several rooms like little cubby holes. 蔛ome advice - try to get there before 5:00 PM on game day, the place gets really busy after that. 蔅y the time we left at around 5:45, the lines were long and the place was jumping. 蔍t also seemed both parking lots were full by that time. Good restaurant. 蔄 great LA Tradition. 蔜ry it!

There goes my 6-pack abs. 蔍'll have to hike for hours to burn this lunch off. 蔅ut it's totally worth it. I split a beef and Swiss sandwich and a lamb sandwich with a friend. 蔜he beef is way better and probably the tastiest beef sandwich I've ever had. 蔍t's jam-packed with flavor. 蔜he rest was average, macaroni salad and chili with beans. 蔠e also slit the boysenberry pie. You order and pay at a counter where they hand you the food on a cafeteria tray. 蔜he only service at the benches is the bus-boy that cleans up your plates. Get there before the crowds and park in their free parking lot behind the restaurant or across the street on Ord Street. Minus a star for the wait. 蔍t's extremely busy at lunchtime and even the parking lot gets full. Kick-ass that they've been open since 1908, but the current location is not the original. 蔜he 101 freeway took care of that in the '50s. 蔜hey also claim to have invented the French dipped sandwich.

I found this joint on the food network a few years back and have been back here ever since then. �This place is popular for their french dips, so if you don't like french dips, then you probably will just be ok with this place. 蔛ometimes the line is long (5 or 6 people), and sometimes there is nobody in line, so it all depends. French dips (beef, pork, lamb) are very good. 蔄sk them to do the double dip (double dip= buns are dipped in the juice twice). 蔈ven if you do not like the soggy bread, you should try this. �Must get the pickled beets and pickled eggs! They are so... good. 蔈ggs are pickled in pickled beets juice. �Over 2400 reviews and a 4-star, do I need to say anymore!

Came in on a Saturday with relatives. We were super starving and decided to come try Philippe's since we were in the area. It's located on the edge of Chinatown. There's two parking lots, one directly behind the restaurant and another across the street which has plenty of parking space. Yay for free parking and being able to find parking!! Upon entering, you will see a crap load of people standing in a crap load of lines! It's a bit intimidating, but it's not too bad, I guess. Gives you time to look at the simple menu. And once you order, you get your food right away. We ordered 6 double dipped beef sandwiches, 1 turkey w/ cheese, 2 potato salad, 2 cole slaw, 3 lemonades, 1 soda, and 1 iced tea (can you tell I was the one who had to order?) Total came out to $56.67 not bad. Service could be better, but I guess it doesn't matter too much cause the place is packed! The restaurant is pretty spacious, there's lots of tables in the back and there's tables along the lines at the counter. The sandwiches were pretty tasty, there's a perfect amount of soggyness on the bread from the juices and the beef wasn't too heavy tasting. I think the sandwiches are a little small but they filled me up. I say they're small because my cousin's husband ate his within 2 minutes and he was still hungry. Everyone thought they were delicious, but then again it could be because we were all really hungry. I think this is the closest thing that tastes like the Philly Cheesesteaks I had in Philadelphia =) not as greasy, which is good. Yumm.

Phillippe's will change your life. Do yourself a favor and try them. There's a reason it's a LA institution. I always get the single dipped roast beef with HELLA horseradish. There are benches and sawdust on the floor, so come dressed accordingly. If I remember correctly, it behooves you to bring cash. I think there was an ATM but it looked shady, so just bring ca$h. You need to try these sandwiches. Damn, I wish I had one right now.

I've lived in LA my entire life and have only recently visited Philippe for the first time. I can honestly say that I don't regret waiting so long to come here. The beef dip was just okay at best. The meat was bland and the bread was kind of stale. I added a little bit of salt and it helped.. but not enough to allow me to give this place any more than 3 stars. Although the food didn't impress me, I do think it's cool that Philippe has been around for over 100 years. There's also a lot on the side of the restaurant so parking isn't a problem.

Philippe The Original is one of those places I heard about when I first moved to Los Angeles and have been meaning to check out ever since. I'm still confused as to whether Philippe or Cole's created the French Dip. I describe the atmosphere as 'Crowded Stadium Bustle'. Way more low key then the gleaming wood bar with brass rails that 蔍'd envisioned these past two years. 蔈rin points out I was probably thinking about having looked in from outside on Cole's. I'm gonna say Philippe was the original French Dip sandwich as it dominates Cole's in number of Yelp reviews and rating. The sandwich was delicious, but the sides surprised me by being equally scrumptious. 蔍 enjoyed sliced beets, macaroni salad, small spicy peppers and pickles. There is no au jus option for dipping. 蔜hough I detected au jus splashed on the meat of the sandwich itself. Still fascinates me that every dish has an origin and a birthplace.

Came here because I saw this on Man vs Food. I'm a huge fan of the types of places he visits so I decided to drop by and try a sandwhich from here. The parking lot is really small, luckily someone was leaving at the time I arrived. I knew I was going to be waiting in a long line so that didn't really bother me or the fact that they don't accept credit cards. I ordered the pork sandwhich "doubled dipped" I was going to order the cheesecake since I wanted something sweet to accompany my food but when I saw the size of the cheesecake and how much it cost, I knew it was not going to be worth it. So I just stood with my sandwhich. I gotta say when I got it, I was a bit dissapointed because it was really small ( I thought it would at least a little bigger) but the taste of it (mainly the dipped part) was delicious! The cashier/attendant that served me was in a pretty cranky-rushing mood so that was pretty dissapointing. Overall, the taste of the sandwhich was awesome but everything else was bad. It wasn't worth the drive.

Saw it on tv, realized I'd lived in LA for a while without ever hearing about it which meant it was either awesome and hidden or one of those invented hype things. I'm still not sold on which one it was but the fact that the sandwiches were under $7 and the potato salad was only $1.30 I was very satisfied by the prices. I'd get my sandwich double dipped and use that mustard liberally but be careful cause it's pretty hot.

Perfect time right after lunch rush, just pass 1:30.. Close to dead empty.. Stupid ATM took 5 minutes to give me my cash, since this is a CASH ONLY based location Two minute wait in line. Ordered one pork and roast beef, one with macaroni salad and potato and two pumpkin pies with Ice Tea. I've been bragging for sooo long how good these dipped juicy sandwiches where and my friend enjoyed every last single bite. I have a memory like an elephant so it brought back good memories of my dad and I and the saw dust on the floor waiting what seemed to be forever to get a double dipped roast beef sandwiches and that bite that I had today is still as good as when I was 5 years old. Pros: great sandwich - Friendly staff -Amazing desserts Cons: ATM machine - Long lines ( during lunch time) -

Went to have the original French dip sandwich on our trip to LA .. Was highly recommended by a friend from LA.... The sandwich meat was Juicyy ( I had pork).. And the mustard was the craziest I have ever had!!! Such a fulfilling experience ....... There were multiple lines on the various 蔲ood counters...fast moving for the number of ppl standing in line! Liked the vibe this place had..... A LOTTA old folks were here too... We did one of the food fatal mistakes though... 蔠e were happy n super satisfied with the sandwich - however we went ahead n packed an extra one to go for r flight..... Ended up not liking it So much then.... Hmmm... So lesson learnt again: 1. Let go went the food peaks 2. Eat fresh Hanna

Damn I wish someone would have told me to get it double-dipped. My sandwich was kind of dry and lacking in flavor from just taking a quick dip in the au-jus.. I came here to sample the beef, as I had it bookmarked for a while. I only got the sandwich and can of Diet Coke; for which they charge something like $1.50; damn fkn robbery! �The sandwich was on the small side, but ok if you are not that hungry. There was some chewy fat on the meat that I had to spit out once; that's just nasty. Unlike Geno's or Pat's in Philly, this is one place that I would not be inclined to revisit. If you are in the area though, give it a shot; definitely better than the corporate chains that serve pickled beef and other shit they throw on sandwiches. Yeah Subway, I am talking about you!

The line was daunting but we HAD to go here. Our party split up, one half waited in line, the other half found a table upstairs. Waited in line about 20-30 minutes I think, which is kind of crazy but sometimes good food is worth doing crazy shit for (my family used to drive an hour to get to the nearest In-N-Out). I went with a beef double dip with bleu cheese, lemonade and a pickle. Super good! Couldn't contribute any more than what's already been said, magic bread that doesn't fall apart, tender meat... Best part about going here was how excited someone was to be able to buy their horseradish mustard and then have it sadly confiscated at LAX.

I've been meaning to review this joint for a while, but time got the best of time. I came here after watching the show Man Vs. Food and he recommended this spot saying that they had the best french dipped sandwichs. 蔍 was eager to try it out since it was close to where I lived and this was the first time that I was actually able to go to a spot featured on the show :) Anywho - went on a weekend and was happy to find that they had their own parking alot across the street. 蔠alking into the joint you see several lines and the ground full of sawdust. �We chose a line and it moved much quicker then I had expected. 蔍 also like how when you order the food - the cashier brings it to you - and then you grab seating. 蔆afeteria style.

It's not bad, but thats about as far as I'll go. Nothing about this place is worth the effort of driving more than a couple miles. The beef sandwich is good, but not great and not anything special. The price is alright, but not cheap for what you are getting. The only thing that is special about this place is the lively LA vibe it has when you walk in the door. And although that is nice, it doesn't make the food any better. Altogether, this place is just not worth it. Save yourself some time, energy, and money by skipping this and going to some fast food joint. You won't be missing much.

What I've tried: Best french dipped sandwiches I've ever had! I've had the roast beef and the pork. The roast beef sandwich is my favorite. They give you just the right amount of thinly sliced meat, and the bread isn't too dry or too soggy. Add a little bit of the mustard to cause an explosion of flavors in your mouth.The macaroni salad is pretty good, too. You absolutely MUST get the lemonade. It's so refreshing and only 75� What a steal! Prices: Around $6 for the sandwiches, which I think is a fair price. The lemonade is really cheap and delicious. Overall, I think the prices are cheap to fair. Service: There's always someone cleaning the tables and throwing your trash away. The service is pretty quick, even where there are long lines. Everyone is really friendly. Location: The main area is at a lower level that you'll see right away when you first step into the restaurant. You get a very old-fashioned vibe from the restaurant since it's been around for such a long time.

I saw this place on tv and thought I would give it a try since I was in the area. I think its a bit over-rated. We walked in around 11:30am on a Tuesday and the place was already packed. There were dozens of people waiting in line. I think I waited in line for about 15 min before I got to the counter to place my order. They only take cash but have an atm inside. I ordered the beef sandwich with a side of potato salad. They dip half of your sandwich in au jus before adding the beef into the bread. I think by doing that, half of the bread gets soggy while the other portion is dry. The beef was just ok, I didnt find it very flavorful and it wasn't as tender as I hoped for. They have a spicy mustard/horseradishy sauce on each table which is really good and hot! The potato salad was good with just the right amount of mayo and mustard. Overall, I'm glad I tried it but not sure if I would come back. It's a place everyone should definitely try once

Philippe's is the ultimate example of a restaurant that does something simple and does it extremely well. There's a reason it's been around since 1908. Sawdust on the floor and a menu that hasn't changed much, Phillippe's is where you go for your sandwich fix. In old school cafeteria uniforms, these gents and ladies (mostly ladies) know their French Dip sandwiches. Coffee remained a nickel until 1977, when it increased 100% to a dime. Lemonade and iced tea are about 65 cents. Sandwiches are about $6-7 each depending on the meat. The best is the lamb. Watch them cut the meat off the bone. My other go-to is the turkey with swiss. I dip my turkey sandwich in the simply delicious coleslaw. Other side favorites: potato salad and pasta salad. Everything is freshly made constantly throughout the day, so you know that the coleslaw (which can get soggy at other sandwich joints) won't be that way here. I'm sure the salads and breakfast are awesome here. I heard they have PB&J sandwiches for $2. Lingo: regular is the single dip (one side of bread dipped), double dip (both sides of bread dipped), and wet (entire sandwich submerged in au jus after it's made). Cash only. Free parking. Don't forgot to put hot mustard on everything. You can also buy to take it home for $4.25. Make sure to take a few minutes to check out the Dodgers memorabilia and the train room. It's like a lost part of LA's history that remains standing strong, and for good reason. Mad respect.

The first time I had Phillipe's, I had the misfortune of getting my french dip to go and ate it in the car while driving WITH the spicy mustard slathered on it. Well, it was a miracle that I didn't hit anything/anyone because I had to swerve my car to the side of the road. That mustard was a complete surprise to my taste buds and my nose...holy moly. I wouldn't call their sandwiches "cheap" but for the whole experience, it's worth every penny. The food is great, the coffee is hilariously cheap and despite how the service can be a little lack luster at times, it still good and friendly. I love this place because you see such a diversity of people and they're all hankering for the same thing. You sit anywhere by the counters and just expect people to bump into you from time to time or to see some interesting folks walk in. Parking is plentiful but can fill up quickly and walking distance from some interesting sights nearby.

Well, I finally made it out to Philippe's after hearing about it for years and years. For a french dip sandwich, it was very good. Lots of options to add to your plate and sandwich as well. What really made the sandwich great was the horseradish mustard sauce. It had a great kick to it that I loved. I liked the lamb more than the beef. I think Langer's might still be my favorite sandwich shop in LA.. but Philippes is LA history!

Philippe's serves the best french dipped sandwich, a house specialty of where you can choose the tenderest of meats from roast beef, roast pork, leg of lamb, turkey or ham served on a lightly textured, freshly baked French roll. 蔜hey are pre-dipped in the natural gravy of the roasts and you can choose what kind of cheese you want including: Swiss, American, Monterey Jack or Blue cheese. They have many side dishes to choose from but my favorite is their cole slaw or potato salad. 蔕rder coffee for 9 cents. 蔅est deal ever. They also serve breakfast. 蔔othing fancy but the experience of sitting in Philippe's is something to treasure. The seating arrangements take you back in time. 蔔o cushions on the benches and the furnishings are classic. Kid friendly but could be difficult if you have multiple kids. 蔜hey have high chairs and the bathrooms don't have changing stations. Cash only. 蔄TM on location.

Come on, 2k+ reviews? What in the world is left to say? The haters hate and the French dip munchers rejoice, I guess.. -Good basic French Dips with beef, pork, lamb, etc. Get the extra cheese for 40 cents - if you ask for your lemonade or ice tea to go, they'll put it in a nice big styrofoam cup and charge you an extra 10 cents each.

Oh my god, YES. My girlfriend gets hung up on the idea of place, and Philippe's was the latest obsession. So, after a couple of weeks of subtle suggestions, we made our way over to Chinatown to fill our bellies with a couple of nice French dip sandwiches. I was skeptical, not really being a French dip fan in the first place, but I went for it: Roast beef and Swiss, double-dipped. Once we sat down, I topped it off with Phillipe's horseradish mustard, took a bite, and heard the "Hallelujah" chorus. THIS is a good sandwich. After eating the entirety of the masterpiece that had been so efficiently created for me, along with a side of potato salad (also YUM), I knew that I had to have the only piece of the restaurant that I could take with me: the horseradish mustard. So, we bought a jar before we left, and it is now a staple in our fridge. Don't walk, RUN to Phillipe's and free your tastebuds from the monotony of everyday life!

DEFIED MY EXPECTATIONS. I never had a big desire to go to Philippe's, just because the sandwiches look pretty boring. But I couldn't let my year-long internship end without ever having gone to the famous Philippe's, because I literally work right across the street. And that would have been sad. Anyways. Got the pre-soaked lamb with cole slaw and an Arnold Palmer. I waited less than 10 minutes, because they made my sandwich right after I ordered. THE SANDWICH was perfect. There was a perfect au jus-bread ratio, generous helpings of tender lamb, and light sauce taste. For $8.73, I was stuffed and very satisfied.

I just don't get it.... and I'm sad. 蔅ad food always makes me sad. 1 star for the spicy mustard and 1 star for the nostalgic environment, but that's all you get! 蔉ood was horrible... so sad. I had such high expectations for this place... and was so looking forward to eating here. After seeing this place on TV, I think the Travel channel, I was so excited to come and try the beef dip and the pork dip. I was even more excited when we were lucky enough to find parking right in front - and became ecstatic when I discovered that the lines were only 4-5 people long. Didn't want to limit myself so made the boyfriend share with me so that we could try both the beef and the pork. Was so happy and excited that we even ordered the potato salad, pecan pie and red velvet cake. I know... we really went all out but I was so excited.. and food always makes me so happy. Boy was I sadly disappointed. First bite... I was thinking, is this it?! Second bite... this can't be it... Third bite...um... maybe the pork is better. First bite of pork... um... not much flavor and sort of dry. I was in shock before I became a sad panda. Small sandwiches with very little meat. The best part of the sandwiches was probably the bread ... but nothing to rave about. Even the homemade potato salad was disappointing. Pecan pie is my favorite so I was at least hoping this was good... but again, disappointed... would rather get a whole pie from Albertsons for the same price of this slice. Before we left, I was still in shock and disbelief. I wanted to like this place so much that I wanted to give it one more try and decided to order the ham and take it home. So we tried one more time... but by the time I unwrapped it at home, smelled like the ham sandwiches my mom use to pack in my lunch box when I was a child. And the sogginess made me want to barf... one bite and to the trash it went. Don't believe the hype! It's overpriced, bland, soggy and just gross. Go to The Hat instead... you'll get 4x the amount of meat.. and it's just yummy, greasy goodness!

Came here on a Saturday night around 9 and there was still a decently long line to order and lots of people still eating in the restaurant. I ordered a Double Dipped Roast Beef Sandwich ($6) with a side of Potato Salad ($1.20). I thought the first few bites were pretty good, but the sandwich quickly became boring for me. Nothing very special about this sandwich. It does not set itself apart from any other roast beef sandwich. The beef was pretty tender--I give it that. However, parts of my sandwich was really salty. Also, since they dip the sandwich for you, as opposed to having your own au jus on the side, the ends of my sandwich were very soggy. The Potato Salad was good. It was a good complement to my otherwise boring sandwich. It wasn't too heavy and I really enjoyed the light celery flavor in it. Cash only, but there is an ATM inside.

I hate going to Downtown LA, and don't recommend it to anyone, but if you must be in Downtown for any reason, stop by Philippe's. 蔣ou'll be glad you did. French dips done right, with the BEST spicy mustard you'll ever have. 蔅uy a jar to take home, use it on everything, and figure you'll be due for another jar the next time you unfortunately have to go downtown. �I've been wanting to try other things on their menu, but the original beef dips are so good, and I get here so infrequently, its hard to change. 蔜he pickles are delicious, and so are the desserts. This place does get busy. 蔐ines are long but move fast. 蔅est thing to do is have one person in your party order while the others scope out a table. 蔄nd for the love of God, know what you want before you get up there. 蔜his place is too polite to go all soup nazi on the guests, but the people behind you will get frustrated.

I really don't think there's much more I can say that hasn't been said a thousand times already in the 2,000+ reviews Philippe's already has on Yelp, but I'll add my two-cents on a few things that are often overlooked. The thing that really sets Philippe's sandwiches apart from other sandwiches is their house mustard. 蔄 spicy-mustard tastes a lot like horseradish, but doesn't actually contain horseradish, Philippe's house mustard is a definite must-have on any of their hot French-dip sandwiches. 蔜hey also sell their mustard by the jar, so definitely pick one up to keep at home. Philippe's has a very good dinner salad. 蔍t comes pre-tossed with dressing (I usually get ranch) so it has a perfect salad-to-dressing ratio, and comes with fresh croutons made from their great sandwich bread. 蔜he dinner salad is pretty big too - plenty big enough to share between two people. Philippe's has an AWESOME banana-cream pie. 蔍'm not sure if they make it in-house or get it from somewhere else, but sometimes I stop in just for the pie itself. 蔛uper light and creamy with a perfectly flakey crust, it might be the best banana-cream pie I've ever had. A few quick tips: First, always get your sandwich "double-dipped." 蔔ormally they only dip one side of the roll in the beef au jus, but they will dip both sides if you ask. 蔛econd, always pick a line that has two registers. 蔔aturally, these lines move twice as fast as the other lines. 蔜hird, bring cash - since it's a "cash-only" joint. My usual order: dinner salad with ranch; double-dipped beef sandwich with swiss, extra mustard; a pickled egg; and a slice of banana-cream pie. 蔍t doesn't get much better than that.

It was good but not worth standing in line for that long to get a damn soggy sandwich. 蔠e came here on a Sunday around 1pm and let's just say, people were in line all the way up the stairs. 蔍t was like trying to buy a train ticket in mainland China. 蔙ows and rows of middle aged people waiting in line to buy a $8 sandwich. 蔜here were maybe 10 separate lines, each one with 20 people waiting, a teaming, seething room of over 200 people waiting in lines and multitudes trying to maneuver large unwieldy trays amid the madness and sawdust. 蔠hat is deal with the sawdust???? Another frustration was the lack of menu. 蔄side from some old fashioned signs posted on the walls, we had no clue what they were selling until it was our turn to order and we can actually see the food on display behind the glass. 蔜he rest of the 20 minutes of waiting, we were just staring at the other people in line. �Food: Beef sandwich- kind of dry and boring. 蔠e had to add cheese and even then, it was just average. 蔔othing else in there but beef and cheese and I guess it was dipped in some soup and that's what makes it all special. 蔄round $8 Pork sandwich- better than the beef. Around $8 Macaroni- I didn't see what was so great about it but my friend liked it. 蔒aybe because she's a fob from China and never had macaroni salad before. 蔄round $3 or 4 Cake- Really sweet and quite delicious. 蔄bout $3 Pickled Egg- Well it WAS really pretty, dyed this purplish fuchsia color. Tasting it was a different story. 蔎ust sour and weird. 蔈w. �1 Ice tea- Tasteless sugarless ew! �1 蔎ust get the free water! 蔜hey have cups Lemonade- I don't remember but everyone got these. 蔒aybe b/c it was cheap and maybe because it seemed quaint? 蔠hatever.

I knew about Philippe's from BOTH Anthony Bourdain and Adam Richman. A friend (whose food opinion I highly respect) here in Philly said he enjoyed it. A friend in LA in the know suggested it. And yet I wasn't going to drag my brothers there. I had other plans. Then the Dodgers Stadium tour guide/probation officer who you prolly don't want to mess with suggested it. It finally clicked: Get your dumb ass to Philippe's, pronto!!! Upon entering, it seemed chaotic. Multiple clusters of people. It seemed like it might take forever and I wasn't sure exactly where to enter the fray. I studied the situation and it became apparent that the lines form between the long cafeteria-style tables. My brothers and I got in one and it actually moved quickly. I noticed what I thought were bottles of thousand island dressing on the tables. My Philly friend suggested getting some mustard as that's what they promote. Turns out that thousand island looking stuff actually is mustard. But I'll get to that later. I ordered roast beef with American double dipped meaning the bread takes a swim in the Au Jus which actually is the combined juices of all four meats they serve as Adam Richman tells us in this food porn: http://www.youtube.com/w�The bread stands up well to the Au Jus. The roast beef and cheese together are about as great as that wonderful pair can get. Then the mustard that I mistook for thousand island. Wow! Hot mustard that is sweet and delicious. I would put the mustard on some bites and leave it off others and it was like I was eating two separate wonderful sandwiches. All told, if you're visiting LA, Philippe's is in "must" territory. I am so happy I finally listened to all those voices circling around me singing its praises.

The French dip was very good. I got the beef half dipped with American cheese. My only problem was that it was a little small (could have eaten two). This is a recurring theme in my reviews.

Although the sandwich was very tasty, I could see myself coming back here just for the pie. I swear, the huge piece of chocolate pie that I was served was the best chocolate pie I ever had. It was good to that point where you want to share, but when you do you become irritated. You realize you made a mistake sharing because now you are down one extra bite you COULD have had. The sandwich though was, as I said, very tasty. It was not overly salty or too soggy. A small side of fries would have made this meal spectacular. Oh wellsies! It is a given for why this place has been in business for so long and has such great reviews on yelp. Definitely a must before heading to the ball park!

A lot of these restaurants that claim to be the originators of some dish (like the French Dip) will jack their prices up to take advantage of all the publicity they get.

This was recommended to us by several people in LA and I saw it on the travel channel. The place was pretty full as we waited in line. We both got the beef double dip sandwich with swiss and potato salad. I tried their hot mustard and made my nostrils burn...but it was good. The beef was pretty good and so was the potato salad. The sandwich felt a little dry though. I thought double dipped meant they dip the entire sandwich in the au jus and completely soak it. Yeah it coulda used more au jus. But not bad for about $8.

This place is an LA institution and you should definitely go at least once, but it is not nearly as good as Cole's. The crowds make it tough to get through the line, you have to pay in cash, and the sandwiches are a bit too small. The whole place just feels like a soup kitchen. Of course, you can get a cup of coffee for $0.19, but remember, you get what you pay for.

We went to Philippe's last Sunday while in LA and like everyone else I know that has tried it, I loved it. My wife and I had the beef dips with Swiss cheese (mine was double dipped) and my daughter had the turkey (no dip). After waiting in line for an eternity to order our food, I scarfed that thing down in less than a minute. In hindsight, I should have ordered two; because there is no way I was waiting in that line for another one. A little advice to anyone trying Philippe's for the first time... find the oldest, grumpiest, near-death-looking server behind the counter and stand in her line. She will be the fastest one with your order. Don't use my logic and get in line with the young, semi-decent looking one. She obviously had no desire to be there on a Sunday afternoon. Overall, great food, but don't go there looking for a nice relaxing meal or upscale ambiance. Just get in line, eat your beef dip and get out of LA... before some Dodger fan beats the crap out of you.

I keep thinking about that cheese sandwich... Phillippe is known for their french dip sandwiches. Since I'm not a meaty person, I was worried that they might not have something for me. I was SO WRONG. I ordered the Swiss Cheese sandwich for a mere $3something. No lettuce or tomato. Just a fine layer of mayo and layers of swiss cheese on a fresh baguette. I'm not even the hugest bread person, but, man, that bread was good. I also had a cup of New England Clam Chowder - no bacon! Not quite as creamy as I'd want it but still good side to my cheese sandwich. I drooled as I was looking at the other sides through the glass. I need to order one of their huge pickles and try their macaroni and potato salads. For now, though, based on the simple cheese sandwich, I'm a total fan! Don't forget some of their hot mustard. It's more than mustard - it's 蕀ore like horseradish (my favorite sauce). Bring cash with your appetite - it's a cash only establishment.

When it comes to french dip, this place is the tops! The lamb with bleu cheese is the best sandwich in my humble opinion. I get it double dipped in au jus sauce. I have been coming here for over 40 years and I have loved every sandwich I have had in that time. The custard is outstanding and they have inexpensive tap beer to chase it all down. Nothing like a sandwich and a glass of Stella (on tap) for lunch. I recommend avoiding the lunch rush and going early or later to enjoy your experience the most. Lastly, this place is a Los Angeles landmark that is worth the drive. Enjoy....

So I'm a little worried about how this review is going to go down. First off, I know it's an institution that's why I visited, but I was let down. I love French Dip sandwiches so I was ecstatic to go to the "original" establishment. But when I got my beef dip order, the beef was not moist or tender it was dry and kind of rubbery and I know the bread is meant to be dipped in the jus first but it just made their bread a soggy, disintegrated mess. However the jus was tasty, with a little saltiness that was good and I enjoyed their in-house hot mustard. The establishment itself is old and worn. Doesn't seem to get cleaned too often, so that might be another turn off as well to some people. Parking is hell here, like the rest of LA. And the sourrounding diggs are sketchy at best. 蔛o I don't think it's worth visiting if you're not IN LOVE with trying French Dip sandwiches or LA historical areas.

If I'm gonna pay $7-8 bucks for a sandwich, it ain't gonna be here. I mean C'mon! Look at this little thing, I have to eat two, probably 3 of these lil' things to get full. But I guess that's what they want you to do. I know this place has been around since the 20's and it's a landmark blah, blah, blah. But I seriously doubt they gave you this little meat in your sandwich back in the 20's or 30's. I had the lamb, which was ok, even though one half of the sandwich looked like the brain of a cat (they gave me the end piece of the rack of lamb) and I was so tempted on sending it back and getting another half (the real half) but I just said to hell with it. Who am I, right? They're Phillipes, we have these suckers overpaying for our little sandwiches. This guy dont know! LOL! So I sit back, sipped on my Blue Moon or was it Stella? And just tried to enjoy myself. The taste of the good half of the sandwich was ok, didn't have the roast beef, but when I do, I'll update this review. Better off going to Eastside Deli, this place is so watered down, just one of those places you can say you went to. Like Disneyland or Hollywood & Highland. I'm looking at you Adam Rickman! LOL! The highlight was probably the spicy mustard and this cute young chick working the register.

I've been wanting to come here forever! and after seeing it on TV i had to try it, after a year from seeing it on TV i finally got to see what this magical bee dip heaven has. 蔇on't know what the hype was about this place, but always worth a try. Going into this place when you first walk in its cafeteria style feel, the women behind the counter are friendly enough but nothing to hoot and holler about. I was kind of disappointed that this place only takes cash, but has many at ms everywhere. The wait was about 5 minutes and we were greeted by one of the cashiers. I ordered the beef dip with jack cheese, my friend had the tuna sand which and his daughter had the lamb dip. Beef Dip- what can you say it was good, savory and it was good. Not the best I've ever had, it sat in my stomach like a lead brick only one was enough for me. Tuna sand which- stay away from this i had a bite and this was by far the driest sandwich ever. The flavor wasn't there and honestly my mom makes a better one. I didn't get to try the lamb dip but my friends daughter said it was way too greasy. Cole slaw- eh the Cole slaw was okay - little too bland for my taste. Potato salad was yummy, not too much mayo and good taste macaroni salad - lets just say there was plenty left over.

I went here on a friend's recommendation, and I'm glad that I did. The french dip sandwiches are out of this world. If you're not a fan of the bread dipped in broth, I would recommend ordering the sandwich to go and they give you the broth on the side to dip yourself. I had the beef sandwich with swiss cheese and it was delicious. I ordered a side of macaroni salad and had the custard for dessert, and they were great as well. 蔖hillipe's is famous for their spicy mustard, and when they say spicy, they mean it. Use it sparingly on your sandwich, but make sure you use it because it is awesome! Parking is plenty and convenient, and the prices are very reasonable. It is a great afternoon lunch spot on the weekend.

My boyfriend was raving about Philippe's and kept saying how he couldn't wait to take me there on a recent trip to visit him in LA. 蔋e gave me the entire history lesson on the creation of the french dip sandwich, so needless to say, I had very high expectations walking in. From first sight, Phillipe's may not seem to live up to the hype... but once I took my first bite, I was hooked. 蔜hey not only exceeded my expectations, they had us craving it again for lunch the next day and we went back! 蔍 ate there twice during my 3 day stay in LA. 蔅oth days I got the roast beef french dip (double dipped) with a side of potato salad. 蔍'm a HUGE fan of their horseradish mustard. 蔜his spot will definitely be on the list of places to go when I'm West Coast bound every few months. 4 stars definitely. 蔕nly missing that 5th due to cash only (which I rarely carry)... and because I live on the East coast and it's so far away. 蔆ome to me, Philippe, you delicious french dip, you!

Omnomnom! Since seeing this place on Man v Food, I've been wanting to come for a while. After visiting my best friend at USC, we decided to head over to Downtown and hit up Phillippe. We all ordered the beef dip sandwich, and my girlfriend and I had 75 cent Arnold Palmers. The Sandwich was good, if not a bit small for the price. The signature mustard accompaniment was definitely what made the place unique, otherwise the french dip was just average. I'll be coming back, especially to trie the Lamb dip and maybe a slice of pecan pie!

Finally made it to Philippe's! It was good, but it didnt seem as great as I had expected. 蔜he lines were exceptionally long, but it moved. 蔠e got there at 1:50PM on a Saturday afternoon. There was a group of 4 of us, my mom, my family friend, and my MOH (maid of honor) after a long day at garment district. Found this on our way to the freeway and had to stop! We ordered 2 roast beef sandwiches (no dip) for the older ladies. 蔜he MOH and I split the turkey and the roast beef with swiss, 1X dipped. We all split the sides of potato, mac, and cole slaw. 蔠e order 3 sodas, the 75cent lemondade, a bottle of water (come on LA water is disgusting). and then we also ordered slice of apple pie and the brownie. 蔄ll for $48! 蕁ot bad, but they only take cash. 蔍 came prepared since I was on a mission to bargain in garment district! The sandwich was not too bad. 蔍t was pretty tasty...i give it a 4 stars for food. 蔜he sides were tasty too! 蔜he apple pie tasted great....i loved to fork everything, hahaha! The crowd moved, but it was constantly having a stream of people coming in. 蔍t would of gone faster if our server didnt mess up the order 3x. 蔛he kept dipping even tho i clearly said 2 TWO NO DIP roast beef....she dipped...ai. �Then the other gripe I had was we found a table upstairs, but no one came by to clean up the tables...so we sat next to someone else's garbage. 蔠e didnt find the trash so we had to leave our crap there too. 蔜he poor lady after us was happy to just get the table despite the pile of ppls food :( 蔜hat is why it got a 3 instead of 4. The dip is not something you can take home and eat later in my opinion, so that is why we had to eat and deal with the dirty tables :(

I can describe this place with one word: Overrated. I do love french dip sandwiches and have had some awesome ones in the past, but I don't see what the big deal about Philippe's is. 蔍 felt that the food was overpriced for what you get. 蔜he sandwich is definitely not large enough. �And the sides (I got mac and cheese), while good, are not portioned big enough to be worth what you pay for them. The food was pretty delicious, but not filling enough. 蔖lus, I felt that the sandwich itself was a little dry. 蔍 asked to get the beef-dipped sandwich I ordered with some sauce on it but they gave me no sauce either on it nor on the side. 蔍 had to smother it with horseradish and that wasn't really fun. �I also don't really like the seating area. 蔍t's not really conducive to a good conversation. 蔣ou essentially sit at a large table with other people and sit on stools. 蔍t's kind of awkward. 蔉or such a legend, I would expect them to have better seating arrangements. This place certainly is an LA legend and I'd heard good things about it from multiple sources before I had a chance to try it. 蔍 just didn't really like my experience there. 蔍 would probably still go back and perhaps I'll have a different review next time.

What more can a pendejo say about this place after 2500 reviews other than the lamb and blue cheese sandwich is pretty good. 蔄s are the pigs feet, mustard, the chili, potato salad, macaroni salad and cole slaw. 蔅ut the food here is nothing really too special. 蔍t is meat seasoned with salt only and baked in the oven. 蔜here is no rocket science involved in the kitchen here and in comparison with the institution of the Mufletta at Central Grocery, it is not really a great sandwich at all. 蔎ust a good sandwich. 蔠hen I was a little kid, I came here with my dad and some homeless guy was washing his nuts in the drinking fountain. 蔖retty soon, we are going to turn our heads for a moment and this place is going to be charging 10 bucks for one of these little sandwiches.

2 stars because the environment of this deli is truly authentic and reminds me of Kat'z in New York. Sawdust floor, open cafeteria-style ordering, and very cheap prices. I saw the Love Yelp has for this place, so I came with extremely high expectations that were shattered, SHATTERED, when I actually ordered a french dip. I got a ham and it was cold. The bread was only very slightly brown with au jus so I asked if could be extra dipped, the lady said no. I asked if I could get some sauce on the side instead, and she said they don't give out the sauce. So I got a cold, flavorless ham sandwich with nothing else. The lemonade was worth it and very refreshing, but the sandwich was so terrible and bland I could not even finish it. went to get some Taquitos instead. This is one of the places I do not understand where the hype is coming from. I will not be coming here again.

I became a Yelper just so I could rate this place. I have been eating here since 1975, so I consider myself an expert of sorts. Dig this, the same gal behind the counter I remember from the '70's! Asian with lots of make up....god bless her. Order the sandwiches double dipped if you like au jus. Beef and pork are the staples, but lamb is a nice change. Side orders??? You can see about 150 on a board at the end of the counter, and in the refrigerated counter where you order. Pickled eggs, tapioca, and apple pie are just a few options. If you are a big soft drink person, order the can of soda....the lemonade and tea come in a small glass. Coffee is still 9 cents here. Sawdust floors, old school uniforms on the staff. Before leaving don't forget to buy some old school gum or mints like Black Jack or Sen Sen. If you are train people, the train is right across the street. If you have a trip planned or are stopping here, take an hour to walk across, eat, and get back on board your Amtrak or Metrolink heading north or south. Olvera Street is also next to this place, so buy some trinkets there if you like ;)

Philippe's is a Los Angeles icon and about a three blocks walk from the Los Angeles Union Train Station. I had eaten breakfast there when I took a rail fan trip on the AMTRAK Starlate from Los Angeles to Emeryville. It has been featured on Diners, Dives, and Drive-Ins, and most recently on "The Originals with Emerl" on the cooking channel. Now I got to go back and have dinner and enjoy their famous French dip sandwich (I chose the lamb). 蔜hey have two (free) parking lots with one along the side of the building and the other across the street. They also have a private security person on duty which is nice as this is not the best part of town. I also see LAPD uses it as an unofficial substation when I saw a uniformed officer using the restroom sans his gun and other gun belt paraphernalia. The 'carvers' are women dressed up in 30's garb with aquamarine sweaters with the Philippe's logo and their hair put up in tight buns. The menu is on the wall on the right wall with all the prices. I ordered the lamb French dip with coleslaw (very sweet) and chili and a beer. I think the chili came straight from a can, as it was not even as good as Stagg's canned chili. One thing I found interesting so the 'carvers' don't touch the money they have colored glass trays you deposit your cash in. Phillipes is a Cash Only establishment, so find the ATM in the lobby before ordering if you are low on cash. The fun part is to see the cross section of people that patronize this place. I happened to be there on a Tuesday night and it was pretty busy with gentlemen in very expensive suits to those that appeared to be one paycheck away from being on the street. There are elevated tables and stools and large booths and tables around the corner from order lines. I went back and got myself a slice of peach pie and a carton of milk for dessert!

I don't think the place is terrible, but I won't eat here unless the person I'm with really wants a Philippe's sandwich. When I think about the roast beef dip here, I reflexively cringe and find myself craving a french dip from Houston's. Wait: I've gone here on weekends for brunch or dinner. The longest I've ever had to wait to reach the counter was 15min, which gave me time to decide which pie I wanted to try. Place: Big place with cafeteria style seating. There are tables with benches and some booths. There's a parking lot behind the building, another lot across the street, and metered street parking. Service: Counter service. The cashiers take the orders and grab the food. Food: (1) Roast beef dip. My first thought was that the sandwich just looks sad, like the ugly duckling or the weak pup in a litter. I was disappointed with the beef to bun ratio and felt I was eating all bread and no meat. The beef was on the dry side and the bun was flavorless and a bit stale. (2) Pork dip. I liked this one better than the roast beef. The pork was rich and, perhaps as a result, I felt there was more meat in the sandwich. Again, I thought the bun got in the way of the meat. Notables: Au jus isn't normally served on the side. Philippe's manufactures their own hot mustard that they leave out on the tables, which I do put on the sandwiches. They get their fruit and cream pies from Martino's Bakery.

I've never been a huge fan of French Dip sandwiches, but anytime you have an opportunity to eat something at the restaurant it was born at, you've got to give it a shot. I ordered the beef French Dip sandwich and it was really good! I think that most people are accustomed to a French Dip sandwich coming with the au jus sauce on the side; Philippe's does it like they always have and serves the sandwich with the bread pre-dipped and soaking in sauce. The sandwich had a warm, juicy taste to it, and the meat was very tender. I'd definitely go back again and think that the history and uniqueness of Philippe's enhanced the eating experience. Be prepared for long lines.

I'm probably one of the very few that never gets the sandwiches here. They're good, don't get me wrong... But I always go for their beef stew, along with a cup of chili. Try to avoid the place after a Dodger game, or during a weekday lunch hour, as it gets crazy packed. FYI... free wi-fi.

I really like the atmosphere at this restaurant. You feel like nothing has changed since the first day Phillipe's opened their doors over a hundred years ago. The floors are littered with wood flakes and the tables are made of simple sturdy wood. The menu is pretty extensive for a sandwich place, with tons of sides and desserts on display for your nomming pleasure. And it's all so cheap. I just adore how cheap all the food is. Most restaurants are more than happy to jack up prices when the economy stinks but I honestly feel like Phillipe does their best to keep the food good and the prices low. My favorite is the pork french dipped sandwich. Delicious! Also, their pickled eggs are wonderful - as well as dyed an interesting purple color. Add some salt and you'll have amazingness bursting in your mouth when you have that egg. Phillipe is great and highly recommended to any sandwich lover.

Came here with a friend on a Saturday for lunch. Long lines, but the queue moves very quickly and food is CHEAP ($0.65 for iced tea and coffee really is 9 cents- can't beat that!). Got the double dipped beef sandwich and a side of macaroni salad. Mac salad was ok- nothing really special. Beef sandwich was good; very juicy beef and fresh bread. Their horseradish sauce packs quite a punch and definitely clears out the sinuses. Overall, Philippe is pretty solid, but I still think it doesn't match up to the Chicago-style dipped Italian beef at Portillo's (in Buena Park).

A down-to -earth, no frills nor frou-frou type of joint, and certainly palatally satisfying + fulfilling. Where else would you be able to buy a 9cent/cup of coffee deal? Philippe takes you back in time, with the decor that appear to be the props that came straight out of the godfathers. It is an absolute treat. Unlike most other places, this place has been in existence for almost a century. Shouldn't that speak for itself? My order consisted of a tuna salad sandwich, New England Clam Chowder (since they had the names in caps, I thought it'd be nice to continue that trend here), and earl grey tea. The tuna salad, with the right amount of their special mustard sauce, was absolutely delightful and refreshing, perfectly complemented by the earl grey tea. �The clam chowder was also smooth and flavorful, since it was made of cream and not broth, which intensified the smooth, velvety taste of the soup. Overall, it would be nice to come back and try their breakfast menu, and perhaps salad too.

I think Phillipes is a little overated but fun 蕁d tasty if you are Downtown. The lines move quick and the dips are very good but small. Side orders like potatoe and mac salad are reasonable.

I've been reviewing restaurants in LA on yelp for over a year and this is my first 5 star review of a restaurant. I'm not saying LA does not have good restaurants, but they are just not for me. A lot of the "recommended" places tend to put a lot of effort in the ambiance, making the place a "hip" and "trendy" place to be. Many Angelinos tend to buy into that and sometimes forget that the food should always be the biggest aspect of a good restaurant. Not the Koi Pond outside, not the newly installed bar with all the top shelf liquor, not the gelled up sunglasses wearing dudes wearing a fedora and a V-neck shirt with such a long v collar you could see their belly button. It's about the food man. The food. I can tell by the location of Philippe's (2 blocks from sketchtown and just a hop and a skip away from shankville) and the ambiance of the place that this was a workingman's restaurant. There were wood chips scattered all over the ground, most of the seating were community benches where you will most likely sit right next to a complete stranger. The menu was cool, first I thought they had this "lemonade 75 cents" sign as a cool decoration behind the counter, then I realized, oh, that is actually the price of a lemonade here...that's not just for show. Cool beans. I can't speak to how busy this place might get during a lunch rush, I went at 3pm for lunch. We were helped immediately. We ordered a lamb sandwich and a beef sandwich along with a potato salad, coleslaw and 2 glasses of lemonade. Total was a little over $20. Not bad at all. I watched as the woman behind the counter carved off slices of lamb for my sandwich from this enormous lamb shank, it was glorious, I saw fireworks later that night and I was still thinking about that lamb shank. These guys do the French dip thing well. It is still dry enough to hold on to without getting it all over your hands, but it was wet enough inside that you really didn't need any sauces if you didn't want any. The meats were both juicy and well cooked. You add in their mustard sauce, and you truly have something magical. Great portions of meat, one sandwich was definitely enough for me to be full. I loved the coleslaw as well, simple and refreshing. I saw chili and beef stew on the menu as well, if it wasn't 95 degrees outside, I would have ordered one of them to try. Oh well, next time. And there definitely will be a next time.

there are a bunch of reviews.. yes we all love it here.. but i wanted to share how I order my sandwich I get the lamb dip sandwich with blue cheese the combination of flavors is amazing. As for the dip, it depends on if I'm taking it to go or how hungry I am (how fast I eat) TO GO: I ask for the au jus on the side, they usually look at me funny for a bit.. but then proceed to get a container for the dip. This way your sandwich doesn't go soggy and you can control the dip-age.. EAT IN: most of the time I'm rushed and so a double dip is great but if you are taking your time, it's probably better to do a regular dip but as for dip on the side. I always get a side of the yellow hot peppers too, it adds a bit of tang to the spicy level of the hot mustard. Then of course a lemonade.. Try it my way and I hope you like it as much as I do.

It makes me happy just thinking about this place. My wife and are have been gone from LA for nearly 4 months, and I find myself craving Philippes at least once a week. Every sandwich they have is incredible, and their potato salad and coleslaw are the best I've ever had as well. The prices are fantastic, and the ambience of this place just can't be beat. Yeah it can get busy, but the lines move rather quickly and efficiently. This is definitely an LA institution, and I've yet to find a better beef sandwich anywhere. Some people love the mustard, it's not exactly my thing, but the sandwich is great enough without it.

I can't believe I have never reviewed Philippe's before, but with over 2000 reviews, what can I say that hasn't been said at least 1999 times before?? It's a landmark that serves a ton of people every day with good food consistently done, and even when there are huge lines, I don't think I've ever waited much more than 5 or 10 minutes to order and get my food. We came this past Saturday, and there was a line at each station all the way back to the wall, but they had every one of them staffed, and we waited less than 5 minutes to get to the front this time. I go with the lamb, extra wet, and it's tender and delicious every time! I also really like their potato salad; they chop up the potatoes pretty fine, and it gives it a different texture which I really enjoy. I also like going for a glass of tea and glass of lemonade and doing my own mixing. Tea is just 65 cents and lemonade will set you back a big 75 cents! Also, you're not just going for the experience, the historical pedigree blah blah, you come here for the mustard! Their horseradish mustard is the best stuff around! It will burn your nostrils while making you still crave more. Philippe's is great, what else can I say! We lucked out on parking, we used the lot on the South side of the street, and there were like 5 or 6 spots open, but when we came out, there were at least 4 cars sitting there trying to wait for someone to come so they could grab up a spot. We have parked on the street before and used the meters, or parked in the lot behind the restaurant, but overall, I haven't had any bad parking situations or really long walks because of it.

They are known for the French Dip sandwiches! So get it!!! This place ONLY takes cash! So don't be that guy! Service: You basically wait in any of the lines. I think there was like 12 lines. You pretty much ask and pay for everything up front and then they make it for you right on the spot. Food: Definitely love the Beef and the Lamb double-dipped! You can order it with any type of cheese and I had the good 'ol american. The macaroni and potato salad were pretty bomb!!! The hot mustard definitely had a kick and was super tastey! Side note: There are tables on the back-side and on top. Good luck finding a spot!

Classic. The history and longevity of this establishment say it all and that is that it's one of the best french dips around. 蔜he restaurant is really cool because it maintains an olden style feel from the sawdust on the floor to the cost of lemonade. 蔜he service is fairly fast but there's usually a constant line. 蔜here's also plenty of seating and the parking situation is equally sufficient. 蔅ut it's definitely worth the drive if you're in the LA area just to experience their 100+ years of history.

I just had to drop a few notes about this great old place. The lines tend to be long no matter what time of day you roll by this place. I stopped for early dinner and enjoyed the lamb double dip. They continue to serve up the tastiest sandwiches. Nothing like a good sandwich and cold beer combo. If anyone is in the downtown area, head on down and get in line and order up a double dip. Then sit back and enjoy the crowds.

I adore this place. The food is delicious, especially their french dip sandwiches (which I get double dipped).. and the chilli is amazing as well. They have a good variety of fresh desserts and the prices are very reasonable. Hell, you can get a lemonade for like $0.60 :) Usually a line but it's part of the fun. The dining area has sawdust on the floor which adds to it's unique ambiance and makes this place awesome. Also has a little candy store inside which you can get old fashioned candies for really cheap :)

As a child, my grandfather and father took me to Philippe. 蔍 enjoyed it then and I still enjoy it now. 蔒y meal consist of two beef dips (I like them a bunch), a pickle, their lemondaide (which you have to try) and hopefully a banana cream pie (if they have it that day). The place is a bit dive-y with saw dust on the floor and it's always packed. 蔍t's a really history landmark in Los Angeles.

Mouth watering Lamb dip w/ macaroni salad & a lemonade is the usual. This is my go-to spot for a pre-Dodger game meal. It's as old as Wyatt Earp and always packed with a locals who know their food.

Philippe! Where have you been all my life??? I'm a huge fan of the French dip and I had absolutely no idea that it was invented at Philippe. 蔍t's an old school restaurant with long lines forming at counters and you pretty much need to know what you want by the time it's your turn. The sandwich makers aren't messing around! 蔄sk them to dip your bread in the broth, that makes it all juicy and lovely. The potato salad was really good too, it has a touch of mustard in it, sort of German style. The atmosphere is really cool, it feels like you're back in the 50s. But real old school 50s, not the fake jukebox Happy Days type of 50s. There are these old phone booths along the walls with working pay phones. It adds to the nostalgic feel to the place.

This place sucks. Long lines, I would be okay with it IF they were making fresh food, But you wanna know why you're waiting because the old servers wanna take forever to give a small sized sandwich, with their bare hands After handling money and other stuff. We ordered beef 蔭nd lamb and the meat was dry, the bread was chewy, there wasn't enough au jous, the chili salty, and it's cash only. We liked the free parking. The seating upstairs was awful! I felt in the waiting room to visit a prisoner. No windows, long cafeteria style tables, uncomfortable seating. �This place is SUPER overrated! People only like coming here because it's been here so long, and because they claim to have invented the double dip roast beef. It was my first time there, and I don't think I will ever make an effort to return.

Philippe's is a staple in Los Angeles and for good reason. the french dip really hits the spot. All of their meats are cooked perfectly for hours and the aju is so good. "double dipped for me please" Nothing beats that spicy mustard I always take one home cause its good on roast beef sandwiches and ham sandwiches after the holidays. The prices are unbeatable and the pickle and sides are really good. It's always really busy in here so I like to come at off hours, and the people that work there are trying to get through the line so i don't except a gleaming personality when i get there. recommendation: beef or lamb ( both good and tender ) dipped, with a side of pickles and cream soda. if im in a cheese mood Ill add swiss.

Not that this place really needs another review, but I just had to share how happy I was after eating at Philippe's. Got the beef double dipped with a pickle and macaroni salad. The french bread was crispy on the outside, soft on the inside. The beef was stacked with flavor, the dip made it even better. The macaroni salad had some relish and celery in it, just the right amount of sweet and crunchy, and not at all overpowered by mayo. And the pickle was a real dill pickle! Not like those weird tasting pickles from Jerry's Deli or some place like that. Iced tea for $0.65 and lemonade for $0.75, you can't go wrong!

PHILIPPE'S vs. COLE'S: French Dip Comparison We've been going to Philippe's for the past few years, and somehow, we just learned about Cole's. I don't know how that's possible since they're apparently just as famous as Philippe's if not more so (and often credited with INVENTING the french dip). Still, better late than never, right? So, we thought we'd compare Cole's with our regular visits to Philippe's: ATMOSPHERE Cole's underwent a restoration a few years ago that evokes its early 20th century roots. From tin-covered ceilings to red wallpaper and dark wood molding, this is what 1908 probably looked like. The neighboring bar/"speakeasy" completes the look. At Cole's, you sit down and order. At Philippe's, you order at the counter, wait, and take your food back to the table. The place has it's own old-school charm, including sawdust on the floors. Still, the casual cafeteria set-up can't compete with Cole's authentic turn-of-the-century look and feel. ADVANTAGE: COLE'S. SERVICE The sit-down service available at Cole's was solid. Our waiter was friendly and attentive. At Philippe's, you wait at the counter as your meat is hand-carved. I guess you could give Cole's the edge because they have a wait staff, but that's not exactly fair; it's comparing apples to oranges. ADVANTAGE: TOSS-UP. �FRENCH DIP: OVERALL TASTE Let's compare the beef and lamb dips at both places. Cole's beef and lamb were tender and meaty with a moist shredded texture, like the consistency of a good pot roast. 蔜hey also give you the choice of adding different cheeses. I went with the blue cheese. The sharpness of the melted cheese, tender meat, and soaked french roll was a great combination. Philippe's beef and lamb are of comparable quality, but their texture is quite different. 蔜hink more in terms of nice, meaty hand-carved slices. 蔛erved on a good-sized roll, Philippe's hot mustard (horseradish is clearly an ingredient) gives their dips a great zesty kick. I buy a jar of mustard on most visits. Both dips are great, but at the end of the day, Cole's has just a bit more soaked-in flavor than the simple carved meats at Philippe's. The cheese option also helps put them over the top. ADVANTAGE: COLE'S. FRENCH DIP: THE AU JUS I grew up dipping my french dips, and Cole's automatically serves a cup of flavorful au jus on the side. At Philippe's, the au jus is darker and a bit saltier, but not as naturally "meaty" in flavor as Cole's. Philippe's also "pre-dips" their bread at the counter (once or twice depending on your preference), but sometimes, you just can't get the bread juicy enough unless you dip it yourself. 蔍f you ask for dip on the side, sometimes they're accommodating, but I've also run into one lady at the counter who actually refused, saying something like it was against their "policy!" It's au jus folks, not gold! ADVANTAGE: COLE'S. FRENCH DIP: PORTION SIZE Cole's tends to be a bit stingy with the meat. If you order their "big dipper," which is supposed to include more meat, it's nearly comparable to the regular-sized hand-carved portions at Philippe's. The bread also seems smaller at Cole's, but I'd need to put them side by side to be sure. ADVANTAGE: PHILIPPE'S. SIDES It's hard to go wrong with Cole's bacon potato salad or tomato soup. 蔜heir complementary spicy "atomic" pickles are a nice touch too. At Philippe's, sides tend to be fairly small and pedestrian in flavor (cole slaw, potato salad, etc.). I think these were an afterthought. 蔄DVANTAGE: COLE'S. VALUE My major knock on Cole's is the price. In order to get comparable sandwich portions as Philippe's, you really need to order their "big dipper" with your choice of meat. Each "big dipper" is just shy of $10 per sandwich-- a few bucks more than Philippe's. Cole's sides are also kind of pricey, with some (including the bacon potato salad) over $4.00 per cup. For a more stark comparison, a glass of lemonade at Philippe's will cost you 75 cents. Cole's charges $3.00. At Cole's, we ordered two big dippers, two sides (a cup of bacon potato salad and a cup of tomato soup), 1 lemonade, 1 cocktail, and a piece of pie. Including tip, our bill was just over $58.00. 蔊ranted, Cole's has sit-down service and Philippe's does not, but at the end of the day, you're still eating two modest-sized sandwiches with some extras. ADVANTAGE: PHILIPPE'S. �While Cole's prices hurt them in my book, the bottom line has to be about taste and overall experience, which makes Cole's the overall winner. In other words, if your diet consisted of nothing but french dips, you'd do just fine going to Philippe's everyday while saving a few pennies and treating yourself to Cole's at the end of the week. WINNER: COLE'S.

"Original" means so many things to KC. The upside of original includes a classic car, a mid century modern home, an innovative musician or a great friend that is like no other. The downside of original is that old rusty fishing pole in your parents' rafters, granny underwear, "that guy is a piece of work...let's ditch him" friend, or a tired, angry, formerly famous person. Call it hype not meeting expectations, but KC just doesn't get the pearl of L.A. known as Philippe The Original Restaurant. If you haven't yet been to this place, here are the highlights: * long lines * sad, downtrodden staff * poor people watching * cafeteria style at best...complete with lunch lady throwbacks * fat, skin infused lamb...so gross...see the photo * grocery store potato salad * cans of soda...no fountain drinks KC couldn't even finish his lamb dip. This very handsome Yelper literally had to deconstruct this abomination to pick the meat off the skin and gristle. Not awesome. Here's an original idea: Go to Cole's.

I always find myself torn when ordering here. Beef or pork French dip sandwich? Single dip or double dip? Macaroni or coleslaw? Tapioca or custard? At the very least, I know I want a lemonade. Since I am always torn between items on their menu (because everything is so darn good!), I always dine with at least one other person. That way, I can sample from others' plates without regret. I've been a fan for at least 12 years now and I would consider this on the top of my "Must Eat" in LA. It's a historic and cultural landmark for sure.

Good sandwiches but a bit on the small side. I had the beef dip which was good especially with the spicy mustard. Philippe's is good but I think I was expecting more with all the hype about how good this place is. Oh, and I don't really like walking up to a counter that made me feel like I was in a high school cafeteria. And parking can be a bit of a hassle. The recurring word I've used is good. It's what it is but what Philippe's is not is great. Still, Philippe's is worth a visit to decide for yourself considering all the dedicated followers that swear by it. In my humble opinion I think Cole's is a better dip.

The best thing about working in downtown LA a few years back was dining here at Philippe's. I was finally able to bring the hubby here for a kid free lunch, just when I thought he couldn't love me any more! I decided to keep it simple for him since it was his first time so we ordered 2 beef double-dipped sandwiches with swiss cheese and and two orders of potato salad along with a pickle and a slice of chocolate cake to share for dessert. MMMMM...MmMmM...mmmm...was all I could understand from my husband between bites. He even had a beer to celebrate his first but most definitely NOT his last time eating at Phiippes. We both loved the potato salad almost as much as the sandwich. While we didn't have my children with us this time, I will absolutely bring them with us the next time. It's definitely a kid-friendly place with an atmosphere that they would love! They serve breakfast til 10:30 but you can get their beef dip sandwich first thing in the morning. I may just have venture to here on the weekend for some breakfast with a side of beef dip!

Welp. We went for the history, rumors of being amazing and a must go. Not so much. Walking in as first timers and probably only timers, there was a little confusion where to go and order. 蔜here was an array of people here from old ladies talking about cheesecake and job loss to the upwardly mobile business men from across the freeway. I can see how this place is convenient for people who work and live close but not worth an hour drive. We went for the typical beef French dip. I am in love with salt, salt and more salt but this was toooo salty for me. The bread maintains it's crunchy exterior which I enjoyed but by the end of the sandwich, I had a bitter saltiness in my mouth that had to be washed away by my cola. Adam enjoyed the potato salad, I didnt care for it. Still it was cool to check this place off my list and visit a classic.

I saw Philippe's on Anthony Bourdain's show and had to check it out. Positives -- the beef is good, so is the dip. Like a previous reviewer mentioned, ask for it dipped twice. Ordering it with the default leaves it sort of half damp, half dry. And, you don't get extra to dip it in later. The sandwich is small, so order two. I ate mine and my daughters. Luckily, she wasn't that hungry, so she didn't starve this time. The lemonade is decent and only 75 cents. Everything is a la carte, there were no inclusive lunch deals that I noticed. Chips, pickle, potato salad, cole slaw, all extra add ons (and can add up quickly $$). The restaurant is busy, but has a nostalgic, throwback feel to it. I liked it. Negatives -- The staff is a little rude. They could be more friendly and helpful. Also, my wife wasn't big on the fact that the staff don't wear hairnets and don't wear gloves, then pick the roast beef up with their hands, putting it into the bread, and smashing it into the au jus. Then handing it to each customer, all without gloves or frequent hand washing. I figure it's all part of the authenticity, a few stomach aches afterward won't kill me. Overall, glad I stopped. But not necessarily AMAZING enough to warrant many return visits.

I really wanted to like this place but too many things stacked up in the perfect storm of meh. �I got a sandwich with swiss, macaroni salad, and a soda. 蔜he soda was just in a can, because it's apparently too difficult for a restaurant that's supposedly an LA institution to get a soda machine. 蔜heir fancy lemonade, while good, was not worth the charge for the small single glass. 蔜he macaroni salad was good, and standard. 蔔othing special there, although I will say I'm impressed that they found a way to make homemade macaroni salad taste like consistent store-bought, whether that's a good thing or not. 蔜he sandwich was disappointing. 蔍 guess I should have gotten mine double dipped, because I got it just standard standard standard. 蔜he small bread made for a disappointing sandwich, but I think the worst part was the beef. 蔍t was dry and tough and there wasn't even a lot of it on the sandwich. 蔜he house special mustard tasted like any spicy mustard I've had from a grocery store. �The atmosphere was weird too. 蔜he old, almost antique pictures up on the walls were kind of cool. 蔜he candy counter was just strange. 蔜he people....oh the people. 蔍t's not the restaurant's fault so the rating doesn't have to do with this, but it has to be said. 蔜here were about 5 people in the full house who I thought didn't need a slap. 蔅etween the homeless people taking washcloth and sink showers in the bathroom to the dozens of kids screaming and yelling and running and crying with dozens of parents blissfully ignoring them....I wanted to leave the minute that I stepped in. 蔜he parking was nice though, they had a lot behind the place and a lot across the minor street out in front. �I had high standards for this place but it didn't even get close. 蔒aybe it was a bad day or maybe I've been to Portillo's too many times, but it just seems like another empty "iconic" restaurant catering to locals who don't know what they're missing.

You can't call yourself an Angelino until you've tried Philippe The Original Restaurant!!!!! There are several ways to go, but I got a ($6)Beef Sandwich double dipped (extra au jus in the bread) ($1.20) potato salad ($.79) glass of lemonade. add some spicy mustard the sandwich for a extra sting! The sandwich's are a bit small if you are really hungry, but at least I can call myself a real Angelino!

Why hello there history!! Bring cash! 蔖hilippes dont take any but, lines arent super long but you do have to wait...theres different windows open so its not as bad Ordered a beef sandwich with american cheese & pork sandwich jack cheese with a side of mac salad. Beef sandwich is delish...thinly sliced with the cheese being just SLIGHTLY melted. 蔠ith the beef being so thin, it def soaked up the juice better and give this airy feel. 蔜he beef is one of those beef that you can actually taste the beefiness but not in a bad way. 蔣ou get a lot of beef too The pork sandwich i didnt like so much cause the pieces were a lil thicker so the flavor didnt get soaked like the beef did. �Mac salad was HELLA good though! 蔍t didnt make me feel "heavy" like with overloaded mayo or so, you can taste the dressing as well as the celery pieces. 蔖lus its good on the sandwich too =) Mustard...be warned...its not spicy like a tabasco hit...but its a horseradish hot!...totally forgot to look that up before i splatter a whole bunch on my sandwich and also cried my eyes up with the burning sensation in my nose clear all kinds of blockage. Sandwich is small though so dont expect to be super full and sandwich generally goes for 6+ if you want the cheese and expect to rub elbows with some strangers =)

Why can't we give 3 1/2 stars? Sometimes a girl just needs a half. I came here for lunch on a Saturday afternoon, completely unprepared for the hour wait. The lines were so long people were taking pictures of it, and now that I think about it, I should have as well to show just how ridiculous it can be. I say that kindheartedly, though, because I had fun and I actually thought the wait added to the experience. Sometimes anticipation is the best part. Anyway, on to the food. I ordered the double dipped beef french dip , potato salad, and blueberry pie- hey if you're going to wait an hour for your lunch you'd better go all the way. I heard double dipped was the way to go, but my experience was it made parts of the sandwich far too soggy. The meat was tender, juicy, and just fatty enough. The potato salad was too sweet for me, although I didn't see a lot of relish in there it was obvious there was too much. My favorite part of the meal was the blueberry pie. The crust was very buttery, just the way I like it. There was a ton of filling, and although it was a little jammy, I very much enjoyed it. Somewhat important note, while this was a late lunch (3pm) it kept me so full I didn't end up eating dinner, and that never happens! Final thoughts, I had a good experience and although I quite liked the food (minus potato salad) I wasn't blown away. Oh, and beware, CASH ONLY. There are ATMs inside, though.

I went to Philippes ready to hate it. My friends had been building it up all weekend and I kept thinking, "No way is it going to have the best french dipped sandwiches ever". But the sandwiches were damn good. Damn good! And the restaurant itself was a blast. The private rooms upstairs are a lawless zone where anything goes. My friends and I destroyed ours while preparing for FYF. Beer, gin, sake EVERYWHERE! I'm not sure if the sandwiches were small, or if I was just so impressed with them that I wanted more, but I could have eaten ten of those delicious little devils. I hope to come back here again the next time I'm in LA. Maybe explore Chinatown a little after wards. Oh and I got the beef sand which btw, triple dipped (although that's not what they called it, they called it soaked or something).

My sister turned 20 yesterday and being downtown we all decided why not come to philippes. After waiting in line for 20 minutes (including being cut in front of by some cops) we order. Our sandwich order was pretty simple: three turkey sandwiches only one of which was french dipped. Well the order came out wrong and we were told that we would have to wait in line AGAIN for the right order. So we finally got our order and the sandwich was AMAZING. Minus two stars for having to wait TWICE for the sandwich though.

How to cure a stuffy nose. 蔛lather mustard onto your double french dipped sandwich. I love Philippes. 蔍t's managed to stay relatively the same through its 100+ years of being opened. 蔍t has that old classic feel and grandmas working at the counter. 蔇on't discount their skill though, cuz boy do they make a mean double dipped sandwich. 蔍 opt to go with the lamb, which I think is better than the beef. 蔜he coleslaw and tato salads are delicious, the soups are full of flavor, and do not skimp out on the mustard. 蔣ou order at the counter and pick a line... any line. 蔆ash only!

Dear Lord dear Lord!! A mouthful of awesomenes!! This is what describes Phillippes!! I went with my bf for the first time a while back & went on a dinner date just last week again. This place has the best French dips ever!! Not to the mention the chili being in full effect here!! I ordered a Lamb French dip that was double dipped with jack cheese, 蕀eaning dipped in the broth twice haha self explanatory & then a side of potato salad, pickled beets, and chili straight (no beans). The tables provide their famous wasabi mustard & I usually build my dip with chili & tons of mustard..what a fabulous combination!!! The potato salad has a kind of a light, sweet taste that is really good. The chili is one of the best I've had with cheese & onions. Ice tea & lemonade are 65 cents & sandwhiches are about $6 max. Super cheap date meal here but definitely an L.A. landmark. Will be back SOON!!

When my friend told me to meet up here because she's been coming here since a kid I expected a tiny corner storefront. But upon arrival I was blown away by how big the place was how packed it was too. So next came the food, which comes quickly but only after you wait in line which could be a bit long but well worth it. Any sandwich double dipped and with a nice side of macaroni salad or potato salad is a perfect way to go. The atmosphere is friendly and you feel like you're in another time w/ all the history and memorabilia all over the place. It's definitely a must stop on my trips to LA now. Gladly adding this place to my "must eat when I'm there" list.

Classic Los Angeles. As advertised, the french dip sandwich was pretty great, and even better with an ice cold beer to wash it down. There are a few different options to try (including turkey). Try some macaroni salad on the side too! Gets crowded, but dont let that scare you away. There is plenty of parking and plenty of seating (just walk around to the back). Prices were very reasonable.

We went to Phillippe's before heading out to Yosemite for a weekend of camping and hiking. This was my 1st time here. My friend said it was good and I remembered having seen it as being top 10 sandwich places on Food Network or Travel Channel. Anyhow, my boyfriend did the ordering and we just shared the sandwich. I was a bit disappointed. It was salty. Pretty salty. I didn't finish my half of the sandwich. I'm not sure if I'd go back but if I'm in the neighborhood, maybe I'll give it another go. Sandwich: OK a bit salty Atmosphere: Old school feeling with lots of "hay" on the ground. Pretty neat

I don't know what happened on my first trip here 2 years ago in 2008, but the first experience at Philippe's did not impress me. The french dipped sandwich with cheese was small and dry and one left me hungry still. Fast forward to now. After waiting in the long line (which was sort of good because it gave me time to decide on what to order), I settled on a beef french dipped sandwich, a pork french dipped sandwich, a piece of boysenberry pie, and a glass of lemonade. My God, it was a fantastic meal! This time around, the sandwiches (even without cheese) was delicious! You could really taste the au jus in each bite; the bread was so mouthwatering. Adding a little bit of mustard adds a kick to the sandwich. The lemonade was a bit light and watery for me, but it was a steal at 75 cents. The pie was the perfect end to the meal. The boysenberry pie was freshly baked, the crust nice and flaky, and you couldn't tell how much of the fruit was in it until you started digging into the slice. So so good. Result: @_@ food coma and walking it off around Chinatown.

A Los Angeles hotspot since I guess 1908 In my opinion Philippe's has the most delicious French dipped sandwich I have ever had. This place is really old and it shows when you walk through the doors. This place has sawdust on the floor and old telephone booths also it's family style seating with old long wooden tables and love the old neon soft drink and beer signs. I have been coming here since I was a little girl for almost 30 years. My mom and I would come to this place with my grandmother for a French dipped roast beef sandwich after going to church at Olvera Street. 蔍 now come with my husband and now my favorite is the lamb sandwich and I love it double dipped with some delicious potatoe salad and a lemonade. They have a really hot mustard that is made in house and must be used sparingly as it is very hot french mustard. Prices have gone up through out the years but still love this place and it brings back old memories everytime we go. They have a brick wall on the second floor where a lot of people have craved their names and we have our names carved on that wall. Amazing French dipped sandwich!

This place has a great French Dip indeed but the service leaves a bad taste in your mouth. I saw an episode on the food network and thought I'd give it a try. When you walk in your automatically thrown into the chaos, and don't know which line to be in, as there are no clear markers. You get up to the counter and then have to maneuver your way back thru the line carrying your food on a tray. If you order the sandwich I suggest you ask to have it 'wet' as the 'once dipped' is only a brush of au jus. I'm giving the 3 star only based on the taste. The service was HORRIBLE and you have to pay $6 just for the sandwich, no chips or soda come with it. If you order a soda you get one in a can, and the cashier acted put out when I asked for a cup of ice. And when it comes time to pay, they have a tiny tray to place your money on, our cashier refused to take it from my hand. And when you go, they only take cash, but they have 2 ATM machines inside. If I 蔳o back I would only order to go.

Maybe I didn't get it, but the french dip may be over-hyped. I did enjoy all the history that came with our trip to Philippe's, unfortunately the actual sandwich left me hungry for some flavor. I got the beef french dip just the way it comes. No double dip and maybe that is where I went wrong. The sandwich was a bit bland and 蔍 won't be back but I'm glad I went to try it for myself.

Okay. Came here on recommendation of my co worker and unfortunately she didn't mention that it takes a million years to get a sandwich. Seriously though, slowest service EVER. I thought i'd be dead or passed out by the time i reached the register. slowest service ever. && to make matters worse you have to stand in line the entire time, you dont have an option to sit, sigh. Call me a lazy American but hey im just saying. On the bright side I very much enjoyed my BEEF sandwich. It was way better in comparison to the lamb sandwich from what all you yelpers say is amazing. Pfft. BEEF BEEF BEEF. Thankfully I got both the lamb and the beef one. If i would've just had the lamb I wouldn't have been a very happy camper. Oh be sure to tru the spicy mustard of course.

No mess, no fuss experience. Ok well maybe a little mess. :P Had lunch with my coworker today, and we beat the lunch rush by arriving at 12pm. 蔠hen we finally left, the lines were huge. Got the beef sandwich with Swiss cheese, single dipped, so I could try the bread both soggy and dry. And a side of pickles. The pickles were $1.10 for 4 wedges! 蔔ext time, I'm bringing my own. 蔜he pickles were a little too salty in my opinion. Shared the potato salad with my coworker, and that was pretty good. 蔆urious to try the purple eggs! The lady at the counter told me that the eggs are marinated with beets. 蔍nteresting.... Beef sandwich was good. I preferred the side that was not dipped, because the bread was nice and crispy. Meat was moist, and not too dry. I tried the hot mustard and it was really strong. It had lots more horseradish then mustard but gave the sandwich a good kick. Prices are a bit high in my opinion for what you get. �8.45 for a beef sandwich w/ cheese and a side pickles. 蔒y lunch splurge for the next 2 weeks. :P Overall, a good place to grab a quick, no fuss lunch.

I like the french dip sandwiches there because sometimes I have a craving for one. I think you really have to find the right counter lady to make you a good sandwich. I am still searching for the right one. I always like the roast beef french dip (I get it Double Dipped). The sides are pretty good. The Cole slaw, potato salad, and macaroni salad are all pretty tasty. They do not feel heavy or too light at all. They each have their own flavor to it. I always like to get an apple pie for dessert. The apple pie is not to sweet and not too bland. It has a good texture to it and you can taste the sweetness and cinnamon from the fillings they add to it. The apples are real apples when you actually look at the pie slice. Make sure to bring cash because this place does not accept any other forms of payment except for cash!!!

Reason I come here is their Chili. Customer service sucks. I hate that they dont take card. Its dirty. Their french dip has too much hype. Being one of the oldest restaurants in LA is has accumulated too much. I come alot cause I live close by.

Better French dip at Arby's. 蔠hat a waste of time, money and gas. 蔍t's way over-rated and always overcrowded. 蔜he beef was fatty and pretty tasteless. 蔍 honestly don't see what the hype is all about. 蔍 got a french dip at Arby's a couple of days later, paid less, and it actually had flavor. How you can mess up sliced meat, gravy and bread is beyond me.

I gotta be honest, I'm not a fan. I know, that might be speaking against the masses and this may be blasphemy but I'm speaking from my unbiased hungry heart. I've been here more than a half dozen times, always trying to give it a second and third chances by trying different things from the menu, added and subtracted options but to no avail. Whatever the case, single dipped, double dipped, pork, lamb, with or without cheese - Philippe's is just missing something for me. 蔍 even doused my sandwiches with the hot mustard, which actually has a lot more bite than flavor. The meat is tender [I prefer the lamb], the bread is soft but it just doesn't have enough flavor for my liking. Flavor to me is everything. Maybe it's because I'm not a fan of french dips? In that case, french dips need to a makeover as a whole. Phillippe's, it's not you, it's me.

I was a far better person before I was introduced to this place. At least, I was a far thinner person! Now, what am I going to do??? O_o It's a violation of all human principle for this place to exist. Like I just got la*d by a new lover. And unlike a dirty one-night-stand, this one promises to give it to me from 6am to 10pm daily. O_O Just *why* couldn't I control myself & stop ripping the mega-moist lamb meat from its carbo-counterpart? I had to practically smack myself to stop. And then I poured the hot mustard on for a bite... It's aux jus terribly wrong. At first buy, I thought the package was too small, but then I got schooled about the value of not judging by size (again). Now, it's 8:00am, & I've reported for duty, straight outta' bed & zombified. I was enjoying the field; now I'm all strung out again. This place needs its own Betty Ford inpatient program.

Ehh...it's ok. I liked the tomato bisque soup of the day. The spicy mustard was really good. The double dipped beef dip was ok. I liked how the bread was soggy and easy to eat because I had a cankersore :( Anyways, came here once to try. Wouldn't necessarily come back again. It's not that great.

Wow! Just standing in line to get a very special dipped sandwich, looking at all the old signs, the decor, the benches, and the people was great! After a day of perusing Santee Alley and getting my first tour of the Garment District, and some amazing coaching by my fashion guru friend, it was a perfect stop to ease the feet and feed the soul. Watching the rapid-fire ordering and sandwich making process was fascinating. I tried the Turkey Dipped sandwich which was great! 蔜he sauce was just right, and the turkey was delicious and moist. My friend had the Beef Dipped sandwich, which is one of her favorites. 蔍t is now one of my newly constructed "tour for my family" when they come to visit Los Angeles. 蔖lus it is pretty close to Olvera Street and lots of historic areas. Thanks, Philippe! I hope you stick around for a long time to come.

I think its overrated for what it is. If it weren't the "Original" french dip, this place would be forgettable at best. While its nice to experience the french dip in the historical context of things, I'm not sure that's good enough to make this more than average. Don't get me wrong, I'd recommend it for a first time visit or if its convenient...but its really not that outstanding.

Did they invent the French Dip? Who knows, but I sure do enjoy eating here. This place can get very busy and over whelming with the crowds but I promise you it is worth it. I couldn't tell you exactly which on is my favorite sandwich but I guess I would have to go with the beef. Be sure to ask them to double dip it too. Remember to bring cash.

Sacre bleu! 蔜his classic LA lunch institution was as big of a disappointment as their large sandwiches. 蔄nd to think that I was actually looking forward to my visit as much as the amazing Langer's Deli. �I'm as big of a fan of classic french dip sandwiches for under $6 as the next guy, but I would pay extra for quality than shell out six bucks to only pay for reputation and hype. 蔊ood value? 蔍 beg to differ as the old adage that you get what you pay for certainly rings true here. 蔜ake the classic #19 from Langer's, for example, it has a hefty price tag of $15, but certainly worth every penny. Philippe's andwiches are quite huge and they pile on a fair amount of meat. 蔜he sandwich I received, however, was served at room temperature and the meat was bone dry, which was especially ironic, since not only was it supposed to be a french dip sandwich, but I since I also ordered mine double dipped. 蔍'm not sure the best way to describe it, but if there is an antonym for succulent, this might be it. On a positive note, the mac salad and potato salad sides were pretty darn good, as was the apple pie. �To be honest, I was never into French dip sandwiches to begin with. 蔄fter hearing/reading/watching a great deal about this place, I had to visit. 蔜his place claims to have invented French dip sandwiches. 蔍f so, they may have invented it, but that doesn't mean that much. 蔎ames Naismith invented basketball, but that doesn't mean I'd take him over Kobe Bryant. The restaurant itself has an outdated feel, which I can appreciate to be part of its charm. 蔈ven the cash only payment was antiquated, though they do offer two ATM machines that charge $3 per transaction, so I guess that part of the deal was up to date. The LA food scene is full of solid options that I likely wont find my way back to Philippe. 蔅ut it's good to check out the classics from time to time.

The only French dip that tops this place is Greenblatt's, but this French dip is half the price of that one. 蔍 always get the beef French-dip, double-dipped in au jus with a side of coleslaw and banana cream pie for dessert. 蔄sk for some swiss cheese in your sandwich and you're set! 蔍'm not one for mustard but theirs is just so good and adds some punch to the meal. 蔎ust a small dollop on each bite and you're good to go. The banana cream pie here is the best banana cream pie I've ever had, anywhere. 蔍ced teas are $0.65 and lemonades are $0.75!! They have a cute little retro candy bar by the door with some of their souvenir items. I would actually like to give this place 3.5 stars but unfortunately I can't. 蔅lah!

This is my first time ever eating a french dipped sandwich and I am left a big fan. I was pretty skeptical seeing as how I really hate my bread being soggy. But I watched them dip the sandwiches and its not like they dump them in the sauce.. it is only the top bread getting lightly dunked into the sauce. I would recommend to ask for double dipped to get more of the flavor or else the meat may be a bit dry. We came on a wednesday afternoon around 2 and was super hungry. We ordered a beef dipped and pork dipped sandwich, lemonade, ice tea, coffee togo, bowl of chili, macaroni salad, potato salad and coleslaw FOR TWO PEOPLE! HAHA The total only came out to be like $25!! Anyways, firstly the worst of everything was the coffee.. it is literally hot coffee with 5 pieces of ice added to it.. so its like luke warm coffee by the time you drink it. The chili was super hearty, we got it with no beans but with onions and cheese! YUMMM the cheese just melted in your mouth. I am not a fan of the beef dipped sandwich, the pork was INFINITELY SO MUCH BETTER! My boyfriend traded with me.. cuz I couldn't even finish it! Also, I am not a big lover of coleslaw.. but this was pretty damn good. It blew the potato and macaroni salad of the water!!! Anyways, for a hefty $25.. this was an enjoyable meal.. wish I had some fries or something too tho! :( PROS: PORK french dipped sandwich coleslaw $.75 lemonade (a tad too sweet) $.75 ice tea! Chili THE PRICES!! CONS: Beef dipped sandwich Coffee togo Macaroni salad Not alot of parking The ladies are sometimes really rude PACKED during lunch time Ran out of the lamb dipped sandwiches!

When I'm on Alameda in Downtown, I'm always tempted by the big blue sign that read Philippe's. This corner sandwich shop just blows my mind with how perfect they get everything from the food to the hay on the floor to the seating area up stairs tagged with patrons' names. Be sure to get your sandwich double dipped, and the cheese that barely melts adds a perfect kick to your sandwich. I prefer the beef, and I'm always tempted to order the little piece of heavenly cheesecake to top off my meal. The lemonade and ice tea are PERFECT! Sip a little of both then add both together to make the greatest tasting Arnold Palmer. The menu is overbearing because everything on the menu is pretty much delicious, and claustrophobia may strike in a packed room with long lines, but the food makes it alright. Oh, and I have no idea why the workers are so mean. They always act stoic and rarely smile, but I don't care because they're making my yummy sandwich!

The sandwiches are not the greatest but they're still delicious and you can't beat the history and atmosphere of a true L.A. landmark! I've seen a lot of Philippe's virgins at this place in recent years and they don't tip the nice lunch ladies who work behind the counter. 蔜he regulars know that it's customary to leave a little tip for the ladies who make your sandwiches and prepare your meal with loving care. 蔖lease be kind and leave a little tip to show your appreciation to your Philippe's server. �) Also another inside tip, if seating gets too crowded on the first floor there's more seating, and a quieter vibe, upstairs.

So, I expect to hear some sort of backlash here, but i've got to tell it like it is. 蔍'm willing to admit that maybe it was an off night, or maybe I didn't order properly, but this place was not all that exciting. �Stood in the long line that moved quickly, thankfully. 蔠e weren't sure of exactly how to order; like, what comes on the sandwiches, etc. 蔜he woman at the counter was not nice or helpful. 蔕rdered a lamb sandwich and a beef sandwich. 蔄lso got some beef chili and some iced tea. �The sandwiches were just ok; no real flavor. 蔋ooked up some pepper and some mustard, which made it better for sure. 蔅ut, at that point, aren't we complimenting condiments? 蔜he lamb was better than the beef, I thought, but the jus had no flavor and that's what this place is known for! 蔜he chili was pretty decent and the iced tea was super mediocre. 蔄s others have said, it had clearly been sitting on the counter with ice, waiting for someone to order it. By no means was it unpalatable, but four stars? 蔍 don't get it.

We ate at Philippe's this past Saturday. I have eaten here before and I didn't remember anything special about this place. However a few friends who haven't been wanted to see what they hype was all about. We ordered the Beef Dip Sandwich, Potato Salad, a Cup of Chili, and a Lamp Sandwich. All the dished tasted good. The group seem to like the potato salad and chili. We collectively thought the food was good, but thought that it wasn't worth the hype. I think all the notoriety comes from the fact that its the birth place of the french dip sandwich. The food was good, but I wouldn't say it was great. I think its worth a try if you haven't been, but don't have high expectations as some of my friends did. You may end up unimpressed. Sometimes all they hype can set some unreal expectations. Note: This place is Cash Only.

Have been coming here for at least 40 years (god I sound old), and decided to visit 蔲or lunch last Saturday. Parking is easy and looks ike they 蔱ven expanded parking to across the street. Sometimes you want your dining experience to be the same, as it can be very comforting knowing what to expect 蔖hillippe's did not disappoint. Ordered beef dips, pickles, cole slaw, potato salad, and banana creme pie. It was perfect!. Bread was not too soft, yet held the au jus just right. Mustard was spicy and gave the sanwich a little kick. Both salads complimented the pickle & sandwich perfectly. And the banana creme pie! When walking toward our seat, several people came up to us and asked us about the banana creme pie! 蔔ostalga set in and I could see my grandmother and father (both who 蔴ave passed), sitting in the corner booths for our Sunday dinner. My grandma knew the cashiers and the gentleman who used to sell the newspapers and gum in the corner, so it was always a nice visit. Please do not change. Continue to provide the quality service and ambiance as you always do, and we will continue to return. p.s. thank goodness we had cash, forgot they only accept cash.

Honestly, nothing special at all. It's only nice to say that you've eaten here but I would not ever come back. First, the lines are ridiculously long and disorganized. Second, the French dip sandwich is not tasty at all. Even with a TRIPLE dip, I could barely taste the au jus. It's only when I put A LOT of the "spicy mustard" that there was actually some flavor. The potato salad was also not something to write home about. I did enjoy the beef chili though. I could've just eaten a bowl of that instead of the sandwich. The rice tapioca was also decent. And at 75 cents the lemonade is pretty decent too. Overall, I would not suggest coming here unless you want to say that you have.

Five stars, I don't give this rating out too often because everything about the business has to be something I truly love. Philippe to me isn't about the best French dip in LA or the 9 cent cups of coffee, its about the sense of community that continues to thrive in this restaurant for over 100 years. Philippe is a microcosm of Los Angeles. When you walk into the restaurant, there are Poor, Middle class, Elites, Black, Mexican, White, Asianese, Emo, Hipster, Gay, Straight, Bi, Cholos, Gangstas etc... Los Angeles' population is as diverse as any city in the world and the clientele of Philippe reflects this well. Like LA, Philippe has opened up its arms to everyone and anyone. In addition, what I love about Philippe are the community tables where all these people from different backgrounds sit together, enjoy their food in harmony and may even strike up a conversation on topics such as "What news lady is the Mayor hitting up next?" The overall feeling of the place promotes "Unity in the Community" and all because of a simple bread and meat sandwich that's dipped in fatty goodness. This place continues to value its traditions from continuing to have ladies at the counter that barely speak English to the uneven pulpy paper plates that seem to hold up well even if it's drenched in the Au jus. I just love this place, if I were to take a stranger that isn't familiar with LA, I would take them here. They would experience the long lines which represent the ridiculous amount of traffic on the streets and freeways; we would sit at one of those community tables shoulder to shoulder with strangers from different backgrounds representing the incredibly diverse population we all seem to live with in a cohesive manner. and Finally, we would look outside the windows and see the new up and coming LA with its new skyscrapers, new glitzier downtown and remind ourselves of places like Philippe, where new lights, fancy glass windows and clean sterile sidewalks are put aside for the promotion of community and the exclusion of no one. P.s. The banana cream pie is to die for. The end.

The men's bathroom upstairs is the best bathroom in Los Angeles. It's haunted by Cary Grant. He will offer advice while you are taking a shit. If you go to the one downstairs to take a dump, a tourist from the Midwest will misfire at the urinal and wet your shoes. Order the lamb double dip with a coffee, a lemonade, a pickled egg and a slice of pie. Stay for forty minutes after you eat.

The home of the french dip, you can't go wrong with this place. Actually, you can. They had to shut down a couple years ago for a little while due to a major cockroach infestation. Anyhow, the place definitely has a cafeteria feel to it with long tabletop benches and sawdust on the floor. The old school dresses of the cashiers will take you back to an era when swing was hip, hair was greasy and diners were chic. pros: amazing french dip sandwiches. I love their mustard, it's quite amazing, like wasabi. It's nice that they've got a parking lot behind the restaurant and across the street. cons: this place gets crowded and the lines are always long. It's cash only, which can be inconvenient.

WTF people? This place sucks! Maybe French dipped sandwiches are not for me. I came here twice and both times I left this place feeling "why the hell is this place popular?" First time I came here was with coworkers several years ago. I had no idea what to order, so I ordered the ham sandwich. It was mehhh, nothing special. After watching the travel/food network and how they said it was a LA institution, I had to try it again. Off to Philippe's again, this time I ordered their world famous French beef dip sandwich. G-dangit, this sandwich was worst then their ham sandwich I tried years ago. Bread should not be soggy and beef should not be dry. I just want to slap people that order their ribeye/filet well done. Ambiance: Old rustic feel. Sawdust and wood chips on the floor...felt kinda dirty. Service: Walkup counters. Order and pickup, but dang are they slow. They handle the money and food without changing plastic gloves...wtf! Food: Soggy bread and dry meat.

I am a huge French dip connoisseur! 蔍 take into account the bread, roast beef, and the dip when judging a French dip. 蔜he bread was crunchy and roast beef was flavorful, but my biggest beef (pun unintended) with this place is that they won't give you a side of the juice. 蔍 like to dunk my sandwich into the juice. 蔈ven though I got the "double dip," it was pretty much like a regular roast beef sandwich, which I can get at any other place...without the sticky tables. 1 star off: need more juicy dip 1 star off: need less sticky tables

We all tried the beef french dip ($6.00 each) and it was delicious!!! We added american cheese ($.90 each) and my bf overheard someone saying you can get the bread double dipped...so we had them double dip our bread too =) At first I was worried that my bread was going to be too soggy and I wouldn't be able to hold it...but nope, they did it just right...enough au jus without being too soggy. Add a little hot mustard (they have a bottle on the table) to the french dip and it is perfect! Don't forget to get a bowl of chili and a side of potato salad! The bowl of chili was so good we stood in line for another 20 mins just to get another bowl. The potato salad was so good, that my son, who doesn't even eat potato salad, got a side order on our second go around. BTW, the sawdust on the floor adds a bit of charm to the whole experience.

Stellar sandwiches in an old-school, 1920s setting! Opened in 1908, Philippe's still holds its own after feeding Angelinos for over a century! 蔄s so many reviewers rightly point out, this place is famous for its French-dipped sandwiches. 蔅eef is the obvious favorite, though the pork and lamb are also awesome choices. 蔄dd a twist to your sandwich by adding a slice of cheese for added flavor/twist. �Personal Favorite: 蔐amb with Blue Cheese!) [Tip: 蔍f you like your sandwiches on the moister/wet side, ask for a side of gravy "au jus" and you can double dip your sandwich.] The finishing touch, is, of course, their famous dijon mustard! 蔄vailable at every table, you can buy a small jar to take home if you love it. �It puts Grey Poupon to shame!) The side salads are also solid compliment the sandwiches in a wonderful way. 蔉reshly made cole slaw, potato salad, and macaroni salad are all excellent. 蔜heir chili is also surprisingly good. Desserts: 蔖ies and cakes! 蔐emon meringue, carrot cake, chocolate cake, etc! 蔍f you've still got room after a sandwich or two, you can opt for some great sweets. 蔅ummer, however, is you've either got to order all at once, or stand in line a second time around. Recent Bummers: 蔄s of September 2011, in spite of the great food, prices have gone up, and the once 5-cent cup 'o coffee has gone away. 蔍nflation and tougher economic times force change, I guess! 蔖hilippe's falls short of a 5th star due to these changes. Service: 蔛traightforward and easy. 蔜he ladies working the counters, dressed in old-fashioned garb and headpieces, are old-timers who greet you with grandmotherly warmth and directness. 蔄 modest tip is expected, but not absolutely required. 蔐eave your plastic at home -- cash only! Ambiance: 蔞ery casual, with long benches, close-communal seating, and saw dust floors. 蔜here is also an old-style newsstand toward the main entrance where you can buy papers, magazines, and snacks. Parking/Crowds: 蔍t can get crazy-busy here during peak hours, so plan accordingly. 蔖arking has gotten better over the years since Philippe's acquired a parking lot across the street. 蔋owever, even then, it can be tough. 蔛treet parking can be challenging, so opt for the private lots. 蔖eak hours can leave you circling the lot searching for a spot. Great place to eat!!

One of my good friends always goes to Philippe's before the dodger game.... and let me tell you he goes to A LOT of games. After seeing him check in to the restaurant kazillion times, I was very excited to go before a dodgers game on Memorial day. The long lines were intimidating but man!! they sure know how to move those lines fast. I loved the old decor and very casual setting. It almost reminded me of the subway station back in the days. Food. I had the lamb dip sandwich. Bread was delicious but the meat was... on the salty side. Maybe it was just that day? Pork was awesome.

Dear Yelpers. �The sandwich is called a french dip for a reason, it is a roast meat sandwich dipped in the drippings. 蔍ts a strange sandwich, but a classic nonetheless, and this is what Phillippes serves (and apparently invented). Complaining about receiving a "soggy" sandwich, which you indeed ordered, is obnoxious. 蔣ou knew what you got into, and you are just being vengeful because the internet allows you to. �go eat your crappy subway sandwich.

I think it is because of all the hype, people expect a lot out of an establishment. 蔛o take away the hype, pretend a friend of yours tells you to try out this place, you're probably get a less biased review. I'll admit, all the hype made me think these would be the best of the best sandwiches out there. 蔍t is their specialty, but maybe not the best of the best. I ordered the pork sandwich, double dipped, and the rest of the group had the turkey, beef, and lamb. 蔜ried some of the lamb, nice flavor. 蔜he pork, I liked. 蔜he lemonade is great for the price. 蔍t was a late weeknight so we came after the rush. 蔍 didn't get a chance to try the sides, which is why I have to come back to this place. This place is not meant to be a zapper on your first and only visit, you gotta come back. 蔛o overall, set aside all the hype and what do YOU think? Four stars is what I think.

I've had a dipped sandwich at Red Robbins before and that wasn't so great.Came here and man this one is awesome!! The meat is tender, the bread is slightly toasted, man..melt in my mouth good!!!! I had the pork one and my fiance got the beef. Normally I can't stomach mac salad but their's is really good! I was amazed at seeing so many desserts they had! I have a big sweet tooth. 蔍'm definitely going to be coming back the next time I visit China Town.

With the number of reviews I was really hyped to try out Philippe's. It had the old school restaurant feel with sawdust all over the floor. They had about 7 different people taking orders and prepping the food. This place got crowded really fast. I wanted to really love the food here but I was just okay'd by it. I ordered the beef sandwich and my friend got the pork sandwich. We also got a side of macaroni salad and potato salad. We both split our sandwiches so that we could experience both. It came with a okay amount of meat and I used the hot mustard on mines. The hot mustard tasted like horseradish. If you like horseradish you'll love the hot mustard. I wish they put in cole slaw in the sandwich like Langer's does in their Pastrami sandwich. We also ended our dinner with a slice of apple pie. Everything was good but nothing impressive. Saw a lot of people order the chilli. I should've got that too. Recommendation: Beef sandwich w/ swiss and pork sandwich w/ swiss

What more can you say about this L.A. institution? 蔜here is no better french dip sandwich in L.A. 蔣ou can get beef, turkey, pork or lamb (the latter of which I prefer). 蔣ou either add cheese or not. 蔣ou get it single or double dipped (1 or 2 pieces of bread dipped). 蔣ou get your sides, which include: 蔯ole slaw, potato salad, macaroni salad, dill pickles, hot peppers, chips and numerous desserts. 蔜hey have great beer and wine options by the mug/glass. 蔜his place is old school but it is awesome. 蔍 am shocked that people complain about the prices; it is so inexpensive for what you get.

I've heard a lot about Philippe's and their French-dip sandwiches. I've seen this restaurant on TV quite a lot! My friends and I decided to go try it out one day, and I was excited to eat my first French-dip sandwich. And knowing this place was popular, I expected a lot of customers to be going in and out of this restaurant. I ordered a beef dip with a side order of a chili bowl, but as I ate it, I realized that the sandwich wasn't as juicy as I thought it would be, despite getting it double dipped. The meat was still somewhat dry and needed more flavor, but overall it was still good. I tried adding the spicy mustard sauce, and that gave it more flavor. And the chili bowl.. this was absolutely delicious. I was very glad to have ordered the chili on the side of my sandwich. There is a large variety of side orders and other things you can order on the menu at Philippe's! I heard the other sandwiches were good too, so I'll be coming back again to try the others, especially the lamb dip.

A friend took me here after telling me it was the best French Dip and banana cream pie he'd ever had. 蔔aturally, I was skeptical, but Philippe's does make a damn fine sandwich. I got the beef sandwich with Swiss cheese. 蔜he sandwich was surprisingly not soggy, but I would have liked some extra au jus to dip it in. 蔒aybe that option is available; I didn't ask. 蔜heir homemade hot mustard is pretty amazing though. 蔄nd the banana cream pie was outstanding. Overall, I want to give this 5 stars, but it's not quite destination dining. 蔍'd definitely eat here again though.

Classic Material. Amazing food for fair prices. My girlfriend has been trying to get me to try this for almost a year now. We finally went and I loved it. French dipped roast beef sandwich with potato salad and a Becks beer. The sandwich despite its size is VERY filling. It creeps up on you, just when you think your full, you get a little more full. It was great. Be prepared for a long line though, it is often out of the door. Its a staple to Los Angeles culture and I'm glad I got to try it out.

This place was hyped up like crazy. I would see it all over the food network and think.... damn those french dipped sandwiches look amazing, and they're cheap too?! I'm in. They are whatever. The bread smells delicious. The beef is relatively thin cut and is tender. Au jus is..well...au jus (FYI: it's pronounced OH-joo not aww-jew) I haven't tried the coleslaw but the potato salad 蔵s better than the macaroni salad in my opinion. The iced tea and lemonade are cheap ~75 cents. I've seen this place get packed within minutes, and parking is limited so avoid the lunch rush if possible. Also, there isn't just ONE line there are multiple so take a look around to find the shortest line. Pro: Cheap and delicious every now and then. Remember the potato salad. Con: Gets old fast. They get really busy, so if you're in a large party have someone scope out a table first.

Came here on a Sunday at around 7pm and the place was busy but not too bad, we waited about 15 minutes and it was well worth it. We ordered 2 beef sandwiches double dipped, a side of macaroni salad, and a pickled egg. This place really hit the spot. The sandwiches were delicious, the beef was juicy and tender and there was no fat in it whatsoever. The hot mustard was a great addition to the sandwich, it tasted more like horseradish though. Watch out it really clears the sinuses if you use too much. My bf got his with blue cheese slices and that was even better. Next time I would definitely add the cheese. The macaroni salad was alright, a little too much pickle in it for my taste but it's a good amount for only $1.15. The pickeled egg was just as I remember as a kid, I could have ate a whole jar myself!! Philippe's definitely lives up to the hype!

Ever heard the expression "the older I get, the better I was". The french dip reminds me of this. It's a place for people who like to say "they don't make things like they used to". I think of the place as a food museum, like the Ripley's Believe It or Not" on Hollywood Boulevard and think about how most people visit museums once in along while and usually with out-of-town guests. Considering the huge number of sandwich options that we have in L.A., the vietnamese, the cuban, father's office, Tommy's, etc, etc, you can drop the rank of Phillipe's 蕂n your '1001 sandwiches you must eat before you die' list.

I mean, seriously, it's 2011 and this place has been here FOREVER, and there are no signs of it slowing down. and for good reason. If you want your mind blown, get the beef with jack cheese, DOUBLE DIPPED. Add the awesome hot mustard. Grab a rice pudding for dessert, and a lemonade to wash it down.

It's cash only and a pretty popular LA dining establishment. Philippe's gets pretty crowded during peak hours so be aware of that. We've had to walk around a while to find a place to sit It's got a cool old school meat shop vibe to it. The French dip sandwiches (their signature item) all range in price from $6-7. The lamb sandwich is my personal favorite and the meat is so tender and juicy. I am getting a nice warm feeling now just thinking about it. I am only going with 3 stars because I don't know if it deserves all the hype. Its great solid food, but I don't think I would go out of my way for it. For me its a great "well, its in the area" kinda place.

I absolutely love this place! My dad first started bringing my brother and I here when we were little - it was one of those special trips that we only took with daddy. I always asked daddy if we could go to the place with the saw dust on the floor. We loved it. And in all the years I have been going to Philippe's, I have never tried anything but the french dipped lamb...dipped both sides. The greatest venture I ever took in changing things up, was they day I finally decided to try the famous Philippe's mustard on my sandwich (I was afraid of spicy things when I was little). Now it is a must have addition to the lamb...dipped both sides. I also buy a jar of it to take home every time I'm there. Philippe's is a classic.

1 lemonade (no refill) 1 Lamb Sandwich 1 side of Potato Salad. 12 dollars. Why all the hype? I walk in and I see hamster cage shredding on the floor and I asked myself - "What's going on here?" This place sadly did not live up to the hype. It is a delicious sandwich that is above the norm though. The size doesn't look that big but it is adequate if you add a side dish to it. One of the yelpers suggested slamming a wad of cole slaw to it and I agree. You absolutely MUST ask for double/triple dip. Great for the experience, that's about it.

FROM: Los Angeles Times "February 11, 2010 | �Philippe the Original, a venerable Los Angeles eatery famous for its juicy French dip sandwiches, has been shut down by county health inspectors because of a cockroach infestation, officials said Thursday evening. Health inspectors discovered the problem about 11 a.m. Wednesday after conducting an inspection prompted by citizens' complaints, said Angelo Bellomo, director of environmental health for the Los Angeles County Public Health Department. But inspectors had to close the restaurant for 48 hours to allow the vermin to be removed. "When you have a violation like a live cockroach infestation, it doesn't matter how good the score is," Bellomo said."

Love this place! I've never been a huge fan of french dip sandwiches, but this place, oh this place makes me a believer. It's probably more the delicious and perfect mustard - sweet and super hot - but whatever, details details. The Philippe french dip (double dipped of course) sandwich with the amazing mustard, plus add some macaroni salad and pie, pretty much makes for an awesome awesome lunch. I don't even see the need to mess with anything else here, just go for the classic - the beef french dip, double dipped. It's perfect and delicious. Add the mustard and you won't be disappointed. Parking can be tricky around here though, so look for street parking around the side of the building. Also, I've never seen this place without a crowd, so be prepared for LOTS of people. Thankfully, the line always moves pretty fast. And seating isn't really an issue since there's lots available. I thank Rachael Ray for introducing me & my family to this place back when she was first doing $40/day!

What can I say that hasn't already been said about Philippe's? There's a reason it has been open for more than 100 years, and it ain't just the 9-cent coffee. The sandwiches are classic and...perfect. I remember the first time I ate here - I was 5 or 6 years old and accompanied by the old man and my brother (I think). My dad explained how the serving ladies never touch the money so don't try handing them any cash or you'll look like an idiot. I recall thinking that was an odd thing to point out to someone who had a good two feet to grow before he could even see over the counter, but good advice nonetheless. I'm one of those guys you'll overhear in line, explaining how everything works in the place (get your water around the corner, double dips are for amateurs, they raised the price of coffee in 1977, etc.), but it's all stuff my dad used to tell me. Avoid the lunch rush and the pre-Dodger game crowd if you don't like standing in line. And be sure to order a pickled egg - they are delicious!

Long lines and TONS of people are worth the food and sense of community. I have never been here on a "slow" day, so be warned! Everything on the menu is delicious.

It gets the craziest during Dodger games where it becomes "the place to be" before a game.

Who could have imagined that a little thing like dipping a bun into broth would cause such a following?!? Well, according to legend Philippe's was the birth place of such a thing when their buns fell into some broth and thus born was the French Dipper sammich. This is one of those places you have to check out, whether it's really that great or not. Beef sandwich was okay, I was expecting more from such and institution, but when you can live of reputation you don't need to still be the tops. Potato salad was amazing and the coleslaw was good too. The thing that I liked best was the way you order deli style and how they have like 8 lines. It's so much better than getting a number and sitting down or waiting for your name to be called and so forth. I wish more places would adopt this type of service. I don't thing I'll be going back, just because it was way loud and busy and to be honest I can get a better sandwich that's not downtown.

What can I say, the first time I came here was my sophmore year in college in 2004, and its been 7 years before I came for my 2nd time. And 7 years and 1 day for the 3rd time. Everything's been said already. Its a classic place. Classic food. Classic vibe. Classic no bull-shit service. Get the beef sandwich. Two key points: Swiss Cheese, and Double Dipped. Double Dipped b/c after you double dip, you will just wonder why you ate single dipped ever before. I don't eat many of the sides. I will however, say yes to a slice of banana cream pie. Except sometimes a whole banana chunk comes out, and half the pie is gone. Slice those badboys thinner Phillippe. So what? They have lines? So what? No order in their chaos.

Where the French dip sandwich all started. From the outside the place looks small, but once you're in is pretty huge. The place is pretty much an old school deli. It gets really packed whenever they're busy but you might be lucky to go in during some down time and have an easy time to order and find a seat. Surprisingly they serve breakfast but I've never gone in for it. The French Dipped sandwiches are great, from beef, pork, ham, turkey and lamb. They have a number of other sandwiches as well. A variety of sides to choose from are there infront of you to see. My favorite is the potato salad. They also serve desserts. If you're visiting LA hit it up, or even if you're in the area and are hungry. It's close to the the train station and China town so it was easy walking distance from those areas. Lastly parking there is a smaller lot right next to it but it usually full like most places in LA you're better off parking on the streets. But be sure to read the street parking signs so you don't get ticketed or towed.

This is LA's oldest restaurant 蕎hich has been around for 103 years .This is a piece of history your walking into. Hands down Philippe's is the best when it comes to beef dip sandwiches, well they did invent the french dip sandwich after all. Everything is good on the menu and I have to say the lamb sandwich is stupidly good. Of course the classic is the beef sandwich double dipped with au jus. This is a gourmet sandwich and for about $5, you just can't go wrong. Let's put it this way there's some places out there charging $10+ for the same thing but not as good as Philippe's. Watch out during lunch time. This place can get hella crowded but at least the lines move pretty quick though. Getting here is simple, it's right across from Union Station and yes they do have free parking in the back (especially in Downtown, which is rare). 蔅ike stalls are available making it simple to get down here by car, bike, and Metro. This is the real deal and if you never tried it out you find yourself coming back for more. BTW: They are CASH ONLY. Plus you have to try the mustard.

But here's my own experience... I've always gotten the beef or pork french dip. Double-dip when i feel adventurous. Ooooo. Those have been winners for me for a long time, but I recently tried the lamb french dip. I added a little bit of the famous hot mustard and took a bite. It was good, a tad dry, but still tasty. It didn't wow me as did the beef or pork. But I had no trouble killing this sandwich in no time. I wish I ordered another sandwich. The sandwiches are on the smaller side, so if you feel hungry, gotta order two. I also got an ice tea, which was ok and seemed freshly brewed. The macaroni salad was good, not bland like most places that sell that kind of side. I'll have to try the chili next time for sure. The prices are ok for the serving size you get. The service is friendly. Atmosphere is cool and nostalgic. And if you get a seat in the main dining area, you definitely feel that. There are seating areas upstairs and to the far left of the ordering counter to. It's not on the menu, but you can order a beef tip sandwich. Which has some bold flavor since it's the ends of the slow cooked beef. ;) I think the whole experience and history of Philippes makes it an instant favorite, with the french dipped sandwiches being the main star. Don't forget the mustard!! Gonna pick me up a bottle next time!

I like Philippe's... but I think it is also a bit overrated with regards to flavor. The place has a lot of different options of food to choose from but the staple here would be the french dipped sandwiches, which you can get in lamb as well. Honestly, I've had better dipped sandwiches and I've received a lukewarm (and by lukewarm I mean just slightly under enough to be called cold) dipped sandwich here enough times to notice (I mean like 1 out of 3 times I visit). I'm not complaining too much though because I still love to come here and their rolls are yummy, too. They have a SUPER spicy mustard at your table to eat with your sandwich so test it first if you've never had it! You can get your sandwiches by themselves or with coleslaw, mac salad, or potato salad which are all pretty good. There are also a slew of other items that can change from day to day, in a type of diner-ish style. However, the fact you pay for these separately means you can run up a bill over $10 easily. The establishment is cute and so are the servers which tend to remind me of school lunch ladies but with generous smiles. Expect to wait in lines but depending on the time of day it will go faster than slower. Don't forget -- the place only accepts cash! They DO have an ATM inside though.

Ah, Philippe. 蔣ou can only drive by an establishment for so long (in my case, nearly 30 years) before you have to bite the bullet and see what the big fuss is about. Although my roots run deep in Los Angeles, my first taste of the venerable French Dip Sandwich didn't happen until much later in life and unfortunately probably at some local Denny's when I was a kid. 蔠hat?! 蔣elp didn't exist back then so I lived in the dark ages. 蔍t didn't matter because I fell in love with the French Dip Sandwich. 蔍f ever I crack open a menu and I see a French Dip Sandwich, it will take an inordinate amount of willpower to prevent myself from ordering it - yes I love it that much. 蔛o a visit to Philippe's was like heading to Mecca after having toured the minor league circuit for years. My impression? 蔊ood sandwich, but not what I was hoping for. 蔍 expected a chorus of cherubs, a swoon, an accidental "uh mah gawd"...nothing. 蔜he meat was ok, but wasn't as juicy as I'd hoped. 蔍 really wanted more au jus flavor, but the bread had already soaked it up. 蔕n the flip side, the split pea soup and beef chili were standouts in comparison. 蔜he split pea wasn't salty and you could taste the flavor of the peas while the beef chili was hearty and had a good spicy note. But regardless of what you may think of the food, the establishment is an absolute historical gem. 蔍t should be on the register of National Historic Monuments. 蔣ou don't find many places like Philippe's aching with the history of countless hungry Americans who have waited the long lines before you. 蔛o be a part of history and take a bite of that sandwich young man.

Whenever I'm even close to the area, I absolutely HAVE to go here. The french dipped sandwiches are the best anywhere. Yeah, they're a little on the small side. Take a friend, and order 3 - that way, you'll each have 1-1/2, the perfect portion. My recommendation: get the pork. Best I've ever had. The lamb is good, too. The beef? ehh, it's okay - but get the pork!! Go there on a weekday and you'll usually see a celebrity or 2 - a lot of newscasters are like me - they love this place, too. Oh, yeah...to the guy who said Phillipe was pricey...what the heck are you comparing this to? $6.00 for a great sandwich is not pricey. Enjoy your value menu at McD's, bud. And the guy who complained about parking? There's a huge lot across Ord which is only for Phillipe and, even when it's very crowded, I've never had a problem with parking.

Philippe's really has no competition. 蔜here's Cole's, yes. 蔜hough the atmosphere, attitude and french dipped sandwiches of both are so completely different as to make it apples to oranges. 1st Timers: �Choose any line, they go fast!

I tried the beef french dip and the lamb. 蔵 have to say that LAMB is the best; its so much More juicy and flavorful. I get it with a slice of Swiss cheese and double dipped. The size of the French dip is avg its not to big and some people might need 2 to fill them up. The chili is also really good here also. I didn't care for that hot mustard it had an overwhelming taste of horseradish.

The never ending debate on who's got the best French dipped sandwiches in LA has always been narrowly focused on Philippe and Cole's. This might have something to do with both claiming to be the originator of the sandwich and their relative proximities in the downtown area. A group of us were attending an event across the street at the California Endowment and made a quick stop to grab dinner before the event. The large antiquated interior was packed with people with a souvenir section by the entrance followed by rows of bar stools and wooden booths with people randomly scrambling for a place to sit. They have multiple servers behind the counter to take orders and the sandwiches were made there on the spot. With people bursting everywhere, the atmosphere was festive and very casual with multiple lines of people slowly working their ways to the counter. They didn't have a pastrami dipped sandwich for me to make a toe-to-toe comparison with Cole's, but I was thrilled to find a Lamb Dipped Sandwich ($6.95) listed on the menu as I also grabbed a large cup of lemonade to go (75 cents). Their sandwich appeared cheaper and larger than Cole's with chunks of lamb falling off the sandwich with dipped bread that came harden on the bottom and still soft at the top. The lamb was tender but not juicy or well seasoned; and the bottle of spicy mustard was not as sharp and tasty as the one I had at Cole's. Unlike Cole's, the entire sandwich tasted very salty so I was quite relieved to have gotten the lemonade to get rid of the lingering aftertaste. As I contemplate between the two sandwiches, it was difficult to compare them for its entirety but there were still some particularities that were worth mentioning. 蔉irst, Philippe mostly caters to tourists and the working class with larger and cheaper sandwiches compared to Cole's saloon-pimpin', hipsterish bantering atmosphere. I thought Philippe was more generous with their portions but Cole's sandwich and spicy mustard were clearly preferred, especially when they're coupled with au jus served to the side. So a lot of this really comes down to personal preferences with advantages and disadvantages on both sides of the coin. With my arms folded but not terribly disappointed, my search for the better French dipped sandwich continues.

Hey you come here not so much for the food but to dine in a unique place that doesn't resemble all the chain restaurants around LA. This place reeks of historic memorabilia and kitsch. As for the food if you haven't figured out revolves around the french dip sandwiches unfortunately not historic prices but the portions are decent. Its worth a trip just for the uniqueness of this place and if you like this go visit cliftons cafeteria

I finally got to try here on a Wednesday afternoon where there was basically no line that led out the door. It really is a good sandwich so I now know why people wouldn't mind waiting ! The pork sandwich is sooo good, very moist. The turkey one.. kinda dry but still good. My bf loves the spicy mustard sauce and insisted on putting some sauce with every bite haha Overall, I'd come here again. It's a really cute place that serves a good affordable lunch. One thing I wouldn't miss is the macaroni salad.. too vinegary for me !

I was excited to come here. I will give it another shot one day, but with all the yummy food in LA, im not sure when ill be able to make room for it again. I prefer to have the au jus on the side for me to dip my sandwich myself bite by bite. The sandwhich (bread) got so soggy, that was the main downer. But i can tell the au jus was pretty good.

I remember going here when I was a little kid because my dad went here with his dad. 蔍 think that's how a lot of people in LA think about Philippe's. 蔍t's just one of those "my family has been going here for years" types of places. 蔵t doesn't hurt that the sandwiches are fantastic. Forget all of those trendy places in west LA with their "fake LA" crowd - if you want to see REAL LA, you have to go to Philippe's. 蔍t's probably the most anti-trendy place in LA, and for that, I love it.

There is one thing in this world you MUST double-dip on, the Phillippe beef sandwich. In fact, not only should you get it double-dipped, you should also add some Swiss cheese to it. This place is clearly made for a big crowd. In fact, the lines to order this fabulous sandwich was out the door! (Tip: go through the side entrance, the line is shorter.) But don't worry, the cashiers are extraordinarily efficient. I love how the order-takers serve you the food but don't actually handle the cash. Excellent sanitary measures!! The soup of the day were cream of broccoli and beef barley. The real hidden gem, besides the tender and delicious beef sandwiches, is the beef barley soup! The complex herb-y flavors in that soup told me that they'd spent hours developing and perfecting it. Another tip: eat your double-dipped right away to prevent it from getting too soggy. Phillippe's is definitely a tourist attraction that even the locals should not miss out on.

I had an appointment downtown this morning...rarely venture to that part of SoCal. Finished up around 11:00 am and thought about going to this Polish Restaurant I been wanting to try. But changed my mind and went for Philippe since it was close by. My parents use to take us here when we were little kids, and I remember it was one of my favorite places to eat. I haven't been here for maybe 5 or 6 years, and I seem to remember I wasn't too impressed that time. But I wanted to give it another try and for the nostalgic feel. I beat the lunch crowd as the lines were only 1 or 2 people deep. Ordered the Beef Sandwich, double dipped with potato salad and pickles. My friend Trinh told me that they have "the best" pickles here...she was wrong!! My sandwich was fine...not bad. The double dipping really helped because without it, the meat might have been too dry. But the horseradish sauce is "The Bomb"!! My first bite just about blew my nostrils out. But it hurt so good!! The salad was okay, and as mentioned before the pickles were so-so. With a 65 cent iced tea to wash it down with, I was on my way. Don't think I'll be going back anytime soon, unless out of town guests want to go there. It was nice to visit and remember my visits as a kid, but there's better sandwich places all around these days that I would prefer to go to.

Love this place! If you want to travel back in time go to Phillipe. It has the best Dip sandwiches for half the price than anyone else. For me its not all about the food; its about the place. Phillipe has history; real history and you can see it from the signs on the wall, the telephone booths, to the serve yourself water stations. The food is tasty and prices are a steal.

If you were only getting sandwitches, Phillippe's would be really good, BUT you are also getting history, antourage, and a tour in the past, so it is quite phantastic! Phillipe is as much original LA as you can get - it has been there for a hundred years and saw much more than you did! Their french dipped sandwitches are legendary, so you have to try it at least once. Their house mustard is highly recommended, and I would also throw a bit extra for blue cheese - it does make pretty much any sandwitch they have better. Oh, and their lemonade for 75c. is like a blast from the past, very cute! The place looks a bit more inviting, warmer and friendlier in day light, so if it's your first, then go there to grab a lunch, and make sure you give yourself enough time to sit back, savor the food, breath in LA past, and enjoy the process!

Craving a good ol french dip sandwich, this would be the place to get it. 蔍 take my beef dip with a side of coleslaw, which is a bit runny but tasty, and a cold lemon aid. �After receiving my order, I will usually find a seat upstairs (it just seems cleaner and less crowded) and chow. 蔍f I may make a suggestion here, take a fork, strain out the coleslaw a bit, and pile it on your sandwich. 蔜hen throw on some spicy mustard and WHA-LA,....pure magic. 蔣ou'll feel like Houdini as you make your meal disappear. The lines can be a little convoluted, so when next to order, keep an eye out for the next cashier/server when they become available or someone from the line next may "inadvertently" take your place. The place is CASH ONLY! 蔉ood is great, prices are reasonable, and the place is clean...ish (3 1/2 out of 5). Parking is typically available in the lot directly across from the building. �Like Langers Deli, this is a great old school place, but not as pricey (or tastey,....umm pastrami). P.S. Philippe's pies are good, but for a real treat, walk down to Olvira St. and grab a churro at Mr. Churro's. 蔒ake sure they make it fresh too.

Yes they invented the french dip sandwich but their CHILI is good too (and pies). Just be careful of the hot mustard, don't get too heavy handed! Also, I would definitely recommend the beef...it's much better than the pork in my opinion (although I haven't tried the lamb yet). I've only been there for lunch and although the lines get pretty long, they move relatively fast. Also, there's tons of seating both in the back and upstairs. Parking is across the street and there is ample space. Definitely come early if you go for lunch on Friday because its almost always pretty busy anytime after about 12:15.

My review sans the hype. Philippe's is iconic in Los Angeles, no argument. Is it worth The Layover, Man vs Food, etc's raving...? Sort of. If you bring out of town relatives here to have the Travel Channel experience, they'll be disappointed. It's not AMAZING. You can't expect a meal to match national tv coverage. If you (with or with the cousins from Iowa) want to go somewhere for a good sandwich, it's a solid bet. Very solid. I've always done the double dips. That broth/au jus is GOOD! I've had all the basic sandwiches. I recommend all of them except the ham. For me the ham just doesn't work in this style of food. Turkey is my surprising choice. Beef is the classic. Pork works perfectly. Lamb is different, but great. Turkey? It works because they use good turkey. Cheap, processed, mass-market turkey wouldn't work. If that's what they use I have no explanation. Either way, give the turkey a shot! Guilty pleasure: the pickled eggs. Honestly I don't understand why I like them, but dang I do. What's the negative? Crowds. Weekdays from 11:45 to 1:30 it like Disneyland in the summer with no Fastlane passes. You're waiting in some lines. I've never been on the weekends, so I don't know what those crowds are like. A golden bonus if you go when the crowds are lower: Free Parking!!! In Downtown LA! I'd almost go for mediocre food just for that!

My bf brought me here for french dip sandwiches. It was my first time here, and the first thing that caught my eyes was the LINE! Omg, I had never seen these many ppl waiting in a restaurant before...there were about 7-8 lines. This place was packed with ppl, so I was thinking it must be GOOD! We waited for about 30 mins. The place was even more packed as it got closer to lunch hours. Finally, we ordered the pork, beef, lamb sandwiches with double dip, potato salad and lemonade. They made sandwiches right in front of you and it was fast. Price was reasonable. I had the first bite of the pork sandwich, it was SOO yummy, very juicy and tender. The beef and the lamb were pretty good, too, a little bit dry compared to the pork. Be sure to use the spicy house mustard !!! (Very spicy but delicious!!) The sandwich looked small but we got really full after three of them.. hehe I like this restaurant and the food! Just the line was quite long, but it was worth it. So, come in early!

I never use to care much for French Dip/Roast Beef Sandwich, but after trying Philippe's for the first time, I am now finding any excuse to convince people to go out with me to LA just to get their sandwich. Atmosphere: trendy and vintage-like ambiance. I love it! Peanut shells/hay on the floor, and a lot of seating areas on the ground floor and upstairs. Food: I always get the double dipped roast beef sandwich (meat is dipped in the broth and both insides of the bread are as well); I don't like soggy sandwiches enough to get the fully dipped sandwich. The meat is tender and juicy, and the bread is perfectly toasted. The spicy mustard is a great sinus clearer, but beware - IT IS STRONGER THAN MOST MUSTARDS. I thought I only put a drop, and then when I took a bite into the sandwich my whole perspective on life changed (well, not really, but hopefully you get the exaggeration). The macaroni salad and potato salad are both great and not too heavy. And lemonade/ice tea for less than a dollar? YES PLEASE. Service: Sweet and friendly people. I like the way you place money on a tray (random, I know). Your food gets to you fast as well. Sandwiches are also not too pricey ($5ish). Fun Story: The last time we were here, my friends and I saw Emeril Lagasse filming something. We were behind the camera in the background smiling awkwardly. I wonder if we ever made it on TV.

Double dipped french dip sandwich for 7 dollars with a side of potato salad and coleslaw... what's NOT to like (except for the parking lot and long lines) ? 蔄fter lunch, have yourself a cup of joe for $0.09. 蔜his place is definitely a must visit if you're in LA, if not for the food, for a "bite" of history. 蔍 need to get a job as a day writer.

This place is Ok nothing to brag about. I only went to this place because I was in the area and I heard a lot of my friends as well as co-workers talk about this place. The sandwiches is pretty small so most likely your have to order two sandwiches. The drinks are very small sizes so you're probably need to order two also. The place is actually pretty big, so finding a seat shouldn't be a problem. If you skip this place your not missing out. Also, they only accept cash.

It was ok... Honestly. I had no clear idea what "french dip" meant before I visited Philippe. I thought I would get a separate dipping sauce on the side that is somewhat "french" style but inner cut layers of the bread was already dipped into beef juice that looks like soy sauce. It was too salty for my taste and made the bread soggy. I personally don't like bread being overly moist. The meat itself was good. I tried the pork instead of beef knowing pork would be softer and less "spongy" like texture then beef when I bite into it. If you're a meat lover, you would love the bread + meat only sandwich, but as for me, I love having some "balance" in my meals (salty food + sugary stuff afterwards, hot coffee + cold OJ, meat + vegetables... do you know what I mean?). So I ordered side of cole slaw and pickled cucumbers (FYI: additional charge, no inclusive "combos" at fixed price). I liked the vegetable side dishes more than the sandwich! Philippe's cole slaw reminded me of KFC's. Perhaps, "french-dip" isn't my style. The signs, chairs, tables, lights in the ceilings, stairways to the 2nd floor, all looked original when it was first opened for business. It was opened in 1908 and 2008 was Philippe's 100th Year Anniversary. The strangest thing I encountered was the floor! The floors were covered with some kind left over wood shavings. I asked the lady who was working behind the counter and she told me they absorb odors like cigarette smokes or something. I guess everyone smoked in the restaurant back then and this tradition continues even though the restaurant is smoke free these days. Parking is free, it's pretty rare to have free parkings in DTLA. Perhaps Philippe owns the land. So, meat lovers out there who don't mind having their meat wrapped around with soggy bread, try Philippe! Otherwise, Philippe would be a good one time "historical places in LA" tour experience that everyone is bragging about.

Like many L.A. institutions, this one earned its reputation before people had the many many choices they do today. I've been coaxed here perhaps 4 times now. 蔍've had over-priced turkey on a dry roll, extortively-priced turkey on a damp roll, giggle-inducing-priced roast beef on a damp roll and strongarm robbery-priced pork on a damp roll. 蔜o drink I have had reasonably-priced lemonade in a glass large enough to hold the collective sweat of a lifetime of physical labor put in by the entire Board of Directors of Chevron. 蔍 had to order 4 glasses or place myself at risk a blistering case of cotton mouth. 蔄ll of this in a building with the charm and aesthetic magnetism of an emergency Red Cross shelter. The luxury-priced pork and turkey were tasty. Look, I'm a great fan of traditions and ritual. 蔍 mean, I still vote for Democrats! 蔅ut if you're gonna make the counter staff dress like they stepped out of a copy of Professional Maid & Housekeeper Quarterly circa 1955 and force your diners to queue in lines that were conceived around the time electric lighting was considered a frivolous passing fad of the nouveau riche, then you need to STAY with the tradition thing and charge a fee for your dinky sammys that is similarly nostalgic. And as to inventing the French Dip? 蔆ool. 蔜hanks for that. 蔈very other restaurant or diner I've ordered a French Dip from has been superior to this culinary equivalent of a mute shrug. I get that there's a certain draw to patronizing a century-old institution. 蔅ut beyond a single visit to confirm that you've been there and done that, paying these prices for this sort of vaguely adequate sandwich repeatedly indicates you either don't get out much or its your way of saying "It is more important what my purchase says to others about me than its own intrinsic value to myself." 蔍n this way, Philippe's customers are much like In-N-Out clientele or people who get tribal tattoos.

This is one of those hype spots, similar to Pink's where it gets by with novelty and price. 蔜he place is cheap, no doubt about it--but to justify the ridiculous amounts of people in there at ANY give time?

I'm always surprised by how many people frequent this restaurant. It's an L. A. institution, I know. The lines are always long and it's always a game to pick the right one. Sometimes you're in a short line only to find out that the lady in front of you is ordering for a party of 8. Oh well. The prices look good at first because the items are a la carte. Then you realize that your order is $10 to $12--not outrageous but not a big bargain either. I've had the beef and pork sandwiches, which are both good. The mustard that can be found at the table is great. It's hot because of the horseradish. The coleslaw is also good. There's a variety of pies like coconut cream, lemon curd, pecan, apple, berry, and chocolate. You'll also find brownies and chocolate cake. It's a fun place to go.

There's like 5-6 lines yet the line still wait like 15 minutes, mainly cause the cashier is also like a waiter who does all the worker get the food for you, sandwitch like lamb they had to cut in front of you, not big fan of those lamb since is lamb leg it does cost like $1.5. 蔈verything else quite good, the lemonade is cheap 蔮ut had too much ice. 蔜he coleslad and the cheesecake is great !

Came here for the Famous Sandwiches, I had the beef french dip. 蔍t was good, but not even close to the best I've eaten. Not for vegetarians! 蔒y friend ordered a grilled cheese, all they did was slice the bread in half and toss in a few slices of cheese. 蔍 could have made this at home in 2 seconds. My friend got a cup of chili too, this was good, nice and meaty I give it a 4/5. I came pretty late maybe 9:15pm ish and the workers all seemed pretty unhappy and were not very pleasant to deal with. 蔜he place is pretty big though, lots of seating and had sawdust/paper on the floor, I guess for easy clean up? Overall food was mediocre, the service was less than pleasant, but I guess you get what you pay for. 蔠ould come here for a cheap quick eat but definitely not for the service or atmosphere.

I would give this place 5 stars if it were based solely on the food, but it isn't, so I wont. I guess I can't blame the restaurant for its popularity amongst so-cal foodies so i'll just name a few things to look out for; and keep in mind, i'm probably just knit-picking at this point because it's very difficult to find a flaw in the wonder that is Philippe's. if you can avoid it, try to come in when the restaurant isn't serving everyone who works/commutes in downtown LA during lunch hour. it adds to the ambiance, but that quickly gets old when you are starving for their french dip. there are several lines to choose from, each of them move-- slowly, but surely. just pick a line and stick to it. i've been to this place a handful of times and each time is just as good as the first time. from the very first bite up until the last. the consistency is incredibly impressive for something as simple as a french dip sandwich. surprise! they don't give extra au jus for ur sammich so ask to get it "double dipped". also, they only accept cash so bring at least $40 if you're coming in with a party of 2, possibly 3. Don't fret, though, as they have an ATM machine if in case you forget. Their servings are decent, good enough to share with another person. My boyfriend and I usually get our own sandwich and share a side of macaroni salad and pickles. they slice the pickles into quarters so you can easily share that, unless you really love pickles. I've only tried their pecan pie and that was delicious, but that's about it on my experience with their dessert. The soups are exceptional. $1.80 for a bowl, can't really go wrong with that. The salads are a little pricey, but the serving is pretty generous. Oh, BEER ON TAP: AH-MAZING. they only have a select few but it's cheap, cold and so delicious with the sandwich. they also have other selections. The parking can be hectic. there are a few meter parking spots and two free lots for Philippe's, but if you come during the lunch rush, then prepare to wait a few minutes for a spot bc it really does get very busy in there.

I love going here any time I go to LA. My mom lives just one stop away on the Metro, and from the station, it is a 5 minute walk to Philippes. I like the shady decor of the restaurant, peanut shells all over the place, and the counter-style ordering. All the workers are friendly, and would even offer to snap pictures of our group as they walked by. I tend to get one of the meats with Blue Cheese, double-dipped, and at the table adding hot mustard. Along with a side and drink, it makes for a quick and easy meal that's quite filling. My dad tends to order one of the purple pickled eggs - they are pretty good!

I really wanted to like this place. I had high expectations and sadly I was left unimpressed. I had the french dip, the lamb dip, the coleslaw and the potato salad. First off, the sandwich was a bit dry and didn't have as much flavor as I thought. I for sure thought the lamb dip would be much more flavorful but it just had a strong after taste and wasn't as juicy as I had hoped. I think next time I'll have to try a double dip and see if that improves things. My gf had it separately and said it was delicious, so I definitely will have to hit it up again. The coleslaw was the most impressive part of the meal that night, but I will definitely give them another shot. Another negative was the price tag for this simple set of food, I think I ended up spending over 20 bucks which is insane for sandwiches. I feel like this place takes advantage of their long standing presence and history and have fallen off a bit because of it. I'll give it a try again, but it may just end up being one of those tourist traps.

The sandwich itself was disappointing, and the overall meal a bit pricey for what you get. They don't give extra sauce on the side (booo!) and even a double dipped sandwich can be a bit dry. The best thing about this place are the decor and ambience. For anyone touring LA, I'd drop in to just see what it was like back 50 yrs ago, but I personally wouldn't come back for the sandwich.

French dip! My oh my, what a wonderful creation! I would like to thank the man who created it. Oh no, he died?! Well, at least he left a fine establishment for us. This place is the original home of the French dip, the place it all started. DECORUM: 5 stars Phillipe's is one of the oldest establishments in Los Angeles, and the decorum says much about the history. There are lots of framed pictures, news clippings, posters, and other memorabilia in this place. They even have an old newsstand inside that sells bubble gum, candy, and other merchandise. And if you love the throw back to the old style, their water fountain is this neat contraption where you push up into your glass to get water. It's very confusing if you've never been, but quite funny to watch. Their floor is also spread with peanut shells. All their menu signs look hand written and decorated, a throw back to the 40s. It's quite quaint and definitely an experience. SERVICE: 4 stars When you walk in, you'll see a line. And not just one, but several of them. It can be quite daunting at first glance, but in actuality the wait isn't so bad. The women behind the counter are all dressed in old school white gowns and are very quick. They ask for your order and move quickly to get it ready for you. Before you know it, you'll have your food and a smile to follow. FOOD: 4 stars The food is great. All the flavors are there and you can taste it with each bite. They make their own Au ju and their own meats, both slow cooked for hours. I love getting their traditional roast beef sandwich double dipped and a cup of chili. Their chili is awesome. Absolutely hearty and filled with flavor, literally to the brim. It goes great with the sandwiches. They also have cole slaw and potato salad, both home made. They make their own hot mustard on premise using a family recipe. Their lemonade and ice tea are cheap, both under $1.00, and if you like lamb, you'll love their lamb double dipped sandwich. The only neg I have is that the portions are a bit small for me. But I always get two to fill that void so problem solved. CONCLUSION: If you are from Los Angeles, you know this place. From celebrities to blue collar workers, this is a favorite for many people. If you're just visiting or passing by, make sure you eat here. This is where the French dip all started. You can taste the history with each savory morsel. You might even break into some hot mustard tears.

Philippe's is historic Los Angeles. 蔜he food itself was pretty good. Would I go out of my way to get it? 蔔ot really but I think it is something to go after and get if you're in the area.

Philippe's and Cole's both claim to have invented the French Dip. 蔍t's a battle that probably won't be settled in my lifetime. 蔍n my opinion, Philippe's versions are better. Please note that Philippe's won't give you a side of au jus on the side for dipping. 蔣our server will dip the side of the bread into the jus before making the sandwich. 蔛ome reviews complain that the sandwiches are too dry; if you want them as moist as possible, order your sandwiches "double dipped" or, better yet, "wet". 蔍f you don't specify, it'll be single dipped. There are several lines for ordering -- pick one and queue up. 蔠hen you get to the front, give the server your order. 蔛he (haven't seen a male server yet) will tell you the total. 蔍t's cash only here, so put the money on the small tray (servers aren't allowed to touch money). 蔛he'll take the money to the cashier and return with your change, if any. 蔄ny tips should be placed in the tray. Now, about those French dips...the sandwiches are nothing special, just sliced meat in a French roll with au jus. 蔜he Lamb is the priciest but also my least favorite. 蔍 usually get either the Pork or Turkey Sandwich, ordered "wet", of course. 蔜he turkey is a little bit dry so I always order a side of cole slaw to pile inside the sandwich. 蔜he cole slaw has way more dressing than I like but it's no big deal -- I just drain off the excess when I get the food home. 蔇on't forget to ask for some hot mustard, a great remedy for clogged sinuses. There are always two soup choices which change daily. 蔒y favorite is the creamy Split Pea (offered Wednesdays & Sundays) but the Chicken & Wild Rice (Tues) and Navy Bean (Thurs) are also good. 蔜hey're not overly salty like most other diner/fast food soups. They have two free parking lots. 蔕ne is right next to the building and the other one is across Ord Street.

Saw this place on Food Network, and HAD to try it out!! My bf and I ordered the beef double dip, lamb double dip, pork with cheddar wet, and a cup of their chili. Beef double dip was good, but seemed a bit dry. This goes the same for the lamb. They were good, but something was missing. That's when we decided to get a third one, with cheese, with more au jus. Pork + cheese + wet = DELICIOUS. This is the combination to get! or maybe its getting any combo with cheese + wet. Chili was good. Nothing to go crazy about.

So the gf with cousins in tow finally make it to the Mecca of French Dip! Established in 1939, this little gem sits on the outskirts of LA's Chinatown (kind of a strange spot for a sandwich joint). After months of trying to get here, we finally made the time and were excited to eat. Philippe's looks like it's from the 30s as soon as you walk in; bar stool seating at counter-tops. There's also a weird sawdust like substance scattered everywhere on the floor. The menu was uber-simple: beef, ham, pork, lamb, turkey and tuna. I ordered the beef and the gf swaps for the lamb. Also making their ways into our bellies were beef barley soup, macaroni salad, and some awesome pies (I had the banana cream and the gf ordered the blueberry cheesecake). Two sandwiches (mine's with Swiss cheese), one soup, one mac salad, two slices of pie = $26! Freakin' awesome! I have to tell you that the marriage of thinly slice roasted meat on fresh baked bun dipped in sauce is something everyone should try. The beef, while good to the last dripping morsel, was actually out shined by the lamb! And the liquid horseradish was incredible. The pies were on hit and I couldn't get enough of the banana cream. The only thing we didn't really care for was the mac salad; the celery threw us for a loop. But the soup more than made up for it =) All in all, I would definitely bring my hunger back to Phillipe's for more dipped face-stuffing!

FOOD: Their beef sandwich was better than the pork. This place is just satisfactory, IMO this place is all hype, but fails to deliver on it. However, it is ok. You get bread meat and maybe cheese. I ussually like some tomatoes, lettuce or something else in the sandwich to make it interesting. After the first bite I was left with a "EH.." feeling. PRICE: $6 for a sandwich. AMBIANCE: Downstairs has a very authentic old school feel to it, especially since the workers are wearing the classic dinner uniforms. The dining areas are very boring, not one painting up, very bland colored wall paint. The upstairs dinning area has a PRISON FEEL to it. No joke. No music, not decorative furniture, just brown tables, and your food served on a tray, with echos of little children running around and the Warden about to throw you in the hole.

I guess I'll comment on the sandwiches here. I've been here and I really don't think it does live up to the hype. Too many people overhype this place and it didn't do it for me. The employees were kinda rude like others say so be prepared. There wasn't a long line when I visited this place but it was raining so maybe that discouraged people to come visit. The sandwiches are small and be expected to eat at least 2. Minus 1 star because the staff wasn't very nice and minus 1 star because the sandwich wasn't very memorable for me. I did see this on TV and this was the reason why I wanted to try this place. I've only lived in LA for 2 1/2 years from SF but love food so I have to try everything. Will I give this place a second chance? Of course! Would I come back here again? YES.

The original. The birth place. Where it all began... This restaurant is being mentioned by several Food Network program for creating the first french dip sandwich, and on this Thursday, I was quite excited to try it for the first time! The restaurant is structured much like a fast food restaurant. There are 10 lines in front of a counter. The lines are divided by long bar table. There is a lady serving each line. She prepares all the sandwiches and serve the food to the customer in paper plates. While the restaurant is famous for its french dip sandwich, it also serves breakfast, sides and desserts. The restaurant has a 50's diner look and feel, which has aged gracefully with time. Being our first time here, we tried the single dipped ham, beef, lamb, pork and turkey sandwiches, all without cheese. All the sandwiches were served on soft, white bread buns, which got soggy after being dipped in the broth. The broth dipped bun was not as flavorful as some other french dip sandwich I had before. All the roast were moist and not too heavily season. Among the different sandwich, I enjoyed the beef and the pork the most. Philippe made their own mustard, which tasted like a yellow French mustard but hotter. The mustard gives the sandwich a good kick of flavor, which it needed. We also tried a pickled egg and Cole slaw on the side. The pickled egg was an hard-boiled egg pickled in beet juice and vinegar. It is slightly sour and have an interesting taste. The Cole slaw was all white cabbage. It was not too cream and have bright vinegar flavor. Overall, I rather like the 50's diners feel to the place, with the wood booth, phone booth, and candy stand. The food are simple and have an authentic feel to it. Prices are reasonable, but portions are smaller. However, given I personally had tried better french dip sandwich, I will probably not come back.

I love Philippe's! 蔠e were in LA for the weekend, and I had to go back for a dipped sandwich. 蔍t was just as I remembered: sawdust on the floors, cheap prices, and fast service. 蔍 had the classic beef sandwich with a healthy slather of the sinus-clearing hot hot mustard. 蔒y husband had a pork and cheese sandwich and thought it was great (he usually hates all dipped sandwiches). �This is not a place to try if you want friendly service or fancy plates. 蔅ut it's great food, served quickly. 蔄nd you're eating food history! 蔋ow cool is that?

I am torn. I really enjoyed the sandwich, but it wasn't 蔳reat by any means. The line was weird, but did move fast. The lady behind the counter was in no mood for us to ask what comes with/ on the sandwich. 蔠e both got the beef. The sandwich was tasty, the mustard made it better. The downfall is I can make a sandwich 3 times as good in my kitchen with very little work. It just isn't worth the drive, cost, or the being in a giant crowded room, to enjoy the sandwich. If we are in the neighborhood I would go back, but no special trips.

Before I started writing my review I was curious about what other people have written since there is 1,000+ reviews. It sounds like either ppl love or almost hate it. One word to describe this place. CLASSIC Yes this place has been on TV but that is not what makes it popular. I've been going to Philippe's for over 40 years. The place has not changed significantly which is one reason why it is so cool! The order counter, the bar stools, the old fashion uniforms and hair nets, the simple home cooked recipes. Who else sells baked apples??! There is something special about being able to see all those desserts and salads under the glass and pointing to the one you want. Classic. I usually get the beef dip, again just classic. It's the birth place of it! The Lamb with blue cheese is also another classic choice. Have to do the baked apple. Usually get the macaroni salad on the side, mmm creamy. Don't forget to try the mustard, it will be at the table, but be careful and only a little bit at a time. =) Come on people....The crowds and lines tho do mean that they are doing something right. =) Oh and bring cash! Cash only. They do have an ATM for those forgetful (like me) but then of course you'll have to pay an ATM fee. Boo!

Well, I'm ashamed that I haven't been to this place and was brought by my friends visiting out of country... I went with a group of 5 so we tried most of the major things french dip: beef - 3 stars pork- 3 stars turkey- 3 stars lamb- 4.5 stars the beef and pork are shredded and it is pretty bland without the hot mustard. The other yelpers are right, the hot mustard wakens up the flavor! i like how the lamb french dip is filled with chunks of meat rather than shredded so yes, that's my favorite from the list. turkey is sliced like you get from other sandwich store so overall food is 3 to 3.5 stars one thing i don't like is...the sandwich is "pre-dipped"? because most of the time i order french dip the restaurant will give you a little cup of juice to dip in while you eat... this place does not give that little cup so some parts of bun were soggy, if you don't consume it right a way it IS pretty ugggg the side dishes are up to par but not outstanding. coleslaw, potato salad, macaroni salad and how can you go wrong with pickles? so i do not have much comments on the side dish. I do like the atmosphere, chill and relaxing, not loud as a nightclub scene or Chinese dim-sum restaurant, services are fast considering the never ending line. price is reasonable $6-8 per french dip they have their own parking lot which is a big PLUS so there you go 4 stars for the overall experience BTW its CASH only make sure you got some cash on you, or they have an ATM machine there as well. i will return... this is quite a touristy spot next time i will get the coffee, seems like everyone gets their coffee

This was my first time trying this establishment since ever. I couldn't believe that I had never tried it. It is right next to Chinatown and I was there every weekend in my childhood days. I was definitely deprived. The order: Beef French dip, double dipped: extremely scrumptious, if you were starving you can gulp it down in 5 bites. The sandwich was moist, flavorful, and not soggy. It is average size not over the top gigantic, so if you have large appetites go with two. 蔜he next time I go, I would most likely add a slice of cheese to the sandwich. Pair this with the hot mustard sauce and you will not be disappointed. WARNING: The hot mustard is like wasabi that shoots up your nose like crazy. If you put too much you will cry, guaranteed. You can absolutely taste the horseradish in there. Chili Straight: This was really flavorful and my kind of chili. I don't like chili with beans so this was the perfect chili. Great flavor and the saltine crackers were a great addition to the bowl of goodness. Next time I would want to add some onions and cheese. Then it will be perfection! I was able to have a bite of the Pork French dip and the potato salad. The pork French dip was similar to the beef French dip just with pork flavor. The potato salad reminded me of my childhood days. It was like a flashback of what my mom use to make. Fantastic flavors of relish not too much mayo but still a party in your mouth. Give this place a try and see for yourself. *service: very fast!*

I came here around 7pm on a saturday. The lines weren't bad at all. So you walk in and line up behind the counter cafeteria style. There are benches and tables you can sit at after you get your food. We got the beef dip, one with cheese and one without. We also got a soup (I can't remember what it was) and the potato salad. The sandwiches were very good, however they were pretty small considering the price. I love their hot mustard. You'll love it if you're into the burn that horseradish gives you. The creamy potato salad was a good balance to the spiciness of the mustard on my sandwich. �Oh, and they have their own parking lot, but you could probably easily find street parking.

We saw this place on two different shows on the travel channel and decided while we live here we should try it out. 蔍 was impressed by the huge private lot across the street that we parked in. 蔖hilippe's even had a parking lot attendant who points out where to park. 蔍t's obvious this place gets plenty of business. Upon walking in the lines confirm its popularity. 蔋owever, the lines move fairly fast. 蔣ou order at the counter and stand there while they prepare your order. 蔜hey you pay (cash only) and go find a place to sit. 蔠hen we were here the downstairs was a little crowded so we headed upstairs like we saw others doing. 蔒y first comment when sitting down upstairs was that it felt like a meeting room in the back of a church. 蔔o pictures on the walls, no TV's, not even any music. �Our order was one classic French dip w/ Swiss and one lamb dip, both double dipped. We swapped halves so we could each try them both out. My husband got coleslaw and we both got beers (they have a decent selection of beers- especially for a deli LOL). 蔒y half of the classic French dip had one tiny slice of beef so I took a little off of my husband's side. 蔜here really wasn't that much meat on the French dip, but on the lamb sandwich there was plenty. The food was good, but I've made better French dips at home so its no place I would make a special trip to go to. 蔍f we happened to be passing by and were hungry I might stop in and try one of the other sandwiches.

As someone who loves a good french dip sandwich, Philippe's was a pilgrimage. I only regret not getting it double dipped, but the roast beast french dip was simple yet perfect. About as purist as you are going to get with this sandwich. The establishment has a lot of character, with the sawdust on the floor ad the lunch counter seating. The hot mustard is a good condiment for the sandwich, but when they say hot, they mean HOT (the way I like it!) Like other reviews said, lines move slowly, but with some friends you are at the front before you know it. Will definitely go again, check it out!

I was first introduced to this place by a friend who was a local of LA. If you are in town, you should definitely drop by and find out whats the hype with this place. I would suggest, do not go there during lunch and dinner hours, its crazy packed. We came here at slightly before dinner and had the lamb french dipped sandwich, lemonade and an order of pickled eggs (the egg is worth the try!) - total running up to less than $10. The hot mustard gave the sandwich a kick! One thing to note is that they only accept cash, however, they do have a ATM machine in the place.

YELP REALLY NEEDS TO LET US GIVE HALF STARS CUZ THIS PLACE DESERVES 3.5!! I really wanted to love this place and absolutely fall head over heels in love and write a great review.. I really did... because where do we now actually find places that are open for that long and still do great!? Yet, I only can give 3.5 stars because for one.... the line is rediculous and I felt like a prisoner waiting in that long line to receive something in the old, grey, paper plates and go sit on the long tables with bunch of others that I didn't know. Some people may call it a tradition or "originia" but It wasn't my favorite place to dine. The food was good and simple, something I wouldn't mind getting, but nothing that I will crave and go out of my way to get. Many people there said they came to try it out after seeing it on TV. It's difinitely a place to try out, but not your favorite usual dining place. It was good and satisfied my hunger, but updating few things around it wouldn't hurt.

It's so simply delicious! I love the dips (don't forget to add cheese!). The mustard is so spicy and delicious that i squeeze undisclosed amounts all over my beef dip.

Pretty good sandwich, but it didn't blow my socks off. Parking was kind of tricky because I arrived during 'high tide' [aka an hour before a Dodger game]. There is street parking and there are random lots you can park in, but being in the neighborhood that it is located and the high traffic of commuters, I bid you good luck to find good parking. Ken C and I walk in and he did all the ordering, being that he's experienced and I've never been. We both get the traditional beef double dip. We get the grub and make our ways to the, wait what? Cafeteria benches? I understand that this place has a lot of history, being rumored as the birthplace of the 'French Dip', but I expected something a little better than what seemed like a homeless shelter dining area. [please don't stone me] Ken C then gives me 'the sauce' and asks me what I think. Adding some of the mustard onto the dip certainly did give it more character points as the flavors were accentuated, but still, it seemed like just a regular sandwich. The meat and the bread were good, but that's the problem. They were just 'at-par', and for a place with the fame and history behind it that Philippe's has, I was regrettably underwhelmed. Would I ever be back? Only if other people wanted to go, for I won't be craving it. Philippe's - you're not bad, but you're not that good either. Kind of pricey for what you get. Bonus point - they have a cute candy shop set-up close to the door, but even that stuff is over-priced - *sigh*

Don't mind the lines, it makes the food taste better! Plus, it's not as long as you'd think. Just make sure you aren't behind tourists. It is a simple menu, but it can baffle people somehow. FOR TOURISTS: I recommend getting your sandwich double dipped at the LEAST. It's the only way to taste the sandwich the way it was originally intended (I get mine SOAKING). 蔍 also would suggest adding a cup of chili on the side to pour on your awesome sandwich. Oh, and get a pickle. You are welcome.

If you're in LA you gotta go to Philippe's. Bomb roast beef sandwiches. A lil pricey for a sandwich, but still very good. I was pretty disgusted/sad/angry/disappointed/depressed/ and all other negative emotions when i heard they were shut down for a week due to a roach infestation. Barf! I couldn't eat there for a while, but I've managed to get myself back in there now and order a sandwich. Still friggin' yummy! P.S. Get a slice of pie

You've seen them on Food Network, and the Travel Channel I'm sure, Philippe is world renowned for their French Dip sandwich. A food icon, one should, if in the area, make it a point to experience this place at least once. 蔄s per other reviews, yes, I would have to agree that the way they have it set up for waiting in line is not exactly efficient or effective. Depending on which line you choose, will make all the difference in how quickly you will be served, and unless you know the nice ladies behind the counter and how quick they are, you could easily be waiting for a long time. 蔛o if you're in a hurry, this isn't your place. 蔜hat being said, stepping into Philippe's is stepping back in time and it's worth the experience. Part of stepping back in time, is paying with cash, so yes, bring CASH! 蔅e patient, enjoy the surroundings and try to understand the historical significance of the birthplace of the French Dip (debatable... but still very possible). 蔍 recommend getting the Beef Sandwich, not double dipped but TRIPLE dipped (be sure to specify triple). 蔍 like spicy, so I add their special mustard to every bite, but if you're sensitive to spicy you may want to test it on your finger first. 蔍'd give it 5 stars if they had a more efficient line system that wasn't so hit or miss.

This establishment has been known for over century, amazing! 蔆areful coming during busy lunch and dinner hours, the wait can be murderous to your hunger. 蔐uckily they open up several registers, but it's still a crowd to contend with. 蔉eel the hustle and bustle, as if from a time half century earlier. French dip sandwich's are straight forward and good value for the price... for eating in the outskirts of downtown LA. 蔍'm usually prone to the beef dip sandwiches, but once in a while I'm in the mood for lamb. 蔄sk for "double dip" if you want some more au jus brushed into your sandwich. 蔜he hot mustard they have is painfully addicting. The sides have a homecooked feel, and I love the coleslaw here. 蔍'd say it's on par with Pantry Cafe's coleslaw. 蔜he pecan and apple pies is old-fashioned Americana eating. �Normally I don't order drinks when eating out, but 70 cents for iced tea or lemonade can be too good to pass up!

OVERRATED. As most Los Angeles "landmarks" are. They dip the entire piece of bread in the au jus for you.....so while you eat, it slowly gets soggy and cold. Meat is usually dry....flavor is ok. cheese is put on cold. stays cold. Makes for a very "interesting" mouthfeel. soggy bread, dry meat, cold cheese. Not the worst food I've had, but definitely not worth these 5 stars people seem to think the place deserves. having eaten here several times I decided to finally write this review. I just cant get over it. French dips......dont you want yours warm....with great bread, piping hot au jus for your own pleasurable dipping? when you dip it just before you bite into it....and once you do you get that great crusty texture from the bread with a burst of hot au jus? TENDER meat that isnt cut as thick as a porterhouse? I would most definitely recommend Cole's French dip on 6th and Los Angeles. THEN we'll talk french dip.

Overrated. I'd seen Phillipes on TV numerous times and hoped to one day eat there. Parking is difficult. 20 minute wait to order. Food was barely warm. Homeless guy drinking coffee sitting at our counter mumbling to the nice lady waiting for her food/accompanying party was distasteful. Poorly washed forks had petrified food stuck on them. Could not remove any of it. And what's with all the fat people? Eat a salad. Tried some of the pork & some beef. Some potato salad & iced tea. It's merely ok. But in light of all the hoopla I was extremely disappointed. It's more a marketing gimmick based on the counter selling T-shirts & other trinkets. I assume ownership has passed through numerous hands and as to be expected they try to milk every cent out of it. I'm sure someone with even a double digit IQ could figure out a better system of handling the lines & ordering. My line moved fast but there were others who had barely moved by the time we'd gotten our food. 2 stars is being generous.

N00b Phillippe Tips: 1. 蔖ersonally, I think the beef dip here is overrated. 蔍nstead, go for the lamb. 蔍 know what some of you are thinking: "Eww no, lamb? 蔍 hate that gamey taste." 蔐et me tell you, it's not gamey at all. 蔄nd quite frankly, it's much more flavorful than the roast beef. 蔜heir pork sandwich ain't too shabby either. 2. 蔄sk for your sandwich to be double-dipped. 蔜he roll isn't as dry and no worries, the bread won't be soggy like you've been walking in the rain for five miles. 3. 蔕rder one lemonade and one iced tea. 蔒ake yourself an Arnold Palmer. 蔍f you don't swing that way, I suggest you at least order two drinks as they're non-refillable. 蔣ou don't want to wait in line again for another drink, now do you? 4. 蔝se the house mustard sparingly. 蔄 good kick to it, I suggest you add a little a bite at a time. That's it! 蔛imple right???

I went here to try the famous French Dip Sandwiches and I will be returning soon and often. I went with the Beef French Dip which paired beautifully with a glass of Fat Tire ale on tap. My husband ordered the lamb which was incredibly juicy and tender. Our meal was decently priced and I loved how this place has remained so old fashioned. Its cafeteria style seating, so be prepared to get friendly. All kinds of people go here to fill their tummies. The night we went we were lucky enough to witness a patron who went nuts when he saw the five o' clock weather report. I can only assume by his reaction that he's not a fan of heat waves. He became hysterical and had to be removed by a security officer. Dinner & a show for under 20 bucks? Oh yeah, I'll be going back.

I haven't been to Philippe's since I was a kid, but we happened to be going to a concert downtown, and I convinced my better half to stop in here for dinner beforehand. So... yes, it was pretty crowded, and the lines move at a snail's pace. 蔜he counter person who takes your order also makes the sandwiches--this seems to slow things down a bit, but we're talking old-skool L.A. here, so plan on spending a few minutes in line. 蔍t makes for good people-watching, or you can always eavesdrop on conversations around you (which is especially fun on a weekend evening). �Anyhow, they were out of turkey so I got a ham dip and it was totally decent. 蔒y better half had the pork dip and enjoyed it a lot. 蔜hey're reasonably-sized and cheap, so you won't come out broke or impossibly-stuffed (unless you order multiple sandwiches, perhaps). 蔜he tapioca and custard were both awesome. 蔄nd the environment is classic, blue-collar charm... perfect for casual dates or a bite with friends. Especially recommended for trips using the LA Metro--then you don't have to worry about parking. By the way, if you forget cash, there's an ATM here.

A Los Angeles Classic. 蔍 have been going there for about 2o years now and I think I am one of the newer customers! 蔜he beef dip (double dip) is heaven on a bun, simplicity at its finest: a perfect amount of roast beef on a nice piece of bread dipped in a heavenly jus. 蔍 usually augment that with a small chili - straight (no beans) and cole slaw. 蔍f I am really hungry, I'll split the banana pie with my wife or a friend. The price of the sandwich has crept up over the years, at $6 a sandwich, I think they are hitting the border of "good value for the money."

It's wonderful. Back in the day people went there in their coveralls and in minks. Sandwiches were 25 cents, coffee 5 cent a cup. And everyone went, because it was the best in town. They had all kinds of pies, and I can't tell you much more because that wasn't my long suit, but also they had pickled hard-boiled eggs, and pickles, and cheesecake. Oh, yes, and they did have baked apples. I think that's their complete menu! I like the beef dip, double dipped. Share it with your husband, but put on as much mustard as you like and make him live with it. He likes cole slaw and potato salad, and will share if you sit close enough together. Even today, you can't beat it for your dollar, it's the best bet in town, consistently good, and Harry and I love to visit. The coffee is 9 cents now, I think. That's still a deal, and I love the people watching. It's crowded, so my suggestion is that you find a nice seat and make your grandkids wait in line for you. See you there!

Less than a dime charge for in-house coffee, the reminder to keep-it-simple, and the strange inspiration Philippe's brings me to take time to read the morning paper? This place takes me back to an era before my time, when waking up before dawn was the norm, paying with loose change and dollar bills was acceptable, eating vegan was unheard of, and no one was watching calories. While I found this place nothing fancy, and the food served, nothing more than ordinary, with a simple, hearty breakfast that I could pay with an honest Abe, and a time-travel back half a century or two, this classic restaurant won my heart. Cheers, Philippe's. May you have many more centuries of existence.

You know, it's an interesting debate. 蔍f someone is an innovator, or unique, or a landmark, should they be awarded a higher rating than an imitator? 蔛ome people would say no, that quality, quantity, or whatever else is the requisite factor of importance would be the grading criteria. 蔄s for me, I will give kudos to these institutions of vision, and appreciate the thought, or historical significance, of what goes into fulfilling said vision. So finally, after all of these years, I actually went to Philippe's. 蔍n case you don't know, Philippe's was actually the ORIGINAL INVENTOR of the French Dip sandwich. 蔄nd, I have to say, they do an impeccable job. When you go, don't look for ambiance. 蔛awdust on the floors, a weird water dispensing machine that I had to ask an employee how to use, and communal tables. 蔕h, and be prepared to wait in line, although it goes pretty quickly; I probably had fifteen people waiting in front of me, but I only waited ten to fifteen minutes. Since neither my girlfriend nor I had ever been, we went bold (as usual), but we went traditional. 蔜he sandwiches didn't look very large, so we split three between the two of us (which was a proper amount). 蔠e ordered: -Beef dip ($5.55), double-dipped, with swiss cheese ($.30 or so extra) -- So this was the original. 蔜he beef was very tasty, and the flavor was certainly augmented by the nuttiness of the swiss cheese. 蔜he bread was a french roll that was clearly freshly baked, and the au jus was very tasty indeed. 蔍t was exactly what you would expect. -Lamb dip ($6.75), double dipped -- The lamb definitely gave the beef a run for its money. 蔖ersonally, I preferred the beef, although my gf thought that the lamb was better. -Pork dip ($5.55), double dipped -- We both agreed that, while the pork was alright, it paled in comparison to the beef and lamb. 蔠ould I eat it again? 蔛ure. 蔠ould I order it again? 蔝nlikely. We also both ordered beers, which were reasonably priced ($3.50 for a Fat Tire and $3.75 for a Dos Equis). 蔍 wanted to order the pickled pig feet, but we already had a lot of food. 蔅ut the best part that I have yet to mention was the dessert. 蔖er the busboy's recommendation, we ordered a slice of the banana cream pie ($3.35). 蔠hile the ratio of whipped cream was a little too high, the banana cream was excellent, with the proper sweetness and creaminess, and HUGE chunks of banana. 蔇elicious. Ah, and don't forget the mustard. 蔍 am still relatively young in my acceptance of mustard as a condiment, but I had to go for the gusto. 蔜his is unlike any mustard I've ever had, and it's a proprietary recipe. 蔠hat, you ask, is the recipe? 蔠ell, my taste buds say a little mustard and a whole lot of horseradish. 蔍t doesn't have the lingering heat of a hot pepper, but it certainly gives you a big fat slap to the face... my eyes were watering wholeheartedly. 蔍t was tasty, and a wonderful compliment to the sandwiches, but hot damn was it intense! 蔕f course, I had to buy a jar to take home! �3.75, in case you're curious. So net net? 蔠as Philippe's the best French Dip I've ever had? 蔔o, it's not. 蔠as it everything that I had envisioned? 蔄bsolutely. 蔛o for being in business for roughly 100 years and keeping it OG at reasonable prices, I'm going 5 stars.

I always get mixed up between Alameda Street and Alvarado Street. but either way, you'll find two great sandwich places. Philippe being on Alameda by Union Station and Langers Deli being on Alvarado by MacArthur Park. At Philippe, we got 2 beef french dip sandwiches with swiss cheese. i normally don't order french dip, but feeling like everyone has tried this place but me, i wanted to see for myself. I wasn't blown away, but for what is, it's pretty darn tasty. the bread was really yummy, with the inside slopping up the dip juice, but not getting soggy. The cheese and meat combo was delicious! Finding out that my mom had come here before i was born was pretty cool! The place probably hadn't changed a bit. It was still packed the day after thanksgiving! I like this joint a lot, but if i'm choosing between the two places again, i'd probably pick the pastrami on Alvarado-although it's more expensive.

Holy Frackin French Dipper Batman! 蔣es, this is an LA landmark eatery. 蔐ots of hype to live up to, and although I've lived in SoCal all my life, it was my first time. 蔒y good buddy James P tried it not too long ago and was stark raving mad about the goodness that is their sandwich. 蔍 know we share similar tastes (and finickiness) when it comes to good food so when he wanted to take me down into LA to try it out, I was more than game. 蔋e's been frequenting this joint a lot recently so he had the quick route dialed in. �Walking in, it had a nice old school feel to it. 蔐ucky for us, it wasn't jam packed so we were able to elbow our way to the counter and place our order in fairly quick fashion. 蔋e's tried all of their sandwiches (except for Ham) and he recommended the pork. 蔇ouble-dipped Pork French Dip Sandwich. 蔅iting into this badboy was heavenly. 蔛uper juicy and flavorful, and with their potato salad... Good LAWD! 蔍t was eyes rolled to the back of your head and savor the experience good. 蔍t's the next day, and I'm craving another one right now. 蔜opped it off with a big fat slice of their Banana Cream Pie. 蔝ntil next time Phillipe... until next time. 蔅rilliant!

Fu*k a beef dip...beef dip, shmeef dip. 蔍'm here for a HOG DIP! and maybe some lamb?...or pigs feet...maybe coleslaw....perhaps apple pie? ALL OF THE ABOVE! why not!? So, my fellow carnivore lil sis had the day off and we decided to indulge in some meat fancy at an OLD school LA institution. 蔖hilippe has been throwin' down french dips since 1908! Get the single dipped Pork sandwich ($5.75) with Jack Cheese ($0.40) along with the single dipped Lamb sandwich ($7) with Bleu Cheese ($0.75) A side of coleslaw ($1.15) and a big ol' slice of Apple Pie ($3.35) Wash it all down with a 75 cent lemonade and a 65 cent iced tea! 蔍 was about to pay when I spotted the lonely Pigs Feet ($2.25) begging to be eaten....whispering my name....needless to say...I gave 'em a good home. We head upstairs and as soon as I plop the tray down I realize....http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/?AxPJlSxkCJVJk3sSTL_8OA?select=troLFiVRvU4?uSFBNJVwAkA "ummmm, i think we got too much food...." 蔍 gnaw on my Pigs Feet appetizer to start....http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/AxPJlSxkCJ?VJk3sSTL_8OA?select=DlktcZ1l2bwcwPlsywwqCA briney, chewy, salty goodness...don't knock it till you've tried it. The Pork dip was juicy, tender, flavorful and perfect with the Jack cheese http://www.yelp.com/biz_�I devoured my half post-haste and then sampled the Lamb...maybe just a tad drier than the pork but it had some serious chunks of tasty lamb with a generous slice of Bleu Cheese... http://www.yelp.com/biz_�the combo worked perfectly...a little gamey, fatty but so very good. The coleslaw was quite forgettable but that Apple Pie was THE way to end a gluttonous feast http://www.yelp.com/biz_�Flaky crust, rich, sweet apple filling all baked fresh from Martino's OG Bakery. My sis and I both agree it was pretty damn delicious and well worth the drive to this LA landmark...but do yourself a favor...save a cow...have a little pork instead, you'll be glad you did. oink, oink.

I've been coming here since I was a teenager and it always stays the same...which I love! My favorites to order are the Lamb sandwich double dipped with swiss cheese, a dill pickle, a scoop of coleslaw or macaroni or potato salad (they're all good, it just depends what mood you're in), any slice of pie (I always get the chocolate cream but the dutch apple and regular apple are excellent as well). It's really hard to decide what to get because everything is good. It's best just to fill a tray full of goodies and share with a friend.

After Langer's hosed us with their "Closed on July 4th and 5th" banner in the window we quickly yelped the next best thing in the classic sammie world and ended up at Philippe for a beef dip. We snagged a spot in the $3 flat rate lot (open until 4pm and you have to leave the keys with them) and made our way in to a packed house. Time of day, around 1:15pm. We waited in the loooooonnnngggg ol lines for about 30 minutes and then it was finally our turn at the counter. Not wanting to be "one of those people" I had our order down. Isabel F. pretty much had zero faith in my Obi Wan ordering skills as she whispered "Apple Pie", Girlfriend, I got the MAD Kenobi skills, pie has been ordered. Rosina did not miss a beat as I rambled off the following (and really, it went like so) 1 Pork single dip 1 Beef double dipped 1 Beef double dipped with Swiss 1 Cole Slaw 1 Mac Salad 1 Chili Bean with Cheese and Onions 1 Apple Pie Me: what kind of cream pies do you have? Rosina: coconut, lemon meringue, banana.... Me: Stop! 1 Banana Cream Pie 3 Iced Teas 1 Lemonade 1 Coke That's it! Paid (only $37.37 + $5 tip for ALL our eats) and our order was ready in about 7-8 minutes. We were then on our way to hunt for a seat with our two trays of eats. Mmmmm....... Verdict = Hot damn it was classically historically good. I mean they have to be doing something right as Philippe dates back to 1908 and the place is still jammin 100 and 2 stinkin years later. LOVED my double dipped beef with swiss. Loved my chili beans topped with cheese and onions. Loved my .65 cents Iced Teas. My mac salad was just ok but a must order as it compliments the beef sammie quite well and the banana cream pie was thick, sweet and delicious. Hugo C. was kind enough to let me snag a nibble of his single dipped pork and oh man TASTY! Isabel F's Apple Pie was quite the pie but would have totally hit the spot if it was heated. As we finished our meal a little after 2pm we noticed that the line pretty much disappeared. So I would say that after 2pm is the time to hit this place up. Will happily return and happily wait and hunt for a seat for these eats any day. $$$$$$ CASH ONLY $$$$$$ But they have two ATM's inside.

I have heard some wonderful things about Philippe's. I had never had a French Dip sandwich and I was eager to try my first one at the place that created it. I was very disappointed. The sandwich was subpar. It was dry and lacked in flavor. The hot mustard was okay. 蔄ll I could taste was horseradish and maybe a little bit of mustard. It added some much needed flavor to the sandwich. I was also disappointed by the lemonade, but it was the best part of the meal. The decor was very interesting. 蔖ictures decorated walls that showed Los Angeles as it grew into the city it is today. I enjoyed walking around and seeing the history of LA. 蔜he prices are resonable for what you get.

I've eaten at Philippe's a couple of times. Usually we go here if there's a special occasion or someone who is from out of town is visiting. This is the original birthplace of the French Dip sandwich. If you order anything else from this place, your doing yourself a disservice. 蔜hey offer different items on the menu, just in case you don't like French Dip sandwiches. Have them dip your sandwich double! It's tasty! When you walk in to order, there are two different entrances. You walk and the lines can sometimes go out the door and you will be standing behind people while they eat. That's not too fun. After ordering your food on their cool menu, you have to wait for the ladies behind the counter to serve you. Don't expect them to move too fast but they do push out your order quickly. 蔜hey do get busy if there are any kind of sports events going on such as Dodgers, Lakers, Clippers and Kings games. Their lemonade is pretty good. I like their French dip sandwiches. They're not too big but you can always order more than one to fill you up. 蔣ou can also add their famous Hot Mustard (at each table) to add to your sandwich. The only problem with this place is finding a seat. Once the crowds roll in it's like every man for himself. You can sit in their booths but finding your own table for a large group is hard. Get some of your buddies to sit and save seats while you order, otherwise it's super hard to find seats. You can park in the back and across the street for this place, but the parking lot is small. You'll be lucky to find street parking. If you haven't gone here, go at least once. You will enjoy a historical Los Angeles landmark!

It's like having sex with a really ugly girl. Sure the act is enjoyable and nice, but it's just not as good as it could be. Maybe it's the hype surrounding this place but Philippe never did it for me. I've been three times and the later two I asked to have my sandwich drenched in the au jus, but still the flavor just wasn't what I wanted. The place is just too "old school" and hokey for me. I guess it would be like having sex with your gandma. *Note(s) - I've only had sex with one ugly girl and that was before I knew any better. And I have no intention of ever sleeping with my grandmas.

Let me start by saying I can appreciate soccer for what it is...hell, I even played it for 10-odd years, but GATT DAM (thx John S) this whole World Cup bullshit is making me feel like a goose having grain jammed down my gullet for the sole purpose of becoming a shmear of entrails on a cracker for some uhh-MAYY-zing person, but I'll probably watch the finals anyway for shits and giggles. *ducks a flying tamale* To somehow try to tie that in, I thought Philippe's was pretty good. I rolled up in there and it was packed...post-Dodger game. Hey look...its Andre Ethier! You've changed, sir...when did you join a gang and shave your head? �Anyway, we ordered 2 beef dips, a turkey and a lamb one. Though I forgot to have them dip the sandwiches, I'll say the meat was solid and flavorful and the bread was good too. And yes that mustard was niiiice. I had a side of chili and a Sam Adams which made everything go down smoooove. And though I might be setting myself up for death threats, it was not as mindblowing as I thought it was gonna be. Since I can be a slave to the hype, I was fully prepared to dole out 5 stars, but no...just 3...that's it, people. But that's what happens when the hype doesn't live up to my mucho discriminating taste buds, to whom I am also a slave. *ducks a flying tomato* However I DO buy into the hype of the nostalgia of Philippe's since I'm one of those weirdos that has strange dreams of finding an old rusty box of Depression-era cash in the wall of an old building, so I give this place an extra star for that. So to close, someday I'll eat here again if I'm feeling all melancholy and shit...or if someone wants to bust their Philippes cherry...or Langers is closed...and J-Town is closed...and Olvera St. is closed. *ducks a flying guillotine*

I love my brother. I was able to drag him out to try this sandwich place even though he hates eating out. We drove all the way to the outskirts of Chinatown, where as kids we spent a lot of time shopping around with our grandma. After a good 30 minutes of catching up in the car we arrive at this seemingly run-down building. As I stepped inside the building, I felt like I had traveled back in time. Everything from the neon signs, the menu, to the outfits the employees were rocking were as original as the restaurant was. Plenty of places to sit both upstairs and down with plenty of memorabilia and art thanks to past customers who left messages on the walls of this historic restaurant. Now for the food. When I'm looking to get a sandwich I'm not expecting anything over the top or crazy. Philippe delivers on that promise. I asked for clam chowder, some lemonade, a tuna, and a turkey sandwich and that was exactly what I got. The prices were decent and everything tasted great! My brother was convinced there was something in the bread that made everything very very sweet, and I agreed. After 25 minutes of enjoying our food, the ambiance, and the environment we decided to head back into Chinatown for some nostalgic boyhood shopping. I'll be back.

Philippe the Original was established in 1908. It is said that besides its forced relocation in 1951, the restaurant today pretty much remains the same. Food: 3 stars The French dip sandwiches consist of meat and juice. Its simplicity allowed one to enjoy the natural flavors of the meat. The beef was more flavorful while the pork was thick and tender. The sandwiches were not bad but small. Everything is a la carte. An order of coleslaw cost $1.15, which turned out watery and bland. And the $1.05 dill pickle was quite tiny. Atmosphere: +1 star From its ordering system to its layout of tables and booths, everything was just fascinating! Dining here makes you forget you're in LA. I recommend stopping by if you haven't. The food may be bland to taste, but keep in mind these are recipes from 100 years ago. Just come and check this place out! =)

I decided to get the pork dip with Swiss cheese this time. 蔍 also got a side of the macaroni salad and a soda. I really liked the pork, maybe better than the beef. 蔍 also liked the macaroni salad. 蔍 made sure to not put too much of the horse radish sauce and it was just perfect.

"Dude, what the heck." That's how I felt walking out of Philippe's. I felt let down and misled by my fellow yelpers. sigh. I had a Groupon for a $10 gift cert I bought for $5 in hand, waiting to try out some supposedly GOOD French Dip from this oh so famous Philippe guy. The bf and I each got a Beef Dip, he added swiss while I added jack cheese, plus an order of potato salad. The little old lady behind the counter quickly prepared our meals and within minutes we had our sandwiches and small refreshments on our trays. We both were kind of confused, thinking French Dip sandwiches would be served with a side of au jus, but these sandwiches are pre-dipped.. and I soon learned you can get your sammies double dipped or wet. Where the heck were those options when I was looking at the menu?? We couldn't even tell which sandwich was which, and they both tasted the same anyway. Honestly it's a pet peeve when an order of food comes out damn near room temperature. The cheese wasn't even melted and the beef wasn't anything special. It might've tasted better if the food was actually HOT. Our potato salad looked really mushy and kind of barf-like but actually tasted good, probably the highlight of the meal. If it wasn't for my groupon, I probably would've been more pissed about spending an extra $5 for such mediocre food. and honestly, since you're in freakin Chinatown, you can get way better take out for the price, or even less! as I did around the corner moments later. 2.5 stars. OVERRATED.

"Ohh I know where we should eat! And Don't worry, baby. 蔜rust me, it's nothing strange, or different. It's not Asian cuisine. I think you'll really like it." I cajole. While out and about, me and the man were hungry. And since I am much more familiar with L.A than he is, I made a suggestion to eat at Phillipe which he has not heard of. 蔄 foodie-extraordinaire like myself has a companion who is...not. But, slowly but surely I will lead him into the foodie darkness. As we approach the restaurant, I proudly tout, "Look at the sign! See it's been around for 100 years! It's a Los Angeles historical landmark." He glances at the tour bus that stops, and watches as a bunch of senior citizens exit and head towards the restaurant before he retorts, "Yeah, it seems these people were around when the restaurant was open." "Well, maybe they're just really loyal patrons so that must mean the food is good." We find parking, and head in and see the excruciatingly long lines throughout the restaurant. All the cashiers had a long queue of people waiting to be served. I look around and see many, many older folks. "DAMNIT! Why did the senior citizen tour bus have to stop here today of all places!!" I'm whining, but I really want to eat here so we decide to stay in line to try the food. I will not be turned again like during their Centennial celebration! While waiting, a few minutes later, he looks around and whispers in my ear.. "It smells like death in here." "That's so mean!!" I gasp at his statement and admonish him quickly... however, in just a moment, I see a gentleman....and..... I jab my companion and whisper... "Hi ho...hi ho.....it's home from work we go." He laughs. I laugh. I sing, and he joins in by whistling the rest of the song.. Oh fine, maybe I'm just as bad as he is. "Hey, it looks really busy here.. where will we eat?" he asks. I respond, "Try checking upstairs. I bet you it's empty.... those old people probably can't climb the stairs." "DAMMMMN. heheh.. Okay I'll check." I was right, it was very empty upstairs. We have so much fun joking and laughing that we didn't think much about the wait. We get our food -- two beef french dips, and potato salad with a chili and beef stew -- and climbed the stairs.. Never did I feel so young and robust as I did at that moment. The french dips were gooood. It wasn't out of this world, nor the best that I've ever had but for $5.55 I don't have room to complain. It is definitely delicious to come back for. The man liked the chili, and I liked the beef stew -- that was surprisingly really good and a definite recommend as a side dish. We were happy and we were filled. I liked Phillipe the Original very much, and would like to be back soon when I happen to be in the area.

Philippe's (Fill-EEP) is "the Original home of the French dip sandwich". I met up with friends for a Sunday brunch. (There's a parking lot for customers, but I parked off site since I didn't do my research.) Going to Philippe's is like going through a time warp: staff wear old-school diner uniforms, telephone booths are by the entrance, and one can buy candies and the paper right inside. Oh, did I mention they're cash only? If you're short on greenbacks, there's an ATM. Of course, I got Philippe's signature pork French dip sandwich ($5.35): crispy bun, tender meat, the perfect size, pre-doused in gravy. Throw in crunchy pickle spear, a few spicy yellow banana peppers, a refreshing lemonade (75 cents), and a sweet, rich macaroni salad (1.05), and you have a satisfying, filling brunch. We crowded at one of the many long, communal tables by the cashiers, each table bordered by equally long lines of hungry customers. There we dug into our sandwiches. Not sure I'd get a French dipped sandwich again (at least not there), but I appreciated the experience and would return for their breakfast offerings.

When I went to good old SC there were so many places to go to eat/drink/shoot the breeze/take dates. El Rey's. Julie's. 9-0. Tommy's. Dr. Munchies. 32nd Street. Lucy's. CPK. Lawrey's. Mongolian Breakfast. Pantry. The list goes on and on ... But perhaps, there is the best of all if you love your beef sandwiches wet. How can you not love Philippe's, it's a total LA institution that man, woman and child of every race, color, creed and nationality visit to have their sandwich dipped in a salty, tasty, beefy broth of warm liquid. What a concept. It may sound a little strange but believe me, it's awesomely good to the Nth degree. This may be the first thing that the French have ever done right, the thought to dip a piece of bread in sauce to make it more flavorful. WaLa! Eureka! Magnifique! Actually, now that I think about it, they probably just dropped one in by accident and sold it anyway. The only problem is that it is always really, really crowded with people from everywhere, esp. the SC/downtown clientele. So if you are in the in-crowd it's pretty cool to just show up and see who is there you know. The coffee is still NINE cents, yes, NINE cents and the potato salad is still awesome and cheap. The mustard is the best and if I was a thief, I would steal a bottle every time I came in but why bother cause you can buy one at the counter along with the T-shirts. The beef is sliced so thin you don't even have to chew it, it melts in your mouth. The bread is so fresh you can smell the fresh yeasts yeasting away. The cole slaw is crisp, creamy, tangy and you can watch them making it all right in front of you, so fun. So 400 reviewers can't be wrong. Drive down to Chinatown, find yourself a parking spot and wait in line to have the best sandwich in the world along with a side of slaw and 2 or 3 cups of delicious home-brewed coffee. Meet a friend or two too.

I finally had a chance to stop by Philippe and check out the home of the French Dip. Overall, I would say I was satisfied. On the way back home, I decided to bring back a beef, pork, and lamb sandwich. The first two I ordered dipped and the lamb was dry. I think I'll stick to the dipped version in the future. The beef and pork were much tastier than the lamb (which was a bit tough and dry). Though juicy and tender, the pork was a bit salty compared to the other two. The winner, by far, is the original beef dip. It seemed to be the most balanced of the three. The wife would disagree (since she loves her some salty food and pork), but throw a touch of Philippe's spicy mustard on that bad boy and it's lights out, sandwich! Now, I'm not normally a dipped-sandwich kind of guy, but Philippe's version is something I could probably get used to. Along with a side of slaw, these sandwiches were very satisfying indeed. I rarely find myself in these parts, so I'll be happy to return anytime I'm in the area. I happened by in the evening, which wasn't too bad in terms of waiting time. I'll bet lunch time is a real bitch, though. As many of the other 500+ reviews state, this is definitely a must-try when in LA. Now, anybody up for a sandwich run?

This place doesn't need help attracting business. I think their food and word of mouth does a bang up job at convincing people to come to Philippe's, but of course it helps to have shows like Hell's Kitchen and Man vs Food promoting how tasty their french dips are. Now while I found their food to be wonderful (4 stars!), I also discovered that their service is horrendous (-1 star BOO!!). The lady who took my order had that attitude and look on her face that she didn't give a flying f*k about anything or anyone. And her bad service came across in my order. I asked her for a Double Dipped Lamb Sandwich with a side of Potato Salad and a Banana Cream Pie for dessert. And I asked her to also place an order to-go for a French Dipped Beef Sandwich with the Au Jus on the side. Mistake #1: She gave me pork instead of lamb and still charged me for the lamb. I didn't make this discovery until after I left. And yes, the pork sandwich was good... but I really had my heart set on trying the lamb so I was sorely disappointed. Mistake #2: I asked her for the au jus on the side for my to-go order. Just in case, I asked her before I walked away with my order if she put the au jus on the side. She gives me a dirty look and says yeah it's in there. I kind of peek into the bag and feel it a bit and asked her again politely if she was sure and she shot me another dirty look and dryly responded yes and went about starting her next order. Later, I found out she had gone and double dipped the to-go sandwich so by the time my friend got his sandwich, the bread was soggy. Ok so just 2 mistakes. But 2 very big mistakes in my book that make me look at Philippes differently. As for the food. Like I said before, I still found the pork french dip to be tasty. But the pork meat was riddled with ribbons of fat which was slightly a turn-off for me. The beef sandwich, despite the soggy bread, was still good too. I say pass on the potato salad, I didn't notice anything particularly amazing about it. 蔜he banana cream pie was really good. I'd say there's probably an entire medium sized banana in each slice. The cream was really light, which was nice too. Next time I'm back, I truly truly hope that service is better and they get my order right so I can try their lamb sandwich.

First Stop in the French Dip Battle What's a French Dip restaurant doing in the middle of Chinatown? Dude, it's LA . Oh, right. So we walk into the cafeteria-style communal dining area and the place is bright, lively, open and airy. 蔈veryone who is seated and eating seems to be enjoying themselves and everyone in line for the sandwiches seem barely able to contain themselves. 蔄 Good sign. So we hop in line and begin the waiting game.... Oh crap.. Cash Only! fortunately, they have third-party ATMs on-site (with the accompanying fees, of course). 蔭s we waited we decided to try out the lamb, the pork and the beef dips. 蔠e almost got to the end of the line when suddenly ..."Line is closed! 蔣ou are the last customer for this register" a lady yells out to the couple in front of us without even acknowledging my group Apparently, each register has its own individual line, a fact not documented anywhere that I could see. So we move over to another register and along the way encounter a busboy who seemed completely unhappy to be there as he brusquely cleaned off areas beside patrons enjoying their dinner without so much as an "Excuse me" or "mind if I clean this area". 蔊reat service. We finally get our turn at the register and begin to order our chosen comestibles. "We'll have One beef Dip..... One Lamb Dip" "No lamb" the lady at the register quickly broke in mid-sentence" Rather disappointed, we decide to order a turkey dip instead as well as a Pork dip. After a few minutes of waiting, the lady comes back to us..."No Pork!" sonuva- .... The two sandwiches i was lusting after all day and neither one of them is available..."fine, make it another beef". oh... and a Pecan Pie ..... . Disappointed in the fact that what we had been wanting all day was unavailable, we find ourselves a table and fire the opening salvos of our little French Dip war. Honestly... it wasn't bad at all. 蔎uicy meats, flavorful au jus, and bread perfectly made to soak up all the wonderful juicy drippings. 蔋ell, I even enjoyed the Turkey! The topper though was the face-kicking mustard. �蔖ut a little too much and you'll feel like you got crane-kicked by Ralph Macchio. 蔊ood stuff. So far, so good... there were a few misses, mostly in the area of service and the lack of lamb and pork options, but for now, we'll save that as encouragement for me to re-visit and hopefully apply extra stars.

This was my second visit to Philippe's, so I decided to be different and order a ham french dip sandwich. According to their website, "PHILIPPE "FRENCH DIPPED" SANDWICHES are a delicious combination of a crusty French roll dipped in our own authentic "jus" created from our freshly roasted meats." Imagine my surprise when the ham for my sandwich was pulled out of the refrigerator, and was placed on the sandwich cold. Not quite what I expected. (My brother had the beef dip, and his meat was served warm). Still a great restaurant, and the historic ambiance makes it all worth while. Not the best french dip sandwich I've ever had, however.

When confronted with multiple lines, do you always find yourself picking the line that always ends up taking the longest? Then if you move to another line, that line you were just in, suddenly speeds up? I swear, it always happens to me, whether it's changing lanes in traffic or in the grocery store. So now I make it a point to always stick with one line, no matter what. But it sure puts a strain on your patience. I found myself waiting in line at the famous Philippe's, and the whole time I felt like I was waiting at a train station with the clusters of people around me. Only this train wasn't about to move anytime soon. There was only 3 people ahead of me in line, but both lines around me moving rather quickly, everyone whizzing by with their trays full of juicy french dip sandwiches. My stomach growls. Oh why, oh why. After what seemed like an hour, I finally reach the front counter. I felt like Raphie in the Christmas Story, meeting Santa for the first time at the mall. I was hungry, ready to order, ready to eat the famous french dip. The lady getting my sandwiches, on the other hand, was in no particular rush. She... took... her... sweet... time. I wanted to scream. Finally, I was ready to dig in. I squirted a bit of the hot mustard on the beef, and took my first bite. I immediately tasted the combination of the light and airy baguette bread, the tender slices of beef, and the juiciness of the au jous. About a few seconds later, it hit me like a buzzsaw. That hot mustard immediately cleared my sinuses and watered my eyes. It felt like my nostrils were literally on fire. After the burning nostrils sensation subsided, and I finished off my french dip, I thought that it didn't quite live up to expectations, in my book anyway. I just wanted more, either more meat or more flavor. Maybe all the other renditions of french dip in other restaurants have altered my taste buds, I don't know. Overall, the french dip was okay, but I don't think I'll go out of my way fighting through downtown traffic for it. As for that hot mustard, I think my nose hairs are still recovering.

Philippe's is a pre-Dodger game ritual for a good friend of mine and myself, but I'm not upping my rating based on sentimental value. Honestly, up until my last visit, I would have given this place a ho-hum 3 stars. I'm a huge fan of French dips, and until recently I never really thought much of the sandwiches here. I thought the meat was too dry, plus I'm one of those that prefers to do the dipping myself with my own cup of jus. So what changed? Two things. One, I read an article in Edible Los Angeles (Cantor, Gerard. "The Original: Philippe turns 100." Edible Los Angeles, no. 2, Fall 2008) about Philippe's history. I learned about how every morning, Elias Barajas, the kitchen manager, goes out to buy fresh vegetables at the local market. Every night they get rid of everything and start the next day with fresh ingredients. I learned how Philippe's still gets all of their ingredients locally, including local bakeries for the bread and desserts, and a local meat supplier, despite the fact that Los Angeles has changed so much over the past 100 years and many of the local farms are no longer around. I learned how most of the people at Philippe's have worked there their whole lives due to the great benefits and family atmosphere. The article made me see Philippe's in a whole new light, and I love the emphasis on fresh and local. Two, reading so many Yelp reviews over these past couple years taught me the secret of the Double Dip. I mentioned above that previously I always thought the meat was too dry. Voil� ask for a double dip, it's an instant cure, bringing the sandwich to the perfect amount of moisture, not so soggy that the bread falls apart, but just right. Next time I might try ordering "wet" to see if that is taking it too far or if I'll like it even better. So this time, I looked around, and really took the whole experience in in a way I hadn't done before. My double dip beef was delicious, and the bread was perfect. Also I got brave and tried their homemade hot mustard. Wowza! That will clean your sinuses for sure. I love, love, love the fact that iced tea is still only $0.65 and coffee is only $0.09 (honestly, drip coffee has no business being more expensive than that anyway!). As usual, the line goes quickly and the carvers at the counter are quick, friendly, and efficient. I crossed the sawdust-covered floor and sat down at one of the long wooden tables, and I found myself instantly welcomed into conversations with the other people sharing the table - whether it was about the Dodgers, the food, Los Angeles, or whatever. The closest thing I could compare it to was hanging out at the Woolworth's counter back in the day. I found that I really missed that kind of experience, and realized Philippe's really is a treasure. I'm so glad it's still here, and that they still stick to their principles of serving fresh food made from local and ingredients, for a reasonable price.

Philippe's has been around since 1908. Lets put that into historical perspective. Notable occurrences in the year 1908: -Ford Model T goes into its first year of production -Bulgaria declares its independence from the Ottoman Empire -First death by airplane crash Over 100 years later!!! The place is still standing and is strong as ever. With its famous French Dip sandwiches and reasonable priced classic American fare, Philippe's has the ability to attract people from all walks of life. Locals, tourists, foodies, and even old-timers craving a little nostalgia, make their pilgrimage to this LA landmark. 蔍 been here too many times to count and have never seen this place empty. �My pops has been taking us here since our family migrated to America in the 80's. 蔄nd since moving away from LA a few times, a fresh Philippe's French dip reminds me that I am home, it has become my comfort food. �My usual order: Double-Dip Lamb with Bleu Cheese, laced with Philippe's signature hot mustard, a side of potato salad, and if I am feeling like a fatty, throw in a pickled egg. 蔍 know it's a bit heavy, but I am not one to count calories. ��I also recommend the beef stew, as it is hearty and tastes like your grandmother made it. 蔛imple, tasty, and homemade. 蔠ash it all down with a 65-cent iced tea, 75-cent lemonade, or the cannot be beat 9-cent cup of coffee. Take that Starfucks. Always Recommended

100 years, and they're still a big hit in L.A! See the thing I envy with a lot of people who live in high density populated areas filled with tourism and culture, is the fact that so much history and character is embedded in the area. With that said Philippe's is one of those places that LA residents can be proud of flaunting as a long standing tradition to the sandwich munching masses. I came here with fellow Jonas-T, half Bboy/half foodie. I was never aware of such a spot until I vaguely remember a huge thread posted about their centennial anniversary some time ago. In any case, we arrived in a limited space parking lot (so be patient, if you cannot find anything immediate). Walking inside, we found a great line to accommodate to all the customers who came to try their famous French dip sandwiches. After arriving in the front of the counter, this is what I ordered: -1 side order of Custard -1 side order of Macaroni Salad -1 cup of lemonade -1 Lamb Sandwich Jonas and I sat down, and first I tackled the mini-custard side order. The custard, was a bit bland..I wasn't really happy with my choice to purchase it (considering I felt I could make it better). Then, came the Macaroni salad another decent dish, a filler but a lot better than Tommy's (in Irvine, Ca). The lemonade was sweet and cheap (sounds so wrong), but hey at cents to a cup, who am I to complain? And for last, we come to the lamb sandwich. Now as my experience of Subway, Tommy's, Canter's and other spots I was very skeptical as to the conclusion of this meal. So after one last look (with a spread of hot mustard on the lamb inside, per suggestion of Jonas), I sank my teeth into it. Wow... It was delicious, the bread wasn't stale at all, soft enough to chew but hard enough to keep the contents of the sandwich from spilling. The lamb, was super tender and I couldn't help but take back all the pessimistic thoughts I had initially of this place and its sandwiches. Overall, the sandwich is what notched up my original rating from three to four, simply because this type of food ceases to amuse me (let alone sustain me throughout the day). Great job Philippe's! Your determination at perfecting the recipe for a 100 of years is a testament provided by the awesome sandwich you provided me and everyone else daily, now hit the 200 year mark!

Apparently this place is much more popular now after being mentioned on TV..Man vs. Food (great show btw, go watch!) Yes, all of the dips are good, but mine will be dedicated to the underdog. 蔜he lamb french dip sandwich is sooo tasty! And if you like lamb, you have to try it! 蔐AMB FRENCH DIP!! I know ingenious, right! And its fresh--cut straight from the hunk of meat! The potato salad was pretty good, although I wish they used more paprika instead of just sprinkled on top as garnish. I always order extra pickles. 蔜he famous hot mustard is very very hot, so use with caution. 蔍f you love that sting your nose and bring tears to your eyes feeling of wasabi, you'll love this mustard! Dab a bit on a knife (fork, if you're accident prone) and taste it first. 蔜his jar of mustard will definitely be used on future homemade prime-rib, my mouth is watering already! Long lines, beware. 蔈specially weekday lunchtime.

Pretty good place. Fast service and tasty sandwiches (check out picture for prices). The meat is so tender you can cut it with a spoon. Their Phili mustard definitely had a bite to it and went great with the sandwich. The pie looked good, though I didn't have any. (3.25 a slice) The only problem I had with this place is that I prefer to dip the sandwich myself. I want to decide how much au jus goes with my beef. Maybe I'm just being picky .....

3.5 If I could... The concept of French-dipped sandwiches is new to me... or *was* rather. 蔍 grabbed a French-dipped turkey sub, a bag of chips and a coke (was my first soda in nearly a year!). 蔜he sandwich was good, didn't get soggy at all... I was expecting a mess. It was a clean eat. Both me *and* my white pants were grateful. �The restaurant itself is pretty cool. Old remnants of the early days in Chinatown, faded newspaper clippings of past successes in the food industry and trinkets of all sizes act as restaurant decor, all of which has accumulated over decades. 蔄 series of old phone booths lined the wall across from where I ate while the TV blared with the sound of cracking baseball bats. 蔐ocals, commuters and first-timers all gathered for an indulgence of 蔉rench-dipped subs. 蔛weet pickled eggs? They got those too. Wine? Check. An extensive menu affords an array of individuals their choice of home-style cooking. The sawdust chips on the floor and family-style dining lends itself to a homey, casual dining experience. In my experience, these types of restaurants are fading fast. A shame, I know. Was heading to the Yelp Elite Event at Cirque Berzerk and Met Austin S. Laura B. and Jackie G. for some grub. 蔛tarving, I inhaled ( yet still enjoyed) my turkey French-dipped sub and drooled over the chocolate pie that I had regretfully left no room for. 蔕n another note, although I do not frequent the downtown area (also regretfully), next time I venture out that way, 蔍 will definitely be stopping by Philippe's for another dose of French-dipped 'wich. (Keep in mind I have a strict set of rating criteria.)

The Plan: 蔊o check out one of the L.A. spots from Man v. Food. Woman and Man v. Food was a delicious match up! The long lines of people at 2:30 pm on a Sunday afternoon was surprising. 蔅ut Woman and Man bounced back and spent the next 20 min. deciding what to order while inwardly cursing the cute grandparents ahead of them who apparently ordered sandwiches for every single one of their 15 grandchildren. Finally, Woman and Man shoved $25 in Philippe's face and Philippe's countered with Turkey with Swiss and Beef with Blue Cheese Sandwiches. �Double dipping here is not a social faux pas but is in fact encouraged, so the inside part of the French sandwich rolls were thoroughly covered in savory, flavorful jus.) 蔖hilippe's also chucked a Dill Pickle, Lemon Meringue Pie, and Baked Apple across the counter. The sandwiches and pickle were awesome but were even better with the house made Hot Mustard. 蔜he mustard was delicious at first but then seconds later the spiciness hit hard like a punch in the gut. 蔐uckily, Woman and Man weren't fazed by the mustard sneak attack as they love the spicy. 蔊luttons for punishment, they contemplated a round two of sandwiches but were dissuaded by the lines. Philippe's faltered with the Lemon Meringue Pie. 蔍t wasn't very lemony and the crust was crumbly and tasteless. 蔋owever, it came back strong with the Baked Apple. 蔍t had just the right amount of softness, sugar, and spice but Woman and Man destroyed it. �Had it had been heated up and served a la mode, it would've been a TKO.) The Result: 蔠oman and Man got some great grub and Food got two more devoted fans. WIN-WIN. Looking forward to the rematch! Note: 蔜his review is dedicated to Em, my foodie soulmate. 蕏o

Philippe's is part of the fabric of my being. When the man I was to eventually marry moved to Los Angeles and asked me for the quintessential Los Angeles lunch experience, we took the bus to Union Station and ate here. �I was elbows-deep in a double beef dip when Jim Hahn blew through here, gladhanding, camera crew in tow, during mayoral elections. 蔍 shook his hand. 蔍 probably got mustard on it. �When I started teaching in East L.A., I would come on lunch runs here, an empty box in hand to carry all the food. 蔕nce, when I rattled off an order for ten without notes, a man gave me a card for his lighting business and said, "With a memory like that, you should be on my team." But it's not that I have a good memory. 蔍t's that Philippe's has given me good memories, and that to me, their sandwiches have meaning and soulful heft. 蔍 had my first slice of blueberry pie here, my first pickled egg. 蔍 remember waitresses who've worked the counter, including an astoundingly tall Russian girl who made me think of that song from Sesame Street that goes, �One of the things is not like the others..." Judge me as you will for loving Philippe's. 蔛ome people waltz in here, eat the culinary equivalent of Jesus' Love, turn to their boring-looking friends and say, "That 蕎as pretty good, I guess. 蔍 prefer Langers. 蔔o big deal. 蔆ostco." Whatever. 蔜ake it however you want. 蔄s for me, I will take sawdust and blood jus, stew and saltines, brown dresses and white aprons. 蔍 will take Philippe's, just as it has taken me and made me who I am today. 蔖ure Los Angeles, down to the bone.

I'm giving this place an extra star for a couple of reasons, but foodwise they were a 2. Ahhhh Phillippe a Los Angeles landmark that is 102 years old! Where you can still get a cup of coffee for 10 cents, they've got an old school candy counter, a simple yet extensive menu between breakfast, lunch, and dinner, and have communal seating for everyone to mingle and soak up a little bit of L.A. history. This place is huge with both upstairs and downstairs seating and is always packed, but the friendly staff manages to keep the long lines moving quickly. The owners definitely seem to know what they're doing over there (they must know to still be that busy all the time after 102 years!) The general vibe is a happy one as everyone scurries around the sawdust lined floors to find their ideal table to enjoy this L.A. staple. I started off by enjoying a cup of their beanless chili: http://www.yelp.com/biz_�and not that I have an aversion to beans or anything as after all I am part Mexican, but I wanted to stick strictly to the good stuff. Yes the chili itself and the abundance of delicious meat. I thoroughly enjoyed this chili. It had a nice little bite to it like chili should and was not stingy on the meat at all. I just might have to make a train ride up next time just for a nice hot heaping portion of the bowl of chili. For the sandwich I decided to stick with the original French Beef Dip: http://www.yelp.com/biz_�and it was pretty good. It didn't blow me away or anything and I've definitely had better elsewhere. The bread was nice and crunchy on the outside and quite soft inside and the meat was decent; perhaps a little dry (I should have had the sandwich double dipped) and provided just enough to make me feel comfortable by the time that I left. Now why they get their extra star: Nostalgia, communal abundant seating, friendly, smiling, and quick staff, vibe, 10 cent coffee, reasonably priced beer, size of establishment, easy secure parking, and value. I got my whole meal including a soda for under $10 bucks. I can see why so many people make this a stop on their L.A. visit, lunch hour, or vacation for its sheer nostalgia. One last thing...don't forget to bring cash with you as they do not accept cards.

I'm going to go against my normal rating philosophy and invoking the "sum of the parts is greater than the whole" clause in my Yelp membership. Typically I would use the very unbiased "average" method for a restaurant where poor service could bring down the ratings for great food to give an establishment a lower overall rating. For Philippe's I am working in reverse. There is really nothing 5-stars about Philippe's. The food is good, the atmosphere is good only if you are into nostalgia, the location pretty much stinks, and waiting in line is never cool. But despite all of that I crave Philippe's. I mean really crave it. Sometimes I'll checkout the Amtrak schedule and try to justify a $32 round trip train fare just so I can get up there and back without traffic. It's cliche to call Philippe's and institution but it is. Philippe's is a place that my grandparents went when they were kids. My parent's went there often when they were in college at USC. I grew up hearing about this place with the promise, "Someday we'll take you there...." I was never a big French dip guy in the first place but with all of the hype Philippe's received from the family elders I figured it would be one of those experiences that would knock me over. Kind of like the first time I had a funnel cake at Knott's Berry Farm. My first experience at Philippe's was during my freshman year at USC after a football game. Back then the family would go up for 12:30 game at the Coliseum and I'd walk over from campus. After the game we'd usually go out to dinner. One time my parent's decided on their own that it was time to go to Philippe's. What an eye opener that was. The neighborhood Philippe's is in today isn't the best but trust me it used to be worse....a lot worse. Not only was I walking from my parent's car with my head on a swivel, certain that we would be attacked at any moment, but when I saw the ancient cafeteria style counters and sawdust on the floor I knew this was going to be unlike any dinner I had ever had. Moments after we were inside some transient fellow decided to kick in one of the windows sending shards of glass into the restaurant. It will probably surprise no one that I didn't return to Philippe's during the remainder of my time at USC. But then a few years after college I went back. I knew what to expect and the lack of exploding windows made the experience better. My palate was expanding and I learned to appreciate the hot mustard (which is 5-star mustard) and the crusty texture of the bread. A few more trips followed and it got better every time. I then started to learn more and more about the history of Philippe's thanks to The Food Network and Huell Howser which made me love the iconic restaurant more. Yesterday afternoon my dad and I decided to go to the 4:00 football practice at USC. Practice was over by 6:00 and neither of us wanted to fight traffic back to the OC. Philippe's was going to serve as our traffic oasis. I now know exactly what I like and in most cases need from Philippe's. Lamb sandwich, single dipped, with blue cheese, macaroni salad, lemonade. No it's not the best lamb sandwich but it's pretty darn good. As I was adding the famous mustard to my meal I looked at the window that was kicked in on my first visit. 蔍 do this during every visit to Philippe's knowing it is some sort of therapy for conquering my fears. I noticed other people that we had seen at football practice too. They had kids in tow, some of them might have been grand kids. They probably heard the same stories I had heard about this place and I watching them is like a window into my childhood. �On the way out I bought a jar of mustard for home. It never lasts long in my house and at $3.75 a jar it's a steal. �So that's reasoning for giving 5 stars. Great mustard, lots of memories and a world famous sandwich. I don't think I need to justify any more than that.

Old school look AND old school prices! The lines are super long but it goes by pretty quickly. There's sawdust on the floor, and plenty of seating especially upstairs. It kinda has a cafeteria feel to it. Their french dip sandwiches are only $5.55. They dip it for you, either single-dipped or double-dipped. I got their beef sandwich, single-dipped and it was pretty good, not too soggy. I really liked their macaroni salad too. They also have hot mustard on the tables that you can put on your sandwich but BEWARE! This isn't your regular yellow mustard. It's more like wasabi/horseradish so don't put TOO much or you'll need to drink a lot of lemonade to wash the taste down. Hmm.. maybe that's why their lemonade's only $.75! �) Parking lot across the street. Cash only! I guess they're old school in every way. :P

Most of you reading this already know Philippe's is the best at what they do, but for the few of you on the fence about this place listen up. If you love sandwiches and a great atmosphere this is the place for you. Philippe's has been around for over 100 years, so it's kept a lot of heritage to it's style and taste. The lines may be a little scary at first, but things move fast there. Let's just say when you get to the front, you better know what you want. Or if you like a more casual atmosphere come back closer to closing, the survive just as fast, but with less of the chaos. The main dinning room is decked with old pictures and culture. The floors are sprinkled with sawdust that add a nice texture to the overall feel of the restaurant. I've gone 3 different times and have tried a different sandwich each time. I've had the Turkey, the Ham, and most recently the Beef. The Beef Dip is by far my favorite, and is really the reason you would go to Philippe's in the first place. I topped it off with some Blu Cheese and helping of their custom Spicy Mustard. Be cautious with how much you use of that stuff, if spicy isn't your thing this may not be for you. My buddy I took tried a little dabble and it nearly knocked him over. All around great food, the sides are great and if you've still got room they've got some killer deserts. Enjoy!

The upstairs reminds me of my old beat up high school. Crappy graffiti everywhere, lunch tables, separate rooms that resemble and smell like classrooms. The downstairs looks like a cleaned up Honky Tonk. Big long community tables & sawdust on the floors. The food is cheap. I'll give them that. I also heart the spicy mustard....A LOT! The think i dont get is why they dip the sandwiches for you. The whole idea of the French Dip is to dip your own sandwich yourself! Now, I know the history of the place, and how the guy accidently dropped the bread into the au jus, and that became the birth of an era, but I want to dip my own sandwich, damnit!!! None of this single dip, double dip or triple dip crap, I want to dip it at my leisure. Maybe I want to just drop the whole thing in the juice and wait for it to all solidify... ok that's gross, but if I wanted to do that, I would like to at least have the option. The cole slaw was pretty good and the potato salad was almost mecca. I like the deli style counter with the long lines. It was worth it taste-wise. I still want to dip my own damn sandwich, though.

Don't believe the hype. How Philippe's became an institution, I'll never now. The idea is great, the food is not. If you like grade D over cooked roast beef, Philippe's is your place. The french dip at Houston's is FAR superior to Philippe's. With that said, it is cheap and the kitch is great. You will be transported to another era when you enter but, like I said DON'T Believe the hype!

Dips in order of amazingness: Turkey, Lamb ,Beef ,Pork Haven't had the Ham dip yet. Blueberry pie. +1. PROTIP: Eat your dip with an order of potato salad. It's smashing stuff. Be prepared for wasabi-up-your-nose like spiciness from the Philippe's mustard that sits on all the tables.

This was my first visit to the famous Philippes. Had the beef dip with a side of potato salad and a lemonade, all for around 8 bucks. Correct me if im wrong..arent french dips supposed to be somewhat juicy? My dip was dry and flavorless! �����蔄dded some (alot) of their mustard to the sandwich. Hahaha wow that stuff should have a warning label on it!! Its good if you like dijon mustard on steroids. The potato salad and lemonade were both good..the dip was very disappointing. I might give this place one more shot, only because umm 4 stars over 1,000 reviews...yea. Still dont get it.

Overated. After watching Man vs. Food LA, I wanted to try the infamous Philippe's ORIGINAL French dip sandwich. 蔍 was stoked when I came here for lunch because there was no line and I heard the line gets crazy in here. Waiting too long for food is sometimes rewarding but most of the time ANNOYING. 蔍 ordered a single dip Pork Dip with swiss cheese and a side of macaroni salad. I like having my french dip with the dip on the side because it keeps the bread crunchy. 蔅ut since this is a traditional/ original French Dip place, I decided to get it the way they serve it. 蔜he bread was soggy as I expected and there was just not enough flavor overall. I probably would've liked it better if I got the dip on the side so I can control the amount of dip to put on the sandwich. 蔜he macaroni salad tasted really bad. 蔍t was watery and sweet... I didn't like it at all but I unfortunately gobbled it down because I was still hungry after eating one sandwich -_-; The whole restaurant is very old fashioned. 蔜he place looked like it has been kept the same since they opened, which was a 100 years ago. 蔜hey serve everything on recycled paper plates. I was pretty disappointed overall, but I will give this place 3 stars since they have been here for 100 years and they serve THE ORIGINAL French Dip sandwich. 蔍 guess being original doensn't make you the best, but I give them credit for being around for so long. 蔆ongratulations on the 100 year anniversary (soon to be 101 years in October).

This is MY family restaurant. My grandfather started coming here in the early 30's and went regularly till he passed in 93, that's about 60 years...wow...that's alot of beef and pork dips. One of my earliest memories is of the sawdust on the floor..I must have been 3 or 4..So I guess I've been coming here for about 45 years...Without a doubt my favorite sandwich ANYWHERE. DOUBLE dip please! Prices have gone up, I remember when they were $3, my Gpa talked about when they were a quarter. Funny....I'm so not a spicy food kinda guy....but sit me at a old brown booth at Phillipes....and I'll eat so much of their spicy mustard....that I'll cry so hard people think I just came from a funeral! Potato salad is good, Coleslaw is amazing!....soooo sweet...double dip beef dip and a can of coke.......Mmmmmm I'll never stop coming here....for me it's the ultimate comfort food. So many memories... Oh, and we always called it Flippies....(inside joke)

Wow This place is amazing. I had a few of the friends from yelp say it was really good ! So I had to try this place out already. I mean how can you go wrong if it has been there for 100 years already !! I am a little bummed that I didn't get to try it out sooner than now ! I had the beef dip not double dip because to me one dip already in that sauce is good enough. I don't really like soggy bread. The sandwich was really really good though! It had the right amount of meat and the right amount of sauce! I enjoyed it a lot and I have to say that I was really full after eating it. I didn't order any sides just because I wanted to save room for dessert and try out that tapioca pudding that a lot of yelpers were writing about. I had the pudding and that was my first time having tapioca pudding. It was a little bit sweet for me and I don't think I liked it. I would say stick with the sandwich and you'll love it ! :) Oh by the way the sandwich isn't at all expensive ! :) Also the lemonade which is like 70 cents or something like that is very very small so if you want maybe you should order two.

What more can one say about a place with over 1000 reviews? ����I remember coming here when I was a tween and having the same sandwich possibly made by the same staff as the one I tried just two weeks ago. ��Yes this place is an institution in Los Angeles and everyone should come here to try it for historic reasons if not for culinary ones. Oh and btw that banana cream pie is damn good too. "Its like Jesus opened up the sky and shines a light down just to hand you this pie, it is that good." Says the person I came with who told me to get the pie, must be pretty great since neither he nor I are huge lovers of JC but he said it with conviction so I must believe ;-)

In the years that I have been working in South LA and sometimes driving by on my way home, I've never stopped to give this place a try. To be honest...I never even noticed this place before. And I have to admit...I've been missing out. A friend decided that this was the place he wanted to go to to celebrate the new job he got. I personally though it was kind of strange place to want to go to, but hey, that's what he was feeling. The first thing I notice coming here was the abundance of FREE parking. For those not familiar with LA, parking can often times be an issue, so for me this was a definite plus. The place operates more like a deli counter, you wait in line, order your items, pay and find a place to sit and munch away at your spread. The wait itself wasn't too bad, maybe 10 minutes from the back of the dinning area to the front counter. Now, being I was in a French Dip joint, I ordered a dip sandwich. My wife and I got the Beef and Turkey respectively. She got her's with Swiss, while I got mine plain. In addition to our sandwiches, we got the cherry pie, potato salad, custard, and a pickle. The dips were both good, but both the wifey and I preferred the beef over the turkey. The beef dip had much better taste and was much more moist, as the turkey one wasn't anything special, and the meat was slightly dry, especially considering that they reuse the wonderful juices from the meat. On a side note, you need to use the In-House made Spicy Mustard. It's doesn't have the hot spicy flavor like chilies, but more like the burn of wasabi or horseradish. This was something that I just absolutely loved, I covered my halves of my dips in it. Another great thing about this place...9 cents coffee and 75 cents ice tea and lemonades! The side orders didn't really have much to comment about, but the Cherry Pie was so good. The pie crust had the perfect consistency being perfectly flaky and yet still deliciously buttery. I'm looking forward to giving the other pies/desserts a try as well as the other dips....next up pork and lamb! So for now remember to live well, but eat better!

Love the French dips at Philippe the Original. The long line is worth queuing in for a fatty, meaty French dip sandwich, drizzled in gravy juice. That wonderful gravy elixir is sweet ambrosia on a kaiser roll. It's like a Dunken donut you dunk into a great cup of coffee. It's greasy, soggy, but taste so good. It's sooo good, but soooo bad for you. 蔅ut some times you need an unhealthy meal. Yeah, sure you'll regret eating the French dip afterwards (damn, high calories), but in the moment you enjoy this wonderful delight. Ahhhh... I love the French dip sandwich at Philippe's. Give me a Philippe Frnch dip, a cup of coffee and a Philippe slice of meringue pie and all is well in the world for me. Philippe's is an LA treasure and landmark. May it never go away.

(1 Best LA Sandwich down...16 more to go -- from a 2010 Los Angeles Magazine Best Sandwich List) I finally made it to this historical place--located just North of Union Station. 蔍 went early for lunch so I was actually able to find parking in the adjacent lot. 蔜hough the lot is quite big, it was still hard to find parking (and I think I may have accidentally stolen someone's spot). 蔍 imagine when it is busy, finding parking is nearly impossible. The inside of the restaurant is actually fairly big. 蔜here are communal tables and then some regular tables. 蔜he floor is covered with sawdust. 蔣ou order at the counter, and servers/cashiers are everywhere so you kind of line up like you would at a grocery store/Target (find the open lane). The sandwiches are priced well at $5-$6. 蔍 went with the beef dip (double dip). 蔍 should have went with the single dip for the bread was a little soggy at the edges. 蔣ou can also do "wet," but I couldn't imagine why. 蔜he sandwich is simple and quite good. 蔍t has a sweetness to it, which is surprising. 蔜he bread is soft. 蔜he meat was good though a tad dry. 蔍 did prefer this French Dip to the one served at Cole's--Philippe's French Dip seemed more like the ones I have eaten in the past. 蔜hough I think Cole's utilized a better quality of ingredients. The sandwich was served with potato salad, which was decent. 蔍 also had a slice of pecan pie, and it was very good. 蔜his French Dip place is definitely worth giving a shot if you are in the neighborhood.

I think my love affair with Philippe's has grown. I think I would want to have a good sandwich than have sex. Or maybe sex with a hot girl would still trump the sandwich, but in that situation I would be doing it with a dipped sandwich in my hand. Now, I think I have planned perfectly when to go to this place to avoid the monstrous lines. I won't be telling you when, because I don't want to wait in line. But remember to bring your stomach here. For the people who have trouble with their dip, try the regular if you are receiving something too wet, and vice-versa if you are getting a dry sandwich. However, you can never go wrong with a double-dip. As for the other food, I never really was there for anything other than sandwiches and cole slaw. And I am sure you aren't going there for anything other than that either. As of the past few years, Philippe's celebrated their 100th anniversary with some cool merchandise. Of course, I love bobbleheads, so I got a Phillipe bobblehead made by Funko. Very cool! The people who work here are really nice as well. I got served by a really tall Russian woman. I think she was 6 foot 4. Seemed kind of out of place, but still very cool. My only beef is the fact that Phillipe's always closes at 10pm. This sucks when there are Dodgers games end at 10pm or later. So, you would never be able to have some sandwiches unless it is a day game. I wished they would change it until 11pm for home games. Different generations and different backgrounds all dine here for a reason. If you make something good, the people will come.

So I went to Coles 2 days ago (see review) and today, 蔍 went to Phillipe for lunch after an appointment in downtown. 蔍 wanted to do a fair comparison while Coles was still in my intestines. I have to say the Phillipe's still has a better tasting sandwich and a better sandwich roll. 蔍 usually go for dinner and it's not that crowded. 蔜he lunch business is booming and I believe the servers give more meat than the night shift. 蔜he cole slaw was pretty good. 蔍 also ordered their chili an even though it wasn't as thick as others, it was super tasty and with a little bit. 蔜he meat is shredded very much like the way Chasen's used to do it. 蔜ry the chili, you wont regret it. 蔄lso 10 cents for a good cup of joe is always a good thing.

I am the 990th person to review Phillipe's and it's STILL The BEST french dip roast beef sandwich ever!!! I want to go again right now and I just had Phillipe's for lunch on Monday. I rarely give out a 5 star after one visit, AND, I'm sorry Cole's - I don't care if you claim to be the originator - you closed for a while, then tried to reinvent yourself. But, when it gets down to brass tax, Phillipe's is AMAZING!!! I went with 2 coworkers who were also sold on Phillipe's. One had the lamb, which was also tender and delicious. It's simple - pickles, roast beef french dip sandwich hand carved in front of you, horseradish dressing on the side, casual bar-stools, and family style tables with sawdust on the floor, names engraved on bricks on the walls, PACKED, but line moves quickly, and free parking in the large lot on the north side of downtown LA. Enough said.

I can't believe I've not written a review of this place. I saw it on the Food Network a very long time ago and when I got the chance I took it. I thought the place looked a lot fancier on TV! When we got there it was just like a strangely set up place where you stand in line, order, wait for the food right there and they give it to you on a tray -- yes, a tray. So the first time I went there I was a little taken aback by the whole experience. I was also not too happy about the fact that they refused to not dip my sandwich and serve me the au jus on the side. I hate soggy bread and that's exactly what happened on the first visit. My French dip was so soggy the bread fell apart and became this gloopy mess. I was highly unimpressed. I also tried one of those purple picked eggs and I must say, DISGUSTING! Don't even be curious about it, it's THAT gross. So I went back again recently and had the lamb French dip, this time, telling them to go light on the au jus. That seemed to keep the sandwich a little less messy but nonetheless, the less than inspiring roll really does nothing for the sandwich. I like the lamb but I just feel if I had a ciabatta or something to sandwich it in, that French dip would go from a 2 to a 10 in no time. The sides such as coleslaw and mac salad are extra, you order a la carte, but why bother? I make better mac salad at home. Both these sides were underwhelmingly bad. The tapioca pudding was kinda gross too. It wasn't soft and creamy but rather, had the consistency of regular pudding. On our first visit the lemonade was good, on the recent visit, I noticed that they had pre-glassed the lemonade and they were sitting behind the counter all lined up in a glass with ice. Now, what if no one orders the lemonade and it's been sitting there for god knows how long with the ice melting away inside..... that would surely mean a watered down lemonade which was exactly what we got on this trip. Overall, not worth the hype -- especially not if you are driving a long way to actually eat here. I would return if I was in the neighborhood and was dying for a French dip sandwich, however, I highly doubt that is a feeling I get on a regular basis anyway, so it's a moot point.

Sandwich was great! LAMB SANDWICH, DOUBLE DIPPED: (as raved on Yelp) Yes, it was GOOD! So good with their PHILIPPE'S HOT MUSTARD. Everything was just perfect. ----------------------------------------------- MACARONI SALAD (side): Super cheap & DE-LI-CIOUS!! I'm a HUGE fan. Drooling as I type. ----------------------------------------------- PHILIPPE'S HOT MUSTARD: So good that it's being reviewed. I don't like hot sauce (EVER), but this stuff is O-MA-GAH good. I should ***WARN*** you that this stuff has side effects. You make not feel the heat now, but you'll feel it a few hours later. In the bathroom. Do I need to say more? So be easy with that stuff! =========================== DECOR: So old fashion. Which is what they're going for. The thing on the floor is to absorb moisture - the old fashion way! SERVICE: QUICK & NICE. First time going there (brother is a veteran) and I had a hard time. Finally I just gave in and ordered the lamb. CHECKOUT: Was odd. There's this guy that sits in the back and handles ALL the money. The waiter/server aren't allowed to touch the cash. You have to put it on the tray. Yes, these people speak French! French native here and it was fun talking to them!

SOOO GOODDDDD Came here for the first time in the summer, and can honestly still taste the roast beef, au jus, lemonade, iced tea, potato salad, and of course... that evil, evil, evil spicy mustard. To call it spicy mustard is just an understatement. 蔍t seriously tastes like it'd be wasabi's evil twin, if that even existed. 蔈xpect to feel like you're gonna pass out if you put too much of it on your sandwich. 蔍 made that mistake by pre-gaming my sandwich. 蔐earned from my mistake and just decided to put on a little each bite... Stupid mustard. 蔋owever, it's still VERY delicious! The sandwich is AMAZING. 蔍 really wish I ordered 2 of them instead of having some potato salad, but hey, that was good too, so I guess I couldn't complain. 蔋ot, tender, and full of flavor. 蔄dd some cheese if you want, but the beef, au jus & bread speak for itself. 蔔ext time I'm definitely trying the lamb. Notes... -You can get it dipped a few different ways, so if you're unsure, ask the cashier ladies! -Spicy mustard is spicy -CASH ONLY -Lemonade, coffee & iced tea are SUPER, EFFING CHEAP.

Philippe! Who hasn't been there right? Well Philippe is another place that I seemed to miss yet everyone ventured out too so one evening my friends and I went to pick up some grub. We got inside and I was AMAZED. Is it midnight? Are we at a packed Hollywood club? I was told it's always like that. Packed with people waiting in line to get some mmm mmmm goodness. We waited in a line and got served by the really tall European lady. Roast Beef dipped sandwiches. Mmmmm. There is nothing wrong in that fragmented sentence. LOL We got sandwiches, cole slaw, potato salad, macaroni salad, and pickles. Oh! and the mustard! YOU MUST PUT A LITTLE MUSTARD ON THE SANDWICH. MmmmmM. What an awesome dinner! OH! REMEMBER IT'S CASH ONLY. I didn't know until I got to the front but thank goodness I had cash left over from clubbing the night before. :) Yay! Man! The sandwiches are FILLING. I got to about half and was full but knew I couldn't save it since it was dipped so I ate some more. LOL oh well. It was worth it!

Philippe you get 3.5 stars. There was quite a bit of hype about Philippe so I finally got sucked in. Despite the Travel Channel and Philippe great history, I didn't get the WOW I was hoping for. Respect for inventing the French Dip, but the original isn't always the best. Like the Apple One computer, it sucked and all the windows based PCs dominate still until present day. I'm ashamed to say.. Yardhouse has a better French Dip. You got beat by a chain Philippe. Don't get my wrong Philippe is good shieet it just didn't meet up to the hype. I came only to try the Beef and Pork sandwiches. After tasting my dry "double dip" style, I wanted more. Its only about 6 or 7 bucks per sandwich, but let's be realistic if you are Man Vs Food like me.. You will order at least 3 or 4 sandwiches. Raising the average price to about $18 to $24 for a grown man. Not to mention CASH ONLY! Damn you... built in 1908 today is 2010 please take plastic. I think the best way to experience Philippe is to try it all. You have to order pie, Cole slaw, chili, apple pie, and other endless sides. Also, order a variety of drinks because there are no refills. I saw some Philippe veterans ordering beer, ice tea, and lemonade. I feel like such a rookie, but my quest was for the sandwich so maybe next time I will try the bomb looking side dishes. I recommend Philippe to anyone that was curious. Its a great local snack. I love traditional old fashion restaurants. Sometimes you need a break from Chain restaurants. A customer on TV said, "I drove a hour for this.." You lie! I drove an hour, but it doesn't make it better. BTW the spicy mustard is bomb, but don't try it if you don't like horseradish. Try to go on a Sunday. It wasn't crowded when I went and it was easy to find parking. Close FREE parking is a miracle in LA, but a standard everywhere else.

This place has rave reviews and my husband can't stop talking about how much he loves their sandwiches. 蔍 like French dip sandwiches as much as the next person, but I can't imagine going all the way up to LA is worth it just for a sandwich. 蔠e finally came here when we were in LA for a concert, and I have to say I left very unimpressed. The sandwich was alright....it was good, but I would never rave! 蔜he meat was normal, the bread was good, the au jus was average...even their famous hot mustard wasn't hitting the spot. 蔜he place itself has a lot of character, as though they opened up shop inside an abandoned school cafeteria. 蔍 don't think I'll go out of my way to come here; in fact, I don't want to come here even if it's on my way. 蔍'd rather have something else.

"Dedicated to G, a foodie, who may or may not ever find this...but shared his secret recipe of chili and fritos..." G Foodie invited a group of us to try Phillippe's, which by cultural and time/space continum standards, is an institution. 蔄 crazy institution, but the good kind. �To the uninitiated, Phillippe's is located in Chinatown and is 100 years old. 蔠ow, that's old! 蔍t's like this old-shiny beacon of meat glory with old telephone booths and an old-fashioned candy counter. 蔖arking is difficult to manuever but it's much better accross the street. 蔎ust don't bang into some old guy's benz there because the whole lot is swarming with them... You order counter style until you notice the guy with a child's dollhouse on his head. 蔜hat is crazy!!!! 蔋e has a two ft wide/long plastic dollhouse strapped to a bicycle helmet on his head and cleans up trays. 蔒y first thought: Gotta Yelp that! �What is even more crazy is the long long long lines (and there are 10 of them or something) in the middle of the day in the middle of the work week. 蔋ow come all these people can come here in the middle of the day? 蔒aybe this is what retirement is like...eating double-dipped sandwiches in wooden booths.... I got a double-dipped beef sandwich with cheese which was good, but not super fantastic great. 蔠hy is everyone so crazy about it? 蔜he bread is a little dry but at least the meat is flavorful. �Then there is the chili...G Foodie is a carnivore at heart and taught the group how to dip fritos in their chili. 蔍t's like the perfect pairing of meaty salty goodness. 蔛ometimes I have cravings for fritos and chili because of this one time. 蔋mmm... makes me want some now.... Overall, it's a "must try." 蔒aybe I'm the one whose crazy just because I'm not crazy in love with Phillippe's... Chili and Frito's, anyone?

Downtown LA is such a dumpy wonderful shit wonderland. You turn down one street and you're face to face with about 50 homeless people. Then you turn on another street and you're right in front of a trendy wine bar, THE MUST or a hip sandwich restaurant, Cole's. But never mind those fancy spots -- let's walk further down Alameda Street, a few miles from Olvera Street. There, one of the most revered and sought out French Dip sandwich restaurants in Los Angeles...Philippe's. �In this day and age, you can get a French dip virtually anywhere -- but, you haven't had a French Dip until you've had one of the originals from Philippe's. Big French bread stuffed with warm roast beef and doused with Au Jus and served on a paper plate. There. Eat it. Get a side of the potato salad; it's delicious. Try the tapioca pudding. Cole Slaw? Go have at it! What I loved most about this landmark restaurant is it's huge popularity. So many people of all walks of life visit this place for one simple dish...lines and lines of foodies form daily just to get in on the French Dip action. The restaurant itself is almost like a deli/cafeteria. It's old and shabby; nothing pretentious or even nice about it. It's just a place to go grab a sandwich and park it on a stool. It definitely takes you back to a time where good food didn't come with an obnoxious price tag or fancy garnish -- it is what it is, was and what it will always be...honest and good.

Over the course of my 24 years of life, I frequented Chinatown maybe a billion times. I basically grew up in Chinatown, I went to the elementary in Chinatown for crying out loud, so I basically knew the place like the back of my hand. I always knew Philippe's was down the street from the CBS Seafood Restaurant that I would always visit for dim sum or dinner with my parents. Never did I ever feel compelled to try Phillippe's out until I started yelping. Seeing all the different pictures had me convinced, I had to try it at least the one time. I arrive on a busy day, not really knowing what to expect. Best word to describe this place is CROWDED! All this hype must be true if the lines can be compared with the DMV. I am super excited, patiently waiting in line. I stare down at the menu out of curiosity, but in my mind after reading so many reviews, I knew I had to try what everyone else is raving about to see if its true. Hi Ill have the French Dip Beef Sandwich with a potato salad and a Fat Tire. I pull out my wallet and pay showing my credit card. Cashier lady: Sorry we do not take credit cards, cash only. Me: WTF LADY YOU SERIOUS! (in my head) Me: Lily you have cash? Ben sister Lily: Yeah here. At that moment I was annoyed that they only accepted cash. What if I didnt have cash and I waited in that long DMV line? I would have went crazy!!!! Times have changed and I live and die by debit/credit cards. I get my order, not within the specific time frame that Philippe's claims and sit down on a table disappointed about the whole credit card ordeal. Next big annoyance, used silverware and dishes were left out waiting to be picked up. Wow... After clearing off the table, I take a good look at what I ordered. The sandwich was not the size I imagined, so was the portion of potato salad. A couple bites of the sandwich and a few spoonfuls of potato salad and everything was gone. DING DING DING DING DING!!!! The crowd goes wild!!! A new world record has been set, 2 minutes! Not because I have a habit of eating fast, but due to the lacking of size from the sandwich and the mini scoop of potato salad that I received. My taste buds go in shock, I had no complaints, I thought the sandwich and potato salad lived up to the hype. The fat tire increased my level of enjoyment but what beers don't make everything taste that much better? Glad I ordered the beer, or else I would have still been hungry. I know its not good to criticize a place for their portions when I know that I clearly have a eating problem. Not my fault though!

I see Philippe always show up on the list of Los Angeles best kept secret. I have to wonder who hasn't heard of or been to Philippe's. It is an iconic Los Angeles spot and there's a reason for it. You open the doors to feel and find sawdust on your shoes. I generally believe this is a good sign of an establishment feeling good that their food is that high in quality. I always suggest that anyone get their sandwich double dipped because what sane person would not want more of that au jus on their sandwich? They are famous for their spicy mustard. Let me tell you, it's very spicy but well worth the burn. Have no fear, there's glasses and a tap for water near the seats. And as studies show, you can get both the tastiest and prescription filled water in Los Angeles. Your mileage will vary on how well this effects the taste of the French dips. Another must is a sliced dill pickle on your plate. Your choices of meat is varied and I normally pick Lamb or Beef. There's also different cheeses that you can get put on for a little extra. Blue Cheese is on that list and I have to question my atheistism in tasting that combination. This is a very casual meal. You get your sandwich on what looks to be a recycled paper plate. Find your seat and enjoy the company. Every time I've eaten there I've either been dragged or struck a conversation with who ever was at the same table as me. The drinks are cheap. But the serving size isn't that large. I usually get at least two or three of the lemonade or iced tea. Sugar it up to your liking. The busy times is during lunch. That and before a Dodger game as it's been a custom to pick up a French dipped sandwich for the game since as long as I could remember. They also have many items on the menu that you normally would not pick up. Pickled eggs, pig parts you may not normally want to try and it came to a surprise to me a couple years ago, that they have a full breakfast menu. Now I'm not one to eat much on the breakfast menu but from the suggestion of random people on the same table with me, I had it one day. It was huge portions for a tiny price and it was good. If you've never been to Philippe's, go. Once you do you'll know why it has been a Los Angeles establishment for this long.

I don't care if 500 other yelpers reviewed this place before me, I have to say something about Philippe's!! 蔍 believe Philipe has been around since the 1920's and when you walk in, it looks like it hasn't changed one bit since then. �In my family its a tradition to stop here for lunch or breakfast whenever someone is taking a train from Union Station which is across the street. I also used to come here as a little girl when we'd visit my grandmother in East LA. My mom used to stop here when she was a very young 19 years old while on her way home from a job in the downtown area. Whenever I stop in a Philippe's I imagine my mom rushing through here in the late 1940's/early 1950's with her immaculate outfits complete with matching shoes and handbags. 蔋ow come women don't dress like that anymore?? She looked hot!!! Where was I? 蔕h yes, the food!! The roast beef with au jus is the featured lunch item, and there's a long standing dispute with another local reastaurant over who invented to famous sandwich. 蔛ometimes I order the lamb sandwich which is tender and very tasty. 蔄lways, always ALWAYS order the potato salad it rocks! If you have room, have some pie. Did you know that this place also serves a fabulous breakfast??? You should try it.

So funny because my family and I go to Chinatown at least two to three times a month to eat, see the Chinese Herbalist, visit an Acupuncturist, have dim sum at CBS Seafood Restaurant which is right behind Philippe's and I never walked in here until I saw that it was featured on Man V. Food (and because of that we had to make a special trip here just to try one of their french dipped sandwiches). I'm glad they have their own private lot because that means free parking!!! Definitely a good thing because everything around the vicinity cost to park - and remember kids, it's a "Cash Only" place so bring some paper cause it would suck to have to pay for stupid ATM fees to take money out of the machine they have inside. I came on a late Saturday afternoon where it wasn't that busy, the lines were short, and it didn't take long until it was our turn to order. I skipped breakfast that day so imagine how much of a hungry fatass I was by noon, I wanted everything off their menu and I ended up ordering the: Pork French Dipped Sandwich - $5.55 Macaroni Salad - $1.10 Cup of Chili - $2.00 Kosher Dill Pickle - $1.00 Iced Tea - $0.65 The sandwich was oh so satisfying! The pork was nicely dipped and not at all greasy, the bread was soft enough to have that french dipped texture but not soaked which is what I don't like. The macaroni salad on the other hand I didn't like because it had little pieces of macaroni and it was a bit too relishy for my taste. Having a side of the kosher dill pickle was definitely a good idea because it gives it a nice good crunch after consuming all that protein and carbs. As for the chili, it's nice to have something liquid-meaty to go with all the crunch and the chomping I was doing, and ending it with a nice cold glass of Iced Tea? SO GOOD!

Wow 1,030 reviews for Philippe's? 蔍 guess mine really will not matter...good because I don't eat meat and I can't review the French Dipped sandwiches which they are famous for. So for you non-carnivores I will give you my review. �First off I love that there is actually parking here. 蔍 mean damn if it is impossible to find places to park in Downtown and Chinatown which is not a problem for me because I can walk BUT...not on a crazy rainy windy day like today. I came here at lunch time and the parking lots were full but I got lucky and found one spot. 蔜he inside is pretty big with long tables but don't sit down first go to the counter and order and wait for your food. 蔕h and don't stand in those 2 long lines...look to your right there is probably no one in those lines (group mentality I guess). I ordered the soup of the day which was either corn chowder or split pea...I ordered the split pea and a side of potato salad...I love potato salad. 蔒y SO ordered a beef french dipped sandwich (they do have beef, ham, turkey, lamb too) They also have breakfast, tuna sandwiches, pickled pigs feet and eggs and much more. The dips here do not come with a side of au jus. 蔜hey actually dip the inside of the bread before they add the meat. 蔜he tater salad is ok...nothing special. 蔜he split pea was good...a bit oniony (I make up words as I go) but it worked for me. �I really do like the atmosphere but...I think I like the OTHER dip place a bit more but I will come back and try some of their other soups. Located in Chinatown near Union Station and Olvera Street

Phillipe, much like the Pantry, has basically earned its respect by becoming Nosferatu; the undead; it cannot DIE, you see. It has been here for such a long ass time that the immediate presumption is: they must be doing SOMETHING right, right? Right?! So I had the turkey. Jordan and Katie both smacked their foreheads and were like "AWWWW, dude, what are you doing??" so maybe that was my first mistake, but... survey says: Not Impressed. In fact, the whole "dip" thing just kinda made my sandwich wet and nasty. And you think we can maybe do something about the weak ass bread? Even cheese couldn't save the day on this one.

I had a double dipped pork sandwich with some mac salad the other day. 蔜he pork sandwich was just pork - and - bread. 蔜his only reminds me that sometimes you can't beat simplicity. 蔜here's nothing bad that I can say about this sandwich. 蔜he bread was friendly to the roof of your mouth and the pork was damn tender Well... the only thing I didn't like was that they were strategic when deciding how big the sandwich should be. 蔣ea having one hit the spot, but theres like that little bit more room you'd have in your stomach to eat another if you wanted to. 蔜hat's gluttony for ya. BTW, their mustard sauce has some heat. 蔍 think it is mixed with horse radish sauce but damn, that little squeeze bottle is like the icing on top

I'm going to dispense with the pro's and con's of the actual food and tell you why I like this place. �1) 蔍t's a historical landmark that harks back to a simpler time in the annuls of Los Angeles. 蔎ust look at the old-school phone booths and the candy counter if you need further evidence. 蔜alk about stepping back in time when you didn't have to worry about what kind of car you drove or what the hippest place in town was! 2) 蔍t's a port-in-the-storm for all comers from all walks of life. 蔜here are no reservations here. 蔜here are no "power" tables. 蔈veryone stands in the line the same way, and everyone sits on the same communal tables the same way. 蔍t's the proverbial great social equalizer and it works perfectly, because everyone appreciates the food, regardless of who they are or what they do. �3) 蔜hey've kept their prices reasonable, from the sandwiches, to the lemonade, to the coffee. 蔈specially the coffee, for a dime. 蔄re you kidding me?. 蔜hey could gouge people by capitalizing on their status, but they haven't and I appreciate that. By the way, I happen to actually love their sandwiches. 蔍'm the furthest thing from a food critic or food snob, so it's entirely possible to get better food elsewhere. 蔅ut better food, ambiance and history? 蔔ot a chance in hell, Sunshine.

Walking into Phillippe's for the first time almost resulted in an about face trek back out the front door. Long lines, no visible tables to sit at and the place looked like it has not been remodeled since the 50's. This was not what I was expecting from the alleged birth place of the French Dip. As we stood in line debating if we wanted to leave and go somewhere more comfortable and inviting, a wonderful vibe swept through the air and it was difficult if not impossible to ignore. As I looked around, I noticed a common theme within each individual waiting in the multiple lines stretching 10 people deep. Everyone seemed genuinely excited and happy as if they were already were clued into a secret, something that I would come to understand immediately once I take my first bite into a Phillippe's Beef Dip. Suddenly, everything made sense... the d巆or, the lines, the overall friendliness from the staff and patrons. I stepped back into time and into a better place. Parking was a breeze thanks to the two large lots dedicated just to Phillippes the Original and the prices were extremely affordable. The food lived up to the hype and I could not be happier with the entire experience. Next time, I'm double dipping.

Straight and to the point: I was a Philippe's Virgin till the other day. I really don't know why. Finally decided to give them a try and I was not disappointed. The nostalgia is great. The location so close to both Olvera street and Chinatown is perfect. The drive from my house is easy being that I took the carpool lane all the way down the #10 freeway to the Alameda exit. Parking is great as long as it's not the lunch rush. We got there around 11:30 and by the time we left it was full. The Sandwiches were so good. I tried 4 of them. Beef and pork at the restaurant. The lamb and turkey I took home for later. All of them with cheese. � sides including potato salad and macaroni. Overall the food was spot on. The sandwiches are a perfect size for a great meal. The sides were very traditional with lots of relish which my wife doesn't like, but I found to be fine. I still can't believe that this was my first time here. I will definitely be back real soon. Have to try the Chili at least once. Keep up the good work Philippe's. May you be around for another 100 years. Cheers~ ps~ They have my favorite Cabernet of all time on there "per glass" menu. 蔛pottswoode $15.00. 蔜hat is actuallyl a pretty good deal being that the wine goes for buck twenty fiver per bottle.

I don't get it. I love French Dip sandwiches. I love independently owned restaurants. I was absolutely starving tonight. This place gets amazing reviews all the time. The perfect storm. I truly expected love at first bite. I ordered the lamb because I generally like the uniqueness of the flavor. I took a bite and the bread was soggy... not au jus soaked and hot and steamy... just mushy and lukewarm. The meat tasted like it had been made a LONG time earlier, and wasn't fresh. I thought that perhaps I just ordered wrong, so took a bite of my friend's beef sandwich, the original original. It was similarly underwhelming. I asked my friend his opinion, he agreed about mine and his. He moved on to the potato salad. Took one bite. Said it was bland. Didn't finish it. I moved onto my pineapple pie. I love pineapple, I was excited. It wasn't as good at the $3.99 pies on sale at Ralphs. We walked out, disappointed. I have no idea if this was an off night, or what. But it was hard to believe that this place would even stay in business, based upon the food we had tonight.

This place has a lot of history and hype. However, 蔍 personally don't see the whole fuss about the French dip. If I could describe Phillipe's in one word it would have to be... Overrated The atmosphere and the building are historic Los Angeles. It is worth a shot and one would go here either because of the vibe, as a tourist destination or as a foodie that has to give this highly popular place a try.

Let me just start off by saying that I was never a fan of french dip sandwiches (notice the 'was'). 蔍 never enjoyed the dry sandwich that I had to dip into the au-jus and was left with eating the soggy, just soaked sandwich. 蔅UT that all changed when I came here. I wasn't excited at all coming to this place, even though I've heard about them countless of times, and 蕎e definitely had to try it since it was on The Boyfriend's and I's list of restaurants to try while we were in SoCal. 蔠e went into the place, and found a lot of people actually there. 蔜he place was really roomy and had a lot of picnic tables, so you were able to find a seat pretty quickly. �We ordered the beef french dip along with a side of macaroni salad and potato salad. 蔄t first, I thought we were missing the juice for our sandwich, but they actually dip the bread for us already. �I looked at it, and thought I was just going to have a 'Meh' type of reaction, but it was surprisingly really delicious. 蔜he bread wasn't so soggy, the outside of it had a nice dutch roll crunch to it, and the beef itself was just soooooo good!! 蔝sually, the meat on these would be tasteless and dry, but the one here was very juicy and tasty! 蔍 was really surprised by how much I enjoyed their french dip; it automatically made me a fan french of dip sandwiches.

The majority of reviews for Philippe usually start out with, "I had a friend in from out of town..." And my story is no different. DK was in town for a quick visit, so prior to his arrival, I sent him an eating agenda. On the list was Philippe, which he had heard of, but had never tried during previous trips to LA. We had to be at the Rose Bowl for a soccer game, so we made this a stop along the way (because I don't drive the 110 towards Pasadena unless I HAVE TO. I got a double french beef dip, I think he got the same with Swiss cheese, and we shared a mac salad. Since we were too hungry, it was the perfect snack-type meal. I hadn't been there in a couple of years, and it was just as good as I remembered it. He thought the flavor and the bread were perfect. I like the fact that the customers are made up of locals as well as tourists. Always a great stop on the way to/from Downtown LA or Chinatown. And a great place to take out-of-towners for a little bit of LA history.

Some top choices from a long and varied menu: Lamb Dip, Beef Dip, Cole Slaw, Pickled Eggs, Potato Salad + Baked Apple is a great dessert ( and healthy yet ! ) We buy several jars of their special hot mustard to use at home in making 蕄otato salad, egg salad and deviled eggs ! 蔎ust not right without it ! Open 6am to 10 pm. 蔆ash only. �A fun place to be !

YUMMY! 蔠ent there this weekend, ad got kinda caught up in the pre-USC game crowd, but it is always worth the short wait in line. I prefer the good old beef dip - double dipped - with swiss cheese and a bunch of their super spicey hot mustard - and spicey in the nose hot! �which you can buy by the bottle and take home! - great for salad dressings and meat marinades) Their beef stew is also great, and because my husband is lame, and doesn't like the sandwiches, I know...he's lame sometimes, I ordered him the chili this time & he loved it! They also have a great wine list that is reasonably priced and good beer on tap...like Fat Tire!

Alrighty fellow yelpers if you live around the LA area and never heard of this place, I'm sorry to say this but: a) you're missing out and b) You must be living under a rock! Either way I suggest you get there quick and order your self a sandwich! This place has been around for years and still has amazing food and great prices! I prefer the Beef French dipped sandwich however I don't like mine too soggy so I ask them to lightly dip my sandwich- that cures the soggy bread syndrome. I also enjoy their sides such as the potato and macaroni salad. Their beef stew is pretty good as well, if anything just a bit bland. They serve sodas there, coffee, and lemonade. They also have a cute little old fashioned concession stand there that sells candy and what not. You want to try to beat the rush or make it there after, however if you get there right at the rush don't worry multiple lines and the professionals handling the sandwiches makes the lines move quickly and there are always places to sit.

Really, really delicious french dip. I like that it's not too salty, I feel like too many places use bouillon or something for their au jus. But I guess the original french dip wouldn't be that way. I took the advice of Yelpers and ordered the potato salad. I did not regret it. Simple but delicious. As a tourist, I didn't mind waiting in line but I probably wouldn't think it was worth it on a regular day . . . I think the fact that it was so crowded prevented me from enjoying what seemed to otherwise be a cool atmosphere. I'm a slow eater and near the end of my sandwich I saw some lady hovering by our table. Not that I blame her but it's unnerving. Anyway, delicious food, my only real criticism is that they charge for pickles. I am serious when I say that's why I'm only giving four stars. Not the line. $1 for 1 pickle.

Visited 2 friends out in the LA area, and I wanted to stop by here after seeing this place on Food Network for french dipped sandwiches! Parking is in private parking lots. 蔍t was packed, so we were worried about finding a spot, but we were lucky to immediately find a spot upon arrival. 蔠oot! Upon entering, you reach a roomful of people (at least 50+) just waiting in line and my immediate thought was oh no. 蔍t's going to be a long wait... but we only waited about 25 minutes to order, receive our food, and find a table. 蔔ot bad! http://www.yelp.com/biz_�http://www.yelp.com/biz_�We ordered the following to split amongst 3 people: 1) Beef Sandwich - really good; we ordered 2 sandwiches but had 1 of them added with Jack Cheese; I personally prefer the Beef Sandwich with the Jack Cheese the best http://www.yelp.com/biz_�2) Pork Sandwich - good, but pork was a bit salty http://www.yelp.com/biz_�3) Beef Stew - yum! - this was recommended by a customer who is a regular there; we were chatting it up waiting in line http://www.yelp.com/biz_�4) Potato Salad - good http://www.yelp.com/biz_�5) Cole Slaw - really good... and I don't even like cole slaw 6) Custard Dessert - meh; this was okay to me http://www.yelp.com/biz_�7) Tapioca Pudding - loved this dessert http://www.yelp.com/biz_�8) Lemonade - really good; tasted like real lemonade 9) Ice Tea - really good; tasted like real ice tea Their mustard (which they boast) is also pretty good. 蔞ery spicy. 蔍 personally don't really like mustard but found it very complementary to the french dipped sandwiches. Food was really cheap. 蔉or everything we ordered, it came out to roughly $30. I definitely enjoyed my experience here. 蔋ighly recommended to try out the French Dipped Sandwiches (esp the Beef with Jack Cheese).

Never in my life of 29 years have I ever had a better roast beef sandwich. The sandwich was on my plate for it seemed like 5 or 6 seconds. I would make a trip out to LA just for this place. [ and to see the Dodgers! ] Unbelievable, un-real, and old-fashioned good cooking!

(Was I the only person that hadn't tried Philippe's yet?) The french dip sandwich is a fairly simple one, but I find restaurants have little success making it right. 蔕ften times I find the meat dry, the au jus salty, or the bread too tough. 蔛o when it comes to french dips, I usually set my expectations low. Philippe's isn't anything fancy, but their sandwiches are pretty good. 蔜he meat is tender, the au jus flavorful, and their rolls have the ideal chewiness. 蔜heir coleslaw is sweeter than I'm used to, and I noticed they use a lot of relish in their potato and macaroni salads. 蔍 asked if they made the dill pickles there but they don't. 蔍t's fine though because all of their pickled items are delicious. Two french dip sandwiches, a side of coleslaw, pickled beets, a pickled egg, a dill pickle, two iced teas, and one coffee all for around $18. 蔔ot only have they managed to keep the old-time atmosphere, it appears their prices have remained quite reasonable too.

I thought I should write a review on this place because I come here pretty much at least once a week. This place, for what it's supposed to be, has no flaws. 蔜he only fault it has is that you might end up waiting in line for up to 30 minutes, depending on what time of the day you get there. �Lemme break it down: The Dip They are famous for their French dip and once you try it, there's no question why. 蔜he beef is pretty much perfect. Good texture and nice and warm. 蔜he au ju is excellent too. 蔄sk for your sandwich double dipped! 蔍 usually alternate between the turkey and the beef, just because turkey is healthier. 蔍t is, however, not as moist. 蔍 also always get bleu cheese with my sandwich. Sides: The potato salad there is pretty much the best potato salad I've had in my entire life. That's not hyperbole. That's just the truth. I'm not saying it's the best in the world, just the best that I've had. 蔜he cole slaw is fresh and crisp. 蔜he mac salad, I could do without. It doesn't taste bad at all, but it just makes me feel gross after I eat it. Special Hot Mustard This is it. This is what people keep coming back for. It's the damn special sauce. If you told me they used human turd to make it, I'd still use it. 蔜hat's how good it is. The spicyness isn't the hot-on-the-tongue type, but rather it hits the back of the nose like wasabi. 蔅ut it tastes so much better. Breakfast Their corned-beef hash -- excellent. 蔜hey have this salsa thing they provide at the counter that you can put on your eggs, hashed browns, or whatever. That's probably the best thing about breakfast. �Costs A dip sandwich is about 5 bucks and change, but if you want cheese, it'll run you past $6. 蔜hen, if you want a side of potato salad, slaw, or mac salad, that's another $1 and change. 蔠hen you add tip (and you should tip because the lady taking your order is also the one making your food), it comes out to about $9 per meal there. It's come to the point where I have to eat here at least once a week. 蔍t's an addiction. 蔛o, ask yourself: how good does a place have to be for you to get addicted to it? 蔕k, I know some smartass will say that crack doesn't have to be good for you to get addicted to it, but you know what I mean.

It was okay? 2.5 stars. I first found out about this place on Man vs. Food Los Angeles episode. 蔋e made the meat sound so juice and the sandwich so tasty. 蔅ut when I got it, it was too dry and not that flavorful at all? There was a lot of traffic getting there from West LA, but it wasn't too bad. 蔖arking is a bit packed but I found one pretty easily. 蔠hen I got in I found that the line system is pretty stupid, because you're standing in line between tables where people actually sit... why would you arrange it that way? The menu is decently large, the iced tea and lemonade were cheap. 蔍 got a double dip roast beef and my friend got a double dip turkey. I tried both of them and honestly the turkey to me was better. 蔜he sandwich was A LOT smaller than I thought I would get, and like I said before, much more dry than I thought. The seating area wasn't bad, wooden tables, looks pretty old, but pretty clean. There are way better options for sandwiches out there, this place is honestly overrated. 蔍t's a good place for locals to come and eat. 蔍 see a lot of elderly and families come here probably because they live around the area and this is such a traditional place, they just keep coming back. All in all, it's worth a try just to try it, but nothing special at all.

Oh Phillippe's, you have won over my heart. Wednesday was my first time here and I'm glad I finally got around to trying it. I ordered the french dipped beef sandwich as well as a slice of chocolate pie. The sandwich looked pretty plain when I first saw it but once I took my first bite, it became an instant favorite. I loved that in it's simplicity, the sandwich was full of flavor and had it's own unique taste. The spicy mustard made my eyes burn yet it was really good, and I refused to complain. My total was around $11, pretty moderate. Phillipe's was everything I had expected and so much more.

The Original Philippe, home of the French Dip, one of LA's best kept secrets and so on. 蔜his was supposed to leg 4 of a pre-game, Yelp Taste of LA, with 3 of my buddies before the big Dodger lovefest at the Coliseum. �Well, due to some parking complications and the fact we were STUFFED from legs 1 thru 3 (Langers, Scoops and then Roscoes), leg 4 was put on hold. 蔠e went onto the Coliseum, settled into our seats 1000 miles from home plate, right next to the LOUDSPEAKER, for several innings of ugly baseball. 蔄t least we think it was baseball, we were so far away it could have been soccer. 蔄nyway, once the Dodger deficit became too great for us to believe in them, we started brainstorming about hitting Leg 4 after all. �Josh 1: 蔄nyone know how late Philippe's is open? the crowd: 蔔ot sure Mike: We can call and find out, it could be open til 10pm. Josh 2: Go for it, google-411. ring ring ring Philippe's: We're open til 10pm. Crowd: Great, we have 45 minutes lets go! 蔠e only have to walk back through campus and greek row, hop in the car, fight possible traffic and get there before the doors lock. �9:52pm - we make it!!!!! �So since the sandwiches are small and Legs 1-3 had been walked off, we ordered several Beef, a ham and a pork plus about 12 lemonades since they are CHEAP and TINY. 蔜his place is definitely a taste of history and considering I've been to Dodger stadium hundreds of times, I can't believe I never stopped before. 蔜he ham was pretty average. 蔍t tasted like a ham sandwich with some beef (?) au jus on it. 蔜he pork was better with a good seasoning to the meat and went better with the au jus. 蔜he beef was the best though. 蔔ow I'd prefer a cup of au jus on the side but this way was fine for quick eating. 蔍 can see if you waited too long, it would be a mushy mess. �While I didn't get it, the chili looked outstanding and something I will try in the future. 蔅onus points for the place staying open til almost 10:30pm while a bunch us watched the end of the Dodger game (with them closing the gap to 7-4). 蔉or no other reason than the history and the novelty, everyone should try this establishment. 蔍 look forward to stopping by before a Dodger game and reveling with the pre-game crowd in the near future.

Photos Added. 6 days after my first visit, I find myself driving from Anaheim back to Philippe's and my goodness it was worth the trip. A hundred and one years and counting. They've GOT to be good. Again, I'll say that it's not the best but for what I paid, but it was definitely great. Two beef sandwiches double-dipped - Soft bread, flavourful meat. Add Swiss on both. Bowl of chili (no beans) - Salty but good. Bowl of beef stew - Hearty and great balance of vegetables and beef. Side of macaroni salad - Too much relish. Didn't finish. Lemonade (no ice) - Refreshing. Total: $21.00! I liked it the first time I came six days ago but this time was somethin' else! Too bad it's so damn far from my house! *kicks rocks* If I'm ever in the area, Philippe's is definitely going to be one of my few "go-to" places in this part of town.

The seminar I was attending downtown ended early and after taking the Redline to Union Station I decided to check out "The Original". I've heard about the place for decades--lots of folks rave about it--but I've never had the opportunity to venture in. Of course, I got a French dipped sandwich, along with potato salad and an iced tea. It was OK. Just OK. Sometimes, being "the original" doesn't mean you're the best. Seriously, how would that first baseball team organized by Abner Doubleday fare against, say...the current Yankees line-up? Pro'ly not too well, I think. Sure, they'd KILL the Angels, but I digress... What I'm trying to say is that I've had better French dips in my day...made better French dips. Now that I've been to Phillipe's, I can scratch it off my "do before I die" list and likely never go back.

There are tons of places in LA that serve a French Dip, but none quite like Philippes. 蔜his LA landmark has been dishing out their famous sandwich for nearly a hundred years and it is no surprise hundreds if not thousands of Angelinos pass though their doors each day. The sandwiches are simple, flavorfull, and time-tested. 蔄ll of their meats are slow roasted to perfection and hand carved to order just like they were 50 years ago. 蔔ot much has changed here at Philippes, from the old school tables and chairs to the booths in the back and that's just the way I like it. For all you first timers, I'd recommend getting the lamb with swiss and a side of potato salad. 蔕nce you have your sandwich make your way to the back and find a place to set up shop. 蔔ow, pay attention because this is the important part. You're gonna want to be careful because this is pretty tricky. Step 1: Take the off your sandwich Step 2: throw on a little potato salad and spread evenly throughout. 蔛tep 3: coat the top bun with Philippes homemade hot mustard. 蔛tep 4: place top back onto sandwich. 蔛tep 5: EAT As you can see I'm a huge fan and if I'm in the downtown are you better believe that I'm making a stop at Philippes. 蔐aker games, forget about it. 蔇odger game, Lock! 蔋eck, sometimes I hit this place up before getting dim sum on the weekends. 蔣es its crowded and parking can sometimes suck but this place hurts so good you'll want to get two.

What can you say about Philippe's that hasn't been said already? 蔜he place is a Los Angeles landmark. 蔄 restaurant/diner of yesteryear that continues to draw people from all walks of life who come in to enjoy the French dips, pies, and the ambiance. �Unlike most places in downtown, the parking at Philippe's is terrific. 蔅ehind the restaurant, there is a small lot that fits about 10-15 cars. 蔍n addition, they also have a lot across the street that fits about 20-30 cars, and they usually have a parking lot attendant present. 蔄t lunch time it gets pretty packed, but each of the times I've gone, I've been able to find a spot. One of the things that gives Philippe's its ambiance is its 1920's interior and exterior. 蔕nce you walk in, you'll notice the long silver counter-top where the carvers take your order. 蔍f you're new, you'll appreciate the menus that are posted above the counter tops. 蔠hen you order you can do no wrong. 蔈verything that I've ordered in the past has been delicious and fulfilling. 蔜he French rolls are soft, flavorful, and they have just the right amount of au jus or "beef broth." 蔍f you want, ask the carver to double dip the roll....for extra beef flavor. 蔜he beef, lamb, turkey all have their distinct tastes and textures...but all the meats are well prepared and quite tasty. 蔋owever, I definitely recommend the beef dip and the lamb dip. Although they have sides such as macaroni salad, cole saw, and potato salad...I usually have enough with just 2 sandwiches and dessert. If you like homemade pies, this is your place. 蔄pple, cheery, blueberry, lemon meringue, cheesecake...they're all prepared in house and every day. 蔍've never had the lemon meringue, but if its like the rest of the pies...you'll love it. 蔜o drink, you can choose fountain drinks that come in a can or good coffee. 蔅ut I recommend 2 glasses of lemonade....definitely hits the spot. �Once you've ordered, find yourself a spot at any of the tables inside the restaurant. 蔠hile you're eating you may notice a few things about Philippe's that you'll never see anywhere else. 蔉or 蕇tarters, near the main entrance you'll see a small convenience/candy stand where you can buy candy, batteries, and other small things (Phillippe's memorabilia as well). 蔕n the walls, you'll notice old Los Angeles picture's depicting famous people, your everyday professions, landmarks, and memorable events. 蔐ooking at those photos is like taking a tour of LA through Philippe's windows. The carvers themselves are great, sweet women. 蔜hey take your order as fast as possible, their polite, very sweet, and exceptional professional given the number of people they have to serve. �Couple of final points, if you want water, don't order water at the counter top...around the corner across from the main entrance there's an old school water fountain surrounded by numerous glasses where you can serve yourself (although the water has a very strong tap flavor). 蔍f there's no spaces available at the long wooden tables or back room booths, there's a set of secret dining rooms...one in the back near the rear entrance and the other one is on the second floor (you take the steps near the rear entrance). �If you think the lunch and dinner selections are great, go there for breakfast and you'll be amazed by all the things you can order, among them: pancakes, eggs, sausage, baked apples, and much more. Philippe's is an amazing restaurant that adds so much flavor and history to this ever changing city of ours. 蔖hilippe's is a true landmark where you can enjoy a French Dip (after all they invented it, regardless of what Cole's claims), take in the ambiance, and appreciate living history within the walls of its 1920's building.

I've been wanting to go to Phillipe's for such a long time. So me and wifey decided to take a detour on the way back to the Bay Area and stop at the Original Phillipe's in Chinatown. To our surprise, it wasn't much of a detour as we stayed on the 101 to go back home. My first impression of Phillpe's was, 'THIS PLACE IS HUGE!' There is so much seating it seems impossible for it to be packed. But as we were leaving the area started getting populated quickly, so I guess there is justification for all that room. I ordered the ham and cheese and wifey ordered a turkey and cheese, both of them single dipped. I heard that their pies are fresh and yummy so I went ahead and ordered me some blueberry pie as well. My first bite into the ham cheese astounded me. 蔄fter seeing how much meat they pile on (That's what she said), I figured it would be too overwhelming. However, 蔍 was wrong. The ham was so fresh, no gameyness to it and was complemented by the American cheese very well. The turkey was also good, but I'm not sure about getting that as a french-dipped sandwich. Turkey was also fresh which was a plus in my book. The Au Jus was pretty good. Salty and meaty (that's what she said) flavor, I felt the Single-Dip option wasn't enough. I know for sure I will get mine Double-Dipped to get that extra juicyness. Be forewarned, the mustard is uber-hot. It's probably the hottest mustard I've ever had. It tops those real hot Chinese mustards you get at a Chinese restaurant too. Yes, it does go well with the sandwich, but only a dabble here and a dabble there. 蔍 suggest you try a little on your tongue (that's what she said) and gauge the hotness of it. The blueberry pie was fantastic. Again quality food comes from fresh ingredients. I enjoyed the crust the most, it was soft and tender but full of flavor and complemented the blueberries very well. Phillipe's lives up to the hype. It's simplicity is what makes it so good. 蔆an't wait to get my meat double-dipped next time (that's what she said).

I'm gonna give you catatonic readers a break here, and simply mention that this place is my pregame snack bar for games at Dodger Stadium. I wouldn't go here if it wasn't better than the recently improved selection of food outlets at the ballpark. 蔖hilippe's has great sandwiches, great sides and usually good service, depending on whether they give you all the extras you request, especially hot mustard, to go. Think about bringing a bag of Frito's Scoops to the park, and buy a bowl of Philippe's chili with cheese (and onions, if you dare), and you can forget about Dodger nachos. Then continue up Ord, take a right at Hill and a left on College over the 110 freeway, then right at Chavez Ravine to reach your stadium entrance of choice. Philippe's location just might make waiting in their line a time-neutral equation vs. taking the freeway to your parking-lot entrance and lining up to buy overpriced stadium food. You can thank me next summer (2010).

Philippe's The Original defines the term "institution". 蔜he original French dip sandwich served in Los Angeles for over 100 years. 蔜he place is a trip, makes the torture of driving to LA worth the agony of bumper to bumper for a legendary experience. �Lamb sliced off the leg dip sandwich, wow- be sure to ask for double dip to make it wet and tasty. 蔖ork also excellent. 蔛ide of pickled beets, pickled hard cooked egg or pigs feet, maybe potato salad and you have one hell of a meal. 蔖rice is right, dips for $5.35 (lamb $6.50 and worth every penny) Hard to describe how good this place is, but why bother, if you've been you know, if not you have to experience it for yourself. 蔠ent for lunch on Saturday, the line was out the door but moving at a good clip. 蔜he gene pool was impressive, the atmosphere pure Raymond Chandler. 蔖hilippe's the Original, that's food NOIR baby.

You've heard it once, you'll hear it again. Yes, it's a great L.A. institution. I never knew about this place until I finally decided to go to more L.A. restaurants. The place reminds me of a huge cafeteria where you get in line and order on the front counters are the ladies hustle and bustle to get your order together. I ordered mine "double-dipped" and it was quite good, but the it didn't blow my mind or taste buds out of the water. The hot mustard is good, but once again, nothing too original. It was basically really hot McDonald's hot mustard. I didn't get any sides, but for what it is, it's OK. A bit on the pricey side since it's just a regular sandwich to me, but good none the less. **It looks like a destination Dodger fans go to before games**

Let me preface this by saying, I am my father's daughter. I am a total daddy's girl. I can barely get through a day without e-mailing, calling, or sending a carrier pidgeon his way. And he LOVES this place. Apparently, darling Baba has been going here for 25 years, and has brought me in since I was a wee one to enjoy the magic. And now, on to the good stuff. So first off, the lines are insane, they're always insane, but they don't move too slugishly, so don't trip. Second off, there's sawdust or something on the floor to prevent slipping. I love it. Third off, the food. (It's last on the list because you know I like to make you wait to get to the good stuff) Out of the five different meats available (Turkey, Pork, Lamb, Beef, and 蔋am), Baba goes with Pork, and I go with Beef (pictured) I got mine dipped and with bleu cheese, which was amazing. 蔜he texture of the meat is phenomenal, you can tell they know what they're doing there. 蔄nd, I'm such a sucker for carbs and the bread manages to maintain its' shape, despite being doused in the amazing au jus sauce. �My sandwich, despite appearing small, packed a punch and was very heavy and really filling. 蔠hat really did me in was that hot mustard. Oh man, see, Im a girl that puts schiracha sauce on practically everything, and this mustard really sets it over the top. yum. So basically, I can find nothing at fault with Philippe's, and you thereby have my attention and approval.

Journey to the center of.............Los Angeles Snuggled in walking distance from Chinatown, Olvera St., Union Station and Twin Towers (thought I'd point that out), Phillppe's gives you a good jumping off point to do a little exploring of a part of downtown after you eat. �Like other yelpers pointed out, there's a bit of wait (about 20-25 mins. for me), but you get to talk to people in line and watch the goings about of this almost 100 year old joint. 蔅ut, it's worth the wait. 蔒y Pork Double French Dipped Sandwich was crazy good, the cole slaw was great and the whole experience...worth the journey.

So I'm not a huge fan of french dip sandwiches but it was pretty cool to come to the place where supposedly the french dip sandwich originated in LA. anywayz, this is not your typical restaurant. I would characterize more as a deli because the way you order is that there are a bunch of lines in front of the counter where deli meat is held. once u reach the front of the line, you order your food and they basically make it right in front of you. (at least the sandwiches). the prices are very reasonable here. the french dip sandwiches (pork, beef, chicken) are only $5.75. they also have lemonade for only 75 cents and iced tea for 65 cents. along with that, they have a pretty good mac and potato salad there. i hear the chil is really good too. when i came yesterday, i got the beef french dip sandwich, macaroni salad, and the lemonade. the beef french dip sandwich is pretty good. the beef was just a lil dry for my taste but i the french dip helps make it moist. the mac salad is pretty tasty with small bits of mac. overall, i wouldnt really give this place 4.5 stars but for the purpose of this rating, i shall give it 5 stars.

The bf and I were both Adam Richmond's fan. 蔒an vs Food! Man vs Food! 蔛o naturally, we picked this joint as our first stop of our LA munch-a-thon 2009. We arrived at the joint 8-ish. 蔛till full of people. 蔐ines everywhere. 蔠e smelled the french dip goodness from the outside. 蔠e quickly picked a line and wait to order our french dip sammich. We ordered 2 stella draft beer, a lamb french dip, a beef french dip, and a big bowl of chilli. Sandwich taste: 5 stars. 蔐ove the spicy mustard. 蔠e needed that little kick after a long journey from NorCal. 蔐amb has great lamb taste, very moist. 蔅eef was off the hook. 蔄dam was right, order of tastiness: 蔅eef and then lamb. Sandwich size: 蔋ow come ours look a lot smaller than on Man v Food? 蔄dam got hook up big time. 蔠e're just small potatos, no love. Meat weren't as adbundant as it was on the show. 蔮oohoo Chili: not the best i've had. Overall: 蔲our stars still since it was the best french dip i ever had. 蔍 just wish they're as big as the one on the show.... :)

I don't know what to say. 蔈verybody already said it. �The french dip was excellent and if you put their spicy mustard (fantastic!). 蔉or dessert I had blueberry pie. I'm not much for blueberry pie but the guy that took our order told me that this was one of their best dessert, and he was right. �The place was really dirty but what do you expect when this business was around since 1908. 蔍 would say that this place is a historical site and definitely a place to check out. �I would recommend going early, because this place was packed with people. 蔍 got their around 11:30 am on a Sunday and I didn't have much difficulty in finding a place to sit. 蔕ne thing to remember this place only takes CASH.

I don't know..... So I came here the other nite for some late nite grub, and must say although tasty, not the best! I got the beef sandwich, a pickle, scoop of potato salad, and a large Fattire for $16.00. Decent price. But I wasn't overly full. Good thing since we went to the taco stand on 7th/Mateo after! Sandwich was good, but could've used a double dipping and double meat. Potato salad and pickle were standard, slightly better than others. Beer was nice n cold. Will I come back? Maybe...

Besides the long wait (which, is totally worth it) where you can get to know your dining companions in the space of thirty or so minutes, I didn't know what to expect of Phillipe's. I mean, I've heard of the place for years but I've never had a beef sandwich dip EVER. Then the boyfriend suggested we go on a picnic to a nearby park with some Phillipe's in tow. Thirty minutes later, we left with two beefs, one lamb -- all double dipped, and a kosher pickle. Soooooo GOOOOOOD. I tell you, nothing beats laying down on a blanket in a quiet park, munching on delicious sandwich and some grade-A cold spear pickles. Mmmmmmm just thinking about it makes my belly ache for more!!

Philippe's is an LA staple so when I was in the neighborhood working, I stopped by for lunch. 蔍 like getting either the Beef or Lamb sandwich with coleslaw and an ice tea. 蔜he food here is always good, even if it was shutdown due to a roach infestation about 6 months ago. Please know that there are multiple lines for this place, not just one so just go politely find the shortest. =)

1. Ignore the straw-mess on the floor. It doesn't reflect on the food quality. 2. Bread is a bit hard. Try double-dipping it when ordering. 3. The lamb is must try. 4. I personally didn't care for the sides. 5. Oh, the water tap is on the side. Don't be embarrassed to ask how to operate the thing-a-ma-jig.

My grandfather had never been here before ever in his life, and he has been a resident of Los Angeles for a VERY LONG TIME. So my brother and I were going to hang out with our grandfather, and Philippe's was going to be our dinner stop after visiting the Ralphs Fresh Fare (on 9th & Flower). A CASH ONLY establishment, so if you think they accept credit card, get cash prior to your visit or be prepared to fork out a fee for using the ATM machine at the back of the restaurant. The menu is kept simple, and the prices are just right for your choice of 蔭ny "beef juice" dipped sandwiches (beef, pork, turkey, ham, lamb) along with add-ons like cheese for a small fee and sides like potato salad, macaroni salad or coleslaw. I had tried the beef before so I went along with the pork. OMFG!!! Is it me, or does the pork MELT in your mouth like butter? It can almost feel gross, but IT TASTES SO GOOD! That was pretty bomb, and I would get it again. My grandfather really enjoyed it. He opted for a lightly dipped sandwich since Philippe's cannot really not dip it in beef juice.

How many times have I waited in line for you, Philippe? The Original? Glowering, starving, at the others in line, even the children (and I actually like children)? Because when my blood sugar is low, I'm the pissiest bitch in L.A. First I'm manic, blathering about oolong tea varieties and Pop Art or whatever crosses my manic mind, and then I am furious. I writhe. Today I woke up so freaking hungry for your double-dipped beef with Swiss with extra hot mustard, that I donned a hat and big glasses and lipstick so that no one could see me glower. I was stomping on the ground, sawdust was making little clouds around my kitten heels. The tremendously long line moved SLOWLY and it was only 10 a.m. The sweet ladies with their hairnets and their aprons sighed, patiently, accustomed. The man ahead of me, a regular, apparently, ordered breakfast and lunch, and he wanted his bacon extra crispy. Since we have to wait for the guy ahead of us' food, I had to wait for his extra damned crispy bacon. I quietly stomped in my big glasses, hat, kitten heels, and lipstick. But it was so worth it. Philippe, The Original, you are always so very worth it.

This morning my boyfriend suggested a ride to LA to go to Philippe's. I'm really glad I said yes. �First, take all of the negative reviews and delete them from Yelp; I guess you can't please all of the people all of the time, but haters are just that. Second, time in line. We rolled in at 12:15 on a Friday afternoon expecting to be standing in line for at least 15+ minutes based on reviews. We were in line maybe 5 minutes, the girl took maybe a little over 5 minutes to prepare our food and take our money. 蔠e were eating in approx. 15 min after walking through the door. At lunch time on a Friday! Third: Food. We ordered one Lamb Dip Wet, one Beef Dip Wet w/pepper jack cheese, Side of Slaw, Side of Potato Salad, Side of Pickles, a bowl of Chili and a pickled egg. I'm glad we ordered wet, because I still could have used more sauce, but the flavor was great. The proportion of meat to sandwich was just right for us, maybe a little too small for big eaters. The Hot Mustard on the table was THE BEST I'VE EVER HAD, and I am a huge fan of good hot mustard! (We did buy a bottle on the way out). The sandwiches themselves were good, I wouldn't say that they are the very best around, but definitely worth the money. 蔜he coleslaw and potato salad were some of the best I've ever eaten. Neither were slathered in mayo, and the taters were cooked perfectly. I'm not a fan of potato salad, but I would make it and eat it all of the time if I could make it like they do. The chili was okay, not the best; it had good texture and flavor, but there was a lingering aftertaste that I just couldn't put my finger on, and it wasn't the best taste to leave with. 蔜he egg was okay, I'll admit I got it just to try it. It was pickled in beat juice so the egg comes out reddish purple; looks strange but flavorful. My boyfriend got a beer and me an iced tea. Cost, just over $30 with the tip. Maybe a bit pricey for lunch, but we did order a lot of food. I felt it was worth what we paid. Atmosphere: Not all that. For as long as they've been around, and the culture of the place I thought there would be a lot more pictures on the walls of 100+ years of memories. The place is plenty big enough to seat a lot of people, and we didn't see anyone having to wait for a place to sit down. �Overall I would say it was worth the ride up on the Harley for a good lunch. We were in and out of there in under an hour, again at lunch time on a Friday. We paid a fair price for the amount of food we ordered; the service was friendly and fast; and the quality of the food was just under great. �Service: A Price: B+ Food: B+ Time in & out: A++++ Atmosphere: C Side note: If you like your bread moist order Wet. If you like your bread soggy, you might need to ask if they'll do a double Wet. I'm glad we went for wet, but I was expecting a lot more jus. �Yes I would recommend Philippe's

Philippe's is an LA landmark and should be part of any Dodger fan's pre or post game experience. 蔜he reputation is stellar and the name Philippe's has become synonymous with French Dip. 蔄lso, perhaps no other LA eatery exemplifies the city and its diversity like Philippe's. Last night Philippe's was the final leg of a 4 part Yelp road trip and it completed the journey magnificently. 蔍'd like to offer some added appreciation to the staff for allowing the 20-30 of us who remained after closing to stick around until the Dodger game was over.

As a former private chef who has been in the business for over 11 years I wasn't the least bit concerned when I saw on the news the this place was shut down by the health department. I am sure every single place in Los Angeles could be shit down for the very same thing. I am sure the inspector simply had a bad day and wanted to be a complete butt plug. This place is awesome, always has been always will be. The food is great and the service is cool as well. The prices are the best. I love the everything about this place. Being someone who is a native of Southern California who loves the old school places like Phillippe and the awesome history they offer served with awesome food is just sweet. Anyone who says they will not go because of ONE cockroach, might as well never eat out in any place in any town anywhere. Long live the KING!!!!! Phillippe ROCKS!!!!!

One wouldn't fault a duck for not being a swan, now would they??? Philippe's is definitely a duck... no elegance, no discernable sex appeal. Sure, Houston's has a great French Dip - along with a parking hassle, pushy service staff that live for "upselling" and not too much soul. Philppe's has plenty of soul, it's funky, quirky and lives definitely by its' own unspoken set of rules. Oh, yeah, Houston's, etc, are full table service places, which are fine for that sort of thing. Philippe's is classic order at the counter, take your food and sit dow and chow stuff. It is an "everybody" sort of place, and I see suits sitting down right next to janitors enjoying a good, quick lunch for well under 10 bucks. Sometimes I think I might be the only person who has had anything OTHER than the French Dip here - the omelettes are quite good, and the breakfasts in general rock. I tend to go around 9 am, and there are no lines... or after 2 for lunch. With all the Water Grill, Noe, Lawry's type places in LA, it is good to know that there is still an old fashioned, down to earth, unpretentious place like this around.

Has it really been over 100 years? Yikes! Historic, simple and delicious. I used to get the beef dip until i found out about the LAMB... oh man! They pull out a huge chunk of lamb and chop it up right there for you. I like sitting way in the back where they have the history of LA's "red cars" and gives everyone a chance to see the maps of LA's public transport before the auto companies took over. Did you know you used to be able to get from santa monica to newport beach in 25 minutes? Makes one wonder why none of the trains in LA hit the beach anymore... This place is a MUST if you live in or are visiting the los angeles area. Just watch out for how much mustard you use..it is HOT!

This was the day. 蔜he long-awaited first visit for hubby to Philippe's. 蔋e was as giddy as a school girl. 蔠e were up early for our road trip. 蔠e dropped the furkids off at the kennel and off we went. I started to get a sinking feeling in my (hungry) tummy as we made our way towards LA (from South OC). 蔜raffic on the 5 Freeway was terrible (it always is...why do we never learn to just take the long way - 405and 100). As we got closer, I was downright depressed, afraid of the peak lunch crowd we'll likely encounter when we FINALLY arrive at Philippe's. To make things worse, their parking lot was almost full which indicated that OMG I may not be able to get my beef dip because we need to make a party in Santa Barbara at 2:30pm. 蔅ut no...we couldn't let that happen. 蔠e didn't drive all the way to downtown LA in 112 degree weather just to be turned away by the lines at Philippe's. 蔛o I soldiered on. Predictably, it was a zoo. 蔅ut from past experiences, I walked past the lines closest to the exits and made my way to the center of the room. 蔍 looked over at hubby whose childlike exuberance had melted away into a deep "deer in headlights" state. 蔍 issued marching orders - "SAVE US A SEAT AND I'LL GO GET OUR FOOD. 蔠HAT DO YOU WANT?!" 蔋e whispered his request in a soft voice and slumped off to wait....and wait...and wait... But then came me....knight-ess in shining armor?? 蔜he line I got in was in the middle, two people in front of us. 蔅ut there was another obscured line right next to us, behind a pole serving only 1 person. �Next person in line?" �MEMEMEMEMEME!" 蔭nd I slipped right in to place my order. 蔔o one else noticed the line, even after me. HA. In 10 minutes flat, I had our two orders of double-dip beef sandwiches (one with jack, one with blue cheese), bowl of chili (yummy with no beans!), potato salad (awesome), coleslaw (crunchy and refreshing), mac salad (eh), picked egg (tangy and savory) and a pickle (my favorite). 蔄lso tried a coconut cake which turned out to be a tad on the sweet side but great cake. Hubby basically hoovered his beef dip and everything else. 蔕nly gripe was I had to go back twice because the lady forgot my pickled egg and pickle. 蔕h wel

Most of what I know about Philippe's comes from an episode of Huell Howser. Plus one star for that. It's open super early; I once had to come here at 6:00 am for a field trip, and it was already staffed and ready to deal with a couple hundred mean, cranky eleventh graders. Plus one for that. Free coffee refills, as ever, are a huge plus one. One on side, it's across the street from Union Station; on the other, it's across from Olvera Street. Naturally, it's within walking distance of both Chinatown and Little Tokyo, and just a five minute subway trip from The Garment District. Huge props on all those fronts. Plus one star. They have excellent pie, but there can never be enough pie. If you order a pie--and you want to, everyone wants to order pie--be smart and just get a whole one to go. Otherwise, you'll hate yourself the next morning. I know. I feel pie remorse on a weekly basis. Plus one for that, minus half a star because now I want pie and know I can't have it :( Four and a half stars, plus half a star because I like to look at if not eat the pickled eggs, for a total of five stars.

I will admit that I can get carried away with the hype sometimes. 蔍f something sounds like I'll enjoy it, if I can visualize enjoying it, and if the reality is anywhere close to meeting my expectations, i'll usually like it. Such was the case with my first visit to Philippe's. 蔍 was enamored with the double-dipped french beef, the homemade pickles (I LOVE homemade pickles) and I was even intrigued with the pickled eggs. 蔔eedless to say I enjoyed that visit. Subsequent visits, have altered that initial perception and brought my judgement back down to the real. 蔍t's still pretty good, but there is so much that's mediocre about the place, the food and the experience. I almost had the same experience visiting Clifton's cafeteria downtown. 蔜he first time was really neat, after that it is just low-grade food in a chintzy place in a bad area. Heck, if I'm in the area, I'll gladly go again, especially if someone I'm with wants to try it for the first time. 蔍t's not terrible. �However, It's not something I have craved (after the first time was the exception), nor is it a place that stands out in that area as a worthy destination from Pasadena (even though I'm 10 minutes away).

Hmm, given that there are 198 reviews do I really want to bother writing 蔭 long drawn out one that no one but me will read? Psssht, of course! I don't get over to downtown much, unless I am going to the Central Library to return books that are months overdue...but after an ill fated jaunt over to Santee Alley the boy and I came here to erase the scars of that trip by engorging in what he promised me were heavenly beef dips. I was skeptical. Soggy bread sandwich? Mmmmmno. But I am an open minded individual, and anything that involves mustard and pickles simply cannot be all that bad. Well it wasn't. It was fucking good. The meat could not have been less fatty or more tender, the bread maintained a crispyish crust, and the mustard not only complemented the sandwich but cleansed my sinuses as well. The pickles were yummy too. We got three to go and they made for a tasty dinner, hours later, when we were still stuffed from the beefy goodness of lunch. I am knocking a star though because the women's restroom was gross. There was even a shoe, a single shoe, left on the sink. Very appetizing, really made me want to rush back to eat my food...

Perfect Meeting Place! I wanted to meet my family as well as friends for my birthday dinner so I told them to meet me at Philippe's! It worked out perfectly as everyone knows where it is and the community seating lends itself to large groups arriving at different times. It's also nice that it's a Los Angeles tradition, which means the food is good otherwise they wouldn't have been around for over one hundred years! Whether you enjoy the beef or pork or turkey or lamb, be sure to pair it with your choice of macaroni or potato salad or the best coleslaw you've ever had! The chili is very good as well, and they offer soup and salad as well. Beer and wine are available and the pies and cakes for desert are of traditional old school pedigree. Experience old school L A at its quintessential best! A great stop before or after L A sports games like Dodgers and Lakers/Clippers. Chinatown nearby for before or after shopping/sightseeing.

Well surprise, surprise. Over 200 reviews and I have not touched Phillippe's. Right there a stone's throw from Chinatown, Olvera Street and Union Station lies the L.A. landmark that is Phillippe's. So the basic for me is simple: 2 beef French Dip's, custard pudding and a coke. I think that's how I've been ordering since I was a child and that's how I'm going to order when I die. But there's more on the menu like tuna melts, soups and their awesome assortments of pies. And I always take home a little of their hot mustard with me. Another thing about this place is that you can hold parties on the upper floor. For my niece's Baptism at the nearby Cathedral, we had the reception at Phillippe's on the second floor. For about two hours, we rented about three rooms and we got catered plenty of French Dips, crisps and soft drinks. So keep that in mind if you plan on having any small functions in the city. Now there's nothing special about the upper section so don't think about planning a wedding reception up there, but a wedding reception catered by Phillippe's is a viable and most delicious option. You know I've got an idea. Wedding at the cathedral, reception at the Standard and catering by Phillippe's. And in a wedding cake with Pinkberry fro-yo and you got my dream wedding. I think everyone should try out Phillippe's. Yes, the lines can get crazy but there are plenty of lines. And parking can be awful but know there is another lot across the street and if that get crowded try the pay lots adjacent to the Chinatown shops.

My friends and I were going to visit the California African American Museum to see the Tuskegee Airmen exhitbit, and stopped at Phillipe's for lunch. 蔍've been a few times before, but wanted to give a review; Phillipe's is a great place to go for a sandwich, to watch some baseball, and chit chat with your friends. 蔜he lines are usually long, but they do move pretty quickly; I had a tuna sandwich with potato salad, and my friends all had french dips. Two of them had the chocolate cake, and said it was incredible. We also met the nicest little lady named Connie, �6 years old, 蕀akes her own beaded necklaces, does her own beadwork on her dresses, and was a sharp little pistol of a woman. She came up to us to ask about the baseball score (the Angels were playing Minnesota) and ended up talking to us for a good fifteen minutes, while her son waited over in the corner. 蔛he knew players' names, and what their strengths were, she told us she was born in Los Angeles, but lives in Arcadia, and used to go to five dances a week, but cut it down to two. 蔜hen she pulled out a bunch of beautiful beaded necklaces that she had made, and gave them to us! One of her quotable lines: �There are never enough men at those dances!" When I grow up, I want to be just like Connie - 蔳o to Phillipe's, for the food, and the clientele; it was a most enjoyable time.

I am not a fan of Philippe's. After hearing years of hype, i was so excited to finally try it out. 蔜he place is retro adorable and the ladies behind the counter all reminded me of Lucy Ricardo. 蔜he pickled beets and eggs were good, but this is supposed to be a place you come for sandwiches. 蔄nd let's just say, I wouldnt come back here for their french dips. We tried the beef and the pork. 蔆ouldn't really taste the difference between the two. 蔜hat's not a good thing. 蔄lso, the jus is not provided on the side. 蔙ather, the ladies behind the counter dip it for you, so by the time you find your table to sit and start eating, the bread is a soggy sloppy mess. 蔒y friend ate two sandwiches and said he was so unsatisfied. 蔍 completely sympathize with him. 蔜he beef stew tasted like Dinty Moore from the high school cafeteria. I think I actually prefer Cole's french dip sandwiches which have more meat and jus on the side so you can dip into the jus-y goodness just before it gets shoved into your mouth.

This place feels somewhat like a west coast version of Katz Deli from New York. I ate here a few years back and it was really nothing to brag about so today I was in the neighborhood again and decided to try it again. I had the beef dip and the apple pie a la mode for my son. The dip was okay, I think if they slice the meat thinner it would be better. That being said they're doing something right or they wouldn't be around this long.

It's a tradition to stuff myself with a french dip beef sandwich with swiss, a bowl of chili, a slice of pecan pie, and lemonade from Philippe's before heading out to Chavez Ravine for a good ol' American ball game. The place is always filled with fellow BLUE fans stuffing up their stomachs with some meat & bread before stuffing their stomachs with peanuts and beer! I think something went VERY wrong today. First off, when I got there at 6:30pm (expecting the line to be out the door since there was a game today) - there were parking spots galore and the wait was less than 10 minutes! Weird. I should've known something was a-muck. Anyway, I got the turkey dip sans cheese (trying to eat healthier meals so I can continue my dessert rampage) and an iced tea as opposed to my regular beef dip, side of chili, pecan pie, and lemonade. My husband got the pork dip with a side of chili (without beans) and an iced tea. The turkey was ok - but I wished I got my regular. What I wished even more was that I didn't squirt the mustard on my sandwich while talking and not paying attention. I put a tad too much - and I swear I burned a hole straight through my nostrils. Yowzers! Don't get me wrong, the mustard is awesome - but only when used sparingly. That SH! is HOT. The feeling I had is similar to the feeling you get when you accidentally eat too much wasabi. SOB! Anyway - fast forward to my deductions. Because I did not follow my Dodger/Philippe's tradition per my usual, the Dodgers took a MAD beating. SOB! I take the blame for it Dodgers. My apologies. We'll get em tomorrow, boys!

Philippe's Is the Cr弇e de la cr弇e of French dip sandwiches! Wow, I am really impressed with their sandwich. It was super Delicious, that I wish I would have ordered another. I got the Beef Dip with a side of pickles. Yummm! I originally was not going to order the beef dip, I was going to order the turkey because I am not much of a beef fan I hate too much meaty flavor, but since this is the Taj Mahal of all beef dips and, this is what they are famous for I decided, why the hell not? I must say Philippe's is pretty damn amazing. Not too beefy, but tasty, not overly soggy but drenched in the perfect amount of dip. The only thing that sucks Is the seating, you have to walk up stairs(because the downstairs is packed) with your big ass trays of food, not very pleasant if your a clumsy person like me. Philippe's stole my heart away, It is now going to be hard for me to consume other sandwiches without trying to compare them to Philippe's!

Typical LA nonsense....just becasue people tell you it is good doesn't mean that it is. Here are the facts: 1. Gross 2. Unremarkable 3. Inconveniently located NEWSFLASH: A good sandwich requres good bread. 蔣OU ARE NOT GOING TO FIND DECENT BREAD ANYWHERE IN LOS ANGELES!!!! Add this to the long list of crappy restaurants in LA that are supposed to be good but way, way overhyped by a bunch of failed midwestern transplants: Father's Office Bay Cities Deli Pinks Hot Dog Alejo's in Marina Del Rey Its all average and so are you for going to all of these places and thinking you're cool. �Go F yourself, LA.

This is my first experience and introduction to the french dipped sandwich. For $6.00 you get one sandwich with your choice of meat, either roast beeft, pork, lamb, or turkey, I think. I tried the roast beef, which was a bit dry for me. As for the pork, it was more tender but only because it has more fat. The meat itself, is quite flavorless, hence the dipping? The other item I ordered was the chili with the BEANS!! Yum, I love beans. The chili was $2.45 for a small order, and does not come with any cheese. It was very good, I liked it a lot. The chili had good amount of meat, and beans. T One other thing, I spread some of my chili on my french dip, and it made it taste a whole lot better! Okay... let's go to the pricing. For $6 you only get a sandwich, no pickles no nothing. 蔍 don't like this idea... all sandwiches should come with pickles! Want Cheese? gotta pay for that too! Also, I don't like how they do not wear gloves when they are preparing your food! I am aware that they don't ever touch the cash, but still you got to wear some gloves! Overall, I don't think I will come back. The first experience is enough for me.

The raves Philippe gets, are at best sentimental, rather than rooted in fact. Guess these hacks brought 蕋he "au jus" sandwiches to America, or even invented them outright. What an abomination. In France nobody would consider serving a limp bread roll that had been 蕋ossed (acidentally, as the Philippe' lore goes - and hat would make sense) into roast drippings to humans. Ever! But in this chow hall with the charm of a Greyhound Bus terminal it is the main attraction. There is a lot to be said for the fine "gele" you can make from cold pan juices (the "jus"). Put them on a nice crunchy baguette, with some sliced cold meat(s) and you have a rather fine sandwich. However, the Philippe style of soaking a roll that had the consistency of mitigated noodles to begin with, in thin salty roast juice and slapping some barely edible meat from unspeakable parts of various critters on it, is simply cruelty on a plate and looks, feels and teastes - to borrow a phrase from the fabulous Dan Neil - "like throwing up in reverse". (Chapeau!)

102 YEARS OF MEATY DRIPPY GOODNESS Look, let's be honest. 蔜he sandwiches are good , but not life changing... and that's ok. 蔜he place has been around for over a century; people weren't worried about being foodies 102 years ago, they were worried about simply getting food and at a good value. 蔄nd in that respect, Phillippe's rocks. With the lines out the door, they could easily charge $8 a sandwich and get away with it, but the don't. 蔍nstead you pay $5 bucks and change and get a cup of coffee for 9 cents. 蔍t's truly a restaurant for the people which is evident by the mix of white collar, blue collar, young, and old alike.

Simply the best at what they do. It's a delicious and timeless part of the L.A. culture. I think of it as almost a right of passage to get yourself a Phillipe's french dip sandwich when you come through. Inexpensive and addicting I buy two sometimes just in case. Never ask for the dip on the side!!!! You need them drenched and juicy. I get mine 蔰ouble-dipped with roast beef and a side of potato salad. ;] hint hint. Don't be intimidated by the huge lines, you won't wait long. �They're open till late like 10pm so perfect for an evening snack before the club.

Don't believe the hype. This place is good for the novelty only. It is decorated with vintage train peraphenelia, and has long tables to eat at with sawdust on the ground. Often the line is long (especially before games) and the lines are unorganized. The french dips are good, but the fact that they don't give you your own au jus ruins it. They dip it for you so you'd better scurry to find a place to sit so you can eat it before it gets soggy. You can also request a double dip and if you get that, you have to hurry twice as fast as it will get soggy twice as fast. The sides they offer taste like grocery store deli stuff and the lemonade, while cheap at 75 cents, is extremely watered down. It is cash only and the person ringing you up makes your sandwich, so pick someone that looks fast and clean. Don't worry, they don't touch the cash, they take it back to a "pit boss" type person who rings it up, so there can be a back log at times. CASH ONLY!

I suppose at 900 reviews, another one doesn't really matter, but I wanted to write my "twin" review to the Cole's one I just made. Remember the Sweet Valley High twins, Jessica and Elizabeth Wakefield? One of the twins was more serious-minded, down to earth, practical, and had less glamorous friends. The other was more polished with better clothes, make-up, and ran around with richer and hotter friends. Phillipe's is Elizabeth Wakefield. While Cole's is polished, better decorated, has a bar and servers in fedoras, Phillipe's is a bit more authentic and spunky. The iced tea is under 99� They have ginormous pickles in glowing green mason jars. Pigs feet bob as their next door neighbors. Middle aged women wear 50's waitress uniforms, deftly taking money, writing tickets, and grabbing your food in under a few minutes at the sprawling lunch counter (never mind that you just waited 30-45 minutes to get to the front- bring good company to chat whilst you wait). There are large cream pies of every variety in their refrigerated cases for you to order a healthy slab from. Dude, this place is all about the authenticity and realness. You aren't going to spot some trendy young thing from a Fox network primetime show here, but you are probably going to share a booth with a hearty trucker from Minneapolis who's sweating into his coleslaw (delicious!) and beef double french dip. I love that! Sit me next to the real people that work hard for that dollar please. Save the hobnobbin' for the jerk offs. As far as the food goes...I'm sorry. I like the french dip's at Cole's better. I hate that there is no au jus (is it REALLY a french dip without the meat drippings? i contest) to make my bread soggy, and the meat has always seemed a bit dry. Maybe i should try it with cheese, as some people do (but then it ceases to be authentic, my opinion) to get a little fat in there. Coleslaw is awesome with the meat and bread. I'm a fan of the pickle too, but find it superfluous if you order the coleslaw. Iced tea is awesome, basic, good brewed stuff like I had at grandma's. Worth it for the experience, food is just okay.

I just don't get the hype.

So i have been there several times with him and i don't understand why people are wetting their pants over this place. The place is a mad house when you walk in, the price is expensive, the sandwiches are small and the staff is rude as hell....so remind me what the appeal is again?

I've been here twice now. �Every place I review, I give a second chance to.) The second time, a Saturday, my party waited forty chaotic minutes 蔮ehind a troupe of Girl Scouts who were literally texting each other, and saying things to each other like, "Hey did you just get my text?" 蔠hen we finally got our food, the only place where we could eat it was what looked like a walk-in closet/where they pile up all the used dishes, dominated from a corner by a homeless lady. Was it worth the wait? No French dipped sandwich (even the lamb) is worth this kind of wait. In fact, anything above a standard deli counter wait is ridiculous for a French dipped sandwich. Is the French dipped sandwich at Philippe's especially good? No. 蔅ecause they dip the sandwiches themselves, you don't even have control over how much fat you're getting. �I wanted more fat.) The much-lauded hot mustard is (1) not that hot (if wasabi is 5, then their mustard is, like, 2.7), and (2) just mustard after all. 蔜he rest of it is just Lay's potato chips, Corona or Bud Lite, some crappy looking pies. How about the ambiance? you may ask. It's kind of like an old school jailhouse/insane asylum cafeteria, except with a counter and some neon light displays (and, oh yeah, a T-shirt stand). What about your fellow inmates? Obsessive viewers of the Food Network from all across these United States. 蔒ake your own inferences from there. Let me ask you something, would you wait 40 minutes for Lay's potato chips and a Bud Lite? 蔕f course not! 蔠ell there isn't much reason to think you should wait 40 minutes at Philippe's either. 蔜ake the forty minutes and make this shit yourself.

As part deux of my "OG Tastes of LA" series, I offer the self-proclaimed home of the french dip sandwich, Philippe the Original. 蔠hile the restaurant has existed in some form since 1908, it has called its current location home since the 1950s or so. My personal fave is the lamb dip (double dipped, as others here have advised) with blue cheese and a few dabs of the hot mustard. 蔇o heed the warnings posted in other reviews about this stuff. 蔍t is liquid pain and you can easily blast a hole out your face where your nose once was. 蔜hat's what it feels like when you OD on the stuff at least. I remember going to Philippe for the first time as a little boy with my Dad and his parents and being quite surprised (shocked really) at the elderly gent sitting next to me going to town on a pickled pigs foot. 蔍 don't recommend those to anyone, but Philippe does still surprise in other ways even today. 蔜hey offer a fine menu of wines by the glass, and I myself have enjoyed both a viognier and a sangiovese from Napa's Miner Vineyards. I have never had a problem with parking, and Olvera Street and Chinatown are a short walk away if for some mystifying reason you are still hungry!

Never mistake "Original" to mean "Best" This place is a Los Angeles landmark and the place the French Dip was created so for that I wanted to love this place but sadly I didn't. The lines are long and I wish I had brought my iPod to help kill the 20 minutes waiting in line but I won't knock them for having long lines. So here is what I got and my thoughts: Beef Dip - $5.75 Pickle - $1.05 Potato Salad - $1.15 Macaroni Salad - $1.15 Chocolate Cream Pie - $3.35 Lemonade - $0.75 The sandwich seemed small and it lacked the something special that I had hoped for. 蔔ot only because I am arrogant but it's just the truth...I make way better sandwiches. The pickle was great but I didn't go there for the pickle. Never made a pickle so they got me here. The potato salad was ok but nothing special but I have never met a potato salad I didn't like. I can make better potato salad, easily. The macaroni salad was nothing special. I wouldn't bother making macaroni salad because its not my thing. The cream pie was okay but nothing special. I will leave this one alone! The lemonade was actually excellent but again I didn't go for that, what I came for was this famous French Dip...and honestly one of the only things about this place has going for it is nostalgia. What I did discover was the awesomely spicy mustard and I am a big fan of mustards. The mustard gives you a Wasabi type burn, which I love. It reminded me of a Chinese mustard and I intend on having that in my fridge at home but I will just order it online for $4.25. I could of gone in and ordered a pickle, lemonade and a jar of mustard and walked out with all I wanted for $6.05! Bottom line here is the food is decent but not all its made out to be and if you have never been and find yourself around there I would say go "go ahead so you can check it off your bucket list and tell your friends that you have been there." For me, I don't see myself returning and I will leave this piece of nostalgia where nostalgia belongs...in my past.

Oh my god the lines are always long enough to mess with your head. I doesn't help that there can be as many as 10 queues open at once. It's worse than rush hour at Safeway! I don't care! I will always stand in line for a double dip beef with a side of slaw and a slice of pecan pie. Can you beat the real lemonade or fresh brewed ice tea for 50 cents a glass? 蔖lease don't get me started on what their hot mustard has done to my sinuses the last few years. It is a real horseradish rush! This place is OLD but does not feel tired. 蔜his is a great place to enjoy a french dip while people watching. I lifted the following story from their web site.....don't know if it is true but after eating two today in one sitting I don't really care. I feel like I'm home again. ****************************** The Birth of the "French Dip": Established in 1908 by French immigrant named Philippe Mathieu. 蔖hilippe the Original began as a delicatessen and sandwich shop. In 1918, Philippe was preparing a sandwich for a policeman and accidentally dropped the sliced french roll into the drippings of a roasting pan. The policeman liked the sandwich and came back the next day with some friends to order the sandwich "dipped" in the meat pan. From that day forward, a new sandwich was born--the "French Dip," so called because of Philippe's French heritage, the french roll on which the sandwich was made, or because the policeman's name was Officer French. ***************************** Nifty!

Went for the first time today and it was pretty delicious! Went with the Beef French Dip (double dipped) w/ Bleu Cheese, potato salad, and lemonade. 蔍'd definitely suggest putting cheese on your sandwich cause otherwise the beef alone, although tender and great, doesn't deliver THAT much flavor. Potato salad was meh. Lemonade, tiny but good. Having read such good things about the hot mustard I decided to take a yelp-induced leap of faith and slather it on my first bite... YUUUUUCK! Made me cry and cleared up my nose. IMHO - Nasty. They have packets of regular mustard at the counter. The chili w/ beans was pretty greasy and good too. The purple egg? Mostly serves as a novelty item. For dessert, a baked apple which wasn't too sweet and really good to share. Sat upstairs to avoid the crowd. Bus boy(man) saw the camera on our table and offered to take our picture. Nice gesture. Also, they have a YELP sticker on their door! Said Yelp approved or something like that. That's awesome!

I'll admit that I probably started liking this place just because my dad loves it so much. 蔅ut I've gone many times without him, and I've really enjoyed myself and my experience even without his stories about this place, and he has a lot of them. First things first, I'm vegetarian, so the French dip doesn't do anything for me, literally. 蔜he non-meat sandwiches are just OK, but this place is about much more than the food. 蔕rdering and deciding where to sit are really important to your experience. 蔍f you do either incorrectly, you could ruin your whole lunch. Some tips: 蔇ecide what you want before you stand in line. 蔅e nice to the person taking your order. 蔠hen you get your food, you have a big decision to make. 蔋ow communal do you want your lunch to be? 蔍f you want the full-on communal experience, sit at one of the long tables near where you order. 蔍f you want a communal experience that feels like something from a weird '40s movie, go upstairs to one of the little rooms. 蔍f one is available, choose an empty one. 蔛omeone might come in and sit down next to you. 蔋e might not. 蔍f you want a more-or-less private experience, check out the booths around the corner from where you order.

I don't get the hype for this restaurant at all. The order line needs major efficiency fix. They should learn from In n Out -- order, pay, get out of the way. Pick up when your number's called. In here, you waste half an hour waiting in line, then give your order to a lady who then will take your money, go to the cashier AND make your food. Gross. Employee who handles money should NEVER handle food, don't they know that? The sandwiches are just okay, the French Dip is soggy, just as it's supposed to be, but its sogginess is unappealing to the least. The potato salad is mediocre at best.

I'm picking Philippe's out of my teeth right now (sorry if that's gross) having just been there for lunch, so I thought this would be an appropriate time to write a review for the place. Not that it really needs another review, but I'll put in my two cents. I just happened to be downtown for a business training and at the end of the class a person yelled out 'Best sandwiches in LA are across the street, if anyone wants to join me!' How could I pass up that opportunity? This place has been around for ONE HUNDRED YEARS. That is still tripping me out. And debatably, this place invented the french dip sandwich. Since this was my first time (*blush*) I decided to go with the basic beef french dip. I added jack cheese, and a side of macaroni salad and lemonade for good measure. The french dip.... was.... AMAZING. I am not usually a french dip kinda girl, but this was a great sandwich! Only they don't give you the sauce to dip it, they dip it for you. So it's super messy and super yum. The macaroni salad was a bit heavy on the pickle (which was kind of strange to me anyways), but it was OK. I would probably try something different for a side next time. The lemonade was fresh squeezed and refreshing, just as it should be, and was a shocking 70 cents! This is a cool place. The lines are long, but it is worth the wait - next time you're down in the town walk on over and check it out.

There are many LA institutions that I simply will not visit b/c they aren't worth it for various reasons. 蔉or example, the Apple Pan 蔵s way overpriced and not that good anyway. 蔖ink's is very good but nothing justifies the inevitable and obscenely long wait. 蔈l Coyote is passable but also not worth the massive crowd and wait. But Philippe, on the other hand, is the real deal. 蔜hey have a huge menu but it's all beside the point, b/c the real all-star there is the french dip. 蔍 go simple, usually have the beef w/cheese, double dipped, and it's never steered me wrong. 蔄lways juicy, flavorful, and filling (tried the lamb once and was underwhelmed). 蔖otato and macaroni salads are solid accompaniments, and I've never found their desserts anything other than excellent. 蔍 love the mustard/horseradish mix they have on the tables--hot as hell but tasty and distinctive. Plus, the venue is a one of a kind experience. 蔜he location is weird (but not unsafe, and I can say this having been there alone, late at night)--on the edge of Chinatown and the banks of the LA River. 蔜he look is real retro, as in not updated since the early 20th century (as opposed to designed to make it look like that). 蔜he waitstaff actually carve and serve your sandwich as you wait, which is kind of a cool twist. 蔜he interior is a trip with the long benches that you may share with a hipster, businessman, or any other random character. 蔕verall, the atmosphere is a great experience (though I've never been there at peak times hence never had to wait--that always makes it seem more pleasant). Some institutions are BS, others are worth it. 蔖hillipe is worth it. 蔠hether local or tourist, you should take a pilgrimage here.

I'm sorry. 蔍 feel stupid writing this for such a revered place. 蔜he fact of the matter is, I've had a better French dip at a Denny's. 蔍'd take the Quizno's Steakhouse Dip sandwich over this any day of the week. 蔕h yeah, and the tri-tip dip from Claim Jumper. 蔍 give Philippe two stars instead of one because, well, it was edible. 蔍'd never head back to this place, period. 蔜here's nothing wrong with it. 蔜here's also nothing right with it. �I got a basic French dip sandwich and one of those purple eggs. 蔋ad to go eat upstairs in some room that looked like I would imagine in some run-down restaurant in Nicaragua. �You know what? 蔍 like making my own sandwich soggy, not receiving it completely soggy from the get go. 蔊ive me my au jus and my sandwich, and let me do it myself!

I do not get the hoopla. The roast beef sandwich was bland and soggy and that's what they're known for! I don't care about all that landmark/historic stuff. When I go to a restaurant the food better be good. I don't have to set foot in Felipe's anymore.

I decided to check out Philippe's to continue my Man v. Food restaurant tour. 蔠alking in I definitely got an old-fashioned cafeteria feel. 蔜he place was packed! 蔜he wait was about 30 minutes just to be able to order. 蔋owever, once we ordered, service was pretty quick. �I was skeptical about the sandwiches since I'm not much of a french dip fan, but I ordered a single dip beef sandwich and it was fantastic. 蔒y husband got the lamb sandwich, which tasted a little fattier than the beef but still great. 蔠e asked for some au jus on the side, but they said no, so if you like your french dip nice and juicy make sure to order a "double dip" or "wet" sandwich. 蔈verything tasted fresh from the .75 cent lemonade to the $1.29 macaroni salad (which was just okay.) 蔒y husband's insisting I write about the .90 cent pickled egg - it tasted like...a pickled egg and beets. 蔄 nice novelty, but I don't think I'd break the bank on it. My conclusion? 蔊o for the sandwiches and the cheap coffee or lemonade. 蔕rder more than you think you'll need because the sandwiches are deceivingly small and we were all still hungry when we left. 蔊ood food, good quality, but small portions. 蔍'll probably visit again!

This place is amazing. It's nostalgic. The food is great! Most 3 Star reviews are for service. 蔄greed it doesn't have the best service in the world, but you don't go to a sandwich shop for service. 蔍 can't think of a single sandwich place that has amazing service. 蔣ou wait in a line, order, and take your food to your table. This restaurant hasn't survived numerous recessions on luck. 蔜he food is great and is actually pretty fairly priced. 蔍t's not just the food, It's the experience. 蔍 can remember my father bringing me here when I was a few years old and I will take my kids here some day. �If you are heading to a Dodger game, you should strongly consider stopping by before the game (if an evening game) or stop by after the game (an afternoon game). 蔍t can get kind of crowded (again not a coincidence), but the lines move fairly quickly. Ask for the "Original French Dip" and ask for it "Double Dipped". 蔊et a pickle, maybe some macaroni salad, and a glass of their fresh lemonade. 蔍t's all good. Hope you enjoy it!

The only negative thing I really have to say is- I was a little disappointed that there wasn't au jus sauce served on the side. I LOVE to dip my own French dip. I ordered the Turkey dip which was awesome. The meat was delicious and tender. I ordered potato salad on the side which was also delicious. I don't usually like sweet style potato salad but this was delightfully tasty not-too-sweet. A friend of mine ordered the Beef Dip which definitely would have been better with the au jus on the side. She also had the macaroni salad on the side which I didn't care too much for. FRENCH ONION soup is delicious! I wouldn't say it was the BEST but definitely worth trying at least once. �Ordering was quick. Ambiance was chill. A lot of history in this place to look at while your eating- always a plus :) Oh....and I had the banana creme pie. Pretty good. Not too much too brag on this one.

Yeah, this place didn't live up to the hype for me. I got the turkey dip and the potato salad with an iced tea. The turkey dip was just ok. Turkey was really dry. I don't think there was enough au jus in it. The potato salad was good. I think it had too much sweet relish in it. As for the service, the wait on a Sunday morning wasn't long and I got my food promptly. I was able to find a seat quickly too. Honestly, the ambiance kind of grossed me out. I'm not into the sawdust on the floor look. Call me uptight or pretentious but whenever I see that, it makes me feel like the place isn't clean...even though it was.

What is it you trendy-wanna-be-food-critics say? Om nom nom? Well this place is OM MON NOMN NOMNN NOMNNOMMNMNKNNMNKHKJHGJF! So you know a place is good when the boyprend's parents seem to go in to some sort of diabetic coma every time they mention this place. And the nerve of the boy kid for never taking me! So selfish! This was my first time experiencing the wonder that is Philippe. I never really understood what all of the fuss was about. I mean, a french dip is a french dip. How could you go wrong? But at Philippe they seemed to have created a recipe that has been proven since the early 1900's. And the lines at this place are a testament to that. This place is cafeteria style so you order what you want at the counter and they make it there in front of you. I must have counted at least 8 registers and every one of them had a line to the back of the building. Amazing! And you want to know their secret? Well first off, they've been selling 9 cent cup-o-joes since the birth of this place. And not only do they make a sammich that is to DIE, but they literally dip the ENTIRE thing in au jus! This is caloric MURDER! And this is why you deserve the 4 stars I give you Philippe. Not only did you satisfy my beef and lamb cravings, but the service is great, menu prices are spot on, and the whole vibe of this place is so vintage LA. I know. That's a gross thing to say right? But please. Do yourself a favor on your next trip to the land of the angels and get a French Dip from Philippe. And order the pickles. And the cole slaw. And the tea. And the potato salad. And the pizza. JK. They don't have pizza.

Damn, this is the 300th review for Philippe's! 蔍t's definitely an LA institution. When looking for a place to eat downtown that was low-key, and unpretentious Philippe is the place for you to go. 蔍'm not going to have much to add to the other reviews here, but, I will mention the fact that we liked the food so much that we ate there for dinner for the French-dipped sandwich then ate there for breakfast the next day. �The sandwich was great, and it was SO good. 蔎ust watch out for the spicy mustard, because they aren't messing around when they say it's SPICY, so use it in moderation. �The breakfast menu is ... eh, does its job. 蔍 had the French toast, with eggs, and sausage and it was something like $6.95, plus a whole $0.10 for a cup of coffee. �CASH ONLY ... Seating is cafeteria-style, and you get to sit wherever you find a spot. 蔛o, either be comfortable with a random stranger sharing a table with you, or make a beeline for the booths for some privacy.

I grew up on Philippe's. My grandparents lived in San Gabriel and we would hop on the Del Mar carpool on-ramp and take it all the way to Alameda street. It was like our own secret road. We would take up one of the upstairs rooms all to ourselves. Uncles and cousins would gorge on a couple of the beef sandwiches. Some double dipped. Me and my twin would always get one of the purple eggs. (I told you I was a weirdo) I love them! I LOVES ME SOME PURPLE HUEVOS!!!!! Oh and a pickle. (what the?) They have great beef stew. I have tried all the meat sandwiches. My favorite are as follow starting with my #1. 1. Pork 2. Lamb 3. Beef 4. Turkey Which are all great in there own ways. The service is always fast and accurate. The best time to come though is during the week around 11 am or after 2. Weekends are madness but great for people watching.

So my boyfriend finally took me and my friend here, after long talks of wanting to go... I think he hyped it up too much that when I took the first bite into my roast beef french dipped sandwich, I just said "Hmm....it's ok..." The roast beef was pretty tasty, but I wish that they had added a little bit more meat to it. There seriously wasn't anything in the sandwich but the meat, sauce and bread. Therefore, it is an absolute necessity to eat the sandwich with their famous hot mustard (which tasted very much wasabi-like) and a nice sliced, dill pickle. If I had eaten the sandwich by itself, I would have given Philippes 3 stars, so basically the sides saved it. My boyfriend ordered the ham sandwich, which was too salty for me, and the pork sandwich, which was just mediocre. My boyfriend and I shared the potato salad, which was very good (I have to admit), since it had just enough parsley, relish, and chopped potato bites in it. We also had their cheap, yummy lemonade with our sandwiches, and an apple pie slice for dessert! YUM YUM! It just added that finishing touch to the whole experience. Quite honestly, there was nothing too special about this place. I don't know if I would have waited 20 more min in line just to eat here. People were not kidding when they said there would be a line. *Beware: There is a lady that works here that would forget tons of things in people's orders. There were 3 people ahead of us that all had something forgotten, whether it was pickles, sodas, and even sandwiches! She even forgot our pickles too! My goodness! Just make sure to double check your order!

Good. But not crazy good. The hype totally ruined Philippe's for me! Boo... I was expecting a crazy juicy sandwich, loaded with meat. Instead, it was on the lighter side. About 6 inches long, it packs about as much meat as your standard Subway cold cut sandwich. Definitely not a "deal" for $5.15. The experience is more fun if you mix it up with a bunch of other stuff. They have beef stew, chili, kosher pickles, pickled eggs, custard, pies, fruit salad, chips, cole slaw, potato salad, macaroni salad, and more! I've never seen the lunch hour madness, because I don't work near here. But in the evenings, it's more calm and seats are readily available. Interestingly, this famous L.A. institution attracts senior citizens on weekday nights. Anyway, it's a must-visit for foodie tourists and Angelenos. I'm going to try their breakfast next! Tips: Free parking in the back. Walking distance from Union Station.

Dear Mr. Philippe, You got something good going on there. 蔉irst of all, way to invent a sandwich and not name it after you. 蔜hat's the signature of an honest man. 蔛econdly, thanks for giving me the option of a single dip or double dip. 蔔ice touch. I came to your establishment on Saturday and enjoyed cream of broccoli soup, a hearty single dipped beef sandwich and a side of macaroni salad. 蔈ach dish far exceeded my expectations. 蔍 was especially happy that I tasted no vinegar in the macaroni salad. �Also, I was so pleased with the free parking. 蔔ot sure if that was your choice - but please send on those props to whomever deserves them. �Here are some suggestions to make this 5-star joint of yours even more special: 1. I wouldn't mind paying more than 55 cents for lemonade if I could have more of it. 2. I would like to eat one of everything on your menu. 蔍 am currently looking into purchasing a stomach pump that can run off my car's cigarette lighter. 蔒aybe you can do some research into this as well. 3. That stuff you pickle the eggs in - anyway it can be a warmer shade of purple? 蔔o? Ok. Thanks again for the lovely experience. Take care, Lisa

I understand the desire to give Philippe's 4 or 5 stars. Really, I do. After all, Los Angeles is a city with contempt for so many of its older buildings and institutions. As a city, we like to take the wrecking ball to old places, or board them up and let them become dilapidated with age and neglect. Fortunately, that hasn't happened to Philippe's. But that doesn't mean this restaurant serves particularly noteworthy food, either. I suspect that Philippe's fan base (which is admittedly large in number) is divided among two main camps: 1) Those driven by a powerful sense of nostalgia, and; 2) Those who don't cook at home very often. Here's the straight dope.......Go down to Costco, buy yourself a nice beef brisket from the fresh meat counter, slow cook it on your stovetop in beef stock, sliced onions, and your preferred seasonings until it's so tender it falls apart. Get some high-quality French sandwich rolls, pile the sliced brisket as high as you like and use the au jus for dipping. Use some horseradish sauce or brown mustard for a zip, if you like. There, you've just outdone anything you can get at Philippe's. And you won't have to wait in line for 40 minutes for your modest sandwich, either. I'm glad Phillipe's has survived over these many decades, but it's merely okay, not great.

Phillppe the original restaurant, and yes they keep it original! First you walk inside you look around and you will be like wow is this the 1900's? even check out their menu it's plain and simplified, it looks old's skool to me but hey that's why this place is historical. We ordered all beef sandwiches, all double dipped! Now trying out the sandwich, all i can say it's "alright" it's not as tasty but it's plain, not even the hot mustard would help, it's only gonna burn you up and not bring out the taste. Speaking of the hot mustard, i thought it was cool to try cuz i like hot spicy stuff, and this mustard is kick-ass! My brother had put alot on his beef sandwich and did'nt realize that it would blow you away, and he had that look of a major sinus attack on his face and not even adam from man vs food can withstand it! Lol There is one of those water fountains where you can fill your drinking glass with there, when i first encountered it, i was like ok how to you make this work? i was turning knobs, looking around this sink, which was to me old style 1900's and i was looking around if anyone noticed me how stupid i was trying to figure this out, but finally on a simple push of the knob the drinking water came pouring lol Overall cool joint, 蔵f your looking for something out of the ordinary in(sandwiches) 蕐ou wont find it here, but the cool thing it's a historical spot and you will find something to appreciate this place.

Let's be realistic about Philippe's, if I recommend it to ten people, nine are going to love it and there will be one "weirdo" who doesn't. 蔜he menu is big, but what really matters are the sandwiches. 蔜hey invented the french dip here, so stick with the specialty. 蔍 prefer the beef, but the turkey is mighty tasty. 蔜he chili is good and you can get a bud or a fat tire with your meal. 蔒ake sure you add some of the mustard they put on the tables, but be careful and don't put too much, it'll burn your nose hairs!!! The line is always long, but goes fast. 蔖arking isn't the best, but not bad. 蔣ou pay at the counter and it'll probably come out to about 12 bucks a person. �For that one "weirdo" that doesn't love his or her sandwich, just frown and feel sorry for them that god didn't give them taste buds.

Philippe is is one of those special places that Los Angelenos can be proud of. 蔍t is a place parents introduce their children to. 蔍t is the yardstick to which all other 'french dipped sandwiches' should be held to. If it's your first time, be prepared for a chaotic set of lines in front of servers and a menu that's difficult to read. 蔅ut don't let that deter you. 蔕rder a double-dipped (it can get soggy, but that's the whole point!) roast beef or lamb sandwich (or both! they are that good). 蔔o cheese or anything else to bother the sandwich (although blue cheese crumbles on the roast beef is acceptable). 蔊et a lemonade, maybe some dessert or potato salad. 蔇on't forget to tip your sandwich lady. Grab a seat at one of the communal tables and slap a bit of Philippe's house mustard on your sandwich. 蔈njoy.

So here's my two cents.. Had the french dipped sandwich not been good, I probably could've easily gone with 1 - 2 stars. Really. OK, so my grandma used to come here in the 60's and 70's and raved about it.. And its regarded as a landmark here in LA.. But you would think with a rep like that, they could be just a bit nicer? Nope. 蔒aybe I just wasn't a regular, or Evangelina was having a bad day. However, after seeing Cheddar's review, I am glad I wasn't the only one. 蔖robably not the last, either.

When that au jus hits the back of your tonsils, you'll see Jesus. I swear it! And you may see the face of the Virgin Mary on your roast beef. Look closely. She may speak to you.

Great place to eat (despite the fact that this location is up for dispute for whether or not it is "The Original" for the roast beef dip.)

This place brings you back to the 70s-80s. It's not one of those places that tries to create that ambience.... this place just is... seems like it was never reconstructed ever since it opened. When I started walking around the restaurant for seats though.. the ambience reminds me of prison... it's dim, minimal decor, just long tables and benches lined up. Lines were forming when we went in on a Sunday morning at around 10:30ish. I ordered the pork and beef sandwiches, chili, potato salad, and ice tea. All for $20. I added swiss to the pork, and jack cheese to beef, double dipped= scrumptious. The size of the sandwich was just right... won't give you a food coma. The cheese is not melted in the sandwich.. but it still worked. The bread wasn't super soggy by the end. The horseradish mustard is a MUST. (It's not as strong as actual wasabi). Potato salad was really good. You can definitely taste the relish. Now the chili.... if only it wasn't so salty... it would have been THE perfect chili. sigh. cheese is a must, don't forget. comes in cup or bowl size. Despite the ambience, I will be back for sure.

Food rating: 3/5 Authenticity/ambiance: 4.5/5 I do go to a restaurant for pure taste. *ASK for your Sandwich to be DOUBLE DIPPED* Location/Parking: Tiny parking lot. Located near the back of Chinatown which use to be a French neighborhood once upon a time. Seating/Wait: Where do the lines start? EVERYWHERE! There are many many lines. Just find the shortest line of people and wait patiently. You order when you get to the front and get your food before the next person is served. Service: I love that all the servers (all the ladies were cashiers and the men were in the kitchen) are elderly. Thanks for giving them jobs. They have cute outfits but I think they all looked extremely tired since the place is so busy. Food: Between my group, we ordered so many items to try *ASK for your Sandwich to be DOUBLE DIPPED* We had all of ours double dipped -Mustard/yellow horseradish - available at the tables. Don't mistaken this for regular mustard. -Lamb with Swiss cheese: additional cost for cheese but I figured it'll help since lamb tends to be more gamey and dry. I actually liked the lamb 2nd best of the three. The downfall is that the lamb meat was sliced in larger pieces. Made chewing harder. -Beef sandwich: A tad on the dry side even with the double dipping. -Pork sandwich: Best one. Pork is fattier than the other 2 meat making the sandwich juicier. -New England clam chowder: Diluted. Bland. Had to add my own salt. -Pink pickled eggs: interesting. Tastes just as you'd imagine. I added this to my sandwich. -Potato Salad: Nothing memorable. -Wide beer and alcohol selection: glad to have a variety of alcohol to wash everything down. Prices are not so bad. -65 cent ice tea and 75 cent lemonade: It's cheap if you like mediocre ice tea and average tasting lemonade; If not, they free water - self-serve. D巆or/ Ambience: Very cute place. Lots of historical pictures. Proclaimed a train museum? I like the souvenir candy stand they have. There are plenty of tables of you go deeper in the restaurant. Do walk around the place to explore. They have plenty of phone booths but the lines don't work. It's a cute tourist stop. The only thing I did not like from the ambience is the what was on the ground. Looked like animal bedding was spread around the floor. Dogs: No outdoor seating.

History history history. I think I'm drawn to Philippe because of the history of the place and just how simple the food here is. �Of course, well known for the French Dip sandwiches, I always get it double dipped so extra au jus is soaked up. 蔊rab some coleslaw, potato salad, or a bag of chip, and it is just one of the simplest meal you can have but so good. Grab a bowl of their bean-less chili and tell me that it isn't one of the best you've had and that you wish you can have a hot dog or fries to eat this with. 蔊rab a lemonade to wash everydown! 蔍s 79 cents now but still well worth it. �Cash only!

You might have heard that Philippe's is the originator of the beef dip sandwich and that might be true. What's also true is that this discovery was a long time ago and since then, others have undoubtedly improved on this meat and bread combo; but still, a meal here is like a field trip back in time. Philippe's sort of just is; a slice of old Los Angeles with ladies wearing uniforms and sawdust on the floor; that is, if you ignore the L.A. City workers in orange vests and the Chinatown geriatric crowd expertly nursing that cup of 9-cent coffee (no refills for you cheapskates!). Still, if you imagine hard enough, you can envision an eatery that served food back when men wore hats and the Red Cars ruled the streets. They also didn't take credit cards back then, a practice that continues to this day. CASH ONLY!!! Philippe's can be crowded at meal times, and insanely so, especially before any ballgame, and ESPECIALLY before Dodger's baseball, which is the WORST time to come here, IMO. Just know that the lines of hungry diners between the rows of front tables have no rhyme or reason; one line might be helped by two windows, maybe one; fall asleep at the wheel and you may never get helped. My advice: find the shortest line, go to it, and keep your eyes peeled (the station at the far left is for express items only!!). There are beef, ham, turkey, pork, and lamb sammy's, as well as cheese; the roll probably dipped (you can order varying degrees of "wetness") in the same au jus regardless of the meat. I've only had the beef and lamb. The beef dip is good. You've probably had better someplace else, but the taste of a Philippe's beef dip sandwich is unmistakable, and to me, sort of a welcome departure from the fanch-schmancy stuff. I like 'em even better with bleu cheese, although the jack's not to shabby either. Honestly, when I think of the sandwiches, I start salivating. Go figure. The lamb, unlike the roast beef; presliced and wrapped in butcher paper, is carved from a hunk of animal shank before being laid out onto the bread; good, if you're into that kind of thing. Actually, it IS good. The sandwiches are kind of on the small side for me. I could eat two of them easily, with maybe room for an ice cream scooper-ful of their potato or macaroni salad, but also remember that Philippe's has their hot yellow mustard, potent enough to give wasabi, as well as your sinuses, a run for its money. Their coleslaw is old school and basic. Daily soups and chili round out the menu as well as a hearty beef stew. Just remember that the stews and soups can sell out if you go too late, which has happened to me A LOT!! Some of the more unique things here are the pickled eggs (they're in these big jars displayed on the countertop and unnaturally purple) and some baked apple thing, the fruit cored but the skin left intact. I've haven't mustered up the courage to try either, but I've had the tapioca pudding. One thing I discovered was how stupidly IN-expensive breakfast can be!! For example, oatmeal goes for $1.80; biscuits, $1.60 (you get three), and if you add that 9-cent cup of coffee, that's less than five dollars! (again, no coffee refills) Sometimes I like to get a side of their thick, white, country gravy for my biscuits. They have the regular french toast, pancake, eggs, ham, bacon sausage stuff here, too, in different combinations, but none of them are over ten dollars and they give you quite a bit of food. The 70-cent glasses of lemonade are okay, a little watered down for me. Drinking water is available from a serve-yourself dispenser with glasses that I've seen in mess hall scenes in M*A*S*H* (the Altman film) This food is the polar opposite of the stuff whipped up by newer, cutting edge restaurants with their celebrity chefs. I'm pretty sure it's stayed the same for the past century, and although fedora's may be out of style, 蔵n its own way Philippe's somehow stays in vogue.

I'm not really into eating just meat and bread because I love vegetables with my meals. But I'll always make an exception for their French dip sandwich. It's so good. They also have great traditional pies to finish your meal.

Great Fench Dip Sandwiches! When I first heard about this place I was like, Cool lets check it out! THe Benches and ladies in old time uniforms threw me off. Wasn't sure what to make of it. The atmosphere is definitely cafeteria like. But the french dip double dipped is just great. Have been there a few times in the last year. Always serves up a mean sandwich. I am sure the line will be fierce for their October 6th 10 cent sandwich, but I may still go just to commemorate 100 years of great food.

Reputed to be the origin of the French Dipped Sandwich, this throwback is just plain good. Counter service only, and it gets crowded during mealtimes. Seating is mostly community tables, and there's sawdust on the floor. Cool little model train museum in the back, and a great view of the jails. If I remember right, open 6am-10pm. Cash only, but there's an ATM on site. My typical order: - Pork sandwich, double-dipped. - Bowl of chili straight (no beans) with cheese and onions. - One iced tea, one lemonade - Sometimes a cup of coffee just because it's 10c. And of course, be sure to try some of the sinus-clearing mustard. Breakfast is also underrated. 蔍f I'm up in the area in the mornings, I'll stop by for a corned beef hash and eggs breakfast. 蔣um! Worth dealing with the lines and going out of your way for.

Everytime I come here, I walk away a little disappointed. Yet still, there will be those days that I crave that french dip. After a relaxing foot massage at Spahhhbulous (highly recommended!), the bf and I walked over the Philippes and braved the notoriously slow lines. Of course, I chose the SLOWEST line as usual. After seriously a 45 min wait, my bf and I were so hungry that we ordered way too much food. Two double-dipped sandwiches (beef for him and turkey of course for me with provolone cheese) with a side of peppers, pickles, marinated beets, potato salad, lemonade, and a glass of pinot noir. To the best of my memory, the pickles used to come with the sandwich but I guess they charge now? Not only were the sandwiches already too big for each of us but we had to chow down on the rest of our sides. For the first time, I left feeling so satisfied... maybe that's why I keep coming back. Things you MUST order (in addition to their sandwiches of course!): + Marinated Beets + Peppers/Pickles + Potato Salad So so so so good. Even though I only wanna give them 3 stars (personally, I think it's a little overrated), my bf insists on 3.5 and we'll throw in an additional .5 because of it's reputation as an LA institution and our insistence on coming back regardless of our love/hate relationship. Oh and for those who like Coles better because you can dip the sandwich yourself... ask for the au jous on the side, they'll happily oblige.

This place is AMAZING! When I first walked through its doors, I was overwhelmed by how many people were standing in line and if not for the great reviews I've read on Yelp about this place, I would have turned around and gtfo. �The line actually goes pretty fast, except if you had bad luck like me and got into the slowest line ever ... when my boyfriend and I were the next in line, 5 people in the next line passed us. 蔅ut even that was well worth the wait. Got my beef sandwich double-dipped. 蔠ill try wet next time. 蔜he freakin' best sandwich I have ever tasted. 蔜heir $.75 lemonade and iced tea was also really good. 蔍t definitely lives up to its hype and I can't believe I was born and raised in So Cal but took me 21 years to try Phillippe.

YUM! I had no idea what to expect. I can't say I have ever had a french dipped sandwich. I thought it was really good. Certainly not gourmet food, but if you thought that after seeing the prices and the sawdust, then thats your problem. I didn't have the dry meat problem noted quite a lot. The beef was tender and moist and the dippy stuff just added to it. The coleslaw was excellent and the potato salad was pretty good. I will definitely make this a staple when I am in the area! And 65 cents for lemonade.. that made me happy, so I got 2. Edit: 蔍f you are expecting a side of Au Jus for your sandwich, don't even bother asking. 蔄pparently they go through so much stock already that it would be a 24 hour job to give everyone an extra side.

This is by far the BEST beef french dip I've ever had. The bread is soft and moist, not hard and dry. I love that they double dip the bread. The spicy horseradish mustard that they have is to die for. It will induce watery eyes and runny noses, but that's perfectly alright with me. I bought 2 jars to take home. Lots of desserts to choose from. I had the pecan pie. Loved it!!! I must give props to Adam from Man vs. Food for recommending this place on his show. It was definitely not a disappointment and I will be back again for more. :)

This is as good as it gets. Located a decent walk from my workplace I'd always heard about it but never been there. I finally tried it recently and it was ALL THAT AND MORE! The lines were all crazy. They literally stretched 5-10 deep at every cashier and there were like 8 lines! I was told that it wasn't even considered crowded and that on most days the line stretches to the wall. Walking in I really didn't know what to expect. I'm always disappointed by frech dip sandwiches. They always look really good but never live up to they hype. Well this one did, and more. I ordered the pork sandwich with macaroni salad and lemonade. Apparently this place is known for many things and the lemonade is one of them. The macaroni salad was just right! I would gladly eat here day after day if there lines weren't so long. Don't worry though, it goes really quickly. The sandwich, drink and macaroni salad runs around $7.00. Definitely worth a try.

Awesomeness. My favorite place for french dip sandwiches. Although it's located in chinatown, I've never had any issues with parking. It's a bit of a trek just for some sandwiches, but i think it's well worth it if you're in the mood. Very cute decor, sawdusty floors and brick walls with an old train station feel.

Beef Sandwich is ok, I prefer a Baguette from Bolsa. I ate lunch here with my coworkers yesterday. I have always heard of Philippe's in that it was the best place to get a french dip or beef sandwich. The sandwich was ok. Here are the details. 1. Beef Sandwich was ok. The slice of cheese was extra. The cost was about five bucks. 2. Potato Salad was ok. 3. lemon aid???? I should have just stuck to the can of Pepsi I had with me in my pocket. 4. Tapioca Pudding was Yummy!!! Four Stars on the Tapioca Pudding! 5. Ambiance, especially upstairs, was pretty bad. 6. The lady who took the money also grabbed a wet pickle with her hand.. disgusting! We were going to eat at homeboy cafe, but decided to come here for a try. The food is good, but I am spoiled and use to more taste. I would prefer a baguette with meat and veggies from bolsa with an ice coffee any old day. I doubt I will come back. I just felt the food was bland. We came here around noon and the wait was long. The upstairs was pretty depressing. My coworkers said it reminded them of what they thought jail would be like. I would have given my total experience a two star, but the tapioca pudding saved the day! I am lucky I ordered it. Last note, the paper plate and tray seemed dirty or old. I do not know which. I think this place is ideal for east coast or Midwestern folks..not for those inclined to prefer spicy or variety of flavors. I did not even try to check out the bathroom. I kinda just wanted to get out of there. Plenty of parking, price of lunch (about 8 bucks) and the tapioca pudding made this place A-OK.

I live down the street from here, so I figured it was about time to try their famous french dip. I really appreciated their free parking! I'm not a french dip fan because I don't really like soggy bread. So I ordered a beef french dip with swiss cheese with it half dipped (they only dip one side of the bread). It was good, but not as good as everyone says it is. 蔜he beef was fresh, but I wish it was a little less dry. 蔍 also tried their macaroni salad, which was pretty good. A tad relish-y, but still good. Their fresh squeezed lemonade was good. I ended the meal with a slice of apple pie, which was a little disappointing. I was expecting a flakey crust and being all cinnamon-y. It wasn't. It was okay, but nothing I'd expect from a restaurant. It tasted a little store-bought. Maybe they made it early in the morning... Anyway, this place was worth a try. The food overall was ok. Nothing I'd return for, but still worth trying out.

I came here awhile ago and I've been wanting to write a review about this restaurant. It's not THAT good, and over-hyped. I really can't figure out why people love this place so much. We used Yelp to find a local eatery because we just moved into the neighborhood. We wanted to hit up the local hot spot, and we came across Phillipe's The Original Restaurant. I read all the positive feedback on the famous French dip sandwich so I made a late-night food run with my girlfriend. When we arrived, there were plenty of people waiting in line. It was a cafeteria-style communal dining area with spacious seating. I looked around and everyone seemed to be enjoying their meal, which is sometimes a clear indication about the quality of the food. Being our first time there, I didn't know what to order so I asked the waitress what she would recommend. She gave me this "Are you serious?" look but did recommend the beef sandwich. I ordered the beef French dip sandwich and my girlfriend ordered the lamb sandwich. Despite the rude behavior of the waitress, I really wanted to try to enjoy the food with the rest of the customers. We got our food, and I took my first bite of Phillipe's famous sandwich. Are YOU serious? It's NOTHING special. I grabbed their homemade mustard to give it a bit more flavor but not so great either. I don't understand why people rave about this place so much. It's far from being spectacular. �I made a late-night run for food and to come home disappointed makes it exponentially worse. Never again.

YUMMMMM! You know a place is good when you see all sorts of people here. Luckily parking wasn't too frustrating and the lines weren't too long-- The BF and I had their famous beef and turkey French Dip sandwich (double-dipped!), side of potato salad, and chili. Everything was amazing! The sandwiches had great flavor; don't forget their hot mustard! The potato salad was one of the best I have had-- so light, crisp, and tart. The chili was off the hook! I LOVE this place and can't wait too come back. P.S. I came here after the Laker parade and it was packed with fans. Laker approved = Yelp-approved! :)

LOVE Philippes. I had just finished a hike in Malibu with my brother and his friend when we decided to stop here for a bite. My brother was telling me how amazing this place was and I thought he was crazy. Dude, it's just meat and bread. Au jus kidding me? But I was wrong. So very wrong. I think what makes the sandwiches here so good is the simplicity! I ordered one beef double dip and I wasn't all that impressed. I loved the flavor of the jus in all its salty goodness but there wasn't enough of it! So I ordered another beef dip, but this time wet. AMAZING! I happen to be one of those weirdos that purposefully packs a sandwich early so I can enjoy it soggy later (yea I know, what a sad childhood). So this sandwich was right up my alley. The jus has an intense beef flavor so I highly recommend getting your sandwich wet to fully take advantage of it! Paired with a glass of iced tea, these sandwiches hit the spot. Just a fair warning, the mustard is not yellow mustard. I repeat, the mustard is NOT regular yellow mustard. It is a hot mustard with horseradish so don't do what my brother's friend did and douse your sandwich in it - your nostrils will definitely flare up!

Only reason this place is getting 3 stars from me is the BOMB potato salad. I love me some potato salad. Ok, tradition says you get Phillipes before the game. Mistake. Get a dodger dog instead. There's a lot across the street to park and street parking, but GOOD LUCK (I even went when there was no game and this is the same scenario). Maybe I just really don't like french dipped bread. French dipped "tastes" good BUT - the sandwich was not very warm by the time I received it (I waited 25 minutes in line both before the game and on an off day) and SOGGY SOGGY BREAD- it looked and felt like mashed potatoes. I probably should've used a fork. It was falling apart as I ate it. As I recall, I believe I got turkey and it was dry and lukewarm. Gross gross gross. Overrated. Too much hype. Next time I go to the game, I'm just going for the dodger dog.

I picked up the beau for dinner and after spending his entire Saturday afternoon watching "Man vs Food," he suggested we hit up Philipe's for a French Dip. 蔔either of us had ever been, and with the amount of hunger we were carrying, we didn't hesitate at the thought of devouring a delicious au jus-dipped sandwich. Upon entering this place, I got a strange cafeteria-like feeling because of the weird lighting and all of the old people hanging out. 蔠e walked up to the counter to order our sandwiches and questioned getting some of their sides, but to be honest, nothing seemed appealing. 蔍 wasn't really in the mood for a pickled pig's foot or some mayonnaisey macaroni or potato salad, so it was a lamb with swiss sandwich for me. 蔇 got the beef with swiss, and held back from getting the chili for some reason, although seeing someone else order it, I wouldn't mind going back for it. This place is cash only and our two sandwiches and a 16 oz beer came out to about $20. 蔔ot bad. I asked the server if we could get some au jus on the side and she said we couldn't; that she dipped the sammich for us (minus half a star right there). 蔠e sat down at one of the big communal tables to chow down. My sandwich was pretty good. 蔜he lamb was very tender, but not too flavorful. 蔍t wasn't bad at all... just... not so flavorful. 蔜he sandwich was a bit soggy, I'm guessing because of the au jus, but I feel like that made my meal feel less filling. 蔄s though the bread just kind of disappeared in my mouth. 蔜he swiss cheese was a good compliment, but the definite thumbs up was for the spicy mustard. 蔛O GOOD! 蔛o so good! 蔇efinitely buying some of that to go next time! Once our meal had disappeared (which, with the amount of hunger we were packing, took less than five minutes), we realized we were still hungry... Neither of us wanted pie, so I decided to turn our night into a french-dipped adventure. 蔠e headed over to Cole's since D had never been. �Please read updated Cole's review for the reasons why, although everyone will hate me, Cole's is better than Philippe's x 10 imho.) Once we thought of leaving, I realized the reason this place looked like a bit of a mess was because there was no place for people to throw their trash away and no one was bussing tables. 蔒aybe they were short-staffed, but it definitely gave this place a bit of a chaotic feel to it. �All in all, the pluses are that the french dip is tasty (lamb better than beef), the spicy mustard is amaaaazing (and available for purchase), and you can't beat those prices. �If I could change things, I would let the customer dip his/her own sandwich into their own au jus because my sandwich was too soggy for my liking. 蔍f you like soggy bread, you'll like this dip more than Cole's.

If I ever get a chance, I need a re-do on this place. I used to had an ex-boss that loves to come down to Old Chinatown and search for the next "Great Meal". We came by this location because he got lost on his way to Sam Woo or Hop Woo. (both are on the same street, but he can't find it until the week after) Don't worry, I got both of them reviewed already. Since it looked like a deli, he thought he can just ordered a steak. He made the same fu*king mistake when we were at Langlier, now this place won't bailed him out. Because they don't have steak. Ha! I guess what pissed him off was that it only takes cash and it's like a self serve diner. He was shocked to learned that it's a sub sandwich that is dipped into a sauce. He kept asking me if that is all they have. *sigh* The soup and pie wasn't going to do it, but that didn't stop his complaining. After the food was ready, the beef french dip I ordered was very good. He ordered Tuna sandwich and proceed to tell it sucked. C'mon!!! Did not enjoyed a peaceful meal, but it was not the fault of Philippe. If I can leave the spoiled monkey in the cage, I would do it in a heartbeat. The food was good, the restaurant looked like an old fashioned deli, and service was so so. Now If I can only re-do the experience, I would definitely do it much more differently.....by telling my ex-boss to go Hop Woo and leave him there.

You wanna talk local spot to grab some food in Downtown LA, you gotta bring up Philippe's french dip sandwiches. On the way to see Los Doyers for a weekend day game? It doesn't get more Angeleno than rollin up here for a dip, lemonade and mac salad on a sunny day, but be prepared to wait as the lines go out the door (on Ord St.) I've never had a bad sandwich here, beef dip or turkey dip. Just don't ask for the au jus on the side, because they don't do that here! They prepare each sandwich by dipping the insides first, so your bread is flaky on the outside and juicy on the inside. One recommendation I stand by is the chili. 蔍t's so hearty and tasty, and if you're a little hungrier than usual it goes well with chips. (I prefer Fritos). For all you spicy mustard fans, yes, the mustard is SPICY.

Depending where you first enter you walk down the stairs to discover a vintage looking deli counter area, the floors covered in some sort of dust or hay and lots of dining space (reminiscent of a cafeteria). That is where the allure of Philippe's begins.It's also the experience of going to an L.A. institution that gets the masses to come. I ordered the beef double dip and I thought it was okay. And this is why; First, I did enjoy the bread which had a great texture and taste (plus it was doubled dipped) but I thought that the meat was dry. It was a good sandwich just not mind blowing. I also ordered the coleslaw which was tasty so maybe the other side 蔰ishes are just as good. Would I come back? Sure, I mean it's right next to Union Station and Olvera Street. Plus it has a nice vintage quality that throws you back to older times and good service. It's just that the food was good just not great but that might be because it was so hyped that I idealized the sandwich. Overall, Phillippe's = a good place to start your exploration of L.A �Thanks Ken). **Beware the mustard is surprisingly potent (a.k.a. hot). Not exactly sure how to describe the burning sensation but it sure did clear my sinuses!

Good cheap sandwiches, but LONG wait (about 30-40 mins). We got here on a Sunday morning, but there was some sort of run or marathon that morning, so it seemed like there were more people than usual. We ended up getting the beef dip and lamb dip sandwiches, along with a side of their macaroni salad. We also had a bowl of their chicken tortilla soup. Everything was pretty good, but I dont think I would wait in line again for their sandwiches.

This place is always packed & you should be prepared to wait in line for at least 15~20min pretty much whenever you go. However, Philippe's has their own parking lots (which is always a plus in downtown!) so definitely give it a try if you haven't already & make sure to take some cash because it's cash only! Inside Philippe's you will see a deli counter. There are ~6 lines each with at least 7 people waiting. But trust me. It's worth the wait! When it's finally your turn, you order your items, they will prepare the food right in front of you, you pay and find a place to sit. Their floors are sprinkled with sawdust which gives this old, homey feel to the deli. My BF & I tried both the beef & pork, but decided that we like the "double dipped" Beef better because it was more moist. You can also add cheese & I liked mine with pepper jack. There is also house spicy mustard that tastes more like horse radish or wasabi but strangely addicting! Make sure to put a very small amount to taste first! In addition to our 'soggy' french dipped sandwiches, we always get their potato salad & pickled beets which are both amazing! I also love their 75cents lemonade! (lemonade is definitely better than iced tea). They also had great corn chowder & other sides you probably can't go wrong with. We heard great things about their boysenberry pies but forgot to eat it after taking it back home, so that is definitely on my to-eat list next time I am back at Philippe's!

It would be enough to go here just to people watch. 蔄s it so happens, the food is pretty good and cheap too. 蔄t 9:30 pm on a Sunday night, this place was full of interesting things to see - the sense of history and the stories that are waiting to be told. 蔍've never seen staff clean a showcase like that before. 蔜his place is perfect for a writer. �Oh, and food? 蔣es, it was good. 蔜asty sandwiches, dipped in sauce, served to you on a paper plate. 蔆heap lemonade. 蔖otato salad was just okay. 蔍'm going to try the cole slaw next time. 蔛eating on benches. 蔜Vs on and available. 蔕ld ladies behind the counter. 蔅rown walls. �I'm thinking I'm going to be back here really soon.

I saw a piece done on Phillipe's on FoodTV and I wrote it down on my list of places to go. 蔍 went last night and DAMN, that was good stuff. They claim to be the originator of the French Dip. 蔄lthough they don't give you a cup of au juis to dip your sandwich in, they actually take the top bun of the sandwich and dip the cut side in juice. 蔜his makes the sandwich really moist and it doesn't drip. The meat is super tender and full of flavor. 蔄 GREAT sandwich. I also got a cup of chili and a plate of potato salad. 蔜he chili was really good but a bit too salty, although I'm not complaining about that. 蔊et it with cheese and pile in the saltines. When I got to my table I saw a squirt bottle of a pinkish substance and had to find out what it was.....HORSERADISH!!! And damn good horseradish too. 蔍 covered my sandwich in that sh*t...a bit too much though because I had flames going up through my nose...but that makes it even better right? The atmosphere in great in here. 蔣ou order at the what looks like a 25 foot deli counter and take the stuff back to your table. 蔛aw dust covers the floors and they have cool stuff on the walls to look at. 蔆heck out the Sante Fe trains in the big glass cabinet in the back room on the way to the restrooms.

After four hours of elbowing biatches at the Monique Lhullier sample sale (two hours on line--recession, what?), my best friend thought I earned my keep. We headed to Phillipe's (I am a bad Angelino who has never been) and had a couple of beef dips, potato salad, pickled eggs, two glasses of lemonade and chocolate cream pie--all for $20. It could have been that I was famished and tired of a whole day of being around grabby, obnoxious women all day long, but those french dips went down nicely. The potato salad was especially good. As we finished our meal, we noticed a protest right outside to appeal Prop 8's passing and we raised our fists in solidarity. My friend is fortunate enough to be marrying the love of her life in a few months and the protest outside gave both of us a lump in our throat for what the folks outside were fighting for.

Hip or Hype...Definitely Hype... Yes this place has been here for over 100 years. And yes this place is a local land mark. However, despite its history and location, the food is nothing to rave about. Often times when I pass this place tourist take pictures in front of the restaurant, which gives credence to its attractive antiquity. A couple of issues here: 1. They only accept cash. 2. Their World Famous Sandwiches are not that special. Its just a regular turkey sandwich with cheese. Or a Roast Beef Or the other meats they have. 3. No fries 4. The Cole Slaw is eh. 5. Always crowded. I do have to give credit to the horseradish. It spicy and goes straight up your nose. The lemonade is also very refreshing. Given its attractiveness it worth to give this place a shot. However, in my experiences, I have not been all that impressed. Just an ordinary sandwich place, and quiet frankly I am not sure what all the hoopla is all about.

Sometimes a place is so part of your regular routine that you forget to yelp it. 蔒aybe it's the fact that this place already has hundreds of reviews to its credit already that I've managed to skip over it. 蔜ime to give props to Philippe's and their simply delicious dips. Just the history behind this place draws you in. 蔍t's stood there for a hundred years. 蔍n that very spot! 蔛erving french dipped sandwiches since they went for a quarter each (point goes to 1908). 蔍t's been through the prohibition era, the GREAT depression, two world wars, the golden years of Hollywood, to now. 蔜o their credit too, they keep as much of that classic old feel as possible--the way the counter staff dresses, the photos on the wall, sawdust on the floor, and even the candy shop. Well, a few things have changed. 蔍'm sure they didn't need two parking lots back in 1908 - ample free parking just about anytime of the day. 蔜hey probably also didn't have big screen TVs showing Dodger and Laker games (point awarded to 2009). If you're new to Philippe's, you'll probably be inclined to get the beef dip. 蔜his is a classic choice for your first foray into french dip territory. 蔄fter coming here a few times, my meal of choice is a double dipped lamb sandwich (yes double), side of coleslaw, and two of their lemonades (they're 60 cents, but small glasses). 蔜here's seating all over the place to supply the masses, and boy they can get massive lines on the weekends. Their mustard is another thing I like about this place. 蔅e careful with putting a lot though, cause it's surprisingly hot. 蔜hey also serve breakfast, wines, and beer. 蔊ood place to go with a group. 蔜he stuff also travels well for picnics and tailgates. 蔆ash only (what's a credit card in 1908?), but they have ATMs on site.

MAN VS FOOD That's why we were here. First thing we noticed...about 10 lines, restaurant was PACKED crazy. Everything was CHEAP! Lemonade, Ice tea for 75cents I think (can't recall). We ordered the pork and beef french dipped sandwiches. It wasn't for me, but my fiance really enjoyed it. He loved it. He would've gave it five stars. It's just I'm not a sandwich person hence the three stars. It was a simple sandwich. We had potato salad and cole slaw. I liked the cole slaw but not so much the potato salad. The ice tea was unsweetened. I wanted to try the lemonade, but I'll come back here again and have it next time.

It's a pretty tasty sandwich. 蔙eading the sub-3star reviews, I get the impression that not everyone is using the hot mustard. Anyway, I usually go with a pork sandwich (no cheese) or lamb if I feel like splurging. 蔛ide of macaroni salad, or chili, or maybe a slice of pie. 蔄nd a lemonade. 蔕r a cheap coffee if I have a hangover. I get that the service method has been like that for a long time, but it really could be more efficient. 蔋aving the ridiculous lines is just annoying. 蔘uestion to all the french dip-eaters out there: is there any reason to have your entire family standing in line with you? 蔣our whole clan has to shift over everytime anyone needs to get through with their food. 蔆ouldn't you just have one person next to you to keep you company, and sit the rest of the brats at a table? 蔄nd do you really need to have your 4 buddies each standing in a different line just to find that one line is 30 seconds faster than the other one. Sure, Philippe's could use a better system, but the people could help ease things too! How about an express line for people who are ordering 2 sandwiches or less. �As you can tell, this place is frustrating to me, but it should speak to the quality of the sandwich that I am willing to put myself through this every damn time.

Once each summer we make the trek from Long Beach to L.A. just to visit Philippe's. Yeah, we hide behind other reasons--one year it was to check out the Art Deco of Union Station, this year to see the Cathedral and Disney Hall...but really, we were just stalling until it was time for lunch. Lots of nay-sayers here in the Yelp universe, unfortunately, but I have to disagree with them. The roast beef sandwich is fantastic, and with a little of their hot hot hot (clean out your sinuses hot) mustard, it's magnificent. Good sides--cole slaw and mac salad--and with a beer, it's perfect for a summer's day. Yeah, it's usually packed and a little chaotic, which is why I only gave it four stars instead of five, but cool to see the tourists mingle with the crowds of cops down from Parker Center having lunch, one group of them toting cameras, the other sporting holsters. Ignore the bad reviews...Philippe's is an institution for its sandwiches as well as its history. Worth a visit.

Wait what, the swiss cheese isn't real? I don't know what the employee meant by that when my friend asked for a swiss cheese sandwich. Was it made out of plastic? Soy milk? Ummm... IDK, but trying the cheese alone, IDK what it was. It tasted gross and my friend just ate the bread alone. She pretty much discarded the cheese like it was Sunday's trash. As you can see, it was our first time there and she was a vegetarian. I, myself, helped myself to a beef sandwich, double dipped. And to be honest, I've had waaay better french-dipped sandwiches before. I was very disappointed when I took my first bite. Gave it another chance, and I was still disappointed with my second, third, and even my ninth bite... By the time I was finishing up the sandwich, I HAD to force myself to eat it all. (I don't like wasting food, and I only had a few bites left FYI. So I just had to!) And the mustard they served to put on your sandwich... mmm, IDK about that either. Reminded me of wasabi and I don't like wasabi, hence I didn't like their mustard sauce. It totally destroyed half of my sandwich. Wasn't a fan at all. Lastly, another one of my friends got reprimanded by an employee for being in the wrong order line. He was ordering dessert and coffee, and zzzamn, my bad if we're new to the place and didn't see the small sign that said the farthest left line was specifically for that. K, thanks, NOW we know. We'll keep that mind if we ever go back. BUTTTT, their spinach soup and coleslaw was craccin. I enjoyed those side dishes. I also liked their fresh lemonade and the ambiance was chill. The set up of the restaurant was cutesy and very roomie. And because of these reasons, they can pass with a 2 star rating from muah.

It's 1:30 in the afternoon on a Monday. Don't these people have someplace else to be!?! The wife and I rolled out to Chinatown to wander through the shops and get some food. Since we were close we headed the words of my local yelpsters and tried out some sammies at Philippe's. When we got there we were lucky enough to score parking, which let me tell you is a miracle in itself! The line, even on a Monday afternoon, was out the door. We waited for a little over 45 minutes and got the Beef and Lamb double dipped. While they weren't bad, they weren't epic. I'll nitpick and say I prefer my hot sammies NOT served luke warm with a cold slice of cheese. I didn't love it, but I did myself a disservice by forgetting to add the hot mustard. Maybe that will fix it all? Many of those food shows and some of the reviews describe these sammies as almost life altering, I've had some life altering foods and this didn't do it for me. I'll be back I know some of 蕀y yelp friends won't stand for a 3* review so we'll see which way it goes.

I really wanted to like this place based on all the positive reviews and keeping some of the negative reviews into account but I don't see anything special in their dipped roast beef sandwiches. I really don't. I even had it double dipped. It really didn't add that much more flavor. It just made my bread more soggy. I also ordered that $1 lemonade. It tasted like ordinary water with someone who squeezed one thin slice lemon into it. It didn't taste like anything remotely close to lemonade. They serve beer there. If it weren't for the beer, their wifi, and their being open late, I'd say this place is crap. They only take cash as well. It's like "Hello~~!! It's the 21st century. Get with the program, man!" Thankfully though, they have ATM machines there. However, I had a terrible time trying to get the ATM machine to give me my money. It tried but failed and yet the machine still charged me $2 for the failed transaction to give me my money. So I tried again at a different machine. That one failed too and I lost another $2. Golly gee. It must not like Chase debit cards because my credit card from Bank of America worked just fine.

Philippe's is a no-frills sandwich shop which will provide you adequate sustenance to keep you going the rest of the day. 蔜he portions are not large, not terribly tasty, and not extraordinary in any sense. 蔍 was told the ROAST BEEF sandwich was the way to go, DOUBLE DIPPED and a side of POTATO SALAD. 蔔othing was better than an ordinary deli, so I wondered what all the fuss was about.

We made the short trip here on a lazy Sunday to see what the hype was only to leave emotionally unchanged. If what I got was considered double-dipped, what's the single-dip like? The Sahara? The beef was aight. The turkey was somewhat nostalgic to elementary school lunch roasted turkeyness. I make better apple pie and KFC's coleslaw is far more titillating.

I seriously generally do not write negative reviews of places, with the exception of credit card companies, because if you can't say something nice don't say anything at all, and I would hate to negatively impact a local business, and I understand how difficult it is to simply operate a restaurant even close to seamlessly...but I just heard some folks on a food show on the radio recommending this place to people coming to LA as like a must eat LA place...and I want to be the one guy to say, you can skip this place for a number of reasons... If you are the type of person who likes to wait too long and pay too much and receive too little go to Philippe's... I am from the South and have had Gyro's in New York when I lived there (Astoria Queens fool), I had cheese-steaks at Pat's, Geno's, and the much better than both of those but less known, Cosmi's in Philly...in short I have had some damn good sandwiches but not at Phillippes... You will wait at least 40 minutes for what we would call a mini-sandwich in the South, and they just ain't nothing to write home about... Sometimes a place gets a huge following and it begins to "Rest on it's laurels", that is they get too comfortable, maybe they know they have such a strong customer base, they can trim back the size of the product maybe the quality and reap the profits, I don't know but this place is not what everyone is telling you...maybe the sandwich used to be bigger, better, but now it is a production line and the sandwich is small, the wait is long, and while the taste of the sandwich may not be bad, for the wait, and the hype it is not enough... �It is a long wait, no seating, 7-9 dollar mini-bite-sandwich, and not altogether wonderful, for the rep... 2 more things, they claim to have invented the French Dip, Bull Shizo, I mean really? The french dip was invented before California was even founded.... They really think they were the first people to dip the bread of a roast beef sandwich in the jeu of the beef, C'mon, and if you are going to claim to be the inventors of something, you should serve the Best and this is not, and will not be the best french dip you have ever had unless it's the only french dip you ever had... Also this place doesn't' represent LA. LA, like it or not is represented by a heavy Mexican population, so I say if you want a sandwich that represents LA and is worth the money, and for those visiting LA if you want to delve a little deeper into the real LA (And not just stop in at some tourist trap) go to Cemitas Poblanas in Van Nuys Because if you come to LA and think Phillipe's, in any way shape or form represents this city and it's flavor you are sorely mistaken...you want a french dip sandwich make it at home, you want a sandwich uniqely Los Angeles get a Torta or a Cemita (I reccomend the Cemita)(Both traditional Mexican sandwiches) Go get yourself a Cemita at Cemitas Poblanas, and if you do go to Phillipe's you'll be hungry after-wards so keep Cemitas in mind they will fill you up with a true flavor of LA...and a big ass can't fit it in your mouth without dislocating your jaw sammich...when you are eating your Cemita you will probably think if not say out loud, "Yep, damn THIS sandwich IS LA" Cemitas Link http://www.yelp.com/biz/�###sam d.

This may be my favorite place in LA, whenever I'm feeling down I go here and get a sandwich and some potato salad and a coke, if I have extra cash I'll get a slice of pie....it's the most happiness you can have for under $20 without a brass pole being involved. The whole place reminds me of something from my childhood in the south. The waitresses alone make it worth the trip with the awesome uniforms and the old style lunch counter arrangement. Everyone eats together on big tables-it's awesome. The potato salad isn't as good as mom's but it's close, the sandwiches are good, even better if you can split a third with a buddy. It's always fun to watch who'll order some pickled eggs or feet....

Decided to stop by because I was apartment hunting in LA and lunch was in order. 蔙emembered seeing this place on Man vs. Food and said "heck yea, let's try it." �Got luck with parking given that it was a weekend and they have a nice little lot out back. 蔅ut once I stepped into the restaurant it was a different story. 蔜he lines were Looooooong, probably from all the Travel Channel promo. Ordered the lamb double french dip, a side of slaw, and an ice tea. 蔜he lamb was tender and dipping the roll twice made a major difference flavorwise. 蔜he slaw was fresh but nothing spectacular. 蔍ce tea was refreshing and dirty cheap at under $1. 蔄lso, tried mom's turkey which turned out really dry and bro's beef but it didn't top the lamb. The real winner and reason I would go back is the Phillipe's spicy mustard. 蔍t is a most potent condiment and you can definitely feel the horsradish doing it's work. 蔍 bought a jar and it jazzes up all of my sandwiches at home now. I may give it another try when I run out of mustard. 蔄ll in all, Philippe's made for a decent lunch.

My gf and I are interested in coming back to try another sandwich, next time, not dipped but we won't be going out of our way to get here, maybe if we're in the neighborhood next time.

Philippe brings back memories of my mom and grandparents. 蔒y grandparents worked there during the 40's and have made it part of our lives since then. My grandparents always cooked her macaroni salad, potato salad beef dips, and pickled eggs just as they learned at Philippe's. �This weekend is the one year anniversary of her passing and my family will make a special trip to Philippe's to honor her. �Thank you Philippe's for being forever part of our lives... A must is their lamb sandwich double dipped with the famous mustard and a slice of lemon meringue pie. Don't forget your cup of 10 cent coffee.

Cheap food. Cheap coffee. Cash only. They claim to have invented the french dip, but I could really care less as long as it's good. Which it was. It definitely isn't your typical french dip - you tell them if you want one or two sides dipped, and they dip the sandwich in the broth before serving it to you. When I order FD's, I like having a bowl of the drippings to myself, so that every bite has some sauciness to it, and so that the bread doesn't get soggy (allowing you to eat at your own pace). But it's a quick meal, and they make your sandwich right when you order. The lines can be really long on the weekdays, as its location provides for a short escape from the corporate world during lunch hour. It's dead smack in between Union Station and Chinatown (walking distance from both!), and is easily accessible from the Metro Gold Line.

Not a bad french dip sandy. To be honest, i don't venture into the french dip world, it's just not my thing. But coming and not getting one was, well, just weird. That being said, the lady and i ordered up a pair of the beefies, a side of potato salad and a bowl of chili. Sandys: Damn. I missed out on the double dip. The lady sitting next to us started up a lengthy convo with us and had me shed a tear after realizing what could have been. *le sigh* I guess that's all the more reason to go back and get my dip on. Potato Salad: Great. You gotta try it, seriously, it's really damn good. Chili: Honestly, my favorite part of the meal. Straight chili, no beans. Some of the best i ever had, no lie. The chick threw a fit 蔮ecause i was hogging it all as we were trying to maintain our conversation with our new friends. If you're in the area, check it out, you wont be disappointed.

Saturday morning and you wake up in downtown L.A. with vicious beer munchies. What to do, what to do? Philippes! Your mouth already starts salivating for French dipped sandwhiches, lemonade and ice tea for cents, and a cheesecake slice so delicious, you wonder why cheesecake factory even tries! The lines are epic, but who cares? You rub shoulders with people who make LA go round. Quick service, chat it up with the cold-faced employees serving me food, 蕀ake em crack a smile and head on up the stairs to grab a table. Beauty of this spot is that my friends and I can always point out our names we tagged into the wall along with the millions of other people. The food hits the spot, perfecttly roasted meat, gently dipped so its not too wet and not too dry. The iced tea and lemonade go down smoothly over a few laughs with friends and the half eaten cheesecake remidns you that youll always end up buying a shit load more food than you can eat at this place. Hit it up!

Everything I expected after reading all the reviews...and more! The craziness, the crowds, the goodness, and downright yumminess of it all! Driving past Philippe's was already crazy because you could see how full the parking lots were and all the cars just waiting for someone to leave!!! So I knew...oh darn there was going to be a long line as promised during lunch time. Finally get a spot, and walk in through a side door. Whoops...gotta get to the other side cause there was no way to get through the crowd to the end of the line! It was just amazing to see how many people were here. All just in line waiting to be served at the counter. Though its worse than it looks since its like 10 lines or something. You pick one and hope you get a fast line. Erm, I swear mine was the slowest. At least I had time to look around. Decor and atmosphere was like a homey craziness. Everything was well worn in and people were just all over. All the counter ladies were older and had that efficient mom look. There was something all over the floor, not sure why, but maybe for traction? I noticed people coming down these stairs a lot, where they were leaving from a bunch of rooms upstairs. Kinda weird cause its not all open, its like private rooms. And to the main point...the food. Between me and my friend...lamb with bleu cheese double dip, beef double dip, mac salad, and potato salad. The sandwiches were sooo good....I really liked the beef one...it could'nt have been any better! I like the lamb too, but it would've been better sliced than in chunks. And the hot mustard...really really finished off the sandwich! Just perfect. Haha has lotsa horseradish though, kept shooting up my nose. The mac salad and the potato salad were both pretty good, the mac salad better cause it had a lot more crunch to it (celery). I intended to take a pic of it before I ate, but I was too hungry by the time my sloooowww line had moved me up to the front that I just devoured it! Oh well too bad. I'm sure there are plenty of pics anyhow. I really liked this place!!! Been wanting to try it for a while! Its good sandwiches at good prices and you get what you expect! I love that they don't charge you more just cause they're an LA staple!

I visited LA from San Antonio last weekend, and this was my first meal on my trip. I'd read over a few reviews on Yelp when my friend told me we'd be eating lunch at Philippe's. I'm not particularly a connoisseur of french dip sandwiches, but I gave weight to all the great reviews online and accepted. I was not disappointed. Order: Pork French Dip, potato salad, tea. I also snacked on my friend's beets (and by snacked, I mean tasted, picked at, and eventually stole and finished her order). YUM. The bread was soft, the au jus was just right (although I feel slighted that I didn't know to order it double dipped), the potato salad was fresh, and the beets tasted like the ones my grandma used to pickle at home. Because of the juiciness of it all, the bread on the sandwich was falling apart by the end, which made it a little more difficult to eat, but I'm up for a challenge any day. Maybe I need to eat it faster (quite impossible, I'd think, since I basically inhaled it). I probably just need to improve my sandwich skills in general. Also, $8.29 for sandwich, side, and tea? What a freakin' deal.

This updated review is more for more tastebuds than anything else. LOL! My boyfriend and my boyfriend's dad had just completed the 9ish-mile San Gabriel walk commemorating LA's 229th birthday and you better believe we were starving after that! I know I was! Fortunately, Philippe was just around the corner from the end of the walk. This time I ordered the French dip with pork. Let me just say that at this very minute, I'm still thinking about it. The tender slices of pork just melted in my mouth. The French roll was cushy, like pillows of carbolicious heaven in my mouth. And of course, I had some of the Hot Mustard. The sad thing was that the mustard is no longer in jars but in plastic squirt bottles. It was a little bit un-appetizing for a split second, but I just had to have it! Mm.. it was cleared my nasal cavities and then some GOOD! Thank you Philippe for easing my out-of-shape body aches. But damn you for making me want you more and more!

Loooove this place! 蔅een living in LA my entire life, and it was my friend that showed me this place. 蔍'm usually the one telling people about cool spots to hit up, so this was a great turn of events. We had the Beef, Lamb, and Pork French Dip, ordered "double dip," for even more juicy goodness. 蔄lthough my friend disagrees, here is my breakdown starting from the best: Pork Beef Lamb There was something about the Pork Dip... oh-so juicy and tender. 蔍 just couldn't get over it. 蔍 felt like it gave me the energy I needed to keep pushing on. The Beef Dip was pretty darn good. 蔍t seemed like lean meat while being juicy at the same time. 蔊ood thing I requested the "double dip." As for the Lamb Dip... the flavor was very clearly lamb. 蔜he meat, of course, was juicy, but was my least favorite among the three. �We also ordered potato salad, macaroni salad, tapioca, and a slice of cherry pie. Mac Salad -pretty good.. but nothing compared to the potato salad. �Potato Salad -much better. 蔉eel like one French Dip isn't enough? order this and you should be good. Tapioca -obscenely better than your standard run of the mill tapioca. 蔛eriously, it was surprisingly delicious. Cherry Pie -By this point, my stomach was about to explode, but I managed to kill off the pie. 蔞ery good. 蔙eminded me of a colder version of McDonald's once beloved Cherry Pie. Having eaten so much damn food as my last meal in Los Angeles and RIGHT before my long roadtrip, this was definitely not a good call on my part. 蔔onetheless, excellent meal! �Now if only I hadn't forgotten my damn camera in LA. 蔖ictures to come!

Okay so obviously this place is the home of the french dip sandwich y yes its amazing, but I totally come here for 3 things: 1.) Homemade pickles 2.) Homemade coleslaw 3.) The cheesecake!!!!

I believe that the first couple days after passing and health inspection is the CLEANEST time to go to a restaurant. � ) Thanks to the LA Street Food Fest really being a festival of waiting in lines, bf and I decided to come here instead. 蔣ay! 蔣es, the lines were long here and yes, the tables were crowded. 蔅ut we had just been desensitized by a much more chronic line situation at the LA Center Studios, so we felt practically alone in this place in comparison. We tried the beef, lamb, and pork sammiches - all with jack cheese, double dipped, a side of coleslaw, pickles and iced teas for the bargain price of $24. 蔜he sammiches were all juicy, home-made tasting, and (because they weren't ginormous) filling without making us feel leadbelly-ish. 蔜he hot mustard is a great condiment (in moderation!) and the coleslaw just rounds everything out. The pies looked YUM, but we stayed away this time. �Service was fast - you wait in line, they take your order and make it right in front of you, and before you know it you're searching out an empty table and chowing down! After we walked down Olvera Street for an hour, we came back to our car (2pm-ish) and the line for Phillippe's was OUT THE DOOR. 蔠hich might have made us turn around if that's how it was when we got there - so word to the wise: come early, or be prepared to wait!

Order the Turkey Sandwich! Wow. I was seriously impressed. 蔜he meat, tender and juicy, and extra juicy with the au jus dip. 蔒y eyes are always bigger than my stomach of course, so I ordered the following: Roasted Turkey in au jus Pickled Beets (a tad too sweet) Pickle Cherry Pie -------------------- = for about $12 bux. I really liked the pickled beets, but they had too much sugar in them. 蔜he flavor of the beets alone would have been nice with the pickled onion that's in the mix. �The pickle was $1.00 and they quarter it for you, I gave most of it away because they're kinda big. Cherry pie, wasn't impressed. 蔜he crust seemed mass produced, and the filling was most likely canned considering the fake jelly like consistency. 蔍 will try the Banana Cream pie next time. And, I'll definitely be getting the Turkey sandwich again!

First off, expect to eat two sandwiches if you are hungry, three if you are starving. 蔍 recommend the turkey dip over the beef one. 蔋ere's the perfect lunch (I'm not bragging, I'm just experienced): 2- plain turkey DOUBLE dip (always ask for double dip) 1- turkey double dip with cheese 2- iced tea 1- lemonade 1- draft Bud (it's like $1.20) 1- tapioca 1- nine cent coffee (50% cost increase since I started going here) waddle out holding your stomach. 蕋hank me laters.

Don't let the Disneyland type long lines deter you from enjoying one of their famous sandwiches. There is something to be said about an institution that is over 100 years old. You have to see what the "hype" is about. Mr. B and I recently went here after a Dodgers game and were not disappointed. We split a single dipped beef sandwich and a single dipped turkey sandwich. If you get double dipped it would probably be too soggy for our taste. The rolls were fresh and soft and probably made that morning. It's a very simple sandwich no fancy ingredients. If you want some added kick enjoy some of their spicy mustard. It's the horseradish that will get you but it doesn't hurt to add a little. We also enjoyed lemonade for 75 cents! You can't even get that at a kids lemonade stand. We also split a beer which was cold and reasonably priced. One of things that impressed me about the beer was that it was very cold something you sometimes cant even get at a bar! We will definitely come back to try the sides and a different type of sandwich.

Absolutely delicious. Got the turkey french dip, a slice of cheesecake to share, and a lemonade. TIP: get two lemonades, they're only 75 cents and served in small glasses. My friend ordered a ham french dip, but I think the lady misheard her and gave her a lamb one instead. Honest mistake. My meal was delicious. The cheesecake was well made and tasty. I can't wait to go back! It is definitely worth the wait, and the hype.

I try to shy away from hyperbole, so don't confuse this statement as anything of the sort: This place is incredible. 蔠hen coupled with a Dodger's game there are few better afternoons/evenings one can spend in Los Angeles. 蔜he sandwiches are great, especially with their spicy house mustard. 蔜he food is cheap, the atmosphere is authentic and welcoming and there's so much history (which is, admittedly, hard to come by in Los Angeles). 蔜here's also a railroad "museum" in the back room, which I'm still confused by to this day. --- To get there, take anything (bus or rail) to Union Station.

It almost seems frivolous to write a review about a place so heavily reviewed... almost. 蔍 figure it's the mass of reviews that helps show others where the best places are to go, so here's my 2 cents. Love the sandwiches. 蔉rench dipped and simple. 蔛lice of cheese on beef always seems to be the most appealing to me. 蔍 tried the pickled egg tonight just to see what was up with it, and it didn't really thrill me. 蔍t was fine, but I probably wouldn't spend money on it again. �The drinks are cheap. 蔍 tend to opt for the free water, but you can also get a 65 cent cup of lemonade, or 55 cent cup of iced tea. 蔊reat price... but they are on the small side. 蔒y friend ordered a cup of 9 cent coffee, being very thrilled at the price, only to discover why it was probably worth only 9 cents. 蔜hough she did end up drinking the whole cup, so it must've not been all that bad. Great place to go out to eat if you don't want to spend a whole lot and want a very casual, no frills atmosphere. 蔄lso a great place to take out of towners.

I've been a few times now at various times of the day, and the lines are always long. But they move and the ladies behind the counter are fast and friendly. I always have pig out on both potato and macaroni salad, iced tea and lemonade, and a double-dipped roast beef with cheese. I've heard good things about the lamb, I might have to try it next time. I usually split a pickle if I'm there with a friend, but they are too big for me by themselves. They should sell halves. I like the atmosphere, it's really casual. It can seem daunting trying to find a place to sit if it's really busy, I think they have extra seating upstairs, but I've never had to go up there, I can usually find a spot at the long communal tables, rubbing shoulders with strangers who are sharing in the enjoyment of the (rumored) original French Dip.

Ok, I'm not gonna lie. I'm not exactly a French dip connoisseur, but I know what I like, and I know I like good food. We stopped by Philippe's as a part of a massive food tour I organized while my brother was in town. And unfortunately, didn't get a chance to try the lamb that was supposed to be absolutely bomb! So, beef it was. And I must say, I highly enjoyed my roast beef French dip! Yes, it was a little plain, but plain is still amazing as long as it's made with quality, right? I mean... Just picture a good steak with nothing on it but salt and pepper. That's when you know a steak is pretty damn good. That's how I felt about my sandwich. It was plain. But it was juicy, tasty, and I can't wait to make my next trip over here! The mustard was pretty amazing too. It gave one hell of a kick that almost knocked me off my seat. Literally! And it left me just wanting more! Philippe's... I'm ready and raring to try your lamb dip! And when I do, I WILL update this review. Hopefully to a 5-star. ;)

Hands down, best french dip that I've found in 10 years with the possible exception of Houston's(but that's 24 dollars or something crazy!!). 蔒ake sure you get it double dipped! 蔊reat sides, ample parking, awsome desserts, and you usually run into a jury or two.... Pickles are worth ordering here as well. �Phillippe's is pretty old school, the cashiers aren't allowed to handle cash, there is sawdust on the floor and they sell some kind of pickled eggs that are a nasty purple color, but it definitively has charm. 蔄nd the dips... beef, pork, lamb and turkey are great. 蔋and carved meat, fresh rolls and decent prices. 蔍t's really the only place I go downtown. 蔐ove it!!!

This is a fun, simple place to stop for a simple yet tasty sandwhich. The French Dip in LA started here and still lives here. Lunch line style, order at the counter, pay with cash type of place. Very good sandwhich which is excellent double or triple dipped. The sides are adequate, not great, and it is a fun place. Things that make it that much better: 1. 9 cent coffee, that is not actually too bad 2. the hot mustard - simply unbelievable - pick one up to go 3. the prices are acceptable Things which could be improved: 1. the lines can often be way too long Fun place, worth the trip, don't expect culinary genious, and you will be happy!

There is a lot of hype surrounding this place, yes. But Phillipes has substance too. The atmosphere here is something that gets overlooked. There is no way to escape the feeling of being lost in a crowd of random people here which isnt a bad thing in this case. It forces you to talk with new people and maybe even drop some eaves. And the food is good. And remember, its a $6 sandwich made with less than $6 worth of ingredients so dont expect filet mignon. All in all its a good place to have a bite and a good convo but dont expect your socks to be completely knocked off. -Make sure you try the baked apples. Delicious!

Cash only. 蔄tm available as well as phone booths.

Well maybe it's because I got there during the perfect storm. The SC game just let out and the Dodger game was going on, meaning plenty of people had left early and wanted food, just like us! And because of that, my sandwich was COLD. And my favorite part of the french dip is the actual dipping part. But Philippe's likes to dip the bottom of the bread in for you. And even I request both the top and bottom of the bun dipped, it just wouldn't be the same. So no thanks. After such a long tiring day I want something HOT.

Order: beef dip Satisfied: hardly I think the hype around this place is it's history, not the deliciousness of it's sandwiches. The sandwich was ok. It's kinda hard to screw up a french dip sandwich. 蔍n fact, I hardly think I notice any difference from one sandwich to the next. The only way to make them better than anywhere else is maybe garlic bread, some swiss, and a dash of horseradish. But they aren't necessary. Anyways, I have a bone to pick with them. I went there once. I ordered the beef dip, and roast beef surrounded by sloppy, soggy mush. No big deal...I'll just come back some other time and ask for the au jus on the side...you know...the way EVERY OTHER RESTAURANT serves french dip sandwiches. So, I go back. Saucy broad behind the counter: "Do you want your sandwich dipped?" Innocent, unsuspecting, doe-eyed me: "Actually, can I just get the au jus on the side?" Broad: "No." Me: "Just in a little cup?" Dragon Lady: "That's against our policy" Me: "WELL IT'S AGAINST MY POLICY TO EAT SOGGY SANDWICHES!!!!!!!" [Note: I was no longer doe-eyed and innocent at this point] And then I stormed out and left. Whatever happened to the customer is always right? Did they not have a little cup to put the jus in? I know they serve soup, so they must have some container that would suffice. Why would they refuse to serve french dip sandwiches the RIGHT way? I will take my french dip sandwich eating business elsewhere, thank you very much. Why would I go to Phillipe's anyways when Wurstkutchen is right down the street?

Ample parking, fast lines, a good sandwich annnnd a packed restaurant on a 12:30 PM lunch, I'm a very happy camper. With ten lines and efficient workers, I was sitting down with my food within 10 minutes of stepping into the door. This is one tasty sandwich; the beef French dipped sandwich with a French onion soup and lemonade definitely hit the spot. Cash only and ten lines. 蔋urry and get your sandwich here. Add cheese for an additional charge.

I have had this place bookmarked for a long time and finally made it here today. 5-stars for the kitsch appeal, being the OG french dip joint, all the sides and the scrumptious pies...except the boysenberry, it was too tart. Unfortunately, their claim to fame sandwich, the beef French dip was mediocre at best. If you want a great French dip, go to Houston's there's is damn good and a bench mark for this type of sandwich.

So a friend and I were on another adventure around Los Angeles, this place was our plan B. Our plan A was to *try* and get a table at Daikokuya - but that place is small small small, and there were people lining the sidewalk outside. Meh - we were starving! I was so hungry, I nearly passed out in line at Philippe's. More on that later. So, we were walking around Little Tokyo, and poking around in the little shops. We were hungry when we started, and I believe we were farting around for about 2 hours before we started to find Daikokuya. We put our name down, but there was a lot of people waiting, and it was around 4:00pm when we got there. Early dinner/late lunch crowd, but on a Friday, day after Christmas. Instead of waiting, we walked over to Philippe's instead. It was a nice walk - went by the Correctional Facility (aka Los Angeles Central Prison), walked by the train station, and there we were. Not a long walk. So we go inside, and I had never been, so I noticed saw dust on the floor, and a bazillion people waiting in lines. Yes - there were many many lines, all of which had at least 10 people per, and even more people eating. So - place packed of hungry peoples. We jump into a line and wait. And wait. And wait. I think we were in the line for at least half of an hour with very little movement. It doesn't help that each patron in line ordered at LEAST three sandwiches... which holds up everyone else. ugh. By this time, I guess I was super hungry, or super dehydrated, I'm not sure which, but I almost blacked out waiting in line. I had to sit down and make sure I didn't create a scene in the place. So, when we were finally able to order, I had to crouch down to the floor while my friend ordered for us. This NEVER happened to me, especially to the point where I was seconds from blacking out. Jeez. Embarassing. In any case, we both get the Beef Dip w/ Monterey Jack cheese and Arnold Palmers. So, I took a sip of the Arnold Palmer, and had enough energy to muster to be able sit down and eat. We find a seat, and dig in. DELICIOUS. Worth the wait AND my near blackout. The cheese was mild and played well with the Au Jus of the dip. Sandwich was kinda small - 蔍 thought they would be bigger, but I finished it and felt satisfied. We ended up getting a Churro on Olivera St, and it finished off our meal. So, this place - love it! Love the phone booths along the wall, and the food was simple, but SO good. Well worth the walk and overall experience. I can't wait until we can go again. :) OH - I didn't try the mustard - I was so focused on maintaining my homeostasis. I need to try the mustard, so that's my excuse to go back.

Super good sandwiches! Pretty friendly staff too. However, the layout was weird. It was sooo crowded you couldn't even tell where the lines began...just totally packed with ppl. you could barely walk in the door...Crazy. And it was a little hard to find seating. Also, as delicious as the sandwiches are, they are quite small. leaves you wanting more.

I'll be honest here - I am a French Dip Fiend. 蔍 love that sandwich and am always searching for a record-breaking benchmark to sample. 蔠ith all the hype I had to try Philippe's. It was a disappointment. 蔍 don't care about the decor. 蔍 didn't drop any points because I was eating in a manger with sawdust on the floor. 蔍 really don't mind. 蔍'm an outdoors guy. 蔍 respect the retro style. �The problem is the object d'amour here. 蔜he food that dreams are made of - the French Dip Sandwich - was quite lame. 蔜he bun was el cheapo and dry, the beef was bad deli quality and quite bland. 蔔ot only was it bland meat, but it had large fatty gristle on a few of the pieces. 蔜he whole ensemble was slapped on a paper plate pre-juiced. 蔖re-juiced?? 蔄 French Dip? 蔜he jus is for me to dus! 蔍 need to dip my own dip so it is just right. �The lemonade may very well have been Hi-C or Kool-Aid (in a 1950's glass, of course). The cashier was friendly and the ambience was busy, but relaxed. 蔝nfortunately, the Dip flopped. My advice, if you have a passion for French Dips, is journey to Los Altos Grill (Bay Area), Rutherford Grill (near Napa), or our own Houstons, for the prime-rib French Dip. 蔄sk for the horseradish sauce. It'll cost you the price of three Philippe's, but hey, you won't get mugged by somebody who just escaped the nearby prison, and the sandwich is out of this world.

I love Philippe's, and even if you don't love it like I do, it is still worth a try. 蔍ts just one of those LA places you owe it to yourself to check out at least once, for the food as well as the historical value. Other reviewers have already talked about the sandwiches, which I like, but it is really the spicy mustard that keeps me coming back. 蔙arely do I leave without purchasing another bottle to take home with me. 蔠ord to the newbies though, use with caution! 蔜heir apple pie is also scrumptious. 蔣et another item I always get to go since I stuff myself with my sandwich, sides, and lots of lemonade every time. �TIP: This place is always crowded, and sometimes it is crazy packed. 蔇on't be afraid of the lines for food, it is always quicker than it looks no matter how long the line is. 蔅ut I still always suggest doing the 50/50 for this place: 蔴alf of your party stays in line to order and carry food/ drinks, while the other half searches for a table. 蔉ood lines move fairly quickly but it is still hard to find a table at times, especially carrying all that food through the crowds. 蔜here are tables upstairs as well, so happy table hunting!

TYPE OF PLACE: Just a unique & fun place where you will see people dressed mostly very casual. 蔜o get your food, there are many lines you wait in to order your food and carry to your own table or to long tables where many people that you don't know sit - fun. 蔐ots of students from USC, area workers, and people who drive a long way to just to be in this fun place. 蔍f its very late we will drive there just because it has a fun atmosphere. FOOD: Sandwiches, stew, baked apples (good!), salads, beer, 蔱tc. that I give only a average rating �remember, go here for the fun atmosphere!). PRICES: Inexpensive--------------------and fun. PARKING: lots of it in their own parking lots that often have security people there - which feels real good.

Watch out for the Special Mustard! It is not hot, but does have an acquired kick to it. I won't take one star away from Philippe because the food is amazingly good and place is kept tidy. I must admit, it has the right price. We bought four french dipped sandwiches. Beef, lamb, pork and turkey sandwiches each. We were all delighted with the meat. It was soooo tender and tasty (minus the Special Mustard, so beware). Also, wife and I 蔴ad the potato salad and two bowls of chili. Wow, 蕋he chili was great. It is the best chili I have ever had. Pickled egg was good. Yes we over ate. The boys had chips with their sandwich that they didn't even finish since they were so full. For desert we had a baked apple, slice of pecan pie, and custard cup. We ordered 2 lemonades which were just perfect. They didn't have that after kick tarty taste. � iced teas, a Corona and a Coke Zero. All for $56 and some change. I love America!

Let me say right up front -- I would've gone to this place even if I wasn't promised six of some of the best red velvet cupcakes you ever tasted in exchange for a dip. 蔖hilippe is indeed the original, and as far as I am concerned, still the king. 蔛orry Cole's. �There is no nuance to ordering at this LA landmark -- you get a dip. 蔍 personally like that the roll is already *pre-soaked* in aus jus; saving you from having to deal with floaties. �Add the atomic mustard if you dare, but make sure you get a glass of $0.75 lemonade to go with your $5.55 french dip. 蔣ou can't beat that deal with a stick.

I've heard rave reviews about this place from friends and family, then I saw it on the Food Network so I finally decided to give it a try. I ordered the beef sandwich, double dipped.

Let me begin by warning sandwich snobs and stuck-up foodies with a little sound advice: This is not the place for you. Phillips The Original is a landmark in Los Angeles (a place known for bulldozing over landmarks to make room for high rises). The first thing you notice when you walk in is that before you can sit-down, you're going to need to stand in one of several lines to order and obtain your food. No table service here folks. I have only had the beef dip so I cannot speak to the number of other entrees and sides (including pickled pig's feet) that are served here. My advice is to stick with what this establishment is legendary for. Nearly every food show out there has done a spot about this place and it's a must-not-miss attraction for tourists who venture to Dodger Stadium, China Town or Alvera Street. The thick-sliced beef is generously heaped onto a delicious, chewy french roll and topped with your choice of cheese. If they left it right there, they'd still have a winner. But then they quickly "twice dip" the sandwich into a vat of oily, greasy, drippings from the cooking of the beef that just throws this baby off the charts. They have a great wine list and a beer for almost any taste. Be prepared to 蕎ait in line a long time during the lunch rush and if you come in a party of 2 or more, send a scout out to locate a (clean) table. There are many but they are always in short supply.

I've visited once... and truly, I probably should give this place another chance... but it is what it is... I had never heard of this joint. 蔍magine that? 蔍 grew up in LA... and this place just never hit my radar. 蔍 guess for us living in Westside, anything east of the 405 is just too far. 蔎ust kidding... I will travel for food. Anyhow, a couple friend of ours invited us to dinner one night and said that this was an institution in LA... been there for years... cheap and good. 蔄WESOME! 蔍 love dives! 蔍 love institutions! �I hated Philippe's. Maybe I'm too picky... but I have to say one of the best French Dip's is from Houston's. 蔄nd this place was no match. 蔄nd they don't even give you the au jus to dip... they do it for you! 蔠hat is that? 蔜hey should rename the place to Philippe's French Dip Nazi. So if you're expecting a good French Dip... go to Houston's... it's costs triple, but dude it's worth it. �As far as LA Institutions go... go to Johnnie's Pastrami in Culver City.... that's an institution that has a leg to stand on.

I came here during the Mid-Autumn Festival with my friend and he suggested to eat here. We walked from Chinatown and eventually got ourselves lost. Right when we were about to give up, we found Philippe! We got in and ordered our choice of food. I never had food here before and so I tried their Steak Sandwich with their iced lemonade and a cup of their custard pudding. Man, their French dipped sandwiches are amazing. I wish I found out about the double dipped sandwiches before I finished my food. You got to try their home-made mustard. I had a bit and I enjoyed it. My food came out to be a little less than $10.

I believe the dude from Man VS Food paid Philippe's a visit and that's what made Jesse D and I want to try it, but I was a little disappointed by the size of the sandwiches. Jesse D and I took my best friend Katy R here while she was in town from Moscow, Idaho. Katy and I had the beef french dip and Jesse D had the lamb. I liked the lamb better than the beef. Katy and I also got ours with cheese. She had American and I had swiss. While we were all chowing down Jesse D proclaimed "Well, this is a great snack! What are we having for dinner?"

Before i write my review... i want everyone to know that i travel the country in my profession and i have had some delicious sandwiches/grinders/cheese steaks etc... from here to Philadelphia and i must say that Philipe's makes one hell of sandwich! The beef sandwich (dipped once or twice in broth.. your choice) is my favorite with a side of potato salad, a pickle and glass of lemonade. I'm a simple man with an affinity for a (wonderful) simple meal... It is a perfectly placed right outside the hectic-ness of Downtown L.A., near the famed, "Olvera Street" and the prices are more then reasonable.

so i've been dreaming of eating at Phillipe's for over a year now and finally had my chance. we got lucky and went on a weekday so it wasn't that crowded and we got to order right away. Two beef double-dips with swiss cheese, potato salad, cole slaw and macaroni salad is what we got. for all that it was just a little over $20, which is very reasonable considering most touristy places love to overcharge customers. once we sat down with our food i went in for the big bite -- the sandwich was definitely good and tasty -- the only reason why i gave it 3 and not 4 stars is that the beef was very dry, which was disappointing. all the side dishes were delicious and the sandwich was outstanding once i added the cole slaw to make it more moist and flavorful -- that's an old trick i learned in New Orleans, cole slaw on sandwiches makes it all better :) so will i go back? YES! should everyone who loves french dips go? YES! despite the dry beef, it was very tasty :)

Hard to think of anything to say after 832 reviews, but here goes... Philippe's is awesome. 蔍t's an old, old, old-school place with fantastic food, extremely reasonable prices, and amazing atmosphere. 蔍t is especially wonderful when you hit it right before a game and the whole place is filled with Dodger blue. I think the important thing about eating here is knowing what to expect: The sandwiches are relatively small. 蔣ou cannot get your au jus on the side--the sandwiches are made pre-dipped, no exceptions. 蔣ou must pay cash. 蔣ou must order plenty of their scrumptious sides. 蔜his is not a place for great service--they expect you to order your sandwich and get the hell out of the way. I had a beef sandwich, no cheese on Monday and it was just a little piece of heaven. 蔜he beef was so tender and the au jus so flavorful that I wanted to weep a little bit. 蔍 added a gorgeous pink pickled egg and some macaroni salad on the side, and I can say with no reservations that it is the best macaroni salad I have ever had. 蔜he pie wasn't anything spectacular, but it was good, solid pie and I was satisfied. And don't you dare leave without picking up a jar of mustard...for $3.75 it is an amazing bargain, and it will clear your sinuses right up. Philippe's = Happy Place in my book.

4 Stars. For several years, I noticed this place on Yelp and said to myself, "Um why is a French Dip place getting such great reviews, the sandwich isn't even that good". Until that is, I saw an Episode of "Man vs. Food" in which they featured and explained the heritage and history behind Philippe's, therefore making me feel like my first impression was completely snotty. So I headed on up the 110 today with my usual cursing at traffic and Iphone in hand telling me to take the most backassward route when finally I arrive. Big parking lot, corner location and a GIGANTIC street sign makes sure than not only will you not miss the place but, have a spot to park in the oh so crowded DTLA area. The prices are decent, the sandwiches are all very tasty and there is more seating in the place than who knows what to do with. The location can be kind of a drag depending on where you're coming from and I can see how this place come a Saturday or Sunday is most likely FLOODED with out of towners but meh, just treat it as you would Pink's, go on a weekday around 2 o'clock ish and enjoy no lines. :)

My order was simple - roast beef sandwich with jack cheese [Was the cheese necessary? Probably not, but it was still delicious] and a side of cole slaw. The sandwich was so light and tasty that my fianc�and I considered ordering seconds. The cole slaw is probably the best I've ever had - it was so pure, both in flavor and ingredients. Dinner for 2 was around $15 - drinks included. Parking's ample. Seating's ample. Sawdust on the floor is ample. We'll be back Philippe's, again and again and again. And we promise to one day buy one of those cute bobbleheads!

Simple: Get lamb with swiss cheese dipped (you must ask to have your sandwich dipped b/c I thought they automatically dip it) is amazing!

I don't get the hype... this place isn't good at all. It doesn't compare to Adamson's in Sunnyvale (which is still my favorite French dip sandwich restaurant). I tried the beef French dip, 蕄otato salad (which had raving reviews) and apple pie. There was nothing there which was really that stellar. I didn't like the fact that there was a security guy at the parking lot, making sure we were really going inside the restaurant. It was a little before 5, my husband started getting in line and we didn't actually get our order till 5:30. They dip the bread into the dip (both sides) and by the time I bit into it, it was a bit too soggy for my liking. The beef tasted a bit hard and bland... even with the added hot mustard, I was disappointed to say the least. The potato salad was also mediocre, I would not be able to differentiate between that an Safeway potato salad. Ehh... (the inside of the place reminded me of jail, which I found to be quite amusing)

Oh my fuggin gosh. Lamb fuggin double dipped sandwich. Seriously the lamb literally falls apart as soon as it hits your mouth. So freaking good and flavorful. Best french dip sandwich I've had everrrrrr. Macaroni and potato salad are just that. Nothing fancy schmancy, just a side to the real show, but also necessary to complete the meal. Favorite part is how iced tea and lemonades are under a buck - transports you back to the good ole' days. OH and warning - be careful with their hot mustard. By hot they mean a kick in the back of your throat all the way up your nose haha. It's packed full of horseradish and punches you but perfect in small doses.

So I'm a total foodie, exploring to dine on different things, but when my BF and I finally arrived on a super dead weeknight (thank goodness!), after reading the restaurant in a few good online sites and watching Man v.

The double-dipped beef sandwich was juicy, yep, but what turned down my excitement was that it was too salty, and too salty can't satisfy both my tongue and my mind... Same goes for my BF's double-dipped pork version. 蔜he good news is that the hot mustard slightly alleviated the quality of my sandwich, and the potato salad is delectable, although it's heavily mayo-drenched to those who are concerned with that white matter. Hate to put feelings down but I overestimated Philippe's, and certainly I'm unlikely to return regardless of time, except if friends of mine are in the mood for it.

You can't beat an original!! The restaurant definitely gets busy during lunch and on weekends. Try situating yourself down a row closest to the cashier to get processed quicker. I've only ever had the beef and lamb double dipped sandwiches which were both fantastic. I highly recommend the mustard if you like spicy food, but be warned, it reacts to your nostrils the same way wasabi does! In through the nose, out through the mouth... Don't forget, they only take cash here so make sure you stop by the ATM in the back. Grab yourself a glass of lemonade and sit yourself down for a simple but delicious meal!

I had the double-dipped beef sandwich, and it was delicious! I was afraid that the beef would be tough and chewy, but I was pleasantly surprised to find that the beef was really tender. I tried the mustard, but it was faaaar too hot for my taste. I could literally feel the heat moving up my nasal 蔯avity, haha. But others beg to differ-- Philippe's is known for their mustard! I also got a slice of chocolate creme pie with a hot coffee. (and if I read correctly, the coffee costs 9 cents! AMAZING!) The pie was good, and my friend said it was like "chocolate milk in pie form!" and the coffee was definitely decent for its price. The only real thing I can complain about is the line. But being such a popular hot spot in Los Angeles, how can you expect there to NOT be a long line? Luckily, if you're buying stuff aside from sandwiches, you can head over to the very right and step up to the counter and order your pie/coffee/lemonade/salad, etc. Saves a lot of time! I am definitely planning to come back!

I swear I wrote a review for this place, but I'm told I need to write one so I'll do it. The first time I came here was during the Red Bull Soap Box Derby in 2009 or 2010 (I don't remember). We walked in and back out because we were starving and the lines were huge. BIG MISTAKE!!! A friend and I stopped by before hitting up LACMA for the day and fell in love. I took a friend's advice and got the french dip (double dipped) with cole slaw and mac salad on the side with iced tea. We sat the the long tables in front and anxiously awaited our food, wondering this time where the crowds were. When our food came, we dove in like vultures with hot mustard flying everywhere. The sandwich was simply amazing. No frills here, just meat and bread double dipped in au jus. Accented with some of their famous hot (and yes, this one has a kick) mustard, you're lost in it's simplicity as you find your own Shangri-La. The mac salad was just as good as I had hoped, I knew a place like this would do it right. It was light but so full of flavor! I'm not a cole slaw fan normally, but something told me that I had to order it. I'm definitely glad I did. It was so flavorful and crisp! A nice accent to the sandwich. The service was great, it really had that old-timey restaurant feel with the employees taking orders in a slightly short fashion backed with warmth and love. They steered us in the right direction and we were most than happy with our amazing lunch! The best part? Philippe's is pretty cheap!!!

I'm sorry to say, but this place is way over-rated. Or maybe my expectations were too high. I also saw this place on the Food Network and on the Travel Channel. When Anthony Bordain came to LA and went to Philippe's with the Derby Dolls, I decided that this is somewhere I really want to visit. The sandwiches looked good. I thought it was wierd that I had never heard of Philippe's until I saw them on TV. We headed over right after the Dodgers game and surprise surprise the lines were LONG! I think we waited about 20 minutes to order. We ordered the beef sandiwiches single dipped, a bowl of chili with beans, potato salad, and a baked apple. The sandwich was was really bland to me. The only flavor came from the au jus. Not worth the wait already... The chili was alright. Actually, I enjoyed the chili more than anything else we ordered. The baked apple was cold. I was expecting a warm baked apple but it was good. I didn't like the potato sald mainly because it had relish in it. Don't get me wrong, i like relish but not in potato salad. One bite and I was done with that. I wouldn't come back unless a few friends were persistant that they wanted to try it. Nothing to rave about.

Hey what a landmark and its been underneath my nose for all of my life which I could remember while living in LA. 蔄s a child I often came to Chinatown with my family on Sundays to do our grocery shopping. Hidden in the back of Chinatown, Phillipe's is truly a historic landmark which is evidence of what Los Angeles may have been like back then. 蔜he old school phone booths designed for Americans who were much smaller back in the day are a nice added touch. This place is very casual, its not very organized, and the food isn't impressive but sometimes simple is best. 蔍n terms of food quality I think 3 stars sums it up nicely, it's A-OK. The beef dip sandwich tasted as it should, the tapioca pudding tasted as it should, the potato salad as it should. 蔜he simple and cheap lemonade was a perfect way to top off the meal for me. 蔋onestly I don't always ask for much from my food. 蔖hillipe's is not a place I want to go back to often and hang out but like Chinatown its a great memory now. 蔍 can't go back to the good ole' days of Chinatown and neither can Phillipe's go back to the old kind of Los Angeles but its a great memory worth preserving.

We were in Hollywood to watch a taping and my Aunt said to me if I would mind going to Philippe's for lunch afterward. What's Philippe's, I asked? She looked at me as if I was from another planet. How could I be born and raised in the San Gabriel Valley and not know Philippe's?! I had the double dip beef dip, a pickle and macaroni salad. The beef dip is to die for and you have to try the special mustard sauce with it! I bought a bottle to take home with me, it's so good. Like clear your sinuses good! I tried a spoonful of the potato salad because they said it was so good. And I do not really like potato salad. But I like this one! Yummy! I can't wait to go again. And I hear they have good breakfasts also. I'm so a fan!

A must-do when you're in Los Angeles. Philippe's has been around forever and it hasn't missed a beat. 蔣ou've probably seen Philippe's profiled on various food and travel channel shows. 蔜he decor is a throwback to the 40s with wood shavings on the floor and cheap linoleum countertops and wood tables for self-service seating. 蔜he star of the show, naturally, is the food. 蔍 mean seriously good food and seriously cheap prices. Although beef French Dips are the classic, I encourage you to try the lamb. 蔕rder up a lamb double dip sandwich, and the lady behind the counter in a Mel's DIner waitress outfit will pull out a LEG OF LAMB and carve it right in front of you. 蔛he'll then dip both pieces of your bread in the wonderful tub of goodness that is the au jus sauce and ask you if you want cheese with that. 蔍 like my meat sandwiches in this place unadulterated, so I usually pass. 蔛he holds everything together with two toothpicks and then places your happy sandwich on a tray. �In addition to making mouth watering sandwiches, Philippe's also delivers on its sides. 蔜hey do amazing cole slaw and potato salad. 蔜heir desserts also don't disappoint. 蔜en bucks will get you a sandwich, a side and a dessert. 蔍 also opt for the giant dill pickle which is pickled to perfection. �Sometimes, when I'm really ravenous, I'll go back and order a second sandwich. 蔔ever order two sandwiches at once for yourself --- you want that second sandwich to be piping hot and fresh! There's an incredible line on the weekends but it moves fast, thanks to the dexerity and speed of those ladies behind the counter. 蔄lso a plus --- FREE parking in the back. 蔜hat's in a neighborhood that charges you $2.75 for each 15 minute increment of parking!

I'm really not a harsh critic and I know good food when I taste it (very open minded and knowledgeable of food). That being said, I don't understand the hype of this place. I came here expecting it to be delicious like evryone says. It wasn't horrible but i'd never come back here again. The sandwiches are bland. I tried the roast beef and lamb sandwich. The meat was really soft and tender but the bread had nothing special and the au jus had no flavor. To top it off, my only hope of adding flavor failed. The famous "hot" mustard has NO chili. I repeat NO chili. Yeah, that's not hot then. Instead the only thing ot did have was a ton of horseradish. I really don't see why people love this place so much. My husband and I joked after about how we would have been so much better off eating the LA street dogs....now that's flavor!

This place is like sandwich crack, you just keep coming back for more and are instantly addicted. �not that I know what it's like being on crack, but I have a good imagination and seen enough movies). 蔅reakfast seems really popular here but we always come for an early lunch on weekends and have never been disappointed with the dip sandwiches here. 蔍 like mine double dipped and you have to try their mustard that's at each table, it's the perfect spicy golden mustard. 蔭mazing, a little dab goes a LONG way so don't slather it on before tasting it. The only bad thing about this place is its popularity, esp when the Dodgers are playing that afternoon. 蔍t gets so crowded and you can't tell how long the line really is because there could only be 3 people in front of you but each one is ordering like 10 sandwiches to take to the Stadium. 蔍 think one time we waited over 30 minutes to get to the counter to order during one of these Dodger rushes. 蔛o now we check their calendar to make sure there's no home game the day we want to go down here. 蔣et another reason why I HATE BASEBALL SO MUCH

Absolutely LOVE Philippe's. I've been going here since I was a kid with my family any time we were going to China Town. The best French Dipped sandwiches, any other type just seems mediocre compared to this place. Saw dust, Cafeteria style this place is always packed, but you always have someplace to sit between Mr. Business man and Mr. seems-like-a-local-and-frequent of Philippe's. And since the rest of my family doesn't go out to LA that much anymore, I'm always bringing Dad home at least two jars of the Famous nose clearing Mustard. I always get beef sandwiches sometimes double dipped with a side of Potato salad and of course a pickle. Man, my mouth just waters thinking about it. Then if I'm with someone we always order a few Lemonades since they're cheap and small just like the coffee. I've been dying to get back out there sometime soon but maybe I'll wait a little more into Fall season so I can finally try their Baked Apples. Grr.. Writing reviews about amazing food places while I haven't eaten lunch or dinner is killing me - - especially all the great LA places I love.

Hell, even Wolfgang Puck said on Best Thing I Ever Ate, this is is favorite cheap eat. And it's mine too. Everything is so rustic and old school it's awesome There's a telephone booth and the woodchips on the floor, and everything is made out of wood. etc. The sandwiches are obviously fantastic. Sandwich dipped in the au jus. The beef is so tender and amazing with the horseradish mustard that complements it so well. Tip: they sell mustard in jars you can buy for home use. Coffee is super cheap and everything is just perfect. It's been doing things right for a long time, and shows no signs of slowing down.

I have been going to Philippes for 25 years and it has always been my "go to" spot for the best beef dip sandwiches anywhere. So here's the scoop...these sandwiches are deceptively simple. First time visitors often ask what's the big deal about this place. Let me tell you the big deal is this; they use the perfect bread, the perfect meat, the perfect au jus and the perfect mustard condiment to slather on as you wish. All this equals a very simple basic yet delicious sandwich, that, once you've eaten, will haunt you. The coleslaw is great, and by golly the pickled pigs feet ain't bad either!!

I resolved to finally try this joint after watching Wolfgang Puck say it was one of his favorite things on a food channel show. I've been in the Chinatown region numerous times and had never stopped by. I got the opportunity when I went to pick up the gf from her work before heading up to Bakersfield on a Friday night. 蔅y the way, it was friggin' packed with 6-8 lines, each with at least 7 people waiting. 蔠ow. I decided to sample the beef sandwich and the pork sandwich, to go. 蔛o consider this my only hedge as I didn't eat it right away. I was not impressed. 蔍 liked the pork much better than the beef. 蔜he beef lacked both flavor and substance. 蔜he texture was almost non-existent. 蔜he pork had better texture, but at the cost of being drier.

It's the place to go right before a Dodger game...I love it! It get pretty crowded before a game but I think it adds to the fun. Just hope that the people in front of you aren't ordering a crapload of sandwiches and the line will move pretty quickly. They make everything right in front of you and I've had the luck of being behind people who decided to order 20 sandwiches at once so you can imagine how long it can take. They have 5 different meats and I believe 4 or 5 cheeses to choose from. Prices vary depending on the type of meat ($6-$7.50) and cheese costs extra (40-60 cents depending on type). You can get the sandwich single or double dipped (double dipped is great). They also have a variety of sides you can order with your sandwich (macaroni salad, potato salad, coleslaw, sliced pickles etc). I have to say everything just goes so well together. Tasty, not too expensive, and you leave there happy and comfortably full. They have a bunch of other stuff as well (desserts, soup, salad etc). I've only had their sandwiches, but I hear everything else is pretty good as well. Don't forget to order their lemonade or iced tea! Small glasses for just 75 cents. No refills but enough to quench your thirst! Parking is very convenient - they have their own lot! A huge plus given how parking in LA always sucks.

This 蕄lace is quite simply an institution. I prefer the lamb french dip but all the meats are good. it's one of those rare places, and getting rarer, where you can fnid the young and the old, the hip and the staid, the happy and the sad, all bonded together over food, glorious food and coffee that's only 9 count 'em 9 cents. Is it: Out-of-this-world good? Cutting edge culinary exploration? Decorated in cool blues with a groovy beat and a trendy ambiance? No, to all three. It is a working man's diner, a hold over from times when food was just food and not an excuse for status enhancement. 蔊ood honest food with prices that are the same. A cautionary tale: 蔄 friend of mine carved his and his girlfriend's name into one of the picnic style tables upstairs. Years later he went there with his wife - a different woman. To his chagrin, she insisted on sitting upstairs... He worried the whole time that she would discover the carved memorial. Luckily she never did.

I am in love with this restaurant. Thank goodness for YELPERS because I wouldn't have known about this place... Coming from the bay area, I wanted to eat somewhere well-known in LA.. and I came about it because of YELP. One tip that helped me: there are several lines! Not just one. So if you see a short line in between the tables, go for it! I tried the lamb sandwich and it was truly an explosion of flavor. I hate mustard but this spicy mustard was damn good. Made me feel a big jolt to the nose! The banana cream pie was heaven sent!!!! The consistency of the banana filling was light (and not so custard like!) I loved it and they put big chucks of banana in it!! The atmosphere was also pretty damn cool because you know everyone is having a grand ol' time with those grand ol' sandwiches.

The food wasn't to die for but it was good. You really must come here more for the experience....

People of all colors and backgrounds come here alike. 蔣ou 蔭lmost feel like you're traveling through time 蕋o LA's old days. I liked what one article on their wall said which was that blue and white collar people are all equal and the same when they step into Philippe's as hungry patrons. I like the no fuss way of lining up & ordering your food from the counter. 蔜he food is pretty straightforward just as the ladies behind the counters are.

For the 'original' French Dip sandwich, they seemed pretty stingy with the dipping, but maybe we didn't order correctly. 蔅ut the roll was soft and flavorful, and the beef was wonderfully moist & tender. Be warned - the basic chili is a grease pit. 蔍 couldn't eat more than about 1/2 of a cup before being revolted by the orange sheen. The place is large, mostly picnic-style seating, and has sawdust scattered about the floor which is fun. 蔍t's rustic, old-school, and pretty cheap.

The original french dip, and the best. Simply delicious. I've come here as a small kid and I'll continue to eat here forever. I always get a beef dip with beef stew and an iced tea. The iced tea is cheap, but also very small, so you might want to get 2 or 3 if you are thirsty. It's the perfect place to get a quick bite to eat in downtown unless you go in during the lunch or dinner rush hour. It's also a good place to grab a bite before the Dodgers game.

I really dig this place. It's a no nonesense establishment that's been in LA forever. There are two free parking lots nearby (gottaluv free parking). And the sandwiches are delicious! I've never had a french dip sandwich before, but the meat was fresh and the mustard really clears your sinuses. Whooooa! The relaxed vibe and the ladies behind the counter though are fantastic. You go up to the counter to order. I love how it's old school. My boy was shocked that all he had to do was take me to a place like this to make me happy. Maybe I ain't into all that fancy shiiiiite after all, because on a saturday afternoon this place really made my day for lunch. We got the turkey and beef sandwiches, macoroni salad, and pickles. Mmm pickles. The sandwiches are medium-sized. I was still hungry after one, but then, I loooove food. And there's sawdust something on the floor, whatever is up with that...I don't know. All I do know is that the place was packed. Reasonable prices. Each sandwich is around 5 dollars and change. I'm definitely going back. Yum!

i finally ate here. It was good. Look, with 660 other reviews, you should just do it if you've never been or are hungry and are contemplating coming here. Its one of those "LA institutions". There were more tourists the night I went so you know its pretty well known. Had the double-dipped beef and had bites of the pork, turkey and ham. They were good but Beef rules. That mustard will burn your face until your eyes flow over with a river of tears. Best restaurant potato salad ive had to date. Cheap Ice Tea and Beer is a huge, huge plus. The pickled eggs were ok, but i figured out i ordered it just because it was so vibrantly purple. (I took a class on color theory, the draw was in the color.) Service couldve been a little better in terms of speed and genuine "niceness" but all in all, not bad. You'll find all sorts of freaks and people here...business people, high school kids, tourists, college students, wannabe gangsters, potentially real gangsters, the old, the fat, skinny, probably homeless, black, white, ashy larry...yeah, a little bit of everyone. Oh and the dining room is old and huge but the parking lot is not. A little something for everyone here. If you had a bad time, something's wrong with you and not with Philippe's. Yeah, I said it like that.

We decided to try Philippe's after about a million people telling us we needed to come here for sandwiches. I got the beef sandwich, and it was delicious! I, however, HATE au jus put on my sand which for me. I cannot stand soggy bread. It disgusts me. The counter person was rude. I asked her what kind of pies they had and she ignored me. I saw my friend ordered a slice, and I assumed it was blackberry, so I asked my counter person if I could have some blackberry pie, and she looked at me as if I stepped off of my alien spaceship. She said, "I don't have it." I said, "Fine. Cherry." And she just rang me up, demanded my money and slapped my food at me. I was not in the mood for rude service. Oh, how I was not in the mood. But the rest of the joint more than made up for her fugly face, so I have to give them four stars.

What is there to say about Philippe's, but mmmmm, mmm good. The original beef dip with a side of slaw and an iced tea sitting upstairs looking out the window enjoying a simple sandwich watching droves of people walking to and from Philippe's thinking, why has it been years since I've been back here. The Beef dip was as good as I remembered and the slaw was good with that sweet taste that I like in a slaw. the iced tea is unsweetened, as I don't need anymore sugary sweetness. The crowd was crazy, with the lines long but fast. The parking lots were packed and had to make two passes until I got lucky waiting for an older couple who were nice to point to there car for me to maneuver my truck in such a small lot/space. A great lunch, but wished I had more time to enjoy more of their offerings like the desserts.

Much like an establishment such as Pinks, this place is one of the "you gotta go just for the experience" type of places. 蔍t's a unique atmosphere inside, especially when it's crowded, like when my brother and I went. 蔜he crowd ran the gamut of tourists, nearly homeless people, trashy people, and old people. 蔍 walked in and saw an old man with tubes up his nose eating his sandwich. Anyways, the day we came was apparently the same day some stupid walk-a-thon or marathon or whatever the hell you want to call it was being held, so it was REALLY crowded. 蔐ike, 6 lines leading all the way to the back of the room crowded. 蔜he register system is completely and utterly ass backwards, since you walked up, order, hand them CASH ONLY, and they have to walk the money all the way over to what appears to be only one cash register for the six or so lines (there is a separate line and register if you are getting "miscellaneous items," such as slices of pie, just drinks, etc) so what ends up happening is you stand at the front of the line waiting for your change and your food while the rest of the line stares at the back of your head. Anyways, the food is good, but the portions are small. 蔣ou get the beef sandwich, dipped, as that is what you are supposed to do... if you don't, well, you're an idiot. 蔜he sandwich itself is $5.55 (for the beef and the pork and I believe the turkey, lamb sandwich is more) and it is about six inches long, maybe even a little shorter. 蔜hankfully the sandwich is really filling, despite how small it is, though it still can be relatively easy to eat two of them. 蔕n each of the cafeteria style benches you eat at (there are wooden booths as well, but again... you're here for the "experience") there are squeezable bottles of their famous mustard, which is really, really good. 蔄s the sign says, "Hot, but good!" Four stars for the portions being a bit too small and the drive being a hassle.

Growing up, I frequented Downtown & Chinatown almost every week due to my mom's need to bring me to work & have lunch in Chinatown. 蔍 remember always passing by Philippe's, but I never really paid attention to what it was up until recently when I saw it on Travel Channel's Chowdown Countdown & Man Vs. Food. I had the Beef Dip with a side of potato salad & a lemonade. 蔛ingle dip was good enough for me. 蔍t all came out pretty cheap... $5.75 for the Beef Dip, $1.15 for the potato salad & $.75 for a cup of lemonade! Never can go wrong with a meal under $10. Make sure to leave tip for your sandwich lady! Overall, the food was pretty good, but nothing too special stood out to me besides the cheap prices. Seating is found on your own & there's plenty of seats upstairs. 蔍t just might feel like a cafeteria since you're eating your food on a soggy old tray & all the rooms are drab with nothing on the walls but coat hooks & there's no music or anything. Oh & it's CASH ONLY. But don't worry, they have an atm inside.

Parking: They have two parking lots, one located next to the restaurant and the other one is across the street from it. It was very easy to find parking. Area: The restaurant seemed a little out of place since it was located in the heart of chinatown. Decor/ambiance: The place has an old feel to it. The food is served cafeteria style with a blast from past feel, the chest-high wooden tables is communal and their water dispenser is very classic and probably has been changed since it was first built. The place was a little crowded but it only took less than 10 minutes to get our food. Foodies: 1. beef french dip sandwich ($5.75 + $0.60 for cheese) Even though the beef french dip is the popular choice here, we found it to be just a little above average. It's definitely a good price compare to our OC restaurants like lawry's carvery. i wish i would known that you can get your sandwich double dipped in their gravy sauce, I felt that the sandwich need that extra juice. 2. pork french dip sandwich ($5.75) My boyfriend is a big fan of pork and we must say this is probably the best pork meat we've had. The little bites of pork fat and the savory pork flavor made it stand out more than the beef sandwich. The meat wasn't too salty, which was a good thing, and the lightly textured french roll just fell apart in your mouth. You should give this pork french dip sandwich a try because its definitely worth the 4 stars. Service: The service is just standard since it was served cafeteria style.

Philippe's is the original. This was one of the stops I was excited to visit during EDC weekend. One of my best friends took me here and I had the privilege to be here right before a Dodgers game. Fans were lined up for their famous double-dip beef w/ swiss an hour before a game. 蔍 knew I was in LA when the restaurant was filled with people in "white and blue". I had high expectations coming in...and all those expectations were met. I enjoyed the vintage decor, the friendly staff, the large family size tables, and the of course the sandwiches! I ordered the double-dip beef w/ swiss (recommended by my friend). The meat was tender, the bread was lightly toasted w/ a slight crunch but matches the tenderness of the beef. It literally MELTS in your mouth! �Before trying the sandwich, I had the nerves to compare Philippe's with the franchise BuckHorn from the Bay...There is no comparison. Buckhorn is like the big mac to authentic all beef burgers next to Philippe's. So if you're one of those people who enjoy Buck Horn, you will fall in love with Philippe's. If I lived in LA, I can see myself coming here on a regular basis. Thank you Philippe's for a great time!

So, I've been coming here since before I can remember, being a native Angeleno and all. I still love it. I respect that they have stayed true to who and what they have always been in a city that has not. I love that their food is simple, but deliciously prepared with the best ingredients. I recommend the beef dip (double dipped), potato salad and pickle spears...and a can of coke. Simplicity at its best!

Disappointing. 蔕ver-rated. 蔕ver-priced. 蔛mall portions. 蔛low service. 蔅land food. So I seen the spot on Food Network about how great this Philippe institution is and immediately I had to go and try it out. 蔄fterall, it's an alleged L.A. Institution that really satisfies the most discerning 蕄alate/appetite. 蔕h it looked so good and lured my man and I towards downtown L.A. within a few days. We get there, parking is scarce, so we park across the street, lines inside are long, tables are crowded with what seemed like an equal part of tourists and regulars alike. Finally, our turn comes to order the famous "French Double Dip" sandwich, I go for the roast beef double dip, my honey gets the same...except when our order arrives we think it's just bread as we can not see where the meat is until we open up the sandwich. Although we asked for the double dip, our sandwich was dry, small portioned and everything was a la cart. 蔛uch a disappointment and waste of gas/time/money. 蔠hen we went to sit down, the "dining" area resembled a jail-house facility with concrete and those hard, metal chairs. 蔛o much for an L.A. Institution....hmmmm. I suppose everything looks bigger on T.V., either that or for the show they included extra meat in their sandwiches, because we did not get what we saw on the tube. Will not be going back there even if I were starving!

OVERRATED!!!! Bored off our ass's and hungry on a Sunday afternoon we took a little trip to Philippe. Luckily it wasn't a long line out the door as we were told. I walked in, wearing my new Yelp shirt might I add. We looked for the hostess to seat us, except there was no hostess, only a big freakin room with lots of tables and a line over by the deli counter. It reminded me of my high school days of hitting the cafeteria during lunch hour. The menus simple and easy. Not too many choices but that's the way they kept it for so many years. We both ordered the beef dip, potato salad and a lemonade which is only $0.60. We thought it was typo! They make the sandmiches right in front of you. The french dip was not too bad and not too good. The meat was dry in certain spots . My friend 蔳ot some dry, tasty spots with mounds of fat. The salads were pretty tasty along with the lemonade. I can see why this place is still in business after so many years. PS: Do you notice that Philippe's employees not only make your sandwich, but they don't wear gloves and handle your dirty money at the same time? Health violation anyone? EWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWW!

Not much to add here, but wanted to add my 2 cents. Last night was my first visit to Philippe's and I was impressed. �The French Dip was very good. 蔜he beef was amazing. �But what impressed me more was their wine list --- Hey, I was expecting a lot after everything I have heard/read about the sandwiches. 蔜hey had some very good wines on it . 蔍 don't know how their pours are (I know, me pass up wine, but after traveling all day .... ) but their prices were reasonable.

Definitely one of the better French Dips I've had. The meat was super tender, the bread was nice and fresh, and the dip itself was great. I only wish I had gotten the double dip, but I definitely don't fault them for my not asking for that. The mustard they have at the table is...wow. I LOVED it. Delicious in itself and a great compliment to the sandwich. I also loved the way it's run. Order at the counter and get your food in a minute. Very quick and efficient. The only thing that keeps them from getting that 5th star is the fact that I thought it was a bit pricey for its size. As delicious as I thought it was, $5.50 for a sandwich that small is just a bit on the pricey side since it'll probably cost me $11 to actually fill up there.

How does one describe Phillippe The Original? A famous landmark...it's organized, it's clean...it's the ultimate LA 1920-30ish diner experience. One could almost expect to see Spencer Tracy sitting in one of the wooden telephone booths, betting on a fight. Oh yeah, the food was good and so was the price. So glad they keep it reasonable. I went with a friend from Australia, ( they don't eat pies in Australia?) she had never had pie. We both had a slice of the Banana Cream Pie which was about the size of our heads-too good for words. This place is a must! (For some reason I really liked the saw dust that covers the entire floor.) The best part was that they had Hockey on TV...oh yeah!!

Fan-tab-u-lous! 蔍 have been going here since I was a child. 蔒y parents have been going since they met over 40 years ago, and my mother used to go after church when she was a kid. 蔜his place is a veritable LA institution and you can't find a better French dip sandwich. 蔜his is the *original* - accept no imitatiors. My recommendation - the beef dip, a side of cole slaw (some of the best I have ever had, it has a really "fresh" quality), a side of pickles and peppers, and something cold to wash it all down. 蔅e sure to use the (rather) spicy house mustard which is conveniently located on all tables.

It's been a good - oh, I'd say - ten years since I last ate at this classic joint. 蔄t that time I didn't afford myself the honor of munching on a 蔲rench-dip RB sangwich, so this place went unacknowledged by my potent palate for the decade. 蔛ince moving back to the home base, I told myself I was going to go, and this time give all my effort into throwing the french-dip down my gullet. One word: satisfying. It was tasty in it's simplicity. 蔅read, cheese, meat, bread. Then dip. 蔠hat keeps me from plopping a 5-er down is the long line(they can't help that) and the non-fixings of the sangwich. 蔋owever, they do have a grip of side dishes, and I hear they are quite good accompaniments. 蔅ut the sandwich was the headliner, and what made it so was the juicy slices of lamb. 蔒ost patrons don't steer away from the classic RB, but I tell you, the lamb kills. Slays. Assassinates. Nukes. 蔊oddamn asteroids the alternatives. So a 4 star it deserves based on the lamb itself. 蔜hat, and the fact that they have Fat Tire on draft.

This place claims to have invented the French Dip. 蔠hether or not that's true is irrelevant, as the quality of said sandwiches is excellent. 蔜he way they serve them here, the sandwiches are pre-dipped in the au jus, instead of having a cup of it for dipping. 蔜he sandwiches aren't that big and one alone is not quite enough for a full meal for those with hearty appetites. 蔇efinitely check this place out though.

Now that I've finally had a taste of Philippe's, I can admit with some shame that it took me this long to do it. 蔜he restaurant is one of the oldest in L.A., pre-dating my family's entrance to America by around sixty years. 蔍 was born in 1986, in Van Nuys. 蔒y first meal at Philippe's took place on April 30, 2011. I liked the place. 蔍t was big and casual and welcoming in an offhand way, and it had the definite air of an institution. 蔜he menu was posted high and proud, a surprisingly extensive thing that boiled down to sandwiches and sides. 蔍 went for dinner on a Saturday, and there was a substantial crowd. 蔒att B. said it was much more manageable than the lunch crowd, but we waited for a while in one of several deep lines. 蔕nce we got to the front, though, we were able to order quickly. 蔄 few minutes later, we were taking trays of food to an empty table on the main floor. The food was delicious. 蔍 wasn't expecting much after the sad sandwich I had at Cole's, but as it turns out there is no real competition between Cole's and Philippe's when it comes to plain old tastiness. 蔒y friend and I shared a beef dip with American and a lamb dip with blue cheese, both double dipped, and this was the wise way to go. 蔜he beef was satisfying and went well with the melted yellow cheese. 蔍t was the classic choice, and I'd get it again. 蔄s good or better, though, was the lamb. 蔜his was gamey to the point of being pungent, the tender meat full of lamb flavor. 蔜he chunks of crumbly blue cheese were a great counterpoint. 蔅oth sandwiches benefited from some judicious squirts of that delightful hot mustard. 蔜he soft sandwich bread was great, and I think I will continue to order the double dip for the juiciness and abundance of drippy meat flavor. 蔍 liked that the bread got nice and moist without becoming so soggy it fell apart. 蔍 ordered a pickle to eat with my sandwiches, which I recommend, as well as a decent macaroni salad with plenty of mayo and celery. I was surprised that Philippe's even had good pie. 蔜he banana cream may not measure up to the Apple Pan's, but it was much better than I'd expected. 蔍t was very sweet and could have used more real banana, but it was tasty. 蔜he apple pie was - since I'm using this as my yardstick now - better than Apple Pan's, with a great flaky crust and tooth-tender apples in the filling. I'll confess that I half expected to visit Philippe's, check the box, and never return. 蔍conic restaurants don't have to be all that good to stay in business, and I thought that Philippe's might be a worthwhile L.A. experience with mediocre food. 蔍 won't lie - it isn't Langer's, and I won't be dreaming of French dips at night. 蔅ut Philippe's deliver a good meal at a fair price, and I see the value of keeping it around for a hundred years to come.

Note to self: if walking to Philippe's from Dodger Stadium after a day game, don't do so without wearing actual shoes (not sandals) and sunscreen. Me and my friend Mark held out for a full 9 innings without eating so as to get something much more affordable and tasty later. Plus we needed to sober up a bit, so we walked. With my trusty iPhone navigating us and pinpointing wherever we were, we crossed over a freeway, up and down some hills, and finally saw Philippe's up ahead. Not even that bad of a walk... maybe 2 miles. People seemed to be appalled when they learned that we walked there. Not sure if it should be done at night though - some sketchy alleys here and there with broken glass etc. We came, we ate, we conquered. So good it made me forget all about my blisters and sunburn. I really gotta start coming here more often!

So, yes I realize that there are 278 (make that 281 by the time I finish writing) reviews already, but I had to write a review just to tell you about the weirdest thing I've ever seen, in my life, right here at Phillipe's. It was the first time I had ever been here, even though I lived at USC for 3.5 years and in the L.A. area for the last 6. 蔅ut I had never even heard of Phillipe's until a few months ago. 蔛o I had to try it, it's an L.A. tradition, it's French Dip, blah blah blah -- ok, let's go! So we're standing in line, I'm experiencing old-timey L.A., these older gentlemen in power blue suits and fedoras and with handkerchiefs in their jacket pockets are standing around bamboozling each other, and I'm just taking it all in. 蔠e order, I remark that I wished the sandwiches were bigger, and sit down to eat our food. AWESOME!!! 蔜his food is good!! 蔄nd good for the price too, usually I get disillusioned by "L.A. traditions" that either get pretentious or totally talked up. 蔅ut this place is just good. 蔜heir potato salad is bombtastic, too. 蔛o I'm loving it, plus they've got a Suns-Spurs game on, and I'm just seriously enjoying everything. Then my boyfriend says, quietly, "Hey could we just finish up and go? 蔇on't make a big deal or anything and I'll explain later." I'm totally confused, and about to look around and investigate when he says "No, no don't move your head. 蔇on't turn around." So I'm DYING of curiosity, trying to eat my banana cream pie as quickly as possible so I can see what he's referring to. �Banana cream pie with entire chunks of bananas, btw). 蔜hen suddenly the couple next to us abruptly gets up, just moments after I had heard the husband say "Let's stay and watch the game for a while." 蔜hey get up and have to look for an alternate exit so they don't have to walk past whatever is behind me. I'm so curious!!!! 蔠hat is it??? �So I can't even finish my pie, I just say I'm done so that I can see it. So my boyfriend bolts up from his chair, gathers all our stuff and is grabbing me by my arm. 蔄s I turn around I see this morbidly obese man, in a wheelchair, sitting at the table behind me. And he has no nose. ............ ....................... It's gone!!!! 蔋e has about 50 plates of Phillipe's French Dip sandwiches in front of him, a surgical mask lifted off his face and resting on his forehead, exposing his mouth so that he can eat. 蔄nd also exposing what was so disgusting to my boyfriend and the couple next to us: he has no nose and instead a flap of skin pinned up near his eyes, and two big black bloodied holes where his nostrils are. It was the most frightening thing ever! 蔒y poor boyfriend, had to see this as he was trying the banana cream pie and literally had to stop eating because he didn't know what to do with himself when he saw this. 蔋e said his stomach almost came up, and that he will probably have nightmares about it. 蔔o nose!! And then we went to go see the Body Worlds exhibit. 蔋ahahahahahahaha! �http://www.bodyworlds.co� Other than that, Phillipe's is a rockin' L.A. establishment that has not skyrocketed its prices due to its famous success, and retains flavor in food and personality in atmosphere.

I enjoyed my lunch at Philippe's and it was good but not the best French Dip sandwich I've had. What I like about this restaurant is the history and how fans will flock from all over to enjoy the food and old-school ambiance. I'll return and gladly bring out-of-town guests to share in this LA experience.

With visions of Felipe's dancing in my head, 蔍 waited and waited until I would be next. 蔠hen low and behold what do I see? 蔄 perfect french dip sitting before me. This is a LA institution. 蔍n my opinion, a trip to a Dodger game isn't complete without making a stop at Felipe's first. 蔍 always love the "double dipped" beef with jack cheese. �The macaroni salad is awesome too and you cannot get a sammie without the peppers. �If you dare go for the spicy mustard. 蔍t has a ton of horseradish in it. �Be prepared to wait when you go especially if there is a Dodger game. 蔅ut the amount of food, friendliness of the staff and the honor of eating where the french dip was created is well worth it. �PS. 蔆ash only.

#37 I had never eaten at Philippe's before Saturday, despite spending the first 21.5 years of my life in LA. Only after I moved away from home did I finally visit the restaurant that allegedly invented the French Dip Sandwich. When you think about how long this place has been around, it's amazing. Imagine all the historical events that elapsed: World War I, the Depression, World War II, just to name a few. I wonder how many other restaurants can say they've been in operation for over 100 years. When we first walked in, I was overwhelmed by the number of people waiting in line to order. However, the line subsequently breaks up into several smaller lines that lead to individual cashiers. All things considered, the wait was not too long, but don't expect to walk in and go straight to the counter. I opted for the Beef Dip Sandwich ($5.55). I requested double-dip and Jack cheese ($0.40). Add on a lemonade for $0.75 and a slice of NY Style Cheesecake ($2.75) and we have ourselves a meal. I can honestly say that the sandwich was not the best I have had. However, I'm willing to give them the benefit of the doubt because the meat wasn't very warm when I started eating. Although I think they bring in their pies (cheesecake?) from a outside bakery, the cheesecake was excellent. I much prefer it to most plain cheesecake I have eaten elsewhere. I certainly think Philippe's is a great value and will definitely return. I hear the Lamb Dip Sandwich is a hit, so that will be on my list for next time.

If you don't like this place, you're not my friend. This place is stuff legends are made out of. I truly believe that no trip to LA is complete without a trip to this historical landmark. Philippe's makes a mean french dip. Forget going anywhere else, folks because any other french dip ain't got nothing on Philippe's. Their au jus is one of a kind. You stand in these lines to be greeted by the sweetest women you willl ever meet. You have a choice of lamb, ham, beef, chicken or turkey dips. Be sure to get them double dipped with extra au jus. Along with sandwiches, there are the most wonderful salads you could have. You can get potato, green, macaroni, etc. salad. They also serve hearty breakfasts if you're up early enough. Indulge in their freshly prepared eggies and toast. Philippe's has everything you could ask for in an old time cafetria atmosphere. I love you Philippe's and I desire to make beautiful eating with you again soon. Dip it!

I think the expression "less is more" was first uttered at Philippe's. �I won't go on and on about the food- a place with this many reviews doesn't require it. 蔅ut I will say everything they do, is straightforward and simple, yet, still incredible. I live in San Diego, but had been here a few times after Dodger games. 蔠hen my wife and I were heading up to see a concert (Justin Timberlake, in case you were wondering) at the Staples Center, I told her I had a great idea for a dinner date. 蔍 am not sure if she was disappointed when we arrived, you know, because we had to order at the counter, there was saw dust on the floor, etc., but after ordering some sandwhiches a bunch of sides, and a bottle Silver Oak Cab for under $85, she was hyped.

So after seeing this place on the travel channel I thought hmmm... This could be good. Well to be honest and not trying to bash the place because there are some who like soggy stuff to eat like gold fish, pigs etc. So any way my question to those who praise this place is..... 1. Where's the beef? 2. Where's the flavor? I mean come on the meat has no friggin flavor what so ever, even the damn lamb had no flavor HOW!! So that's it I'm not going to go off and talk about how NY has the greatest meat blah blah blah I'm here now and looking for the world's greatest meat (don't get any nasty ideas) Oh and the frigging cole slaw yikes let's just say it's lettuce with sweet milk poured on it yuck. I just think this place is over hyped and under flavored.

I have very fond childhood memories of this place. My dad used to take me here when I was young. I always thought it was strange that this place was in Chinatown, but whatever. The French Dip sandwiches are da bomb .com (but you might need 2, if you're a big eater like myself). I recommend the beef or the lamb sandwich, you can't go wrong. Tip: Dip the hell out of your sandwich, it will make it that much better. Also, don't forget dessert! Phillipes has a bunch of delicious items to choose from for dessert. Phillipes is a historical LA spot, so I definitely recommend venturing off into Chinatown for this treat!

I don't understand why everyone loves this place so much. I got the beef dip, potato salad, and lemonade. The sandwich was okay -- nothing earth shattering. I mean, I don't know how you could possibly go wrong with something so simple. The potato salad was way too salty and barely had any potato in it. The lemonade was good, but I finished it in three gulps (then again, it was only 70 cents or something, so I can't really complain). I don't think I'll come back, if only because of the location. Driving downtown is a pain, and I rarely do it even for my favourite restaurants. Luckily, this place has a pretty big lot so parking isn't too bad, but if you're like me and hate navigating downtown LA's one-way streets, I wouldn't go out of my way to come here.

I was starving when I walked into Philippe's, and I was not disappointed. 蔍've heard a lot of talk about who invented the French Dip, and frankly I don't care who did because Philippe's does it great! 蔜he Beef Dip sandwich was fantastic. 蔜he Coleslaw and Potato Salad were very good as well. 蔜he lemonade is great (my girlfriend and I had 4 glasses between us). �The atmosphere is excellent as well. 蔞ery much an LA staple. �If you haven't been before, remember these things: 1) The line will be long, but it's worth the wait. 蔎ust be ready to deal with it. �) It's cash only, so don't get caught at the counter with a card. �Add this one to your LA bucket list, then promptly get it checked off. 蔖erhaps repeatedly.

After years of hearing how great this place was, I finally visited. �My friend and I met at LA Union Station across the street and walked over. 蔄t 11am, there was a 10 minute wait to order. I ordered the Beef Dipped sandwich, a cup of chilli and a lemonade, and my friend had a Beef Dipped sandwich, chips and a slice of Apple Pie. The sandwich was just "okay"..I thought it was dry, the beef nothing special....in fact, I preferred the chili. Like others have said, this is just another "overhyped" LA establishment. 蔍 know it is filled with City workers during the week, but really, what else is there in that area to eat during lunchtime? 蔒ost of the folks there on MLK day were out-of-town tourists who saw the place on a Food show. Honestly, walking through Olvera Street afterward I kind of wish I had ate some of that Mexican Food there instead.

So many great things already written about this place here on Yelp, I hate to be redundant. 蔅ut I've been eating here for many, many years and it's always good, always fun, and always a good value. 蔊reat sandwiches, wonderful and oddball old-school side dishes (pickled beets, anyone?), the best hot mustard in the city, a terrific, reasonably-priced wine list by the glass (go figure), and perhaps the most diverse, all-walks-of-life clientelle of any place in town. 蔛kip the Dodger dogs and eat here before the game. As a side note, I once took a research tour of the monolithic L.A. County Jail nearby (creepy as hell, even though I knew we would be to go at the end of the afternoon), and once it was done, I immediately rushed to Philippe's and scarfed down two sandwiches. I was so happy to be back in free space and non-recirculated air, I just wanted to immerse myself in something totally right with the world. 蔍t was the perfect antidote.

Like most everyone in LA, I have been eating here for more years than I can remember. Most of the ladies behind the counter have been here for eons. I always get the beef sandwich double dipped and sit in the train room. Their pies and cakes are awesome. My wife loves the cole slaw. Where else can you get a cup of joe for 10 cents! Avoid this place at lunch time (12-1) and before Dodger games unless you don't mind standing in line for awhile. I went there for lunch yesterday at 11:30 AM and there was only one person ahead of me in line.

Best French dip in the So Cal area. We usually order the "wet" beef french dip sandwich with coleslaw and pickles. The bread and meat are great, but the best part of the sandwich is probably their spicy brown mustard. 蔍t's DELICIOUS and not for the weak stomachs. 蔜oo much of this sauce, and your nose hairs will be burning and eyes tearing, but...it is damn good.

********** (ten stars) Yee-haw! 蔅etter than "As good as it gets!" As you can see by my past reviews, I am generous in my rating. 蔣ou pretty much have to sexually harass me to get a star knocked off (you hear me YMCA membership). 蔅ut, if I could give Philippe's 10 stars, I would. 蔍've come to this place since I was a child. 蔍t has the feeling of a depression era sandwich deli. 蔜he floor are covered in saw dust, and the seating is on stools alongside elongated tables. 蔜he women (mostly Latina now) behind the counter, where you order, look like they are playing the part in a 1930's movie, with their little dixie cup hats, and long shirt-dresses. 蔆offee was 5 cents a cup while I was growing up. 蔍 went to 10 cents, and now, I think it is only 9 cents. When they open the upstairs, there are rooms where you can sit, one of which has a red brick wall, in which my father carved my name and that of my sister, when we were babies. 蔕ur names have been obliterated by the subsequent memorializations of other names. Best French dipped sandwiches EVER! 蔜he hard boiled eggs on the counter are pickled in a juice turned red by beets. 蔇elish. This place should be a historic landmark of the City of Los Angeles.

I had the beef dip with a side of macaroni salad. And if I had known, I would have gotten it double dipped! It was classic, simple and delicious. Especially with that ridiculously spicy mustard they have! The space is great as well. I'm glad they haven't changed it.

Ever since we have found this place...again via Adam's list from "Man vs, Food" website...our stomachs and taste buds have been so happy. We found this place about a year and a half ago and our 1st impression was, "OH MY GOD...THOSE LINES!" We had arrived just after a Dodgers game, and for those who don't know...this place is in Chinatown and Chinatown is right next to Dodgers Stadium. After waiting in line for a few minutes, we then realized that they are a CASH ONLY place. Which is fine, but we didn't have any cash on us and had to leave and come another day. The second attempt at Phillipe's was fruitful. We ordered pork sandwiches and potato salad to go and took it home to enjoy. From the 1st bite in to the last bite out, our mouths were exploding with juicy yummy meat, au jus, and great tasting bread. Since then, we've tried all of the other meats: turkey, lamb, beef, and ham; but our favorite is still pork. We also learned to get it "double dipped", where they dip both the top and the bottom pieces of the bread in the au jus, and with added cheese as well, jack for me and swiss for my boyfriend. We have been back numerous times since and everything has been consistanly good. The potato salad is awesome, the desserts are so good (I've tried the coffee crumb cake, chocolate cake, and the lemon meringue pie), the soup is hot and wholesome, the beer is crisp, the lemonade is fresh, and the iced tea is actually pretty good. Overall, we go about once a month or so now and have never been dissappointed. The lines are almost always long but worth the wait in my book. They stay true to their roots and have good customer service. I would always recommend this place in a heartbeat.

Alright, so I saw this place on the Food Network and had to try it. 蔕ver the past year, I've been here 3-4 times (basically everytime I'm in LA), and each time it's the same good food. Food: gotta go with the french dip, lemonade, and your call on the type of dessert (but the cheesecake is okay). 蔜he french dip is what they're famous for, and it's pretty good. 蔍 guess there was too much hype around it, but I keep coming back so that should say something about it. Location / Decor: It's located near downtown LA and very close to an asian business district. 蔍nside the restaurant looks like an old skool diner where you order in front of glass similar to a cafeteria. If you're in the area and like french dip, it's worth a shot. 蔅ut I wouldn't travel more than 10-minutes out of my way to try this place.

With the exception of the grease-coated, bacon-wrapped, heart-attack-inducing lump of meat known as the LA Dog, I'm convinced that every other "You've gotta try it" touristy food place in LA is mostly hype. So when one of the faculty at my school recommended Philippe's because it's the unofficial birth place of roast beef french dip sandwiches, I was immediately suspicious. For such a simple sandwich to proliferate so much, it must either be really good or really hyped. Conclusion - better than I expected, but not by much. I basically doused a lot of mustard on my sandwich, which made it taste...mustardy, meaty, and bready...which I would say kinda defeats the purpose of putting it all together. Good cooking is about making the whole greater than the sum of its parts! Maybe I'm pushing it by judging a sandwich by "cooking" standards, but I'm pretty sure that if I'm ever in the area again, an artery-clogging vendor dog sounds like a more delicious meal than the meat and bread salad with mustard dressing that I had. Though....+1 star for serving apple pie. Any place with good apple pie is a winner in my book.

My family has been going to Philippe's for three generations now, taking their sandwiches to Huntington Beach, Dodger Stadium, Griffith Park and beyond. My parents would buy a dozen sandwiches and freeze them for whenever.. Get a sense of how much we like Philippe's now? I live in Oakland these days, but every trip I make to L.A. has to include a stop there. 蔍t's loaded with memories which probably go beyond the food experience, but parking in the parking lot(s), going down the stairs, seeing the long tables, sawdust floors, cold cases with frigid waitresses waiting to take your order and money, is the Philippe experience. Historically, as you can read in the clippings on the walls, Philippe's is a very old place, and the "French Dip" sandwich depends on long slow-cooked beef and pork as the foundation. 蔆risp, old-style French rolls round out the structure, add cheese (if you must) and the piece-de-resistance: Dip the bread in au-jus and your are done! 蔞oila! The meat is great, and quickly oozes into a mass that blends with the rapidly dissolving innards of the crisp roll which is being attacked by the au-jus gravy. 蔍n your hand, this whole thing is alive and disintegrating, kept together by the skin of resistence of the freshly baked French roll exterior - great stuff. Ordering is an experience in itself. You stand in line behind other customers, and pick a line with the least-intimidating server you can find (my method). 蔠hen you get to the head of the line, make sure you have your order ready - questions are not welcome (can you make it Vegan?). 蔜hen they get to work and your lunch (or breakfast, or dinner) is done. �The final test to master is paying: 蔣ou must put your money on the dark brown Bakelite tray - not in their hand, not on the stainless steel cooler top (I can smell the health department's involvement here). The accessories to the sandwich are equally good: 蔍 love the cole slaw and potato salads; I've never had a pickled egg but like looking at them; the actual pickled pickles are very good; coffee here is still cheap as are refills. The next task is navigating with your unworthy tray of goods to long tables which you share with other equally unworthy people sitting on stools. 蔅e aware of your surroundings here: 蔜he place is filthy with lawyers, judges and police. Really good, hot hot hot "Philippe's" mustard is on the table, and you gotta use it - lots. The best experience, however, is getting some sandwiches to go, or freeze them and eat them later. 蔜hen what you end up with, is the disintegrated result, which is delicious. 蔅y then the crisp outside shell structure has failed, leaving a congealed fatty pile of wonderfully flavored meat, sitting in a mushy beefy infused sourdough interior within an antique fossilized exterior shell - perfect for a Dodgers game. Philippe's almost makes it worth living in L.A. - which I don't anymore - and to me, Philippe's is L.A.

Oh Philipee how I love you so much !! This is as Los Angeles as you can get. If your near Chinatown, Olvera Street, or the Union Station, I highly, highly recommend this place. The French dip is what their known for. Ask for a single/double/triple dip, so the staff can dip the roast beef in the au jus for a little more flavor. The custards are very good, and the macaroni salad is not bad either. The service is very quick and efficient, although it can get very congested �in the restaurant during weekday lunch hours. The prices are very affordable, although the prices slowly creep up every few years or so. Either way, the sandwiches are well worth it !

I had been dying to eat at Phillippe's for a long while. Ever since I watched (my boyfriend) Anthony Bourdain consume a beef dip sandwich on "No Reservations". First glance: The lines were long. 蔜he customers were rowdy. All the ladies behind the counter looked like their 蕁ame should be "Flo". 蔋mmmm......not what I was expecting. But I stayed, my mouth watering while I stood patiently for my turn. I had the beef dip. It was really good. Not too soggy, not too dry. Mr. N had the lamb dip, which he gave 2 thumbs up. The mustard.......ohhhh man. That shit was good! I'm kicking myself in the butt for not buying 8 jars of it to bring home. It was like wasabi, but in mustard form. It made the sandwiches taste heavenly. The coleslaw was good, but a little bland. Ditto for the potato salad. The beer was cold and reasonably priced.

Okay, I'm a Philippe hater. �Me thinks Philippe is not all that. 蔔ow, now, don't get your panties all up in a bunch. 蔍'm entitled to my own opinion and honestly, the sandwiches just didn't live up to the expectations for me. 蔖hilippe is overrated. Do come to experience it and if you like, then come back. 蔅ut if you're like me, go to Eastside Deli for a #7. 蔍 promise you will never regret it 蔭nd you can thank me for it. �Philippe does have an interestingly pickled pink (or purple?) egg that you have to try. 蔕h yeah, not to mention, they have Balian ice cream. 蔜otal nostalgia for me...the last time I had those were in elementary when I was wee small. �I'd give it only two stars but one more star for all the times they hooked me up with those lamb leg bones that my dogs and neighborhood dogs loved oh so much.

These Sinuses are ALL CLEAR! Wow!, that bottled mustard sauce KICKED me in the nose like I owed it BIG money...and I loved it! I was doing everything I could to play off the tears welling up in my eyes from the mustard's wasabi effect...I was repeating an inner-plea "Men Don't Cry!..." 蔅ut, I tell you, I was as close as a dude could get to letting loose a Korean-drama styled, love-triangle ending "man-cry"....next to unsuspecting patrons sitting alongside Philippe's community dining tables. Back to the sandwich: I did try the beef sandwich before adding this demon of a sauce and it tasted really nice. It had deep and very straight-forward beef flavor, but unfortunately not much else. Each bite left me looking for a little more dimensional roundness to the beef flavor (maybe if they added a few aromatic vegetables cooked in the au jus?) as it tended to taste monotonous save for the mustard, but that's not how Philippe rolls. And speaking of rolls, I liked the little diamond-shaped baguette rolls used for the sandwich. It really held up well to the double-dip soaking in au jus and had nice chewiness to accompany the beefy goods. The beef slices themselves were indeed tender, but maybe could have been a little less crumbly in its bite texture. In the end, this sandwich registered a very respectable 60% on my food-awesomeness meter.

I gotta admit I wasn't sure what to expect because I'm not big on French-dipped sandwiches. But when I walked in and saw there were at least 6 lines that were about 7-8 people deep I know something had to be up. So I waited patiently deciding which sandwich meat to get... beef, turkey, pork, etc. Going with the beef I knew it would let me down... and ohhhhh boy it didn't! That sandwich was flipping amazing! But when I got to my final bite, it was like that's it? I'm still hungry... So although the sandwich was one the better ones that I've had, as a college student on a tight budget it didn't turn out to be a place that I would drop in for lunch or a quick snack...

Stopped by on my way home this afternoon for din din. Almost no lines. Had my usual beef dip, cole slaw, and chili with beans. 蔕h my the beef was savory the dip a little salty. The chili was divine. And the slaw good as ever. I love to people watch while eating my grub. I think if you sat there long enough you would see everybody in LA pass by. I am not sure what you call the girls that prepare your food at the counter. There not waitresses or cooks or servers what do you call them? Anyway they do a great job and if you notice they don't touch your dirty money with their hands . You put your cash only in a little tray after your food in ready and they wisk it away to the cashier that touches the dirty money. The ( ? � brings back your change in the little tray so she never touches it. Although when I left a tip I did not see how she got that out of the tray. Nuff said.

Walking in here is like taking a trip back to old L.A., with the decor that probably hasn't changed much for most of the 20th century, sawdust littered floor, and long rows of communal tables. 蔍t's also one of the few places where you can see blue collar workers and white collar workers in suits chowing down at the same communal table. Allegedly the home of the original French dip sandwich, Phillipe's is a L.A. classic and serves delicious, inexpensive grub. 蔊o for a lamb sandwich, double dipped. 蔠hat could be better than a crusty french roll double dipped in au jus and filled with nothing but delicious, gamey lamb? The potato and macaroni salads are also pretty darn good. 蔍f you care to impress your friends or shock your significant other, add one of their pickled pig's foot to your plate, and savor their facial expressions as you gnaw on the tangy pig's foot soaked in vinegar, onions, and peppers. 蔜he custard, tapioca pudding, and cut of pies are all satisfying. 蔆rowds at lunch and before major sporting events can be overwhelming, but at least they move relatively quickly.

I don't know... I wanted to love this place after seeing it in the Food Network and hearing hype about it from local LA ppl. 蔜he crowded parking lot was giving us hope, as well as the super long (and slow) multiple lines to place the orders. 蔜he old hotel-like building, the chaos inside, and the somewhat grumpy ppl behind the counters (at least the two we interacted with)... so far so good. 蔜he guy in front of us was telling us about their signature mustard, a must have. 蔛o our time to order came, and we ordered two beef French dips with sides of cole slaw and potato salad and a lemonade. 蔆heap, good. Short trip up the stairs to what looked like dorm rooms with long tables, with a cafeteria/prison feel to it. 蔄 bit odd, but then again, it adds to the character I thought. 蔅y now my expectations of the sandwich was quite high. 蔜hen came the food. 蔄fter a much hyped up first bite, I was left wondering, "hmmmmm, perhaps if I put some mustard". 蔄fter the second bite I thought, "hmmm... tastes like wasabi". 蔆omfort food I get, but it was lacking in taste, unless I'm missing something. 蔍 mean, it's ok, not too bad, but worth the hype?

I came to Philippe The Original Restaurant on 4th of July with my wife, mother, and youngest brother. This was my second visit and I had a very similar experience both times. Obviously there is a ton of hype about this place. It gets featured on the Food Network and the Travel Channel (Sandwich Paradise and #96 on the top 101 Chowdown Countdown) regularly. Let's break this down into pros and cons... PROS - The sandwiches are good. The meats taste like they are roasted there daily (because they are). There is a "homemade" flavor that you are not going to get at a chain restaurant. The guy who said he can get a better French dip at Quizno's is a fool and should stick to fast food. - The dip. Make sure to get your sandwich double dipped. The term "double dipped" is very misleading here. One would assume that "double dipped' would be twice as wet as "single dipped". That is not true. I would say that a double dipped sandwich is about 10%-20% more juicy than the single dipped. You came here for a French dip, and you are not getting a side of au jus, so get your sandwich double dipped. Also, delete the image of some drenched and soggy sandwich that you can't eat with your hands out of your head, because that is not what you are going to get, it will be fine, trust me. - The prices. There are reviews on here that say this place is overpriced. How do you figure? Did you just hop out of a time machine from 1984? Maybe you are a tourist from a 3rd World country? Anyway here is our order, you be the judge on the price... - 3 beef sandwiches, two with cheese - 1 lamb sandwich with blue cheese (mine, and it was good) - 2 coleslaws, 1 potato salad, 1 macaroni salad - 2 bags of chips - 4 dill pickles - 3 sodas and an iced tea This came out to $42. Not too bad for LA. - Nostalgia. You can bring your out of town friends and family to a place that they will remember. They can go home and tell people that they ate at the home of the French dip, which for whatever reason sounds cool. CONS - Cash only - The crowd. Crowds follow hype, and usually that means hoards of tourists. Hoards of tourists slow down the line because they don't know how to order. It is similar to an international airport terminal. Imagine a bunch of confused looking foreigners looking up at signs that they can't read with anguished looks on their face like they are in pain. Since they aren't sure what to do they succumb to "lemming syndrome" and just file into the longest possible line. Unfortunately, that happens here. Don't be like that. Step up in the shortest line, send a scout to go reserve a table, order your sandwiches double dipped and enjoy. Philippe's is solid. I wouldn't drive up to LA to eat there by myself, but will be back when people come to town to visit.

This is THE only place to go for french dip sandwiches... no other places can compare! Crispy french baguette and soggy at the same time... dripping au jus... tender juicy beef/pork/lamb/ham/turkey... whatever cheese you like... n top it off with the hot mustard... There's seriously long lines any time of the day, every day esp on a Sunday after church/service. BUT the lines move fast. CASH ONLY but there's ATM in the premises. You have to make sure you already know what to order by the time you get to the counter as again, there's a lot of people waiting. Freshly squeeze lemonade are so good, esp for .75 cents. Coffee is .09 cents. Everything is good... from dill pickles, to pickled egg, to potato salad, to baked apple... etc... You can never go wrong with your order. And oh, I can't review without mentioning their special hot mustard... EVERYONE as in EVERYONE (OK, maybe NOT for everyone esp little kids) If U R BRAVE ENOUGH... U should try it, at least once... it's like wasabi but BETTER!!! It hits you right on the sinus... and clears it right up =D If you like spicy/hot stuff... this is a MUST!!!!!!!!!!!!! Don't forget to ask, "DOUBLE-DIP please"!

What a cool throw-back restaurant. 蔣ou place your order at the deli counter and the wait staff is wearing vintage-style uniforms. Philippe claims to have invented the French Dip sandwich, but there is another LA restaurant that lays claim to the title: Cole's PE Buffet. 蔔ow, I don't want to get in the middle of some old-time LA feud (both places were established in 1908), but given the fact that Phillipe's has over 300 reviews and Cole's has about 15, I think we have a winner. Anyway, great sandwiches, kick ass mustard, and a fun experience. 蔄 great choice for dinner before a Dodger game.

I first heard about this restaurant a few years back while watching Huell Howser on PBS. Then about a year ago, I finally went here while in LA with my sister. I ordered the lamb sandwich and she ordered the beef sandwich. I've never had lamb before, but it tasted too dry. Their potato salad was good. I think they hyped it up too much on TV and this place really isn't that great. It looks pretty ghetto, both on the outside as well as inside. It would be better if the sandwiches came with cheese instead of having to order it to be added it on. And maybe some vegetables with the sandwich to make it somewhat healthier. Overall, I'm never going back here.

If you are in the LA area and are looking for something to satisfy that need for a good sandwich without spending too much, you're in for a treat. 蔖hillippe the Original Restaurant is a historical, landmark place that has the BEST french-dipped sandwiches ever. 蔜he beef sandwich is simply mouth-watering. 蔄nd you have to top it off with a slice of blueberry pie :). A good tip: 蔈xpect lines. 蔒y family and I waited at least 20 minutes. 蔜rust me...it's worth it :). 蔄lso, it's delicious (and no extra charge) to ask for the sandwich to be "double-dipped".

Philippe's is by far one of my favorite places in Los Angeles. 蔍t has been here for ages (my family has been going for 5 generations) and has become an LA landmark. �Here are a few things to look forward to: -the best french dipped sandwiches around (I suggest the beef "double dipped" meaning they'll dip both pieces of bread) - Mustard! 蔜he mustard here has a horse radish type of burn to it. 蔍t's really good on the sandwiches, but watch out. �-great historic atmosphere. 蔍f you have time I'd just take a walk around the building, check out the upstairs area...find the plaque �-) -great location, right on the edge of china town, across the street from union station and right next to olvera street -Cheap coffee! I believe it is still $0.60 a cup Here are my tips for the first timers: -bring cash. 蔵t's a cash only place and you don't want to get stuck using their atm - Tip! 蔜his isn't a fast food place. �- if you're bringing kids, try to keep them from playing with the sawdust on the floor. 蔴aha. �I'm just saying this from experience. 蔠hen I was a kid the sawdust was the reason I came to this place. 蔍'd sweep it up into big piles with my feet and I'm sure the staff didn't like that - stop by the newstand on the way out. 蕋here is something about getting a newspaper and a candy bar there that just feels so nostalgic...even if you're like me and born in the 80's - Again, watch out for the mustard...unless you want to clear your sinuses.

FINALLY!! I got a chance to try the famous french dip !! I got there on weekdays at an odd times, around 4pm. It was not crowded at all and I can directly place my order! NICE!! The food here is a really disappointment for me. The portion is very small, the bread is tasteless and I mean the food is really mediocre or I can even say it's no good! I got the beef double dip, the potato salad and the macaroni salad. None of them are special and I thought it will taste better. But I was wrong. Definitely got to try this place ONCE just for the sake of having been there as it is a Los Angeles landmark. But,,, don't expect much for the food here :)

I've heard of Philippe's before and when I stumbled upon it while doing some shopping in Chinatown, I just had to try it. I wasn't sure which type of meat to order. It was between the pork and the beef, I chose the beef. I was not disappointed. Very simple sandwich with lots of flavor. the spicy mustard was a little to much for me though. It wasn't spicy for me, but I just thought the flavor was overwhelming. I had a bite of my gf's turkey sandwich and thought it was pretty tasty also. Hopefully I get another chance to visit the next time I'm in so-cal.

Delicious sandwiches served up by waitresses you can't help but assume are all named Flo. 蔛awdust on the floor and lines out the door - this place is worth the 10-15 minutes you'll spend waiting in line. Try the lamb, double-dipped! 蔍t's hand carved straight off the bone right while you wait. 蔜heir most popular sandwich is the roast beef, but lamb is my favorite. 蔆areful with the horseradish sauce (a bottle on every table); it will kick your ass and make you cry.

Ah yes, I finally get to review Philippe's. I too have heard the hype, and was finally given the chance to check the place out on a Tuesday lunch. Parking at the time we went was okay, across the street from the restaurant, though we went before noon. I don't like lines and crowds, and here I was with a place that had them. Lines aren't exactly defined. It's very much deli style, where there's a counter, and then a bunch of people. The person that helped us apparently had a case of bad hearing, as she just kept getting the order wrong. The majority of the counter help were middle-aged women on up. I didn't know what to expect going in. I rarely read through Yelp reviews. I probably should have. Their drinks are small, but then again, so are the prices (under a $1). Their lemonade was tart, which I do like. Their sandwiches are small as well. In comparison, they're like a 6inch sub, but priced like a footlong ($6-7). I got to sample the lamb and pork. Not much meat. The pork was okay. Maybe because I'm not a big lamb person, but wasn't really feeling that one. Not that it was dry or anything, just not a fan for the gamey taste. Perhaps one of the few highlights was getting to try out their spicy mustard. That's pretty good, with a kick of horseradish. Mmmm... Maybe next time I'll just go buy a bottle of that. The atmosphere is cafeteria style, with bits of wood shavings on the floor. It's a nice atmosphere, though seemed like much of the crowd that were sitting there were of the older generation. Perhaps the younger generation takes it to go? Overall, it's something to experience, but now that I have, it's probably not something I would frequent unless I was with good company (luckily I was with such this time around). Someone get me some mustard!

I really wanted to like Philippe's, but I was pretty disappointed. 蔍 ordered the lamb sandwich, single dipped with no cheese for lunch. 蔍 wasn't expecting prime rib on a bun, just the tasty, flavorful and satisfying sandwich Philippe's is known for. For $6.95, my sandwich was a bit small, and the meat was pretty dry and flavorless. 蔍t was enjoyable after I added a healthy amount of their horseradish packed mustard, but not that great. 蔉or the price, I'd rather get a better meal somewhere else. �If you do go, I would get cheese and ask for it to be double dipped. 蔛eems like it'd be better. 蔍t seems like Philippe's is riding off of it's reputation instead of improving and perfecting what it does. 蔖eople will still buy into it, and it'll be just as packed as it's always been, but I don't think I'll be going back.

I always feel like I"m walking into a NYC/Wall Street district are type cafeteria when I walk into Philippe's!! 蔜he lines that move fast, the long benches, the pickled eggs on the counter, all that wonderful food to look at as you wait for your turn to order. I just love these sandwiches. 蔒y favorite is the beef dip. 蔍f you like a wet sandwich, this is the place. 蔍 order my beef dip with swiss and it's heaven. 蔍 also get the potato salad, which is DELICIOUS, not watery, just right, no frill potato salad. 蔕H, the beef dip with the hot mustard that they offer on the tables, is just DIVINE!!!!!!!! i love this place so much. 蔒akes me feel like I'm home. 蔍've been here many times and the sandwiches were always really good. 蔜he menu is fun, the prices are ok, the vibe is amazing, and most importantly, the food is delicious (again, if you like wet sandwiches....). And take a walk down to Olvera Street while you're down there! 蔄nd Union Station, which is across the street from Olvera Street. 蔇owntown LA has some really interesting spots and makes a NY'er like me feel a little more at home.

Somewhere out there, I know there's a better French dipped sandwich but I'm compelled to say Philippe's French dip sandwich is the best. 蔍t's been programmed to my system much like McDonald's French fries. Last year, Philippe's celebrated its 100th year. It's easy to understand why. I did not grow up eating at Philippe's but there's something very comforting about having a meal of beef sandwich + coleslaw and lemonade on one of their communal tables. Philippe's is an LA institution and I'm rooting for another 100 years. And more.

A true LA institution! 蔍've been coming to Philippe's ever since I could walk and it still looks the same. 蔍t's kind of like a culinary time capsule. Philippe's invented the french dipped sandwich and they're still the best! 蔒y favorite sandwiches are the lamb and the roast beef. 蔠hile all the components of the sandwich are divine (namely the french rolls, meats, and au jus) it is the horseradish mustard that truly puts it over the top. 蔅e sure that you condimize your sandwich with a dollop or two of this heavenly hot sauce for the full gastronomic effect. 蔍t just isn't a Philippe's french dip without it!

The thing about Phillipe's is that its great reputation will generally precede it. 蔛o when you get into the line that makes you think of theme park hell (yes, it's that long) you start to feel like it may be overrated. 蔉ortunately, this is not the case. �The meat is tender and juicy and the cheeses melt right on top giving it a wonderful gooey, juicy texture in every bite. 蔜op that off with French rolls that have been dipped in the juices from the meat and this sandwich quite simply rocks your socks off. 蔄nd the cherry on top is their delicious spicy mustard. 蔍t will clear your nostrils the moment you take a bite so be careful if you're not into spicy food. This place is as good as people say, believe the hype! 蔉or some quick recommendations, you can't go wrong getting the roast beef but for me, my favorite is the lamb and blue cheese, double-dipped of course. 蔄lso, the potato salad and chili are delicious and the lemonade is a very refreshing. Cheers!

I just started graduate school and basically that means I cant afford fancy meals anymore. But i still want quality food. So my friend introduced me to Philippe's. Saying its affordable and the best french dip shes ever had. So i HAD to try this out! So one very big plus is that Philippe's has their own parking lot.. so you don't have to pay for parking!!! in downtown LA free parking is a +++++++++ This place always has a line every time i go! but the workers there are really fast and efficient so you don't have to wait forever. but just be prepared to wait. they have really yummy horseradish mustard that just MADE my sandwich THAT much better. their soups were pretty good. I think i had their clam chowder and it just warmed me right up! Overall Philippe is affordable and very delicious. I would definitely recommend coming here if you ever get the chance! recap: 1) FREE PARKING 2) French dip!!! 3) Horseradish mustard! 4) AFFORDABLE!!!!!

Located a few blocks from Olvera street, this sandwich place has been in Los Angeles for over a hundred years! 蔜hey say that they invented the french dipped sandwich after they accidentally dropped a french roll in a pan filled with beef juices. 蔍'm glad that they served that roll, because these sandwiches are great! I like to order the beef sandwich double dipped and with jack cheese. 蔜he double dipping makes the bread a little wet, but the sandwich holds together fine and I feel that it is worth the extra shot of flavor. 蔠hat gives the sandwich an extra kick is their house mustard, which can be extra spicy. 蔖ut too much mustard and your sinuses will clear instantly! On the side, I like to order two small glasses of their fresh-squeezed lemonade (75 cents each) and a side of potato salad. 蔜hey have a lot of desserts available as well, but I haven't had any desserts that I would recommend. There's always a crowd here and it's nice that they have two parking lots available. 蔍 think the atmosphere of the location is also extra cool. When you eat here, the dining area is setup like a cafeteria. 蔜hey also have an old-style candy shop and the floor is full of sawdust. 蔍t does have the feel of a restaurant from the 1900s. I love it because the sandwiches are good, the atmosphere is cool, and it's just fun.

Yeah their sandwiches are bomb, I can use a lamb or beef with dip on the side (I love the crunch of the bread! and I eat sandwiches slow) and generous serving of the mustard to burn its way through my nostrils with a side of some slaw and some beets and potato salad right about now or anytime actually. It's good and though my palette has tasted some rivaling French Dips, I come back to the original comfort always. What makes its special is that I've been going here a long time and was an odd place where I normally come with my dad. My dad and I tried to get to know each other when I was a teen so we often ate out. It was always cool to me that some of the staffed remembered us, were chatty with my dad. He did a business lunches here and took me along so I can have a sandwich. My dad passed away and I haven't been back since, but I have a feeling when I'm ready to sit and have the "usual" in "our" booth, it's going to always bring me back to goodtimes and set my palette awake with its mustard burn goodness. Because they made good sammies that we came back for, it's also a special place to remember my dad. Thanks for that.

I've been here twice. The first time was forgettable. The second time was fantastic. What's the difference. I double dipped! Dipping once, and ideally twice, takes the sandwich to another level. That spicy mustard takes it up to 11. I tried the beef and lamb. I prefer beef.

I have been wanting to try Phillipe's French dip sandwich for a long time. 蔍 stood in one of the many lines standing at the counter and I ordered the beef with swiss cheese, double-dipped. 蔍 don't understand what all the hype is about and why anyone would rave about how good it is. 蔜he bread was just okay and the meat wasn't all that flavorful. 蔄nd, for $6.60 + tax it wasn't a very good deal because the sandwich wasn't particularly that large. 蔍 left the restaurant disillusioned and very disappointed.

It is one of those places you go to cause you need to try it. It is pretty cheap, really cheap for certain items like coffee and lemonade. 蔉ood is ok, and that is why I gave it three stars. 蔠ill be honest and say I don't like their french dip even if it is suppose to be that way. 蔍 thought the bread got all soggy and was pretty gross by the time I was done which from looking at these other reviews is the way it is suppose to be. 蔍f I could dip it in the an jus (sp?) instead of it just coming wet would have solved that for me - maybe there is this option and I am just ignorant. 蔜hen I will take down my review if this is true - just message me. �Some other comments. 蔜hey have a parking lot. 蔖lace is huge. 蔅efore coming, I expected a stand. 蔅ut nope, it is huge. I had banana cream pie and true to the name of the thing, it was just slices of banana in cream. 蔔ot the pudding like substance I was use to with cream on top, but straight cream. 蔔ot good. �I can already see this review getting railed on, but oh well - the protection of the internet.

Great place to eat before the Dodger games. 蔊rab a double dipped sandwich w a side of potato salad, a bottled Stella & a pickle and you're good to go. I'd say experiment w the diff cheese options and meats and see what satisfies your appetite. 蔍've had the best luck w turkey & swiss (pretty much a given, right?), 蕋urkey or ham w bleu cheese. I've had the lamb twice and I can't get over how much fat it has, yuck! The hot mustard is HOT but it's gooooood... a lil' dab will do ya. For a dessert option, I fall to my knees whenever I get a slice of boysenberry pie & milk. 蔍'm in heaven the rest of my day.

Another fine Philippe's experience. Had the French Dipped ham sandwich for the first time (always stuck to beef or pork). Went really well with the mustard. Simply that with the hot mustard and a Fat Tire on tap would have been a plenty fine experience. But then I needed to check something online. I whipped out my DS and loaded up the Opera Browser. I was thinking I might be able to grab some random nearby wifi signal... Holy crap, Philippe's has a free wifi network! I love this place so much.

Good value. Great food. Cash only. Got the double dipped beef sandwich with jack cheese. Also got a bowl of straight chili, along with one lemonade. Bomb au jus. Make sure to get the double dipped. The mustard sauce is good too. A little too burning though. The chili is very solid, comes with some saltine crackers. The size of the sandwich is slightly smaller than preferred. The closest thing that I can think of in terms of size is probably 3 and a half tennis balls worth. The lemonade was not bad, was slightly watered down. Cost about $12. I was decently full by the end of that.

This is an LA institution, you'll get the most legit French Dip ever. I am a beef only person, but you can get almost any meat you'd like. The menu goes on for ever... but focus on the sandwich.

This is one of those places you HAVE to go to at least once if you live in LA. 蔣ou know the kind.....it's one of those "World Famous Whatever...." kind of places, they may not have the best food or service, or atmoshpere in the world, but for whatever reason, they are always jam-packed with people. They are famous for their roast beef dips. 蔋owever...nothing comes on the sandwich but the bread and the meat. 蔄nd oddly enough, it has been pre-dipped, so you don't get that handy little cup of au jous sauce. 蔜he spicy mustard on the tables is delish, but be careful, you might choke if you underestimate the spiciness. 蔍 suggest grabbing a side of potato or macaroni salad and a cup of tapioca pudding, because the sandwich isn't very big. 蔍t is good, but nothing special. 蔞ery plain and simple. �My two favorite parts about this place are: 1. 蔜he cute little old ladies that work their in their little diner outfits. 蔍t adds to the classic feel of the place. 2. 蔜he space is cool. 蔍t's like an old broken down mental hospital inside. 蕋here is an upstairs with different rooms you can go claim. 蔒akes for a great group lunch (you get some privacy). The downside: 1. 蔍t's hotter than hell in there...no ac... 2. Cash only....LAAAAAME!

I think I've tried all the different meat sandwiches, (I am Filipino, so pork is still my favorite.) and most of the sides. 蔉or the noobs, you can't go wrong with the macaroni or potato salads. 蔕thers should 蕋ry those delightfully tart purple pickled eggs or the no-bean chili. When ordering lemonade or ice tea, you'll need to order at least 2 of those. �.and do not forget to order a slice of pie!! Oh, those pies!!

So, I've lived in the LA area for about a year now and hadn't made it to Philippe's until last weekend. Shame on me!! I am a big fan of the dip, and have had my share of biting into tough beef (you know, the kind that doesn't quite break when you bite it and ends up all falling out of the sandwich?) - so this sammy was super tender and good. I had the beef single dipped w/swiss cheese. Only complaint is that I kinda wish my cheese would have been melted. Other than that, it was yummy. I also had some slaw - which was pretty non descript but tasty and a DELICIOUS PIECE OF PEACH PIE. I don't even like pie, so that should say something. The down side was the craziness of the crowd and people cutting (a pet peeve of mine) and talking and just basically being annoying. I get kind of cranky when I'm hungry. I don't want to listen to everyone's conversations, etc. 蔣ou almost need a plan of action at this place - like a tag team effort of ordering and finding a place to sit. The only other reason I'm not giving 5 stars to this landmark is that my coworker just said it used to be a whorehouse in the 60s? No, but seriously, it's because a restaurant called Houston's makes shaved prime rib dips that are the ultimate. If, after reading this, you are unsure whether you should go to Philippe's...GO! It's an experience. :)

Oh Philippe... You can smell the history walking in here. It's "controversial" claim (I don't think it's controversial) that Philippe's is home of the original French Dip sandwich. Story goes that the bread accidentally fell into the roast beef grease, and voila, the French Dip was created. The line is always long and disorganized, but the sandwiches are worth it. I prefer the classical beef, but there are a number of meat and cheese options, such as lamb or chicken with swiss or american. Everyone raves about the pies and the spicy mustard, but I can't say I'm a fan myself of either. The cherry pie was average, and I just thought the mustard was tooo spicy. That being said, this place is really a slice of history. It's got the best french dip sandwich that I've had. The roll soaks up the juice perfectly, and the meat is unapologetically rich and delicious. I'm happy that I got to try Philippe's after hearing so much about it finally...

Its a grand old place, with requisite sawdust and pickled eggs at the counter. The meat may be overcooked; I prefer the pork sandwich to the beef for this reason. But in this rare case the meat is not the main feature of the sandwich. Its a combination of the au jus, bread and the utterly fantastic mustard. I prefer to skulk upstairs and eat in the private rooms where somewhere on the ancient exposed brick it says Phares '88. Look up, whats that on the ceiling? Why it looks like... it is! A little yellow chilli pepper! Looks like the Chillipepper Bandito has struck again, aye caramba!

Every time that I've been here, there's at least a 10 minute wait in line to order your food. 蔅ut, that won't stop me from coming back. I recommend the single dipped Lamb sandwich ($6.95) and adding a bit of their famous mustard. 蔄s for the sides, I enjoyed themacaroni ($1.15) and the coleslaw ($1.15). I was not too impressed with the lemonade ($0.75) and would get the iced tea ($0.65) next time. 蔋ot tea, juice, soda, beer and wine are also available. There are flat-screen tvs throughout so it can be a place to watch sports with your buddies at. Complimentary self-parking lots provided behind the establishment and across the street from it. There is a security guard that makes sure only patrons park here.

There is really nothing to say, I mean this place is always packed, charges outrageous prices but I will still drive an hour to eat here. The food is pretty much close to what they are serving in heaven. I hate the turkey here though... its too dry even when u get it double dipped. I usually order 1 beef sandwich double dipped with swiss cheese, 1 pickle, beef stew, 2 lemonades, & tapioca pudding. Here are some tips if you are going here. 1. Bring cash, as this place does not accept card. They have an ATM but I don't think you want to get charged the fee. 2. Ask for your sandwich double dipped or even wet or else u won't really get the true experience of Phillipes. 3. Stay away from the turkey, unless you really like it, I only eat turkey on Thanksgiving. 4. If you're getting the lemonade buy at least 2, 1 is not enough to satisfy even the most petite Asian girl in Los Angeles. 5. For those late nights coffee is 9 cents...why not? 6. Try to make it to their anniversary day, sandwiches are like 10 cents be prepared to wait in theme park lines though!

I can see why this place is almost at it's 100 years anniversary. Speaking of which that's really impressive. No wonder they are now a landmark! I used to be impressed with Pinks and Tommy's but now 60+ looks like nothing. Also something I always amaze at is how these old places seem to have prices that reach back to their old days too! I think you have to get their renowned french-dipped sandwiches if you go they are delicious. Try a side with it like to coleslaw or potato salad it goes just right with it. I like the atmosphere also. Downstairs it seems like there is always people coming in or upstairs where you can find a bit of solitude.

Took the subway to union station, walked through Olvera St. to Philippes, and ate a double dipped beef sandwich with a bowl of clam chowder. Not the largest portions in the world, but you can't beat the flavor. 100x better than coles imho. Cash only, and they have a candystand inside. You should try it. They're the original. The mustard is wasabi-style-nose spicy but it's a must have condiment.

During lunch hour on a weekend, the lines are ridiculously long, but lucky there are several lines and service is quick! 蔠oot. 蔙estaurant is also pretty big too; I would go into how long the wait to grab a table was, but too bad for me (hardy har har) I didn't do the waiting . . . my friends did. :) �I got the Roast Beef French Dip sandwich and the potatoe salad. 蔍 enjoyed both, but I also wish I got to dip my own French Dip!! 蔍 like it juicy baby. 蔕h well. 蔖oo. 蔛till for the price (pretty affordable), this is a winner. A few days later, I saw it featured on $40 a Day (You know, Rachael Ray's show), and I was so excited! 蔍'm easily pleased, okay!

Playing catch up to these things called french dips required me to be objective and try both places that invented it in one week. 蔛O, I'll have to play the pros and cons of Philippe's in comparison to that other, newly re-opened place: Pros: 1) Philippe's gives you more food for a better value. 蔜hey have more on the menu, and more meat on the sandwich. 蔜hey're pretty efficient at the sandwich making once your order is in. 2) The atmosphere is great, old-timey, but more 40s and 50s old-timey. 3) Banks of telephone booths. 4) Dang, that mustard is spicy and good. 蔎ust watch out for the horseradish shooting out of your nose like some old cartoon character if you put too much on your food. 5) Parking seems way more convenient. Cons: 1) I'm not sure I'm a fan of the pre-dipped sandwich. 蔍 have to say I like the freedom to adjust my au jus intake as necessary, plus it seems to stay hotter when it's separate. 蔍 have to have things stay hot. 2) The service, while manageable, just seems really slow. 蔍 can't imagine trying to get a bit to eat while in a hurry during lunchtime. 3) Some of the side dishes and other foods just have a high school cafeteria kind of feel to them. 蔣ou may like this, but some things just gross me out. I think the choice for your french dip needs ends up being where you feel most comfortable, switching even between the two based on your mood. 蔍 think LA has room for two inventors of the french dip....

Not much can be said here that has not already been said. If you don't like soggy sandwiches, you shouldn't come here ... Aleks & Nate ;) I happen to like soggy sandwiches when the sogginess comes from that Philippe's dip. I had the lamb. It was delicious. I like the ladys dressed in 50's garb behind the counter too. and I like that they fix the sandwiches right in front of you at each individual counter "station." Cole Slaw was top notch. OK. Eat at Philippe's. That is all.

Philippe's French Dip sandwich. 蔔othing more needs to be said. 蔖hilippe's is a Los Angeles institution. 蔜hey still sell a ten cent cup of coffee. 蔊et a french dip, some cole slaw or potato salad and a piece of pie and you will be eating a meal your great grandparents ate. �This is the coolest old place that remains completely unchanged. 蔍t's living history. 蔠hen those Santa Ana's are a blowin' and Raymond Chandler is on your mind, head on downtown to Philippe's and get a feel for Old Los Angeles.

Great french dip sandwiches!!!! �MUST TRY! You walk in...and if it's really busy, you'll see a billion lines. 蔆hoose one to stand in and be ready to order when you get to the front. 蔜his place gets PACKED. �Lots of tables downstairs...with sawdust on the floor. 蔜he main floor was packed so we took our food to the second floor. 蔠hen you get to the second floor, you get confused at first. 蔍t's not like an open floor in a restaurant. 蔜here are individual rooms that looked like they were offices or classrooms before. 蔠e ate in one of the rooms. 蔏inda weird but nice at the same time since it was quieter.

Its probably downright unamerican not to like this place and being the good American girl that I am, I have only a few negatives to say about Phillipes so I'll just get them out of the way right up front. The parking is a pain and the lines are atrocious. Ok now that I've got that off my chest here's the good, I loved this place! Its an old LA staple and every bit as good as I thought and hoped it would be. I went as a newbie, now having found a job in downtown LA of all god forsaken places. So I have made it my mission to check out all the old famous LA places everyone talks about and you see on the Food Network. I went last Friday for lunch with a friend from work and was warned, "parking is going to be shitty and once we're in, there's going to be long lines" Well he was right on both counts but I didn't care. I was just excited to finally be there. I opted for the pork dip sandwich with coleslaw and an ice tea. The sandwich was really tender and tasty (this from a girl who rarely if ever orders dips anywhere) the coleslaw was awesome, this stuff could give many a deli a run for their money. No room for dessert but they had a nice selection, Don't forget to try thier spicy mustard. You can buy it to take home or squeeze some out of their sticky bottles , be careful though, its really spicy so I just sqeezed a bit on my plate and dipped it gingerly with each bite, worked great. The place is deceivingly big in terms of places to plop your trays down to eat. 蔜ry upstairs, its usually quieter. It may be a cash only place, not 100% sure though. Anyway, it was a treat and I can't wait to go back and try the lamb dip, people all over were getting that and raving about it. mmmm I'm getting hungry just thinking about it.

I've been wanting to try a French dip sandwich for a few months now, so I went there tonight. 蔍 ordered the beef sandwich, double dipped. 蔍 ordered the sandwich to-go so it probably lost a little bit of it's magic on the way home, but it's still a pretty good sandwich. 蔜he bread dipped in au jus provided a lot of flavor, and it wasn't too soggy either. 蔜he beef was fairly decent. 蔍 was satisfied, but a slight bit disappointed. 蔅ut for the money, it's a great place to stop in for lunch. �The atmosphere was typical of a diner behind the counter. 蔜he employees were bustling as there was a good sized line forming. 蔜he seating area reminded me of a dive bar, with wood shavings all other the floor. 蔔eedless to say that this isn't a fancy type of place, but it's comfortable enough and the food is hearty.

My good friend Mike took me to this place to grab a bite to eat after a long and exhausting Saturday of house hunting and this had to be the best pick me up in the history of pick me ups. The place is somewhat tucked away, so it didn't jump out at me at first. Once you get inside, it looks like the cafeteria from the Wonder Years. While the menu provides you with a large variety of meat and cheeses to combine to your heart's delight, for my money, you can't beat the combination of ham and blue cheese, it is as close to heaven as I have had the joy of consuming. Add on some potato salad and lemonade, and just when I thought it couldn't get any better......you add some of their signature hot mustard and its GAME OVER. It all seems like such a distant dream.....i'm trying not to drool just thinking about it.......must......have......more......

One of my favorite places ever, having grown up in the L.A. area. 蔖hilippe is an L.A. institution. They have two free parking lots, one right behind the restaurant, and another big lot directly across the street. 蔍 always go across the street because it's bigger and less of a traffic mess. When you get inside, it can be a little intimidating. 蔍t's usually packed with people and mulitple lines among a bunch of tables and chairs with wacky people around. For the newcomers, just hold your head high and walk right to the shortest line. 蔇on't worry about a thing. �After you get your food, simply go grab a table. The best is coming here on a sunny blue sky Saturday for lunch to grab a sandwich, coleslaw, and a coke. 蔣es, the sandwiches are "medium-sized," and for some you may feel like you need two. �I feel that way, but just know that one sandwich actually does the trick. 蔄lso, that way you won't feel uncomfortably full as you walk out and do the rest of your day in L.A.... 蔠hy blow a perfectly good L.A. Saturday trying to sleep your way out of a food coma?

I go here every once in a blue moon, mostly because my dad loves it. It's definitely got the historical aspect going on -- being there reminds me of living in another era. The lamb sandwich with a side of pickles and macaroni salad and a soda and I'm set! The French Dip sandwiches are delicious. They may not look big enough for one's appetite, but one of those bad boys and you're good to go. And I'm not even a fan of French Dip sandwiches! Oh, and coffee is STILL 9 cents a cup -- how could you go wrong? I usually go on the weekends early in the morning, around 10am or so. There's usually a good crowd already at that time, but have found prime seating every time. LOL @ the person who said there are a lot of cops... it IS true...

The beef sandwich was right on. My friend and I must have come at their only "off" hour-which wasn't even off, really, because there were a ton of people eating in the huge establishment, and our line (of 4 lines) was only two people deep when we got there. It's kinda great that the woman who made our sandwiches didn't touch the money. They have a good system going.

A great place to bring people who want fun, taste, and sense of local tradition. Everything is simple and fuss-free, from the sawdust on the floor to the flimsy paper plates to the kick-ass mustard that doesn't pause to flirt as it propels its way up your nasal canal. The adorable waitresses look like they've been here since before the war. It's not the best food you'll ever had, but it's a place you can depend on and return to repeatedly. I think the lamb with blue cheese ($7.55) is the best french dip sandwich combination. The lamb isn't too lamby (for those of you who don't usually like the taste), but it definitely ain't beef either. They are generous with the blue cheese, which nicely cuts through the tender lamb and adds a creamy texture. With a dash of the aforementioned mustard, this thing hits the spot. The side salads (cole slaw, macaroni, potato) are more generic and cafeteria-style, but they go nicely with the sandwiches and hover around $1. So go ahead and order them, too. If you're craving chili, the chili bowl ($2.85) isn't bad; there's actually meat in there. For other hot comforts, they have rotating special soup bowls ($3.10). The coffee really isn't good, or else it doesn't do much to keep you awake after stuffing yourself here. But when it's NINE CENTS per cup, I always get a couple. If only to wash down one of the fruit pies ($3.35).

This place is a historic site and well worth a visit. I was a little disappointed with the food, but the double beef dip with swiss was a little dry. Is it just me? Next time I'll get a side of au jus, and it'll be all good. The apple pie was good, though! It had a nice, buttery crust, and the apple filling reminded me of McDonald's apple pies in a nostalgic, happy sort of way.

Phillippe's has been around for 100 years, so you know they're doing something right. 蔍t's the classic definition of an LA institution and famous for its French dipped sandwiches. The restaurant has a lunch counter atmosphere with sawdust on the floors and long plank tables to eat at. 蔍t attracts everyone around LA from blue collar workers to lawyers to cops. 蔜here's always a line around lunch time but it moves pretty quickly. 蔍t's right across from Union Station, so if you work downtown, it's only 1 or 2 short metro stops away. They have beef, pork, lamb, turkey, or ham sandwiches, and a variety of sides and deserts. 蔜he beef stew is great, and so is the potato salad. 蔜hey have fantastic slices of pie for desert, I always get the blueberry pie. 蔄 notable item on the menu is their cup of coffee because it's the original 1908 price of only 9 cents. �How do you beat that?) 蔜hey have a pretty spicy horseradish sauce on all the plank tables for the French dipped sandwiches, it's great but be careful not to overdo it! Phillipe's is a one of the greatest lunch establishments in LA. 蔍 once visited three days in a row. 蔍t's filling food at a good price with a vintage atmosphere.

SKIP IT. Not Delicious. Don't Buy The hype. Yes, there was a line. Yes, people seemed excited. Here is the thing though... My sandwich was not delicious. It wasn't even really good at all. The meat wasn't good. the bread was bad and it lacked any real flavor. The cheese was just sitting on top, not melted at all and the sandwich was lukewarm. I couldn't even finish it. I ordered 1 sandwich, a water and chips and they couldn't figure out my order. The place I could find a table was off to the side and was sad and depressing. It felt like a little jail-cell.

Simply the bomb. Really good sandwiches. Gotta give hommage to the originators of the French Dip. Make sure you get yours double dipped in the Au Jus and not just single dipped, or even worse, not dipped. Wouldn't recommend the mustard crap tho. Sorry. I know it has a history behind the the mustard, still taste like shit. Go with the beef followed by the lamb. Turkey, not so much. Place is always packed.

It's about as good as I expected. It's weird that they pre-dip your sandwich, but I guess you just suck that up and get over it. I mistakenly (intentionally but it was a bad choice) asked for American cheese on mine. Yuck. Sandwich not hot enough to melt the cheese, strange texture on an already weird substance. Beef was abundant, the mustard is indeed hot and delicious. We got coffee cups and bought mustard to go.

Went with the family because this place gets so much press as the inventors of the modern day French Dip Sandwich. �First impressions - it's a good place to go with a group of friends or the family when they come to town. 蔠hy? 蔅ecause the historical kitsch of the place, the ladies behind the counter taking orders, the pickle eggs sitting on the counter and the sawdust on the floor. 蔍t's a fun environment and as witnessed by several TV shows showcasing this place, it's definitely worth the visit. The food - it can be surmised that eating a soggy sandwich is probably a ridiculous thing to pay money for, but for some odd reason it works for them. 蔠e wound up getting a variation of the beef dip, and the lamb dip, both with double dip. 蔐ike someone previously posted, with the spicy mustard...everything works. 蔋owever, without it...it's actually a little bland because it's just a soggy sandwich then. 蔠e also got sides of the cole slaw, macaroni salad, pickled eggs the coconut cream pie and a pecan pie. 蔍 say, skip the cole slaw. 蔍f you really like cole slaw, go to KFC...you'll get a much better cole slaw there. 蔜he macaroni salad is passable. 蔜he pickled eggs are very good. 蔍 did not have a bite of the coconut cream pie, but seemed like a lot of people ordered it. 蔜he pecan pie, I would not order again. The one thing I would definitely recommend anyone not do is order the sandwich to go. 蔄 french dip by nature is a sandwich that doesn't travel well, especially if you get the beef. 蔜he meat wind up being really dry, yet the bread just gets soggy. 蔍f you want a french dip, I would eat it there.

I think what I like best about Phillipe's is that it is a place where you really see people from all walks of life. I've tried Cole's too, and while it was nice, it doesn't have the same communal spirit. You see people roll up to Phillipes in Porsches and on foot. Phillipe's has a more extensive menu than most realize. If you look, you'll see a huge board with more selections than you can imagine. I go for the turkey dip, single dip and a side of mac salad. I've never seen anyone spend more than $10/person here. The pickles are amazing--don't miss out. Never tried dessert, nor do I think I have room to, but maybe some day.

The parking is kind of bad over here. 蔜here are so many patrons that visit this spot, it's unbelievable. 蔜hey have two huge parking lots that were filled up when I got there. 蔍 had to take a second round before I caught someone leaving. When I got inside the restaurant, I saw about 8 different lines all with at least 10 people in each line. Wow this place is busy. 蔍 got in line and logged onto the yelp application on my iPhone 3GS to check out what people recommended to get here. 蔜he wait went real fast. 蔍 think I waited a little over 5 minutes. 蔍 ended up ordering the lamb with blue cheese and a beef with swiss cheese to bring home. 蔅oth DOUBLE DIPPED. 蔄s for sides, I got the potato salad. After walking through some sawdust on the floor, I found some seating and began to eat. 蔍 tried the lamb first and it came through with a huge surprise. 蔍 wasn't expecting so much flavor to come out of the sandwich. 蔜he meat was nice and tender and the blue cheese set it off! 蔍t was one of the best sandwiches I've ever tried. 蔜hat and the fact that it was double dipped added to the experience. 蔍 then tried the beef sandwich. 蔍t was good too. 蔜he beef was nice and soft as well but had less of a flavor than the lamb. 蔜he potato salad was alright. 蔍 wouldn't really rave about the sides. 蔍t's all about the sandwiches here. Overall, I'm for sure coming back for that lamb sandwich. 蔒ake sure to get it with blue cheese and DOUBLE DIPPED! 蔜hat sandwich is to die for!

Ehhh... this place is definitely not all it's hyped up to be. After seeing it several times on Food Network, especially as "best of" places... it just really doesn't measure up. I am a big fan of sandwiches...and this one is just plain bland. Also, my sandwich wasn't just bland...the bread was mushy... not juicy. The potato salad was mediocre. Nothing special but edible. I like the old-fashioned appeal of this place... but the food is really not that great. All in all, this place was a big let down. Try someplace else... like The Hat in Simi.

Yum this place was great! The sandwich might be too small if you're a big eater so think about getting two sandwiches. Can't go wrong with a beef french dipped sandwich. I would not recommend getting it with Blue Cheese unless you know you will like this combination. I wish I could try everything on the menu but it was my first and only time I will probably go here so I wanted to try what the restaurant is known for. There's a parking lot in the back so you don't need to pay for parking. I hear this place gets pretty crowded so it's nice that I went at a non-rush hour. The ladies working were also very nice. Good sandwich joint to grab a tasty lunch!

Way overrated. Everyone here on Yelp says it's the best sandwich of their lives, but if that's true, they must have a pretty sad life sandwich-wise. We came here on our road trip down to San Diego, so we seriously waited 6 hours to come here. I'd heard about this place while watching the LA episode of Man vs. Food, so with that endorsement, my expectations were high. Even if this place "invented" the French Dip sandwich, I was super disappointed. The boy tried the lamb sandwich, I tried the pork, and we shared the pickle, pasta salad, and potato salad. The sandwich was small for the price ($6) and overall pretty flavorless. It ended up being a vehicle for the spicy mustard, which had the kick of wasabi (which was good). Overall, very disappointed. If you've heard all the rave reviews, don't fall for the hype! I'm not a hater, I'm just honest about food.

Been living in LA my entire 29 years of life and I had never tried this classic establishment until Sunday...I must say, I have missed out! Wife and I went here and the first thing that hits you when you park is the smell of that delicious meat wafting through the parking lot. 蔕rdered two beef dips and a slice of apple pie. �Must say that it was probably the best dip sammy of my life. 蔅read was crusty and doughy, beef was tender and flavorful. But it was even better with their homemade horseradish....OMG, that was the best horsey sauce I have ever had. Apple pie was made perfectly too. The apple filling wasnt soggy, but baked perfectly. Crust was light and flaky with a slight buttery taste. Ever y morsel was delictable and the wife and I were fighting over the last bite. We will back!!

FINALLLY got to come here after seeing it numerous times on the food channel, travel channel, etc.etc.... when we got in at around....2pm on a saturday, the lines were longggg, i think we waited about 20 min in line? so we had plenty of time to think about what we wantd to order..and our choices were: 1 beef double dip with american 1 beef double dip with swiss 1 pork double dip with jack 1 coleslaw 1 potato salad 1 chili bowl 2 dill pickles 2 lemonades 1 iced tea total= about $32 thats alot of food for pretty cheap in my opinion... now..the sandwiches, were pretty good. i liked how the aujus wasnt too salty, and the bread was reallly good. not to hard on the outside, and perfectly chewy and moist inside. the meat was pretty good, a lil dry, but not bad....and that hot mustard..is REALLY hot. haha but it was good~ also, i love the cheese slices, they arent those meesly thin slices of cheese, but a nice good thick slice so that i could SEE and TASTE it in my sandwich. the pickles were crisp and juicy, and i really like the coleslaw...it was refreshing after all the meat and bread and cheese. the potato salad was also pretty good, but i think it was overshadowed by the potatoes. the chili, was also pretty good, a little too salty, and it reminded me of the chili at pinks :D all in all, it was a deliciously satisfying meal for not too much money, and i will def. be coming back here!

This place is seriously good. Got the beef double dipped with swiss cheese. AMAZING and delicious - not too heavy or overpowering. 蔜he size is perfect because you don't feel overly full afterwards. The coleslaw was also good. Lines are long but go pretty fast and the restaurant is actually pretty big so it wasn't hard to find a seat. �Overall a great place 蕋o get a French Dip Sandwich.

I was fortunate to be able to drop by this LA institution. 蔈stablished in 1908, it is said that the french dip sandwich was created here, when someone accidentally dropped the bread into the jus, and a food star was born. �It's a great deal and still a big draw - a meaty dipped beef (or lamb, pork, ham, or turkey) sandwich with great, fresh bread for $5.75. 蔍 also enjoyed a very good blueberry pie slice with my classic beef sandwich. The place is only a block from the old Chinatown near downtown. 蔍 could have dropped in when I was last in the neighborhood in 1979!

If you love french dips, you'll love Philippe's. It's very casual and fun. The lines can be really long, but it makes up for it since you get you're food right at the counter. Don't skip the spicey mustard with your french dip. It's fantastic! Definitely a spot you have to try out if you're in the LA area.

Ideas come to me through interesting ways. 蔍'll read about places on Yelp and go "hmm, maybe one day" and then...when boredom strikes, it happens. I get on AIM, bored off my mind and I say whats up to diva of all things interesting and fellow Yelper Tristen. �I'm bored and want to get out of my apartment!" �Let's try Phillipe's French Dip" she says. 蔉rench Dip? 蔍'm there. Quick ride on the 101 downtown, a little getting lost as always leads me to this funky old joint. 蔠e landed rockstar parking and strolled in. 蔜he cafeteria setting was a little funky to me and you couldn't really get a good look at the menu until you got up close. 蔜he servers seem like they've been doing this for a thousand years, not necessarily happily, but they do it. Nice coated and delicious french dip with a side of macaroni and a 60 cent (!) lemonade. 蔜here's no real ambience to it, just sawdust on the floor and walls that probably haven't been painted in decades. It was tasty, the meat was somewhat inconsistent but for the $5ish price, it was well worth the trip.

MEH. i don't understand how this place has 600+ reviews, with a 4-star rating? the place itself is cool--brick walls, a ny-style entrance where you have to go DOWN the stairs, old newspaper clippings from different decades, etc. it's obviously an LA landmark/staple. be advised, they only take cash. it's funny too, but person who takes your money puts it on a tray and doesn't touch it. they wear these old-school outfits, from the 50s (i think ?). the food comes out quick, but it's over-priced in my opinion. don't get me wrong, i frequent several places that are probably overpriced, but C'MON NOW. THESE ARE TINY SANDWICHES. TINY, NOT-SPECIAL, ALRIGHT-TASTING sandwiches. they're wet. they aren't anything to rave about. seriously. if anything, i was more impressed with the building. i love old buildings. the workers looked kinda scary to me, with their old-school outfits and melancholy expressions on their faces. they looked like dead people walking. hah. i came because i used to hear about this restaurant all the time. i don't think i'll ever come back. you're better off driving a block or two and going to won kok =P

I appreciate the historical significance of this place. 蔐ike Langer's in LA, going here is like traveling back to the past. 蔜he floor is covered in sawdust, the tables are long and communal, the women taking your orders are old (not in a bad way), and the food trays are peeling. 蔣ou order your food at the deli counter and there's no orderly line system. 蔎ust stand behind other people and wait for your turn. �I got here at 11am on a Saturday and I didn't have to wait too long to order. 蔋ere's a tip: always put your money on the small tray. 蔜he ladies aren't allowed to touch the money. The beef sandwich was ok. 蔍t wasn't spectacular. 蔜he bread was soft and dry enough to soak in the bit of au jus. 蔜he meat was tasty, but don't expect a really wet sandwich. 蔜he mustard was very spicy (in a wasabi way). 蔉or about $6, this lukewarm sandwich isn't something I would try again. 蔜he chili was nice. 蔒eaty and think like Tommy's, but not as spicy and greasy. 蔍 also got a decent slice of blueberrry pie. 蔍t was a nice experience, but again, it's nothing to rave about.

Hey Phillipes, I got a bone 蕋o pick with you. 蔉ire your power hungry rent-a-cops, who, instead of welcoming you into your historically rich establishment, choose to be A-holes and dick around with your customers at your parking lot. 蔊etting out of my car and walking three steps in the opposite direction of the restaurant DOESN'T mean I'm looking to leech off of the parking lot and loiter around Chinatown. 蔜hese lame rent-a-cops even peered into the windows to check if we were actually "customers." Enough ranting. 蔄s Will Ferrell says, "EVERYBODY LOVE EVERYBODY" 蔜hat's the way it should be here, (except for the parking po pos). 蔄 really diverse place full of young and old, rich and poor, all ethnicities. 蔛ometimes it feels like a cafe to me, sometimes it feels like a prison sitting at the wood benches cafeteria style. �I especially love the Lamb dip sandwich and pickles. 蔖rice is cheap for some things, but it can get over $10 if you order a hearty meal. 蔍'm sure back in the heyday you'd be spending less than 20 cents here. 蔛tinkin' inflation!

This place is almost always packed from what I hear. When we were there it was about 10 lines that were all about 8-12 deep. It does take a bit of time to get through the line, but it's worth it. It's one of those spots that are extremely unique and not many tourists know about. This was the only french dip sandwich that I have had, so there is no doubt that you could call it the best. I had the beef with bleu cheese, which was on a fresh bun dipped in au jus (but not soggy), hence the name "french dip". They also have their own (crazy hot) mustard that they have served since 1912 - you have to try it on at least one bite, even if it burns the nostrils. 蔄nd make sure that you get the pickles as the side order.

Like certain other mainstays in and around downtown, Phillipe scores major points for the initial impact; Step inside, and you're whisked back to a time when people wore fedoras and the community's idea of a sex offender was a man who took off his jacket around women. Perhaps due to the proximity to Union Station, there is a sort of railway memorabilia featured in the back dining room, though I haven't seen it and my friend told me she couldn't find it. Now the food. Oh, the food. Cheap prices, especially for the lemonade, means small portions. The sandwiches are apparently pre-dipped, and though they've done a good job with that, I'd like to have been able to dip my own. That particular routine is a baffling one. Despite these gripes, the sandwiches are pretty damn good. The standard beef dip is one you won't regret, and the mutton is a very interesting alternative. The desserts are nice and fatty, and the drinks are rather standard. I haven't tried the breakfasts, but I'm willing to believe they're so-so when so many people seem to think so. I'll revise this if I ever try, since I do have a weakness for french toast. The major, horrible, crippling flaw with this place is the wait time. If you come in here during one of the rush periods, you are in for some sore feet and boredom at the sight of the backs of other peoples' heads. Lines can hit the back wall of a fairly not-even-moderate-sized room and fold across the row of old-fashioned phone booths. You'll find yourself wishing the sawdust on the floor would leap up your ass and explode, just for a change of pace. And seriously, this with almost all of the lines open. This place is BUSY. This also means no elbow room. Private tables do not seem to exist here, so you'll be crammed in at one of many long tables. It's interesting, to say the least. Seriously, eat here at an irregular time. You'll be fine. P.S. They do NOT take credit cards. There's an ATM machine in the main dining area.

The pies are great, and the 10 cent coffee is the best deal (though definitely not the best quality) in town. 蔅ut the sandwiches disappoint. 蔍t's just meat with gravy between some bread for $5-6 a plate, and there are no other accoutrements. 蔜he taste is mediocre at best. Go there for the pie, coffee, and occasional pickled egg. 蔜he non-sandwich menu is very extensive.

The french dip sandwich ain't bad, possibly worth the calories, and thankfully not a huge portion. I was looking around on my tray for an extra cup of dip to actually dip the sandwich in, hence the name french dip, but apparently it's not served that way. They were out of turkey so I had to go with beef. Fat tire on tap is very much appreciated, although I was wary of ordering a glass of one of the higher-priced wines - re-corked for who knows how long? The diner-style desserts did not look very appetizing. 蔖hilippe clearly belongs on the list of places that people love just b/c it's been around so long.

In terms of the french dip sandwiches (which is what this place is supposed to be famous for).. I have DEFINITELY had better. This place could be good for something to do on a weekend but I would not go here thinking you're going to get the best french dip around 'cause its not going to happen. Definitely like the atmosphere, location, fast service regardless of line size, and the awesome rooms upstairs that are so plain I thought I was eating in an insane asylum (seriously cool though). I really hate how they dip the sandwiches for you.. that makes absolutely no sense. I would have definitely bumped this up a star if you were allowed to simply choose how much you want your sandwich dipped (or given the aux jous on the side which is NOT an option). Overrated for sure but.. worth checking out in case you like hopping on bandwagons.

After seeing this place on the food network, I really wanted to try it. Adam Richman from Man vs. Food looked like this was 'the" place to eat if you want a french dip sandwich. So much for tv. I spoke so much about it and even recommended it to my mom as LA's best. Since's she visiting me, we went for dinner. No long line at all. She asked what the sawdust was for... did they forget to sweep or do people throw alot of food on the floor? I told her maybe the cement floor is slick and they don't want people to fall. We ended up getting double dipped beef french dips, a potato salad, macaroni salad and an apple pie. The sandwiches were sooooooooooo salty! And even though it was double dipped, it was still a little dry. I thought maybe I'd get alittle cup of au jus on the side, but I didn't. The potato salad was just ugh! We left that on the plate... the mac salad was ok but only because I was starving! Mom like the apple pie but I can guarantee you mom makes a tastier apple pie! Oh yeah, the main huge turn-off was the homeless guy in the restaurant staring at you while you eat... Yes, I said IN the restaurant... and when you make eye contact to tell him to piss off, 蔴e asks for a $1. Maybe that's cool with the crew at Philippe's but that's totally uncool with me. I can deal with homeless people on the street begging for money but not inside of a restaurant. And the Philippe's staff did nothing about it either - they just let him do his thing and left him alone asking everyone for money. I'll never go back! Forget about this place. It is not LA's best... but if it is then LA's in a world of hurt.

Last year when the Lakers won the championships and had the Laker Parade, we rode the Red Line from the Staples Center to Union Station and we came here to eat. 蔜his year when they won again, we came to Phillippe's and ate here. 蔍t's pretty much a tradition for us now. They do not have waiter service. 蔣ou have to order everything yourself at the counter and bring it over to the table yourself. 蔒ake sure you bring other people with you so they can grab a table. 蔐ast two times we went, we brought plenty of people so they could save us seats. 蔍t's a big place with an upstairs dining area, but room runs out pretty quickly because Phillippe's is always full. We always get the double dipped roast beef sandwiches. 蔜he bread is nice and crusty with the dip soaked into the bread[awesomeness], the roast beef is tender and delicious. But the spicy horseradish mustard is awesome. 蔍 love spicy food, spicy sauces, spicy anything. 蔜his pretty much is the best sauce [on a sandwich] that I have tasted. 蔉or those of you with weak constitutions should not eat this sauce. This mustard will give you a mean kick in the face if you don't handle with care.

My order: Beef sandwich, double dipped with Iced Tea and pumpkin pie. Only waited about 15 minutes and was able to finally make my order :) The sandwich was good. But not as awesome as I thought. Maybe if it was dipped a couple more times? Iced Tea was cheap! 65 cents... who can beat that? Just needed sweetener and it was good to go. Pumpkin pie tasted homemade but with the large amount of whipped cream and barely any pie... I have definitely had better. Overall: 蔐ot of history behind it so gotta check it out. But, will not be visiting again anytime soon.

While I do not normally like lamb, it sure makes for an exquisite French Dip sandwich. 蔍 also love the 9 cent cup of coffee. 蔜his also happens to be one of those special L.A. places where kids are truly at home. �Check out the model trains downstairs before leaving.)

The icing on the cake is that Philippe's is also one of those rare SoCal places that acts as a sign post in the SoCal experience. �It is a period piece, from the waitress uniforms, to the candy stand, to the wooden phone booths from which one expects to see George Reeves, a la Superman, emerge. 蔍t tells us, our kids and grandkids a little bit about life in old L.A.

Cheap, affordable, fills your stomach...gets the job done! I normally get their original beef french dip...double dipped! Along with that, I also order their amazingly delicious cole slaw.

What can I say I love getting a beef double french dip sandwich here with some pickles and the potato salad with a cold coke. Just in case you are wondering this place is so good its always packed with cops and firemen. They always know where to eat! The decor is total dive with train stuff on the walls and wood chips and sawdust on the floor. The place only accepts cash and can be slammed. Be careful the spicy mustard on the tables can be very very spicey. The parking can be tricky but they have two lots and I usually find a space. Since I am not downtown in the day without meal plans I don't get to go here that often.

Maybe I'm missing something here... a palate or two for Phillippes. I've been here a few times. Their soups and sides are good, but I neither see nor taste anything special about the famous French-dipped sandwiches. On a few occasions, the thinly sliced roast beef and turkey were very dry and them being served 'au jus' didn't help either. Historic decor, large communal tables, casual atmosphere is as appealing as it gets.

This is a delicious and wonderful sandwich, folks. 蔛low cooked to be supernaturally tender, a great roll, and a fair price. 蔍 realize that they are celebrated for the traditional French Dip, but the lamb here is delicious with a little bleu cheese on top and some of the peppers (pepperoncini?) make for a great meal. They claim to have invented the French Dip and I don't know how we'd ever prove that, but they've certainly mastered it. My only complaint is Philippe's proximity to Chinatown. 蔣ou can't make someone choose between a perfect French Dip and a whole town of dumplings. 蔍'm only a man, damn it. ONLY A MAN.

I have been here several times now & I wanted to add another star. I never have a bad experience here. It's almost always busy but the wait isn't really that long... so don't let it dissuade you! I came here a week ago with a dozen guys and it wasn't hard to find a seat at all (++) and they absolutely loved it!!!! Everyone that I've taken here has had nothing bad to say. The side of au jus that I complained about before, or lack there of, isn't really necessary. But I have yet to TRIPLE dip. I am all smiles after eating at Philippe's!!

Yep, double dip beef is still really good. 蔇on't go too crazy on the mustard unless you want your nostrils to burn. Eh, what the heck, go crazy. 蔜hat stuff is good. Tapioca pudding's good too, just nothing earth shattering. Come for what you know and be happy.

Had to check out Philippe's before i left town to see what the hype was all about. This place totally dropped the ball. The sandwiches were mediocre at best. I felt bad for bothering my friend to take me all the way out there. But if you do come. Go with the lamb dip. I thought it was better than the roast beef dip. I guess if someone asked me if I've tried Philippe's I can say yes, and it SUCKS sweaty balls! The mustard was BOMB BOMB though.

Over the years I have been here a handful of times. Each time I have wanted to like it more than the last, but sadly I cant say I am all that impressed by the famous "original" sandwiches. I do however find the layout endearing. I fantasize in a sepia fog about men in hats and women wearing gloves from Fante's Los Angeles eating at a place like this. But nostalgic amalgamations alone wont make the sandwiches good. This Saturday was my first time back since the city forced them to shut down for 48 hours this past February as a result of a cockroach infestation. Apparently news of wall to wall roach eggs is not enough to keep the masses away. This place was packed! We were in the neighborhood for the Dodgers game and since the Panda had never eaten here AND Adam from Man vs. Food creamed his plus size jeans over the lamb sandwich, we decided to give it a try. The wait in queue was about 25 minutes. (This place is cash only) 蔜he setup to place an order begs the question: This CANT be the most efficient way to take an order? With only one person working the register??? Really? All the tables in front of the counter cannot be used because of the hordes of people funneled around them. A total waste of valuable seating space. Prices for the sandwiches are fairish for the amount of food you get ($5.75-$6.95). The lamb, which was $6.95 was dry and tough, definitely not worth the extra dollar or so. Cheese and pickles cost extra. Beers were moderately prices and the horseradish mustard at the table which was EXCELLENT, helped make that lamb edible. Better than the mustard was the beef barley soup that cost $2.40. Cabbage, tomatoes, barley, carrots (no beef that I could see) but still! The soup was sooooo good. It was by far the most impressive item on our menu. (watch it be canned soup) I am fairly certain that I will come back to this place again at some point in my life. Probably to bring some out of towner to soak in the local colour. It's an experience, like standing in that hour long line at PINKS or going to Venice Beach to get an ankle henna tattoo or going to Hollywood and Highland to just walk around aimlessly.

I've been coming here often for about 2 years now. Had I known it existed earlier, it would have been for much longer than that. The sandwiches are delicious! I wouldn't call them french dip since you don't dip them in anything, but they are still great. The horseradish mustard is the key ingredient, so make sure you apply it liberally! Deli salads are great and who can argue with 9 cent coffee?! Yes, 9 cents. Lemonade and Iced Tea are only about 60 cents or so as well. This place is a real throwback with a lot of old-LA charm. The wait can sometimes be a little long and you will often have to share bench-style seating. This is truly a Los Angeles landmark that shouldn't be missed, both for the atmosphere and for the food.

I enjoyed a lamb sandwich with blue cheese topped with their famous hot mustard with a side of housemade pickled eggs and pickles. 蔄pple pie was delicious if you like thick and tender pie crust. Great place if you are looking for a mom and pop's sandwich shop to support. 蔍t is not exceptional or fancy, just straightforward and delicious. 蔜hey also have not changed their price for a cup of coffee since they opened-which I think is cute.

This spot always comes to mind when I'm in the downtown area looking for some good food. The place is located a few blocks away from Union Station and Olvera Street. The building is really old with upstairs seating, old benches, nostalgic signs, and wood shavings spread all around. Free parking is located behind the building and across the street. I'm always down for a french dip sandwich, a few cups of lemonade, macaroni salad, pickled beets and some cheesecake....sooooo freakin good. You'll typically walk in and notice multiple long lines. It's ok, just pick one. They move quickly!!! The place only accept cash and has an ATM inside. This joint really draws in the diversity of LA. Drop by for weekday lunch and you'll find a wide variety of people congregated for a common interest. FINAL VERDICT: Food 5/5.....consistently good if you're in the mood for a french dip sandwich. Service 5/5....the ladies have always been very nice and accept tips. Ambiance 5/5....I dig historic eateries with character. If you like new places and exploring LA hot spots, then look no further and drop on by.

Hands down the best French dip. They advertise as the place that originated French dip and I kind of believe them. So good. Try their chili with the French dip. YUMMM!

3 stars: I actually only wanted to give it 2 stars, but this place is like a historical landmark. It is legendary. The vibe and old school decor are really cool! Reason for the missing 2 stars: Huge disappointment due to my high expectation. I read about it on newspaper 7-8 years ago and had been wanting to go there for 7-8 years, so my expectation was extremely high. I thought the $7 Beef Dip is a bit pr icy. It is small and actually not that juicy. I actually like Quizno's Beef Dip better. But again, this place is legendary, I would probably give it another try in the future.

I went to Philippe's and Cole's in the same week to give them both a try, and compare. It seems everyone has an opinion, and a favorite. 蔜he winner in my opinion? **********Drumroll********** Philippe's. Although only for a better french dip sandwich. Cole's had a better ambiance, garlic french fries *and* is 2 doors down from BABYCAKES (cupcakes, desserts). So in summation, if I were going on a date I'd go to Cole's, but to grab a great french dip, Philippe's.

My girlfriend and I went here before the UCLA USC game. Place was busy, they had several lines going and they were all very slow and inefficient. We ordered a pork and a beef dip sandwich, 75 cent lemonade, cup of chili with beans, pickle for a buck, macaroni salad, and a diet Pepsi. The beef dip was tender, I like the hot mustard. But the au jus sauce was bland. Overall, a very bland sandwich. My girlfriend complained of of a gamey smell. Not impressed with the food here, it was good but not worth coming back. Also read about a cockroach infestation here that shut the restaurant down so I'm not sure I will ever return...

My first visit to Philippe left me disappointed. I ordered a beef sandwich and a pickle on the side. Double-dipped with swiss cheese. The sandwich was pretty small... and far from great. The meat was a bit bland and I was genuinely sad that it didn't live up to its hype... at all. The hot mustard was too strong for me. The restaurant itself is big. Was easily able to find a table for our fairly large group. A waiter randomly asked if we wanted a picture taken of us... the highlight of the meal!

First off, I have to say that I can't eat wheat, so I didn't get a sandwich. My husband did, though, and he said it was good but not great. He also had the potato salad, which he said wasn't very good. I had the chicken caesar salad, which I thought was ridiculously priced at $8.15, considering how cheap everything else was (9 cent coffee!). It wouldn't have been so bad if the salad was good. The chicken was cold, wasn't very flavorful and had a bunch of gristle. And the dressing was a little too vinegary and there was a bit too much cheese. I have to say that I like the Burger King chicken salad much better. I also had the beef stew, which unfortunately doesn't come in a cup, just a bowl size. It was overflowing with giant chunks of beef, carrots, and celery. Again, it wasn't bad, but it wasn't good or great. The only thing that was pretty good was the lemonade and the cheesecake, but again, nothing to write home to mom about. What a disappointment. :(

I was in the Downtown LA area with some friends today and someone suggested Phillippe The Original. 蔖arking is conveniently located right across the street and behind the building so its not that bad considering it being in the downtown area. 蔜he restaurant has an nostalgic feel to it, from the outside and right when you first step foot in it (rightfully so since its been around since 1908). 蔍t had many old school photos of trains and Ringling Brother's circus memorabilia. Phillipe is located right on the outskirts of downtown area, close to Chinatown and minutes away from Dodgers stadium. 蔍'm not sure how busy it gets but we got there right after the Dodgers game so it got packed pretty fast. 蔜here were about 6-7 lines with people taking orders, but the lines moved fairly quick. 蔍 ordered a beef french dip sandwich with jack cheese, a pickle and some homemade lemonade. 蔜he woman took my order and prepared it right there so the service was very fast. 蔕verall the sandwich was good but it didn't have the "WOW" factor...oh yeah, the lemonade was great!! Tasted homemade! 蔊reat atmosphere, they had a bunch of beer so perfect spot to hang out after a game! 蔕h yeah, they open from 6am to 10pm and they also serve breakfast! What i spent: Beef French Dip = $5.55 Jack cheese = $0.40 Lemonade = $0.75

I will likely 蔿ose a number of friends because of this review: 蕋he french drip at Philippe is just okay: nothing special. 蔜he beef was tender but overly so and the bread ok. 蔍 was particularly disappointed that the server "pre-dips" your french dip sandwich for you. 蔜he result is that by the time sit down and sit your sandwich is soggy. 蔍 prefer/recommend langers or houstons. Their sandwiches are 15 dollars a pop but definitely worth every penny. �FYI: I have been here twice to formulate this review.

Three words: DOUPLE DIPPED LAMB! You can't go wrong. Add a slice of swiss cheese and you're set. The atmosphere of the place is super cool and old school. Definitely go before the dinner rush because it'll get SUPER packed and a little irritating waiting in line. But definitely look out for a short line because there are more than one. I see people raving and reviewing on the potato salad, but I didn't like it. Too much little stuff and super crunchy. I'm not saying it was nasty, but I should have tried the cole-slaw.

I never cared too much for French Dip sandwiches, but my boyfriend wanted to take me. The Beef French Dip was amazing...it's the bread that's so good. crispy, crunchy so when it soaked up the au jus, it wasn'ttoo soggy...just perfect. the hot mustard was killer!

I think it wins the war for best french dip in LA. �It is almost difficult to compare here with Cole's, they are totally different experiences. 蔍 have come to believe that Cole's gave birth to the sandwich, but Philippe's has maintained the same recipe, and is better. 蔍 like the casual, cafeteria counter style, with sawdust shavings. 蔍 like the cold potato salad, and the added hot mustard sauce is a must. �The price is right as well. �Add swiss or cheddar, and it gets even better. 蔄sked for double dipped if you think the regular is too dry.

Getting really freaking expensive. Long lines and the sandwiches are so small for what they charge. You have to pay extra for each side, lemonades are a little more than a sip and usually you are expected to pay tip. I always get the lamb sandwich with a potato salad with lemonade and a 10 cent coffee. The coffee is only 10 cents because they make money hand over fist for everything else.

OOOOHHHHH MYYYY!!! All I have to say about this place is LAMB and PORK Double Dip! 蔜hese sandwiches are so amazingly good, I am actually bummed I've never tried it before. 蔜he meat is so juicy and flavorful, and the dipped bread just adds more to the flavor. 蔄lthough, I do wish the sandwiches were a tad bit bigger, but now I know I gotta order 2 sandwiches. 蔜he sides are okay, I actually can go without the sides. But I did have a couple of their pickled eggs, and I really liked those. 蔍 do need to WARN you about the "mustard" that they have on all the tables. 蔍t's NOT mustard..it's horseradish sauce. 蔍 made the mistake of putting a lot of it on my sandwich... and OOOOO BOY! 蔠ell, my sinuses cleared up quick! 蔍 love horseradish sauce, but i will say, a little goes a long way. 蔍 think they really do need to put labels on those bottles. �I will advise to go there on a day that you're not in a rush. 蔜he lines are kind of long... but they move quickly. 蔍 absolutely love the set up too, where it's okay for strangers to sit at the same table. 蔜hey also have booth seating as well. 蔅ut I thought it was fun talking to the strangers at our table and laughing about the horseradish sauce. 蔊reat place!

This should be one star, except (a) it's a landmark, and (b) it's dirt cheap. On a Saturday, starting at 3:20 p.m., I stood in line for *40 minutes.* 蔄nd the lines move unevenly, so some people who came in after me got food sooner. The payment system is a big part of the problem. 蔜here's only one server at the end of each line, who not only makes the food but also takes the money. 蔇ue to health regulations, however, the server can't actually *touch* the money. 蔣ou have to put the money on a tray; the server hands the tray to a cashier, where there's a long line (natch), then eventually returns the change on a tray to you. 蔊uys -- how hard would it be to put one server AND one cashier on each line? My French dip was okay, but I've had better. 蔒y beef barley soup contained no visible beef and maybe 12 grains of barley -- it was really cabbage soup. 蔄nd this kind of food demands French fries, but they're not on the menu (even though they do serve hash browns at breakfast). But the worst part is that the room I ate in was full of dirty dishes and trays, and it was not cleared *at all* during the 40 minutes I was actually eating. 蔍 had to shove a bunch of trays together to make room to put mine down. 蔜hen I had to look at the trays all through my meal. 蔣uck.

I used to come here for my beef dip before I discovered Cole's. No comparison. Cole's has the better quality and quantity of beef in their sandwiches. It's like night and day. Then there are the small things that make a big difference. One example: The piping-hot au jus at Cole's is served separately, so you still get a nice crunch of the french bread just as it soaks up the meaty juice. They aren't able to accomodate that at Phillipe's. I can't hate too much though. I've been coming here for years. Give it a try if you've never been. But for the price you're paying, Cole's is the better option.

So i kept hearing about this place. People telling me "If you live in LA you gotta try Phillpe's." . Seeeing as i live in the LA area i guess i had to go try it. My friend and i just left a taping of the tonight show and i was starving so i decided since i was going to drive by downtown i should try this place out. this was my experience... I walk in and i was happy to see i came at the right time since there wasnt a very long line. I go up to order And i asked for the beef sandwich double dipped with swiss cheese. I sit down and take a bite it was really really good. Then i look at the sandwich and realizes i was so excited to be there I didn't notice how small the thing is i took one bite and it was 1/4 gone! then i start to realize i just paid over 10 bucks for this tiny thing! i finished the thing in less than i minute and by the end i was left still hungry. I was upset i really was looking forward to this place. I mean the food was good but not worth the price and their sides didn't interested me at all. I gave it a 3 but trust me when i say i was close to giving it a 2 because of the bad experience.

I was sent to LA for business trip, and I know that one of my goals was to make it to Philippe's for a French Dip. So after my shift I headed out on the Metro towards Union Station, and about 30 minutes later I was ordering a tasty as heck sandwich. The meat was tender, the bread was fantastic, and while not the best French Dip I've ever had it was high up on the list. The one thing that did knock me out of the park was the mustard. That stuff is like tasty napalm that just continues to deliver spicy flavor long after you've finished your sandwich. In fact I liked the mustard so much that I bought four jars to take home with me to Atlanta. Sadly once I run out of precious mustard, no sandwich will taste as good until I purchase more.

Don't get me wrong these sandwiches are awesome. Single-dip is good, double-dip is infinitely better but it does make the sandwich a little moist. You must try their mustard. Just squirt a little on the bite you're about to take and experience the sinus clearing goodness of Philippe's mustard. A couple of things upset me: #1 The Wait. Everyone wants to get a piece of quintessential Los Angeles here. The lines are rarely short and depending on your luck, could cost you a while before you actually get to order. (-1 star) #2 Angry Cashier Lady Who Decided To Be A Jerk. Granted it was during a busy time. My friends and I split our group into two hoping that whoever reached the front first would be able to order the food, a reasonable plan right? WRONG! It was obvious another line was going to be first and after giving our money to the guy standing in that line the worker decided we had cut the people in back of him. It took a yelling match for them to finally agree to take our order. By the time all this had gone down I was extremely hungry and irritable and not pleased with my experience...(-6 stars for her) All-in-all the food is good and we probably got a cashier who was having a rough day. Unfortunately, that still detracts from the experience.

I'm gonna go with tourist trap. Took a group of 5 or 6 of us and we didn't think it was that impressive. Kinda bummer though because we had high hopes after watching it on television and thinking it was gonna be amazing. I will give them points for their mustard sauce though. Amazing. I didn't like the unorganized random lines at the deli counter. They also only accept cash but there is an ATM machine nearby. I think its that maybe my taste buds are not that enthusiastic about a soggy sandwich that i rate it only 3 stars.

Honestly, what's the big deal with this place? I waited 20 minutes in line for lunch for just a mediocre sandwich? I'm pretty sure I was in the slowest line too, which didn't make things any better. WAY overrated.

The sandwiches are inexpensive. 蔜his is nice until you see how small they are. The sandwiches are also dry. 蔋ow can a sandwich dipped in au jus be dry? 蔜his confuses me. The only reason I was able to finish the bland sandwich: I cleverly added the side of cole slaw as a condiment, adding a nice tang and crunch. They may have originated the French Dip, but even Quizno's version is better. Shit, Arby's is better. Now I'm off to try Cole's.

I hate downtown LA, but I don't mind Phillipe's! �We lucked out yesterday with short lines (maybe a 5 minute wait), ordered a ham sandwich with Jack cheese and mac salad with iced tea. The glasses are small, so I should have ordered 2 glasses especially after adding their spicy mustard (horseradish) to it! It hurts so good! On the way out the lines were through the door.

With so many reviews for the Famous Phillippe 蔲rench dip sandwiches, it's hard to say anything with added value. 蔄nyone who comes here will get a deliciously moist meat sandwich on some good french bread. If you're looking for further satisfaction, get a slice of their coconut cream pie. 蔆reamy and light, topped with shaved coconut on a flaky crust. 蔊ood stuff!

in my bf's words - thanks for writing the review for me babies: I went for the first time with my g/f cause she wanted to go there so damn bad so i said ok whatever lets check it out sounds good. We get there the place looks like a dump/soup kitchen.Are u kidding me 4 stars for what?We start to order ii got the turkey and my g/f got the beef 蔭nd everything we ordered we said to go. The bitch gives it us for there wtf.The sandwiches were ok but taste like the ones i make, just plain. I mean if the place didn't look like a soup kitchen, literally half the people in there looked like homeless people,and if the people that worked there weren't spaced out of their mind I'd give this place a 3, food wasn't all that bad.FYI the lemonade is the best thing there some of the best i've ever tasted.

Hello there big boy french dip! We jumped at the chance to get some groupons for Philippe's--an alarmingly large meal for $5 and some change. 3 double-dipped beef french dips, beef stew bowl, macaroni salad, potato salad, cole slaw, and a chili bowl. I needed some more oomph in my sandwich so I added a big of that awfully powerful horseradish, which strangely became addicting, and a spoonful of greasy, dripping oily cheese with every bite. All that gulped down with a refreshing sip of ice cold iced tea. We could've done without the sides--simple and familiar but not quite necessary and homey. Service is a bit slow since one lady at each register single-handedly prepares the meal. My lady walked away for a bit and started a little chat party with some other ladies as I sat there, waiting and thinking, "Where in the world is Ms. Philippe?" I don't mind Ms. but I'd like my dip asap or my expectations might just take a big downward dip towards disappointment. Just sayin'. Got my huge filling of landmark fame and celebrity but kind of like Hollywood, a whole lot of flash and smiles but not enough substance and unique, heartfelt value. With all that said, I walked out the door with my bigger booty saying Good Bye!

Obviously, any place with 70 people ahead of you gathered into 5 impatient lines is going to give you unrealistic expectations about how good your food is going to be. 蔍t also doesn't help when your grandfather waxes poetic about how he and the railroad workers and the collared business types used to all eat French Dip together at this place back in the 1930's. 蔄ctually, when I first heard him talk about it, I figured Philippe was just one of those places he always tells me about that always turns out to have been closed for fifty years. Not so, of course. 蔐ocated at the confluence of Chinatown, downtown, and at the edge of Olvera St., Philippe is clearly from another era, but still manages to look as though it belongs. 蔋ardworking ladies head each long line, where they take orders, make sandwiches, and handle money all at the same time. 蔜he lines snake through long benches where the lucky ones who have already received their food sit, inhaling their sandwiches and avoiding being clunked in the head by errant purses. So it's a cool place. 蔄nd the food? 蔎ust fine, no more, no less. 蔠e took two sandwiches home for my grandparents and kept one to share. 蔈ven though I prefer pork or lamb, we ordered beef, because why mess with tradition? 蔕rdering lamb would have been like ordering doner kebab at a Vietnamese restaurant (yes, I have seen it offered). 蔜he whole sandwich effect was grayish and soggy, dulled by the au jus, but it tasted a little better than it looked. 蔄n acceptable amount of meat, a crazy huge amount of bleu cheese, and crusty bread combined to definitely need the delicious hot mustard that came separately with it. My grandparents loved it just as much as they did in the 30's. 蔜he fact that Philippe has been around for 100 years - and that people who went there 70 years still like it - says much more about it than I could hope to say in a one-off review. �Let's just leave it here: I'm glad that Philippe exists, and I wish it continued existence in the future; however, I personally can't actually recommend that anyone eat their sandwiches.

Make it past the Road Rage in the Parking lot and the Long lines in the store and you will be rewarded with a unique and tasty dinning experience. Had heard about the place from friends and from MvF on the Travel Channel. Is the place worth the Hype? In my humble opinion...Yes! You know about the long lines and the long tables you have to share with strangers and the saw dust on the floor. However if you want to go there and you don't want to look like a first timer...don't try to hand your CASH money directly into the hands of your 蕇erver! 蔖ut your Money in the cash tray as your server is not allowed to touch money because she is preparing your food with her hands. Have been there 3 times and have had the beef, pork, and lamb sandwiches all double dipped. The Au jus is the secret ingredient that separates Philippes sandwiches from the rest of the boys. Arbys can only hang their heads in shame as they have to submerge their beef in cheddar cheese to make up for the savory flavor only a well crafted, slow cooking au jus can deliver. �The menu is vast, have not made but a small dent in the giant menu board hanging from the wall. I have tried both the macaroni and potato salad and I have to admit that to this day it is the best potato salad that I have ever tried. I usually get the lemonade which is nothing I would consider special or great. The Hot mustard at the tables is something that completes the sandwiches but should be poured with warning and precaution. Best Kept Secret: The Hot mustard sauce! Forget the Tapatio and the Wasabi...this sauce packs a punch to your nasal passages that can only make the creators of Vick's Vapor-rub blow their noses in shame. Buy yourself a bottle at the souvenir desk to take home and add to your daily sandwich routine to give your lunch a much needed kick!

The must ultimate of ultimate L.A. food experience. 蔍t's crowded all the time, the lemonade is just "o.k." and you're in line for awhile. 蔋owever, you get a lot for the buck there. 蔜heir French Dip totally melts in your mouth. 蔇uring my last visit there, I tried the pork sandwich and that too was great. �A couple of visits back on an LA road trip, I told my lone passenger we're grabbing dinner there. She was not too enthused: Her: That's all they have, JUST sandwiches? Me: Pretty much. Her: Well, then could we go somewhere else? Me: NO She sulked all the way to the line, and God only knows what was going through her head when she saw the sawdust on the floor. 蔄fter the first bite of her sandwich, the conversation went like this: Her: Y'know what?

Holy crap, people...107 reviews? 蔊ood lord. 蔄lright, after the initial shock, i will write on.. I was going to review with 3 stars just because it's a sandwich place. But this isn't just any sandwich place. 蔍t's an LA landmark. Flash back to simpler times when downtown was thriving, old theaters were a-glow and Hollywood glamor was simply, well glamor. This place is always packed, so you know it's not just the novelty that keeps them coming back. 蔕rder any kind of french dip, lamb, beef, turkey and make sure to try the killer spicy mustard. 蔅ut beware, it's freakin' HOT. 蔠ash the heat down with a mini cafeteria glass of lemonade and some mac salad. �I'm hearing from fellow yelpers that the sandwiches are small. 蔍n keeping with the "back to simpler times" theme, sandwiches were probably that small back in the day, which is why we didn't have a crazy obesity rate in this country in 1940(ish). 蔛o maybe it's not the small sandwich at Philippe's, but the monstrosities everywhere else!

The best sandwich on the West Coast hands down. I can't believe my recent trip was my first in over a decade. Back in high school my buddies and I used to ditch school and drive 25 some odd miles to hit up Phillipes. There is so much history associated with Phillipes. There are conflicting stories but apparently this place created the first french dip. I believe it, because the food is so bomb. Seeing as how I am not as carnivorous as I was ten years ago I ordered the Tuna dip (just as bomb). The best part is the 75 Lemonade. EPIC Harry may have met Sally at Katz deli but.... Bread met Butter at Phillipes!

After beaching it in Malibu, the ride back down led us to the city of Los Angeles and decided to hit a famous spot known to have started the French Dip Sandwich. Apparently, its so famous that locals and Dodger fans packed the place as if these sandwiches were gold. However, after waiting almost an half an hour or more in line. I received the highly anticipated, highly rated, and highly praised French Dip with an order of lemonade and a slice of pecan pie. Before I left the counter I asked if I could get more gravy for the sandwich and I was refused to be given some and then ignored. The lady at the counter just simply asked the next person in line for their order. Completely disappointed at that point. Especially with the ridiculous wait in line, the weird sight of hay or newspaper shreddings on the ground, and having service completely dissatisfied. Overpriced for the quality and amount. The taste of the sandwiches were salty and dry. I felt the sandwich was never even dipped. I doubt that I would ever return. Especially being strongly disappointed with service and quality of my french dip that I highly expected to taste as well as others had mention. I feel there are better places with quality and quantity. The hype definitely overrated Philippe's, yes original but amazing, no.

LOVE these dips! I always get the beef dip with Swiss...but I decided to switch it up a bit this week and I got the pork with Swiss, double dipped!!! mmm, mmm, mm!!!! SO GOOD! The house made pickles are fresh, crisp and awesome and the spicy mustard (which you can purchase by the jar) is SPICY and perfect for the dips! LOVE THIS PLACE and the prices are great 6 bucks for pork sand, 60 cents for cheese and 75 cents for lemonade...cant beat that!

So i walk into this place thinking i get a sandwich and a side of dip to dip it in. turns out they do everything for you. the location is very original which gives it this nice history feeling once you walk in. the line is crazy but they are very busy. 4 people taking orders and still was not enough. Once i took a bit of that sandwich everything made sense on why its so busy. it was just a wonderful experience overall. the flavors of the sandwich all come together specially if you tell them to double dip it. FYI: try the mustard at your own Risk..

Episode 2 in my "Old School LA Eateries Trilogy" I love this place. 蔍've been coming here since way before I lived in LA, when my friends and I would make special occasion trips out to the big city for some wet and juicy beef dips. First of all, this place has no choice but to be put in the Old School Eatery Trilogy - it's one of the oldest restaurants in LA. 蔍t shows too. 蔜here's sawdust on the floor, walk up cafeteria-style counters to order at, as well as long tables with bench seating so that you're forced to sit amongst the fellow patrons and be social (like people did in the olden times). Obviously, the draw of this place is the French dips. 蔜hey've got beef, turkey, pork and, I think, octopus. 蔄lso, don't be afraid to order a side to go along with your dip(s) (I always get a scoop of macaroni salad). 蔜hen bring your sammich back to your table and slop on the hot horseradish mustard to clean your sinuses out. 蔇ee-fuckin'-lish! This is one of those places that just screams history as well as a big city-vibe. 蔜here's always all types of various people sitting around, stuffing their faces and shooting the shit. 蔎ust as much fun to eat there as it is to people watch. One more thing: 蔜he lady you order from at the counter also makes your sandwich. 蔠hen it's time to pay, put your money on the little tray she'll hand you. 蔛he'll take it to the cashier and then bring your change back on said tray. 蔜ake your change, but not without leaving your lady a tip. 蔕therwise, you'll get the evil eye. 蔎ust sayin'.

I don't understand the hype for this place.... The roast beef french dip was kinda messy (the bread just fell apart), kinda bland and what is with the overcooked beef? i like my french dip kinda pink with a side of al ju sauce. This sandwich was just dipped, maybe I should just asked for a side of sauce. It didnt impress me. The cheese was just ok but not melted on the sandwich, the mustard they have there is wayyy to spicy. Eh, I've had better french dips at BJ's or Togos.

Been coming here since I was a kid, and I STILL get a kick at all of the old pictures on the walls, the little, old ladies that make your sandwiches, and the sawdust on the floors. I don't care what anyone says...I love french dips and this place makes a darn good one! 蔜he only thing that has changed is that the sandwiches cost more, and have less meat, but pay no mind - it's worth it.

Trying to figure out how to review a place so famous, that has been reviewed by 139 yelpers and counting. I'll dive in and make it 140... I thought my review should primarily be about the food. What good is history if the food's terrible? So I imagined, what if Philippe were a place down the street that had just opened, rather than an LA institution that's been around almost 100 years. What would I think then? I think I would like it. Quite a bit. And I would go there often. The beef dip is simply better than any roast beef sandwich I've had west of Kelly's Roast Beef in Revere Beach, MA. Probably the closest around here is the brisket sandwich at Tommy Pastrami NY Deli on Harbor in Costa Mesa. An excellent sandwich. But Philippe's is leaner and more tender and more consistent. It could be larger, but it's always good, fairly generous and a decent value. The variety of meats is a plus, though I'm not actually sure I've tried any of the others because the beef is so good. Few places can compare with the huge array of sides and desserts. A few of my favorites are the mac salad, chili with beans, and tapioca pudding. All are really good. But there are soups, salads, beets, pickled pigs feet, custard, cakes, pies. The wide variety of the menu makes me think of a place like Jerry's Famous Deli, which has an even wider menu but whose food is largely pedestrian. Philippe's does a lot but does it all very well. If Philippe's were a local place that had just opened, faced with a decision between four and five stars, I think I'd have to go for five. There's just not that much room for improvement. Given the history, the consistency, there's no question, I have to give it full marks.

Went here with a group of friends on a Saturday... it turned out that day was one of the anti-prop 8 march days, so the streets we took to get to the place were crazy. In either case, we finally got to the place and ordered. I think people hype it up a bit much. And I think much of the hype is generated from the fact that this is a "blue collar" type of place... most people who hype it up are white collar folks who seemingly go in with that cheap commodity mindset. Anyway, I got the French Dip, dipped twice as recommended, with two different meats (beef and pork). If it weren't for the double dip, the meat would have been *much* drier than it already was. Also had lemon meringue pie (decent) on the side and an arnold palmer (which was too sour and bland). Not bad but not great. If I were in the area, eh, maybe I'd stop by. Otherwise, I would take the effort to make the trip.

French Dip sandwiches in Los Angeles? The only place to go would be Philippe the Original. I don't eat a lot of beef (sorry if I've offended anyone ^.^) so if your like me they have plenty of options to choose from. I had the turkey, double-dipped with spicy mustard. I have only one thing to say..AMAZING!! The lines may seem over-whelming but they move fairly quick. The ladies behind the counter know what they are doing. They have a breakfast menu also, but to be quite honest, I think I'll be going back for their dips more than anything.

This place screams "vintage L.A." from a mile away. It has the feel of an old deli, and the mixed crowd of tourists, L.A. natives and homeless people gives it that one-of-a-kind atmosphere. As you might expect - the french dip here is amazing. I haven't been to Cole's, so I can't compare, but the aus ju here is just so good - I'd recommend a "double dip" for the uninitiated. The simple nature of this place is what makes it fun, and you get a lot of food for your money. One recommendation - order some pie! It's tasty, and often overlooked since everyone comes for the french dip.

Every time when I am craving a nice bowl of Corn Chowder (on a Wednesday) I come here for a bowl. It is absolutely delicious. My favorite sandwich on the menu is the Turkey Sandwich with Swiss and the au jour on the side (I like to dip my own sandwich). This place has a really rustic feel to it and the decor is pretty simple. But you know what, I like this place and I am most definitely gonna come back and bring my friends too.

New to Los Angeles. New to owning a car again. New to LA 蕋raffic. Not new is the New York attitude toward sitting in said traffic. New to cheating and failing to avoid the traffic by finding side streets to get around Dodger game traffic. Not new to illegal maneuvering in new car ala New York crazy driver style. Almost and hour and a half later coming from Hollywood i turn to my close friend visiting from NY, "This better be some kickass dip sandwich! Taking suggestions from 'Man vs. Food' better be worth it or you're paying for my lunch." (She's cute, my NY friend. She writes down everything. This time she wrote down all the latest episodes of the show and of all the attractions in LA, she had to cross off eating at Philippe's from her bucket list because Adam said so.) Never trust the GPS around Dodger stadium, oh no. Double dip pork sandwich with jack cheese, split the coleslaw and split a heaping bowl of bean-less chili with cheddar and onions on top. Oh, and a cold Fat Tire on tap to top it all off. Slather on some hot mustard and you've got the kick of a wasabi-like sting in your nose. Soooo good! Both our affects changed immediately upon first bite. (Actually, it began in line when I started singing the "Chips" theme song in earshot of the motorcycle cops in the adjacent line.) i turned to my NY friend and said, "Sonia, I'm buying YOUR lunch!" Always trust a TV host, oh yes.

I'm sorry but I had the lamb, the beef, and the turkey at this famous establishment and was not blown away. I think perhaps in the past when service was under 30 seconds per customer and the sandwiches were piping hot things were a whole lot different than my lukewarm, dry, yes dry double dipped sandwiches. You'll have to smother your sandwich in cheese in order to get tremendous flavors that you expect from a beef sandwich here. I did enjoy their homemade tapioca pudding and gave a nice nod of approval when I took a taste of their homemade apple pie. The crust of the pie left much to be desired but the apples were perfect. I just expected a whole lot more for the hype and wait. Nevertheless this is an affordable alternative to a SUBWAY or Quizno's but not something my mouth is going to watering for...

Philippe's makes the perfect beef dip, that's all there is to it. 蔍 mean, it makes sense, right? 蔜hey've only been making dips since 1908. 蔍f they haven't perfected by 2007, I'd be a little worried. It's not piled on too thick, nor do they "subway" the beef either... just the right amount. 蔜he amount of au jus on the sandwich is pretty much on point as well. 蔜he size if the sandwich is great too, as you don't feel like your pregnant after finishing your meal. �Try it with a side of potato salad. 蔜heir lemonade is almost as perfect as their beef dips. �If you like a little kick to your food, try it with a dollop of the tableside hot mustard. The line to order your food is a little hectic though. 蔜here are like, 6 different lines going on at once. 蔜here's no sense of organization at all with the lines. 蔍t's pretty much a cattle herd, especially during lunch time. 蔕nce you finally get to the counter and order your meal, it's smooth sailing from that point on. They have a little tiny convenience store type deallie right by the door too. 蔄fter your meal you can buy a pack of gum or some lemonheads, depending on what kinda mood you're in. Overall, I would definitely recommend this place to anyone that considers themselves a beef dip connoisseur. 蔖lus, it's a historical LA landmark, so you can make a field trip out of your meal as well. 蔖hilippe's beef dips are very delicious! 蔍t truly is the most perfectly crafted beef dip.

Yummy and no frills. The wait is long and the meat is tough, but they serve up decent dipped sandwiches. The appeal is that it's "the original." If I lived closer, I'd be here at least once a week to have my brain stung by the hot mustard and laugh at all the other people who make funny faces after eating the mustard.

MEDIOCRE FOOD & OLD-FASHIONED / OLD-SCHOOL There was nothing great that stood out with Phippe's. On my book it ranks slightly lower against East Side Market/Sandwiches. What makes Philippe's popular is it's long history and reputation. This place is old-fashioned, with most of it's customers just as old. Going with my family and friends, we were the youngest group there--me being 22, and everyone else around the same age. Phillipe's isn't the place you would go to watch a football game, 蔲or one reason: there is only one 30-40 inch TV screen. Although this screen can be seen from L-style dining area, the TV isn't big enough to enjoy a viewing experience. Sitting on stools, dealing with the lack of sanity, and weird smells is part of the experience, but it isn't particularly appealing to mine. It is common to leave your trash on the table after you eat, and it is just as common for the clean-up crew to take their time to clean the tables. I had to stack up the trash and push it to the edge of the table so there would be room to eat. On my plate was the turkey sandwich, which isn't anything spectacular. I've had better sandwiches in my life. I also had a chance to try to potato salad and the macaroni salad, but there was not anything special about that either. On a brighter note, the apple pie and banana cream pie were given good reviews by my family and friends. Hope that helps, and sorry if this review seemed so negative.

So my boyfriend was talking about this place and finally took me over the week. I heard it was really famous and a L.A landmark, the original French dip. I went on a Thursday night, so it wasn't packed at all. I hear the lines go all the way out the door. I'm a big fan and will start to come here more often. I got the beef dip, coleslaw, potato salad and chili. Yummmm, Coleslaw was kinda of plain, but the chili was really good. The portions are actually quite small (compared to most places), but it was perfect for me since I get full easily. If your a big eater, I would recommend that you get extra sides or another dip. I think it was about $5 for a sandwich. The lemonade/ice tea was cost under a buck!

umm..I guess this place is what it is. 蔍 was expecting more since I had just been to Langers the day before. 蔍 got the beef sandwich which was fine. 蔍 didn't think it was anything special. 蔍f I worked within walking distance, I'd probably go again, but this was a car trip from my office, so it was not worth it. �We thought the horseradish sauce was mustard, so a couple of my comrades doused their sandwiches in it. 蔖retty hilarious!

Don't be intimidated by the long ass lines, they have their strategy down! I don't need to talk about the sandwiches here because you know they're already good.. but man oh man...

DAMN GOOD FRENCH DIP! I wasn't sure what to get until I saw them pull out the huge lamb shank! When I saw them carve the fatty and juicy meat, I was sold! I got the DOUBLE-DIPPED LAMB ($6). The bread doesn't get soggy at all and the meat is so succulent. I also had the POTATO SALAD and COLE SLAW, which was top-notch. I'm coming back for the pork dip and a blueberry pie!

There are something's you just don't mess with. 蔖hilippe The Original Restaurant is one of those things. 蔜his is an LA institution, and supposed home of the French Dip. I love eating food that has a history and even better in a place that has history... it builds character. 蔖hilippe has been around since 1908 and rumored to have started the French Dip by accidentally dropping the bread into some au jus and BAM it turned into an overnight sensation and a LA mainstay ever since. 蔜oday the place is not too far from the original, long communal tables, lunch style counter with chaotic ordering, policemen (and women), city hall politicians, judges, lawyers, business people and tourists alike pack into this random building on a corner in Chinatown. �I like my sandwich juicy, so there's single dip, dub dip, and straight up wet. 蔜he beef is tasty with blue cheese but I prefer the lamb which is shaved off the bone in chunks and is tender and juicy, and amazing with the housemade spicy, spicy, spicy mustard. 蔐ove the macaroni salad that goes with. 蔛trike up a convo with the people around you and you got a perfect mix of good food with good people. 蔍t's places like this that define a city. 蔍s Philippe's the best sandwich or french dip i've ever had... probably not, but it brings some charm, some culture, and some personality to an otherwise big hurried city that is LA.

SO MANY MEMORIES HERE! 蔍 remember coming here with my parents, and them telling me story of coming there with their parents as we sit in a nostalgic second floor dining room with the bricks inscribed with people's messages. 蔜his is a classic must go place if you're in downtown LA. 蔠hile they are known for beef dips...those are good...but the pork dip is way better. 蔔o need for cheese...the sandwich melts in your mouth. 蔋ave it with a side of beef stew and a pickle, don't add any mustard that they have at the table or else you'll have an experience like my fiance did...lmao...

I had watched Man vs Food and they spotlighted Philippe's. I did not know anything about Philippe's prior to the show. I was sold! I went here yesterday with my boyfriend and we were both enthralled we were going to try the famous Philippe's. We walk-in and was surprised with the lines. I thought we beat lunch traffic. We ordered two beef dips, one lamb sandwich, a pickle, and cole slaw. The beef was tender and the bread was really good. I got it dipped once. The spicy mustard stood up to its name. It was sinus clearing, make your eyes water, spicy. Thats how I like it!! I am not a lamb eater, but I was daring and decided to take a bite of my bfs. It was definteley a great surprise! The lamb was very flavorful. The coleslaw was good, nothing out of this world. The pickle was super crunchy! I love the history of the place and would definitely come back!! Yummy beef dip sandwich! And we bought a mustard to take home.. �)

Seeing as I am on my french dip craze at the moment and that I spend quite a bit of time dreaming of Philippe's and LC's (Lion's Choice) sandwiches, I thought I should add this to my reviewed restaurants list. Philippes is a gem. It's always hustle'n bustle inside, and the sandwiches, though not a hands down favorite, are pretty damn good. The place has been around for forever. It has character, and the crowd is diverse. The last time I stopped through, there were Dodger's fans everywhere. It's really tough to repeat this experience in other cities, so in my mind, this place kind of is LA. ...That is, the LA without the maddening glamour and glitz. A little bit on Philippe's can be found in wikipedia... Take a second to look it up. It's wery wery interlesting... Phillippe's is cheap. Don't go in there expecting some fancy meal. I will consider you a 'tard if you try Philippes for the first time while on a date. So yeah, your food is served on paper plates. It's also important to note that everyone orders the french dip sandwiches. It's their specialty. If you're not a fan of french dip sandwiches, you'll probably dislike this place. And worse yet... You'll be like my friend who hates cheese but sometimes suggests pizza for lunch. ...her search to fulfill her appetite is destined to failure, if you ask me. You should know what you're going to order before you get to the cashier, b/c you're in and out with your order very fast. ...It's all business when you're 1st in line. Expect to wait in line at least 15 minutes. I've never seen this place empty. Park across the street in the lot on the south/ west side. Or be a little healthy and walk from a few blocks away. It's def. worth it. Out of 10 (10 being the best, 5 average) Decor: 8 (it's a blast to the past) Food: 8 Service: 4

This is one of the those OG historical landmarks of LA. I remember first hearing about this spot on the TRAVEL CHANNEL and always wanted to go. The location is pretty shady in the dirty part of CHINATOWN but the inside is like a bus station or train station interior. The best sandwhich for me was the Pork Sandwhich mad tasty! I give this place a 4 stars for being legendary and OG and all that. I would give it a 5 star but the lines were way too long and the cashier was not that patient in taking my big order so I ended up having to cut it short to make sure she got it all. I also think they only take cash too which kinda sucks as well.

Bf's friend took us here for lunch. Apparently its bombass to him... the foos never even been here before! First step in, almost felt like a NY pub. Unorganized. Pretty much you can cut someones who been waiting for half a hour by moving a few feet over. (Our bad dudes, us newbs got lucky) Ordered the beef. Sat on stools. Ate on cafeteria-like tables. Lemonade couldve been better. Same w/ ice tea. Potato salad was alright. & cockroach infestation? I wouldnt be surprised if a few of them lingered behind in the kitchen still or swam in the au jus. All in all... this felt like... high quality cafeteria food. Or this could be bombass food like the homie said... but served within jail. My bf knows -_- Well thats what i get for eating non-asian food in Chinatown. & thanks for the most weirdest airy stomach feeling afterwards. Felt like Dragon Ball Z action was going on inside... air being pushed all over the place... SUPER SAIYAN!

The OG place.... Well lilo and I were thinking what to do for lunch before a Dodger Game... We decided to try this place since we pass it almost everyday and never been in there.. We parked and walked inside through the side door and noticed a big counter with a bunch of people standing on what I figured were lines. We waited in separate lines to see who would get to the counter first. Lilo won and we began to order. She ordered a The Beef Dip, macaroni salad, a pickle and Iced tea I noticed pickled eggs in a purple juice. It really got my attention. I was thinking it was "Jamaica" juice, but I asked and was told it was BEET JUICE. I ordered one with the LAMB DIP, ColeSlaw, A jar of Mustard and a 16oz Stella. We tried to figure out where to sit cause the lines of people were right behind the people sitting at the tables eating. I didn't want to be smelling someones ass while I was trying to enjoy my DIP... SO we luckily sat at the very end of a table with no asses rubbing on our backs. Lilos BEEF DIP was waaaay better than my lamb. her Macaroni salad "was all right" my ColeSlaw was good, especially with the pickled purple egg mixed in it. Turned everything purple... Cool!! The Mustard was greeeeat. It was all horse radish with a splash of Grey Pouppon... The experience was OK... Lots of tourists and white folks, a few Mexicans including some tacky ones. It was a big melting pot of people. Nothing fancy or exciting about this place Just a good sandwich.... Try it!! See what all the fuss is about! GL3

This place is great just cause it's so old and they still have coffee for like, 45 cents. The menu is packed, and although hard to read, it has a wide variety of stuff. I'm not a big fan of soggy bread, so the first time I came here I didn't really enjoy the sandwich. The second time I came back and got the sandwich without the dip and it was really good. Beer prices were awesome too!

It's the BEST FRENCH DIP SANDWICH ever!!! I used to work within walking distance of Phillippe's so I used to come here for lunch quiet often. I recommend getting either the Beef or Lamb Sandwich with Lemonade and a Brownie. The brownie is AWESOME!! Pro: The best sandwich I've ever had, lemonade was only $0.75, $0.09 in-house coffee Con: Always long lines (it never dies, no matter what time you go), wasn't very filling (but who cares.. it was an awesome meal)

I LOVE Philippe's When I'm in L.A, I ALWAYS make it a point to have lunch at Philippe's. Phillipe's brings you back to a simpler time when we didn't require our "own" table, when we didn't mind sitting at a table with strangers where we might even share some great conversation or get a section of the newspaper from our lunch neighbor to read. It's simple but delicious food, served in a cafeteria type setting which very much agrees with LOTS of people because it's crowded at Philippe's ALL the time so they must be doing something right. That all being said it's basic, delicious and if I lived in L.A. or the L.A. area I would be sure to visit Philippe's at least once a week - 2 double dipped beef sandwiches, a lemonade, potato salad and slice of cheesecake - YUM! If you want to "people watch" for beautiful people or are expecting something fancy then Philippe's isn't for you but otherwise you're going to have a great lunch experience. I will say though that the last time I was at Philippe's I had a customer in line next to me strike up a conversation as we were both waiting for our Cheesecake and it was John Michael Higgins from "Best in Show" among other movies and the NBC TV show "Kath & Kim" which took me aback but was a cool experience. I give Philippe's all 5 stars baby! LOVE those sandwiches! and also love that I can then walk to Olvera street and wander around a bit at all the vendors there.

What the heck is all the fuss about? My man and I got the classic beef dip. We ADORE beef dips and get them everywhere we go. Overpriced, not that big of portions, and already premade. They don't even give you a side of au jus. I understand this is an LA "institution", but now I think they are just praying on clueless people coming in just for the name. Didn't dig the cafeteria vibe either. Cash only, so be prepared. The mustard was awesome though. Didn't try anything else...it all didn't look too exciting. Decent parking for the area and cheap beer. Super crowded. Wear your Dodger gear!! No need to come back. Eat at the game instead.

Only been to Philippe's twice but think it's pretty darn good-- great really. They make a pretty mean French dip and it's especially enjoyable to devour one at the place where they (supposedly) originated (the other disputed French Dip originator is Downtown at P.E. Cole's Buffet). You can order the Dip in beef, turkey, lamb, pork, ham... The prices are good too (about $5 for most sandwiches, $.60 for the house lemonade and iced tea and one thin dime for a coffee!). Plus, a bevvy of salads, soups, chili, sides etc. that I couldn't completely list here. What seals the deal is that the atmosphere is so great. Long community tables with stools, a huge steel display/ordering counter, and the neat feeling of a simple blue-collar eatery from an era gone by. The lines are long but move quickly. I can't imagine anyone disliking a visit to Philippe the Original. If you are a foodie in the LA area with a penchant for nostalgia, do yourself a favor and visit Philippe's... and don't forget the house "mustard" (which should more accurately be called horse radish) on your Dip.

This is an L.A. institution that is not self-aware. It is just doing what it does - make darn good french dip sandwiches. The pies are fabulous too. And the coffee is 9 cents.

I like this place despite the other reviews. 蔅eing that my husband is a fan of sandwiches, we decided to give it a try. 蔜here's plenty of parking and if you need to park on the street, you'll get more minutes for your quarter than most places in downtown. 蔠hen you go in, don't expect anyone to tell you to go straight to the counter to order. 蔣ou'll just recieve stares just as much as the patrons there. 蔜hat, "Oh, they must be new because they seem confused" look. �I ordered the turkey dip sandwich, mac salad and potato salad. 蔠hile my husband ordered the beef with a green salad and my kids (they already ate lunch) ordered a pie. 蔍 have to say, the food is pretty good! 蔞ery tasty too. 蔍f I have to complain it would be that the prices are too high for the portions that they serve. �By the way, the pies are really good. 蔍 think I found my new favorite pie place too. 蔍t doesn't have that sour taste after each bite. 蔒y kids liked it so much they asked to order a second slice.

WTF do you think you should order? the french dip... which one you ask? Order 1 of each. I personally like the Lamb but my buddy likes the beef... and my other friend likes the cockmeat french dip... so it's your preference. Order the CHILI... So good. Although it looks like straight DOO DOO BUTTER... It tastes like heaven when you put it in your mouth. The ladies should now what I'm talking about... This place gets 1 star off because of a cracked out homeless dood trying to convince me to leave my car with him and he'd take care of it while I eat inside.

You are missing out on a basic Angeleno experience if you're living in Los Angeles and have never eaten at Philippe's. Lots has been said, so I'll just add my two cents...my favorite combo (they come a la carte, but I like these together): *Beef sandwich, double dipped (they'll know what you mean at the counter), add the hot mustard at the table. *Potato salad *Lemonade *Slice of pie (this may be overkill, just depends on how hungry I am) Awesome. My eye just twitched thinking about it... Oh yeah, bring cash. And don't forget there's seating upstairs.

The menu is extensive. The order line was a bit too old school for me. Okay, maybe way too old school for me. As a way too nerdy engineer, the inefficiency really bothered me. Nonetheless, I got a beef french dip, side of macaroni salad, and lemonade. French dip lacked flavor but a smidge of hot mustard made up for that. Macaroni salad and lemonade weren't all that special. Cafeteria seating was nice, although a bit invasive when the line grew long. Can't say I love this place, nor can I say I hate it. So long, Phillippe.

PLEASE BE CAREFUL WITH THE MUSTARD SAUCE! When I got my sandwich, I was like "hey let's put some 'honey mustard' on here" so I dipped A LOT without thinking. Then I took a bite and almost threw up cause it was exploding my sinuses! It's not honey mustard, guys. It's some kind of horse-raddish-like spicy mustard. I should have smelled it before I ate it. Aside from the bad experience I had with the mustard, the roast beef sandwich with american cheese was OK. I really don't think it had a mind-blowing taste like everybody makes it seem like on yelp. It tasted like a typical sandwich... a really soft one. (better than subway though) I also tried their turkey sandwich with american cheese and it was kind of dry. The store looks really old and creepy but I think they're keeping it that way for the style. Maybe, maybe not cause it seems like the waitresses wear uniforms from the 1940s. Although the food wasn't too great, I liked that they had really cheap refreshments (lemonade or iced tea for 75 cents) and their own parking area.

Yes, because I saw it on Man vs. Food. There's a large crowd, but since they have multiple lines, the wait wasn't so bad. I ended up getting the lamb sandwich and a lemonade - both were really good. Although they have a large space and a lot of seating, it might be difficult to get through with your tray of food to find a seat. I love the bread - not too soggy, even though it's dipped. The meat is moist and tender. You must try the spicy mustard on your sandwich. It's like wasabi. Good stuff. The lemonade is refreshing. I had a piece of my friend's brownie too - sooo moist and chocolatey, with lots of chocolate chips in it. Cash only. There are ATM machines to take out cash. They're slow, but maybe that's just me because I was getting impatient and I wanted to get in line to get my food.

Mouth watering sandwiches. A flat screen playin' NBA basketball. Bench seating reminiscent of elementary school (best 5 years of my life). I could of easily spent a couple of hours here. Shared a Beef and Lamb dip. Both were tasty and extremely gratifying. Had to try the mac salad along with a couple of beet pickled eggs, both agreeable to the sandwhiches in a hearty way. Stuffing our faces while watching the Laker game surrounded by locals oooing and aaahhhing at every play was in a weird way comforting.

Great place. 蔄 few years ago before LA Live was created, my buddy and I were looking for a good place to eat near Staples Center. 蔐uckily, we discovered Philippe's. 蔍 am a sucker for any establishment that invokes a sense of history and nostalgia. 蔕nce you step inside you feel like you went back in time, with the long cafeteria tables, the ladies at the counter in the old school uniforms, the sawdust on the floor. 蔍 know this isn't the original location, but you can easily envision "historic LA" with well dressed client弆e and bowler hats galore. This place can get really busy, and you may wind up waiting in line for a good 10+ minutes. 蔍t is worth it though, as the sandwiches are fantastic. 蔒y recommendation to anyone who even remotely likes lamb is to ORDER THE LAMB SANDWICH. 蔜he flavor of the lamb meat seems to blend perfectly with the au jus sauce and the bread. 蔜he roast beef is good as well, but for me the Lamb Sandwich is simply spectacular. 蔜he portion size may not be as large as people may like. 蔋owever given that you are getting good quality meat, I can't complain. 蔍'm not a fan of double-dip as the bread just gets too soggy for my liking. 蔜he mustard is worth a try, but my taste buds just aren't tenaciously bold enough to handle large amounts of it. Like many people have said, the pies are great as well. 蔒y favourite is the Coconut Cream pie. 蔛ure, it solely consists of crust, coconut flavored cream, and whipped cream on top of the base layer of cream but it is simply delicious. 蔈very time I visit before a Clipper game I debate whether or not to get it (due to the glut of calories, saturated fat and disease inducing ingredients it must contain.) 蔜hen I realize that I am going to a Clipper game, and that my body will need something to numb it from the impending shock, frustration and inevitable disappointment. If you live in or around the LA area, this place is a must try. 蔄 truly one of a kind restaurant. 蔍t seems hit or miss for most people, with no middle ground. 蔒y friends either love it or call it mediocre and overrated. 蔜he only way to find out is to give a try for yourself!

Came here before going to Staples Center and watch the Sharks play the Kings. My boyfriend said he saw Philippe's on some tv show and that we had 蕋o try it. The birthplace of the french dip? Of course I'll try it! It's a really big place with plenty of seats on the first and second floor. The line was pretty short when we got there but it was almost out the door when we were leaving. Most of the people in line had Kings jersies on, so I'm guessing this is definitely a stop before going to a game for locals. The boyfriend got the original beef, I got the pork and we tried each other's. Both were SO GOOD. They make their own spicy sauce but I didn't try it. The sandwiches on their own were already delicious. After finishing my food, I realized that maybe I should've gotten 2 sandwiches since they are a little smaller than I'm used to. Definitely will stop by again next time. Minus 1 star because I'm hella jealous that Kings fans get to have some Philippe's before a game.

Harkens back to a time when women were dames, the rebel on everyone's mind was James Dean, and good food could be fast and cheap. The counter at Phillipe's was swarming with people and I felt a bit unsure about what to order at first. A pork and a beef dip turned out to be just enough to fill me up and take a traveler for the road. Great sando, great service, nostalgic atmosphere makes Phillipe's a must see LA landmark.

On a recent trip to LA, the group decided to stop here cause the show was on Man vs Food. Since we all love french dipped sandwiches, we decided this would be a good stop. Two Words: Over Rated I got the lamb, double dipped w/ dill pickle on the side. $6.95 for the sandwich, $1 for a small pickle and $0.65 for a glass of lemonade. 蔜he sandwich itself lacked flavor. i didn't taste much from the meat and the Au jous didn't have much flavor as well. 蔛alt was needed to bring out any flavor from the sandwich. 蔜he mustard added a nice kick, reminded me of Chinese hot mustard The lines here are all random, so just jump into any line. 蔜hey have plenty of other sides which include, pies, chili, pickled beets, etc. The chili was decent, a bit too salty and too much cumin from my taste test off my friend's bowl. �Overall, really disappointed in my experience here.

We had a great time coming here I have always heard about this place and have seen it on multiple shows so I had to check it out... 蔜he place is an old building and parking can be crazy do yourself a favor and just pay to park will save time and aggravation and its also good if you send the boys to get the food and then you go upstairs and find a table.. 蔜he seating is strange its almost like you are a factory working eating in the break room.. I had the Beef with 1 Dip the bread was very good the meat was tasty and the sandwich was perfect.. 蔜he potato salad was very good almost as good as my dad's I liked how they don't put mustard in it I hate potato salad with mustard.. �We also had the Blueberry Pie and you can tell its homemade..

Fresh carved meats au jus? How can you have just one? I avoided the seemingly good sides so that I could have two sandwiches. They are on the small side and I felt further justified after observing a couple of 10-year olds eating two PLUS sides and dessert. The jus could've been more flavorful but at least it wasn't too salty. I recommend a double dip for sure! Don't expect parking or seating to be easy but things move along rather quickly. When you're in Chicago..try Buona Beef for Italian beef au jus; I'm reasonably certain you'll enjoy it more in terms of overall flavor and condiment options-- but...Phillipe's is hugely charming, affordable, memorable, and worthy of repeated visits.

Anyone that gives this place less than four stars is crazy and one star, totally uncalled for.. So the location rocks because you can go there after a Chinatown gallery night. 蔜he soup kitchen/ saw dust on the floor rocks because how often do you get to do that. 蔜he communal tables are awesome because they remind you that food is supposed to be about enjoying with others. 蔄nd the food needs no explanation or jazzy adjective. I've watched my dad eat 4 of their sandwiches in one sitting since I was little, I've watched my friends from the Bay cry with excitement over their spicy mustard. And I've watched a whole lotta people watch anxiously as they wait for their food. The sandwiches are killer, beyond satisfying. 蔜heir salads, like macaroni and potato, are as good as your mom made for summer picnics. 蔄nd they have pickled eggs and baked apples... no one is complaining. �Philippe's gets over 5 stars in my book no doubt.

As far as we know, the original french dip sandwich was supposedly created here when a local cop ordered a sandwich to go, it fell into the drippings, and when they offered to remake it, he was in a rush so he took it as is. 蔠hen he came back with his buddies, he asked for it that way again, and the french dip was born. The sandwiches are delish. 蔜he mustard is hot and spicy. 蔜he lemonade is refreshing. 蔜he pie is very tasty. Enjoy a true classic meal here, but expect a line!

This restaurant has been overrated with it being on the Food Network and on the recommendation list on almost every Los Angelenos' places-you-have-to-eat list. However, this place, more likely than not, will fulfill your expectations! Trust me! This place is commonly known to have long lines (especially during lunch), but frankly I didn't give a damn and soon forgot the hell I had to go through once I took a bite of their succulent roast beef French dipped sandwich! Heaven in my mouth. If you've never had a french dip sandwich before, I urge you to go here for your first time! :)

Where are the best places to go in Los Angeles? There's the Hollywood Bowl, 蔇odger Stadium, the Getty, Disney Hall... 蔄nd then there's Philippe's. The first time I entered Philippe's and looked down on the lines of people standing like they were waiting to place a bet at the track, I knew it was special. And how many places can make a claim to have invented something? The French dip sandwich is at least as important as variable speed windshield wipers. There are plenty of places that try to recreate the past but few that don't even have to put on makeup to embody it. Philippe's is such a spot. I usually get the lamb sandwich with macaroni salad and lemonade and always a deviled egg. The roll might not be the freshest, the lamb not the most tender. I love the mustard but it is a little like putting your tongue on a stove. Doesn't matter. It's all still way good enough. That sawdust on the floor... It's not pretentious at Philippe's. It's stardust.

What can I say about this place that has not already been said. I've been going there since birth and everything from breakfast to lunch & dinner is just fresh and taste great! Famous for their French Dip I also enjoy their chile with or without beans and they won't tell me where they purchase their pies as they are also the best. I suggest the beef "double dipped" with cole slaw and a dill with a bud "on tap". Chocolate Cream or Banana Cream pie for desert.

Fresh from watching Man v Food, I had to check out Philippe's. 蔍t was a Sunday afternoon (1:30) and the lines were still very long (15 minute wait). 蔜he place is worth a visit if you havent been, definitely very old school and historic feeling. 蔜he folks taking the orders were very friendly and work hard to get everything right. We went with the beef and it was very good. 蔔ot sure it was the best I've ever had, but very good. 蔜he mustard was impressive and unique. 蔍 am into mustard and spicy, so I am a fan. My wife reported that the potato salad was good and my son enjoyed his pudding. I enjoyed looking around at the circus pictures and other artifacts on the wall. 蔍 am sure that I will take some visitors there if I am in the area.

"Phillp's", "Felipe's", however you say it: "The Original" beef dip is savory, with just the right touch of jus on a soft, delicious bun. I've tried a few with and without cheese, and I'd definitely recommend getting one with Jack or Swiss. Make sure to bring cash, as they don't accept credit or debit cards. Being from Chicago, I haven't ever considered the French Dip to be on the same level as a classic Italian Beef, but Phillipe's certainly comes closer than any I've tried.

I have visited Phillipe twice already and my experience has gotten better and better each time. After watching an episode on MAN v Food i was intrigued with the restaurant and decided to hunt it down. BEWARE the lines here can be very long if you arrive during peak lunch hours. So be prepared to wait. This can also affect the parking. I usually order a beef sandwich with coleslaw, a pickle, and an ice tea. The sandwiches are very tasty specially accompanied by the horseradish mustard. PRICES ARE AFFORDABLE, MY MEAL WAS UNDER 10 DOLLARS. make sure you get your sandwich double dipped which enhances the taste a hundred more times. I will return once again and try the lamb

I love this place. There's sawdust on their cement floors. Their pies, salads, and goodies are showcased under their glass cases. There are always long lines, but it moves fast. Their sandwiches are cheap and delicious. I love their traditional french dip with hot mustard. A word of advice- be careful with the mustard. It has a wasabi effect and too much of it will cause a burning sharp pain with involuntary tears. Their bread is soft and their roast beef with melted swiss soaked in au jus is delicious. I usually like my roast beef medium rare but their sandwich is good well done. The au jus and mustard bring out the flavor of the beef. I usually get their potato and macaroni salad which is cheap. Their chicken soup and chili is decent and cheap. Their pecan pie is delicious and you guessed it, cheap! Their prices can't be beat. They have plenty of seating with benches both downstairs and upstairs. I loved this place so much I came down for their 100th anniversary special. We waited in line for over half a day. We were exhausted by the time we got our food. I will never do that again. My love for Philippe still remains. I'll go on any day except their anniversary.

Finally went last week on a vendor. Thanks Amper!! We went on a lunch rush and of course it was STACKED!!! We got lucky with the parking. The place is filled with history and plays it well with the decor. The long lines and the way you order your food can be a bit intimidating but hang in and go with the flow. I ordered the pork sandwich "double dipped" a side of mac salad and potato salad. I know!!! go big or die!! I even ordered a pickled egg. The Ranger IPA was the choice of bev wash it all down. The sides were good but nothing to write home about. The pickled egg was nice and vinegary. The sandwich....was ok. I was sad... Really? It was just ok. I'm sorry it was just ok. I probably won't go to Philippe The Original Restaurant ever again. It was a nice experience.

A little over-rated. It should be more about the Tasty Spicy Mustard! In my Mind: - Beef French Dip - Pork Dip In my Stomach: I went into this place hoping that 蔵t will tickle my taste buds but it was not as good as I anticipated. Bread was no better than what you find at the grocery stores. Meat was moist but the flavor wasn't there. I guess this is why I loaded mine with Spicy Mustard. Don't get me wrong, it's not bad. It's worth the experience because of its 90s theme. You get to sit on "old school" benches and do some people watching. If you like candy, there's also a over-priced candy shop to check out.

This place has average food at best, is filthy, and is downright overpriced. First of all, I came here to try the supposedly "best french dip in the world." 蔍 was very disappointed. Cycle through the pictures until you see the actual thing. The bread is plain and generic. the meat is overcooked, thin and dry. And when you order this overpriced sandwich, it doesn't even come with fries or anything. they don't even give you horseradish or a cup of au jus to dip in. It's practically school cafeteria food, and costs too much. $2 for a small bag of chips? Subway cuts better deals than this. Anyways, the place is disgusting. the floor is dirty and covered with trash, which apparently is supposed to help the atmosphere. 蔊UYS, IT'S NOT PEANUT SHELLS, it's trash. gum wrappers, straws, napkins, etc. The building looks like it will fall down in the next earthquake since there's so many holes in the wall. And if you go upstairs, you get the pleasure of eating in a converted hotel. the old plumbing hookups are still sticking out of the wall and it smells funny. The lines are long and hectic and homeless people often come in from the street to use the bathrooms and water fountain. I would be afraid to bring a girl here. It's bad.

My dad has been taking me to Phillipe's since I was a kid and recently I returned with an agenda to critique. 蔜he cafeteria atmosphere, to me, adds to the allure but if you go into Phillipe's with any expectations you could be dissappointed. 蔐ike my review of Primanti Brothers in Pittsburgh, there are some places that gain a reputation over time not always because of their amazing food but the fact they've survived for decades offering a familiar comfort without ever changing, Phillipes is one of those places. 蔖hillipe's may offer no culinary masterpieces but it is no doubt a piece of Angelino culture and worth a visit.

Alright, who on Yelp L.A. hasn't been to Philippe's yet? 蔍'm pretty sure I'm not offering any brand spanking new insight into anything with this historical landmark of a restaurant, but any more positive reviews from me and I feel like Philippe's should be paying me... 蔭t least in sandwiches. Every time I come to Philippe's I pretty much order the same thing, and it is inevitably the same reason that drives me here each and every time I come. 蔒ore often than not I am in Los Angeles for some purpose, which normally involves waiting for someone to either get off work or get out of school nearby, and in my impatiently waiting nature I get hungry and trail off to Philippe's by myself. 蔜he crazy part about that is, I've pretty much been coming to Philippe's since I got my driver's license, and can remember well how the prices go ever so slightly higher every so often. 蔋owever, that does not detract from the marvelousness that is this establishment -- they could start charging $10 a pop for their specialty sandwiches and it would still be well worth it (and probably cheaper and for sure less pretentious than other similar shops in the area). I always order my lamb or turkey French dip sandwiches "double dipped," which means exactly what it is -- they double dip the 'wich in their deliciously brothy au jus. 蔜he side dishes are perfectly proportioned -- me being of the potato salad and cole slaw variety myself -- being just as tasty and unique as the sandwiches, but not so much in quantity that they fill you up unnecessarily. 蔍 also always get two glasses of lemonade and two glasses of iced tea to create my own magical little Philippe's Arnold Palmer. I have taken friends and family members to this joint, and no one has left disappointed (or even remotely hungry). 蔍 am sure that their desserts, which look mouth-watering out for visibility's sake from the counter, are delicious, and I have heard that their breakfasts are pretty good too. 蔅ut, come on -- why change a good thing? 蔜heir sandwiches are tasty and are not overpowering in any flavor. 蔜he atmosphere is casual and the ladies behind the service counter still wear throwback diner-waitress-style uniforms. 蔠hether there are three or thirty people in line, the wait never seems to be overly long. 蔜he sawdust on the floor and the very basic cafeteria-style seating all indicate a very laid-back, homey, and somehow welcoming restaurant environment that undoubtedly keeps Philippe's loyal patrons hungry and coming back for more -- just like me!

With a 100 year history, it's no surprise that they have a ton of reviews so I don't really have to say much. 蔋eard about Philippe on the KQED show "Sandwiches you Will Like" and I've always wanted to make an effort to check out this place and enjoyed a beef french dip sandwich, lamb french dip sandwich, lemon merigne pie, vegetable barley soup, and part of my girlfriend's pork french dip sandwich. 蔒an, was I full afterward. It was neat seeing the Dodgers/Red Sox game at the LA Coliseum on at the time, but I wouldn't mind seeing them put more TVs up so you can watch stuff from different parts of the restaurant. �I guess you can't tell from the outside, but the interior is so huge with so much room to sit. 蔍t seems as if the seating options just keep going and going and going. 蔄nd at only around $5.50/french dip, you can afford to have two of em and top it off with a dessert.

Went here ages ago, and was just reminded of it while watching USC whalloping Notre Dame. It conjured up memories of my college days when I went here, and immediately I could smell and taste the sandwich as if it were yesterday. If I'm ever back in LA I have to be sure to revisit this icon again.

Ok, I can see how this place survived for a hundred years, but honestly, I've had better French Dips... perhaps folks perfected on Philippe's original recipe? Next time I go, I'm definitely getting a Lamb French Dip- it seems to have more flavor than the regular beef dips. What I do like about Philippe's is the restaurant interior itself- sawdust on the ground, hardwood tables and stools, cafeteria-style ordering plus the dining trays... You just don't see places like this anymore. While I wish the sandwiches were bigger and cheaper, you really can't complain about the sides, drinks, and PIE! Honestly, I'd come back just for those last three things, especially the pie (I had a slice of banana cream pie), which was a tasty surprise given the fact that this place is known for its French Dips. So yeah, cheap drinks, cheap sides, cheap pie... not so cheap sandwiches (at least not anymore). Go figure.

100 years strong! I've had it on my list for months- the place where the French dip was born! The Original! Go for the triple-dipped roast beef and a side of potato salad. Delish! But I can't say that it was any more spectacular than the next guy's. Maybe I was expecting transcendence, nirvana. It didn't fall short of my expectations, but I don't believe I will be making the trek downtown to get my fix. It's definitely worth it if you're in the neighborhood.

Got the beef double dip, cole slaw, potatoe salad, chocolate mouse cake thing and lemonade. Sandwich was good, a little small but good, cole slaw tasted pretty good with a balance of sweet and tart-ness. The potatoe salad left something to be desired. Drinks are a bit small and you might have to buy 2 in order to finish your meal. The pie thing was alright; not overly grand, but just alright. Maybe I'm biased cause my family made roast beef sandwiches since I was a 蕎ee lad, but these sandwiches don't really fill ya up. I got out of there for about $13-14 which is a bit high for small portions..I might wait another 15 years before I go back again maybe then the sandwiches will be bigger. Things I liked, 蕋he disposable plates and counter style service. Things I didn't, prices and portion size.

Philippe's is yet another L.A. institution adjacent to Olvera Street. Be sure to get your sandwich double dipped. I don't need cheese on mine. The mustard is spicy, yet still good. The slaw is sweet, yet crunchy. The pickles are spot-on. And their desserts are yummy, especially the apple pie. Inexpensive, fresh, and worth waiting in the long lines.

The best french dip sandwiches I've ever had since I was a kid! I've grown to love their lamb dip more than their beef. Both are so juicy, on fresh bread and a choice of cheese. Gotta also get the custard cup! If you don't mind sawdust, picnic table style seating, 10 long lines (and each person ordering about 5 sandwiches and 5 drinks with a small dessert on the side) AND don't mind sharing the same deli mustard container with the rest of downtown then this is the place for ya!

This is truly an LA classic. 蔈veryone comes here before the Dodger games to grab some yummy food! They're known for their french dipped sandwiches, which they dip themselves (no cup of au jus on the side for you). 蕋he beef is definitely the way to go. 蔜he beef is nicely seasoned and tender. 蔄nd at $5.95 per sandwich, it can't be beat. 蔵t's not the same quality as a houston's french dipped, but for a fraction of the price it's awesome! and you can't beat the 75 cent lemonade and 65 cent iced tea =) parking is a bit difficult and it gets busy, especially before a game. 蕋he place has a lot of charm. 蕋he place looks like it did a few decades ago, it's decorated with railroad pictures, and the floors are covered in saw dust. 蔭 fun stop in down town LA

Right before a dodger game, we decided to come here to fill our stomachs and our minds. �I only tried the lamb, but it was damn good. 蔅ut it was not only the sandwich that was the star of the meal, but the absolutely amazing hot mustard. 蔍 huffed and puffed on some bites, and it's what i call active eating. 蔍t's a great experience.

Went to Philippe's today with my son before the Dodger game. 蔍t was mobbed with hordes of fans in Dodger Blue (their food and prices beat Dodger Stadium fare hands down!) Although the lines were long, the service was quick and the food excellent. 蔒y son had their classic beef dip and I the lamb. 蔄 side of potato salad topped off our meal. 蔠e were both very happy with our lunch and left for the stadium knowing that a full stomach and wallet is the best way to take in a game, I would recommend this L.A. landmark to anyone who enjoys good food at reasonable prices in a historic atmosphere.

Yet another food destination I can cross off my list!! 蔖hilippes is a place I heard much about from locals and from travel/food channel exposes on places to get a great sandwich. �First off, we came during the evening for a late dinner right before a Dodgers game finished and the crowds started coming. 蔠e got our food pretty quickly. �Since there were several people in our group we were able to try a number of sandwiches (lamb, roast beef, pork, ham). As far as 'dipping' the bread is dipped before its given to you so don't be confused if they don't give you a cup of au jus for self dipping. 蔠e got all our sandwiches double dipped (both top and bottom slices of bread dipped in au jus). 蔍t sounds like it would be a wet gooey mess but this is not the case. 蔛ince they don't adorn their sandwiches with much sauce, they could use some lubrication from dipping. �Truth be told, my favorite of the bunch was the pork sandwich. �They sides were of potato salad and coleslaw were okay. 蔭t 6 bucks per sandwich ($5.55 plus another 50 cents or so with cheese) and ice tea or lemonade for under a buck, this place is incredible easy on the wallet. �The folks who come here are also an interesting melange of the L.A. population so people watching is another activity to throw in while coming here!

What is there to say about this place that hasn't been said in the 800+ reviews. Philippe's offered what had to be the best sandwiches I've ever had, all dipped in a wonderful au-jus sauce. They've been operating since 1908 and it shows in the both the style and the quality. Bitting into those sandwiches was like a religion experience. I was there 3 times on my recent trip to Los Angeles and never got sick of it. The atmosphere is great, the long lines fade quickly with a very efficient, old-school service. And yes, I brought back a jar of mustard home with me. It's conveniently located near Dodger stadium which makes it all the better because you can make it the eat-before-the-ballgame place. Very highly recommended!

Went before the first game of the Cardinals Dodgers NLDS game today for a late lunch with my uncle, brother, and cousin. Best decision of the week. Maybe. There have been a lot of good decisions this week. Had the beef sandwich (no cheese - hardest decision I ever had to make- almost) and cole slaw. So freaking good. Like amazing. Put some of the slaw on your sandwich, awesome! Also got a sweet pickle, if I had to do that over again, I would pass. Maybe a kosher dill, but those are a dollar or something, not sure if thats worth it either. But the sandwich and the slaw is worth it, I bet the other sides and the baked apple and pies are worth it too. I will be back here before I leave this remarkable town!

That was my second time in Philippe. I don't have much memory at the first time. But this time, I love it!!!!! My husband got a BEEF DOUBLE DIP SANDWICH and a PORK DOUBLE DIP SANDWICH. I got a LAMB DOUBLE DIP SANDWICH. The lamb was delicious, but I just wish the slices of the lamb can be thinner. After trying three different sandwich, my husband thinks the BEEF is the BEST! Also, the double dip gives the sandwich much more flavor! I am a person that do not like soggy bread, but the sandwich was fine. I think it was good. We also ordered a side of potato salad, and a side of FRENCH ROLL. The potato salad was ok. My husband thinks it is like a cole slaw more. The FRENCH ROLL was awesome! It is just the bread without the meat. But without the dip, the bread is very good with butter! The apple pie was ok. It is a good slice of pie, but not the best! Apple Pan's apple pie is much better! The lemonade is cheaper, but smaller. A can of soda may still be the best way to go. If you are a guy, you should order TWO sandwiches. For my husband and his friend, they both needed two sandwiches to be full! Remember to bring CASH!!! CASH ONLY!!!! $20 would be more than enough for one person.

A total throwback. 蔜his place hasn't had any work done to it since at least 1970. Basically - which french dip sandwich do you want? 蔊o with the beef dip for the original. 蔊rab a homemade lemonade for only 75 cents! 蔇ecent homemade desserts like apple pie, too. Service is bland due to the masses of people in and out, and payment is cash only. 蔈asy to park. 蔞ery cool for a local lunch if you're in the area.

Finally got to try this place! Double dip roast beef with swiss hands down is my favorite. 蔠e all shared and I tried the double dip lamb, double dip beef and double dip beef and swiss. 蔜he swiss makes all the difference and made me a fan of this place to come back whenever I'm in LA. We went around 2pm on a Tuesday so the line wasn't long at all. 蔍t looked like the people that took your order is also the ones that make your sandwiches as well. 蔜he staff was friendly.

I'm rounding up here, but I gave this place a 4.5!! The long wait is a bit of a turn off, but well worth the wait. The bf and I decided to come here after watching the Food Network's Man vs. Food. We both ordered the Beef French Dip (double dipped!), 2 lemonades each, and shared the beef stew. potato salad, and cole slaw. AMAZING! The business had been around for a century! They have perfected the french dipped sandwich and the restaurant has plenty of space for seating. The ladies working behind the counter are 蔱fficient and I love their outfits! It's so retro and I felt as if I went back in time, just like the old times. �Definitely coming back to grab a few more bites. FTW: cheap and very filling.

I got the beef french dip sandwich, which was very filling and large. The beef is normal and a little dry, but the dryness is compensated with the bread soaked in french dip. The restaurant is really busy during lunchtime as all the people who work in the area drop by. However, the lines go by quickly fast as you are expected to know what you want as soon as you get to the counter. The restaurant has an old, cool vibe to it as the floor is covered in saw dust. The place is actually pretty big too with a back room and upstairs.

This is a great place to stop between Olvera Street and Chinatown--delicious and cheap sandwiches, cheap coffee (yes, it's 9 cents), and a wide variety of sides and breakfast items. Most people come here for the french dip. It's pretty damn good--I recommend the beef and cheddar, double-dipped. However, what gives this that extra star for me is that nearly everything (the sandwiches, the potato salad, the cole slaw and even the coffee and pies) taste like the food my Grandma used to make when she was still alive. The atmosphere is nostalgic as well, with old phone booths lining one wall, vintage signs for the rail trains, and bench-style seating. The only downside is the wait. I've waited up to an hour to order *(you get the food right after you order). I guess the upside to that is that there's plenty of time to decide on which pie to order (they're all delicious!). ALSO make sure to hit up the ATM or use the ATM on-site. CA$H ONLY.

Beef french dip sandwich, pickled egg, and some of the best deli mustard ever!!! This place is the F-ing BOMB!! 蔉or a good tasting sandwich, Philippe is the spot. 蔕ld school counter service combined with an easy no hassle atmosphere. 蔕rder your food, pay for it and go find a table to eat it. 蔛andwiches run under $6 and they have an array to choose from, including: beef, turkey, pork, lamb, etc. 蔒y absolute favorite is the beef and the lamb. 蔍 love those two so much, I usually get both!! I'm such a pig, but it's soo worth the extra calories. Yesterday for lunch I deviated from my norm and got the roast beef with a bowl of chili...talk about greasy spoon type chili. Chili was decent and as always the beef sandwich was delish. 蔔o meal there is complete without the red pickled eggs....YUM! 蔍'm not a big slaw fan, but my colleagues rave that it's super good. 蔜heir famous mustard makes the sandwich even better. 蔋ard to believe that the sandwich can be better but trust me....a little dab of that mustard on the sandwich and you'll be hooked. 蔉air warning: It has a kick to it so be very careful. ��Word of advice: be ready to order when you get to the counter!! Nothing is more irritating then waiting for the idiot in front of you to decide what they want when you're hungry and ready to tear into your sandwich!! Damn Amateurs!! Everything is a la carte, so don't be expecting chips and slaw!! 蔍 paid $13 dollars (includes a buck for those lunch ladies) for a beef sandwich, bowl of no bean chili, pickles, pickled egg, and an ice tea. �Ample parking next to them and across the street. ���Ohhh... Cash only!! This place is an LA institution and so worth trying if you never been.

Lamb french dip. Lamb french dip. Mmmmmmm. Lamb is just a *touch* overdone... but that's picking nits. And the crowd is very classic, old school Los Angeles. Down to the annoying old people who have no idea what personal space is and keep cramming you in line. It's the coleslaw that was disappointing. Fresh but... not quite right.

It was just like any other day, I was sitting at home watching the travel channel and despising the fact that none of the restaurants featured on there are ever in LA. My stomach was growling, and there was no food at home, so I decided to change the channel. But then I heard it.. it was music to my ears.. this famous sandwich restaurant is based in LOS ANGELES! Boy was I glad I did not change the channel. After reading the fantastic reviews on Yelp (not that it would've changed my mind about going there), I decided to head on over there the next day. There's a small parking lot right across from it which cost 0$ :) The place was packed with people, and the lines were very messy--it did move pretty fast though. I ordered the beef and lamb french dip, coleslaw, potato salad, and the lemonade. The beef was really good. I wasn't a big fan of the lamb though. It was a little too gamy. The coleslaw and potato salad were decent. I think what put the food over the top was their home made mustard. mmm. My only complaint is how dirty the tables were. I sat upstairs because all the tables downstairs were full. Not one single table was crumb-less!

Philippe's is a true gem in China Town and it's not Chinese food! Always plenty of FREE parking - which is rare in downtown. Best French Dip (ask for them to double dip it) in LA and the purple eggs aren't too shabby. Pie, sandwiches, eggs, and salads are all really good - especially with the hot mustard. Don't miss Philippe's. It is also really close to Olvera Street - for a nice walk and shopping - and maybe a taquito or two. I always stop by Philippe's for a delicious bite before any Dodger game... and you can take the short cut up College Street to Chavez Ravine and miss all of the traffic.

I held from going to this place due to the massive line that fills the restaurant, but my friend and I braved the line and it wasn't so bad at all! We got to the counter in less than 10 minutes and got our food in less than 5. The beef sandwich was delicious, although we took it togo so it was a bit dried, the hot mustard really hit the spot, but wayyyy to spicy! Their potato salad was delicious!!! Next time, I'll make sure to either eat there or as for the lady to double dip my sandwich.

I wasn't too impressed the last time I was here (about five years ago), but after seeing Philippe's on various Food Network shows, I decided I'd give it another shot, especially now that I knew about this double-dipping deal. I tried the beef (half), pork (half) and lamb (whole) sandwiches. 蔜he lamb was good and the tenderness of the pork was money, but I preferred the flavor of the beef over all. 蔊enerally speaking though, I would have enjoyed it more if the beef was cut freshly to order like it was with the lamb so as to include the natural juices; instead, they take pre-cut beef and put it in your sandwich... hence, it wasn't moist or hot. 蔄t least double-dipping the bread in the au jus made it a lot more enjoyable to eat than when I ate it dry years before. 蔄nd for the record, if they offered a side of au jus for dipping, I'd definitely return. The chili here is pretty good, though not quite comparable to the one at Pink's. 蔜he cherry pie wasn't bad either. 蔄nd the potato salad? 蔍t's just potato salad... it's neither here nor there. 蔅ut then again, I don't recall ever having potato salad that really stood out. Though I still think this place is a bit overrated, I'd come back when I'm in the area. 蔄nd you have to love that it's an LA landmark. �Oh, can't forget the mustard! 蔜he mustard has a wasabi-like kick to it that's just awesome; the masochistic side of me loves the tear-jerking effects brought on by wasabi or potent mustards. 蔄nyways, it's a necessary addition to your sandwich. 蔍 just may buy a jar of that next time. *Edit* My visit took place a couple weeks before this recent uh... closure. 蔣our decision to eat here is entirely up to you. 3.5 stars

With 1000+ reviews already for Philippe, I feel theres isn't much more for me to add so I'll keep it brief. 蔐ike Pink's, this french dip place has been known to me long before I moved to LA, and like Pink's I entered into it with a healthy amt of skepticism and lowered expectations reserved for any place burdened with Food Network reinforced tourist hype. So yes they had the basic sandwich menu, yes there was the infamous 'double dip', yes I saw the charming sawdust on the floor, and of course I had to try a side of their signature potato salad. I ordered a beef sandwich (which according to fellow reviewers is the best among the meats) and overall I'd have to say the whole experience met my expectations which were 'alright, but not party-in-my-mouth-til-the-cops-break-it-up 蔭wesome'. I'm sure I'll come again on a weekday as its a 10 min drive from my workplace, but will I talk it up to out of towner friends? 蔖robably not, I think everyone in LA will do that for me.

There comes a point in Yelping where it is almost ridiculous to write a review for a place that has 1000+ reviews. But I will do so nonetheless. We're were on our way to Lakers Fan Jam without having had anything to eat for the day. Due to Man v. Food infamy, we decide to hit up Philippe's. My goodness the 5 traffic made us cranky and hungry. I was almost scared for the lines I had read and heard about. There was one parking spot magically saved for us. Alright, no parking issues = a good start to the experience. We walk in and the lines don't seem too long. A little disorganized madness is what I would describe the ordering process. Every now and again you're not really sure which line you're in, but you keep trying to push for that shorter line. We waited less than 10 minutes before we started ordering. Um, I think I've waited longer at Subway?? No wait time issues = another plus. We ordered one pork and one lamb sandwich, potato salad, pickles, and custard with some refreshing iced tea. The lady behind the counter was incredibly sweet and worked swiftly. We were headed to a table in no time :] Both the sandwiches were deee-licious. I ate half of a lamb and half of a pork - no i didn't eat both. I really liked the potato salad as well, probably because it had a good amount of relish and I'm a relish fan. The pickle was a pickle, but it's amazing how well pickles go with sandwiches. 蔍 liked their iced tea (but I like most unsweetened iced teas, so that's not saying much). The custard was good - not too sweet, but just a nice refreshing dessert to top of the meal. The highlight of the meal was the hot mustard. Hot dang, it was hot! So, I hate mustard for the most part, but I will occasionally eat deli mustard. I've never liked mustard until Philippe's came into my life. I just couldn't get enough of how that spiciness crawls up to your nasal cavity and you're practically breathing it. Awesome all around. and cockroach infestation? Meh. Probably, but oh well. Oh yea, cash only! Very old school of them. We spent a good portion of our meal discussing how much bank they must make every day. Oh and we forgot to order the sandwiches with cheese, so that may be on the agenda for the next visit!

Rated as one of the top places to get your French Dip on, Philippe's is one of Los Angeles' oldest restaurant that was established back in 1908. 蔍f you find yourself in downtown or around Union Station and got some time for a nice meal, be sure to stop by and order a French Dip with your choice of meat: beef, pork, ham, lamb or turkey. Or gather some friends and share to taste all the flavors! I am a fan of the beef and a lot of others were fans of the lamb. 蔅e sure to ask for it double-dipped if that's your thing. 蔐ike another Yelper said, don't be intimidated by the lines. 蔎ust pretend that you're in a food truck line but you actually get somewhere to sit! Complete your meal with sides like coleslaw, potato salad, and some dessert like custard and tapioca (because I'm a champ like that..ha).

Friend had jury duty and an hour off. "I'm on your side of town!" the valley dweller exclaimed. Not exactly my side of town but bribery? 蔍'm not above that. And while it was dreary and horrific outside then, I braved the bumper to bumper traffic with the promise of a tasty sammich and a cold brew. 蔣es, cold brew. 蔍'm masochistic. The place was similar to a cafeteria. 蔍t was gritty and there was woodchips or something on the floor. Picture walking into a giant cement block with some long pieces of wood atop metal poles. 蔜here were stools in front. � lines running perpendicular to one long food counter. There were cafeteria trays. 蔄n assortment of people from all over. It IS Los Angeles. Flashback to the days the famous sammich was created. 蔍 imagine it looked very much similar. 蔜he crowd a mixture of immigrants and suits all doing their damnest to make their dreams come true here. Full disclosure: I'd been to Coles- the rival of the creation of the famed au juis sammich- first. 蔅oth of these establishments have their pluses. 蔅oth are unique experiences to which I would recommend anyone coming to Los Angeles. 蔋owever this one is less "proper" in its formality and execution than Coles. �That said, food here was cheaper. 蔜hey had a ton of selections as far as drinks were concerned- though for alcoholic bliss there were only a few bottleneck brews vs the full bar at Coles. All in all just an A'ok. 蔛ammich was cheap and tasty but not.. rich. This survey says... Philippe's may have a very classic feel to it.. and while it is rich in some ways with its diversity... it doesn't have the ambiance and coziness that I have found in a certain little piece of building with a speakeasy in the back.

They make it known that they're old... we got a spiel and a pamphlet as we entered the place. 蔍 did read later on Wikipedia that this location isn't actually the original restaurant... it's only been at 1001 Alameda since 1951. 蔜he crowd was generally older too; we were some of the youngest there. They have a few old-timey snacks like pickled pigs feet and pickled eggs. 蔄pparently everything was pickled in the early 1900s. I'm used to getting au jus in a cup with modern French dip sandwiches, that's not the case here. 蔍f I'd checked Yelp beforehand I would have known to ask for it double dipped or wet, but basically it was a roll lightly brushed with juice, plus meat and cheese if you want it. 蔍 got the turkey with American cheese, a pickle, and an iced tea. 蔍t was all okay. 蔍 was glad that it was relatively cheap, especially for drinks. 蔍 guess the main goal here is just to say you've been to Philippe's. 蔍'm glad I checked out this landmark LA restaurant, and I plan on going again to see if a "wet" sandwich is any better. It's cash only, fyi

maybe it's just over-hyped or i went expecting more. I had Philppe's french dipped beef w/swiss. It was okay - nothing to write home about IMO. That said, some people absolutely love it. *shrugs* to each their own. Seating is similar to a school cafeteria - free for all tables and stools. I liked the super cheap drinks and they had plenty of sides and desserts to choose from. It's located on a random corner in "Chinatown" but is complete with two of their own parking lots which is great. I was also fortunate enough to come in on a non-busy time. Also they don't take credit cards, but do have an ATM inside.

MMMMMMMMMMMMMMM...MMMMMMMMM...MMMM It's that good. I know there's a lot of talk of Philippe's being overrated, but I don't agree. The hype is TRUE. I ordered the double-dip beef with swiss and she had the double-dip pork with swiss. 蔍'm not a porker, so the beef was perfect for me, especially when I topped it off with the freakishly good mustard sauce..I imagine that some cole slaw slapped in there would prob be that much better. 蔔ext time I definitely be able to handle the triple dip, though my arteries might not agree. We couldn't resist all the drinks and sides so we ordered 2 fat tires, a lemonade, an iced-tea, potato salad (preferred this to the more mild cole slaw, but try both!), cole slaw, and topped it off with a shared slice of banana cream pie, which is the only sign of moderation we showed for the night--well that and me not being able to finish the beer. 蔠ill be returning for a triple dip, more of that 75 cent lemonade, and the oh so fatty potato salad.

Lemonade, not too sweet, just 75 cents, and coffee 9 cents ( 75 cents to go) Cole's is pricier, but with more meat. 蔖hilippe's however still hits the spot.

My cousin (from Canada of all places), found this place while watching Man vs. Food, so, as a result, it was a MUST STOP in our trip in LA. This place is one of those cute, old, diners, which has been around since.... 1908, i believe, or something like that. You walk in, and you just see rows and rows of wooden tables, a bar to order at, and lots of wood shavings on the floor. 蔜his place was packed with people for a 4pm stop on a Saturday afternoon. I ordered a beef sandwich (had no idea of the dip specialties! sigh. My bad.), and an iced tea (only 75 cents!). The roast beef was GREAT, as the bread was nice and soft, and the beef was nice and juicy. The iced tea...was just iced tea. They serve your food on trays with glasses that reminded me of cafeteria style dishes, and the surroundings are definitely traditional- they have old style telephone booths, and little toy trains around the room as well. Definitely a nice old diner...packed with people. Next time.. I'll do my homework and ask about the dips. Nonetheless, great sandwich (definitely filling, I ate the whole thing), and worth the stop!

I'm somewhere between 3 and 4 stars on this one... Learned about this place since it was featured on some TV show and I do love a good French Dip sandwich. One day after work, I decided to drop by. Such a comfortable atmosphere. Yes, this place can get crowded but something about the cafeteria style counter and decor feels so down-to-earth that it's relaxing. The lady that took my order was very sweet, as well. French dip, potato salad, cole slaw, and a slice of apple pie to go. Everything tasted fresh, hot, and hit the spot. It's not going to be a mindblowing feast, but it's comfort food so you get what you paid for. The apple pie, though, was my favorite. GREAT filling to crust ratio and I am a pie EXPERT. :] Maybe that's something I shouldn't be so proud about... *sigh*

Yo Yelpers! This place is pretty good if you like dusty floors and sticky table tops! This is the only reason why I didn't give this place 5 stars. Dust on my burgundy gators just ain't cool!! But really, the sandwiches are every bit as good as the other reviews say they are. Delicious french dip with spicy french mustard on a crisp roll with your choice of meat (pork, beef, lamb, turkey and ham) makes for an awesome sandwich. You should also try their brownies.....YUM YUM YUMMMMY!!!! 蔠e also tried their potato salad and Caesar salad, also pretty darn good. The funny thing about this place is that their lines for ordering food is not as organized as it should. Think of the lines here like the lines you would find in a meat market without having to pick a number. If you don't get the butchers attention first then your out of luck. So if you plan on coming here and ordering the beef sandwich with a fried egg (only available in the morning) double dipped, then hollar at ya boy.

Was pretty cool to check out because it's a LA landmark, but was pretty disappointed with the food. I've had way better french dip--moist, juicy, flavorful. Here, the meat was dry and didn't have much flavor. The bread was too crumbly and hard too. All in all, fun to check out once, but not worth going back.

Got the lamb sandwich regular dipped, and it was simply superb! Next time though, I will be getting my sandwich double-dipped, because I felt like my sandwich was a little too dry. Be careful with their mustard. That stuff kicks you! The lemonade was $.75 and it tasted great. I also got the macaroni salad on the side, which was also very tasty. It was very fresh and just the right amount of creamy. Note: Philippe's only accepts CASH! No credit cards/debit cards. They do have an ATM machine in the restaurant though.

Tell the lady what u want, she dips the bread in the juice and puts the meat in the buns. Taste wise.

For a restaurant that's been around for over a hundred years (for serious), they sure do look great. It would be easy to underestimate their sandwiches, but I encourage you to slow down, take your time and savor the deliciousness. Everything they make has been made from scratch with no shortcuts. This is a very disciplined system and they really know what they're doing. Return the love, get it double dipped.

With over 1700 reviews, does it really matter what I have to say? The potato salad was excellent. The French dip was pretty good, although nothing to get too excited about.

Let me talk about the mustard for a sec. 蔍t's unusual because it's not actually very mustard-y. 蔠hat it tasted like was horseradish, or wasabi, I don't know which because often "wasabi" at sushi places is actually "horseradish". 蔅ut I digress. 蔜his mustard was so spicy that my EARS burned. 蔄nd I truly, truly mean that literally. 蔜he sensation went from my tongue strait up my nose, to my eyes, and somehow to my ears. 蔞ery exciting, let me tell you. By the time I figured out how much mustard the sandwich needed to taste interesting, it was gone. 蔍 was hungry and it did the trick-- meaty, bready, and spicy. 蔍 should have brought the rest of the mustard with me to spice up the hour-and-a-half train ride home.

I guess I find the french dip to be just dry and no mater how much au jus you dip into it it still tastes dry. Their is really no flavoring period in my taste buds to grasp the goodness of the sandwich. I guess next time I will have to try the lamb because I can't say it all sucks but just what I have had.

This joint is a perfect example of "hype kills all." I know not everyone will agree with me, but I could of made the beef dipped sandwich at home. It is a land mark because its been there forever so I will give it credit for that but everything else is whatever.

Came here for the first time since I was a little kid, sharing my love of Los Angeles with my boy. He ordered the Lamb French Dip with Swiss, I ordered the Turkey French Dip with Jack, and we split a side of potato salad. To drink, I took the 9-cent coffee, and he took the 45-cent lemonade. The macaroni salad was our favorite, even though we realized it was just a little cold macaroni with some mayo and relish. Oh, they won't give you a side of the au jus, wtf? Ah well. As far as the sandwiches go-- delish! The lamb was a teensy bit fatty, and the turkey a teensy bit dry, but this place is a Los Angeles classic, how can you hate it?! 8:00 pm on Sunday, it was pretty dead. Also, freezing cold inside. I recommend a sweater. No credit cards! But there is an ATM available inside. Also, free parking! Genius. Open until 10 pm.

The simplicity of this place is the key to why I like it so much. Meat, bread dipped in brown goodness (everyone knows that brown is the best flavor of them all) and a small dollop of spicy mustard.

If only I lived a smidge closer and was less lazy I would be there more often.

Maybe I'm not that big of a french dip fan. 蔍t was tasty, the price on coffee was good. My friend got the lamb dip because he loves lamb but he says it wasn't as tasty and still had the odor to it (more so than when he usually orders lamb anywhere else).

Anyway, for an awesome French Dipped Sandwich in a 1920s atmosphere, along with great service, great pricing ($5.55 a sandwich), and most importantly free parking visit Philippe's. Place has been open for 100 yrs! Too bad they aren't open 24hrs, I would be there right now. Careful with the horseradish mustard, it packs a punch. This place gets pretty busy so expect a line. However, your sandwiches are made upon order and ready immediately. If your into lamb, theirs is great.

We were in Chinatown when the BF spotted this and he said it's really good based on the TV show Man vs Food. After coming here, it's probably the last time I'll ever let him make any decision in our relationship, food related at least. I've never even heard of this place before till that day...and I was surprised how many stars it has on yelp when I got home. $6 for a plain 6" beef sandwich...what's so good about it again? The sauce they dip the bread with is NOTHING SPECIAL. I also gave their hot mustard a try and it was YUCKY! It's just another plain sandwich with beef to me. Good thing I came here with no expectation or else I'd be highly disappointed. I'm sure you'll see me at subway more often than Phil.

I came in with too high of an expectation. My French Dip Beef sandwich with swiss did not live up to all the hype. The sandwich was pretty small. Not very flavorful unless you add the hot mustard with every bite. Most importantly, the sandwich was not hot, just barely warm. Everything is "a la cart" so you have to order everything separately and the bill adds up. If you want a decent meal, you end up spending more than you expect in this "hole-in-the-wall" establishment. Not worth a revisit for me.

Double-dipped beef sandwich with a side of potato salad and lemonade. The place is always filled with throngs of people, and it is easy to see that good food attracts people like bees to a beehive. At first glance, you would wonder why a slab of meat between two pieces of bread deserves so much fame and popularity. However, once you've tried the sandwich, double-dipped, you'll be constantly thinking about how delicious and mouth-watering it is. I hear the pork is also very tasty. Also, if you spread the potato salad on the sandwich before taking a bite, it gives a nice contrast between hot and cold.

I'm pretty surprised that this place only got 4 stars. Truly exceptional, long lines don't lie. Best french dip, be sure to get your sandwich double dipped! Can't go wrong with the beef, my personal favorite is the lamb but I'd only suggest if you really like lamb. Enjoy!

My momma started taking me to this place when I was 12 years old. She thought it was original due to peanuts being thrown on the floor. So we all got a kick out of throwing our peanut shells on the floor and then at each other and then it was time to go. French dip - very good here.

In the Battle of the French Dip Sandwiches, it's always down to the main contenders: Philippe's vs. Cole's P.E. Buffet. Mr. Foodie Know It All Jonathan Gold sides with Cole's as the better sandwich, and I will side with Mr. Gold this time (he's more often than not WAY off the mark with Chinese food). When it comes to atmosphere, I will side with Philippe's since I am not into the homeless chic vibe of Cole's. Plus, you cannot find parking at Cole's and there's an entire free parking lot at Philippe's....as rare a thing in Chinatown as a decent meal. The place has character, which counts, since most of LA is as charming as a stripmall (wonder why?). 蔜he people are real, from all walks of life, all ages, all income levels. Personally, I think there sandwiches are a bit dry. Love the fact that the coffee is still nine cents a cup. Choke on that, Starf*cks! Crazy about the breakfast here. Probably the thing they do best. Adore the sawdust on the floor. Ditto for the newspaper counter. In a world that's increasingly faster, "smarter" and cheaper, Philippe's is a wonderful throwback to bygone era, a living museum, a national treasure for LA.

I am a sucker for history and a sucker for simplicity that tastes good. I'm also a taster so don't go to a new place with me unless you're willing for me to taste some of your food if we don't get the same thing (I will offer some of mine too). 蔛aying that. 蔍 tried this place yesterday for the first time ever. �I just liked it. 蔣ou know how you walk in a place and you just like it. 蕋he setup the people it just feels nice to be there. 蔄t the entrance (candy counter) there is a pamphlet that explains the history of this place as well as "complimentary" postcards. �Oh, I also love free things. Anyway because the prices were right we ordered Three dipped sandwiches - pork, turkey and beef. 蔍 actually liked the pork and turkey more than the beef. 蔍 assumed the turkey would be dry but was pleasantly surprised that it wasn't. �In fairness to the beef it was eaten later in the day (taken home). 蔍 just may have to go back to order it because I do believe in fairnes so a second impression is due. We also tried two sides - coleslaw and potato salad. 蔍 liked them both . 蔜he hot mustard is a great compliment to the sandwich and I may have to get a jar of it. It was great not to have to worry about parking (I parked in the back) Oh this place also got a plus because when we walked in you could read the "first timers" on our face and the lady at the entrance was oh so helpful. I think next time I will try one of their pickled eggs - just because I've never had one before. 蔠e went early so many people were ordering breakfast. Lots of seating space, upstairs and down

I don't know what it is about this place. Been eating here for years and it's the same basic thing: bread and meat, dipped. Maybe it's the old school charm of the place. Maybe it's the clear-your-plugged-nostrils mustard. Or the sides like potato salad, mac salad, or cole slaw. Or the awesome pies. Or the simple pleasure of lemonade. The sum of the parts, perhaps? No, it's not going to be the best meal you've ever had. But there's some magic here that makes this basic sandwich something special. And stick to the reliable, golden stuff: any sandwich, one side, one slice of pie for dessert (banana cream is my favorite) and a glass of lemonade. Avoid the ultra-greasy chili and the ultra-boring beef stew. And park for free at either of the two adjacent parking lots.

Got into the Standard late on a midweek night and didn't know where to go eat so went online and found that Phillipe's was relatively close by and they were famous for their French Dips so decided to check it out. �I think they do French Dips pretty good but I guess it's just probably not my favorite thing to eat. 蔍 love Hot Mustard so glad they had some of that for me to dip my French Dip into. �Since it is an LA institution, I'm glad I got to try it at least once. 蔍 like the "confortable" interior with the sawdust and cafeteria style. 蔞ery laid back.

I wasn't impressed with their sandwich in the past; I just didn't understand the hype. 蔍 went there yesterday and got a pork dip sandwich and a beef stew. Beef Stew: 蔅eef stew is good with big time, mucho home made taste. The tender lean beef chunks are great (the best part if you ask me). This is comfort food; I can taste the carrots, potatoes as if they were raw. The soup is plain and basic in flavor and tastes healthy. Pork Sandwich: 蔜he sandwich is like I remembered, dry bread, smallish and no real impact or punch. 蔅ut what's this? I can distinctly taste, but not a whole lot, the bread and the meat flavor come alive in my mouth, that fantastic basic, plain taste from combination of meat and bread. 蔍 think the bread is still on the dry side (but it's probably good for retaining the dip sauce) 蔉or a moment I quietly enjoy and savor the taste. It's the taste that I remember as a kid when eating plain sandwiches from numerous no name delis that don't use any flavor on their meats nor sauces. So... 蔍s this why Philippe's is still popular? Because of their back to the basics food? The high quality meats? Or combination of atmosphere and the food? Note: Better the next day!? 蔍 had the takeout sandwich the next day straight out of the refrigerator, it tasted better then when new IMHO, strange, the bread didn't get all soggy like I expected, but I'm not complaining.

There's not a whole lot I can say about this place that hasn't already been covered, it's an institution of Los Angeles. I was first introduced to Philippe's when I was a kid by my sister and have been returning nearly every time I'm in the area. 蔜his place has a pretty extensive menu actually, but it's the French Dip sandwiches that keep people coming back. 蔜he have just the right bread, tender meat, and mix of Au Jus sauce that make a delightfully simple, yet delicious sandwich. 蔕f course, another part of the Philippe's story is the mustard, as they say - "ti's hot, but good." Prices here are quite reasonable, and then there's that coffee that's still offered at something like nine cents a cup. 蔍t's got that sawdust floors vibe, tables and booths fill up the place, and the ordering counter is one long 蕎all where all the action happens. �蔜his restaurant has been covered by the media well, so there's plenty more to read up on this place outside Yelp. 蔍t's been around for 100 years this year, and I don't see any reason it won't be around for another hundred years. This is a great place to hit up right before a Dodger game...not only for the food, but you definitely won't be the only True Blue fan there.

When I stopped eating mammals almost 20 years ago, there were two foods I knew were going to be the hardest to forgo: bacon and french dip sandwiches. And so discovering Philippe's and their perfect turkey french dip made me very, very happy. Turkey with swiss, double-dipped. Two lemonades. More spicy mustard than I really should be trying to eat. This is happiness on a tray. I love the lines (they move so quickly), the counter ladies, the sawdust on the floors, and the communal tables where you never know who you might meet. I miss the old mustard containers with their little mustard spoons, but am begrudgingly learning to live with the new squeeze bottles.

I remember seeing this place on the show Man vs Food and I had been Dying (note the capitol D) to come here ever since. Then, one day, I was in the area and looked up and saw the sign....and I opened up my eyes , I saw the sign! 蔍t took a while before it dawned on me that THIS was the PLACE!!!!!!! I was sold before I even went in. I got to the door and I had to step down some stairs as if I was entering a basement and little by the little the scene of the restaurant emerged the further down the stairs I went. I started stressing out because there were LINES of people EVERYWHERE. But, they had a system and the lines actually moved pretty swiftly. The order clerks actually take their time with you. They don't rush or make you feel rushed in any way. I really appreciated this as this is a quality of service you dont get many places in LA. Its something that sorta died with the ages, good ol' home-style customer service :) Its the patience in the people and the preperation that really makes this place stick. Alas, I orderd the Orignal sandwhich with Lamb. I enjoyed watching her carve the meat fresh off the bone and onto my plate...then she takes the bread and dips it ever-so-seductively in the sauce or the "debris" as they call it. It was like watching Picasso paint an original right before your eyes...what a piece of art this was! and I couldnt wait to tear it apart!! I also took the liberty in ordering a side of slaw and a slice of custard pie. I sit down and notice the spicey mustard and had to try it. Pretty potent stuff. Go easy with it though, you don't want to embarass yourself! I'm already a repeat customer, and it's only my first visit!

It's one of those questions where someone asks "If you were to pick 10 restaurants and only 10 to eat at for the rest of your life... what are your ten restaurants?" For the rest of your life? It will be hard for me to pick the nine other, but Philippe is definitely one of the 10 I would pick. To say this place is great is a huge understatement. This establishment has been around for for years, decades for that matter. One cant go wrong with any of there sandwiches, but one that became a favorite of mine is the lamb sandwich. By far the best! a) Sandwiches - all are great, but Lamb is the best. b) Potatoe Chips - they have them all. c) side dishes - Chili, potatoe salad, hard boil and purple boiled egg are great! Cole Slaw is delicious, but the Pantry is a bit better. Sorry. d) Pumpkin pie awesome, Apple pie great, Banana Cream...well its the truth - definite must! e) Beverages - sodas, beer, wine, water they have it all... make sure to try there lemonade, its very refreshing. *** if going during lunch hours, avoid 11:45am to 1:00pm it will be packed. Otherwise, this is a definite place to go and it is a historical landmark!

So I guess a cop named officer French came in here an ordered a sandwich which accidentally fell in steak drippings. He took it anyway and loved it. Voila, the french dip is born! That's the story according to Adam from Man V. Food. Whatever the origins may be, this is one hell of a sandwich. The ingredients are very simple. Bread, Au jus, Meat, sometimes cheese, and that's all! You don't need much to have something amazing. My choice of meat was the beef and I might be sticking with that because it's so good! By the way, the hot mustard is dangerously delicious. It will burn the hairs off your nostrils but it feels so good! The sides are standard affair. I got the coleslaw and the potato salad. Both of which were nothing too special, but very good. Save room for dessert because they do have some good treats. What I thought was rice pudding came out to be custard. I ate it anyway, and was very satisfied. Make sure you bring your appetite and some patience since you'll be waiting a little bit. But it will be worth it in the end.

Seriously...? 蔍 waited in line for 20 min for that? Seriously? 蔍 will admit the french dip is good, but it's not worth waiting in line for hours for a sandwich dipped in au jus! 蔍've had waaaaay better french dips. I'm a fan of their spicy mustard and their lemonade for 75 cents, but other than that... the sandwich is just okay to me. If you've never been here before, here are a few tips! - bring cash (cash only / atm inside) - park down the street (parking is always full) - bring a magazine to read in line (it's looooong) - have someone find a table while you're in line - don't expect to eat fries (they don't serve any) - don't expect to get a side of au jus (they don't give any) - you'll hear guys raving over how good the food is (BULL$#&T) - expect to clear your sinuses with that Spicy Mustard - expect to eat with people from a different state - bring your earplugs (it's loud from people talking) - be prepared to be squished (people everywhere) - learn to eat fast (you feel guilty that others are waiting for a table) Some may say that this place has the best french dip is So Cal, but I think otherwise. 蔜he historical value of this place is nice. 蔄nd it's good to be part of the LA hype and eat at the place of the very 1st french dip. 蔅ut times change and better french dips have evolved. Once you try the french dip at Houston's or La Grande Orange... 蕐ou'll end up hating Philippes!

Best way i can think to describe Phillipes: I was recently with a group of friends, and phillipes came up. One of my buddies exclaimed "i've never actual been there." I told him he had to try and I would take him soon. Upon hearing this, everyone else stopped mid conversation and at the same time asked "when are we going to Phlillipes?" The beef is great, but for my money a double dipped lamb is the way to go. IMO, this is one of the only "LA Institutions" that actually lives up to the hype.

Medicore at best. Sandwich wasn't what I expected, The line at 11 was semi long, expected though. The potato salad was bland and boring. the dip for the sandwich was pretty decent, but the one thing I thought that was really done well was the mustard, at first taste it burnt the crap outta my nose,but I kept going in for more.. All in all I wasn't too impressed with the place, but the hype is what killed it, im sure. I expected a million dollars when all I got was a 2 dollar bill.

You want the best bread-meat (and possibly cheese) combination in Los Angeles? Then go to the place that has been serving french dips for over 100 years. Philippe's is that old school spot, where you stand in line and order from a snappy woman who expects you to know what you want and state it clearly and immediately. I am never let down by the dips or the sides. For me it's usually a lamb and blue cheese, although the beef is just as popular, or the pork and swiss. Man do I love their pork. Double-dipped, always double-dipped. And it's right up there with Canter's for my favorite potato salad in LA. I like my potato salad a little sweet and that's how they do it at Philippe's. Don't forget the sinus clearing mustard that is available at every table. Use cautiously because it can wreck your taste buds for a bite or two, but it is very complimentary when used with care. Don't forget to grab a pack of peanut m&m's from the candy stand on your way out, or some pie, coconut cream is the best. Not changing their formula has kept Philippe's in business for 100 years and it will keep them around for another century because it's that simple and that good.

I stumbled across Philippe's while in search of the Tamale Festival that I never found. My boy friend was complaining that if he is not going to eat a damn Tamale, then he would settle for a sandwich covered with au jus. After j walking across Alameda St. and almost getting hit my a Dash bus we entered the restaurant. For the most part this place looks totally untouched from the 1900's minus the color TV. The floor is covered with wood shavings and the style of the lines would remind you of the long ride at Six Flags. �After my 20 minute wait I ordered my Beef sandwich for $5.55 and a Lemonade for 75 cent. 蔜he lady at the register asked me what I wanted for my side while pointing down at the cold case and ewwwwwwwwww!. Never should coleslaw and potato salad look so: 1. white, �. bland and �.EXTRA wet. I played it safe and went with the bag of potato chips. 蔠hen my food arrived I was a little worried if my sandwich would be any good. �About 5 minutes into our search for a table I 蕎as able to take my first bite while walking and I was totally pleased. The meat was covered in juice and the spicy mustard was just right. I give Philippe's 2 start for 蔭 few reasons: parking is really bad with China Town and Olivera St. both next door, the chairs have no back which shows how bad my posture really is, I feel like I could get a sandwich like that at some other place and with bland white or a liquor store bag of chips as my side options it's not that serious people. As a pro this is a good place to watch a football game with nice folks.

Phillipe serves The. Best. French dip sandwich I have had in my entire life, and I've tasted them coast to coast. 蔍 absolutely love their melt-in-your-mouth, perfectly cooked generous helpings of 蔮eef on crusty but soft bread. 蔣ou choose whether you want the sandwich dry, once dipped, or twice dipped. I go with the once dipped with melted bleu cheese on top. This is one of the most delicious things I have ever eaten, and I can't imagine that it won't be the same for you. 蔣ou will never need another French dip place after you go here. 蔖lus, the sandwiches here are twice as big and much cheaper than Cole's. The restaurant itself is super casual, cafeteria style eating with pre-made sides and long tables. 蔣ou'll be surrounded with everyone from people in 3 piece suits to those who have no permanent address. �This rating is for the sandwich and atmosphere; I haven't been called by the sides--they look meh. 蔅ut who cares, the sandwich will stuff you beyond need for anything else.

For one reason or another, I just don't get the whole Philippe's thing. That's not to say because I prefer Cole's instead, because they're food is worse in my opinion. I do like dipped sandwiches, and I think that Philippe's makes a pretty decent sandwich..but I don't think it's the greatest sandwich that ever sandwiched. I will say that their special "mustard" sauce is absolutely awful, and I'd stay away from it at all cost. I will hand it to them for preserving the history though, nostalgia is definitely in the air when you're sitting in one of their booths and having a dipped sandwich.

Here's what I order EVERY time (guaranteed!): double dip beef with bleu cheese (yes the bread gets totally soggy but that is its charm haha)... pile on the spicy mustard too cause that stuff is the bomb dot com! 蔭nd if you really love it like me, you can buy some to take home :) one of those purple eggs... yes it looks weird but it tastes good potato salad (standard like you can get at any deli but it's good to eat with a bite of the soggy sandwich hehe) Parking sucks (it is LA ya know). It's always crowded but the lines move semi-fast. 蔜he iced tea & lemonade is super cheap but the glasses are super tiny. 蔕rder more than 1 unless you want to try to wait in line again haha And seating is cafeteria style so you will end up sittng with strangers. 蔅ut, again, it's part of the charm. Love the sandwiches here & I will continue coming here as much as possible while living in So Cal!

Everybody and their mother has reviewed this Los Angeles landmark so I'm going to critique the food and experience. Having gone there during the World Cup [yes this review has been long overdue] at the Ghana v Uruguay match at lunch hour, it was quite packed, but people in line were quite friendly and though it took quite a while to order, the price was decent. If I can recall the order, it was one beef one turkey and two lemonades. I'm not gonna lie, the food was good. Though people really love this place, I just find it real good. The patronage here is great and it definitely makes me ant to come back more often. Pros: -Historic place, means food has to be good -Food has to be good or else it wouldn't get this kind of press -Drink Prices, I haven't seen prices of some drinks below a dollar since I was a kid. Cons: -Historic place and good food leads to big touristy crowds -Parking is atrocious since its by Chinatown ***2/3

How I dreamt about going to Philippe's and taking a chunky bite out of my double dipped lamb sandwich! 蔍've heard about and seen this place a numerous times on the Food Channel, and the Travel Channel, that I've decided to take a drive up to LA one day, just to experience Philippes original French sandwich... and oh man.. what a disappointment.... We arrived at Philippes at about 1:00 p.m. completely starved! 蔍 thought this would be unfair judgement of their food, since anything would taste great right then. 蔠e ordered Lamb sandwich with Bluecheese, Beef sandwich with Swiss Cheese, and Pork with Jack Cheese, with the side of pickled eggs, dill pickles, cole slaw, and to top it off, pickled pig's feet! �Never had it, and thought it would be a great experience!) One bite, and we all looked at each other with the puzzled look? 蔠as this it? 蔛houldn't there be more to this sandwich and their reputation then this dry not so well seasoned meat sandwhich? 蔍 have to tell ya, despite our massive hunger, and the cozy all Americana, yet museum like friendly environment, the food was completely over rated. 蔍've had a simple beef sandwhich or a pastrami sandwich from a neighborhood joint that was much tastier and properly seasoned than Philippes! Keep in mind, that my remark wasn't based only on one sandwhich. 蔠e tried their famous three different types of sandwhiches, and they were all so mediocre... 蔖ickled eggs and pig's feet was actually quite pleasant. 蔆ole slaw was actually delicious! 蔒ustard was good and wasabi hot. 蔅ut their famous sandwiches sucked! If this was an unknown neighborhood joint, I would not be coming back... We all were soooo sorry for driving 2 hours to get there and leaving feeling so empty... however, the highlight of the Philippe was their well priced homemade lemonade and iced tea, and their .09 cents coffee! 蔖roblem is, they are not in the iced tea and coffee business! Dang it! 蔍 so much looked forward to giving great review and wanting to go back here.....no mo!

When you walk into Philippe's, you are immediately struck by the fact you have entered an L.A. institution. When you've tasted the sandwiches, you will know you have arrived--if you haven't tried lamb before this is a good place to start, but pork sandwiches work for me too.

Philippe's is a staple in LA. This is our go to spot before every USC home football game. I tend to get the same thing every time. Double dipped roast beef, lemonade, Stella, & some kind of potato or pasta salad. Some of the same ladies have been working there for my whole life. This is a must in LA. A couple years ago they were shut down for a few days for rats... sadly this still doesn't deter me. Best french dip ever.

I have been there today my 3rd time. They serve good breakfast, coffee is very cheap and the refill is only $ 0.09, (this is correct, not a typing error) However this place can get crowded on a Sunday morning and the way they are set up to take orders and hand out the food is not very efficient, so you may wait for a while to be able to order and enjoy your breakfast. But when you finally get it, I am sure that you will enjoy it. Every time I go there the place fills up quickly. Parking easy and free and just located a couple of blocks from Downtown.

A whopping 5 stars for a landmark restaurant that's been around for over 100 years and is still outstanding quality and taste. Of course the French Dip is the centerpiece, and as with any sandwich, it begins & ends with the bread. Double dipped on both halves in their super flavorful jus, the meat perfectly compliments the perfectly soaked bread. I cannot rave enough. Make certain to order pie, it is great after the sandwich. I'm a LA native, and this was my first visit here in 50+ years. Long overdue. Makes me proud of my hometown.

I love it. Not even taking away a star for the wait that there sometimes is, because it's worth it. Old school vibe and old school prices. The chili is AMAZING. The sandwiches, no matter what kind of meat you get, are AMAZING. There's even a parking lot. This place is the best!!

Seriously... what's the hype about? The counter people aren't very concerned with the 'dip' aspect of the sandwich. They barely wet the bread, much less saturate it with beefy goodness. The flavor of the meat was delicious but it cried out for a serious dunk in au jus. Overall, the place gets two stars because it has potential, but it needs to stop taking its fame for granted and pay attention to genuine quality if it wants to be anything more than a flash in the proverbial pan.

Came here for dinner after 蕋he NBA All Star Jam Session, the place was crowded but not as bad as normal according to a few people in line. I got the beef french dip, a caesar salad, cherry pie and lemonade all was yummy although when i was thinking french dip i thought they would have a cup of dipping sauce on the side and not one side of the bread drenched with sauce it was still good. The salad was in a plastic container so i had to mix the dressing myself. The lemonade was good for the price of 75 cents but no refills. Last but not least the cherry pie so yummy. I'll be back next time i'm in the area and craving for it lol

The service suffers when the place is crowded. 蔜he breakfast was good. 蔉or coffee lovers, I'd suggest to buy 3 cups of coffee per person when ordering; otherwise, you have to wait in line just to get another cup of coffee. 蔏eep in mind that their miscellaneous line shuts down for breakfast. 蔍 stood in line for 20 minutes just to get a 2nd cup. 蔜he place is casual and affordable.

definitely one of the more tastier French dips I've had so far, but I thought it was a little weird, but kinda cool, that their sandwiches come pre-dipped in gravy. I had the lamb sandwich, washed it down with an ice cold brew and I was a happy camper. a little pricey though...

The Classic. 蔣ou can't argue with it. My recommendation -- a beef dip, with a *little* bit of the spicy mustard (it is no joke) and some banana or chocolate cream pie for dessert. 蔕utstanding. Only caveat -- it's cash only, and the ATM there is a service charge monster, so come with greenbacks in hand.

Cee S. couldn't be more right about rating it on its appropriate scale. 蔎ust don't expect too much. I got there at 9:45pm on a weeknight, not too hungry but looking for a late-night snack. 蔒y friends told me to expect a good sandwich, and a good sandwich I got. 蔍t's small but it's very delicious. 蔜he bread was nice and crusty on the outside, and the roast beef was tender and moist. 蔜he iced tea was only $0.55 and with a slice of blueberry pie (which I must say was very very good) I got a good meal for under $7. Make sure you double dip your sandwich, and ask for their hot mustard. 蔎ust use it sparingly because they don't call it "hot" mustard for nothing.

Aahh this is where I go after a Lakers or a Clippers game. A french dip beef sandwich, a side of cole slaw and an ice cold lemonade. I learned of this place from Huel Howser's California's Gold TV show about 10 years ago. Went there the next day and the same lady that Huel interviewed happened to be the one that helped me. The story was that a long time ago a cop came in to order a beef sandwich and the server accidentally dropped the bread in the sauce. The cop said its okay, I'll take it anyway.

Philippe's is one of those places that if you live in Los Angeles you must visit it at least ONCE...The French Dips are amazing! 蔇o not forget the Side Dishes (Chili, Cole Slaw, Chips, etc...). 蔜he upstairs dining area will take you back to a time when stools were the norm at eateries.

The door says this place has been around since 1908, which means it has to be one of the oldest surviving eating establishments in Los Angeles. It does not disappoint. �Ordering is kind of like a game as you stake out a spot at the counter, wait for an opening and make your move. Once you make your selection and exchange money for food the search begins for an open stool at one of the many community style tables. We came before the lunch rush so seating was not bad. By the time we left, however, there was nary an open stool in the house. The food is no nonsense American fare. The turkey dip I had was real not processed, the spicy mustard has a kick like no other and the iced tea is only 60 cents! I suspect that many come to Philippe's overhyped and end up underwhelmed. But for someone like myself that had never heard of the place let alone thought about eating here, I was simply blown away.

The beef dip with blue cheese is my favorite, and the lamb dip is deeply flavored and rich and decadent (try putting some coleslaw on your sandwich next time, too). I have a ridiculous, irrational love for the picked eggs. The beef stew and chili are unique and excellent. An LA landmark, worth it every time I make the trip, even with a wait. Delicious, simple, dependable.

A long time Los Angeles institution, Philippe's features the french dip sandwiches. The reason why they are called French dip sandwiches is not because of a french roll, that they use. They French, because Philippe was French. The dip sandwiches was actually a mistake that they did when they first opened. After the mistake, everyone kept asking for the dipped sandwiches. They feature Beef, Pork, Ham, Lamb, and Turkey with different types of cheeses. The meats are thinly sliced with the bread dipped in the juices (the GOODNESS). You can see the Beef and Turkey sandwiches on the photos below. Their sandwiches are less than 6 bucks. . . so its cheap and good! When you get the Philippe's there's two large parking lots, with one of them across the street. Make sure you have one in your party stand in line to get the orders, and another to secure seating. Philippe's is great, right before going to Dodger Games. One of these days, I am going to try their breakfast.

Wow. I went here today for the first time to meet some people. I waited over 30 minutes to get a freaking sandwich. Seriously how long does it take to put meat between two pre-sliced pieces of bread. The excuse I was given was there had to be an event in downtown to cause the crowds. Wait an event in downtown LA, no way! Once I finally got my food, I ordered a beef dip sandwich, side of potato salad and a bowl of chili to slit with my BF. The only thing that was good was the chili. I ate the potato salad out of starvation and saved the sandwich for my Chihuahuas. This place is only inexpensive if you order just the sandwich. The charge for cheese and pickle! Are you kidding me?! What a joke. Everyone assumes this place is good because its been around for 100 years, however I believe the placement of this "restaurant" has maintained its business. Right by the downtown train and bus stations, and within walking distance to most shops in downtown. Makes for easy access therefore the people come. Now let me get to the homeless people who smelled up the joint to point I almost vomited in my mouth. The people themselves were not the problem, it was their suitcases full of crap up on the counter next to where my food should go. That has to violate some health code! I had to pee for about 45 minutes but decided fighting with the prostitute who had staked out the bathroom and the moms with little kids just was not worth it. Next the fat old people running into me every five second because they cannot see was a little irritating. One lady actually cut in front of me. When I asked her what she was doing she said, "You are not going to let an old lady in front of you?" Um no. I waited in line and you can do the same. If you are unable to stand that long, send someone in your place. The only two good things about this place that earned them the two stars are; free parking in downtown and once you actually get to order you can grab a beer to wash down the gross sandwich. I say avoid at all cost. If you are seriously craving a dip sandwich, check out The Dip.

The original French Dip restaurant? Uh, no brainer - You've gotta try it! This place is amazingly delicious. What is better than fresh cooked beef piled a top a soft, chewy roll - all tied together with the magic flavor of the Au Jus? Hello - Not too much! This joint has a great vibe: it's casual, loud, and messy which is just the type of place you'd love to enjoy these delicious sandwiches. They've got great sides too! It is so hard to decide, but you'll probably be in heaven either way. Only down side is the massive wait! Each time I have been here, there has been an intense line, especially before/after Dodger games! Worth it though!

On my ever revolving list of places that I would go to should someone tell me "you can have one more meal before you die", Philippe's is one of the few that is ALWAYS on that list. 蔖hillipe's is the originator and still pinnacle of the french dip sandwich. 蔍t is hands down the best french dip to be had any where period, full stop, end of story, strong message follows. Sides, yeah I've seen them and have occasionally partaken in the potato and macaroni salad but when I go to Philippe's I get french dip tunnel vision. 蔜hey also have other menu offerings but I can't speak to their quality since I've never had them. My pics are simple: 蔐amb, beef, pork, turkey (in that order but not necessarily all in one sitting). 蔄ll double dipped and the beef getting a little more mustard than the rest since the beef has the where with all (flavor wise) to not be easily over powered by the mustard. 蔛peaking of mustard, if you are a fan of all things spicy then do yourself a favor and take a jar of mustard home with you. 蔣ou may not be able to make a french dip the way Philippe's does but you can partake of their sinus clearing mustard anytime you like. 蔜o go with the sandwiches potato salad and what ever you like to drink. No matter where you are in Southern California, if you love a great sandwich you owe it to yourself to go to Philippe's at least once. 蔍'll also mirror some of the other Yelpers comments by adding that you should be prepared for a line especially on the weekends during normal lunch hours. 蔍've never bothered to even look to see if they take credit now since when I first started going there about five years ago they only took cash, so save yourself some grief and bring cash. 蔜o go along with the lines you may have to be creative with where you park since it can be tricky. 蔋owever when you are finally sitting with what is one of the best sandwiches you'll ever have, it will all be worth it. 蔜his is one of those Los Angeles institutions that has and continues to prove that it's legendary status and reputation are rightfully deserved.

3.5 stars would be my pick. There are long lines at most times you'd want to get a meal. The french dip sandwiches are good, but not outstanding. The hot mustard is maybe the best thing about this place. For all its fame, it's really just a fairly decent cheap sandwich place.

Yay! I'm a fan. You will be hard pressed to find a better tasting French-dipped sandwich than Philippe's. The sandwiches are rather pricey for the size but you forget about all that change you've spent once you dig in! The first thing you'll notice is the scattered sawdust on the floor between the long hash lines of people. Expect to wait at least 10-20 minutes and even longer during lunch/dinner hours. The lemonade is tasty and inexpensive. It's cash only but there is an ATM on site. Next time you're in the downtown/Chinatown area, be sure to try their world famous dipped sandwich (ask for it DOUBLE DIPPED). HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!

Wow-zaa! This place is the place to be when it comes to sandwiches. Though I felt like we were lined up like a herd of cows waiting to get stamped, the wait was well worth it! The inside looks really neat with neat decors and a neon sign that says "Philippe's" at the front counter. Each line had a dedicated "carver" (yes, a real carver), who takes your order. The register is behind all the carvers, which I thought was an interesting set-up. When they give you your total, you place your cash on this little dish on the counter and they pick it up. I ordered the famous pork sandwich, a side of potato salad, a glass of lemonade and shared a piece of pecan pie. Once we got our food, we headed upstairs to their dining area: another interesting find! I was told the restaurant used to be an brothel back in the day and hence the look of individual rooms with hangers and such. Once I dug into the sandwich, I was in heaven! I topped it with their special recipe hot mustard and it was just mouth-watering! I savored every bite! The potato salad was yummy, with the potatoes perfectly mashed into small pieces with an excellent mix of seasonings and mayo. The only thing I have to warn you about is that you will get MAJOR food coma right afterwards. It lasted a few hours for me. ha-ha. Give a visit to Philippe's. It is one of the best french-dip sandwich places in L.A.! There's ample parking in the area, so don't make excuses not to go!

This is one of the best places I've ever eaten. The first time I was here, I was in Los Angeles with my father, and he sent me in just to buy a jar of their famous hot mustard. I never got the chance to eat there, until now. I was in LA recently with my wife, and I wanted to take her somewhere special for lunch. We walked in and we were just blown away from the moment we took our first steps onto the sawdust covered floor. The place was packed with people. We had just missed the lunch rush, and even though we had seen documentaries on Philippe's, we still needed help ordering, because it can be confusing at first. But everyone is really nice, and I walked up to 2 guys about my age and asked them for help and they told me what to do. So Josie and I ordered 2 french dips, a plate of macaroni salad, a plate of potato salad, 2 small bags of chips and 2 Cokes, served in cans. We saw some people had ordered 2 or more sandwiches! Everyone sits together at these long tables, and there are people from all walks of life, different social classes, sitting together, talking and enjoying each others company. As you sit there, it becomes nostalgic, and you get a feel of old Los Angeles. The sandwiches were incredible, and the potato salad and macaroni salad were unbelievable. As we left, we couldn't believe that it took us so long to come here. It was our first time here, but not the last.

First time I've ever been here, and I definitely would make a return trip if I was in the area! I tried their lamb sandwich, macaroni salad, and dill pickle w/a glass of lemonade. 蔜he lamb had a great flavor and was tender; I just wish I had remembered to get swiss cheese on the top! 蔜he macaroni salad was very good. 蔜he dill pickle was nice, but I think I prefer the store-bought Claussen kosher ones (though I could've had bottom-of-the-barrel pickle since it was one of two left in the container at the moment). 蔜he lemonade was perfect! 蔍t's just a shame it comes in a small glass, but for $0.75 it's still a great deal. The interior was pretty much like an old-style deli. 蔜here are multiple lines and you just wait inside until you get to the front. 蔜he floor has sawdust and there are long tables w/bar stools. Definitely worth a shot if you've never been there before. 蔖erhaps you'll also become a fan of Philippe!

I make late night treks here every once in a while. The food is simple and good (tip: always order a pickle or an egg with your sandwich), lemonade is cheap, atmosphere is comfortable - makes you feel like a local. Don't know if they actually invented the french dip, but if I had to pick sides, I'd go with Philippe's. Even though I don't know how to pronounce the name (fil-ee-PAY, fil-EEP, ?). We may never know. Just wish the sandwiches were a little bigger, or a little cheaper, so I could buy two.

I've tried the sandwiches with beef, pork, and lamb (I didn't eat all 3 myself or in one sitting ;P), and I would have to say my favorite was the beef. I thought the lamb was a bit too dry. Also, if you like your sandwich a little soggy and with a little more flavor, I would ask them to double dip it. For the sides I would recommend the pickled beets, potato salad, or macaroni salad. Also, so you don't look like a total noob (1) I learned from watching a little fight go down that you need to make sure you stand in a line that lines up with the cash registers (2) don't try to hand them the cash immediately after you order, they'll will give you a little tray to put your money on.

My BF dragged me here kuz he kept seeing this place featured on the Food Network and he really wanted to try it out. I'd had it a few years before, but it was takeout, so I figured it was lukewarm because we had taken it to go. That is not the case. This time we ate in, and the sandwiches were still lukewarm. The meat was not hot at all. The bread was good - probably the best part of the sandwich. I got the pork and added swiss cheese. The cheese came nowhere close to melting. I was pretty sad about that. Also, if you get their chili, please, ask for beans, onions, and cheese. I was stupid enough to order it "plain", and it tasted like a big bowl of taco filling from del taco. Their lemonade was surprisingly delicious though. And such a great deal at 75 cents a cup. The cups were a little small though, but that was perfect for me because I don't usually drink that much at meals anyway. Anyway, 3 stars for the food. It would have been 4 stars had the sandwich been warm like it should have been. I'd eat it again, probably, but I wouldn't go out of my way for it.

I am an avid viewer of the travel channel and Phillippe's is always on one of the shows so I decided to give it a whirl. The line was as long as they said it was, I waited for about 20 minutes, which isn't too bad for being such a recognized tourist spot. I tried both the beef and turkey (both double dipped) and enjoyed both but it wasn't as amazing as I thought it'd be. 蔍 was expecting my taste buds to be dancing but instead it just made it do a little kick. �The pickles were not so great but the mac was delicious. 蔍'd go back and try the other sandwiches and hope that it would be a better match for me but warning: when they say the mustard is hot, its HOT!

Let me issue my little caveat: This review is favorable, in large part, because of the ambiance--a potentially huge factor in any dining experience, in my book. There, I said it. Now, let me be honest, the food here isn't the best. It's cafeteria food steeped in tradition, old-worldliness, and comfortability. No, they're not the absolute best sandwiches I've had but that's probably because my taste buds have been so accustom to MSG, high fructose corn syrup, and generic seasoning salt for so long that I am not used to the simplicities of bread, cheese, and meat au jus. But on the flip side, it's definitely not the worst sandwich I've had. Far from it. When I bite into the aforementioned bread, cheese, and meat au jus there's nothing quite as satisfying because you're surrounded by decor that's nearly as simple and comfortable. Saw dust on the ground, communal tables with little condiment stations and service so unabashedly old school that you can't help but feel like you've stepped back in time. I'm no fan boy of tradition; I'm only a fan of tradition if it works and Phillipe works. PS--If you're not completely grossed out by it, try the pickled (purple) eggs. I get one every time.

Philippe is good, but not as good as I thought it would be. 蔍 tried double dip beef and double dip lamb, IMO lamb is much better since it has more flavor. 蔜he beef is dry with not too much flavor. 蔜he au jus is amazingly flavorful, totally saved my beef. 蔔ext time I would ask them to not just dip the bread, but completely soak it lol 蔍 am going to give it another try since according to my bf, last time he was here, the beef wasn't that dry. 蔛o maybe we just went on a bad day. The highlight of the night is their pickled pig feet, it is AMAZING! Overall, we like the food, the carvers are nice and friendly and everything is reasonably priced. 蔍 wouldn't make a special trip for it, but I would definitely go there if I am in the area.

I know I'm in the minority on this one, but I thought this place was "just ok." 蔜he wife and I each had the roast beef, double dipped. 蔠e used the hot mustard & everything. It tasted alright, not terrible, not great. 蔅ut truthfully, I thought BJ's Brewhouse in OC had better tasting, and way more TENDER french dip sandwiches.

I love places with history. 蔜his place has it, and you can feel it when you walk in. 蔍t's old LA, and it's very comfortable with good people watching. 蔜he buzz of the crowds waiting in line, the energy of the people working behind the counter, and the fact that you share long tables with strangers and there is sawdust on the floor all lends to its mystique and unique charm. More importantly though is the food!! 蔜he French Dip is amazing. 蔣ou have to try the mustard, but know that it will make your eyes tear up and your nose run for at least 5 minutes afterward. 蔜he hard boiled eggs and all the side dishes are really good. 蔍 recommend a cold beer to go with it all, if you can. It's great to go there in a group, but I've been known to go there alone just because I'm craving their food and enjoy the people watching, as I mentioned above. 蔏ind of a treat and a guilty pleasure all in one. It's an LA fixture and a must-try!

Ew. I read about the cockroach infestations reviews right after a wonderful dinner there... not sure how to take it, but definitely knocks down a star. Now, pretending that I didn't see those terrible reviews... Bf had just gotten off work and we were cruising toward Chinatown for some Pho or bun (pronounced bum!). Except he got lost along the way... blame it on the traffic he says. Somehow the mass amount of traffics made him lose his sense of directions? (Lol) Anyhow, pass the heart of Chinatown and we found ourselves one street across from Philippe's. During the ride he mentioned trying something new beside our usual haunts. Bf pointed out Philippe's and suggest we try it. Philippe's? That's the restaurant on Yelp with all those reviews ! I quickly agreed and we found ourselves there. Walking in was kind of intimidating. Massive amount of people and the restaurant had a very confusing layout. It took us a few minutes to find our way to the cashiers and several more to figure out how and what to order. Being a lamb lover, I easily made my choice. Bf was indecisive so I pointed him toward the pork dip, courtesy of Yelp reviewers. As we inched our way up, our eyes quickly got the better of us. Me: "everyone gets coleslaw, let's get that." Bf: "potato salad too." Me: "how about a pie? everyone got a piece of pie!" Bf: ok At the end of our transaction, we had 1 pork dip, 1 lamb dip, coleslaw, potato salad, lemonade, ice tea, peach pie and cheesecake. It was definitely way too much food, but we polished it off without a hitch. Interestingly, the dijon mustard tastes exactly like the hot mustard at Chinese restaurant. The layout of the place reminds me of cafeteria food, and bf who made it upstairs said it felt creepy and stale like a hospital. If I had known this was a historical LA landmark ahead of time, I might've been better prepared and less judgmental. But going in with a clean slate, the place creeped, food was more expensive than expected ($24.15 for everything), and food was surprisingly good. If I can get over the fact that it just had a cockroach infestation, I'll probably return. Despite my mixed feelings, it was a fun experience. Oh yes, cash only.

This is one of the best places Los Angeles has to offer. Not fancy at all. Simply one of the best sandwiches around. All you need to do is order a beef dip with some hot mustard and you are good to go. But this place is far more then just a great sandwich, its a LA tradition.

After hearing so much about this place, I tried the beef French dip. 蔉irst off, what kind of French dip do they serve without au jus? 蔍've had many French dip sandwiches in my lifetime, and I've never once had to ask for au jus. �When I received my order without au jus, I asked nicely for it and they refused. 蔛o when I got the sandwich, which was "pre-dipped", it was predictably dry and flavorless. 蔜he slaw wasn't bad, but given the fact that I came for the famous French dip, the experience was a resounding disappointment.

Here is what we tried: 1 pork, 1 beef, both double dipped w/ mustard* macaroni salad pickled egg lemonade iced tea IMO I think the food is just okay. Nothing spectacular, and nothing horrible. I would eat here again, but never when it's busy. I was lucky to catch it at a really slow time, but even then the service was amazingly slow. When we walked in, we saw a camera crew there, and learned they were part of the food network. (I think this is why Philippe's gets a lot of business, all the publicity and promotional hype, I know that's how I came across it.) Overall, this place is good if your in the area and its convenient, but I probably wouldn't go too far out of the way for it. *mustard is highly notable in my book, but watch the quantity, unless you like that teary eyed sinus kick in the face!

Were my expectations too high? Did I get overly excited while waiting in line for 30 minutes? Or did I order the wrong sandwich? This place is alright... I am not so sure I would drive out of my way again to try it but maybe I should give it another try since everyone else's reviews are fantastic. I found the meat to be rather dry and the bread to be too hard. The potato salad had too much mayonnaise and was too heavy for my taste. But perhaps this is the style of the food and I am simply not accustomed to it.

Love Phillipe's. Beef dip, double dip, side of slaw,and 2 lemonades. Sit where you can, slap some slaw on the dip, smother some of their famous HOT mustard, and take a bite and savor that flavorful beef and au jus, with the sweet and creamy slaw, followed by a tingle in your nasal passage. It always brings a tear to my eye, but it's probably the mustard. My order hasnt changed in 15 years. Sure, I've tried everything else, but something about this order takes me back down memory lane. Where else can you still get a $0.09 cup of joe? It may not be the best cup of coffee in the world, but for 9 cents??? Cmon! Beef stew is good, bean soup is great, stop by in the AM and try their biscuits... to die for. Another great thing about Phillipe's is you can stop by before the Dodger game, get it to-go, they'll staple it up for you and I've never had security hassle me at the gate when they see that good ole Phillipe logo.

The French Dips are amazing. I've had the Lamb, Beef, Pork...however by far my favorite is the Lamb. Lemonade is only 75 cents and the coffee (not great coffee, but it worked) was only 9 cents! I'm a fan of the coleslaw as well. Grab a slice of pie (boysenberry, apple, lemon meringue, banana creme, and more) or a donut (those are are my favorite). Parking is free, but limited...especially if there is a Dodger game about to start or just finished (tons of Dodger fans role through). Cash only btw (they have an ATM in the store if you forget). Overall, the experience was great. Great service (especially for cafeteria style) & 蔳reat food. I know some folks don't care for the style of dips here...no au jus on the side...they actually dip it before they hand it to you (which make the bread a bit soggy). This is part of the history of Philippe's...so get over it and enjoy.

Just like the Original Pantry Cafe, Philippe's is one of the most overrated restaurants in Los Angeles. I can't even begin to comprehend how this place got so popular and why its so busy. I'm not picky with food and I generally find most of the things I eat quite good. Philippe's Roast Beef Sandwich (Yes I requested for double dip) was so disappointing. The meat first of all was dry. I expect the amount of time Phillipe's spends preparing the meat, one would actually find fall of the bone flavors in every bite. Not here! Man vs Food definitely added more publicity to this place, but you won't ever find me here. There are a lot of other fine establishment in LA i would rather go to, then to spend my money at Philippe's.

Ugh. The thought of the lunch I had here makes me feel ill. I had the lamb sandwich, which was so salty I could barely finish the first half. I don't like that it comes pre-dipped, so that the bottom slice of bread becomes so soggy that it peels off at a mere touch. The bleu cheese that I ordered with it was unceremoniously slapped on in huge chunks, which totally commandeered the flavor balance in each bite - I ended up having to take out a lot of the cheese myself. The only redeeming thing about the sandwich is the lamb meat inside, which was tenderly cooked. I also tried to potato salad, which I felt like I could have purchased at a local Ralph's. Nothing special at all. And the only reason that I can fathom anybody purchasing the pickled egg is because of its rambunctious coloring. I couldn't finish any of the three items I had purchased. Will definitely not be coming back.

The place for sandwiches. Time has stopped here. It's like you're back in the early 1950's or late 40's. 蔜he joint has a old school look and charm. They even have the telephone boxes you stand in and pay money to make a phone call like they did way back in the 20th century. I had the French dip roast beef sandwich before and you can't go wrong with that. 蔅ut this time I had the French dip (double dip) Lamb sandwich with blue cheese as my choice of cheese and it went very well with the lamb I must say. 蔜he chili was good, the coleslaw was the way slaw should be made. 蔜he cup of custard was homemade tasting and delicious. �I've had breakfast here also and it was a good standard breakfast but no big deal. 蔉or breakfast I go to "The Pantry" a few miles down not here. They serve breakfast here until 10:30 but the worst thing I can say is that they, like so many other good restaurant choose to serve the shittest tasting brand of coffee lots of restaurant pick sometimes..."Apffel Coffee"!!! �Farmers Brothers is a close second for worst. Philippe's it a cash only restaurant too. 蔅ut there's an ATM if you need one.

What? 蔍 haven't written a review of Philippe's??? How did that happen? My PARENTS went here often before I was born a half century ago! The BEST in deli fare. Philippe's has been on "No Reservations" and has been shown on PBS's "California's Gold". Philippes is the birthplace of the french dip. The obvious...someone dropped the bun in the au jus and the patron said, "That's OK" and the best sandwich on the planet was born. Philippe, the man, was French, not Italian, so the name is pronounced "fill-eep", not "fill-ee-peh". I like the pork sandwich, dipped. The beef and turkey are also good. I don't like lamb. Plenty of horseradish mustard (their signature condiment) to dunk for each bite. The cole slaw and mac salads are legendary. The pickles and pickled eggs are tasty, but the.... CHEESECAKE! The cheesecake is to DIE for! Who knew? Also don't turn down the baked apples or the tapioca pudding...that stuff doesn't come from a box!

I took our toddler up to find a table while my husband braved the crowd. Boy, oh, boy, was it ever worth it. The bread was mouth-watering delicious thanks to a nice dip in Philippe's au jus. I had the beef while my husband had the lamb. The mustard was just the right amount of spice and sparkle. Our friend, who joined us for lunch, couldn't finish her sandwich, so my husband was only too happy to eat the rest of it.

I would actually give this place a negative rating if possible. Prices were descent. However, I couldn't even eat a 2nd bite of the horrible lamb sandwich I had ordered. Thought initially it was because I opted for the lamb instead of the beef; but no. I did take a bite of my friend's "famous beef" sandwich and seriously wasn't impressed either. Ended up eating the tasty, but little over priced dinner at the Nokia Theatre that night instead. I guess I consider myself too much of a foodie & was sadly disappointed with this establishment. I would much rather visit The Hat or Philly's Best for a tasty beef style sandwich. Don't waste your time or $ here- not worth it! How has this place stayed in business so long honestly?

I had always heard that this place to go before a Dodger game. So since me and GF got tickets to a game, we decided to hit it. It didn't hurt that we were going with a true blue Dodger couple. Then added in the fact that I had never been there before put some urgency on it. Getting there was a piece of cake since most of us knew the area. There is another parking lot across the street, besides the one behind the building. That was easy. Walking in, I was shocked on how big it was. The lines were pretty long too. This was about 11:00 am and the place was buzzing. Lot of old pics of the area and you could just feel the history. We decided to do our standard split. She ordered the pork and I, the beef. For our sides, I got the potato salad and she the macaroni salad. During the wait for the food I go and look for somewhere to sit. Turning the corner, there are more benches and booths. Nice. I found a booth way in the back. Don't let the area fool you, there is plenty of seating. On to the food. The beef was good, a little dry, but the pork was way better. The beef just didn't cut it. The potato salad blew me away. We both weren't very happy about the macaroni. Our friends said it's almost different every time. What?? The potato salad wasn't as good last time they went. The beef was better this time then last time....What?? Not good. Lack of consistency is the reason for the 3-stars. There was a full menu which we are happy to try, so a return is in the near future.

Love the double dipped French lamb dips with a slice of swiss cheese. So delicious and our family loves to take a drive to Los Angeles to enjoy their sandwhiches and desserts.

Anybody who disses Philippe's might need to be taken out back. Seriously. What the hell is wrong with you?? Philippe's is an oasis of old Los Angeles. Saw dust on the floor. 10 cent coffee (sure there are no refills, but you'll have to drink 15 cups before you 蔭re paying anywhere close to what other restaurants charge). Purple pickled eggs. French dipped deliciousness. Pies in all varieties. A candy counter with more names than the super market. Giant pickles. The most delicious of all mustards. All of this plus free parking and at a low low price of less than $10 per person. Where else in LA can you buy lunch for 6 for $53 including drinks, sides, and dessert? My favorite thing to do is order a french dipped turkey on swiss and a side of coleslaw. Then at my table I throw a bunch of coleslaw in the sandwich with a generous layer of Philippe's famous mustard. Tastes divine and clears your sinuses too! It's Monday night and I'm STILL dreaming of lunch on Saturday...

Initially, I was underwhelmed by the legendary French dip at Philippe's. 蔍've driven by the place a million times, been intrigued by the sign's claim, but didn't get around to going there until last Sunday. �My buddy Gary and I spent a few hours at LA's central library checking out all the artwork there. �You haven't lived until you've stared at the Dean Cornwell mural for an hour, humbled.) 蔄fterwards, I suggested we get a quick bite and Gary suggested Philippe's. 蔍 was like, "Cool!" and off we went. �I was surprised to find the place packed at 3pm on a Sunday. 蔠e parked easily (one spot left in the lot!) and inside we waited in line for about 10 minutes. 蔜he young lady who served us instructed us to put our money on a little floral plate. 蔛ince they make the sandwich right there in front of you, they don't touch the dirty money. 蔍 was again surprised to find that they pre-dip the sandwiches. 蔍 didn't know about that, but I went with it. 蔠hen in Rome and all that. �The sandwich was (another surprise) fairly small. 蔍 guess I'd gotten used to deli French dip sandwiches that have half a cow in them. 蔜his was like school cafeteria French dip (and the restaurant was only slightly better than a cafeteria). 蔄nd it was strangely comforting. 蔍 dug in and at first I thought, "It's okay." 蔜hen Gary said, "Try the mustard." 蔄h....that's the secret. 蔜he combo of the light au jus dip, the slightly fatty beef, and the hot mustard was just heaven. 蔜he sandwich was gone before I knew it. �Now, even though I liked the mustard, I have to take away a star for the sandwich's reliance on it. 蔜he French dip ought to be good on it's own. 蔄nother half star off for not being in control of my dippage. �Overall, a solid 3.5 stars.

I wasn't a HUGE fan of this place but I guess it's one of those places you have to visit when in LA. The beef dip...well, it was a beef dip. 蔆ole slaw was good. 蔅est part, the mustard that they put on the table. 蔠atch out now...this is some HOT mustard. 蔐iked it so much, I bought a jar while I was there.

Obviously, this 90+ year-old establishment seems to get nothing but love. 蔍 recently returned to this place after eleven years and got a slice of boysenberry pie and a beef sandwich. 蔍 wasn't filled one bit and the sandwich, though "juicy," was seriously lacking in flavor. 蔜he saving grace of the sandwich was the roll, which had the texture of a torta/cemita roll found on your average catering truck, and the dijon. 蔒eat and bread. 蔛uper, I suppose. 蔕ther than that, big friggn deal. �The atmosphere was nice and felt "historical" enough, but I like the food to speak for itself rather than being offered inflated conceptual baubles like that of "history" as a consolation prize. 蔍n fact, Philippe felt more like a concept than a restaurant. 蔍f you like history or to satisfy that part of you that basks in kitsch and theme parks, by all means, come here and blow your precious dollars away. 蔄s for me, I'll be at Arby's. 蔣es. 蔜hat's right. 蔄rby's.

Nothing can really be said about their French dips that hasn't already been said (fantastic) - but, this place does have more to it than that: surprisingly, Phillipe's has the best cream of broccoli soup I've ever come across (although I think it's only available on Saturdays). The soup is perfectly salty and creamy, and served with saltines. Mmmm it's good enough to make you head back to the counter and order some more to take home with you. Oh, also, the fact that you can get a cup of coffee and a piece of chocolate for, like, $0.19 at this place really cracks me up. Next time you're shoving quarters into a parking meter or a coin-op laundry machine, think of how much more you could be getting for your money at Phillipe's.

My parents have been talking about this place for years, about how they need to go back for a french dip. 蔍 had seen it on tv a few years back and have been wanting to try it myself. 蔠e packed up the car, the whole family on a Saturday and decided to go. 蔜his place gets packed on the weekends! 蔐uckily we found parking near by and got in the long line which was almost out the front door. I had been reading the reviews, so I already knew what I wanted to get ahead of time. 蔍 decided to go with the roast beef, double dipped with blue cheese and an order of potato salad. 蔜here are too many desert options though, I wanted one of everything. 蔍 finally decided on a baked apple, since they only have them for a limited time and a slice of berry pie. 蔐uckily I was able to talk everyone else into getting something different for me to sample. �Now I know why this place has been around for 100 years and will be around for another 100 more!

I think not being a native of Los Angeles lets me review Philippe's with more of an objective opinion. It has been so consumed by the legend that I don't think enough people can separate their emotional attachment from their dining experience. I ordered a beef sandwich. My tray looked nearly identical to the orders of the legions of people in the restaurant on a Sunday afternoon. You'll have to navigate through the throngs to find a line at the counter. Whenever you can, snag the attention of one of the people behind the counter to take your order. I have a feeling this system works much better on slow days. I figured that the beef sandwich would be a safe bet, although I had to fight long and hard to give up on the lamb one. Knowing that these sandwiches have maintained their popularity for so long with hardly a change gave me confidence. However, the sandwich was a soggy mess. I had no idea that the sandwiches are pre-dipped for you, a rather disgusting concept if you think about it. I resorted to picking it apart with a knife and fork. Anytime a sandwich pushes me to those extremes is going to be the last time I eat it. The beef was dry and the jus soaked bread dissolved without imparting any flavor. The saving grace was the restaurant's amazing hot mustard. If anything, I would just buy a jar and keep it for every sandwich that needs a kick. For the record, I have a jar of Plochman's Stone Ground mustard, which is just as good but without the heat. Also, Sierra Nevada makes a great mustard. I also enjoyed Philippe's potato salad. The dill pickles added sweetness and brine, plus the paprika gave it more spice. The coleslaw was also plain but up to par. If you're looking for cheap drinks, $.79 lemonade and iced tea are refreshing but filled with so much ice that you end up buying two anyway. What you get at Philippe's is nothing special. The sandwiches, at around $7 are even on the expensive side. But if consistency is what you crave, I'm not surprised that this restaurant is an LA institution.

My grandpa and my dad used to come here all the time when they came over to America. They loved it then and they still love it now. Philippe's is a LA landmark. This place is over a 100 years old and it still kicks ass. Come see for yourself! Good Lord. It doesn't matter what time it is cause the lines are always long. Trust me, it is worth the wait.

This place is an institution for a reason. 蔍ts busy for a reason. The french dip sandwich is a great part of any menu and we all owe it to this wonderful place. �Do yourself a favor and find time to eat at Philippe's. Philippe's is not exactly a lesson in fine dinning. �Its kind of a dive, there is sawdust on the floor, you will wait for your food. But if you appreciate lamb like I do, you will come back again and again when you try the Double Dipped Lamb Sandwich. If its your first time, get a lamb sandwich and one more of one of the other categories. �After you've come back several times because the food rocks you'll just end up getting 2 double dipped lamb sandwiches like me before a concert or dodger game or just whenever. 蔎ust you watch.

It's been said a million times, but Philippe's is a true LA institution. Everything about this place is classic, from the old-time phonebooth stalls, to the graffiti scratched into the bricks upstairs, right down to the sawdust beneath your feet! If you like your restaurants with character and history, you'll probably love Philippe's. Depending on where you're from, you may pronounce the name either the Spanish or French way. Anything goes here, although as someone who hails from a family of multiracial eastsiders who have been frequenting this place for several generations, I opt for "Felipe's." No matter how you say it, the French-dipped pork sandwiches are damn good! They'll melt in your mouth. If you like yours on the moist side, get it DOUBLE DIPPED. Stop whining about the prices, people. Prices are up everywhere, and the cheap lemonade and coffee prices more than make up for it! One last thing -- don't forget to tip your "waitress" a little somethin'. Many of these ladies have been working the counter for ages.

I always pass by this place whenever I go to Chinatown, and finally after seeing it featured on "Man vs. Food", I knew I had to go check it out and see what all the fuss was about. All in all, I think Philippe's really does live up to its name. The restaurant looked like a cafeteria of sorts, but it did have some old-fashioned charm, what with their vintage signs, phone booths, and straightforward menu selection. There is no wonder why this place has become an LA landmark! I was a bit apprehensive when I saw how long the lines were, but to my surprise we got to the front pretty quickly. The demographics of the diners was also really interesting; they ranged from tourists to LA hipsters to solo regulars. I ordered the boysenberry pie and lamb french dip sandwich, which were both very good. The boysenberry pie's crust was a little dry, but on the up side, it didn't have that overwhelming buttery taste to it. The pie was also packed with whole berries which tasted fresh. The sandwich was really good as well. I expected to get a soggy and salty sandwich, but the amount of au jus in the sandwich was perfect. Word of advice: BE CAREFUL WITH THE MUSTARD! I liberally slathered it on some of my sandwich, because, hey? How spicy could the mustard really be??? Well...the spiciness of the mustard didn't have me guzzling down my lemonade but the moment I bit into it, it shot straight up to my sinuses. The spiciness was so overwhelming that I would subconsciously close my eyes from the sensation! I don't know if that makes any sense...but just try a little of their mustard on the side before adding it to your sandwich!

We went this Saturday before heading to the Dodger game to grab some sandwiches. The lines were super long, but we managed to wait it out. We were almost up when this worker comes to us and asked us to go to the back room so we can place our order. Well he actually took us to the kitchen. I was soo stoked we saw all the workers in the back preparing the stuff and others doing the dishes. I really would have loved it they would have let us make our own sandwiches. At the end we got our order 3 beef sandwiches and 1 cheese, ohh and we also got a Philippe's paper hat that the employee gave us. The potato salad looked very good, but we wanted something we could eat fast and mess free on the way to the game. The sandwiches were really, really good. The bread is good itself and even though I tried not to make a mess in the car I managed to do it anyways since the bread was flaky and every time I took a bite of it some flakes would come down. They have like 5 different types of sandwiches and all can be dipped and they also have a breakfast small menu. I love that they have lemonade for 75 cents and iced tea for 65. They also have chili and coleslaw if you like that. I really enjoyed coming here and next time I hope to be able to sit and eat and order some of the potato salad they had.

Despite it's long lines it's always a good choice whenever I'm in the downtown area. You can't go wrong with any of their sandwiches and I highly recommend getting it double dipped - it makes it that much juicier! Don't forget to layer it with their famous spicy mustard which has a habit of clearing ones sinuses. 蔖air the sandwich with a side (I like their potato salad) and a refreshing lemonade and you got yourself an ultimate combo. If I can ever get down there early enough, I must try their breakfast menu one of these days. I've seen pictures of their biscuits and they look amazing...

So I vaguely remembered reading a post on where to go for lunch during jury duty. 蔒y wife had recommended Panda Express, however I opted for Phillipe's. 蔍t's one of those spots that's kinda tough to get to, so I thought I'd be all smart and take advantage. 蔄sk the bailiff ahead of time how I get there, figure out I can get there taking the DASH (for a quarter!) Get there, order my stuff, and well... it was a soggy sandwich. 蔍 even tried dipping it in some of their mustard sauce... just wasn't it. 蔛adly take the DASH back wishing I had gotten the 2 item combo of Orange Chicken and Mandarin Chicken with 1/2 chow mein and 1/2 fried rice... Line wasn't too bad when I went in. 蔠aited all of about 45 seconds... That was a plus... had been expecting to wait like 15 minutes to get my food... and the fact that it helped to kill my 1.5 hour lunch break during jury duty day... that's where the 2 stars are from...

Pros: - At least i know some of the stuff is fresh. They cut the lamb pieces in front of us. - The pies look soooo good - The potato salad was very good - There's LOTS of parking. I think I saw two lots, on across the street and on behind the restaurant. Cons: - It's way overpriced. I had a scoop of potato salad and a lamb sandwich for about $9. For the price, it wasn't worth it. - The sandwich was too salty, the mustard too strong. If you're going to put mustard in, just use a little. - I think it's been around for a while but the place itself is really dark and seems dirty. All the paper stuff 蕎hich littered the floor (the bf thinks it's to absorb spills and whatnot) looked really gross. - At first, I thought the lemonade and iced tea was really cheap, i mean it's only $0.75 for a cup but then I saw someone else order it and it's not worth the .75 for a cup THAT small. - Seating is sooo cramped... I would rather go to subway.

It's 2009, and a cup of coffee at Philippe is prices at 9 cents- yes, 9 cents! OK, so I am rating it 4 stars not because Philippe has cheap coffee - it's really because it is just an old fashion cafeteria that serves the ORIGINAL, mouthwatering French Dip! This IS the place the delicious French Dip originated! While I totally respect personal opinions, I just cannot believe that Philippe would deserve anything less than 3 stars- a few fellow yelpers have rated them 1 or 2 stars?! 蔖hilippe really serves one of the best French Dips ever existed. After all, it has been around for over 100 years, and I am sure there is a good reason it has remained so popular for a century! If you like French Dip sandwiches, you've got to give Philippe a try - tell the server to make you a beef sandwich- double dipped, then ask for a side of potato salad, a glass of lemonade, and finish your order with a slice of apple pie - trust me, your dinning experience at Philippe will be a blissful one!

I've been here twice, once for lunch and once for breakfast. The double dip beef sandwich was pretty double darn good and their french toast is amazing! The hot mustard is also awesome, especially with the sandwich; the mustard will make your nostrils explode and your eyes will glossify. I wasn't too impressed by the sides, although the cole slaw went well with everything else. Both times I went weren't so crowded, but I heard it gets crazy in there.

I almost never eat alone at dining establishments but after watching an episode of Man vs. Food LA about Philippe the day before, I couldn't resist stopping at Philippe while driving through Chinatown on the way home. The last time I went to Philippe, it was probably about 7 years ago. I don't think anything has changed at all here in the 7 years. Heck, nothing probably has changed here in the 100 years or so it has been open. I ordered the beef dipped sandwich, a bowl of chili, and a cup of the 75c lemonade to wash down all the food. You would be hard pressed to find a french dipped sandwich anywhere which taste better. The chili was very ordinary and of course you can't expect too much out of lemonade that cost 75c. 蔇on't forget to try the spicy mustard if you like mustard. 蔍 really enjoyed that with my dip. It won't take 7 years for me to visit this place again, that's for sure. 4.5 stars if I could give half stars but for now, I will leave it at 4.

This place is amazing! I love mom & pop shops and this is living history! This is my first visit to this historical la landmark. I had to go downtown early in the morning and was looking for a place that served breakfast. Thanks to yelp and Marc d's review, I found this place. As many have known and have written, the atmoshpere is a time capsule from the 1920's - flat tables to sit multiple customers, booths, candy stand, walk up service, and many locals eNkoyingveach others company. There are many reviews on the wall that describes their history. I had the beef French dip and a glass of lemonade for breakfast !! The bread was soft, the beef very tender and the au juice a little salty - just the way I like it. As many know, the lemonade is fresh squeezed and real! I will be back to try the other menue items Thanks yelpers for this execellent find!! Oh yeah - cash only A 9 minute walk from Union Station and there is about ten - fifteen spaces in the back for parking.

I am NEVER disappointed coming here. 蔍 always get the beef with swiss cheese double dipped with a side of coleslaw and a lemonade. 蔜heir beef is soo tender and the sandwhiches are so juicy. After eating just half a sandwhich I'm pretty full, but I just can't help myself.. I end up eating the whole thing. The coleslaw is probably the best coleslaw I've ever had. 蔍m not usually a big fan of coleslaw either. 蔍'll only eat it here and KFC (hahah).

The food and ambiance here are reasons enough to brave the crappy location and possible assault by some super aggressive panhandlers. I love the Dip... and the pickles that come with it. I've been to Philippe's a few times now and always like the service (even with the waits in line), prices, and food. Just about the best thing you can say of a long term institution. As for the atmosphere, it's a bunch of long tables where you sit with other people that you have never met before and chow down. There's memorabilia on the walls and it really reminds you that despite LA's rep for having no soul... well there are still a few vestiges left.

Have lived in LA my entire life (a long enough time to not want to admit it) and have had Philippe's on my tongue and never been. So finally decided to just do it and cross it off my bucket list of eating places. Did not disappoint. The place is GREAT and worth the drive and a little bit of a line. First off, there is going to be a line weaving in between the tables. DO NOT let it bother you. The folks at the counter work through it quicker than you can actually figure out what you are going to eat.... although, there really shouldn't be any question. By the way, prices are GREAT, 3 of us ate a sandwich each, with sides and drinks ----- $27 ..... wow. OK, the skinny on the food: Beef Dip ----- starts here and really ends here. Sandwich was fantastic, meat was as tasty as I have ever had. Au jus was perfect complement as the bread was dipped. There is enough meat on this to handle a reasonable appetite. I did notice a few people sitting around that had more meat (probably did a double meat option or something). Great sandwich, worth the drive into downtown. Would absolutely positively get again. Pork Dip ---- OK, this was good, but no where near the Beef Dip. So, if you go there for the Beef Dip, stick with it.... that one is the best. Mustard Sauce --- I did try a little. I like Mustard, but this one is really more horseradish sauce with a little mustard worked in. For me did not add to the sandwich... just stick with the juice it is dipped in. You need nothing further. Macaroni Salad -- was OK, but nothing special. I love mac salad and this one didn't thrill me. There was a little too much "tangy" to it, probably a little vinegar or what not. Could use a little more plain ol mayo. Not bad, but not to die for. Potato Salad -- same thing, it was good, not great. Although, if I didn't know better, I would swear this was a combination of Cole Slaw and Potato Salad. Unless when they scooped mine, they used the same scooper, but it had the hint of cabbage and carrot and a similar tangy taste. Chili --- you can have it straight or with beans.... from the looks of it, the with beans means they add some beans to the bottom of the cup and throw the straight chili on top -- did not look like a separate batch, didn't find the beans until last few bites. Anyway, the chili is good, like the other sides, not great. Probably my favorite of the 3 sides we tried. Pies --- we didn't have any, but based on the fact that they were all around us and everyone seemed to have a smile and very little left on their plates, I assume the pies are tasty. They looked good. Summary --- absolute must stop in your life to see where the Beef Dip sandwich originated. Worth the effort. Don't mess around, stick with the Beef Dip and enjoy it as it was meant to be. Great sandwich.

Yes, the lines are kind of disorganized and long, but just keep pushing forward (With your cash! Remember it's cash only...) and you'll be amazed at how deceiving the "wait" is. �Within 10 minutes you'll have any of their awesome dipped sandwiches (Suggestion: order it double dipped and with some sort of cheese to make it even more scrumptious. And when you find your table, douse it with some of their hot mustard. Mmmm.), a side that costs barely more than a dollar, a drink for under a dollar, and if you're smart, one of their pie slices that rivals House of Pies. No, you won't be able to finish all of that, but yeah, it's tooootally worth taking home the rest. 蔄nd ordering more to go.

If Phillipe's has even a guy like me (who's usually not crazy about grungy, divey places) wanting to come back, it must be good. I'll even brave it after the health department shutdown. Not only is the food good, the menu is unique. You might be able to find a french-dipped sandwich with blue cheese and hot mustard somewhere else. But a good one? And then there are all those old-school desserts like tapioca pudding and custard and blueberry pie. I'm a fan of the ambience too. It's quaint and old-fashioned, but not in a theme-park way, more like a "this is how it's always been" way. In a city full of trendiness, sometimes you need that.

My boyfriend and I went on vacation to So Cal and we just HAD TO GO! The restaurant was featured on Man vs Food and we can just taste the food through the TV. "A French Dip that didn't need the Au Jus sauce on the side for dipping?? - Whaa No Way!" When we get there we notice the two parking lots and a bunch of ppl inside, so this has to be a great place?! Right?? .... First, who doesn't take Debit/Credit Cards anymore?? okay - that was annoying, but for good really good food, fine. Then... no Menus? Just one Large Menu to the right, that if you're in the Far Left line is hard to see. There's other posters blocking a few sections, me and this other lady in line were straining to see what was on the dessert menu. BUT - again, ppl who come here may already know what they want, so another sign, this might be fantastic dining. (there were random signs behind the counter that showed of some of the items: The different French Dips and the Lemonade/Ice Tea) okay to the food... I got the Beef French Dip, the waitress suggested it. Took my first bite and was hoping for food bliss.... but got a sandwich that was so bland! I had to add salt n pepper, and that didn't seem to help. I was hungry (so the food should have been extra delish) but it felt like after the first half I was forcing myself to eat it. I wanted to ask for some au jus on the side, but didn't want to be rude. I already felt bad adding salt n pepper. �My boyfriend got the same but double dipped... his was much better. But again not the mouth watering better than any other place, better. just better than mine - which was not hard to beat. I liked the potato salad. The tea and the lemonade were good, but no refills. Oh and my bag of chips were fantabulous. lol In the end, I took the rest of my food to go and gave it a nice homeless guy outside.WHO THREW IT BACK AT ME after the first bite! HAHAHA jk.... I made his day so I guess it wasn't a total fail. :) Worst $20+ bucks spent all weekend. I'm sorry to be so harsh, I think if we weren't SOO Excited and it being so built up, my review would be a bit different. I'm happy to read most have a good experience here.

The BF and I came here with some friends to see what the actual fuss is about this place. We saw Food Network and Travel Channels' Man Vs. Food visit this place and just had to try it. So when we walked in, we saw a sea of people standing in line. The lines are usually longer than the actual space that is provided for people to stand in, so you would have to stand off to the edge and work your way to the middle lines which is usually shorter. They specialize in french deep sandwich which range from roast beef, turkey, and lamb. They have tons of sides and extras. The food here is really cheap and well worth the short wait. You order everything up front and get your food right away. The BF and I got a beef with swiss and a lamb with swiss. I ordered the beef barley soup and macaroni salad. We topped it off with 75 CENTS lemonade. The rolls are dipped in au jus which is just soo yummy and makes all the difference in the sandwich. You can request double dipped if you like it extra wet. The beef is cut super thin whereas the lamb was chunky. You can add any type of cheese they have, but we just preferred swiss. They have a house mustard which is similar to wasabi, use with caution. I personally like the mustard with the lamb. It offset the gaminess you normally get with lamb. The macaroni salad was more tart from the pickles they add in so it cuts down on the creaminess and heaviness from traditional macaroni salads. The beef barley soup was very homey. The used beef broth and its full of veggies.

It's not awful, it's just not tasty and service is slow. The place is definitely overrated. Service is slow but attentive, just know what you want before you get to the counter so you don't hold up the 8-10 different queues at the counter. I waited maybe 10 minutes around a 12:45 lunch time with 3 people ahead of me. The portion size of sandwiches are small, so you might see people ordering two. I stuck with one pork sandwich with Swiss, a macaroni salad, and iced tea ($9). There's nothing special or amazing about the food and drink. You could, seemingly, get this kind of food & drink anywhere else and it'd have more flavor and filling satisfaction. The mac salad was a bit sour but somehow I managed to finish it -- I was hoping that with each bite it'd get better. But it didn't. Put a light amount of their spicy mustard (at the tables) on your sandwich to give it a nice kick. It closely resembles a Dijon. Use it sparingly though or you may end up with an intense kick -- the equivolent of 蔵nhaling potent wasabi. It hits the back of your head and makes you stop chewing for a moment. But perhaps it's the environment or history of the place that draws everyone -- sawdust floors, long communal tables, and a diverse crowd of hungry souls from all walks of life. It has some kind of novelty to it, but that quickly dies after trying their food. I could come back again if I was in the area but I pobaby wouldnt. I'd rather spend my time trying a new restaurant. �Overall, the service is slow and the food isnt particularly memorable (not something i'd miss nor crave).

This place is a legend in LA. 蔄nd like many establishments that have been around for generations, I hypothesize that the reputation is not built on quality, but rather on nostalgia. �I think its true here as well. �I went there for the first time and found good sandwiches, not great, served cafeteria style. 蔠e got the beef sandwich, which is the classic. - get it double dipped though, one dip left us with a dry sandwich. 蔄nd use the mustard, its hot, but it is the only thing that adds flavor to what is otherwise a pretty boring dish. The prices were reasonable and the food was decent. 蔍 highly recommend the chili. 蔍MO, it was better than the sandwich the place is know for. Would I take out of towners here?

I first tried this place before I went to a Dodger game with my friends. It's famous for their french dipped sandwhiches and they are pretty good. The first time I went it was packed, perhaps because it was a weekend and a dodger game day. The line wait was about 15 minutes that time. The second time I went on a weekday in between lunch and dinner time and it wasn't crowded then. Didn't have to wait long in line. I had the beef dipped sandwich which was pretty good. I wasn't crazy about the macaroni salad, ok to try, don't think I would order that again. I wouldn't go out of my way to eat here, but if you're in the area it's still worth a try.

In Yelp-ese 4 stars is yeah I am a fan and 5 stars is Woohoo! As good as it gets! Well guess what, Philippe is Woohoo! As good as it gets! for Los Angeles classic restaurants. The sawdust on the floors, coffee for a dime, this is the LA that Raymond Chandler knew and where Philip Marlowe dined. I am a sucker for the lamb, double dipped of course, with cole slaw and pickles (as sides, not on the sandwich). I'd rather eat here before the LA Opera than Patina. When I show up in my tux on a Friday night with the DW in tow, everybody always says "enjoy the show" and we are not the only opera patrons in there. It is even better when the Dodger fans are there too and I can get someone to agree to text me the score inning by inning. And despite being a 'joint', they have a surprisingly good wine selection, by the glass.

The Best and the Original French Dip Sandwich. 蔍f you complain about this place, then it's obvious you're not appreciating the fact that they invented the French Dip sandwich; a sandwich that is now on countless menus across the US and has been made millions of times-- these guys came up with it over 100 years ago. �Whatever sandwich you get, make sure it's double dipped for extra yummy-ness! The baked apples are fantastic too-- but only available October through May. 蔜he coleslaw, potato salad and macaroni salad are all great as well. 蔜he dutch apple pie is also a winner, especially if you go in the summer when the baked apples aren't being served. Cash only and there is an ATM there if you need it. 蔜here are multiple lines folks, so no need to stand on the stairs and go in the first line, try another and make room for people to use the stairs.

If you enjoy the French Dip sandwich, you definitely need to make a visit out to the mecca of French Dips... Phillipe. 蔍t's the birthplace of the french dip and has been featured on various food TV shows. The girlfriend introduced me to this place, and I cannot say enough about it. �The food is great. 蔍've had the beef and pork sandwiches, and they are delicious and pretty filling (I'm done after one sandwich and a side). 蔄sk them to double dip it so you get more of the au jus. 蔜he sides are pretty savory as well-- the macaroni salad is great, the potato salad is decent. 蔠hen they have tomato bisques DEFINITELY don't miss out on that one... its texture is perfect and is full of flavor. I've had the blueberry pie, and if you like pie, this place isn't too shabby. 蔵ce tea and lemonade come in a small glass and are not re-fillable, but they are inexpensive and very refreshing especially on a hot summer day. 蔜he coffee is pretty watered down, but they go for 9� so it's worth a shot. The place is decorated in a very retro style. 蔜he servers are very friendly. 蔇on't be weirded out if they don't take your money though. A runner comes up and collects all of the money from behind the counter to take the money. It keeps the servers' hands clean. Oh yeah. The most important part. 蔜he hot mustard. 蔍t's a must have! 蔍f you're not good with spicy stuff, take in moderation. 蔅ut don't miss out on it. I use like a huge squirt of with each bite of my sandwich. Simply amazing stuff! 蔍t has a wasabi-esque kick, but really compliments the sandwich. 蔍f you really like it, you can also buy freshly packaged ones at the counter. 蔒y mom uses it at home as a dip for tortilla chips. 蔜hat's how amazingly great it is.

This place is a Los Angeles classic. Old-fashioned lunch counter serving sandwiches, deli sides, soups and stews, beer, sodas, etc. It is a very easy place to get to, just blocks from Union Station and the various public transit options there. For this visit I arrived on the Red Line after coming from Long Beach. Bring cash, though, because there are no credit cards accepted. It doesn't bug me that much, but rather it adds to the charm. If you come here and you don't get a French dipped sandwich, you'll get some good food, but you're missing out. I have been here more times than I can count and I usually get the lamb, double dipped with a side of cole slaw and a pickle. Don't get cheese, it's only a distraction from the sandwich. All it needs is plenty of jus and a tiny bit of Phillipe's famous ultra spicy mustard. Other standout menu items include their cole slaw (get it dry unless you want it swimming in dressing), the pickles, the beef stew and the chili. Also of note is the $.75 lemonade and the $.60 iced tea. Don't forget $.09 coffee either! Delicious! If you have room after your meal go back and grab a slice of pie or better yet, a small cup of tapioca pudding. The best I've ever had. At certain times of the year they also have baked apples, with cinnamon and sugar. Sure you can get your food to go, but the best experience is to eat with strangers at the long communal tables. I've met city council members, Dodgers players and celebrities all sitting down for a fantastic sandwich. They're not special here. They're just plain folks and that's what I like about Phillipe's.

I was in downtown LA already that day to see the Art in the Streets exhibit at the MOCA...since I had never been to Phlippes before, my boyfriend and his parents decided to take me. I ordered a beef sandwich and my boyfriend ordered lamb. Mine was okay, but to be honest, it was a bit bland. The first bites were good, then after that I wanted something else. It's very simple. Meat. Bread. Cheese. I tried some of the lamb, and it was okay, too. It wasn't a horrible sandwich, just lacking some flavor. They also have this spicy mustard you can put on, but it was like...horseradish/big kick kinda thing. Reminded me of wasabi. We also had the banana cream pie. I thought the filling was great, but I wasn't a big fan of the whipped cream. It was really oily and not very creamy. It's not bad, but I don't really get the hype.

An old school LA institution! Walking into Philippe's is like walking back into the 50's Long lines, even at 9:30pm on a Thursday! Cash only! 2 sandwiches, 1 pork, which I ordered, and one beef.

My co-worker told me that if I like french dipped sandwiches Philippe's was the place for me. The style of the place is you order the food and tables are on a first come first serve basis. The vibe is very casual, sports bar type of place. I ordered the LAMB DIP, the pieces of lamb just came falling out of the sandwich. I would have to say that for a sandwich it was amazing. Besides that I felt that it was absolutely necessary to try those PICKLED EGGS. The marinate it in vinegar and beet juice. If you can get past the purple color of egg you can do it. The texture was a bit dry but it was the most interesting egg I have ever had. If you like pickles and you like eggs. Try it! This is a good place to go for lunch or even with a co-worker after work! ENJOY!

Not impressed. A friend brought me and my girlfriend here after mentioning french dips, which my girlfriend loves. Line situation was chaos, workers didn't speak english. We each got the beef dip with cheese, bag of chips, she got the lemon meringue pie and I got some cantaloupe. The sandwich was meh. Soggy bread isn't my thing, and the beef was chewy. I couldn't even finish it, even though I was starving. The gf said her pie was strange and that the meringue had a strange texture. I was thirsty since my tiny glass of lemonade was no refills. We left hungry, unsatisfied and about $25 poorer for a crappy meal.

Despite all the hype around this place, I didn't really have expectations. Usually, when I hype up a place in my head, I get disappointed easily. So in this case, I was expecting a so-so sandwich. With that being said, I totally underestimated this place! They don't try to do too much with their food - they just make simple sandwiches with high quality ingredients - and the quality of the ingredients really do make a difference. My friends and I all shared the pork, beef, and lamb sandwiches. Tip: get your sandwiched double-dipped! My beef sandwich was delicious, but the pork and lamb were amazing! I also had their potato salad which was really good and I tried some of my friend's chicken tortilla soup which was good, as well. I planned on having just a bite of my friend's coffee cake and I ended up almost eating it all! It's true, the lines are long, but they're long for a reason! It's all worth it, promise!

My boyfriend and I came in at dinner time for lamb and beef dip sandwiches, and were very pleased with the lamb particularly! Delicious!! The woman who helped us behind the counter was a sweetheart, and despite how busy it was, was happy to take the time to answer our questions about soups, pricing, options, etc. While we were eating, we actually ended up having a problem and I called the manager after we left to avoid awkward, public confrontation. The reason I'm giving a good review now is because she (Gloria) handled it SO well and was amazing with her customer service. So many places these days don't take the time to adequately address a customer complaint, but I was so impressed with how she listened, cared, apologized, and took action to correct the problem. She is amazing and completely redefines my previously-held impressions of restaurant managers! We will definitely be coming back!

We have made the hour long drive to LA just for Philippe's. Its one of the last places on earth that only takes cash, but that just adds to the atmosphere. They did actually install an ATM, so you can get cash for what I'm sure is a ridiculous fee. Spicy mustard is an absolute must and the coleslaw is good as well. If you time it right, the lines wont be out the door, but good luck with that. Trust me, it is worth the wait.

I came here expecting a lot, probably due to all the hype that this place gets on the food channels and shows. Sadly, I have come to the conclusion that this place is overrated and I found the experience underwhelming. I know these sandwiches are predipped, but when I was eating them, they felt more like a soggy mess than a declicious french dip. I came as the end of lunch hour ended, so the lines of people werent too bad. One thing that I do recommend you to try are their sides - they are unexpectedly better than I expected.

Philippes is GREAT! It is an old school way of ordering. Stand in line (more then one line) and just follow the ladies in front, they will serve you. However, it is always somewhat busy, so during that time know what you want to order, makes the ladies in front lives a lot easier... they get a bit hectic. My bf and I go here to get a simple, but delicious sandwich. We love ordering the Beef Sandwich single dipped (where the beef is dipped in a stock/ broth) and it is in a nice hoagie bread. Definitely recommend their lemonade it is only 65 cents and it is refreshing to drink with the sandwich. We got their potato salad and macaroni salad and it was good. So, when you sit down their is going to be a squirt bottle of their famous hot mustard sauce. It is so good with the sandwich, but caution too much will be like wasabi in your nose, it will definitely clear your nasal pathway. So, don't be generous on the mustard just a little dab will GO a LONG WAY and when your done wash it down with lemonade, and it is sooo good. We go back to eat their beef sandwich because it is so tender and it doesn't have the "nasty beef" taste some places have. Also, they have like "purple" eggs in a jar at the front when you order... kinda gross but maybe I will try one day... Also, they have banana creme pie and I haven't tried so maybe the next time I go. Their menus are simple and if you can't see the menu will be on your right side. Oh yeah... its CASH ONLY TOO!

Parking wasn't too bad but the lot in the back was pretty much full when we arrived. We got lucky and found a spot though, otherwise we would have had to try to find street parking which would have been a hassle. The line wasn't too long at all (we went at 8pm on a Sat night though); there's about 6-7 lines going on at the same time, so it moves fast. We ordered: - 5 orders of beef sandwich, double dipped: this was really good, but tasted a little dry. The bread is essentially lightly dipped on the inside in the au jus, but it's not more than maybe a quarter inch thick of wetness so the majority of the bread is dry. Next time I go, I want to try it wet and see if that's better .. I'm hoping it's not going to be a sopping wet sandwich, though. - 1 order lamb sandwich, double dipped - this was good for the first 5-6 bites, and then the gaminess started to get to me. Next time, I'd order the beef. - 1 order potato salad - fist-sized amount for $1.15; not a huge potato salad fan - 1 order mac salad - I like the mac salad at Hawaiian bbq places better :P - 3 orders of the soup of the day (Beef Barley) - this was nice and hot which was great in the superrr-airconditioned venue, but it was pretty standard tastewise. My only qualm is I wish it were a little cheaper. For the portion size, I think $6.75 (for the lamb) and $5.75 (for all the other ones) is a bit high. That's the cost of a Subway footlong! (I know, I know, is it sacrilegious to even think of putting the two together?) Granted, this isn't really comparable, taste-wise, to a Subway sandwich, but it gives you an idea of the size: it was like paying $5.75 for a six-inch sandwich.

I think most people rate this place high just because the place is famous. 蔜he reality? - Over-rated beef sandwich that's fairly tasteless - No fries, serves coke in the can - The 75cents lemonade is tiny with lots of ice - Crowded - Cash only Heard a lot about this place and finally gave it a try. 蔙eally not worth the drive. 蔒ost beef dips in fast food restaurants have more flavor, cost less, and comes with fries. 蔇on't fall for the hype

I love Philippe's. I didn't know what to expect when I got there except to say I'd heard they were the "original" french dip restaurant. I prefer them to Cole's any day. Firstly, don't expect a restaurant - this is a very old cafeteria style place with sawdust on the floor and long tables with stools which you share with other diners. The lines are long at rush hours - to be expected, as it's very popular. Your order is made while you wait at the counter - so be prepared to stand in line! If you like your au jus sandwiches very juicy - ask for double dip. I think the turkey and steak dip are the best sandwiches. Their bread is pretty average but they slice their meat thinly and their au jus is absolutely delicious. When the bread soaks up all that goodness it's heavenly. Their mustard is super hot and clears out your nostrils like the strongest wasabi, so beware! They have a few choices of cheese, personally I don't think the sandwiches need it. Their sides are very good - basic, but tasty - potato salad, slaw etc. They have a great selection of pies too. Oh and their chili is great - comes with or without kidney beans and all the fixin's! This is the BEST place for French dipped sandwiches. Forget Coles. But this is the kind of place you come to for lunch on a Saturday or for a grab-n-go sandwich in the evening. It's not fine dining but it's a great experience.

Ok, this will be quick and easy. If you are looking for a quick order and go, this is NOT the place. The lines are LOOOONG, particularly in the lunch rush but the prices cannot be beat for the food. I have been here twice, both times I have the Pork Sandwich and Potato Salad, with the only difference being I added the lemonade the last time (69 cents!!!). Delicious!! But don't' expect fast food. The line will take you about 20 mins or so to get through, then you have to find seating or take it to go. It's worth it though.

I tried this place after a friend of mine recommended me. It's crowded on weekends so we had to find parking off the street. The place itself is full of memorabilia, train stuff, and old photos of LA. Food wise, it's pretty original and not bad at all for French dip sandwich although I have had better. For the price and the unique experience of this place, it's worth to try.

This place has long lines which I absolutely hate. The food was nothing special but it was good, although I wished I would've asked for more gravy in my french dip. The horseradish sauce was good, but it didn't really fit well with the sandwich. In my opinion, the only thing the horseradish sauce can successfully compliment is dim sum. This place is great for a lunch meal, and serves as a great alternative to fast food joints so I give it 4 stars.

I noticed that Philippe's has over 100 reviews, while Cole's only had around 3!!! Just thought people should know an interesting story exists here, and to try for themselves who the original really is....and if it matters. Check out this story run in the Village Voice some years back... http://www.villagevoice.�Gives some good information on both Philippe's and Cole's... I'm going to leave my personal feelings for Cole's vs. Philippe's out of this...You know what to order here...it's as good as people say. But I thought more people should know about Cole's....it's a great story.

For anyone who complains that L.A. has no history, take them to lunch here!!! �The food is great. 蔔othing like a meaty sandwich soaked in au jus. 蔅e sure to put a little (seriously.....just a little!) spicy mustard on your sandwich. 蔣ou can find little jars of it on all the seats, which are community style---a really nice throwback from a time when people used to really rub elbows (sometimes literally) in public. 蔄nother nice throwback are the gals behind the counter who all wear these timewarp waitress outfits that make you feel like you're back in the 1920's. �Seriously, half the appeal for me is history. 蔔ot only is this one of the oldest restaurants in L.A. it's in a great location to give someone a history lesson about this great city. 蔙ight across the street is Union Station, the last great American train station ever built. 蔍t is one of the best examples of Art Deco in the country and should not be missed. 蔔ext to that is another Deco masterpiece, the US Post Office. 蔛adly, the PO can only be viewed from the outside as visitors are not allowed in. 蔔ow, once inside Philippe, be sure to head towards the restrooms and check out their train memorabilia, which includes maps of L.A.'s long gone transit network, the Pacific Electric Railway, which at one time was the nation's most extensive urban rail network. �One last thing....be sure to finish it all off with a slice of pie! 蔔othing quells the burn of that hot mustard like some banana cream!!!

This place reminds me of Bakeman's in Seattle for a number of reasons: http://www.yelp.com/biz/�1) The food isn't really all that good, yet seems to get a pass because it's old 2) It has the same cafeteria type feel with large crowds 3) They both sell stale berry pies for dessert I admit, I go there somewhat often but more because I keep hoping that if I eat another dipped beef sandwich, I'll somehow understand what the big deal is about. That said, if you want a nice dipped beef sandwich....well, my recommendation is Chicago. http://www.yelp.com/biz/�...that is, until I find the right place here in LA.

Thank goodness for Fat Tire Ale on draught--and a pint only set me back $5. 蔜he alcohol gave me the strength to just say no to beef.

Pros: CHEAP, Lamb, Beer, Nostalgia, A Classic and Original L.A. location, YUMMY! Cons: Cash Only, LONG LINES, Occasionally overcrowded, NO AIR CONDITIONING- In the summer this is really a deal breaker. I go to Phippe's maybe twice a year because I get a deep rooted craving for their Lamb dip. This makes the wait okay. As soon as you walk in, you'll notice sawdust on the floor, and if you arrive anytime that isn't a lull, you may not be able to open the door...the line gets ridiculous. They've got 6-8? cashiers taking orders and prepping cafeteria trays. The seating is first come first serve, and you sometimes have to share a table. This is a MUST for any L.A. visitor, as it is within skipping distance from Union Station and China Town. Just make sure you don't go with anyone impatient.

I know L.A. everyone is a dick, especially on the roads. But not at Phillipe's. It was my first time getting a pastrami sandwich here, (I was blown away), and I found myself indecisively staring and glaring at the menu's large variety of meats and food. Then all of a sudden, with a horribly nice tone a woman and her husband turn to me and go, "grab anything but make sure it's double-dipped. Out of nowhere another man giggles his way into the conversation and starts to giving me more pointers about how to order and the 'anatomy' of the store. We all talked to each other and ...just it's amazing how friendly the atmosphere there is, regardless of the fact that it was in L.A. of all places and there was probably 200-280 people there. Another fantastic thing was... well the food. Their pastrami sandwich isn't the largest of sandwiches, but that's all made up by the balancing of meat to bread to sauce texture and synchronization. It's definately a great place to go to with a group and watch the game.

Food: 蔊ood Service: Cafeteria Style Ambiance: Old School Portions: Just right Facility Type: Deli Cuisine: French-Dips, American Breakfast Price: Cheap Parking: Street parking or in back lot. Best For: Lunch What I have tried: Sandwiches- Beef Dip ($5.55): Good. 蔍 get mine double-dipped, but since I am a slow eater, my sandwich gets soggy by the time I start on the second half of the sandwich. Sides- Coleslaw ($1.10): Average Potato Salad ($1.10): Average Macaroni Salad ($1.10): Average Desserts- Tapioca ($2.15): Excellent The sandwiches are good, but I personally prefer the French Dips at Cole's. 蔛andwiches here are dipped for you whereas at Cole's, you dip as you eat. 蔄lso, I like pastrami dips more than beef dips and Philippe's doesn't offer pastrami. 蔍 think this is more of a personal preference in style and menu offerings than taste because both places have tasty food. 蔋owever, I like Cole's side orders more than Philippe's.

I went here for the first time this week and was thoroughly disappointed. Perhaps it was because I was expecting it to be phenomenal based on the other reviews; however, the food was not good. The meat quality was terrible and the bread was extremely dry, even with the au jus dip. Even given the price, I was disappointed. I would much rather prefer going to Houston's or other restaurants for a French dip sandwich. I would not go back to this restaurant again.

This restaurant is a landmark of Los Angeles. 蔒y dad has been taking my family here since my sisters and I were all born. 蔍 know that nostalgia plays a huge role in our taste buds--- but that's what dining is all about, right?? Upon ordering, you can choose anything and everything. 蔜he sides include a delicious cole slaw (slightly creamy/sweet), potato salad, beef stew, poo poo chili (I always made fun of my sister ordering it, hence MY name for it), and more. 蔜he french dip sandwiches to choose from are: lamb, pork, beef, turkey, ham.. single or double dipped in Au Jus, and many tasty cheeses to choose from. 蔜he stack of meat served in the sandwich has decreased substantially, hence the 4 stars... They still have a delicious sandwich and flavorful and original tasting sides. It sits right across from Union Station in Chinatown. 蔜here is sawdust on the floor and the 'decor' is authentically 'old school LA'... though you can hardly call it 'decor' when it's been there since 1908 ;) http://www.phillipes.com . 蔠e always take our out of town guests here for their "Phillipes" experience...again, nostalgic. It can be crowded, especially after USC/UCLA/Dodger games. 蔜he clerks are efficient, and gladly receive tips for being so. 蔍 think it's worth the wait of 20-35 minutes---though I have a 3 year old and unless we go with our extended family, it's hard to wait for the hubby to get the food while I 'hang out' with the little one--waiting for a taste of Phillipes...

I don't realize it, but I'm a pretty big french dip whore...it always makes my top three choices when choosing from a new menu. 蔛o I was pretty stoked that we were going to an establishment in LA that is known THE establishment for French Dip. The minute I walked in, this place reminded me of Katz's Deli in NYC - I love Katz's and always make a point to go there when visiting my brother in NY, who coincidentally was visiting for the holidays. I won't go into the details of how this place is set-up because there are plenty of reviews that do this. Here's what I liked: 1. I liked how they kept the price of coffee the same since they first opened: 9 cents! 蔅ut I didn't like how my coffee seemed to have more cream than coffee, but can't complain really for less than a dime. 2. We had a big group and ordered most of the must have items on the menu, so I got to try it all. 蔣ou can't beat the price and the quality and taste was good. 3. Love the old neighborhood feel of this place. 蔖ouring your own water from a spout in the wall next to a stack of glasses, the cedar shavings on the floor for easy clean up...this place reminded me of home in New Orleans. Dislikes: 1. I didn't like the fact that they didn't give me a separate cup of Au Jus to dip in. 蔍 ordered the "double dip," but it just felt like a soggy sandwich, something I really don't like. 2. I didn't like the fact that my food preparer was also handling the money. 蔈ven though she wasn't the "cashier," she still had to handle the tray that held the money and never removed her latex glove when doing so. Conclusion: The food is good and the price reasonable, although you end up ordering another sandwich because the first one didn't fill you up. 蔛o what you thought was a $5.50 sandwich really ends up being an $11 sandwich, which puts you in Katz's price range. I wouldn't make a special trip to this place, but would definitely make an effort to stop here if I was in the neighborhood. 蔄s my brother put it when we left, "it may be half the price of Katz's, but it isn't quite half as good..."

I saw Huell Howser going ga ga over Philippe's on his PBS show. But Huell is enthusiastic about everything under the sun, so I paid attention to the people he interviewed in the long line waiting for their French Dips. They were equally as rabid in their dedication and loyalty to this culinary landmark near Union Station. So I knew I had to try this next time I was in the area. I popped in for lunch before heading over to the Brewery Art Walk one Saturday. The line was out the door but it moved quickly. With all the hype and buildup, I found myself expecting more from the sandwich than I got. It was ok, not bad at all, however the sides and the mustard (more on that later) made it worth the trip. The coleslaw and pickled beets were tasty and substantial -- as good as it gets. You can never go wrong with Dolores Chili, either. They overshadowed the sandwich itself. I must return again, though, to buy several jars of their hot mustard, which they make and bottle to go on-site. It is spicy PERFECTION. I use it in many of my recipes at home. It's become my go to condiment for egg and tuna salads, and as a vinagarette ingredient for spinach salad. If the sandwich were as great as the mustard this would have been a five star review.

I don't even care if you were BORN in Los Angeles, you're not really an Angeleno until you've eaten here. 蔣es, the place is THAT much of an L.A. institution, and it's been here since probably long before my parents were born. I still remember being taken to this place as a young child before or after Dodger games, and peering through the glass deli counter. 蔄nd I think it's the exact same counter still in use today .... in fact, nothing has changed at all in this place in decades. 蔍 heard that one time in the 70's they actually did some minor renovation work and the chorus of complaints was so loud that they promised never to make any more major changes. 蔕ld, dim, and a bit grungy maybe, but people want their nostalgia here .... they don't want it to look like Outback Steakhouse, so don't expect much in terms of ambiance. Now the food .... this is supposedly where the French dip was invented (another restaurant disputes that, but I tend to believe Philippe's), so they serve it the original way from 100 years ago, with no side of au jus dipping sauce. 蔍 don't even think they'll do it if you ask, and you'll only look like a tourist if you do ask for that. 蔍nstead, ask for it "double-dipped", and they'll soak both pieces of the roll in the sauce before serving it to you and the bread will be soft, if that's what you want. The cole slaw here is the best ANYWHERE ... so much better that I can't even eat cole slaw anywhere else. 蔍t's fairly simple .... just shredded cabbage soaked in what looks like vinegar mixed with condensed milk .... but nowhere else seems to be able to prepare it quite like this. 蔍t's got the perfect amount of bite. 蔔othing at all like those nasty bland & creamy mayo-ish cole slaw sauces you find elsewhere. The desserts are really good here, you can't go wrong with the apple pie, but the blueberry one is actually my favorite. 蔜he lemonade is also well-known here, though the glass they give you is a little on the small side. 蔜here are no refills. Lines can be horrible, and frustratingly slow at busy times, so have a long story ready to tell your friends while waiting, or use the moment to check your email from your cell. 蔄lso, this is basically a cafeteria (not even a glorified one), so you carry your tray to one of the long tables with your food and plop yourself down on the stools. 蔣ou don't need to bus your tray afterwards, there's always somebody roaming the lobby constantly collecting them. 蔄nd it is customary to leave the spare change from your payment in the plastic tray as a "tip" for the woman that served you at the counter .... even though she's not really a waitress, all the locals do that if her service was good. Right across the street from Union Station, walking distance from Olvera Street & Chinatown, and a convenient stopover to or from Dodger Stadium.

Let's clear something up shall we? It is meat on bread, dipped in it's cooking juice. The rest is old school picnic food, prepared in all its' basic glory without industrial strength agri agents and economic algorithms. The word over hyped should not enter into a description unless you believe sparklers are an impressive form of fireworks ya dig? When someone is nostalgic for something and you cant tell the difference, that is not over hyped. That is you lacking the ability to read between the lines because IT IS MEAT ON BREAD DIPPED IN JUICE. Over hyped??? Over hyped??? WTF Ok. I finally tryed ketchup man. Yeah? Well... ya know, I don't know what all the fuss is about...it's f ing ketchup, everybody just likes it ok with you? Too bad it doesn't matter. Well this is f ing meat on bread, dipped in juice. If you go there and expect something else then that is your problem buddy. We liked the lamb the best, double dipped is just right. Potato salad I thought was good. Pies were quite good and yes the seating aint so hot when it is busy so I knocked off a star. Otherwise it was a good sandwich at a fair price.

A staple of downtown Los Angeles, I once had lunch at this sandwich shop. 蔜hey are known for their french dip sandwiches and co-workers brought me here. As with any place that is relatively famous, you can expect it to be extremely packed. 蔜his place is old school and has a lot of history. 蔄ll the way down to the open kitchen behind the ordering counter. �I found it really neat to have a place in LA where you order food in cafeteria fashion where you line up in one of the many lines leading to the cash register. 蔍ts also unique as diners all sit randomly since theres no private seating. �My review of the food is of the beef and lamb french dip sandwiches. 蔍 found both to be tasty but I wouldn't say the best. 蔖erhaps just rushing through during lunch hour can cause that but its not food that I would crave over. They sell all sorts of mustard as well, and the different blends of mustards are good and unique. 蔍ts definitely a tourist spot when visiting Los Angeles. 蔠hile your at it, you can check out China Town as well.

A solid 4 stars. Loved the decor, the fast service, and the comfort food. It didn't blow my my though. I wish everything were a bit hotter to begin with so that when you bring your food down to a clean table (those are hard to come by during rush hour), you can still eat it hot. When we got to our table, my beef dip was already mellowing out to room temperature. It's a very solid sandwich with unabashedly salty beef slices (in a good way) on a french roll that has been dunked in the jus. I loved the jus--just the right amount of flavor and gave the beef some binding to the bread. However, I would have preferred having the jus in a container on the side so that I can control the dip. Having the entire roll dunked in before you even sit down makes eating the last half of the sandwich a bit of an endeavor because by then, it has become soggy and is falling apart. Never mind that, it still tastes delicious! A great deal for $6. Make sure to take the time to take in all of the decor, and go into the back dining room to check out the railroad exhibits--they even have train models! There is something very special about the high walled booths that they have. I love them to pieces and they definitely bring out the 100 years in Philippe's. Definitely a good sandwich, but I would only stop by if I were in the neighborhood--wouldn't go out of my way for it.

It's a dive, for sure, which would be fine if the food was better. 蔏nown for French dipped sandwiches, I tried one, choosing the traditional beef (they also French dip other meats, like pork and turkey). 蔜o my surprise, it wasn't a beef sandwich with au jus in a little cup for dipping. 蔜hey dip it for you, which was the first disappointment. 蔍 was later told by someone in the know that you can ask for it double dipped, which may have suited me better. I was told by another Philippe fan that you can ask for extra meat, which in combination with a double dip (and maybe some cheese and a side of potato salad) may have turned the experience around for me. 蔄s it was, however, I was not impressed with the plain dipped beef sandwich. At 9 cents a cup, I couldn't resist the coffee, however watered down it might be, and out of sheer curiosity, I tasted their purple picked egg, which I don't ever need to try again. �If invited, I might try it again, but I probably won't be going again of my own accord.

Lines are crazy long. Floor is covered in hay. Food is OK, not the best I've had by any means. I think people come more for the history than for the food. Seating is family style. Everyone is friendly. Cute decor. 2.5 stars but I'll upgrade because it's fun to experience at least once.

Probably the best French Dip i have had in YEARS, and probably the best in LA. 蔄 packed house during lunch, just work your way to the front. 蔄ffordable and very casual. 蔍t is NOT nice inside, the interior is scummy, but it is a good deal. 蔊ive it a shot if you want a quick bite downtown with a tasty (a la carte) sandwich, picnic style sides, and some killer horseradish, without breaking $10.

I came to this place all hyped up and when I walked in and saw 50+ ppl in line I got really excited. 蔅ut after eating the french dip I thought it was just a regular old sandwhich... there was nothing special about it and it just tasted very... regular. I'm not convinced my first experience was normal so I'm going to go back just to make sure. One tip I found was to make sure you get the double dipped sandwhich. When I had it just single dipped I found it was too dry for my liking.

When I think of Philippes, I think of long lines, gross floors, and one heck of a sandwich. And don't forget their mustard from the Devils butthole...it's freakin HOT! We knew that we had to get their early, so we left work around 11:45. But the lines weren't as long as we thought they were going to be. I guess that the roach scare really took a toll on the number of patrons...Try not to get frustrated over the lines...after all your cashier is making your sandwich while you're waiting there... The beef was pretty good but we decided to go pork as well. The pork imo has more flavor than the beef. Not sure what it was...whether it was more seasoned...but it seemed to hold its flavor much better. If they had some sort of homemade french fry to go with the sandwich I probably would have given them five stars. It was the first time I had actually eaten in the restaurant as opposed to taking it to-go. Kinda random but if you eat downstairs to the left of the counter, you'll feel like you're eating in a mental institution/hospital. I think its the creepy windows hahaha. Great food...always consistent...Philippes. (btw...i checked for roaches while I was eating, so there's nothing to be scared about :D)

I like this place a lot. 蔜he sandwiches are great. 蔐amb, beef, turkey and ham are all awesome. 蔍've gotten 2 sandwiches every time I've been there. 蔍f you want the super dipped effect, get it double dipped. 蔜here's nothing special about their macaroni or potatoe salad, but that's not why you go there. 蔍 see people going all out though with pickled eggs and slices of pie. I'm not a hot mustard fan. 蔍 just can't appreciate what they're doing with that mustard. 蔍t's good in very small doses, but it just clears your sinuses like none other. 蔐iterally like 3 drops per bite is all I can handle. I brought some of their mustard home and gave my sister a jar. 蔍'll never forget when she dunked a pickle in the mustard and took a bite. �I'd say expect to spend $15 per person. 蔄nd they give you cans of soda to drink.

Like many others, Adam Richman introduced me to this place during his visit on Man v. Food. Once I saw it, I knew that I had to try it. As somewhat of a french dip purist, I opted to order sans cheese, but I did go for the double dip. The roast beef was a little more well done than I prefer, but the au jus that they make is delicious and easily makes up for it. This is a no-frills place that offers counter service. It's all good, though -- this isn't the type of place that you go to for the ambiance; it's all about the food.

Place had tons of good reviews so went to check it out a couple weeks ago w/ a few friends. Got the beef dip and friend recommended the potato salad. The potato salad was excellent! The dip was good too but surprisingly small. It was good, but nothing too special to be honest. One thing particularly cool about this place though, is the feel of the place. It's been around for 100 years and when you walk in it -feels- old timey and pretty cool. That bumps them from 3 stars for the food, to 4 starts because of the atmosphere.

So after a day of walking around LA, we end up in Chinatown and decide to go the infamous Philippes. Walking in through the door, I notice that Philippes has a very classic vibe to it. From the multiple longlines, to the sign, everything about it just seems "cozy" in a way. Waiting in line, I talked to some of the locals who've been there multiple times, and whose generations of families have gone here since the opening of the restaurant way back in early 19 something. They recommended the beef sandwich, double dipped, which I ordered. Also the lemonade + iced tea are only 60 something cents! I mean although its a very small cup, a cup of drink thats not water for some pocket change is something I can appreciate. And you can make your own arnold palmer for about a buck something! 蔛o we get the order and tip the waitress (I guess thats what the money trey is for?) and promptly grab my plate and walk upstairs to the seating area. The upstairs portion of the restaurant looks like when it just opened. Brick walls and cafeteria style tables and seating. Adds to that vintage vibe I was mentioning earlier. Me and my friends start eating and wow. I could see what the hype was about. The beef was just like really tender roast beef. Nothing too noteworthy, but the Au Ju gave the sandwich so much flavor. It was this beefy, soupy deliciousness. 蔛o definately double dip the sandwich.The spicy mustard complemented the flavorful sandwich perfect. The mustard was like hot mustard with a wasabi kick. It's not so bad at first, but had a spicy after taste. Eat a little too much and your nostrils start flaring, and your sinuses clear up. Nothing like overwhelming super hot though. We had a contest at the end where we just started dipping our extra bread in the mustard. And washed it down with that cheap lemonade. Walking out, I was filled but not full from one sandwich, which was good since we were about to go get 3 dollar Taquitos down the street on Avarado. For a small person or someone with not a big appetite, it would suffice. I could see what the hype was about, and I'll definately be back again one day. Another plus is that this place is close to the Union Station Metro stop, so easy to get to when metroing LA. Phiippes, a LA staple that everyone has to try at least once.

I don't know why everybody is hyped about this place. The place is not cozy. Yeah sure its something different and usually don't really see this kind of a mess in a restaurant but the food there was not worth the drive. The service is sort of bad because the workers look overworked and tired so they don't even bother greeting you. They take your order, take your money, give you your food. they have the KISS (keep it simple stupid) look on their face. I don't recommend it if you can't stand smelly people/surroundings

Let me ask you: are there images that keep you from eating certain dishes, like say, menudo, lengua, bamboobores? How about cute things like dogs, or bunnies? Well, this is how I felt about lamb, until I took the leap at Phillipe's. If I can stand in a confusingly ambiguous line for over half of my alloted jury duty lunch break, all for the treat of eating a lamb dip, Lord, something's gotten hold of my heart. Phillipe's is a true hometown gem, and yes, I know about P.E. Cole's....I have another bad visual association there, something to do with being hopelessly trashed on 6th Street (which I think a blast of Phillipe's mustard would have cured)... Anyway, nothing new for you here, just wanted to ask the question and share that everything has a price, even if its fleece was white as snow.

I went in there about 4pm on a Sunday afternoon for the first time ever. First thing i noticed was the sawdust they spread all across the floor. Ok I guess, until someone drops their drink on the floor. They had about 8 lines of waiting which isn't a very long wait, about 15 minutes. The prices were reasonable and the food was delicious. I ordered a sandwich with Beef and swiss cheese. It was quite flavorful. Definitely try the horseradish. Parking is somewhat tough so if you have a friend with you, have them go wait in line first.

How can this place not get 5 stars? The people that don't give it 5 stars just don't know what to expect when they come here. Yes, the lines are nearly always long. Yes, the atmosphere is a little overwhelming. Yes, the service is slow (cash only and people not knowing to put their money on the little plate). Yes, if you hit it at the wrong time, you'll have to wait a few minutes for a parking space. But once you get your food and find a table and bench, you can't be beat with anything on their menu! But why bother getting anything else but a beef dip? Don't forget to sneak into the line on the far right for desert and drinks. One of my favorite places to eat in town. A birthday tradition.

The lines are long because the food is good - so factor that into your equation when coming to Philippes (and if the lines aren't long when you get here, high-five yourself and order quickly before they get long!). I recently found out that this is the home of the original French Dip! It's the only one I've ever had so I'm a little biased - but who can argue with these portions? Double-dip it and you can still eat it like a sandwich, as opposed to sloppy mess (but if you're in love with the sloppy mess - you know who you are - just get the au jus on the side and drown it at your leisure!). Philippe's is great, FUN food on the cheap (easily under $10 for your meal) - and it's also a cool spot to bring out-of-towners for a taste of LA. The picnic table seating allows you to mingle with your fellow Angelenos and make new friends :) * Not my vegetarian wife's favorite spot, but what can you do?

Crazy lines before a Dodger's game, but worth the wait. It's set up like the bet windows at the horse races. Betting with your line mates on which line will move the fastest is the best way to pass the time and earn some extra cash! The sandwiches are great, easy to order. The sides are fresh. Recommend the Beef Sandwich, "double-dipped" or "wet". Remember, CASH ONLY! It does get tight in there, so if you have a wheelchair in your group, get it to go and save yourself the aggravation of the crowds.

I always make a point to catch this place when I get to LA. The sandwiches are awesome, they dip the bread in juices from all of the meat (lamb, beef, turkey, pork) and it make everything sing. The sides are good as well but tI think the macaroni salad is my favourite, it reminds me of my grandparents and they way they made it. One of the best things is the house made mustard, if you ahve a cold this will open you up, it has a fair amount of horseradish in it and compliments the sandwiches to a "T". The whole experience can be a bit daunting for the first timer sine you jsut line up pretty much anywhere and deal across the deli cases with a person who takes your order. This is the birthplace of the French Dip sandwich and they are certainly keeping the quality of that in mind and making one of the best sandwiches I have ever had.

Went back for a Beef double dip. This time I had a beer to go with my macaroni salad. What a nice way to start the day. Wonderful lunch. The thing that irks me is that I have to eat my mustard out the squeeze bottle as opposed to the jar they used to keep it in. The line was not so long and that is what made this trip a five star.

After seeing this on Man v. Food and hearing all about it, we decided to venture to Philippe's since we were in LA. What a disappointment! The sandwiches were ok.. meat a bit dry and too thick. Not enough flavor in the au jus or the meat itself. The best part was the mustard. Even with a "double dip" the flavor was lackluster. The sides - cole slaw and potato salad were okay... have had better deli/store bought ones... nothing special here. It was a nice experience and great to stand in line and see your meal prepared, but will not go back. I've had much better French Dips elsewhere.

Watched this on Man vs. Food... drove from SD all the way here & was pretty disappointed. This place is pretty overrated. It took like half an hour to get 3 sandwiches. Lines were crazy long & slow. Lemonade is good. Pickles were excellent with the almost flavorless sandwich. Chile was okay.. tasted like taco filling though. I felt like the sandwiches were overpriced for their quality & size. Like seriously, its just a toasted wheat roll with steamed pork/turkey/beef. Very bland except for the small amount of dip sauce in the sandwich. The mustard made me cry. Literally... For some reason I was hoping for a honey mustard taste or something. That stuff was horrendous. It was just wasabi packaged in a different color & container. It wasn't traditionally spicy. It felt like it just went up my nose & burned my nostrils, not my tongue. How do you people slather that crap onto your sandwiches?!

This place is down the street from my mom's house. If you have time you can even get your food to go and enjoy your food at Union Station. Pros: Free parking. Excellent roast beef sandwiches and coleslaw. The beef is lean and the aujus goes well with the sandwich. But it can be a bit salty sometimes. Cons: Long lines, wait... edit, very long lines. Cash only (ATM $2 charge). The prices are a bit high for the amount of food you get, especially after you tip the sandwich lady or she might look at you funny. hahah One more thing, I'm not sure if there's a bathroom there.

Good French Dip Sandwich. I can't speak much on this since I'm far from an expert on the French Dip, but I will say that the beef was nice and tender. They also have pickled eggs, which I tried for the first time. They're kind of pickled tofu, except more sour. I don't know if that helps.

We feel as though philippe's is living off of reputation and old timers who come back for more for its continued credibility. After hearing all about this place we decided to check it out and boy! Its was a bigger buzz kill than buzzkillington. The place was a cafeteria and the food matched. Although completely edible by no means was it bedazzling. We had the lamb and the beef with swiss. The sides were the best part of the meal (cole slaw and potato salad) Overview: simple, plain, overhyped, cafeteria, literally just a regular sandwich dipped in beefy stew. Compared to Coles org french dip: Coles has a much better ambiance, hotter food (not cold like Phillipes which displays all their foods on an open counter/subway style), fancier sides (like baked mac n' cheese and warm pies), and french dips that come with a cup of beef stew so you can dip as you please. Wouldn't go back to Philippes. Edible, but that's all.

My experience with roast beef sandwiches is limited to Arby's so that should tell you plenty about my palette for distinguishing a good roast beef sandwich from a bad one. But let me say, Arby's aint got shit on Philippe's. Whoever this Philippe guy is knows roasted meat and is serious about it. He should be hired by Arby's for consultation purposes to improve upon their sandwiches that I now classify as salty ass trash. I feel bad about that last comment...in all fairness I still go to Arby's when they issue those bad ass coupons and I like their service. Ahhhh... This place is cheap. Like bum cheap. I think Lemonade sells for whatever change you have in your pocket. I dig the atmosphere of this place too, but you probably want to be in the mood for it. Bright lights, tons of people, kids making me dread the day that I father a child, and sawdust on the floor. All of it adds to the uniqueness of this joint and I'm with it on this place. Keep it old school Philippe.

Most of the reviews here say it all. 蔣esterday I reviewed Cole's, an establishment also in downtown Los Angeles. 蔍 felt that since Cole's has something of an ongoing contest to compare the two places (Phillipe's seems to ignore the challenge and just keeps doing what they have been doing for over a century that works) I would just post my Cole's review here which mentions many aspect of Phillipe. _______________________ For almost two years my two sons and myself have been on a quest for the best beef dip sandwich. 蔊enerally we stick to Southern California but at times when travel is involved other places may show up in our study. Today we went to Cole's in Los Angeles California. If you want the short review I will just say that on the Cole's reverside of their menu they ask one to fill out a form to compare them to Phillipe's who are also in Los Angeles and also founded in the early 1900s. 蔜he each claim to be the originator of the French Dip Sandwich and have their own tale of folklore to back up their claim. Bottom line here is Phillipe wins according to the three of us. 蔜he meat was more juicy and tender as well as more flavorful. 蔍f you are looking for the better sandwich Phillipe is the way to go. On to more detailed info .... When we arrived at about 12:30pm on a Saturday they were busy but there was no wait for a table. 蔜here was a long wait for a waiter / waitress. �When our waitress finally arrived we were told there was not any beef available at the moment as their delivery was three hours late. 蔜he beef would be available in about ten minutes. 蔍 asked to speak to the manager as I was uploading a blow by blow live update of our experience to facebook, twitter etc. The manager came to our table and was very nice. 蔛he told us the beef was actually now ready and we placed our order. 蔕ur wait for our food was considerably longer than the wait times we have experienced at Phillipe's even when the lines were long. �I like to stick with the standard beef sandwich as it is easier to compare beef to beef and judge the quality and cooking of the beef. 蔅oth establishments serve lamb and other meats. We also ordered bacon potato salad and an order of their spicy garlic fries. Sandwich: 蕇ame size as Phillipe bun wise but there is more meat in the Phillipe offering. 蔜he meat at Phillipe is also more tender and flavorful. 蔆ost of the Phillipe sandwich is $5.75 versus $6.38 for the Cole's offering. $3.19 for fries and same price for the bacon potato salad. 蔄 little pricy for the size of the portion. 蔜he bacon potato salad was excellent. 蔜he fries were little more than your average thin cut fries with a garlic seasoned salt mix. Phillipe's mustard is hotter but Cole's is also quite good. 蔜his would be a personal taste issue. $3.00 for a large glass of fresh lemonade at Cole's versus 75 cents for a smaller glass at Phillipes. �2.00 for a cup of Cole's coffee versus 9 cents (that is not a misprint) at Phillipes. The manager gave me two "chips" - one for a free sandwich and another for a free cocktail. 蔆ocktails range in price but some of the more exotic ones can be more pricy than a sandwich so these two chips were a nice gesture to offset the poor service. Bottom line - if you are seeking the best beef dip in Los Angeles from our point of view we prefer Phillipe's as number one and Maggee's at the Farmers Market at Fairfax and 3rd as perhaps number two. 蔜he Dip at the Hollywood Highland complex is also up near the top of the list, perhaps in the top 5. 蔆ole's was nice enough but not in my top five.

What more is there to say after 1000+ reviews??? Just adding my 2 cents after going here for the first time today. Ok so I'm not a french-dipped sandwich connoisseur or anything like that...just an average Jane out to try someplace in LA that had a bazillion great reviews and has been around forever. This place did not disappoint at all! We were happy for the private parking lot which made getting in easy...and at first I was taken aback by the crowds inside. But we got our order right away...you get your order before you leave the counter and it's made the moment you order it. The bread was so soft and so fresh...meat was thinly sliced and piled high...there was so much of it I was surprised considering the very reasonable price. You'll use lots of napkins cuz the sandwiches are messy...but oh so good. I will warn, as others have, about the mustard. It's their special recipe and it is HOT HOT HOT. So try a bit first before you go slathering it all over your sandwich. I put too much at first and got a BIG surprise with my first bite. It's delicious though...and I wish I had bought a jar to bring home. It's kind of cafeteria-style seating, very minimal but there's lots of room for everyone. We will definitely be back on our next trip to LA!

I love the beef french dip here! We took some visitors from Washington DC here. 蔠e ordered the beef french dips, cole slaw, hard boiled egg, potato salad, and the .09 coffee! The only downer was I nearly killed them on the nuclear mustard. 蔜hey all put way too much on there sandwiches. 蔜hey all loved the sawdust on the floor. We didn't have any parking issues since we walked from our offices downtown. 蔍f you want to get parking, get here before the lunch crowds. Finally, it is a cash only place. 蔜here is an ATM in the restaurant. 蔍f you're a historian, you'll enjoy this place.

At what point does tradition outweigh food quality? Is the event of eating at The Original Philippe's out stripped by a good but not great food stop. Stopping in before the Laker game to avoid the $10 sandwich at the Staples Center that might be as good. 蔇ays before a Dodger Game when you figured one last stop before the stadium. For me it's always worth an extra star for the signage, staff uniforms, and other ambiance that make a place like Philipe's worth the excursion. 蔍t's history. 蔋ow can you rate that? So have a beef dip with spicy mustard and some apple pie for dessert. Wait your turn old school and take your tray of food to sit family style next to people you know you're going to end up talking to and liking it. Just enjoy.........That part is can't be rated.

I've heard of this place sooo many times, finally tried it before going to disneyland on memorial weekend. Like some of the other people on the review, I don't get the hype either. I tried beef and lamb sandwiches, and cole slaw. They weren't bad but really had nothing to rave about. Our double dipped sandwiches were actually dry. Meat quality however was pretty good, and we liked their hot mustard. Cole slaw tasted like any other cole slaws.. Our visit here was more for the experience i guess. Oh, and the fact that its cash only kind of bummed me out. This place must make hella bank, I don't get why they still don't take cards? X(

This place is another one of those Yelp hyped joints. 蔍 knew what I was coming in for the moment I stepped in, I saw lots of tourist looking people, and a lot of those artsy hippie looking people, and I saw the prices.....Ordered a beef sandwich - double dipped - and the first bite into my sandwich kind of forgave those Yelp hyped reviews, instead I focused on how tasty that drenched juice sauce was combined with the super strong horseradish/wasabi provided at each table. Sauces are EXCELLENT, they really save the sandwich from a 1 star, but for the size of the sandwich at $5.xx?? �One and done, this place is okay to try ONCE, that's it.

TRUST ME, this ain't no Arby's! Our professor took us out to lunch here (and no it's not elementary school, it's the good 'ole college education we all pay high prices for), and it was just as tasty my first-time around. First time, over a year ago, and amnesia's hitting me. 蔍 just recall my bread not as juicy and soggy, I like my food to drip. 蔅ut I do remember the sides... and I'm all about the sides babay. 蔆oleslaw, tasty. 蔖otato salad, tasty (but I'm very bias towards all those that are creamy/mayoy/potatoy). 蔖asta salad, good. And the cheap yet small iced tea, beam me up scotty! �Second time around, yesterday, I ordered a beef with jack cheese 蔰ipped sandwich. 蔄gain, it could be a little soggier. 蔕nly the ends of the sandwich were slightly mushed. 蔄nd then my professor taught me another lesson. 蔜o ask to DOUBLE DIP it!!! 蔄nd maybe, if necessary, to even TRIPLE DIP it!!! �PHILIPPE - until next time.

I haven't had a french dip in a long time, but this place was delicious. 蔅elow is what I ordered for me and my boyfriend: (don't judge, we wanted to try a lot of everything) 1 beef with monterey 1 pork with blue cheese 1 side of mac salad 1 side of cole slaw 1 side of chips 1 cup of chili 1 cup of stew 1 lemonade 1 Fat Tire 1 pickle All for $30!! It wasn't too soggy and had great flavor. 蔜he cole slaw wasn't too mayonaisy and the chili wasn't too salty. 蔍 wouldn't say it was the most amazing meal every, but it sure was delicious. The line was a little long, but what do you expect for a popular place. And coming from living next to Pinks, I was happy to see there was more than one line too.

Philippe's opened in 1908, but owner Philippe Mathieu took another 10 years to invent his signature dish. The exact origins of the French Dip sandwich are shrouded in legend, speculation, and pure fabrication. The restaurant's official version has Mathieu accidentally dropping half a roll into a vat of au jus while preparing a sandwich for a customer. The customer told Mathieu that he would eat his lunch regardless and an epicurean delight was born. Not much has changed since moved to its present location, off Alameda Street across from Union Station, in 1951. Sawdust covers the dark concrete floors. Customers queue in between long communal tables as they wait to order at one of nearly a dozen cash registers situated along a metal and glass display case in the front of the main room. The wooden tables form half of the Philippe's experience: they are the city's great equalizer. City Hall officials and lawyers taking a lunch break from the nearby federal courthouse sit side-by-side with tourists and construction workers. In the however many minutes it takes someone to eat his sandwich, he is just another Angelino taking part in a century old tradition. The other half of the experience is clearly the French Dip. Philippe's star attraction is the beef dip sandwich: a sizeable portion of thinly sliced, slow-roasted beef on a soft white roll dipped in a mixture of succulent meat drippings and beef stock. The top or "dipped" half of the roll gets slightly soggy; however, instead of ruining the dish, the sogginess melds the salty flavor of the jus with the robust flavor of the beef and creates a synergistic effect.

First off: I wish Yelp had half stars, because this place definitely deserves 4 and a half stars, because it's almost perfect. The place has been continually running since 1908. Nineteen Oh-Fucking Eight. They also claim to be the inventor of the french dip sandwich. With a claim like that, and business going strong for over a century - you know it's gotta be good. And boy is it - I have to stop here everytime I'm that side of downtown. My order never changes - Beef sandwich, macaroni salad, giant pickle and an arnold palmer. It's great every time. The lines can be long, but once you order - bam! There's your food. It's cash only, which is a bummer if you're not prepared for that, but they DO have their own lot so you don't have to deal with the shitty chinatown parking. Hell, I'm craving it now.

Walking into Philippe's is like swan diving into a giant pool of warm, delicious gravy. 蔜he nice young(ish) lady behind the register takes your order and then makes the sandwich right in front of you. 蔍f you order the lamb you can watch her cut the meat right off the bone. 蔍t's like a medieval renaissance fair without all the stupid wizards. The downstairs area looks like a Carolina cafeteria, and includes a candy stand not unlike what you'd find waiting for the Staten Island ferry. (Without the porno mags.) The upstairs dining area is a catacomb of dimly lit rooms with brick walls and linoleum flooring that really captures that "eating in a fifties orphanage" feel. But Philippe's lack of modernity, rejection of the hip, and timeless oddities are not at all bad. 蔍n fact, what all this amounts to is something close to magic: Once you walk into Philippe's doors and sit down with your sandwich, for a brief, shining, delicious moment, you forget that you're in Los Angeles. 蔄nd some days, there's absolutely nothing better.

Lets cut the fat and get straight to the heart of Philippes! The sandwhiches are simple and good, the sides are also on the level. don't expect anything to extravagent. Most of the time the lines are longer than the one to get into the pearly gates, but still shorter than a good club, if you got a friend or 2 it's best to split up and try to find the shortest. Once the cattle have been herded and your standing infront you should have worked up an appetite so its time to gear up on food! I always get my sandwhiches double dipped (both sides of the bread dipped in the french dip) this tends to leave the 蔮ack ends of the sandwhiches a little soggy but its all in the name of flavour! I prefer the turkey usually pretty juicy and tender, but the beef is pretty good (most of the time) sometimes i just dont want to deal with chewing the fat. The best way to create a tastey sandwhich is combo it with a killer cheese swiss is a fer sure 蕎ith the turkey, if your feeling really bold blue cheese with the beef, 蔶ack is always a safe bet. SPICY MUSTARD- if you like having your tounge kicked and nostrils singed - 蔄ND 蔍 DO, 蕋op your sandwhich off with their spicy brand mustard. I heard its why the little man on philippes sign is hollering. As far as sides go 蕋he macaroni (sp?) can match most any home made back yard barbque function concotion. The pickle is a crunchy delight, and if your into hardboiled eggs, the pickled egg is a must try. If your going to get a deserty sample yourself up one of their cool and creamy cheese cakes. And for 65cents, hell for any reasonable price they have great lemonade and iced. Philippes is old and has a catalog of historical events framed up on the interior of the building. Overall the place has the feel of a dinning hall back in the 1950's the hustle and bustle of working crowds, locals, and tourist. It is what L.A. is about, I love sitting down at a table and getting to chat with other diner's. It's a authentic experience 蕎ith a good taste.

This place is crazy on a Saturday....Lines ginormous and parking is almost impossible. With all the hype around this place, I was expecting a mindblowing french dip sandwich. The sandwiches were decent (although on the small side) but not sure what all the fuss is about. The bread is avg, probably a roll you can get at any typical bakery. The meat is tender, but alot of places have that. Good to try at least once, but it's not worth the trouble finding parking, waiting in line, pushing your way through the crowd, and sitting in the stuffy eatery just for a "famous" Phillipes french dip sandwich that isn't spectacular, but just "okay."

So I saw this place getting talked about on the travel channel and decided to give it a try and see what all the fuss was about. It was nothing to write home about. Both my friend and I had that "eh" reaction after trying the original sandwich w/ cheese with a side of potato salad. The meat was dry and didn't have much in the flavor department. The au jus gave it somewhat of a flavor but the flavorless beef kept kicking back making us unimpressed. The atmosphere did have a old-time feel and look to it but towards the end I ended up feeling like I was eating a sandwich on the loading dock of a fishing harbor. They did have a large selection of beer, though!

I'm not really a big fan of sandwiches but this place make me crave for sandwich a lot more often. I usually order beef sandwich with Swiss Cheese and lemonade. I always come here with my BF and he always order the potato salad. Personally, I think it's just OK for salad but he really likes it though, I'd rather eat the sandwich with chips. Oh!!! one more important thing, you have to try hot mustard!! The place looks really old but give me a good feeling though. All day, they always have people lining up for sandwich. The price is the regular price for sandwich, average $8-10 every time I go. Overall, I love this place and planning to go back soon!!

The greatest French dip, hands down. 蔒ustard's great, ice tea is nice and cheap. 蔊et the lamb french dip! 蔍f I had to rank the sandwiches... Lamb - Beef(tiedwith)Pork - Turkey - Ham. All were good, though. Really, my uncle and i pretty much sampled their entire sandwich menu. What came across as more surprising was their apple pie. 蔇efinitely homemade, fellas. My uncle pretty much said that it was the best apple pie he's sat down to in ages. For the record, I agree with him.

Its a good place to hang out and eat a good french dip sandwich. It could get packed with people, but we did not have trouble finding a table to eat. The environment is awesome, its got an old fashion restaurant feel to it. Although parking may be a problem sometimes, but its worth going there. 蔵 give it two thumbs up and would go back for a another delicious french dip sandwich with a cold one right beside it. The only thing that kind of bugged me was that they only accept cash and no debit. But other than that, the place is awesome.

Yeah, sorry Phillipe's - I REALLY wanted to like you but I think you are just over-hyped. I think the only reason you are packed every day is because of 1. tourists and 2. nostalgia. My hubby and I made the drive out to try the "original" French Dip. I LOVE a good French Dip so I was eager to try Phillipe's. The inside is pretty cool - I will give them that. I liked the tables and seating areas - you can have some pretty good conversations with strangers here. The lines were CRAZY long but I didn't mind. I thought it was a good sign. After 15 minutes I had my beef sandwich (I added Swiss cheese), potato salad, and draft beer on the tray. I took a bite and went: Meh. The sandwich was just ok. Honestly, I thought the French Dip I had at Houston's was WAY better - plus it had some kick butt horseradish on it! I then took a bite of potato salad and was not impressed. It actually had a funny taste - I couldn't place it. The best part of the meal? My beer. My hubby also agreed that his sandwich was nothing special. At $5.95 it is a LOT cheaper than Houston's (which is like $16) but it doesn't taste NEAR as good. Next time I'm craving a good French Dip I'll pay the extra. I don't eat out a lot and so when I do I want something good.

Last time I was here was maybe 10 years ago. My aunt Agnes was still alive. She always got the lamb dip with blue cheese. This visit, I remembered the great taste of Philippe's sandwiches. The roast beef broth was salty and certainly made it taste better. The lamb dip with blue cheese is as heavenlyas I recall. Coleslaw and macaroni sides are adequate. I just don't like the long lines, and how slow they move. And cash only. This is the 21st century for god's sakes! So I can only give 4 stars. But still, the food is really good.

The sandwich was deeelicious and the meat was tender, but I was a little disappointed that I couldn't get the au jus sauce on the side so I can dip my sandwich myself. Oh well. Quick service and good food- I'd come back again!

Over 2000 reviews and holding at 4 stars, what more do you need to know. I have been coming for 40 years and for the most part the food has always been good and worth the trip (I have always lived in OC). Granted had a couple in that time that were less then stellar but that is the exception and not the rule. Give me the Pork Double-dip any day and remember the USC weekends are the worst. It make for a fun day on the train from OC - Philippe's for lunch and Olvera Street for Dinner

Simply put, it's a classic for a reason. It's supposed to be busy, and run down, and a little dirty. Doesn't mean they don't make the best sandwich known to man. Their beef french dip sandwich can't be compared. It's amazing! And their pies, are delicious, having any flavor you can imagine. Their potato salad, macaroni salad, and coleslaw are all pretty damn good.

When you get there don't go in the first line. There is only one register and it took an hour for us to get to the front. The other lines are kind of split into two and there are two registers per line. Tried the beef sandwich with jack cheese and it was good. My husband had the lamb sandwich with swiss and it was dry. The mustard and potato salad were great! 蔜he lemon meringue pie was also good.

So we were in Los Angeles in the morning and went to Philippe's for the original beef dip. It was mediocre at best. Where's the beef came to mind. By dinner time we were in Mo Valley and stopped at Portillo's. 蔜he beef dip here is great. Pile on the peppers and its perfect. Chicago dog was the best I ever had. Two beef dips and a hot dog in the same day I had to add an extra 2 miles to my run in the next morning but it was worth it.

No trip to Los Angeles (for me) is complete without a trip to Philippe's. 蔒y parents introduced me to "the original" when I was very young and I am yet to find a better sandwich. 蔍t's hard for me to pick whether the beef or lamb is better so I usually get both. 蔜hey also serve wonderful sides and desserts. 蔎ust thinking of Philippe's tempts me to take a trip to Los Angeles.

The place is usually pretty crowded during peak hours and there it can be confusing where to line up, but just stand in line in front of one of the many cashiers and they will help you. Why line up? 蔜heir specialty French dip sandwiches of course! 蔜he sandwiches are no frills, just the meat, the bun, and dipped in au jus. 蔍t makes the sandwich nice a juicy. 蔍f you want to get your veggies, they have some salads. 蔜hey also have macaroni and potato salads as well as soups, chilis, and juices. 蔄ll of the items in their menu are made fresh. Their breakfast isn't bad either. 蔍t is similarly bare-bones but it is kind of a la carte style anyway. 蔖ancakes, French toast, eggs any style, bacon, sausage. 蔄ll you can ask for in traditional American breakfast. It's definitely not fine dining or a comfy sit down restaurant, but for what it is, it works well.

I went there with a group on the advice of a friend. "It's as close as LA gets to authentic, and there's sawdust on the floors. What more do you want?" �What more, indeed. How about a sandwich that's so tasty it's almost criminal, ZOMG horseradishy mustard, Fat Tire on tap, and a slice of cherry pie? I wanted nothing more. The eco-guy in me wishes they used washable plates instead of cardboard, and it would have been nice to see more carny memorabilia upstairs, but those are niggles. This place is awesome.

I think the only thing you are heading here because of two things: French Dip and Coleslaw. My favorite is the turkey one, but you can also choose beef, pork, ham and lamb. Haven't tried the Philippe's hot mustard but I heard it's good. Oh yeah, you can ask help from the counter girl what good cheese pairing for your deli meat. Coleslaw is really good there by the way, it is so balanced and just right for your french dip. The ambiance at first glance for the new is kinda not welcoming. But I can compare like you are going to your grandfathers and grandmothers, (whether you like them or not :P), on having a good sandwich and just hang out with the folks there. I can see that it tries to maintain that old school atmosphere.

In L.A. for vacation ive heard rave reviews from others about this restaruant. We ordered two sandwhiches the pork and the beef The pork was ehh kinda bland no really interesting flavors, except the bread and sauce was delicious. The chili we ordered with it was exceptionally good me eing from texas im used to great chili and this would compete for chili out there. The only downside on the chili was it was not spicy enough and i love spicy so i cant discredit them for my own personal prefrence. The Beef sandwhich was amazing. Everything you could want out of a legitiment french dipped sandwhich was provided for. The meat was tender and juicy, with au jus sauce dipping from the meat. The hot mustard we put on the sandwhich was reminescent of the good ol stadium mustard i grew to love while living in cleveland. and for 65cents the ice tea was great all in all i would deffinetly recommend this place to anybody, although i wouldnt make a trip out to going there if i was ever in the area i would most certainly stop in.

Today at lunch was the first time I've made it here after being intrigued every day I pass by during my commute to/from work in the Warehouse District. I am a big fan of French Dips and this one was by far one of my favorites of all time! No need for au jus on the side, they put plenty on the sandwich itself. I had a beef sandwich, but there was choice of pork, lamb and turkey as well. Next time I'll have the turkey. I just had to start with the beef to see if it was any good. I was not disappointed. The service was a tad slow, and I wasn't sure at first where the line began, but it seemed every cashier behind the deli counter had his/her own line, which got a tad confusing. 蔄lso, the plates and tray were all made of recycled paper, which I loved, despite the slight dampness of the tray. I can't complain about it though, since it is better for the environment. All in all, great place. If you love French dips, you will LOVE this place!

I honestly have to say I wasn't too impressed with what I've heard. For roughly $6 a sandwich, I expected something a lot more than just a 6 inch bread dipped in beef sauce and meat. After eating a lot of different sandwiches, I'm confident to say that I have a taste for quality bread and meats. I ordered the lamb and my brother ordered the beef, but both were pretty dried. I would think it'd be "juicier" since they'd be dipped into a sauce, but no, only the bread is dipped into it. Sandwiches were also pretty small. I must say I like the layout of the restaurant: it seems really "old school."

After so much hype from Man V. Food and from people I know, I was excited to eat at Philippe's. 蔖arking was a breeze at 8pm on Monday, but from what I understand this is not the norm. My wife and I tried the beef and pork sandwiches with swiss. 蔜he sandwiches were good, but kinda lacking flavor. 蔠e tried to kick it up a notch by adding the house mustard. 蔜he Wifey packed it on, not knowing it was spicy. 蔛he said it was over powering...kinda like eatting mustard with wasabi. 蔍 couldn't imagine how it tasted, so I took a big bite too and WOW. 蔒y eyes kinda started to water. We also had the cheese cake. 蔔othing to write home about. 蔜he coleslaw was good, but believe it or not I still like KFC's better. In short, it was good. 蔍t is definitely not something I MUST do again in the future.

I was headed to L.A. for business Monday and was going to eat here as usual and have my double dip beef sammy, lamb sammy both with hot mustard, potato salad, the soup of the day and my pickled egg. Under normal circumstances I would have given this place four stars for the food and service but since I read that the health inspector closed the restaurant down within the last day due to cockroach infestation I gave it the one star. The customers were the ones who exposed the problem to the health department. Philippe's should get a five star for being a historic place on the fringe of China town, but I am not sure when I will go back. It is hard to understand how a place of such esteemed history could allow for something like this to happen. Sorry Philippe's I wish you the best, perhaps I will be back someday.

The prices are low and the portions reflect it. The lemonade is great, especially at only .75, but the glass its served in is smaller than the roaches that infest the place. The cole slaw is great, and the sandwiches are pretty good too. It's a good place to visit for nostalgia, but there are much better sandwiches elsewhere.

Visited this popular LA establishment today and came away neither impressed nor disappointed. 蔍 had the lamb sandwich with Swiss cheese and was impressed with the flavor; make sure you specify you want your sandwich "double-dipped." 蔜he lamb was very tender which made the sandwich taste good. 蔜he horseradish is great; it'll clear out your nose that's for sure. 蔜he portion size was much smaller than what I expected so that was a disappointment especially paying nearly $8 for it.

Well, well.. what can I say: "you're reputation indeed precedes you, good sir!". One bite off the infamous french dip sandwich at the legendary Phillipe restaurant.. and that's all she wrote... TASTE. Deciding on what to get was the toughest part but after minutes of careful analysis and scrutiny, we ended up going for the lamb french dip (fd) and beef fd, both double dipped of course (that's a no brainer, please). Before taking your first glorious bite, condiments does come in handy; but please be warned: their secret recipe spicy mustard is really SPICY HOT. May I also suggest a plate of home made coleslaw, as it counters the spice and saltiness of the sandwich with its sweet and sour flavor. Two thumbs up combo. SERVICE. Parking was not an issue at all as there were plenty. If possible, avoid going here during their busy hours (lunch 11-1; dinner 6-8). That old-diner-like ambiance hits you as you walk in the restaurant. Pieces of cut bread all over the floors, old wood tables and benches, even the employees' uniforms were surreal of their early 1900's origins. Service was prompt. The counter ladies were a bit rude but a more bothersome realism that bugged me was their CASH ONLY policy, despite an atm machine, which by the way charged a $2 fee, being handy in the corner. PRICE. Decent. $7 for lamb, 5.75 for beef. Plus I think the tag comes along with the fact that you're buying a brand name and taking part of a true original LA institution, apart from the eating experience itself. Overall, Phillipe's was a genuinely great experience. With a superb taste, good service and decent price(s), this is definitely a must-see hotspot in los angeles.

Adam Richman from Man vs Food is an incredible food critic, but sometimes his recommendations are incredulous...like Philippes famous french dip sandwiches. 蔒y girlfriends and I traveled to this highly exclaimed LA landmark on a Saturday afternoon before a Dodger game, and there was absolutely no parking available in their 2 lots (that's how crowded it was). 蔍 had to park deep into Chinatown (blocks away) because there was nobody was leaving. 蔍t took a lengthy 45 minutes to get the food and boy, was the bread dry and the deli meat bland. 蔉or four petite girls, the rip-off meal cost us roughly $35 for the sandwiches, water, and chips. 蔜his place was defintely rustic, dirty, and totally understaffed. �Adam Richman, I'm disappointed in you...but you've taught me a good lesson. 蔔o meal should ever replace the Dodger Dog, beer, and garlic fries from Dodger Stadium.

So good. Best sandwiches in LA. I love the spicy mustard and Mac & Cheese. Double beef dip is the best. Some people say that's gross and it will be to soggy but no way it's worth the wait. No doubt it is the best place around!!! :-)

what can I say that hasn't already been said? Philippe's is awesome. 蔍've been coming here for years. The sandwiches are delicious, the atmosphere and an ambiance is nostalgic and fun. I enjoy taking out of towners and first timers to Philippe's, it's historic and fun, it's so "Los Angeles" I also enjoy buying old time candy or a pack of SenSen at the candy/newspaper counter. Tradition is to go there before a Dodger game which is what we did yesterday for my birthday, it was great. Looking forward to going back soon. LOVE Philippe's !

Theee best dip sandwiches period. 蔇on't expect 4 star accommodations. 蔜hey have been making sandwiches since the early 1900's. 蔏eeping the food fresh and the original vibe is their target and that is what you get! 蔐ive it up old school and grab a $0.09 coffee to go with your sandwich and bag of chips.

For decent food and good vibes this is it: The thing that stuck the most was the ambiance. It's relaxed and the food is good. For those looking for a place that caters to your whims for a homey feel with good food this is it. The reputation alone merits going to check it out. The people there where friendly, the service was brisk and cordial. Taking the time to go to Philippes is for those looking to get a feel of old LA without having to do a great big search.

So Philippe's is a popular staple of Los Angeles history. 蔍t's been at the current spot since's the 50's but has been around since 1908. 蔍t's also where the "French Dip" sandwich was born. This place can get extremely busy so prepare yourself for a long wait. 蔅ut there times when the place is not as busy and service is quicker. 蔆ash only, though they have an ATM machine. 蔒y favortie sandwich is the lamb double dipped in the au jus with a slice of swiss just tastes so good. 蔖lus you add the mustard that they make on site, (which is hot!!!!!) a little goes along way (trust me). I really like this place, I come once in awhile to grab a lamb sandwich and a glass of lemonade.

Hey Phillipe, i have to give credit where credit is due so i'll hand you two stars for being the inventors of such as sandwich as the french dip. but seriously? i chose to have my sandwich dipped on both sides of the bread, instead of the whole sandwich dipped, to avoid a soggy mess however that didn't matter. the sandwich was soggy anyway and pretty flavorless if you ask me. in fact, it was probably the worst french dip i've ever had in life EVER! even TGIF had a better french dip than you, Phillipe! and your sides are crazy covered in mayo. oh, and that coconut pie may as well have been called butter pie with a hint of coconut. after one bite i literally felt like i'd eaten a whole stick of butter. i mean, i'm sure my lips were happy as after that bite coated my lips there was no need for chapstick for the next week. anyway, again, i'll give you credit for the inventing portion of your existence but damn that was not a good meal you provided!

I discovered Phillippe's when watching a random tv show on the travel channel. Multiple lines lead up to the counter where you can order and watch them put your order together. I recommend double dipping whichever sandwich you decide to order and using the hot mustard sauce (sparingly, because it has a kick to it). I often wonder if just one sandwich will satisfy my hunger because it looks small, but it fills me up every time! Servers can be friendlier but it really depends on whose line you stand in. Parking has never been an issue, which is a plus considering how busy this place can get. I love this place!

The french dip is sooo good. I'm not a fan of the ridiculously unorganized lines, weird shredding on the floor, and how I forget that there are no french fries every time I go. The sandwich makes up for it though :] BUT BEWARE, don't wear a long dress or anything that could drag on the floor there... you end up sweeping the floor and getting the bottom of your clothes covered in dirty dirty shreds.

As a lifelong French Dip fan I had to go to Mecca to try it for myself. I live in the SF Bay Area, so I loaded the family up made the drive to LA to see for myself. We arrived about 9:15 am to beat the lunch rush not knowing how popular breakfast was. The place was quite busy but there was still seating upstairs (closed at the time). Multiple long lines up to the counter and these lines were moving very slowly. It appears they make your entire order while you wait at the counter, which would be fine for sandwiches, but not for breakfasts. Groups of 5 or more people ordering their big (and decent looking) breakfasts were taking 10 or more minutes per group. I waited in line for 40 minutes before getting to the counter and then my hostess disappeared for about 5 more minutes before taking my order. I ordered 3 beef, 1 double dip 2 single dip. I got 2 doubles and a single dip instead. So after waiting almost 1 hour to get my food, my order was wrong. Not really pleased. We also got a turkey sandwich, single dip. The food itself was ok. As it turned out, I liked the double dip more than the single, which I found too dry. I would venture to say the "wet" dip might be even better had I thought to order it. Portions were a on the small side considering it was $6 per sandwich. The food was lukewarm. The beef was cooked just right and the turkey was nicely roasted. The place is cute and definitely had that authentic feel, but I had been there all of 5 minutes before finding more than one way to improve on their system. They should take your order and give you a number and call you when it's ready. It would make people happier at least. It is cash only but they have an ATM. All in all it was an alright experience. I wasn't expecting too much and that's what I got. Don't go out of your way, but if you're a French Dip fan and are in the LA area give it a try.

First of all, I was amused with the woodchips/sawdust(?) that were on the floor of the first floor. Interesting decoration, but I do wonder how they sweet the floors with all those on the ground. Food is pretty decent at a pretty cheap price, but service is a little slow--and I came before the dinner rush. Being my first time here, and that I didn't read all the Yelp reviews on this restaurant, I was surprised that these sandwiches where a little different from the usual French dip sandwiches. And by that, I mean they do not provide you with the dipping sauce. But I loved the sandwich that I got (Beef sandwich with American cheese)! Although I would like it more if the cheese had been melted, but that's just my preference. Along with that, I also shared a side of potato salad, which was also pretty decent. The potato salad saved my life when I tried their hot mustard, however. Not being used to spicy food, I didn't try the mustard at first, but on my final bite of my sandwich, my friends encouraged me to try their famous mustard, since it will probably be a while until we come back up to LA, so I gave in and tried it. And MAN, it wasn't tongue-burning-spicy, but there was a spicy-ish scent in it that was very similar to that of wasabi (if I am recalling correctly from my one time try of it). Back to the potato salad, the potato salad seemed to have a neutralizing effect on the spicy mustard, so I would recommend keeping that in mind if you're not a spice person like I am!

Philippe's is such a special place to me. My grandfather ate here in the twenties, and brought grandma here when they moved to So Cal to work as welders for Douglas Aircraft. My mother's name was cut into the upstairs brickwork. She ate there while pregnant with me -- that mustard is in my blood, I think. When I was a child, I remember being fascinated about the little door in the back of the booth near the front stairs, and exploring the secret areas upstairs that are now off limits. My most important job as a kid, though, was saving a nice booth while the adults waited in line. My folks are all gone now, and it's the only place in the world that reminds me of them. Besides the total nostalgia of the place for me, I still crave the food! I don't know what people are thinking when they complain. If you want modern food, this is obviously not the place. This is about how the food _hasn't_ changed, not in my lifetime nor in my grandparents'. I just don't know where you can find that slow roasted jus, the perfect thin crust of the roll, the succulent juiciness of the meat. Oh and the mustard... that wonderful, kick-in-the-sinuses mustard. My order: 1 pork, 1 lamb with Swiss, double dipped and cut in half, a pickle, and a mustard for home. Sometimes I get a bowl of chili or a slice of their killer pie. And a paper bag for the left over sammy to snarfle down later, many miles away. I wish a happy 100th birthday to Philippe's... may they never change!

mmmmmmmmmm....... I went with my cousins, we ordered: the potato salad, corn chowder, 2 lamb french dip sandwiches, 1 beef french dip sandwiches, and cheesecake. The lamb sandwiches were SO TENDER, but it actually just sort of tasted like beef to me, but like melt-in-your mouth beef. I didn't try the beef sandwich, but my cousin liked hers. The corn chowder was also excellent, the potato salad, was good but not great. The cheesecake also so, so. But wow, you've got to go for the sandwiches!

Only this I could say is "I am honor to write a review of this historic place". My mentor of current employment took me this restaurant and that was my visit to Philippe. I never think about having french dip at China town in downtown LA. This place blew me away with gorgeous french dip, coleslaw, lemonade, and Pickled Egg. If you are in LA, you should definitely, visit this restaurant. I will guarantee that this place will fill you up with low budget. (Have you seen 70 cent lemonade in downtown LA before?) Make sure you tip the ladies at the front. They are nice ladies reminding my grandmother.

You really can't go wrong when you eat at Phillipe's. I've been going all my life...I'd say I've been a couple dozen times, mostly before a Dodger game. I guess it does hold some sentimental attachments, but I still think it's the best. I ALWAYS order the beef dip, double dipped...with a side of macaroni salad and a pickle. Sometimes I get an iced tea, mostly just fill up an empty glass with water from the water fountain. Then we go shopping up the way in Chinatown. It's a great experience.

At first it seemed like a mad house. I walked in the door and there was a large room below me with sawdust on the floor and full of people milling about. Across the room there was a deli counter with women behind it wearing retro waitress uniforms (think what you might expect a USO girl to wear in the 1940's). After the shock of entering, I began to realize that there is a little order to the chaos. The customers below me were actually in lines waiting for the waitresses. After I waited a short time, it was my turn to order. Of course, we all wanted the French dip sandwiches We also got a side of macaroni salad and a couple of potato salads for my two friends, Mom and Dad and I. The waitress made the sandwiches and got the sides for us. All the food and our five drinks cost under $40. We found a table in the back and started to dig in. Yum. There is a reason that the place where French dip sandwiches is still around. The bun was moist and the meat was tender. Unlike any other French dip I have seen, this one is not served with a side of au jus. Instead, the waitress dipped the bread into the juice before she put the meat on it. Dad loved the really, really hot mustard on the table, but it was way too hot for me. Not to worry, the French dip was great without extra sauces (and isn't that what the dip is for, anyway?). After eating the sandwiches and the salads, we were stuffed. But by the time I got to the Disney Hall for our concert, another French dip is all that I could think about. Next time, I am going to secretly get one to go so I can eat it at intermission. Here's a tip. You can get your sandwich "single dipped" or "double dipped." That is, you can get either one piece or both pieces of bread dipped in the juice. Get it double dipped. The juicier the better, right? Also, when you pay, don't try to give the waitress your cash. Put it on the little tray that they give you. They seemed weird about that.

Went here on the Saturday of Memorial Day Weekend. It was about 2:00pm. The lines were out the door. I guess that's what you should expect when your an old-school establishment with a reputation for the best French Dip Sandwiches. I'm sure it doesn't hurt to be featured on food shows and travel networks... After at least half an hour of waiting in line, I was able to order the original Beef French Dip ($5.55), a side of pickle, and a lemonade ($0.75). The food, as well as the establishment, definitely has that old-school lunch counter feel to it. The sandwich was good, but what made it was the horseradish sauce in the squeeze bottles on the tables. If the prices were still set at the prices they were when they first opened, this place would be five-star worthy. I'd understand the wait in line too, but this is LA, what can I say? People stand in line a quarter-mile long for a Pink's hot dog...A HOT DOG! This establishment also had a hint of butt, but there were definitely tons of people here and Philippe's has been at this location since 1951, not to mention the sawdust on the floor to mop up the spills.

Man this place is all hype. I've newly moved to LA and was told by 1.65 million people to try Philippe's, that it was to die for. Meh, I've had better. It was basically a roll with some meat on it...that's it. Pricey, small, and bland.

Loved, loved & loved this place. Saw this one on Adam's Man Vs. Food show also and came to check it out. It is definitely worthy of a visit. Prices are decent. The place is popular so parking could be a challenge. But they do have to lots onsite. The cole slaw was fantastic. Potato salad was great too. Food was home made and fresh. Service was fast. Although the place was busy, they have two levels of seats for busy lunch hours. They serve beer and wine too. And the French dip sandwiches were unbelievably delicious. Ask for the double dip. It definitely makes the sandwiches more moist and flavorful. I had a double dip lamb sandwich with blue cheese that's to die for. If you are around Chinatown in L.A., definitely pay a visit. You won't regret it.

My friends and I decided to go here a while back because we heard all the hype about it. It didn't disappoint. The place was pretty packed, and we would soon find out it had a reason to be. Of course, you have to get the french dip sandwiches. The meat was tendery and juicy. The bread was great too, dipped and all. My friend and I were still hungry after the sandwiches, so we got their clam chowder. It wasn't that great, as far as soups go, but it was still pretty good. One of the most memorable things about this place is the hot mustard. It is something special. I tried just a little bit at first, and it shot through my nose. There's not much at the very beginning, but it hits you hard after a while. I really like it though. Definitely a nice kick.

Yum yum yum! I had a roast beef sandwich and it was gooood! I'd never tried a french dipped sandwich but for some reason I ordered it double-dipped and that wasn't such a good idea because the bread got a little soggy so I don't recommend it (unless you like soggy bread!) haha but overall, the meat was good, the 75 cent lemonade was good, the 9 cent coffee was good BUUUUUT I have to say that the most delicious thing at Phillipe's is the banana cream pie. And I haven't even tried anything else off the menu, but I know it doesn't get better than this. The whipped cream is thick and fresh, the bananas...omg so good! You HAVE to try it! Cute little place with lots of newspaper clippings hanging around, very interesting customers and nooooooot so nice servers, but they weren't that bad :)

Went to Philippe's today. 蔍 saw the place on Man vs Food and was impressed that this was the place that invented the French Dip. 蔒y wife and I were in the area so I was super excited that I'd get a chance to get a taste. 蔜he place was packed and the restaurant was really interesting but the food was just OK. �I could have had my expectations too high but I wasn't overly impressed with anything I ate. 蔒y wife didn't like it at all and I was a little sad that she didn't even finish her sandwich. 蔍t wasn't that anything tasted bad, it was just too blah for her. 蔍t was a cool experience going to a place with a great history and an interesting story but, for us, we've had better french dips elsewhere.

One word for this place: OVERRATED!! �Just because a place has been open for a gazillion years & claims to be the all mighty french dip creator, doesn't automatically make the food spectacular. 蔍 was expecting to be blown the frick away by this place based on all they hype through the media, and here on Yelp. 蔍 was quite disappointed. �I got the beef. 蔍t was decent. 蔔ot amazing or particularly memorable. Just average. 蔜he old man got the lamb, which again, the Yelpers misguidedly claim you "have" to try & it had chunks of white fat in it. 蔇isgusting. 蔋e picked through it & ended up eating some of our daughter's sandwich instead. 蔛trike one. �Don't get me going on the "potato salad", and I used that term VERY loosely. 蔒ore like celery, relish & onion salad with a few bits of potatoes thrown into some gross mayo base. 蔍t was one of the nastiest potato salads I've ever had. 蔛trike two. The lemonade? 蔄gain, nothing special. �The fact that it came in a mini glass & there were no refills was utterly weak. 蔛trike three. �The line was ridiculous for some sub-par food. 蔖hillipe's - you're out. �And to think, I wasted a great dinner opportunity in LA on this over-hyped, undeserving smoke & mirror crapfest. �蔜otal waste of time & money, kind of like that other overly hyped, below average LA landmark, Pink's Hot Dogs. 蔎ust because you eat something in LA or Hollywood, or see it on multiple TV shows, DOESN'T make it go from average to life changing. �Oh yeah, and I'm NEVER eating at another joint anyone on Food Network or the Travel Channel tells me is good again. 蔍've been misguided & bamboozled one too many times.

After seeing this place on one of those food shows, triple D or one of those shows, we had to try it. I'm a sucker for a good french dip sandwich. We went there today and i got a twice dipped french sandwich. Absolutely mouth watering. I couldn't decide what i wanted for a side dish but i saw a server spooning up some chili and it looked pretty good. Si i tried it, it was marvelous. It was soooo good i went back in line and got me an order of chili to take home. This place i great. Old school and highly recommend it. Word of caution: the place is packed, but i goes at a fairly descent pace. I think we know the reason why it has been there since 1908. Oh yea, get a glass of lemonade, it hits the spot.

How can you not love Philippe? 蔋ow can you not love the sawdusty floors, the endless lines, the generic, old-time dressed, eastern european looking serving ladies, the tiny glasses of tea or lemonade, and all the delicious sides and desserts starting you in the face from behind their glass displey? 蔄nd how can you not love the salty, juicy and hopefully spicy (you did use the mustard, right) flavor of their delicious french dip? �I don't really care if they invented the thing, or if Cole's did...it's damn tasty. 蔍 recommend the beef. 蔎ust go with what made them famous, ok? 蔜he turkey is a bit dry, the pork is a bit salty, but the beef is just right. 蔊et it double dipped, or you will regret it. 蔊et a nice strong cheese on there. And add some of the damn spicy mustard! 蔣es, it will clear out your nasal passages, and you'll still come back for more! 蔍 also recommend the potato salad or the macaroni salad. 蔛tay away from the cole slaw. � Half the fun is trying to find a table, especially upstairs in the winding hallway and many rooms. �The price is still great for the amount of food. I had hyped this place up for a while to one of my college buddies who lives out in Arizona. 蔠hen he came to visit he insisted we give it a try, and he told me it damn well better be good after how much I had been riding it up. 蔄nd my friend, who is super opinionated and can find fault in just about anything, was not disappointed. 蔣ou won't be either.

This is truly an Iconic restaurant! If you live in LA and haven't tried it, you MUST. I think their business has picked up quite a bit due to the popularity of Yelp, Travel and Food channels who have done quite a few filmings there. I been a few for years and have gone there for years. I had all the sandwiches and most sides there. Here's my take: If you have never gone before, you should go NOW! Its not just for the food but its the whole ambiance of the establishment. Its stepping back in time and experiencing the culture that I think Los Angeles needs more of, instead of going to the strip mall and eating franchise food, try this little piece of LA Americana. If its your first time, Get the BEEF DIP (DOUBLE DIP), its a must. I actually heard someone ask for the au ju dip on the side. I was very happy and smirked a little when the lady at the counter said "oh no, we don't do that!" My favorite is actually the Lamb dip, but if you never had the beef, gotta get that first, since its their signature sandwich. Heres' my ranking of their sandwich, Lamb, Beef, Pork, Ham and Turkey (don't bother). My favorite combination is Lamb with Blue Cheese and Beef with Swiss cheese, both DOUBLE DIP (its a gimme). The cole slaw, soup and pie are all good and its also a gimme to get the cole slaw. I usually stick some cole slaw onto the sandwich to compliment the spicy mustard and the beef juice. Its a perfect combination. The spicy mustard is so good but spicy for most people's tastes. Its a lot like the British mustard and way stronger than GreyP. Some last minute advice, go to the line to the right, its usually the shortest, park across the street in their extra parking lot, don't bother wasting your time with the one right behind the building. Bring CASH!

Well I think the most enjoyable part of my dining experience was the fact that I was a Giant fan in Dodger territory. 蔅ut I have no idea what these people are raving about this place. 蔜he Beef Sandwich was good, but the menu lacked any options. 蔒y 7-year old had no choice to pick to eat anything; so I let him get ice-cream. 蔈verything was for carnivores or nothing at all. 蔄 kids menu would have been nice. 蔄lthough the menu was moderately priced, the fact that the menu was so limited to small sandwiches really took away from this place. 蔒aybe if these Dodger fans would experience Tommy's Joynt in SF instead of this place would they rave about it a little less! � stars for a crowded atmosphere with no menu. �What are these people thinking?

I'm rounding my 3.5 stars up only for the ambiance/vibe/people factor. I think everyone agrees on the cool factor - yeah, it's a landmark, the servers are decked out in retro uniforms, and an old-fashioned cafeteria can be a great lunch spot. 蔄nd the people watching can be, well, interesting. The food, however, is inconsistent and probably only deserves 3 stars. 蔜he beef dip is good, but dry - double-dipping only gets you more of the au "oh, salty" jus. 蔇econstructing the sandwich, it appears to be processed roast beef - I don't recall ever eating any natural, fresh-cooked beef having the color shading of deli meats (has a rainbow shine held in the light). 蔅ut, the bread was soft and tasty, and it's not a terrible sandwich for $6. 蔐ikewise, the macaroni salad was average and the cherry pie nothing to write home about. On the other hand, the lamb was delicious. Thick slices of tender meat on the same perfect bread. 蔕f course, more jus is always welcome, but salt bullion is not the same thing in my book. 蔜he "spicy mustard" is more like a runny sauce, but the flavor was a nice complement. 蔜he slaw was also good; fresh and crunchy, it is only made from cabbage. 蔍 think it needs to sit overnight to absorb more of the tangy dressing, but that's just my preference. Iced tea and lemonade for about 75 cents? 蔊imme 2 of each! 蔛ure, there's a line (or many lines you might say), but they move fast and parking is a huge plus! 蔊reat service to boot. 蔈at upstairs to get away from the crowds. 蔠hile I doubt it is as good as it was "originally", it's still a decent place to grab a bite and partake in some retro character.

I had 2 sandwiches today. I know I'm a fatty. But I always get the beef sandwich double dipped. mmmmmmm... And I decided to order the pork sandwich also. It was my first time trying the pork. It was OK. The meat was juicy and I also ordered this sandwich double dipped. It wasn't bursting with flavor the way I would've expected. Then I ate my beef sandwich and I was reminded of why I love this place so much. This is by far the best beef sandwich I've ever had. At least until I find a better one. I also paired my meal with their soup of the day which was split pea soup. It was bland, I had to add some salt to perk it up. And I also had a pickle. I came around 1:30 during the week so the line wasn't as bad as it normally would be so I just passed the lunch rush. This is one of my favorite spots to eat at whenever I serve jury duty downtown. It's only about a 5 - 10 minute walk from the court house.

Love Felipes .. this is how we said it at home as it was a spanish speaking house and I grew up on this stuff. Two of my aunts worked there in the early 80's and one of them is still there. I can still remember her coming home with a bag which I knew held a couple of sandwiches for us kids. I love the Turkey single dipped and of course I dab their hot mustard in there. Their Lemonade is the best and I also enjoy the coleslaw and pumpkin pie. For me one sandwich is enough when you have some of the sides to go with it. Oh and of course I like to munch on a bag of chips as well. Yes I have allot of great memories and nostalgia for Philippes but I also have to say the food is really good. I'm getting hungry just thinking about it. 蔜hank goodness my aunt still works there because I can get in her line and she always treats me to a little side dish :-) Yum

Not to be a downer, but this place wasn't all that grand. I love how they kept the historical layout and antiques. However, the food itself is not worth it's price. The woman who served me looked depressed and didn't smile at all, but I did get my food quick (was there around 4pm on a Tuesday). I tried both the beef w/ swiss cheese and the turkey double dipped. The beef had more flavor than the turkey and was less dry, but there wasn't anything special about the meat, bread, or the cheese.

Have been going to Philppe's literally all-of-my-life and the quality/value of their food remains one of the few constants in the universe! Aside from smartly spending my money here instead of Dodger Stadium when I go to a game (aside from a Dodger Dog or two) the best tip I can offer is: go there for breakfast too! Their breakfasts ROCK!! Try the house special French-Toast - also grab a jar of their Hot-Mustard to take home, it keeps you going until the next delicious double-beef-dip :-) Enjoy!!

Phillipe's is a classic! Great food, sawdust on the floor, communal tables and a wide cross section of the LA population are to be found inside. I have never been there where there hasn't been a line, but it always moves quickly. The beef French dip is a classic and I always like to smother at least half of it in their sinus-clearing horseradish mustard. Coleslaw and chips are a must have and pie, chili and custard are all other dishes I have sampled with much approval.

What can you say about this place that hasn't already been said in the last 101 years. There's a reason they've been around this long... great food. And this is the place where the French Dipped Sandwich was created, or so they claim. I used to come here at least once a week when I worked in the area. I hadn't been there in a while but did so recently and the place really hasn't changed. My suggestion? Treat yourself to a complete meal... order one of their signature dipped sandwiches with a side order of potato salad, a soft drink, and a slice of their fresh baked pies (a cup of their .09 cents coffee helps get the pie down). Or skip the pie and get one of their baked apples when they are serving them (it's a seasonal item... you can get them from October through June). You need to get in a line and place/wait for your order, but they have plenty of servers, so the lines go pretty quick. Afterwards, take in the ambiance of L.A. and work off your meal with a stroll through nearby Olvera Street, Union Station, and/or Chinatown, all well within walking distance. I need to leave the Orange Curtain more often...

I've heard so much about this place...from friends, family and even the food network. 蔈veryone I talked to says this is the best place to eat in LA. 蔄fter hearing all the hype I was was expecting great food but I was totally disappointed - eating at Philippes is like eating in a cafeteria. 蔄fter waiting in line for about 15 minutes to order I had to wait another 5 minutes to find a place to sit. I ordered the beef french dip and a side of cole slaw. 蔜he meat was very bland- no seasoning at all and the bread was soggy. 蔕kay, I know with a french dip the bread tends to be a bit wet, but this was real soggy- like, mushy. 蔉or the sandwich to be made "fresh" the bread was way too mushy. The cole slaw was good and I liked the hot mustard but other than that I've had way better french dip sandwiches from hole in the wall diners. I will not waste my time again going to Philippes. 蔍t does not live up to all the hype!

Delicious french dip! What's different about Philippe's is that the au jus is put on the inside of the roll before they add the meat. This way you don't dip the sandwich into anything and there's a lot less mess. For those concerned that this might make the sandwich soggy, fear not! The bread's outside stays deliciously crispy. Bring cash, and order at the counter. The lines toward the middle are generally shorter because I guess people just pick the first one they walk into. The chili is a little too greasy for my taste, but one sandwich usually fills me up with no need for side dishes. Be warned, is usually totally packed before a Laker's game (or any event at Staples).

There isn't much to add to the wealth of reviews here, but in the event that you're too lazy to scroll down, here are a few quick pointers that I gleaned on my first trip there this weekend: 1. This place can get really busy, so don't go if you're in a rush. 2. Ask for a double-dip. I was thinking before I went that this was a sandwich with a cup of au jus, but it's not - just the sandwich, with the meat pre-dipped. If you ask for a double-dip, you'll get something moist and wonderful. 3. I tried my sister's beef-no-cheese, and I have to say that I preferred my beef-with-American. Tasted kind of like a better (that is, moister and less unwieldy) Philly cheesesteak, in my opinion. 4. The potato salad was fine, but nothing special. 5. The pie was also nothing special, but how can you look at a beautiful slice of apple pie in a frosty glass case and NOT want to eat it? It won't change your life, but just indulge the urge. This place is too far from me to make it a regular event, but I'll definitely take visiting friends who want to eat at an LA institution.

This is a great little dive to go to, though I agree with some others that it's not a to-die-for, drive-200-miles-for type of place. 蔅UT, if you happen to be in L.A. you should definitely check it out. �I liked the double-dipped better than the single-dipped, but that's because it gave the sandwich a little more flavor. 蔈at it fast though, because the bread will get soggy. I like the pork better than the beef dip, again because it had a little more flavor. Potato salad and coleslaw were great standby sides though, again, not any knock-your-socks-off type stuff. 蔖erfect fare for the environment, the place, and the price, though. Don't worry that the lines are long, they move quickly, and there is actually tons of seating, even if in most of the restaurant you end up squished in between the lines of famished people when it's packed. 蔎ust be sure to guard your plate well if it's real busy in there - you'll find them salivating right over your shoulder onto your plate if you don't! OH, and the hot mustard ... that stuff is KYA (Kick Your @$$!!) kind of stuff. 蔠e LOVED it! 蔍t's really mustard-flavored-horseradish, but man that stuff's good!

Phillipe's is one of my LA favorites. I've been here alone, with friends, and on dates (so I'm not that classy - bite me) and have always been satisfied. 蔜he aura is old-school blue-collar, with sawdust on the floor and a railroad theme that I've never completely understood. But it's the food that keeps bringing me back, specifically the lamb sandwich, double dipped, add the mustard yourself. It's quite possibly my favorite sandwich ever, and I love me a sandwich. I discovered Phillipe's on my own about a year ago, so I've got no personal biases when I call it one of my favorite restaurants in LA, period.

It was pretty good. The Beef Dip Sandwich is tasty, much better than the Turkey Dip Sandwich which was a bit on the salty side. Potato Salad was good, Fruit Cup was good, Iced Tea was super cheap (65 cents) but came in a tiny, tiny little cup. The place was consistently busy with several long lines, but it moved pretty fast.

I used to be a fan of Philippe's but then two things happened: 1) Vermin infestation. I was willing to give them another chance after the whole roach incident and ensuing health department shutdown, and I did. Then; 2) The food sucked. A friend and I ordered two beef dips and they were not good. Every time I took a bite I was greeted with a piece of fat that was crunchy and didn't go away no matter how much I chewed it. Afterward we went to Cole's on 6th street and it was AWESOME. Delicious sandwiches and the bacon potato salad was great. Better selection of beer and wine (and mixed drinks too!). I'd rather pay slightly more at Coles (is it even more expensive? I'm not even sure) and walk away feeling satisfied, rather than disgusted.

A Los Angeles landmark. Everything on the menu is excellent. I highly recommend the beef sandwich, double dipped. The lemonade is excellent and super cheap, you'll end up finishing it quickly though, so get two glasses. Any tourist or LA native needs to eat here, it's a historic spot.

Talk about over-rated. I'm sorry, but are you kidding me? 蔍 know what a french dip is supposed to taste like (it is my favorite sandwich, I have been eating them since I was a kid) and this is not it. And it wasn't just me, I had two people with me who agreed. One of them had been dying to try Philippe's. DIP: you are supposed to be able to dip your sandwich. What you get instead is already dipped bread 蕋hat is a soggy nasty mess. Even the bread was a bit stale. The meat was completely tasteless. I don't understand all the good reviews unless we just caught this place on a bad day..but I don't plan on going back to find out, especially since they were closed recently (albeit temporarily) 蔰ue to a cockroach infestation.

Got a beef double dip sandwich and a couple of pickled eggs. The horseradish sauce is otherworldly - spicy and mind expanding. Definately the highlight of my whole restaurant experience. I can't say enough good things about that horseradish sauce. I was impressed by the fact they have pabst in a bottle. WOO HOO pabst. Other than that I found the prices to be about a dollar more than what the sandwich should be. Definately some hype at this place. But for a french dipped sandwich swollen with Au jus, this place can't be beat.

I told the manager that my breakfast was the most terrible dining experience I could remember. He apologized. Wow. Once they realize the lines have exceeded a half hour and everyone is grumbling, shouldn't someone walk out to the lines and start offering free muffins, coffee, water, magic tricks, something? Does it make sense to sell breakfast this way? Everyone waits in line, gives their order at the head of the line, and then waits for the eggs to be cooked, while water, juice, hot sandwiches, salads and so on start to be stacked on your tray on the counter -- and THEN the customer heads out to find a table? I'm pretty sure I could get nine-cent coffee, sawdust on the floor, and a 45-minute wait for mediocre eggs at a lumberyard. And it would smell better. And there would probably be fewer people complaining next to you about the awful service.

Absolutely, positively a must when in Los Angeles. Terrific sandwiches, a uniquely crowded yet pleasant atmosphere, and free parking to boot. I recommend the lamb french dip with jack cheese, two iced teas, a cup of chili, cole slaw, and a slice of apple pie as a perfect meal. All that may run you about $12, and is out in minutes. I especially recommend it on weekends around lunchtime before Dodger games for an even more colorful experience. Only real downside is that they don't take cards, so make sure to visit the ATM in the main eating area if you aren't carrying cash.

a couple of buddies and i were road trippin' in LA and one friend realllyyyy wanted to try this place because he saw it on Rachel Ray's show or something. so we find this place, and it was PACKED- four longggg lines full of people. lucky us, we came right after the dodgers (i think) game, so everyone was decked out in their baseball gear and hungry as hell. i had no idea what to get, but this lady next to me told me to get the beef! she was really nice, she even explained to me what that weird purple ball thing that everyone was getting- it was pickled egg. ehhh no thanks, i'll try that next time.. maybe. so i got the beef sandwich with some macaroni salad and some fresh iced tea. we were pretty hungry so we were expecting something EXTRAordinary. warning: that bottle of yellow sauce is not honey mustard, rather HORSERADISH.. very strong horseradish. i had the delight of watching my friend realize this on his own as the fat blob of "honey mustard" that he squirted on his sandwich instantly made its way into his mouth and out his nose.. yanno that whole horseradish sensation. the sandwich wasn't as delightful as i was expecting.. it was kind of dry actually, even though it was dipped in that broth sauce. i wanted to put more of that horseradish sauce on it to moisten the sandwich, but it woulda been overkill. instead, i washed it down with the fresh iced tea. the iced tea was pretty refreshing!-- and cheap too, i believe it was around 65cents. the lady serving us was in a REALLY b_tchy mood.. which didn't make for a great first time experience! especially for us being from norcal.. so minus one star for the service as well. i'm glad we tried this place, though, even though it wasn't all that great. it's cool to try places that have been on TV. however, i don't know if this place should have been featured on any TV show.. the food was rather mediocre. just sayin!!

Maybe I'm just not a fan of the french dip sandwich, but I do LOVEEE their mustard. 蔍'm not going to lie, I was tempted to slip a bottle in my tote bag. 蔍 felt the sandwich was lacking in flavor, the potato salad helps. 蔍 do like the decor of the restaurant. 蔝pstairs, I felt like I was having lunch in a prison cafeteria with my serving tray and a old fan...awesome. 蔒y guy friends love the sandwich, I just wasn't that excited for it. 蔅ack to the hot mustard, THE spiciest condiment 蕐our taste buds will ever experience from a mustard. 蔄ll you need is a little, unless you're like me and enjoy that burning/minty feeling, then just squirt that sucker. 蔍'll definitely come back again to give it a try and maybe...maybe they'll get another star from me.

After all the fuss, I guess I expected too much. Yes the prices are alluring - they have kept their drink prices as low as they were when it was opened, but know that the cups are kiddie-sized. Once you know what to expect, then you won't be disappointed. I got their famous roast beef sandwich and chili. Roast beef sandwich was very plain. And soggy. My friend wanted extra au jus and they wanted to charge him more for a side of sauce. What?! The chili was good the first bite, salty the second, and extra salty the third on. I wanted to ask for water but was afraid they were going to charge me more. I would have to say that the place has a lot of flavor to it, as in their decor and setting. It is a very photogenic place and a great place to people watch. But now that I know what the hype is about, I also know what it is NOT about. I suppose we all ordered the wrong things but I wouldn't feel up to spending another hour driving back, looking for parking, and standing in line just so I can try something else in the hopes of it *maybe* *possibly* being good.

First of all i love French dip sandwiches . These were flat out plain. No Flavor. I recently move to southern California from th Oakland Bay area. And i caught man vs food's episode from Phillippes. So i thought i would try it... they wont give you the au jus on the side. they insist on dipping your sandwich. the best park of my meal was the pickle! I tried one of each . The Turkey, Beef Lamb and pork and i was not satisfied. not to mention i was still hungry. I was only full from eating so much bread.( i even finished my girlfriends meal because she was so disappointed.over all.... i wont recommend this place to anyone.

I highly recommend Phillippe if you've never tried it. Their french dip beef sandwich is excellent. 蔍 usually get that and a bowl of straight up chili and a lemonade when I go. 蔍t's a requirement that you use some of the hot mustard they have on the tables on your sandwich and chili. 蔜he food has always been really consistent and great. Some others here have commented about the long lines. 蔣es - there are lines, but that should be an obvious indication that the food is great! If a whole bunch of people are willing to wait for it, I think that speaks for itself. 蔍f you're sitting on the 101fwy 蔭nywhere near Alameda and you need something good, stop by Phillippe.

Anywhere near downtown LA is a disgusting eyesore that you have to get used to, probably the filthiest big city west of the Mississippi and Philippe's is always crowded and what for? A small roast beef dip with nothing on it and tasteless meat, long lines not worth waiting for a lousy sandwich, but the potato salad was decent. And of course parking, I worked in downtown for 7 years and the streets are still filthy. I don't mind going out of the way for a good sandwich, I'll never bother with this place again.

I'll be the odd duck, I don't mind it. Get some lumber, crucify me. I just don't see what's with all the 4-5 star reviews we got here. First of all, I hate any restaurant that acts as though they are doing you a favor by letting you eat there. I got the feeling that this is the case here, simply because they're so popular. When we asked for a side of Au Jus, they simply said no. They don't do that. I can understand why they don't (hassle) but a restaurant is there to serve you. Our counter lady was very friendly, I give them that. Lovely lady. I am not a fast eater, so for me... the pre-dipped sandwich is just a soggy mess. Good flavor, don't get me wrong... but not the best quality. I'm not a huge fan of big chunks of fat in my sandwiches. While we were there, it was busy, but not crazy. I'm sure they've seen far worse, but the place was filthy. There wasn't a single table in the place that didn't have people's leftover trays on them. We ate upstairs and it was even messier up there. I don't know about you guys, but I felt like i was visiting my lunatic relative in the insane asylum. It's room and room of plain white walls and bare interiors, just huge tables. The fact that the boyfriend insisted on ordering a little cup of tapioca pudding certainly didn't help matters. If you were sitting up there alone, it would be absolutely creepy. After we were done, a worker walked by wearing a dress uniform, panty hose with plain white nurse's tennis shoes. I don't know, maybe there's a mental hospital 'round back. I read about the famous mustard, but I really couldn't convince myself to dip into the pots that are sitting on the table in the warm rooms, unattended, just begging for someone to stick their filthy fingers in... or whatever other filthy part they have attached to them. Seriously, I'm really not a snob and, so what, I eat things off of my own floor... but this place is just gross. Maybe it was an off-day, but considering how many restaurants are in Los Angeles, why bother? I'd rather go to a regular restaurant that isn't "famous" that will serve me some F'ing french fries and let me dip my sandwich at my pace. I'm allowed to vote, I'm allowed to own property and I'm allowed to drive a car... but I can't dip my own sandwich. So, really.. there's no French Dips here, just French dipped. See how I did that? As I write this, next to me sits the boyfriend who was outrageously offended that I'm writing up our experience at Philippe's without getting his two cents first. I told him to go write it up on his own (unused) Yelp account. So, after we go back and forth, back and forth, I agree to put in some of his thoughts. His thoughts?: "It was alright."

Like Philippe needs my two cents. But you can't go wrong with a cafeteria-style restaurant that serves what seems like cafeteria food (sandwiches, "freshly made" rustic pies) without the cafeteria taste and quality, at a cafeteria price. I came here before going to a lecture given by Joan Didion, and I must say that night I enjoyed Philippe's sandwich and apple pie more than Joan Didion. Although, both have been around for ages, both are notable and iconic, and both are an American institution, but I doubt Didion is as tasty as the sandwich served at Philippe. I may be reviewer #302, but I'm sure I'm the only Yelper to compare Joan Didion to a French dip (the sandwich, not Sarkozy).

now that i've finally been there, that's about the only positive thing i can say about the place. definitely all hype. (although, maybe i should reserve my judgment until i've tried their pork. but if you can't even do pork right, what can you do right?) had their beef sandwich, double-dipped. beef they used was maybe just a notch above steak-umms: thin, dry and flavorless. even with the double-dip, which was a scary sign. i've heard from multiple folks philippe's quality has gone down through the years and i have to believe it. because there's no way this place could be this hyped if it was always this meh.

I have to weigh in on this. For the dip I give it a disappointing 3 stars. It is good. But, does not live up to its reputation. I can say that after eating there for the past 20 years. I took it down a star after trying the brisket dip at Langer's. It far surpasses any dip sandwich anywhere. Langer's sandwiches are as good as any sandwich anywhere. Having said that I will still go back to Philippe's. I think it is a place to go to at least once, with an open mind and enjoy this institution. Because it has stayed to the same quality, service and cleanliness for such a long time I tossed it an extra star.

Having tried Cole's before I went to Phiippe's, I can easily say that their French Dip sandwiches are superior in every way. This is the kind of place that gives L.A. character and I'd certainly return for more. Crazy lunch hour lines but they move pretty quick and it's well worth it.

This place is more about the experience. As far as a French bread sandwich. It wasnt the best I've had and the place doesn't have the best decor either. You really feel like you're in l.a. with this place.

I'm not a fan. 蔜here was nothing special about my roast beef dip sandwich. 蔄fter all the hype I'd heard, I expected to be blown away. 蔍t wasn't awful, but it really wasn't any better than the average supermarket sandwich. 蔒y brother's lamb and blue cheese was decidedly better, but I still wouldn't make a special trip to Philippe's, although I do have to say the potato salad was pretty tasty.

So, this place claims to be the birthplace of the french dip. I had the traditional beef sandwich, which I wasn't too impressed with. I unfortunately saw the episode of " no reservations" when Tony visited this place after I went here, otherwise I would have asked for my sandwich to be double or triple dipped. This is the only place I've had a pre dipped french dip, versus the expected au jus on the side. They also offer other cuts of meat for your sandwich, so if I ever make it back I would like to try the lamb. It hurts me to say it, but I think Quiznos has a better french dip. Please don't tar and feather me for it!! This place does have a following, so I'll probably have another go at it!!

finally got a chance to experience this iconic LA landmark! �tried the lamb and the beef dips along with a side of meaty chili. 蕋he horseradish is STRONG, in a good way so just be careful with how liberal you are with it ;-) 蔰efinitely liked the lamb better than the beef and overall its lived up to its legendary status but i would have to say that its not the BEST french dip i've ever had. 蕋he meat was not as tender as it could have been and the bread didn't leave me yearning for more carb injections. 蕇till...i'm a fan for sure and it's gonna be one of my "cravings" props for having pickled eggs and pickled pigs' feet on the menu! tip: LONG ASS LINES, be prepared

I'm always surprised we find a parking spot every time. My favorite is the double dipped lamb sandwich: in one word, decadent. That jus just upgrades the sandwich bread from meh to stellar. The mustard is a must, and I favor washing it down with a glass of lemonade (of which my only complaint is the small glass size). Trust me, that burn is good. The cheesecake and potato salad are quite tasty. Casual retro cafeteria feel, straw on the floor. Cash only, so be ready when you're at that deli counter, and bus your own trash.

Mmmm. 蔅eing world famous doesn't bring Philippe's into the world of pretension. 蔜he original French Dip IS amazing and is in a completely comfortable and modest setting. 蔜hey serve you in that old NY deli sort of way- several lines leading to several deli-cutters. 蔜he ladies serving you are great. 蔍 first tried the lamb sandwich double dipped with a coke. 蔍t was so good, I had to try a turkey sandwich with american cheese double dipped. 蔍t was awesome too, but I recommend all first time users to go for the lamb.The quality of the meat is evident from the first bite. 蔜he softness of the bread, partially curteous of a stellar au jus, is the perfect outer-protection for some tender and juicy lamb. 蔜he sides are also spectacular. I particularly like the Russian cole slaw. 蔍t's definitely worth trying out if you're in town.

I came here before a Los Angeles Kings' Game last Saturday, and living in San Diego I hadn't had the opportunity yet to try it. I have to admit I only had one thing in mind when I stopped in, French Dip Sandwiches. I like every other human being as heard and seen the hype about them on countless food network and travel channel shows, all saying they are a must try. I'm here to say that they're all right. I had the pork sandwich, hearing that the beef is the least delectable, and I must say that for only six bucks, I felt like I was stealing. It was amazing. Not perfect or the absolute best sandwich I've ever had, but I must say it ranks up there with the best. A must try in the LA area for anyone, visiting or the lucky ones who live up there.

I didnt like it very much, i've seen this place on TV, so I thought it must be good right!!?!?! WRONG...the sandwiches was not hot at all, the meat wasnt seasoned, for peep sakes the cheese didnt even melt on the sandwich. I taste anything special in the dippings on the sandwich. I brought 2 sandwiches for me and 2 for my girlfriend. she only ate half of her sandwich nd didnt even wanna take another bite. We had beef, lamb, and pork all w/ cheese lack luster food, shouldve went to dennys and got a better meal for 30 bucks instead of this crap, you literally can buy bread and meat from the store and make a better SANDWICH!! only thing about this restaurant was how spicy the mustard was. I will not return waste of gas money. if ur easily amazed at bland food, then i recommend this place.

I don't understand the hype. I'm not a fan of the pre-dipping action and the meat was dry. I got the lamb and my friend had beef and neither of them lived up to my expectations. Sad day. Also everything else ie. sides and those crazy eggs just looked so unappetizing.

I tried this place for the first time after hearing about it from the food network. When entering this place had a casual feel to it with TVs on the walls a alittle gift shop by the entrance also located in the back was alittle train museum which seemed fitting because of the closeness of union station on to the food the menu is simple and offers bottled beers to 50 cent lemonade and iced tea.They also have some pretty good chili to go along with your sandwich ordered a lamb French double dip with Swiss cheese and pickles which was heavenly the tables is located their famous mustard which accented the sandwich perfectly.After my sandwich and chili were gone it was time for desert which they also offered had a slices of the banana pie which was the perfect exclamation mark to end the meal.

Melt-in-your-mouth lamb on crusty/pleasantly soggy rolls, crunchy coleslaw, and banana cream pie with whipped cream so thick that it's as stiff as whipped butter. With its vintage menus on the walls, sawdust on the floor, wobbly stools, high counters, peeling paint, and names scratched into the bricks, Philippe's is one of those places that looks like they haven't changed their ways over the past century and that they'll keep doing things their way for the next century. 蔍 like that. I'm pretty sure they use modern refrigeration and kitchen appliances in the back. As recommended by my boss, I got the lamb dip and added jack cheese. 蔍 also added a healthy dose of their sinus-clearing mustard (which tasted a lot like the Coleman's Mustard Powder we use at home). The meat was soft and fell apart easily and the soft cheese melted into the gaps between the pieces and into the au jus softened side of the bread to somehow couple the two textures together. 蔇espite having been dipped, the roll would still surprise me with a crunch on every other bite. 蔐ovely. The coleslaw was crispy, sweet, and good, but not amazing (I'd give it 3 stars on its own). The banana cream pie was solid. 蔐iterally. 蔔o oozing of anything. 蔜hick and dense, I probably could have gone without it (or maybe split it with someone). Philippe's makes a solid french dip and it's reasonably priced (6 for beef, pork, ham, or turkey, 7.50 for lamb). 蔅ut living and working in Pasadena, I'm not sure if it's worth the drive to downtown, especially when La Grande Orange just a few blocks away from me serves a comparable, if not superior, French dip at twice the price.

This was my second time here. We found ourselves here after attending Palm Sunday Mass at the Cathedral. So he was in the mood for Philippe's and this is where we stopped. The last time I was here which was my first time it was packed. So packed you could not figure out where a lines ended. So packed you had to squeeze in a seat near a stranger which is the norm there. The pictures here do this place justice. The food and the crowd is just the way you will find it to be. This time however 蕎e found the crowd for a Sunday awfully light. I could actually find where a line ended without a problem. 蔣ou could even see the floor. I don't remember the saw dust but guess it has always been there. I ordered a turkey. It came plain and they dipped it. That was all it needed for me. The turkey was yummy, not thin sliced at all. I had some coleslaw and it was pretty normal tasting. They have other choices for salads but I knew the sandwich alone would do me in. I did have a slice of cheese cake that we shared and it was not bad for a joint like this. Most sandwiches now are $5.55 or $6.55. They do have a cheese sandwich and the price varies depending on what cheese you pick. The cheese sandwiches are a lot cheaper. 蔛o if you are not into the meat eating business you can still stop by and find a bite to enjoy.

Phillippe's blows... ...is what I'd say if I didn't have any taste buds or just poor taste or no common sense...well you get the idea. According to my friend, you're not a true Los Angelino unless you have Phillippes. While I can't verify if that's true or not, I do feel much closer to this town now after living in it for all 22 years of my life (at the time of this review) and feeling a bit outsiderish. Phillippes is one of those classic places. It's quintessential and original. It features a menu, probably rarely changed since it's birth a 100 years ago, that manages to be simple yet offers a plethora of choices. Choices, might I add, which will rarely lead to regret. Well maybe one regret, why did I try this cause I now I just want more and more. Phillippes offers some of the best sandwiches I've ever had. Of course, they specialize in the french dip sub. I've had my fair share of french dip subs in the past and after today I can confidently say that none of them can hold a candle to Phillippe's. They say that imitation is the sincerest form of flattery but anyone who tries to imitate Phillippes falls short and does a disservice to the great name. The sandwich is simple, it's just bread, meat, and some of the best au jus I've had. You can ask for some cheese too (for extra) but I could have gone without it. Sandwiches can be something special and the bread really makes Phillippe's special. It's got an odd mix of stale and toasted yet fresh. I know that doesn't make sense but once you try it, it'll make sense. Actually, while saying something stale isn't the most appetizing, it's got a purpose. The bread is a bit dry on it's own but that's what separates this place from all the others. In the past I've had places that uses great breads fresh from the oven but since their bread is so moist on its own...dipping it in the au jus just causes it to be soggy. Phillippe's can still be soggy but it's not all soggy and the bread manages to stay in tact yet hold the flavors of the au jus. Maybe it's not "stale" but whatever it is puts this place a cut above the rest. The meat is another wonderful addition. it's very flavorful roast beef. It reminds me of a home cooked meal and it's not very different from something my Dad would cook for dinner. The roast beef has hints of onion and garlic and it's not over powering. None of the flavors really are, they manage to compliment each other. My only complaint with the sandwich is it's a bit small for my rather large appetite. The next time I come here, that problem will be remedied because I'll want to try the pork and lamb sandwich. My meal also consisted of a wonderful potato salad. It had a bit more mayo than I usually like and a strong pickle/relish taste to it but it was a great side order with the sandwich. The other highlight of Phillipes has to be their mustard. It's very spicy and my friends warned me profusely about it's potency. I chose to ignore their warnings and I just lathered it on. It packs a punch and for a few bites there were tears in my eyes. However, I only felt the strength of it's spiciness in short pulses and then it passed. Sure it cleared my sinuses but I think if you take a bite of your sandwich or put a forkful of potato salad in your mouth...you'll be fine but still, proceed with caution. As for the atmosphere of this place....you can't ignore the history. It's a meeting hub for Los Angeles before sporting events, especially since it's located close to both Staples Center and Dodger Stadium. I would strongly recommend to avoid this place if there is an event at both Staples and Dodger Stadium. I went on a night of a Kings game and Dodger exhibition game. There was a huge line and we waited for about 30 minutes but in the end it was worth it to get such a fresh, hand made sandwich. I can't even imagine what a big regular season game versus the Giants and a Laker playoff game would bring this place. My friends, who are veterans of this place, believe that there's no middle ground. You either love it or hate it. I fell in love with my first bite and I hope to have more and more bites and fall in love all over again.

Tables.. many ppl just go in and out so you dont need to be searching for a table..there are usually seats available. onto their sandwiches..mmm.. Philippe's French Dip Roast Beef sandwich is sooo delicious! i can eat two by myself (the sandwich is pretty small, in my opinion).

Okay, now that was a really bomb sandwich. I was already in a good mood after having the smoothest Downtown parking experience ever. I was a little worried that the food had been too hyped up and that it wouldn't live up to my expectations, but as I edged forward in the line, I could feel my excitement building regardless. I order a lamb sandwich triple-dipped (which ended up only being double... sad), a 70 cent Arnold Palmer, and a slice of apple pie. After wandering a bit to find seats, I proceeded to splatter mustard on my lamb sandwich. This was definitely one of the best parts of the dinner -- call me crazy, but it makes a difference whether you put a little mustard on the sandwich before you take each bite or you open the sandwich and drizzle some onto the bread/meat. Both make for sinus-clearing awesomeness, but I preferred putting some on with each bite. The lamb was flavorful but a little bit dry (until I got to a fatty piece. That made me really happy.) The au jus is amazing and full of meaty goodness. I finished off my one sandwich with the slice of delicious apple pie. It was great -- the apples were still a little crisp, and the crust was just so tender with the right amount of flakiness. (I can't say it's like how Grandma made it because.. well.. I'm pretty sure apple pie is not very commonplace in Vietnam.) Totally worth the drive... and extra trip to the bank for cash.

We went on a weekday evening and the line was short. The counter lady was efficient and nice - the double dipped beef was pretty good. The horseradish mustard can blow your head off. In a good way. The macaroni salad was tasty. But the best thing was the dill pickle. Really crunchy and tangy! I know Phillipe's is an LA institution, and I think for good reason. But is it the best french dip I've had? Not really, but I'd definitely come back.

Went here for second time... and sandwiches are good, but not great... husband says the same... for the wait, and the parking situation... probably won't be back for a third time.

Had the Phillipe's french dip sandwich for the first time last night. Shocking since it's right around the corner from Mayflower Chinese restaurant that we've been going to for ten years. Its a good sandwich and all, their mustard is unique, spicy mustard horseradish thing goin on. Still doesn't hold a candle to Canter's Reuben. Maybe I shouldn't compare the two, anyway, it's a good sandwich, just didn't make me jump out of my seat or anything.

I love coming here for the sandwiches and I don't usually like sandwiches. 蔒y usual is with lamb and blue cheese with a side of cole slaw and an iced tea. 蔇elicious! 蔐ines can be long and parking is tough during lunch, but the prices are cheap! 蔆heck out the candy store at the exit to reminisce of old favorites.

Ok, first question. I thought it was pretty standard to get a cup of au jous with your sandwich. Am I wrong? It's cool that they'll dip your sandwich again if you want it, but c'mon. Can't I get a cup and dip it myself? Very delicious turkey sandwich, but I wanted some fries and they don't offer those on the menu. Awesome spicy mustard sauce and very good potato salad.

I was so excited to try this place....seen it on the travel chanel for one of the best french dipped sandwhich places and ugh...boy oh boy travel chanel how you have let me down. I got the beef dip...nothing special...at all....a few friends got the pork dip, one got the beef double dip...we all thought this place was just ok....didnt enjoy it enough to come back. This place is part of LAs ongoing history, which is cool I guess but....was really let down...blah.

3.5 stars. A couple of friends headed on over to get a bite of history at Philippe's after a long afternoon trekking downtown for a law school project of mine. I love everything about the feel of Philippe's. The old school cafeteria service on paper plates on plastic trays, the very kind elderly "Leave it to Beaver" looking cafeteria ladies in their old-fashioned cafeteria-lady outfits that haven't changed at all from the looks of the black-and-whites on the back wall, the cute elderly people who come with all of their friends and somehow all get the beef stew and laugh over good conversation, the five or six telephone booths on the side walls, the ridiculous amount of space it has both upstairs and downstairs, that gives you an idea of precisely how many people must have frequented this place back in the day, the candy counter selling old school candy like Bit O' Honey and Rocky Road in the back, their delicious signature mustard, and the 9-cent coffee. Open since 1908. 100 years old. If you live in Los Angeles and you haven't been, you're really missing out on something fantastic in terms of an experience. The food itself isn't phenomenal. I'm a vegetarian, so it was majorly terrible. I got a cheese sandwich, in which the cheese was not melted. It was basically a soft roll with slices of cold American cheese in it. Despite the coldness of the sandwich, the mustard saved the day. Philippe's spicy mustard is phenomenal. That horseradish really does it. And for $3.50 you can take a jar home! 蔍 also had a side of potato salad, which was odd. The potatoes were mashed into oblivion, and there was relish folded into it. I love potato salad, more than life, and I really didn't know how to feel about this. I just kept mixing in their delicious mustard to mask that sweet-tart pickle-flavor. My friends, the meatitarians, had what Philippe's is famous for, their french-dipped subs. Please note, that they are "french-dipped" (past tense) and not "french-dip" (to be dipped) subs. Despite being a vegetarian, I have come across many a french dip sub with my meat lovin' companions, and have never seen a pre-dipped sub. Hence my confusion, when I saw a somewhat frumpy sandwich (because of the sogginess) on a cafeteria tray. It took me a minute to connect the "dipped" to the past tense. Despite frumpiness, however, apparently, the sandwiches were good. One of my friends had a classic beef french-dipped sub, while the other had a lamb french-dipped sub. The verdict? Good. The beef was more tender, although the lamb was better flavored. The purchaser of the lamb, also enjoyed that the meat was freshly shaved off of a leg of lamb and inserted directly into her sandwich. We finished off our meal with some 70-cent lemonades and a slice of banana cream pie. Plus for the pie, it had chunks of real banana in the custard portion, and the custard was well, very custardy. Minus for the pie, the whipped cream on top tasted vaguely of candle wax. Candle wax cream. So bad, but so good because it was so bad and we were surrounded by cute old people who obviously thought this place was the bees knees. A huge high five to Philippe's though, because it's incredibly cheap. My meal pre-banana cream pie and with lemonade was $5.14. My friends' sandwiches were $5-$6 dollars. The banana cream pie was a whoppin' $3.25. And you already heard how cheap the coffee and the lemonades were. The ridiculously cheap prices, plus the absolute blast to the past this joint is, the clear love that goes into this establishment that's kept it 100 years strong, and the lines of cute old people who've probably been coming here since they were teenagers makes Philippe's a place I'll definitely come back to on a cloudy day, even if I have to resort to a cold cheese sandwich and that candle wax cream pie. That mustard will save my palate; and the history around me will feed my mind, if not my stomach.

Have you ever had the opportunity to take the Metrolink to Oceanside from Union Station? It's a beautiful train ride with many beach stops and I highly recommend that you experience the jaunt. As for planning, make sure you give yourself enough time to have breakfast at "Philippe the Original Restaurant". Not so much for the food (which was great), but merely to experience a part of Los Angeles history. It's the birthplace of the french dipped sandwich, located just one block north of Union Station. Philippe's has been around since 1908, so I think it has passed the test of time.

Oh DANG, this place is tasty! Granted, the insane lines are somewhat intimidating, but once you get your food (for oh, so cheap!), the good times... oh, how they begin. I got the beef sandwich with blue cheese. It was DELISH. Crusty warm bread cradling juicy tender beef with just the right amount of blue cheese = happiness on a paper plate! I'm automatically suspicious of french dip type sandwiches- I have issues with soggy bread- but this place definitely did not disappoint! Plus, it gets major points for being a block away from Union Station. I was told that the place used to be a brothel and the second floor is haunted, but alas... no ghost prostitute sighting with my sammich. Maybe next time!

Ladies and gentlemen, brace yourself for sandwichy goodness. This place has been around for an amazing 100 years, which makes Philippe's the Godfather of all sandwich joints. But don't expect a murderous rampage as the kind ladies baptize your sandwich in heavenly au jus sauce (ask for double dipped!) All you'll be left with is a smile of satisfaction. Thirsty? Try a lemonade for 60 cents. Now that's an offer you can't refuse.

Another place that translates from childhood to adulthood. The first thing you'll notice when you walk in is the sawdust on the floor. You'll ask 蕐ourself, or whoever you're with, "why?". I don't know why, people must spill alot of crap, I don't know. You then might ask yourself, because at this point you're too shy to follow up with another question, "do they sweep it all up at the end of the day?". Again, I don't know. Whatever. Pick a line and keep your fingers crossed, some lines move quicker than others. My advice to everyone, know what you're ordering before you get to the front. Because when you finally do get to the front, and stumble through an order, everyone behind you will hiss, trust me, I do it too. This place can get crowded, especially since Huell Howser introduced it to all of LA's older timer transplants, which means you may be forced to hang your coat up in a booth way back in the train room. It's not a reflection on the room itself, it's fine, but it's a LONNNNGGGG walk when you've got a tray full of food and drinks! Another thing I like to do when I go with one or more people, is each take a line, and go with whoever gets to the front first ;) This place has got some history, and you can tell. There are things in there that give you some clues as to how old and historic it really is. The phone booths are super cool. The candy stand at the bottom entrance is fun to look at. And one question I've always had is, has anyone ever weighed themselves on the weigh station next to the phone booths? Be forewarned, this place gets super-crowded after church, before Dodger games and before USC football games. DO: Eat a French Dip sandwich (I like to order a double dip pork w/American cheese). Eat straight bowl of chili. Order 2 glasses of lemonade or iced-tea (the glasses are small..but cheap) Tip your carver (the lady serving you) DON'T: Take your time ordering Hold up the line for whatever reason Take up more table space than you need Eat the pickled eggs, yuck (acquired taste I suppose) Put too much spicy mustard on your sandwich (unless you can handle that sort of power!)

D.E.L.I.C.I.O.U.S. french dip sandwiches. So my friends and I were around Union Station / Chinatown and one of them suggested Philppe's for us to go to lunch at. She said that they had amazing french dip sandwiches.. and that's where the apprehension began. I've always had french dip sandwiches that are SO soggy and sick, and I just felt worried Philippe's might be the same. Not the case with Philippe's. My friends and I walked in Sunday a little before the lunch rush, around 12:30ish. I thought it would be relatively empty, but it was CROWDED. 蔒y friend who had been here a lot told me she had seen much worse. But if there's a big crowd, you know the food will be good. One issue. The lines.. they are nonexistent. You basically see a swarm of people standing up trying to form their own lines. I think at one point there was two lines for one person behind the counter. This I did not like. �5 points off. The lady behind the counter. I could tell she had worked there forever. Something about this restaurant really got to me. (in a good way) The people working there all seemed so happy to serve and to be doing their jobs. A weird observation, but I really liked it. Order? I got the turkey sandwich with a side of Chicken Tortilla soup. One of my friends got the pork sandwich, and the other a slice of the coconut cream pie (that one already at ate some Bao in chinatown and was full.. strangely also the friend who totally recommended the place to us) ALL of us got the 75 cent lemonades (highly recommend everything everyone purchased here) Delish. So we went and sat in the room that was at the back of the first floor. It had a ton of windows and was really bright, so it is obvious why we would sit there. This area is like right next to the stairs that lead to the 2nd floor. Wait.. i titled this part delish. I SHOULD BE TALKING ABOUT THE FOOD. Okay. The food. Well, I was really worried. Not going to lie. I set down my tray, and immediately ran to the bathroom (which was pretty tough to get to because it was on the whole other side of the restaurant and you literally need to PUSH through so many people) SO I LEFT MY SANDWICH UNTOUCHED FOR A GOOD 5 MINUTES. When I came back, I was ready to bite into mushy bread and soaked turkey. 蔍nstead, I bit into something that was really out of this world. The flavor of the turkey with the sauce and the bread. It was all just amazing. I think I finished the sandwich in 1 minute. maybe less.. 蔍t was pretty salty though. 蔍 felt like I needed like 20 of those 75 cent lemonades to wash it all down. BUT on the topic of lemonades, though this wasn't freshly squeezed or anything, it was SOO refreshing and amazing. Pretty small though.. and also had quite a bit of ice in it. Really great though. 蔜he chicken tortilla was just ok.. I would stick to the sandwiches here though. My friend loved her pork sandwich, and though I did not try the coconut cream pie, both my friends said it was really good. .5 off for the average chicken tortilla soup / overall salty-ness For me, Phillipe's is more than the food. It's the experience. It's the atmosphere. It's the people who come in here and all order the same amazing sandwiches. I love this place, and would totally come back.

that spicy mustard kicked my ass!!!! my friend got all excited about it so i squeezed a good dollop of it onto my plate, dipped my sandwich in (roast beef and swiss, thankyouverymuch), took an eager bite and WHOOSH a rush of horseradish heat flew into my sinuses and flared out my nostrils!!! ouch!! love that bread though...how delicately soft yet slightly crunchy on the outside, all at the same time. we also delighted in some mac salad, the pucker-up yummy pickles, and a nice slice of peach pie (crust was good but the canned peach filling was a little disappointing). we happened to go on the day they were filming "man vs food" ... check for the two asian girls in the crowd! the host made the comment that "not every place has a challenge". we were so tempted to tap him on the shoulder and remind him of the magic that is the orochon special #2 challenge. thank goodness all that lovin' didn't leave me nearly as uncomfortably full as last night's did (read: tasca).

Just finished watching the Dodgers spank the Giants ass, said to wife lets try Philippe Original French dip see what all the 5 stars are about!!!! We arrived to see about a 20 minute wait in line no biggie, wait here or stop and go on the 5 freeway for an hour? No brainer we're eating. For the amount of people the line moved very fast, the ladies behind the counter bust their ass and get your food quickly. We split a French dip, a turkey dip sandwich & lemonades all for around twenty dollars with tip great deal. The sandwich was as advertised very good nice portion size the spicy mustard on the table is awesome, next time we will order sides they looked good. I don't belive Philippe is five stars but a must try and a very good experience.

The sandwiches are a bit small if you're a hearty eater so I suggest buying a couple and pair that up with the lemonade. 蔖robably multiple lemonades if you use the mustard. 蔙eally packed at lunch but worth the wait.

The meat is not always cooked perfectly, but either way, you're leaving there happily full! :) Personally, I prefer the lamb and the pork dip... and I spread a very slight hint of the mustard! I go here when I'm in the "I'm so hungry I can eat a cow" mood! The lines are intimidating at first, but here's a trick: stand there and look at all the lines, and see which one is the shortest! It's seems so obvious, but most people still just go to the nearest line, which is the one by each door! There's also lines in the middle! ;) Cute decor, and very historic! And their coleslaw is my personal favorite, tied with Bandera's coleslaw on the West Side! It's THAT good.

Probably the worst French dip I've ever had. The jus lacked the glossy grease surface all others have, which makes me very skeptical about how they make it (looked canned/processed). The meat was dry and the bread was boring to say the least. I can't believe so many people like this place. Angelinos must be really caught up in the hype; either that or they just don't know the difference. Sigh. Stick to burritos, L.A.

I hadn't heard of Philippe's since I'm not around LA but my boyfriend took me in the middle of the afternoon on our way to Little Tokyo. It was pretty intimidating at first because there was no organized line so we just stood around wondering how to order. We got a beef and turkey sandwich both with jack cheese, macaroni & potato salad, and a cup of chili. All for less than $20! The macaroni and potato salad were only $1.05! Overall, I thought it was good. The meat was tender and juicy, the chili was delish, and can't complain about the salads. The horseradish/mustard was spicy but it was still good. 蔜he restaurant itself is interesting and has a lot of character with old newspaper clippings and photos so there's a lot to look at. We came at aroud 3:30 - 4:00 in the afternoon and it was still packed. I know a lot of people think it's overrated but I went in with no expectations and I was impressed.

This place makes a solid french dip. I like to keep it classic and get the roast beef with swiss and a side of pickles. They have excellent pickles, better than a lot of faux New York delis i've been to in LA. The lemonade is a little watered down but I feel that these various shortcomings lend this place its charm, besides its cheap so shut up if you don't agree. Also, the pies and tapioca pudding make for delicious times.

So, I get it that there's like a million reviews for this place already, but I still want to add my $0.02 because I guess I don't agree with the majority. Some friends mentioned this place last night when we were all out drinking in DT LA. We spent the night at the Omni, and this morning, after much deliberation, we finally decided to go here to see what the hype was all about. The place has a barn-like look to it, what with wood shavings on the floor and food-hall-style bench seating. My first thought was, "this is interesting, now let's check out the prices." Well, the sandwiches themselves are almost $6, cheese not included. Now this is just bread and your choice of meat (pork, ham, beef, lamb, turkey), so I thought the pricing was a bit steep. I also got a lemonade, and it was served in a tiny 8oz glass. We don't even have glasses this small at home. In addition, service is waaay slow for a place that's this popular. The meat was tasty. I got beef and my other friends got pork. I hijacked my friend's pork one and it was better than the beef one, although the sandwich itself would benefit from better quality bread, to make it worth the price. Also, the fact that they don't accept credit and/or debit is a hassle. All in all, it's good but not great; overrated and over priced.

The cost of a plain venti at Starbucks, will get you 33 of Phillipe the Original's 9-cent cups of coffee--with nary a tip jar in sight, and that's not the only throwback. Supposedly the place where the French Dip sandwich was invented (after French immigrant Phillipe Matieu dropped a sandwich in meat juices), the cafeteria-style Phillipe packs 'em in at lunchtime, with hungry chattering diners forming lines at the 10 serving stations that span a counter seemingly as long as a football field. A must-have is the roast beef French dip paired with 60-cent lemonade. The more daring might match it with a serving of pig's feet (300 pounds are served per week at Phillipe.) Non hoof-eaters might try the fabulous selections of pie or the delectable brownies, or possibly pay a visit to the old-fashioned candy counter where select cavity-inducers are available for less than a dime.

Both Philippe the Original and Cole's Pacific Electic Buffet claim to have invented the French Dip sandwich, and I guess I don't blame them for fighting over it: it's a delicious treat! 蔖hilippe offers a number of different sandwiches, including turkey, pork, cheese, and, of course, roast beef. 蔣ou've gotta try the classic once, but my preference is the turkey French Dip sandwich. 蔠ith cheese. 蔣ou've gotta have cheese with it. Anyway, Phillipe is a must see experience in LA. 蔄t lunch on weekdays, the lines are insanely long, filled with a wide variety of clientele, though mostly politicians, lawyers, and businessmen from the Civic Center area. 蔄nd although there are some places where the lines move quickly (see, e.g., Mendocino Farms at the Water Court), they move VERY SLOWLY at Philippe. 蔍 suppose it is pretty amazing that they make your food right as you order it, though, so there's no additional waiting once it's your turn at the front of the line. Ultimately, the food is amazing and the prices are equally great, so when you're eating in one of the self-serve booths, surrounded by sawdust on the floor, you quickly forget about the 20 minutes you just spent in line to get that sandwich. 蔄nd if you're eating in, the lemonade and coffee is so cheap it's basically free, which is a nice bonus.

Best French dipped sandwiches ever. Sometimes this place gets super crowded but the food is worth the wait! Wish the sandwiches were a little bigger though, I'm still hungry after one. Usually get the roast beef, and along with a tiny bit of the mustard, makes my meal a headache-inducing, sinus burning ten minutes of bliss between two soggy pieces of bread. The pickles are a nice addition, and the blueberry pie here is great. The food overall is just excellent and the workers are super friendly, worth the twenty minute drive from home :)

I'm not sure, but they might be the originators of the french dip sandwich. I love this place. The french dip sandwich is great, and if you add their horseradish/mustard sauce, it kicks it up a notch! The ambiance is traditional with sawdust on the floors. It's right next to Union Station. It's been awhile since I've been there, but I still remember how great it was.

I heart Phillippe's.. having recent re-discovered it while some friends where in town from the UK. Chowing down on a pork french dipped sandwich, drinking 10 cent coffee on bench seats with sawdust at my feet is my new happy place.

i had heard great things about this place so i decided to check it out. when we entered on saturday around 2pm it wasn't very crowded. we got in line and ordered at the counter. we found seating in a separate dining area. i have to say, the beef dip ($5.75) with american cheese ($0.40 extra) was pretty awesome and the potato salad ($1.15) was also delish. the mustard is a little on the spicy side but i think everyone should at least try it. overall, i loved the food and casual feel of the place and it gets major points for its free parking lot across the street.

I'm addicted to phillippes. I have tried all their sandwiches but the roast beef is my all time favorite. It's always made fresh very day. Their potato salad is amazing cannot find 蔭 better place yet and I've been to a lot of places. Their chilli is ok not anything special. Their pies are awesome but I wish they had strawberry pies. If your ever done in LA you need to try it.

OK lets go back in time say 60-70years. 蔜his place has awesome dipped sandwiches. 蔍ve been here a couple times. 蔜ried the beef, lamb, and pork sandwiches. 蔍 think the best is the pork, then the beef, and then the lamb. 蔜he pork is juicy with those fat chunks that are so tender they melt in your mouth, which most of us have come to love. 蔜he beef is OG. 蔜he lamb is a little gamey. 蔜he chili is great, i got the bowl w/o beans. 蔜he potato salad is good. 蔜he coleslaw is wet, almost like the Pantry's. 蔜he lemonade is cheap but come in small cups. 蔒y knocks on this place is that its not a cheap meal (well its no lee's sandwich) and its cash only. 蔜his is a great place to eat or pick up sandwiches before hitting Chavez Raven for the game, but not after because it will probably be closed. 蔔ext to Olvera St. and you know what that means Mr Churro!

Rating: 3.5 stars I've lived my whole life in LA, but never made it to Philippe until today. I'm so glad I finally did, because this is an utterly charming place to grab a dirt-cheap meal! I guess going during the late afternoon on a Friday is the time to go, because my friends and I did not encounter the massive crowds described by other reviews. Instead we got a trickle of families and senior citizens, who surely have been eating here since their younger days. When we walked up to the counter we were confronted with an array of side dishes and desserts in the refrigerated cases. So many things to choose from! I decided to keep it simple and ordered the classic beef dip and a lemonade. I flirted with the idea of trying the lamb sandwich, because who doesn't love lamb? 蔅ut I figured my first experience should be the one that started it all. The kindly counter lady served me up a funny looking sandwich in a minute on a wooden tray that must be as old as I am. While I was paying the bill (only $6 and change!!) I looked closely at the sorry looking bread and became a bit apprehensive. 蔜his is the famous french dip?? 蔅ut then it dawned on me. 蔜he signs said "french dipped" sandwiches. By gum, they dip the sandwiches for you! So that's what keeps the prices down... Brilliant! After my friends ordered we made a beeline to an empty table and dug into our meals. One of my friends decided to order the lamb sandwich, and we quickly agreed to start an exchange program right there and swapped halves. 蔍 first tried the beef, and was immediately impressed with how tender and juicy it was. 蔜hen I squirted some of the house mustard on my next bite. 蔠hat started as a pretty good sandwich suddenly transformed into a wonder. After the searing pain in my sinuses subsided, I totally fell in love with their hot mustard. It reminds me of a cross between dijon and chinese mustards. SO FRICKEN GOOD! 蔔ext I tried the lamb, and was duly pleased with the flavor. Unfortunately the lamb was a little on the overcooked side and was drier than the beef. So it was a tradeoff between the more flavorful lamb and the juicier beef. Being the pragmatist that I am, I opted to alternate bites from the two halves. Yeah, I'm a genius. I know. Unfortunately the sandwiches were the best thing we ate during the visit. My vegetarian friend ordered a cheese sandwich, and was given a roll with slices of cold american cheese inside. Ummm, that's great for 3rd graders, but not so much for adults. At least a little toasting would've been nice! 蔉ortunately the mustard made it more bearable. 蔜his same friend also ordered the potato salad, and after some deliberation asked us to try it as well. 蔍t was... interesting. I didn't even recognize it as potato salad at first because the consistency looked more like ricotta cheese. But potato it was, and with a whole lot of pickle relish mixed in! The sweet and tart of the relish pretty much dominated the flavor of the salad, and I can't say I'm a fan. So the lesson learned here is that if you take a vegetarian friend here, they're really taking one for the team. After finishing we decided to raid the dessert counter. We were tempted by the lemon meringue, chocolate cream, apple and cherry pies. But we finally settled on splitting a slice of banana cream pie. 蔜wo things we noticed as soon as we sat down: 1) wow, they totally dye the custard yellow; and 2) woah, they like throw in whole bananas in that pie! Cool! We giddily dipped in and then the magic kinda faded. 蔠hile it totally brought us back to what pies were like when we were little kids, we were reminded that our tastes have changed over the years. The flavors were just a little off. The crust is oddly salty, the custard is treacly, and the whipped cream topping has a very odd 'waxy' aftertaste. 蔄fter a few bites I was done. 蔍 realized that I should have ordered a cup of 9 cent coffee to go with dessert to help mellow out the experience. We finally called it a night and decided that we would return here soon. Collectively, are wallets were $20 lighter after all that food (not including the bottle of mustard I bought before leaving. Price: $3.50. Total steal for a bottle of golden joy!) We explored the rest of the restaurant and were enamored with the old fashioned candy and souvenir counter, the phone booths along the wall, and the spacious upstairs dining rooms. There's a good reason why Philippe is celebrating 100 years, and I will definitely return for the dipped sandwiches.

The beef French dips are whatever, but the lamb sandwiches really shine. 蔍 used to go there on a regular basis when I worked in DTLA and went there frequently -can't go wrong with free parking and 10 cent coffees. 蔊otta get the lamb sandwich, beef is just plain, turkey is hit or miss -haven't tried the pork yet.

Update: More recent visits allowed me to try other variations of the French dip sandwich, and my expectations were that these variations would be just as tender and juicy as the pork I initially tried. They were not. And the line can be very slow depending on the "carver" you choose. A full star is lost from the previous rating. On the upside, their smooth soft butter pecan pie is currently my favorite dessert.

Okay so I know I'm not the first person to review Philippe's. 蔅ut I just wanted to throw in my ten cents (which buys me a great cup of coffee there!) on the subject. 蔍 LOVE this place. 蔔early every time I go downtown, I make time to stop at Philippe's and get a beef sandwich and a cup of chili. 蔍 love their sandwiches, I love their chili, I love their desserts, I love the 9 cent coffee and the 75 cent lemonade (or is it 65 cents? 蔍 can never remember). 蔍 love the vintage advertising, the big communal tables and the long lines, the entire post WWII feel of the place. 蔍 keep expecting Roger Rabbit to go bouncing across the counter or a Red Car to rumble by on Alameda. 蔍 love it!

Phillippe's has made an imprint on the food world literally. The home of the French dip satisfies my appetite in every way possible. It really doesn't matter what kind of meat you order for your dip because all of them are juicy and tender. I personally prefer the beef although the lamb is stupendous. The sides are equally just as good. Whether its potato salad, chili beans, 蕂r cole slaw, the more you eat the more you fall in love. Drinks are cheap (45 cents for lemonade and ice tea) and the beer is cold and refreshing. The building is old but in great shape after all these years. The sawdust on the floor is truly a mark of a great deli. Everyone is so into their meal that bits of meat and juice suddenly make its way to the floor and disappear in the sea of sawdust. My usual order consists of a beef sandwich double dipped, potato salad, a slice of delicious apple pie and a glass of lemonade. Use the horseradish at your own risk. The spread will clear your sinuses.

If I take a morning flight to LA, this is my first stop for lunch. �It's incredibly good, it's been there forever, the cross section of people is fascinating, and the services is very good. I find that getting there before noon is a good idea, as the lines are smaller. 蔜his trip, I got there at 11:20 on a Saturday morning, and had no problem parking in the lot across the street, and no line or wait for a table. I find that I need a sandwich and a half, but they don't do that so if I'm alone I just pick up two sandwiches. 蔄lways a lamb, and then something else. 蔜his time, I got the lamb double dippped, and the beef with blue cheese regular dipped. �The lamb sandwich is awesome, and the beef is good but more like a pot roast sandwich. I'm sure the side dishes are good, but with two sandwiches, I have no room.

"Get in the car, we're getting O.G. french dip." "But i'll miss class, there's no way we'll make it back in time..." "Dude, it's Philippe's, screw class." "Oy Vey!" Me, 10th grade. Him 12th. This was very much my initiation to the life of a rebellious art student. I was the good jewish boy who listened to his mother when she told me 'be nice to everyone' and 'study hard'. This lead me to my role as the 12th grade English class Teachers Assistant (TA) 蕎hen I was 15. The teacher adored me and the seniors in the class seemed to like me too, it could have had something to do with the fact I was grading their tests. One guy in particular decided to take me under his wing. Joshua: the stylish visual artist type who held no license for the rules, a notion my fifteen year old self had not quite acquired. It was the John Lennon in him, and John was always my favorite Beatle. So, I went along for the ride. Joshua drove fast 蔭nd liked to watch me squirm and jitter in the passenger seat. During his brief jaunt at my high school, located near downtown, ditching class and hooking up with any younger girl he could get his hands on was his bag. He liked hanging out with me 蕋o impose his superiority, for my innocence and bright disposition could have been easily altered by his elderly wisdom. I had an instinctual feeling that our fast trip to Philippe's would be just as influential as the French Dip itself. Incredible sandwich btw. 'Original' as they say and when you walk in you feel like you've returned to the early parts of the 20th century. I dig it. 蔐A Landmark? without ? Never been? you must rock it before you decease! So what happened? We got back in the nick of time! Since Joshua drove so fast and we scarfed down our sandwich's, I was able to stroll into class �full of youngin's my own age) undaunted. No one had an inkling I was miles away from campus minutes ago. I must have thought to myself, "Ah, so now I can get away with being rebellious and still give off the illusion of being the good-boyo, cool!" oh foreshadowing...

Philippe's, The Pantry, and Cole's PE Buffet remain the very last of the 1920's dive restaurants. Philippe's claims to be the home of the French Dip sandwich, and though others profess the same few do it as well and with such old-school panache. This is the place to lunch when touring downtown, Union Station, and the parts of L.A. considered "old". Coffee costs $0.10 and there used to be a sign left over from the '70's apologizing for the hike during the coffee embargo. Philippe's is a place that clings tenaciously to its brief history, a desperate plea to be remembered in a city that worships the young and beautiful and erases its sawdust floored past.

I was in Arcadia visiting my boyfriend and he suggested going to this place. I decided to look up some reviews and it really got me excited to eat there. When we got there the lines were long, just like one would expect at a well known place during the weekend. When I got to the front to place my order the server seemed like she hated her job. I ordered two drinks without ice, a french dip (beef), cream of broccoli soup, and a slice of chocolate cake. She actually cut me off before I was able to order the cake and when I asked for a slice she huffed like I was putting her out. When she put the drinks on the tray they both had ice. I mentioned it to her that I asked for them without and she gave me a dirty look and proceeded to turn to a co-worker and say something in Spanish, in turn making her look at me and give me a dirty look. After a few minutes my food arrived, and although I knew from reading the reviews that they came pre-dipped with au jus mine looked totally dry. When I asked her if she could dip it again she did, but in a begrudging manor. The worst part of this experience though is that I never received my chocolate cake, even though I paid for it, and forgot until after I was already on my way home. The workers there are grumpy, uncaring, rushed, and rude. I wasn't expecting much, but I was expecting better than this. I doubt I'll ever go back. As for the food itself... it was tasty, but something I could have gotten anywhere else. Best of luck to those of you who go.

The service is good but you may end up with people in front of you who do not know how to order. The original french dip is awesome, you just can't beat it. it's not soggy the bread is crispy and juicy from being dipped the beef is amazing and rich. The banana cream was great. They know the secret, pile the whipped cream high. The New England clam chowder was tasty if a little thin. I like my chowder a little thicker. The pork is good but you cannot go wrong with the beef.

Well, I am now the 176th reviewer of this place. And like everyone else, I give this place praises. This was my first trip here. I've been hearing about this place since I moved down to the L.A. area two years ago. People at work raved as well as friends. I finally had a chance to try this place a few nights back. My reason for eating here? A musical show at the Ahmanson. So, time was of the essence to get ourselves to a show on time. The crowd inside the restaurant was sufficiently spread out, so there were many booths and tables to choose from with many empties abundant. This was nice because I had heard plenty of horror stories of how crowded this place can get. But I guess that's more of a lunchtime thing. The first thing I noticed was a line backing up the stairs we had just walked through. I kept hearing in my ear, "Go to the right, go to the right." I understood why. Everyone was crowded on the left. So we vied for our spot at the counter on the right. We split up to make things easy for ordering and finding a seat. My order was predestined here. It was the beef dip with lemonade or nothing else. Although the pork and lamb dips sounded yummy, and I tried to convince my friend to get me one, he insisted that the beef was the way to go. So, I left the order in his hands to acquire a table for us. About five minutes later, here he comes with a tray full of beef dipped sandwiches, lemonade, and a plate of coleslaw (that was for me). I have to give my friend props for ordering the beef dip. It was definitely yummy. The one thing I really liked about my sandwich was that it was simple. Just a slight dip on the top slice of bread with the meat (not piled too high). It was a manageable sandwich that filled one's tummy pleasantly. I even tried the spicy mustard on the table for half of the sandwich. It was like hot mustard but with something else mixed-in. I couldn't quite figure out what gave it that reddish tint. But it was good for what I had of it. The coleslaw was very crisp, cold, and fresh. I'm not a big fan of coleslaw, but do enjoy it when the dressing is a bit on the vinegary side like this. I'm not a fan of too much mayo in the coleslaw, so this was absolutely perfect. :) I even began having visions of adding coleslaw to my sandwich. I thought that sounded like a good combo to try on another visit. I'm so glad I've now had a chance to experience Philippe's. The slightly sawdust strewn floor wasn't how I imagined it from the descriptions I got from the people at work. For some reason, I thought it was be a bit thicker in covering the floor. The saw dust sort of adds a rustic quality to the place making you feel like you don't have to worry about spilling things on the floor. Very casual sort of place. A no frills, no muss place. Definitely my kind of eatery.

Upon walking into Philippe's I did a preliminary cost/benefit analysis of waiting in the incredibly long line vs. potentially eating what had been sold to me as "THEE BEST FRENCH DIP. EVER.," and I'm glad I decided the benefits outweighed the costs, because it seriously turned out to be THEE. BEST. FRENCH. DIP. EVER. We went right before a Dodger game, which made the day that much more fun, and even though we were like the ninetieth people in line, it moved really fast, and you get your food right away. I don't really like asking a stranger if he can scootch so I can basically sit in his lap while I eat, but it's worth it. Especially if he's a cute stranger.

What can I say that hasn't already been mumbled incoherently by millions of beef and au jus-addled patrons of this establishment. The mustard is legendary, the jus thick and flavorful, the coffee cheap. Big ups for selling cheap wine as well. A telling sign of greatness: I went to a training session a while ago to work at a local restaurant. We did an icebreaker where all of us (around 150) had to say what our favorite food was. About fifteen people said their favorite food was the beef dip sandwich at Phillipe's. Two said the lamb sandwich. The macaroni salad is also quite tasty.

I've said it before and I'll say it again I love sandwiches, anything with bread actually. So when my roommate said he was gonna take me to LA's oldest sandwich place on the way to the Dodger game, I was instantly excited. So flash forward to the sandwiches, I got a roast beef, and a lamb, both of which were delicious, the horseradish sauce on the tables was spicy and sinus clearing, just the way it should be. The bread was perfect for the au jus. I may go back to another Dodger game (I'm a giants fan) just to get the sandwich before the game.

Yum! 蔊ot a double dipped beef sandwich, coleslaw, pickle and lemonade. 蔖rice was decent (2 of us paid just under $20), the sandwich was fantastic, and coleslaw was, well, coleslaw. 蔜he lines were long and the ladies behind the counter were not fantastically friendly, but it was worth the wait. 蔒y belly was happy and full.

Heard great things about this place. I hate going into a place with high expectations, because it'll never meet up to them. Unfortunately, this was one of those times. I mean, it was good. But that's it. This is supposed to be the mecca of French Dipitude! And it was....meh. The bread was great. That was the only positive thing that stood out. The long line and 20 min wait stood out to me as well. You don't get to dip it yourself either! What's that all about? They just splash the au jus on the bread and then hand you a soggy sandwich. Which is...fine. It still tasted...fine. But that's it. Lack of meat, lack of dipping action, long line represents the not so good qualities. Good prices and delicious bread, save this french dip pioneer.

I just went here 4 or 5 months ago after seeing it on man vs food. I have lived in Los Angeles for a long time and never knew about this place.I decides to go with my girl friend one day. We both order the same thing a roast beef sandwich with potato salad.The sandwich tasted good but the potato salad is what set it a part from other places. It was great one of the best I have had.One thing is they need to hire some better staff.This place is packed. The cashier making the orders was really slow and talked a lot. She needs to do her job their were a lot of hungry people in line including me.She needs to do less chit chat and with customers and more order fulling instead.

For Yelpers, This place is a MUST TRY just because how much fame it gets on yelp and a LA landmark. However, i don't see myself coming back here in the near future (and late future unless a friend/family wants to try it since its a famous joint). Sandwiches are alright and nothing extraordinary about it like it looks like featured in alot of shows. For the sandwiches we tried the lamb and beef 蔮oth with swiss and got one double dipped and the other one single dipped. both meats were dry and not as moist as people are saying and i dont think it was bad timing because 蕎e went around 6pm with over 80 ppl in line it was not even old leftover dinner or lunch meat(if i do ever come back ill try it soaked like people are recommending) It did not hit home with me AND this was on an empty stomach. Pies are overrated there and tbh the best thing was the thick chili. also i found it sad that they dont give you a side of the sauce to dip the sandwich in. Lastly, i think people go here not because it is good but a landmark. If you ate the sandwich blindfolded and go to any main chain restaurant with a french dip - i do not think people could tell the difference. PS: thanks for wasting my time on an empty stomach for 35 min waiting in line for a subpar sandwich :O(

I saw this place featured on the food network so when we were in LA I was dying to try it. The TV show made it look so good! I got a beef sandwich single dipped, and the wife got a lamb sandwich double and triple dipped. The best things were the cole slaw and potato salad. The sandwiches were ok, but nothing special. Mine was dry and needed a double dip. The portions were small and I was hungry 30 蕀inutes after eating. Overall, I have had better french dip. So once again the hype is greater than the actual quality. BTW, we sat next to an older woman and we struck up a conversation. We told her that we were here because of the TV exposure, and she said that the place has gone downhill ever since it was on TV.

French dip was just alright. I got the beef with swiss for 5.75 and the meat was DRY, perhaps I should try the double dip if I ever decide to go back. Potato salad was very delicious for 1.50, cole slaw was ok for 1.50, and the new england clam chowder was alright too for 3.00 in a cup. Their lemonade was delicious and it was 75 cents and their iced tea was very flavorful too for 60 cents. I like how the place was cheap but hmm, I'm starting to think I came on an off day, even though the lines were massive at 1:30pm! 2 days later I had Arbys and it was a lot more satisfying than Phillipes... weird? I dont know, based on this visit, I'm giving it 3 whole stars and an A-ok!

Yet another great LA institution. 蔍f you are craving a great french dip sandwich, this is the place. 蔉rench Dip lovers be forewarned, Philippe's dips the french bread in aujus and does not serve it on the side. 蔍've never asked for the aujus on the side for the many years I've been coming here, for fear that the women who work the counter may be French Dip Nazis (sorry to offend, if that's unPC to say). You stand in lines to get to the counter to place your order. 蔜he women who take your order and collect the money at the counter look like they've been working there for years and they've been in a time warp. I love the traditional beef french dip sandwiches. 蔅e sure to order a dill pickle too to go with the dip. �The french rolls are fresh and crusty. 蔜hey dip the rolls in ajus rather than serving the aujus on the side. 蔍f you prefer the aujus on the side, this place won't be for you. 蔍 always prefer the aujus on the side for my french dip, but for Philippe's I make this one exception. If you like things spicy, be sure to spread the spicy hot mustard on your sandwich. 蔅ut be sure to use the spicy mustard sparingly, since a little will clear your nostrils! 蔍t's a great taste if you like spicy horseradish style mustard 蔒y mouth is watering and stomach growling for a Philippe's french dip sandwich as I write this review! The seating is long tables which you sit with our diners. I've been going to Philippe's for years when I was little boy with the family. 蔒y Dad was a true foodie at heart. 蔋e'd take the family all over LA and Orange County to try out great culinary tastes. 蔛o I take after my Dad big time. 蔋e'd be proud that I made Yelp Elite! 蔍 crown my Dad honorary posthumous Yelp Elite status! I need to share this found memory with Dad, back in 1988 I ran my first LA Marathon. 蔜he family came to watch and support me. 蔄fter my victorious finish for a first time marathoner, at a time of 4 hrs 22 min., Dad took the family to Philippe's for a congratulatory meal. 蔍 chowed down 2 beef dip and 1 pork dip, with 2 pickles, 2 bags of chips, and a side of cole slaw! 蔜hanks, Dad! Be sure to make a stop at the candy section before you leave. 蔜hey have some classic candies from the old days....like Abba Zabbas, Big Hunks, Neccos.

a gem in Chinatown. this place is so classic and homey. it's like a step back in time. an old couple was there. they were all dressed up and looked like it was their weekly ritual to come in and have a sandwich. love the old world feel! the place is bustling! waits can be long but well worth it. i only tried the beef sandwich but the meat was so juicy and tender. the bread was indeed soggy but still very tasty. lemonade is good and only $0.75! even though there is a parking lot, you'll have to wait for a spot and navigate the maze.

I was flipping through an old tourist book of Los Angeles that I had bought when I first moved out here and saw a reference to Philippe and immediately drove to it. I tried the beef (good), lamb (good) and pork (ok) sandwiches, as well as the macoroni salad (horrible). The food is decent if you are a big meat eater and the prices can't be beat. I'm used to dipping my sandwich into a large bowl of au jus but at this place you have to ask for them to dip it for you which was kind of annoying (I would recommend a double dip). Philippe is a little out of the way in Chinatown so I don't know if I would drive back there again although if it was in my neighborhood I would definitely go there for lunch weekly.

I almost feel bad for not liking Phillippe as much as I feel like I should. I've always heard such great things about this place but I'm sorry I'm not a huge fan. I was so excited because my friends had bought the Phillippe hot mustard in a jar and I loved it when I put it on their butter burgers (Yes, I did say butter burgers: a tablespoon of butter inside each slider patty). For some reason, the hot mustard made my nose feel like it was going on flames! Our table looked ridiculous fanning our noses and eyes going all watery. We're such n00bs. We put way too much mustard on the sandwich. 蔍t probably would have tasted better without so much mustard. But you know what, $5.55 for a beef dip is not a bad deal. I would come here if my friends wanted to go and I was around the neighborhood. I'm so glad I didn't have to wait in line because my review probably would have ended up a 2!

I have been here about five times, and every time I end up asking myself. Why!! do I keep coming back! Then In remember, its tradition. Sorry, you can get a much better sandwich at other places. I am not saying this place is awful, but it's not great either. It's just an OK sandwich, in a crowded area sitting on stools, and can't wait to get out. I keep on telling myself there is no reason to come back. But next time in town I will probably come back! Why! TRADITION!!!!

Landmark and a must-try for anyone living in or visiting LA. Yea the lines are ridiculous, but it is a fun experience. The ladies behind the counter work so fast so they knock out the sandwiches and orders like true pros. They are known for the beef dip but any of their sandwiches will be good. Crowd fave is lamb with bleu. I like the turkey with American just so that I can eat the whole thing and feel a notch less guilty. Love their macaroni salad and potato salads too, and I always have to get a scoop of one of them with my sandwich. Get it double-dipped if you want it wetter. Their wines are cheap, and they have a decent list too. Lemonade, iced tea and coffee are also cheap. Be careful putting on their hot mustard. It's essential to the sandwich but be prepared to get that wasabi-burn at some point. It'll creep up your nose and make you shed a tear. So good. I like their old school ways and hope yet never change a thing.

Eh... super cool for the nostalgia and the enviorment that it is in but as far as beef dips go there are far too many better places to go for great beef dips, don't get me wrong they are not bad here they just are not that great. There are a number of places that are in LA that make phenomenal beef dips that I would kill for, but this is not one of them. For any tourist this is a great spot as it is classic LA, but the hype out lives the flavor and quality of the food unfortunately. I tend to think that the double dip with lamb and blue cheese is probably one of the best combinations possible, don't forget to load up on the mustard (caution it has a kick for those that are not use to real mustard!) this is one thing that is absolutely amazing, and I do come back for.

The dip is reallyyyy good, but the meat is kinda dry and tasteless, maybe next time I'll try the double dip. The bread is really good because it's soft and match perfectly with the beef and also the dip. The other thing that I like is the potato salad, it's different that other ones that I have ever eaten. Well, I will surely come back to try the double dipped sandwich!

this place is NO DOUBT a Los Angeles institution, a historical landmark even. 蔵 also respect the management greatly for the loyalty they have shown their employees, and it should be noted that they are one of VERY FEW Los Angeles dining establishments that have allowed their workers to unionize and offer them medical benefits. so, that said... 蔵'm not really a huge fan of this place. 蕋he sandwiches are okay, but nothing they have here even approaches the #19 Pastrami Sandwich at Langers... not. even. close. you will get a decent sandwich at a very good price, but a visit to Philippe's will be more of a novelty dining excursion than a true culinary experience. �of all of their offerings my favorite is a single-dip lamb sandwich with their signature hot mustard (which, by the way, i suggest you get to take home for just $3.50 a jar). 蕋he lamb is of the highest quality and slow roasted and sliced to order right off the bone like an old fashion carvery. 蕋he lamb here retains the signature gaminess that lamb should have, which is a welcomed change from the variety of lamb that most restaurants opt for these days, lamb that has had nearly all of its unique lamb flavor bred out of it in order to not offend the unadventurous palates of most LA diners (if i want something that tastes like beef i'll order beef. 蔵f i order lamb i want it to taste like LAMB, damnit...) basically, you will get a good (not great) sandwich here, but i believe that everyone should go to Philippe's at least once. 蔭lso, it is a nice place to take friends and family that are visiting from out of town so that they can get a chance to experience such an important part of LA restaurant history. 蕐ou'll have a fun, unique dining experience and you won't pay an arm and a leg. 2 stars for the food... add one star for the atmosphere, the history, and the great hot mustard that you can take home with you... 3 stars.

The food was decent, but I didn't understand the crowds. 蔍 was really expecting something, since the packed house and since it took me over 30 mins to find parking in their parking lot.

Also, their sides look like they just poured a large tub of mayo on something like potatoes or pasta and called it a side.

four stars for the tasty beef sandwich (double dipped of course), cheap prices, and generous offerings of potato salad (i asked for a cup to go and they gave me that AND a dish to eat there!) and beet salad. it's a no frills kind of place and on a sunday night the waits aren't too unbearable. the beef sandwich is far superior purely because of the thin slices of meat; the lamb chunks are thicker cut and thus harder to sink your teeth into. oh, and the mustard is nasal-passage clearing hot (and delicious!). i really wish i bought a bottle to bring home... yum yum yum!

Phillipe's is considered as the birthplace of the French Dip. 蔜hey have beef dip and lamb dipped sandwiches as well as a bevy of other deli-like items, and of course home-made desserts. 蔈xpect a long wait up to 2 hours on weekends. 蔄s you walk in, it is as if the place is frozen in time with sawdust on the floor and communal benches for eating. 蔜he sandwiches here are not bad - but clearly overrated. 蔜he hot mustard sauce that pervades all throughout the restaurant has a very strong horseradish kick that 蕀akes you feel like you pushed your finger too far up your nose. 蔍 ask for my sandwiches double dipped so that it is extra moist. 蔈ven then the meat is a bit dry and tougher than I expected. 蔄s I took my first bite, the first thing that comes to mind is that I have had better, and then I start questioning why I forgot that important fact the last time I came here. 蔍 would think that it would be more worthwhile if the wait was not so long. 蔍 find myself cringing every time someone suggests we go eat there because of all the hype. 蔄 highlight of coming here is that you can have a taco or two across the street on Olvera street to quell your hunger pangs while you wait in line here. Best Thing - French Dip

Really good sandwiches. I tried the roast beef and the pork. I prefer the roast beef as it had a lot more flavor and was nice and juicy. The hot mustard they have is very strong too but a pretty good mix with the sandwiches. I also had the mac salad and the cream of spinach soup. I've had better mac salad and the cream of spinach was okay too. Only bad thing about this place is they take cash only. I guess it moves the lines faster but a big inconvenience if you don't have cash. They do have ATM machines though if you don't mind paying the $2.00 fee to take out some cash.

I like the famous French dip sandwiches, but I don't LOVE it. 蔍 will always willingly go though because I don't live around the area.

I wasn't surprised to see over 700 reviews on this gem. Hands-down best French Dip.......okay, I'm gonna be honest, it was my FIRST French Dip. Now that the bar has been set so high, I fear having any other French Dip sandwich because I will surely be disappointed. Then the coleslaw was freakin' awesome. Not sure what made it so special but I couldn't get enough. 蔄s if we hadn't eaten enough already, we had to end our meal with the banana cream pie. PEOPLE!!! This pie is one of a kind.

Pick your meat of choice (I am still on a Nov. turkey kick) get some pickles, pickled eggs, pile it on the sandwich, squeeze on some hot mustard (careful, this is the kind that gets right up your nose) and wash it all down with lemonade, or another fizzy beverage of choice. The atmosphere, especially on a game day is buzzing. What an LA treat that natives and tourists should equally enjoy!

I ate here this past weekend. I purchased a pork sandwich with blue cheese and it was double dipped in dipping sauce and i put mustard on it that was spicy and then i ate it and it was good to eat. They were filming Man vs Food but i doubt they film it there everyday but if they do then thats bad because the host is a huge douche. I also had chili with beans.

I love this place. Cafeteria feel, the uniforms, good food for a fair price. Worth waiting a little in line. Try the lamb. 1 of 2 restaurants in downtown L.A. that claim to have invented the French Dip.....I'd like to say its this place.

was not impressed with the french dip sandwiches here. 蕋he sandwich is too soggy for me. we got both the lamb and the beef, and while i didn't care for either of them i'd say the lamb is better than the beef. had a bite of my friends chili and found it quite tasty! if i went back, i'd probably only get the chili.

4 Stars I've NEVER.....EVER liked french dip sandwiches......................until today. Had this place bookmarked for a while, so we stopped by on the way home from San Diego. The set-up was cool.....had a cafeteria feel to it. Service is hit or miss depending on who you get. Ordered the Beef dip w/ american cheese, potato salad, and a cup of chili w/ beans; 蕀y girl ordered the beef dip w/ minestrone soup. Started off w/ the chili........ohhhh noooo!!!! this was the worst chili I've ever had.....seriously! The meat felt like it had died a few times over before being cooked, and even then.....when I got it, it was barely more than room temperature!!! Bad start.....but it was all uphill from there. The Minestrone soup was good, Sandwich was off the hook!!!! (both the meat and the bread were perfect), and the potato salad is one of the best I've had in a long time. The spicy mustard.....tasted like horseradish to me....nothing else. I asked if I could order a side of the ajou for dipping, but the lady said they do not provide that and that they just dip the sandwich for us before giving it up.......that's a little strange, but who cares when the sandwiches are that good..... Got a slice of apple pie and a coffee for the road. The pie was really good, and the coffee was fine.....kept me awake for a little while. Other things I noticed is that this place is environmentally conscious and they do what they can to contribute to a better environment.....they also had "splash pads" in the urinals......which I had never seen before. You have to check this place out......just leave the nasty chili alone.

Philippe's is bombness on a plate. 蔜here is no better place to get a beef dip in the world! 蔍n addition to bomb beef (actually a plethora of dips, including lamb and turkey) dips their soups are delicious (try dipping the sammie in it - trust me it is good!), the blueberry pie is sinful, and the lemonade and ice tea are cheap and wonderful. 蔜his place should be on everyone's bucket list...it is just that amazing!

I had heard soo much about this place, that one Sunday my boyfriend and i in our hungover lazy mode decided that today would be the best day to try the famous Philippe's. We drove all the way from our house in Pasadena to Chinatown and drove around trying in vain to get parking... i guess we should have known since it was Sunday night at 5:00pm. Once we got our Parking spot we wandered inside thinking ya it'll be a wait to get table but it shouldn't be that bad. We were then faced with a huge crowd of people it didn't take us ling to figure out that you wait in line get your food and then find a table. I knew what i was ordering before i even looked at the menu. A double dipped beef sandwich with jack cheese. It was amazing i mean soo good! �The BF got 蔄merican cheese and swears his was better but i disagree) 蔅asically i loved my sandwich and I'm presently trying to find reasons to go to Chinatown so that i can get another. P.S. The hot mustard was amazing!

Not bad if you are ever in the area and want some french dip sandwiches but it is just a famous establishment that thrives on customers jumping in on the bandwagon. Don't get me wrong, it's good sandwich but not mouthwatering, saliva dripping, I-have-cravings type of sandwiches that I cannot get anywhere else. The pork sandwich is very juicy and although the french sandwich may look small at first, it surprisingly was enough to fill me up. The turkey sandwich on the other hand, was a bit drier but not too bad to the point where I would never touch it again. Parking can be an issue on weekends or during the lunch rush on weekdays. There is a small parking lot but once it's full, good luck trying to find parking on the streets.

Now, I'm not Santa Yelp, handing out 5 stars like this fine city's doctors dole out weed licenses to our teenage sons. But Phillipe's is the best for a very simple reason: Two beef with blue cheese sandwiches (double dipped), two potato salads, one macaroni salad, one bowl of chili with beans, and one slice of pecan pie. Beverages are quite subjective: Bud Diesels on tap with the boys, iced tea and/or lemonade depending on one's mood/time of day. 蔆hili, pie, and macaroni salad are shared with my cutie. 蔜his meal has never failed to delight, pleasure, and evoke silence/feelings of ecstasy from my girlfriend and me. 蔍t's like taking a pull on the slot machine of 蔯ulinary pleasure/life and happiness in general and hitting the jackpot every single time. Run here, walk here, drive here, take the train here (it's only a short walk away from Union Station). 蔣ou won't regret it. 蔒y grandfather is 91, and has been coming to Phillipe's for the same exact meal (slightly different prices, as he likes to remind me) from the time he attended Hollywood High School in the '30s. 蔠hile some things have changed, quality food, old-school L.A. charm, damn fair prices, good service, diversity of its patrons, and long waits have remained in tact. 蔄fter waiting in one of the many lines, be sure to tip your server (as she's the one hooking you up with previously described deliciousness), and remember: request that your sandwich be "double-dipped." This is almost as necessary as 'animal styling' your burger at in-n-out. I hope you'll enjoy and appreciate everything Phillipe's has to offer as much as I do. 蔍 only hope one day I'll be able to share this LA gem with my grandchildren, as I point out how sandwiches were only $5.55 蔮ack in the day...

pros... one crazy place to go for some french dipped sandwiches. 蔿ocated off the beaten path, no not really, but it's on the edge of chinatown. 蕋his place is packed full of people, and it's packed all the time, from what i was told. 蔭nd i can see why. �this place has not changed anything from when it was opened, the tables, chairs and the trays all look like they were the originals from the 1940's or so. 蔭t least that is the feeling you get when you walk in. 蔭nd before you even get to the place you can see the line which snakes around the place, both the front and the back doors. 蕎e got lucky and used the back door, and the line moves pretty fast. the food was great, my wife shared a beef and pork sandwich. 蕎e also ordered the potato salad and some tapioca pudding for dessert as well. 蔲or drinks we ordered the lemon aide and an iced tea. 蔭ll delicious. �i think that this place as the best potato salad ever, and don't like any type of salad at all, but the salad here is just awesome. 蕋he sandwiches were good, meat was tender and nicely moistened with the dipping sauce/au jus. 蕋he beef one had a bit too much which made the bread disintegrate into a soggy mess, but we still ate it. �loved the crowded, loud and crazy atmosphere, it is so LA for me. 蔿ove the sawdust all over the floor. 蔵t was fun to wait in line and just kind kick the stuff or just pile it up and make designs with it. 蔿ove the place. 蕎ish it wasn't as crowded, but i guess that is part of the fun. cons... parking sucks helmet here. 蔱ven with the over flow parking across the street and the one directly in back of the place, it is f'ing crowded. 蕎e actually parked 2 blocks away in the metered parking. 蔴ad to beg for change at two of the shops in chinatown. 蔮ut the walk and the begging for change was worth it. 蕎e were in and out of there in just about 45 minutes. 蕇o if you are planning to park else where, bring a lot of change. 蕋he meters around here are hungry, as they gobble up $2.00 for an hour.

I would recommend that you read the menu before you go there. The menu is on a large billboard on the wall which was rather difficult for me to read. However, I was only fixed on one thing which was having a beef french dipped sandwich, double dipped. I came here when I was a little kid. It was interesting coming back here as an adult. Things have changed slightly. They used to give you the dipping sauce on the side, but I guess with the amount of containers that they have to give out, it is better just to dip it themselves to save on that. Also, the iced tea is only 65 cents and the lemonade 75 cents. The sandwich was excellent. Also, there is a water dispenser in the front if you want some tap water as it is self serve. I wish I could have tried the salads that they had in view. It was really crowded as fire fighters, police officers, etc. all came to eat here. It is very popular with the locals as we had to wait in a long line to get our food. However, the line goes by very quickly.

Food was just ok, I had higher expectations based on the reviews and seeing it featured on the travel channel. The double dip beef was decent but I found it to be a little dry and skimpy on the meat. Potato and Mac salads were good. Chocolate cream pie looked better than it tasted. Huge lines, $2 to park on the street cuz the tiny lot was full. Cafeteria style seating with a pretty sketchy crowd. Kind of an adventure to try once, but I would not go back.

Philippe's definitely lived up to it's reputation. 蔄fter seeing the place featured on a Travel Channel show my friend and I made it a point to stop here last time we were in LA. 蔄s long as you're okay fighting for your place in line when you get up to the counter it won't take too long to get your food. So, don't be timid. 蔕nce you've worked your way to the counter just get the attention of one of the servers, they're not going to come after you, there's plenty of other costumers. 蔅oth my friend and I got the traditional french dip roast beef sandwiches. 蔒ine was single dipped and his was double, and I have to admit I was a little jealous of his extra soggy flavorful bread. 蔆old slaw was okay, I'd recommend trying a different side though. 蔜he cafeteria style seating is fitting and it's hard for me not to love a place that keeps wood shavings on the floor.

One of the best French dip sandwich in the world (Houston's is good too). This place is not fancy but it keeps it real. It's a cash only joint so have your green backs ready. Aside from their French dip sandwiches, Phillippe also has great dessert. My personal favorite is the tapioca pudding. Phillippe also has good side dishes: mac salad, pickles, etc. Here's a link to their menu which is pretty big: 蔴ttp://bit.ly/8onyt4 .I would stay away from their water down lemonade & iced tea thought.

Oh man. Philippe's. A staple. Sooooo goooood. I've tried all the different sandwiches, and though I love the original french dip, the lamb has really grown on me. I'll take that, a side of potato salad, two glasses of lemonade, and a slice of their pecan pie. And if I'm reeeeaally feeling adventurous and wanting a serious afternoon food coma, I'll order the chilli. Last time my buddy was there he was sitting next to Han Solo. Yes, Han.

This is one of those places you go out of your way to get to stand in a long ass line with a bunch of bitter urbanites/angelinos/people from LA. Probably spend way more money than you would have spent somewhere elese for the same thing. Get what they are going to serve, not what you thought you wanted... and end up loving the sandwich so much that you have dreams about it and can't wait to go back! 40 minutes out of my way most trips and I go once a month.

Pay no attention to the tourists when you walk in, Phillipe's is beloved by everyone who lives in LA. And for good reason. Step up to the counter, basic choices are behind your order taker, but be sure to check out the full menu board on your right. You order your sandwich, sides, beverage and even desert. You pay her (yes all the servers are women) buy putting the money (yes cash only) on the tray. A runner will take the money tray away to the cashier, then bring your change back. And yes, please tip your server. Sides worth ordering include macaroni salad, potato salad, sweet pickles, dill pickles, cheery pie, chocolate cream pie. Ice tea is 65�and coffee is 9��and no thats not a typo). Refills are the same low price. Insiders tip: if you what a refill of your beverage or another side, don't wait in any of the main 蔿ines. Go to the far right of the counter and order right there. 蔇on't forget Phillipe's special hot mustard available at every table. This east coast boy votes Phillipe's the best french dip sandwich to be found on any coast - hands down. Old school in all the best ways.

Ok so after seeing this place on TV and hearing how good it was we decided to finally try it on one of our trips to California. It is not to far from Olvera street where we usually eat but what the heck.... So we get parked and walk in and wait forever in line which was expected because it was so packed on TV and we have also passed it before on our visits. We finally get to ordering and i thought ok this better be good for the price. But I notice alot of people holding coupons and groupons I said to myself no wonder... we order our french dips and took them over to our table ... we were very disappointed with our food. The meat was bland and the portion was very small. We all could of eaten 2. When you are riding in a vehicle for 5 蔴rs and finally get to your destination to eat good you really want to be satisfied. None of us were and we were a party of 8. We still left hungry and also thought the food was not good at all. The experience of going and being a part a crowd that does this everyday is very exciting. It was fun but when you leave its sad not because you are leaving and wont have this again for another year. its because you just spent a bunch of money on sorry food.

On our way to San Diego from San Francisco, Mike and I needed to make a pit stop and Philippe's was on the way. Mike had never seen Chinatown in LA before, so it was scenic for him to drive thru Chinatown and then to Philippes. I like that there is a parking lot and that they were open on New Year's Eve. I had not been here since I was an undergrad at USC, but this place looked exactly the same- only less crowded. The coffee was still 9 cents and the pies looked inviting. Mike got a lamb French dip with bleu cheese and I got the beef. It sucks that they are cash only, but we had enough to fill up. Mike was impressed at the size of their wine pours and the prices on the beer. Now that we are back in SD, Mike can't wait to drive back up to try the pies.

Im sorry but Coles is so much better. My dad loves this place but I think it may have just gotten less delcious over the years... The sandwhiches suck. Too small and poor quality meat. Fun place to experience once, but then go get a really yummy sandwhich at Coles instead.

The french dip sandwiches were pretty darn good along with the coleslaw and potato salad. 蔠e had the turkey (moist and delicious) and the beef. 蔠hen we went, we only had to wait in line for about 10 to 15 minutes, which wasn't bad at all. 蔋eard so many great things about this place. 蔍 wouldn't wait in line for longer than 30 minutes for it though. 蔍t's great, but not THAT great. 蔇efinitely worth a try!

Love this place! Yum Yum Yum. I always ask for it double dipped so it's extra moist. The cole slaw and potato salad are also very good. It always looks really crowded in there, but just walk around and you should find a table pretty easily.

On the fundamentals, Philippe merits either three stars or four. It's the intangibles that brings the house built on French dips the full five. The food is a broad menu of its legendary French dips, with folklore saying it was invented here, and a broad selection of American comfort food. The menu is large enough to be scribed on a life-size board to the right of the counter. The French dips are OK, but worth ordering to see what all the fuss is about. The beef is good but nothing special, and the most flavorful meat is the lamb. All go well with Philippe's own hot mustard, in small jars at every table. Philippe is also one of the most reasonable food values in downtown Los Angeles, and keeps hours outside of the commuter crowd. A filling lunch can be had for under $7, and a full-course meal (sandwich, vegetable, starch, dessert and drink) for less than $12. The drinks are priced low enough to be loss leaders, with a cup of Yuban going for a dime and iced tea and lemonade for 50 cents. The ordering lines are long, because the cashier is the same person that fetches the orders. It's more sanitary than it sounds. However, the food gathering moves at assembly-line efficiency. Patrons then find a seat on two floors. The high-walled booths are few and far between, and are hard to get. Most of the seats are communal benches. This facilitates conversation within a party and complete strangers as well. The floors are garnished with sawdust. Philippe also has an old-style concession counter with candies, cigarettes and branded swag. And the intangibles that make Philippe a one-of-a-kind institution: 1. The social leveling. There are only diners in Philippe. All races, classes and occupations vanish temporarily. The benches have elbow-to-elbow seating of cops and released inmates from the nearby jail, blue-collar laborers and white-collar professionals, government workers and libertarians, and so on. Leave anti-social tendencies at the door. 2. History. Though no one can discern the truth, several theories involve the French dip being created at Philippe. How it was created is in dispute, and some even believe the sandwich itself was created at another downtown eatery, Cole's PE buffet. 3. Consistency. Philippe is able to flout modernity by staying to a broad menu but very slowly embracing the Pretty Young Things of culinary conventions. 4. The MetroRiderLA cool factor. Philippe has been a friend of public transportation back when it seemed like it was the only friend of public transportation. The Philippe story seemed to coexist with the development of railroads and Southern California's old traction-based transit service. A shrine to public transit is near the water fountain. And, it's proximity to buses and rail can't be beat. Transit access: Metro Red and Gold lines, Rapid lines 740 and 745, Express lines 439, 442, 444, 445, 446/447, 484, 485, 487 and 490, Local lines 28/83/84/328, 33/333, 38/71, 40/42, 45/46, 68/368, 70/370, 76/376, 78/79/378, 81/381, 90/91, 94/394 and 96; all Metrolink lines except Inland Empire-Orange County; Amtrak Pacific Surfliner, interstate train service and Thruway bus connections; FlyAway; LADOT Commuter Express 534, and DASH D-Downtown and Lincoln Heights/Chinatown; Antelope Valley Transit Authority 785; all Foothill Transit Express lines 480-499 and 699; Santa Clarita Transit 794; Santa Monica's Big Blue Bus Line 10, and Torrance Transit lines 1 and 2.

I enjoyed the food and the experience. I am very busy and want fast food service but homemade taste. This place was just that. As soon as I paid, they handed over the sandwiches. The atmosphere reminded me of Ribs USA in Burbank because of the wood shavings on the floor, except it was way bigger. It was also like a old New York restaurant in that you walk down stairs and the place is below street level. The old brick wall reminds me that this place is historic; what has happened here in the past 100 years? There was also tons of free parking when I went on a Sunday around 6:00pm. I love not having to pay for parking. Good place to bring a group of friends.

Back in Dec. (+ 3 other times in 2010)... Dropping from 5 to 4. 蔒aybe I have been here too many times or maybe I've been biased since I loved this place for so long. 蔜here seems to be a slight drop off in their signature sandwich. 蔐ike from A/A- to A-/B+ ... 蔜hey have used the same recipe since forever--supposedly... 蔍 can't place it. 蔍t might be as basic as the bread is a tad older or perhaps the meat quality used with the age old recipe is a tad lower. Otherwise: 蔜he place has that "old school cool" look because it's actually from the era. 蔜he place was as packed as I ever seen it. �BUT IT'S ABOUT FOOD RIGHT? 蔜he food is not "gourmet" but I would never call it run-of-the-mill. 蔍 have gone here a good 20-30 times. � or 3 times they missed the mark a bit. 蔋ey, Michael Jordan has missed shots and Mohammed Ali has lost fights too. 蔍f you have unearthly standards, or don't do "common folk" food, then you'll probably think it's "okay". 蔋owever, if you are someone who like's it "real" as well, perhaps like Anthony Bourdain of No Reservations (who ate here and liked it) or the fella on "Diners, Drive-Ins, and Dive's", then this place is as good as they come. 蔍f I have a "usual", it is the lamb and I aint scared of the hot mustard and I go to what most might think is obscene amounts of it. 蔒ost of the sides are good--just go w/ what's calling out to you.

People might say this place is over rated, but it's been one of the first places for french dip, along with Coles in downtown l.a. , it's part of culinary history. Yeah, the lines are long, but it's quick. When you come to Philippe you don't come for the ambiance, you come for the food. The beef dip or lamb dip with swiss, side of pickles and potato salad, and their lemonade to wash down all that food. The price is reasonable, and their coffee is still the cheapest coffee you will ever have.

Okay so I have to start with the fact that myself and my husband had been on a three hour hike before we came here so needless to say I was super hungry. I was expecting to have some of the best sandwiches I had ever had. The first thing you need to know is that they take CASH only so be ready to have your cash in hand. Secondly there are no real lines so beware you might have a little bit of a wait if you stand behind someone who doesn't know what they want. I like the old school vibe, however the sandwich that I had was good, but not the best I have ever had. I wish they had goat cheese it would be awesome if they did. There is plenty of parking and thank god for that. However the apple pie is some kind of wonderful I recommend trying it.

Philippe is an LA landmark and it is a great place to kill some time and the food is good. First of all the place does have long lines but they move whole lot faster than Pink's line. Their menu is basic and is not hard to decide what you want. I go with a beef sandwich double dipped with blue cheese on it (it will be extra). It is good the only drawback is the sandwiches are a little on the overpriced side could a tad bit cheaper. Everything else is cheap I recommend the pickled egg and the straight chili (not together it can be a deadly combo gas wise). The ambiance is great cause it is so old school and the shared table concept is great. It might not be for everyone but if you look hard enough you can get a booth on for yourself. Other than that just enjoy your sandwich.

I have been coming to Philippe's for over 15 years! Each trip is as good as that first dip I had all those years ago. I always come back for the beef (always get your sandwiches double dipped) which I consider the best sandwich. The lamb, pork & turkey (in that order of preference) are all delicious. The ambiance is vintage and feels like an old pub. It's the delicious simplicity of Philippe's that makes it a one of a kind from it's setting to its French dips. The lines can go up to one hour but the food makes the wait worth it.

I've had the pleasure of trying all the sandwiches at Philippe. The best one in my opinion is the beef with swiss. If you don't want to wait in a long line, avoid going here durin lunch, before a dodger game. The best time is late at night, but not too late, because they close at 9. If you've never had a really bad french dip, you won't understand how good philippe is.Its kind of like eating steak at Ruth Chris, how are you to know how good their steak is unless you've eaten a steak at sizzlers.

We met the other night downtown and ate at Phillippe's. You should try, as we do, the other items on the menu. We know what the sandwiches are, so we order the beef stew and chile. these items were really good. It certainly is a value $$ 蔲or dinner. Their sandwiches have too much bread for my taste, but to each their own. Look at their wine list by the glass. Their selection is pretty good. The restaurant itself is worth a look.

After seeing the raves about this place on the food channel, I couldn't wait to try it out. It took me a bit to find, and you could imagine the look on my face when I saw that big PHILLEPE'S sign just ahead. As I entered, I noticed a large crowd of people, in business attire, eagerly waiting for their order. I thought, "wow, I guess the food channel was right. the menu seems awesome." We finally get to the front of the line, it's my first time and I'm trying to get used to the style of ordering. The prices seem great and fair. When we get our order, I'm put off by the lack of places to sit, but luckily scored a booth in the back. I take a first bite of my french dip with au jus and BLEH! I'm a tad grossed out by the soggy bun, the flavor of what DOG FOOD might taste like, and assume my only hope is the mustard that could put this disagreement between the food and my taste buds to a grinding halt. No go. The mustard was worse, as the heat eminated from my flaring nostriles, I thought I was gonna pass out. The tiny (joke) of a cup of soda wasn't enough to extinguish my inflammed palatte, and HELL if I was gonna stand in line for a refill. I'll never do this again. I don't see how so many people are attracted to this place. Perhaps Phillepe should box up this place, like their nasty sandwiches, and let its old history lie in the PAST. Maybe this meat experience is why I turned vegetarian in the first place. ;[

If you are in LA either for business, tourism, or residence, and have a good amount of time for lunch, I advise you to check this place out. Claiming to be the founder of the french dip sandwich, Philippe surely lives up to the hype with its delicious sandwich varieties and side dishes. Another huge plus is that the lemonade, iced tea, and coffee prices have remained the same over the lifetime of the business, making them a lot cheaper than ordering at other restaurants. I definitely recommend this place to anyone who loves sandwiches and food in general.

I know that is this place is very famous in LA, but I went to college in Montreal, Canada and this cannot even compare. The meat was a little dry although the bread was ok. Adding mustard to increase the flavor of the sandwich was a mistake. That mustard will knock your socks off! The side dishes (coleslaw, flan, etc.) were also decent, but could be better. They just lacked flavor and the right texture. The atmosphere complemented the casual feeling of the food well.

I like it hot...and sawdusty. 蔜hat's why I come to Philippe's. 蔖hilippe's is one of THE staples of LA and you can't really call yourself a local unless you eat here...and your dad ate here...and well, you get the idea. 蔖hilippe's has been around since the early 1900's and is nestled in the heart of Chinatown, just about a block from Olvera street. 蔜he staff has been there just about as long 蔭s the restaurant and they are cute and old and always friendly. 蔅e prepared to wait in line at the counter to place your order FOREVER, but you get to order so much deliciousness and you're greeted with such a smile when you do, it's worth the wait. 蔄 must is to order one of Philipe's "dipped" sandwiches--I'm partial to the lamb or pork option--and adding swiss or bleu cheese is an added taste sensation. 蔅e sure to ask for the sandwich "double dipped" if you like your French dips a bit on the moist side. 蔄fter that, I highly recommend their pickles and potato salad--they all taste like something you'd get at a church bazaar or at your great-grandmother's house on a Sunday afternoon. Creamy, savory and nostalgia on a plate. 蔜he place is always busy and seating can get crowded--be prepared to sit at long communal tables with other folks and to get sawdust (from the floor!) on you. 蔜here is upstairs seating as well, and lots of strange little back rooms and crannies that have larger booths if you want it a bit quieter. 蔇on't forget to top everything you eat with Philippe's famous hot mustard--very similar to Chinese hot mustard, it packs a punch and you won't be sorry you tried it. 蔣ou can even purchase a jar (or a t-shirt...or some vintage gum...or a Philippe's bobble head) to bring home with you if you're so inclined. 蔣ou can also get Philipe's delicious lemonade or iced tea to wash it all down (still 75 cents!) along with your chocolate cream pie...or bowl of beef stew...or pancakes...or hell, whatever else you want to cram into yourself while you're there. 蔒mmm...welcome to 80 years ago and you'll know why Philippe's is still going strong!

It's pretty easy to please a stomach like mine, especially after I've played a three day volleyball tournament. Philippe's definitely hit the spot after a crazy weekend of sun, shouting, and volleyball on asphalt. Luckily for me, friends waited in the reeediculous line for us and ordered a smorgasboard of things for us to try. My top picks were the original french dip (which oddly enough did not come with any dip, nor was extra dip provided) and the chili. Though my friends ordered quite a bit of food, I felt like they didn't even tap the surface of the all encompassing menu. There were so many items whether it was sandwich, side, or dessert, that now I am very obligated to come back and try even more of Philippe's offerings.

This place is delicious and CHEAP! It was $5.55 for a sandwich, and then I also go a potato salad and the pickled egg. I really liked the pickled egg. The sandwich was also great, it was quite moist. The lemonade there is also smooth, it's not too tangy or anything. Everyone should definitely try this place out, AND it has parking. When you first enter, it's interesting, everyone's lined up in rows, kind of cool actually.

The French dips that made this place famous are well-known for a reason. I like to order different sandwiches every time I've been there just to try 'em all out. Can't say I disliked any of them. I do rate this place a little bit lower than everyone else because while the sandwiches were good, I didn't feel it was as amazing as everyone else raves. Good food, good price, long lines but it gives you a chance to chat with random people who are usually in a good mood when they've got a French dip to chow down on.

Okay I'm a simple kind of girl, give me a good sandwich and I'm a happy camper. This place totally fulfills my sandwich cravings. Now this is a different type of sandwich. No lettuce, tomatoes, onion here. Its more like French Dipped sandwiches in the broth of your choice of meat. Meats like beef, lamb, turkey etc. These meats are slow roasted so the broth that accumulates at the bottom is where the bread is dipped. Soo goood. Add your choose of swiss, jack, american cheese a side of slaw, macaroni or potato salad & a slice of pie and you are set. They best part is the price. $5 for sandwich, sides $1, pie $1.50, lemonade $.50 and just like that you are enjoying a little part of LA history. I also recommend their chili bean soup with cheese if you have room in your belly. CASH ONLY. ATM machine inside for a $3.50 fee.

Grew up in the Los Angeles area and hadn't been here since I was a kid. 蔠e arrived around lunch on a nice Saturday afternoon and walked in to see everyone standing in line. 蔍 had the double dipped beef, my fiance had the single dip turkey and we shared an order of cole slaw. 蔄fter we paid at the counter (CASH ONLY) we took a seat and noticed that there was no cheese on the turkey sandwich (ordered with cheese), but didn't want to go through the hassle of getting through the line for cheese. 蔒y fiance thought that her sandwich was OK and I thought the same about the beef dip. 蔜he cole slaw was ok as well. All in all, we were not impressed and probably won't make a point to come back anytime soon. 蔍f you have never been, it is a bit of time warp as the place looks much like it did many years ago and it is where the french dip was invented.

One of my favorite places in LA. I go at least once a month. I rotate between the turkey and the beef double dip. Make sure to get 蔭 side of slaw. Take the top piece of bread off, add slaw and then some of their super duper mustard. Then put top back on and enjoy one of the best sandwiches around. I also get a side of chili with no beans and a bag of fritos. Second half of sandwich is great with same stuff as on the first and a little bit of chili. Only place with a better beef dip is Houston's.

Me and a friend came here at like 7 am, after we had been at work all night since 11 pm. We walked in open minded and ready to eat everything in sight. I asked to make sure, "you are serving your sandwiches right now?" she replied "OF COURSE." so I happily stood in the long line, and decided I'd also go with a manhattan clam chowder (which was listed on the board). When asked to order, by the same woman who I'd previously spoke to, the moment I opened my mouth to say turkey, she started shaking her head. "oh no, we only have the pork and beef. So I ordered beef. Although I'm not really into it. I got a side of corn beef hash, a pickle, and an iced tea. My total came to about 11 bucks. I waited for my food as my friend scarfed hers down. (she ordered an omelet, fat tire, and what she referred to as "soap pie" -or pumpkin pie.) as the line piled up, the waitress calls me back over after several minutes and tells me that the sandwiches are not yet ready. :/ I gave her the look of disappointment and ordered a veggie omelet. And a chocolate pie to hold me over since I figured I'd get something to hold me over. (however, I didn't get the pie until I got the toast, which was 10 minutes later.) she made me pay a $3 difference even though I had been waiting! I then asked if I could at least get my 65 cent sweet tea? She smiles and tells me that I now owe a $5 difference. Ugh, I payed it and sat down. Now my food is at $15, I'm starving, and everyone that walked in 10 after I ordered has their food. When I was reordering, she asked what cheese I would prefer, I told her Swiss. She asked again, "SWISS". 5 minutes after I got my pie and toast, I got all my food in sections. Last I received the omelet, that contained American cheese. That's when I got upset. I walked to her calmly and said "ma'am I've been waiting for an omelet that is wrong?", she says "ohhhhh, no Swiss? You know what? I'm going to give you a complementary sandwich!" seconds from telling me that she hands me a beef French dip sandwich. So where did this sandwich magically appear from? I didn't ask, I know one thing, it sucked. Even if that were originally what I ordered and everything went smoothly, I still would say the bread was gross and too soggy, like it had been sitting there all day. The meat was dry as hell. And the place smelled weird. I did like the corn beef and the sweet tea, but those are the hardest things to mess up. Sorry, just bc your place has been open for 100+ years, doesn't mean I'm impressed. Serve me at least GOOD food for 15 bucks and I won't complain. I'll never come back here.

This is truly an LA icon when it comes to a great place to grab a quick meal. Their dip sandwiches are legendary - with good reason. Everything here is made on the premises, and it tells by the quality of all the sides. If you're in LA on business or pleasure, and especially on your way to or from a Dodgers game, this place is a MUST STOP. (Don't tell anyone, but I have actually been known to drive to LA just to eat here.) Best item is still the beef dip, but the turkey, lamb and other sandwiches are all pretty awesome in their own right. Although I've had breakfast here several times, it pales in comparison to their sandwiches and sides. On a visit last summer tor see the Dodgers, I took my grandsons and neighbor kids here first. Even though I told them all to go easy on the house mustard, someone always has too much. What a great way to clear your sinuses! Outstanding food quality at bargain price keep me and many others coming back eager to eat here again.

I did not know what to expect from this place at all, except that the Chili was supposed to be good. And it was. And it was cheap. For less than $5 I had a cup of Chili and crackers and a bottle of water. If I come back, I would like to try a Sandwich since those looked good. The place had a lot of food options, all at good cheap prices. I did not like the seating arrangements though. It is set up cafeteria-styled where you have to find your own spot while you run around with a tray in hand in a packed (but big) eating area. It reminded me of Middle School trying to figure out where to eat and next to who. In summary, I would prefer not to come back though I would not make a hassle about it if I did return. The prices are cheap so I can't complain. The seating arrangements are awkward and not something I really enjoy but tolerable.

The mustard is great and spicy. �The coconut cream pie is probably the best I've ever had - lots of coconut flakes in the creamy thick center and coconut on top. 蕐um. �The meat is thicker and better cooked than at Cole's - the lamb was perfectly med. rare and still a little pink. just the way that I like it. 蔜he double dip is not soggy at all - and if you didn't get it that way bet it'd be dry. 蔖ickles standard but good crunch and it's always fun to eat a pickled egg that's fished out of a jar. 蔵ced tea and lemonade watery but passable (they pre-pour them and they sit there til people order them). 蔊o here for the atmosphere. 蔛tay for the food. 蔇on't buy a burial plan.

Having read Yelp.com's reviews of Cole's vs Philippe's as the home of the original French dip, I decided to follow the recommendations of fellow Yelpers and took the Red Line Metro to Union Station. 蔜he long lines moved quickly, patrons vacated stools pretty frequently, and I was able to finish my beef single-dip (delicious - thankfully, a friend cautioned me about the strength of the mustard), macaroni salad (excellent, by the way), pickled egg (dyed red), and nine-cent coffee in short order. 蔆ome to think of it, instead of getting back in line for a coffee refill, I should have bought two or three cups the first time around - those thick mugs did a great job of keeping the java warm!!!

I can not say enough good things about this place. The food is awesome the prices are good and knowing I am eating a restaurant legend is cool. The beef dip is must have and the pork dip comes in a close second. Don't forget to order a pickle and remember to place your money on the tray. The food server will not touch your money.

Its pretty good, but like so many LA landmarks, its over rated, over hyped, over priced and over crowded. As I said the sandwiches are pretty good, its just not worth the drive, parking, and lines. 蔜here are way too many other places that have comparable food without the hassles.

it's an LA thing. i grew up visiting "fellipe-y's" - i don't think many native angeleno's call it by the french pronounciation. it's a really simple sandwich. no tomato, no lettuce, just bread dipped in meat juice, meat, and french bread. you have to put the mustard on. and take a bottle home. as far as variety, for breakfast, they have an assortment, but the sandwiches are really the main draw. usually everybody orders a side of coleslaw and a piece of pie. it's old school. if you want the typical soy this or asian fusion salad, it's not happening here. i usually eat the beef and half of a turkey sandwich, and i'm a small girl. my boyfriend usually orders a couple beef and a pork. i've heard the lamb was good. very casual, not scenester. thank goodness. maybe there's hope for LA after all.

The birthplace of the french dipped sandwich. The place has been there for 100 years or so. Worth going to if your from LA. Lines are huge. You'll probably see 40 to 100 people in line at any given time, but you'll move up pretty fast. Usually about 15 minutes. French dip is good, but I've had better. Not all that its hiped up to be. 蔜hey make there own mustard and its pretty good. They also have a pretty good selection of pies.

the french dip sandwiches here are good but nothing to write home about. 蕋he thin sliced beef is generously packed in wet 蔮uns dipped in beef juice...which may not be for all taste. 蔜he cole slaw is excellent, cold and crisp like KFC's. 蔵 went there because i saw it on Huell Howser's PBS show but probably would not go back. 蔍 prefer the the Philly cheesestake with dry buns and yummy cheese �the Grove old farmer's market has the BEST!) ��p.s. do not park on street next to the shop or you'll get towed! 蕌se the parking lot across the street.

Oooooh - so good! 蔜he story I heard was that the french dip was invented here accidentally. 蔕n a particularly busy day, this man ordered a sandwich and one of the pieces of bread fell in some beef sauce. 蔜he person making the sandwich was so frazzled she just put it on the sandwich and served it. 蔜he man returned the next day and raved about the sandwich and asked them to make it exactly the same way....and, thus, the french dip was born.

I am a third generation Philippe lover and proud of it. My grandma says it hasn't changed much since she was younger. 蔍f 蕐ou say you love L.A. but you have never been here you don't really love L.A. This place is close to another one of my favorite spots Olvera Street! 蔍t's a little piece of history. And the food is great. There is also a little candy corner in the store and they stock some old favorites. They also still have the cool phone boothes inside although I haven't checked to see if they work still they sure do look cool. There's tons of room upstairs and it's fun to wander around.

not much to write that hasnt been written, just wanted to add a rating under my belt. portions are sadly small, but what can u do. I bought 2 beef sandwiches, a bottle of mustard to go, one crappy pickle, and a cute lemonade (no wonder its 75 cents its about 6 oz.) man that sandwich hits the spot though doesn't it? So crowded but line takes 15 minutes at most and somehow find a place to sit. Skip all the mac-cheese doritos crap 4 me; can eat those at home too. Only reason not 5 stars it would cost me $15 minumum to get full everytime, but were wouldnt it...

French dip sandwiches - beef, lamb, turkey, pork - I had the turkey and some navy bean/spinach soup. It was a savory meal that gave me energy for the rest of the day!

Great french dip sandwiches. 蔍'm not a big fan of sandwiches, but Philippe is very good, especially with their special hot mustard sauce.

A Los Angeles landmark and birthplace of the French dipped sandwich, Philippe's is a great restaurant for a very reasonable price. The sandwiches are consistently good, and the lemon meringue pie is probably the best in LA, tons of meringue. They serve fresh-squeezed lemonade too. The mustard is also famous - a little bit goes a long way. Pre-war decor, including old telephone booths and 1930s-style staff uniforms. Casual dining, sawdust on the floor. Staff is friendly, though the place is always busy (crowded, actually) and the lines can be a little long. Great for dates, groups and kids.

My dad introduced me to Philippes when I was a little girl so it holds a special place in my heart. I've gone here on an average of once a year and I usually get the turkey beef dip with soup, usually the clam chowder. I introduced my boyfriend to Phillipes and he loves it and he has gotten lamb, beef, and turkey dip. We usually get a dipped sandwich and split an American cheese sandwich. We are used to the wait and the no- so friendly service so we don't care about that. I wish that tv shows would stop visiting my favorite places to eat because they hype it up and negative reviews are common.

Awesome sandwiches!!! Best French dip I've ever had. You get your choices of meat. I suggest the pork, double dipped with a little of that mustard. I emphasize little. That condiment is a burner!

Went for Saturday lunch. The line was not quite out the door when we got there but it was by the time we left (around 1:30pm). Parking was easy in the private lot. We got the lamb and the beef, both double dipped, a dill pickle, and some stewed prunes. The beef was fantastic, and I'll definitely be getting it next time. The lamb was a close second. Pickle was perfect. Prunes were a surprisingly awesome dessert (they're in a yummy sugary syrup). I was really congested when I got there, but the mustard took care of that REAL quick. Be careful with that mustard... $0.60 for iced tea? Oh yeah. 2 sandwiches, 2 sides, 2 drinks: $18. -1 star for the not-so-great upstairs area. We felt like we walked into a hospital ward. Try and sit downstairs if it's not too packed.

You will find lawyers, judges, secretaries, postman, seniors, teens, black, brown and yellow, yes, white also.

This place was on my list of must-try places before I left LA... I unknowingly and stupidly came for a late lunch just a few hours before a Dodgers game. It seemed like every Dodgers and Giants fan had decided to stop into Philippe's before the game. Despite the two huge parking lots they have reserved for patrons, parking was basically a nightmare - cars waiting for people to leave, cars blocking the driveway, pedestrians almost getting run over, etc etc. Inside was no better. Thankfully, they had set up lines all along the main counter, so you didn't have to wait in one long line, but one of many much shorter lines. The staff were doing the best they could to deliver orders promptly but the patrons were taking their sweet time and ordering extra side orders to go. In contrast to its newer, fancier competitor Cole's further downtown, Philippe's dips the sandwich for you, rather than give you a little cup of au jus to dip yourself. But this is OK because I don't believe the sandwich should be too soggy. So I asked for single dip rather than double. You get a pickle on the side and you can choose from a number of fairly sad-looking sides including potato salad, macaroni salad, and cole slaw. The macaroni salad was predictably rather plain and too vinegary. A big plus is that they serve bottle beer, and if it weren't for the hordes dominating the entire dining room, it might be a nice place to sit down with a French dip and a cold brew on a lazy afternoon. They also have lemonade and iced tea that come in these adorable little glasses, and coffee that supposedly costs the same as it did when Philippe's opened - 5 cents. I would say that besides the crowds, the French dips are good but nothing special. I would rather pay a little more for the classier dining environment at Cole's. Good and historic. DON'T go on game days.

Perfectly decent sandwiches, though I found them to be a bit expensive for what you get. If you're in downtown L.A., it's an obvious choice for lunch. If you live in Southern California, it's probably worth at least one pilgrimage. But don't expect Philippe's to change your world view on French Dips. ;)

I had sandwiches in this restaurant couple times before but this time I came to have their cheesecake & coffee as one of the yelper claims that they've the best cheesecake in SCAL. 蔠ell, I was just curious how good a sandwich joint can make cheesecake, so after I found out, here's my 3 stars review. 蔜he cheesecake wasn't bad, but much like those frozen cheesecake you can get in supermarket. 蔐earnt that when you come to a restaurant, always try their specialty.

I have no idea what is so great about this sandwich? Is it great just because the Travel Channel says so? The sandwich is tiny and miserable, the line is enormous, and the employees are straight up rude. Visitors and tourists, do yourself a favor and go to Johnny's pastrami sandwiches instead and have a better sandwich with a fraction of the wait and cost. Maybe one day people will be able to differentiate between a good sandwich and a good location. Because Phillipe's is not a good sandwich (but it is close to Dodger stadium). Anyone who says otherwise is either insane or works for Travel Channel.

This review is long overdue, but nonetheless, here goes... my friends suggested this place for our summer trip to LA. Boy was it a mistake to decide to come here. The sandwiches were bland and extremely dry. Ridiculous how small the cups for beverages are and how there is a charge for refills.

Came here to try the "legendary" sandwiches and left still hungry. The line was unbearably long during the weekend I went, and seating was a bitch. I didn't like how there wasn't any french dip on the side--it was inside the sandwich with the meat which made the whole thing soggy. I'd definitely order two sandwiches, or at least a side if you want to leave full.

Now, I feel bad starting off on a bad note, but this place is overrated. There, I said it. The sandwiches are cold and soggy, and relatively bland. I've been here a couple times and tried the lamb and beef dip, and neither stood out to me. I even tried the famous spicy mustard, which in mild doses was annoying, and in heavy doses was overpowering. The mustard doesn't really seem to complement the sandwich, but overpowers it instead. I'm not even a picky eater, but Philippe's is definitely not my cup of tea. Everything from the long waits to the grody floors just rubs me the wrong way. Don't get me wrong, the food and the prices are okay, and I've definitely had worse, more overpriced food, but it would be lie to say I was a fan of Philippe's. If anything, I'd say that this place is still worth a try because it's THAT famous, and the mustard is worth trying because some of my friends definitely are addicted to it.

You always know what to expect when going to Philippes. Long lines, but relatively quick service, pretty good sandwiches, yummy spicy mustard, passable coleslaw and potato salad. If you're into french dip, it's definitely a good place to try out. They only take cash, so be sure to bring about 10 bucks per person.

Ever since Rachel Ray animatedly proclaimed this institution as "YUMM-O," I knew I would be drawn into this place's orbit someday. 蔎ust a hoagie's throw away from Chinatown and Union Station, it was fairly easy to find parking and not be afraid that there will be no car when you return. 蔠e waited about 20-25 minutes (which was longer than I expected - I mean really how long does it take to dunk some bread into au jus? 蔒aybe the workers go slow as to avoid carpal tunnel syndrome...) 蔄nyways, when we finally made our way up to the front of the line, lo and behold the sandwich-maker was NOT WEARING GLOVES! 蔔O ONE WAS WEARING GLOVES! 蔝nless these workers are really android humanoids who merely resemble humans, and don't actually ever need to, say, use the restroom, or scratch their face, or pick their nose, then I MUST QUESTION THE LACK OF BARRIERS BETWEEN THEIR FINGERS AND MY FOOD. 蔉urthermore, these are the same people handling the cash - cash is possibly one of the dirtiest things ever...second maybe only to a gas pump handle. 蔛o, that was a little disgusting - ok a lot disgusting. 蔒y stomach just churned again thinking about what I possible ingested this afternoon... Ok but besides the hygiene issues, the sandwich itself was not bad - on the recommendation of a friend, i got the beef, double dip, w/ a lemonade. 蔜he beef was tender, the bread was a 'just-right' soggy - saturated enough that the au jus flavor was fully penetrated, but still dry enough that I could hold the sandwich without it imploding. 蔐emonade was just ok. 蔅ut their homemade mustard was really nice - it reminded me of Chinese mustard, in that it grabbed my sinuses and kicked them a couple of times. �All in all, a pleasant meal and nice atmosphere...you basically are sharing tables w/ the other patrons, so that was kind of cool (although if you sit by freaks it could turn the experience sour quickly, I'd imagine). 蔍 just have to complain about the gloveless workers. 蔍 know this place was established in 1908 - but does that mean they have to follow the hygiene standards from 100+ years ago too?

After standing in line for about half an hour among dozens of people all crowded in one place, I had pretty high expectations for the sandwich. The lemonade was cheap ($0.75) but as I sat down on a booth next to dirty plates with nothing in front of me but a white wall in a room that felt like a closet, I started to feel as though I was about to be locked up in jail As I took a bite of the sandwich, I felt my teeth sink into layers of lamb fat soaked in bland sauce. I pouted to my friend crying out "This is like prison food" (or what prison food tastes like in my mind). Is this what I had been waiting for? My hopes sank but I was hungry and I had paid $7 for the sandwich so I gulped the rest of my half. I moved onto the custard, hoping it would redeem Philippe. It wasn't bad but it did no redeeming. So sad. Save your time and money because the place does not live up to the hype.

There are several parking lots available especially for Philippe's which is very helpful. 蔜he long lines are definitely worth it (anticipate about a 15-30 minute wait). 蔠hile waiting you can look over the menu and begin to salivate as trays of food pass you from other restaurant attendees. 蔍 don't get too much meat but decided to order the Turkey Sandwich (single dip) with Jack Cheese. 蔄lthough I regretted getting the single dip and will get the double dip next time. 蔍 also had some cole slaw on the side. 蔍t was a great lunch and very filling. 蔜he price wasn't bad at all either. 蔇efinitely will recommend this to family and friends!

i'll be honest and say that if it weren't for all the hype of this place, i would've never ventured this far from home. but, i'm sheep and i have to follow along. we came on a friday nite around 9p. no long lines at all, surprisingly. waited about 5 minutes to get to the counter. ordered myself the beef, no cheese, double dip (is that the right way to order it?), a beer and coleslaw. the gf ordered a turkey, american, lemonade and pickles. all in all cost $18. left the change as tip. not a bad price at all. found ourselves a seat with no problems. i immediately lathered on the table mustard on that first bite. after hearing the hype about the mustard, i was waiting for the "heat"... i need to clarify this about the mustard. "heat" is not the correct term. "kick" is more appropriate. it's a mix of horseradish and wasabi. it does not leave a lasting taste, just that momentary nasal pasage clearing kick. my sandwich was pretty good. the double dip was a great idea. the coleslaw was as well delicious. not too mayo heavy. i could've done with just a little more meat, but, i had my beer and that sufficed in filling me. overall, a good experience. i would've preffered to give them a 3.5, but, i can't. it lived up to the hype for the most part. but, i'm in no hurry to make the drive to downtown again any time soon.

The cheese wasn't overpowering at all, they applied the perfect amount. The lamb sandwich was gone in a few bites. Next up: roast beef. Bite, chew, swallow then drool. Repeat. That's what happened.

I've heard plenty about Philippe's, that I was excited to eat it. 蔍 ordered the lamb french dip sandwich and it was very tasty. 蔍 ordered it with the double dip, and the bread was still crusty (and that's a good thing). 蔍t was nice chunks of lamb, nicely tender. 蔍 added some of their hot mustard and it was full of flavor and spice. 蔜he spice in specific was horseradish. 蔏inda like wasabi, where it packs a big punch. 蔜he potato salad was good, with pickles and onions, a little sweet, a little tangy. 蔜he cole slaw was too sweet for me, I added pepper to cut the sweetness a little. 蔖lus, it was very plain. 蔜he lemon meringue pie was very well made. 蔉luffy, sweet and lemony! 蔎ust the way I like it. �A very crowded place, but the lines move pretty swiftly. 蔖lenty of room to find a spot to eat, saw dust on the floor. 蔐oads of Dodger fans too! 蔜he atmosphere and setting fit the place nicely. 蔍 can't wait to try the roast beef and turkey sandwiches next time. 蔄nd I'll probably order both next time, one sandwich isn't enough for me.

Finally ventured over to Philippe's before a Dodger game and left fat and happy. A buddy and I split 3 sandwiches; the beef, lamb, and the pork and we had each one double dipped. I was nervous at first thinking the double dip would be soggy but it wasn't, it was just right. They were all really good but if I had to rank them I would say pork, beef, and then lamb but none of them disappointed. Next time I'm in LA on that side of town I will be going back for sure.

Great service, wish a smile and the food isn't half bad either. It's a LA classic that is a great place to take out of towners. The spicy mustard is spicy and will creep into your nose and make you say, "Oh, damn it...too much...ahh, ok next bite" I went here a few times as a kid and a few more as an adult. It had been years since I went here last, so long ago actually that I still ate beef. I know it's known for dipped roast beef sandwiches and if you can't eat beef because for some (takes a deep breath) overshare of a reason eating beef screws up your stomach and you can take it from there because lets just say that it isn't a pretty or comfortable feeling when you eat beef and almost immediately have to poo (exhales and inhales) but their other sandwiches are good too. I went because the lady in my life had lived in Southern California for over 10 years and had never been there. The mustard surprised her and the combination of sandwich, pickles and peppers and potato salad made both of us happy. It's a LA landmark for out of towners, locals and those that have lived here for 10+ years and never had it. You gotta have it at least once.

We came here on a whim to get some grub before entering the FYF Fest. Jeff came up with the suggestion and I navigated us to the location; we work good together. Apparently it had been on Anthony Bourdain's show. They serve the perfect beef sandwiches. Nothing fancy, nothing cheap. And by cheap, Im not talking about their prices, I'm talking about the ingredients... real beef, real bread. The beef is moist enough to dampen the sandwich just enough. The spicy mustard adds a kick with out over powering it. The pickles are a refreshing break in between sandwich bites. Also, Jeff said they were just like his grandma's except hers were a tad bit spicier. Point being: They're good because his grandma's are the best. Top it off with an Amstel light and you have a winner! We came at a busy time and on a day that the Dodger's were playing. Still, I was intrigued by how many lines and how long they were. Totally looks like a place the locals flock to.

I also had the chili beans and those were actually pretty good! The mustard was really strong personally I didn't but everyone else seemed to enjoy it. By the way parking sucks!!!

An old favorite! I first ate at Philippe's when I was 15 years old and now nearly 15 years later, I still try to visit when I'm in the neighborhood. It's always the same for me -- double-dip lamb and bleu cheese... with that wonderful spicy mustard of course... and a tapioca pudding cup for dessert if I'm not too full. Consistently good food... casual atmosphere... I love this place. Oh, and cash only. (Though they do have an ATM)

Are all you people writing these 5 star reviews on crack?! This place sucks! Honestly, I don't get what the hype is about. The food is so-so but over priced for what you get. The other reviewer who equated the ordering process to being at the DMV is dead on. You are served mediocre food by the slowest moving employees I've ever seen. Ladies, does the huge line of people waiting to be served create no sense of urgency for you to move any faster? If visiting from out of town, skip this spot and grab some Mexican food at Olvera Street just a few blocks away instead. If this is an LA "institution" what a bad representation of the city.

First off I love the look of this place inside and out, it is like a step back in time. 蔛ome may be put off by the sawdust on the floor and long lines to order. 蔜his is not Applebee's and if you want chain/mall food go some where else. 蔍 had the beef single dipped with blue cheese. Next time I will go for a double dip as I like my dips good and juicy. 蔍 found it very good and plenty of food for lunch with the excellent potato salad. 蔍 got lucky and found a parking spot, my only disappointment was they do not take credit cards, and I was traveling on business, and usually do not carry much cash, but this place is very inexpensive luckily I had a ten spot and some change. 蔜he only real benefit of lots of business travel is getting to try cool places like this one. 蔜he newsstand, candy counter at the entrance is like a time warp.

Completely and totally awesome. I try to never miss this place when I am in LA. 蔛tepping through the doors is like taking a trip back in time. 蔛tep up to the counter and give your order to the woman dressed in a 1950s era uniform. 蔛elect a meat for THE original french dip sandwich and maybe a side dish. 蔊et you tiny glass of lemonade circa 1950 size or a 10 cent cup of coffee and stroll across the saw dust covered floors to your table. Now, kickback and enjoy watching a cross section of LA . 蔜he sandwiches are very good, but a little small. 蔜he real draw for me is the great vibe in this place. 蔒aybe I am tired of the cookie cutter Chili's style franchise restaurants, but I am totally enamored by this gem that has been around since 1908.

Dodger fans unite!!! Here is where I always stop to grab a bite to eat before a dodger game. I absolutely love the atmosphere and if you have time to walk around after you eat, then Chinatown is nearby. I have yet to try their breakfast, but their sandwiches are really good. I always order two since I want to stuff up on food before the game. I usually order a beef dip and a lamb dip. My cousin had blue cheese in his lamb dip and he loved it. I think I am going to try that next time. The prices are very reasonable and for the taste I think it is a must for anyone near LA. For the price of one person eating at the dodger game you can feed two people at Phillippe's Restaurant. It is a great experience to come here with someone who has never been here. I would recommend avoiding it during the lunch rush and around an hour or two before a dodger game. Just come here around 3 hours before the game and enjoy a walk in Chinatown or head early to watch some BP at Chaves Ravine. Enjoy this gem in Los Angeles.

Yum. 蔍 really liked this place. 蔄fter an afternoon of walking all over downtown, while I was in Chinatown, I wanted to check this place out, especially after I read all of the reviews. 蔉iance and I needed an afternoon snack and this was the place to go. 蔠e took the dash bus to get here and it drops you out right in front. 蔍t wasn't very crowded, and sure smelled good. 蔠e ordered a beef sandwich, potato salad, and 2 lemonades. 蔜he sandwich was nice, especially with some hot mustard, great potato salad, and fresh lemonade. 蕋he only thing I did not like was that the sandwiches don't come with a little cup of au jus, which is what I am used to. 蔇ecent prices and yummy sandwiches, definitely a place to stop when you are in Chinatown. 蔄nd the best part, when we left the restaurant, the bus was there waiting, so we just hopped on again. 蔊otta love public transit.

I lived in LA for 28 years and never took notice of this place or had the desire to go there, I'm not saying I've never heard of Philippe's, who hasn't? We had a few things to do in downtown yesterday and said this would be the day we check Philippe's out. After waiting 45 minutes in line we ordered the most tastiest roast beef sandwiches we ever tasted. Everything about the place was awsome. It's been there for over 100 years and you can tell. Nice old place with great food. Excellent prices but cash only.

I love roast beef sandwiches and they have a good one here! If you come for lunch during the week, come early as you have to stand in line to order. We were lucky and got there early and it wasn't crowded. The beef was great, my wife had a turkey and I tried some of hers and it was good too. We got a side of col-slaw. I really liked it because it was very sweet. Some my not like that taste in their slaw, but I do. We arrived from the foothills on the Metro and did not have to worry about parking. Very casual.

It is what it is. A landmark sandwich place. everyone should try when coming to LA. I wasn't too impressed but then again this is a place that has stayed the same for decades. So in saying this you have to admire the continued success of this establishment. French Dip sandwiches, I tried the Lamb sandwich and they cut the lamb right off the bone in front of you. It was really tasty and the horseradish sauce was potent but good. Once is enough though for me, the line gets pretty ridiculous for this place.

if it was just the sandwich itself I would just give it 3 stars. the sides bumped it up a star! when was the last time I had a baked apple? the lines were long which is always a good sign. I stuck with the obvious choice -beef-although they other meat choices like turkey or lamb and I can't remember what else. �the sandwiches are small so if you are a pig like me 2 will do. I got mine double dipped which by the end of the last bite my bread was totally soggy and falling apart. does anyone know if they would provide some extra dip in a cup?

I recently watched a PBS documentary on "The Sandwich," and this place flooded back into my mind (it was too bad they didn't feature Philippe's, but that's beside the point). 蔄nyway, when I was growing up in the San Gabriel Valley, this was my favorite restaurant to go to with my grandpa on Saturdays. 蔜he French dip is absolutely delicious, and there really isn't any other place quite like Philippe's in the greater Los Angeles area. 蔍 don't know if I am over romanticizing it (being that haven't been back since I was about 14-years-old and I am now 26), but I do remember it being amazing. 蔔ext time I'm at home I am definitely dropping by Philippe's to see if it's held up over the years!

So this time around, I had the Beef French Dip and boy was it tasty!! We came here today afternoon during lunch time. There was about a 10 minute wait, but the ladies behind the counter work really fast in getting everyone's orders through quick. I'm usually very skeptical about ordering fruit salad, but I gave it a shot. Most of the time, the top fruits will be fresh and the bottom ones wouldn't taste right, however that was not the case this time. The fruits were all fresh!! This time I used the hot mustard again, but I made sure not to overdo it. Definitely another wonderful experience!! 蔕ne other thing.....it's CASH only.

So me and my P.I.C. decided to go on a day trip up to LA. I saw this place on tv and we decided to check it out. WOW! Sawdust on the floor, very interesting choice of decor on the walls. The place is over a hundred years old so hey can't complain to much about it. We ordered the Lamb sandwich, Beef sandwich, Pickled Egg, Potato Salad, Tortilla Soup, and the Beef Stew. All I can really say was it was OK. Not something I would crave and drive up to LA to have but hey it was worth the experience. Some 'regulars' told us to check out the upstairs area, DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME. It's just like classrooms but you can sit and eat your food there. Nothing to spectacular. It was OK, if you want to check it out do so...not something I would say is a must.

The french dip here is OK. Not the best french dip I've ever had and it's a bit small for the price you pay, but its definitely tasty and is a good place to come satisfy a french dip craving, which surprisingly I get alot. The real winner of this place though is the mustard. I consider my self the president of the horseradish fan club. I eat horseradish with everything and sometimes I even like to just smell horseradish. So when I doused my french dip with the mustard here, I did not expect to be knocked back as much as I was. It was serious pain. But pain that was incredibly wonderful. I will come back just to experience it again.

i don't want to seem bias towards east coast sandwiches which im not, so let me write an overdue review on Philippes. we discovered Phillipes about 5 years ago when we were going to chinatown. since then we've gone a handful of times about once a year and while i'm not a huge fan of the french dip the wife is. i remember the first time i walked in Phillipes and something felt very familiar about it from the inside decor to the way they take your order and you can't help take notice how busy they always are no matter what day of the week. we've tried the single, double and wet beef to the lamb with and without the swiss, no dip with au jus on the side and i prefer the double dip beef w/o cheese. the beef and au jus has so much flavor that it doesn't need much and its more traditional. the sides are hit and miss depending on ingredients/seasonings and where they settle in the trays. i'd rather get a 2nd sandwich with a side of kosher pickles since one dip always leaves me in weird place of, i could have another half or a full sandwich. one thing with Phillipe and its always on the top of my critic list whenever i go back to any place, consistency. yeah you could argue its a slow beef roast, how can anyone mess it up, but 蕋hey can. every time we go it always-always the same from the taste and texture of their meat, to the flavour of the au jus and softness of their bread and the only reason for the 4 stars i don't crave french dips like i do other sandwiches. i just wished they made a beef brisket dip and maybe i'd crave Phillipes more. =)

Eh. It's okay. The bread is fresh the meat is tender and well seasoned. The ingredients should create a great sandwich. Yet as a whole it's just so forgettable. Langer's #19. That is an incredible sandwich. This is not.

Decent sandwich as far back as I can remember. Yep! it's still got the same taste to it. But now I have a couple more tasting sensory to know better. You can't beat its price. Their French Dipped sandwich offers the best price/quality you can find in LA.

So let me first start off by saying that, this is the first time i've been here and the last. A couple of days ago my boyfriend and I we're in town and decided to try this place. Considering that we aren't from the LA area I decided to call when I was in the Chinatown area. The lady on the phone was not nice. I told her I'm not from here and I needed help getting there. She told what street she was on and that she was near the union station. Well, that's nice but I have no idea where the union station is and on top of that I was on one of the crossing street but I needed help finding the other. After about 2 more questions to help me out and 2 useless answers, she just finally said "WE'RE IN LA, OK!" and hung up... WOW!!!! what a very nice lady I might say. Very nice. After finally giving up trying to find this place on foot we just hoped in the in car and used the gps. We got to Phillippe's; starving. It wasn't really packed but there was plenty of people in there. We waited about 2 mins and ordered our food. Our lovely server didn't pay attention to what we ordered, didn't care what we had to ask, and also over charged us. Getting irritated, we just dropped it and tried not to let it get to us and ruin our meal. Well, honestly there was nothing to really ruin. The bread was stale tasting, meat was tasteless (like something I can get at the grocery store in one of those lunch meat things), potato salad and custard was tasteless, and the only thing good was honestly the yellow peppers we asked for and the mustard. I couldn't even taste the au jus on the bread. And this was all when we were starving, I mean shouldn't food taste better when your hungry? I guess not at this place.. So either it was really bad, or I just came on a bad day. But, I did email this place, and I haven't heard anything back. I guess they don't care. Oh well, this is one place I'm not going back to, nor am i recommending it. So much for the TV hype.

Phillipes has the goodies if you're into french dipped sandwiches and good cheap lemonade. Their wasabi like mustard is a must as well cause that's what you gotta wash the lemonade down with to make it that much better. Just stick to the sandwiches. Haven't been here for breakfast yet though

OLD SCHOOL! What a great piece of LA history! As baseball season arrives this is a restaurant that you have to keep in mind as you head towards Dodger Stadium. It's quick and simple and nothing too fancy. In fact it's supposed to be that way from the moment you step into line and order a French dip with side of potato salad. They have family style communal seating which can be interesting at times, but be sure not to rush right out after eating. Take your time and wonder around the entire room because there is much to see. Once you walk around and look at all of the history you will see that this place is really a museum more than a restaurant. Only in New York will you find a restaurant with such history. The sandwiches aren't half bad either roast beef, pork, and lamb. The mustard is the reason to come down be sure to take a jar home with you. They are the original recipie. Long live Phillipe's!!

2.5 stars this place was SUCH a big disappointment. I was so excited to come here, but the sandwiches just did not meet my expectations. I got the beef sandwich with swiss, my cousin got the pork sandwich with jack cheese and we both got it single dipped. We also ordered a side of the potato salad and a slice of banana cream pie. I don't know I just wasn't expecting the sandwiches to taste so... normal (best word i could find). like it wasn't so amazing and i definetly think this place is SOOOO overrated. and the lines are confusing, but the food comes out fast. not to mention their canned soda was kinda cold. the temperature felt like they barely put in a new batch ten minutes ago. but overall this place was not that great and i don't plan on coming back if i'm ever in town.

tr巗 bien. their lamb and beef dip sandwiches are simply delicious. i could eat like 8 of them if i tried then proceed to eat some more. i love their chili as well. the simple, clean design of this place and it's history makes it all the more enjoyable to eat at. be prepared to wait but it'll be worth it.

This is such a great place for low maintenance food, and their dips are so friggin' good. I usually get the turkey dip with swiss cheese, the baked apple (ask them how long ago they baked them, though, because the cold ones are **not** as good and they don't have a way to reheat them) and pasta salad. Mmmmmm, my mouth is watering as I think about it. Hints for newcomers: there is more than one line, so if you enter and get stuck behind a bunch of hesitant people, move through them and go stand between the tables in another line. Also--bring cash.

I love this place and have been coming here for years with my grandparents. I absolutely love the lamb and pork French dip but not crazy about the beef. The cheesecake and potato salad are both awesome sides. Love the potato salad because it's not huge chunks of potatoes. Will always come to this place for the lamb and the pork, the ambiance and the mustard!

I am giving Phillippe the Original 3 stars not necessarily for the food but the atmosphere. We ordered the standard French Dip, it was ok, not great and nothing to write home about. However, it was just a fun place to go. While we waited in line we had the cutest couple behind us in line, I'm guessing they were in their late 80's. We got to talking with them and found out that the gentleman's father use to bring him when he was just a little boy, he had fond memories of those times with his dad when coke was a mere .5 cents. The history of this place is a great conversation 蕄iece. The tables are long high tops, and they do have some low ones as well. I enjoyed a nice glass of red wine while my husband had a beer, chatting with those around us. Sawdust on the floor, lots of conversation and a historic diner was more enjoyable than the food.

i've come here several times over the years and it's still as good as the first time i tried it. had a lamb with blue cheese, double-dipped (gotta get it double dipped!!) with a side of french onion soup. both were good! though the lines can get a little long it usually moves fairly quickly and there's plenty of seating either downstairs or upstairs. sure you pay a little bit for the historic nostalgia that permeates from this place but it is a good sandwich... it won't be mind blowing if that's what you're looking for (aka #19 at langers with extra russian dressing)...

Ohhhhh, this is the best serious finger food ever! Lip smackin' delicious is what the Double-dipped Roast beef sandwiches are! I am 33 and have been coming here with my dad since the age of 2! This food is greeaaat! The restaurant is so nostalgic and better than a museum, actually, part of it is a museum! Anyway, stop in and order a double-dipped roast beef sandwich, along with a frigid Dad's Rootbeer! There are too many wonderful things about this place to review! If you like to watch the LA Dodgers, USC, or UCLA, then this is the spot to be at! The location is in the northeast quadrant of downtown very close to Union Station and famous Olvera Street.

After seeing this place on the food network soo many times I finally got to experience it for myself, and it lived up to the hype! You can definitely feel the nostalgia when you walk in; old school telephone booths, wood chips and a walk up counter that takes cash only. I wouldn't mind if they updated the registers to accept credit, but there is an ATM machine on site. I got the beef dip with jack cheese. The meat was tender and the jus was so flavorful. Not a fan of hot mustard, so skipped that. The sandwich didn't need it anyway. Also tried the macaroni salad which was nothing special in my opinion, but the cheesecake was yummy! Smooth and creamy and not too sweet, perfect. Beer and other drinks were cheap including the ice tea and lemonade which was nice. Lines were long and seating a bit crowded, but that's to be expected when visiting a historic LA landmark. Delicious and cheap sandwich. yum.

I've lived in the Los Angeles area all my life and I believe that Philippe's is good for what it is. Nothing more, nothing less. I agree with the reviews that say that their French-dipped sandwiches are just OK but I believe that this place should be given the respect it deserves because well, it's is a part of the heart and soul of Los Angeles and it has been here for a very long time. This is why I say that you must visit Philippe's at least once to experience this place for what it's about. 蔣ea, their sandwiches are so-so, but nonetheless they still are good. I would say to try and it out and speak for yourself.

Old school classic that always makes me feel like I've stepped into a time machine and gone back to what LA must have looked like in the 40's. 蔋ere's a tip if you are with a party of 6 to 8 and you want a little privacy ....try their upstairs rooms. Some are just big enough for a party that size,which allows you to enjoy your friends or family without having somebody back into you and spill a tray full of food on your head.

This place is way overhyped. I've been hearing about it for years, but only recently did I find myself in the area so I gave it a shot. 蔉irst, the place is depressing. Yes, it's been around since Moses was in pre-school, but no one has bothered to remodel anything so it just looks so dilapidated. Second, they would not give me any au jus: "The bread has already been dipped." Didn't look like it. The sandwich was just average. It tasted okay but looked pathetic. Yes, the lemonade is 15 cents, but the glass is smaller than my fist. I hated how the mustard was in jars on the table. They looked unsanitary and grubby. Oh, the service was apathetic too. There was no line. People just crowded around the counter and ordered. Won't be returning here.

I love love LOVE this place! I have dreams of Philipe's, only to wake up hungry and sad because I can't have it right away. My fav combo is the double dipped lamb sandwich with potato salad, chili straight (no beans) and a lemonade. FYI for those who don't know what double dipped means, the counter girl with dip each side of your french bread in awesome juice aka au jous before constructing your finished sandwich. Totally worth it and for the cost of the change under your carseat (practically).

Another one of those LA institution type places. I'd probably say that Philippe's is a bit more hype-over-substance than somewhere like say Langer's across the way. However, the french dip is still pretty damn good. And if you like spicy, the hot mustard sauce will definitely bring tears to your eyes and clear your sinuses. And really, you gotta love a place that has been part of the community for so long. One negative is that it's cash only, but it's located in Chinatown, so what do you expect??

Philippe has a lot of history... right? Forgive me, fellow Angelinos/as for previously not knowing about this historical restaurant. 蔜he first time I heard about it was on some television show on Food Network. 蔜hen, I realized that I lived right down the street from it, so my three roommates and I decided to head out after a late night of studying nearby at the USC health sciences campus. Because I hadn't heard much about it, I didn't come expecting much. �Unfortunately, this feeling was still there after the meal was finished. �I ordered a beef sandwich with a side of potato salad and a lemonade. 蔠hen I asked for a side of au jus, I was told that they didn't serve any on the side. 蔠hat kind of Beef Dip doesn't serve a side of au jus on the side? 蔄nyway, I sat down, and split half of my beef sandwich with my roommate, who ordered a lamb sandwich and gave me half of his. 蔖ersonally, I thought the beef was somewhat dry (which wouldn't have been an issue if I had gotten some au jus). 蔜he lamb tasted much more juicy and tender. 蔜he potato salad was pretty good but nothing to write home about. I will say that the hot mustard was pretty amazing. 蔄nd that it complimented both sandwiches quite well. 蔅ut when the best part of the meal is the condiment, it doesn't speak very well for the food itself. Now I do understand that Philippe is an LA original and that I shouldn't bash it completely. 蔠ith that said, I would definitely take friends from out of town there to check out a piece of LA history. 蔅ut definitely not LA food.

I mean it's not the best french dip I've had. That would be at Houston's, which uses prime rib. But it's kinda fun, tasty cafeteria type of french dip and food. Except you don't get your own au jus to dip yourself. I prefer the lamb sammich. The cole slaw is sweet and good. The potato salad is pretty good. It's kinda cheesy and old skool. It's comfort food. Yeah, that's it. And the mustard has such a bite.

I was on the road with my wife looking for a new resturant to try, I thought " hey why not try Philippe's?". Once we got there we were so excited by all the hoopla that everyone says about this place we couldnt bare it. My wife wife ordered a pork sandwich and I had the beef. To my surprise it was very expensive and nothing too special to be honest. I truely believe that Philippe's is an overrated restaurant that has nothing more than history involved in its popularity. Maybe if the sandwiches were like $3 or $4 it would have been worth my while. But then again, i just received an email from my best friend, Philippe's was shut down for a few days due to pest control, gross. I will definitely never go back to Philippe's ever again, but I know who will.....but you just might not be able to see them when the lights are on.

Okay, so you know they're supposed to have the best french dips ever. You know this is supposed to be where the french dip originated. You know there will be an hour or two line during any time of the day. But what you really want to know is: is it worth it? The answer? YES.

Phillipe The Original is a great place to satisfy that craving for a simple yet tasty and hearty sandwich. The employees are very friendly and more than willing to help, especially for newbies. I tried the most popular Beef french dip and did not disappoint. The restaurant is a la carte so I also grabbed other goodies like the potato salad and the custard dish for dessert. I can honestly say that im definitely not a fan of the potato salad. It had way to much vinegar for me. And the custard looks more appetizing that it actually was. It was mildly bland. over all Phillipe is great sandwich shoppe with good prices but I would only buy if Im in the area, not worth going across town just to pick up a sandwich.

This was one of the first places that the Definitely-Meant-To-Be �DMTB)and I had ever eaten at together. This place is old school authentic, from the sawdust on the floor, to the candy counter and 50's phone booth. Make sure that you don't come here too hungry, as there is always a line here, especially on days when the dodgers are playing. The beef dip, macaroni salad, and banana cream pie was just the right amount of food. While not exactly stellar, their food was far better than I was expecting from a counter serving such a high volume of orders at the rate that they were. I was glad to take DMTB here. The old school ambience and the hustle and bustle of people made for a perfect setting to have a nice conversation.

i got the beef with blue cheese, double dipped. i also got a coke, some chips, and piece of chocolate cake. came out to $12 bucks and some change! the sandwiches are good, but not great enough (or big enough, for that matter) to start off at $6. the coke was a coke, and the chips were chips. the chocolate cake? off the hook. it was delicious (though i don't think ill get that again since it was $3.25 i believe, and it was a really small slice). the only complaint that i have is the service, and really just the lady that i got. being the first time that id been there, i didn't know that they expect tips (cmon, $6 for a sandwich!). my friend ordered first, and when she grabbed her change, the lady's face turned sour, and she started being rude. when it came my turn to order, she started off nice, but when i went to get my change, she started giving me dirty looks. so now i know they expect tips. ill be back to give this place another try... ill get a different sandwich and different person to prepare it. I'm sure Philippe can get at least 4 stars from me.

Come on people! It isn't thaaaat great. It's a lot of hype with very little bite. There's always a ridiculous wait here. It doesn't matter what time you come, be prepared to wait.

these sandwiches.. an orgasm for your taste buds. �fresh, tender, soft bread, made to fall apart in your mouth and go into your tummy heaven. the sides however.. could use some serious adjustments. 蕋he potato and macaroni salad taste exactly the same, and the coleslaw isnt too far off. �i liked the coleslaw the best of them all though, and even though the sandwiches need no improvements, i tried coleslaw on it just to see.. and it's a nice little twist to an already amazing sandwich. �but anyways, go here for the sandwiches and not the sides. �the pricing.. i believe it was sandwiches 5.75 sides 1.25 drinks .65 that's pretty good to see can't wait to go back!.. on a less busy day, although it seems like this place is always busy, and you just hope you go in and pick the right line.

It was pretty good. We got a beef and a lamb sandwich, both double dipped. We also added blue cheese to the beef. The sandwiches were both pretty good. I'd say the beef was slightly on the dry side, so anyway you go the double dip is a necessity. I can't say the lamb meat had much flavor, the flavor seems to come from the au jus. My partner liked the lamb the best, while I preferred the beef. But there's a good chance the blue cheese had a role in that decision. We each had half of both and shared a side of coleslaw which was good as well and a kosher dill pickle. Add 2 iced teas and the total came to like $19. Which to me was a bit high considering I was still hungry.

Love it! The lines can be pretty intense, but I think it's worth it. Even the security guard in the parking lot added to the fun. The beef dip sandwich was really good, and I personally loved the mustard. It's got that wasabi zing to it from the horseradish, so it's not for everyone. They are really well priced (some of their items, like coffee, are RIDICULOUSly cheap! 9c!) and they've got the system down pat after so long. It's just a place you need to try at least once in LA, and once you try it once...

I've been going here ever since I was really little. I remember every once in a while going here with the parents and the family and really liking the stuff here. I just never understood what the hype and lines were for. The sandwiches are really good, but not "spectacular". I feel bad that I'll only give this place 3 stars because I've had some great family memories there. The only place that we have all eaten at where everyone was happy really. The beef dip is really really good. That is what I normally get and I really like putting the hot mustard on it. I also like that the building this restaurant is in used to be an old catholic school house, and you can tell because the upstairs is a series of rooms that the place put tables and chairs in. Parking is a drag too as there's really just two lots that have security guards, and I guess you can try to find some street parking. Lots of Olvera Street traffic there, and Union Station is nearby too, so you run into that traffic as well. I think that this place is worth it if you're new to LA or if you're in LA visiting or on vacation. Otherwise, try to go there on a week day or when most people are at work. That way the people have died down.

I always order the double dipped beef sandwich, lemonade and coffee. The spicy mustard is excellent. This is a great place to people watch, with an interesting mix of blue collar workers, office types and tourists. 蔜hey have a small "train museum" with model trains - really more of a display case along one wall, but it keeps my son interested. This is a great place for a sandwich within walking distance from Union Station. 蔍 try to avoid peak times (noon) when the crowds can be a bit overwhelming and instead opt for an early or late lunch.

Talk about authentic. 蔜his place is coming up on it's 100 year anniversary, and the building and the staff both are dripping in authenticity. 蔜he sandwiches are dripping as well because... well.. they're all french dipped. 蔖hillippe's invented the french dip and they certainly do it right. 蔜he food is delicious. 蔔ot only are the sandwiches to die for, they have great sides and an amazing potato salad that's straight out of my grandmother's 1952 kitchen. The atmosphere is straight out of the past as well - the building is a former speakeasy and I doubt much has changed since the 20's. 蔜here's sawdust on the floor, and most people sit at long wooden tables (though there are a few booths) 蔜he staff seems as old as the building and they still wear those wonderful coffee shop uniforms. 蔜he customers span the entire gamut of LA, from lawyers and city council members to Hollywood industry types to construction workers.

I have loved this place since I was a kid and my dad took me for their French dip sandwiches. 蔜he food is consistently delicious and I am sure that Philippe has been the place of billions of dollars in M&A and buyouts as it is not a place that one would traditionally think of to do business, but they have great food and those who bill 300 hour months, like eating. 蔈xpect to wait in line during the week for sure (I have no idea on weekends) and it is a place you must try if you like French dips and visit or live in Los Angeles. The dress code varies as much as the clientele with reasonable prices, just do not expect tofu burgers wrapped in organic totally recycled paper. �You may want to hit the gym for a few hours but this place is great and very reasonably priced.

Let's make this clear. 蔍 don't like waiting in lines. 蔍n fact, I don't like doing anything in lines (with the possible exception of dancing). 蔅ut on many afternoons, I feel like that light (actually a lamb sandwich dripping with au jus) at the end of the Philippe lunch line is well worth my suffering. 蔠hen I sit down with that simple, classic LA delicacy comprised of just meat and bread, I marvel at how moist the red meat core could remain without weighing down the bread, making it soggy, or just causing the sandwich to fall apart altogether. 蔜hrow in a baked apple (which is like apple sauce in the shape of an actual apple) and an iced tea, and you've got yourself a meal that's been good enough to feed a century's worth of downtown city dwellers.

I don't get the hype.

Like a lot of other people, I went here because I'd seen it on the Food Network. Twice. So I was curious to try their french dip sandwich. I tried both the beef and the lamb. Maybe if I had requested double dipped -- but the single dip lamb was somewhat dry (but still good). I also liked their (very pricy) deviled eggs. It was one of the best deviled eggs I've had. In short? Decent food, way overpriced. You won't feel like you've been cheated (in that the food is not too bad), but I can get equally good food for much cheaper elsewhere.

we bought two livingsocial coupons for phillppe. $5 for $10 worth of food. my guy read the yelp review prior to us buying the coupons and after experiencing this place..i feel like yelp had really misled us. for all you people giving 4 and 5 stars...WHY?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!? this place totally reminded me of katz in new york. there were multiple lines you could get in, and they would prepare your food. apparently the line i got in was the SLOWEST possible moving one. it also doesn't make sense that they would handle the money at the counter when they're all walking over to the cashier in the back?? why wouldn't they just have the cashier located elsewhere so the food people could prepare the food and move people along. we ordered 3 french dips: lamb, pork, and beef. also got a bowl of beef stew b/c this guy said it was amazing, and a bowl of chili. i saw someone else pick up a chocolate cream pie, so we got one of those too. french dips: DRY AS F. DRY DRY DRY DRY DRY MEAT. dipping dry meat doesn't FIX dry meat. it shouldn't be overcooked in the first place. i was really really really disappointed in how dry it was. i really don't understand why there are 4 and 5 star ratings, especially if it's for the dips. i liked the lamb the best, but all three were SUPER SUPER SUPER DRY. that's one of the things i hate the most, dry meat/overcooked food. chili w/ beans: delicious! would've been better if topped with shredded cheddar cheese though. this would've been great on fries, burgers, and hot dogs too. one bowl is way too much chili for one sitting though. beef stew: flavor was pretty good, but this definitely is NOT a stew. it's like my mom's beef vegetable soup but missing a lot of liquid. it's overly packed with vegetables and there's not enough soup. stew is also supposed to have a thicker consistency...i think they just mislabeled their dish and forgot to put more broth in it. chocolate cream pie: TASTY!!! would recommend so...to sum it up...i would NOT recommend this place to anyone, nor do i have the desire to return. i don't dislike it so much that i wouldn't accompany a friend here...but i definitely wouldn't bring it up. for a bomb ass french dip...go to one of the houston's restaurants http://www.hillstone.com/ i've had the french dip at houston's in irvine and bandera in corona del mar...the meat is cut from their prime rib...super super juicy and tasty

I'm not a particularly big fan of beef sandwiches (often dry, tasteless, and dry again) but phillipe's has won me over with their double dipped beef sandwiches! I've been wanting to try this place for a while now (being a historical LA institution) and am now a Phillipe's fan. Watch out for the hot mustard sauce though--that thing will clear your sinuses right up! The chili is great too--good flavor and consistency. I heard this place gets PACKED, but we were lucky enough to come on an off hour. I'll definitely be back to try the pork sandwich!

i got the pork sandwich double dipped with a side of potato salad and an iced tea. 蔵 was worried that the double dipped sandwich might be too soggy for my liking but i was surprised when the sandwich wasnt soggy at all. 蕋he food was great, the pork was really tender and tasty and the bread was fresh. 蕋he potato salad was great as well, and i would definitely recommend it. 蕋he sandwich tasted best with some of their spicy mustard. 蕋he only real downsides of this place were the ridiculously long lines, the crazy parking situation and the fact that it's cash only. 蔵 would definitely eat here again, though. 蔵 also tried some of my friend's lemonade and i would definitely get that instead of the tea next time.

Philippe's is a great place to get a bit of good food (the famous french dip sandwich) from a L.A. landmark & staple for decades. 蔄bout a block from Union Station, Philippe's is, too famous for their tight but cozy atmosphere where you can stand in line, get to know once strangers who mesh with a common interest, then eat w/ others ~ it's fun! 蔇on't expect to be rushed thru for your 30-minute break ~ Philippe's is a gathering place of great people & food, so expect to take 蕋ime to make a friend or two and leave full (both physically & emotionally as well). 蔣OU'LL BE HAPPY YOU CAME .. a be sure to take home a bottle or two of HOT MUSTARD ~ a little goes a long way, but fantastic on egg rolls when you, too visit CHINATOWN .. just a walk, skp & a jump away. 蔍sn't L.A. just marvelous?

So I've going passing by this place for the past twenty plus years. Yesterday, we decided to finally stop by to see if the hype lived up to it's name. Unfortunately, it's one of those one and done joints. We had the lamb double dip sandwich. It was good, but not great. After all the tv spotlights this place had, we thought it was going to be phenomenal. It turned out to be a moist sandwich, that was good. But I would say, if we had to wait more than 10 mins for it, I would have sign out. Overall, it definitely had a lot of history to it though. The wood chips on the floor made it feel even more old.

i think min wait time is 2 hours. my girld friend and i went doing lunch time. we got there around 1. we were starving. ppl who were waiting in line said it should be around 2 hours. and it was excaclly 2 hours. we werent sure if we shouldve waited (and im glad we did). my gf was pissed that we waited forever but once we got the food and she tried it she loved the place. the wait is definitly worth it. just come prepared to wait in a long line. oh so theres 2 entrances. go in and look inside to see which way line will b the fastest!

I think it was because I was expecting too much. I really didn't like the sawdust floor but I liked how quickly we received our food. The sandwich was not appetizing looking and I was disappointed when I bit into the roast beef and found that it didn't taste any better than what I could've purchased from a grocery store. I wouldn't go back again.

I never miss an opportunity to drop by Philippe's when I am anywhere near downtown LA. This place is frikkin legit. This is my meal: lamb sandwich (double dip), side of macaroni salad, a dill pickle, a pickled egg, and a lemonade. Tapioca or a baked apple for dessert. The candy/newstand and the neon signs they sport are bitchen too. I wish there was something like this in San Francisco........sigh.

I finally tried Phillipes and it was not what I was expecting. I have seen this place on the Food network and the travel channel so I wanted to give it a shot the next time I was in L.A. Well it took a while but I finally made it. I arrived to find most of L.A. waiting in line. After standing in line for about 30 minutes I ordered and took my food through the gauntlet of people and found a table. I took my first bite of my pork French dip and found it to be mooshy and a bit to dark tasting for me. I then tried a bite of the beef and it was more of the same. After finishing about half of each sandwich I was done with my Phillipes experience and had had enough. 蔖lease explain to my why people flock here like it's the greatest thing on earth? The food is just not good. I would much rather have had Arbys then this place. And by the way I did try the mustard and it was much of the same. Not much flavor with WAY to much burn. This stuff cleared my whole head with one tinny taste. I think I will forgo Phillipes from now on. �蔍 am updating this before I post it. I wrote it on my iPhone and saved it until I got home. Well, the day after I went to Phillipes I stopped at a sandwich place about a mile away from Disneyland to grab something for the drive home. I of course found it on my Yelp app and it had great reviews. This place was INCREDIBLE!!!! Its called Kookies on Ball st. It was so good I almost turned around and bought another sandwich after I was about 15 miles away. 蔍f anyone trying Phillipes wants a REAL sandwich try Kookies. This place was just fantastic. Phillipes on the other hand was not.

This is a classic place to come for lunch. I like to go in the morning and beat the lunch crowd. French dip is good but I ask for a double dip so its more moist and not as dry. The coffee is cheap 9cents thats why they have so many chinese senior citizens at 9am. 蔜he sides are good too, not great but decent for a $1.10. 蔍 like that they have airconditioning, and the cops and trafiic guys dont give tickets as much around here although they have plenty of free parking!!

I came to philippe's today expecting a great lunch after reading all the great reviews. The decor and 蔲urnishings were really 蕂ld school and nice. I thought it was a great setting. The place was super clean. Props to the staff! When I l"lined" up to get one of their french dip sandwiches, it was very much like a butcher shop. Where does the line start? I just learned to find a nonbusy lady. While I was ordering, I saw a fly flying around the potato salad. Here's the thing, it was in, not a sneeze guard, but the glass thing you see at butcher store where they store the meat. Yeah, a fly was zooming around inside! My love for potato salad ended there. I couldn't bare to ask for some. As I took a look at my sandwich, I figured it was bare. So I tossed in some mustard. BIG MISTAKE! It smelled like wasabi and tasted like it. The smell started to burn my nose. But i managed to wipe it off the meat. By the way, I got a beef with swiss. I thought the beef was lacking and the swiss tasted old. I've had some pretty good swiss. This was not it. But the bread was ok. Gotta love my carbs.

Not bad, but somewhat overrated. Breakfast is pretty good and a lot of Downtown locals come by to enjoy a cup of 9 cents coffee and the nostalgia of the place. It looks like it hasn't changed since it opened it's doors in 1908 ! Worth a trip for breakfast or their famous french dip sandwiches and a cup of 'joe'. Service can be very slow as each order is made while waiting. If you come here, be patient !

If you are looking for a french dip sandwich then this is the place. I tried the beef sandwich and also the lamb sandwich with a slice of banana cream pie for dessert. I would recommend the meat sandwich it was tasty, the lamb was ok. The sandwich comes plain with the meat and the bread soaked in au ju sauce. Be careful of the mustard though because it is the most purest mustard that I have ever tried. The pickles was also crunchy, But I liked the banana cream pie, you must definately save room for the pie is a must!

Nothing like grabbing a French dip here before watching the Blue Crew kick some ass. Why only 4 stars? I don't know if Philippe's really invented the French dip, but even if they did, I've tasted better French dip sandwiches at eateries including, but not limited to: Norm's, Palos Verdes Country Club, Fantastic Cafe, and Denny's. And I didn't have to be herded toward the counter like swine about to be slaughtered by a metal rod! Then again, they didn't have 50 cent lemonade and their own brand of spicy mustard. Nor was I giddy for a baseball game.

I love this place. Had high expectation since I've seen this place being featured on TV like 10 times. The lady that helped us on the counter was super sweet and helpful, knowing it was my first time. She has been there for 17 years. She recommended the cole slaw, potato salad, and the pickled egg to to with the beef dip my partner and I got. The bread was still a bit crusty even though it was dipped in the au jus, giving it a nice texture. There are enough meat in the sandwich. The potato salad is perfect.... and the pickled egg (purple egg) is surprisingly tasty. Lunch for 2 sandwiches (5.75 for the beef dip), egg salad, chips, cole slaw, potato salad, and custard cost $22. A great deal!!

I liked my meal. The meat itself wasnt super but the whole sandwich came together well. I ordered the pork sandwich single dipped with two pickled eggs and a can of coke. The eggs rocked! if your a fan of pickled anything they do it right! I was so impressed on their customer service, We got lost so i called and the girl on the phone looked on a map to help us find our way, once there i saw the line and thought i should probably pitch a tent and start drinking some beer, the line was so fucking long it was crazy however i didnt wait more then 4 min. Once ordered it took all of 30 seconds to get my entire order! It was insane. Every single job is done by a single person with ease and no confusion. Ill be back here, i might even buy a shirt! P.S.

Major deliciousness!!! 蔍've been here a few times, but each time has always seemed so long ago from the next. �To everyone who has not yet had Philippe's: 蕐ou must get your sandwiches at least double-dipped! 蔔ext time, I will try triple-dipped!!! 蔠hy is there not a full dip option? Or better yet just ask them for a side of sauce so you can drench it yourself! Dang, why didn't I think of that when I was there? 蔒y favorite is always the beef. 蔍'll admit I'm not much of a lamb person, as I fear the strong lamb taste or if its not cooked a very specific way. 蔋owever, we ordered 1 beef & 1 lamb both double-dipped. 蔜he lamb was good, and did not have much of a strong lamb taste at all. 蔋onestly, I could barely tell it was lamb becaue it was so juicy and tender. 蔣ou've got to eat every bite of your sandwich with the hot mustard.....And if you happen to have a stuffy nose, you will totally get your sinus cleared up! The only thing is that its Cash Only, and today, I fortunately had a $20 which was enough to buy our 2 sandwiches, 1 side of macaroni salad, 1 lemonade for 0.75 cents, and 1 coffee for 0.9 cents! hahah.. The Best French Dipped sandwiches!!!

Just went to Philippe's again for probably the hundredth time. 蔈very time I return, I remember why I love this place so much. 蔍t goes beyond the fact that I spent countless family meals consuming Philippe's unique comfort food; beyond the fact that some of my earliest family memories are linked to either being here, traveling here from my grandparents' house in Eagle Rock via San Fernando Road (maneuvering over the old red car tracks), or eating the food at my grandparents' house on Fathers Day; beyond the fact that my mom and dad relay stories of coming here during their lunch when they worked at DWP; beyond the fact that my beloved late Grandpa used to frequent the place when it was located on Aliso. 蔜hat Philippe's is part of my family history goes without saying. 蔅ut the reason I keep coming back is because every time I walk through the doors and brave the long lines, the kind and efficient Carvers prepare me consistently amazing food; and as I take a bite out of the double-dipped pork sandwich and chili beans, I am immediately stricken by how freakin' good this food is. 蔍t's not extravagant, it's nothing fancy. 蔍f you like your sandwiches overstuffed with meat or filled with super-thick slices of same, you will likely be unimpressed with Philippe's. 蔅ut if you like simply good meat served on simply good bread, dipped or double-dipped to perfection--go. 蔣ou will not be disappointed.

Phillippe's gets reallly packed sometimes, ESPECIALLY right before a Dodger game. 蔍 got to experience that first hand -_- However, their sandwiches are good and I would stop by if i was already in the area, but I wouldn't drive out there just to get it. 蔍 always order the double-dipped beef dip sandwich. 蔍 also like to get the au jus sauce on the side. 蔕ne piece of advice- be careful with their hot mustard sauce. I got too excited my first time and I went way overboard. 蔍 felt like I swallowed a spoonful of wasabi. 蔍've also tried their macaroni salad, but it wasn't really anything special. 蔋owever, I surprisingly really liked their banana cream pie! Prices are good and inexpensive. 蔉rom what I remember, their lemonade and iced teas (not sweetened) were dirt cheap. 蔜he only real downside to this place is that it's cash only (but there is an ATM inside) and their freakishly long lines.

Ok so it goes like this. 蔍 was driving around downtown LA and was in the neighborhood, and boy was I parched. 蔇ue to sjogrens, I must have a beverage with me at all times. 蔍 was looking for a 7-11 to get a big gulp. 蔐ow and behold Philippe appeared. 蔍 heard this place was good. 蔅eing a Chicago ex-pat, i figured it was my duty to at least try the beef sandwich. 蔖arking was a pain, Im disabled and even with plates, I could not get a decent spot. 蔍ts confusing going in there trying to figure out which line to get into. 蔝nless you have a telescope, you cannot read the menu until you are right in front one of the 7 or 8 lines. 蔄lthough it was only 2 or 3 in afternoon, it was packed. I thought the beverages were a bit over priced, so I just grabbed a beef sandwich (double dipped cause im from shy town) and went on to a burger king a few blocks away for an all i can drink beverage. 蔔ow 蕋he kid is with me. 蔍 asked him before I got the sandwich if he wanted one or wanted to switch. 蔔o he didnt want one. Nor did he want a beverage from BK. 蔍 forget where we were going, but he didnt really want to stop at all, I guess when you're not hungry or thirsty, you get irked by somebody stopping for refreshments. 蔠e get into BK and cause he's so irked I told him just to sit at the booth with his net book and I'll go stand in line. 蔍 get the kid an ice water and myself a very large very bubbly soda pop. �I personally think fast food places like mcdonalds, wendys and bk have best fountain beverages) 蔍 sit down to open this sandwich and the bread immediately impressed me. 蔍ts one of those extremely thin crusted french type of rolls, where you put your thumb in the side and it crackles. 蔍 love the thin crust bread, I wish I lived in paris and could buy loaves of them every day. 蔜he inside was light and airy, turned out that i didnt really need it to be double dipped, but it was still just fantastic. 蔜he meat was thin sliced and fairly tender, not falling apart. 蔜he meat and au jus were very tasty, but a little bland. 蔍 would have loved some hot gardinare to put on it. 蔈ven some horseradish or pickled jalapeno. 蔍t was still good, and I'd go back if in the neighborhood again. 蔕h by the way, after the kid saw me start eating it, he relieved me of a good half the sandwich and raided my pop as well. Also, I saw tip jar, dont know how much expected, its just somebody making you a sandwich, dont tip bk for that, i felt that I tipped them very generously ( like .70 cents for the one sandwich)

That's a really cool place, at first you are going to see the huge line and you're like wow i dont wanna wait that long, but it goes pretty quick, sandwiches are good, it has nothing French about it tho, the potato salad is amazing, really should get that if you go there !

Delicious way to end a morning in downtown LA. As expected, the sandwiches are amazing (get it with bleu cheese). The side salads were good too, and I highly recommend finishing it off with a slice of pie. They have a nice pie variety - I had trouble settling on lemon. The lines can be long, but I don't really mind because it's such an interesting place. I wish it were a little cheaper though. The price really adds up quickly when you get a lot of food.

Everything on the menu is yummy...the macaroni salad has a nice, light sweetness to it, the chili is think and hearty, the sandwiches can't be beat, and a huge dessert selection! 蔈xpect lines at peak times or after a Dodger game lets out, but the ladies behind the counter are pros!

Philippe's is awesome. I got the beef sandwich double dipped, with potato salad, and a bowl of chili. It was amazing. I loved using the hot mustard as well, each bite was an explosion of flavor in my mouth. I thought the prices were reasonable a meal for two came out to about 20 dollars after sandwiches and sides. I felt extremely satisfied afterwards. Only two blocks north of union station so anytime I use amtrak or metrolink from now on Ill have to stop by and get some Philippe's

their french dip beef sandwiches are the best! I love how the spicy horseradish mustard gives such a kick, I put lots on mine. it hurts so bad, it's so good. =) get it with some potato salad. if you with a few other people, get the larger container potato salad which is more and cheaper that you can split up.

This is a place I have been coming to for years. I suppose all their food is pretty good but I just stick with the basics. Roast beef french dip w/swiss, bag of Ruffles, can of Dr.Pepper and if my diet will allow (it always does) a slice of chocolate pie. You can't go wrong with this combo. My friend swears by the Lamb w/bleu cheese I tried it and wished I ordered the usual. Oh well to each his own. Bring out of towners they will love it.

I think this place is waaay too hyped.. the sandwich is FREAKIN tiny..i can eat two of those. yes the lemonade and coffee are FREAKIN cheap - but hella small. i feel like you get what you pay for - which is cheap but VERY SMALL PORTIONS. and the sandwich is just ok - it's NOT to die for and certainly not worth the wait...i think we waited around 20 min? on a sunday afternoon.

Once you get through the LA traffic, find a place to park, and get through the long lines in the restaurant, the food makes it all worth while. Many people from all nationalities come to sample the world famous french dip sandwiches. and you cant beat the prices. I would suggest you print a menu off line, study it so you know what you want when you get there, but of course you will change your mind many times while you wait in line. Just remember get a sandwich to go, and don't forget the hot mustard, this is a must. Not a place for the impatient person! so leave them at home and just bring them a sandwich :)

a must-snarf for visiting visitors. go back in time at the communal, bar-height tables, with roast beef sandwiches unchanged for half a century. sometimes a trifle fatty, the r.b. sandw. still provides a solid lunch, and even better social setting. for buffs of olde los angeles: check out the historical photos of l.a. and the railroad memorabilia toward the back rooms of the restaurant.

bomb french dips. I tried Beef, Pork, and Lamb (to which i'd rank them in that order, beef being the best) ...but then again, i'm probably biased because i loove beef. pork was right there. lamb was just too chunky (the slices i mean) and was a slight tad dry.. Don't forget to get it DOUBLE-DIPPED if youre into more juice in your sandwich. Potato Salad is great. Tapioca is Amazing! 9 cents for a cup of coffee!!! a decent one at that! better than starbucks!! plus, they serve beer on tap. gahh.. i love it.

I can't believe I haven't reviewed this place sooner. I would normally give this place 4 stars but it gets 5 because the lamb french dip sandwich with spicy mustard is just that damn good. It is filled with all walks of life from opening to close. you can bump into city officials, tourists, bankers and gangbangers all sitting side enjoying an LA original. It's loud and bustling and you have to pick your line correctly. Get behind a group of newbies and you'll be waiting forever. You gots'ta go for one of the dips on your fist time out, or every time (make sure to get them double dipped.) The sides are fine as deli stuff goes. The drinks are small and cheap with no refills so double up. Make sure you put your cash (only) on the little tray to pay. the gloved servers will not touch your money as they take it to the cashier and return with your change. (I give that extra points for style) Finding seating can be challenging if you are there during lunch rush or on a weekend but it's worth it and the cafeteria style seating leaves the opportunity for good people watching. If you haven't already make plans for this place next time you're anywhere near downtown LA.

omg, OMG, omg... I LOVE this place. excellent dips! the best in town! its def my favorite place to eat at in L.A. If you want a fabulous and mouth watering sandwich that will put others to shame come here. When you get your dip make sure its double dipped.. thats the only way to go! :) The bread tastes homemade and even though it becomes soggy it never loses its flavor. The pictures on the wall and the old time seats and long tables are great. it really makes this place standout from the rest. It shows its roots and even though 60 years has gone by, it doesnt need to be updates or changed. Beware though lines are uber long but its well worth it. i dont care if i have to wait 2 hours.. im gonna wait and enjoy every bite of that dip! It hits the spot and i never leave hungry. They're pies are amazing too. The perfect combo is the sanwich and pie, maybe a drink too. I started coming here as a little girl with my family and now that ive started my own family we shall come here too. 5 generations have been here and we've never been disappointed!

I'm in town for work from NYC and my friend brought me here saying it was the best french dip. It's an institution. Well if you want to come for its history then thats fine but if you want to come for the quality of their food I would pass. I have had better french dips anywhere and everywhere else. I ordered a Lamb with au jus on the side and was told they don't offer au jus on the side. What! the dip on the side is a requirement of any good french dip so one can control the amount of soak. Disappointed I requested a "double dip" so i would atleast be sufficiently soaked. The bread was barely wet! they don't dip the bread? it seems like they only dip the meat. FAIL number two. The first bite reveals their au jus is SUPER SALTY. Even my friend who is a local said it was too salty and didn't remember it being that salty when he was younger. (i guess they changed their recipe). FAIL #3. Philippe's has already stuck out but it gets worse. The meat was not a flavorful as lamb should be. All in all the sandwich was bland and salty which is a strange and unpleasant combination. I got a pickled egg on the side but it just tasted like a boiled egg soaked in beat juice. It's false advertising to say they are pickled if they don't pickle the eggs. You want a french dip then go anywhere else even Chili's would be better. If you want to see an old building then drive by on your way to someplace you won't be dissappointed.

My gf got the lamb which tasted exactly the same as the beef but lean and extra dry..and the sauce you dip it with was, Meh. I rather settle for a lee's sandwhich any day.

I went here with a group from Vegas eager to try this place as we'd seen the Man Vs. Food episode highlighting this joint. We were starving, and well-prepared to enjoy this undoubtedly delicious celebration of bovine-ness. All of us ordered the beef sandwich, which we all agreed would be a fair starting point on which to judge the place. I ordered a side of the chicken tortilla soup and a slice of the coconut cream pie, which I always order (or banana cream) if the place offers it. We dug in, we finished the sandwiches, and.......... they were OK. I daresay if we weren't as hungry as we were we might have been tempted to try something else. I remember asking the lady at the counter if she could put the au jus on the side (because I was afraid the sandwich would get soggy) and she said that wasn't possible. Hmm. CONS: I feel like the au jus could have had more flavor. Perhaps getting it double-dipped might have helped, but I tried the bread that WAS dipped and it just wasn't all that tasty. Considering the sandwich is just sliced meat and bread, it depends on the jus to flavor and moisten. Moisten it did, but the flavor just fell short for me. PROS: Cheap and filling fast food. The longest you wait is in line, and it's not really all that long. Some decent sides (pickles, pickled egg, potato salad, chips). My friend ordered the potato salad and it was pretty decent. My other friend ordered the coleslaw and everyone pretty much enjoyed that, it was very fresh tasting and still crunchy. The sandwich was not soggy at all! Surprised about that. The meat portion was decent and surprisingly, I ended up enjoying the chicken tortilla soup and coconut cream pie wayyyy more than I did the actual french dip. I ended up dunking the sandwich into the chicken tortilla soup (sacrilege for some of you, I know) and that actually saved it for me flavor-wise. The cream pie was unlike any I'd tried before at Coco's or Marie Callendar's, usually the custard is cornstarch-based (not a bad thing) and the texture is more jellyish, but this pie at Philippe's has a custard that is textured like an extremely thick whipped cream. Different, tasty, and delicious. I'm open to going back and trying the other kinds (lamb, especially) which some other reviewers mentioned was delicious, and definitely trying it double-dipped next time.

I was pretty disappointed, I was really confused about all of the hype. The sandwich proportion was rather small for $6, it only came with your choice of a cheese and the meat of your choice, nothing special. I think the pre-dipping process just makes for a soggy bread. I really wanted to leave and get that taste out my mouth so badly. They typed up the order and put together the sandwich all with the same ungloved hands.

I've been going here for a very long time - not that often, mainly when I've been in the area. The sandwiches are only average and what redeems them is that hot mustard - slather a little bit on and it really livens up the sandwich. 蔕ther than that, the food is ordinary and prices are slightly on the high side. Parking is a hassle, the lines are long, the wait is long because of the inefficient way they have the ordering system set up, and overall it is only worth going if you are nearby. 蔍t isn't a destination place despite its legendary status.

Drove all the way here on a boring Saturday nigh with nothing else to do. I did want to come here for the longest time but the packed parking lot always prevented that from happening every time that I was in the area. I great thing is that even though the parking lot is small, it is still free as other parking locations in the area are pay only. There is also a security guard on staff securing the parking lot. Even though the restaurant is pretty packed, there is plenty of seating. The menu contains a variety of different items from the famous dipped sandwiches, traditional breakfast items, salads, soups, and side items. A really great thing is that they have homemade lemonade at only .$75, yeah that's right beverage under $1. The other items on the menu are reasonable priced as well. The beef dipped sandwich and potato salad was okay, but not great. I was a bit disappointed that I drove a long distance and wasn't really impressed. I however finally visited this famous LA landmark. A very unique thing about the restaurant is the sawdust on the floor and the train model displays that they have since it is located right in front of LA union station.

I've been eating here my entire life where french dip sandwiches were invented. 蔵n fact, this is the only place i can have french dip sandwiches. 蔳otta stick to the original with a side of cole slaw or potato salad. 蕇ince cole's closed for remodeling, this is now the oldest restaurant in la (continuously at one location).

I came here on a Sunday, crazy busy. 蔍 ended up in the slowest line but that was my fault. 蔇o yourself a favor and go in the middle lines, the line by the entrance (street corner) moved really slow. 蔄fter waiting 35 min to order I got a beef and pork sandwich double dipped, macaroni salad and two lemonades. 蔜he food was good, the atmosphere was good. 蔍 prefer the beef over the pork sandwich and I also tried some chili and it was pretty damn good. 蔔ext time I am getting a beef sandwich, chips, a small side of chili and a 2 lemonades.

Expect to wait at least 30 on the weekends, but the line moves pretty fast with some good conversation. 蔄ll the sandwhiches are good, cuz by the time you get to the front of the line, they all do the job for your rumbling stomach (try double dippin it). 蔔ote: I like spicy and can handle spicy (i,e habanero peppers in Mexico and red chili peppers in Thailand) but the mustard sauce gave a surprising kick if you dowse enough of it in your sub.

I'm ashamed to say that I have lived in LA for most of my life and have never been to Philippes until I saw it here on YELP. Went there with my hubby and he ordered the Beef with Blue Cheese (LOVED IT) and I had the Lamb double dipped....yummm! Well, it was sooo good that we brought the kids back the very next day. We ordered the same thing and our kids shared a Beef Sandwich and each had a bowl of soup. My teenage daughter swears it to be one of the best clam chowder she has ever tried!

I first caught sight of this very interesting french- dipped sandwich resto in Travel Channel. My fiance and I dropped by when we went to Chinatown yesterday. Oh my! The place was packed and someone said it was like that everyday. I ordered the beef sandwich with macaroni salad and lemonade. It hit the spot! , exclaimed my fiance. He had the pork sandwich. The thing is, i would have given it a 5-star if it was not for the slightly salty taste but everything else was great. It's definitely a place to go back to!!

The French dip is good especially with their secret recipe hot mustard. I absolutly hate mustard now I'm in love with their mustard and only from philippes. The down side is they dip their bread for the sandwich and they don't even sell the au jus for extra dipping. It s cheap n the atmosphere is chill. My bf n I ate n watched the dodgers game. What's better than eating in downtown LA at the best French dip sandwich place n root for the best MLB team at the same time?

Good stuff I must say. 蔆ame here early before a Dodger game, and holy crap was this place busy. 蔍 think half the stadium was here(exaggerating), because by the time we left the line was only a quarter as long as it was when my friends and I had arrived. 蔍 had their lamb french dip, double dipped. 蔄 bowl of clam chowder, a pepsi, a lemonade, and a slice chocolate cream pie. 蔜he lemonade is .75 cents a glass, you can't beat that. 蔜he french dip was really good, i'm glad I chose the lamb even if it was about a dollar more than the other sandwiches. 蔆lam chowder was good, though not the best I've ever had. 蔜he most disappointing thing about the experience was the chocolate cream pie. 蔍t was quite literally a chocolate cream pie. 蔍'm more accustomed to the filling be something of a pudding mix, though this filling was actually chocolate whipped cream. 蔔ot so wonderful. �Overall it is a good place to come and eat, I can definitely see how this establishment has been around as long as it has.

Never knew what the rave was about until my bf took me here to try their famous french dip sandwhiches and i must say they are pretty dam good! There sandwhiches are delish however the sandwhiches can get soggy since they are dipped in au jous sauce but it still melts in your mouth. Tried the lamb sandwhich when my bf ordered it and it was not that great, I guess you need to acquire a taste for lamb. However the beef dip is amazing along with cold root beer to quench your thirst. Deserts are great, chocolate cake and homemade-like pie, yum! The place can get really packed especially when there is a dodger game going on. I would not wait in line if the lines are forming outside, dont think the sandwhiches are that worth it but they go by pretty fast. Decor is nice with that old time LA railroad feel, sawdust on the floor and eating on long lunch tables. Def a must to stop by when traveling to LA!

I've heard from my friends that the french dip is overrated, but how can I not try the place that invented it? Indeed it was somewhat overrated. The hot mustard is really good. I don't normally do spicy, but its good. The burn is more like a wasabi burn. Had the lemonade too (75 cents what a deal!). All in all, if you live near it, it'd be cool for lunch but I don't think I'd make another 30 minute commute for it again.

My friend saw this place on the Travel Channel and so while we were in the area we stopped by to check it out. The sandwiches are good. The mustard was very rich with real mustard flavor. A little goes a long way. I would stay clear from it again. Ruins the flavor of meat you choose for your sandwich. I had the lamb sandwich dip. Was very good and tasty.

we lucked out as we went on a sunday afternoon around 1 and there were hardly any long lines. 蕀y order was the beef double dip, potato salad, meat chili and lemonade. 蔜he first thing i noticed was how cheap everything was and it made me beddy heppy. 蕐ou must eat everything together to get a complete meal. 蔜his includes that crazy mustard that our friends made the mistake of dousing their sandwiches with. 蔜hat mustard doesn't play games. 蔜he problem lies in portion size and the inability of the sandwich to stand alone. 蔵t was a great french dip sandwich, probably the best i've ever had but my experiences are limited to my high school cafeteria days. sure the lemonade was good and it was only 80 cents but you can literally kill it in 2 big sips. 蔍 would be PISSED if i had to go back downstairs to drink out of their toilet or something b/c the line was too damn long. 蔜he upstairs was a trip, i felt like i was transported to some internment camp mess hall. I don't think i'd wait as long as most to try this place again. 蔍f i did it would most likely be a 2 star rating. �tldr version: small portions, don't order lemonade if your thirsty, little dab will do ya(mustard).

I am very, very, very torn about my rating for Phillippe's. On one side of the spectrum, I am very disappointed that Phillippe's did not live up to expectations (damn you Food Network and Travel Channel for the hype!); on the other side of the spectrum, I kinda wanted another sammich from this place the day after I tried it. Also, their hot mustard is beast and I'm hating myself for not grabbing a bottle. Honestly, the draw for this place for me is it's location of being so damn far from me (yea, sounds weird to me too). Since LA/Chinatown is so damn far from SD, Phillipe's becomes a commodity to me. Since Phillippe's is so damn far and I really can't get to it, it makes me crave their sammiches even more. A true rating would be 3 1/2 stars, but I'm giving this place the benefit of a doubt with a generous 4 stars.

My kind of place. The food's great! The only thing (and I'll get this out of the way) is that it's obvious that Philippe's had an unfortunate makeover sometime in the 80s or 90s (dropped ceiling, anyone?). It pains me to look at the interior and imagine how amazing it would've been in there if they had just left it alone in all its early-20th-century glory. (Yes, I do realize 99% of people reading this don't care about the architecture anyway.) Other than that, it's awesome. Coffee is nine cents a cup. That's right, nine cents. Everything else is close to what normal food costs in modern America. Of course, everyone gets sandwiches, and I thought mine was really pretty dang darn good. I have to wholeheartedly recommend the pickled beets though, what a surprise! They were fresh (not canned), and the brine or juice or whatever was really zingy and salty and awesome. I'm going to come here every chance I get and then some.

I just feel bad for everyone who comes here after having heard all the hype. It's just like 'American Gangster'; sure, it's good, but having everyone scream about how the movie was going to change the world of cinema just ending up slightly disappointing you. A nine cent cup of coffee never hurt anyone, though, and you won't be able to walk away from this place not feeling completely stuffed. The mustard is great, but too much easily overpowers the sandwich leaving all other, non-horseradish flavors way in the background. Go for the double dip and some pie. You'll be happy, but won't think that this place is thing since sliced bread was dipped into au jus.

I've been coming here for as long as I can remember. As others have mentioned, Philippe's is indeed a Los Angeles institution. Nothing fancy-- counter service with communal tables to dine in. My order has remained the same for years: a beef french double dipped sandwich, potato salad, pickle, and coconut cream pie. Some visitors are put off by the wood shavings on the floor and names carved into the tables and bricks, but I see that as part of the appeal. Don't forget to stop by the candy counter on your way out. By the way, the rooms on the second floor can be reserved for private functions.

The birthplace of the French dip sandwich - Phillippe proves that there can be an institution truly worthy of its near unanimous respect and longevity. I get the beef, double dipped with bleu cheese, but there are many meat, cheese and dip options. Bring cash, and, if you're not in the mood for e a beer or wine, give their lemonade a shot. The sandwich is the real star, to be honest, but the sides, drinks and desserts do have a nice, picnic-food-from-your-childhood quality to them. I made the mistake of waiting almost a decade after I moved to Los Angeles to come here. If you are a foodie anywhere near LA County, you really owe it to yourself to head over. And don't forget to put plenty of their house mustard on your sammich. Especially if you have clogged sinuses.

After hearing and seeing stories about Philippe's on numerous TV shows, we decided to give it a try. I have to say we were a little disappointed, not so much with the quality or taste of the french dip sandwiches but with the rather tiny size of the sandwiches. We tried the roast beef and the roast pork. Both were good but for $6.00 all you get is a bun about 6 to 7 inches long with an average portion of meat in it. No chips, no pickle, just a paper plate to carry it on. Lots of side items are available for additional charge-chips, pickles, cole slaw, potato salad, etc. Drinks are a real bargain at .09 for a cup of coffee and around .70 for lemonade. But plan on eating at least two sandwiches($12). Great spicy mustard.

Wow, I had been craving Phillipes for awhile and now I know why I make such few trips here, despite its yummy goodness. It's always so crowded and busy. I decided to brave it and go on a weekend during lunch. But I only faced half the wrath because I had to deal with the parking as my friend got out of the car to go inside and order and find a place to sit. I still drove around for like 20 minutes looking for parking. I went in to both parking lots several times where the security guards mulling around were no help whatsoever. Finally the last straw was when someone stole my spot so I just left and parked on the street a few blocks away. Parking is insane and you just either have to be super aggressive or lucky. Anyways after I went in, it was just as I remembered - wooden tables, sawdust on the ground and multiple lines with some even going out the front door. Fortunately while I was parking my friend had managed to get our food and snag a spot at a communal table. Nice - at least after the horrible parking debacle I was able to just enjoy my food without worrying about the lines. I stuck with the classic beef dip. I can't seem to deviate from that one. But I've heard the lamb ranks up there as well. Anyways the sandwich and an ice cold (and cheap to boot) lemonade definitely hit the spot. Forgot to ask for the sandwich to be double-dipped - makes the whole thing juicier and not as dry. Still good. Just gotto stick to non-peak times to visit. Curious about their breakfast items as well.

I give this place a five because although the sandwiches aren't ridiculously great there is something about them. The turkey is always dependable and the ham is pretty good and the french dipping gives it that extra flavor. The mustard gives you a nice feeling of a flamethrower up your nose like wasabi. The baked apples were out of season, but next time I will plan it better so I get one. The whole atmosphere is the real draw. There are the cashier ladies that dress in their 40s or 50s era uniforms and make the sandwiches behind the glass and do not touch the money, but instead take the money on a wooden vessel to be handled by a separate money handler that handles the change. There is sawdust on the floor and wooden benches and it reminds me of a barbeque joint in Texas, but it's probably been like that for 100 or so years. The Dodgers fans on their way to see the game at nearby Dodgers stadium make it a pit stop in order to avoid the 10 bucks for Dodger dog and judging by the number of us it is a pretty popular alternative. I try to make it when I can but I avoid the lunchtime rush. It is well worth it, because I am never disappointed.

Went to this place on a Saturday for lunch and the inside of packed with people waiting to order. I went there for their name, and was not super stocked by the service. The inside looks like a bar near a train station, with a train room located on the first floor. I got a lamb sandwich. The meat was tender and rich, but the french dip bread felt nothing special. Also ordered a potato salad, which was very flavorful but still not that special. The hot mustard (which tasted more like wasabi) is a must, it adds so much flavor to the sandwich. The guy who shared a table with us kept adding more to his sandwich, and he was sobbing the entire time he was eating. My meal cost around 13 dollars, but I waited for at least an hour to get it. The service was not friendly at all, the lady working at the counter had no patience. In short, I'm glad I got to try the famous french dip sandwich but I would not go back there again, at least not in a while.

Cash only, pretty busy so get here before the rush. I like the taste of the juice in the bread. Very rich, tangy potato salad. A decent sandwich. Worth trying, but I wouldnt come all the way out to LA just to eat here.

what more can i say the other 1503 reviews haven't? this place is OK. their French dip sandwiches are not that much better than the ones at Arby's. i will give them kudos for offering a lamb French dip. it is convenient for us that it is located in the LA Chinatown since i can park in their lot.

I guess I just don't see the hype...the lines are incredibly long- although I do have to say they are pretty efficient- and the prices are very good- but overall, I just wasn't blown away. Maybe I went in with too high expectations, but at the end of the day, I don't think it is worth the traffic, the parking battle, and the long lines.

The sandwiches are pre-dipped and small, but good. The decor probably hasn't changed since they first opened, but I like that sort of rundown look. The beer is cheap ($3 for a 10 oz glass, the perfect size to go with your sandwich). This is where I bring dates to test our compatibility. If they're cool with it, we'll probably get along. If they spend the whole meal complaining that the place looks dirty and unhip, we probably won't.

A fun restaurant to visit, although lines can be long at certain times. The food is great the coffee is cheaply priced. I just had a blast knowing that this established restaurant has such a unique history. Just two blocks north of Olivera Street. At first I was a little apprehensive of the area, my fears were soon gone. The customers are a diverse group and everyone seem very friendly. The menu is extensive so don't believe those critics that say they only serve french dip it's not true. If your the impatient type don't visit, though the lines are shorter near the closing time.

I never heard of this place, but I was watching a show called Man Vs. Food and thought why not check it out since I do live about 30 minutes inland from L.A. Let's just say it wasnt what i was expecting. I never had a french dipped sandwich before, but for me it was HORRIBLE! I had the turkey dipped sandwich and it was just disgusting. I dont know if I just wasnt feelin the sauce but it was gross. And i put the mustard on, and i dont know if you were supposed to be feeling like flames up your nose, but it had that affect on me. The mustard made the sandwich taste even WORST! My eyes teared up after biting into it. I was so disappointed, I didnt want to eat anymore. I just finished up my salad which was alright. My boyfriend had the roast beef i think, and that tasted a lot better than mines, but it still wasnt the best. Never going again.

The restaurant looked relatively quiet on the outside when we pulled into the free parking lot in the back. I know a free parking lot in LA is unheard of but I do not jest about such treasures. 蔍nside the restaurant, it was sheer madness- tons of people sitting everywhere �-8 lines of people waiting to place their order at the counter. 蔅TW, they only accept cash & have placed 2 ATM conveniently at the back wall. We finally placed our sandwich orders: roast beef & lamb doubled dipped- we adopted the lingo from eavesdropping on other customers. 蔠ith our tray loaded with sandwiches, coleslaw and potato salad, we meandered our way through the packed restaurant to find a table. 蔜his proved challenging since the restaurant had tables set up in individuals rooms so it made you feel like your intruding on someone trying to devour their sandwich & licking their fingers. 蔜his, I exaggerate but not by much. �We found 2 spots and a long table & attacked our food. The thin sliced roast beef sandwich was good but not memorable. 蔜he thick chunky cuts of lamb was tasty & worth going back for! 蔠hat was also memorable is the hot mustard that is provided at every table. 蔍t tasted more like horseradish than mustard but you can't help but sop it up even when your eyes & nose are running. 蔍t's that tasty in my opinion. The coleslaw was good but watery & I've had better potato salad from supermarkets. �I would definitely go back & sample the pork, the ham & the lamb AGAIN. 蔍 give this place 3.5 stars. 蔍 am curious as to why they don't provide au jus on the side for those like me who like to dip their sandwiches multiple times??

If you are in LA, you gotta check out Philippe's! The french dipped beef sandwich is bomb BUT make sure you do not get a slice of cheese because it's way too much (unless you love cheese). I got the beef sandwich with a slice of jack cheese and the cheese was ridiculously thick. For the sides, I got chili and cole slaw. Cole slaw was on the sweeter side than others I have tried and the chili was slightly spicy! Overall, I RECOMMEND IT ! GIVE IT A TRY!

Yes, the food is very good and I'll go there again. But the lines are too long--and I normally go there around 3:30. They don't take credit, expecting you to rely on their ATMs with the $2+ surcharge. The saw dust is just gross. Also the servers put the silverware RIGHT ON the tray.

How can you not try a place that claims, historically, that they invented the French Dip Sandwich? However, if the original French Dip Sandwich sandwich doesn't come with a side of Au Jus, then I would rather prefer the present version. And also in today's world of French Dip Sandwiches we get twice more meat. Why this place does such good business at all hours of the day bewilders me. Maybe I need to try to lamb dip sandwich.

Philippe's, I pledge my unwavering loyalty to you. For 53 years you've never failed to satisfy my craving for your double dipped pork sandwiches, sweet coleslaw, and yellow-fire mustand. I wake at 2AM craving you. I think about you when it's been awhile. I long for your sawdust floors and bargain cup of coffee. Even if your food didn't make me swoon and sigh, I'd give you five stars just for longevity and that "old LA" feeling. Although I've tried others across the nation, no one has ever come close to your scrumptiousness. Your flavor has remained unchanged. Yes, as the years have passed, your meat has gotten thinner, and your price has escalated, but you've managed to hang in there, old girl. 蔄nd your candy counter! I WANT those old display cases, especially the Life Savers' rack. �There's no need for me to ever try anyone else. I love you.

Phillipe's: How Now Cash Cow? It's been about 20 or so years since I've been to Phillipe's; I don't live close to the place. 蔍 do remember going with my grandmother & brother when I was a kid. 蔍 don't remember how the food tasted or what I ordered but the restaurant seemed a lot bigger then and better lit; more natural light somehow. I think the illusion of being bigger might have been that I was smaller and there weren't as many people there eating that day. 蔍 went last month on a Sunday morning @ 10:30am and they may say things haven't changed but I remember more light pouring into that place somehow, it just looked dingy in there. 蔜hen I witness everyone with cash in their hands up at the counter while I was standing in line and when my friend calls to see if I've arrived I say "yeah, I'm here, and I think it's "cash only," which a fellow customer concurs within eavesdropping distance. 蔛o I have to get out of line to get cash. 蔐uckily they have an ATM on the premises but I have my own fears about using the small ATM machines, the size of a video arcade game--namely, identity theft (so far so good, knock wood). 蔛o the place is a Cash Cow. 蔜heir brochure says they average 2200 sandwiches on weekdays and 3800 on weekends. 蔜heir basic "French Dip" is around $6, so their bringing in some nice cash to pay their minimum wage (most likely) employees--who probably need the tips. 蔄fter that, someone is raking in a nice little payday. 蔄s for quality, the sandwich is just ok. 蔜here's nothing fantastic about it, the spicy mustard helps you forget how mediocre the sandwich is. 蔣ou would think that the place that boasts creating the French Dip would have a fantastic French Dip. 蔅ut it was just a "cafeteria French Dip." 蔍 could probably get the same thing at that other LA Dinosaur Institution, Clifton's. 蔛o there's nothing really to rave about. 蔍 did get a fantastic apron with pockets with the Phillipe's logo broadcasted across it; I love wearing it when I cook. 蔄lso picked up some fantastic mustard, which is also great for dipping chicken into amongst other things at home. �Good new about parking--there's a "spill over" lot across ORD Street from Phillipe's on Alameda. 蔅ottom line in my book for now: there's nothing really special about Phillipe's, however it's a nice place to pick up a decent French Dip. 蔅ut remember to bring cash--this LA institution is stuck in a credit card-less existence.

I saw Philippe's on an episode of Man vs. Food tv show and had to try it after my mouth watered seeing the sandwiches with high quality, freshly cooked tenderized meat. �When you walk in, there are probably about 10 or so lines so you feel, this won't be too long, but getting there any time after 11:00a plan on a 20-30 min wait in each line but when you get to the front counter you'll see why : the people taking your order personally make your sandwich and they are DELICIOUS! 蔈veryone who goes seems to have a diff favorite but you must try the beef with swiss cheese and tell them "double dipped" they'll know what you're talking about, (doubling dipping the bread in au jus). 蔍ts different than the french dip that you're probably use to where you get au jus to dip in but here they dip the bread for you. All their prices are great too but remember they only accept CASH. Their cheesecake is wonderful also, Its fluffy, I think its whipped.

If you're patient and enjoy a good French Dip in a rustic atmosphere, Phillipe's may be the place for you. 蔄ll of their French Dips (beef, lamb, turkey) are very good, but not the best---Houston's has the best French Dip, bar none. 蔜he potato salad is excellent---a rarity in restaurants these days and the other sides are OK. 蔜heir mustard is very tasty, but if you haven't tried it, I strongly encourage moderation, unless you want the back of your head blown off with the first bite. 蔔ow for the atmosphere: I don't mind the saw dust on the floor, but the poorly organized ordering process is disconcerting. It's difficult to know which line to enter to place your order, but on one count you can be certain: regardless of the time of day, you will wait. 蔍 suppose the stern to cranky demeanor of the "waitresses" (who also prepare your meal) is also part of the atmosphere, although I did get an "enjoy your meal honey" along with my change---perhaps to encourage a generous tip. 蔄fter waiting for almost 15 minutes in the middle of the morning, said generous tip was not forthcoming. 蔄ll in all, it is what it is; food quality is always my most important criterion and the prices are extremely reasonable. 蔍'll give it a three star.

Felipes, Filipes, PHILIPPE's 蔵s 蔭 little hard to find on the Internet - if we don't know how to spell the name we come up with a variety of restaurants that are not "the Original Restaurant in LA" When we can call ourselves Americans 蕎e turn a healthy passion for what we love into a starting business, just like 50+ years ago Philippe did for his food. Coming to a well stationed Restaurant near the Union Station and all the other "Towns" nearby: 蔆hina Town, Tokyo town, Olvera Street, this Original Restaurant holds the charm of a Gentleman in old Los Angeles. With the 'Old Fashioned standard of excellence", the 'Charm of Honoring our Country" - service running 24 hours straight in the days of the war, we see an Icon of 蔄merica. The Straw covered floors, fast service with 10 'Carvers' ( Cashiers) working at the same time you get your food HOT and correct in a short amount of time. I like the Restaurant because of the atmosphere and nostalgia. The food was Good, but could be improved with better planning. Over all the Coleslaw, Fresh Fruit, Sandwiches and Drinks were priced reasonably and were fresh. The only complaint I have is the meat was a bit bland and bread soggy. I prefer the juice on the side, so as not to make the bread soggy, but then that's not Original, Just my preference.

lunch was yum~! for the price, i think i'll prolly agree with my parents. ahha. they both felt that they could get a juicier satisfying sandwich at arbys. haha. but i was still content with mine. so, my mom and i ordered their beef french dip $5.15 while my dad ordered the pork french dip, also $5.15. we all ordered 3 diff side items (potato salad, cole slaw, and mac & cheese). Each side was $1 each. (potato salad- costco is better. cole slaw-i'd rather get the largest one they have at KFC's.. mac & cheese -can't beat those instant Kraft ones, u kno, the ones we ate as a kid... )oh, we got 3 diff cheese since i wanted to see the difference. (cheese was like $0.50. my fave was swiss, while my dad got american, mom got jack cheese). 2 kosher pickles ($2). iced tea, and coke ($2). parking wasn't that bad. service was pretty reasonable.. if you've never been, just so u know, you just get up to the counter and order, there's no number or nothing. it may look a bit confusing but i think that's the best tip i can give you because my dad and i stood there like morons. haha.

ok, finally did the philippe thing, and after the experience, i don't see the hype. yes, i love the vibe of the place, the historical importance of it all, but the beef dip disappointed. it was dry like others mentioned, kinda flavorless, and the bun was just mush. sorry if it's not authentic, but i'd rather have a buttered and toasted bun that can hold up to the moisture of the dip. and i'd rather dip it myself. the lamb was much better, juicy and tender, but not outstanding. well, at least i've tried it now.

I agree with a comment below: use the appropriate barometer. 蔖hilippe's is an inexpensive, historical place to get (in my opinion) a really, really tasty sandwich. 蔣es, I've had better French Dips, but these hit the spot. 蔛ort of along the lines of the Pantry, if you prepare yourself to go into a place with sawdust on the floor, you're going to be pleasantly surprised. 蔇amn, writing this review really makes me want one-- I wish it weren't an hour away from me.

Oh My GOSH...this is the BEST sandwich I have ever eaten!!! 蔍 got the double dip and it was so tender and juicy and just the right amount of salt flavor. 蔍 hated to come to the last bite. All of the sides we had were fantastic, the potato salad was so good and the pickle is superb. We got there early so we wouldn't have a crowd problem, I think we got there at 4:30, parked in their lot. 蔍 would recommend this sandwich to anyone, it is the BEST!

I'm giving it a better review simply for its history - you step back in time and that's kinda really fun. 蔍 don't venture into downtown much (something I'm trying to rectify) so to stumble into here is such a throwback time-wise, it makes it fun. 蔍'd def recommend it! 蔜he food is good - not the greatest ever - but its a diner... c'mon now, what do you expect? 蔅ut go anyway...its just fun.

i had the original french dip roast beef sandwich and it was good. 蔍 mean how many other places can you go to that you can get some good french dip sandwiches.. not too many i bet.. so i am giving this restaurant a 4.. i mean i would love to give it a 5 but i bet there will be another one to go to. 蔜he place itself is like yeah.. i guess you can say that you will feel like it has character and feel that you are stuck in time.. but i think it could be better organized. 蕋he lines are long and there are just people and tables everywhere. 蔕r maybe i went on the wrong day.. i have no idea.. but they do have 3 or 5 cents coffee or something i can't really remember b/c i went like a couple months ago.. amazing what you can get with so little.. coffee!! hehe but yea i don't know how good the coffee is b/c i only went for the sandwich. but yea.. its a good place to go to once in awhile.. oh yeah! 蔵 love those lady's uniform.. for some odd reason i think it is really cute and classic. ;)

I give this place 3.5 stars, but am rounding down to 3 as I feel that it is more of a 3 star place than a 4 star one. 蔜heir meat is good. 蔍t's juicy, tender, and flavorful, and lacks mouthfuls of fat. 蔜he beef and jack cheese sandwich was really, and I mean really, good, but my lamb and bleu cheese was lacking. 蔍 discovered their bleu cheese was too salty so after I removed it, my sandwich was much better. 蔔ext time, I'll be sure not to pair my meat with their bleu cheese. 蔖otato salad was great, but macaroni salad had too much mayonnaise, and I just was not a fan of their version of sweetness for it. 蔜heir beef stew was delicious though! 蔍t tasted like something that was made at home (which is a compliment!). 蔜he broth was light and watery. 蔍t tasted healthy to me, which is also good! 蔍t was at a good size for what it cost. 蔄pple pie was fine, but nothing special. 蔍 do not really like onion shavings on the floor, but it does add to the place in a way and makes it unique and more memorable. 蔍 did not like how their long benches were located where people stood in line to order so if you were to eat there, hungry people would be watching you. 蔋owever, I did like how there were more seating options in the back and upstairs. 蔒y experience was just fine. 蔍'm glad I tried it, but it's not a place I would go out of my way for, and it was a little bit of a financial stretch for what it was. 蔉or the two sandwiches and the million and a half sides, the total rang up to $26. 蔠hen I searched Philippe to review, I was extremely surprised that it already at 1,000 + reviews. 蔍t really did not strike me as a place to be that popular and special. 蔉or breakfast lovers and early risers, Philippe's does have a breakfast menu as well.

Who knew historic counter food could be so yummy? Great French dip, with tender meat, tasty but not salty, on fresh, soft bread. Next time I'd ask for it double-dipped, because I prefer au jus to the hot mustard. Good lemonade and cole slaw, too. The lines weren't too long when I was there, but I've heard there can be up to a 20 minute wait to order, so just be prepared for that. Thankfully they have two decent-sized parking lots, so that's usually not an issue. If you're a French dip fan, you gotta check out Philippe the Original!

I honestly don't see what the hype is about. Service was ok, not great. There's a parking lot adjacent to the restaurant, but I don't think there's enough parking spaces for the amount of customers this place gets. There were a lot of people lining up for food when I went into the restaurant and it wasn't easy finding a place to sit. I tried the beef french dip sub, single dipped, with a cup of coffee, a pickled egg, and a baked apple. The horseraddish I tried with my sandwich was pretty good and spicy, but the sandwich itself was ok. $5.15 is pretty pricey for a sandwich that size (7 inches), for me at least. The egg and coffee were pretty good (you can't beat 9 cents a cup for coffee). I liked the baked apple (it was delicious). The other people in my party also had beef french dip sandwiches and they weren't satisfied with their food. Would I come back here? Probably not since I don't think it's worth the trouble of driving over here, finding a parking space, and paying over $5 for a sandwich that doesn't quite satisfy me in a crowded restaurant. Then again, maybe my experience would be different and better the next time I go, if I go.

i give it 5 stars b/c its a classic LA institution (and not many places are nowadays). there is parking on either sides of alameda... this place is CROWDED but the lines move swiftly. you tip when you pay for your food @ the counter. the desserts look/sound better than they taste (but really who comes for the dessert?) I ordered the lamb sandwich double dipped. (but the classic is the beef) 蕋he potato & macaroni salads were both really good. the chili was a tad salty but still good. the mustard was HOT - like clear your sinuses hot. i would totally go back again.

mmmmmmmm. few things make me wish I lived closer to L.A. Phillipe, you are one of those things. Husband, daughter and I came here on our way back from San Diego.We were pleasantly surprised at the proximity to Olvera Street, as those were the two main places we wanted to stop on our way home to Central CA. We must have arrived at just the right time, as there were not many people in line and the place, while not empty, was not jam packed. We decided to get a few different things and share among the three of us. We got a lamb double dip, a beef double dip with swiss cheese, and a turkey double dip. We also got a bowl of beef stew and a bowl of french onion soup. Add two iced teas and a lemonade (less than $1 each? unbelievable!!! ESPECIALLY in L.A.!!!), and we were oh so happy. The sandwiches completely lived up to the hype. the bread was fantastic, the meat perfectly cooked, and the au jus, 蕀mmmmm. double dip me anytime! lol The hot mustard, as husband discovered, was HOT. when they say to use it sparingly, they aren't joking. He tried a small amount, liked it, so put a much more generous amount on his sandwich...and then after biting into it, promptly starting coughing and laughing. that maybe he should have listened to the nice lady. LOL. a little goes a long way , definitely. The beef stew was great, it was pronounced "as good as yours mom!", and I must say, I make a pretty killer beef stew. The french onion, ooooh soooo good. Finding the cheese on the bottom was a little unexpected, but really, who cares? it was delicious. The service was great, and the very nice lady at the candy counter said that since it was our first time, we could leave our car parked in the lot and walk over to Olvera street, very cool of her! Definitely going to come again the next time we make it all the way down south.

It was my first time trying a French dipped sandwich & it was pretty good. I have always driven by this place but never noticed it until i yelped it. I ordered a beef sandwich, lemonade, pickles, potato salad, and cheesecake. fat status right there, i know. the only thing i was sad about was not ordering cheese with it and asking for a double-dipped sandwich :(. there were a lot of ppl in the restaurant and i felt a little overwhelmed when i finally got up to the counter and ordered. oh well, next time! EVERYTHING was so cheap and affordable. two people can definitely share the pickles and potato salad. everything i ordered was pretty good, especially the potato salad. yummy! I liked how the lines moved fast & there was plenty of seating downstairs & upstairs. The brick walls are covered with people writing their names on it & the overall atmosphere of the place is cool and old school. i'll definitely come back to this place since there are parking lots for the place now & i can come here whenever i don't feel like eating asian food from chinatown :)

Yet another one of those places in LA, that people tell you "man you live in LA so you have to try this place out." 蔍t doesnt take long to figure out that this is one of those trendy LA places that people only go to so that they can tell other people how cool they are for going there. 蔠ell my wife and I waited in the long ass lines, but it went by fairly quickly. 蔠Hile in line I was paying attention to what people were ordering and had decided to go with the french dip sandwhich. 蔄nd I got closer to the counter I caught a glimpse of the sandwhich. 蔅etter yet, of how small the sandwhich was. 蔍mmedietly I was like, WTF! 蔖eople rant and rave oabout this place and for 5.50 I get that little piece of crap they call a sandwhich? 蔍ts not even a "5 dollar foot long" sandqwhich that Subway offers...arrrrrgh! 蔍 ended up ordering 2 to compensate. 蔛o we got our orders, claimed a table and began to eat. 蔉irst bite and I knew that this place was not going to be a repeat offender, 蕋he sandwhich was nothing special, needless to say it didnt make my eyes roll back in ecstacy. 蔛O in the end, I give this place an "Eh" 蔭nd apologize to the Los Angelinos that swear this place is the "best"... im just not that trendy.

Isn't it great living in one of the biggest metropolises in the world? All the great dives. I love it. Once again, this is a place I should have been coming to since I was a kid, but unfortunately my parents weren't into places like this. Fortunately a friend introduced me to Philippe's about 8 or 9 years ago, and I fell head over heels. The food is one thing, but the ambiance is something else entirely. Not your typical Los Angeles dining experience, to be sure. Pick a line and be patient. Once you get to the counter, let the carver know exactly what you want and how you want it. If you like coffee, order two for yourself (only .09 but no refills), and for God's sake do not try to hand cash to the carver, that's what that tray is for. There's nothing quite like the weekday lunchtime crowd at Philippe's. Blue collar, white collar, cops, tourists and everything in between. One thing for sure, you gotta sit among 'em, so pull up an open stool and dig in. Last time I was in they traded the mustard jar with the little spoons for squeeze bottles. What? Anyway, the mustard hasn't changed nor has your reaction to too much of it. Yikes! The sandwiches are the sandwiches. What else can you say? I dig the turkey and the pork, double dipped with Swiss cheese and macaroni salad on the side. I can't describe what it is about the sandwich that keeps me coming back, but it's there. I have friends who just don't get it, and that's fine, but I do get it, as often as I can. The sandwich is comforting and satisfying, and the atmosphere transports me to another time and place. Grab a U-NO bar on the way out.

i tend to come here later in the day, so i'm not subjected to crazy lines and bad parking (note: they do have a lot around the side, i think it's off of ord). it's hard to beat the deal you get at philippe's and just kind of being part of the classic history of l.a. it's a spare environment, no frills, kinda like getting your food from the lunch lady, but sometimes you just want it to be simple that way. also note that it's cash only.

Took the red line from NoHo to try this place I've heard so much about. 蔍t was quite an adventure for the twins. Philippe's was very convenient and easy to get to. 蔄rrived around 4pm and there was already a line 3 deep, which equated to about a 10 minute wait. The staff definitely is not in a rush and were taking their old sweet time. I heard from others in line that was typical. A younger establishment could serve the same food in seconds as it was all pre-made food they just had to slap the meat on the bread (well cheese too in some cases). Women behind counter were not friendly but not rude either. �The place is definitely old showing it's age with sawdust on floor but seemed clean. The place is much bigger than i expected. 蔕rdered double dip beef with Swiss, double dip turkey with Jack, macaroni & fruit salad, apple pie & custard. 蔖icked all this so we'd get a good representation of menu. 蔜he food was good and enjoyable but not amazing. 蔠ouldn't make long trip back just for this, but would eat again if around already.

great atmosphere in a questionable location, sawdust on the floor and shared bench tables abound, the French dip sandwich is a must (especially with their excellent spicy mustard, definitely not your usual bland tasteless French's type mustard) their coffee is adequate but very cheap, in all a great place for tourists and a good break from the usual for locals..you stand in line to get to a counter to make your order, and receive your food at the same place...the one big negative is the breakfast food, which is sub-Denny's,,,but get the French dip, there you can't go wrong.

We were driving thru the area and I had remembered seeing this on some TV show a while back. I was not happy with the lines we waited for 30 minutes to order our mediocre food. I was surprised to see the women order takers making our sandwiches and the meat was not hot and the au jus that they dipped the sandwich in must not have been too hot either. By the time we got to our table our food was cold. My friend had the chili and thought it was just like taco meat no real flavor or spice. I don't think I'll be coming back, its just not that hard to make this good at home.

yes. everything about this place is good. i have been going here for years. the first time was with my dad when we were waiting for our train at the union station to go up to canada. that was when I was 6... and since then it has never changed. and in a good way! all the sandwiches are great tasting. i really like the way they make their tuna. the cole slaw is the best. perhaps it is because I have grown up on this stuff that it really feels like comfort food to me. the old phone booths are a sweet touch that never goes away - imagining men in brown gabridine suits and hats shooting the air during their lunch or waiting for the train. it's all about the long tables and low stools that you share with your neighbor over a french dip and lemonade. breakfast is good and cheap here also- the women taking your order still wearing the cool old utilitarian uniforms and hair nets. the back room by the bathroom is a bit more quiet and you can stare at old circus photos and trains while sitting in wood booths.

been eating here since i was a toddler and can honestly say they have the best french dipped sandwiches period. i've tried pretty much everything and as long as you order the right thing you'll be giving this place 5 stars too. i suggest that you always take a person with you so you can both order different sandwiches and then switch halves and see which sandwich you favor. my mom's favorite is the lamb and mine is the pork. since i'm big lamb eater it's great that i can can exchange have of my pork for half of her lamb. in recent years i started ordering swiss cheese on the pork, makes it even better. the beef is really good and probably the safest choice if it's your first time or you're a picky eater with a boring pallet; plus the beef is their signature sandwich. the turkey is actually really good too, which surprised me because i thought it was ludicrous ordering a turkey sandwich at philippe's. the ham is gross and unlike the other dipped sandwiches is cold meat on french dipped bread. making this way was odd. the tuna is the worst tuna i've ever had in my life and i don't really care for the side salads but if i had to pick one i would go with the potato. the chili is good if you don't mind greasy and get a pickle as their pickles compliment your meal well. one pickle is probably good for 3 or 4 people as they just slice one into spears for you. you can't beat their lemonade, iced tea, and coffee that's just a few cents a glass. breakfast is pretty standard and nothing to write home about but i'm glad to say i finally tried it after many years of wanting to try it. this place is a los angeles staple for a reason.

SUCKIEST PLACE! omg, why are the lines so long? and their food is not even that great. Maybe I was expecting the best sandwich I ever tasted because of the long lines. But no, it basically sucked. We waited for like an hour!!! for a crappy sandwich!!!I was waiting in line with the boyfriend and started getting anxiety because of all the people and because I'm short I was running out of air supply. I ended up waiting by the door for some fresh air. Felt like my beef sandwich was jus bland, didn't taste anything. I thought i was eating cardboard...so why the popularity?? I HAVE NO IDEA.

this place was CROWDED! 蔵 went on a tuesday at 12:30. 蔮ut the line moved super fast and we didn't have a problem finding a seat - probably because there were two floors of seating and it was cafeteria style seating. 蔮ig long tables with a few 4 person tables in a small room off to the side. 蕋he menu is a little hard to see so unless you had been there a couple times and knew the ropes it was a little difficult to figure out the pricing and what you could order. 蔵 ended up getting the beef sandwich - which is what they are most known for, with swiss cheese. 蔭nd it was the bomb! 蕀y side item is the reason they didn't get the five stars. 蕀y macaroni salad was ok, i should i have chosen the chicken and rice soup. 蕋he choices for sides are - slaw, macaroni salad, pigs feet, pickled beets, chili, a bag of chips, or soup. 蕇o weird choices - next time i'll go with the soup or the chips. but overall it was fabulous. 蔭nd there was plenty of parking (two lots) to accommodate the crowd.

Philippe's was only 48 years young when my dad first brought me here--but even then it felt like you were stepping back in time. 蔍n those days coffee was only a nickel for all you could drink--they had urns on the stair wall where you could help yourself to refills. 蔛o at 10 cents a cup today (9 cents for the coffee, 1 cent for the tax) for one cup with no refills it 蔲eels a bit like a rip-off, that is until you campare it with Starbucks at 15 time the price or more. 蔜here was no drop ceiling in 1960, there was more sawdust on the floor, they didin't cut the sandwiches in half, and I'm sure some of the pictures on the walls have found there way there since I first started coming, but other than that the place looks and feels the same. 蔍 pop in often. 蔒y standard order is double-dipped beef with Swiss, cole slaw, lemonade and coffee--less than $10 for the food but, of course, it is customary to leave a tip for your server. 蔅ut I've orderd other stuff as well--the beef stew and chili are good, as are the soups. 蔅reakfasts are good, too, and when you order ham and eggs you get a real, bone-in, ham steak--none of this sectioned and formed stuff 蔐ines can get long at usual meal times, but in the evening (unless there's a Dodger game) you can often belly right up to the counter. �Having read some of the nay-sayers here, I'll offer these observations: 蔍've always found the servers to be friendly--but at peak hours this is a volume operaton. 蔍f they don't want to hear your life story, it's nothing personal. 蔆ome at off-peak hours if you want to chit-chat with your server. 蔍 can't understand how anyone could say the beef is dry--but the bread can be a bit dry if you don't ask for a double-dip. 蔜he mustard is hot--use it sparingly. 蔅ut they do mix it themselves, and it can vary in intensity from batch to batch. 蔜ry a very small dollop at first until you get used to it. 蔄lso, with the appropriate dishes, ask for the salsa at the counter--fresh, spicy and the McCoy. 蔖arking is usually adequate both around the back of the restaurant and in their second lot across the street. 蔜he atmosphere is democratic with 蔭 small "d." You'll find everyone in here from cops to Chinatown merchants, lawyers to stew bums, regulars to tourists--and you'll be sitting elbow-to-elbow with them during rush times, which effectivly eliminate a good number of tables when the lines get long--but it's a friendly place, and on many occasions I've struck up conversations with interesting people. 蔕ne last thing, if you happen to be Clark Kent, this is one of the last places in town where you can find real telephone booths--five or six of 'em in a row--so there's no waiting when you need a 蕄lace to change.

Randomly stumbled upon this place with my boyfriend. We spent Sunday walking around China Town - caught a demonstration by Shaolin Warriors of LA - which was pretty great. Afterwards we 蕋ook a side street by accident and ran into this restaurant. When my bf saw it - he informed me that this was one of his father's favorite places. A weird fact about our relationship - his father and I tend to have the same taste in food. Anyways, knowing this, I immediately wanted to try it. We both had the french dip lamb sandwich - it was pretty awesome. I def'ly see myself craving it in the future. The line wasn't too bad - took about 10 minutes. The downside for me was that it was a cash only place, but they have atm's with the usual ridiculous fees. Anyways - worth the hype and i'm definitely going to indulge again. The iced tea was good. Also, people watching during the wait kept things interesting.

Went here after shopping around in Little Tokyo. They say that this place is really good. I have to agree with everyone who gave this place 2 or 1 stars because they really know whats up. The food here is below average. It's always packed with people with no tastebuds who probably think the ancient atmosphere makes the sandwich taste better. You can't find a sandwich like this anywhere else? Thats because no one is going to survive making a subpar sandwich. The gf also ordered a side of beets and macaroni salad. average at best. Had the lamb sandwich, double dipped which equals = cold, barely warm, dry and soggy. That is not how a sandwich is supposed to be. It was cold, so also got the chili with no beans because the gf doesn't like beans. Saltiest chili on the face of the planet. No joke, it looked like poop and tasted like it. Never going to come back here again. It's cool with all the 蔴istory, but they should just ship that to a museum and stop making the food. Food has evolved, so should Philippe.

For a restaurant that was featured on The Travel Channel's "Man vs. Food" and "Food Paradise" shows, I was extremely disappointed by the skimpy portions and rather pedestrian sandwich. Truly legendary sandwich places should never let their patrons leave hungry and that's exactly what this establishment did to me. After hours of shopping in Chinatown and the Fashion District, I expected to be rewarded with a mouth-watering sandwich at this eatery. After I scarfed down my pork sandwich (which is barely larger than a McRib), I was so hungry that I wanted to go to the dim sum place next door! And the lines were horrendous and unorganized with customers cutting in line right and left! Forty-five minutes in line for that? OVERRATED! Save your time, go to an establishment with better sandwiches, no lines and better value!

I guess I'm not a big fan of French Dip sandwiches in general bc I don't like soggy bread. 蔍 found the food at Philippe's to be good but not great. 蔛ince it was our first time, I found it to be a bit confusing as to where to stand in line. 蔄t first, I didn't realize you could stand in front of any cashier and that there were multiple lines rather than just one. 蔍n addition to a French dip, we got a side of potato salad (recommended by a regular in line), a bowl of chili, and a slice of boysenberry pie, which did not taste homemade. 蔜he potato salad was yummy and the meat in the French Dip was tender, but like I said before, it didn't taste like anything special. 蔍 also did not like that they automatically charged us for the larger bowl rather than cup when we asked for a side of chili. 蔄t least ask us what size we'd like! 蔒y other friend liked the spicy mustard so much that he bought a jar (about $3.50). 蔠e didn't have to wait long in line to order (came here on a week night) nor did we wait long for our food. 蔠e also found a table with no problems.

thanks to philippe's my taste buds can only appreciate roast beef sandwiches from here now. but no problem, i always stop when i am driving through LA. the roast beef sandwich is good with the regular amount of sauce the put on the sandwich but if you want a bit more moisture, i would definitely recommend asking for some more. the spicy mustard is really good and spicy. the potato and macaroni salads have too much mayo for my liking but i still order a side of either cuz it gets the job done. long lines and cash only, but ample parking across the street is a huge plus!

I honestly don't get it. Me and my hubby have been dying to try this place for some time. So we decided to venture to chinatown and see what the hype is all about. Forget about trying to find parking in the restaurant's parking lot. After finding a spot on the street we finally made our way to Philippes. My first reaction when I walked in was WOW this place is crowded and hectic. The lines do go pretty quick but I was put off by the fact that the ladies taking your order and making the sandwiches don't wear gloves. Anyway we ordered the beef, lamb, and pork dipped sandwiches. My hubby said the lamb was nothing special and I felt the same way about my beef sandwich. We split the pork and I felt it was better than the beef. The sandwich is just meat on a roll. It's nothing special and all hype.

The sandwiches there are more than just delicious. You can either get them single dipped or double dipped in their rich au jue. The line was a tad bit on the long side, but it was worth the wait. I had the double dipped beef sandwich with cole slaw and got another lamb sandwich to go. I just wished that the lady that made the lamb sandwich cut the meat into thinner slices. They were very hard to bite down on and chew since the slabs were to thick. 蔅e careful with the mustard. I underestimated how spicy it was so I put a layer of it in between my sandwich. I ended tearing up and had that feeling going up my nose as if I had just eating a large amount of wasabi. Overall, if you haven't been there, definitely go check it out.

I've been here enough times to give this LA landmark a honest review. 蔍t is squarely a 3 star place. 蔛ure it has Huell Howser "Amazing" for all the old Los Angeles appeal. �0 years ago, the sandwhiches and value 蕎as a treat. �0 years ago, the saw dust floor, the .10 cent coffee, the ambiance of a old time, working class eatery was was a big draw and started the buzz. 蔔owadays, the price, the crowds, the cut back on generous portions to price ratio has brought down my rating. 蔍t tries to stay unchanged, but times are catching up. 蔜he sandwhiches are now pricey..the lines, the quality versus value makes this a place that has jumped the shark. 蔍f you've 蕁ever been here, it's worth the expierence to say you've tried it. �If you are looking for a real discovery, you may be dissapointed. 蔉or having to wait on average of 20 minutes to reach the counter to order average fare on cardboard plates, served up by overworked servers and then pay top dollar for the experience, only to then manuever your tray to a communal table to eat your lunch makes this a place to say "I've been there" 蔮ut not again.

ehh.. i really don't know what the hype is all about i've never even heard of this place until i saw an episode of �no reservations" with anthony bourdain.. and honestly, i'm disappointed. WAY WAY overhyped. I was looking for it saturday morning, and saw a line of cops driving towards that general direction, i asked him where philippes was, and he said "just follow me" so i did. The place was packed at 10:30 in the morning!! there were like 4-6 lines and all of them had 5-6 people each.. strange thing was that the tables were still empty?? regardless of the fact that there were only 4 people in front of my, i had to wait nearly 20 minutes before i could order anyways, so seeing that this place was the "original french dip" i got the beef dip (double dipped), potato salad, macaroni salad, and a blueberry pie. so...... the beef dip wasn't good at all. i bit into the sandwich like 5 seconds after i received it and the bread was extremely soggy.. like falling apart soggy. I think the au jus gave the sandwich most of the flavor (even then it was lacking) The beef was extremely dry and flavorless. The mustard added a nice kick though, and kind of "completed" the sandwich. the salads were typical of what you could find @ costco, again, nothing special the pie was good though haha if you want good beef dip, find a decent restaurant. The beef dip at houstons is very good. Lots of flavor, larger portions, and they give you your own au jus dip. you do pay like 2.5x the cost though, but imo, it's all worth it. anyways, i won't be back.. over hyped, too busy, not enough flavor. i guess you can't really complain about the price though, which is probably what keeps people coming back

my fiance is a meat eater and im not, but we decided to go here anyways. luckily they had salads so i had that. the honey dijon mustard was really good but as i got to the last bite, i noticed something tiny on one of the tomatoes. this was none other than a dead ladybug, just my luck. i didn't complain but also felt like barfing at the same time. the lamb, on the other hand, according to fiance, was really good. sorry, this was a really crappy review.

I went here a while back with a few friends. I have a very keen memory and remember that I will more than likely not go back. Maybe, I don't know. 2 of us had never been there but the other 2 were giving the place out of this world praise like we were missing out if we didn't try it. I wasn't looking to be disappointed but I was ready to chow down on some good food as many people who've been here that I know of talk about it like it's the stuff of LA legend. People around here get so hung up about this and that place is historical or "an LA institution". Who gives a shit? Obviously there are many who do. The product should speak for itself, not the stupid ass name. Many of these places have passed through owners that it's not even close to what the original owner established and cemented the legacy that the places currently still try to ride on. A number of historical lackluster places have blind devotion and outsiders who visit unwittingly get sucked in because the places (or rather their names) are famous. We didn't have long lines like some others stated. Maybe 5 or so people ahead of us. There were a few people seated at tables, but not many. We went later in the evening so I don't know if that had anything to do with the quality of food. Anyways I ordered the Pork Dip sandwich and a drink. The pork was cold, dry and bland the bread was meh at best. Couldn't taste much except dry stringy meat. I decided to add some hot mustard to bring some flavor getting protests and warnings of the 2 friends who'd been there before telling me I'd ruin it if I put too much. I love wasabi and hot mustard so I know they'll pretty much clear your sinuses so I was aware of that. I didn't use too much for that very reason and it did nothing to change the bland meat except allow me to taste hot mustard. At first I tested some of the hot mustard of a little piece of pork I cut off before putting it on the entire sandwich. Didn't do much. Once it was on the entire sandwich used sparingly I couldn't even finish the rest and left 3/4 of the sandwich uneaten. The best thing about the meal was the hot mustard and pop. If the pork was juicier, I'm almost certain the hot mustard would've made the sandwich burst with flavor. I think this place is going off of name recognition as I was not impressed with the food at all. If I do go back, I might have a change of heart, maybe not.

great piece of LA history located right at the edge of Chinatown. the French Dip is great in beef or pork and they have pretty good sides such as the potato salad and cole slaw. lunchtime is busy so try to go early or later in the day. great place to take visitors from out of town usually after a jaunt in Chinatown.

Came here after going to work with my mom on a Saturday. I have lived less than 15 minutes away from here and NEVER tried it! Whaaaaa! Anyway, parking was NOT as hard as I had heard. The wait time was decent for the amount of people in line. Got to the front, ordered a beef dip, potato salad and 2 lemonades and a banana pie for the road. So the sandwich was great (just a tip, be VERY careful with the amount of hot mustard you use, a little goes a looong way) I must say, I wasn't a huge fan of the potato salad. A little too sweet for me, but it was ok. The banana cream pie on the other hand, was seriously ridiculous. So as I'm going through it, what do I find? An ENTIRE banana!! It was soooo good, I was fighting my mom over it! She had the tapioca and that was really good. Kinda made me feel like I was a little kid and my Nana would make tapioca and serve it in the exact same bowl. Nice. All in all, I really liked it. Planning to go back in a few weeks to take my best friend who loves loves roast beef and has never come here.

Let me preface this review by saying that I do NOT order the famous french dip at Phillipe's. I live about a mile away from this LA institution and visit it on a weekly basis, but that is because I am completely addicted to the pickled eggs and coffee. It sounds like a gross combo, and no I am not preggers, but these two menu items rock my world. The pickled eggs are 85 cents and the coffee is 10 cents. The coffee with cream is hands down the BEST coffee I have ever had. I feel like a modern day, female, non-detective version of Phillip Marlowe as I sit at the old wood tables and sip down a cuppa. The french dip is ok - I'm not a huge beef fan, so beef slathered in beef juices doesn't really do it for me, and I would much rather control the au jus-age on my own (the lovely counter ladies dip the meat and bread in the au jus so you are left to their devices). Only downside to this place are the lines when tourists hit and the fact that it is cash only. Institution or not, not accepting plastic is inexcusable to me.

an ESSENTIAL LA experience. very vintage, very unique, very worthwhile. my recommendation: park in their ample lot, bring cash & some patience (be prepared to wait in line awhile). order a double-dipped beef french dip (no need to add cheese) slaw or potato salad on the side & a glass of their famous lemonade. bring your tray upstairs to one of the little school rooms with an open window & get ready to be wow'd. make sure to try their homemade hot mustard (it's in an unlabeled plastic squeeze bottle on the tables) but go easy on it at first-it is not subtle. if you love the mustard, you can buy a jar at the cashier up front for $3.75.

This place has been around for over 100 years and it's easy to understand why after you've been there! 蔠e went here for lunch with friends before a Dodgers game (they'd been here before) and we all ordered the beef French Dip (they also have pork, ham, lamb and turkey) which is served with cheese (we chose Swiss). 蔍t was the best French Dip I've ever had -- tender, juicy, flavorful beef and really good bread that doesn't fall apart but has enough "jus" on the bread to moisten the sandwich nicely �- they do not serve au jus on the side as most places do. 蔜heir potato salad was also excellent. 蔜hey had a number of lines for service and they moved quickly. 蔕ne of our friends also enjoyed a piece of their banana cream pie. 蔠e'll make it a point to go there again on our next trip to L.A.

my family loves this place. i like the lamb sandwich, which is all i've ever ordered. one of the other reviewers said it's a sketchy neighborhood. compared to what i used to be like, it's pretty clean now. definitely still has the old los angeles feel, which i appreciate, but honestly, i only like to go here when the tables are full and there's a huge line. it makes the sandwich better. stop off at the candy counter for some nostalgic-for-your-grandparent's candy. i always buy a box of sen-sen (bitter crunchy licorice) for my grandfather and some black jack gum for myself. (it's also the closest atm for when you go to homegirl cafe up the street.)

The bread would be dry if not for the dip. 蔜he mustard was pungent and spicy. �Atmosphere: definitely the best part about this restaurant. 蕋hey have benches and sawdust lined floors and the walls have pictures and memorabilia from decades past . 蔕h, and they have some flat screen TVs that were playing an assortment of football games that the guys really enjoyed :) They also have a counter in the front where you can buy newspapers, and assorted candies. Service: buy at the counter, and they will clear your dishes. 蕋hey are all very friendly.

I have to say that this place was a little overhyped. I came here after viewing an episode on the Travel Channel and it looked really delicious. However, I found the lines to be unorganized and most of the tables were not cleaned at all (sorry but it's hard to enjoy food on a dirty table). The sandwich itself was good, but nothing memorable.

Philippe's -good, hits the spot, but not anything to rave about. After reading some yelp reviews, it seemed the recommended way to go was double dipped with cheese. So I had beef, double dipped with swiss. The beef is pretty bland, actually. It is tender, but not melt-in-your-mouth tender. The sandwich is not very hot so the cheese wasn't melty at all. I expected melted cheese on hot beef. The sandwich was good overall, but not something I will crave or go far out of my way to get. This is suppose to be one of LA's finest, but I think any Chicago italian beef blows the Philippe dip away. Although, I must say, that hot mustard is friggin fantastic - painfully fantastic. I would go back for the mustard. And the sides are good --very yummy slaw.

Best french dips in Los Angeles and the best prices too!! Tried Coles the other day to compare and Philippe's won hands down!! You can get a turkey, pork, lamb or beef dip and they are very reasonably priced! Under $7 or maybe $6 each dip! And the lemonade is outstanding for less than $1 a glass, the desserts are fresh and very reasonable as well. I don't think you can get a strawberry cheesecake slice anywhere else these days for the $2.85 they charge. I also love their tapioca pudding for $2 something. They always run out of turkey and their yummy chocolate layer cake early in the day so you have to make it in by 7/8pm for those! The rest. stays open til ten though! This is somewhere my boyfriend went with his parents as a kid and I really like than 20 years later this place is still the same. They are always consistent and always good. One of my favorite places to grab a $30 meal for 2 (with desserts) in town!

With a day off and the hunger pangs getting stronger and stronger....what's a chick to do? Well, jump into my little car and bust out of the San Gabriel Valley and head on over to Downtown Los Angeles....actually Chinatown. I've been coming here since I was a baby chick in my parents arms, so it is an old standy-by, like comfort food. I have to agree with some of the other reviewers it's not the absolute best and sometimes the food is a hit or miss. For example, my favorite macaroni salad tastes a certain way one day and then a little different the next. I got there after 3pm, which is always best for smaller lines. You miss all the people for lunch and all the people that eat before any evening event. On this trip (and probably from now on) I got the double-dipped Turkey.....it always used to be the beef, but as one gets....ahem....."older".....it's a little harder on the constitution! I added a whole pickle, the little white chilies and a PINT of macaroni. 蔊ot a little greedy with the roni. Since I was solo this time I asked the lady to...."make it to-go babe!". This also helps to avoid going back to the windowed counter and order the brownies, pies or any other sweet thing staring back at you. Left a tip, grabbed my bag and headed back to the valley with a big smile on my face. Prepared my plate with all the fixings and Oo.....this time it was a HIT! Such a good decision. Will I continue to go back to Philippe? Hell yes! And knowing that there continues to be long lines only means that this place will be around for a very long time. The End.

Man, who am I fooling. 蔍 am always going to love Philippe's. 蔍t feels like home. This update however is about President Obama. I recently went down to Philippe's to watch his war crimes infomercial and escalation of troops in Afghanistan on their lovely television. I had already come to the realization that this guy I voted for was not what I thought he was at election time. I mean, I'm not disappointed in him, I'm disappointed in myself for not studying his horrible voting record in the Senate, his uncompromising (bending over to take it in the arse) support for the "State" of Israel. I should have known Biden was a self professed Zionist. I should have known his hands were firmly in the pockets of big banks and corporations. I did not do my homework. He ran a brilliant campaign filled with sweeping catch phrases, typical middle class pandering, and a Colgate smile. 蔛o here we are today. Mired down in Obama's unjust war killing thousands of innocent Afghans and torturing innocents. We're set to tear Pakistan apart, hell we're already drone-ing them to death (literally). We're sanctioning Iran and set to invade once again. We're letting Israel have free reign to further their atrocities in Palestine and occupation of their land. And believe me, we're never leaving Iraq where we've killed over a million people and displaced millions more with more violence occurring everyday, curfews, house raids and torture. �But back to Philippe's....again, I love their lamb dips with swiss cheese the best finished with spicy mustard at every table. 蔆oleslaw, potato salad, and a beer. 蔣ou cannot go wrong. 蔛o come on down before our economy completely collapses because this president dismantled our auto industry, bailed out the banks and corporations thanks to our tax dollars, and is frightening the American people into supporting a disastrous health care bill that is designed to enrich the health insurance industry and provide subpar care, while all the while average people like you and me are left where we are, in the gutter, where Obama wanted us all along. 蔜he coffee is dirt cheep at Philippe's. 蔍 love this place.

Philippe's.... How I do love thee. I am not a big meat eater, especially beef, but I can't resist the french dip sandwiches here. Add coleslaw and I'm in heaven. I know there's always been an argument whether Cole's or Philippe's actually invented the french dip. It doesn't really matter who did it, Philippe's wins hands down, no comparison! But now I'm hungry. Gotta go.

I fell in love with philippes the first time i ate there and have been a fan of them ever since. I order the same thing every time and it has become a ritual that i love. Everyone says the roast beef sandwich is good but I like the turkey sandwich. The broth dip they use is really good and i always ask for my sandwich to be double dipped because i find that only one dip is not enough. The macaroni salad is not like you regular grocery store kind, the kind here is crunchy and light which makes you order every time you come back. They give you one small scoop of it but it is enough, believe me. I once though that one scoop just wasn't enough and i ordered two scoops of macaroni and ended up wasting my money for trying to overeat! 蔜he chili they have is amazing!! i ask for cheese on it because it melts on top of the chili and i can't get enough. My girlfriend loves the chili from there so we share a large for us. It has chunks of chili inside and beans of course, and the chili is very thick. delicious. If I didn't lived half an hour away I would probably come here more often, but I hate the L.A. traffic. But distance makes the heart grow fonder so I try to come here as often as I can!

Best french dip sandwiches in LA...p no actually probably California! It is a downtown staple and cannot be underestimated! But you have to get the sandwich double dipped and with a side of chips and their lemonade!That makes the perfect lunch on a budget and I love the casual atmosphere..the hay on the floor..the long tables it just reminds of you the lunch tables when you were in grade school!They have a really good chocolate pie too as well..if you can fit in dessert!Phillipe's definielty beats Cole's on Main and 5th which claims to be the best and first french dip subs in L.A. umm no.I really don't care about the recent reviews and media coverage about it being closed down for a few hours..because to be quite honest we never know whats going on at any restaurant or deli behind the counter and if Phillipe's food has people coming back for almost a hundred years they must be doing something right!I love it that it is close to home but you know if you come in a peak lunch time hours your going to wait in line because it is that good! An old boyfriend of mine used to live across the street in the apartments at Union Station and everyday that I was there I HAD to have Phillipe's!The french dip sandwich lives up to it's name!And the waitresses still dress the same and have been there for years!There is sufficient parking in the back and when you set your money on the little plate, don't forget to tip the waitress!Worth every penny!

really ?! this is just one of those landmark places you try once. maybe more if you can't cook or something cuz i make waaaaaay better french dip sammies at home for way cheaper too. sandwiches are kinda small for $5.5 imo + i eat like 4 bites a meal so trust me, if you're a " normal " eater, you'll probably need 2. won't come here again. the only thing we liked was that it was huge [ plenty of seating + cool, old school feel ] and that's probably about it . . .

Best french dip sandwich ANYWHERE! You really can't even try and search for something better than this. You must get your sandwiched double dipped because that just adds so much more flavor. I usually go for their Roast Beef or Lamb sandwiches. I love their quality of food and their great prices but the highlight is their spicy mustard that just takes my sandwich over the top every single time!!

More Hype Than Substance My bf saw this restaurant talked about on "Man vs Food" and decided we HAD to go. 蔍 mean how can you go wrong with a place that has been open for over 100 years that has lines that overflow outside and onto the sidewalk sometimes? 蔝nfortunately, I was disappointed. �We went on a Saturday' and true to reputation the lines were long. �蔜he lines move quickly, but the line set-up is confusing for first timers. 蔠e probably would have gotten to the counter 15 minutes sooner if there had just been some kind of sign explaining that we could move toward the middle to other "lunch ladies" instead of waiting at the back. 蔠e ordered a turkey sandwich, pork sandwich, tapioca, macaroni salad, and two lemonades.. 蕋he total was just over $18.00 (and left the remainder as tip.) We had to wander around looking for a place to eat... finally found a table upstairs with two seats available, as long as we bussed the dirty dishes away ourselves. 蔍 picked up my french dipped turkey, bit into it, and was immediately underwhelmed. 蔍 tried a bite of the pork sandwich, but it was only slightly better in my opinion. �蔕verall the food was only so-so, and certainly not worth the wait.

If your going to a Dodger game, you should probably roll in here first and get a french dip, lemonade, slaw, and piece of pie. 蔜hey are featured on several TV shows and are the birthplace of the french dip.

Few days ago, my siblings and I went to Philippe's and we were all so excited to try the infamous beef french dip. I can sum up my experience eating here in one word: overrated. I've heard all the hype about this place and it sure got me extremely excited about the place. I ordered a double-dipped beef french dip with a swiss cheese and an order of their cheap 75 cents lemonade. The sandwich was A-OK! It wasn't great but it wasn't horrible either. I thought my sandwich will be soaking wet but it actually turned out pretty dry. The swiss cheese, on the other hand, was not so great. The feel of eating a cold swiss cheese was not appealing to me. Actually, I couldn't even taste it because the beef over powered the whole sandwich. My sandwich was sure beefy! The lemonade was also a so-so. You get what you paid for right? 75 cents for a small glass of watered down lemonade. And Oh gee, that infamous hot mustard! I'm a sissy when it comes to spicy stuff but I did try it. All I can say is that WOW. That 'hot mustard' sure tasted like wasabi to me. You get the 'up to the nose' kind of experience when you put some on your sandwich.The pies, on the other hand, looked very appealing. Too bad I didn't get to try it. Overall, this place when talking about food is overrated. Although the place is very cute and historical. I appreciated that more than my serving of double-dipped beef french dip.

The most delicious sandwiches in the world. This place gets crowded before Laker/Dodger/SC games but even at its peak the wait isn't too unmanageable (maybe 20-25 min). The pork sandwiches are awesome, double dipped is too soggy for my taste, but to each their own. They serve surprisingly good wines by the glass if thats what youre into as well...

The french-dipped sandwiches are pretty good, as is almost everything else here. Don't expect a fancy restaurant setting, though (although not "dirty", it's everything but haute). By the way, the horseradish dressing IS SPICY, but it won't kill you if you consume it in moderate amounts at a time.

First bite "Amazing." Second bite "Pure Joy." Third bite "Will You Marry me?" To eat Phillippe's is to love Phillippe's. The recipe is simple... Get some amazingly tender roast beef. Check. Slam it down onto a crispy french roll. Check. Dunk that french roll into some "Dip" - the greatest thing known to man. Check Mate.... And let the children sing. Slight exaggeration? Maybe..... but not much. When you've tried it, you'll understand. Come into Philippe's any time of day and you'll always be greeted with the same... 10 lines 10 people deep, rows upon rows of family style tables, saw dust on the floor, and most importantly, sweet old ladies in light brown dresses dipping their hearts away. But equally important, load up your tray with some old fashioned macaroni salad, one giant pickle, a slice of apple pie, and an old school tiny glass of lemonade, and you're on your way. Exploring for a table is almost half the fun, walking through the labyrinth of hallways and rooms, strolling up stairs where you swear the layout must have been from a 1912 elementary school. Wherever you choose to sit, settle down with the worlds greatest french dip and squeeze on just a little of there super-spicy horseradish mustard (you've been warned, don't come after us when your brain wants to exit your body through your nose). It's no wonder the place has been packed for right around a century, put simple, the place has Good Grub.

do not eat here. 蔲ood is over priced and does not taste that much better than some other restaurants french dip sandwich. 蔱verything there is a la carte which will bump the price even more. 蕂ther than being a really old restaurant, which gives it its charm there is nothing much to do there. 蔿angers would be the next option for me if i wanted a good sandwich. 蔭nd not to mention, it's not the cleanest place either they scatter woods chips all over the floor- maybe its to help clean up at the end of the night and soak up all the grime but it's not home depot where they use that stuff to clean up spills. 蔭lso they had to close down for several days because of roach infestations.

Been going there for over 50 years and it's exactly the same. 蔄s you get older in life you increasingly come to feel nostalgic and value the things of your youth. 蔐ife moves by so fast, and in this world of constant change we seldom get the chance to go back and re-experience the things we enjoyed when we were young, because they're gone. 蔖hilippe's is one of those opportunities. 蔍s it really that good? 蔒any newcomers go there & say it's no big deal. 蔅ut when you bite into that sandwich, fresh French roll with lean beef, the bread double dipped in aus jus, with maybe a slice of swiss cheese on it, ummmm. It's the memory of that taste and the associations of your life back when you used to eat it, that make it special. 蔐ike going back home. 蔄nd where else would you see a service counter quite like this, with a string of customers waiting in single file lines leading out through the large dining tables, the ladies behind the counter in their nice uniforms preparing the sandwiches and taking your money from a coin tray over to a person at the central cash register to ring up the sale and make change, where you can look in the glass deli counter and order the add ons, pickled eggs, potato salad, chili, fresh made lemonade and slice of pie, and even a nice selection of wines by the glass. 蔔o French fries here! 蔄nd you can't even order extra aus jus on the side because they won't give it to you, even if you want to pay for it. 蔍f you don't like their super hot mustard found at the tables you better remember to ask for regular mustard, which they'll give you in the small tear open packets. 蔔o table for 2 or 4 here either, just long tables like you might find in a mess hall, sawdust on the floor. 蔜o your left a couple in a tuxedo & evening gown headed for the music center, to your right laborers in their working clothes getting a lunch break, and across from you a family of 6 with the kids and grandma. 蔄nd everyone is comfortable because they're a Philippe's and that's the way it is here. 蔜here is just nowhere else quite like it. 蔜he people who have been coming here for years wouldn't change a single thing about it. �And leave everything else there alone. 蔍t's not broken, so don't try to fix it.

My husband took me here one Friday evening, because we were sick of eating in the lackluster town of Burbank. 蔍t was a quick hop on the freeway, which only took about ten minutes. 蔒y husband works downtown, and has been here a few times and said it was so good. 蔛o, we were lucky enough to find a parking spot in the tiny lot behind the restaurant. 蔍 ordered the beef french dip, because I was not in the mood to be adventurous, since that always backfires on me with food. 蔄t first I was not too impressed with the look of it. 蔅ut I gave it a chance. 蔄fter a few bites, it left me wanting more. 蔍 was still a bit hungry after my sandwich, but I guess I could have ordered some potato salad or cold slaw, but I was a bit intimidated by the ordering process when we got there. 蔔ext time I will know what to do. 蔍t is a simple and tasty sandwich, so I would recommend it, even if you are not a fan of french dips.

Totally overrated. 蔍 went in wanting to like this place. 蔍 knew all about its history. 蔍t's been around for ever, it's kitschy, blah blah blah. 蔍t gets one star for the atmosphere: 蕎orking class clientele, historical photos, train memorabilia, old phone booths, old fashioned uniforms. 蔍 liked all of this. 蔅ut what about the food? 蔍t's really not very good. 蔜he sandwiches are pretty thin. 蔄 little bit of meat stuffed inside a soggy roll. 蔜hat's it. 蔔o lettuce, tomato, pickle, mayo, nothing. 蔋ardly a bargain at $5.50 a pop. 蔠ith a side of potato salad and a soda it's almost nine bucks. 蔄nd it's all so bland. 蔍 can't believe people line up out the door to get in this place. 蔍f you want to go here just to say you did, I would recommend going late at night. 蔍 got there about fifteen minutes before they closed and there were only a few people in line. 蔍f you spend any amount of time waiting in line here you will hate yourself afterwards. �There is one bonus to this place. 蔜here is an extraordinarily tall blonde woman who works here. 蔄nd she has a really sexy European accent (Swedish? German?). 蔛he's a Teutonic goddess. �If you're into that kind of thing you should check her out.

Definitely a HYPED up TRENDY spot. 蔔o way are the French Dips the 蔮est, 蕋hey are ok but they are super small and $5 dollars, the $5 dollars is just for the French Dip, Then you have to buy potatoe salad or cole slaw, maybe some fries and a drink, they charge everything separate after all is added the bill comes out to 11-12 dollars for a Wimpy lil ok sandwich. 蔜he service is not the best at least the lady that attended us was very rude, it was our first time and she automatically assumed that we knew everything was a la carte and that we put the money in the lil, tray she was not helpful when asked about which sandwich should we try, very rude so thats more minus stars. 蔜he only reason this place gets two stars is because of the decor, when you walk into this place you really feel like you step into a place that's been almost the same for about 50 years, you can tell there's a lot of history there, TOO Bad the Sandwiches were a HUGE LET DOWN. 蔖robably wont be returning, i'll stick to Coles.
