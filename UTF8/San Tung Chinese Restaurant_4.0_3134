DRY FRY CHICKEN WINGS. That's all you need to know. BOOM. TIP: I will say their service has been slackin lately. Twice now I've gone and gotten all of our order minus one, which of course has to be our string beans!! And at the very end when there's nothing left to eat with it.

When I recently set up a bank account, half the time I spent with my new banker was him raving about San Tung and that I need to check it out. On his recommendation, we got the famous "Dry Fry" chicken. Perfectly fried chicken wings in a sweetish gingery-peppery sauce. Really good! Also went for the combination fried rice with beef, chicken, shrimp, and calamari. Very solid. Most of the negatives seem to be about waiting for a table. Seeing as we don't really eat out too often and prefer takeout anyhow, this place fits great :-)

These 5 stars goes out to their famous dry-friend chicken wings. Some people say it's overrated, but I was definitely blown away. If I had the money and time I would make a trip to SF right now just to have some. I think they're a must try! Everything else was good, but not as amazing as their wings. When my friends and I went, we got lucky and only had to wait 10 minutes or so. The food came really quickly too!

Apparently when you come here around 4pm its dead with no wait, so the next time you want to treat your friend out for picking up your wallet at the library - you know when to take them to san tung. Who knew that one of the best places for wings was going to be found in a Chinese restaurant. ?While i was waiting for the waiter - I remembered that i eat here 2 years for a christmas party. i remember waiting outside for an hour just to get a table. I dont think we came particularly for the wings but for some good Chinese food. I really wanted to try the tea duck, but they didnt have any. We ordered the wings and seafood chow mein. Im still searching for the best chow mein in the city, but so far san tung has the best chow mein. Using a combination of calamari, mussels, shrimp and scallops makes this noodle good. The fact that i did not need to add any condiments meant it was good as is. Onto the wings... Let me say that asian style wings they all use the same type of sauce which is a sweat and savory taste sauce. I never seen any variations of the sauce whenever i order asian style wings at any restaurants that serves it. Without that said... I enjoyed the wings. Definitely one of the best wings out there, but i do not think that they are more far superior to the other. What i like: - The meat was cooked perfectly -The size of the wings were big and gives you about 10 per $9.50 serving What i didnt like -Since they are dry wings they were cooked before dipped in sauce and the skin was really heard. The sauce started to caramelize on the chicken but it harden pretty fast making it a effort to eat it. The hard parts would graze the top of my mouth. The candy like skin would then get stuck in my teeth. Only certain parts of the wing was really hard, but some of the other parts were fine. Overall its a tasty wing. I would recommend it to everyone. I would go back there, just when there is no wait.

Sf has so many amazing restaurants and I make sure to come visit often for food trips, with that I've heard so many great things about San Tung's dry chicken wings that Hubby and I just had to give it a try. Fortunately for us we walked right in for a late lunch and had no wait whatsoever. The service was quick and short but the employees were very nice. Dry Chicken Wings - Wow, these wings are fried to the perfect goodness and dressed with this amazing sauce. The portion is large, and the chicken wing itself is still super moist with that perfect crunch outside. Very inexpensive, we had a friend with us I only had a few pieces while hubby and our friend killed two orders. A must try ! Green Beans - It was pretty awesome that I could see a worker cleaning the green beans on the side at a table, so you know these babies are fresh. Sauteed with a lovely light nice and tons of garlic. Cooked with great texture still, a nice bite, but still tender with a caramely finish. Shrimp & Leek Dumpling - These were okay, not flavorful as I was expecting, but mixing vinegar, soy, & chili made this better. The leek flavoring was pretty absent though, still cooked tender but not something I would jump on ordering. Pork Dumplings - Once again a little absent and not as flavorful, this came out a little overcooked. The pork flavoring was light. A great place to try if you're into chicken wings then I would highly suggest this place. A lot of people have mentioned they do get extremely busy so be cautious, I went in the late afternoon a bit before they closed. Extremely affordable food and the portion is awesome, enjoy !

DEEP FRIED CHICKEN WINGS, how often do I find myself cursing the fact that I don't live closer to you. I have no idea what kind of black magic they use to keep their chicken so crispy on the outside, covered in that delicious, sticky sauce, and yet so moist and ?tender on the inside. Get the black bean noodles and the dry fried green beans to go with your chicken wings. There is usually a bit of a wait on the weekends. You will find yourself drooling over other people's plates and then order too much chicken for one person. Don't be surprised that you'll finish the plate AND be tempted to order another one to-go.

I might get hate mail for this....but I really only dig the dry chicken wings here. My buddy mark turned me onto this place after golfing some ten years ago....and it was crazy busy back then. I have had the cherry pork and it was okay. Shrimp and leek dumplings is okay...with so many dumpling houses popping up...there are many more places to get better. Most of the dishes are solid(three star)....but the dry chicken wings are like crack....it is what put this place on the map. So go and check it out....but definitely try the dry chicken wings

I came here about 2 weeks ago on a Monday around 11:30am. There wasn't a wait so we were seated right away, but there we're not many open seating around. We had a baby stroller with us so they seated us in the very far right corner at a table that can seat at least 8 people. And it was only myself, my boyfriend, and our sleeping son. The whole reason for coming here was just to try the chicken wings because I've read and heard everyone rave about them. It took at least 10 mins after sitting down for someone to give us menus, another 25 for someone to take out drink and food order. Then another 30 to bring the food out. As we waited the line to get in grew bigger and bigger so we were glad we got there before the rush. We got our food and we started eating. Maybe 15 mins in they sat a couple at our big table. Can you say AWKWARD? They we're sitting directly in front of us and with all the food we ordered it kind of made us look like a fat asses. And since they had the thing in the middle of the table that turns we felt like we had to take our food off of it and set it on the actual table because it'd be weird if we were to spin it and our food end up next to them. I don't mind sharing tables next to each other like pho or how the middle of their restaurant is but not a big round circle table. It just made our experience a little weird. As for the food. It was great. We ended up ordering more wings to go so we can eat them for dinner later. We'll probably be back but will most def ask for a table where we can sit by ourselves.

Came here on a Sunday at 11am right when they open. First one through the door. First one to order. Placed two orders of their deep fried boneless chicken and cold noodles to go. Told to come back in 25 minutes. Wait 25 minutes and ask where my food is. Ask to sit down. Wait 20 minutes. Get food. Pay. Leave. The food is good, but the wait is ridiculous. The tables that sat down when I ordered already finished eating. Probably lost my ticket. It would have been faster for me to sit down as if I was eating there, then just ask for my food to go when it arrives. I would have been out in 20 minutes.

3 stars from a vegetarian. I realize this place isn't well known or well-liked for their veggie options but their fare is better than what I expected. It was a few other things prevent this place from bumping up a notch. The good: the food is solid. Flavorful, well-sauced, and not bogged down with oil. As for their vegetarian options, they had excellent dumplings and we tried the spinach entree and the eggplant, which were both terrific. The bad: very little service here. But your expectations have to be in check - this is an Asian restaurant after all. They do a pretty good job of making sure you have water but aren't going to stop by and make sure everything is fine. They're way too busy for that. The tables for parties of 4 or less are basically right next to each other. Don't expect any privacy. This plus the lighting makes this a place to come with friends but not a romantic dinner date. The ugly: the wait. But if you're coming here you already knew that and were mentally prepared for the hour plus that you might wait on any weekend night. :)

I was literally shocked when I saw the wait outside this little restaurant. ?I kept thinking there is no way that their chicken wings can be THAT good. ?My sister decided that we weren't going to wait and went to get the chicken wings to go instead. As we waited about 20 minutes, my sister came out with a big bag of chicken wings. ?It was freezing outside but we still stood at the corner of the street, digging into the yummy deliciousness of San Tung's Chicken Wings. ? They were absolutely delicious, piping hot and full of flavor. ?We were licking our fingers and eating up all the meat off the bones. ?Definitely the BEST Asian Chicken Wings that I've ever had. ? It's totally worth it for the wait if you want to dine inside or if you get impatient, just order it to go and eat curb style. ?No one's going to judge you. ?They will be jealous that you're eating such yummy wings and not getting some of their own!

Chinese food is not something that I regularly go to when I want to eat out, but the chicken wings... oh my, the dry friend chicken wings are out of this world. They are also the reason why you will likely be waiting over 30 minutes for a table (especially mid-day on a weekend). The wings were crispy and were loaded with flavor, a nice sweet and spicy mixture. Each order is close to 10 dollars, but you get a lot on each plate and is meant to be shared with others. But everything else? Not bad, but not great either. Ordered the kung pao, sizzling rice soup, mu shu, dumplings, and pot stickers, but nothing stood out. Service was painfully slow as it took quite a while to get our food. Overall, come for the wings. That's about it.

There is a long line. There are tons of people who will not give up their place. The food is worth the weight. Our first night here, we were blessed with a blackout after waiting 40 mins. We stuck around another 40 mins hoping the lights and power would come back.... and it never did. Foodies were eating in the dark as the smoke from the kitchen started to fill the dining area. Finally gave in and left to eat at some half ass'd place somewhere around the corner. Heart was sad Came back next morning at 11am. Same weekend, they had some crazy marathon and it was jammed packed. Inside were gorillas, disco dancers, robots and superheros. Was faced with another 45 min wait but once my wife, son and I got seated, all was great. Then our dry chicken wings came out. Damn this shit is badass... no one makes it like this... crispy, semi sweet, spicy and 100% delicious. We ordered a few other dishes, which were delicious as well but those wings.... FAB FYI, if you want to save yourself the crazy wait times, the store next door, the gelato place also makes the same wings. I guess the son owns this joint and they shared the same kitchen.... but something about eating Chinese/Korean food in a crazy fast paced environment makes the food tastes all the better.... I shall return for you!

San Tung is one of the best Chinese restaurants I've dined at. This restaurant is definitely worth the wait unless I was starving and needed food right away. The wait on a weekday evening for dinner around 8 is definitely not that bad. We were seated within 15 minutes for a party of 4. The service is okay. Some of the servers are pretty attentive with refilling our water and tea. My recommendations: - Original Dry Fried Chicken Wings: Very peppery and fried. - Pork Dumplings - Potstickers - Beef with Snow Peas - Noodles with Peanut Sauce: a bit spicy but I really loved the taste of the peanut sauce. The food is so great here. I look forward to trying more dishes in the future.

To all the leftists out there, fear not. ?Leave the white guilt at the door and take comfort knowing you can freely use "oriental" without judgment here. Korean? ?Chinese? ?IT doesn't matter *people's eyebrow.* ?They'll respond to both. Try all or any variation of their original fried chicken wings (dry/wet/winged/diced). ?An ? absolute must (menu #74 aka their signature dish). ?Potentially the best chicken wing, ever. ?Not just among the asian chicken wing genus but in all of wingdom. ?It is unfathomable. ?Perfectly seasoned and glazed. ?No need to cool off before eating. ?Just the right amount of meat in each wing. Bottom line: If God ordered wings, he would call San Tung. ?Rumor has it Pelican Bay and San Quentin have a direct line. Waits on weekend can be 1-2 hours long but other menu items are not worth the wait. ?If the wait is the case, call them and order 36 wings to-go and eat someplace else, doesn't matter where. ?Street parking is near impossible. Also, after you write your name on the wait list make sure you camp INSIDE. ?Host will call your name once and if you don't respond within 3 seconds he will erase it. ?Oftentimes, he won't even open the door to yell to those waiting outside. ?I had no problem with him since I waited inside. They also have black bean noodles (jajang myung) and jampong (spicy seafood noodle soup). ?Both bland. ?The jampong broth is basically tepid tap water with a dusting of chili flakes. Their deep or wok fried pork dumplings were superb (menu #4).

My favorite Chinese food restaurant, but one of my least favorite lines. Can be long wait but I think it's well worth it. ?My favorite dish is dry fried flounder, but everything else I've had is good too. ?Some of the waiters are pretty funny too. I can't figure out why yelpers give bad reviews because of long lines. That means the restaurant is doing a good job. ?Anyway, just have a good time while you're waiting and it's all okay.

met up with some friends for dinner. Finding this place is pretty easy, and if you're here for dinner after 6....free street parking! The lines can get a bit crazy so i'd recommend coming early. There is no fancy decoration in this place, it's bland but the one thing that threw me off was where we were seated. Right in front of the entrance. Since there were people waiting to be seated, we noticed people were constantly staring at our food as we ate, a bit uncomfortable , and the door is a few feet away so you get nice gusts of cold air mixed with street odor. We ordered the dry fried chicken wings, mongolian beef, pork dumplings and string beans with a pot of rice. Service was extremely quick whenever we needed anything from water to napkins to extra chopsticks. Food was great! the mongolian beef was really tasty and so were the string beans. The dry fried wings were good, but if you wait too long the brown sugar makes the glaze thick like syrup, so eat it quick! Definitely will be returning, hopefully we get better seating though. (try to avoid the middle tables)

How good can fried chicken be? San Tung Good. I finally tried this place after hearing the hype and I was pleasantly surprised with how yummy it is. It's a little expensive for chicken wings and the wait can be ridiculous but I still wouldn't mind coming here again. The complementary kim-chi is super spicy! Since we had 4 people, they said we couldn't just order 2 dishes or else they would charge us for the kim-chi.... so we had the dry rub, wet rub, and pork dumplings. Most people seem to prefer the dry one but my bf and I thought the wet ones had more flavor. Pork dumplings were also pretty good. Well San Tung, good job--I'm impressed!

Dayummmmm the wait is long. Two hours for our first time for dinner saturday night. We got there at 6:30 and didn't eat until 8:30...but it was WORTH IT. Bring a jacket during the winter, you'll have to wait outdoors. The jja jjang myun (black bean noodles) were amaze. so was the tangsooyook (fried pork in sweet sauce) and of course the DRY chicken wings. It has a slight 5-spice flavor that is mind-blowing. Unfortunately, I live in LA, and 3 hours into the drive back down I got a hankering for those wings and drums. Le sigh. If you want to get just the chicken, their little boba shop next door sells them without the long lines...but I say just wait it out and it'll be the best meal of your life.

I never understood why people ask if something on the menu is good. What's the waiter going to say? The chicken penne is terrible, we keep it on the menu just to mess with you. Don't be that woman next to me who asked what's good here. Obviously if you've never done any research you shouldn't be eating here. The surly response she got was everything's good here, what do you want? Surly... but what do you expect? Every dish here is well done, honed by thousands and thousands of chicken wings drenched in that white pepper honey sauce. Big dumplings, green beans, etc etc. Basically just put a chopstick down on the menu and order that. You'll be happy at this comfort Chinese place. It's no high end restaurant but if I need a place to sit down and just be happy happy... this is it Jack. (or go next door for less wait).

I heard all the great things about the chicken wings and had to try it out. ?We had a wait that started at 630 and lasted 2 hours. ?The wait was completely worth it. We grabbed the typical korean-chinese items as well such as chajangmyun and champong with our meal. ?They were both insanely good although the portion size was smaller than most restaurants serving the same fare. ?The tangsooyook (fried pork with sweet sauce) was delicious. ?The only ordinary item was the green beans but they were still awesome. The chicken wings are amazing. ?The waiter recommended we get the dry wings rather than the wet as they were tastier according to him. ?I have to say those were the most amazing chicken wings I have ever tasted and by themselves would have been worth the wait. I believe the little snack shop next door sells the wings as well but I would recommend waiting to try out all of their items for a complete korean-chinese food experience.

I made a list of places in SF to try in 2013, and San Tung was near the top of my list. I knew about the wait, but our group still decided to dilly dally and wait until 6pm to put our names down. We asked the waiter how long the wait would be for a table of four.......2 hours?!?!?!?!?!? THESE BETTER BE SOME DAMN GOOD CHICKEN WINGS AND GREEN BEANS....I am NOT one to wait for my food. Since I've been craving for awhile, I decided to suck up my impatience and just wait it out. 15 minutes in and 4 eavesdropped conversations later, I heard the waiter tell someone, "yea, the next door dessert (literally called....Next Door Sweets) place serves the same menu with less wait." SAY WHAT?? WHAT DID YOU SAY WAITER?? Withholding my excitement, I ran next door to ask the girl at the cash register. Lo and behold, SAME MENU, LESS WAIT. WHY WOULD ANYONE WAIT 2 HOURS??? Chicken wangs were good though! Since we skipped the long line, we ordered 2 portions of the chicken wings (for four people) to rub it in no one's face, dried fried green beans, one plate of potstickers (6), and black sauce noodles. Everything was so good, we ate til our bellies exploded. Worth the hype, but not the wait. If there's a long wait and you're super hungry, I would suggest just going next door and grabbing a table there. It's more quiet and intimate there anyway. Sorry if I gave away the divine secret to fast chicken wings...

The decent food here does not make up for the worst service I've ever experienced. I asked one of the waiters what the difference was between two types of noodles and this is how our conversation went. "What's the difference between number 6 and 7?" "What's THIS? *slams his finger down and points to the menu* "...shrimp." "And what's THIS?!" "...beef." He then pointed back and fourth to the two differing prices and left angrily..someone needs an attitude check. ?I also believe they gave us the wrong chicken wings (we ordered the dry fried chicken but the ones we received were dripping with sauce) but seeing as how the waiter was so rude, we didn't want to deal with it anymore and just ate our mediocre chicken. This place isn't bad but for horrible service and decent food, I probably won't be back.

When one thinks of fried chicken, they usually think of southern fried chicken that establishments like KFC or Popeyes churn out. ?Korean twice fried chicken has become more popular in more mainstream cities, but never have I heard of a Chinese restaurant praised for their fried chicken. ?Ok, this restaurant is supposed to be Chinese/Korean since they serve food that can be interpreted as Korean and serve kimchee as a side dish if you eat in. ?Both of their dried fried chicken wings and the boneless diced chicken are best described by KFC's old slogan from the 80s, it's finger licking good... I tried both of the dried fried chicken wings as well as the dried fried boneless diced chicken. ?Both are tasty and crispy as they give the chicken (wings or boneless) a nice fry. ?The sauce is almost like a honey bbq with sweet and slightly sour undertones. ?I was surprised though that the sauces between the chicken wings and boneless diced chicken were a little different from each other. ?The chicken wings had white pepper added to the sauce which gave it a slightly spicy pepper-ish undertones, which gave it a nice kick. ?I am not sure if the differences in sauces were on purpose or perhaps the two dishes were prepared by different people. ?I got my order to go, so I didn't get a chance to eat the food served right after it is prepared but can imagine how much more awesome the chicken would taste and may bump up the rating up to 5 stars! Until next time...

Chicken wings, and string beans - The two best things on the menu. The service is fast, and the food is excellent. If you live nearby, its worth it to do takeout because the wait can get super long. Also, they serve the wings in the store next door, so if you're just looking for a quick fix you don't have to wait for the main restaurant.

We thought we'd try this place one Tuesday night around 7:30 or so. ?But the line was out the door, and the place was crazy loud. ? We crossed the street, got seated immediately elsewhere, and ate in peace.

Parking in this area sucks.. often you have drive around and wait.. and it is metered parking as well. Every time I've passed this place, it is super busy. But it wasn't until I read about the wings I decided to give it a try. About $12 gets you a good amount of wings... but the wings themselves were amazing! The fried chicken wings are crunchy and are covered in a thick soy/ginger/garlic sweet sauce... I have never tasted anything like it. Definitely one of those places I will trek back to for the wings.

First suggestion - make a reservation - I did and walked right in. The line was long and by the time we had left, longer. The food here is excellent, fresh tasting, delicious flavors, everything very distinctive. Four people ate heartily and loved it all. ?That should say it all! Except - no desserts - desserts are to be found next door - and they were damn good too!

Let me tell you! The line is still going till the last minute they close! We got seated around 920 ish and they close at 930pm. It is crazy packed. I was very skeptical about a Chinese restaurant. We ordered the must order: the crispy chicken wings, black bean noodles, hot and sour soup, sautéed string beans, and mushu pork. I think my favorites were crispy chicken wings, hot and sour soup, and the mushu pork. The wings are what everyone raves about and really...I'm not going to start raving. I'm just going to say TRY IT! The hot and sour soup was excellent. Sour and white PEPPERY! Nice touch of ingredients inside. Plentiful amounts. The mushu pork was excellent. You roll it yourself...into a burrito. I thought its a great dish, light, flavorful with the egg, and the hoisin sauce adds a nice touch as flavor. Black bean noodles was not what I expected. I expected a strong black bean flavor but I was wrong. It was subtle. There wasn't much flavor though. One flavor through and through. I just felt like it was a bowl black glob. The noodles were thick and long. Difficult to get a portion because of the sticky sauce. It was alright. Not amazing. The sauteed string beans were good but overcooked for my taste. The skin of the vegetable was already wrinkly and peeling. Could have done without both but try for your liking. -Give it ?a try! P.s. my mission is to replicate those wings! P.s.s. Put your name on the white board upon entering.

Add this place to your bucket list kids, you'll be so happy you did. This is officially my favorite fried wing spot. Ever. Their wings are just wonderful because of their unique taste. I've never had wings like this before, it's honestly indescribable. It will make all your taste buds come alive! It's truly sensational. I love that it's saucy and flavorful without being completely drenched in sauce. It allows the wings to be crunchy as well. There's a really great balance there. I can't believe it's taken me so long to try this place! It's about $10 for a generous order of wings, I'd say about 10 wings give or take? This is hands down the best place for fried chicken wings. Amazing!

I now know why at least 75%, if not 90%, of the pictures for this restaurant are of the Original Dry Fried Chicken Wings (#74) -- they have a crispy skin coated in a garlic-infused, sweet and tangy honey sauce. Though the meat itself needs to be brined or marinated, the issue is moot when you dip it in the excess sauce. Their frying and honey sauce remind me of now-closed Kam's gourmet chicken from years back. Don't get me wrong but I wouldn't say San Tung makes THE BEST wings or the preparation style is THE ONLY WAY to go, because it's simply not. Getting over the hype and praise for what they're known for, I don't want to say that San Tung let me down as a Chinese restaurant because I only tried one other menu item: their Black Bean Sauce Noodles (#7). This dish is such a disappointment and not worth its high price. A few reasons for my grief: (1) The black bean sauce was very thick and disgusting from what must have been a lot of added cornstarch; (2) no actual black beans (unless it was grinded up); (3) noodles weren't cut to a manageable size and, with the thick sauce, made it difficult to pull out of the bowl in order to share; (4) didn't notice noodles were housemade given the smothering of the thick sauce; (4) very little beef and two pieces of overcooked shrimp and calamari each; and lastly (5) potatoes added as fillers (unless it's actually supposed to be there). San Tung stands at 3.5 stars for me at this moment, with their chicken wings receiving most of my favorable critique and I'll need to try their other items to get a better feel for what they can offer. On a side note, I noticed Skippy peanut butter jars being carted into the restaurant during the Saturday lunch hour...I wish I was blissfully ignorant of this.

Let's see what the hype is all about.. I told myself! Ordered: 1. Dry fried chicken wings- reminded me of Bonchon style but I liked it way better! Definitely lived up to the hype! 2. Hot & Sour Soup- delicious.. small size good for 2 3. Black Bean Noodles- ?I thought this was going to be more salty due to the sauce being all over the noodles but it was actually lighter than I expected. Quick Service. ?Be ready to order. ?Came at around 3pm because I feared the wait from all the reviews I read. ?Typical Chinese restaurant. Nothing too special or fancy. If I am ever in the area and there's no wait, I'll totally stop by! ?But there's no way I would wait like 2 hours for a chinese restaurant. haha

Oh how I love the wings from San Tung. ?It is actually becoming a problem. A friend showed me San Tung and I've gone back half a dozen times since. Everything I've seen going out to a table looks delectable and there is an extensive menu to choose from. Try the black sauce noodles, they are too good. ?The noodles are thick, like an udon noodle, and the sauce adds a fantastic flavor. ?According to the menu there are other items in the sauce (like meat), but I rarely notice it. Also a huge fan of the string beans. ?I could honestly eat an entire portion in one sitting (that is somewhat healthy, right?). But the pièce de résistance are truly the dry wings. If you want to eat in the restaurant during peak hours, make sure you have some time to wait for a table. ?This place gets slammed and there is often a long waitlist. ?The interior is crowded, but not uncomfortably so. ?The food comes out quickly as they are doing their best for a quick turnaround.

After hearing how amazing San Tung's chicken wings are, I was excited to finally get to try them! We ordered the pork dumplings, an order of the dry fried chicken wings, and rice (I'm Filipino; I eat everything with rice....and a spoon & fork). The pork dumplings were good and seasoned nicely, though they looked a little sad. I guess steamed dumplings really aren't that attractive, and you're looking for flavor anyway, right?! After seeing literally 10+ orders of chicken wings go by our table, we started to get more excited. Finally, a server set a plate down on our table, and I almost cheered with joy. First bite...mmm, crispy, spicy, and sweet. Nice texture for sure. After devouring the whole plate, my husband and I came to the conclusion that while they were good, they were a bit on the sweet side for us, especially when you get towards the bottom of the pile and one side of each wing is completely covered in the sticky sauce. I was a little disappointed because I was expecting a little more heat (and trust me, I'm a pansy when it comes to spicy stuff) to counterbalance the sweet. All in all, I'd come back! (Side note: I was fully expecting this to be a dingy, hole-in-the-wall Chinese restaurant. It's very clean inside!) A couple of tips: - When you get in, write your name on the white board (immediately to the right when you enter). - Wait too long? Go next door to Next Door Sweets; apparently the owner is a San Tung family member, so they serve the chicken wings and sauteed green beans (and a few other items). Plus their boba is pretty good AND they have a whole slew of interesting gelato flavors.

Boy. ?I can't believe that I"m going to be the contrarian on this restaurant, but I don't get it the high rating at all. What's Good. --The wings are good. ? ?Not the mecca of chicken wings, but good. --Steamed dumplings. ?Pretty good. ? Tasty, nice broth, pasta had just the right bite. What's Not So Great. --Long wait... ?A long line to begin with to sit down, then a really r e a l l y slow kitchen. ?15+ minutes between dishes... ? --Shrimp and Tofu. ?Really: ?Frozen peas? (they were still frozen...) ?Canned Mushrooms? ?Frozen Overcooked Shrimp? ?Bleech. FInal Thoughts... I thought that the food pretty Americanized which isn't necessarily bad... Sweet and Sour soup, Mu Shu Pork, chow mein, etc... ? It's definitely not worth 2-3 hour investment. ?If you're in the hood, and need a bunch of wings for the game, that's a different story.

I've been here 6 times and will continue to keep coming back. The dried fried chicken NEVER gets old. I've had it both ways, boneless and on the bone. I prefer it boneless. I suppose that's just a matter of preference though. I always try something new when I come back here as well. Everything, to be honest, has been delicious so far. This is one of my favorite spots in the city. It is a bit of a wait every single time, but I always walk away feeling like it's worth it! Definitely be prepared to wait, but I feel like the wait creates an anticipation that makes it taste that much better!

Crappy service. ?Long wait. ?We went at 9pm so no excuses for the service to be below par! ?We asked for just 1 additional round of the kimchi dish that they serve in the beginning TWICE and both waiters never got it for us! ?It put me off in a worse mood than I was already with waiting for the line to end! http://www.yelp.com/biz_… Other than poor customer service, food is great, but not to a point where I would go back for it and wait in a loooooooooong line! ? ATMOSPHERE - Average Chinese restaurant decor. ?During peak hours, they ask if you want to share a table with another party. ?You either join and feel awkward during the whole dining experience or wait another 15-30 minutes. FOOD - Of course, get their infamous fried chicken waangs that everyone raves about!! ?They are indeed crispy, fresh out from the kitchen and sauced up with yummy goodness! http://www.yelp.com/biz_… Get their Black Bean Noodles with Pork (Ja ja mein)! ?Mix the sauce on top and you will be slurping the noodles up like no tomorrow. ?The next thing you'll know, it's gone! ; ( http://www.yelp.com/biz_… Their Seafood Fried Rice is pretty good! ?It goes great with the sauce from the fried chicken wings! http://www.yelp.com/biz_… Final say - Poor customer service!

So really, what's the big deal about this place? We came in on several recommendations. ?We get in, and no one even acknowledges us, even when we go up to them to ask about putting our name in. ?Turns out someone was standing in front of the mini chalk board everyone is expected to put their name on, even though said guy standing there just wiped half the names off of it. We waited for about 20min. ?I don't mind a long wait, and this wasn't bad at all. ?What I do mind is that there are plenty of empty tables, more than enough to accommodate everyone waiting. ?But nobody is bussing table, just hanging out, joking around. Ok, guy in charge of the little chalk board comes around and can barely read. ?"Angela?" ?"Did you mean Ashley?" ?"Are you Angela?" "No, I'm Ashley, party of two." ?"Is there an Angela?" ?No, there's no Angela! ?Get to the next names! Finally a clear table and we are seated. ?We had heard someone at another table ask for (and I quote), "Two orders of wings, one dry, one wet." ?That sounds great! ?So our waiter comes up and asks for our order. ? "Two orders of wings, one dry, one wet." ? "What do you mean?" ? "Don't you have two types of wings?" ? "Yeah, but what do you mean?" ? "Don't you have dry and wet wings?" "Yeah, but what do you mean? ?That's what dry wings look like." At this point, I would like to call BS, since what he calls dry wings are dripping with a viscous sauce. ?Fine, don't care, just give us ANY wings. ?But we wanted to try both. "Are you sure you want the wet ones? ?Most people like the dry wings? ?Are you sure you want both?" "Uhh... no???" So after being talked out ordering their food, we got the food we were allowed to order. ?"Dry" chicken wings, green beans, and rice. ?The rice and green beans were fine. ?The kimchi was excellent, went well with everything and on it own. But the chicken? ?Did I miss something? ?We didn't so much get chicken wings as a caramel apple, but instead of an apple it was chicken. ?Way too sweet and difficult to eat. ?The sauce was so thick, I tried to pick up a wing and the whole plate came with it. I've had some great wings that had balanced flavor and texture, but this place just doesn't have it. ?Did I get a bad batch? ?Possibly. ?The good part is that they constantly make wings, so you get your food fairly quickly. ?But with the poor service and wings that might be better if you just tone down the sauce, not a place I need to come back to.

Dried or wet chicken wings, get it. The rest are mediocre Chinese food. Be prepared to wait between 30 minutes to 1 hour. ?The service here is just as your regular Chinese restaurant... It's not the best, nor the worse. The Wings... It's flavorful, juicy, with a small hint of spiciness cooked to perfection for your savory taste buds. ?It's one of the highlights in SF that you must try considering the fact that it has over 3000+ reviews. ?If you don't get chicken wings here, then I don't know what you're here for. Oh yeah, I heard next door to the restaurant (some drink place) serves San Tung food as well. ?You can order the food and dine in there if you don't want to wait that long at the san tung restaurant.

SAN TUNG @!%#!O$*!$%!!^^# SO FREAKIN' GLAD I TRIED THIS PLACE. It was so good we went twice on our trip #embarrasing. 1st visit we only waited about 30 minutes. 2nd visit we were there right when they opened and literally when the clock hit 11:00am everyone started rushing to the door. it was HILARIOUS i couldnt stop laughing. INFAMOUS dry chicken wings: 5 stars! Dont need to explain anything to you. just order it. Ja jang myeon aka "black bean noodles": 4 stars! i usually dont like these and i actually liked it at san tungs. mu shu pork: 4 stars! this dish was ordered by accident but it was really good. basically sauteed pork with veggies and they give you wraps and hoision sauce to make little wraps with. leek dumplings: 3 stars! dont see why its a highlight. I only ordered it because it seemed popular but i could pass on these. save yo money!

Truthfully I've been seeing San Tung's wings all over my Instagram and my GF had mentioned that she wanted to try it out. I'm always hesitant about driving all the way out to this area because parking sucks and it's just really far down 19th usually. Also I'm not a huge fan of Chinese food but I'm glad we made the journey! B R I E F ?S U M M A R Y -- Parking sucks but after 6pm you can park at the meters for free -- If all the tables are full, the staff will write your name on the dry eraser board -- Service was just OK, they don't check on you really -- Dry wings = sauced wings -- Wet wings = wings IN sauce -- Dry wings are flavorful and good -- Potstickers are good (but you have to make your own sauce) -- Dry fried beef is good & has same sauce as wings -- San Tung house shrimps has good flavor but they're not peeled? Not sure if you're supposed to eat the whole shrimp with its shell or not (don't recommend) - Dried sauteed stringbeans were a great side dish of veggies -- Family style food Well my GF and I got lucky because we only waited 5 minutes for a table on Saturday night around 8pm AND we got parking right across the street at a meter. I felt like it was a sign that we were supposed to come here. Originally I was dragging my feet because I didn't want to go all the way down 19th. The drive wasn't too bad, again surprisingly. The truth is the dry wings are exceptional. I'm not sure if I'd go out of my way to come here or if I'm ever going to crave them but they are very good. I wanted a bit more flavor so I started eating the dried peppers that were in the sauce. If you want a kick of spice, try it! I wanted to get a boneless chicken but it seemed like overkill since we got the wings. Thus I opted for the dried fried beef which tasted like a breaded chicken and it had the same sauce as the wings. I ate that with rice and was very happy. The string beans seem to be a trend for my girlfriend and I lately. There's nothing like a healthy serving of string beans to offset all the fat and crabs you're cramming into your mouth. Plus they have a bit of crunch. I was please with the potstickers because they were crispy on the outside yet chewy and also very hot! I made a good blend of vinegar and soy sauce to dip them in. I wish I had the potsticker sauce packets but I was suprised that the potstickers were so good. So many places mess up potstickers lol. Probably the weakest dish we had was the San Tung house shrimp. The flavor was great but the shrimp were served whole. I thought it wouldn't be a big deal and we would be able to peel the shell but the sauce was too sticky and everything just stuck to your fingers. We mostly ordered this dish to try some type of seafood that they offered. I wouldn't recommend this unless you want to eat the shell? I don't know just was a bit confusing. Service was uh... take your order, give you water, give you food and give you check. They're a very busy place as you can see by some people's reviews saying they waited 45 minutes. I personally wouldn't wait that long and am really glad it was a quick meal. We definitely ordered a lot of food for two and took a lot of food home but it was a pretty good experience overall. I'm not sure we'll have the same experience again but I would definitely recommend and will be back someday.

I'm not always a big fan of Chinese food. I think its too fried, too greasy or too bland. Our aunt and uncle took us here for the first time and I was actually pretty floored by how great it was. Bustling, 30 min-1 hour wait. Rushing waiters and a long menu to share family style. The sole reason our cousin insisted on coming was for their dry chicken wings which are glazed with some honey sauce. They were awesome. We shared sizzling rice soup, garlic chicken, mongolian beef, green beans. It was all flavorful and fresh. If you can get in early you should go! I'm a convert!

I've heard this name tossed around with the term fried chicken. After being officially signed up to live in SF (yay, signed the lease!), we walked around and decided on eating here. There was an awful, metallic, smell, coming from some construction right outside of this restaurant. We get into the restaurant, and the smell is gone. Phew. We get seated immediately, as we came in before the lunch rush. We were handed menus, a tea pot, and kimchi. I was a bit confused because I didn't know they served stuff other than chicken. Opening the menu, I was pleasantly surprised to find this to be one of those chinese-korean fusion places. We decided on garlic eggplant, dry fried chicken lunch special, and combination spicy soup noodles. After we ordered, (we talked to him in chinese), and he insisted that we get the a la carte order of chicken. Nobody ever orders the small order, and that we'd end up ordering another order anyway. lol, okay fine, we'll do it. So we upgraded. While waiting for our food, we ate the kimchi, which was pretty delicious. It was spicy, and flavourful, while still crunchy and crispy. It got to be a bit spicy for me... During our wait, the place slowly started filling up around 12 noon time. The eggplant came out first. It's very different than most places, but still good. Almost in a way reminded me of how some bitter melons are cooked (but this isn't bitter melon). Also, this was a green eggplant, not purple. Next, the chicken came out. It was crispy on the outside, and flavourful. It definitely lived up to its hype. Yum! we ended up finishing the whole plate of them! Finally, the noodle soup came out. I really enjoyed this dish. My korean friend mentioned it's one of the best ones he's ever eaten. The seafood was fresh, and the noodles were cooked perfectly. The soup was balanced nicely with spiciness, seafood, and broth flavour. I'd recommend this place! I don't think I'd wait more than 30-45 minutes for it though. Just come during the non-rush hour times and you're all good :)

Reservations for 6+ is a must. Call in 415-242-0828. Don't hesitate or you will regret it deeply. The wait is amazingly long and no one leaves the waiting pool. * Original Dry Fried Chicken Wings $9.50 Chicken wings deep fried in a batter with garlic, ginger, and roasted red peppers. (5 of 5) - ?It is like how everyone raves about - A WOW. It is delicious. It is a bit messy, but the garlic, ginger, and roasted red peppers are still perfect. The wings are delicious and the sauce is intense but perfect with the wings. It is the top choice to order when eating at San Tung. * Original Dry Fried Chicken Diced $9.50 Chicken slices no bone deep fried in a batter with garlic, ginger, and roasted red peppers. (4.5 of 5) ?- So it is the same cooking and batter and sauce as the wings, but because it is mostly white meat, it is not as delicious. And when it comes down to it, wings are delicious to eat. But for the rather timid or lazy, this is a wonderful secondary choice to the messy wings. But if you have enough people, you should order BOTH wings and diced. * Dry Black Bean Sauce Noodles $9.50 Shrimp, Calamari, and Scallops in a dry dark soybean sauce served over a bowl of fresh homemade noodles (4.5 of 5) - Delicious. But super messy and I always have to find some way to cut the noodles. They are so long and it doesn't come pre-tossed. So someone also has to toss the sauce and noodle together. But it is worth it. Just make sure you are not wearing white, there is always high chance the delicious and tasty black bean sauce will spatter on your shirt. But this is another top choice to order when eating at San Tung. * Braised Bean Curd $8.00 Fresh flash fried triangle tofu tossed with a nice mixture of vegetables in a garlicky sauce (3.5 of 5) - This is a good vegetarian dish. Because everything else tastes so much better, it is hard to rate this vegetable dish as high. Nothing special, but a good vegetable dish. * Dried Sauteed String Beans $8.00 Fresh Green Beans Flash Fried and Tossed in a garlicky Sauce with Chinese Pickle (4.5 of 5) - Another popular dish. Flash Fried Green Beans cooked perfectly. Taste like tossed tempura but without the batter. Delicious. The statement is be smart about eating here. Either make reservations for 6+ in advance OR consider TAKE OUT. This place has long wait and it is because the food is worth it. There are a lot of copy cats, but at the end, this place still reigns number one for Dry Fried Chicken Wings.

What a tasty place to eat ! I'm sure what I'm about to say hasn't gone unsaid yet for San Tung. It's chinese food :) and good chinese food at that. The wings , as previously stated, are very good, very close to a Bon-Chon style wing but better and not as heavily battered. We also tried the Mongolian Beef and a pork dish which was also tasty. Service is good, wait was a little long but the attendants were quick to bus the tables and keep everything moving along, would definitely come back when we're in town, just plan to come early than anticipated. And parking sucks, so plan for that as well :)

The best chicken wings I've had. Make sure you get the dried one. Also the black bean noodles. Enough said :) I suggest you come here half hour before they close so you don't have to wait awhile. Or take your chance and come at dinner time and wait about an hour. Mmm my mouth just got watery just thinking about them infamous chicken waaaangs.

IMO it depends on the chef who is preparing your food This time around I was not so pleased Wings: heavy handed on the white pepper but cooked well Shrimp in Lobster sauce: way over salted! Shrimp was rubbery Mushroom w/ Bok Choy: standard, nothing outstanding Pork w/ Green Onions: tender strips of pork seasoned moderately well. Would have preferred more intensity of flavor Overall thoughts On a good night, San Tung is top notch, on off days you will leave wondering what all the hype was about

Long wait but worth it!! maybe 45 mins but they keep the line moving and they utilize all the space they can. Chicken rings were sweet and fried 12 in an order and while I like bonchon more it was pretty good. They had sweet and sour beef (fried) with veggies which i really really liked since the sauce was over half of it so you can decide if you like it more dry or not. We had the green beans and the JJM noodles. Both huge portions and worth getting!

We came on Christmas Eve around 2:30pm, we waited about 30 minutes for a table for two. There were so many people we ended up sharing a 6 top with another couple. It was a little annoying that they kept shaking the table as they were talking, they probably didn't even notice. But on to the food: We didn't want to order too much as we were having dinner with family at 7pm. As I looked around at all the tables, I saw that everyone ordered the chicken wings! Of course we had to order that as well, and started off with the pork mu shu. Everything was delicious! I've never had pork mu shu before, you get wraps that you put the pork mu shu in and dip it in hoisin sauce. ?The chicken wings came out very saucy. I love all things saucy, so needless to say, I enjoyed it very much. There's a slight crisp when you bite into it, and it has a sweet savory flavor. I felt like I was eating a candy chicken! I can see why everyone is so fond of these chicken wings, it's definitely a must try! A tip would be to come here around 3-4pm, that's when the rush ends and plenty of parking.

Okay now I have high expectations. We ordered the leek and shrimp dumplings. It was really moist and tender. I liked it! But it couldn't take the spotlight of the next dish. The fried chicken. Took a bite of it and I'M HOOKED! It had a caramelized sugar glaze to it and was crisp to perfection. I couldn't get over the fact of the super tender white meat that was savory on the inside. Every single wing and thigh I ate I made sure to clean ALL of the meat off. It was so good, my partner and I had to take order an extra one to-go. Yes, and do believe we pretty much had to hold ourselves back from ordering 3 extra ones! The wait on Christmas was less than 10 minutes. That's fairly since we had to share a round table with another couple, but of course we didn't mind because that place was PACKED and we originally had 7 people ahead of us. On our way out, I couldn't help but notice EVERY single table had an order of fried chicken and black bean noodle. Well that surely means I'm going to have to come back and try their black bean noodles! With an extra order of fried chicken please!

Great food, decent price, but dreadful wait at dinner time. The length of the queue is enough to deter a lot of people (I would turn around and walk the other way if it were my first time there). As a local, I loathe the wait and would rarely go at peak hours. I tend to go near closing. Whether you enjoy lightly flavored dishes or have a passion for heavy flavor dishes they have something for you on their menu. Several dishes that stood out from my dining experience at the location: - steamed dumplings: They are bite size and the light broth is just right - dried sauteed string beans: really flavorful and great for going with rice - dry fried chicken wing: This is what people are raving about. When fresh, this dish is definitely one of the top wing dishes I've tried. In a nutshell: If you don't mind a noisy environment and a 15-30mins wait, it's definitely worth a try. But if you're looking for a quite meal in a quit environment, look elsewhere.

The food here is great. ?The dried fried wings are 5 star. ?All the other food I would say is 4 starred goodness. ?All of their dough based dishes are really good. ?It's not something most people notice but the quality of dough is great in their noodles. ?The springiness of the dough in their dumplings is exceptional as well. ?In dough, you are looking for the right thickness, resistance in bite, and the overall doneness when delivered to you. ?San Tung gets these all right. ?The sizzling rice soup is especially tasty and the dumplings/noodles are all really good. ?I have to give them a deduction for their menu. ?Not the paper itself but there are some items on there that just don't hold up to the standard items like the dry fried wings hold. ?Items like the cherry chicken are uninspiring. ?The dry fried string beans are decent but I've definitely had much better dry fried string beans so there are definitely areas for improvement. ?Then there is the line. ?expect to wait 40 minutes unless you get there around 11am when they open or around 5pm when sane people do not usually come out to eat dinner. ?Pro-tip: when you go to San Tung, IMMEDIATELY go inside, turn right, you'll see a white-board, grab a marker, and write your name and party size. ?That is their wait list and there is almost always a wait. ?Furthermore, you can see just how long the list is so you can always give your chance to back out. ?No one says you have to wait 30-40 minutes. ?It's YOUR CHOICE! For some explanation for the Korean / Chinese hybrid theme at this place, San Tung is a different spelling of Shandong. ?This is an area of China that is directly across the northern part of the East China Sea, which on the other side lies Korea.

Met up my friend Tiffany for dinner here for around 8pm. Luckily i was running late for once and she beat me there. Good thing cause she was able to get a table for the two of us right away. Right when i got there parking was not the best since construction on Irving limited more parking. Also, a lined started to form outside and i was dying hungry since i last ate a meal around noon. Regarding the chicken, it was my first time ever eating here and i have heard and read all the rave about the chicken wings. First of all, most people seated already had some food but it took nearly 25min to get our 1 order of wings. At least are dumplings came out within 5 min as i would have starved to death. Dumplings were meh to me nothing special at all. So back to the chicken...I thought they were good and flavorful. It reminded of some chicken from a thai restaurant that i can't remember at the moment. Decent amount of wings and drumsticks given to us. Like others said I like how its not super drenched in sauce and still get the crunchy texture i like. I would definately come back but prolly not on a weekend as i figure it would be super packed or if anything i would order to go and pick it up.

What are they known for: Crispy chicken! If you dine in, you'll see almost all the tables get this. Apparently, it's very popular! I only wanted to try the chicken here but we ended up dining in as well for lunch. All their other dishes are pretty typical so I'll leave that out. All you want from here is their chicken! It depends how hungry you are but if you just want a snack, order one dish to share maybe? It's very flavorful and I like it how it's saucy but crispy at the same time! The sauce is kinda sweet but not too spicy. It reminds me of the sauce that they use for oysters at Chinese's restaurants? TIP: order next door when it's too crowded at the restaurant. Same owner! They serve the exact same food minus the longg longgg wait at the restaurant! It gets crowded alright around lunch/dinner!!

This place seems to always be busy (even right before closing), and rightfully so! All around, San Tung has pretty good food. My favorite dishes were the Dry Diced Fried Chicken and Hot and Sour Soup. The chicken was sweet, but also had a slight kick. Towards the end of the dinner, the chicken bits became a little too sweet since it tasted like it was candied, but it was very enjoyable before it got to that point. The soup was lightly peppered and filled with delicious eggs! I love how they didn't skimp on any of the ingredients. We also had the Beef with String Beans. The dish was very good as the String Beans were cooked perfectly to a nice crunch. Normally this dish comes with chicken instead of beef, but since we already had a chicken dish, we had requested this dish to come with beef instead. The restaurant accommodated our request without a problem. Two other dishes we had, the Combination Fried Rice and Pork Dumplings, weren't very special, but still enjoyable. I would not mind coming again if given the chance!

So I have a slight addiction to Asian Chicken wings like bonchon or kyochon, etc etc. So when someone told me that there is this awesome chicken wing place not too far from where I live, I knew I had to check it out. So as a warning, this has to be the most difficult place to park at. Cars are always zooming around trying to grab a spot as they are limited so definitely buffer some time in for parking. You will know that you are at the right place because there will probably be a line out the door especially any time after 6 pm. The service is just okay and they don't really check on you. No issues because this place is more set up to be a get in, eat your food, and then get out which I am okay with as long as I'm getting these wings. I went there with three other people and we order the Dry wings as well as the wet wings, and the black bean noodles, along with the shrimp and leek dumplings. I would say the dumplings and noodles were solid and definitely enjoyable but why waste any stomach room on something other than the legendary wings. Both of the wings were awesome. They are flavorful, juicy, and have the nice amount of kick to them making them delicious. ?The sauce that it is in has perfect hints of garlic and ginger making it a solid item to devour. ?Definitely hit this place up but yes as everyone warns the service is not the greatest which is true but trust me when I say you will get over it once you take a bite into these wings.

Pros: Chicken wings---BEST chicken I have had!!!! String beans- cooked just right, not over cooked (limped) but still crunchy to the bite. Dumplings -ALL are tasty, steamy and fresh! ? Mu Shu Pork- hmmmm....it's so tasty, just like comfort food. Love the sauce you put on it. Prices are right....especially for excellent food. Cons: Expect to wait an hour or more if you go on a weekend. I recommend a better waiting system...I feel you have to keep your eyes on the board to make sure no one erases it until you are called. Not a fancy place, but you come here for the food, not the atmosphere. Overall, I love the food at this place....even if I have to wait.

Pros: Dry fried chicken wings! They really are the best chicken wings I've ever had and you'll see them on every table in the restaurant. Crispy, sweet, sticky, hot, moist, and flavorful. Other things I've tried - would I order them again? 1. Black bean sauce noodles (yes) 2. Sauteed string beans (yes) 3. Braised bean curd w/ vegetables (no) 4. Three deluxe spicy sauce noodles (no) 5. Deluxe vegetables (maybe) Cons: Parking is tough. Game of luck and patience. ?Expect 1-1.5 hour wait for a table on the weekends for dinner. Weekday evenings ~10-15 minutes. No nonsense service. Expect speed, not friendliness. Overall, food is pretty greasy and they're a fan of drowning everything in sauce. The one time we paid with cash, they didn't bring any change and assumed a 20% tip, which I didn't appreciate. They were too busy to ever come back to our table once the bill came though. Despite that experience, those darn chicken wings continue to summon me back and really do lead to a satisfying meal every time!

Ok the wings are amazing, the best I've ever had! I understand why everyone talks about this place, but everything else is meh. Got here right before the dinner rush so we got seated immediately. Food: Wings are amazing come for these. The name of the restaurant in Chinese refers to a region in Northern China known for noodles, dumplings, and lots of stewed dishes. We decided to order stuff that is normally northern faire like dumplings and noodles. The dumplings were meh and the noodles were pretty bad...my friends couldn't finish them so I just gulped it down. Service: They're really nice. I spoke to them in Mandarin and felt like the service was good. They served us well and got all the orders out pretty fast. Price: It's fair priced I believe for SF, but I'm not sure a little on the pricey side if you're from the LA area. Would come back for the wings and maybe try some other dishes because we were a small group. This place is small and the line gets packed really quickly.

Wings! Wings! Wings! The thing to get here is definitely the Dry Fried Chicken Wings! ?I took my mom and my sister her while the were visiting me this past weekend. I had a craving for some delicious asian food, because I do not eat it as frequently up in SF. San Tung definitely filled that void. Food: Nothing can compare to the Chinese food back home in the San Gabriel Valley, but San Tung is a satisfactory replacement. The Chicken Wings were crispy while covered in a spicy sweet sauce. Delicious! In addition to the wings I also liked the Tea Smoked Duck, eggplant, and honey walnut shrimp. The Tea Smoked Duck was like pecking duck and was super juicy. Overall the food was pretty tasty. Parking: The parking is a little difficult like anywhere in the city. We had to drive around several times until we finally found parking a few blocks away. Service: The service was pretty good. They were pretty busy, but our party of 7 was seated within 20 minutes of arrival. Once seated the servers were prompt and attentive. The food came out relatively quickly and drinks were quickly refilled. Overall a positive experience. As pretty much every review says: Try the Dry Fried Chicken Wings!

I'm really not a fan of Chinese food, but I love LOVE this place. My fiance and I went to New York 3 months prior to when when we found out about this place and while we were there, my cousin took us to this place that sold a dish that was called Bon Chon Chicken, or something close to that pronounciation. Anyway, ever since that day I've been craving those Chicken wings. I was talking to my co-worker about that best fried chicken that I ate in New York and when I was describing she said it sounds like the Chicken from San Tung and I should try it. A week later my fiance was craving Chinese food so I brought up San Tung. What we got.. We started out with Won Ton Soup which was absolutely fabulous! The wontons were plump and meaty and the shrimp and broth was amazing as well. Then we got the Famous Fried Chicken, which was in fact the same ones that I had in New York! I'm in trouble! I live about a 5-10 minute drive to this place. I know I'll end up being a regular for their Chicken! It had the right amount of crunch, which I love. Then we got string beans, which had a nice crunch to it. Even though it was braised a little, it still tasted healthy to me! Then last we ordered the potstickers. The potstickers were nice and plump. I can't really rate this one because I ate it when I had a tummy full of food, which cause that sick to my stomach feeling. I have to try it again. Our waiter was very friendly. Overall, I know we have found our Go-To Chinese restaurant! I would definately recommend this place. The only downfall is the wait. There are always people lining up. That just shows how good this place is!

A mixed bag indeed. ?WIth almost nothing but 4 and 5 star reviews from my friends, I came in with high hopes. ?Unfortunately, some dishes shined while others fell painfully flat. Original Dry Fried Chicken WIngs: Delicious! ?The sauce provided a great balance of peppery spice, garlic and sweetness while the skin was perfectly crisped to seal in all the juices. Dried Sauteed String Beans: Fresh and actually quite sweet, but the exteriors could've been more crispy given its preparation. Shrimp & Leek Dumplings: Finely diced filling and pretty tasty, but nothing out of the ordinary. Braised Bean Curd: Not fresh, way oversalted and inedible after the first bite. ?Awful dish. Three Deluxe Spicy Sauce Noodles: The spice was there, too bad I can't say the same about flavor. ?Again, old news after a couple bites and the seafood wasn't fresh either. Verdict? ?The infamous chicken wings were very tasty though short of amazing. ?Everything else...take it or leave it. ?On the upside, prices were very reasonable and the service was good for a Chinese place.

I always come back for the wings. For the most part, the taste is consistent but sometimes it can be a little less saucey or more sticky. If I'm dining in, I always get a soup (won ton or hot and sour) and combination fried rice. They never fail me.

Do NOT come here for their over-priced Chinese food. You can get MUCH more authentic Chinese food in this area for cheaper and better quality. DO however, come here for their DRY FRIED CHICKEN!! Oh sooo crispy and good!!! The BEST fried chicken I've ever had! Lots of meat too, so it's not all just fried skin. Do NOT, I repeat, DO NOT get it to-go. It's really not the same, because it gets all soggy and gross. If you HAVE to get it to go, get the fried wet chicken. It's already coated in sogginess anyways. Most people like their dry fried chicken more than their wet ones, and I have to concur. Their wet chicken is just wayyyy too saucy. For three people, I think 2 plates of chicken (MAX!) is good enough. I felt disgusting afterwards, because their sauce was too heavy. My palate was overloaded, and no matter how much water and tea I drink, it just didn't clean my palate. This place is not one of those restaurants I'll come back to over and over again. Eating this everyday will make me SICK.

I've heard so many great things about this place so I had high hopes and was pretty excited to eat here! My friend and I were seated right away. We were given the menu promptly and about a minute after, I was asked if I was ready to order. I just barely opened the menu!!! Keep in mind that we arrived right at 11AM (at opening) so only 3 other tables had customers! It was not busy at all! So why hurry?? Since I didn't get to check out the menu yet I asked the waiter what is good on the menu and the guy said, "It doesn't matter." WTF?!?!?! What does he mean it doesn't matter?? I should've gotten up and left. I told him I needed more time and just checked yelp for suggestions! Thanks Yelpers! At least y'all are more helpful than the man that works there! Suggestions: The Chicken Wings and Curry Chicken are really good! And the bathroom is filthy!

So I was getting my hair cut in Napa by my favorite stylist ever, Cindy (at ?Vanity for Guys and Dolls in Napa, totally worth the drive from SF http://www.yelp.com/biz/…) ?Anyway, she told me about this really fun weekend she had with her friend that ended with the "best wings in the city." ?I didn't even know that my favorite chinese food place was known bay-area wide as the best wings and she looked at me like I was so out of the loop. My dad and I LOVE San Tung and go there pretty regularly, more than any other place we've been. ? One warning - they like their chili peppers and if you aren't big on heat order everything mild. ?If you are a wimp like me, ask for no peppers. A few of my favorite things: -Dry Fried Wings. ?These are seriously the most amazing thing on the menu, they are know bay area-wide for a reason. ?Get them. ?It is amazing how many orders you see coming out of that kitchen! -Mongolian beef. ?A lot of places have that super thinly sliced kind of dry beef, this is moist and delicious, but definitely heavy on the peppers, just saying. ? My dad generally judges a place by their mongolian beef, they passed :) -Chicken Chow Mein. ?Lots of chicken and fresh veggies, absolutely delicious! -Pot Stickers. ?Really yummy. Also, we get all of this for about $40 and usually order to go. ?Plan on getting a pretty good amount of food, we usually have left overs, another bonus. If you plan to go there and eat any time, be prepared to wait. ?If you order to go, plan to push through the crowd of people that are waiting! ? Parking is rough as this is a popular area on Irving Street. ?Either way, go get some San Tung!

Finally a restaurant that deserves all the hype. Been meaning to dry this place for a long time now, but the first time we got here around 6:30 on a Thursday evening it was an hour wait so we bounced. Second time we got here less than an hour before closing and got seated right away. Although there was no wait, the restaurant was still almost fully packed. What we ordered: Dry black bean noodle - pretty good Original Chicken Wings - definitely deserves an OMG The chicken here definitely lives up to the hype. Crispy, flavorful, and yet still moist. It rivals all but the best of the best Korean fried chicken. And to boot, everything on the menu is decently priced. Under $10 for 12 chicken wings. They also give you complimentary spicy chinese style kimchi. Service is typically of a chinese restaurant, but the food makes up for it. On the menu they also had smoked ducked with steamed buns. Will definitely have to come back to try that along with my own personal order of chicken wings.

This joint is so bumpin' you'd swear San Tung is passing out food for free. They're not... but the chicken wings are somewhat of a phenomenon that brings the crowds. The rest of the dishes are decent Chinese food, but nothing you can't find elsewhere. Always packed on weekends. To avoid the inevitable wait, order takeout.

I'm sad because what used to be one of my very favorite restaurants is no longer a favorite. Every time we tried to flag down a waiter they would look the other way. ?All of their waitstaff has changed and not for the better. But I guess from their point of view, do less work since they get paid by the hour anyway. I wasn't too pleased with this. We got our food really fast after ordering. Didn't think this was going to be bad but the dry fried chicken wings were lukewarm at best. Then when we bit into them they were still a little red inside. They have to have also changed chefs. Then the black bean sauce noodles had barely any seafood in them. Two shrimps and two scallops. Noodles still tasted good but didn't seem proportional. We had to let them know about the chicken wings because we didn't want anyone to get salmonella. They gave us 4 new chicken wings which were cooked like how they should be. We were regular customers so we know the manager but he avoided us when we wanted to let him know about the wings. ?I have no hard feelings because I know it's not easy to run a restaurant.

So basically I came here for one thing which was the Dry Fried Chicken wings. ?Was it hype or was it a myth. ?I was surprised when we showed up around noon on a Saturday that they had a couple tables opened. ?I was expecting a crowd based on what I heard. ?They did have a wipe board for names that was ready for 30 but I guess luck was on our side. ?This place was really well staffed especially for a Chinese restaurant so getting sat and getting started was fast and efficient. As soon as we sat down the line begun to form and they hype began to back itself up. ?Had we showed up 10 minutes later we'd be 8-10 groups deep. ?We ordered four dishes. Combination Noodles, Pork Dumplings, Mushrooms and Bamboo shoots, and of course the Chicken Wings. ?The food showed up quickly and guess what, the chicken wings were phenomenal. ?Surprisingly the other 3 dishes were excellent as well. They weren't ground breaking but they certainly weren't textbook flavor wise. This was simply very good Chinese food that accompanies one hell of a plate of Chicken Wings. ?If you are in the area it's worth a stop in. ? If you are in the mood for chicken wings then make the extra effort.

Food: Fried Chicken Wings: the skin is very crispy and the meat is moist. ?The sweet and spicy sauce complements the wings very well. ?recommend. Pork&White Cabbage Dumplings: very bland. ?do not recommend. Tomato and Beef Chow Mein: flavorful, but i would opt out for the black bean noodles if I go back to this restaurant. ? Parking: Street parking. ?The Roomie and I drove around for 1.5 HOURS just to find parking. go figure :/ Overall: The food was good and the wait was minimal. ?There were construction going on when we went, so that was probably the reason for the lack of parking spaces. ?The chicken wings are definitely worth a try. ?They also have a lunch special menu (11-3pm) if you ever go during lunch time.

When I think Chinese food in San Francisco, I think of two things: cheap and generally authentic. ?And so when I was recommended this place by a Chinese San Franciscan, I was a bit surprised to hear that their specialty was chicken wings. ?When it comes to chicken wings I usually think about KFC or Popeye's or even sometimes Korean food but usually not Chinese. ?And so I went to this place. THE GIST: Amazing chicken wings / Meh everything else SERVICE AND SETTING It's loud, a little dirty, crowded, and the servers are busy. ?In other words, it's a typical casual Chinese restaurant in SF. ?Expect to wait in line as usual. FOOD AND VALUE Wet Fried Chicken Wings: Chances are you probably went here for this. ?Yes, they are indeed amazing. ?They're packed with all sorts of mildly spicy flavors thanks to the glaze and the deep fried batter. ?They're extremely moist. ?They're some of the best chicken wings I've had. ?For days after I found myself drooling in my sleep craving more of these succulent chicken wings. Szechuan Tea Smoked Duck: Unfortunately, things fell a bit after the chicken wings. ?It was a little dry, not very meaty. ?While I'll almost always enjoy a Chinese duck platter, this one was quite forgettable. Pork Dumpling: Also mediocre. ?Not much to say about them. For a San Franciscan restaurant this popular, the prices are slightly below average. ?For the quality of the food, the value is quite good. CONCLUSION Go here for the chicken wings. ?Nothing else compares. ?Nothing else matters.

Finally had a chance to try these famous chicken wings on a trip to SF. ?They were nicely crisp on the outside but soft and moist on the inside. ?Perfect. ?We got the dry ones which are coated with a sweet sauce. ?The stars are only for the wings as I can't attest to anything else. ?Arrive early otherwise you will be stuck in line.

San Tung serves amazingly addictive and delicious dry fried chicken wings. It's a popular dish that is most likely ordered at every table. I don't like eating any type of meat off the bone, mainly because I don't like to get my fingers sticky or greasy, but I make an exception for San Tung's dry fried chicken wings. They're very sticky and sweet, not spicy at all. A few drumsticks are given, but the majority of the plate is wings. They're deep fried and remain crunchy, even when soaked in the fantastic sauce. The meat falls off the bone so easily and I find myself cleaning the bone down to the last drop of sauce. Ah, love at first bite. While I enjoyed their Szechuan tea smoked duck dish, I wouldn't order it again because I found it difficult to eat. The duck didn't fall off the bone easily, so I found myself needing to gnaw it off, which just wasn't worth the time. However, the duck was very flavorful and juicy. It's deep fried, so the skin is very crunchy, fatty, and delicious. The salty and smoky flavors are great. The lotus buns that came with the dish were nice and chewy. The mushroom, bamboo shoots, and snow peas in garlic sauce dish was pretty good for a veggie dish. The sauce was not garlicky enough, but it was surprisingly thick and creamy. The bamboo shoots and snow peas have a nice crunch, and the mushrooms were very meaty. The black bean sauce noodles comes with beef, shrimp, and calamari drenched in a thick, slightly salty but savory black bean sauce over noodles. The noodles are kind of sticky and difficult to pry apart at first, but the creamy sauce lubricates them well. Shrimp was lacking, but beef and calamari was plentiful and fresh too. "This is a Chinese restaurant" is a sufficient enough reason to explain the non-existent service. They're very quick with taking orders, so it's helpful to know what you want immediately after sitting down. But to avoid the crowds and lines, order to-go instead.

Like everyone has already said, the dry fried chicken wings are a MUST. You have not lived life until you have had these chicken wings! I first came into this restaurant having not heard any of the hype around it, so had no idea that what I was about to eat was gonna be life changing. So yes, there are a lot of people raving about their chicken wings, and yes, it is well deserved. I lick my fingers everytime and am not ashamed. The main reason why I knocked off a star from this place is because the rest of the food is just so-so. Standard chinese fare and nothing special. I feel like it is almost unfair giving such a high rating to a restaurant just based on one dish, but I can't help it! Those wings are addictive! The service here could also use some work. There a couple of people who work here that need practice smiling or should find a job that doesn't make them so miserable. Take a trip to Disneyland or something.

12/25/2012 My first time at San Tung Chinese Restaurant, and I was impressed! My friend and I decided to hang out since we both had no plans whatsoever, and she said "lets go to San Tung, their chicken wings are the bomb!" It's definitely a hole in the wall, which made the wait time - not exceptionally long, but long enough to make our mouths water! Then again, it was Christmas Day, so long lines are expected. When we were finally seated, we ordered: both (1)dry & wet chicken wings (to taste and see which one we like better) - the dry wings were sweet and savory with just enough sauce to coat + the wet wings were more on the savory side with a hint of black pepper sautéed in a mushroom broth [we both contend that the dry wings were our favorite] , (2) black bean sauce noodles - full of shrimp, vegetables and scallops, the noodles were exceptionally good, though a bit hard to serve since they were long strands, (3) pork dumplings - fresh and delicious [nearly every table we saw ordered them, & (4) honey walnut prawns - something that I like to order, the combination of crisp walnuts battered in honey and the prawns fried then smothered in mayo [it was good, and the prawns were definitely fresh]. I took home some of the leftover wings, and they were still good even after being in the fridge. i don't really eat fried chicken, well, only on certain occasions, such as Popeye's $1.29 for two or when I'm in Chinatown (deep fried in peanut oil). The difference is in taste and texture that makes San Tung's chicken wings unique - not heavily deep fried, and coated in a sweet+savory sauce with your pick of either wet or dry. This is a great place for comfort Chinese food!

This place is gooood. The short list: Get the dry fried chicken wings (definitely the best thing here, the sauce is amazing and the chicken is fried crispy on the outside and succulent on the inside!). ?I've also tried the ja jiang myun and can say it ain't bad. ?The shrimp & leek dumplings are also a good compliment to the wings. All in all if you go here, you gotta get the wings. This place is one of the iconic foodie restaurants in SF, so you gotta swing by here when you get the chance! Food ain't priced badly either! NOTE: Service here is bad and the waiters here are really rude; typical chinese restaurant service.

Came here for the Dry-Fried Chicken Wings featured on the 7x7 Big Eat. http://www.7x7.com/big-e… Am I the only person who DOESN'T like their famous wings?! We got an order togo because the restaurant was really busy and it took 20-30 minutes to get our wings! There were about 12 in a box for ~$10. Honestly, these were too sweet for me, and I don't think they mixed their sauce well because every single wing varied in flavors. One would be sweet, another would be spicy and the next would be a combination of both. They were also really sticky and too saucy for me but that may be because I was expecting dry wings because of its name. I can't say anything about their other food because I haven't had it, but based solely on the wings, I don't think I'll be back.

3000+ reviews!?!.. Only in SF.. This place is definitely as good as it's hyped up to be and very authentic. ?For food we tried the fried chicken wings, black bean noodles with pork, and dried sauteed string beans. ?Everything was delicious. ?The interior feels somewhat cramped and even on a Saturday afternoon around 2:30pm we had to wait for 20 minutes for a table for 4. ? Overall good food experience, but am unlikely to come here frequently due to the wait.

San TUNG you suck. I call in my order at 4:30 PM, you tell me 25 minutes. that means 4:55. I think to myself, they are ALWAYS BEHIND, let' go pic up the food at 5:15. YOU KNOW WHAT TIME MY ORDER WAS READY? 6:15 !!! I called at 4:30! That's almost 2 hours...I waited in that crappy small as a sardine box waiting area for an hour, with my ass in someone's face as they are trying to eat their dinner. You have to shift back and forth between servers, it's nuts. ?If you wonder why your neighbors get mad, it's because of all of the musical parking that you have to do because YOU don't give your customers an honest pick up time! I could care less if I called in and you said, wow we are busy, your order wont be ready for an hour and a half. I'd then be there in an hour and a half, ?but for the love of jesus, BE HONEST WITH YOUR CUSTOMERS ABOUT PICK UP TIMES! People are tired of the lies, many of my friends joke about it and say the same thing, you'll say it will be ready by 5:00, but you know to be there an EXTRA 30 minutes later @ 5:30. THE FOOD AIN'T ALL THAT GREAT EITHER. Ok my rant is done, but my time is just as valuable as yours san tung, please try to remember that.

WOW! ?I did a quick Yelp search and the high reviews caught my attention. ?So we went to the restaurant and the place was packed (and this was about 3:30 in the afternoon!) ?We ordered sweet and sour pork and almond chicken to go. ?It took about 45 minutes but we expected a long wait. ?By the time our order was complete there was a crowd of people outside the restaurant waiting to be seated. ?(tell-tale sign this place was good). ?Our food was amazing! ?Our second visit included the chicken wings (which are very popular) and once again we were very satisfied with our meal. ?I live in SoCal but if I'm in the area this will be on my priority list.

yup, the dry chicken wings are great. crispy, glazed, tender, sweet, salty, delicious. I absolutely hate waiting in line and would not endure an hour+ wait for them though. I went at 11:30a on a weekday and the restaurant was about half full. By 12p there were people waiting for a table. oh i almost forgot about their complimentary spicy pickled cabbage! SO GOOD. can i buy that stuff on the side?? service was good, quick, to the point. like all chinese restaurants should be. As a first-timer, i also ordered what others call "the staples" : black bean noodles, pork dumplings, and dry fried green beans. Honestly, none of those stood out to me. I think there are plenty of better dumpling places (at least in SM) and the seafood in the noodles was really tough. I like flash fried/dried string beans but i can also get them at any other chinese take out place. 4 stars it is then (5 for the wings, 3 for the other dishes)

This is basicaly a Korean interpretation of Chinese food restaurant and is quite unique in San Francisco. I know about this as I once walked into a Chinese restaurant in Honolulu--only to be met with mostly Korean patrons and workers, with Korean menus and all! I really enjoyed the food, especially the dumplings. I have been to this restaurant about 5 times already and the first 4 times, the famous chicken wings were great; however, the last time I went, the chicken was not as good as I remembered. It might be due to different workers preparing it, or I might be having one of those days where I was a bit critical. Service is good, my girlfriend accidently dropped the glass and it and the plate shattered into tiny piece. About three workers ran up and quickly cleared the mess--very attentive of them! We were not sure if we were going to be charged for the broken plate and glass; however, we were not charged for them. It was very sweet for them so we gave them a larger tip to cover for the expenses. The wait is long, and can take an hour--but if you have never tried Korean interpretation of Chinese food, you should definitely try it at least once!

Heard about this place since long time ago, tonight we tried it finally, I saw a pic from a yelper, it looks yummy. For sure we had order the Dry fried chicken wings, and we had Black bean sauce noodles, Shrimp and leek dumplings and Hot and sour soup(I'm not big fan of this soup). All yummy in my experienced, hmm... dumplings were taste good dip with the vinegar with spicy sauce, my little monster ate half bowl of Black bean sauce noodles. I'm wondering how could they made the chicken wings that crispy. We all hella like it !

This is a review for a take-out meal that my husband and I purchased. The restaurant was packed when we went and I always take that as a great sign that the food is good. ?They managed to cook our big order quickly which pretty impressive. The almond chicken was bland but at least the pieces of chicken they used were really tender. Also, there wasn't much almonds in the "almond chicken". The black bean noodles was pretty tasty although it had a strong seafood scent to it. It actually tasted different the next day because the seafood smell became stronger. ?It was just too funky for me to eat the next day so I threw it away. ?I really hate wasting food! ?The potstickers were huge and the filling was really good. I just wish they had a really good sauce to dip them in, aside from the soy sauce that was provided. The fried rice is also good but it's nothing different from the fried rice you get at Panda Express. The best dish we got here was the Dry Fried Beef. ?My husband and I definitely inhaled that in one sitting. The sauce was amazing and the beef was perfectly crispy. I was really happy that the beef they used was tender and it definitely was far from being "beef jerky" status. ?I would come back to this restaurant just to get my hands on this dish again. I was actually disappointed because my mind wasn't blown by the dishes that we bought. At 3000+ reviews with four stars, I was expecting to have a foodgasm....but sadly, my tastebuds weren't titillated at all. Perhaps, the food would be better if we ate at the restaurant? Maybe next time we will eat in the restaurant. Hopefully my tastebuds will be happier the next time around.

Long waits with so-so service, but the DRY CHICKEN WINGS are definitely worth the wait and the hype!! ?CRISPY HONEY'd bites of joy. The other foods I've tried have been good, but over-hyped and not unique. Order TO-GO, and come pick up 1 hour later (even though they say "45 minutes," it's really 1 hour).

San Tung does have really good chicken wings. If you go there, you should always order: the chicken wings. Just ask for it - they know what you're talking about. It's always usually very busy and the wait can be awhile. So we ordered a lot of dishes here and here are some notes on the memorable ones: 1. Green beans - I thought I like them but I noticed they put sugar in them. It's slightly sweet but I like the crispiness in them. 2. Chicken Wings - we got two orders of them and you can't go wrong. However, I do think if you eat them too much, they aren't as special as they used to be. I remember when I first ate them, they were amazing and now, they're good but it doesn't leave the same impact! 3. Kim-Chi Noodles - It wasn't the black bean noodles but instead it had this red, spicy sauce on it. I like it though because I like the kick and flavor to it. Service: It is a Chinese restaurant. They sit you, give you water and utensils, take your order and serve you your food, and you're left alone. If you need service, wave them down like crazy. They are running around trying to do things and they don't care what's going on as long as you got your food. To avoid the long lines, you can always do take-out. I do that a lot and NextDoorSweets apparently has the chicken wings!

Ok, heres the scoopy poo. The original dry wings are 4.5 stars (they would be 5, but the sauce they use is pretty sweet. Yes I know, youd think, "dry" would mean sauceless?? Not here..surprise!) Anyhow, we had to wait 30 mins in this little crowded hole in the wall to be seated..*the service was pretty bad (but we understand they were slammed!)* We sit and wait another 30 mins to get our food=/ The rice came first and got cold by the time the rest got to our table, the shrimp and leek dumplings were ok..we hoped they would be bigger like pot stickers and have a bit more flavor (oh well, bring on the wings baby!) And of course, the wings blew us away (less sweet sauce next time??) Then the veggie chow mein came. Not very good. It was typical crappy Chinese food at this point. Then came the undercooked pork and willow fungus garlicky mess. Again, not a winner. We both agreed we would come back, but under the conditions that it was for WINGS ONLY! P.S. You tend to get a ton of rude stares by hungry folks wanting to steal your table..my advice? Get another plate of wings=D

I groaned when my friend dragged me out to the Inner Sunset to have what she claims is "the best fried chicken in San Francisco". ? It's... all the way out there. ?Little did I know, that of the group, which included two really big guys who usually have far bigger appetites than I, I'd end up eating the most. ?Licking every bone clean. For four, we ordered hot and sour soup, dry black bean sauce noodles, pork with dry bean curd, and of course, two orders of their dry fried chicken. ?Being a down home Chinese restaurant, there's no specific order in which the food comes out and their famous dry fried chicken happened to come first, which I didn't mind at all. ?In fact, I'm glad it came first because it allowed me to make a decision early in the meal to not waste the valuable real estate in my stomach on any of the other dishes. Because that dry fried chicken is EVERY BIT AS GOOD AS EVERYONE SAYS IT IS. The sauce was thick, sticky, sweet, and tangy. ?Even though the chicken was drenched in it, the exterior of it still had a major crunch, which housed perfectly moist and seasoned meat. ?By the way, these aren't ginormous chicken wings and drumsticks; it's a lot of little ones. ?I say that because I'm not the biggest fried chicken fan to begin with and I'm pretty lazy when it comes to food with bones, so for me to plow through a plate of mini fried chicken wings and drumsticks is a testament to how good it is. When my friend started to offer the last drumstick around, the other two threw in the towel/napkin while I said, "Dude, it's mine". ?When I finished, I proudly showed off my heaping plate of bones, "Check it. ?Count it", to which they remarked, "Damn, we didn't realize that this was a contest". ?Sore losers. :D

I can't say that I really had the experience, but my friend Kathy and I wanted to try it before heading out from San Francisco. She told me they are known for their Dried Fried Chicken and they are to die for. We went during dinner time and unfortunately, this place is super crowded. Little tight spacing for even to-gos. It didn't take too long for us to order two of the Dried Fried Chicken orders. Place is pretty efficient, but next time I'll try eating in for once and see if I could get the full experience. But as for the chicken to die for, I concur it was bomb. Expectations of the spicy and sweet sauce on it was delicious! I'll probably change my rating after I have really eaten in the restaurant.

I don't understand all the people who give this place 5 stars based on a single dish. ?Get real. I ordered the famous Dry Fried Chicken Wings... and they were pretty good. ?A bit too much sweet for my taste, but that's a small nit-pick. ?A 4-star item I'd say. That aside, we ordered some hot-and-sour soup, which was pretty solid, and some steamed pork dumplings, which were pretty flavorless. ?3-stars for the remaining dishes. The service was pretty contemptible. ?They hardly made eye contact with us and made us feel like we were just taking up space. ?Not to mention that this place is always packed but you can't call ahead to get on the list. ?2-star service.

Tip one: When in the Sunset- bring a jacket, preferably one that is filled with down as it is colder than the arctic circle here. Tip two: Eat at San Tungs. You may just pass San Tung by- thinking it is another hole in the wall Chinese food place- however, listen to your friends who live here and pay attention to the groups of people gathered outside the door- waiting and waiting to get their hands on some dry fried chicken (wet) and fried pot stickers. There is a reason that this place has a solid 4 stars on Yelp by almost 3k people- its good. ?Everything on the menu is delicious, well prepared and fairly priced. Prawns in Lobster sauce (eat over rice) Garlic Chicken (mmmm, garlic) Dry Fried Chicken (better than Hooters) Fried Pot Stickers (Thick layer that is best drowned in black vinegar) And as our dinner companion- Stella said "Remember, there is a pepper for every occasion"

This place is great although now a little overcrowded. I used to come to this joint since I was a kid growing up in the Sunset and went to the little hole in the wall they had on Irving and 20th. They home make their noodles and the dry fried chicken wings are the best. Typical 2 person order for me is 2 orders of wings, 1 to eat, 1 to go, beef noodle soup, dan dan mein and 1 order of pork dumplings with leek. This gives me enough to eat and enough for leftovers the next day since I no longer live in the city. Get there, get your name on the wall and chow down. * Quick tip: If you just want to try the wings go next door where one of the brothers will make it up for you without having to wait.

You know the left column of your Yelp profile that asks, "What would your last meal on earth be?" Well, I considered changing my current answer to "A meal at San Tung." Ah, San Tung. This place was incredibly hyped up, but you know what? The food met the hype! First off, I've always gone near 9PM (9:30PM is when they close) and there is practically no wait at all (which makes sense). Of my two trips here, I've had: - Chicken Wings (MUST) - Fried Rice (MUST... flavorful and infused with crack or something that must be equally addicting) - Dumplings (YES) - Green Beans (Nice way to balance out your meal) - Garlic Eggplant ? - Hot and Sour Soup (Perfect taste... not too watery, not too salty) I'll go again and again, and would go every weekend if I could!

Hands Down! Best Asian Chicken Wings Ever! Note: This review is based solely on the chicken wings as I have not had anything else here. We were driving past this place on a Saturday morning around 11. My friend who had been to San Tung before asked if we wanted to try it. No one really seemed to care/couldn't decide so I just decided to say "no" as it would be kind of a hassle to turn around and go back at this point. Then my friend told me to check it out on Yelp because the chicken wings are suppose to be really good. After looking at a picture of their popular wings, my mouth began to salivate and I knew I had made a grave mistake by denying us of these succulent pleasures. "TURN THIS CAR AROUND, WE HAVE TO GO BACK" And so we did. :) BEST DECISION EVER! Since this wasn't a planned stop, we decided to just be quick and order what we came in for -- some finger-licking good chicken wings. We got one plate of the original dry wings and one plate of the wet wings. They were both good, but the original dry ones were definitely better. They were smothered with less sauce which I think allowed the skin to be much crispier. Not sure what the sauce is made of, probably something along the lines of soy, ginger, garlic, mixed with crack. SO BOMB. This place gets packed around meal times. I think we got there just in time to beat the lunch rush, which was right around the time they opened. I can't wait for the day I come back and indulge once more in these foodgasm-inducing wings.

Good food, good place. However, the chicken was not as amazing as I had hoped... everyone kept telling me (Yelp included) how mind-blowing-ly amazing it was going to be. I mean, it's good and all, but not the best of my life. Maybe in the top 10. And yes... I am a bit jaded when it comes to fried chicken (I actually like Korean fried chicken the best). The other food (ex. my staple, Dry Beef Chow Fun) was good and worthwhile. It's a good Chinese restaurant at a good price. It has a good vibe too--makes you feel right at home. I'd definitely come back if I was in the area. And I'd probably get the chicken again. I would just know what to expect.

Dried fried chicken lives up to its hype. Best chicken I ever had...so crispy on the outside and juicy inside. My only complaint is the long wait. If you live by here... Definitely do take out otherwise its worth the wait. Also, the place next door offers the same fried chicken (I heard it is owned by the same person), but it's not the same. It was a little overlooked when I had it there. Definitely sticking to the original...

This place is one of the things that convinced me to move across the country to San Francisco. ?I have *never* had such amazing wings, and I come from the South!

Came here to try their wings at 3pm on a Saturday hoping to escape the crowds, but still faced a 40min wait. Screw that, we got it to go, and instead had a picnic on the hood of the car! My assessment of the order: Dry chicken wings- THE default item to get. Crispy, spicy and awesomely fresh. 9.99 for about 12 big wings Wet chicken wings- something to try: slathered in a sweet and sour cause and tossed with mushrooms and shoots. If you had to choose, go for the dry over the wet. Black seafood noodles- overrated. Spaghetti noodles with some seafood sauce with small shrimp and calamari.

Finally made it here on a Sunday night. Now I understand all the raves about San Tung fried chicken. I love every dish we ordered: Dry chicken wings, Wet diced chicken, dumplings, fried dumplings (different from pot stickers. I think we ordered this by mistake and it turns out to be good). String beans are always good here. You need some veggies after ordering so many meat dishes. Pork strips with dried beancurd is also a good non-spicy dish to complement the meal.

Basically, only come here for the Original Dry-Fried Chicken Wings. ?Those are absolutely amazing. ?(My gf calls them crack wings given their addictive properties). ?Everything else besides the wings and maybe the black bean sauce noodles are mediocre at best. ?Things tend to be overseasoned. "Crack wings": 5 stars Black bean noodles: 4 stars Everything else: 1.5 stars But given the fact that we almost always only order the wings and the noodles, I'll average it out to 4 stars.

I only got their wings and the black bean noodle. I have no idea what the hype is all about. ?I heard this place is owned be Koreans and not Chinese people (I don't really care, just wanted to point it out)? ?So they make their own version of Korean Wings. ? It's okay? ?It's a bit overpriced but I don't see what all the hype is about. ?It's not like it's not good, but most wings are pretty good in general, but this place doesn't serve anything amazing. ?From what I heard the other food is just average and i would believe it based on the black bean noodle I got. ?The wings are worth it every now and then. The place is always pretty busy so prepare for a wait, and better yet, order to go and skip the wait!

Original dry fried chicken wings = SO GOOD. I came here a while back on a Thursday evening, had to wait somewhere between 30 minutes to an hour for a table for 3 people. So when we were driving past on a Saturday morning around 11 and there was no line outside... we ended up stopping by even though we had no plans to originally. Definitely glad we did though! We tried both the original dry fried chicken wings (dry) and the dry fried chicken wings (wet). The original dry wings are the more popular ones, we got our food just a few minutes after ordering. I guess they just make chicken wings all day long since everybody orders them anyway :) I did notice that the table next to us ordered boneless dry wings and they took a lot longer to come out. The dry wings have a little bit of sauce on them, but they were a lot crispier than the wet wings. They tasted similar, the only thing that was really different was the amount of sauce and a few extra veggies in the sauce. Both were good but I would choose the dry wings! I've also tried the dry fried green beans... meh. Pretty overrated, in my opinion. They weren't super flavorful and not as dry/wrinkly as the green beans at other places. Fatima in Cupertino has my favorite green beans for sure! Anyway, I guess the secret to not having to wait in line is to come around when they open! Around 30 minutes after they had opened, there started to be a line.

I must say this was just an A-OK experience. My boyfriend, sister, and I came on a Friday night and waited about 40 minutes to be seated. We of course ordered the chicken wings (dry) as well as a few other dishes, including the black bean sauce noodles and a slimy tofu dish. The wings were very good (reminded me of Bon Chon which doesn't exist on the west coast). A negative was the sauce was kind of clumpy. The slimy tofu dish looked unappetizing although it was pretty good. The black bean sauce noodle dish (which I only ordered cause people raved about it) looked like clumpy sauce with noodles. It also was bland and kept reminding me that I was eating slimy poo (sorry!). I packed it to go to see if I would have an appetite for it later, and I ate a few bites for dinner last night, and almost threw up (sorry!). It just doesn't bring good thoughts to mind and tastes somewhat fishy and bland. Overall, just an OK experience. Would probably not come back (since you can skip the wait and get their wings next door).

Weird hour dining avoids lines again, 2 PM is the way to go. And thank goodness because the food would not have tasted as good had I had to wait. "Kimchi" - Revolting Black Bean Noodles - Korean style - Bland and mostly sauce Dry Fried Chicken Wings - Good, not Bon Chon level though Grean Beans - Solid Shrimp & Leek Dumplings - Go to Ranch 99 and buy some frozen dumplings and boil, save a few $ For the exact same thing (Chinese/Korean mishmash) done better, go to SO instead.

I have been here numerous time and as most people talk about the wait it can be pretty hectic. ?But whenever I go it usually right after work to avoid the dinner rush. ?I've had to wait about an 45 mins to and hour before but well worth the wait. ? The dry fried chicken wings are so friggin good! ?I love chicken wings too and I wish I knew how to make this myself. ? I would have given San Tung 5 stars, the food definitely deserves it. ?But they were closed for about 2 weeks for renovation but when I went in after the renovation everything was the same. ?I think they just went on vacation.

Best chicken wings ever - hands down. Got the dried wings with my wife and she devoured them even though she hates chicken wings. Their wings could turn a vegetarian into a carnivore. The sauce is so good you want to at the bone. The seaweed soup is awesome and makes you feel like a million bucks. Prices and portions are good. The place gets busy so the wait sucks. But, best thing comes to those who wait in this case.

I'd by pass all the other dishes and purely come here to eat the chicken. Can be a tad on the sweet side for some (and especially after you've gone through 5 drumsticks and 5 chicken wings) but nevertheless good! Be prepared for the wait at least once in your life and go see what all the chicken fuss is about.

My cousin & her family were visiting from China and wanted to grab good Chinese food at the last minute - of course I thought of San Tung, and since they didn't mind skipping the crazy wait at the main restaurant and ordering off the same menu next door, we came here and got a table after a 5 minute wait! Major props to the staff here who were patient through my cousin's indecisiveness and basically choosing the dishes (and asking everyone's opinion at the table AS she was ordering with the server waiting), her two kids who were pretty pumped up and energetic, running around, being noisy, etc, and helping us pack up this crazy amount of food. I made sure they got a good tip! * Beef tripe ($6.00) - 3 stars http://www.yelp.com/biz_… I think I'm not very into this dish normally, hence the average rating. It was fine, had a mild spicy flavor, but nothing I would write home about. * Pork dumplings ($6.75) - 4 stars http://www.yelp.com/biz_… Cross-section: http://www.yelp.com/biz_… As before, the skin is thick and soft, fresh. The ground pork inside juicy and still fairly loose. Tastes pretty good with some soy sauce and vinegar. * Seafood soup noodles ($9.00) - 3 stars http://www.yelp.com/biz_… Average - the noodles were on the harder side, which I actually like, and works well with soup. The soup itself is much more veggies however, and just a few pieces of shrimp & squid. * Dry fried chicken wings ($9.50) - 5 stars http://www.yelp.com/biz_… Yum - of course, their signature dish, fantastic as always! * Veggie fried rice w/ egg ($6.25) - 4 stars http://www.yelp.com/biz_… Although this was a pretty simple dish and I actually didn't feel much like eating it, I found myself drawn to it increasingly because it smelled so amazing. I can't really put my finger on what it was, but the rice was soft and it was well flavored as a dish. The eggs were cooked nice & soft too. * Twice cooked pork ($9.00) - 2 stars http://www.yelp.com/biz_… Not impressed. What little pork there was under all veggies that were essentially taking up space (mostly cabbage, a little bit of peppers) were really hard and not tasty. * Black mushroom/bok choy ($8.00) - 3.5 stars http://www.yelp.com/biz_… A solid veggie dish. They maybe over-starched the sauce as it was crazy thick, and the mushrooms had a really strong flavor so they should have cut them into smaller pieces than halves. * Hot braised bean curd ($8.00) - 3.5 stars http://www.yelp.com/biz_… The bean curd pieces were nicely done, soft and with a good skin to chew through. The veggies once again could be cut into smaller pieces, and they could have had better choices (not a big fan of the cucumber, carrot, baby corn combo. They always seem like cheap fillers to me).

Chicken. Chicken. Chicken. Chicken? Chicken! Chicken... .... ...Chicken Yes, the chicken here is very very good. I ate the Korean style wings they had here shortly after coming back from eating some of the most amazing chicken wings in Seoul, and these come very close (sorry, but you can't beat the original and authentic). Nonetheless, the chicken wings had the perfect mix of sweet, crispy, sticky and spicy. I will definitely be coming here again for them. I also ordered some hoisin noodles, and I wasn't too big of a fan of those.. I guess the chicken just overshadowed the rest of the food.

You really do have to go here just for the chicken wings! I've been here multiple times, and never get tired of those wings. ?Other than that though, San Tung is a great place to get your chinese fix. ?Whatever you may want, they have it. ?Everything else may be not as great as the chicken wings, but they do get the job done. Service is fast and for a meal for 2, after you get seated, you could probably get out of there within 30 minutes. ?The wait can vary depending on the time you go there. ?Dinnertime around 6-8 is probably the busiest, and there will be a line out the door, but if you get here by 5:30 or 8:30, it shouldn't be as big of a problem. Tip: some of the things could be a tad bland, so I'd suggest usually ordering spicy unless you really can't handle it.

Came here because the yelp review is super high... As expected, the entire restaurant is very crowded and they did not accept reservation that is under party of 6. So me and my friends ended up waiting for 2 hours roughly. We ordered - seafood soup - noodle with peanut sauce - fried pot sticker: we like the pot sticker. The skin is thick but very tasty. - and the signature fried chicken with honey sauce In general, I will say this place is pretty decent for authentic Chinese food. However, I only gave it a 3 because it was under what I expected and I don't think the wait should be this long for this kind of food!

Parking may be difficult as they don't have a private parking lot and spots for street parking can be competitive with the street littered with restaurants. You write your name and the number of your party on the white board next to the entrance, and they will call your name when a table is ready. The wait can be quite long. However, it is very much worth the hassle of parking and the long wait for a table. NOTE: this is not an authentic Chinese restaurant. It's a combination of American and Korean style Chinese food with complimentary Chinese style kimchi. We came as a large group and was able to try quite a few dishes. The dumplings are hand-made and quite juicy. The fried chicken is super crispy and drenched in a sweet, slightly spicy sauce, which may be difficult to remove if you decide to toss the chopsticks and eat with your fingers. The black bean noodles are quite good with the sauce not too sweet or salty and the noodles are hand-made. The spicy seafood noodles are okay and have an ample serving of seafood with hand-made noodles. The chow mien comes with a generous portion of meat. The only dish that could be improved was the sweet and spicy shrimp. It was a bit too sweet and the sweetness drowned out the other flavors.

Been a while since I went to San Tung! They have the best chicken wings! ?SOOOO GOOD!! Was a bit surprised to see a table full of black people at a Chinese restaurant. But you know what they say about black people and their chicken! =P It's no joke! San Tung's chicken wings was too legit too quit! The line, on the other hand, was not fun. We waited about 45 minutes to eat here but after one bite of those crispy tangy wings everything seemed OK. We also ordered the jajangmien and the fried beef this time. The jajangmien is lacking! Scallops are now potatoes. Boo!! Sauce was too watery too! :( Beef tenders were delicious although I would have preferred them more peppery/ spicy. Don't care. Will come back for chicken wings.

Maybe its because i've had good chinese food in Socal and my fair share of fried chicken. But san tung is very mediocre for what it is. The chicken- good, but not great.

Came for dinner on a Thursday night during busy hours and was surprised that there were very few people waiting. A lot of people get take out and I would probably recommend it if you can take the food to go. Even though we were seated within 15-20 mins, it took about half an hour to get our food after we were seated, so in total almost 45 minutes from when we entered the restaurant and started eating. The kitchen is constantly churning out dishes and there are a ton of servers around but there's just a lot of orders they have to fill, plus the take out orders, so getting your food takes awhile. We had the dry friend chicken wings, pork pot stickers, string beans, some rice, and the free chinese kimchee they serve. Chicken wings definitely lived up to their hype! Honestly don't think chicken wings can get much better. Pot stickers have deepfried skin and they're very big, not as good as traditional pot stickers imo. And the string beans were great, and the portion was big. The kimchee is pretty spicy too as a warning! Overall, spent about $30 for two and we had some food to go. Great food, just a bit of a wait! Oh and FYI they don't do reservations for tables less than 6.

NOTICE: San Tung will be closed for remodel between 9/12-9/26 so beware of that! I came here over the weekend since my sister was craving chicken wings. I wasn't planning on ordering anything though because it seemed most of the more popular dishes were meaty, but I decided to peruse the menu anyway. We planned to get take-out and good thing we didn't try to get a table since it was PACKED and every table was full. There was a pretty long waiting list and people were crowding outside too. Dang, definitely a sign that this place is good. What I ordered: - Vegetarian Steamed Potstickers ($7): comes with 6 potstickers filled with napa cabbage, zucchini, mushrooms, garlic http://www.yelp.com/biz_… You have to go to the back of the restaurant where the counter/register is to order food to-go and originally, the waiter told us our food would be ready in 30 minutes, but then changed his mind after seeing my jaw drop and said to come back in 15-20 instead. They have small containers of hot sauce, hot sauce oil, and soy sauce for you to grab when you get your order which is nice! The potstickers were pretty big and came in a plastic container on a bed of cabbage. They were really yummy and the skin was very soft, so my chopsticks kept poking through it, causing some of the filling to fall out -__- I took some hot sauce to try and poured some on, but I found it to be a little too strong and spicy, so it kind of overpowered the taste of the veggies in the potstickers. Therefore, I ate the rest of them just plain but they were good that way! Pretty filling meal and I could only eat 5 out of the 6, but that might have been due to getting boba right beforehand. Not sure if they use MSG though since my sister said she was super thirsty after eating her food. I was alright though, but maybe my body just isn't as sensitive?

I would not recommend coming here with a large party... I had reservations for 11 ppl. ?We were seated with only two menu's on the table. We all shared the menu as we waited patiently to order. After 35 minutes of waiting, I got up and asked for water and to order our food. ?Each time, I had to get up and ask for extra napkins, forks, an extra bowl, water, soda..it was the one of the worst dining experiences I have had. Lastly, our dishes came out one by one, within a 10-15 minute time frame. We got our main dishes first, and then again, I had to get up and ask for the rice. Thank goodness the food was great, otherwise, I would have been really bummed! Overall, the food was flavorful and great. ?My top choices would be the fried chicken and lemon chicken. ?However, the complete disregard for my table, the terrible service was just too much to bare. When we finally got the check, ?I was surprised that a 15% gratuity was automatically included. I went to the owner and told her that I had no problem paying for our food, but I would absolutely not pay tip for such terrible service. All she said was "okay". Next time, if there will be a next time for me, I will order to go as oppose to sit down dinner.

Believe the hype, the chicken is so good. Also the dumplings are a big hit. Well worth the wait on busy nights. I suggest coming in around 3:30 -- you'll get seated right away versus coming in at 6:30 for dinner -- which could take up to an hour of wait --eek! But they do a pretty good job of cleaning the tables pretty fast to seat the next person. Makes me wonder tho, why not extend their restaurant? Oh yeah, and i usually dont like chow mein, but i'll eat theirs anyday!

When I come here, I don't even look at the menu anymore...I just order their original dry fried chicken and peanut noodles, which comes out to roughly $20. The black bean sauce noodles are delicious too. One time, I decided to be daringgg and order one extra dish lol. The scallops! They turned out to be okay. But if you compare anything to the chicken and peanut noodles, everything's just okay... Anyway, just stick with the best - dry fried chicken and peanut noodles - and never be disappointed!

No wonder why they're known for their world famous dried fried chicken wings. If you step inside the restaurant, every table, big or small, has at least a plate of those delicious wings. My boyfriend was on a trip visiting San Francisco a couple of weeks ago, and our local friends told us that it was a must to get their chicken wings. So we were able to make it at 9:25PM, just right before it closes, and got our name onto the waiting list. And boy were we so glad we had made it time! We also had their chow mien noodles and asparagus soup, which went great with our wings' side dish. Highly recommend this place, and cannot wait to return here on my next visit!

The place was super busy, but the turnover was pretty good. But it doesn't matter, because like most others, we went there for the dry-fried chicken wings. And they were as fantastic as everyone has said. I'm sold. Everything else we ordered was just okay - the string beans were nothing to write home about, and the combination chow mein didn't really have much of a combination going on. A few pieces of shrimp, beef and maybe chicken scattered about. Overall, 5 stars for the chicken wings, which count triply. 3 stars for everything else.

I should have ordered the wings, but the kung pao chicken was calling my name. I should have ignored the call. The staff looked like they were Chinese but a German must have slipped into the kitchen judging from my meal. How else could one explain a sauce that looked & tasted more like a gravy you would see on an entree in a German restaurant. I am still looking for good kung pao chicken in a town full of Chinese restaurants.

I was a bit leery about trying this place and like others have said, I was also wondering how authentic and "truly Chinese" this place was. ?I've gone a few times now and I noticed there's always a lot of ABC's, Filipinos, and other non-Asians there. ?Not sure if that's a good sign or not. ?I never see very many FOB's there. ?But Filipinos know their Chinese food, right??? ?Also, whenever a place gives out fortune cookies at the end of your meal, that's also not a very good sign! ?This is also one of the very few Chinese places that actually still use the old paper take-out boxes, instead of the usual styrofoam boxes. ? But for the most part, the food is pretty legit there. ?I tried the infamous chicken wings that everybody orders, and they're pretty good. ?I don't know if they're to die for, but they're good. ?But this dish definitely reminds me of something that non-Chinese like to order at a Chinese restaurant. ?Kind of like eating orange chicken or kung pao chicken or sweet and sour chicken or General Chow's chicken or slippery shrimp at a Chinese restaurant. ?The string beans were pretty good too. ?We also got some potstickers and for $7, they were the biggest potstickers I've ever seen. ?The steamed pork dumplings were nothing special though. ?I haven't really tried too many other dishes, but will be back. ? And of course, since it's Frisco, parking is horrible!!

After seeing 3000+ reviews, my friends and I were ready to try the best chicken wings in town. The wait was about 1.5hours on a thursday night. ?We looked around to see what people mostly ordered and we copied them :) Wet chicken wings - the sauce is on the sweet side. The combination may have been hoisin sauce, white pepper, black pepper, honey, plum sauce? Dry chicken wings - these were my favorite! They were very nicely fried. A bite on the chicken was crispy and oily-salty when you eat the edge of the skin. But this one is even sweeter than the wet wings. Maybe it's the sugar that gives it such a delicious oily crunch. The sauce is thicker too...molasses? Stir-fried string beans - I think adding pickled vegetable gives a nice salty crunch to the vegetables, but the dish didn't taste great here. It was sweet! It was also in the fryer too long, which made it greasy and somewhat wilty. Wet black bean sauce w/ homemade noodles - I think the dish tastes better than QQ Noodles' because it wasn't too salty. I guess the sugar helped. :) But I wish there was less sauce. Pork/napa cabbage dumplings - ok; the skin was too soft (maybe overcooked?) Sizzing rice soup - This was one of my favorite - on par with the chicken wings. I had never tried this before. The broth was light, and I liked the peas and mushrooms in it. The sizzling rice adds a nice light crunch to the soup. Next time I want to try fried fish!

I've changed so many lives by taking friends here. Out of town friends hate me because they can't get it every day. Tips: Have your order READY- this is not a time wasting restaurant. Order the dry fry chicken. Flag down your waiter if you need something- they won't check on you. That being said, prepare to wait a long time if you come during lunch/dinner time, especially on weekends. Or just weekends in general.

I don't get the hype of this place. The chicken wings that everyone craved for were just...I don't know, feels like the General Tsao of chicken wings to me (i.e. American-ized). It was very sweet, only a bit spicy, and nothing else. The meat wasn't flavorful and the mediocre sauce did not help. I think we also got some appetizers and maybe a noodle dish, and I could remember was: mediocre Chinese food. It's not American-Chinese per se, but I don't feel like it's authentic either. Well, maybe I'm not from San Tung, but I've been to San Tung, and I did remember liking the food there. So there you have it. Overhyped, over-yelped semi-Chinese food, is what I call this place. If you want real homey Chinese food with a hometown feel, go to Don Bei Mama. Now that place knocked my socks off!

Like every other review says, you can't go wrong with San Tung dry fried chicken wings. ?They are freakin delicious and I love chicken wings. ?The wait here is always long though, so we usually just place our order over the phone and pick it up to eat at home. ?Parking around here sucks too, especially during dinner time.

WHAT TO ORDER: - Dry fried Chicken Wings: crispy skin with tender juicy meat, covered in a sweet and sticky sauce. (Save for rice!!) - Dry fried Fish fillet: cooked like the chicken wings, but replace with deep friend fish fillets. Pleasantly surprised by the size of the order. Plus! - Sauteed String Beans - Pork Dumplings - Dry Black Bean Sauce Noodles - Three Deluxe Spicy Sauce Noodles **If there is a HUGE line, walk next door to NEXT DOOR SWEETS. Contrary to their sign which advertises only a couple of San Tung's dishes, they do serve the ENTIRE MENU. However, you just don't have that restaurant atmosphere... CONS: -parking is a bitch -kinda pricey -usually a long waiting list

Went next door to "Next Door Sweets" where there was no wait. Full menu offered, don't be skeptical. They started doing this a couple months ago. San Tung owner's son owns Next Door Sweets, so the recipes are the exact same. You might not get the San Tung chinese restaurant ambiance, but you do get closer access to PMT and gelato. It smells uber sweet inside, I felt like I was going to get a cavity from sniffing the air. Worth skipping the wait at San Tung though! Black bean sauce noodles were alright. Seems like more people enjoy the dry black bean noodles, but we weren't feeling dry that night. Hot and sour soup was good. Not your typical hot and sour soup flavor, so it's flavorful in its own way. Not super spicy or sour. Could use a different type of mushroom though. Dried sauteed string beans are always a favorite. It was cooked well here, so try it! Last but not least, dried fried chicken. Yes it was gooooood, nice and crispy. Would definitely come back if I am in the area.

Always crowded, and of course, the wings are what to come for as copiously detailed. ?Most of the other fare here is OK to good - we are still exploring the menu but haven't found anything quite close to those wings. But, wings along generally pull us in and rope in family and friends as well.

As other reviewers have said, the Chicken Wings are the BEST. Now that Mayflower is closed, came for dim sum which was pretty good except for the panfried potstickers which were deep fried. Yuck.

I remember my very first visit here it took about 30 mins to get a table,but afterwards I fell in love with their CHICKEN WINGS!!!!! I'd recommend a party of 2-4 people for easier seating, but it generally depends on a first come first serve basis so be patient if you come with a bigger party of 6 or more for table availability. The wings here is by far the best I've had in San Francisco. It is fried to perfection and still tastes moist when you bite into it (be careful cause it's really hot!) and then evenly coated in a sweet and savory sauce!!! I've been back to this place many times and I always order the wings, it's super delicious and even addicting. I also like their steamed pork dumplings and the black bean sauce noodles!! The dumplings are comparable to mom's homemade dumplings. I've tried their peanut sauce noodles, seafood noodle soup, and black bean sauce noodle. As the name implies the peanut sauce has a prominent peanut taste and a bit sweet. The seafood noodle soup is too bland, so I like the black bean sauce most because it's savory and less sweet tasting. Overall, the food here is good and service is good so the four stars is well deserved!! :-)

I drove all the way for 2.5 hrs to end up with a nice dinner at San Tung. I had no idea what I was getting myself into. My friends told me there were two types of Chicken Wings, wet and dry. I can tell you that I think the dry is probably slightly better. The meat was a decent amount, but basically anyone eating this is just for the sauce. We also had string beans, basicaly the same sauce. They basically make everything with slight variation of this sauce. The sauce differences seems to be how much sugar they add, but I'm not 100% sure. For four people, we ordered 3 plates, and we had about 4-5 pieces left over with 3 hungry dudes. We also tried the potsticker. I would probably pass on that. So if you want chicken, come. If you want anything else, I have no idea because I never tried it :) Btw, the hours on Friday are terrible (close at 9:30 sharp), They told people to leave who just showed up 2 minutes late. ouch. Guess when you own ?the best chicken in town, you can do whatever you want.

Alright, let's get the obvious out of the way - the chicken is good. Crazy good. Worth the wait good. Stood outside in the cold SF summer just for this. However, I do have to say that though the quality of the chicken is great, the sauce is not as unique as one may think. The rest of the dishes were good. String beans are delicious and recommended. The dumplings are nice - but not up to par. Surprisingly, the hot and sour soup was really really good, and this is coming from someone who isn't normally partial to it. Definitely worth it if you have been waiting in the dead cold of summer. 2 orders of dried fried chicken. string beans. dumplings. hot and sour soup. rice = $50 between 3 people. Street parking, both free and metered.

Dry-fried chicken wings. They are as good as everyone says they are. 1. #3 on SF's 7x7 Big Eat 2012 - http://www.7x7.com/eat-d… 2. On my list to take visitors not from SF 3. On my list for best SF foods 4. My friends from far away crave the dry fried chicken wings and want to come to SF JUST for it 5. ALWAYS packed, no matter what day of the week 6. CHINESE people eating at a CHINESE restaurant So technically, this place should get 6 stars. Granted, there will be a long wait, like at least an hour, so subtract a star for that. But it's worth it. Wow, an hour wait for food and it's still worth it? I wish I was that special =P

Came for the black bean sauce noodles (No. 7), stayed for the chicken wings. ?The wings were pretty amazing - sweet, savory, spicy, crunchy, and succulent. The noodles were nothing special, really. ?A bowl was enough to share between two people, but the flavor was unremarkable and the house-made noodles felt like regular yee mein noodles used everywhere (except longer).

Sad to say that this place was a complete disappointment from the moment I arrived to the moment I left. I wanted to take my parents out to eat somewhere that they actually like for once since everytime we go out to eat, we always end up eating something I want to eat so we decided to go for Chinese food. I call before I arrived to make sure that it wasn't too busy. The waiter that picked up the phone had poor english but I'm not grading them on that because well, it's a Chinese restaurant so it's expected. He said it wasn't too busy so we headed over. When we got there, there were no tables available. We told the waiter that we called earlier and all he kept saying was "I TOLD YOU, I TOLD YOU I DONT KNOW WHEN IT WILL BE BUSY." Uhh...WTF? I never said you didn't. So we put our name down and waited about 10 minutes before we finally got our seats. We arrived like 15 minutes before the specials were over and asked if we can still order from it. The first waiter said, "okay let me ask my boss." A few seconds later(literally) his boss came and asked to take our order. Uhh how about give us a minute to actually look at the menu? It was like they wanted to rush us out ASAP even though there were no other customers waiting. 2 minutes later, he came back and asked if we were ready to order in a rude and annoyed way. 30 seconds later, they asked us to move to another table and at this point, I was pretty fed up. No food in the world could make up for the attitude and service that this place has given us. We ordered as quick as possible and ate as quick as possible because we just didn't want to deal with crap service. Ordered the dried chicken wings and to be honest, they weren't even all that great. I've definitely had better wings at Lee Hou Restaurant on Clement when they were still open. Mediocre Chinese food + absolutely the worst service I've ever had = 0 stars. Apparently I can only give 1 star at the very minimum and that's exactly what they're getting. Definitely WOULD NOT be back. Cash/Credit Card Accepted.

the chicken wings were ok. i thought maybe if it was spicy, it would've been better. ?i definitely wouldn't wait for that. ? the black bean noodle was nothing special. and the shrimp and leek dumplings were also nothing special. i actually did like their cabbage kimchi. i think they forgot about our order. first the sizzling rice soup (which btw, did not sizzle because it wasn't pipping hot. it was warm, at best) came after 20 minutes of ordering. ?then the dumplings shortly after. we finished the dumplings, and i felt like it took another 20 minutes to flag the waiter down to ask about the rest of our dishes. ? finally the noodles and chicken came. ?I think they forgot about our order, because others who came in after us, got their dishes before us. one of the workers seemed reluctant to give me ?bowls to split the noodles in. ?He thought i could use those small chinese rice bowls.??! Anyway, i was very underwhelmed by this place. ?maybe because Korean Chinese restaurants are a dime a dozen in LA.

A packed restaurant/ No seats to wait around so you just kind of have to stand there until they call your name. The must try here are definitely THE WINGS. the consistency of them are amazing! ? I didnt really try anything else here except for the black bean noodles which the server recommended and I didnt really like it because it was sort of bland and the noodles were a bit hard. but other than that.. THE WINGS.

Beyond the Great Plains and over the Rocky Mountains there exists a place so mythical and cloaked in overflowing lines that only few have made it there and braved the wait. However, those elite who persevered can speak to the glory and grandeur of Chicken Mountain. Once you start with one order of dry fried chicken wings at San Tung you can't stop there - you have to keep going back for more. They are so tasty, flavorful, crispy on the outside, moist on the inside and served with a sticky, thick, sweet sauce and Szechuan chilies that have just the right dose of mouth-numbing heat. After you've conquered enough plates and built your pile of bones sky high, your waiter - who I'm sure has this down pat - may come over and proclaim "You build Chicken Mountain!!" At this point you will know you have attained enlightenment and a serene, content, numb feeling will wash over you (it might just be that you're full and overloaded on chilies, but I'm going with enlightenment). The chicken wings are definitely the stand-out dish at San Tung, but everything else I've tried is solid. The sizzling rice soup - it's my favorite and I'm so, so happy to see it all over San Francisco; I can't get it in New York - was great and served five and the potstickers, which are fried, are enormous - at least twice as big as most - and filled with juicy, porky goodness. The beef chow mein was par for the course, but we also rounded out our meal with a couple other dishes. The dried sauteed string beans were very good; packed with great garlic and ginger flavors, a decent dose of heat and soft enough to bite right through. The black bean sauce noodles has a different flavor profile from most of the other dishes on the menu, but still deserves most of the praise it gets. The dish, which is packed full of seafood, is made with fermented black beans and then heavily thickened, probably with cornstarch. To some this dulls the plate's flavors, and I would have liked a little heat in the dish to spice it up, but I see it as being very comforting in its own way. The chicken wings are food hall of fame, five-star quality, and the rest of the food is in between three and four stars, so I'm settling on four. The wait can be kind of ridiculous - my recent trip on a random Tuesday night left my friends and me stranded outside for well over an hour - but so long as you know what you're in for it's worth it. Prices are fair for the amount of food you get. My only complaint - and this doesn't affect my review - is why on earth are they closed on Wednesdays?! That's the day of the week I previously wanted to go! Sacrifices to gods of Chicken Mountain - the greatest kind or the best kind?

Pretty much the best Chinese food I have had. First good sign: It's 2pm on a Saturday and the place is PACKED with Chinese families eating. Second good sign: First dish comes out quick - it's dry-fried green beans and they are like crack. These people make vegetables taste like crack. That requires skill. And we seal the deal with the dry-fried chicken. We got it served "wet" and the cubes of chicken instead of wings. Just fantastic and addictive. So yeah, it was worth the wait in line (20 minutes or so), the tight space up front where all the waiting people sit, and the Chinese couple who tried to cut in front of us in line. Good thing the manager pointed to the white board (DON'T forget to write your name and number in your party there when you walk in!!!) and put them in their place.

San Tung never disappoints. I have been a die-hard fan for years, keeping their menu and phone number on my desk for quick access. After coming here for 7+ years I have never actually sat down and eaten in the restaurant. So my review does not incorporate that perspective... After moving back into the city after leaving for 5 years, I find San Tung to be very much the same, in a good way. Their portions are very generous, their staff are orderly and efficient, and I believe this establishment is a predominantly family-owned business (gotta love that). Their dried fried chicken diced is a must have if you go to San Tung. I find the portions to be bigger in dried friend chicken diced vs dried fried chicken wings. The wings are crisper however. There is also a choice of getting the order "wet". However I haven't ordered the wings in a while, but I remember I don't prefer them. Call your order in for takeout if you want quick service. They usually have your order for take out ready in 15-20 minutes. And if I'm not mistaken they deliver! There is always a wait for a table (thus why I've never sat down in the restaurant before) and the wait times have ranged from 20-45 minutes. Insider's tip: the father of the business decided to create a business right next door to San Tung. They offer ice cream and sweet treats AND they share a kitchen with San Tung! ?So if you want to order something off either menu, you can eat them at the adjacent "sweet" restaurant. I've never been, but it's on my to do list now that I'm back!

I first tried the famous dry fried wings a few years ago...and left with an unmemorable meal. I tried it again recently, this time just ordering the wings for take out... and oh my gosh it was amazing. I stand by giving things a second chance! How do the wings stay so crispy?? We took it home and ate it maybe 30-45 minutes later, and it was still hot, crispy, sweet, tangy & sooo delicious. A week later and back home in L.A..... I was craving it so badly I was determined to find a recipe online & make some for myself (Not an exact duplicate but quite successful if I may say so myself!) I have a new love and appreciation for these wings and can no longer envision a visit to the city without them. To-Go of course. Wait time looks horrible and messy. Service looks. sounds. worse. $10+change for an order of wings. Credit Cards accepted.

Finally got to try the infamous chicken wings! Make sure you order them dry style (but they're quite the opposite - moist, yummy and with this gooey spicy/sweet sauce). One order is enough to feed 2-3 people... Also, the cold noodles were really good too. Peanut flavored and making me drool thinking about them... Service is not too great and slow. Chicken wings took several minutes after we got our noodles... but it's ok - you're here for the food!

We did take out from this super super popular Chinese so it may have dampened the food a bit. Of course, we ordered the "dry" chicken wings. ?In fact, 5 orders of it! ?Not really "dry" since it does have a sweet & savory sauce over it. ?I'm sure the "dry" refers to the way it is cooked, which literally means "dry stir fry," and that loosely means, fried, then frying in the wok again. ?By the time we got it, the skin wasn't really that crispy anymore thanks to steam but it was still good. ?Next time, gotta go there and try the wings fresh! Ordered a few types of dumplings. ?Pork & Chive was definitely my favorite. ?The Pork & Cabbage had a nice subtly sweetness from the cabbage. We also got a huge order of the String beans, which is always a favorite dish of mine at Chinese restaurants. ?At San Tung, it has a noticeably sweeter flavor to it. ?There's also a good amount of preserved mustard tuber! Now, there were a few items that I felt was just meh, probably due to the fact that it was take out though. ?The combo fried rice was not that great since it was a bit cold. ?They packed the sauces for our black bean sauce noodle and sesame noodle separate so it wouldn't be a soggy. ?I didn't care much for the sesame noodles though. ?The black bean sauce, aka zhajiangmian, was a little different than the typical ones I've had. ?Not bad though. Glad I finally got to try San Tung, although after the meal, I have decided that I must check out the place for myself to really see if I liked the place or not. ?While it is convenient that we did take out to skip the long wait, the long drive back from one end of the city to the other probably cooled the food down so it's not as enjoyable!

YUM. The wings here are amazing, and nobody I have brought here has ever thought otherwise. As for the rest of the menu...meh. Don't even bother with the potstickers. The cherry pork was far too fatty, and this is coming from a pork belly lover. Unfortunately I have not tried their black bean noodles which I always see being shuffled over to every table in the room. Luckily, an order of the wings is enough to fill 2 people up. Do try their semi-sister restaurant, SO, which is apparently owned by the son of the owner of San Tung. The wings are equally good but addictive in a different way. At San Tung, you want to scoop up all of the deliciously sweet, honey sauce that accompanies the dry fried chicken. At SO, the added heat to the wings keeps you coming back for more.

Go with the original chicken...need I say more? Fine...the dry noodles with black bean sauce isn't too bad either. ? Just be sure to come ready to wait. ?We did the ole' ghetto route - order to go and eat wings in the car. ?Still a 20 minute wait, but at least it's faster. Went back to the car. ?We got a few honks since we weren't giving up our parking space. ?But don't try to interrupt me when I AM EATING!! Just DON'T DO IT!

Famous wings. MMMMM. At first our party of 5 wanted 3 plates of wings and 2 other plates, but our waiter kinda upsold us and told us to buy more food... weird. ?But I guess we were bigger looking dudes. ?Anyways, the wait is worth it if you've never tried it. ?The wings are the crispiest things ever and are covered in a ginger/soy/sweet/spicy sauce that is really gluey and sticky. ?Really good. ? The other food though is pretty subpar to any asian restaurant, so that's why it's a four instead of a five. ?Additionally, some of the staff can be a bit rude, but it's an asian restaurant so what can you expect.

San Tung has decent Chinese food, but their real star is the dry fried chicken wings. I promise it lives up to the hype; it really is that good. The first time I had it I thought I would only eat one or two because I was already stuffed from lunch (this was a mid-afternoon snack!), but I ended up eating four or five. The fact that every table has at least one plate of this (if not two!) speaks for itself, right? I've also sat down in the restaurant for lunch (I think the lines are always horrendously long, so either come prepared to wait or don't coming during peak hours), and my favorites were the dumplings and string beans. I haven't had a bad dish here. I don't know if it's my favorite Chinese restaurant (there are slight variations in Chinese food and I prefer Szechuan because I like my food spicy!) but it's classic, comforting food that brings back happy childhood memories. :)

Came in around 5pm and we were seated immediately. We started off with the shrimp and leek dumplings,12 bites of delicious goodness. The dumplings were steaming as I bit into it, and I knew it would have been better to wait for it to cool down a bit, but I just couldn't resist. I ended up with a burnt tongue. Black bean noodles is seriously so large you'll need two people to finish it. I shared it with my girlfriend and we could barely finish the noodles after the 12 dumplings. The fact we were eating dinner so early probably made me fill up faster. This meal was worth every penny we spent. Fast service and good food what more can you ask for. We were quite satisfied and out the door within 35 minutes.

Favorite dishes: #1: Dry noodles with black bean sauce and seafood. Elegantly prepared, not too overwhelming. Great seafood. Great vegetables. A very good dish. #2: The dumplings. Especially the shrimp & leek. They were very good. Almost rivaling Din Tai Fung. Almost I said, because there are no juicy pork dumplings :-). #3: The chicken wings. Dry original. So good! But the dry noodles were my favorite! So many good choices. The menu is a palace of good choices. Honorable mentions: #1 Pork with black mushrooms. This had good seasoning and the mushrooms were wonderful. However, the sauce was a little overthickened and the pork was a little overtenderized or something. #2: The kimchi at the beginning! served immediately. Man it's good! The spice is perfect somehow! #3: Green beans, I can't remember which style they were, but they were fantastically fresh and crispy and tasty. These would have been a top dish if they came near the beginning, middle, or end of the meal! The organization of the place is haphazard. I know people say to expect this when going to a Chinese restaurant. However, my experience is that things only arrive as they did here in dim sum places where you can never find the right cart. For example... we got the green beans after everything on the table was consumed and the rice even came late and that was gone with all the drippings/sauces from the previously eaten dishes. So in retrospect, it was a lot of fun. The food was great. The value is fantastic! It's very affordable and given it's class of preparation, I'd say it's an extraordinarily good value. The kids loved the food. The table was perfect. The service for water, tea, kimchi was FAST! The staff / servers were very nice.

Amazing Asian chicken wings and all around the Chinese food here is some of the best SF has to offer. That said, the wait can be incredibly long (1 hour or more) which makes you question whether it is actually worth it. If you can manage to get there when there is a saner waiting period, then you're in for a real treat.

While visiting one of my friends in San Francisco, who happens to be a San Franciscan native, her family took me to this place. She and my other friends kept HYPING about how amazingly delicious this place is. Apparently, they claim that the chicken wings here are TO DIE FOR! I'm a pescatarian (which means I only eat dairy and seafood products), and I don't regret being one. But, this is probably the one time where my limited diet actually prevents me from enjoying a restaurant's specialty. Nevertheless, I was able to enjoy other food on their menu (although I can't say for sure if it's as good as the chicken wings). FOOD, FOOD, FOOD +As I stated before, I didn't try their chicken wings. But, once the chicken wings arrived at our table, everyone fell silent and started indulging on this plate of deliciousness. My friends devoured those chicken wings like a zombie devouring their prey, and just like that...those wings were gone in a blink of an eye. Judging from that, I'd say those chicken wings are beyond OMFG tasty...they're ADDICTIVE! Hmmm...makes me wonder what their secret ingredient is. +I did try their Dry Noodles sautéed in Black Bean Sauce. The black bean sauce has this thick and sticky texture to it. But, once you get past that, the flavor was wonderfully delicious. I highly recommend that. +I also highly recommend the shrimp and leek dumplings. This deliciously plump and juicy ball of amazingness will make you ask for more. +Warning: I sense that the main theme here is that their food is HIGHLY ADDICTIVE. So, beware of potentially becoming a food addict here (especially their chicken wings) SERVICE I've only been here once (on a weekend during lunch). But, from my one time experience, it seems like this place is always SUPER CROWDED! We waited 15-20 minutes before we were seated. Their customer service isn't spectacular, but it's expected from an Asian restaurant (especially if it's really packed). Our waitress wasn't particularly attentive; it seemed like she only wanted to take our order and get the food out to us without conversing with us too much (and she didn't come back often to check on us either). I highly doubt any of their customers really come here for their customer service; they mostly come for the food. So, where they lack in customer service, their food will more than make up for it. PARKING Like most restaurants in San Francisco, this place is located on a busy street with limited parking. There are metered-parking spaces near the restaurant, but those are taken up really quickly. If you go a bit further down, there are non-metered parking spaces (but I believe those are "timed" parking spaces). Looking for a parking space around here is frustrating, but with a little bit of patience you'll eventually find one (it may not be your ideal space, but you'll find one).

The deep fried chicken was SPECTACULAR! I have never tasted anything like these wings and will probably never find any like them anywhere else in the world. They were so so very good. I want some wings just as I am thinking about them. Another dish that I really love was the hot and sour soup. I only tried the soup at those chinese buffets which I thought could never get better. I was wrong. The hot and sour soup here is my number one favorite at the moment. We had a few miscommunications with our waiters so don't expect the greatest service. In the end, food was fantastic and that's all that really matters to me.

The food: The reason there are crowds of hungry, disgruntled San Franciscans lining up outside is seriously because of the food. So far I've tried the many mentioned deep fried chicken wings (you can order it dry with separate sauce as well). Other highlights include the hot and sour soup, spinach and bean threads (which resemble glass noodles), mushu pork, and the potstickers. I've also seen a lot of people order heavily sauced noodle dishes (zha jiang mian?...lol can you tell I'm ABC). The good: The food really is superb. A chef friend explained that although "San Tung" is named after a region in China, there are korean influences on the food as well; hence the kimchi served as a small appetizer. The bad: I've noticed in my first couple of times that service was very noticeably slower for people who were not regulars. My sister and I sat and kind of stared sadly at the tables around us- seated after we were- get platters of food BEFORE we did. This is rather disgruntling, but with SF's small neighborhood feel I guess it's understandable. Ambiance: noisy Chinese restaurant What to know: become a regular to get better service. I wouldn't say the entire menu is spectacular, but you really have to know what to order. And of course, get here before you're hungry because there will usually be a wait. Good for: anybody and anyone In short: San Tung isn't spectacular on service, but the food is worth the wait and everything!

So I went to spend a weekend with some friends in SF. When I get there I am told we are going to have wings for dinner and that they are to die for. If you read anyone else's review, yeah you will see that too. So we show up at this literal itty bitty Chinese joint in the sunset about 8:30-8:45ish and its standing room only OUTSIDE! Well we finally get into this joint and we made the cutoff, yeah if you show up after about 9:15 you will be turned away. We watched it happen. Also they may run out of some of the food items. PRO TIP: BRING YO JACKET FOO. You will need it while waiting outside. So yeah back to the ughhh WANGS!!! ?Dayem these were crispy and crunchy and chickeny and totally different from any that I had had before. Make sure you get the dry wings as they are fully basted and dripping. I cant fathom what the wet wings look like! We also got two other items: the Garlic Green Beans (super tasty and yummy) and the Noodles with Peanut Sauce. Yeah I cringed over peanut sauce covered noodles also... I was thinking this will be absolutely nasty. So when I bit into it, I was totally surprised. It was basically Chinese Satay noodles with seafood mixed in. My friend ate all the scallops and mushrooms (yeah I know I know I'm not a fungai eh?) and I had all the shrimpies! BUT wow this stuff was decadent and went real well with the wings and green beans. PRO TIP: Drop off a passenger while you find parking to get your name on the list. It will save you a good 15-20 minutes waiting in line at least. Definitely the weirdest food I have ever had together at a Chinese restaurant, but DAYEMZ that grub was tasty. Then again since I hadn't eaten anything but a Costco Polish dog all day, I coulda just been hungry. Regardless, this stuff was awesome. The service was a lil curt (cept for the guy in glasses who directs people to tables). Otherwise yeah this place is too small and should try to expand (unless they like having 20 people milling around in front all day and night long). I definitely want to go back though ASAP. Wow it was good.

As everyone else has previously discussed the original dry fried chicken wings are AMAZING! This review is solely for those! I like to get them boneless because it just makes life easier. This is seriously crack. I was introduced to this wonderful dish by cowokers when I lived in the city. I haven't found anything like this since and definitely crave it all the time.

Dry fried chicken wings -- that's all I have to say. ...but I'll give this review a bit more substance. Unless you're really impatient, don't let the crowd of people outside scare you off. It's well worth the wait! Also ordered both the cold noodles and the black bean sauce noodles too, which can definitely be shared among a group of people. Besides, you wouldn't want to fill up on noodles when you have plates and plates of chicken to gorge on, right? But really, dry fried chicken wings. Mmm...

This is one of my favorite Northern Chinese styled restaurants in the Bay Area, but I don't come here for their mediocre Chinese food but their fantastic dumplings and noodles that use their signature dough. When you first set foot into the restaurant, you are most often greeted by an unpleasant odor of carpet cleaner....and dry eraser markers? You quickly glass at an intimidating white board full of crossed out names and realize they're 8 parties of 8 people each in front of you. So you put your name on the board. Wait for an hour, wondering why you even decided to come here in the first place, and then some horribly abrupt waiter sits you down and speaks to you in some broken English even when you are responding to him in Chinese. Well, that's the typical experience at San Tung--really unpleasant until you get the food. I say that the discomfort makes the experience that much more memorable. When my family and I come here, we normally get their pork dumplings, shrimp dumplings, steamed pot stickers (not that fried crap), their dry spiced chicken, and black bean noodles. Each one of the dishes is good enough to outweigh all the unpleasantry that preceded the food. Their dumplings are flavorful, soupy, and are encased in their divine dough. Their noodles are equally awesome because of the dough and is drenched in a pretty good black bean sauce. As everyone rightfully says, their chicken wings and drums are great. Though I can't express the same accolades for the rest of their menu. I think this restaurant should be judged on a different criteria than other restaurants in the city. This place puts its emphasis on their signature dishes, nothing else. You're going to get bad service, unless the heavyset owner is your waiter. You're going to laugh at first when they ask you to sit down with another family because they're out of room, and then realize that they were being serious. You're going to hate their decor and their bathrooms especially. In the end, however, you're going to love the food, and at least I think that makes up for everything.

CRACK WINGSSS!! so good. probably as good as the chicken wings i have had in new york! The place is small and the wait is long (but totally worth it). We use to come here a lot when we were growing up but since its gotten really popular, we haven't really been back until now! The wings were super good and cooked to perfection. The shrimp and leek dumplings were juicy and delicious. The sizzling rice soup was okay.. and the green beans were perfect!! Definitely recommend you coming here if you love chicken wings like I do...!! *TIP: They take reservations if you have a party over 6 so its definitely in your best interest to do so!

Been hearing about this place for a while since I moved to SF and I finally went with some friends of mine over the summer. ?It def lives up to the hype! we all got an order of the spicy seafood noodle soup (not sure what it's really called..), and shared some of the dumplings, and of course the wings! The soup was exceptional. I absolutely loved it, one of the best I've ever had and it was enough for 2 people definitely (even had leftovers). the dumplings were known to be really good.. but I'm not impressed, probably because I'm not a big fan of dumplings in general. ?Now the wings. holy hell.. the portions were so big, it stayed crispy and hot even though we kinda let it sit while we ate our noodles + gossiped for the entire meal lol it was really good and definitely lived up to its hype! the only thing is, this place is pretty pricey for being on irving. ?There's better choices along Irving for other entrees definitely but this place is worth it just for their wings.

Flew back home into the SF airport and wanted to grab a bite before the drive back to Sacramento! My hubby read up on on the review on Yelp and it seem like everyone's recommendation were their fried chicken! So we arrive there circling the block a few times hoping to find a good parking spot. Took us merely 30 minutes to find parking 2 blocks down from the restaurant. We walk into literally a mad house full of people!! Absolutely NO vacant seats available and crowds of people standing around waiting to be seated. Considering we just flew in and were a bit tired, we didn't want to wait and decided to take our order for to-go. We had to squeeze our way through to the back of the restaurant where their register was located. Hoping to be serviced immediately, we had to stand for a good 10 minutes because every waiter and waitress were too busy going in and out of the kitchen with plates full of chicken in their hands!! Finally after having to flag down a waiter numerous of times, someone was kind enough to stop and help us. We ordered 2 plates of chicken; one dry which is basically fried chicken and the other with their house sauce mixed in. To be honest? These wings weren't finger licking good or to die for in my opinion. We didn't know what all the hype was about! Perhaps we had better fried chicken at Sandra Dee's in Sacramento? Well whatever it is, we weren't too impressed. The dry fried chicken was good but it didn't seem like they used some sort of special house batter to deep fry with to give it that extra goodness. The fried chicken with the sauce was mediocre. The sauce was sweet and it did get a bit messy in the car! I have learned that day that I prefer my fried chicken without any sauces smothered on top. All in all, I probably would come back to try out other dishes here if I'm ever in the vicinity. But I definitely won't go out of my ways to come back!

The San Tung wings are the only things in my recent memory that have bypassed my hatred of eating with MY HANDS. Their sticky, garlicky, sweet/tangy, crunchy chicken is well worth a trip to the bathroom sink. I saw someone take a whole bunch of these to go, which seems like a great idea. Having some sort of TV marathon with these wings + bottomless pitchers of beer seems like a good time. The walnut prawns are crunchy and savory, but I tasted a little too much mayo. The same dish at Great China in Berkeley tasted lighter/better. The wait can be annoying, and you may have some linecutters, too (I'm talkin' to you, "RAINIA"). Write your name down on the whiteboard as soon as you arrive!

First of all- DO NOT COME AT 6PM ON A WEEKEND. I had a party of 6 and we ended up being #35 or something on the waiting list- nuh uh. Second of all- if you don't like loud places, please choose take-out. The restaurant is cramped and the noise level, due to all the young patrons, is LOUD. Despite the hour and a half wait though, the chicken wangs made it all worth it! The dry chicken wings HIT. THE. SPOT. We had both the boneless ones and the regular ones, and both were fried to perfection. The sauce was so good that some of us poured it on our rice. And do not fear, if you're a vegetarian! We had two vegetarians in our party and we all ended up sharing the delicious string beans and eggplant. And THIS is why Panda Express will never be considered real asian food...!

I heard so many great things about San Tung and was super excited to try it. We ordered take out which probably was not the best idea. Wings are meant to be eaten on the spot which they are fresh and still crispy. We ordered: Veggies #107: healthy, not very memorable Chicken wings #74 and 75: one order of the wet and one order of the dry. They were good, but I have to go back and try them there to give a fair review. Noodles w peanut sauce #11: just ok, very heavy Beef w black mushroom: ok String beans #113: good Shrimp fried rice #128: average Sizzling rice soup #31: pretty good, healthy Broccoli chicken #68: average

Been going to the San Tung circa 1992 when it was small hole-in-the wall restaurant ?off 24th Ave. Still enjoy the nice rich dumplings Shrimp and Chive or Pork. This place is not your typical Chinese joint, but more Chinese/Korean cross cultural fushion thus the Black Bean Sauce Noodles (Jajang Myung) Spicy Noodles (Jampong) Tang Su Yuk (Sweat and Sour beef/bork brown sauce) Cabbage kimchi and finally the infamous Dry Fried Chicken (Kampoongi) I find the best way to order is pick-up. ?Call, order, wait 20min pick it up and avoid the long, long, long lines. For those of you who crave Dried Fried Chicken, you can always go to SO's off Bryant owned by the other brother. :)

There's two things I always get when I come here: 1) Dried fried chicken wings: pretty much everyone that has reviewed San tung has ordered this which means you must get this. What separates theses wings from other places is definitely the sauce they use. There's the wet and dried version of this dish but pretty much tastes the same. I like eating this with rice. 2) Black bean sauce noodles: this noodle dish is great! It has a lot of flavor so I like to pair this with dumplings(: *Expect to wait an hour when it is dinner time. I wish the restaurant was bigger so customers won't need to wait as long. **Order take out to avoid the crazy wait :)

Did I order the wrong chicken wings? Got the "wet" fried chicken and apparently the "wet" string beans as well. It's better than most places but it's not something that I crave. The chicken was saucy and the flavor was good but not spicy as I had thought. The string beans were flavored with garlic and soy sauce but too soggy. Also got some dumplings which were actually pretty good and big portions too! The skin was soft and the filling was just enough. Got it to go because the wait on a Sunday night was going to be about 1.5 to 2 hours. I don't even know how the wait list works. Better be willing to wait if you want to go. We had to wait 30 minutes for our food. Then we had to give them an extra 10. Don't know if it was worth it or not.

Floured in crack, seasoned with meth, their chicken wings are sooo addicting!!! OK, they're not floured in crack, etc etc, but yes, I'd drive all the way from the east bay to sunset just for the wings. I love their signature dry fried chicken wings here. I don't know what it is about these wings, but they are totally worth coming here for. ?I can't comment on the other items on the menu because we never order anything else. I don't even care what other menu items there are. ?What else can I say? ? Oh, super busy during lunch, then starts getting busy again around 3-4. Come by, eat lots, lets get fat together!

After seeing the raving reviews of over 2000+ customers...we had to try this place. It is legit. Cut the BS and go straight for the wings. They are no joke. The dried chicken wings are spiced with ginger, sugar, garlic and some other magical rub that just make this so addicting. Its got a light crispiness to it that just makes it even better. We also ordered the dumplings and fried rice which I could care less for. Just give me the chicken with beer and I'm set. Expect to sleep after. Hint: go next door if you want to skip the ridiculous line...they serve the same food plus dessert.

Besides the ridiculously long waits and original dry fried chicken (get the whole chicken not the pre-cut ones), there exist other wonders that this place has to offer. first off, the dry black bean sauce noodles are a must, don't even question this, your stomach can thank me later. second, get a bowl of rice! it's $1.50 per bowl but it's a must since it compliments the chicken so well (the chicken is very sauced up) third, repeat #1 and #2... and enjoy. highly recommended for food, not for the long wait or the cramped interior

I came here on a good day, parking wasn't terrible, and the wait wasn't too long. (Until we sat down that is!) We ordered the: 1) Fried chicken wings - These chicken wings are as good as everyone claims! Not spicy but a bit on the sweet side. However, the chicken was very crispy despite being drenched in sauce. 2) Green string beans - Very well seasoned! A great compliment to the chicken wings. 3) Vegetarian dumpings - Unfortunately the dumplings were just so-so. It was pretty bland. 4 STARS

I was here this evening as a suggestion from a friend from work. ?This has been on my "must try" list for a while and it did not disappoint. The 5 of us ordered 2 orders of wings, veggie pot stickers, pork dumplings, green beans, and garlic spinach. ?The wings were amazing, I could have eaten another order all by myself, the spinach was also amazing - nice and garlicky and very tender. The veggie pot stickers were ginormous, and MOLTEN hot (I would like to try them in a "porkier" format) The pork dumplings were good, but this gal likes her dumplings FRIED (please). ?The beans were also a winner. I spied duck at another table and would like to try it. The noodles at yet another table looked gloppy and not so good. I want to go back ASAP, there was a wait when we got there but we were in within 15 minutes, so not bad at all. Bonus points fro a fairly clean ladies room (by chinese food restaurant standards). it was $15/per person including a slightly generous tip. ?nice price.

Unsure why I have not written a review for this MAJESTIC PLACE. It's pretty much going to sound like all the other reviews: THE CHICKEN WAS BOMB DOT COM. NEVER HAD ANYTHING LIKE IT. WILL PROBABLY NEVER EAT ANYTHING LIKE THIS AGAIN. DRY SUGAR COATED CRACK IS WHAT IT IS. The black bean noodle reminded me of authentic Chinese food in northern China, where my mom's from, aka it hits home from me. I could eat it for eternity. Green beans. Have never loved a vegetable like so. Also coated with some form of an addictive (safe) drug). Dumplings. Shrimp and leek. Fresh and delicious. And if you're wondering if 2 people can eat all of the above, the answer is yes. Get as much as you can. Leftovers have a half life, don't taste as good, but still, but still. Drawback is there always a wait at popular hours. It's fine. It's worth it. It's not as long as you think. Hover over eating patrons while you wait. Salivate at the sight of the chicken wings. I've never creeped a table WITHOUT the chicken wings. If you go and don't get the chicken wings, you are crazy. Ok, do you get my point? You have to try this at least once.

DRY-FRIED CHICKEN. I was originally going to give this place 4 stars because the other dishes we ordered that day were so forgettable. But then I realized that since that fateful day, whenever I get hungry, all I can think about are their crispy and crunchy on the outside, moist and flavorful on the inside, delicious dry-fried chicken, which are drenched ever-so-lovingly with a succulent, sweet and savory, sticky honey-like, crack-laced glaze. It was so incredibly addicting that I wanted to lick the plate clean once they were all gone (but pride and self-control got in the way). The next time (and there WILL be a next time) I visit, methinks I shall simply order multiple plates of dry-fried chicken.

I really want to give this place 5 stars, but I just can't. Though its chicken wings are AMAZING, some of their dishes aren't. The chicken wings are alway so tender and juicy inside, covered with that sweet and spicy sauce on the outside. It makes you want to pour all that leftover sauce on the plate onto your rice so you can finish it all up. It's THAT good. I don't know how they make it so heavenly, but I have yet to find that place that can beat San Tung. I also like their spicy seafood noodles (warning: it's spicy!), and their green beans :) Yum. On the other hand, some dishes were not that memorable, such as their mushu wraps. I also didn't find their dumplings to be that great, if I wanted dumplings in the Sunset , I would just go to Kingdom of Dumplings on Taraval. But if you go, you MUST try its famous chicken wings, you will NOT regret it, trust me :)

I came here with several people, some of which I never met before until that day. Matt and James mostly. The rest I knew. As you can see by the name of the restaurant, this place is mainly chinese food, except this place is not your typical Chinese restaurant. There is no fish tank. Hope to come back w/ my gf. She is Chinese.

Fellow Yelper Fia R and I visited this popular Shandong restaurant after spending the morning walking around Golden Gate Park. For the longest time I had stayed away from San Tung after hearing about their poor service, but decided to find out in person as several Yelpers alluded to their Dry Fried Chicken Wings as something too good to pass up. The décor was antiquated with a home-style ambiance and packed with a huge crowd from front to the kitchen in the back. The wait was suggested at 45 minutes during our visit, but in reality it took a lot longer than that. Interested diners should look for a clipboard hanging by the door, sign up, and wait inside as the server only calls for the next table for those in the area to hear it. If you decide to wait outside you might be out of luck by the time you come back to check on the wait list. Their menu consists of Shandong cuisine that also included a listing of Chinese-Korean items such as Liang Zhang Pi, Spicy Seafood Noodles, Jiajang Myung, and etc. They gave us a side dish of Kimchi from the start, followed by the order of Shrimp and Leek Dumplings ($7.50), Dry Sautéed String Beans ($8), and Original Dry Fried Chicken Wings ($9.50). The boiled Shrimp and Leek Dumplings were not very good. The wrapper was too thin, lacked texture, and the fillings were dry and bland. I wished I had read Tan's review prior to this visit: http://eat.tanspace.com/…. I don't recommend it. Their Sautéed String Beans were fried to dry to my liking. It could use a bit more flavoring but the texture was on point and fresh. The String Beans were accompanied with garlic sauce and diced Chinese pickle. I wished they could wok fry this dish longer as the flavors were layered instead of fully integrated into the String Beans. The overall taste was decent, but Kingdom of Dumplings can make them better and they are not too far away. Many reviewers gave 5 star ratings based upon their Original Dry Fried Chicken Wings alone and I can understand why. The Wings were crispy, spicy, garlicky, sugary coated and fried to dry. The Wings had a mix of textures and depths. It was very good by all measures. I missed out on some interesting dishes so I would absolutely return to give them a try. This includes Tea Smoked Duck, Hot Braised Chicken, and their Chinese-Korean items. Servers were oddly all male and their attitudes were straight-laced and not friendly. Overall, I still believe this is one of the restaurants that are worth visiting in San Francisco given the uniqueness of their Wings. Good, but somewhat overhyped. Not yet a fan, 3.5 stars for the overall experience.

This place is really hyped up. My whole family came here for my bros graduation. We took up two of those round tables. We tried almost everything on the menu ...everything came with a thick sweet sauce! geezuz! We did try the chicken wings, yes, they were good but I would have liked it with out the sauce. The chicken fried rice as ALRIGHT. The string beans, ALRIGHT. We ordered a bunch of other stuff that I can't quite remember because well, it just wasnt that amazing for me. I dunno, wasn't too impressed at all and its usually pretty easy to please me. I also asked if they had beef chow fun and they don't serve that ... *sad face*

Yeah, yeah, everyone writes about it...dry fried chicken wings... They are pretty good. I like the whole Korean-influenced Chinese thing, but I don't like crowds. Interesting dish that I tried: black bean noodles with seafood? It was actually pretty good and something different. I really enjoyed it! But please, if you haven't done so, try the wings. If you like it, great, you can come back, if not...well at least you tried it and can check that off your SF foods to try bucket list.

4 stars overall? seriously? this place deserves 5 and a half stars! Everything here is good; obviously I haven't had the opportunity to try everything on the menu, but from experience I can guarantee you that everything on the menu will be delicious. my family and I have come here NUMEROUS times (Dinner is alwayssss packed and you need to put your name on a whiteboard near the door). You are served kimchi (not very good) and tea when you are seated while u wait for your food. My family and I always get the pork dumplings (Yes!), some kind of vegetable with pork and tofu dish ?and DRY FRIED CHICKEN WINGS. that is what the restaurant is all about. must get this. Everyone I know thats every been to the restaurant always orders at least two servings of the dry fried chicken wings - you can not be satisfied with just one order once you bite into that sweet, crunchy delicious mix. :]

I finally came here after their remodeling closure and I really don't get what's all the hubbub is about. I came for lunch with some friends before noon and so we beat the famous lines. My friends have eaten the food here before and told me its good. I was excited to try their famous chicken, some of their black bean noodles and the potstickers. The food was very pricey in my opinion. The chicken $9.50, arrived first and there were only 12 pieces! I was a little shocked to see how little you get. I wondered how different the portion size is if you order the chicken but from the lunch menu. The chicken was honey glazed and crisp and don't get me wrong, they smelled delicious! I just didn't get what all the hype is about. Tasted like regular honey glazed chicken for me....the black bean noodles came second which is also $9.50, was surprisingly tiny also. The noodles came in a small bowl. I mixed the noodles and tried them. I think eating the instant packs from Korean supermarkets taste a lot better. Finally the potstickers came. My friend ordered it fried because it supposedly tastes better. There were only six potstickers! I think the dish was $3.50? but I don't remember. The stickers were tasteless to me even after saucing them with hot sauce and some soy sauce. I don't think I would become a regular here. It gets full very quickly if you don't get there early and I honestly don't think the wait is worth it.

My answer after trying them, absolutely friggin' delicious! ?Perfect combination of sweet, sour, and crunch. ?The only thing I'd add is a little more kick but other than that, amazing. ? I sat down at a table near the kitchen and seriously, they have to have a station just dedicated to making these things. ?In my 45 minutes there, I must have counted at least 20 orders of their Original Dry Fried Chicken wings pushing through the kitchen. ?If you're in the area go to San Tung for the wings, you won't be disappointed.

Everyone raves about the dry fried chicken wings here. I guess they're good -- if you've never lived in or been to NY and had the korean fried chicken -- see NYT article here: http://www.nytimes.com/2…; also can check out Kyochon, Bonchon, UFC among others). I got super excited thinking it was that kind of new wave chicken wing, but it ended up just being the regular chicken that comes in all Chinese-Korean fusion restaurants (kan poon gi) Don't get me wrong - the chicken is not inedible. It's fine. Two-dimensional at best. It's slightly spicy + garlicky, so they're on the right track. The skin texture leaves much to be desired as it's thick and not enough of the fat is rendered. I was hoping for a thin but crispier type of skin. The spinach with bean threads was heavenly. I would come here again just for that.

Don't be fooled and order their WET Fried Chicken. That was my mistake the very first time I came and went home cursing for how soggy the chicken was and how Yelp lied to me. Year's later, I dared to return and ordered the Dry Fried Chicken after a friend set me straight... and damn... it is finger-licking, sticky-icky goooooood! I don't remember too much about their other food other than it was not worth the ridiculous wait (definitely not the best chinese food). Order take-out unless you want to wait 2 hours for a table. Took off 1 star because no matter how good their chicken is, the wait time scares me enough so that I don't come back too often.

This is definitely a place to eat in you're in SF, if you don't, you are totally missing out on these crazy wings. ?The sauce is amazing, the wings are fried just right. ?I don't think I can eat at any other wings establishment ever again, its San Tung or die.

The other thing we got like the dumpling is a major Pass...the skin was soggy n the meat was blah...the hand made noodles was unexpectedly addictive but the black bean sauce was quite bland...save the stomach space and just go with the chicken wings n drown the rice in the sauce... and u got yourself a great yet simple meal.

3.5 stars? It was pretty tasty...and yes I did try their very populate dry fried chicken which my friends and I were all very eager and hyped up to try. They were light, crispy and had a nice soy sauce type coating- kind of reminded of kyochon chicken. Would I come back for this? maybe? maybe...... Some other things I tried: their peanut sauce noodles- interesting. pretty good....but olily. Something good to try...but not something to go cray for. Being it our 1st time there, we weren't sure what to get...but it turned out that we ended up getting everything "DRY FRIED". we got the DRY FRIED CALAMARI, DRY FRIED SHRIMP. and we had like 2 orders of some of them....guess it was the way to go LULZ. The calamari and squid was delicious and there was a generous portion of it. Since I came with a big group in time for dinner rush hour...we made a smart decision by calling ahead and making reservations. and boy are we glad we did! We arrived around 8:30pm and sure enough there was a huge crowd waiting outside...and inside....on a tuesday night......and literally walked in and sat down. WHADDDAPPP SUCKASSSS haha so now u know. if u gots a big group, pick up the phone and call ahead. not sure if they will take reservations w/ small groups though....it worth a try!

YES! YES! YES!...to their amazing dry-fried chicken wings! I am such a chicken wing aficionado that my bar was set pretty high. However, their chicken wings did not disappoint at all. For $9.50, they'll give you a healthy plate full of some of the most succulent wings I've ever had in my life. Of course they only have their one flavor but don't let that deter you. You should realize that the sauce adds so much to their wings and they prepare it in a way that the wings don't get soggy from the sauce. That may be due to the fact that this salty-sweet sauce is more of a glaze than an actual sauce. Anyway, no matter what you come here for, always order a plate of wings. As for the rest of our meal, it was your typical Chinese fare but with slightly more flavor and more finesse. If you look in the back, the kitchen consists of a dozen or so men who are all Chinese. That makes this food pretty legit in my opinion. The rest of our meal consisted of white rice, sizzling rice soup, and chicken with black mushrooms. All the dishes were excellent. Prepare for a wait. Wear a jacket or coat as you will mostly likely have to be waiting outside. If you're smart, you'd just call in for pick up and just eat your food at home. Once you get to the restaurant, make sure to put your name on the whiteboard to the right of the doors when you walk in.

Came here for my second time and I am still not impressed. Service was terrible. I don't expect great service at chinese restaurants but this place really sucked. Our water was never filled even after we asked them. They brought the appetizer after our entree. The mongolian beef lacks any flavor. The pot stickers were just deep fried and also lacked any flavor. The food here seems to be pretty bland in general. My moms broccoli chicken had the same problem. If the service was better I would bump them up to a 3 star review cause this place is average.

This used to be my family's go to place for dinner. But oh my gosh we hate the wait and we hate finding parking around there. Go early or drop someone off to put a name down while you go park. My family and I finally visited it again after months, and we ordered our usual. ? Dry Fried Chicken Wings--Sweet and salty, sticky and dry, crunchy and tender, these chicken wings have a combination of flavors that will fit any palette. The sauce is sweet and peppery, I'm still trying to figure out what's in it because it's super addictive. It'll taste good with anything! Dan Dan Noodle--It's very peanut-buttery and spicy at the same time. The noodle is chewy and there are bits and pieces of seafood and cucumber in it. The sauce is super thick and gooey, which is frustrating trying to mix it with the noodle, but once it's well mixed, gosh, it's yummy. Pork with Mustard Green Noodle Soup--They give you very generous amount of mustard green and shredded pork. I love this noodle soup. It's very comforting and not overly salty, so that it doesn't make me thirsty afterward. The noodle is chewy! Pork Dumplings--These dumplings are very poofy and meaty. It's a little bland, but nothing their soy sauce with hot chilly oil can't fix. The service is just okay. It takes awhile to get their attention but overall pretty decent. Some of the items are on a pricer side, but the portion is pretty big.

Like a trip to Hong Kong, and yes the wings are awesome, but come out hot and wet but cool to wonderful goowey. Perfect balance of salt, sweet and spicy! We did not love the black bean noodles, the shrimp and scallion dumplings were loved by me but not by him. We thought the Beef and Broccoli had nice wok haye, and wished we had the hot and sour soup. Great experience, immaculately clean from dining room, to staff and visible kitchen. Go early, order heavy and take home the spoils.

Dry fried chicken wings were awesome! They look like they'll be wet and sticky, but they're dry to the touch and very tasty. Yummm... Didn't get a chance to try the dry black bean noodle - next time. The other dishes we ordered were standard Chinese, nothing remarkable. We got there early on a weekend - maybe about 5:30ish? It was just my fiance and I, so our wait was fairly short. But we did see the line get long after us, so plan accordingly.

No, not really. ?My friend does like coming here to have the black bean noodles, but I'm not a huge fan of them. ?It's more of a Korean Chinese dish than a Chinese dish.

If you get anything from here, make it the dry chicken wings! They are SO amazingly good! We came here around lunch time on a weekday and the place was packed, we had to wait a good 20 minutes to be seated. Service was typical especially since it was busy. We also got the black bean noodle dish and the won-tons which were alright, nothing too special. The wings though...melt in your mouth deliciousness. The perfect blend of seasonings and sauce.

It was 9:00pm, I was exhausted and walking to my car after Outsidelands, and there San Tung stood, like a beacon of light in the dense Sunset District fog. The food was sufficient, but not mind-blowing. I'm pretty impressed by the fact that the restaurant has over +2800 reviews....must be all the fellow asians in SF yelping. Wait was only 10 minutes which was nice, but I was still surprised by how packed it was since it was after 9pm on a Sunday. I knew that the dishes to get were the chicken wings, the black bean noodles, and some dumplings, but I wasn't in the mood for any of those things! And what about the other dishes?! Shouldn't they get some lovin' too?! Shouldn't I try to be a little more adventurous then exclusively relying on what yelpers tell me I should get? In the end, I tried the kung pao chicken, the mapo tofu, and the dried sauteed string beans. Kung Pao chicken is missable, the mapo tofu is pretty good, and the string beans were the best! flavorful and savory veggies, what's not to like! The portions are large, the prices are good, and chinese food always make the best leftovers. Do skip the kimchi they bring to you in the beginning. It was disgusting and I really believe ours was sitting out all day. As for paying, don't try to pay with 2+ credit cards unless you hit the $25 minimum per card. Alas, I will be back! Must try the chicken wings....

lunch with high school friends: rc siblings, ap, hk, ml, jw, jz, cl, px, and there was also sl reservations made this wasn't our first choice but so many places were closed on new years eve. even before the food arrived everything seemed rather dirty. there was chunks of residue on my plate. a chunk of something on the inside of one of the bowls that i saw sitting 2 feet away. i asked for the spoon to get switched. there was some red powder stuck on the outside of the tea cup. i didn't eat much. everything was rather saucy and the sauces were oil based except for a few items. fried chicken wings wet: - this has more gravy sauce - the fatty part of the wing had to be disposed of onto my plate instead of swallowed fried chicken wings dry: - crispier and less fatty feeling - just the right amount of sweetness seafood noodle soup: - super long noodles that got super messy - shrimp was over cooked 1 bathroom for the girls and 1 for the boys. it didn't smell and was fairly clean.

All I have to say ?is that they have the best chicken wings ever. The wings just have so many different flavors that goes together. It a very unique, sweet, salty, savory taste. I don't know how else to explain it. Also I had the Black Bean sauce Noodle which was also very good. All in all, there will be a wait, especially during dinner time and on weekends. Also, just stick with the chicken wings! Everything else is mediocre.

5 stars for the dry fried chicken wings. SWEET. CRISPY. DELECTABLE. ?The sweet sauce is really sticky like honey, which helps the wings stay crisp. The dry crispy texture of San Tung's wings can't be beat! As for the rest of the food, it was definitely good, but not mind numbingly awesome like the chicken wings. We had the Hot and sour soup, black bean sauce noodles and the honey walnut prawns. The hot and sour soup was great, had a little spicy kick to it, and had lots of ingredients to it (tofu, sea cucumber, shrimp, etc). ?I like hot and sour soups with a lot of substance. The black bean sauce noodles were good, but nothing to rave about. Pretty standard in my opinion. The honey walnut prawns were good, but definitely gluttonous. Think of fried prawns covered in sweet honey mayo Tip #1: Eat your wings there, don't take leftovers. Microwaving them will make them soggy. Tip #2: Prepare for long waits around dinner time especially on weekends. Avoid by ordering take out or coming early.

First of all. when i first heard about this place my brother was hyping it so much. so me and my family came here and once we arrived to the restaurant we saw a HUGE line. but good thing we reserved, so we didnt have to wait, once we were sat we got some kimchi ( weird having a korean food at a Chinese restaurant ?) but regardless it was delicious and SPICY. We ordered Shrimp&Chive Dumplings and Pork Cabbage Potstickers to start, they both were AMAZINGLY tasty. the shirmps were huge and plump and bursting with flavor while the pork potstickers were crispy on the outside and moist on hte inside. finally the DRY CHICKEN CAME. Oh my God, this chicken was on a next level of flavor and awesomeness, too awesome to describe you must TRY. mouthgasm. * BTW, ?i've been here many times before now, just thought i do a review on my first experience here. * Ps. every time i come the food is amazing.

Came here for the chicken wings, was not disappointed. From the outside, I thought this would be a "Korean-Chinese" place. It says "San-Dong-Ban-Jum" in Korean on the outside. But San Tung was not like the typical Korean-Chinese joints I was used to. We got the famous chicken wings (I think this is Ggan-Poong chicken in korean, but its usually made with cubed chicken) dry. Dry doesn't mean there's no sauce on it, so go ahead and order these if you want glazed sauce on the outside. The skin was perfectly crisp, and the glaze was sweet and savory. I saw other people order the black noodles that is a staple at Korean-Chinese joints. They also looked different from what I was used to. I assumed this place is more heavily Chinese, although I cannot say for sure since I am not Chinese. They were just..different from the Jja Jang Myung I was used to seeing, and also different from the Chinese zha jiang mien I've eaten numerous times. I'm wondering if it's like a SF-Korean-Chinese thing... Anyways, no matter what the influences are, the food was delicious. Those chicken wings are definitely worth a try.

Some of the best Chinese food I've ever had. My suggestions: vegetarian mushu platter and the dry fried chicken wings. Both were absolutely heavenly. The service sucked major ____, but you know what, that's par for the course with hole-in-the-wall places with amazing food. Just expect it. That's all.

The hype is right. San Tung = DRY FRIED CHICKEN WINGS. After almost a year of living in the Sunset, I've finally tried their amazing chicken wings. Why did I wait so long?!? San Tung's got it down. The wings are juicy, tender, tangy, spicy and addicting. The wait for a table is a little ridiculous, so unless you luck out on timing, I'd recommend ordering it to-go. And with just one visit I'm officially hooked... I'll be back soon!

What to say about San Tung that hasn't been said before? ? Obviously, if you're coming here, you're coming here for one thing. ?The chicken wings. ?Quick fried, then drenched in a msg laden mix of sticky goodness, these things are to die for. ?I could probably eat them once a week or something a long those lines and still be happy. ?The other food is all very mediocre chinese food. ?You eat it as fillers to go along with your fried chicken. ?The chicken is the one thing you come here for and not much else. Parking can be a pain in the behind, but park a couple blocks down near St. Annes and there should be plenty of parking there, walk a little. ?The wait can be long but I've always come with K on a weekday around 6-630 pm and I've never had to wait for a seat. ?The tables are close to each other, you might end up eating with strangers but that's part of eating Chinese food. ?Don't be intimidated as pretty much all the waiters speak English, it's blown up that much on Yelp that they've basically needed to learn English. If you really want to, on my last visit, I noticed that the dessert place next door serves the Chicken wings also as a snack (I found out the place is owned by the same owner of San Tung) so you can sneak ?in there to eat the Chicken wings if the wait is too long in the actual restaurant. Go for the Chicken wings, don't expect much from anything else. ?But the wings are so good, they earn a 4 stars all on their own.

This place is sooo awesome. San Tung is a Chinese province near Korea, so you get a bit of both worlds. San Tung is famous for noodles/dumplings/buns and is where my ancestors are from. All my life I've always been particularly fond of noodles and dumplings, think it's in my blood. San Tung is home of the famous dry fried chicken and was the sole reason for our journey to the inner sunset area on this trip. These wings are le-gen-da-ry and was definitely worth the drive, however the jang pong aka tsao mah mein aka spicy seafood noodle soup totally stole the show for me. These noodles were top notch and amongst the best I've had. The dumplings aren't too shabby either. San Tung is definitely worth the visit if you're into cheap delicious eats. If you're a snob for service and decor as a requirement for a great restaurant, don't bother, this place is not for you. I can't wait to go back again.

I haven't had their famous chicken wings. I will say that jjajangmyun and jjambong are a favorite amongst Koreans. When you order one you want the other so quite a few jjajangmyun places allow you to order what they call the "jjajjambong" which is a bowl that is divided in half (so dishes won't mix) and one side contains the jjajjangmyun (black bean noodle dish) and the other half has jjambong (spicy noodle soup). You always want one when you have the other. Always. Uhhhh so San Tung doesn't have that option, but their jjambong was yummy. Was it out of this world amazing jjambong? No. I wish there were more noodles. There was a lot of veggies. hahahhaha (I know, ?I know), but I did! I really wished there were more noodles. Service was exactly what I expected, just good enough.

The ratings do not lie! I've been going here for over 10 years and this restaurant never disappoints. The dry fried chicken wings are definitely a winner and popular dish here. ?With just the right amount of sweet and salty, many other restaurants try to imitate it but san tung still reigns supreme. Other dishes I order regularly are the pork dumplings, 5 spice beef noodle soup, and san tung noodles. Definitely go early if you plan to go here for dinner on the weekend, it gets crowded.

Probably the best Chinese restaurant in the city. ?The dry fried wings, black bean noodles, leek dumplings, sweet and sour beef, and spicy seafood noodle are all hits. ?Place fills quickly, and the staff works quick to try and get people in and out. ?Parking sucks in this area of the city. ?If you order to-go, it can be as fast as 15-20 minutes or as long as 40 minutes.

I heard so many people kept telling me how great this place is. However, from the country where I'm from, if you don't have capacity of handling pick-up, it would be better just concentrating to provide better dinning experience rather than trying to offer the so-called service. We were told to pick up our order in 30 mins, and we were left staying in line for another 30 mins w/o nobody even came up and talked to us. I don't believe the city full of thousand restaurants, there isn't a better place with better service. The food was OK. but after this drama, it made their food taste just worse than mediocre.

We went to try San Tung Chinese Restaurant because so many people love it on Yelp & it was named one of the top 50 Chinese restaurants in the Country. ?I can't believe it. Ate a late lunch because we went to the DeYoung Museum first. ?Got there about 12:30pm & there was a line Easter Sunday 4/8/12. Ordered a bunch of stuff for 3 people: FREE kimchi given right when we sat down - i liked it Shrimp & pork dumplings - 12 small dumplings steamed. ?Tasted ok. Dry fried string beans - what's with the sweet goopy sauce? ?Veggies shouldn't be sweet. Five spice beef noodle soup - Huge bowl of homemade noodles (we think), several beef pieces, some veggies. ?I liked the noodles, beef was fine, just not enough, veggies average, soup base only tasted salt. Dry fried chicken wings- their famous dish, cousin loves it. ?B. & I found it too sweet. ?Comes w/ that same sweet goopy sauce as the string beans. Steamed rice Charged the meal about $41 before tip. ? Separate bathrooms in the back. ?They put the fortune cookies near the men's bathroom!

I remember when my grandparents used to take my family here for lunch before the Yelp hype began--no waits, great service, excellent excellent food. Now, I'll be lucky to get in here without waiting for at least 20 minutes for lunch or dinner on a weekend. To let you know about the wait, my grandparents (who are elderly and have a hard time waiting around for food when their glycemic levels are low), no longer come here though my brother and I make the venture out just for those bomb chicken wings. We order to go usually because that's the easiest and, to be honest, the service is kind of lacking these days and I would rather not deal with the hustle and bustle of the restaurant. These chicken wings are my standard for all other chicken wings; nothing has ever gotten close to their tangy, salty, sweet glaze or fried perfection. I also usually order the black bean noodles and my parents enjoy the seafood noodle soup. Their noodles, I believe, are freshly made and have excellent texture and bite to them. Come out here if you don't mind waiting for a taste of delicious San Francisco Chinese-Korean fanfare.

So the funny thing about a place that has one signature dish, (chicken wings) is that people fail to objectively review the restaurant's other food. or they just give a 5-star rating based on the one signature dish. Yes, the chicken wings are good-- crispy, sesame-flavored, sweet. Pretty good. definitely 5-stars for the chicken wings. Now, on with the rest of the food. I would say that this is slightly worse than the average good quality/ authentic chinese restaurant. their family style tofu was really bizarrely different from what you would normally get (keep in mind that this is a staple chinese dish)-- but still not half bad. we also got their dry fried string beans which was nicely fried, but on the sweet side-- its usually savory and a bit spicy. another thing--im a big asian sticky-rice fan. they don't serve sticky rice-- im pretty sure it was jasmine rice. that was a disappointment for me. other things were fine. they gave us a pot of tea and some kimchee (why kimchee? i dont know) when we were seated. food came out fast. service was typical for a chinese restaurant. final bit of annoyance here was that we called ahead to see how bad the wait was and they said it was about 15 minutes. we didnt want to wait an hour so we thought this would be okay. we arrived and saw there were 10 parties of 2-3 ppl ahead of us. we asked how long itd take and they said 20 minutes. after 30 minutes we asked again, they said 20 minutes. i think these guys always just say 20 minutes if anyone asks. we should have used our common sense, and realized the restaurant was popular and itd take an hour, but it was frustrating they didnt bother to give us the benefit of their experience to let us know how long itd take. we were quite hungry when we were finally seated. i would give this restaurant 3.5 stars-- i would have given them the benefit of the half star (ie 4 stars-- had they not given us a poor estimation of how long it'd take to be seated).

San Tung is the restaurant with the big crowd outside of it. That's how you find this place. There is enough room to fit in about 30 people and there's a special private room for larger parties. The wait was about 40 minutes during the dinner rush. The waiters will fill up tables with four people parties before they fill tables with two people. This place has one of the best chicken wings ever. This is a must try for anyone who comes here. The sauce they put on it is amazing. It's a bit sweet, but not too sweet. The wings are crispy with the right amount of sauce. The black bean noodles are pretty great also. I can't really say there wasn't anything I ate there that I didn't like.

Parking is a bit hard to find around this area unless you get lucky and either get a meter or parking around the residential area. Also, there is usually a line so you will put your name on the white board until they call your name to be seated. I'll cut it short. The dried fried chicken wings are the best!!! Get it dried not wet, because it is cooked to perfection. That's the best thing to get at San Tung. The dumplings aren't bad either. The restaurant hand makes the dumplings. The string beans are also tangy and crunchy, VERY delicious.

Everyone that I've ever taken to San Tung have become addicted to their original dry fried chicken wings. My cousin is flying back to Portland today with an order of chicken wings to take home to her husband. That's how insanely good their wings are. Besides the chicken wings, their hand made noodles are delicious. Go early to avoid the long ass wait list and be prepared for hit or miss service. If you don't want to deal with the long wait, go next door to the ice cream shop and order the chicken wings to go.

Food: 3/5- ?Highly overrated. ?I'm spoiled by the Chinese cuisine from Monterey Park/Alhambra area, so I was very disappointed by the food.

Always fried perfectly! -Peanut Sauce Noodles - Has a strong peanut taste but its reallly good! -Shrimp Fried Rice - -Potstickers This place is worth the hype! GET THE CHICKEN WINGS!

I don't get the hype and the subsequent enormous waits. Luckily I came with a party of nine so we were able to reserve a table but after having eight different dishes, I was not particularly impressed with any of them. We had the dried bean curd, mongolian beef, chive dumplings, fried rice, combination seafood, garlic eggplant, sauteed green beans, and the infamous chicken wings. Everything was your typical Chinese food that could be found at any restaurant and nothing left me grabbing for the last serving on the table. I also don't appreciate being rushed through the meal and out of the restaurant. I understand that it's busy but people are trying to enjoy their food, not scarf it down. I will admit that the chicken wings are good, but would I wait 1+ hours for them? No.

I had San Tung recently with my family and it was extremely busy, which is not a problem for good food. The wait was about 45mins, not too bad. I've been to San Tung several times and every time I come here I always order the same thing: Chicken Wings, Dumplings, String Beans, and a noddle dish and it always pretty good. But, this time it was extremely medico. The string beans were way too sweet, which my mom and dad thought so as well. The flavor of the string beans is the same flavor they use to the chicken wing, which works for the wings not so much the string beans. I wish the string beans has some spice or kick to it, it was quite medico. Overall, I will not stop coming here the food is still good, but there is nothing special about the food.

It's an incredibly popular neighborhood Chinese restaurant with long lines even on weeknights, so you should come here really early. First thing you do when you come in is put your name on the wait list. If you are more familiar with southern Chinese cooking, you might be disappointed about this place. Northern cooking is a bit on the bland side. I ordered traditional northern fare: house-made dumplings and noodles. I thought they were just OK. The shrimp and leek dumplings were mildly flavored and is not better than mediocre Cantonese dimsum variant. Probably good for people with strict sodium restrictions. The other northern specialty, noodles with black bean paste was not bad; the hand-made noodles has excellent QQ (al dente) and the scallops were cooked well, but they're not out of this world. What this place is really famous for is the "dried friend chicken" which is not really "dry." It's deep-fried dry, then smothered with sweet garlic chili sauce. If it's spicy, I didn't feel the heat. It was really tasty (good Korean-style fried chicken, but with better sauce), but I wouldn't go out of my way just for them. Also, if that's all you want, you can skip the long lines by going to the next door dessert place (a sister restaurant), which sells something similar, along with bobba. If you don't like the line, check out Yummy Yummy next door. It's not an exact exchange, because Yummy Yummy is a Vietnamese crab place, but it's good eats with no line. People with allergies will probably have to order other things, like pho. Perhaps you might like this place better than me. It's not bad; you'd probably enjoy your meal if you order the fried chicken; but I would still prefer good southern Chinese food.

Best chicken wings EVER! After a night of karaoke and drinking, we woke up hungry and craving chicken wings, so of course we had to come over to San Tung and continue my quest on finishing 7x7's 2012 Big Eats. We got very lucky because there was absolutely no line when we got there and were seated right away. Maybe 5 minutes after we were seated, a huge line was forming, so basically you have to test your luck when you come here on a weekend. If you decide to get one thing and one thing only, you have to get the fried chicken wings. If you are trying to stay neat and clean, you can get them diced, but I prefer the flavor of the ones on the bone. We've gone to SO for their chicken wings, and even though they are just about the same thing, I like the ones at San Tung more. The food and service are fast here, and the staff seems pretty patient since we were sharing a table with this pretty demanding and rude couple, and the staff just took it all. Make sure you prepare yourself for the madness that is finding parking in SF, and remember to be patient when waiting in line, because this place is definitely worth it!

The food is good. I would give 4.5 stars for food. A little bit pricey. Everything we ordered was very good except for the steamed dumplings. Then why do I give only 1 star here? TOO MUCH MSG. I felt so uncomfortable while I was still eating my dinner. My body reacts only to TOO MUCH MSG. I didn't feel anything in most of the Chinese restaurants, both in Asia and SF. And my MSG INTOLERANCE experiences before never this bad. Sorry, San Tung Chinese Restaurant, never see you again. I want to live a longer life even though my taste buds liked you. If MSG not a problem for you, the food here is recommended.

Winner winner, chicken (wings?) dinner! With so many great reviews, I won't go into detail. All you need to know is you come here for the chicken wings. Simple as that. They also serve a comp. side of a Chinese spicy cabbage that goes perfectly well with the wings. Expect a line but know that it'll be worth your wait. You could always call the order in as well. One order is decent for two people to share but might as well order a few because they are just that good. This definitely hit the spot for me as a late night snack after being out at Nightlife across the street in Golden Gate Park.

*Chicken Wings Only* This was part of my last meal before starting my wedding diet. HOLY COW, or rather HOLY CHICKEN WINGS! The place is packed and it's for a good reason. I just went to pick up an order of chicken wings after one of my dearest foodie friends suggested it. Granted I had already stuffed myself with Pasquale's but it was my last meal day, so it had to be done. Every single table I saw coming in had the chicken wings on it. Clearly this is serious wing business. Needless to say they are scrumptious! It has that great tangy chicken wing taste with an Asian flare to it. Crispy, tender, moist and major flavor punch with every bite! Wing heaven people! After the wedding, we are coming here to chow down on the other food. It smelled and looked amazing as I stalked the tables. Can't wait!

This place is a must every time i visit SF, i love me some fried chicken! Food 5/5 Service was 4/5 The wait can be long, but if you don't feel like waiting, definitely check out the sweets place next door, they serve the fried chicken as well... along with red velvet cookies, cupcakes and cakes. so bomb.

I finally went a few weeks ago to try and see what the hype is about. Waited 45 minutes, I mean not that bad except it was freezing outside -__- My friends and I ordered Shrimp and Chive Dumplings, Black Bean Sauce Noodles, and Dry Fried Chicken since it was the top choices on Yelp reviews. I don't know, I thought the Shrimp and Chive Dumplings were okay. It's not all that great, like others have mentioned, it wasn't juicy. It was alright. The Black Bean Sauce Noodles was my favorite though! The sauce was soooo good :) It was quite addicting. I swear I was still savoring the sauce till the end. So they say, the Dry Fried Chicken was up to its standard. It was really crispy and tender! It has a sticky candy sweet honey kinda taste, which differentiates it from other chicken I've tried and I like it! Nom! An advice I have though, DO NOT eat the chicken with the noodles because those two flavors DO NOT mesh well together. Trust. It's pretty weird. Service wise, they were really slow. I understand it was super crowded but still, service is service. I give them a 2.5 because my chicken took WAY too long to come out. I wish I wasn't already full from the other two dishes to completely enjoy the chicken because if I had to wait, my noodles would have gotten super cold. I would go here again though, probably on a weekday at lunch or something!

My love for chicken still resides in San Francisco with SAN TUNG! They always have a long wait but boy is it worth it! Their infamous original dry chicken wings are so sweet and tangy. There are two types you can have it and I stick with dry. I've had the wet wings which comes with mushrooms and bamboo but it's not as good as the dry. Get a side of rice and thats all you really need. Don't be afraid to use your fingers and get dirty. Chicken wings are made to be finger food! Their steamed dumplings are super yummy! Pork and chives mmm... Now that I think of it, I need to make a trip to SF soon for my wing fix.

This place might be underrated. ?Something so simple that no other restaurant has tried. ?The wet wings were addicting and if you are in town or live in SF, this is a must. ?We even ordered 2 to-go orders before our drive back to Los Angeles. ?Unfortunately the wings didn't survive the trip down to socal.

This place is OKAY!!! I tried four things on the menu my first time there. 10 minute wait on Thursday evening at 6:30PM. 1. Beef Broccoli - The meat was tender, maybe a little too tender for my liking. This dish was sub-par. There was a lot of sauce that the beef and broccoli was drowned in. I really don't have much to say about this other than the fact that it was mediocre at best. 2. Honey Walnut Prawns - I have mixed feelings about this dish. Prawns here fairly big, almost like JUMBO prawns. The taste of both the prawns and the walnut were fresh. My main concern with this dish is that there was way too much mayonnaise slathered on. I would try to wipe off some of it before taking a bite. 3. Pork Fried Rice - Again, nothing special. It was ordered as a medium for all of our dishes. I personally believe I can make better friend rice (and have been told I make really good friend rice). The thing I didn't like about this dish is that the rice is kind of soggy. It stuck together in large clumps and it was slightly bland. 4. Dry Fried Chicken Wings - I believe this was the best item I had that day. The chicken is good. Great if I were hungry. I liked how it came out crispy still even though it was super saucy. The flavor of the sauce is on point, sweet yet tangy...perhaps a mixture of X.O. sauce, sugar, honey, lemon...etc. It really isn't special but it was good nonetheless. Maybe I'm a little critical of this place because I'm Chinese and grew up eating a lot of Chinese food. Maybe it's because my dad was the head chef of a popular Chinese restaurant in Oakland Chinatown (http://www.yelp.com/biz/…). Or maybe I've simply had better. Albeit I didn't order a lot of the things people suggest, I ordered a lot of common, staple, Chinese dishes and was not left impressed.

Food: 4/5 Service (on the day we went): 1/5 My first time at San Tung was probably much like a lot of other peoples -- bustling, noisy, and very crowded. All signs of a great business and a good sign that this place would have some solid food. Me and my friends came during the middle of the week and waited outside for about 10 minutes or so before we were all there and were brought in. (Note: it is a good idea to get there a little bit before or after the midday lunch rush otherwise you may be waiting for quite a while). When we were inside we were seated in the back room, away from the main dining area and really nice because we had 5 people in our group and the table had a Lazy Susan so it was perfect for sharing our food. When our waiter took our order, we got pork dumplings, garlic chicken, black bean dry noodles, string bean beef, and two orders of dry friend chicken wings along with sides of rice and our drinks. Needless to say we had a pretty good size feast going -- the only problem was that the waiter NEVER came back once. After he took our order we literally didn't see him for the next 45 min/hour. I understand that it was busy, but there's no way you should completely forget about a party, especially when the door is open to the room and you're passing by it every 20 seconds to get to the kitchen. It wasn't too big of a deal until we got the check -- we noticed that he added tip to the tab which a) wasn't ever put on the menu, b) is usually done for parties of 6+ not 5, and c) wasn't even deserved in the first place. We noticed the mistake (never let a restaurant charge you for something that isn't explicit ally stated) and got it taken off the bill. We ended up tipping anyways out of courtesy, but definitely not as much as was "expected" on the tab. Overall, the food was great, and the dry fried chicken wings were some of the best I ever had, but the service was lacking. But overall the food outweighs the service and I would come back for those chicken wings. Definitely recommended to people who love some good Chinese food.

This place is WAYYYY too crowded for a slightly over-priced, pretty-good tasting Chinese food restaurant. I don't understand the hour+ long waits during peak hours and the high demand for a table. It's good, but the lines just give it a sense of over-hype. It's not bad by any stretch of the imagination, of course. The food is well-seasoned, never too saucy or too dry. Most people, myself included, come for the dried fried chicken wings, which are always a staple on everyone's table. The combination of spicy, sweet and tangy do the trick every time. Rumor has it the secret is a combination of hot chili sauce and honey, but whatever it is, I'm a fan. Outside of this, I enjoy their dried black bean noodles, (zhajiangmian) and their dumplings are pretty good. But it's the wings that make this place a must-go. Their garlic chicken is pretty well done and it has a zeal to it that you just don't get at your other Chinese restaurants. The sauce isn't overwhelming, but it's a good complement to the ingredients. Their potstickers are not good, however. They deep fry the whole thing, instead of just pan frying the bottom parts. I did not like them the last couple times I ordered this dish and will probably stay away in the future. In addition, last time I visited with a party of 5, they added gratuity to the bill. First of all, standard practice is 6 or more and a restaurant will add the tip to the bill. Second of all, you mention that on your menu. Our table's opinion was that they knew they were going to get a low tip and made up some bullshit about it to include tip on the check. (They did very little in terms of service and checking in on us.) We argued and got our way. Watch out for that if you come with 5 or 6 people and get lower-quality service.

You know... I really didn't want write this and give it a bad review but in the two years or so I feel like the quality and taste of the food here has gone downhill. A once well-loved and often frequented local Chinese restaurant turned tourist/money trap (seriously it was 80% tourists earlier today). Let the hating begin!!! Everyone raves about the dry fried chicken wings. Yes, true... back in the day we used to come here and eat the wings by the plate fulls. Anyone else noticed how the wings have gotten smaller and the dish way overpriced? Anyway... I hadn't had the wings in awhile but today.... OMG COMPLETE DISAPPOINTMENT!!!! I read some recent reviews about the wings being too sweet and YES... wayyy sweet. They coat the wings in sugar and I guess because they are SOOOO busy making hundreds of orders a day, they can't wait for the sugar to melt or caramelize before serving it. The wings were crunchy, but not because of the deep fry... but because the sugar was still sugary!! This also used to be my fave place to get hot and sour soup. Today's soup was neither hot nor sour. Just a lil salty and starchy. But I was truly DISGUSTED by the shrimp in the soup. You can tell they used "old" shrimp... it was shriveled and dried up and tasted of chemicals. It had a bleach/pine sol taste. We took all the shrimp out of the soup as to not contaminate it further. (For really good hot and sour soup I would recommend Peking Restaurant on Noriega or Old Mandarin Islamic on Vicente.) Next we had this dish with sliced dried tofu, shredded pork and green and red peppers. When it came out it looked like a pile of brown leftovers covered by brown sauce. I was like "WHAT THE HECK IS THIS? FOOD?!" I was surprised at the crudeness with which the tofu and meat was cut. If you have had this dish before, the tofu and pork and sliced thinly and delicately. OH no... not today. Today it looked like it was cut by an ogre with a blunt ax. Some of the tofu and meat were in huge chunks and blocks while other pieces were thinly sliced and teeny tiny. Maybe it was leftovers.... (ugh) String beans... another old fave. Recipe and method of cooking now changed. Don't get it if you've had it in the past! They changed the sauce to a sugary sweet sauce and its no longer as tasty. It basically is cooked in the same sauce as the wings. When we asked the server what happened, he even said they changed the sauce. Boo!! (Strings beans at Old Mandarin Islamic are really good though!!) Black bean sauce noodles.... I never liked it here because the sauce is SUPER oily. But I also don't like that it tastes so "seafood-ey". It has something to do with the seafood they use... it is not fresh. For a restaurant so busy I am surprised they use such poor ingredients. Anyway, I now post this two star review. Hopefully it won't get deleted or pushed to the bottom of the pile. Sorry San Tung. I don't think I will return... But good for you.. you still got lines out the door so you must be doing something right. PS I was gonna give this review just one star but it got a +1 because I did like this place a lot in the past. (This is also the reason I decided not to call the health department about my concern for the bleached seafood. Cleaning agents are often used to mask the fact the seafood is old and going bad.)

CHICKEN WINGS. thats all you need to know. its the best and every time i bring ppl here they are hooked with the first bite of that chicken! its a must and its 4 ppl eating..we have to order 2 orders! lol. we some hefs! i like their string beans because its sweet and flavorful! and crispy! i hate when its really soft. i like their spicy peanut seafood noodles and their pot stickers which are HUGE. black bean noodles are better at SO. the wait is ridiculous! but so worth it..they are so cramped which they would expand their restaurant. if ur hungry enough, and dont want to wait..ask for a shared table then its more a shorter wait cuz alot of times ppl dont like that cuz they want they privacy but who cares since its small and you are in close quarters already inside. lol

ZOMFG!!! this place has awesome fried chicken!!! If you have had korean flavored fried chicken such as Bon Chon or Kyo Chon, you know sort of what to expect. it's not breaded much, if at all, and covered in delicious sweet garlicky goodness :) If you haven't had these types of chicken before, I strongly rec it! Also note worthy was the peanut noodles. It was something that I don't think you can get anywhere else and was also really good, it was a nice creamy sauce, a little on the sweet side, with the noodles that come in jja jjang mien. The string beans were also very good, but added to the wings, and the peanut noodles, the food ended up being a little too much on the sweet side. Just make sure you end up getting something a little saltier or sour to balance out the sweetness of the chicken.

Chicken Wings! Chicken Wings! Gota try the dry fried chicken wings. Even my friend who's not much of a chicken wing fan loved their dry fried chicken wings so definitely try those if you haven't already. The dumplings were pretty good too, the wrap is thin which I like. Parking is really really hard to find though and there's usually a wait, so go there a bit earlier. At least the long wait will give you more of an appetite to eat more.

If you are from So Cal, this place is not for you. The dry fried chicken was good I must say but thats it! ?This place is a Korean style Chinese place. ?more than half the items on the menu are in Korean however no one here speaks Korean... Odd... We had the standard Dry fried shrimp (yuck), shrimp fried rice (edible), Dry Fried Chicken (good), Spicy Seafood noodle "Cham pong" (terrible), Sizzling rice soup (how can you mess this up??), Green Onion beef (ok), and Spicy shredded pork (it was more chestnuts than pork but the sauce was ok). ?Service was the standard suck ass service you usually get at Asian places so no biggie, Super crowded so I'm guessing people really like the fried chicken here. ?Parking sucks but hey, it's SF. ?Call ahead for large parties.

Another plate of their Chicken Wings - DRY STYLE. Another bowl of their Black Bean Noodles. Another round of great San Tung eating. This time we got to sit in the middle. Yay for not being in front, where all the waiting-patrons just sorta stare at you. Kinda creepy, unless you're into that thing. I'm not. Perhaps they could make a trellis up to the ceiling with some plant-thingy. Wouldn't cost much. Just a suggestion.

Fact: every Asian person I know in SF has raved about San Tung. Okay, maybe that's an exaggeration - the every Asian person I know, part. The raving part isn't, because San Tung is that good. It's so good and so popular, that often times you have to strategize on how to get there, find parking, and get seated before it fills up. I've eaten various dumplings from here, but the dried fried wings and the black bean noodles are supreme. Seriously, the wings are winners. I won't wax poetic about the food since it's been said many, many times before but I will add this - San Tung also deserves 5 stars for it's service. Just last night the bf and I were waiting for our pick up order and we were chatting with the staff. Everyone is polite, they actually smile, and they're appreciative of your business. Practically unheard of at Asian restaurants. If you can't get to the Sunset easily, go to their sister restaurant SO on Bryant St (across from the Bed, Bath & Beyond/Trader Joes shopping center).

I came here on a Friday during the Lenten season and almost forgot that it was no-meat day. ?Well, sadly, I remembered last minute so I ordered the dry fried calamari while the rest of my family got the regular wings. ?But OH. EM. GEE. the calamari was OFF THE CHAIN AMAZING! ?It stayed crispy sitting on the plate as we were eating just like the wings and the meat just holds up amazingly well. ?The contrast ?of the crispy texture with it's dense yet tender meat just pairs so well.... It's almost on par with the wings! ? Then I thought, anything dry fried with their yummo sauce would be delicious but I was wrong. ?We also ordered the dry fried shrimp but that was not so great--it got soggy way too fast. ?Never again. We also ordered an item that I now get on the regular basis which is the combination fried rice--so flavorful! ?It totally has this "wok" flavor adhered to every single perfectly oil-coated grain of rice! ?I'd ask for no mussels though and maybe add more shrimp instead. ?The mussels that come in it are fishy yet flavorless and are tough and chewy. Another new item I tried recently is the DICED dry fried chicken. ?I loved the idea that I could eat this entirely with chopsticks and not dirty my hands--everyone who knows me knows I hate to eat with my hands. ?However, I found the chicken a tad bit on the dry side so much so that I'd rather get my hands dirty despite my OCD and stick with the wings from now on OR I can go with my new obsession, the calamari!

My family and I have been coming here since San Tung's original location was on 25th and Judah, but they didn't move very far. This family owned restaurent (now run by their sons) have definitely put the restaurant on the map, as they were recently named one of the best Chinese restaurants in America by CNN Go (Link: http://www.cnngo.com/exp…). I have never been disappointed in any of my meals here, whether it is for their lunch specials, or for family style dinner. Everything on the menu here is good, but I highly recommend the following: -Pork Dumplings -Five Spice Beef Soup Noodle (noodles are homemade and always chewy) -Dry Fried Chicken Wings -String Beans -Fried Rice -Mu Shu I know nothing above is exotic or out of the ordinary, but these are my favorites on their menu. If you do come here for dinner, be sure to get here early to put your name on the waiting list. Bring your friends, your family, or even a date; San Tung will not disappoint.

Not that I didn't expect good wings but come on, the best wings in the city of SF? Well I haven't tried every single wing joint in the city but I've never eaten wings this good. EVER.

THE BEST WINGS IN SF. No lie. I've tried these in the restaurant as well as a take home order. They were still good even after 4 hours. My taste buds pretty much died and went to heaven. The wait for the restaurant itself is kinda of crazy. My group of 5 went on a Thursday night at 5pm and we still had to wait about 30 minutes for a table. The parking around this area is also insane (as usual). The wait was definitely worth it. We had 2 orders of dry-fried wings (w/ and w/o bones), the green beans, and fried rice. They were all so delicious that I couldn't even differentiate which tasted better. I would definitely come here again.

Popped in here just to try their wings. Totally worth it. I'd recommend sharing with someone because you get a dozen wings with your order and the delicious honey glaze gets to be quite filling.

BEST. CHINESE. FOOD. PERIOD. I love traditional Chinese dining. No, I'm not talking about ordering some Kung Pao Chicken or Beef and Broccoli from a Panda Express. I'm talking about having a loud and noisy dinner with your family, friends, and loved ones at a good restaurant with a revolving table, pouring hot tea for your elders, and sharing countless savory dishes together. We don't need the fancy wine, the dim lit decor, formal wear, or a quiet cricket cherp atmosphere, it's simply all about family togetherness: that's why it's called family-style for a reason! Complimentary Kimchi - http://www.yelp.com/user… As well with a pot of hot brewed chrysanthemum tea, they give you a plate of kimchi off the bat. Despite being a Chinese restaurant serving kimchi, it was a tad dry, but damn was it spicy, and hey, who doesn't love kimchi? Hot and Sour Soup - http://www.yelp.com/user… Amazing! The best Hot and Sour soup I have ever had. Usually I don't order this because in the past, some restaurants either make it way too sour or just plain bland, but this right here won me over! The hot hearty soup was LOADED with bamboo shoots, mushrooms, tofu, really shrimp, green peas, and plenty of egg drops (see picture). I didn't even have to reach for the pepper shaker like I usual do at other restaurants to spice it up. It was absolutely perfect and a great way to begin our meal. Dry Fried Chicken Wings - http://www.yelp.com/user… The star dish of San Tung. Succulent ?juicy plump chicken wings lightly fried to perfection smothered in a very tangy and sweet sauce. Words can't describe, you'll just have to try em! BA-OMBB! Szechuan Tea Smoked Duck - http://www.yelp.com/user… A nostalgic favorite! I've been to numerous Chinese banquets when I was young and this specific dish brings back all the times I shared happily fighting over who gets the last steam bun, with my family. Perfectly cooked crispy half duck, fluffy soft steamed buns, hoisin dipping sauce and fresh leaks -- it doesn't get more authentic than this. The smoked duck wasn't oily, the steamed buns weren't soggy wet on the bottom, which indicates freshness, topped with hoisin and combined all together; you get yourself an amazing little roast duck bao that you've created yourself. When it comes to Chinese food, I am hard to impress. I've been eating it for over two decades after all, so my standards are high and especially if I'm going to be paying for it, it better be mind blowing. Was I mind blow? OMG Yes. Each dish hit dead center, and then some. From starting with the amazing soup and surprisingly good kimchi, to their famous wings, and ending with the very traditional and nostalgic smoked duck buns. Man.. I don't even know how the Chinese restaurant across the street stays in business when San Tung is killin' it with all this great authentic food. San Tung, I'll be back!

4 stars for the dry fried chicken wings! However, the rest of what I had over the weekend was just ok. We ordered- -Pork Dumplings (12 dumplings filled w/ ground pork and Napa cabbage $6.75): The dumpling skin was nice and thin, but the meat filling was just ok. They forgot the garlic soy dipping sauce, which would have made it taste a lot better. -Cold Noodles (In a peanut sauce topped w/ five spice beef, dried bean curd, shrimp, and julienned cucumbers $9.00): The noodles were good, but I thought the peanut sauce needed a little more salt. -Eggplant Dish: My least favorite dish of the bunch- the eggplant sauce was very bland, and they removed most of the skin, so the dish was extra mushy. Dry fried chicken wings were awesome as always! Before I think they would give you the fried chicken and the sauce on the side, but now it's already pre-mixed. I would definitely vote for getting to-go from here so you don't have to wait half an hour for a table! Parking in this area can also suck.

HANDS DOWN - THE BEST CHICKEN WINGS EVER = 4 Stars!!! The negative feedback that I have is, the place seems a little small which makes it crowded especially with the wait. Also, the line to get your reservation goes out the door (I don't blame them, food is great) - Although, I don't mind waiting -- IT'S WORTH IT!! I do think that its better to dine in vs ordering for take out because they give you more in serving. ? I'm hoping that sometime in the near future, they will offer Delivery Service!! =) ?San Tung Chicken Wings are Perfect for Parties!!!

I frequent this area a lot and this place ALWAYS has people waiting outside for a table. I've always heard how bomb the "wings" were at this place. So a friend and I decided to check out these wings. Now I know why people line up outside... The special wings they have are pretty amazing. They're sweet and slightly spicy (but not as spicy as their kimchi) and heavenly. I think they have honey in the sauce so you must eat them while they're hot or they're not as tasty. We also had the cold plate, something I always enjoy eating. The jellyfish was delicious but could use less mustard sauce, the cold slices of beef were amazing, and so were the eggs. Some of the other dishes were solid even though I can't remember them because the wings were so bomb.

Dry Chicken Wings. Enough said. Not to be outdone, but San Tung's wings greatly outshine anything on the menu. The first time I ate here the line was out the door (the normal sight outside), so expect the wait. But as they say good things come to those who wait. Oops, I meant GREAT. I looked at every single table and without fail every one had an order or two of these delectable wings. The wings were perfectly fried not dry or over sauced. The wing is the perfect balance of a salty fried chicken wing with some great spice. *Tip- The regular wing is okay, but order the Spicy trust me. I have sweet dreams that visit me at night of little wings floating in my belly. Worth the ?visit every time.

Its been years since I've eaten here, but after running some errands in San Fran I took the opportunity to grab some take out. ?I would go to this place for one thing and one thing only - DRY FRIED CHICKEN WINGS. In the industry where I work, we use the term, "Unsurpassed" rather than "Best" or "Better than the Rest." ?San Tung's wings in my opinion are unsurpassed, and I have yet to find anyone else matching them in texture and flavor. ?How to describe them? ?The Dry-Fried versions look closer to glazed BBQ chicken wings as opposed to breaded fried chicken. Biting into one of these and you get this surge of heat from red chili's, but then you also get this taste of sweet honey-like burst too that neutralizes it? ?The meat is perfectly cooked too. ?I'm wondering what other secret ingredients are in the spice rub because these are addictive! ? I bought two orders for take out, drove from the Sunset District back home in 1-1.5 hr traffic jam and I simply didn't care. ?I had some serious good eating looking forward to to share with the missus and the constant aroma of the wings permeating inside my car kept me smiling all the way through. ?Got home, waited a few hours for wife to return, and then attacked the wings. ?Were they cold and soggy by then? ?Nope, still warm enough and unsurpassed in flavor.

People seem to be under the impression that San Tung is an authentic Chinese restaurant. While the wait staff mainly speaks some form of Mandarin, the menus are filled with Chinese characters, and the restaurant does serve up a delectable selection of (American) Chinese favorites, this place is by no means authentically Chinese. First off, San Tung's signature dish, the Original Dried Chicken (Ganpengji, or Korean "Gganpoongi") is not a dish ubiquitous to the sinitic mainland. Ganpengji, in fact, isn't even ubiquitous to the providence of Shan Dong, the restaurant's namesake; the only place in China you'll actually find Ganpengji as a local favorite is in various cities of Guangdong province, and remote areas of Shanghai. The only dish which comes even remotely close to Ganpengji that is commonly found in the mainland is Lashaoji, (Spicy Chicken) ?although it isn't cooked "dry" like Ganpengji. Next we have the Zhajiangmian (Black Bean Noodles, or Korean "Jjajangmyun"). I've tried three different styles of Zhajiangmian at three distinctively different sinitic locales, all of which San Tung deviates from. The most famous style of Zhajiangmian is served in the Forbidden City, amicably known as the "Old Beijing Style Zhajiangmian" (Lao Beijing Zhajiangmian). This style of Zhajiangmian usually comes in the form of a bowl of noodles with a small amount of thick but concentrated oily ground pork and chopped onions fried with black bean paste in the middle, which the customer usually mixes well with the noodles to distribute the otherwise super oily and super salty paste. The second style and most savory version of Zhajiangmian I've encountered in the Sinitic lands is the Taiwanese style, where the "sauce" is composed mostly of black bean and has a more sweet but mellow flavor. The last and the least delectable style of Zhajiangmian one should ever try is served in the Northeastern Provinces, where the ?Noodles are immersed in an extremely diluted black bean soup (yes, soup!), providing for an all-around bland and extremely unpleasant culinary experience. The type of flour mix they use here for the steamed/boiled pork dumplings (Shui jiao) here are also inconsistent with the more Sinitic schools of dumpling skins; the dumplings also lacked a distinct flavor, which is usually not the case with Chinese pork dumplings which tend to be juicier and flavorful even without the addition of soy sauce and vinegar. And now on to the more subjective parts of matter. I came here with a friend around 1310 on a Monday afternoon. When I arrived, I was promptly placed on a waiting list, and seated about 15 minutes after my name was scribbled onto a dry-erase board on the left side of the door. As per Yelp's recommendations, we ordered both the "dry" and "wet" dried chicken, the black bean noodles, and the dumplings. The "dry" dried came out within five minutes of our order, just about the time we noticed the subtitle on the window outside that read "shui jiao da wang" (King of Steamed/Boiled Dumplings) at which point we were reassuring ourselves that we had made the right choice by ordering dumplings. By this time, I was also reaffirming my aforementioned suspicions--"Chinese" restaurants never tend to have Korean supplemented in their menus; how the interior looks similar to a certain "San Wang" restaurant whose owner I had the pleasure of conversing with in Korean about six years ago, and etc. The dry dried chicken was disappointing, but in an expected fashion. It was flavorful and dry on the outside and moist on the inside like it should be, but it wasn't anything special and I didn't really taste any hint of spiciness in neither the crispy skin nor the moist center. We did concede that this may be the best we've had in the city of San Francisco, but that we've had much better in its satelliting neighborhoods, such as 99 Chicken in ECR, Bonchon in Sunnyvale or Kyochon Chicken in LA. We experienced a similar disappointment when our wet dried chicken arrived, this time with the added inconvenience of getting the sticky wet sauce all over our fingers, which made it extra hard to grab my camera-phone and instadouche my meal. The San Xian Zhajiangmian was also good, but not great. The noodles were cooked appropriately, there was an appropriate amount of flavor in the black bean paste, with little bits and pieces of squid and shrimp mixed in here and there. But again, I've had a lot better from other "Zhajiangmian restaurants" such as Yetnal Jjajang on Telegraph, Tong Soon Garden and Zazang in ECR, and so forth. ? So back to the big picture, San Tung is a decent Korean-style Chinese restaurant, but it certainly doesn't outshine or come even close to any of the ubiquitous home delivery Jjajangmyun restaurants that plague every corner of every South Korean city, or their adaptations stateside. San Tung is certainly A-OK for SF, but the possibilities are endless if you're seeking something more authentic.

The "dry fry chicken" will make you wanna slap yo mama!!! The wait is loooong if you go after 7 pm, especially on the weekends, but its worth it. Service is so so, not bad, not good. Other dishes are good too, I love the garlic spinach, the vegetarian chow mien, and chicken mu shu. The location is cute (bars, restaurants, clothing and shoe shopping), parking sucks, but again, the "dry fry chicken" will make you wanna slap yo mama! ... careful though, you'll probably get slapped back!

I'm sorry San Tung, you were amazing, and your dry fried chicken will surely haunt my dreams tonight, but I had to knock off a star for your less than stellar service and the fact that none of the people who work for you seem to care about the fact that they provide this subpar service. Yes, there was a wait, but that was to be expected, so I don't begrudge you that, but even after being seated, it took us forever to flag down a waiter, who told us to wait for someone else, and then bustled away and forgot about us. After being seated for nearly 15 minutes, we finallyyyy managed to get our orders taken. Most of the food arrived pretty quickly after that... EXCEPT our chicken wings! We were finished with everything else we had ordered (including the diced dry fried chicken) before the wings arrived. That being said, the dry fried chicken (diced or wings) is sooo delicious. It's all in the sauce-- it's kind of sweet (honey maybe?), but spicy (peppers), and definitely has a hint of Chinese pepper. I don't know what else is in it, but the sauce makes the dish. Not sure why they call it "dry" fried chicken, but it's just the perfect amount of crispy. The hot braised flounder fillet was likewise, very good, and the braised tofu was pretty standard, but if you don't get something related to the chicken here, then you're totally missing out. While you're waiting outside, check out Next Door Sweets-- owned by the same people as San Tung, so they get to take your money twice. tl;dr: I can't believe it's just chicken! Get it. Otherwise, be prepared to regret your poor decision making and question why you didn't decide to listen to all the Yelp reviews that are raving about it.

---------DINNER ONLY-------- SO GOOD. This place totally lives up to the hype. Came here on a Tuesday for my dear friend's birthday. Had our entire party showed up on time, we would have only waited 5 minutes. I know this place gets hype for the fried chicken (which was good) but seriously, EVERYTHING we ordered was delicious. Even the most simple dishes like vegetable dumplings were made really well. That's what earns this place 5 stars in my book. Few things to note: -You will not be seated unless your entire party is there. Make sure everyone's there! -Everything is so good so you better come with an empty stomach. -For those who frequent Chinese restaurants, there's nothing mindblowing about this place but everything is just made so well so that's what makes this place awesome Sizzling Rice Soup - Great way to start off the meal for a big group. Warm with crunchy texture from the rice yet light enough so it doesn't leave you full Vegetable Dumplings - Seriously, such a simple dish but it tasted so good. So light, not totally oily and it was awesome. Garlic String Beans - Has a slightly sweet flavor to it but DELICIOUS Mushu Wrap - This was super savory! Has a slight sweetness to it. Definitely was tastier than it looked and SO good Dried Fried Chicken - What seemed like hours later, the infamous chicken finally came out and it lived up to the hype. Crispy, slightly sweet, savory, every single word you can think to describe it. My only complaint? There weren't enough pieces to feed a group of 7 so we definitely should have ordered more :( Anyway, YUM. I would happily come back and add this to my list of "places I must bring friends to"

There's a reason why this place is so popular. Chicken wings. Just try them, and you'll be bound to come back another time. Cons - potstickers and dumplings weren't as good as I expected, and the waiters just never see you when you wave your hand... If you're taking out some non-chinese friends for a good place to eat and try new chinese food, definitely come here! don't come here with your traditional chinese grandparents though, they'll find something to dislike about it.

All menus are Korean described as well as chinese. There were not many people outside, but around 2pm it was huge line waiting people outside. We ordered dry fried checken yesterday it was awesome.

Always a very satisfying excursion, made all the more so this round by rockstar parking and a surprisingly short wait for our group, which even got into the coveted back room! Must-haves: Dry Fried Chicken Wings AND Diced - Yes, we ordered and enjoyed both styles of the same preparation. Some of us like the wings more, others the diced. I appreciate them both, and while it's great not to have to fight the bones, I still give a slight edge to the wings. But would order both in a pinch, even if I were alone. Dry Black Bean Sauce Noodles AND Black Bean Sauce Noodles - I believe the latter is the more classic and I preferred it, even if there didn't seem to be much difference between the two. Good staples: Sizzling Rice Soup Dried Sauteed Green Beans Would not order again: Shrimp with Lobster Sauce Garlic Flavored Eggplant

San Tung already has a ton of reviews, and the other reviewers really capture it. ?But I'm reviewing it now for one reason: ?So that I can add it to a few of my own lists! ? I've been enjoying their Hot & Sour soup for a few years now, and have been telling my peeps that it's the closest I've found to our (long-closed) old favorite Golden City's recipe. ?Perfectly balanced, rich with chicken and pork broth, shrimps, mushrooms, bean curd, egg flower, bamboo shoots, scallions. ? Also try: ?Dry fried chicken. ?Excellent. ?I get it boneless, but notice that a lot of other diners get the same thing as wings, and it always looks good. ? They hand-make their wrappers for Mu Shu, and they are rubbery and yummy. ? I also like their green beans -- so fresh and tender. ? I'm not a pot-sticker fan, but if I were, I'd say these are near the top. ?(Wok Shop still has the very best!) ? Parking's a real sunnavabitch in this section of Irving. ?And when you arrive, jot your name on the dry-erase board and be ready to wait a few minutes. ?The waiters are all great, and will get you seated in no time.

HAS THE WORLD GONE CRAZY?!?!?!?! WHY--- Please tell me... WHY are you giving this place good reviews? Why is this the most highly reviewed chinese restuarant in SF?!?!?! WAKE UP San Francisco I swear this place bribes it's reviews or something, because it is overpriced but most of all TERRIBLE Chiense food. San Tung is CRAP--- plane and simple-- . I've been here three times--- each time I was terribly dissapointed but somehow luered myself back because it is always crowded & gets good reviews so I convinced myself that I must be missing something. ? This last time I went was the LAST straw. I'd expect better Chinese food off the freeway in Kentucky, yet this is #1 rated place in SAN FRANCSICO!? ?The chicken is NOT chicken... it's assorted parts and does not resemble chicken meat at all. It's a pile of grissle, fat, cartiledge, and looks like rat meat. ?How can they pass this off for chicken? Kung Pao was a pile of fattening greasy gravy & string bean shrimp had these frozen shrimp that were chewy and hard, broccoli beef was OK but still was very average. This place has no redeeming qualities.... it is overpriced and they cut corners in every direction. ?The quality of the meat is so bad I am going to let $30 of left overs go to waste because I can't bare the thought of making a meal out of it again. Good riddance Sun Tung.

Ordered: - Dry fried chicken wings - Shrimp and chive steamed dumplings - Crispy rice soup - Ja jiang mian noodles (Black bean) - Vegetarian mushu The chicken wings are amazing and won't let you down. It's always dangerous when you hear how good something is and then your expectations are high... but they are as good as everyone builds them up to be! The rest of the food is ranked in order in which we enjoyed them. I thought the dumplings and soup were quiet good but I just don't get why everyone loves the noodles. They''ll do... but they're not spectacular in any way. The sauce is a little bland and has too thick of a consistency. The noodles themselves were good but the sauce is just too distractingly bland to really make this dish stand out. My final gripe is the wait. We came on a Sunday night at 5:30, trying to beat the crowds and had to wait almost an hour for 3 people. I have no regrets but imo, too long of a wait to repeat. I love the chicken wings so much that I'm willing to look past some of the blandness ?and the waiting to give San Tung a 4. But next time, I'll head to So's in soma. Chicken wings are just as good and although the wait can also be horrendous, at least parking's easier to find!

I came here with my boyfriend during the lunch special hours. We ordered the wet chicken wings & Mongolian beef which included soup+rice. The soup came first which I didn't like at all. ?Then came the chicken wings, beef, and rice. They only gave us 6 chicken wings, and the price of it was $7 something I believe. There was barely any beef it was mostly veggies. I would only come back here if I'm craving for the wings otherwise it isn't worth my money. The service this time was a 8/10 since the other times I came here it was 4/10.

I LOVE this place solely for their dry-fried chicken wings. And since I look silly for just ordering chicken wings, I tend to order their peanut sauce noodles as well. Those are the 2 items you absolutely need to consume. I have no clue what's in those chicken wings, but their sauce is a perfect mixture of sweet and spicy. Furthermore, as a person who strives to live a pescetarian lifestyle, this place lures me back to my meat eating ways. I have frequent this joint multiple times. And the wait time is always a turn-off for me. But with trial and error, I have discovered the secret to getting seated quickly. No, it's not batting my eyelashes at the wait staff. But it's to show up with a big group. I went on a Saturday night ?with a party of 12, and my wait time was merely 15mins. The rest of the "suckers" around me, with their parties of 4, were wide-eyed with envy as my party strutted to our large table.

Anytime I hear the name "San Tung" I get excited and immediately follows are my taste buds watering. They have the best Hot and Sour Soup I have ever tasted! Very flavorful, one spoonful of that soup takes me away mentally. Warm, comforting and oh so tasteful. Believe the HYPE. The Dried Fried Chicken is the BOMB. Made crispy, savory, a touch of sweetness, and packs a lot of spice! I'm salivating as I continue to describe this piece of heaven! I recommenced to get the Diced and Wet version of it. It's easier to eat and even more flavorful. The Dried Fried Chicken is a MUST when dining here. Other must try recommendations are the Dried Fried Flounder, Dried Sauteed String Beans, Pot Stickers, and the Hot and Sour Soup. Cons: - This place does get really busy during lunch and dinner time. They have you write your name and your party number on a white board. Be sure to pay attention for they quickly move along their list if you don't hear them.

I looked forward to coming here after hearing all the rad reviews, but I was sorely disappointed. I generally don't mind lines or crowds as long as the food and service is great, but such was not the case. While we were seated almost immediately (we came around the start of the dinner rush), we did not receive our orders until nearly 40 minutes later. Huh. Now after looking at the reviews, we decided to order the famous chicken wings, black bean noodles, steamed veggie dumplings, and two other vegetarian dishes (we had a vegetarian in our group). The food: Chicken wings--I don't know if we ordered the wrong kind, but my family collectively agreed that these were mediocre at best. These are drizzled with an overwhelmingly thick sweet sauce...but I suppose everyone but my family enjoys it like that since everyone can't stop raving about it. Also, these wings aren't marinated, so there's not much flavor on the inside. Black bean noodles--A beauty on the outside, but this dish has absolutely no flavor, surprisingly. You'd expect such a thick, hearty looking sauce with thick cuts of meat to be brimming with flavor, but no, not at all. A little salt and a spicy kick would've made this one acceptable. This dish was barely touched. Steamed veggie dumplings--I did enjoy this one. While the dumplings were huge, it was simply flavored with the taste of ginger and mushrooms. I still find it weird how big and loose they were though. Not your average dumpling. Two vegetarian dishes--I don't quite remember the names of the dishes, but these had good flavor. Very goopy and saucy though, which I suppose is very typical of restaurant Chinese food. The service: So no one really cares about the service, but seriously, it was pretty awful. We were served our first dish at 40 minutes, and two of orders were forgotten. We started at 5, ended at 7, with our last order coming in 1.5 hours after we sat. Not a good experience even if one were to like the food, no? Also, it's extremely irritating to have waiters constantly distracted by the line outside while taking your orders. Very rude. However, I do see why this restaurant would draw a lot of people in. The food, while not to my taste, does have its audience. Mediocre food, terrible service.

"San Tung" or Shandong cooking is a very different culinary experience from that of many SF restaurants out there, which predominantly feature Southern Chinese cooking. ?For those reviewers and diners that aren't aware -- Shandong is known, amongst other things, for its dumplings, use of grains (in noodles and breads since the climate isn't as great for growing rice), and cabbage (which is used for Shandong's own type of preserved, spiced vegetable, which many would term "kimchi.") ?All of these things resonate at San Tung, in a very home-cooked meal sort of way. IMHO, the best dishes include their dry fried chicken wings, homemade noodles that are used for the spicy seafood noodle soup as well as the zha jian mien, and their dumplings. ?A lot of the other dishes on the menu are typical things that Americanized-Chinese food eaters prefer--sizzling rice soup, mushu, etc, which aren't really Shandong staples. ?Though, San Tung does a nice job of preparing these items, too. ?By adding these dishes to the menu, San Tung has done an oustanding job of attracting a broader clientele base, that may not normally be attracted to Shandong food. ?Other northern Chinese restaurants haven't faired as well in gaining the mass popularity of San Tung, and remain lesser-known hole-in-the-wall joints, though their food may be just as good, if not better and more authentic. The fact that this place is overrated and misunderstood doesn't detract from the fact that it's a decent restaurant serving tasty food that acts as great gateway restaurant for other Northern Chinese cuisine.

Came here on a Sunday evening, against my better judgment I decided instead of my usual take-out food during finals, I thought it may be appropriate to sit down and eat like a normal person. ?I knew this place was popular, but I didn't know the wait was so ridics - even with reservations, we still had to wait about 30 minutes. ?Coupled with the long wait + the necessity of returning to the library where I sleep during finals, the food was still worth it. ? I let my friend do all the ordering because at that point I was 9 hours into studying that day and I was literally a robot who zoned out at the table. ?But when the food arrived I was quickly perked up. ?The dumplings, soup and the chicken wings are definite highlights. ? Service is quick after you're seated - but honestly, next time I rather do take out because the ambiance of the restaurant and the wait is just not going to work for me (with or without finals). ?Unless there's a wait for take-out too..........

After 4 years of living in the city I have FINALLY had San Tung! First thing ordered, the dry-fried chicken wings of course and man are they worth of all the praise. Now are they better than SO's...well I wouldn't say better just different. They are both the epitome of a good chicken wing and I'd be damn happy if I had a plate of either in front of me right now. What makes them so good? As all the other reviews note, they are served hot a f*#@, ridiculously crisp, and yet saucy...what the? It's one of those mysteries that I'll never solve. Although I could've just gorged myself on wings, my wife would have it, so we alos ordered some tofu and some noodles...pretty standard fare and on par with your favorite Chinese restaurant.

I met up with a friend here during my most recent trip to San Francisco. ?As soon as I stepped into the restaurant I knew it must be good. ?The place was a predominantly Asian clientele with tons of people waiting for tables. ?We went on a Thursday night at around 6:50 pm and ended up waiting until about 7:35 pm for a table for 3. When we sat down I flipped through the menu a bit until I realized that my friend knew exactly what she wanted to order for us before we had walked into the restaurant. ?She ordered: 1) Dry fried chicken wings, no bones 2) Pork and leek dumplings 3) Noodles in black bean sauce Came out to about $10 per person, pretty typical for a Chinese restaurant. ?From the other reviews, I'm sure I do not need to tell you how delicious it was. ?I know, I was thinking the same thing too - really? ?Chinese restaurant? ?Fried chicken? ?But really, Chinese or not, you can't come here and forgo ordering it. The service is not that good, but that's because there are so many people in this restaurant and all of the waitstaff are extremely flustered and don't have time to be polite or attentive. ?I'd definitely come back here for the food.

Yummm I've been here twice so far. The first time we came pretty late on a weekend and the wait list was pretty long and we decided we would just order togo and eat elsewhere. The second time, we came during off hours on a weekday and were able to get a table within 5 minutes. The chicken wings were awesome! I wouldn't over indulged in them since there's wayyyyy too much sugar in the sauce, but overall delicious. Their sauce isn't that unique, I've had it many times before at other restaurants, the difference is they add more sugar and it's on chicken instead of fish! This is definitely a place you should try out. Be cautioned that the wait for a seat might be pretty lengthy =]

Rain or shine, I normally order the same three dishes whenever I come here. ?Only because I've fallen in love with it so much that I refuse to try something new. ?Yeah, I'm a pretty committed girl, what can I say: [Good for 2-3 heifers or 4 average people] -Original Fried Chicken Wings, Dry: This is a MUST. ?You cannot eat here without ordering this unless you are a vegetarian. ?If not, people like me will JUDGE YOU and think you're like one of those people that NEVER knows how to order food. ?Like that one friend that most of us have who we love dearly but hate eating out with. ? Whenever I eat out with him/her and it's that person's turn to decide where to eat, he/she will take me to the tackiest food chain out there and when it's my turn to decide, they ALWAYS order the wrong dish that no one really orders and then complain about the restaurant the rest of the night. ?So yeah, long story short: if you like meat, you have to order this. ?Also, make sure to order it "dry", it tastes a lot better. -Seafood Combination Fried Rice: Only because I need my rice fix in order to eat my wings. ?I'm Filipino, I have to have rice with almost everything. ?If not, it would feel incomplete. ?Think of it as salad without the dressing...except, extremely more fattening. -Spicy Seafood Hand Pull Noodles: Sooo amazing. ?Yes, I know I know, I order mountains of carbs whenever I go here. ?But, It's worth the extra Zumba class at 24. ?The broth is on POINT and the seafood is mouth watering delicious. ?Most importantly, the noodles are very fresh and is very addicting. ?Warning: you'll probably end up having more than two bowls. +5 because the service is fast, the food is AMAZING, the price is reasonable, and parking is really easy here. ?Also, if you are a heifer dessert person like myself, there's a really good pie place, Peasant Pies, right next door. ?The vanilla pie is worth trying after this meal. ?(yes more carbs!!!)

Even though the service is terrible, I still give it 5 stars because the dry fried chicken is amazinggggggg. NOMMM. I prefer it to be diced, less work for me, but if you like wings, get the wings! The rest of the items on the menu are alright but the chicken definitely takes the spotlight. It would be a waste of a trip if you don't try the chicken. The menu has all the normal Chinese dishes (like honey walnut shrimp yum), so take your pick. There is definitely a wait, but you could make a reservation if you have at least 8 people. I think it's 8? I'd still show up early though. & parking can definitely offset your estimated time of arrival.

Wow, when did Chinese food become a hipster spot? A couple years ago I had a job that scheduled me to work on Sunday nights, thus forcing me to miss out on many family gatherings such as Mother's day, Father's day, birthdays, etc. And this restaurant was the go to restaurant for those celebrations. I finally made my way to San Tung for dinner the night before my birthday. NO WAIT! I'm glad we came at the time we did, because the line started piling up. Babe and I ordered the infamous chicken wings, peking duck, the sizzling rice soup and the kimchi fried rice. The sizzling rice soup was exciting to listen to and the kimchi fried rice was not bad. The peking duck was nice and tender with the soft, pillowy lotus buns.The best part of the meal was the chicken wings. Saucy and delicious, this is probably what makes San Tung the new hipster spot.

After my last visit, I need to give this review a bit of a facelift; I'm expanding upon it greatly. Starters, people who rated this place one and two stars are morons. Do not listen to them. The wings are very special, and it was agreed upon by my group at our table that there are perhaps equal wings on the face of the earth, but none superior. They're cooked to perfection, slightly crispy outside, soft inside, coated with some sort of teriyaki-tasting sauce. But they MUST BE EATEN WITHIN MINUTES OF CREATION FOR MAX ENJOYMENT. The veggie chow mien was fantastic. To my surprise, steamed pork dumplings were better than the fried chicken pot stickers. The aforementioned dumplings were quite excellent. I'm not a huge service nazi, but Tung's is not great. It takes them way too long, as in mid-meal after you ask, to drop water. And they forgot my delicious Coke until then as well. The food does come out hot though. There is a wait to be seated, but life can be a real bitch sometimes, so that is not factored into this review.

Chicken wings, chicken wings, chicken wings, chicken wings...and oh yeah, chicken wings! ?AMAZING!! The rest of the food here is not bad, but the chicken wings are enough for a 4 star review. ?Seriously. Get there early, the parking is horrendous and the wait is long. Get the chicken wings.

This place is the only place I'll eat chicken wings. I guess I should first say that I don't chicken wings. I like chicken but there's something about chicken wings that I just don't like. This place is amazing. Well, amazing for one thing, their dried chicken wings. I love their dried chicken wings. My brother has told me to try their noodles before since he says they're handmade but I've yet to order anything else. the dried chicken aren't really dry. They're crispy on the outside and juicy on the inside pieces of chicken covered in a sweet AND salty glaze. YUM. Be ready for a wait though and parking is a hassle.

You walk in and you see EVERY table has an order of the dry fried chicken wings. That's what they're famous for! The chicken wings are a must try. The skin is crispy and the sauce is delicious. Other items that I've tried are dry fried green beans, dumplings, black bean sauce, and shrimp fried rice. They were all good as well. The place gets crowded during lunch and dinner. So come early for lunch (like when they open) or the between hours of lunch and dinner.

This place has great dry fried chicken wings!!! They are crunchy on the outside and very moist and tender on the inside. The flavor is Killer, its a bit sweet, spicy and just damn good. The food in general is tasty, i've had the green beans, broccoli beef, fried rice. Everything is very traditional and good, but the go-to are the wings. Every time I have come, there has been a crazy line or some kind of wait because this place is so popular. I prefer to call ahead and order to-go...Chinese food is always good re-heated anyways, Lol. And the seating is meh...

Oh how I miss SF. Not because of the shopping and hipness and the memories, but because of the fricken bomb ass SAN TUNG CHICKEN WINGS! Man oh man, THESE THINGS ARE DELICIOUS! So, I used to come here everytime I visited the ex and his family and this was always a MUST VISIT when I came up. Beware: - Lines are sometimes ridiculously long and there's very little waiting area and if you're like me and hate the cold, BRING A JACKET because you'll have to stand outside.... - PARKING IS A NIGHTMARE! As with all places in the sunset area, good luck finding parking.. only street parking is available Things I've tried: Chicken Wings: DELICIOUS! SUPER CRISPY AND SUPER FLAVORFUL! The order comes with a bunch of them and yah they're messy to eat but completely worth it. I mean ok, ALL OF MY NORCAL FRIENDS AND I LIKE IT...that has to say something or Zha Jiang Mian: Basically noodles in a black bean sauce with beansprouts and ground pork. This is pretty good, it's just not my kind of thing. The ex loves this stuff and I have to admit it's really flavorful and better than some I've had in SoCal. Pretty good. Si Ji Dou or String Beans: one of my all time fave chinese dishes. Basically string beans stir fried with garlic and ground pork. Consistently good and delicious and flavorful. Overall, I really like this place. I mean I still crave it now...I guess it's time to go back up to NorCal!

I came across San Tung a couple of years ago and was never a big fan of Chinese cuisine until I experienced this restaurant. ?It is nestled in the busy area of the Inner Sunset and very easy to find. ?If you plan to eat here, good luck finding parking. ?It takes at least 30 mins to find parking nearby, best option the N-Muni. ? Food - They literally have the best potstickers and chicken wings (before my vegan days) in San Francisco, by far! ?If you're in the area, San Tung is the place to eat authentic Chinese cuisine! ?Bon Appetite!

It's close to 5 am in the morning here in Austin, TX and with all the Super Bowl talk going on this week, everyone is also talking about what to eat...dip, pizza, WINGS. When I hear that word, I am then taken back to a fond memory of this magnificent Chinese restaurant, somewhat secluded in a neighborhood, also known as San Tung. They should consider mounting a sign that says, "Home of the Most Badass Wings You Will Have In Your Life" because from the outside, it looks ordinary. My wife thought it was insane of me to suggest taking a 40 min bus ride for this, with an extra 20 min wait in line. But I had faith in my fellow Yelpers, even risking the trip to the doghouse. Walking out with 2 dozen dry wings, still scorching from underneath the boxes, we tactically used our napkins and chopsticks to get a taste. And after our burned tongues got used to the heat, the flavors of the dry wing hit us and we experienced awesomeness. Salty, sweet, crunchy, gooey, all at the same time. It's hard to describe, yet I can still taste it in my mouth after 8 months of San Tung abstinence. Moral of the story? Live in SF or have the money to visit often just to get enough of San Tung wings!

(3.5 STARS) Chicken wings! ?You see it on everyone's table. ?Crunchy with a not so sweet sticky sauce. I ate about 8 wings myself! (good thing I ordered 2 plates of it.) We also had fried shrimp, dumplings, fresh noodles with peanut sauce, and their green beans were also a favorites. Parking is next to none and service was below ok. We felt rushed when ordering and we had to keep asking for water. Very busy, but worth the wait. I will try their potstickers next time. It looked good and a lot of people were eating it. ?We will be back!

San Tung is THE spot for Korean-inspired Northern Chinese food. Despite having to journey to the Inner Sunset, like the Black Eye Peas I just can't get enough. The menu of a dozen pages is too long for my attention span and insatiable hunger, so I always get the same items again and again... and I'm always happy over and over. The dry fried chicken wings are incredible--crisp yet saucy, savory yet sweet, juicy, tender, oh-so-perfect. Hands down the best fried chicken I've eaten in SF. I could honestly devour the plate of 12 pieces by my calorie-lovin' self. The dry black bean sauce noodles are also noteworthy. The noodles are made in house fresh to order, and the chewy texture is just right. Despite that the sauce looks like a black pile on the noodles, they still shine--and it's not from the grease! Oh, and I love the complimentary kim chee. It's so addictive. I hope it doesn't contain MSG, but I'd still happily eat it if it did. Free and delicious things are rare during these hard times. Everyone seems to like the dumplings. They're not a big deal to me. They're decent and dirt cheap, but come on--after you've had the xiao long bao at Yank Sing or even Shanghai Dumpling King, you know that dumplings are not created equally. The soup ones are simply the best. I'd drive here every week if I had a car. Who knew wings could taste so wonderful?

????????? What? Why? Why does everybody, Yelpers or otherwise, love this place to pieces? I asked the server what kind of cuisine they serve and they said they were all Shangdong people. I told them I was from Jinan and was excited to try their food. My hometown in China is in Shangdong and it's hella close to Korea. I preemptively exclaimed to my fiance, "get ready for a taste of my hometown!" The first dish that came out was a complementary dish of Chinese kimchi. Super spicy, not so much fermented. It tasted good with a bowl of rice. Then came our potstickers, they were a pretty good start, the bottoms were delightfully burnt and they were huge and super juicy. It was like eating a big soup dumpling with a thick skin. Next, the server plopped the green beans and ja jiang mian (black bean sauce noodles) on the table. The beans were really sweet, that was the biggest flavor that shone through and they became hard to eat after a few bites. The ja jiang mian's sauce was pretty weak, diluted by too much cornstarch, there wasn't that distinct salty and slightly sweet fermented flavor that is usually associated with good ja jiang mian. Still at this point, we were holding out that the chicken wings would be amazing. When the wings arrived on the table, I eagerly bit into a crunchy one. Blargh, it was seriously too sweet, gross! I like the sweet and savory mix just as much as the next person but I don't like it when my meat tastes like dessert. After a cup of tea I was ready to try another wing just in case the first one was a fluke. Nope, it wasn't. I dipped my finger into the chicken sauce and tried it on its own, ugh, so saccharine it could be the syrup for a cola. ?If I wanted to eat this kind of chicken I would've just gotten the honey bbq chicken wings from KFC.

Every time I have friends from out of town visit me, I HAVE to bring them to San Tung! Especially if they appreciate some good chicken wings! My friends and I came here on a rainy Friday afternoon, the place was packed but there was one table available. We were the first group to show up so we thought we would be seated immediately but the waiter had us wait as he cleaned up the table. I'm not sure what happened but he ended up giving our table to a group that showed up after us. My friends and I were not pleased but nothing would stop us from getting some awesome chicken wings! As we were deciding what to order, we were given a small dish of kimchi and it was good! Nothing beats tasty snacks before your main meal! We ended up ordering shrimp with leek dumplings, beef tripe, shanghai style wet noodles and the dry deep fried chicken wings. All of the dishes were great! But our favorite dish was, of course, the wings! Our second favorite dish was the beef tripe! Mmm... All this reminiscing is making me crave for some San Tung right now! Get there early! Or you'll have to fight your way into the restaurant!

If you're an avid fan of chicken wings, then you should try San Tungs famous wings. ?But everything else here is just ok. I do admit, their Chicken Wings were delicious when I ate them... HOWEVER, I did have to wait 45 min for a table so by the time I had them I was starving. Out of the things we ordered, the few dishes that I can remember having were the chicken wings, shrimp dish, string beans, and dumplings. ?As I said, the Chicken wings were pretty tasty, but the shrimp dish and string beans tasted very similar and the dumplings were whatevers. ? ? The majority of their dishes are on the tasty (Salty) side, so if you don't eat too much white rice like me, then you'll find their dishes on the salty side. True, this is your typical Chinese joint - the service wasn't exceptional, but they were fast and they were competent. ?It's a bit of a tight squeeze if you go with a big party so do expect to be cozy. ?Parking is similar to a lot of other place in San Francisco - street parking and hard to find but not impossible. I'd come here again with friends, but I wouldn't be the one to request it.

Great Food, Bad Service. If you come in during their busy hours, feel free to grab the dry erase pen and write your name down (and party size) on the board. I wrote my info down, and a waiter came and asked if everyone was here. I said that we're still waiting for them, and he promptly said "That's a problem", turned his back and walked away. Wow. Anyways, food is great - though the quality seems to have slipped just a bit since a year or two ago. Still very good, but a bit of a rush job. As everyone else says, it's all about the dry fried chicken wings. It's a bit confusing since it's technically called "Dry Fried Chicken Wings (Wet)" - at least the ones I love. BTW, the waiter practically berated my friend who was ordering these, yelling at him about the difference between the styles and nearly getting into an argument. Then his wife switches to Mandarin and he's suddenly very polite. Highly suggested are the potstickers (huge, with crispy bottoms), black bean sauce noodles, and green beans. A lot of stuff here is sweet and spicy, very different from your typical Cantonese stuff in Chinatown. Anyways, if anyone from San Tung is reading this - your food is great, don't change that. But please teach your employees to treat your customers with a bit of courtesy, even when you're busy. That will earn you 5 stars in my book.

The original dry fried chicken (diced or wings) is what you should get here. ?As much as I like the version from SO Restaurant, I like these a bit more since you get drumsticks and not just wings (as you do at SO). ?The seasoning is also not as garlicky here. That being said, I prefer the black bean sauce noodles at SO (has a spicy kick to it). The potstickers were ok as was the sweet and sour soup. ?Really liked the green beans. Service is whatever but I don't think people frequent San Tung for its attentive waitstaff. Not open Wednesdays. ?Don't take reservations.

love this place! i'm all about the dry chicken wings. i don't even mind picking up the bad boys with my fingers and getting sauce all over my face. it's cool, because everyone else is having just as much of a foodgasm as you are. other items i'd recommend are the sauteed string beans and the potstickers. each potsticker is ?literally the size of my fist! delicious, cheap food that hits the spot every time. however, what i love most is being able to skip the line and secretly get these wings without having to wait for over an hour. the secret to skipping the long long line? go immediately next door to the "next door desserts" place. it's also owned by san tung, and you can sit there and order anything off the san tung menu and have it served to you there (with the exception of the mushu and the szechuan duck). GO DO IT!!! and cop a delicious ice cream while you're at it! ?but if i go there next time and see a packed dessert house in addition to a packed San Tung, i'm definitely going to have to take this review down! awww yeah.

THEIR CHICKEN WINGS! They are just PHENOMENAL. My mom wanted some dry fried chicken wings without the sauce, and the guy taking the order just shook his head and said "No sauce, no flavor". And the sauce is just SOOOO GOOOD. It's sweeter than I was used to, but it was a good balance of flavors. The skin was crunchy and the sauce was just a little bit sticky and it was a good texture as well. I got their spicy string beans, which were also sweet and not at all spicy, which I was kinda sad about, but it was really fresh and that made a huge difference. I'd definitely go back! :)

The #20 Fried Chicken (Dry) Lunch Special for $7.00 ($7.60 with tax) is ?amazing!! It comes with six wings--a mixture of mostly drumettes and wings--, white rice, and hot & sour soup. The Fried Chicken is bursting with flavor! The soup, however, was a little too peppery for my taste. The pepper completely over-powered the soup to the point where it was unappetizing. I would recommend asking for a few napkins because you are definitely going to need them! The service, on the other hand, was a disappointment. The servers I encountered came across as abrasive and unfriendly. Although their Fried Chicken was delicious, it isn't something I would order if I was starving.

A must visit place when i'm in N.CA. I'm not a fan of Chinese food, but I love San Tung!! I can eat their chicken wings and dry black bean sauce noodle. ** The noodle is cooked perfectly with the sauce and garnish with cucumber. It's a little bit oily, but it's Chinese food... shouldn't feel surprised. ** The wing is sweet and spicy. the combination of the crispy skin and uber tender meat is the perfect combination. I can finish the whole plate myself =p It's always croweded, but it's all worth it in the end.

2500+ reviews, what do I have to add that hasn't been said already? YES, the wings are bomb. Crispy, sweet, tangy, finger-linkin good. It's an addiction worth $10 for about 10 wings. If you don't like chicken, they have Fried Dry Beef (same flavors as the chicken wings, but in beef form). The chicken is better, but the beef is good just cus it has that same delicious sweet crispiness. DON'T get both the chicken and beef. Too much of the same flavor = food coma for days. Also, their combination fried rice is hella legit. Perfect flavor, not greasy. I loved it. But at the end of the day, it's all about their chicken wangs.

After reading the great reviews on here & it rated 4 stars, I decided that I just had to go here for dinner. You have to write your name on a dry erase board, there is no place to wait except 5 chairs at the front door. The place is so noisy, floors are dirty & waiters walk around with dirty aprons on. The service sucked, we had to ask if we could order after 15 minutes. The hot & sour soup was pretty good, the dumplings could be better, the ?sweet & sour pork was all fat, over cooked, & had an odd taste. We also had chicken & garlic sauce which was ok, & green beans with chicken, again just ok. I can't understand why it's so packed & what draws people to this place, maybe they made the same mistake as I did & read the reviews on here.

San Tung's dry fry wings are amazing. And they better be goddamn amazing since there's always a line and you have to put up with one of the most shitty service this side of the Soup Nazi. Seriously, these Asian cats could give a shit about their customers. I've been there so many times and they are rude beyond my expectations from an Chinese restaurant (note, I'm Asian and live on Clement Street) If Harold Camping wasn't a lying piece of crap and the apocalypse was going to happen, one of things I'd do is to walk down to San Tung and beat the living crap out of the rude servers at San Tung. But before I'd take my federally funded training of kicking ass and taking names later, I'd first steal about 1,000 dry fry chicken wings. These dry fry chicken wings are freaking amazing. I can't even explain to you how good they are so you should try it yourself. But before you try out their five star dry fry wings, be prepared for their one star service. Five star food + One star service + one star long line + one star shitty parking ?= 2 crappy dry fry chicken wings stars.

The dried fried chicken wings are amazingggggg! They are a MUST HAVE!! The sauce is sweet like honey but with chili peppers for a little kick. I'm in love!! My favorites are the potstickers, dried sautéed string beans, and the dry fried flounder fillet. My boyfriend always gets the spicy combination seafood soup which is delicious as well, but my tongue is always on fire. Sure there is always a line, but its so worth it.

Living in the inner sunset area for 4 years, San Tung is one of those consistent places where I can always count on for a good meal, always be prepared for a wait though, the ?most I've waited was around 30 min. Their focus is on northern China cuisine which is a lot of carbs, dumplings with different fillings, buns, and noodles. ?I love their pork and cabbage dumplings, I always feel like there isn't enough on the plate to go around. ?Their seafood ja jie mei is really delicious and don't let the black looking sauce turn you off. Dried Fried chicken, what can I say, is one the most delicious things I've ever tasted, and now that I moved away from the area, I realize how much I took those delicious chicken for granted. ?I prefer the wings/drumstick over the chicken bits, because I feel like I get more meat with the sauce, the chicken bits have more batter to meat ratio. I always get the sautéed string beans after all the fried goodness. Their service is similar to those of Chinese restaurants, they get the job done with no fluff. ?Although on good days, you may get the brothers in a good mood, and the liquor will start flowing, in Chinese teacups no less. ? You wouldn't think of San Tung as a place to drink, BUT I have left that place feeling both full and tipsy. ?The food they serve although traditional is also great bar food. ?The ambiance of the place is set up as a social gathering, with both young people and families alike. I miss you San Tung, you will always have a fond place in my heart.

Maybe a bit too sweet, I had to take breaks and eat other stuff to cleanse the ol palate. Also had a tofu dish and it was solid, so not just a place for wings (though you're a fool if you come here and don't order them). That said, there's a good 40 min wait ?even if you come early and it's loud and crowded and rushed and service is not great. But they take credit and there's actually a good amt of parking nearby :)

This place is awesome everything Ive had here was always great. Lunchtime is easy to get a table but if you come here at night be prepared to wait 30mins-1hr but it will be worth it. My favorite is the shrimp leek dumplings, You have to get the dried fried chicken as well as this is their signature dish. Ive also had the mongolian beef which was great and not too spicy and the shrimp with mixed veggies and black bean sauce was delicious as well. IMO Best chinese food in sf.

Delicious food made to order Original wings, hot and sour soup, rice and a soda is all i need. The best, and always satsifying. I suggest getting there early, if it's packed ordering for pick up is a great option :)

Just do yourself a favor and order the chicken wings. ?Once you start, you won't be able to stop. ?You'll crave them, daydream of them, and lick your fingers unconsciously. ?They're THAT good. Their black bean noodles and spicy seafood noodle soup are delicious as well. This place is bumping though! Be prepared to wait for a while. ?I'd suggest order to go, take those bad boys home and indulge.

Came in a party of 9 and got a table in 5 minutes around the 6pm mad dinner rush. This was the highlight of dinner. It was also the first time I saw a line for the men's bathroom. We ordered ~10 dishes dried fried chicken (2), happy family, sizzling rice soup, black bean noodle, dried fried beans, a tofu dish....but between every dish there was a waiting period. It gave me a chance to write this Yelp! review. The food was overall good, but the food needs to come a bit faster. The bill came out to be a little more than $120. We were there for about 1.5 hours. The large table next to us was there for probably a good 2 hours. San Tung must be doing something right if people are still piling out the door at 8pm.

Store Notice (pls see picture attached): SUN TUNG WILL BE CLOSED FOR 2 WEEKS FROM 9/12/12 - 9/26/12!!! ____ Now back to my review... With everything on the menu with an average cost of $9.50 for Chinese food + the terrible service + mini food/toilet flies by the walls you got to be kidding me! Surely their dried fried chicken wings are delish but they don't allow an order of just wings. They add in unwanted drumstick meat which I don't eat. This place is SO over-rated! You people must be nuts to wait over an hour in line. And you guys surely never had good "Chinese" food cause this is so catered towards the American taste buds of overly salty dishes. And what makes them categorized under Korean restaurant?! Trust me, these are not authentic Korean food.

A Chinese restaurant known for their chicken wings WTF! i wasn't even planing on ordering the chicken wings, but once i saw chicken wings on every single table i had to try them. Personally it was ALRIGHT! The chicken wings were super crunchy and the sauce was sweet. If it's your first time here, i suggest you order it to see what all the hypes about. But overall it's just your average Chinese restaurant that happens to serve chicken wings, and gives free kimchi appetizer haha The service is super fast here, the line for this place is crazy during dinner time, at least an hour wait so come early! Lunch time is not so much. Only street parking which is always annoying

"Psssssssssst. ?Want to know a secret? ?There's no wait at 7PM on a Thursday night when it rains. ?Just keep it between you and me, Yelp." Dry fried chicken was delicious, as expected - sweet and tangy and fried goodness. ? The boiled shrimp and leek dumplings were just ok - they're small in size and number and not that flavorful. ?Maybe I'm used to pork pairing with leek in dumplings, or maybe we should have gotten fried potstickers instead. ?The black bean noodles were pretty good - not overly salty from the black beans. ?The two vegetarian dishes were good. Overall, the service is slow, waits are long, and prices are a bit higher than other places due to popularity. ?For me, the dry fried chicken is the only dish worthy of making a special visit but not worth the usual wait.

My parents took me here very often when I was growing up. The server always remembered us too. I'm happy to see them doing so well! I've been back a couple times since I was a little girl, and I can appreciate the food so much more! I would stick with the basics - the fried chicken and dumplings. Everything else is so-so and not their specialty. The chicken is so good that I try to make it at home when I can't get out to the city. But of course it's not as good as the original!

Yes, the dry fried chicken is da-bomb: sticky, spicy, salty and delicious. But that's about it. People rave about it, but there's really not much that's authentic about its Chinese food. The Tea Duck had the correct flavor, but the duck was so shoddily prepared that the meat had visible bits of quill embedded in it (the thick white part of the feather). EEEEW! Hot & Sour soup was neither spicy nor sour, and it was off-putting to find those cheapo freezer bags of veggies (cubed carrots, peas & corn) in the soup. The potstickers, while very large, were not particularly yummy. And when we asked for ginger, as it is customary with potstickers, we were given a blob of chopped ginger bits -- from the kitchen for cooking - instead of the proper thinly-slivered slices. ? I serendipitously learned of this place from a San Francisco native whom I shared an umbrella with in Los Angeles and was so excited to try it during my recent visit. Sad to say, San Tung doesn't live up to expectations nor the hype. I will not return, especially not with the long wait even on a weekday.

Im glad to have stopped by here for our last night in San Francisco! ?Our friends took us here for a nice dinner. ?They could not stop talking about their dry fried chickenI wanted to see what the hype was about! ?And what I found out was that this chicken was Underhyped!! It should be hyped up even more! This was one of the best fried chicken that I have ever tasted! ?We ordered like 50 wings for the 4 of us. ?Next time I go back here, I will order 100 wings. ?50 for myself, and 50 for whoever is with me. The service was pretty quick too. ?We only waited 30 minutes which was short with the amount of people waiting outside. ?We got our food within 10 minutes. ?I also had fried rice with my meal. ?It was delicious! ?The chicken wings reminded me of bon chon, but much more sweeter and it has a lot more sauce on it. ?But the chicken was still juicy!

I have been to San Tung numerous times and I LOVE the food there. It's all about the dried fried chicken wings. I don't know what they put in their chicken wings, but it keeps me coming back. The sauce, the crunchiness, the tenderness, the flavor is SO good. Talking about it makes me want to eat another order... Anywho, the other dish I like to eat here is the mu shu pork. I love playing with my food and this is the perfect dish to do that. You get the bread thing and you put your hoison sauce & onion and the mu shu pork, wrap it up and eat it. I love how the sauce drips from the wrap onto your hands. As for service, it's a typical chinese restaurant. They treat you like crap at times or not, depends on the server. For the most part, if you know the language, it's always help to speak it. You usually get better service that way. What I don't like is the long line for prime lunch or dinner time. Lunch time isn't too bad, but during prime dinner time, be prepared to wait. When you get there, make sure you write your name on the dry erase board. If you don't like waiting like me, you can always order it to go and enjoy the tasty wings at home.

They have some of the best chicken wings around. So good, in fact, they were nicknamed chicken crack. The service is also great. Even though they are constantly busy and probably stressed out, they still are very patient and provide service with a smile. They are warm, hospitable people who know how to cook AWESOME chicken wings. It is a very popular restaurant so be prepared to wait a while. I would recommend a light snack before putting your name on the list and get there as early as you can for lunch or dinner.

Typical orders here: Potstickers: Huge. Green Beans: Garlicky and fresh. You can see the mountains of them being prepared between lunch and dinner times. DRY fried Chicken Wings (obviously): SO GOOD. and you can order half plates if one is too little and 2 is too much! Black Bean noodles: chewy homemade noodles! Best in SF, I'd say. Combination spicy broth noodles: (JJampong): Broth is so flavorful and delicious! I crave this as much as the chicken wings. In case you couldn't tell, i love this place. Food is not exactly 5 stars, but the service boosts it up.

i found out about the dry fried chicken wings via yelp, so i'm paying it forward to everyone else wondering what to order here: YES, GET THEM. everything else was delicious, although i could taste the MSG dancing on my tongue, bouncing around to the beat of my chewing, lol. The fried fish also had the same magical sweet/sour/savory/spicy flavorings/marinade as the dry fried chicken wings, so that is something they know they do well. tip: we called in advance, so no wait for a table.

The end of an era! ?San Tung used to be my favorite chinese restaurant in SF. ?my last three visits have changed my opinion. ?On 1-5-13 I thought I would try it one more time, hoping and praying that things had returned to the restaurant I used to love to end my trips to the city with. ?No such luck, in fact things have become worse. ?The lines I can handle, but our two appetizers came 10 minutes after our first entree arrived. ?The lemon chicken was just fried breading, the biggest piece of chicken was no bigger than a kernel of corn. ?The legendary chicken wings were dripping with a cheap sugary sauce and the service was even worse than before. ?The kicker was is was only 11:45 am and it looked like it had been days since they had cleaned the place. ?The restrooms were disgusting. ?Over all, it looks like they just don't care.

I'm going to keep this concise or better yet, SHORT and SWEET like the: SAN. TUNG. DRY. CHICKEN. WINGS. Need I say more? What else did you expect from this review? Generic, I know but if you really want to know what the hype is all about--its the wings. It's always hyphy up in here so either brace yourselves in the cold to wait 30+minutes or call for take out? Either way, totally worth it. Some people claim that Crazy Pepper's Korean chicken wings (Near Balboa Bart ST.) taste identical but I think they're wrong. Similar? Yes. Identical? Get a dictionary. San Tung's are close to irreplaceable. THINGS TO BRING: ~Jacket: Unless you like catching pneumonia, it's your funeral. The wait will be cold and long BUT worth it. ~Hand sanitizer: I highly doubt you want to step foot in their restroom, neither did I, so get on my level and bring some hand sanitizer--you will get down and freaky-naughty once the wings arrive. You'll bring acting primitive, back! ~Dry erase pen: Upon arrival, you must sign your name with the # of peeps in your party. Whenever stuff like that is left for the customer, all hell breaks loose.

*DRY vs. WET* Choosing between their dry and wet wings is like asking me to choose between Adriana Lima and Alessandra Ambrósio. The former is dark, sultry, and amazing looking wet (that was a bikini reference, nothing else!). Also, it tastes like it has a little more ginger. Anyway......... the latter dry version is blonder, lighter (on the batter), and ultimately takes the cake (or whatever VS models eat. Sidenote: Is butter a carb?)

Dry fried chicken wings and sweet&sour beef(red sauce) My boyfriend, friends, and I always order them every single time. Sometimes, my boyfriend and I come here for just those two things. They never fail. But the chicken is sometimes iffy. It just depends. Sometimes it's perfect, sometimes they accidentally drop an entire canister of pepper on it. It's still delicious, but if you frequent this place a lot (like me) you'll be able to tell. The wait during dinner time is incredible. Maybe 20minutes-1hour for a table. I guess it makes sense since their popularity skyrocketed. But I've been going here since way back when so it was kind of a shock to me because I'm used to the small restaurant where my family and I got together. You can never go wrong with take-out though!

Me and my friends were passing by and decided to check this place out. The line for the dining room was too long so we decided to get TOGO. TOGO took less then 3 minutes. Ate outside on the sidewalk while people waiting inline were eyeing our batch of sweet and spicy chicken wings. The wings were good, well developed flavor, juicy chicken, but it was a little too saucy for my taste(but thats because I don't like eating with my hands sometimes, but i ate the wings with chopsticks 8)...) I didn't eat anything else from there, but I enjoyed the wings and the pomp and circumstance that we caused whilst stuffing our faces outside of the restaurant. *note to self* bring folding chairs next time for a true sidewalk party!

Long awaited visit to this place after my friends were raving about it so long. I would have to say that the Chicken Wings were really good. They were hot and fresh, I was disappointed after they were all gone. I am sure that people have difference of opinions as everyone will about the taste of the food ?& claiming that this restaurant and that restaurant is better. For me this was a tasty delight for me friends and I. We were seated quickly, which was a good thing. We had a total of 4 or 5 dishes including the chicken wing which came to about $40 the portions were good, there were 3 people. ?Where I live this would have been at least $20 more. The only reason I gave this place a 4 star instead of 5 is because it took a while for them to take our order (but as busy as they are i can understand) and we had to ask for water. Other than that I am willing to go here just for the chicken wings, I am now addicted and am craving for a 2nd batch. As i said earlier in this post different tastes and opinions will always thrive when food is concerned. For me this was just dandy. Thumbs up for San Tung!!!!!

We didn't really try anything else, but our friends said the rest of the Chinese food here is just average. The WINGS however. The wings were amazing, definitely get the dry ones and maybe ask for more sauce if you want, because the wet ones are a little soggy (or at least not nearly as crispy). Great for lunch or a mid-afternoon snack!

Took the bf's momma out to eat. ?She always caters to ME and what I want to eat. ?Lol. ?She INSISTED on taking us to San Tung bc it's one of those "cater-to-Korean Chinese restaurants". ?But to our dismay, there was a HUGE wait of more than 12 names ahead of us on the list. ?The place was PACKED. ?We decided not to eat here.

This review is for their dry fried chicken wings.. I have tried other things on the menu, they are good but they arent on the same level as their wings... All I have to say is I have been coming here for 7 years now, and everytime me and my friends go, we always order the same exact thing... one plate of wings each share a pot of rice and call it a day... I have waited 1 and a half hours for the place, and its totally worth it. Advice: try to go sometime around 3 or 4 during their not so peak hours, as parking around dinner time gets so crazy on irving.

When I hear the word "San Tung", only a single image pops up: a platter of twelve delicious chicken wings drizzled in a spicy honey sauce that satisfies every single taste bud on your tongue. Dumplings? Chow mein? Sure, they were both on the menu, and I did order them... but as far as I'm concerned, San Tung's menu could just consist of one sheet of paper on it with four words in size 60pt Times New Roman font: "original dry fried chicken". Really, that's all you need to know about the place. In order to properly satisfy one's craving for these fantastic wings, the ratio of wings to consumer is, at the minimum, 6:1. After eating one, you won't be able to stop until you have at least half a dozen of them resting languidly in your stomach. Come before 5pm if you want to beat the crowd and avoid having 15+ tables listed on the whiteboard before you. People say that you are what you eat. Try San Tung's dry fried chicken, and you will be as close to perfection as you will ever be in your lifetime.

AIN'T NO THANG LIKE A SAN TUNG CHICKEN WANG. I'm probably not the first person to ever say that, but it's true. No one does WANGS like San Tung. If you look around the restaurant, every table has an order of the dry fried chicken wings. And for a reason. They are good. Really good. Like "drive out of your way and brave the difficult parking on Irving" good. The chicken wings are lightly battered and fried to the perfect crispness. If I stopped right here, I'd still give San Tung 5 stars because the chicken wing itself is perfection: perfectly crisp on the outside and tender and juicy inside. But it's the sauce that is out-of-this-world NOM NOM NOM. Whoever coined the phrase "NOM NOM NOM" had a mouthful of dry friend chicken wings in this sauce and couldn't express how delicious they were. I request the sauce on the side, so the chicken wings retain their crispness. The sauce is thick, sweet, slightly spicy and gooey. I don't know what's in here, but it's amazing. fantastic. outstanding. Truly finger-licking sticky goodness. I like to get a side of the dry sautéed green beans. Tossed with chinese pickles, this veggie dish makes me feel better mashing out on the chicken wings. The green beans are crisp and lightly tossed in a garlicky, sweet sauce. The dumplings here are also delicious and an excellent way to start off the meal. I've had the dry black bean sauce noodles and they were underwhelming. But the wings..the wings... just writing this review is making me crave them again.

Before I go to San Tung, I always deliberate whether or not I have the leisure to wait around 30min in line to eat. Everytime I've been there, a group of people are always huddled by the entrance. But let me tell you, it is worth the wait. This Chinese Korean restaurant offers some of the best of both cuisines in town. My personal favorites are the Five Spice Beef Noodle Soup and dry fried chicken wings and drumsticks. The noodle soup is cooked to perfection and the soup is not at all oily, and extremely flavorful. I usually like to keep to dining manners and not eat with my hands. But if you ever find me at San Tung, I will be the one with a wing and drumstick on each hand, and munching them down to the bones. They are just that good. If you've never been to San Tung definitely find the time to go there once. You will not be disappointed.

San Tung, I wish you weren't so far, because I'd frequent you so much more otherwise! The last time I came was over a year ago for a late 2pm lunch with a friend. Probably because of how late it was, we only had to suffer through a short ten minute wait. Going with the recommendations of fellow Yelpers, we went with the dry fried chicken wings, black bean noodles, and leek and pork dumplings. The chicken wings were absolutely delicious, while the other two were also quite tasty - the black bean noodles were a bit unique though, as they added a lot of various ingredients that I wasn't expecting (like seafood, if I recall). Yes, service is a bit shoddy, even for a Chinese restaurant, but it's still better than some that I've been to. For this food, I can deal.

When you have dreams about a restaurants food then you know it's good. This review is long over due. Actually had San Tung Chinese for our roommate gift exchange dinner last month. I've always heard about the dried fried chicken wings and green beans, so since we were picking up sushi in the same area & I didn't want sushi, we stopped by San Tung. I got the chicken wings, the green beans and my taste buds completely blown away! These things are dangerously good. I got 2 orders to share with the group and within 25 minutes, there were 3 wings hanging on for dear life. *Spoiler Alert* pssttt..Those wings didn't make it. The green beans were good TOO! I mean San Tung, where have you been all my life?! What on Irving St...oh okay thanks for the info. I wrote this review because last night I had a dried (...get it dried chicken wings..haha) dream about these delicious wings. I'm thinking they will be a treat to have while watching my 49ers today. Hopefully the game will turn out as good as I know my wings will be. GO 49ERS and GO to San Tung and grab some wings if you haven't.

This is an interesting northern Chinese/Korean joint, that is very different than the hundreds of other Chinese spots that dot the city. We started off with an order of shrimp and leek steamed dumplings. They were pretty good, though perhaps a little light on the shrimp. Next, we had the dry black bean sauce noodles (jiajiangmyun in Korean). This was a pretty accurate take on this popular Korean-Chinese noodle dish, and was a generous portion. We finished up with an order of their famous chicken wings (dry). They had a nice crispy texture with a lickable (and sticky) honey-chili sauce, or something along those lines. We did end up waiting about an hour to get a table at 2:30 on a Sunday afternoon, so the word (and hype) is definitely out. The food was good, but I don't know that it's necessarily worth a long wait. Takeout might be a better option next time around.

I don't mind the wait, most times it goes by really fast because the person calls the party's name three times and if no one claims it... on to the next name! When I first came here I thought their dry fried chicken was really dry. It is not. We ordered one dry friend chicken and one wet one. The dry one was by far the BEST! The sauce isn't the same. The wet fried chicken's sauce is more.... wet, not as thick as the dry fried chicken. A friend of mine came here with me and several times he said he had a boneless chicken dish that had brownish red sauce. We basically ordered everything on the chicken menu that came with fried chicken, none of them was the one he wanted. One night we went in to write our name and party number down, he pointed at a table that had the dish he remembered. I asked the waiter what dish that was and LO AND BEHOLD, the waiter said it was dry fried chicken BONELESS! I laughed the whole night about this. If you don't like having to deal with bones, get the boneless. Just know that it will be crispier and will have less meat in each bite compared to getting it with bones. My usual order when I come here: Dry fried string beans JaJang Myun Dry fried chicken (varies from boneless or with bone) Pork Dumpings The dry fried string beans is to die for.... well not really, but this is the same taste that my dad makes his dry fried string beans at home and I can't stop eating it. If I don't have the time to visit my parents, I would come here to eat because the taste is just so similar!

First, I should say we were here on Christmas day with a large party, so our experience might not be typical. ?We called to make a reservation -- knowing Xmas in a Chinese restaurant could be crazy -- and they took it. ?Once we got there, though, we discovered it meant nothing: ?our party's name was written up on a board once we got there and we had a 45 minute wait. ?I wouldn't really hold that against them if the food had been worth the wait, which it wasn't. ?As it turned out, the cheap place we went to the night before -- T and T Seafood -- was much better. The dry wings were nothing special. ?The skin remained crispy despite the sauce, which I appreciated, but the sauce itself was pedestrian. ?The hot and our soup was very good -- probably the best part of the meal. ?The beef noodle soup -- which we had high hopes for -- wasn't worth finishing. ?The bok choy with black mushrooms was ordinary -- fair enough -- not much you can do with that, I guess, except use fresh materials and not overwhelming the flavors with oyster sauce. ?The pot stickers were good, and the combo fried rice was fine. ?The final dish we ordered never came. ?The fact that I was relieved rather than annoyed pretty much sums up my experience. ? I would not go back.

Honey Chicken Wings: A+ awesome Pot stickers, string beans: good Broccoli beef: meh Price: reasonable Wait: WTF? Overall, not worth it The chicken wings really were amazing. I wish we could duplicate them. But the wait is sadly not worth it. We waited an hour to be seated which is okay considering how busy they were and how good they were supposed to be. They then seemed to seat everyone at once. Then it took another hour before the food showed up. So two hours to get food...and we were really hungry...horrible combination. Will unfortunately not be going back here.

The dry fried chicken is crispy and gooey on the outside with a sweet sauce, and tender on the inside. It's good, but after about 4 pieces, it's a bit overwhelmingly sweet. I preferred this over the "wet dry chicken wings". Don't ask me how that makes sense; you will understand when you see the menu. I wasn't a fan of the flavor of black bean noodles, but the texture was amazing - so deliciously chewy! So the next time I came, I ordered the Beef Tendon Soup. The broth was good, but nothing out of the ordinary, and came with the chewy house noodles (yum!). I wish they had more veggies and meat inside. There was literally 2 or 3 small pieces of meat... how stingy for $9!

I can't believe I haven't written a review for San Tung! This is preposterous. I've eaten here about a dozen times, and it's always my go to spot for out of towner family members. Dy chicken wings, wet chicken wings... they're both extremely good. But most people have a slight preference over the dry ones. So flavorful and delicious. And they taste healthy if that's even possible??? These wings beat out bon chon any day. Bring it. The peanut noodles are also really good, but you know what's better? The black bean noodles aka cha jjang myun. So unbelievably delicious and flavorful. I can eat this thing on my own. The green beans are also really good. I'd skip the fried dumplings because they're huge and a bit doughy... if you like that then you might love these. For some reason, every time I go, I've never had to wait long. If you order take out, it's ready in 15 minutes and you can enjoy it in your house. I'm coming back on Thursday night to bring my sister, and I can't wait!!! Order a lot, because you won't want to share.

I love Chinese food and I love Korean food. Put them together and you get HEAVEN! If you come here, you only need to order 3 things: Dry fried chicken wings, string beans, and rice. Oh, and I guess you need some water too. =P I did not come here because of Yelp. I came here because I was hungry and I wanted chicken. I actually never even heard of this place before my visit. Now I'm sitting in San Jose, on the verge of grabbing my car keys to drive all the way to San Francisco to eat their perfectly fried chicken that has a hint of a honey taste and drive all the way home to have one of the best sleeps of my life...

After hearing so much about the wings I finally decided to give the place a try. It's weird how no one says anything to you when you walk in. They'll go as far as walk up and look directly at you, turn away and go do something else. Not until someone behind us came in and made a b line to the small board on the opposite side of the door did we realize we just need to put our names up, even though there was no one on the board at that time. Weird coming in at like 4.30 you'd expect the place to be kinda empty but it was half full. After the 5pm mark this place gets crazy insane. Glad we got in when we did even though that's not remotely the time I eat. We came in because it was close to where we were and I had no idea if I'd be back in the area again. Dry fried wings, pigs ear in garlic soy and spinach/shrimp dumplings made our mid afternoon snack. Wings were definitely good as were the pigs ears. The dumplings seemed kinda pedestrian so I think if I do come back here I'd try the dry fried prep on fish or prawns the next time. Not great ambiance or service so get in, eat, get out. 3.75 stars

Based on my last review I'm pretty sure its been over two years since I've had Chinese food. Today I was oddly inspired (thanks Ruggy!) to try peanut and rooster sauce over noodles. Wow. Their peanut sauce comes with scallops, shrimp, mushroom, and peas served over fresh made noodles. Throw on some extra sriracha for added heat and this meal is about as hearty as you can imagine. Don't bother with the wait for a table, just get your food to go. I think I'll be back again soon....

Don't bookmark this as just another Chinese restaurant, they offer things here you cannot get elsewhere and it is worth the wait. What else can be said about their delicious, famous dry fried chicken wings? They are sweet and spicy, crispy and saucey. I like to ask for it to be spicier! Don't overlook other items on the menu like their dumplings and black bean noodles. Their dumplings are actually really good! And honestly, order more than you think and if you are with more than a party of four, I would double up on items. I know that it's always best to order lots of things and share so you can try a variety of things, but I actually think San Tung does a handful of things really well that I would prefer to just eat more of those items. I'll probably try to venture out more in the future. Maybe. My only complaint is that it's a very crowded place and everything happens VERY fast. The waiters are working at such a fast pace, I feel really rushed to eat and cramped. There are tables very close to each other and people waiting for tables standing right by seated customers; it also gets loud. I appreciate that they are trying to move as many people as possible and get as many people seated as they can, but it's a really frantic environment. Food is good and worth the long wait. Hope you can eat fast!

EPIC CHICKEN WINGS!!! I don't even know how to describe them in a way that will do them justice. With the one-of-a-kind glaze that they're coated in, you won't even be mad that your fingers get sticky and dirty. Obviously it can get really busy here because of the acclaim the wings have amassed. I've gone on a Saturday for dinner and the restaurant was at capacity with people waiting outside. But last time I was here on a weekday for lunch and we were seated right away. I get TWO orders of the dry fried chicken wings--one for me to take home and one for me to eat in the restaurant. I've tried some of their other popular dishes, like the black bean noodles, dumplings, and string beans but to me they're forgettable and I go without them most of the time. Just the basics for me...give me some fried rice and those wings, please!

I've eaten here twice and ordered out. The first time was around dinner so we did have to wait 30 minutes. The second time, service was good because we went at 2pm when no one was really there. I've had their noodles and garlic spinach (which were good) but all that is just the background for the chicken wings! My friend argued with me that Manna's chicken wings were better. Just to compare, I ate Manna's yesterday and San Tung's today. If you need some spice in yo life, get Manna's. If you want something more mild with a touch of sweetness, like yours truly, get San Tung's.

Mediocre Chinese food. Being Chinese and coming from a city that has 10 Chinese restaurants on the same block, this was just A-OK for me. But I know a LOT of people love this place from the thousands of reviews. The wait was around 45 minutes for my crew of 5 when we came on Monday around 7pm. We were asked if we wanted to wait longer for our own table or we could share tables with another group. Starving as we were, we took the offer of sharing with another group. We were seated and waited 15 minutes until a waiter finally noticed all of us looking at him with our hands in the air. It was a toss between the waiters because the one that took our order was ok, but the one who billed us was full of attitude. We asked for the check and HE ROLLED HIS FRICKEN EYES AND SCOFFED AT US. HELLLLL NOOO...... less tip for you mister. Anyways, food. (2) Dry Fried Chicken (boneless): 3.5 stars. We ordered two dishes of this, but am I not ordering the right thing everyone else is raving about? Because it was not THAT great. I will admit, the first few bites were really good, but after a while it was verrryyy heavy and disgusting to me. They had too much batter/sauce and too little of the chicken which made the dish overwhelmingly sweet and unappetizing after the 4th scoop of chicken. It kind of reminded me of orange chicken but over the top saucy with too much batter covering it. http://www.yelp.com/biz_… Dry Fried String Beans: 2 stars. Well, i might be biased because I never eat veggies, but it was kind of plain even after it was fried with garlic and sauce. http://www.yelp.com/biz_… Dried Fried Calamari: 2 stars. My friend liked this dish, but I personally did not. It was the same problem as the dry fried chicken where it had too much batter and too much sauce making it unappetizing and overly sweet. It did however inherit the chewiness it was supposed to. But I personally did not like the texture of the calamari. http://www.yelp.com/biz_… Braised Bean Curd: 3 stars. It was a mix of tofu, bak choy, egg plant, cucumber, zucchini, and carrots braised ?together in some sauce that was semi-sweet and semi-salty. The tofu was really plain and tasteless, but the bak choy and cucumber absorbed the sauce and was pretty flavorful. http://www.yelp.com/biz_… Portions were pretty big because the 5 of us could not finish the 5 dishes we ordered. Price wise, I actually was not able to take a look at how much each dish were but our total came out to about $66.78, $14 each person. Parking was not the greatest, but what can you expect, its IRVING at dinner time. We parked around 6 blocks away from the restaurant which didnt really bother me because it's good to walk it off after eating anyways. Unfortunately, I did not have as great of an experience as everyone else, but I know it may just be me because I have a spoiled tongue. Hope everyone else will have a good experience here though!

The dry chicken wings is the best like everyone mention, however the dry black bean noodles were just okay. ?The noodles are al Dente (the way i like them)but the taste was average and expensive for what you get. ?The pan fried pot stickers were chewy and delicious, my second fav besides the Wings would be the dry fried flounder. ?YUM. ?I am giving them a four because if you get there at closing on a Sunday night, you will get to smell and see them roll out the trash cans out through the door to put them out for trash pick up. ?I couldn't believe they did this while patrons were in the restaurant and it didn't seem to bother anyone else. ?Really trash through the restaurant while people are eating? But I was glad I have already eaten and waiting for our bill.

We only got one thing here: the chicken wing. We got it togo, the wait was sooo long, so many people waiting outside. And it was packed inside. The chicken wing is so freaking good. Its not the most healthy thing I have to admit, but the sauce, the little kick of heat, and the crispy-ness makes it just perfect. After we were finish, we wanted more. You must get this if you are in the neighborhood!

I can see why this place is so popular with a serious wait to dine in. Ordered take-out from San Tung to avoid the long wait because we were short on time. Got the peanut cold noodles with seafood. It was really tasty. Never had peanut sauce noodles with seafood in it. I've always had it plain. Very filling though. Also got the Tea Smoked Duck. It was okay. I much rather prefer the normal peking duck. Their duck is marinated and has a different taste to it that I am not used to. Also got the seafood fried rice which is also pretty good. But you can't possibly be a Chinese restaurant and mess up on fried rice. We also got dumplings. And I have to give them one star off for not giving us any sauce for the dumplings. Not sure if they forgot to pack it in, but even if they did, five stars are for exceptional places. Sorry, San Tung. Nonetheless, I do admit, their Dry Fried Chicken Wings is the item to get! This is what everyone from all over the states come here to order. This is why San Tung is voted "Best Chinese Restaurant in America." The reason for the crowd of people in front of the place during all hours of the day. And this entree alone is enough to bring me back! They give very generous portions and these 5 dishes was enough to put our party of 5 in food coma.

Five Stars Dried chicken wings (about a dozen per order, what a steal); Shrimp & leek dumplings (another dozen); even the kimchi they serve stands to be one of the best I've had! Props. Tips and Fun Facts San Tung translates to Shan Dong (a coastal region of China), who would have guessed! Came with a group of 5 at 3pm on a Sunday and was seated right away, can't imagine what the line must be like during peak times. But definitely worth the hype!

KOREANS READ THIS and if you're not korean but you want to read a REAL REVIEW then read this omg seriously people? this place ISNT THAT GREAT! now if i could give a real review to this i would give it 3 stars, but i'm giving it a 1 so that it might bring a little bit of the inflation of stars down. HONESTLY SPEAKING its just one of those korean/chinese restaurants that sells jjajjangmyun, ggampoongi and jjambbong. YEAH. these are dime a dozen and littered all over santa clara county and near el camino in SJ. and those dry fried chicken wings? ITS ONLY GGAMPOONGI! and it tastes EXACTLY the same as all of the other places ive been to. theres NOTHING SPECIAL ABOUT IT. i was soooo excited to try this place because i am always down to look for some delicious chinese food to eat, but when i realized what kind of restaurant this was, i was SO INCREDIBLY disappointed. their jjajjangmyun isnt even that good (black bean sauce noodles) ive definitely had better at the ones in SJ... im seriously so sad. i went to this place with great expectations because people RAVED about those chicken wings but alas... they were nothing special. also, theyre cheaper in SJ. their food was very blah and their chicken wings nothing special. i honestly DON'T know why my boyfriend went crazy over the chicken wings. he ate most of them saying they were extremely good. he's half taiwanese and half white.. and it seemed to me that the white people there enjoyed the chicken wings the most so maybe its his white side speaking. BUT he does agree with me that the food is below average and that we've had better elsewhere. DON'T FOOL YOURSELFFFFFFFFF. i mean its worth trying i guess.. to quench that curiosity over the wings.. but you will be disappointed. i assure you.

If you come here and you don't order the Dry Fried Chicken Wings, then you have wasted your time waiting in that super long line to get a seat at this restaurant, buddy. They are known for their chicken wings and that's what draws the crowd. Look around at every table, I bet 90% of them have ordered those wings. What's so special about them you ask? The secret's in the sauce. I swear they put crack in it cause they've got me scooping every last bit of sauce over my rice so I can savor the flavor as long as possible. A great alternative if you don't feel like getting your hand dirty would be the Dry Fried Flounder. Same great sauce, no bones, no hands necessary, NO MESS. Other great things to order from the menu: 1. String beans: C'mon, you need some greens in your diet! (if you go during lunch, you can see one of the workers sitting in front of a massive pile of green beans and peeling/preparing them. So this dish must get ordered a lot of they always have a massive heap of string beans to be peeled.) 2. Noodles with black bean sauce: I think this is actually a Korean dish, it comes out as a bowl of noodles and a gloop of black bean sauce over it. Mix it together and you have some bomb ass noodles! 3. Shrimp dumplings: Yammy. Also, come for lunch on weekdays for their lunch specials. I believe the dry fried chicken wings are $6.50 instead of $9.50 and it comes with rice and soup of the day.

Dry Fried Chicken Wings they are worth the wait. the line gets long, have patience -trust that it is. write your name on the white board by the door and take it all in. so let's get straight to the point. everyone raves about it and so we had to try it too. the dry fried chicken wings. we had them chopped and so we wouldn't have to worry about the bones. it's like the best popcorn chicken you've ever had! crisp tangy keeps you reaching for more. eat them with a side of rice. just plain steamed will do. in fact the rice makes a perfect canvas for the delicious masterpiece. no need to get fried rice with all the extras. there is an elegance to it's simplicity. until next time cheers

I usually don't go out for Chinese food since I have a Chinese mom who likes to cook and force feed me huge Chinese feasts everyday because she secretly wants me to be really fat so guys wouldn't want to marry me and I'll live at home and be mommy's little fat girl forever... Anyway, I wanted to check out San Tung for the longest time because of its thousands of positive Yelp reviews, because of the never-ceasing lines of people waiting outside the restaurant everyday, and because my landlady kept talking about the place and I wanted to suck up more to her by having one more common topic to talk about to strengthen our bond that would hopefully eventually lead to reduced rent. ?Also, I just really wanted to see what San Tung's famous dry fried chicken wings are like. It was finally meant to be one day when my lovely San Fran friends invited me and my European summer sidekick for a final dinner at San Tung. ?So, I happily skipped a block and half over to the restaurant (yes, I actually lived that close, but always went for pho instead). We ordered all the signature menu items- the dry fried chicken wings (2 portions), black bean sauce noodles, shrimp and chives dumplings, and some garlic string beans. OH MY GAWD, THE DRY FRIED CHICKEN WINGS WERE AMAZING. ?They were like sesame chicken on bones, except better. ?Tasted so good I think I had about 11 wings swimming in my tummy afterwards. I enjoyed the black bean sauce noodles too, except it was a little messy to take and eat and I felt like a toddler with random splotches of black bean sauce around my plates and on my face. -0.5 star for service: Despite our reservation and my friend's connection to the owner, we still waited about an hour until my stomach completely emptied before we finally got our food. ?Also, the waiter got me about 5 more forks when I asked for a knife to go with the fork he already brought me the first time. ?But I'll round it up to 5 stars because I'm forgiving and I loved those chicken wings.

If it wasn't for my friend, I would've never discovered this place. My first time here was post 40 mile bike ride (quick tour around San Francisco and across the Golden Gate Bridge to Marin with him... And damn that makes you hungry. I have since been back multiple times, bringing friends and family alike, cause it's really that good. But I digress. The wait can be upwards of an hour or so, depending on the time of day. There's always a small line no matter what the hour, but I've seen the list grow upwards of twenty tables O.o Holy crap. On the bright side, they do turn tables around pretty quickly (be prepared to share tables with others if you're a smaller party); part of this is due to the fact that they tend to squeeze people in close (be nice to you're neighbors!). The chicken wings are a MUST here. I'm sure all the other reviews say the same thing, but it bears repeating. These are insanely good chicken wings. In fact... I would brave the lines and crowds, just to have them. I've heard that the xiao long bai are also quite good, but sadly I have not had the chance to try them... Yet. Also, try the string beans cause they're very tasty. Some of their noodle dishes are a bit hit or miss (I had one that was incredibly saucy). The only thing that keeps me coming back so often is the fact that it is a bit of a drive to get to, and parking, as usual in SF is a pain in the ass. Keep in mind it is a little bit more pricey than compared to your typical hole in the wall Chinese restaurant, but I think the food is still worth the money. All in all, service is quick, food (especially the chicken wings! On nom nom yummies) is really good, pricing is reasonable, and if you can stand the crowds, this is one of the better Chinese food places in the city!

The service is non-exisiting. ?It could be they are always busy. ?We had to use some military tactic to corner our waiter to get our children some ice waters. ?The all male staff look miserable, without a single simile, make me feel bad for them. ?

Called them to correct the mistake, guy wants me to pay the difference for me to come down there and switch the order they messed up. As we discuss it, my difference goes fom $3-$3.25-$3.50-$4.00.

There's always a wait time at San Tung so I recommend calling in an order and taking it to-go. When they say 20 mins, add another 10.

Service is typical Chinese restaurant service - not exactly rude, but they don`t exactly act like they care. I got the three deluxe spicy sauce noodles and a friend got the beef with snow peas, as well as rice [which was an $1.50]. Both the beef and the rice were really small portions - even to me, and I don`t eat much, especially when you have to pay for the rice separately. The noodles were covered in a sticky sauce that didn`t look very appetizing and certainly didn`t taste like it did either. In fact, it kind of just didn`t taste like anything. I took like two bites and couldn`t get myself to finish it. Packed it to-go and gave it to my mom to revamp.

I love the food and the taste is great. The downfall of this place is the lines and the wait. We got takeout but it was still 30 min wait. PLUS, we tried calling for 25 mins... no one picked up. Their chicken wings were good and hot when we first had it and the string beans were great! i guess the two typical things that people get. One day when they don't have so many people, I would love to go there and try it for realsss instead of getting togo because I can't justify reviewing for a place when I don't have the full on experience.

Kimchi. Always comes free, love me some freebies! Super yummy and delicious but also packs a punch! Dry Fried Green Beans. So good! I could eat this everyday, way to make veggies taste delicious. The stronger flavors of the sauce worked well with the natural flavor of the green beans, the green beans neutralized the flavors a bit. ?Just the right amount of nommy sauce and flavor with the springy greenness of green beans. Dry Fried Chicken Wings. This is by far my most favoritest dish here ever! I could eat this everyday too! I love how crispy and sweet the chicken wings are, plus the honey and sugar in the sauce make it skin slightly chewy. It's super well-flavored and uber nommy! I've had both the dry fried chicken wings and the wet fried before but I've never been able to tell the difference, if someone knows please enlighten me because I'm literally dying to know... Potstickers. This was alright, not my fave for sure. It's just pork and lettuce and stuff inside. Didn't really think it was anything special nor anything special to write home about. The waits can be super long so come on a rainy day or a random time and you'll definitely get a table. 5 stars for nommy chicken wings and green beans that keep me craving em!

If you are ever craving saucy fried chicken wings, San Tung is the place to be. ?The table list is typically ridiculously long so either get there at an unusual time or get ready to wait it out. ?Or, if you've already had the true bustling San Tung restaurant experience, head on over to the sister cafe next door. ?The atmosphere is definitely different from the crowded, loud space of the actual restaurant, but it has their famous chicken wings there to order along with a selection of gelato and milk tea.

Granted, their fried angel wings are great, the rest of the Chinese dishes can be better found elsewhere. Lunch is the only price point that makes sense for the cuisine. The client ratio is more mixed and less Asian so that gives you better sense of the dishes. Will come back only if my boyfriend is seriously craving that chicken! Otherwise, there is much more better places around there.

I have had better. Came here in a large group and ordered 6 plates of the chicken, which is their most raved about dish. I didn't enjoy the chicken one bit; salty, full of oil and drenched in their special sauce. You for sure need lots of rice with the chicken to even out the dish or lots of napkin to clean off the sauce on the chicken

If I'm craving San Tung, we are going to San Tung..... I alwasy order the same dishes whenever i go here: dry fried chicken wings (usually diced), combination fried rice, string beans, and shrimp and leek dumplings....you can never go wrong with these dishes!!! TRUST!! some tips: 1. parking is a hassle here so you might be driving around for a while looking for a spot 2. it is usually busy from open to close, so be prepared to wait long if you are at peak hours like lunchtime, and after work around 530-6 until closing. make sure you put your name on the erase board on the wall at entrance for wait list. 3. service: the staff has it all down... but it's really the order your food, eat your food, pay for dinner and leave kinda place... they don't really want anyone just hanging around talking and sitting at table... they want the next group to be seated right away, and pretty much everyone that goes there understands the way they operate 4. cheap cheap cheap!!!!

We came in and there were 2 free tables but yet they asked us to put our name on the waiting list. -1 star. The menu is extensive and a little on the pricey side for lunch. We order the chicken wings which are raved about, the black bean noodles and the shrimp and leek dumplings. The shrimp and leek dumplings arrived first. They were ok - not the best I've tasted. The black bean noodles was also very average. If that's supposed to be good then clearly you don't know food. -1 star. Finally, the chicken wings were awesome - worth the admission alone as they say. This would and does warrant +1 star but is cancelled out by the fact the waiter deemed himself to know what we would prefer....I know wtf right? We ordered the wet wings because the sauce works well with rice but he brings out the dry version because he thinks we would prefer that?! I can't believe that was done and should result in -2 stars but I'll just dock one as he was apologetic. He should have asked first before changing a customer order. Leaving us with 3 stars. Average food and poor wait staff balanced by excellent wings. We will see about coming back again.

I love their wet chicken ;) Super delicious savory flavors! You must try, it is sweet with a tint of spiceness and super crunchy! Outstanding chicken wings and drumstick! Food came out really quick too. Service was great, the servers were really nice. Ordered the pork dumplings and it was fresh! Also ordered the black noodles, usually Korean places serve was good but I rather try another dish. The wait for dinner wasn't that bad, was prob 5-10 minute wait. Just keep yourself occupied so time will fly faster. We ordered another wet chicken to go for a friend and that took some time so make sure you order ahead of time so you don't have to wait again.

Nomnomnomnom. Wait. I never reviewed this place? I love this place so much. My friend said she has more pictures of their dry fried chicken wings than she does of her friends! When I go, we order the shrimp and leek dumplings, hot and sour soup, dry fried chicken wings, wet black bean sauce noodles and a kimchi noodle like dish but I forgot the name. The dry fried chicken wings taste like heaven in my mouth. Sometimes when a group of five of us go, we just order 5 plates of chicken wings with one bowl of rice. Delicious! The wait though? Go at 5 pm and skip the line. You should also drop someone off to put their name on the list while you circle for parking. Lunch is great too because they have dried fried chicken wings WITH rice for only about $6-$7. Totally worth the price!

Just get the wings, and nothing else (unless you're absolutely starving). They have dry-fried or wet. I personally like the wet because I like my wings saucy but most people I know swear by the dry. Either way the seasoning and sauces are pretty much the same so they're both delicious. I'd suggest take-out unless you enjoy waiting a gazillion years outside with a bunch of Chinese people. Those wings are totally worth the wait though...nom.

Fried Chicken + Hot and Sour soup being the wining combination. This place can be really crowded. ?If you have a choice, order takeouts. ?If you have party over 5, you can get dinner reservation before 5pm. ? There are other dishes that are good. ?The many different types of dumplings, black sauce noodles, etc. ?I will suggest going with Fried Chicken and Hot and Sour soup. ?If you have a bigger party, complement them with some dumplings and noodles.

Perhaps we didn't order right but I was underwhelmed. The wings were sweet and fried - had better versions elsewhere. The fried flounder was very similar, except, of course, that it was fish. I'm not a big fish lover but I preferred this to the wings. The dry fried green beans were heavier than they needed to be. The black bean noodles were the least favorite dish at the table. The sizzling rice soup was very good and had s lot of white pepper in it. We sat by the door and it was crowded and cold.

I don't think I really need to write much about San Tung cause everybody and they mama knows about San Tung and what to order from from here. 3 things I always order: Shrimp and Leek dumplings - can be plain just by themselves. ?Add soysauce and hot sauce and you've got yourself an explosion in your mouth. Dry fried chicken/calamari/beef/shrimp - dry fried anything is effing delicious. ?Whatever meat you choose is fried to perfection, not too crispy and never soggy. ?You can order either wet or dry. ?Like sauciness? ?Order wet. ?I personally like dry. Stringbeans - I just love stringbeans so they taste good to me regardless. ?They're always crispy and flavorful and make me say "mmm" everytime I put the first stringbean into my mouth. The bubs always orders some type of noodle. ?The noodles are always chewy and are extremely filling. ?I'm just not crazy about any of the sauces. ?On the other hand, he LOVES them. I've been coming here for a few years now and every single time I eat here, it's always been an awesome experience; good food and excellent service.

Lines are ridiculously long! But that's for a reason, of course. What draws in the crows is their dry fried chicken wings, because they are absolutely to die for. ? If i were to rate the dry fried chicken wings by itself, it deserves 5 stars. But I think the rest of the dishes and service downgraded the overall rating. I think everything else is just alright though, nothing too special. I came here with a group of 5, and 6 dishes eating family style just wasn't enough. And since some of the food took a while to come, we wouldn't be getting our food anytime soon even if we ordered. And considering the price, it wasn't really worth it to spend more. We decided to just leave it as that and just go grab a teaway to actually fill us. Here's a tip, if you only want to go there for the dry fried chicken wings, there's another place called So Restaurant @ 1010 Bryant St. It tastes exactly the same, but it's on the other side of town. I heard the So restaurant owner is the son of the owner of San Tung.

I first came to San Tung a couple years back when my brother's friend brought some wings to a potluck gathering we had. They were delicious & my brother asked where he got them. My brother & sister-in-law later went here & passed along the recommendation. Since then, I've been to San Tung a bajillion times & have gotten take-out as well. DRY FRIED CHICKEN WINGS FOR THE WIN!!!!! :) You MUST MUST MUST get an order of these...what's the point of going to San Tung if you don't?! Haha. A full order comes with 12 wings. I've also tried the vegetable/chicken fried rice, which was a perfect addition to the wings. There's other things that I've tried, but don't remember the names. Very appetizing though. They have a good lunch menu. Comes with soup, steamed rice, & an entree. Service kinda sucks. They hardly check on you. You have to ask for water refills. You have to flag them down; eye-contact doesn't really work. Note: closed on Wednesdays (hump day!). Such a random day of the week, but I guess so. Metered parking & residential parking nearby. Depending on the time of day, it could be hard to find parking.

On our way to Napa, my freinds and I decided to stop off at SF to try San Tung's famous Dry Fried Chicken Wings. First off, parking was a nightmare as it took us about 40 mins driving up and down each street for a spot. There was a long line when we got there around 6pm. The wait must've been about 20 mins long and it was not fun considering SF chilly weather as we were standing by the outside doorway. When we finally got seated we ordered a few dishes to share: *Steamed Potstickers - $6.75 (3/5 stars) Steamed potstickers with ground pork, cabbage wtih ginger & garlic *Garlic Flavored Eggplant - $7.50 (3/5 stars) Eggplant braised in spicy garlic sauce *Mongolian Beef - $9.00 (3/5 stars) Sliced tender beef sauteed with red peppers & green onions *Dry Fried Chicken (wet sauce) - $9.00 (is there such thing as 6 stars?) Deep fried chicken wings in batter with garlic spicy sauce, red peppers, mushrooms and bamboo shoots. The Dry Fried Chicken wings definitely lived up to its name. It was crunchy, wet, garlicky and spicy....with perfect amount of batter. Definitely finger lickin' good! ? By the time we left around 8pm, the restaurant was still jam packed and the line was even longer outside. ?I shudder just thinking about standing out in the cold. But I would do it again for the Dry Fried Chicken wings!

People wake up. Talk about a mass hallucination. We waited an hour to get a table. The door is open half the time with the freezing night air piling in. The food is nothing special and I won't be returning. The wings are good but so what. The rest of our meal was slop. The pot stickers were the worst I have ever had in my entire life. The black bean noodle was horrid, no flavor and the noodles were starchy. The Mongolian Beef was ok but I've had better. Maybe we ordered the wrong dishes but I was really disappointed. Definitely not worth the wait.

The first bite of a San Tung Dry-Fried Chicken Wing is heavenly. Crispy skin, complemented by moist, juicy, tender chicken, swimming in a sweet, sticky sauce. Each order comes with 12 wings and is ~$10. I will say that after the sixth or seventh wing, the sauce becomes a little TOO sticky and a little TOO sweet, so I would order something else to balance the flavor of the wings. Other recommendations: Five-Spice Beef Noodle Soup - an extremely flavorful broth, with tender beef, long noodles, and spinach. The best beef noodle soup I've had in SF. Dry Sauteed String Beans - very oily, but we ordered it to feel a little "healthier" about our meal. Out of the three, I would recommend the chicken wings & the noodle soup the most. Each dish was ~$10. We ordered 2 orders of wings, the string beans, and noodle soup between 3 people and paid $15 each after tax and tip. Tip: They accept only 2 credit cards per order, and every extra one is $1.00 charge.

Amazing deep fried chicken wings with garlic honey sauce with red peppers......planning on serving this soon at one of our family's potluck dinners! My mom usually buys the fried chicken drummettes from Gourmet Kitchen in SF (the one on the left; there are 2 take-out ?deli places next to each other on Stockton St. serving almost the same chicken but one is better!) but this chicken dish is much more tasty!

I've always dreamed of the moment that someone would finally notice my Yelp reviews, and then I could finally become a STAR! ?I have very high doubts for such likelihood... especially when what I am reviewing is the same as 2000+ people before me. ? OH WELL! ?San Tung's ORIGINAL Dry Fried Chicken Wings are too good to not talk about. ?ALTHOUGH there is nothing too "original" about the flavor profile, this establishment executes it well. ?Fried with a great crunchy crust.. then coated and tossed in a sweet and sticky sauce.. and then splashed around with some dried chilies, these chicken wings are definitely worth a return trip! The other item I ordered was the Hot Braised Bean Curd, which was ONLY okay. ?If the Bean Curd dish is a reflection of their other menu items, then nothing else may be worth parading about. ?When you come, order the Original Dry Fried Chicken Wings, or you have no business there!! In terms of anything else: the service is quick and attentive, however, I was charged $3 for something (e.g. rice, tea, kim chi-like cold dish). ?Whatever it was, I didn't order it, it was given to me. ?But $3 wasn't worth the fight. ?Just bear it in mind to review the check.

This places passes the "line test" (i.e. If there is always a long wait, that usually means "as good as it gets") I have been coming here for almost 10 years now, it was one of the first places I ate Chinese food in SF. ?Many restaurants have I visited since then, but very few can match the level of great food, price and .... great (crunchy) kim chi. ?Here, the food is inspired by both Chinese and Korean sensibilities (hence, the kim chi they serve). This place is famous for the fried chicken, but I prefer the Garlic chicken, string beans, shrimp dishes. ?You can't go wrong with anything you order here (unless you are on an extreme diet). ?But don't take my word for it: this place has been reviewed by over 2700 Yelpers (and counting). During the weekend, expect a fairly long wait (around 30-45 min), so plan accordingly. ?Try to come during off-rush hours.

lets be clear about this, rarely i will wait for over 45 min to a unknown place much less a Chinese place. ?That said, it was worth the wait. ?That said, if you go for dinner, drop your friends off to sign up for a table as parking will drive you crazy.. or at least to drink. ;0) Food suggestions: Dry fried chicken, Hot and sour soup, string beans and ask for extra fortune cookies! ?However, i would pass on the Garlic noodles that you will see everyone ordering, i found to be very plain and in dire need of vinegar. Most plates under $8 and you get a free plate of Kimchi, which oddly enough a Korean dish, but who cares as it is awesome. Oh ya, go for the shrimp and leek steamed dumplings as it is 18 of those bad ass little suckers so it is a good deal. So for 4 hungry people and beer the bill came to under $15 per person. ?Not bad for a good meal!

Saucy and Sweet!!! This is the place to be if you like your food with sweet sauce all over it. ?Pay close attention to the menu when you visit. ?Every dish seems to have some kind of sauce in it. ?A lot of sauce can be good because you can load up your tummy with steamed rice. ?:) I know everyone loves their wings. ?I'm the spicy, dry, and crispy wings kinda girl. ?San Tung's wings are sticky and sweet. ?Just like the way I remembered them to be when I first had San Tung's back in the early 2000's. ?They are not my favorite. ? I am a fan of the steamed shrimp and leek dumplings. ?The fillings reminded me of Shanghai dumplings but these were wrapped in the shape of potstickers. ?The green beans with pickled radish were not bad either. ?Again it was covered with either oyster sauce or sweet soy sauce so you can piled onto your bowl of steamed rice.

My friends and I came here 20 minutes before closing on a Saturday night (parking was hard to find) because we were in the city and wanted to try these super hyped up chicken wings. There were no more available tables but we were the only ones waiting . ?Within those 20 minutes before closing, about 5 other parties came after us and also put their names on the waiting list. In order to accommodate everyone and not have to turn anybody away, the waiters asked the small parties of 2 if they'd be willing to share a large table with each other - kinda strange to be sitting at a table with strangers, but hey, at least you get to eat there rather than having to just get your food to-go. Already I'm liking this place because they hustled to make sure everyone was able to be seated. Once we sat down, of course we ordered the original chicken wings. We also got an order of vegetable potstickers, noodles with black bean sauce, combination fried rice, and sautéed string beans. ?The food was good and not overly oily....yay! Everything was light and flavorful. I did notice a the food is on the sweeter side - for example, the sautéed string beans had a sweetness like honey rather than salty like soy or fish sauce. ?Now for the chicken wings. At first bite I thought, okay well these are sweet, garlicky, and very crispy...good, but what's with all the hype? Then you find yourself grabbing another and another until you're staring at an empty plate wondering if you should order an extra order of chicken wings to-go. What's in that stuff??? LOL Overall I like this place. Good food. Accommodating. And oh, did I mention they also had Grey Goose in addition to their beer options?! :D

Yum :) Visited my Bestie in SF this weekend and she introduced me to this place as one of the places that she likes in the City. For four people, we ordered an order of dried chicken wings, pork dumplings, shrimp and leek dumplings, fried potstickers, and wonton soup. The dried chicken and pork dumplings were my favorite! The shrimp and leek dumplings were also good, but we placed that order after the pork dumplings so it had pretty hard competition. The fried potstickers were ginormous - we ended up taking most of it to go. I didn't have the actual wonton itself, but the soup was good. Overall, it was a lot of food for four people, but we wanted to try a little bit of everything due to the long wait to get our table (it was also during the time when the runners from the Nike marathon finished) and with all the highly rated Yelp reviews :)

Wow!! Was introduced to this place by fellow yelper Kristen T. who had been raving about their dried fried chicken for months upon months. We ordered their special chicken without bones and hot damn was it good. It was crispy but not burnt, flavored but not over salted, and savory with a touch of sweetness. ?When I tried the chicken I was in such a state of shock that I could only say dumb cliche phrases such as "Wow! This is so good they must put crack in here!" "This is so tasty and flavorful!" and "Whoa, thanks for taking me here!" I continued raving like an idiot until we were done eating. Hmm, I guess I need to mention the other details besides the chicken to make this review complete, so just for the record: the potstickers were okay, and so was the service, price, and ambiance. All just okay. An above average place with RIDICULOUSLY delicious chicken. YOU GO NOW!

Worth the wait! Had the dry fried chicken wings which were a perfect combination of crispy and saucy! We have our own restaurant with "crack wings" back home in Vancouver (phnom penh) and these are just as addictive. Even at 3:00 pm when we passed by after a long walk, there was still a line! Definitely says something about the place.

The dry fried chicken wings with sweet and savory glaze!! 10 meaty chicken wings per order, fried in a light crispy batter covered and infused with the thick, sweet and tangy brown glaze (plus I requested extra), aand there are some spicy red peppers and garlic in the mix. SO succulent and flavorful especially with rice! I would go as far as to say...ecstasy! Coming from someone who usually bypasses anything chicken. I don't care if I never try anything else at San Tung. (I did try their house noodles though. They were a bit too soft for my liking)

I had this popular place book marked since George W. Bush's first year on his second term as president. Now halfway towards Barack Obama's first term as our current leader, it took us (my daughter and I) long enough to finally have a chance to try one of the hottest businesses right now. We were the first ones to dined there and being as popular as this place is, the restaurant gets crowded quick esp. lunchtime. I would hate to imagine how crowded this place gets at dinnertime and the weekends. From the menu, we both agreed on the vegetarian fried rice and the renowned dried fried chicken wings. Except I wasn't too hungry, thus I wanted to get only six pieces (half order). But daughter wanted a dozen to take some back for mommy later on in the day. "I guess, many of you agreed on her decision." We each had a bowl of soup and a dish of kimchi. I had the kimchi and daughter drank the soup, which had tofu and eggs. I hate tofu. But she enjoyed the warm soup. Soup: http://www.yelp.com/biz_… Kimchi: http://www.yelp.com/biz_… The $6.25 fried rice dish had rice, eggs, sliced mushrooms, and a scoop of frozen pea and carrot. The fried rice had some of the pea and carrot mixture still frozen. As a result, the rice dish was very bland. Our fried rice: http://www.yelp.com/biz_… The $9.50 spicy wings tasted pretty good. The wings had a nice crispy outer layer and glazed sauce with a unique spice and flavor. With our recent experience of Bon Chon Chicken in Sunnyvale, I often questioned myself if the famous wings are classified as Chinese or Korean style. The wings are okay, but nothing too exciting. Our wings: http://www.yelp.com/biz_… My long anticipation to this place turned just acceptable. I might come here again and try the other food though.

Delicious. -The dried fried chicken wings are AMAZING. The flavor is just so good, it has a sweet and spicy taste to it and the chicken is fried to perfection. The boneless one is good too but I like the bone in better. -Not only is the chicken good but the noodles are good too, I had the spicy sauce noodles and the noodles are made fresh when you order and were super chewy and good. -The potstickers were also really good here. The inside of this place just looks like any normal restaurant, lots of seating and filled with people. Just talking about the food here is making me want to go back! You must try if you are craving Chinese food.

Dry-fried chicken wings are of course the best. I actually really like their chow mein too (combo, veggie, pork, chicken, whatever) because it has that wok-fried smoky quality to it. Jjajangmyung, dumplings, green beans are all also staples. A bit pricey for just Chinese food, but its so worth it! Its not uncommon to see tables getting a serving of wings PER guest! Here's the routine: drive to San Tung and drop off someone at the restaurant to put their name down on the whiteboard. Spend 10-20 minutes finding parking (easier to do so if you head towards Funston, 14th etc rather than towards 10th/9th. Although you can try your luck at the free parking lot). Depending on day/time/party size, you're in for a wait of anywhere from 30 min to over an hour... You can do what I do and walk to Yancy's to chill for a bit, or you can just stay there and wait, look at what people are ordering, figure out exactly what you want so you can order quickly, etc... Or you can just phone in your order and pick it up in 30 min, no fuss!

Came here on Sat night after the 49ers vs. Oakland pregame and were lucky to grab the first spot on the wait list! Soon after, people flocked in to have their names on the list and there were 7 names after us. ?We waited about 20mins before we were seated and another 10mins for the food to come out. Here is what we got: Dry black bean noodles: 5/5 Original chicken wings with the garlic sauce: 4.5/5 Combination fried rice: 4.5/5 String beans: 4.5/5 Pot stickers: 4/5 Beers: Sapporos & Anchor steam SF I can tell this is a Korean/Chinese fusion because right after we ordered, we were given kimchi (it was pretty spicy). The black bean noodles were excellent! The best that I have had, the sauce is not too thick and the taste was spot on. Normally when I get the black bean noodles at a Korean restaurant it doesn't come with any meat/veggies, but this place gives you beefs, calamari, scallops, zucchinis, cucumbers ?etc (seafood was not over cooked!). I would just be happy with this dish along. The reason why I gave the chicken wings a 4.5 instead of a 5 is that it could be a little bit spicier to give it a nice kick. Overall, it was fried and sauce nicely. The skin was super crispy which is good because I don't feel too bad eating it instead had me wanting more. The sauce has a good amount of garlic, and good sweet glaze (though my girlfriend thought it was little bit too sweet for her taste but I didn't). The meat was moist and not dry, you can tell it was fresh. You can't go wrong with fried rice and pot stickers thought it was good overall. The string beans were different from the string beans that I had. It had a sweet coating and garlicky, not over cooked. I was surprise that for an Asian restaurant they don't just have Heineken! All the dishes were not greasy looking and very light on the MSG, I came out not thirsty which is first time for a Chinese restaurant, an extra plus!! ?For an Asian restaurant they have good customer service, however, it is disorganized. We ordered the chicken dish and we didn't get it until almost the end of our meal, while the other tables that ordered after us received theirs first.

Bonless Fried Chicken Wings BOMB! I swear they are addicting and once you crave them nothing else will satisfy the craving so good. The Black Bean Noodles are also good so are the sauteed string beans. Come early or be prepared to wait for a while. Also keep an eye out on the white board when it gets too crowed people like to switch around names. But I would suggest ordering to go once it gets to that point.

I honestly can't understand what the hype was all about, at all. Maybe, just maybe, if this place only sold their wings, I'd understand, but no, it's a Chinese restaurant, that failed to deliver in my opinion. Food Cons: Everything I ordered here was extremely doused in sauce. The honey walnut shrimp? It was just shrimp slathered in mayo, all I could taste was the mayo, and a shrimp texture as I chewed. They should call it, MAYO ON SHRIMP EXTREME or something. The walnuts were good though, only thing that was kept away from the mayo. I was gagging on my 3rd piece of shrimp already. (I'm not the only that noticed it, we had left overs and my friend at home had some and he thought there was a lot of mayo too.) And their beef broccoli? The waiter suggested that one to us, and boy, I've never had broccoli that soggy before, and the beef was that rubbery kind too. Blah. My only regret was getting the fried rice, instead of steamed rice, if only I had known that I would have extra mayo and beef sauce to blend out into the rice. What sad life. After munching on everything, I just wanted to throw everything into a pot of steamed rice and mix it around a little for chop suey, San Tung edition. Foodpros: Wings were good, not like OMG jizz in my pants amazing, but good enough. Sweet and appetizing. They were surprisingly crispy, even though the wings are wet. Portions, at first I thought wow, the prices are pretty hefty for Chinese food, but I guess the portions really make up for it. Who knows. If the service was world class, I'd understand their high ratings too, but it wasn't. I felt like everything was thrown down onto the table, as if they're hinting "hurry eat up, there's a family of 6 waiting" Overall, it was a 1.5 star experience for me, but I'm rounding up. And I'm pretty sure I will not be coming back on my own will, ever.

Alright I'll join the bandwagon. My friend introduced us to this place and warned us of how long the lines and waitlist gets! So we showed up a little earlier before the lunch rush hour. +Got the dumplings which are pretty standard. +The chicken fried rice is DELICIOUS. +Beef brisket noodle soup had the most perfect noodles. It wasn't soggy. And slap on some rice in it. NOM. +Then, what everyone brags about: their dry fried chicken. My friend said that you get more meat if you asked for the diced version but I felt that was too much pow in my mouth. It's a must-eat with rice kinda dish otherwise, it's just too heavy. ... next time, we'll try the wing version! I LOVE WINGS :)

This place has been hyped up for me for a while now, so like a going into a movie after seeing so many trailers and having everyone tell you to go see it, I had to tell myself not to expect too much in fear of being let down. Finally went last weekend when friends from out of town were visiting - I posted a couple photos, but bottom line, get the **dry** chicken wings, that's the best thing they've got there. Everything is pretty "meh" - if you are looking for a Chinese food fix, don't get it here. This is for your chicken wing fix! Prepare for quite a wait, especially for bigger parties (groups of 2-4 got seated pretty quickly). And this is my rating for the chicken, if I factored in the other food we ordered, this could easily drop to 2.5. DRY CHICKEN!!!

As if this place needed another excellent review on their dry fried chicken wings...but no joke, the best chicken wings I've ever had and i don't even usually like chicken wings. But I crave these. And you will too if you try them. The perfect thing to do when you get here is to get a dish of the dry fried chicken wings, the black bean sauce green beans, and a side of rice. Done and done. The black bean noodles are ehhhh...I would just not bother and go all in on the delicious chicken wings! Brb as I go dream about how good those chicken wings are...drool.

Dry fried chicken wings! Boy, the wait can be rough here! ?On a Sunday, there was still one party waiting for a table at 345p. ?Expect an hour at peak times. But the wings are unique and worth it. ?A slight sweetness (tamarind?) and spiciness with ginger and onions. ?Lightly battered so crispy and juicy meat. ?Heaven with a bowl of white rice! The steamed potstickers are also good. ?I usually prefer fried potstickers but I think the skin is too thick and prefer the crispy skinned potstickers, whereas these get a little soggy. The black bean noodles are tasty too. ?I usually don't like so much sauce but it is nice and mild. ?Not my favorite dish itself, id prefer to fill up on wings and dumplings.

The food was good! Honestly, the food was good. At the same time, I didn't see anything particularly amazing about this restaurant. They move a lot of volume, and have a huge menu with a ton of options-- this, in itself, is impressive. I was a bit disappointed as far as flavor went, however. The chicken wings are tasty, but if we're putting this restaurant up on a pedestal because of it's chicken wings, then it might get squashed by other restaurants whose famous wings are tastier. If you're looking for a place to take a group of people and you're craving Korean-Chinese, this is a good option. I am hesitant to say it is the best, though, because I have to think there are other places where *all* of the dishes stand out. And now for a fantastic recipe for chicken wings! In a large pan with a lid, dissolve: - 1/4 c brown sugar - 1/4 c corn oil (although you probably don't need this much) - 1/4 c soy sauce - Minced/grated ginger - Minced/grated garlic Add 2 lbs chicken wings/drumsticks, bring to simmer, turn heat down, and cover. After 10 minutes turn the chickey wings over, cover again, and cook until finished (about another 10 minutes). Garnish with sesame seeds and/or sliced green onion. Note: Double sauce recipe for extra saucey sauce. Mmm mmm. Sticky Asian-ey chicken wings. Or tofu.

San Tung should just close their restaurant and sell their dry fried chicken wings out of a food truck. Like everyone else says, the dry fried chicken wings are superb. Sweet, tangy, salty, crispy and a million other words that you could use to describe how great they are. Unfortunately, their other menu items are just sort of mediocre. The black bean noodles, which is one of my favorite Chinese dishes of all time, were bland, which was surprising because they were drenched in sauce. The cucumbers, which are supposed to add a crunch and a cool refreshing bite to an otherwise salty and savory dish, did absolutely nothing because of how little they put in comparison to the amount of noodles and sauce they give you. The pork dumplings were dry, not even a single drop of delicious soup made it inside. I had to dunk these in copious amounts of soy sauce. The chicken and string beans (a dish that I have to order pretty much at every single Chinese restaurant I go to) were pretty good. The flavors were good and there was that tasty residual sauce that clings to everything, but the green beans were too crunchy and didn't have the darker, more shriveled, but still crunchy, appearance of places that serve up delicious dry sauteed string beans. Fortunately, the dry fried chicken wings are delicious enough to make up for everything else. I would definitely come back, but would probably just order some chicken wings and rice.

"I want some crack!" I feel like Tyrone Biggums was referring to this place whenever he yells that line. I sometimes get two (read: 2) orders of the dry fried chicken because they're like crack and I'm a fatass. The wait is long, and you sometimes get the pushy asian women who shove their way past you to grab the marker to put their name down. Minus that, this place is purty dayam good. P.S. Peter, the taller, skinnier server with the glasses, is the bomb. Really, all the waiters here are spot on: quick, perceptive, just spot on.

[#74 - original dry fried chicken] I've had the chicken wings at So in Soma, and was asking myself how much better can it possibly get? They use some type of dry better (guesses are corn starch, rice flour?) and coat it perfectly with a sauce which isn't too intense. The other items on the menu are kinda your traditional chinese fare, but the original dry fried chicken is off the wall.

I'm gonna start out by saying that I'm not a fan of fried food in general, but the wings were really juicy and flavorful. The reason San Tung is only getting 3 stars is because everything else we ordered was just okay/not that good. For 2 we came by on a Saturday at around 11:30am, right before a line formed. We ordered: - #9 Combination spicy soup noodles - the BF really liked this, I thought it was just as good as the soup at Korean noodle places (that also serve black bean noodles). Good, but not really something I couldn't get elsewhere - Combination cold plate - beef tripe and pig's ear - normally I really like the cold plates at Schezwan restaurants but the ones here weren't flavorful and had a weird aftertaste. After a few bites, I felt grossed out. - #74 Dry Fried Chicken - no explanation needed. - #114 Garlic Flavored Eggplant - this was really sour and not very good. I normally love eggplant at Chinese restaurants but this was disappointing. ? Would I come back? Probably for the chicken, but I would try other things different than what I listed above.

After many of my friends suggested coming here, I finally made it out for lunch today! ?Parking was such a drag, and we drove around for about 10-15 minutes before we found a spot. ?It wasn't too crowded today, maybe because it was around 1:30pm after the lunch rush, and we didn't have to wait for a table. 1. Dry Fried Crisp Wings - 5 stars!!!!! -SO GOOD!!!! I've always been a fanatic for great chicken wings, and this is now my new favorite place to come to (others are SO and Buffalo Wild Wings). ?Th texture of these wings are great because they're crispy, yet soft at the same time, and the sauce that they pour over it is soooo good (sweet and tangy and garlicy goodness). ?Plus, there's TWELVE of them! ?What a deal! 2. Black Bean Sauce Noodles - 3.5 stars -My family used to always make this when I was little, and I think the one here is just mediocre. ?Although the sauce wasn't too overwhelming, and there were freshly sliced cucumbers, shrimp, onions, and some other veggies in here, I think I wish it still had a little more of it since most of the bites I had were 99% noodle, when I was hoping for a little more vegetable. ?This is probably just my preference. 3. Shrimp and Leek Dumplings - 4.5 stars -minus 0.5 stars for not incorporating very much shrimp, and mostly leek into the dumpling...however, it was definitely home-made and authentic! You can tell home-made dumplings from the store-bought type that you see in the frozen section at grocery stores when after you cook the dumplings, they become shriveled up with a wrinkly texture, and the edges of the dumplings are completely perfected rounded. ?Plus the flour/dough they used to make these dumplings look freshly made also from scratch, like the kind my family makes. I can't wait to come back to this place again for more wings and more delicious Shan Dong food! p.s. You KNOW it's authentic and fresh when you see a bunch of guys sitting around the large round table in the back with a HUMONGOUS PILE OF GREEN BEANS, cutting off the ends of each one. :) http://www.yelp.com/biz_…

San Tung is one of the few restaurants that both my mom and I will consistently agree on for grabbing lunch. At any time of day this place is ALWAYS ridiculously crowded, but it's definitely worth the wait. We always get the Dry Fried Chicken and Shrimp & Leek Dumplings, everything else we order is pretty much a secondary choice. The service is pretty good for a Chinese restaurant in the city, the servers are serious about turning the tables quick, but not pushy about it.

The main items to get here are the chicken wings and string beans. ?The potstickers are pretty good, but I wouldn't say it's my favorite item (a little too meaty and not enough of the dough to go around). ?Dry noodles (zha jiang mian) and soup-y noodles are good, but I don't think the noodles are hand-made. ?Home-made kimchi was surprisingly spicy, but good.

Very rarely will come a time when I give 5 stars just for one dish And no, it's not or beef, pork, or some exotic fish It's for their dry chicken wings When you bite into it, your taste buds will sing Granted, been here before and had their dumplings And man, I tell ya, they were something. Tasty and delicious, the prices are hard to beat If you're in the city, this is the place to eat. One note during dinner, this place gets CRAZY busy, so make sure you go there early.

My boyfriend and I heard so much about this place that we had to try it. When we went it was hard for us to find the place, then soon realized it was getting renovated; but lucky they temporarily moved it to the gelato place next door. Found out that the gelato place was the son of the owners of San Tung, and the original cook of San Tung! The wait was okay, cause it IS a ice-cream place. We ultimately came for the original dry chicken that everyone raved so much about and ordered the string beans with rice. DELICIOUS. However after a few chicken wings you'll get sick of it cause it was so sweat but definitely tasty. The reason for the 4 stars however was the sitting arrangements, we were sitting in a table for two facing each other, then there was a man sitting by himself FACING/STARING right at us eating while HE ate. Which was uncomfortable for my boyfriend. Overall will come again when they are done renovating their orginal restaurant.

It was a rainy San Francisco day when I chose to isit San Tung and I couldn't believe the line snaking out the door and halfway up the street. I was fortunate that someone pulled out of a parking space directly in front of the restaurant so I added my name to the board in front and waited in my car for thirty minutes. When my friend and I were seated, we went overboard ordering to make that wait worthwhile. The restaurant is no intimeate dining spot. Conversation was impossible with the cacaphony taking place. There are at least fifty tables. Everyone seemed to order the crispy friend chicken wings which we very good in some sort of sweet sauce. I wasn't as impressed with the shrimp and leek dumplings ( I've had so much better ). The chicken won ton soup was delicious - excellent broth - and it certainly hit the spot on a cold, rainy San Francisco day. The combination chow mein, chock full of mushrooms, vegetables and seafood was good as was the "Happy Family" - stir fried beef, chicken, shrimp, calamari, scallops, mussels, broccoli, zucchini, black mushrooms and baby corn in a spicy sauce. Who wouldn't like that combination! We also ordered a shredded porl in garlic sauce, just a hint of spice and some wonderful fungus that was very tasty. Add that to a beef and broccoli dish and, of course, we couldn't finish half of it. I was eating leftover for dinner that night and lunch the next day! Good food, definitely, and it was nice not to brave the Chinatown crowds. I certainly considerd it worth the wait. Visited November 2011 Value

The lines are long, so the trick is to go there early - like 11:30a for lunch. That way you can get seated right away. ?Their dumplings are the best way to go! ?Both the pork and shrimp/chives are delicious. ?I like their wrappers because they are soft and a little chewy. ?We usually order 1 dumpling per person! We don't eat much of anything else when we come here, but here are some of the other dishes that are also good: Fried dry Chicken wings Chow Mein Pan Fried potstickers Ja-jeung mein (noodles with black bean sauce) ========== Review #157

I'm surprised I haven't reviewed this place yet. Yes, it's worth the hype! These wings really are smothered in crack sauce. I love how their dried fried chicken wings USUALLY have a great crisp, and the skin isn't fluffed in a huge batter or anything. The string beans are great as well. You can look at them being picked at the round table of mountain piled beans. I wish they delivered though...but that would probably be impossible with the amount of orders they'd get.

The first time I ate at San Tung was around 1998 or so and I remember that the Srimp and Leak dumplings being really good. So when I was in this area of the city, I wanted to try them out again. ?Had the dumplings which were pretty much just like I remembered, coming to the table steeming hot. ?Just dip them in a bit of soy and a bit of vinegar and enjoy,,,yum. We also had kung pao shrimp and a fried chicken dish that the waiter suggested. ?The latter dish did not come with veggies, just chicken pieces that were coated in flour, fried and some sweet sauce added. I'm not a fan a chinese restaurants that dump a thick sweet sauce on veggies and meat. ?If you want that, you can get it fairly cheap at Panda Express which is not bad when you want quick chinese food. Try Hong Kong Flower in Millbrae, I haven't been there in a while but when I have in the past, they did not smother the food with a sweet sauce.

I've gone to this place a lot of times and I still can't get enough of their dried fried chicken wings (whole not the cut up ones) and their green beans. sooo sooooo good. however, what made this visit even more special was ROB LOWE. yes, ROB LOWE was there and we (me and 3 other people I was with) got to take pics after he was done eating (we didn't want to be too rude now :P ) even after moving to NY there is NOTHING that can compare to these wings :)

My friends and I went here after Bay to Breakers to get something to eat... and all I can say is (which is pretty much what everyone else is saying here) CHICCCCCKEN WINNNGSSS. Crispy, sweet, juicy, hot, nomnom. We also ordered some leek dumplings (okay), fried rice (okay), and some greens (tasted like pine-sol to me though, lol)... I would just come here for the wing-a-dings.

First off, me and my friends were seated at a table that we had to share with another group. Kinda weird because it had one of those spinning things in the middle, so I was how we are gonna do this? But it was like whatever, cause the group that we sat with didn't talk much. They give you hot tea, and an appetizer, which was kinda of like kimchi but I felt like the lettuce wasn''t super pickled like kimchi normally was, but it was okay and SUPER SPICY NO JOKE. okay not like death spicy but BAM that was spicy. When the waiter took our order, I felt a bit rushed, i did, but I guess its normal because asian restaurants are always fast paced. It was our first time here and we didn't know what to order, so we just decided to order two plates of chicken, when we told the waiter he was kind of like rude. He said we had two each order a minimum seven dollar plate, with an attitude. I was like okay we didnt know, cause they didn't say that anywhere on the menu, or not that I saw. But, after all that mess, we ended up ordering 3 plates of the chicken wings (2 dry and 1 wet), and a bowl of those black bean noodles. Let me say, that chicken was AMAZING, no joke, cannot even compare to wingstop and smokeeaters, it was so crunchy and the sauce was relish, for the dry one. The wet was good too, but I prefer the dry way more because of the crunchiness. We were all sad, because we felt like we shouldve just order four plates of dry chicken wings. The black bean noodle thing was alright, the flavor was not really there. But those chicken wings dude, you guys gotta try it, it is crazy (DRY DRY CHICKEN WINGS). Haha dry and wet sounds weird right? They shouldve described it as saucy and crispy :)

Came here after running the Nike Women's 2011 half marathon. Woot! Worth the wait!!! Hot sour soup - decent. good, not great. Shrimp n leeks dumpling ?- yummy! Potstickers = HUGE potstickers. these were ok. Wet fried chicken - good, tasty, and just a little more saucy. Pork Dumplings - yummy! Dry Black Bean sauce noodles - omg so good! Dry fried chicken - MY FAVORITE!!!! Man this place is too good. Too bad it's so far, and the wait is always so long.

NOM NOM NOM!!! Oh my goodness! That dry fried chicken is amazing! First initial bite, the cripsy, sweet, tangy fried chicken took over my taste buds! They must've put a lot of sugar in that sauce though cause that thing literally gets stuck to your teeth! And it actually takes some effort to get it off! And the seafood fried rice. I didn't believe my friend when he said it was hella "wet" hahah and it was!! How can fried rice be juicy!?!?!? I don't know. But you gotta try it!

I went here for the first time today, and I was pretty satisfied. It might just be some of the best Chinese food I've had state-side. And like everyone else says, this place is ALL about the dry fried chicken (which is, in fact, wet and sticky - go figure). Get anything else and you will be okay - satisfied. But if you want to be more than satisfied - happy, ecstatic even, make sure to get the dry chicken wings. Even after they were done I was scooping the sauce onto my fried rice. The only thing to beware of is that this place is BUSY. They don't take reservations, and on a friday night this place was bustling, with people spilling out the door. Plan a little extra time to get a table, and send a scout in early to get on the list, if possible.

If you are ever in Sunset and you find yourself craving for delicious Chinese food, stop by San Tung! Write your name on the whiteboard and cross your fingers that it won't take any longer than 30 minutes to get a table... the longest I waited was 50 minutes for a table of 3 on a busy, crowded Friday night. I went on a Tuesday night at 8:00 and waited for 30 minutes for a table of 2. The Dry Fried Chicken Wings dish is the most popular item on the menu, and it is easily one of the most flavorful chicken wings I've ever had. It's a nice balance between sweet and tangy, and it comes out hot and crispy. Highly recommended! I find myself craving these wings ALL the time now. The dried sautéed green beans were also very tasty. On two separate occasions I tried the soups. The tomato egg soup was very good. The service here is really fast, essentially because because the wait staff really wants to get you in and out as soon as possible in order to accomodate the crowd of people waiting to get a table. This is a no-frills restaurant... just really good food. If you want to take your date to somewhere romantic, then look elsewhere... but if you want delicious Chinese food and you don't mind the atmosphere, look no further! It really is as delicious as they say.

My iPhone finally checked me in right as I walked into a locked door with a huge "CLOSED WEDNESDAYS" sign that I am pretty sure I would have seen if the damn phone didn't take forever to process. ?I parked on 9th and walked in the cold for this?! I was really looking forward to snort the crack-laced wings that everyone and their moms are raving about, but I guess I'll just have to wait for my next fix; I drove back on Irving, saw a friggin KFC and started having withdrawal symptoms. Not a problem. ?My own dumb fault of course. ?Will leave 4 stars for now to not affect an apparently amazing establishment's rep, but will come back on a non-Wednesday to seal the deal. ?peace

Dumplings noodles, dumplings noodles! I LOVE San Tung!! Shanghai food at its best :) *heart heart*!! Dumplings: I love ALL their dumplings here, fried or steamed. The pork one is my favorite (steamed), but the shrimp and leak one is also a very good alternative (for you vegetarians out there). I always get their fried pork ones as well, but they are HUGE, so don't order too much of it. Wings: Everyone gets their Chicken wings here. I'm not a huge chicken wings fan so maybe thats why I'm not crazy about them, but people go NUTS over them. You've got to try them once .. just dont blame me if you get addicted to them :) Noodles: OMG where do I start?? Their dry black bean sauce noodle is VERY good, but its not exactly like ja jern meen if that's what you're looking for, but still VERY tasty. Noodles with peanut sauce is one of my favorites. It has nuts, seafood, green peas, and a very thick pasted sweet peanut sauce on top. The three delux spicy noodle sauce is also very tasty if like spicy food. The beef soup noodles is BOMB - moneyyyy! I've also tried their ma po tofu (spicy) and I couldnt finish it because it was too spicy, but it was good :)

A friend of mine raved about this hole in the wall in the Inner Sunset/Golden Gate Heights area of San Francisco. The dry fried chicken is so good, that you can't stop eating it! I don't normally like sweet sauces, but theirs was exceptional! The recipe is online and my brother made it for Christmas, but it's never totally the same! If you're ever in the area, try it, but be prepared to wait a bit for a table. We were there for a late lunch on a Sunday and the wait was no more than 30 minutes, which is not bad at all. With 4 kids, however, it feels twice as long!

My personal mantra at San Tung: Wings first. Gym later. As such, the best four words of advice that I can give to anyone that goes here: Order. The. Chicken. Wings. Sure, the other items I've tried on the menu are good (the black bean noodles, steamed pork dumplings, and sauteed string beans), but for me, it's ALL about the wings. Crispy, deep-fried, and covered in a savory sweet-gingery-garlicky sauce, you'd be a fool to pass these up. Whenever I go to San Tung with my friends, I can't help but notice the chatter die down at our table as the number of chicken wings on our plate quickly dwindles to a single piece. Now typically, I'm the type of person that is nice enough to let my friends fight over the last bit of anything on food we share, but when it comes down to the last piece of a San Tung chicken wing, I do NOT hold back. I will fight tooth and nail (and fork) to have that last wing, and NO ONE will stop me. (joking, sorta) But honestly, these wings are so GOOD that I'm not ashamed to look like a total fatty in front of my friends and ask for that last piece. Most important things to note: 1. Parking around Irving, no matter how early (or late) never fails to suck. I suggest dropping off your family or friend(s) at this place while you park so that they can hold a table or write down their name on the waiting list. 2. If there happens to be a wait (which there typically is), the waitlist is located on the right of the door on the wall when you enter. Just write your name and number of people on the whiteboard and wait outside to be called. 3.The bathrooms here are clean - which is especially good to know since you'll most likely need to wash off that sticky chicken wing sauce from your hands after your meal.

The original dried fried chicken/ shrimp is sooo good. If you want chinese food, this place will def satisfy. Although the service wasn't the best, but the food makes up for it. Next time I go, I'm gonna try a different dish. The place is a little cramped and the wait is pretty long during peak dinner hours. However they're gonna do a remodeling so hopefully they free up the place a bit. Prepare to look hard for a parking spot during peak dinner time!

Close to an hour wait for a table of 6. Salivating as we stood in line surrounded by plates of chicken wings. The chicken wings were very tasteful, sweet, and a bit tangy..reminds me of General Tsao Chicken/Dry Braised Chicken/General Chicken put together...(my family used to own a mandarin/szechuan restaurant so I found this sauce to be a similar combination to all of those dishes listed above) We compared the chicken wings (with bones) to the chicken cutlets (no bones) and came to a mutual conclusion that the ones with the bones are WAY better! Cutlets are for those that enjoy heavily battered chicken. Black bean sauce noodles were okay, could barely taste the flavor. Would not recommend the veggie dumplings! And the only sad thing was that they brought out our green beans after we finished ALL of our entrees so it was pointless to eat a side dish last. Kim Chi complimentary starter was a plus! All in all, the chicken wings are very delicious and the aroma will get you for sure!

I went there on a date and even though the wait was horrendous, the food was delicious. ?I got there 10 minutes early because I'm used to riding my bike over there and overestimated the amount of time that was needed. ?Thank goodness I got there when I did because it took 40 minutes to be seated. ?I remembered it had a long wait but I didn't think would that bad at 8pm. I ordered dried fried chicken (of course!) and he ordered. Mongolian beef. ?I was too nervous to really eat, which is kinda sad because I can out eat a lot of people for my short body. ?I don't know. ?It just felt like a lie. ?The food is consistently good and waiters are bit pushy. ?It kinda adds to the ambiance of the place.

On cold and foggy Bay Area nights, I sometimes recall and recount tales of this place's chicken wings. ?I don't even like chicken wings. ?But, here, I do. ? I've brought friends to San Tung. ?I've brought family to San Tung. ?Never has there been a place so universally liked. ?We've been there several times, and most of the menu is good fare, but not amazing. ?I don't think we've ever ordered something we didn't like or thought was bland, which is unusual. ? For most of the dishes, 3.5-4 stars would suffice. ?The food is a little more authentic than your average Chinese place -- you'll find fewer of the typical brown and clear sauces, which are instead replaced with more flavorful, if similar-looking, counterparts. ? But...those wings. ?I've ordered wings at other places and the lack of meat/flavor on them usually disappoints. ?Not here. ?The flavor is so heavenly that you've got to wonder whether they came from chickens....or perhaps from some sort of divine winged creatures... Probably the best Chinese food I've had in either SF or LA. ?Only one place could have compared overall dish-wise (nothing compares to San Tung's wings), and it's Great China in Berkeley (currently closed due to a fire, set to reopen sometime in 2013). ?They're very different places, though, and it's hard to compare the two.

Wings are one of my favorite things to eat. ?Fried, salt & pepper, buffalo, cajun, you name it, I'll eat it. ?I don't know why it took me so long...After 4+ years of living in the bay, I finally made it to San Tung for the highly raved Dry Fried Chicken Wings. ?We must have gotten lucky because we only waited for half an hour tops for a table and we didn't have to share our table with strangers. ? I of course studied the menu prior to coming so I knew exactly what I wanted to order. ?One order of the famous wings, Ja Jyung Mein and String Beans. ?I munched on the complimentary Kim Chee while I eye raped other people's food on their tables. The string beans were the first to arrive and as I bit into the first string bean I was NOT blown away. ?Overcooked and the flavor was a bit too sweet. ? At least the Ja Jyung Mein (black bean sauce Korean noodles) lived up to the hype. ?Best Ja Jyung Mein I've had so far (not saying much since this is only the 2nd place). ?Tasty black bean sauce with shrimp, pork and fresh julienned cucumber topped home made noodles. ?It's a very simple dish and can be a complete failure if the sauce is tasteless. ?It just looks like a pile of goop if you don't know how to eat it. ?You have to mix the noodles and the sauce together before eating. ?I really loved this dish as the sauce was tasty and the noodles were perfectly chewy and al dente. The wings finally arrived at our table and I was salivating just looking at it. ?It's a beauty as you can see the crispy batter on the wings and the famous salty, spicy, sweet sauce mixed with ginger, garlic, and red peppers glazed over the wings giving it a delicious looking shine. ?They tasted as good as they looked. ?Perfect crunch, delicious taste, moist and juicy. ?What amazed me the most was how well the crispy crunch held on the wings. ?Even towards the end of the meal, the wings were still crunchy even though there was sauce on them. ? We finished every wing and the whole bowl of Ja Jyung Mein. ?The plate of string beans looked untouched. ?I've definitely had better elsewhere. ?But why 3 stars only? ?As good as these wings are, they get a little heavy and I can't see myself craving them as other people do, deeming it the nickname "crack wings". ?Based on the beans, I have a feeling that most of their menu other than the wings & noodles are going to be mediocre. ?Until the next time I crave "crack wings" and try other things on the menu, my stars will remain at 3.

I have been going to this place for so many years now but now that I am finally on the yelping scene, I'll write my review. Let's start off with the service. One of the servers loves us and he always asks how we are doing and bringing us a bowl of soup! Food: Dry Fried Chicken: Here is a little secret in ordering the dry fried chicken. Most people order it wings but I love ordering it diced. It seems like there is so much MORE chicken for diced! Pork dumplings: these little buggers are full of flavor and so delicious. The best sauce for this is: 2 parts soy sauce, 1 parts vinegar and a splash of chili sauce for a little pzazz. Chicken fried rice: the chicken is very moist and not dry at all. The portion is pretty decent as well. The only thing I can say bad about this place is that there are so many people that it takes a while during lunch and dinner hours. Remember to write your name on the little white board right when you walk in to minimize the wait. *HINT*: the white board is on the wall on the right side when u walk in the door.

Dry Chicken Wings - Hell yes x 100. ? - They are still covered in sauce so they are not "dry". ?But what makes them extra awesome is that they are still crispy underneath. ?The wet ones are not crispy thus dry is better. Everything else is pretty good here with large portions. ?But what makes this place constantly have a huge line outside is the wings. ?If it is place is packed and the line is gigantic just order some dry chicken wings to go and you will still have a magical day.

I don't have a lot of experience with chinese food, but the chinese food that i do have experience with is often greasy, with strange cubes of hot pink colored meat, and the alluring scent of msg wafting up from the plate. San tung is NOT that. I ate here for the first time on saturday and ate so much that i had to pull thee old unbutton-the-top-button of-the-pants trick in order to breathe. ?We had: two orders of the amazing chicken, mu shu pork, sizzling rice soup, green beans, sweet and sour pork, braised flounder, curry beef, and some other things i can't even remember, and it was AMAZING. We showed up at 11 a.m. when it opened, and by the time we left around 12:30 there was a large line out the door, and i can see why. Thanks for finally showing me what good chinese food is, San Tung.

San Tung has many great dishes, but let's be real, their true treasure is the original fried dry chicken wings. The marinade on the chicken is a perfect balance of sweetness and flavor. Perfect with white rice and a plate of vegetables. Their customer service is speedy and accurate. The line may be out the doors sometimes but people come in and out quick. San Tung is a must try for people who love chicken wings. I've never tasted anything quite like it.

They could work on the customer service a bit more. ?Outside of that the wings are as good as people in other reviews have said. ?I came in around 2 and had to wait for about 15 minutes for one. ?I ended up being seated at a large table with an older couple and another individual but that was cool. ?I ordered the dry wing lunch combo which include rice, 8 wings, and a small hot & sour soup. ?They can have the soup because it tasted horribly bland. ?No amount of salt and pepper could save it. ?The complementary kimchi was really tasty. ?In addition to the wings, I also got the shrimp and leek dumplings. ?That was a favorite also. ?Maybe next time I'll try the string beans dish (forgot the name of the dish). ?Once again really good wings, I had to order some to go for later. ?Definitely will return when I'm in the area. ?Thanks Jimmy C. for the recomendation.

When you walk in the door of San tung, they ask you "how many?" with a look that says "why the f@ck are YOU here, you as$hole?" Seriously. Never have I been somewhere with such rude service. The wings ARE great as is the mu shu. At this point, to me the rude service is part of the price if you want those amazing sticky wings. One time the waiter knocked over my friend's soda with his elbow, spilling it all over her. He rolled his eyes at her and looked at her like it was her fault. no apology. No effort to help her out. But seriously the food is really good. Be prepared to wait a long time on busy nights.

SAN TUNG, famous for the dry chicken wings and that they should. ? I use to come here quite often with my friend when i was still living in the city, but why did I not review this place earlier? well better late than never.. right?! My recent trip here was with a few first timers(sister and cousins).. came here around dinner time and you know what dinner time means (hard to find parking and a long wait) :( but it was all worth it you can't expect much in customer service, but this is where their dishes make them. to be exact its their ..... DRY chicken wings which are delicious! we also got the WET chicken wings, hmm good but not comparable to the dry. black bean noodle... another delicious item on the menu and since we wanted to order some greens we got the sautee green beans and the broccoli beef dish. :) all this between 4 girls? yikes! we definitely over orders! but you gotta love family style! plenty of left overs for sure.

If you have read other reviews (and my previous one)... after all these years, I still can't find anything better than their chicken wings. ?During Christmas time, I went there again and found out those special chicken wing comes in nuggets! ?Say hey! ?Great news for lazy bum like me. ?No more bone chewing (My sons both agreed). Interesting enough, my son really like the chicken fried rice. ?I'd like to recommend it as well since it does some how taste different and taste pretty good... especially when freshly served. ?Must be the MSG. The noodle is awesome! ?I've mentioned the noodle was average and frankly, the soup base is kind of average but the texture is awesome! ? I've been around to many noodle shops, this one has one of the best texture EVER! ?You know what I mean if you have tried it. ?Not soggy, in fact, kind of Al dente. ?I loved it! ? Service is so bad... and the place is so busy... I just hope take out does taste as good. ?One thing I do want to point out, I've ordered these wings for take out a few times, ask them to put the sauce aside, so you can still toast up the chicken and heat the sauce at home... pour it in, just like fresh made. ? Bon Appetit

Dried fried chicken FTW! I followed my sister who lived in SF for a couple years to this Chinese restaurant in the Sunset area. It's right across the street from another Chinese restaurant but what makes this stand out is the dried fried chicken. The best way for me to describe it is a spicier version of Korean fried chicken drumettes. One order is good for 2-3 people, depending on how hungry you are. We also got the string beans and noodles with beef. The second time around, I had my son with me so he just ate the noodles because he doesn't like spicy. It gets crowded so be prepared to wait and even share a round table. But it'll be worth it.

San Tung is my favorite chinese restaurant in the inner sunset. Every single time I come here I never walk away unsatisfied. Our group favorites include the hot and sour soup, the vegetarian dumplings, mongolian beef, kung pao chicken, and of course the famous dry fried chicken wings. Usually when I love a place once I go back and its not the same as my memory served. But this place always lives up to my fat kid memories. The service is speedy. And do not expect to be pampered. They want you in and they want you out. But do not be turned off by this. Its a common occurrence at chinese restaurants. Expect to wait in a long line if its lunch or dinner. Be it a Tuesday or a Sunday. We once waited 2 hours on Christmas Day to get a table. Parking is a tuffy so carpool if you can.

There is always a huge long line out of this place. I've eaten there once and, I don't know, I didn't think it was all that great. It's cheap though. I think that's why everyone comes! We had a party of 10 and the waiter was super super rude (like to the point of it being laughable) and impatient. The sauce for the wings was good. I had a green bean dish that was good/ok--nothing to rave about. Good food, nothing to get super excited about.

This place would not survive in LA. The beef noodle soup sucked!!! Expensive and bland for what it is. String beans were fine and fresh and they took over an entire family dining table in the middle of the restaurant to process them (How authentically Asian of them). Pork dumpling was unimpressive and a bit soggy, meaning that they boiled it for way too long. The "dried" fried chicken seems to be their signature dish and it was delicious. Reminds me of honey BBQ chicken from KFC but with an Asian twist. Come here before 5:30pm for dinner or you'll be crowded with all the other lemmings for this mediocre place. Rumble on in the Inner Sunset (or Eastern Mountain which is what San Tung means).

Over 2000 reviews?!?! ?Wow, that's a lot of chicken wings. ?Which is what everyone seems to be raving about. ?Including myself. The sweet and spicy sauce doesn't seem to be any sort of magical concoction, but it is when paired with the fantastically crispy, deep fried wings that creates a delicious cacophony of flavours and textures. ?There's some sort of weird, mystical element to that dish that compels you to perpetually pop another wing or leg into your mouth, one after the other, in some sort of futile attempt to satisfy a craving that cannot be quenched. I was also a big fan of the dumplings, but less so impressed with their noodle offerings. ?But pile up a table before me full of their wings and dumplings? ?You will find before you a very very happy happy man indeed.

What can I say that hasn't been said 899 times before me? This is my favorite (on-the-cheap) chinese restaurant that I have tried so far and I usually eat here at least 3 times a month. Just like every other review, I can't walk into this establishment without ordering the Dry Fried Chicken, although I order it DICED, rather than the WINGS. I'll try the Wings one of these days. Their Mongolian Beef is very tender and so damn good! I haven't tried anything else on their menu because when I'm there I must have the aforementioned items. I think this may actually be the most boring review that I've ever written. Sorry It's snot funny

San Tung is one of the few places in the Inner Sunset, outside of Ebisu - that consistently has a line outside of it. It could be raining, freezing, or a slow weekday - and San Tung is still bursting with eager eaters - pining for their dry fried chicken wings. There isn't much to be said for ambiance, you'll probably find yourself sharing a table with people you've never met before, and the waiters will probably unleash some attitude with your food, but San Tung may just be worth the hassle. Their menu is extensive - and you really can't go wrong with the veggie dumplings, the chicken wings, the string beans, the sizzling rice soup, the homemade noodles, and the pot-stickers. Just be sure to come with an open mind about the wait, study up the Yelp reviews - before you step inside, and don't forget your appetite.

I'll kick your ass! I got my ass kicked! You kick ass! Those 3 lines are totally different. It took me long time to find out that "ass" and the "kick" meaning. And the 3 lines really well with the word like "FXXX" or "SHIT". Using "FXXX" was very difficult for me too. So, I didn't know "KickAss" can be able to use as an adjective. But when I eat the 5 spices beef noodle soup, I said, " WHAT A KICKASS noodle soup!!!" Talking about craving, a powerful desire for Great Flavor. The noodle is THE BEST Chinese noodle makes me feel a powerful desire for. The broth was really Hot, dark, has such a deep rich and thick but not too heavy taste, PERFECT. The Flat egg noodle was al dente, PERFECT. The Flesh spinach was NOT OVER COOKED even the soup was really hot, PERFECT! The 5 spiced Beef, ?OMG it's Suji-Niku! nicely cooked, tender, thin sliced, PERFECT. How do you say Suji-niku in English? The store is very clean. The wait staff are very good and sharp. Great Awesome Food. The Best noodle ever. They serve free KimChee flavor cabbage. it was good. I really felt that finding a root of Real Asian cuisine here, including Japanese. I can't wait to go back. It's a KICKASS noodle soup! The noodle KICK your ASS really well. This place KickAss. This place Kick your Ass. You'll get ass kick..... no..... No, No. I just want to say that I am happy, so happy to find a great Authentic Chinese restaurant, that's all. For more info, see Ken K's KICKASS review. Btw, Ken K said, "Suji-Niku" - roughly speaking probably tendon meat. I used to think it was "meat near the bone" but probably flank cut that has strips of tendon inside is more accurate. Probably closest thing to suji nikomi, but Chinese version with noodles. Sushi Sam's does a good suji nikomi appetizer, very pricey, small portion, but sexcellent (his wife makes it). OHHHH, Suji-Nikomi!!! That's Dote-Yaki in Osaka, Japan!!!

It's da Beef-No' Guy here! If San Tung got into a fight with the Superfriends of Chinese restaurants of Yank Sing, Ton Kiang, Just Won Ton, King Of Won Ton, ?House of Nan King (H.O.N.K), Panda Express (PanEx), PFC (PF Chang's), Yan C*nt (Martin Yan's chain), ?San Tung could take them all with one hand tied behind his back, use his other hand to execute a Street Fighter HADOKEN fireball and OBLITERATE their a$$e$ into oblivion. ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ?

(flexing muscles) ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? \~|~/ ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ?/ \ Seriously folks, even http://wikipedia.org describes Chinese food to be broken down into the cuisines of ?Anhui, Cantonese, Fujian, Hunan, Jiangsu, Szechuan, Zhejiang, and Shandong, of which San Tung is easily SF Bay Area's MASTER of Shandong. While I have yet to eat at the Oakland version of this restaurant, there's absolutely NOTHING south of here that even compares. For those who put down San Tung you either - don't like this style of Chinese food - ordered the wrong things - think there are better places (if so I'd love to know the equivalent and where) - hate the long lines, lack of parking in the area, and having to wait with fellow eater$ who love this food way more than you do -think this place is KOREAN CHINESE (I am so sick of this term, just call it Shandong cuisine, OK?) and all you know is ja jang mien or Jar Jar Binks. I've been going here on and off since the early 90s, just like Jason G and ton$ of ardent fan$, when this place was originally a hole in a wall further down Irving near the 20s. One of the waiters is the son of either the chef or owner. I remember him as a high school kid helping out and he's all grown up and still there! Back then there was already a huge wait if you did not get there in time. $an Tung's noodles and dumplings and cold appetizers have ALWAYS hit the spot. They had to open up San Tung #2 which is currently the only remaining location, to accomodate more customers and higher volume. While quality and the atmosphere suffered a wee bit, nobody has surpassed this Food Street Fighter King. While the menu has a good wide variety, there are a few classics I have never deviated away from, because they represent the pinnacle of Northern Chinese and arguably Taiwanese type of comfort food, great for any occa$$ion. Here's a compilation of what I've tried and re-ordered* time after time again dan dan noodles - San Tung's take on a Sichuanese classic, but this tasted nothing like what it should be. Not as much peanut flavor and something that was like either edamame and tofu in it. Weird. Good noodles as always dried fried chicken wings - maybe not KFC (Korean fried chicken) but a variant of Chinese fried chicken that's honey sweet and a bit of a spicy kick. pork and cabbage dumplings* - as good as some Shandong noodles and dumplings shop in Taipei, Taiwan, and better than the chain shops over there! Don't let the foolz tell you otherwise. I dare say I enjoy these a lot more than Kingdom of Dumplings which are even further Northern (in China) style wise. The skins have great bounce and always a pleasure. cold 5 spice beef appetizer* - thinly sliced and perfectly marinated beef flank (with tendons inside). The marination is not as salty as Beijing style, and the 5 spices marination fragrance is good. Order a plate of this and dunk it in the beef noodle soup for SEXTRA plea$ure. 5 Spice Beef Noodle Soup* - sorry naysayers, this is actually my #1 favorite beef noodle soup of all time in the Bay Area. GASP you say, A$J and A&J not close? Sorry no. The noodles here are unmistakenably classic Northern Chinese Shandong style La Mien, regardless if they were machine cut (but yes it tastes EXACTLY the way it should. Maybe Four Seasons in SJ (Korean Chinese cough cough) came close, but ST does it the best. The slurp factor of these noodles are out of this world, mildly chewy and refreshingly light, way better than the "best" ramen places (flame me go ahead, and face the wrath of San Tung). The beef tendon and flank (with strips of tendon inside) are amazing, even if not as sexy looking as some of my profile pics. OK the broth is inconsistent here, and not as deep or thick as other places, but when it is not salty, it's still good. Spinach is always a nice touch. Marinated pig's ear - not bad. ?Everyday Beijing and Little Shanghai (San Mateo) do a better version. Good thick slices though. Marinated dried tofu strips - very nice rendition. The 5 spice flavors sink deep for a variant take on a classic. And yeah, their in house marinated pao tsai (kim chee). It's not like the Korean version. It tastes very fermented but also very sweet and crunchy with a strong spice kick (no sour flavor, strangely). I luv this $tuff! Nothing beats good ol' comfort $hizzle

- Z E R O - I WAS regular customer of San Tung, & been coming here for years. ?Frank is great, extremely friendly. ?And yes, Dry-Fried Chicken and Pot Stickers are the best. ?FYI, don't ever send anything back, even if you don't like it. ?They yell the shit out of their staff. We are regulars & always order the same thing, as we are creatures of habit. We ordered our usual Dry-Fried Chicken lunch special, and the Pot Stickers, something new: Braised Tofu Pork. Everything was going fine. ?We are used to the fact that the Pot Stickers come toward the end of the meal...that was fine, because they are great regardless of what part of the meal they end up coming out. ?The first thing that came out was the Braised Bean Curd with Pork. ?Unfortunately, Angie and I both agree'd that it wasn't what we were expecting, so we told Frank's brother that we would like to exchange this dish as we felt like we ordered the wrong thing. ?He responded by saying "Well, did you order it?" ?In response, I say "Yes, we did, but it turned out to be something we didn't really like." ?He then continues on to say, "You have to talk to your server." I found this extremely odd and rude especially since we know who he is. ?But whatever, we end up telling our server that we ordered the wrong thing from the menu, and didn't like it. ?We instead wanted to exchange it for the Shredded Pork with Garlic Sauce, another usual that we get. ? Once mentioning that we wanted to switch our order, the server says to us that he needs to talk to the "manager" which I thought was completely weird because Frank wasn't there that day, but his rude brother was, so I knew from that moment on, that this was going to be a hassle. ?To my surprise, our server comes back to us and says that they will switch our dish. Great! I was actually very surprised about this, as I know from past experience that Chinese restaurants are usually quite difficult in this situation. Dry-Fried Chicken comes out, Pot Stickers come out, ?d e l i c i o u s. ?But it's what happened next from Frank's brother that completely blows my mind away. ?And this will forever be the absolute W O R S T ?experience in my history of eating out: ? Frank's brother comes to our table with a to-go menu and explains to us that their are descriptions of what is in the dish listed on the menu. ?I respond to him saying "Yes, I know, but we ordered the wrong thing, and it wasn't what we expected." ? From this point on, his response and actions toward us were absolutely ?UNACCEPTABLE! ?He continues on to say "Well, you got your waiter in trouble because he had to bring the dish back." ?At this moment, I was extremely in shock that he was blaming us for the server getting in trouble. ?My response to him was that " Yes, it was our fault that we ordered the wrong thing, and that the waiter really SHOULDN'T be getting into trouble because he DIDN'T do anything wrong at all. ?That is completely insane, that a manager would get mad at the waiter, because the customer ordered something they didn't like. I further mentioned to Frank's brother the server really shouldn't be getting into trouble for our mistake on ordering something wrong. ?But he continues on to argue with us about the fact that the waiter is in trouble. ?My first thing is " I'm sorry, but why are you coming up to us and telling us the waiter is in trouble in the first place." How is a customer to fucking feel? All we wanted to do was fucking eat, and he kept standing there, yapping. Having parents who own a restaurant here in San Francisco, I know first hand, that it's very important to keep your customers-- regular and new--HAPPY. ?The food industry in general is quite difficult to be in. ?So I know, exactly how hard it is. ?But I also understand the fact that there are times when a customer might not like what they ordered, and would like something else. ?Never in a million years would I blame one of our customers for ordering the wrong dish. I mention this to him. Frank's brother was insanely out of line from this moment on. ?He continues to fight with us, and I continue to agree with the fact that it was our fault for ordering something we didn't like. ?I don't even know why this was an issue at all. ? I made the decision that I really HAD to leave and escape this terrible experience of an employee attacking us for getting the waiter in trouble...of course in my mind, he shouldn't have. ? Upon getting up to leave, he states to us "Good, if you ever come back here, I'm gonna throw you out." I throw my napkin in his face while leaving. ?He continues to yell at us, making me call him ?"Fat son of a bitch" as he literally is, while walking out. ?My sister upset as well flicks him off with her middle finger, & tells him to tell Frank we're never coming back. ? I will forever have this experience of San Tung, once a favorite of mine, now the stamped with the reputation of having the WORST restaurant sevice

At long last, I have had the famous Dry Fried Chicken Wings at San Tung. At first, I picked them up with my chopsticks and delicately nibbled on them. Before too long, I got my hands into it. By wing #3, I was virtually motorboating those things. ?Chopsticks in one hand, end of the wing in other hand - and a blur of motion and happy noises. When my plate was finished, I had sticky sweet sauce all over my mouth and hands. ?I licked my fingers. ? I paid my $7 (wings, rice, soup and tea). I left in a daze, already dreaming of when I might have them again. ?Hooked!

Clearly a Sunset institution, there is always a big wait. Came by last night (Thursday) around 8:30ish and still had to hang on for 30 minutes, on the weekends I hear this can stretch to hours. Followed some Yelper recommendations and went with the pork dumplings, the fried chicken, the asparagus, and some hot and sour soup. All were pretty tasty, but I can't say I had a knock-your-socks-off-this-is-worth-the-wait experience. Chicken was delicious, but it's fried chicken, hard not to be! We were seated at a giant round table along with another random group which added to our fun since they turned out to be friendly dermatologists (scored some free Botox out of the deal, ha no I didn't, but maybe I should have!).

I'm a chink - and this is the place I take my parents to when they visit. ?They love it here - fresh thick homemade noodles, amazing dumplings and wontons, and fried chicken wings. With service that makes you feel like you're in China. It's all about food yo. ?If I could give more than 5 stars, I would. All other chinese restaurants in the city pale in comparison to San Tung. Also try So - same owners/food but smaller portions, hipper ambiance, and good for those (Wednesday?) nights when San Tung is closed.

Okay, seeing the hype about this place I set my eyes on this place. The wait was ridiculous but I assumed that it was worth it. After 20 mins with my name written on the white board, I was seated. I ended up sharing a table with 2 other parties.. but hey it beats waiting right? I solely ordered the dried chicken wings. For $10.30 you get 12 saucy, crunchy, flavorful and savory wings. Each bite was tender and succulent. Make sure you have the skin with your meat otherwise the meat will be lacking in flavor. The sauce was claimed to be spicy but it wasn't at all. In fact it was somewhat sweet like honey glazed. The wings reminded me of sticky wings at Dallas BBQ in NYC. I wouldn't say these wings are a life changing experience or mind blowing but they were really finger lickin' good and that's what you're here for right?

Chose to come here at 1pm on New Years eve. BAD IDEA Parking was horrible. Drove 5-6 blocks around the area for 30+ minutes to find parking. Finally settled on Lincoln and 14th but never again will I come on a weekend ?during the middle of lunch. I hate looking for parking in busy areas and it was just a nightmare. Almost decided to just go home instead. Next time I would rather come super or early or late. OR take public transportation. Anyways, on to the food. There was 3 of us and we ordered 3 dishes. It was a good amount of food for the three of us and we paid $12 each at the end. - the dried fried chicken wings Its covered in a very sweet sticky sauce that is finger licking good. Great dish if you're not concerned about your arteries. ? ? - the dried fried string beans Pretty sured these were deep fried too but sooo good. Can't have this everyday either though. Sauce was delicious, similar to the chicken sauce but I didn't really care enough to seriously compare them. Got a crispy unidentified thing with a string bean that was delicious but I couldn't really identify what it was because my energy had been wasted on trying to find parking. - zha jiang mian/black bean sauce noodles (dry) Kinda bland compared to the chicken and string beans. Veggies in it were clearly deep fried as well because it was saturated with oil and because it also left a pool of oil in the bowl. I liked the noodles though. Perfectly cooked but that sauce was a real disappointment. We didn't finish it. As it got colder more oil appeared. Not great. Wouldn't recommend it. Conclusion- string beans and chicken were finger licking good but this is definitely an once a year kind of thing for those who are concerned with their health. Atmosphere- super loud, I mean, my energy for the day was already spent looking for parking and I did not want to have to raise my voice to talk to people sitting just across from me.

I BELIEVE IN YELP. ?As I say those four words, I stand with my hand on my heart, ?facing my computer, clutching my gas-x. ? And because I believe in Yelp, I will probably try San Tung again even though I've been - let's call it queasy - since eating a very mediocre, not very cheap lunch here yesterday. ? There are eight steamed pot stickers to an order, and I left four of them uneaten. ?I then made the mistake of ordering kung pao shrimp and although the taste wasn't horrible, it wasn't that good either. Unfortunately I couldn't eat it because it smelled like a Planned Parenthood exam room at the end of a busy day. ?Thankfully Andrew T. saved the meal from being a complete disaster by ordering the decent dry fried chicken. Four stars after over one thousand reviews. ?That's a lot of yelpers who've enjoyed a really good meal here. I wish I'd been one of them. ? * foooftt! * oops! so embarrassing - sorry!

After waiting to go to this place for months, I finally got the chance to try what everyone has been raving about, their wings. ?I must say, i wasn't disappointed. Original Dry fried wings. Some of the best wings I've ever had. ?I could probably eat that stuff everyday and not get sick of it. Pork dumplings were good, nothing special. ?I'm just giving this place 5 stars for their wings. ?The service was okay, but mediocre service is expected at asian restaurants. ? *If you get there after 6pm, good luck with the wait.

[M]ona: 3 Stars [W]ayne 3.5 Stars Average: 3.25 Stars + Good Chicken Wings + Accepts Credit Cards - No Parking - Long Wait - Crampy - Not a good place to eat if you can't handle spicy [W] Ok we'll get all the negatives out first. NO PARKING, long wait times, and can be VERY crowded and noisy. People always tell me that this is the place to be to get dumplings and kimchee. Honestly for me, their dumplings don't really hit the spot for my palate. Also their kimchee is a hit and miss. Sometimes it's really good, and sometimes it's really bad. Good as in just spicy and sweet enough for you to crave more. Sometimes it's sooooo damn spicy you can't even eat and taste anything. So I have mixed feelings about that. [M] This time, Wayne and I shared their Dry Fried Chicken Wings http://www.yelp.com/biz_… and Spicy Beef with Baby Cornshttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/M0JTO3oyu6gxh1?mfFjU-dA?select=nXQohgrc61CcrI1XZ3I2Tg. The two dishes were actually pretty good and wouldn't mind ordering them again. The wings were nice and crispy as usual and with a sweet honey glaze on the skin. You can also order them without the glaze. The beef was juicy and tender but a little on the spicy side. [W] Try this place out if you like spicy foods because they have quite a few dishes that have some kick to it. Just make sure you go at a time when they're not busy, which is rare other than in the late afternoon. Also remember to ask for a lot of water because that kimchee will kick you in the butt!

Since the first review, we dined here many times and all good experiences! ?The last time we went here we were once again lucky and snagged a parking spot nearby. ?I know how hard it is to get parking in these neighborhoods....it can be hell and this area is no exception! ?If I lived in the city, I would just take the muni. Here is what we tried recently: 1. Pork Dumplings - 12 little white dumplings filled with ground pork, napa cabbage & seasoned with fresh ginger and garlic 2.Three Deluxe Spicy Sauce Noodles - stir fried shrimp, calamari, scallops, zucchini strips and onions in a spicy sauce served over homemade noodles 3. Tomato Eggflower Soup - shrimp, mushrooms, peas, spinach, , diced tomatoes in an egg flower drop soup 4. Curry Beef - stir fried tender beef in a rich yellow curry sauce with bell peppers and carrot coins. 5. Dry Fried Chicken - we opted for the wings - batter coated chicken wings deep fried and sauted in a spicy garlic sauce 6. Steamed rice 7. Hot tea and iced water These descriptions, by the way, are straight from their menu. ?I have to say of the five entree items we ordered plus steamed white rice, the Curry Beef was the least favored new item. ?It lacked the depth that I usually find in curry and was pretty much lackluster....will not order this again. ? However the other dishes really shined! ?I liked the Three Deluxe Spicy Sauce Noodles and the Tomato Eggflower Soup best. These new selections were really delicious...on the noodle dish...word of warning...if you like your spicy noodles on the "mild spicy" it will not come out that way....we asked for "medium" spicy and while we enjoyed it, it was more like "high" on the spicy scale. ?One of our dining companions liked it so much but because it was too spicy for his taste, he declined a second helping even though he loved it! Parking can be hellish but keep an open mind and eye.....you'll find a spot soon enough!

Northern Chinese cuisine is all about the noodles and dumplings as well as cooking heavily with spices. My family has been coming to San Tung for a little something different from the abundance of southern Chinese restaurants in the city since they had the smaller shop in outer sunset. Some of our favorites include shrimp and leek dumplings, pork dumplings, black bean sauce noodles, and beef noodle soup. But nothing, absolute nothing, on the menu beats those highly addictive chicken wings. Spicy, tangy brown marinade laced over pieces of dry fried chicken wings keeps me always wanting to come back for more. Needless to say, everything they dry fry and layered with the brown marinade is fantastic!

I'm just floored by how utterly butt ass this is. Here's my theory on why this place has such a high rating. ?It's riding on its Yelp momentum. ?People see that it has a million 5-star ratings, triggering an automatic subconscious thought that it MUST be good. ?This is the response that prevents them from giving anything less than 4 stars, regardless of how truly appalling it may be. ?This is one of those legendary Yelp places that gets at least 4 stars even before you walk in the door, just for being a Yelp legend. ? Well, I don't think that's fair or just and I'm gonna speak up about it. ?Just like we did when they served us the most disgustingly greasy, oily mongolian beef I've ever had, which also had absolutely no flavor by the way. ?And the mu shu chicken. Well, it should have just been called mu shu oil and cabbage, cuz the chicken was not in attendance, and the pancakes were basically heavy, oily, pan fried flour tortillas. ?And the grand finale: the lemon chicken. ?This was basically deep fried chunks of batter swimming in a thick, mucous-like artificial lemon flavored goo. ?Where was the chicken here? Absent. ?Most of it was literally just batter and goo. ?They should have called this goo dumplings. And then when mom complained, painstakingly identifying the flaws of each and every dish, they wanted to negotiate on how much of the bill we should pay, taking us through a series of offers and counter-offers. ?Just ridiculous. ?And tacky. So there you have it. ?The ugly, tasteless truth about San Tung Restaurant #2. Update 12/16/06: ?A couple of fellow Yelpers have informed me that I "ordered wrong" when I ate here. ?This argument is so easy to counter its almost not worth it at all, but the reality is, if its *that* good, and worthy of so many raving 5 star reviews, then it stands to reason that every single dish would be consistently heavenly, and there would be no risk of getting a dish they are notorious for making poorly. ?That lack of consistency is one sign of a mediocre restaurant, I'm afraid.

Usually Santa forgets to bring me presents. I mean, I'm a Jew and all, but I still like Christmas cheer. I buy wreaths and download "Baby it's Cold Outside" onto my ipod, so you'd think he might want to put me on the Nice list. He used to visit when I was little, although he would only bring me school supplies, like glue sticks, and doll house people. But still, I really appreciated that he thought of me. It's been a while since Jolly Saint Nick paid me a visit, but he must have noticed what a crap-filled 2007 I've had and decided to give me a break. "Well, that heathen sassy girl has had a craptastic, unemployed, penny-less, cry-snotting few months, ahhhhh, what the heck, I'll give her some fuzzy socks, a Sonicare toothbrush and some kick-ass Chinese food." The socks are dope and the toothbrush makes my crooked-effed-up by-my-worthless-orthodontist-teeth sparkle like a Myspace glitter icon, but the Chinese food was like a shiny new car, or job, or shoes, or, you get the point. The wait to be seated was cold and crowded, but the sizzling rice soup and shrimp and leak dumplings warmed my insides and tugged on my heartstrings. The grizzly waiter literally threw our plates with gusto at our table, but the garlic spinach erased the memory of the bitter server and spread around a healthy dose of warm fuzzies. The screaming, hungry children who sounded oddly like Chucky from "Child's Play" were like shrill train whistles, but the black bean chicken and prawns with garlic sauce were intoxicating, like a good dirty martini that makes all irritating sounds into comforting white noise. Santa did good this year. Instead of ignoring me as he has done every year since I was 7, he gave me the gift of San Tung, the best Chinese food that has ever hit these sassy lips.

I HEART San Tung. So, why has it taken me 2 freaking years to FINALLY write a review for San Tung? I'm back on my stupid lo-carb diet to fit into my NYE dress and craving their Dry Fried Chicken Wings like there's no tomorrow. So, what's the best way to get over the craving? YELP ABOUT IT! I first heard about San Tung from my ex's sister. And, ever since I bit into those luscious wings, it was love at first bite. Below are some of things I've tried: FOOD: *Original Dry Fried Chicken Wings: This is the STAR menu item at San Tung. If you ain't coming for the wings; don't bother coming in at all! One word that describes the wings is "ORGASMIC". The large succulent chicken wings are fried in a light batter and then tossed in a thick sweet, savory, spicy concoction of ginger, garlic, and chili pepper flakes that sticks to the fried batter. Sooo effen good! Talk about amazing flavor combos! ?I've been to San Tung about 10-12 times, and the wing are consistently good--the chicken is always flavorful and tender. *Potstickers: The BEST potstickers EVER! These handmade babies are gigantic! It's pan fried to a perfect golden brown on the bottom, but it's crispy throughout. It's generously filled with cabbage and pork w/ a slight hint of ginger. The red vinegar is a perfect compliment as it adds a zing to the potsticker. BE CAFEFUL though, those things are piping hot when they come to your table. *Dry Sautéed Green Beans: Can veggies really taste this good? O yes, they CAN! The string beans are flash fried and then tossed into a thick garlicky sauce. The sauce is just thick enough to coat the beans which is cooked al-dente. The chili pepper flakes gives the dish a nice kick! *Dry Fried Beef: This is similar to the Original Fried Chicken dish, but just made with beef. The beef is flash fried and then tossed into the same garlicky, ginger, chili sauce as the chicken. The beef is slightly crispy on the outside and very tender! *Black Bean Sauce Noodles w/ sliced beef, shrimp, and calamari in a dark soybean sauce: I normally HATE black bean sauce. This can be attributed to my mom's horrid cooking where she would put so much black bean sauce that it would over power the dish. But, wow, this had be converted. The black bean sauce wasn't as salty as I thought it would be and had a slight sweetness to it. It tasted like eating a cold version of chow mein, but since the noodles were home-made it had a very different texture. It had more of a bite to it. Everything in this dish was super fresh and flavorful! * Noodles with Peanut Sauce: Give me anything smothered in peanut sauce and call it a day! Noodles covered in slightly spicy peanut sauce w/ fresh shrimp and scallops? YUMMY! *Mongolian Beef: This is a good alternative to ordering other fried dishes at San Tung. It's similar to the Dry Fried Beef except it's wok-fried and not as oily. The beef is tender and is perfectly seasoned. The onions and red bell peppers which is very fresh and not overcooked give the dish great flavor and crunch. *Shantung House Shrimps: This was a recommendation from the waiter! Whole jumbo shrimps fried and then tossed in garlic sauce? *Drool* The shrimp was massive and was very sweet and tender. The sauce nicely coated the shrimp's shell, so you get a hint of good flavor, but still can taste the natural sweetness of the shrimp. The best part? Ripping off the head and sucking out all the brainy goodness!!! YUM! :) *Sauteed Scallops: Another good alternative to the other fired menu items. The scallops are fresh and tender. They are perfectly sautéed in a flavorful ginger and garlic sauce with fresh and sweet snow peas. *Garlic Flavored Eggplant: YUMMY! The eggplant is tender and the garlicky sauce gently coats the eggplant which gives it a good garlicy kick! SERVICE: There's always a WAIT at Sun Tung, so be prepared for a 20-45 minute wait during the weekend nights. If you have a party of 7 or more, you can call in and have them put your name on the board. The service itself is similar to the typical Asian joint. You order, get your food, hail if you need something, and when you're done; get your bill. PARKING: Parking is terrible around this area b/c San Tung is in a vicinity of ?many other restaurants and local businesses. Try parking towards the Andronico's about 2 blocks away since it's away from 9th and 10th Avenues where it's gets very busy. AMBIANCE: There's not much to it. It's loud and bustling. You will see a lot of happy faces there b/c they are satisfying their crack feen with the wings! San Tung, until we meet again...hopefully, sometime soon in the near future.

Fried Chicken Wings. That's all I can say! The line sucks but I'm waiting for these wings. I guess I complain about waiting in lines to much but who doesn't, especially when you're minutes from having those wings in front of you! Service is okay. It can be a little off at times but don't let a waitress in a rush ruin your meal. Last but not least you know it's going to be bomb if you see other pinoys / pinays in there getting down!

The consistency of the noodles and the taste were super good. I was seriously in love with those noodles, after everyone was full, I was still picking out every noodle. The broth was yummy and the well seasoned. -Dried Chicken Wings: 5 STARS. These honey glazed lil wings were super yummy and i could have literally eaten a plates of them. -Wet Chicken Wings: 3 STARS, Compared to the dry wings these just reallie weren't that good, it didn't stand out for me. -Curry Beef: 3 STARS. Nothing reallie special with this dish, tastes like any other restaurant's curry beef. I wont order this next time around. -Deep Fried Calamari: 5 STARS. Like the Dry Chicken Wings these are glazed with honey and packed with flavor. mmm mmm mmm yummy To sum everything up: -Be prepared to wait, trust me you will wait a long time in order to get seated. Hence we waiting at 6pm, which is way toooo early of a dinner for me, but i made sure to eat super light during that day -If you expect great service: Ur SOL, cuz its always super busy and the waiters are always running, u gotta flag em down! -Word of advice: choose wat u want before u get in, u have plenty of time while u are waiting. Once the waiter comes! BAM! ORDER! ORDER! ORDER! cuz it mite be a while before he passes your table again -Lastly come here to enjoy the food and nothing else! ENJOY!

Sometimes things are just better the second time around, and this time San Tung was! ?Last week I was sick & bf wanted me to have some soup. ?I didn't want pho & I had won ton noodle soup from Fat Wong's the night before. ?So, I decided to give San Tung another chance, since I wanted some homemade noodle soup! ? We ordered: the beef noodle soup, dry fried chicken wings & shrimp fried rice. ?The wings were a lot crispier the second time around. ?I still like SO's wings better though because I like the spicier better than the sweet, bf says they're still crispier too. ? But they were still finger licking good. ?The beef noodle soup's broth was nice and not salty. ?They weren't stingy with the beef and gave a whole mess of noodles though, which needed more broth. The shrimp fried rice continues to be more flavorful than most places, but seemed better the first time around IMO. You get a one star upgrade from me San Tung. ?If only I could either a. get out of the house earlier to eat early at 11 to avoid the crowds & b. if only parking were easier around that area.....until then I'll continue to get to go when the craving hits & we're too lazy to drive to SO.

The dumplings were average. ?Prices were fair, all under $10 bucks. ?Service was typical of asian restaurants.

I'm smitten. What an awesome little restaurant! I went for lunch today with two friends who are regulars. We were seated at a communal table with a handsome and charming visitor from Sacramento who not only made our meal that much more enjoyable but also joined me in surrendering to the ordering powers of my friends. The girls chose: * Shrimp and leek dumplings...with a burst of briny flavor and especially nice with chili sauce and Chinese mustard * Homemade noodles with tomato and beef...possibly the best chow mein noodles I've ever had * String beans...perfectly crunchy and in a garlicky sauce perfect for sopping up with rice * The house specialty fried chicken...dry-fried and unbelievably delicious with its crispy, crunchy, sweet and spicy skin If San Tung weren't on the other side of town from where I live it would absolutely become a weekly haunt. This is daydream-worthy food and a great value: The four of us got stuffed and still had lots of leftovers for only $54.

Sometimes it pays to know people. You dont have to wait in line. You can hop onto other awesome peoples tables and dine with people who know what to order. You can make sure there are enough chicken wings to go around. You can realize that next time if you come...and there is a wait...its probably going to be worth it. Especially when you are the only white people in the place. ?It must be good Also...who knew that it was possible to talk on your cell phone your ENTIRE meal. ?Seriously...watched a kid do it. ?Eat and talk, all the way out the door. ?Rude...but fascinating.

WAY too packed all the time but the food makes up for it. They serve the best fried chicken wings I've ever eaten, even better then my moms! Even if I was on a really strict diet, I would break it just for that. We came here last night for a birthday dinner and I couldn't believe how busy they were. Lots of big groups dining and some celebrating their birthdays too. Some dishes I tried were the Mongolian beef - sliced tender beef sauteed with green onions and roasted red peppers in their house sauce Pork with green onions - sauteed shredded pork with jalapenos, onions in a light garlic sauce Garlic chicken - diced chicken stir fried with generous portion of garlic and water chestnuts in a garlic sauce.. ? Tomato beef chow mein - fried soft noodles with veggies Pot stickers, some shrimp dish and some more noodle dishes. Everything was good but service was on the slow side... Understandable though since they were super busy! TRY THE FRIED CHICKEN WINGS!

Damn, when the Yelp posse collectively decides they like a restaurant, let me tell you, that is one lucky restaurant. San Tung has a four star average over 1700 reviews & counting and a following that is evident in the crowds standing at their door. Sunday evening, we arrive around 6 pm, were the 2nd party to write our name down on the white dry-erase board & were seated almost immediately (had we arrived ten minutes later, our wait would have been over an hour long. Talk about good timing.) The sense of urgency at ST is intense; our waiter was ready to give away our table because I hesitated a nanosecond before raising my hand when he hollered my name! We ordered their dry fried chicken diced (instead of the wings) & asked for all white meat. When our dish arrived, the waiter (who reminded me of a Chinese version of the Soup Nazi for some reason) yelled "white meat! white meat!" I was thinking, even if I didn't order white meat, I'd just nod my head & take whatever he served us because this dude's voice was intimidating! FYI: I like when my waiter puts me in my place; makes me feel like we are on a sitcom. The diced dry fried chicken ($9) had nice, big chunks as well crispy little pieces sitting in their spicy garlic sauce; "Dry" is not completely dry. As messy as wings are, I think I would have preferred the less fried meat on them. We also ordered shrimp & leek dumplings (pretty good) & sweet & sour beef (candied to death in their fake bright red corn starch sauce.) I enjoyed their fried rice, which didn't need extra soy sauce. The complimentary kimchi they serve is horrible, rank, one if the worse kimchis I've tasted. Total was $40 (not including tip.) ?We'll be back. I like the hustle & bustle of this place. It's entertaining.

I was hyped about this place because: 1) all the Yelp reviews 2) the threads about KFC (korean fried chicken - though it's a Chinese place) 3) sis had been here 3 times within a month First, the wait was a biaaayatch. ?I even had to regulate when another customer, tired of the wait and already on the list, tried to sign her party up right before mine. ?After I pointed out that she was not signing up at the end of the list, she quickly crossed her name out and slinked away. Also, noise is an issue - I would venture to say that it was louder in there than a typical Chinese restaurant. ?I think it gave me a headache. Once seated, we ordered shrimp and leak dumplings, black bean sauce noodles, dry fried chicken (both wings/drumsticks and diced), and string beans. ?The dumplings were great but a little salty. ?Honestly, I have had similar dumplings that were frozen! ?There was barely any *stuff* in the black bean sauce noodles - they weren't kidding about the sauce! ?I think each of us (party of 5) got one piece of something - whether it was shrimp, beef, or squid. ?I prefer my mom's homemade kind! ?The dry fried chicken - I recommend on the bone and not diced - but we tried both. ?The diced kind reminded me of orange chicken - I kid you not. ?And finally, the string beans - not reviewable because when we were almost done with the meal, a waiter showed up and told us that they're out. ?GRR. They get three stars because the meal was not blow-your-socks off. ?Since I live on the Peninsula and my family in the East Bay, the food simply did not make the drive, the wait, or the noise worth it. ?My personal family favorite (for authentic delicious Chinese) is still Great China in Berkeley. ?So I'll be one less party you have to wait behind. But what do I know? ?Check it out for yourself.

3.5 stars rounded down for 1) mediocre service 2) ambiance (crowded!) 3) looooooooong wait. We came here on a Saturday night (around 6:30), put our names down, and went to get boba at Tea Way, as the wait would be long and arduous otherwise. It ended up being a bit under an hour I am guessing. We had plenty of time to drive off, get self-serve tea, drink it all, take cute pictures, and drive back...and we waited some more of course (maybe 15 min more) when we got back. We ended up ordering steamed dumplings (http://static1.px.yelpcd…) and cold noodles (http://static1.px.yelpcd…) between the two of us. The waiter complained that we ordered too little, but come on. We are two petite Asian girls who just drank full cups of boba. I thought 2 dishes for 2 girls was quite appropriate...it did turn out to be the perfect amount. As for the food, the pork dumplings were really delicious! I can make dumplings though too, so I am not sure how impressed I was :P The cold noodles were awesomely chewy (handpulled noodles ftw). All the veggies, meats, shrimp, etc in the dish were exceedingly fresh. My problem with the dish, however, was that the sauce was way too sweet. I think I prefer sesame-based cold noodles when it comes to Chinese stuff. It felt weird eating this... All-in-all, pretty good stuff but not worth the wait! I'd probably just go somewhere else with handpulled noodles and make my own dumplings. The amusing part of the night was when K told me that the waiter told her that her totoro (as pictured in the food images) was "beautiful."

Finally made it in here after being rejected from the typical long waits. ?My gf and I came in for dinner around 5:30 PM and in about 30 minutes there was a line out the door. Of course we had to order the dry fried chicken wings, dry fired green beens, and the black bean noodles. ?Like Christine L.'s review, the dishes are a little too sweet but they are definitely good. ? The sauce on the chicken wings are like crack. ?I started to dip my green beans in the sauce and poured some on top of my noodles. ?This is a place where you go to twice a year but will recommend to others to try.

Took a friend here recently for dinner and learned something new: If there is a wait (which there will always be), do not stand outside. ?If possible, wait indoors. ?The waiter would nonchalantly call out your name once, twice if he's feeling generous, and erase it at no response. ?He didn't even bother to open the door to call out the name. ? 30 minutes of your hard-earned waiting can easily be swiped away by his mighty hand if you're not on your toes to claim your spot.

The line that spills out onto the sidewalk should be your first hint that this place is a winner. Ignore the line, then gently bob and weave your way inside and place your name on the little white dry-erase board. Step back and start some conversations you might be in for a 30 minute wait, on a weekday, for a table you will share with strangers, and it will be worth it. I came here with Yelp Miami Elite pioneer and now Palo Alto Elite Rob C. He helped me navigate my first foray into the wild world of Chinese chicken wings. Both the dry and wet version were good but I think I'd take the dry. Still for me what made even more of a memorable impression on my taste buds were the black bean noodles. Sadly, I didn't sample dumplings.... there's always a next time.

Dry fry wings, so hot, so crunchy, so sticky sweet! My LOVE of fried chicken hit a gluttonous low (or high? it's all relative I guess) when I enthusiastically agreed to a third order of wings (that was a total of one order of 13 wings per person) despite my stomach telling me that it was on its way to Fat-Pants Town. ?Interestingly, the last batch that we ordered tasted very different form the first two; too much white pepper. Uh, yeah I ate it up anyway. We also had some dumplings, which I found to be juicy and tasty. The mushroom/mixed veggies that we ordered in our disingenuous attempt to have a "balanced meal" were quite bland. I wouldn't order that again. And who am I kidding, you go to San Tung for the wings. Next time I will save the veggies for the next day when I am hating myself for eating so damn much.

4.5 stars This is some of the best Chinese food I've had anywhere in the U.S. ?Forget Chinatown, Irving Street is where it's at. ?We were the only non-Asians in the joint - good sign. ?Servers spoke Mandarin with the other tables, but they had no problems communicating in English with us guai lo. We tried as many different dishes as we could. The pork dumplings are unbelievable. ?Pan fried or steamed both good, but I prefer the steamed. ?Could've housed dozens of those in one sitting - no doubt. ?The consistency of the pork inside reminded me of North Carolina pulled pork - not that nasty solid ball of compressed pork product found in dumplings at other places. ? We also had some veg dumplings that were quite tasty which surprised me because I am more of a meatitarian. Yung Chow fried rice was lights out. ?Big chunks of squid, beef, shrimp, and fresh well-cooked veg. The noodles were very, very good - some of the best I've had. ?You can really taste the love put into the noodles. ?If you hold the noodles up to the light you see their surface is not smooth but rough with little jags created during the handpulling process. ?Got one bowl with black bean sauce and chicken and another with a spicy seafood broth and tons of fresh seafood. Dry fried beef and chicken wings were both quite tasty. ?Kind of a crunchy breaded sweet (but not too sweet) and tangy. ?The table loved the beef but I loved the wings and believe I polished off 12 of them. I didn't think service was as bad as others have yelped. ?They were fairly attentive, and definitely helpful - they just so damn busy. ? We got there at about 11:30am on Saturday and got one of the last tables before the line started forming. ?It was half block long when we left.

Out of all the ethnic foods, certainly none has been more bastardized in America than Chinese food. ?Not sure how that happened, though I suspect that early Chinese restaurant owners cleverly realized that what fat Americans really want is breaded, deep fried meat covered in syrup, then rode that idea all the way to the bank. ?And hell, I used to be one of those Americans. ?General Tso's Chicken...I couldn't stop eating it. ?Now that I know better, I still think of it as a guilty pleasure, but it saddens me to think of the millions out there in suburbia who still don't know they've been fooled. ? ? ? Enter San Tung, by whose miraculous food I am able to enjoy the insane deliciousness with none of the guilt. ?Now I can have Dry Fried Beef, which transcends the authentic/americanized divide and truly reconciles the simple with the sublime. ?And wait till you get a load of the hand-pulled noodles. ?Finally, a peanut sauce that isn't sickening. ? Long story short, this place is a must must MUST. ?Also, save yourself the trouble of waiting in line and make a reservation.

With a ton of Yelp reviews advocating its deliciousness and starving bellies in tow, we ended up at San Tung. This places exudes authenticity and freshness from the moment you walk in. Unpretentious tables and chairs line the walls and the decor is nothing to remember...this place is all about the food. The kitchen staff is hard at work since there are always people clamoring for tables or leisurely eating during the mid stretch of the day (which is when we walked in). You may even catch the staff sitting at tables cleaning fresh green beans, filling sauces, and bringing out kimchi to tables. As a self-proclaimed "non-lover" of Chinese food I was thrilled to find a ton of things I wanted to order. I was even more thrilled when I learned that the dishes did not have the normal heaviness associated with many traditional Chinese dishes. ? The vegetarian spring rolls (steamed) were delicious. There are 6 in an order and they are huge. Filled with cabbage, carrots, tofu, etc. Add a little soy sauce and they are perfect. The hot and sour soup was much different than I expected. The broth was a light color and fairly salty. Can be made vegetarian upon request (shrimp added otherwise). Fast, no nonsense service and excellent food that left me wanting more.

It was passable. ?Noodles were decent, but A&J is way better. ?They were simply not chewy enough. ?I think they need to use slightly higher gluten flour. ?They used the same flour for their dumplings, which were the same way. ?And they don't sell the dumplings frozen! ?what's up with that?!? The za jiang mian was brown, and the sauce tasted right--this is good. ?no weird ink-black type with a weird taste like I had at some other korean run restaurant. ?My only complaint was, I seriously prefer the standard ground pork and dried tofu type of za jiang mian. ?I didn't really dig all the seafood they threw in...as well as the beef slices and potato (!?) chunks. ?It was passable, but not the true za jiang mian I was looking for. ?I even asked the waiter if the noodles were chinese or korean style and he said korean style. I had a bit of my companion's beef noodle soup, and it was decent. ?Again, nothing to write home about. ?No thin layer of chili oil on top. ?The beef and soup were both lacking spice I think... and there was no real kick at all. ?The beef may have been a little overcooked as well, though there was a good amount of beef tendon (a good thing). The shrimp-chive dumplings were ok. ?But they did not blow me away. ?The dumplings at Grace Garden in Burlingame were way better--a shandong restaurant that is much more authentic. The famous dry fry chicken... was too sweet and needed more spice, but otherwise was tasty. ?Those of you that like this, should try to get some la-zi-ji (chili pepper chicken) which is how the sichuan folk do it. ? Overall, I think it passes. ?It's authentic enough that I was not disgusted by everything, but it's nowhere near A&J level for noodles, nowhere near Grace Garden level for dumplings.

Sorry guys. You said try the San Tung, it's awesome for its chicken wings and five spice beef noodle soup, so I tried one day on the way home from work, when I was starving... The dry fried chicken wings: decent, if on the super sweet, "OMG it's dipped in honey-coated jelly beans" side -- they use an interesting caramel-garlic-onion flavored sauce. When they brought it out, I was like, "Excuse me, I ordered the dry chicken wings." She looks at me, looks at the plate: "These are dry." I look at the plate -- it's swimming in sauce: "...okay..." Are the wet fried chicken wings on the menu served in a soup? $8 also seems overpriced for chicken wings that I can get for $4 at other Chinese restaurants in the area. As for the five spice beef noodle soup: I can see why there are tons of restaurants that exclusively serve Vietnamese pho, I can see why there restaurants that exclusively serve Japanese ramen, and I can see why there aren't restaurants here that exclusively serve Taiwanese beef noodle soup. The beef noodle soup here runs on the bland side, as others have commented. The beef with tendons is solid -- no complaints. The wheat noodles could be firmer. But the real travesty is the broth, the foundation of every bowl. Noodle soup is made or broken by the broth. And this broth is a hollow tasting, watery, and runs on the sugary sweet side. The garlic spinach they toss in on top seems like an aside. I couldn't finish more than half of my bowl. Chinese cuisine has so much more to offer in terms of noodle soups. Cantonese duck leg noodle soup. Malaysian laksa. Vietnamese hu tieu mi (borrowed from the Chinese and made their own, as the Japanese did with ramen). I would hold up Vietnamese bun bo Hue as similar to Taiwanese beef noodle soup, but far more flavorful. As for the restaurant service, it was very fast and very clean -- to be expected for this Chinese restaurant in the trendy Inner Sunset where the large majority of the clientele is not Chinese. Compared to the Chinese family style restaurants I usually frequent, this place is immaculate. There's twice the wait staff, and every one of them speaks English. I'll be back, but not for the soup. I'll keep this place in mind when I'm taking out friends and family who aren't down with assorted foods served with heads still on... P.S. This place seems like a strange Northern Chinese-Korean mix, but the Korean influence isn't very strong. (The wait staff is Cantonese). Everything is far too sweet for typical Chinese fair. They bring out a dish of kimchi and tea when you sit down. It's the least satisfying kimchi I've ever had the displeasure to taste... sugary sweet, sweeter than most coleslaw even, not salty, not pickled, barely spicy, aged maybe a day or two at best. I don't know why they'd want to give this to people as the first impression of their food. P.P.S. Chalking this up as another reinforcement to my belief that Inner Sunset restos are highly overrated because of the trendy location.

My quest for 5-star Chinese food has ended - thanks to Jolie L for her recommendation! They were consistently good in all areas - menu options, taste, value, service, ambiance. For once, I liked everything I ordered. This never happens to me. - Dried fried chicken wings: Their signature dish. These wings had a light, sweet glaze and the dried red peppers added some kick. It would be a crime to come here and not order these. - Pork dumplings: Forget the soy sauce. These juicy little dumplings packed enough flavor on their own. The wrapper wasn't too thick, either. Not as great as Kingdom of Dumpling, but a close contender. - Fried rice was fluffy and not too salty, and the vegetarian egg rolls were crispy and not too greasy. The cabbage and carrots in the egg rolls were crispy, too. I also loved... Great service: They packed my leftovers in the to-go box - yes! I've been so disappointed at other places who make me pack my own food. These guys were attentive without helicoptering over our table. When we asked for something (water, tea, the check) they delivered quickly. Clean and spacious: Plenty of tables meant lots of elbow room. And the place is clean. It didn't reek of fried foods or fish, like some Chinese restaurants. Even their bathroom was clean! Good value: My bill was $37 including tax and tip, and I have leftovers galore. I don't ask for much. I think the hardest thing to find is consistency. San Tung hit the mark this time, but the real test is whether they'll hold up over time. Must do further research and report back!

#36 on the 7x7 List: Dry-fried chicken wings -Tasty? ?Perfectly fried chicken wings with a bit of a sweet sauce. -Service: ?The wait staff is pretty quick and efficient. ? The refilling of our teapot was like magic. ?I didn't even see them bring a fresh pot back! ?They are also pretty keen. ?One look at the waiters and they immediately come over. ?Amazing. -Ambiance: ?yet another Chinese place that invests its money in the chef / food and not on the walls. ?It's a paper napkins and disposable chopsticks kind of place - for sanitary reasons. ?It's not ghetto. -Worth the trip/try? ?For me, it was a half-hour ride on the Muni (71-Noriega to be exact). ?I would say that it was worth the trip for us to share some good grub with a long-time friend. -------- We also had the Noodles with black bean sauce (ja jerng mein) - it was pretty good but nothing too special. The Potstickers were fried perfectly golden brown. ?You can create your own dipping sauce with the different bottles of condiments on your table The three of us finished the three orders of food and had room for more, so we ordered the Cherry Pork. ?It's like sweet and sour pork and it makes white rice taste so good.

Always here for family dinner. The rating is definitely not overrated. Their special Dry Fried Chickens sure help pull in more customers. I believe most of the people who come here are for their chicken wings because this is why I come here a lot. Other than the wings, the cold noodles is just as good. It is similar to the noodles with peanut sauce, except that it's cold, which I think it's better. Do expect at least 30 minutes of waiting even with reservation. Without reservation, I do not know how long you will have to wait. Doesn't matter whether you go on a weekday or weekend, you will always have to wait in line. After all it is sure a great place to go for dinner. It's worth waiting, if not too long.

A place you definitely don't go to for the ambiance, San Tung is a major draw nonetheless. My favorite dishes there are the shrimp and leek dumplings and the jajangmyen (noodles with black bean sauce) Once, on a Sunday morning visit, the place smelled heavily of what I hoped to be ammonia. It did put me off a bit. Other than that, no complaints! Except for the "kimchi", which they have no right to call kimchi because it is DEFINITELY NOT. Steer clear.

I finally came back after coming on a day that this restaurant is closed. My mission at this restaurant, to try their dry fried chicken wings listed on 7x7's The Big Eat SF list of things to try. - Spicy pickled cabbage: Complimentary appetizer that came after we ordered. Kim chi wannabe that is overly spicy. - Dry fried chicken wings: O-M-G, the flavor is like no other that I have tasted. Spicy, sweet, salty, just delicious! It's definitely the sauce that got me hooked and I wanted to dip everything in it afterward. I wish I ordered the other boneless chicken option rather than the wings, so my hands wouldn't get all dirty/saucy. *Favorite* - Dry sauteed string beans: It's really good a little on the salty side, but dipped this in the fried chicken sauce and it was money! - Dry black bean sauce noodles: literally came out black drenched in sauce with calamari, scallops, and shrimp. Salty and fishy tasting. Added the fried chicken sauce and it was better! *Skip* Seeing a trend with the fried chicken sauce use? Just dip everything in it, you won't regret it! Overall, service was alright and all the saucy food gave me an OD on salt (It made me really thirsty afterward). Order the FRIED CHICKEN! P.S. Go early, it gets crowded and check if it's opened that day before venturing out to this restaurant!

The best lunch special relatively close to my home! I'm both blessed and cursed to be living in the Presidio. More blessed than anything, but it's always a hassle to leave the area to do even the most simple things, like going grocery shopping, getting gas, and of course, picking up a quick lunch. However, I have this timing on lock. Right when I'm about to leave my house, I call San Tung and the friendly person on the other side of the phone takes my order. By the time I drive ten minutes to 11th and Irving, I simply pop out of my car and BOOM! my lunch is ready. The average price for a lunch special is $7 and includes an entree served over rice and their soup of the day. The soup is always so tasty, and I swear...the lunch lasts me two big or three small sized meals! I'm in love.

Came here in late June. Party of 7 for lunch on a Saturday. After a short wait, we were led to that small room in the corner. Private space, cool. So I realize that everyone pretty much just comes here for the fried chicken. I admit, that was good. However, it wasn't extraordinary. Besides that, we had several other dishes and they were all mediocre. * Pork dumplings: Meh. Nothing special at all. * Shrimp dumplings: Wait, these were shrimp? They were probably at least 80% ?(garlic chives? leek? idk) * Chicken chow mein: Greasy. Flavor was nothing special. * Combo fried rice: Decent, but average. * Lemon chicken: There was hardly any lemon flavor, and wayyy too much goop. One of the worst lemon chicken dishes I've had (but not that it was bad...). Nothing to really comment on regarding the service. They left us alone for the most part, which I liked. Oh, except that we did have to wait quite a while before someone came back to take our order... And our waiter urged us to order more food, saying that we didn't have enough for 7. (Turns out, we probably would've done without the extra order of dumplings.) If this were based only on the dry fried chicken, maybe I'd give it 4 stars. But I'm here to eat other things too, so it's 3. That might even be a bit generous if I really compare it to other places.

There's a wait. If you don't want to wait, don't even bother... or get there early to make the first round to be seated. You can also call in ahead and get your name up on the board! Whenever we go here, we usually order the same things. If you don't know what to get, here are the staples: -Dry Fried Chicken Wings -Dry Fried String Beans -Shrimp & Leek Dumplings [last time we went, we ordered three orders for six people - WAY too much, but mmmmm, so good!] We also like to get the Mushu Pork/Chicken/Shrimp. Sounds kinda crazy, but the wrappers are house-made. It's not the typical thin wrapping that breaks when you put any form of sauce onto it. ?For these, the sauce drips out the side, and your hands get all kinds of saucy. PS - Do not write a silly fake name like "Superman" on the board. It will be erased!

Came here twice, luv luv it. The servers were really friendly, yes, waiting was long, but very worth it. It's funny that it was my white-boy-friend that was craving this place more than I do, so that's how we ended up here. It's funny how they served the table, they gave spicy kim chi, it sounded more like a korean resto than chinese now, doesn't it? Always gotta order spicy fried chicken (dried), although 2 times I came here, once I ordered wet, the other one dried. I preferred the dried fried chicken, it's really that good! Other things to order: - Dumplings - Potstickers Never order the Mongolian Beef, it's disappointing, but overall, I never disappointed on their friendly service and portions, will always come back here whenever I visit Bay Area. Tips: When you see the long line, don't forget to write your name on the white board, if not, you gotta wait a LONG LONG time to get seated and yes, always come after the rush hour!!! Even at 9 the lines were still long, it's crazy. Oh one last thing, yes, they served Beer!!!

Any Chinese place worth its MSG is filled with Chinese people. ?In fact, when I'm at a Chinese restaurant, I feel more uncomfortable around other English-speaking people than I do around those I can't understand. But this is the Sunset, after all, so many Asian restaurants are filled with Asian patrons. ?What gives San Tung added credibility is that it's often filled to the brim with children. ?Chinese people speaking Cantonese (I think)? ?Check! ?Cantonese-speaking people who see fit to bring their children? ?Check! The food is delicious. ?I liked everything I had here. ?The service is also good. ?It always helps to speak the native language of the servers at a given restaurant, but here I felt like the servers went out of their way to accommodate us even though we were one of exactly two non-Asian parties in the restaurant. ?(And they more than put up with the demanding woman at the next table.) I also liked that at a certain point they just dumped a huge mound of beans on one of the tables in the main dining area. ?Eventually, restaurant employees (and their children?) went to work cleaning the beans. This place might qualify for five stars; I just have to come here again to make sure.

Sauce was ok, but just a little weird with all the meat (beef AND shrimp and maybe chicken, couldn't tell)... Dry Fried Chicken wasn't dry at all. It was fried and then sticky sauce was poured over it... Taste was good though... But I prefer boneless fried chicken pieces... Garlic Shrimp was very yummy... Dumplings... eh.. not to my liking... Overall, just ok. For those of you that have ever had Sam Won Gak's jja jang myun in Flushing, you will NOT like San Tung.

San Tung is a Chinese province that borders the Corean peninsula. ?So you know those clear yellow round noodles in jap chae? ?San Tung restaurant stir-fries those bouncy little noodles with veggies. ?Can you find any other Chinese restaurant in the city that does that? ?I certainly haven't. ?My hunny just loves it and is crazy for jap chae, too. I give San Tung Restaurant 5 stars for two reasons. ?#1 ?You gotta dig the Chinese Corean thing. ?#2 ?I don't compare it to other Chinese restaurants-- because it's unfair. ?My first instinct when I ate dumplings at San Tung was, whoa, the dumpling wrapper is too thick. ?But that's because I'm used to HK and Taiwanese cuisines that value thin, delicate dumpling wrappers. ?Korean/ San Tung cuisines generally use a thicker wrapper; it's the style, it's how they do it. ?I can dig. ?I quickly found out that San Tung makes some of the best potstickers around because the skin on the dumplings are quite condusive to being fried. ?Truth be told, I usually detest the squishy, tasteless potstickers that are served in the U.S., cause who can make a better potsticker than grandma, right? San Tung Restaurant also makes a killer chicken wing (as you've probably all heard). ?It's definitely on the sweet side, but the meat is super tender inside, there's excellent flavor and how they manage to keep the batter super crispy yet gooey with sauce, I will never understand. ?It's magic. ?Delicious magic. ?I don't care. ?I'll eat until I bust. ?Anyway, their dry braised green beans are pretty good, too. ?Their veggie selections in general are pretty well done. ?I'm used to the Taiwanese-style black bean noodles (thinner noodles, deeper flavor), but they serve a decent version of the dish here. ?Extra plus? ?It's affordable. ?Our tab last night for two came out to about $20. ?With food leftover for lunch. ?Sweet. I have the enormous luxury of eating out during the weekdays where I can effectively avoid bad parking and crowded lines. ?Last night we went to San Tung for dinner around 8pm, waited 4 minutes for a seat and got our first dish served within minutes of ordering. ?Our server was a sweetheart and cracked jokes with us in Mandarin (they all speak at least two dialects of Chinese in that restaurant). ?We had a great time. ?Our server dropped one of the fortune cookies on the ground and told us she was going to go out back, wash it and bring it back. ?Hilarious. But uh, we didn't eat our fortune cookies. ************************** UPDATE: 09/04/2007 I live in Boston now. ?And I miss you. ************************** UPDATE: 9/15/2009 I live in New York now. ?And I STILL miss you.

Giving San Tung another high star review is as necessary as giving Imelda Marcos another pair of shoes, but it would be unconscionable to not sing the praises of the divine chicken wings. Dry-fried chicken wings. Four words that make my mouth water besides 'Johnny Depp in buff' or 'chocolate molten lava cake'. ? Finding a time without a long wait can be trying, but they exist. ?Sunday before dinner time, around 4pm, you can slide in. The chicken wings are so good that any wait is worth it. ?The meal always begins with some kimchi despite being a chinese restaurant, and then ends with a massively extended belly and a button pop-off or two. ? Definitely a place to forgo any New Year's resolutions!

Almost every night, you will find San Tung crowded inside and out. The patrons can be found anxiously waiting for the next open table. San Tung has been serving their famous dried fried chicken to local diners as well as out of town diners for almost a decade at their inner Sunset location. Despite the lack of parking and unspectacular location, San Tung has become the premiere destination for great Northern Chinese food. The Northern Chinese menu offers something for every diner -- soups, noodle, seafood, meat, and dumplings. The interior décor is not impressive but the crowd affirms that the food is the main focus. The waiters, dressed in white shirts and black pants, are fast order takers and are open to recommendations. The food plays center stage and the loud noise only adds to the atmosphere of a bustling restaurant. Food. Like most Chinese restaurants, the menu is large in selection. The menu has been assembled with care as each item includes clear descriptions of each dish. Their house special is their dry fried chicken wings ($8.00). Chicken wings are deep fried in a batter with roasted red peppers, ginger, and garlic. The result is a chicken wing that is crunchy, moist, lightly spicy, and sweet. The Szechuan tea smoked duck ($11.00) is half a duck marinated in five spice. The duck is smoked with Oolong black tea leaves and then deep fried. The duck meat is tender and is flavored by the pungent smoky flavor that goes perfected well with the nutty hoisin sauce in the lotus bun. Other classic dishes include the dried sautéed string beans ($6.50). The green beans are flash fried and tossed in a garlic sauce with Chinese pickles. They are crunchy and savory. Some other favorites include hot and sour soup ($6.95-M). The mixture of shrimp, tofu, peas, tree fungus and bamboo shots in a tangy and peppery broth with whipped eggs makes it a great dish especially on cold foggy days in city. San Tung sets themselves apart from other Chinese restaurants by using handmade ingredients. This includes handmade noodles, potstickers, dumplings, and mu shu wrappers. Their black bean sauce noodles ($7.00) features calamari, beef, and shrimp in a dark soy sauce over a bowl noodles that are cooked to perfection, chewy but not doughy. The shrimp and leek dumplings ($6.50) come in twelve and are filled with a savory mixture of ginger, garlic, chives, and shrimp. The handmade dumpling skins are thin and the fresh chives play center role in the filling.

This is the go-to place for me and my friends for good eats that won't break the bank. We come here alot for birthdays just because they can accommodate a large party. You can feed a table of 10 for $15-$20, depending if you order beer. Here's what we usually order: -potstickers -shrimp and leek dumplings -pork dumplings -dry fried chicken wings ?http://static.px.yelp.co… -dry fried green beans -mushu pork -pork chow mein -five spice beef noodle soup -seaweed soup....recently tried this and it was gooooood Just be warned, there's always a line out the door. If you have a large party, you're better off making a reservation or you'll be waiting FOREVER. If you don't feel like waiting outside in the cold for your table, you can always do take-out....but call ahead because that can take a while, too.

I wish there was a way to give it a -1 star. ?I went on a weekday at around 11:20am. ?My first impression was that it had a distinct odor of ur*ne. ?I looked around to see other people's reaction, no one seems to have noticed! The waiter came and asked what I wanted. ?Before I could open my mouth he left. ?He did this five times! It had only 5 tables in the whole place so I know he wasn't that busy. ?It was the worst service from a waiter anywhere in the world, including Asia. ? He finally came to take my order. ?I ordered the Hot and Sour soup, Five Spice Beef noodles and the famous chicken wings. ?The soup was bland with dashes of vinegar and pepper. ?The Five Spice Beef noodles was spiced with raw strands of ginger which makes eating it difficult, plus the noodles were overcooked. ?The chicken wings were fried chicken wings with sweet sauce and then sprinkled liberally with sugar(the kind you spoon into coffee). ?I had one piece and couldn't eat another one. ? The worst part was when I got home I started feeling a little unwell in the stomach. ?Anyway, this was one of the worst restaurant experience I have ever had anywhere. ?I know this place has many fans, which I can't figure out. ?However, I just have to warn people about my experience.

1 small sizzling rice soup +1 order pork dumplings +1 order potstickers +1 order dry fried chicken +1 order steamed rice +1 diet coke +1 sing tao -------------------------------------- 2 ?very happy and full girls To tell you the truth, I was a bit skeptical about San Tung's reviews. 200+ reviews with an average rating of 4.5 stars? Is it REALLY that good? YES! Their dry fried chicken wings are the best wings I've ever had. They're really really tasty... finger lickin' good. If you're having a Superbowl party, forget american wings. Come get San Tung dry fried chicken wings. The dumplings are soft, luscious bite-size morsels of heaven. The thickness and consistency of the skin are perfect. It's not like any of the pre-made skins you can buy at the Chinese market, so they must be homemade. Potstickers were just the right crispiness. They're yum. ? If you could believe, my friend and I finished EVERYTHING listed above except for 1 chicken wing. I walked out of the restaurant really sluggishly, seriously in slow-mo, and the waiter said, "oh, eat too much huh?" Yeah. P.S. We went a little after 8 on a Saturday night. We only waited 15-20 minutes for a table, which I understand is considered a short wait.

I wonder where San Tung Chinese Restaurant #1 is... Anyway, we ordered the #74 - and let me tell you, this is some really fantastic stuff. Big portions so a lot of you can share and eat on the cheap. The wait sucks during peak hours but it seems as if they try and get people in and out of there as quickly as possible. We spent about $15.00. Tip included. With leftovers. Not too bad, not too bad at all.

Just the thought of this place makes my mouth water. ?And since my mouth is watering, I probably shouldn't even bother writing a cohesive paragraph. ?I'll just stick to a list of the ways in which San Tung makes me happy: 1. I'm a vegetarian and I love this place! ?I can't say I don't miss the Dried Fried Chicken of yesteryear, but I have found the irreplaceable Dried Fried Tofu. ?Okay, it's not exactly on the menu... But just be firm when ordering and you will reap the slightly sweet, slightly spicy and crunchy benefits within no time! 2. The service doesn't exactly fall within your typical coldly rude or overly-friendly spectrum of SF, but is actually a nice in-between. ?The staff are like the efficient-on-the-outside, but heart-of-gold-on-the-inside teachers you may have had in high school. ?They might not say all the right things, but they do get you what you need and they do it quick. 3. This is as close as I can get to great Chinese food in the city. ?If I hear about one more fusion place that's "authentic," I'm going to stop eating! ?Well... at least for a couple of minutes. ?Man, I'm hungry already! 4. The veggie fried rice is awesome. ?So steamy, so filling and so... um, yummy! ?Add just a dash of hoisin sauce and you will never leave this place. 5. Fortune cookies with charming messages such as: "You are talented, but are not reaching your potential" just make my day! ?It's so great when sweets manufacturers tell you what you already know... 6. It's hella cheap! ?Well, not as cheap as boiling water for a bag of noodles at home... but affordable under SF conditions. Does anyone have a napkin for my drool? ?Thanks! ?And a final stomach growl for San Tung, their delicious fare and their unsolicited, but gratefully accepted pearls of wisdom.

-----5 reasons to wait in line and eat at San Tung----- 5) Kim chee! It's spicy, it's already in front of my face, and it costs FREE 99 4) My dad has to "babysit" a lot of Chinese people in his line of work. When my dad is making a stop at SFO to pickup someone who's flying in from Shanghai, Harbin, etc.... he takes them to San Tung (and they always like it. I think San Tung's street cred just got bumped up a notch) 3) I've said it a thousand times but "Chinese restaurants" and "good service" don't fit in the same sentence..... except here 2) According to yelp 433 reviews before mine have told you to get the chicken wings. Well, I'm number 434. Crispy, juicy, spicy, and sweet... don't think, just do it! 1) 5 spice beef noodle soup. This is one damn good bowl of noodle soup! The noodles (housemade) are thick, al dente, and chewy. The soup is robust and deep but not too heavy or oily. The beef has got that Chinese-ee 5 spice flavor and the spinach is thrown in at the very end so it's not totally wilted and annihilated. At the end of the day it's just a bowl of noodle soup, but for me, it's a PERFECT bowl of noodle soup. Sue me if I'm overhyping.

What's all the hoopla about?! I don't get it. It's chicken-wings. Hmm...I must be missing something. I'm glad we came right when it opened and were the second table to get seated. (No lines at 11am on a Saturday but it started to form around 11:30am). I wouldn't wait more than 20 minutes for this and won't be driving here out of my way, but nevertheless, San Tung is a solid restaurant with good food at a great price. + pork fried rice (we ordered it as a joke but it was actually pretty good) +/- chicken chow mein +/- chicken wings (I did not see any difference between the saucy and sauceless) + dumplings + potstickers (surprisingly fluffy) All that for ~$50. Not bad!

Waiting, waiting and waiting. Was it worth it? Heck yeah! Thanks to all the recommendations (1,100+ from my fellow yelpers), this place was one of the best places for dinner during my BA excursion. I wasn't too hungry so I ordered the pork steamed dumplings and the potstickers (each dish around $7). These suckers were huge with tons of meat filling. The potsticker had a thick skin which tasted so good with the dipping sauce. The steamed dumplings had a nice solid pork taste without the extra oil. Beware because this place needs crowd control. You put your name on a dry erase board and hope they will call it before you start to pass out from low blood sugar. Service was good but there might be a chance you might have to share a round table with other parties. If I had to seat on someone else's lap to eat this stuff, I would have!

It seems that quite a few people before me have been here and felt the need to review San Tung, but I must add my two cents in. This place is popular for a reason...ever since discovering this place, I wish I lived closer so that I could have their chicken wings and dry fried chicken. The mongolian beef is also something to wish for. The deluxe noodles can be said to be superior to any other chinese restaurant. I am always ready to wait whenever I add my name to the list as people like this place.

The #1 item you have to order is their dry fried chicken wings, but you already know that. And if you don't like chicken, get the beef version. And if you're a vegetarian but eat fish, get the fish version. In short, dry fried never fails. And then make sure to order dumplings and noodles because they specialize in that stuff. Be prepared for a long wait. JONASAPPROVED!

I have been here numerous times over the years and I have loved it every time! ?If you want some great noodles this is the place. ?My particular favorite is the seafood soup noodle, which I get an entire bowl to myself. ?Also their steamed pot-stickers are delicious. ?Everything here tastes great. Some things to note: Because the place is freaking awesome and the locals know it, depending how you time it the place will usually be packed with a line out the door. ?If you're lucky or go a lot and get a feel for it you can hit the place between rushes and the place will be magically empty for about 15 minutes. They give a free appetizer while you wait, kim-chi (spicy fermented cabbage good stuff) as well as tea. You can see them hauling in fresh veggies right through the front door all the time.

Do you really deserve 4 stars from 1000+ people? I came here with my friend and his friends today to try the chicken wings. When we first got there, our table was taken by some other people. I guess it wasn't the restaurant's fault because they gave the table to the person who said he is "Sean." But the real "Sean" was actually standing outside! We decided on the chicken wings that everyone talks about, the black bean noodles, the "rice bottom" soup (I hope you know what I am talking about), and pork dumplings. Okay, the wings were good. They were fried and in a sweet and spicy taste but even though they said it's "dry" fried wings, they weren't dry at all. It was covered with sauce. However, all the other things were just OK. I like the black bean noodles from the korean restaurant on Geary more than this one. The dumplings were ok. Oh, the rice bottom soup was interesting. I liked this one because I have not had it before. They put the rice bottom (you know when you cook rice, the bottom of it is a little burnt and crispy) into the soup. So it was crunchy and soupy. The service wasn't amazing. They were pretty busy so it took a while for them to take our order. However, they were fast with paying. We were also yelping while ordering. We thought yelp should have what are the bad dishes and have-tried dishes when rating a restaurant. Because we also just pick the food that everyone else says is good and may be other foods are good too but just that no one ever orders them.

Today's visit was incredible, and made up for the so-so inconsistent visits in the past. ?I can now say with much confidence that San Tung is by far (on the days when the cooks are at their best), the gold standard for hwagyo Korean Chinese food in the San Francisco Bay Area. ?I will even go out on a limb, after exploring all the possible Korean Chinese restaurants in Southern and Northern California, that you all are lucky to have San Tung in your backyard. Why San Tung is the hwagyo gold standard (at least from today's visit): 1. ?Jajangmyun: ?was plentiful in size and presentation. ?The cucumber julienned garnish was fresh and crunchy, while the black bean sauce was thick, flavorful in color and consistency. ?The noodles were cooked al dente, rather than being bland or overboiled. ?The sauce ratio to the noodles was generous without a fault, and the unexpected shrimp generous, plump and juicy. 2. ?Jampong: ?was slightly heavy on the ginger (which I do not mind), and was spicy without a fault. ?The soup was not oily, and there was no residue of fat or oil floating on the top. ?Vegetables were plenty, and the noodles were cooked perfectly, as if they were freshly hand-pulled. ? 3. ?Tangsuyok (sauteed beef): ?was crunchy, savory and yet seasoned well with the right balance of sweetness and light breading. ?It was perfectly fried, without being too heavy. 4. ?Gambongi: ?was perfectly spicy, peppery with a light aftertaste. ?It was extremely hot, cooked perfectly. ?It was salty, yet spicy and not sweet nor gloppy as it was on previous visits. I think that a Korean Chinese chef was in the house on tonight's visit, but I come away fully pleased with my experience here. ?They score high on the hwagyo Trinity. ?Everything was generous, and seasoned perfectly. Customer service: ?one of the servers has become my favorite, as he always lets me know when he is available and we tipped him well. ?The heavier set server is not so friendly though, as he sort of threw the plates and settings on our table. ?Lucky for us, we had one of my favorite servers with us tonight. I will, without a doubt, highly recommend San Tung as the premier destination for hwagyo Korean Chinese food in San Francisco. ?Lucky for you SF Bay Area people! ?For all of those from L.A. and elsewhere, visiting San Tung is a must. ?Delicious experience, highly recommended with Five Yelp Stars for San Tung. ?There are reasons why there are lines out the door on Irving!

This is my go to place when I need black bean sauce with noodles AND something not black and slimy for the person who's being dragged to dinner with me. How could someone not like Chinese food I ask you? How? And driving halfway across town to the exact opposite side of Chinatown doesn't strike me as being odd at all for great chicken wings too. Since I'm apparently the girl to talk to whenever someone's indecisive about what to eat, I felt a lot of pressure when posed that question one night after closing up shop. The rules? Nothing in Nob Hill, nothing Japanese, nothing Mexican, nothing corporate, no price point but something you'd definitely want to write home about. So I got in the car, started driving west and had a friend follow me all 11 miles of the twists and turns till I figured out where I really was going. San Tung is located on the quiet side of a predominantly Chinese neighborhood and it's bright white lights are warm and inviting and draws large crowds and long lines at any given hour. At 8:30 p.m., the line was tightly crowded in the waiting area and around the corner. That shouldn't scare anyone from waiting and partaking of the glorious dry chicken wings and black bean sauce though and the wait is always worth it. My friend and I were seated in less than 30 minutes and got the corner table near the action which is actually our favorite spot. Our server came over to us immediately and starting shooting off questions and taking orders right away much to our delight. When it comes to food, I have no problems putting it away in the multiple stomaches I have hidden inside this petite frame and neither did my dinner companion so we ordered dried chicken wings, cherry pork, pork fried rice and black bean sauce with noodles. "Just two people?" the server asks. "Yep, just us two" I reply with a goofy knowing grin on my face. "You two want something to drink? Coke? Water?" "Coke for me." says the friend. "Tea for me." "And water?" "No. No water. Just a pot of tea." "Oh..(chuckles)...she a real Asian." (emphasis on the word "real") (Moment of reflection on my part and an obnoxious amount of snorting across the table from me.) He didn't have much time to get the Asian jokes in 'cause quickly afterwards, the kimchi hit the table, followed by the entrees. The black bean sauce was hearty, chock-full of veggies and seafood but not quite the hit with my dinner companion so I guess it's an acquired taste. Cherry pork was a surprising delight with it's crispy batter shell, light sweet sauce and the soft meaty contrast. I honestly wouldn't have ever picked that dish in years but it worked really well with the saltiness of the pork fried rice. A word of caution about the dry chicken wings now. Yes, you're excited to finally get your greedy fingers on them. Yes, they look appetizing and gorgeous and above all, inviting. Yes, you've had this before and you know what to expect BUT how many times do you just dig into a dish with your fingers and forget the temperature of these scorching buggers? And I work in a kitchen for God sakes. There's something roof burning about the internal temperature of these chicken wings so order a small (cold) appetizer to help keep your hunger at bay. May I suggest the cold cucumber plate with garlic and mild spices? Excellent choice. Overall, dinner was gut busting good. My stomach and my brain told me to stop eating but gluttony took over and I kept twirling noodles around a black bowl and into my mouth. I couldn't help myself! Also, I'll point out that our server came back to us halfway through the meal with a Coke in hand 20 minutes too late with this explanation, "I thought she was going to change her mind and ask for water so I kept waiting." Yep, how awesome is that?

San Tung's famous "original dry-fried chicken wings" - how I love thee. Chicken wings deep fried in a light batter and then mixed with a slightly sweet and spicy light sauce of garlic, ginger, and roasted red peppers. YUM. For those who only like salty wings, may not be for you. And even though it may be counterintuitive, the dry-fried wings are the way to go, not the wet ones. They are about $9.50 for a dozen wings. Bottom line: Come off hours or do the grab and go of an order or two of wings. Otherwise the wait (and parking) can get downright silly. Dry fried wings, baby! (Oh yeah, they do have an extensive Chinese menu too... have not tried.)

This place was surprisingly yummy! Being a vegetarian who was fortunate enough to have been well fed by a heavenly vegetarian chef like my Momma, it's hard for me to dine anywhere with Asian cuisine because I'm really biased... my tastebuds are always comparing flavors to my mommy's cooking! Although they don't have an impressive selection for Vegematerians, their plates were aiite. I opted for the Braised Beancurd which wasn't so bad... can't go wrong with fried tofu. Only thing is that the I'm not a fan of the globs of gooey sauce chinese food tends to be smothered in. I just ended up drowning my tofu triangles in soy and chili sauce... and it was de-lishusss. [I have a salty tongue] My friend's brother and his gf go crazy over this place. They ordered a feast for like 30 people when there were only 4 of us. The garlic string beans are da bomb, and I hear their fried chicken is just as bombish. This joint gets packed up the heeezy! But I guess it's a normal thing there- they seated strangers at the same tables to save room and optimize dinner turnover. You know how we Chinese do, we'z naturally efficient like dat.

Best Chicken Wings I've Ever Had. There's got to be a reason why every single table has an order of chicken wings. ?Delicious. ?I prefer the dry wings over the wet. ?I don't find them to be spicy much although they're advertised as spicy. ?There can be quite a bit of people waiting, but the tables move relatively quickly so the wait isn't as bad as it looks usually. ?Overall, a very solid Chinese restaurant but I pretty much come here for the wings.

Sorry I just don't get why so many people think San Tung is so amazingly good. ?I have been here at least six or seven times, the food is OK but nothing to rave about and definitely not worth 30 to 40 min to just get a seat. ?They also over soy sauce the hell out of their dishes. ?The pot stickers are very good I will give them that but that is hardly enough for me to enjoy my dining experience. I did see another Yelper's review with a link to a news article detailing that San Tung was paying their employees under the table for a while and were fined by the city. ?I need to chew on that a while to see if I should downgrade them to one star but regardless I don't think I'm coming back. ?There are plenty of other Chinese restaurants that are just as good if not better.

This was the only good ?to come of my last date with What's Her Name. I love San Tung, and so does the rest of the neighborhood. ?I say get there before six if you don't want to wait for a table, but the food is worth the wait. I drool when I think of the dry fried chicken (on the bone or off) and the lemon chicken. ?Peanut noodles were great too, and the dumplings are so fine. ?honestly, I have never had anything sub-great here. ?Service is always above par, the prices are very fair, and it is a great place to go with a group of eight or ten and share things around the lazy susan. Thank you What's Her Name for showing me this place before we both silently vowed to never call each other again.

get ready to wait for 45 mins even though they quote you 10, and parking sucks!!!! so just get ready to wait. When I came to san tung ?I thought should I go? There are so many reviews, and I am not that big into this overly crowded sf crowd.. but everyone in the restaurant had fried chicken on their table so I knew I had to dine at san tung.. so 45 mins later and kimchee as my complimentary appetizer; I was kind of sold.... (the kimchee was sooooooooooooo spicy and good) HERE IS WHAT YOU SHOULD ORDER : - The original fried chicken - green beans - potstickers -chow mein THINGS YOU SHOULD NOT TRY - dumplings - tofu - sizzling rice soup - BLACK BEAN SAUCE NOODLES!! - I think I might have just thrown up a little bit in my mouth hahaha... AND YES I ORDERED THIS ALL, I HAVE A OVER ORDERING PROBLEM.....I need help.. but seriously.. if you do the must order.. you can't go wrong.. I won't come back to this place because I felt like the food came out of order which is one of my pet peeve's and I spent about 80 bucks on chinese food.. that just doesn't sound right.... but if you must try, get it to go....

Opa! The first thing a San Francisco soul needs after 2 months in Brazil and 10 days in Mexico is to go East. Problem: wanting good Chinese or Vietnamese and living in the Mission with a car that won't start. And being too jet-lagged (lazy) to take MUNI and too cheap (the $ ain't no peso) to take a taxi. Solution: friends call suddenly from the Canvas cafe in the Inner Sunset wanting to have dinner and offering to bring over takeout. Ray of light. San Tung. The last time I ate there it was heaven in my belly, but I waited for 2 hours in the fog and swore never again unless it was takeout. The phone rang once before a pleasant voice said "San Tung." The young man was so polite, so patient, and answered all my questions in satisfying detail ("there are 12 pieces in 1 order of dry fried chicken... touch your thumb to your middle finger - that's the size of the dumplings... the shrimp ones are good but people seem to order the pork with cabbage more... yes, it's called ja jang mein... spicy shrimp? well, there's shrimp with chili sauce and another dish with garlic... rice is $1.00 an order...). It was ready in less than 20 minutes, delivered to my dinner table by wonderful friends, and such such a pleasure for the mouth. My advice is to eat at the restaurant once to experience the excruciating wait and the round-table big-group racket. From then on, only get takeout.

I went on Sunday. The place was packed and the wait was long But it was worth it for me. I tried jjajangmyun and gganpoongi (fried chicken). Their jjajangmyun can easily be one of the best in the bay area for 1 reason. Their ingredients are fresh and wholesome. They aren't cheap on any of their ingredients. the scallop, shrimp, cucumber, etc. All were fresh and huge. I don't know how they do it but the fried chicken stayed temperature HOT for the entire meal which lasted about 30-40 minutes. It was good cuz the taste didn't change until the very end. It was bad cuz it was somewhat too hot to eat. ?Very tasty tho. This will be my go to jjajangmyun place in the city for sure.

Hands down some of the best ?I've ever had (the "dry" black bean noodles). And that includes what I've had in Korea. And the dry fried chicken wings were very good as well--the shrimp leek dumplings were just okay, I didn't like the skin because it was a little too thick, although the filling was pretty good. Bland compared to the jajangmyun and chicken though. Just to clarify: "dry" jajangmyun is when the black sauce is fried in oil, separate of the noodles, before being poured on top. () "wet" jajangmyun is when, after the black sauce has been made (it is not fried, it is made in a pot. Like tomato sauce.) it is poured directly on the noodles, without the extra step. ( ) I wouldn't have understood this if I didn't see the Korean, so just thought I'd explain that in case anyone is confused.

Although it's probably pretty obvious from the existing 700+ reviews that this place is awesome, let's add one more for good measure. There is a reason that there is always a line and its always crowded. ?As everyone says the wings are the best, but there is oh so much more to like. ?The shrimp and leek dumplings are pretty phenomenal as well as the duck, the roasted chicken and anything else that is not white people Chinese food. Do not go to San Tung if you just want Kung Pao or Sweet and Sour chicken. ?That's what Panda Express is for. ?:D

Was going to give this place 4 stars...until the intestinal upset the next morning! ?If it were just my husband, fine...but my iron-lined stomach was affected as well. ?No matter how good it is going down, can't give props to any restaurant that results in the big D We were excited to finally try San Tung after all the recommendations from friends and the yelpers. ?Didn't have to wait too long for a table despite being a Thursday night. ?Looked through the menu, but we already had a good idea of what we wanted! 1. ?Fried chicken wings. ?They're as good as advertised, with a nice combination of sweet and savory. ?As well as the nice crunchy outside. ?So good that I hope they weren't the source of GI upset, since I'm going to try them again 2. ?Black bean noodles. ?Neither my husband or I liked this dish. ?First, they were lukewarm, not piping hot. ?More importantly, the style was a mediocre version of neither the Korean nor Chinese dish. ?Plenty of seafood...but just not that good. 3. ?Pork dumplings. ?I loved the quantity (12!) and the flavors were quite good. ?However, having had the best dumplings a few months ago in Shanghai, these just didn't measure up. 4. ?Vegetarian bean curd. ?A nice surprise. ?Nicely cooked veggies and good garlicky flavor. So, not a bad meal during the time we were there. ?Next time (if there is one), we'll stick with the chicken wings. ?Pleeeez...don't be the cause of the diarrhea!

Since I've hardly waited half an hour for a dinner at Chinese restaurant, I knew immediately Sun Tung Chinese Restaurant deserved my yelping attention. I tried 3 dishes here since there were only my girl and me, and they all delivered within my expectation. -Dried Fried Chicken, 5/5 ?Amazing fried chicken with crispy skin, sweet and salty flavor, and fresh white meat inside. -Mushu Beef, ?4/5 ?Authentic combination of stir fried beef, cabbage, mushroom, and onion. ? The wrapping is what makes this special, as it is soft, tender, and not overly greasy. -Shrimp and Leet Dumplings. ?4/5 ?Very succulent in the filling yet the shrimp meat is marinated just right to sweeten the overwhelming taste of leets. The skin could be a bit more firm, it is a bit on the watery side. 4/5 stars for the authentic San Tung cuisine.

Sizzling soup is yummy! Went for a going away party and was not disappointed! I was wondering what all the hype was and all the reviews are correct! The sizzling soup is served right in front of you and is delicious. The wings are a must to order! They're sweet and crunchy. Service was fast and efficient. It was extremely packed and we had to ask for a refill on water and tea, but not horrible. Definitely would come back! Went with 9 people and ordered a lot of food and only paid $14 with tax and tip!

I absolutely LOVE this place. It was one of the first places a friend of mine brought me to when I moved to the Bay Area and even now, a few years after moving away from my beloved Bay, I still love this place. It's not fancy. It's a hole-in-the-wall, but those are the best. My faves are their dumplings. It doesn't matter which ones you get, it's all good. The potstickers are to die for. The "san tung" chicken is the best I've ever had. I've tried 'san tung' chicken in many different restaurants and this one is definitely one of the better ones. They can get super busy so we always try to hit it during the down times -- after the lunch rush after 2pm or just before dinner time before 6pm. Parking sucks, but it's worth the driving around and around the neighborhood trying to squeeze into a spot to eat here.

After a little bird me to try this place out, stating that the fried chicken was a must try, I decided to get it a try. We were lucky to come right in time when groups were leaving and there was a line on a bright and Sunny SF day. Our little bird told us to get these 3 things: dumplings, dry soy sauce noodles, and (of course) the dry fried chicken. ?The dumplings and noodles are said to be made fresh/home made/ etc. First up is the dumplings. ? The skin of it looks different, and you can easily tell that they were handmade. ?Hand made dumplings is pretty rare where I'm from (San Jose), so it's a nice delight. ?The feeling was really different from the other bought frozen dumplings from other Chinese places. ?It doesn't have that "normal" taste to it where everything is mushed together. ?Instead, you have finely mixed pork with green onions and other greens. ?The greens have a very light taste to it which gives it a little light spark. Dip these dumplings in a sauce mix of 1/2 soy sauce and 1/2 vinegar and you've got smile on your face. ?Don't expect that heavy meaty taste. Next were the dry soy sauce noodles. The sauce was thick and plentiful and was easily making our dry noodles into wet noodles. ?The noodles are somewhat thick and cooked just right. ?The taste of the blend of noodles, thick soy sauce, cucumbers, squid, and other seafood was a little disappointing to me. ?The sauce, as thick as it was, is very very light tasting, and the seafood (squid) was overcooked. ?I think next time I come up, I'll give the black bean noodles a try, I love black bean sauce! Lastly, the dry fried chicken. I came here with a comparison in mind, 99 Chicken, Santa Clara's awesome korean fried chicken. ?The chicken is fried right where it's still juicy inside, and crisp outside. ?The glaze on the chicken is light and sweet. ?That is all I got out of the chicken. ?I even tried sniffing it a couple of times to smell the aroma but nothing. ?Weird. ?The chicken was just "eh" okay to me. ?Nothing like 99's sweet and spicy chicken. All in all, most of the food was cooked just right, and authentic Chinese isn't always full flavor as general "Chinese" restaurants lead you to believe. ?So I give it 3 as it wasn't great, but it was decent. Our 3 plates costed: $28

The fried calamari is crispy and fried just the way I like it Ja Jang Myum was okay....the kimchee tasted weird Came here with a group of 8, took awhile to get seated...definitely try not to go during peak hours becuase you have a wait awhile.

From the creators of SO comes the original bad boy in Chinese/Asian Fusion cuisine in the Inner Sunset: San Tung. ?(Thx for the info, Jane L hahah) The long wait for a party of four for lunch on a Saturday afternoon was rewarded 30 or so minutes later. ?We were lucky and beat the rush. ?They brought out hot tea and kimchi made with the wrong kind of cabbage that was overly spiced. ?Nice try... We ordered the Jajangmyeon (#7), which tastes just like the one at SO. ?Not the Korean kind but the lighter tasting version. ?This is the kind I grew up eating when my mom and I went out for black noodles so I'm a big fan. ?The noodles are chewy and absorbs the sauce very well. ?NYAAMMSS!! Steamed wontons were nothing special... just a nice start to the meal. Seafood noodle soup was soothing and filling with chunky pieces of shrimp, calamari, scallops, and veggies. ? Chicken wings were definitely the highlight of the meal. ?Succulent and finger-licking yumminess! ?If my fingers weren't attached to my hand, I might have gobbled them up, too... ?It's fried and then marinated in awesome sauce, creating layers of flavors that are out-of-this-world delicious. ?Wings of an Angel they are... and I noms them up. I'd come back just for the chicken wings but maybe to-go because the wait in line (although not so bad for us that day) was a bit ridiculous... ?OR, go to SO cause they have the same wings and black bean noodles.

Who would you fight for the last piece of chicken? The dry fried chicken from San Tung is one of those treats I find myself daydreaming about from time to time. ?One order of the chicken gets you a plate full of drummettes and wings coated with a thick sweet and spicy sauce. ?I can chow on this by itself with a bowl of rice. But San Tung provides an assortment of other goodies including soup, dumplings, noodles and a variety of vegetable, meat and seafood dishes. ?Most of the food is a bit oily and salty though. So, be sure to have tea and ice water. ?I find that some of the vegetables in the dishes to be over cooked, so they come out soggy and coated with oil. Though the sauteed string beans and the spinach and garlic are a couple of good vegetable items. I also recommend the shrimp and leek dumplings and the noodles with peanut sauce. The interior is very standard, nothing fancy. The service is decent, nothing out of the ordinary for an Asian restaurant. ?San Tung usually gets busy around lunch and dinner time. ?And you can find yourself waiting outside for a good 15 - 30 minutes on most nights. The parking around the area can be rough and is mostly metered. I would give this place three stars but I'm tacking on a fourth just for the dry fried chicken. So, who would I fight for the last piece of chicken? ?I'd fight... **EDIT 11/7/07** Tried their Dry Fried Calamari. ?So, freaking good. ?Does anybody know what they put in their sauce. ?Please, let me know!!!

Shrimp Dumplings? Pork Dumplings? Fried Chicken? That's all I ever want when I come to San Tung. I don't care for all the other good foods. Feed me dumplings and chicken wings and I'll be happy. Thanks. I would give it 5 stars if they somehow remodeled the restaurant so that people who are waiting aren't breathing over your shoulders for you to hurry up and finish so they could get your table. Also, if you have seats next to the door, it gets pretty cold when people come in and out of it.

Write your name on the clipboard...and wait...and wait...and...oh, wait. If you have a large party, forget it..be prepared to wait at least an hour. The Sunset has an abundance of Chinese restaurants yet this place always has a line out the door anytime during the week. Parking here isn't so desirable either so drop off your partner to get your name on the clipboard ASAP. I do give credit to the chicken wings though since they are the prefect balance between crispy goodness and sweet/tangy flavor. The service is pretty quick so be prepared to know what you want off the menu the minute you sit down as plates and utensils are plopped in front of your face with the quickness. Minus points because as the months have gone by, the place has only gotten dirtier with time, but I guess that's expected with all the people that frequent here. So if you're craving some Chinese food in the Set, bring your DS Lite to entertain yourself while waiting in line for your name to be called.

I am going to give this place 4 stars. ?5 stars for the food minus 1 for difficulty of parking. ?(I know its not their fault... ). ?We spent 15 minutes looking for parking and we still couldn't find any, we ended up getting the food to go and eating it in my car.... yes... my friend and i did reach a new low. ? ?we actually parked in front of a church with the emergency light on, and we actually got kicked away... by a church. ?But, I digress. Anyways, like everyone else, my friend and I got the chicken wings... well, they are so good. ?At first I thought maybe it is because we were really hungry and that was why they tasted so good, but when I reached my 6th wings, which was my last one (since my friend and I split the order), it was still as good as the first. ?In fact, I was really sad to see that i didn't get to see anymore... We also ordered the "wet" black bean noodles... and yes we ate that in my car... ?and i don't need to tell you what a feat that was... ?without getting the sauce everywhere. ?The noodles was super. ?The noodles didn't get soggy, and since we didn't end up eating that till almost 45 minutes after we ordered it, i was happily surprised. ?the black bean sauce was really good, too. ?But i kinda wish that it had more meat. ? All and all, i thought it was worth driving there and eating the food in the car. ?Seems a little insane, but man those chicken wings....

So I have a friends who is really Chinese. Really Chinese meaning he probably speaks more Cantonese than English despite being born and raised in the states. Whenever we eat at a Chinese restaurant or go for dimsum, he orders everything without even glancing at the menu. And shit is good. And really damn cheap. If I were to go to the same restaurant, the results would be drastically different. With that being said, he would probably think of coming here. Not that he doesn't like it (because he does) -- it just doesn't top his list in regards to Chinese food. But for me and the rest of the non-native Cantonese speaking folk, there is a glass ceiling. And San Tung is as good as it gets. But to be honest, none of that matters. I was going to give five stars just for having kimchee.

I've tried going here...a few times now. ?Usually, I'm too starved and/or it's too cold to wait for a table. This time...we waited, indoors, and got a table in under 7 minutes! ? Food = good. ?It's not overly greasy (yes, it's a good thing!!!) ?[I'm reading prior reviews that mentions the grease, and we did not see much of it during our experience last eve.] We tried their pork dumplings. ?Delicious, plentiful pieces of heaven melting in my mouth. ? We also tried their mixed vegetables, which was in a light sauce without much grease, which my sister and I devoured. Tried their black bean noodles (shrimp,beef,calamari) one, which was very different for us. ?It was a very dark sauce but surprisingly not overwhelmingly salty. ?The sauce consisted of black beans, onions and eggplant, which was just delicious. ?And you must, MUST slurp the noodles. ?Yum. ? Also we tried their satay beef (with baby corn) which had a very unique flavor that I haven't tried often. ?It's not as 'peanut-y' as the thai/american dishes that I have tried before. ?I liked the dish, but I wished there were more vegetables involved. ? The menu was very interesting...it is mostly Chinese (and english) but also Korean characters. ?I didn't realize that there was so much Korean in this neighborhood (as I noted another restaurant down the street with the same sort of menu.) ? Their green beans and dry fried chicken seem to be a popular thing...so maybe next time! ? Parking = typical hell. ?Good luck. ? The only thing I did not like about this place, was their tea, it was tea bags!

The long dinner line has always been a deterrent for us to revisit over the years. ?But, this month we were able to come here for lunch a couple of times and I would recommend if you have a weekday off or early AM on a weekend, to come here to try the food. It's a bit pricey for Chinese food with most entrees over $9 but we liked the following recommendations by Yelpers: dry friend chicken - get the dinner portion as lunch portion only gives you 6. ?You won't regret the extra pieces to take home for late night or next day snack/meal. ?This dish should be eaten hot out of the kitchen. ?Crispy fried chicken wings, drumettes topped with red chili and a glaze of sweet soy-honey sauce, sticky good and lightly gooey. ?A real finger-licking sensation. Steamed dumplings - we tried the pork which had a nice thin-skinned wrapper and moist meat inside. ?Just so good with vinegar/chili oil dipping. The chicken fried rice was pretty good too. Potstickers were nice and crispy on the outside and the meat was also tasty and moist. They're known for their hand-pulled, homemade Chinese noodles. ?They are really, really long when you order a bowl. ?We tried the bean sauce one and didn't like the sauce (came w/vegts mixed in) but the noodles were very good. ?We wouldn't order this again. ? They have other dishes worth trying but unless you're here before 5PM for dinner, it's going to be difficult to get a table without a bit of wait.

The chicken here is the real deal. It's definitely worth waiting for at least once to decide if 40 minutes in the harsh environs of the inner sunset are worth the delicious crispy morsels that reward the brave. the jyangjamun (dry black bean noodle) is pretty tasty. I've never had it before, and this category of chinese food made for korean people is sounding pretty interesting. We also go the cold noodles which I thought were a little too sweet? Hard to say. Shrimp and leek dumplings were solid as well.

Yup, gotta up this place to 5 stars because it is simply the best Chinese/Korean restaurant out there. ?Last time I went, it was right when the restaurant opened for the day so there was no wait. ?But on Sunday night, the wait was crazy! ?There were so many people and most of them decided to wait INSIDE. ? Tonight we got the jam pong (which is a seafood noodle soup dish on the menu) and it was SO GOOD. ?The Korean bf says it's one of the best he's ever had and although I haven't had it very often, it's one of the best I've had also. ?The broth is thick and hearty and SPICY. ?The noodles are a great consistency. ?The dish gives a good amount of shrimp, mussels, etc. ?The portion is HUGE. ?All we had to get was the original dry fried chicken and this and it was more than enough for both of us. ? For being an incredibly busy Asian restaurant, the service was pretty good. ?Don't expect them to wait on you constantly but if you need something, just ask and they will get it for you.

OMG best chicken everrr (dry fried)!!!!!!!!!!! My friend said not to get the wet chicken. They have both boneless and bone-in chicken...and what makes it so good is that it's sweet also. I think they use honey?? They have kimchi to start-off, and surprisingly, the waiters are personable and really nice. We got the private room since our party was so large, but on a Saturday afternoon, we got seated in less than 2 minutes. MUST TRY!

Damn! ?1,000+ reviews. Came late, no wait, hunger pain won't abate. ? I've never been a fan of fried chicken wings because the skin gives me the willies. ?I've never appreciated the fattyness and texture of skin. ?However, the "crack" chicken wings at San Tung put all the rest to shame. ?Simply put, perfectly balanced flavor of sweet, tangy, and salty. ?The texture is perfect crunchy bliss. ?I now have a new found love for chicken wings thanks to San Tung. ?Everything else was average.

Their dry fried chicken wings were pretty yummy!!! My BF had been talking about their sister restaurant, SO, had similarly fried chicken... and wanted to compare the two. ?We came on a Sunday at around 12ish and there was only one group waiting ahead of us, so we didn't wait very long to be seated. For those newbies out there, make sure you write your name down on the dry erase board by the door with the number of your party. Tea was promptly brought to the table, and we asked for a few more moments to look over the menu. We decided on an order of these infamous dry fried chicken wings, garlic sauteed string beans, an order of their pork and veggie dumplings, and steamed rice. We should've passed on the dumplings. They came out looking unappetizing and pale, and really didn't taste very good. Ick. The string beans were good, but how can you really mess up anything sauteed in garlic? A little over-priced though if you ask me, at $8 a plate. Service was typical, "drop food off at table and go". There was this one server that walked around looking like he thought he was better than everyone. I wanted to slap the smirk off his face. Haha. Parking was SO hard to find! It definitely was not our lucky day. We had to park about 2 blocks away and walk down to the restaurant. But parking in SF sucks in general anyway... so as long as you can get over that... make your way over here to try out the wings!

San Tung is a favorite spot for Chinese food in the Sunset. ?It's famous for it's dry fry chicken amongst other flavorful and delicious dishes. Here are a few of our favorites: Dry fried chicken: ?These are crispy yet tender chicken wings in a spicy, sweet, and garlicky sauce Black bean sauce noodles: ?fresh homemade noodles that are tender and chewy (not mushy) are cooked al dente and stir fried with beef, shrimp, and calamari in a dark soy bean sauce. Hot braised flounder fillet: ?crispy fillet of flounder with spicy sauce Dried sauteed string beans: ?these are fresh string beans that are flash fried then sauteed in a garlicky sauce Parking is quite difficult in the evening around the area. ?You will see a line starting to form around dinner time, so come early. I'd rather go here for lunch to beat the crowds, but it gets crowded even then!

MUST orders: *dry fried chicken *dry fried green beans *shrimp & leek dumplings I've only had San Tung twice (which isn't enough, considering I've lived in the city for the first 18 years of my life and I come to the city every weekend!) and had these dishes twice. I also had 2 noodle dishes, but I can't remember which one was the good one - make sure you get the correct recommendation! My friend told me to get the spicy seafood noodles (she said it was saucy), but we ended up with some soupy one that wasn't all that great :( Oh well, I still love San Tung anyway! Tip: Don't want to wait in that horrendous line in the Sunset fog? Call in, double park outside for 5 seconds to pick up your food, and enjoy your meal at home :)

Tis place has some very good dishes. Shuijiao, chicken wing(dry kind), and five spice chicken. They are all very tasty. Restaurant is not big, and not fancy at all. All male waiters. Go early, or you'll have to wait :-(. But I won't order zhajiangmian though. This is not the best zhajiangmian. Way too much sauce. It looks unpleasant. When it doesn't look good, don't eat it.

Many years ago, back when I was a law school student and living off of loan checks, a friend introduced me to San Tung. It was like introducing a future drug addict to her dealer. ?Although I liked the variety of drugs my dealer was peddling (the free spicy kimchee, the fresh shrimp and leek dumplings, the hearty black bean noodle dish), it was the dry fried fish that hooked me. Oh my god, the fish. The fish was always tender and flaky. ?The coating was this sticky, sweet, and spicy sauce. I could never just have one hit. One time, my friends and I came to San Tung for lunch. ?Then, to the amusement and horror of the wait staff at San Tung, we returned for dinner. ?Yes, that night we were ill from eating too much, but we couldn't help ourselves. It was difficult to control my addiction in those days. I'm much better now and can spread out the visits. ?And even after all these years, the fish is still addictive. So, believe the hype. This place is THAT good. And YES you are missing out if you haven't tried this place.

For me, this is a substitute for the closed Korean-Chinese restaurant: SO.. ?Ohh. how i miss that place!!! i only come here for the memories of SO. ?First, i was glad i have found a some-what similar substitute, but after a few visits, my liking for this place just go DOWN..Down..down hill. ?The rude and slow service, fake Chinese food, oily and loaded with MSG ...i can go on and on....However, there are a few good food in that SH***TY menu: the dry fried chicken ?and the spicy seafood noodle are quite good. ?i have to admit, they are extraordinary good! ?But it just ends there, everything else on their menu is a turn-off: the potstickers i tried are just fattening giant thick dough with flavorless meat inside, the black bean seafood noodle is disappointing...

I was really excited to finally visit San Tung because of all the hype but before you read this review, let me preface by saying that I've been eating Chinese food my entire life, I have visited and eaten in many parts of Asia extensively, and I have eaten at many, many Chinese restaurants in the bay area. This place is a SOLID 2.5 stars. ?I really don't understand the hype over this place. ?The dishes are your average Chinese dishes and a bit overpriced. ?What's with the chicken wings? ?I agree they are tasty but it's really nothing special ... there are plenty of other places that make them just as good or better and charge less. ?New Hoa Ky on Geary and 4th comes to mind. If you want better Chinese food and not have to wait 30-45 mins for a table, I recommend heading down the street to Go Go Cafe.

Oh wow, I almost forgot about this place. ? Where else to go when looking for the saltiest, greasiest, yet pretty tasty Chinese food? ?This would be it. Since the Sunset is pretty much cloaked in fog and drizzle, when I am out visiting my friend there, we walk across the street for some of this spicy stuff. The noodles were great, thick and not too doughy texture, sauteed with the right amount of chili oil and vegetables. ?The dry fried chicken wings are indeed a must, as is indicated in almost every review here. ?And since it was especially chilly that night, we opted for some of their won ton soup and I think I died and went to heaven. ?The broth was no too salty, with lots of flavor from the rich won tons stuffed full with pork and spices...... Cheap and easy access. ?Great food. ?What more could anyone ask for?

Unlike the evening or weekend scene there is hardly a line when you dine here for lunch on a weekday. ?Either that or I have been extremely lucky each time I have visited here. Like everybody else I love the Original Dry Fried Chicken with its amazing spices and sticky-sweet exterior. ?Heck, these are good even after sitting in a take-out box for several hours. ?The steamed pork dumplings are very good too with a burst of liquid on the first bite. ?They make their own noodles here and I like the Dry Black Bean Sauce Noodles with shrimp, calamari and scallops. ?I enjoy the Chicken Soup Noodles which has tons of mixed vegetables. ?The soup is kind of cloudy and too salty on occasion, but the fresh noodles are delicious. ? Service is quite good ... fast and efficient. ?Go ahead and tell the boss you have a weekday afternoon doctor's appointment; there's no line at San Tung!

This place might just bring us back to Chinese food...we were turned way off from the entire cuisine by a bad experience at another place...ok it was Chef Gia's...but this place was very good, clean and fresh.

It's true, the parking situation sucks. But that isn't San Tung's fault. This is the Inner Sunset, after all. The wait sucks even more, but handy tip that I shouldn't really be putting here on Yelp for the world to see: if you call 15-20 minutes ahead and, preferably in fluent Chinese, tell them that you're on your way and act like you're a regular, they'll put you on their whiteboard list for you before you even arrive. SHHH. I never said any of that. I've been coming to San Tung's since they were a small hole in the wall on 24th and Irving. Before the hype, before the dry fried chicken wings got out to the rest of the world, and before they jacked up the prices because of it. I've probably been to ST's almost fifty times, with both friends and family, so I think I've been here enough to gauge if it's really worth it or not. And if it isn't obvious by now, yeah, I think it is. :) Aside from the parking and wait, the food comes easy. You only need to remember your three basics: dumplings, noodles, and chicken wings. For vegetarians, the dry fried string beans are delicious as well. But . . . repeat after me, dumplings (tender ground pork and napa cabbage in their freshly made dumpling skin), noodles (hand-pulled and served in a piping hot bowl of their delicious broth - the Deluxe Spicy Combo is my absolute FAVORITE, but if you don't want so much of a kick, ask for it non-spicy) and their dry-fried chicken wings (piping hot, crunchy, sweet and garlicky - so worth the hype). Order two of each, and multiply that number accordingly depending on the number in your party. Remember: dumplings, noodles, and chicken wings.

Hello. My name is O and I am a crack addict. (I'm going to assume you're saying, "Hi O" in an empathetic manner.) It all started when my friend took me to San Tung on a great November afternoon as a Welcome Home gift. Friend is a native San Franciscan and Chinese, so I trusted her instincts. But trusting someone so easily is the easy way to the dark side. I didn't know what I was getting myself into. I swear. All of a sudden spinach dumplings and potstickers were placed in front of me. And then a plate of kimchee, because even though it's a Chinese restaurant, kimchee just made sense right now. Something suspicious with this whole plot. And then dried braised string beans - the same ones taken from the giant mound of green beans being picked at by two bored ladies on the lazy susan at the adjoining table. Then the noodles in spicy peanut sauce. My pupils are beginning to dilate. I'm speaking in tongues. However, all this errant behavior was before the crack. Spicy dry fried chicken. Oh Lord. I ate. Then I ate some more. And then I ate some more. I couldn't stop. No. I didn't know how to stop. No. I didn't WANT to stop. I started harboring strange thoughts: push myself over the edge and render myself comatose or do I pull back into the realm of sanity and promise to stay clean? Do I decide I'm going to marry my chopsticks or do I think a RealDoll is a better option? Obviously if I'm admitting I'm an addict you know which decision I took. I'm now a good 900 miles away and I'm beginning to get the shakes. But try and watch me give a rat's ass. For this is one high that'll last me until I come back to score my next hit. 5 stars, all wanted by the DEA.

My former boss used to bring the whole team here for team lunch after his budget got a little tight. ?We work in the FiDI but we would still take a cab here.

Their dry fried chicken wings are the absolute best! Better than bonchon, kyochon and all the other korean ones down in la. This is probably the only thing i will admit is better than la. Their bean sprouts are good too. I also had the san tung chicken with cucumbers which was not bad, but the fried chicken is what makes this place stand out.

DRY FRIED CHICKEN WINGS. SWEET, OILY, CRUNCHY, SOFT INTERIOR, DELICIOUSNESS. it was a celebration for my taste buds. Just a heads up, don't bother having proper etiquette when eating these nomnoms. Just grab those wings with your bare hands & enjoy. Pork dumplings were pretty good, but nothing special. The black bean noodles were good, but a little dry for my liking. THOSE GREEN BEANS WERE BOMB. I would come back just for a plate of those green beans, even though I live in SoCal. I would still drive up to SF for the wings & green beans.

Disappointment and cheated. That's what I felt after finishing my meal at San Tung. With all these awesome praises for this restaurant, I honestly was expecting much more. Maybe it was too hyped for its own good. Maybe all the 2200 other Yelpers have horrible taste buds. All I know is that San Tung isn't worth the long wait that they make their customers suffer through. I decided to come here on a Saturday with a bunch of friends for lunch. Being that none of us have been here and have only heard great things, we were expecting some EPIC chicken. We decided to order: - Dry Fried Chicken - Shrimp and Leek Dumplings - Black Bean Sauce Noodles - Fried Calamari - Mongolian Beef - Spinach - Honey Shrimp To be honest, I'd give the dry fried chicken a 3.5 star, and everything else a 2 or 2.5 star. The shrimp and leek dumplings were nothing memorable, and the black bean sauce noodles were utterly bland. I was expecting a different taste for the fried calamari, because it came out to be glazed with a sweet/sour flavor. Not my cup of tea. Can't really knock on the mongolian beef, spinach and shrimp because it wasn't horrible. But then again, it wasn't epic either. Now onto the dry fried chicken. For $9, it comes in a set of 12 wings/drumsticks. They came out as expected. Crispy skin with a sweet flavor. To be honest, it was good, but it wasn't 'holy crap' awesome. You could easily compare this to a Bon Chon or Kyo Chon fried chicken, which you don't have to wait in line to eat. San Tung has a bunch of hype. Naturally, I'm curious to try legit spots, but this place didn't do it for me. I'd come back again if someone treated me to dinner and I didn't have to wait in line. Otherwise, I can find better elsewhere.

I went here based on all those glowing Yelp reviews. ?We came in exactly 11:00 AM. ?Some waiter was busy vacuuming the floor but no one sat us. ?My father decided to plant himself on any of the tables (hey you could have served us but since you didn't we'll make an executive decision). Some guy comes by and plops down the menus, we ask for a high chair for the Kid. ?Guy says yeah but never comes back we see him flitting in and out of the kitchen but no highchair (we were the only ones here at the time, so how hard is it to serve us?). ?Finally another guy comes by and drops off some tea and we ask for a highchair again. ?This time he brings back a wooden one w/ a broken strap (thanks for nothing!). ?We drop the Kid in the chair hoping he doesn't climb out during the meal. Good Food - the steaming dumplings although they were sorta lazy and didn't give us any vinegar w/ ginger. ?My father asked our waiter where the sauce was and he just pointed to the condiment container (thanks bud). Bad Food - Where to begin (thus my one star review. ?Only the dumpling was any good!)? ?Ordered the potstickers (it came out fried?!?!? ?What the heck?). ?Eh, not impressed. ?Paid an additinal $2 to get their homemade noodles for the veggie & seafood chow mein. ?First of all, the servings were on the small side. ?Second, both dishes tasted like they were burnt (the food wasn't burnt but there's a bitter, burnt taste!). ?There's nothing special about these noodles. ?I can make better noodles w/ a pasta press! ?Oh yeah, major deductions, we left feeling HUNGRY! Service - or lack thereof. ?I've never met a bunch of grumpier old men outside of an elderly care facility in my life! ?Waiters were barely coherant and they basically offered us no service. ?They treated us like we were eating there for free! ?Since someone else paid for the lunch, I couldn't deny them a tip but if I controlled the wallet they would get zilch from me! ?To add insult to injury, we our check came out to $86!?!?! ?I've listed what we ate and no way did that food amount to $86. ?We practically had to doodle out our own math in their cheap paper placemats before we grabbed a server to complain. ?No apologies nothing. ?Losers. San Tung = Yuck. ?I'll never come here again. ?I don't get the hype!

The famed chicken wings (original) were a bit sweet for my taste, I would have preferred it without the glaze. ?The spicy seafood soup wasn't my favorite and the bean thread noodle dish was good, but a tad salty. English is spoken and service is quick. ?Prepare to wait though, I mean really wait. UPDATE: Had the chicken wings again, ordered dry, and this time they came dry. I guess the first time we got the wrong order and they gave us the wet version. We also had shrimp and leek dumplings, kung pao chicken, dry sauteed green beans. I'd order the dry wings and green beans again.

Agree with what CT said below - I really do think San Tung puts crack in their chicken wings. I was such a fatty mcfat tonight, it's a wonder I was even able to walk to the car afterwards. The MUST-haves: dry fried chicken wings (get the dry version - no garlic sauce - and get wings, not diced) and black bean sauce noodles (dry, not wet). Also good: Steamed potstickers and three spice noodles. However, these dishes were totally overshadowed by the wings and other noodle dish. We went on a Sunday - if you're going for dinner, recommend arriving at or before 5 p.m. to avoid a wait. We got there right at 5 p.m. and only had to wait 5-10 minutes. If we had gotten there 10 minutes later, our wait would have been 20+.

Like my previous review... you can't really go wrong with the chicken wings here. Stay with the tried and true and you'll leave a happy camper. The mushu pork was pretty good, flavorful, but the wraps were uber thin and pretty much just broke if you didn't double it up. Also, thumbs up to the honey walnut shrimp and the fried rice. After awhile it seems as if almost every dish was just cooked with the same sweet style sauce the wings were cooked in... To add to the dishes to stay away from cherry fried pork fried flounder

Bonchon with a Chinese twist! ? The fried chicken here is a lot like what you would expect from Bon Chon.. double fried yet more juicy and with a chili garlic honey flavor. ?It's what they're famous for and you can guarantee every table in the restaurant has a plate of these. San Tung also has delicious dumplings. ?Pan fried, steamed.. I suggest you just order one of each because they're that good. ?The hot and sour soup is also note worthy as well as the cold noodle dishes (ja jeng mein). ? My only advice to you is to get here early and be prepared to wait. ?Avg 1.5 hr wait on a Saturday night... and they close EARLY.

There are many random days/evenings/nights where I would just crave San Tung's Dry Fried Chicken Wings...... enough said. That really is how addictive and memorable they are. Besides the wings, their five spices sliced beef appetizer, dumplings, and dry sauteed string beans are also worth a try.

Whenever I come across a Yelp review that describes the menu of San Tung #2 with elaborate detail, a sudden escalation of hunger overwhelms. This is definitely a solid Chinese restaurant that serves good food. The bowl of wonton soup to share was marvelous, the wonton wraps were cooked to perfection. ?The soup base was rich and perfectly seasoned so that there was no need to add a dab of pepper, salt or sauce. ?The veggies and mushrooms were abundant, the experience wonderful. We also shared a combination appetizer that consisted of the jellyfish, beef cold cuts, tofu, and tripe. ?The selection was a perfect combination of items that complimented each other in taste. The shrimp leek dumpling was good and the sweet and sour pork was amazing. ?A continuous side of kimchi was available during course of the meal. ? For take-out, we requested for an order of 12 pieces of chicken wings. ?As per popular feedback, it was indeed sumptuous and spicy.

I'm definitely a fan of San Tung and imagine I'll go again and again. There was roughly eight groups before us, but went by fairly quickly considering. 30 minutes later, my companion and I were seated at a four top...and later I realized it's because some people order so much that a table meant for two would be too small. We order: * dry fried chicken wings - THE best Asian chicken wings I've ever had. Crisp, sweet and a lil spicy. Now this is finger licking good chicken. I would come back for these wings alone! * cold noodles - fresh noodles with peanut sauce, veggies, tofu and beef was decent and a good accompaniment to the chicken. The noodles were soooooooo long it was hard to "chopstick" them into my bowl. Other ingredients were tasty, though the sauce was a bit too sweet for my taste. ?Flavors blended well. * string beans - Very tasty, and probably had three servings of the simply delicious string beans. Pretty bustling for 8:00pm, and right up until they close apparently! Staff is attentive enough. My main complaint is that the food didn't' all come at once....in fact, I almost finished an entire bowl of the cold noodles before the wings came, and then had a couple of wings and finished off my bowl before the string beans came. Again, I'm sure it'll make my rotation of go to Asian restaurants in the area. Mmmmmm...thinking of those chicken wings now.

Allright, So this review is about 15 years overdue. I LOVE THIS PLACE. I grew eating this place! eversince it was a small little shack on 20 something&irving. Their dumplings&noodles are soo wonderful. &their chicken too ! The wait is ridiculous&guess what, so is the parking. When you first go in, the decor may give you some doubts. but if the foods so dang good, THEY GOT NO TIME FOR THE DECOR ! ya digg ? You start off w/ tea&this spicyyyy kimchee. when i was about.. 5, i could not take how FREAKING spicy this kimchee was ! I used to put it in my tea cup &"wash off the spicy" as i used to say. but now, im an almost adult, so yeah i dont need to wash off the spicy anymore! The pork&napa cabbage dumplings are great. but the chives&shrimp dumplings... JACKPOT. The mongolian beef was flavorful&good... but the dry diced chicken, JACKPOT !! sizzle CHICKEN sizzle! The spicy seafoood noodle, wow. WOW. It gets me begging for water everytime, but for some reason, im well near addicted. its like my drug. my anti drug ? Everything there is decently price, so order away! The workers all remember my mommy&daddy from back in the old days. The boss lady too! so we get "special treatment" .. or thats what my parents think. whatever, id wait for this food !

Apparently this place is known for its dumplings and wings. We had 3 orders EACH of the following types: shrimp & leek dumplings, pork dumplings, and potstickers. My favorite by far were the shrimp & leek dumplings. I could eat an entire plate of 12 by myself. They were loaded with flavor and each one was a perfect bite size...if you have a big mouth like me. However I could have passed on the pork dumplings - they lacked flavor. We also had the dry-fried chicken wings which were a bit on the sweet side because of the sauce. Without the sauce, the wings were bland tasting. Go early if you don't like waiting for a table. By 5:30 on a Sunday evening, there was already quite a few parties waiting for tables. We were able to make a reservation for our party of 15 but we still had to wait a half-hour for our table.

Wait Time on a Friday at 3:30/4pm: 15 minutes (this is like in between meals - why the hell is there still a 15 minute wait?!) Don't Know What to Get: GET THE "Dry Fried Chicken". hmmm Dumplings - it's pretty good dumplings, the filling is very moist and similar to Shang Hai Dumplings + it doesnt leak out (a personal plus in my book). Dry Fried Chicken - its fried chicken lathered with a very sweet & spicy sauce, very similar to the fried chicken you get at the Korean Market or fried chicken at OB Chickentown! Wet Fried Chicken - less crunchy, but still a tad crispy, it's still lathered in loads of sauce. Family Style Vegetarian Dish - ended up not sounding like it was described, as Chinese people would call it "JAI" - its an all out vegetarian dish, I thought it was gonna be some mixture of green beans, tofu, choy, or something. Parking is somewhat bad, depends if you're lucky. If you plan to go in a larger group - its best to go earlier than the actual time you intend to eat cuz waiting/seating takes awhile especially if its a busy day/night (aka weekends or holidays). Definitely a gem in SF :D

I've been traumatized from the last time I was here. It wasn't the food or the restaurant, it was my date. He was out of line and I had to (literally) put his ass into check. Anyway. I ventured out here for lunch with 2 friends today. After we sat down I realized "Oh my god. I haven't been here since ?I was on that date with that Korean guy that later grabbed my ass" Brian: Oooooh yeaaaaa! Brad: Wait, some guy grabbed your ass here!? Susy C: Ehh, Never mind Brad. Forget it, let's just get some chicken. The chicken is worth it. The wait around dinner time varies from 45 minutes to over an hour. Good luck. Just come during the slow hours (2-5pm) and you'll be fine. The restaurant will be practically empty. The only downside is you still have to pay for metered parking. Oh, the service is bad here. Not the worst i've ever had but it's still bad. The chicken....is worth it.

Fried chicken wings? Check. Noodles? Check. Dumplings? Check. Happy stomach? CHECK! My first foray into Korean style fried chicken and I am in food love. I tried it dry and it had more than enough sauce. The sauce had this great sweet ginger flavor and is packed with tons of sugar to get this great sticky carmalized texture - so if you're diabetic this is probably a food no-no. There's a bunch of other yummy stuff too but my stomach only had room for chicken. YUM. Oh, did I mention it's pretty cheap? Dinner for 10 with a ridiculous amount of food set me back ~ $15 (with tip).

I won't review the fried chicken wings, or black bean noodle, because everyone else has, and any good restaurant should have good food aside from the things people talk about most. I will report on the following: * Shrimp and Leek Dumplings - ?garlic, ginger, shrimp, and chives covered in home-made skins, cooked to perfection. I mixed a little dipping sauce made with soy sauce, vinegar, and chili oil. Thumbs up! * Cold Noodles - cold noodles in a peanut sauce, topped with five-spiced cold beef. Tasty, but not spectacular. You have to be craving this to like it. * Three Deluxe Spicy Sauce Noodles - seafood in a thick spicy sauce (it isn't that spicy, so if you like heat, you may want to request them to up it a notch) over perfectly prepared noodles. Thumbs up. * The complimentary kim chi is Chinese-style, a bit sweeter than Korean, but nice and spicy. Thumbs up. It was a perfect amount for 2 in search of a carbo-load. The service is Chinese, like from China Chinese. Whether you think it is rude or not is perhaps a matter of perspective. It could be more refined, or personable. Perhaps when taking an order, the waiter could behave like he has my full attention. But, why do that, when he can take an order, monitor the door for new customers, observe that the bus boy has wiped the table precisely 5 seconds after the patron has stood up while still crunching on his fortune cookie, signaled to another waiter to bring tea to table 3, etc. He can multi-task, and take your order just fine. I'm usually happy if I get a "thank you, bye bye" when I leave, which I got. To such things, I'm reminded of Chuck Klosterman's essay about why Germans don't laugh out of politeness like Americans do, to which he concludes "This is not the only reason Germans think Americans are retarded, but it's definitely one of them." Not to say Chinese people think Americans are retarded. I'm sure it varies over the 1 billion of them, but only to say, when it comes to politeness, context is significant. One piece of advice on a practical note. Coming in at 3pm on a sunny Saturday, the place was near full, but there was no wait. ?I'd agree the food may not be worth waiting a ridiculous amount of time, but if you can get it with minimal wait, it's worth the time and money. (parking is 2 dollars per hour at the meters, so bring change if you are driving)

I struggled with posting a Yelp review for San Tung for a long time. Basically because I thought that San Tung was above a Yelp review and I didn't wanna blow the place up but I have come to love Yelp and really, the block is already hot so here it is... I've been going to San Tung for something like the past 4 years or and it is one of my top 3 fave restaurants of all time. My husband and I played the "what would you eat for your last meal" game and I'd want a humongo plate of dried fried beef if I only had one meal left on Earth. Everytime I go I have to get dried fried Beef (or calamri) which I think is better than the chicken and Mu Shu Chicken but I don't think I've had anything that there that wasn't really good. Newbies have to get used to the waiting system which is a little hard to get initially. The wait can be long during the typical meal times but I've also gone many times and had no wait at all. I just expect a long wait and I am pleasantly surprised if there isn't one. Going there for dinner tonight! Woo hoo!!!

Oh, San Tung, you greasy gods of wonder, I love you. ?Lent is over, Barrister's Ball is over, and I'm back to eating fried deliciousness. ? I have had the dry fried chicken wings, dry fried beef, dry fried string beans (are you sensing a theme here?), shrimp & leek dumplings, pork chow mein, cherry pork, and tomato beef chow mein. ? ?(If you're not in the mood to pick at wings, get the dry fried beef - it has the same delicious sauce but is easier to eat.) ?Most main dishes range from $7-13, and the portions are huge. Yep, there's a wait, and there doesn't seem to be any rhyme or reason to when people show up in droves. ?If I could tap dance, I bet I could pay for my meals by entertaining my fellow bored would-be patrons. ?In the mid-afternoon on a weekend, we waited about 15 minutes, but shortly after we were seated, there were 10 names on the board. ?Accordingly, they do rush you a bit, but I'm willing to put up with plenty for this food. So if you're starving, go to Panda Express, and if you're not, San Tung is a prime example of what Chinese food should be.

Crowds are constantly standing around outside. I've visited once around 8pm, the place was packed and another time at 3:30pm, the place was STILL packed. San Tung, how your delicious food is so hard to access... It's been said a billion times already, but I need to say it again. FRIED CHICKEN FRIED CHICKEN FRIED CHICKEN. ? Twice fried and glazed with sauce. Crispy, tangy, sweet on the outside; tender and juicy on the inside. So DELICIOUS. Shrimp and leek dumplings were also very very good. The filling was perfectly seasoned and had good chunks of shrimp in it. The only thing that disappointed me were the black bean noodles (Cantonese style). The sauce was flavored weirdly and it all seemed a little dry. I really prefer Taiwanese and Korean style over it. Also, expect to have to yell at the top of your lungs if you want to be able to carry on a conversation. But it's ok, your mouth will probably be preoccupied by chicken wings most of the time.

The service at this place is horrible and their food is overrated and OVER PRICED. ?I am pretty simple when it comes to Chinese food. The only OK thing in their menu are the chicken wings. Their fried rice is pretty blend and mushy at times, no flavor at all. Their soups are nothing special, their hot and sour is just a bunch of peas and cut up, rubbery, smelly "shrimp". They do not have egg-rolls or pot-stickers. I honestly do not understand why this place is always packed and why there is always a line. Their service in person and over the phone is horrible. ?They are rude and very condescending. ?Their prices are just ridiculous too. ?If you want some real, flavorful, authentic (what we call authentic here in America) and affordable Chinese food you may want to take yourself across the street to Golden Rice. I do not recommend this place at all: ?OVERPRICES, FOOD IS BLAH!, SERVICE IS HORRIBLE.

This review is for their chicken wings only: San Tung's dried fried chicken always reminds me of Mike Myer's line in the movie "So I married an Axe Murderer."--They put addictive chemicals in their chicken to make you crave it fortnightly!

On a recent road trip to SF, I made this place a must go. Granted I hadn't been able to revisit the place five years since I made my first discovery. I won't lie, I was nervous that the quality wouldn't be the same. Luckily San Tung did not disappoint. I've finally made my decision. Out of all the fried chicken wings I've had (LA, SD, Hong Kong, Hawaii), this place is hands down my favorite. I can't find another place that can beat these tasty morsels. If you're in SF vicinity, you'd be dumb not to make a stop here. I came here at 3pm and the place was still packed. What's that? ?You've never heard of this place and don't really want to try it since it's not a Michelin starred restaurant? ?Don't be a dumba$$, all you other restaurants have nothing when it comes to these wings.

There's a reason why this place has 2000+ reviews and still maintain 4 star average... That reason is not the service but the damn good food! So I thought this place would like any other Chinese restaurant and to a degree it is. What makes the difference is their super damn good tasting chicken wings! Dried fried wings to be exact. You have to try it to believe it. That's really all I can say about that. Is there other tasty foods on the menu? I think so but the only thing I can remember is not ordering enough of wings :( On a side note: The wait is pretty long... Lunch is not as long but still pretty long. It's well worth the wait though. If you're trying it out the first time don't let the wait discourage you from waiting it out.

If you want to eat at San Tung, Thought you might want to get a brief description of the regulars so you feel more at home and familiar as you enter this very busy /popular establishment. Here are some archetypes of some of the folk you may run into(don't be shy if one of these is YOU..wear it proudly!): [ASIAN CHURCH GOERS] Guys named Daniel, or Jason, or Jonathon who love navy blue cashmere, steve maddens, and some slightly spikey hair. ?They love to talk about work and work, and electronics.. The girls are GRACE, and JENNY, and RACHEL, who don't exactly like Daniel, Jason, or Johnathon but love to go eat w/them and love their financial company jobs. ? Try not to disturb them when they pray (to be seen by people as holy) before they eat. ? THEY COME FOR THE CHICKEN WINGS [ASIAN GANGSTERS] Bald headed, long white t-shirts, sometimes sporting cheap Kenneth Cole suits. ?Oftentimes can be seen outside w/cigarette in tow, fiddling w/their modified car's remote control as they talk on their Razor. THey are usually huddled together looking for someone from the Jason/John table to look at them badly (even though they were all classmates in middle school and played oh so well). ?They give a strong glare to the Chad Bradmans below as well. ? These guys named Jin, Brett, J-Mon, or John John sit w/Rachel's rebellious younger sister GINA filled w/peroxide hair..the tightest juicy couture jeans and some click click heels. THEY COME FOR THE CHICKEN WINGS [YUPPIE ASIAN COUPLES W/THEIR BABIES] Don't you LOVE how they call out their kids western names w/such pride..."ETHAN, or NATHAN" or "JOSHUA" ..w/sisters named "MEGAN, or "PAGE" ?with last name CHAN...KIM, or KAJIWARA. ?

You find a very tastey variety of korean-style chinese food. They serve a sweet/sour style chicken wing, so naturally it attracts the triple sow cow kryptonite coming around the mountain(bad fish w/gobs of sweet sauce) sushi roll crowd. ?Gotta love that suga. They serve a shrimp dumpling that is very tastey and not as bland as other traditional chinese places. ? Have that w/rice and some dipping sauce and you'll come back for more. Lastly, there's a korean/chinese fusion dish called "Tahng Soo Yock" (I'm spelling it phonetically..so you can pronounce it to the staff)... It's beef strips fried in flour batter w/a carmel style sweet/sour sauce. YES..I said sweet/sour sauce. ?it's sprinkled w/some sliced veggies. It's not visually appealing..but it tastes better than it looks. San Tung's tastey, prices are reasonable, but the place is always crowded. ?If you can bear the wait...you will really be rewarded by some good bang for the buck food. Say hi to Jin, Jason, Rachel, Gina, Brad and the kids ?"eat your shrimp dumpling and be a good boy ...okay baby Ethan Chan!" THEY ALL COME FOR THE CHICKEN WINGS

My friend recommended this restaurant claiming that it had really good Chinese food, so of course I had to try it. I came here for a late lunch and it was packed. They gave us a small back room, but we decided to wait to sit with the other customers. After reading Yelp reviews we ordered their well-known dry fried chicken wings, dry black bean noodles, shrimp and leek dumplings, Mongolian beef, wonton soup, and a chicken dish that I don't know the name of. Maybe we didn't order the right dishes, but the only thing I really loved was the dry fried chicken wings. It was crispy, sweet, tangy, and so addicting. I loved the taste and I would definitely come back here just for these wings. On the other hand, the other dishes weren't as outstanding as I had expected. I think I'll be coming back here specifically for the chicken wings, yum!!!

Visit Date: 08.09.2009 You can definitely tell how good a place is if you have to wait an hour outside just to get a table. Holy smokes, I've never done that for a Chinese restaurant before. And when I say Chinese I mean real Chinese food. Haha yet we ordered chicken wings, which isn't exactly a typical Chinese delicacy. We got the wet fried chicken wings and the dry fried chicken wings. Wet just means that the wings were doused in sauce after being cooked, while dry means that the sauce was coated on. The wet fried chicken wings were okay. The dry fried wings were very good, though I don't think they were 5 stars worthy. Also ordered some fried rice and veggies. Gonna have to get some other recommended dishes the next time I'm in SF.

I love the food here, service is pretty decent, but the long wait sucks. This place is known for some bomb @ss chicken wings. And guess what.... the original dry fried chicken wings is no joke. It's my fav dish here. It's tender with a mild spicy, bit of sweetness, and leaves your finger sticky. And like KFC's old saying, finger lickin good. I also would recommend: pork dumplings shrimp and leek dumplings dry black bean sauce noodles potstickers

I've actually been looking for a Chinese restaurant like this for awhile. ?Sure, I like Abacus, but it's sort of on a different level and serves a totally different genre of Chinese food. ? At San Tung, the service is slower and less refined, the menu has English subtitles, the tea is complimentary and free flowing, and the meal starts off with spicy, but well done Kimchi. ? After, reading all of the Yelp reviews, I had high expectations for the fried chicken wings, but I have to say that although they were good, there wasn't anything spectacular about them -- and the sauce was a little too sweet and sticky for me, as it kept getting stuck in my teeth. :~( ? Not to mention (as Cyn pointed out) they don't really fit in with the rest of the dishes on the menu. ? I really enjoyed the shrimp and kale dumplings/potstickers. ?Yum. ?The black bean noodles were good, but my favorite noodle dish was the seafood noodles -- a bit spicy, but flavorful. ? Expect a wait (we had a 20 minute wait on a Tuesday night) and a crowded dining room, but the good thing is the dishes come out pretty quickly and are spaced evenly throughout the meal service. ?I was also pretty stoked about the table side service for our sizzling rice soup. ?I'll be back, and if I lived in this hood, I'd probably be a regular here.

Their lunch specials are really the best deal. I usually order takeout and if you order for lunch they include soup. I fell in love with lemon chicken here but it's been hit or miss lately. Now I prefer the Mongolian beef over fried rice. Was expecting the beef to be spicier though since it tasted very mellow and had a lot of sauce on it. Even though it's lunch, the portions are big enough to either share with someone or last for two meals. Yes, I will continue to eat here for my rare lunchtime Chinese food cravings, even if it's out of my way (plus my coworkers love this place!).

The smartest thing that my friend and I have done to get their crack wings (aka Dry Fried Chicken Wings) was order takeout, walk over to Andronico's to grocery shop and kill 15-20 minutes, and walk back to pick up our order while everyone else was still waiting to be seated. ?If you don't live close enough to bring home crack wings, then, sorry (suckers), you gotta wait in line....

This place gets busy for lunch pretty much everyday. Parking is a disaster if you do not come early. Their self-pulled noodles are so delicious. They have that chewy consistency that this type of noodle should have. Their kimchee is spicy and not for those who cannot handle a bit of spice. We always order their stir-fried soup noodle. This is noodle in a spicy soup base topped with stir-fried meat, vegatable, and seafood. If you cannot take spicy, don't even bother with "mild" because the chili in the soup will burn. The pork dumplings are very good. They wrappers to the dumplings are done right, with them being a bit chewy. As you can see, the chewiness of their dough is what I think makes them different from the rest. Most shops have limp noodles that are mushy and not appetizing at all. Most people come for their dry fried chicken. I like the DRY dry fried chicken versus the wet one. The dry one has a bit of a spiciness to it along with sweetness from honey(?). The portions are pretty big. 1 order of dumplings and 1 order of noodle soup can fill 2 people up easily. Add another person, and the chicken will help fill you up. Come here early for lunch... or don't even bother showing up. And for dinner, it is not as busy. But be aware, parking here is horrible.

A typical dining scenario at San Tung: *Leave house and drive towards Irving *Find street parking about 2-4 blocks away depending if you're a lucky person *Run to the front to beat all else to the dry erase board *Write name and party on the dry erase board *Count how many tables with the same size party are before yours *Wait 1+ hour with the other 3487 customers outside for table while checking every 15 min how many tables are still before yours *Finally get seated 1 hr 23 min later *Order dry fried chicken, dumplings, and whatever else floats your boats (I like the seafood broth soup noodles and sautéed string beans) *Watch that as your dry fried chicken and dumplings come, all the other tables around you are also getting their dry fried chicken and dumplings San Tung is pretty overrated. It's true... their dry fried chicken and dumplings are pretty BOMB and unlike any other. Those are the two dishes you MUST and HAVE TO order every time you eat here or else what's the point of waiting in the SF cold for so long on a summer day? ?However, I don't think that their two staple dishes are worth the 1+ hours wait on the regular. It's a good place to catch up with friends in a festive environment and decently priced menu, over some mouth watering dishes but the wait always makes me think twice --- plus SF meter parking don't come cheap at lunch time!

"In heaven there is endless San Tung." -spoken by my boyfriend in between eating some dry fry chicken wings. I think the chicken wings are worth five stars alone. Some other nice dishes are the deep fried pork dumplings (or was it deep friend pork pot stickers?), the egg rolls, and the beef chow mein. We always seem to come when its packed when we have to put our name behind thirteen other parties. But I never found the wait too difficult. And the service is always good - the waiters aren't always super attentive, but what do you expect? But at the end of the day its all about the wings, man. The wings! The wings! THE WINGS!

Let me just say this up front: my parents love Chinese food and they grew up in Taiwan. My parents and I were in Golden Gate Park and I found this nearby restaurant on Yelp. ?4 stars, 1300+ reviews... must be good, right? ?We arrived around 6 PM and found a small waitlist (many surrounding restaurants were comparatively empty). ?Seemed like a good sign. We waited roughly 20 minutes to be seated in the cramped, no-room-to-move, people-constantly-brushing-by-you dining room. ?It was also really noisy (partly from the patrons and partly from the staff's speedy table cleanups). ?We ordered pig ears, fish, dan-dan noodles, and some potstickers. ?The food was just "okay" as far as authentic Chinese food goes--ripple-cut carrots and other such Americanized touches gave it away. ?The overall taste wasn't bad, but nothing really special either. If my review ended here, I would give the restaurant at least a 3/5 star rating. ?But the problem was the inconsistent (and mostly bad) service. ?Most of the staff we saw seemed either complacent or just rude (my Dad asked for more napkins, and the staff member whom he asked returned an "I don't care" look and ignored the request). ?Only one gentleman, who got us some boxes for leftovers, was friendly and showed that he cared about the customers. There's much better Chinese food in the South Bay (shopping centers like Cupertino Village and Milpitas Square, for starters). ?I'm sure there are other Chinese restaurants in San Francisco worth visiting, but we haven't found them yet.

Straight up one of my favorite restaurants in the city. I honestly get offended by people who don't think that it's amazing... Get outta here. It's ALWAYS crowded, but that just goes to show how much people are willing to wait for the food. I've been going to San Tung for years and I feel like they've been really consistent and have NEVER let me down. I get the same thing every time- Either Steamed Potstickers or Shrimp and Leek Dumplings, Sauteed String Beans, and then Diced Dry Fried Chicken (and rice.....). When I come back from school for a weekend, San Tung is always on my to-do list.. Even before seeing my family. It's really that serious.. Everything they serve is the best I've ever had (Drake) of that particular food.. Best chicken wings hands down, best string beans and no one comes close, best dumplings, and even their kimchee is unique and my favorite of all I've ever eaten. What I suggest: My Menu above. There are other delicious things on the menu for sure, but I stick to what I love. Bottom line: You'll have to wait to eat dinner here unless you go at an obscure hour, but it's worth it and it deserves the hype and praise. I'd low key go into depression if they ever closed down. Entrees will run you from about 7-12 dollars, which is pretty cheap. You can get outta there with dinner for 2 for about $25... and it'll be one of the most satisfying meals ever. I promise.

Five stars for the Dry Fried Chicken Wings. They are crack! Like most SF restaurants, no reservations. Standard sign-up list deal. Starting at 6pm, you'll recognize the restaurant by the swarm of people waiting outside! The black bean sauce noodles are also very good (they make all their dumplings and noodles from scratch). Tip: avoid the wait by eating during off hours (e.g., 2-5pm). Get the DRY fried chicken wings not the WET. The wings lose their crispiness and crunch b/c they are drowning in sauce.

I came here with a friend for what some are calling the greatest fried wings in the world. Don't get me wrong, the Original Dry Fried Chicken are very tasty, with a nice crispy outside and very tender delicious inside. The kind of chicken wing that you would give a nice hug, granted a very sticky hug, without the pats on the back to if you saw it walking down the street. I would definitely order it again, to-go. Our waiter never looked at either of us. He seemed more concerned about what was out the window then what we wanted. That bugs me a little. I used to be a waiter myself and if there is one thing people like, and tip generously for, is friendly and attentive service. I digress... Bottom line, good food but get it to-go.

Came here with 5 other people and we waited for about 45 minutes to get seated. This is my first time here and we ordered 7 dishes. I was really excited to come here especially after reading the reviews! Awesome Dishes : Dry-fried Chicken Wings, Pork Dumplings ? Good Dishes: ?Shrimp and Leek Dumplings, ?Dried Sauteed String Beans, Shrimp w/ walnuts. Okay Dishes: Black Bean Sauce Noodles, Chicken Fried rice They have good portion sizes, a little bit small for their noodles though. Their prices are reasonable and for a chinese restaurant, their service is not bad. One big turn off was the fact that my friend's tea cup had lipstick marks on it! But overall, really good chinese food in a cold windy hungry night. I'm definitely coming back for their chicken wings!

Is there even a point to writing if this place already has 2200+ reviews? Probably not, maybe this will just be for posterity. I had the best chicken wings of my life here. San Tung has been on my yelp bookmark for about 3 years now and I finally ended up here because the Pho restaurant next door was "on vacation". Thank God. The food was great, simple, incredibly flavorful and hearty. Only minuses were the wait and our server was really abrupt and brash with me. Maybe he was having an off day, or maybe it's cause I'm a little whitey and didn't know what was good to order. I'm coming back with a group, and soon.

Had dinner here by myself at Yelp's recommendation. ?Wow! Hot & sour soup. ?Solid. ?Not fancy or awe inspiring but the flavor and texture were (to this inexperienced palate) just right. ?The small order was enough to fill the little bowl six or seven times and the taste got better with each one. Homemade noodles with seafood sauce. ?We have a winner. ?Noodles were perfect on the tooth and the tongue -- even in Rome they don't know how to get a texture so right, a little spongy but supple. ?And the sauce, it was savory and perfectly balanced, a little starchier than most, which played off the noodle gluten, I cannot think of any spice or adjustment that would improve it. Dry fried chicken winks and drums with sauce. ?The standout. ?I won't even try to describe it, but last night for the first time I can remember I actually dreamed in taste. ?They should have a 24-hour fleet of trucks delivering this dish to every bar in town. ? I ate the whole order, with chopsticks, and got some funny looks for that but. . . . let's just say the inside of my body is an oil slick right now and I had used my fingers they would have had to scrub me down like an Exxon sea otter. Decor is simple pleasant but heavily worn and soiled. ?Crowd was 50% Asian, 20% white, 10% Hapa, and 20% ready to produce the next generation of Hapas. ?Service was prompt and efficient. ?Menu very long. ?The place filled up to a table by 5:30 on Tuesday night and based on the dry-erase sign-up board you can see there's often a wait.

Love the dry fried chicken wings. I seriously start salivating as you wait and watch every other table get their order of wings. They have this sweet and spicy glaze that is unbeatable and the wings themselves are always perfectly crispy despite being covered in the sauce. But in addition to the wings I have more suggestions (gasp!) because you can't only eat the wings. Although I suppose I have been tempted to simply have an order of wings to myself and nothing else. Their peanut noodles are a second favorite. It's a great peanut taste and well made noodles. Make sure you ask for a serving spoon because serving those long noodles with chopsticks can be an event. I would also highly recommend the dry fried fish. It's the same style as the chicken, but the fish is crisped to perfection on the outside and the inside is so soft it melts in your mouth. I also like their fried green beans (I think that's what I get haha). It's a good veggie option. The other things I've tried were mediocre and not really worth getting again including the cherry pork. A few suggestions for your visit: -Call ahead to put your name down on their list. I usually call as I'm on the way and ask to be put on the list. They take my name down and by the time I get there my name's almost next up on the list. Great way to avoid the inevitable wait. But on a side note, I have come here during dinner time and a few times on off hours and I've never really had an unbearable wait time. -Don't go there on a Wednesday. It took me a few times of driving over there to realize that they are closed on Wednesdays. -Ask for water early because although the waiters try to be nice, they are more concerned with being efficient with the crowd of patrons. -Enjoy! I always have a great time here because their food just tends to make you happy.

You seriously haven't lived until you've had their dry fried chicken. ?I'm not exactly sure why it is called dry fried, since it is drenched in this sweety, sticky goodness, but what's in a name? The wait is a biatch and sometimes my evil side wants to swipe my finger across the whiteboard, so the waiters see my name first, but in the end, it is all worth it. ?I'm a little sad that I only found out about this place a year ago, but I know about it now and I'm going to go here for as often as I can.

Avid fans of San Tung--and you are legion--please stop reading this review. Or if you continue, remember, three stars means "A-Ok." Now read that with an exclamation point or, better, three, "A-OK!!!" There, three stars for San Tung isn't so bad, is it? I have been to San Tung many times, and it's always a positive experience. My Inner Sunset friends have a fanatical devotion to the restaurant. Now, I will play the (okay, half) Chinese card here and point out that my Inner Sunset friends are Irish and Italian. But, not to be discriminatory, I am sure they are correct in their claims that the Dried Fried Beef and Chicken are the best around. It's just that, well, I'm not a fan of dried fried meats. So my review is really for the rest of the menu, which to me is more "A-OK" than A-wesome. The wait can also be annoying, but, I guess it is indicative of the lively dining experience you'll have there. So, take a big group of dried fried meat lovers and enjoy.

Being of San Tung descent, I really do appreciate a restaurant that serves cuisine from my grandparents' home-region. I've never had dumplings from San Tung China, but i have had them from my grandmothers and let me say the dumplings here are definitely comparable. I've tried a lot of dishes here but the standouts for me are: -Shimp & leek dumplings -Dry fried chicken wings -Dry Ja-jang (black bean sauce) noodles The dumplings are so yummy. They remind me of the stuff my mom and grandmoms can make. The chicken wings are really delicious, but the sauce is just a teensy bit too sweet sometimes. The ja-jang noodles are pretty good, but i've had better in Korea and from my Chinese from Korea parents. I was suprised at how attentive the service is for a place that's so busy. I asked for more kimchi and ice water and the server never forgot! I was also trying to ration the ice water, but i didn't really need to because it was refilled 2x without me even having to ask! Awesome possum! :D Expect a wait here at any given time. I've been here a handful of times and I've always seen people waiting (even if it's as early as 5pm!). Good news is that they take reservations for parties of 8 or more.

This place was OK. It was full, which was a surprise because we went on a Monday *and* Halloween. Service, although not super friendly, was prompt. We ordered the leek and shrimp dumplings and they were quite good, even if they were a bit light on the shrimp. The rest of the food/experience was a bit mediocre. I ordered the cherry pork. The portion was *huge* and there was a lot of flavor...just not the ginger or cherry I was expecting. It was more like sweet tomato.... My bf got a cold noodle dish with peanut sauce. The meet was pretty chewy and of relatively low quality. The food was also really cold. I know this may seem like a weird comment, but "cold noodle" in our experience usually means slightly chilled with warm meat while this meal was all cold...even the sauce, which made it a bit jelly like... Overall, we wouldn't come back, but considering how high the rest of the reviews are, I'd say give it a try.

This place came from a local's recommendation and he did not disappoint. My friend and I ordered the dry chicken, potstickers, and peanut handmade noodles. The dry chicken was like crack and came with a sweet sauce and red chili peppers. The potstickers were huge, but the one thing I was hoping for was a potsticker dipping sauce. ? Lastly, the peanut noodle dish was a little overwhelming with the consistency of the sauce. ?It was more paste-like than anything else and I guess I was comparing it to the Seven Star in Seattle, which is out of this world. ?Overall if I lived in the neighborhood I would be here on a regular basis and would definitely recommend it to anyone going to SF.

If you're lucky and you come here early or late enough during the day, you will not have to wait for an hour for a table. ? During the weekday, you can make it on time for their great lunch specials which come with their soup of the day and a smaller portion of their famous dishes. ? You have to get the chicken wings. ?You can either get them in diced (if your'e too lazy to eat off the wings) or like the crispy part better or the wings if you want more flavor. The dumplings are great as well and their noodle dishes. ?I like the 5 Spicy Noodle which is really spicy with seafood, cucumber, and other vegetables that you stir like a lo-mein. ?The black bean noodle is great as well. Must try if you're in sf!

There's only one reason I would come here to wait 30 or more minutes out in the fog: dry fried chicken wings. It tastes just like my mama's caramelized chicken wings (my last meal on earth), so I come here whenever craving a taste of homecooking. The dumplings are not too bad, though not the best I've had either. Noodle dishes are pretty freaking big. I usually have enough noodles for a leftover meal. But I can't say the same about the dry fried chicken wings.

This place is SOOOO good. I'm glad our friends brought us here last night. It is interesting since it is a Chinese/Korean place, who would have thunk it? We were seated really quicky. No lines at all. However my friend told us that if we came during peak dinner hour, we'd have to wait sometimes 30min-1hour (we went around 9pm). We had them order because they always know what they're doing and they always know the best places to go to. Our order in no particular order... 1. Chicken Wings 2. Dumplings 3. Peanut Butter Noodles 4. Eggplant 5. Sweet & Sour Pork 6. Kim Chee appetizer (free with meal) 7. Soup (forgot what) The best were the Chicken Wings, Peanut Butter Noodles and Sweet & Sour Pork. I'm excited to come back and order some other stuff...the Chicken Wings are enough to keep me coming back though...mmmmmmmmmmmmm!!! My fiance loves to mess with people. Its really interesting to see the worker's reactions. Sometimes they get really annoyed but sometimes they're really good sports. Almost every waiter joked back with him. ?Really cool people indeed. We'll be back!!!

dear san tung, I have a confession to make. I only like you for your dry fry chicken wings. I am sorry. You know it's not you, it's me. All your other dishes are tasty, the prices are great, I've enjoyed every meal I've had there... but those dry fry chicken.. I miss it. I know you are more than that. Your other noodle dish was good, always love garlic eggplants, love anything with egg in it, that's why I give you 5 stars... but I am just being real with you. I am not fond of the horrible parking, the crowded wait, and how your space should be at least three times bigger to accommodate the crowds.. but all is forgiven as long as you dish me some chicken. I'll see you soon my chicken.. i mean san tung

My favorite Korean-Chinese or Chinese-Korean place in SF. ?..it just means that they serve a lot of the chinese dishes that Koreans love. ?Like jjajang nyun (black bean sauce noodles) chinese style. ?...which means their sauce is lighter and their meat chunks are large enough to be recognized. ? Of course you have to order their dry fried chicken. I prefer the diced since it's boneless but it tends to be sweeter since there's more flour & sauce per square mm than the bone-in. ? Love their chinese style kimchi, which means that they use regular cabbage instead of napa. ?It makes for a sweeter and crunchier type. ?If you're one to pick off the stem rather than the leaf of the napa type kimchi, then you would love this one. Been coming here for over ten years now. ?Some of their other great dishes are: jjampong - spicy seafood noodle soup. ? steamed leek dumplings string beans But in fact, I don't recall ever having a bad dish here. ? The wait is awfully long on the weekends tho. ?But once seated the service is fast.

The last thing this place needs is another good review because frankly, they don't need any more customers! The waitlist was at least 10 parties deep the entire time we were there, and people waited patiently and not so patiently inside and outside the doors. I hate waiting, but I absolutely had to try this place based on the reviews and because it is Chinese-Korean cuisine! We ordered the san tung myun, dry fried chicken, liang zhang pei and pork dumplings. This was for just two people - we only managed to finish off half the dumplings and the liang zhang pei (yang jang pee in Korean) at the restaurant and took the rest of it home. I'm pretty sure they handcut their noodles here, which is the first thing to look for in a Chinese-Korean restaurant because good jjajang myun and jjambbong must be made with fresh handcut noodles. I was intrigued by their other noodle dishes, which I've never seen on any other menu. The san tung myun is like jjambbong, but with a thick spicy gravy instead of a hot liquidy soup. The yang jang pee was just ok - most versions I've tried previously use a hot mustard sauce (and San Tung's menu says it is made with hot mustard sauce) but the version we were served seemed to be sweet soy sauce instead. Yang jang pee is a delicious shared appetizer plate that comes with shrimp, squid, glass bean noodles, jellyfish, cucumbers, carrots, onions, stir-fried pork and vegetables and mustard sauce. Your waiter usually mixes it all up for you, although at San Tung they left us to do it ourselves. If you want excellent yang jang pee, visit Tsing Tao on Solano Avenue in Albany. The pork dumplings were yummy and filling with hand-made thick and chewy dough. But the piece de resistance is, of course, the dry fried chicken, which Koreans call ggampoong-gi. San Tung's version tastes JUST LIKE the twice-fried soy sauce chicken my grandmother made for my family while I was growing up. Finger licking, lip smacking delicious.

The shrimp and chive dumplings weren't that good today. ?No crunchiness in the shrimp. ?String beans were undercooked. Tomato Egg flower soup was delicious, and so was the beef soup noodles....too bad it's Thursday...and I can't eat meat. ?=( Used a gift cert I won at a fundraiser. ?Kudos to this establishment for supporting the Chinese earthquake relief efforts!

In the mood for some great Chinese food? ?Look no further. ?San Tung is the place! ?Their fried chicken and dumplings are to die for! I'm usually there for a weekend lunch when the tummy needs a pick-me-up. ?I order the same four dishes every time since they are so dee-lish: Original Dry Fried Chicken (Dry) (Diced or Wings) - A must have! Tender and moist chicken covered with a crispy, light batter and drizzled with a thick, tangy sauce of garlic, ginger and roasted red peppers. ?The batter is just right and the sauce is OH SO GOOD! ?For those who don't want the sticky fingers can opt for the diced pieces . . . just as tasty! Shrimp and Leek Dumplings - Another winner! ?Twelve good-sized dumplings stuffed with a generous portion of ginger, garlic infused ground shrimp and Chinese chives. ?The filling is moist and juicy and the dough covering is steamed just perfectly to a slight chewy consistency. ?Dipped in the vinegar and chili oil sauce and I'M IN HEAVEN! ?My favorite! Pork Dumplings - Similar to the shrimp and leek ones except filled with a blend of moist ground pork, Napa cabbage, fresh ginger and garlic. ?Very good! Dried Sauteed String Beans - Fresh green beans wok fried in a delicious garlic sauce with Chinese pickles. ?The green beans are tossed perfectly in the wok as to maintain the slightly crunchy texture. ?A great vegetable choice! The prices are reasonable, with most dishes under $10, and the service is rather quick. ?The waiters are efficient. ?Being located in the Inner Sunset, the parking at times can be a challenge. ?Unfortunately, they don't take reservations. ?Being that they're so popular it does get crowded and the wait can be rather long, but it's well worth it! ?Arriving shortly after they open for lunch or an early dinner helps in getting a table right away. ?Enjoy!

Went to San Tung for lunch on a Friday afternoon. I got the deep fried chicken wings, dry and the pork chive dumplings, plus rice. ? -Food was delicious, chicken wings were not overhyped. They were amazing! Sauce was not too spicy. Dumplings were just like homemade. -Relatively cheap. Total bill came to $25, tax and tip included. I was full and so was my tubby girlfriend. Although I'm kinda upset they charged for streamed rice. What's up with that?? -Restaurant was pretty busy. Be prepared to wait 15-20 minutes. I had to share a table with two other parties. But didn't bother either of us. -Parking is metered. Bring change. -Service was decent for a chinese restaurant. They were efficient and spoke decent engrish. I'd recommend it and I'd personally eat there again.

Yuuuuuuuummmmmmmmmmmmmm! Heard all the hype about the dry fried chicken!!!! Serious some bomb chicken wings ya'll! They have two kinds... dry ( which means its slightly glazed with a honey soy glaze) and wet ( which means drowning in thick sauce). The place was crackin'. The place itself was very small so we ended up having to share our table with two strangers.We ordered the steamed potstickers, dry black bean sauce noodles, and dry fried chicken wings. Potstickers- can tell these were home made, even the skin, because it was kinda ugly. Good but could live without ordering it again Black bean noodles- noodles were fresh hand-pulled noodles... fantastic texture (slightly chewy). The sauce was pretty good but would be better if it wasnt so daym salty. The dish alone was quite fishy since they put alot of seafood in it but the zuchinni was some how really bitter. Dry fried chicken-BEST FRIED KOREAN CHICKEN. Did i mention this place is korean/chinese owned??? seriously good chicken. Super juicy, crispy with a thin honey soy glaze. I was sooo obsessed with this chicken i just use the left over bones to pickup the left over glaze on the plate to suck on! I will only go back for the chicken.... other items are easy to live withtout

I know there's a buttload of reviews for this place so I'll just give you the highlights in an easy-to-read view: Yes, the hype is real. Yes, the fried chicken wings are a MUST. Yes, there's always GD 45+ min wait at peak times. Yes, they use a lot of starch (finger lickin' good). Yes, I'm getting hungry typing this review. And you should: Try the shrimp and leek dumplings. Try the black bean noodles. Try the fried flounder fish filet (and try not to think of the Little Mermaid when you're eating her friend). Try getting a reservation if your party is 5-8 ppl.

Best chicken wings I have ever had!! I definitely will be coming back to have more of it! The restaurant is clean, decently sized and was completely packed. We came here on a weekend for lunch and the wait was about 10-15 minutes. Their specialty is the dry fried chicken wings. The texture of the skin is so crispy, even though it's been mixed with their delicious savory candied sauce. I think it's coated in a sweet honey garlic sauce. I can eat a whole plate of it on my own, it's that tasty! The waiter also recommended: Black bean sauce noodles- When I saw the dish come out, I was worried it was going to be way too saucy, salty and overpowering. To my surprise, it wasn't over powering at all. The sauce may look thick and rich ?but the flavors are actually subtle. There was a mix of tender beef, shrimp and squid in the mix. The enough meat/seafood to noodle ratio wasn't great. I found myself eating a lot of plain noodles. Pot stickers- ?Ginormous but too soggy and on the bland side. I prefer my pot stickers crispy. If you come here, the dry fried chicken wing is a MUST.

I usually go to San Tung with 10 other people and order a plethora of food. Here's an example of things usually ordered: potstickers, shrimp & leek dumplings, green beans, dry friend chicken wings, dry fried fish. ?If I'm with a full table then we order 2x everything and 6x chicken wings, my friends are kind of crazy like that. Definitely order the chicken wings (dry) and the dumplings. ?I tried some of the soup noodles and they are also tasty. The wait can be long, even with a reservation.

Ok, I think this is the first five star I have given. ? Having had wings as traditional chains, the Anchor bar in Buffalo along with my partner's fantastic version I was not expecting that much. ?But as others have said WOW. ?I feel bad for their other food because I honestly do not know why you would order aything else. We all had the wings and the are The Best. ?If you get the chance go here. Service was friendly and prompt and we got there early enough we did not have to wait in line. Awesome.

Dont bother calling in to ask if they could put your name down on the usually mile long list. The lady won't, not because they dont do that but because she's simply too busy. Then she'll hang up on you while you're talking. (You're like your chicken wings are so freaking good, beez) Like the food, service here is either really good or really not. There were five or so waiters walking around but it still took minutes to flag one down to take our order. I asked him what the other table got and he responded "noodles with peanut sauce" with a big duh, dumbass look on his face. Ok, sorry I guess, they just looked so damn good that I wanted to know, sheesh. But don't let this guy mislead you because the other waiter who brought our food was the polar opposite. He was so nice and friendly - are we in the same restaurant? Chicken wings are amazzzzing. Dry so much better than wet even though they're equally saucy. Really, they're both semi-wet! "Dry" though is spicier and savory while "wet" is a bit sweet. Also ordered chow mein and walnut prawns. These fell flat next to the wings. Chow mien and walnut prawns were really mediocre, if not not as good as other places. Lesson learned: I will come back for chicken wings but only for take out.

"Family's in town? They're going to SF for the day?" Alright, give them order for San Tung to bring back. All I wanted was the dry friend chicken wings, one box for me, one box for them. They came back with three boxes. One box had 14pcs, luckily the one I opened. There was one with 10pcs. Third box had 12pcs. Hmm... not much sauce in the togo. Wings seems smaller. Oh well, still good.

Get seated and attack the Chinese style kimchi 5. Order dry fried chicken wings, string beans and shrimp/pork dumplings 6.

So I should preface this review with the fact that I've never actually eaten on the San Tung's premise, I've only ever gotten take out. ?That said, it's some of THE BEST Chinese take out available in the city. ?As for never eating in here, it's always got a line running several deep through the door and I'm not much of a waiter when it comes to being surrounded by the smell of awesome Chinese. ?Also if you order take out it never takes more than 15-20 minutes, so I'll walk three blocks then eat this amazing food right in the comfort of my own home. ?Now for the nitty-gritty menu items. ?The Original Dry Rub Chicken is what it's all about here, it come two ways; pieces and wings, both are outstanding. ?They do really good dumplings all day and night. ?In fact I've yet to try something here I don't like.

He asked . What you want? ?He was so nude, anyway! We ordered their FAMOUS CHICKEN WING. the cold noodle and the CHA JIANG MEN. The chicken wing( not thing special, tasted like general tso's chicken wing) The CHA JIANG MEN was the worse I'd ever had. it's was so sweet. This is not traditional Chinese Food at all.

Pretty much the best Chinese I've had in the Bay Area, and comparable to the best place I've had in NY. The line moved very quickly, so I wouldn't be too worried about the wait. ?Parking is availabile within a couple of blocks, but you may have to search for a while. The place was small but had lots of tables, and plenty of staff. ?There's also a neat private room in the back, which I assume is only by reservation. ? We had wonton soup, steamed dumplings, dry chicken wings (which are not that dry, but very tasty) and chicken with string beans, which had a very garlicky sauce. ?A side of rice and some tea, and I think we just barely broke $40 with tip. The chicken wings alone are worth a visit!

Yummie Yummie food as always. We arrived at 5:30pm for dinner without having to wait. 15 minutes later, there was a wait of five tables! Crazy how 15 minutes makes all the difference. Service is outstanding here. They are so fast on their feet. Always moving, always serving water, always picking up one empty plate and replacing with another dish. We ordered two plates of the dry fried chicken, a plate of cold beef, eggplant, sweet and sour pork, and steamed potstickers. My favorites were the cold beef and the dry fried chicken. Parking in this area is very difficult so make sure to plan ahead. I dont think the recession has affected this restaurant much, but I did notice that there was less sauce on the dry fried chicken than when I came here three years ago.

Enough with the dry fried chicken wings already! Yes, they're delicious and possibly one of the best chicken wings ever and yes, I've probably eaten enough of them myself to have altered my DNA to part chicken. But do we really need another picture of them? There's like 20+ on the site already and I think we've seen them at every angle. Sigh... but I guess what I really want to know is... what do the WET ones taste like!? (No. 75 on the menu) I don't have the cajones to order them myself because I don't want to forego the deliciousness of the dry ones. I'm sure there are many people like me who share the same sentiment, hence the lack of any proof of their existence. Who is going to be brave enough to go into the unsurveyed frontier and live to Yelp! about it?

I don't really understand why this place has so much hype. The food reminds me of white-washed Chinese food. Or maybe I've just been super spoiled with all the delicious authentic Chinese food available in LA. I came upon this place when I was visiting my friend in SF. She was raving about this place having the best chicken wings. We went super early, around 5:30, for dinner to avoid the rush. Good thing we did because once we sat down, the place quickly filled up. The DRY FRIED CHICKEN WINGS were ok. Its not really dry, there's actually a lot of sauce used in cooking it. The flavors reminded me of orange chicken from panda express, which is one of my favorite panda express choices. The chicken wings were definitely juciy, but I don't see really understand the hype about it. We also ordered the COLD NOODLES, which had bean curd and shrimp mixed with peanut sauce. Its ok, nothing spectacular to write home about. We also ordered the DUMPLINGS. They were ok, again, nothing amazing to write home about. I'm glad that I live in LA where there is so much delicious Chinese food. But I guess since there's a lack of such places in SF, this place would have to do when you have those cravings for Chinese food.

It was my first time in Inner Sunset...I dont know if I can live in SF...but I just found out it is close to UCSF, which is one of my dream dental schools! SO..I will deal with it! Anyways, ordered the string beans! A bit oily, but greatly flavored! Had some crisp to it! Also tried the black bean sauce noodles..and it was okay, Ive had better. I was totally stoked to have this..but was disappointed that it wasnt up to par. I always have very high expectations for this dish..I dont know why. We didnt eat much of it. Also had their infamous chicken wings..and OMG...full of flavor, very fried..so yummy!!!!!!!!! It made me feel very unhealthy though! hahaha! The bill came out to 30 freaking dollars for 2 people!!!!!!!!!!!! So so so so so ridiculously overpriced. The decor wasnt pretty and neither was the service!

Four words... "DRY FRIED CHICKEN WINGS" Wow this place is just so good. Everyone knows that this place has the best wings in town. I love chicken wings and when I want a great sweet and spicy fix I come here. The wait can be long, but it is well worth it. Prices here range around the $10 realm, somewhat a high price to pay, but in the end when you're full it's well worth it all. Prices seem to creep up every now and then, but I hope despite the good business that prices don't get too high for me to enjoy a great meal. I've been coming here for a long time and I've tried so many dishes. I think a staple here is not rice, it's the dried fried chicken wings that come out crispy sticky yummy and delicious. The service here is awesome and people take orders out togo all the time. Come here and eat family style and get a little bit of everything. Sit back and relax and enjoy a great meal, but don't relax too much, I'd want you to get out of your seat so that I can get seated next hehe.

After eating here twice I was surprised to see such mixed reviews on yelp. Personally, I was very impressed by San Tung. But looking back I think you really have to know what to order. My friend was telling me this resturant is supposed to represent food from a very specific provice in China which is famous for their noodles. I brelieve it because the noodles were my favorite, had both the black bean seafood and the spicy seafood. The noodles themselves were very chewy, neither doughy nor tough. The sauce complimented them really well and there was plenty of seafood. This place is also known for their chicken wings, served "dry" (which is a sticky honey sauce" or "wet" which is just more suacy and less sticky. Both are finger likin' good and a must for every visit. The third acclaimed dish is the dumplings, which i notice a lot of mixed reviews on. But I like the simplicity of their dumpings, small and steamed. Make sure you mix yourself some dipping sauce with soy sauce, vinigar, and chilli oil. These three things: noodles, chicken, dumplings are a recipe for success when eating at San Tung, and good enough reason for a visit. Most other dishes will be ordinary so be cautious. I didn't have any problems with the waiters. Like most Chinese resturants I expect the waiters to be brisk, that's standard. Lastly, expect to wait a long time for a seat. This place is popular!

San Tung is the TRUTH. I often think about the dry fried chicken and the shrimp dumplings. I could pretty much eat them all day long. There must be some kind of crack or magic in this food! When I was in SF last year, I had San Tung twice in one week just for those delicious wings. It's crazy how they're so good. Tips: You might want to order an extra plate of wings.

Ended up here on a whim after a night spent at Nightlife at the California Academy of Sciences in GG Park. ?While this would not have been my first choice, it was definitely filling and moderately priced. ?It is not super cheap, but not super expensive. ? Some 2 word catch phrases: -Quick service -Tasty food -People watching -Plentiful food -Family style What they are known for: Dry Fried Chicken Wings We didn't order the black bean noodles, but we did partake of the chicken wings, which were fried and glazed in a honey sauce. ?They were tasty, but a bit too sweet and sticky for me. ?They required a thorough hand-washing after eating. ?I did take them home to my boyfriend, who really liked them the day after!!! My favorite was the: dry fried shrimp and the chicken and beans. Service was efficient and there was not a LONG line when we arrived there - around 9 on Thursday night.

There was a bit of a wait, and high irritability was imminent. ?San Tung looked like a typical Chinese restaurant, and I thought I was going to get an average meal...To be honest, it was after a long day and what I was looking forward to was a nice cool frosty beer. ? I got that and more than I could have imagined. ?I came with a group of friends (one was a San Tung pro, and ordered for the whole table). ? -Chicken Wings -Dumplings -Green beans -Black Bean Sauce Noodles (flavorful & not bland at all ) -BEER (Surprisingly they had a decent variety of imported beers) The only negative was the seating. ?The chairs were all close...if you're not being bumped by other customers, you're crammed into a corner. ?*Sigh*...what we'll endure for good food.

What can you say about San Tung's wings other than AWESOME. ?Sweet and crispy and finger-lickin good sauce on these bad boys. ?Perfect amount of spice too. ?The ja jang myun noodles are also a really good, as well as the fried calamari! ?Get the calamari and you won't be dissapointed. ? I came with a decently large sized group, around 8 of us, and there were only 2 large tables in the restaurant! ?I recommend getting here early if you're in a large group, as there isnt a lot of large tables inside.

So everyone keeps talking about the FAMOUS fried chicken here. I can definitely see why it's attracted so many people. If you look around the restaurant you'll see a very mixed crowd. The chicken is like Korean inspired Chinese fried chicken. The sauce is a little sweet, a little salty, and just a tad spicy. Very good. I don't know about some of the over-exaggerated comments people write about their chicken...but it's pretty good in my book. The menu is large and you definitely don't have to worry about lack of selection here. Another item that stands out here is the sizzling rice soup. It seems so plain and simple but the broth was very good. After having the sizzling rice soup here, I've been having cravings to order it again. Expect a wait time here. They have a dry erase board for you to write your name and number of people in your party. If you have a small group and a large table opens up, they'll ask you if you mind sitting with strangers.

Love this place and been going since high school. The chicken wings are probably the best "asian inspired" chicken wings i've had at a chinese restaurant. I recommend getting them diced instead of as chicken wings to make it easier (and quicker) to eat. Getting them dry is kind of deceiving because they do have a good amount of sauce on them. Perfect to eat with rice. Getting them wet just ruins the crispyness thats so good. Calamari here is also served the same way. Green beans and chicken is all i need here. Parking in the area REALLY sucks especially on weekend dinnertimes. Just call in an order to save yourself the hassle. They do have big round tables for big groups if you really want to sit there. Also, make sure to watch your name on the list on the board as some people are known to erase names so they will get seated before you.

I came by on Sunday for a late lunch during Labor Day weekend and this place was PACKED with a line stretching out the door. Even though it was just the two of us getting lunch at an off hour, we still had to wait at least 30 minutes to be seated. Generally such a hunger procession indicates either a delicious or hyped-up destination. Unfortunately, in this case, I think its mostly hype. We had pork dumplings, shrimp pot-stickers, cold sliced beef, honey fried chicken wings and sautéed string beans. Aside from the wings, none of it was really that good. The dumplings were rather ordinary and the pot-stickers unusually thick-skinned. The cold sliced beef was also unusually dry and lacking in flavor - I expected it to be sliced much thinner, soaked in that vinegary sauce, and spicy. The strings beans also lacked a certain crispiness that left it feeling limp and impotent. The food was not necessarily bad, but it was only okay and certainly not worth the wait. I doubt I would come back here unless I could somehow skip the welcoming parade.

Awful! ?It was a cold night and had a craving for some San Tung style dumplings. ?My ancestors are from San Tung and my family makes the best dumplings in the world, so I know how good dumplings should taste like; there should be a bite to the skin and the meat inside should be delicately seasoned with a nice crunch from the combination of pork and shrimp. ?San Tung's dumplings were soggy, wet, and filled with mushy, salty filling..ugh! ?Additionally, dumplings are not served with white vinegar, but with Chikiang black vinegar come on San Tung! We ordered a couple of other dishes to round out our meal - snow pea with mushrooms and lobster sauce shrimp. ?First, everything was greasy, greasy, greasy..yuck! ?Second, the lobster sauce shrimp was nothing like the traditional lobster sauce shrimp made with egg whites, crunchy shrimp, pork and black beans. ?What arrived at our table was a plate of small, mushy shrimp with an overpowering taste of baking soda (to mask the flavour of bad shrimp?) soaked in a cornstarchy based sauce. ?It had no flavour, no colour - it was absolutely disgusting. ? On our way out, I was so disgusted by the meal that I had just consumed that I wanted to stick a finger down my throat and vomit it out. ?San Tung - never again!!!!

Everyone thinks the dry fried chicken wings here are the best thing at San Tung. its not. The DRY FRIED FISH is zee absolute best. ? It is truly well done and completely delicious. (Dry fried calamari/squid not so good & the dry fried beef not so good. We tried to get them to make a dry fried tofu for my vegetarian friend once---they didnt want to do it, and after some begging they did...... and it was not so good. ? If you're a vegetarian-- the string beans are great, they'll give you a close taste to all the meaty goodness you're missing out on.)

Probably the best Chinese food I have ever had. ?Honestly. We had a little bit of a walk to get here, but completely worth it. ?There was a small line at the door when we go there - they were still cleaning off tables. ?So we had to put our name on the wait list - a dry erase board hung on the wall next to the door - and they called our name shortly. ?Not the most "smiley" of servers, but efficient. We ordered a TON of food too - all for $55 for 3 people - and there was good value for money. ?And ALL of it was fantastic. ? We started with the large wonton soup. ?You could go for a swim in the bowl, it was really tasty. ?And I really recommend the potstickers. ?They are the biggest potstickers I have ever seen and the filling is very flavorful. For the main course we had the mongolian beef, pork and peppers (spicy!), shrimp with lobster sauce and chicken fried rice. ?All of it was fantastic. ?My friend - who doesn't normally like fried rice - couldn't get enough of it! ?As I write, I am making myself hungry. ?Can't wait until we are in town again so we can go back!

Tips for the San Tung newbie: 1. ?Don't wear your favorite super cute heels that make your legs look like Heidi Klum's but pinch your toes just a little because you'll regret it when you've been standing outside the restaurant for an hour waiting to be seated and your feet hurt so much that you're wishing your friends would just go ahead and amputate them right there on the sidewalk. ?Yes, the wait can be that long. ? 2. ?Send a scout into the restaurant every few minutes to check that your name is still on the dry erase board. ?Gotta make sure a wily old Chinese woman doesn't erase your name or write hers in on top of yours. ?Do not make the mistake of thinking the staff is keeping track. ?They're not. 3. ?When you finally get seated, order the fried chicken wings. ?Get them wet or dry, I don't care. ?Just get them. ?You can thank me later. ?Preferably with a plate of fried chicken wings.

Ahh, San Tung. ?How you tempt me with your crack chicken. ?I can't go there without getting the dry fried chicken (diced), potstickers and seaweed soup. The kimchi they throw on the table at the beginning of the meal makes no sense for a chinese restaurant and is crazy spicy, but I'm often starving after waiting in line and set my mouth on fire each time. ?Beyond that, it's impossible to not eat a ton of really tasty food. ?Just make sure you get some big scoops of that chicken on your plate before it's gone.

So we're the fifth name on the dry erase board, and it's a pretty long wait. ?I'm spotting out different dishes I want to try out on people's tables. ?The food looks awesome, and after a while, it almost looks like there's more people waiting for tables than there are eating. ?Definitely a good sign. I notice the kids eating in front of us. ?They look like little thugs. ?One has a goatee. ?Another doesn't know how to use chopsticks. ?As they pay the bill, they leave behind a little more than a dollar in change for tip. ?The waitress is stunned. ?The head waiter comes out and tells them to keep their change--they don't want it. By the time we get seated, we're starving. ?We order sizzling rice soup, vegetable dumplings, pork dumplings, mixed noodles with black bean sauce, and of course, an order of the infamous chicken wings. San Tung cuisine is interesting, it's almost a Chinese Korean fusion. ?The only other place I've tried that was similar is Shanghai Mong in KTown New York. ?Their noodles with black bean sauce was better than San Tung. ?Here, it's pretty good, but nothing to write home about. ?The vegetable dumplings, on the other hand, are killer, and if I could, I'd give the chicken wings 6 stars they're that awesome. For all that food we ate, I'm still not sure if it was worth the wait, however, I can definitely see San Tung as a great take out option. ?And we did leave behind a pretty big tip. ?Maybe that'll restore some peace in the world.

The dried fried chicken is AMAZING, I'd recommend always getting it on the bone instead of boneless cause that way there is more of the delicious flavor in the meat. Unfortunately, there is always almost a long wait.. but the food is worth it. The pork dumplings are really good too. The only thing I dislike sometimes is that you have to sit with other people at the table.. it's really awkward and you don't feel comfortable eating in front of complete strangers!

Came here with my bro, his gf and my gf and really enjoyed this place. ?The place was packed and we waited for over 30 min but it was well worth it. The kimchee they serve to you in the beginning is flaming hot - becareful. Since the 4 of us were starving we ordered too much food (as always the case @ Chinese restaurants). ?It included: 2 orders for wet chicken wings - It's their house special, MUST TRY Eggplant Stir Fry Hot&Sour Soup Moo Shu Pork Shrimp Shumai The chicken wings were sweet, a bit spicy, and full of flavor and meet. ?Your hands will get sticky so get ready to dig in and get dirty. The Hot &Sour soup, although generic, was delicious. Moo Shu Pork was excellent - it's not hard to satisfy me with this one. Shrimp Shumai could've been better. ?The flavor was a little flat and dry. Eggplant was good. I was a bit baffled why a Chinese restaurant would serve kimchee and chicken wings, but I later found out this restaurant is Northern China cuisine. ?Since geographically it's near Korea, it has a Korean influence which answers my questions. One other thing is they were so busy on a Fri night but took last order at around 9:15pm, and by around 930 the waiters started to get ready for closing. ?I'm surprised they aren't open later, I would think they'd get more business. But the service was quick and attentive throughout the night, and the atmosphere is lively. ?The best part was the bill was a total of $70. ?I highly recommend!

Hey I'm Chinese, so naturally on my reunion/wedding/family visit to San Fran, dinner plans were set for Chinese food family style. "Meet at 1031 Irving St at 5:30PM" Wow, kind of early, but whatev. After finally finding some parking, we made our way to 1031 Irving. The closer we got I started to notice this big crowd hanging out outside some place. I thought to myself "wow, I wonder what's going on there? maybe people are waiting around to buy tickets to something?" I soon realize.."oh, that's the line to eat at the restaurant we're eating at" I didn't even know the name of the darn place. I just knew I was about to be in for a treat..and boy was I ever! The place was packed, I later find out this was the norm and so was the crowd outside. Thank goodness for reservations for parties over 6. ?The waitstaff was typical. They didn't need to be nice or shoot the shit with us. They just cared about one thing...order and pay. Normally I would care about service, but with the high demands the restaurant was catering to I didn't really care. Waiter: "OK, Order now please." My Cousin (MC): "We'll have the steamed pork potstickers" Waiter: "Yes." MC: "Mu Shu Chicken" Waiter (not even looking at MC): "How many?" MC: "One order" Waiter (still staring off towards the door like he has more important things to pay attention to): "NO, how many people?" MC: "Oh 7.." (counts heads) "wait, no 8 people" Waiter (annoyed): Yes. MC: "and the Dried Fried Chicken, garlic eggplant, 5 spice beef soup noodles." Waiter: "Yes, what else." MC: " and the cherry pork" Waiter: "Yes. Drink Please." MC: "just water" The whole time I am amazed at how little eye contact there is with said waiter to my cousin OR the notepad he is scribbling on. He quickly scurries off and my cousin explains that he doesn't need to be nice since the place is like food of the Asian Gods. Not 7 minutes later, food starts to fill our table. OMFG, the dried fried chicken was awesome. The mu shu chicken was equally kick ass. EVERYTHING was so GOOD. I don't know if hanging out earlier that day in the Golden Gate Park on Hippie Hill near all those bongo drum people and smelling their fumes influenced me, but I for sure brought a good appetite to San Tung. It's not an everyday thing where I get good Chinese all the time. Sorry Austin, I love you, but sometimes good ol' Chinese is hard to find in the heart of Texas. So I ate and ate...and even when I was a little full, I still managed to eat some more. I couldn't let the visit go to waste. Excellent food, waitstaff was eh, but they were quick and efficient. On the way home, I totally had to unbutton my pants one button. It was well worth it though.

Definitely one of the best places to get Chinese food in San Francisco! If you love sweet, spicy and crispy- just like me you'll love the items they serve. Be wary, this place gets packed during dinner time even on weekdays! My friends and I got a reservation down for 8 people, seated at a nice big round table. The place is bustling with people and dishes are fly out of the kitchen with perfect timing. We ordered the Hot N Sour Soup, Sauteed String Beans, Shrimp and Leek Dumplings, Mongolian Beef, Sweet and Sour Flounder, Dried Fried Chicken & Dried Fried Chicken Cuts. EVERYTHING was delicious! The Hot N Sour soup was just that. It was hot, spicy and contained a lot of tofu and egg which was nice. The Sauteed String Beans came with delicious sauce and was cooked perfectly. Shimp and Leek Dumplings are for those Ha Cao lovers, very similar to Dim Sum and tastes great in the Red Chili Oil and Soysauce used for dipping. The Mongolian beef was probably the only thing I was not swayed by, it was like at any other place. The Sweet and Sour Flounder, Dried Fried Chicken and the cuts of the Dried Fried Chicken are smothered by this amazing sauce that is sweet and spicy. Not forgetting to mention the three previously stated are cooked to a thick crisp that is addicting to say the least. With all these orders and two bowls of steamed rice, we left no remains on the table, chugged through 2 pots of tea and left happy. Definitely try the Dry Fried Chicken Wings or cuts, or flounder if you like fish cake. Amazing!

Whoever would have thought the Chinese could put out such delicious chicken wings! I came here with a group of friends after Bay to Breakers and easily demolished two plates of those delicious sweet yet savory chicken wings, on top of that, an order of shrimp and leek dumplings, tomato beef handpulled noodles, and spicy shrimp. It was all winner, except the spicy shrimp. That tasted like it could've came from any basic Chinese restaurant, and it wasn't even spicy. These chicken wings are out of this world though. It's messy to eat them, so make sure you have plenty of napkins. There's really no elegant way to go about it other than just gobbling it all up like no ones watching. Besides, you're in a Chinese restaurant, not Chez Panisse, so anything goes! Service isn't amazing, but what do you expect? It's a Chinese restaurant. So can't fault them there. Easily the BEST Chinese restaurant in the city. Hands. Down.

I've loved them since I was a child. I remember going to this restaurant (the original one on Irving & 23rd Ave) on the weekends with my mom and gobbling up the dumplings and slurping up the noodles and sweating like crazy because of the spiciness. ?So many years have past, and they're still as great as my memory has them. Food: MUST GETS: Steamed dumplings - either shrimp with leek or pork & veggies. ?They're really fresh, really smooth dough without being thick/doughy, juicy inside, and always freshly steamed (boiling makes it bland). ?Been to many other restaurants and they never compare to San Tung's in smoothness and juiciness. ?Oh, don't do potstickers - after all the frying, it's not that smooth anymore. ?This does require some wait because they steam them when ordered. Homemade noodles: they have an assortment of big bowled noodles, and they're the best! ?There are very few places that make their own noodles, and handmade noodles have an extra chewiness and smoothness to them that machine/bought ones don't have. ?You can tell when they're homemade when the noodles are slightly uneven in thickness (machines make noodles all the same sized), and they usually have a better chew to them. ?Of the noodles, their biggest sellers are: "chao ma mien" (spicy, seafood, soup noodles) and black bean noodles (it looks really dark, but it's not salty). Spicy fried chicken wings: "gan peng ji" is juicy chicken wings deep fried then smothered in a sweet, spicy, and tasty sauce. ?A great balance of crunchiness and juiciness with sweet and spicy sauce. Atmosphere: as far as I can remember, they've always played 96.5 KOIT in the background, haha. ?It's a very clean restaurant - chopsticks always the disposable kind, you get a paper place mat. ?Sometimes there's a wait, but they usually have a quick turnover of tables so it's not too bad and you usually don't wait too long for food. Service: the many employees are rather quick with things - gets you seated, takes your order, brings you everything quickly. ?They usually all speak English, Mandarin, and Cantonese, and probably another Chinese dialect. ?They're usually well staffed, too, so always waiters around.

You know a restaurant is good if all the tables are full and there is a waiting list even when it's pouring outside. A group of friends and I came here on a Tuesday night, and the wait was insane! Every table in the restaurant was full, but the wait was definitely worth it. Their Dry fried chicken is soooooo good. Sweet, spicy, crispy, and NOT greasy! Green beans were delicious... we also ordered their shrimp and chive dumplings along with the pork dumplings which were also very good. Everything was perfectly seasoned and not greasy. Other items ordered included: chow mein with homemade noodles flounder filet with black bean sauce eggplant mongolian beef Service was ok, but given that they had a full house, eh we can overlook it.... especially when the servers are polite.

What can I say about this place that hasn't already been said? If you come here during the "normal" dinner times....expect a wait. They keep a wipe-off board inside to the right where you can write your name and the # of folks in your party so make sure to do that. I don't think they'll seat you until everyone in your party is there. Once you get seated....prepare to indulge. I always get the green beans. They are so fresh and crisp and delicious. The Hot and Sour soup is also bangin'. Perfect combination of hot and sour and just super yummy. I love their Jajangmyun (noodles in black bean sauce). I get the seafood version and its perfect! The sauce is just great. You can get it with homemade fresh noodles too. Last but not least of course is the dry fried chicken. I love them with the bone or without. It just depends on whether I feel like have sticky fingers that day or not. I think they're both delicious. Whenever I get a hankerin' for excellent chinese/korean cuisine I go here....but I always first stop to see what time it is and think whether or not my stomach can afford the wait.

Definitely one of my favorite restaurants. ?However, I recognize that not everything is good. ?Actually, most entrees are about average - it's just that the good dishes are damn good. ?I recommend: - Shrimp and leek dumplings - Dry fried chicken wings - Black bean noodles - Peanut sauce noodles - Potstickers - Dry fried flounder - Hot and sour soup I think everything else is kind of so-so (cherry pork, kung pao chicken, broccoli beef, etc), and I get kind of stumped when I have to order more dishes for larger groups. ?Also, yes, the wait sucks and parking ?can be painful. ?I often order it to go but I also like the loud, bustling atmosphere at other times. To set expectations - If you want regular Chinese dishes, San Tung isn't better than most other places. ?But if you want any of what I've recommended above (esp. the dumplings and dry fried chicken), there's no better place to go.

I think I am the 1001st person to review this restaurant. I write today to share a few more dishes that I love to eat here. The fried dumplings are off the hook. ?They are large, filled with good stuff (I especially enjoy the ginger in it) and really hot when they get to your table, so watch out. ?Be sure to make your own dipping sauce with the vinegar, soy sauce, and a touch of the hot oil. Dried fried flounder pieces. ?It's like the fish version of the chicken wings, and just as tasty. ?Give me that and a bowl of rice and I am happy. One other dish I would recommend is the spicy beef noodle soup. ?I think they make their own noodles, it's really good. ?The beef in the soup is really tender, and the flavor of the soup has just enough spice, but not too much. ?I sometimes crave this dish on a really cold day.

Okay, so the dry fried chicken is tasty, but that's about it. I've had their other "signature" dishes and they were just salty and had no flavor. I have to admit chinese food is my least favorite, but still.... Everything is so greasy or fried. But like I said, the chicken is tasty.

I am a Korean drama addict and asked my Korean friend where would the best place to eat jia jiang mein (black bean sauce noodles/aka black ink noodles) be? Her first thought was San Tung. Our other friend recommended, San Wang in Japantown. I went with my Korean friend's suggestion, not knowing what to expect. I only see the people in the dramas getting down with the noodle and slurping them up like they're the best things on earth. To me, it was just okay. I was expecting a punch of flavor. It was just okay. I loved the house made noodles. I'm wondering what sort of noodles the "authentic" Korean spots serve them with. My mom and SIL were all over the stuff claiming them to be something they've never had before but oh so good. The original dry fried chicken wings were everything I expected them to be. YUM! I've had them before and knew that I needed to have them again. Crack in the form of chicken wings, maybe so!

WOWIE! This place is fantastic, and it's definitely worth the long cold wait for a table. This has become my default restaurant for when my parents are in town. There's something about their food that is just enchanting. It's like nothing I've experienced elsewhere. Everyone (that's not vegetarian) MUST try the dry fried chicken wings -- they're out of this world! The atmosphere is pretty typical for a chinese restaurant. It's one large dining room that is usually pretty loud due to the amount of people they pack in. My only complaints are that they don't have a host/hostess managing the wait list (it's done on a white board), and there's very limited space to sit/stand inside while you're waiting for a table.

After spending ALLLL morning visiting stores on Halloween, Liz and I, both annoyed with the world met up at this joint. Of course, me being the yelper that I am did a quick search and I am so glad that I found this place! This was the highlight of our SF trip. Anywho, while we were waiting for our table, we anxiously looked over the menu and at every table to see what they were ordering. I already knew we were gonna get the dried chicken since it was mentioned repeatedly on yelp. This one couple literally had 3 orders and they were going through each basket as if they were on death row. I mean wings were flying all across their table. I don't think they even said a word to eachother. Well we got the sizzling rice soup, string beans, pot stickers, and the dried fried chicken. I don't remember anything else but the chicken to tell you the truth. It was sex in the mouth.... Mmm Mmm good! After that meal, we managed to get some light shopping done and went straight down for a nap cuz we're fatties fo life! :)

It's places like this that perpetuate the wrong idea when it comes to Chinese food: that it is cheap, fast and not that great. Good food should have a nice balance of flavors. The food here is over-salted, over-starched and is very oily.

Sang Tung rocks my socks. ?Truly the only Chinese restaurant I'll eat at anymore. ?If you are overly confused by their dictionary-sized menu, order the "dry-fry chicken wings, dry". ?Get that and you'll be happy. ?You'll be so happy that you'll probably be ordering another batch if your stomach can handle it. If you don't want to wait in line (which I haven't done in a while) and want to avoid their poor customer service, call in a to-go order. ?There is no wait and you get to eat your food at home.

The Original Dry Fried Chicken is good enough that nothing else about this restaurant matters. Among my friends, this dish is known simply as Crack Chicken. The name speaks for itself. My biggest problem is that when I start eating Crack Chicken I don't know how to stop and, anyway, I don't want to.

I've had other dishes like the noodles with black bean sauce (I only used half the noodles since it didn't have enough sauce) and the dumplings which are fine but I come for the wings. ?I have their number on speed dial so I can get in, get out, and gorge. ?Yes it's that good; my steering wheel and stick shift are sticky from eating the wings while driving home.

Inevitably, my friends and I always seem to come here after a night of debauchery. The dry fried chicken wings, black bean noodles, and potstickers are AMAZING and instant cure for a hangover. Hopefully you get lucky and find some parking quickly otherwise you could be driving around for a bit. Once you walk into the restaurant, put your name on the list and wait for a table to open up. The wait can often be extremely long but trust me, the dry fried wings are DELICIOUS and completely worth it. Mmm... dry fried chicken wings. *licks lips*

I went to San Tung's for the first time with some peeps that are heavily in the know about it. They knew what time to go and what to order. Since there's 650+ reviews, I don't need to rehash the classics. Yes, when you order right it is damn good. We got there at 5:50 and the peeps in the know were blown away that we got seated immediately. The waiter didn't even give a shit that one of us BYOBed. With a tallboy no less. Probably the best Chinese food I've had that I can remember. Only glitch was that a triad waiter was heavily muggin me, I think he wanted to get into a drift contest with me. Fool.

San Tung is a restaurant that serves Chinese-Korean themed dishes (to me, a tad more on the Chinese side). ?It is situated on Irving between 11th and 12th, making it close to all the action on 9th. ?I came here for the first time last Sunday at around 1:30pm with 3 friends. ?To recap my experience: 1. Parking was a pain as it usually is in this part of the neighborhood. ?Had to drive around the block a few times before landing a residential spot 3 blocks away. 2. Was seated immediately upon arrival (we came a bit late to try avoiding the lines that build up around noon). ?It was the last open table - hurrah! 3. Service was slow (the waiter didn't act like he liked working there so it took some effort to get his attention), but we ended up ordering 4 items: pork dumplings, black bean sauce noodles, beef with black mushrooms, and the infamous dry fried chicken wings. 4. Food arrived promptly and was overall, quite tasty. ?The wings were by far the best, as flavor packed as most others have described (I may need to get 2 orders the next time I come with friends!). ?Second, in terms of tastiness, would have to be the noodles which had a good combination of sauce + ingredients for flavor, but also ran for miles (it was a challenge to get them onto a plate). ?Tied for third would be the dumplings and beef. Although I saw a table eat dumplings exclusively (I guess some people might consider them pretty baller?), I didn't consider them or the beef as items to write home about since it seemed like I've had similar or better from other Chinese joints. 5. Total after tax and tip was ~$50 (each dish ran about ~$9 each and we had white rice for $1.50 a person on top of that). All in all, I consider this to be a 3.5 star establishment (going to round that up to 4 since the glass is ALWAYS half full). ?The wings are must try for first timers and the rest of the food isn't too bad. ?It's probably a good idea to come at a weird time of day in order to avoid the lines and parking nightmare - unless you really want to kill some time.

I decided to give this place a try since I regularly see 45 minute waits. After waiting about an hour we were finally seated, actually I should say packed in the very middle. The service was quick but the food was really disappointing. My boyfriend tried to order a vegetarian dish and the server got really annoyed after he asked whether there would be any fish sauce in his dish. I ordered a shrimp dish with rice, and no joke my vegetables and shrimp were floating in way too much sauce which looked like it had so much cornmeal in it that it should just be called a shrimp jello. I really don't see the point of coming here, you cannot hold a dinner conversation because it is so loud, feel pressured to leave b/c the front is packed with people, and are served bland food.

so im not sure if ppl know this, but san tung is what the chinese restaurants are like in KOREA, the menu is developed by chinese immigrants who came to korea and kind of made this chinese-korean fusion style, so i grew up eating BLACK BEAN SAUCE NOODLE and that bbq chicken wings (its call KKanPoongGee), i know this place is famous for the bbq wings, u can also ask for beef, pork or shrimps done in same style and i gotta say their black bean sauce noodle is very very good, one of the better ones ive had in my life, this is another one of those places i dont need to talk about too much cause its super famous already 4 stars

Sweet-finger-lickin' good dry fried chicken wings! This is a must here. The black bean noodle was not my cup of tea, may be because I prefer noodle soup or noodles with lots of gravy. Yea, it's a bit bland and greasy...FREE LIP GLOSS! Their potstickers are good too, eat them right away when they are hot. When they start getting cold, the potstickers limp and become soggy. The service is very friendly and prompt. However, I wish someone came by to refill my water..*sad tear. I came here after church, my friend was dropped off to get the seating. My boyfriend and I searched for parking. Finding parking around that neighborhood is frustrating.

My friend let out a happy sigh, pushed away her emptied soup bowl, and said, "Can we cancel everything else to come and just drink the soup all day? ?It's not going to get any better for me." ?

My two friends that I came here with, Lona Z. and Liz C., were having a catch-up dinner. We decide to have a late dinner because we knew the lines would be long, so we got there around 9pm where there was still a bit of a line. We finally sit down after 30 minutes of waiting - I"m thinking, the food better be worth this wait in the cold...and it definitely was. We ordered: *sauteed string beans *dry black bean noodles *pot stickers *wet fried chicken wings Next time, I'd like to try the dry chicken wings because some people say it tastes better than the wet, but I'm sure it's all based on preference. We couldn't order both because there was only us - 3 little asian girls. A line at 9pm on a Wednesday night is a pretty good indication that people come to this restaurant no matter what day and what time just because it is THAT good. 4 stars only because portion sizes could've been bigger. Good thing we ordered 4 dishes to share.

One word: DELICIOUS-NESS!! Food: 1) Sizzling Rice Soup: really good! Love the ingredients and the taste! Kinda feels like a little bit too much MSG was added to this soup but whatever, it tasted really good! 2) Dry fried chicken: This was not DRY at all! Think of this as a really good Chinese spin to honey BBQ chicken wings with a spicy kick to it! I don't even like fried chicken wings and I was totally digging these wings! 3) Shrimp and leek dumplings: Tasted fresh and seafood sweet! YUM YUm! 4) Pan fried green beans: Not too oily like other places make it. Fresh green beans really helped! Great dish! Service: For how busy this place is, I've got to say that they are pretty on top of things. They were good about refilling tea and really good about refilling our complimentary psuedo-kim chi! Our soup came out pretty fast and so did our chicken wings..........but I'm pretty sure they forgot the last half of our order....because we ended up waiting an HOUR for it and we had to ask THREE waiters because someone did something about it. So the service would have been satisfactory if they didn't forget about our order! Ambiance: Really crowded! It's a full house and a bit of a wait! But good news, that also means it's good enough for ppl to wait in this economy (even on a THURSDAY night!) This place is really fully of life! It's hustling and bustling with ppl and conversations! Quiet nice if you like crowds. Price: Pretty descent prices for Chinese food and when you factor in how good it is.....it's DARN CHEAP! Overall: I wouldn't mind returning for some good old fashion Chinese Food done right!

Best kam poongi (spicy dry chicken wings) ?and sahm sun kkan jja jjang (noodles in black bean sauce ) in the Northern California bay area hands down. They dont take reservations, so If you go on a Friday/Sat night at 6 or later, be prepared to wait an hour. Just a note. When using the bathroom they have this super NASA turbo system sticking out of the back of the toilet, and a sign that says push button in the middle to flush. Its kind of weird ?sort of like someone saying stick your finger in my belly button and watch the magic. I was however thoroughly impressed with the flushing power.

Mmmm tasty! Good priced, good tasting Chinese food. Like most people have said, their dry fried chicken is good, but the sauce is a liiiittle sweet for my taste. I like it diced. I really like their noodle dishes; the peanut noodles are good and theres two spicy seafood ones, but I dont remember which one i like better. Otherwise, of the other dishes I've tried, they're pretty standard Chinese dishes and are pretty good, but not super amazing. This place is your typical Chinese place with not high class service and not super clean, but it's not bad. Overall, good priced, good food. I'll continue to come here.

Okay, so the thing with me is Chinese food makes me sick. I can name each time I've gotten food poisoning, found a bug or hair in my food. If I risk it and do give into a Chinese food craving- I feel really full but then I always end up hungry again right after. I came home to find an order of the dry fried chicken wings and fried rice for dinner. I've heard such good things of this place and the chicken, I had to sample it. The sample led to me getting my own small plate to a second serving with my own steamed rice and I ate til I was full. No sicky-ness here, and that's a plus. The fried chicken wings were nice and crisp and packed a little kick, while the inside stayed meaty and juicy. Nice little spice and just a hint of sweetness- my kinda chicken. The fried rice was OK, I'm more of a Thai fried rice kinda person cause I hate peas. I may just have to give in and check this place out!

Everyone swears that this place is some sort of hidden local gem, but I find it to be indistinguishable from most of the other Chinese restaurants in the area. ? I think maybe it appeals to purists of sort of distinct regional cuisine. I tried the chicken wings on someone's recommendation, and they were OK, I guess. ?Not bad, but not as good as the fried chicken I had at some place in the general vicinity of Nob Hill one time many years ago.

Their wings are usually the one and only thing we come here for. This past time we went, we decided to order some tender greens, sauteed string beans, and the dry sauce calamari, which didn't disappoint. The sauce for the dry sauce chicken was good the first few bites, but was a little overpowering and far too sweet to keep eating. It was like candied orange chicken.

This is probably one of my favorite Chinese places in the city. My only issue was the wait, but you can order to-go and avoid that. So many good things to say. First of all, it's so well priced! I've been here with 6 people and it was only $10 a person for more than enough food. I've been here with bigger groups, and the bill has always been very reasonable. My favorite dishes: Beef Chow Mein Potstickers - perfectly pan friend and pretty large servings Pork and Leek Dumplings - some of the best dumplings I have EVER had. Meat was seasoned deliciously, dumpling skin was the perfect thickness. Chicken Wings - yes, everyone talks about them, and yes, they are that good. I tend not to like wings that much, but these are the perfect combination of sweet and salty. The only thing that I didn't enjoy that much were the Black Bean Noodles. I saw a lot of great reviews for these so I ordered them, but the taste was just not for me. I expected the dish to be salty, but it was definitely sweeter than I usually prefer it to be. However, plenty of other great things to eat!

It seems after each successive visit, my view of this restaurant dims....the popularity of the place seems to rest on primarily two dishes: the dumplings and fried chicken wings. ?The dumplings are not bad but not striking in light of other Sandong specialty restuarants and I still don't see what all the hoopla is for the chicken wings. ?Yes, it is tender and juicy but it also tastes like candy. ?It is the Korean version of Chinese food. ?[For those who don't know, Chinese food is served all over the world and in many cases tailored to local tastes.] Pos: one of few places in the City to get authentic water dumplings Negs: other Chinese dishes considered average, long lines, parking is hard.

Dry Fried Chicken Wings, Dumplings, Ja Jiang Mien, Beef noodle soup, bamboo shoot/water chesnut/ beans.... all great! ?San Tung Food may be too oily to some people. Leave the Kimchi alone. ?It is really not that great and does no justice to what food they REALLY offer. ? Long wait -- even weekdays. ?I was put on the wait list at 9pm on a Thursday night. Be prepared to stuff yourself here without emptying your wallet. ?:)

Dry fried chickennnnnnnnnnnnnnnn! Do they even serve anything else? Dry fried chicken, cubed, dry. Not wet. Love the kimchi. Love the Northern Chinese cuisine. I don't have to doctor the hot and sour soup. The wait is horrendous, but whatever. I always get over it. Even better, do like I do and keep a San Tung take-out menu in the car.

What is there to say about San Tung that hasn't been said before. ?Out of all of the restaurants in San Francisco, this is definitely one of my favorites. ?It's super affordable and has great food. ?This is the kind of restaurant you must take non-locals to because it's off the beaten path. ? Dry-fried chicken wings, string beans, fish are all tasty! ?Noodles and dumplings are also top notch. ?I'll leave this review short and sweet because I'm just another San Tung addict who loves this place. Note: ?It's closed on Wednesdays. ?Something that I forgot last time and was very unhappy that my San Tung craving was not satistifed that night.

Wow 1100 reviews? ?Dang I almost don't want to leave one, that's pretty intimidating. ?But I gotta give my 2 cents. Great noodles. And yes the chicken wings are very good. They must put crack in their wings cuz I just polished off a plate by myself. =) We ordered a plate of the wings, a jam bong, and an order of jja-jja noodles. Noodles were fresh and the the jam bong. Man on a cold day this hot spicy soup hits the SPOT. Just warms you up from the inside out. Tons of seafood in that bad boy. So you gotta like the seafood. Now those damn wings. They don't seem like they'd be that good, but when I asked the waiter what is that chicken dish that everyone orders and he rolls his eyes and says "chicken wings", you know they're a staple. They're a little spicy and sweet but oh so good. I didn't even use a separate plate. They didn't last that long. I just polished off that plate of wings in like 5 minutes. Stay away if you like chicken wings cuz you're gonna be ordering a bunch. Oh yeah parking is HORRENDOUS in this area. Take the muni or something or just have your friend drive so you don't have to park, especially if you have a mini van.

Two restaurants, both alike in dignity, In Fair Sunset, where we lay our scene, From ancient sludge we draw our swords In the form of menus most unclean. For one Stands San Tung, for another G Rice Bowl A pair of star cross'd lovers, we diners be. Whole fish fried with beauteous blows Do with their death appease our yearning appetite. The fearful binary of San or Gold, And the continuance of eternal choice which but the free markets can remove is now judged by traffic of each stage; The which if you with patient tongues attend, What G shall miss, Tung shall strive to mend.

This place doesn't need a long raving review as it gets enough buzz. I tried the famous dry fried wings, black bean sauce noodles (jja jjang myun as us Koreans call it), and the pork dumplings. The breading on the chicken isn't too thick/heavy or too crispy, but has a wafer-like crunch to it. The sauce isn't too sweet or salty with a right amount of spice. Beautiful balance and taste. The noodles were good but I'd opt for the non seafood one on my visit as the seafood does alter the taste enough for me to go without it. Dumplings are definitely made in house and made well to boot. My only gripe is that it's 20 mins away excluding the heavy traffic, bad parking, and always expected wait inside the restaurant. But hey, when you have all that resting in your stomach, it's hard to think it wasn't worth it. Because saying otherwise is blasphemy. Saying I will be back is an understatement.

My friend and I ordered the sweet and sour soup and the vegetable chow fun. ?Both were disapointment. ?The broth of the soup had a sweet artificial flavor. ?And the chow ?fun was inundated with some kind of oily sauce (which again had a strange sweetness to it - weird I then discovered that they use MSG! ?That answered all our questions. ?No wonder the ?food tasted sharp but not tasty and flavorful. Perhaps we ordered the wrong dishes. ?Nonetheless, I will not return because of the use of MSG.

San Tung rocks the house. As SO's big brother the similarities are very noticeable. However, San Tung has a great selection of other, more traditional stuff, like seafood dishes, which we didn't try since there were only 3 of us and just getting the "greatest hits" (fried chicken and noodles) and then some veggies to make us feel less guilty, made us overflowingly full. We showed up on a Saturday around 5:30pm and waited about 30-45 minutes to get in. The whole thing is a very well oiled operation and even after we got in the service was curt, yet useful and quick. There's constantly waiter after waiter dashing down each row of tables to deliver a new dish or take another order. A pro tip that some others have mentioned here is that you can call to pre-order, AND you can also call to get your name on the list if you need to eat in. So, great place, and I'm glad I went - but realistically I'd rather just pop in to SO instead, which is 2 blocks from my house. San Tung is the legend; SO is the practical execution of that legend.

DRY FRIED CHICKEN WINGS. ?That is all I have to say about San Tung. 5 stars for the chicken alone. The other dishes are decent. ?Parking is kind of difficult and the wait can get to be quite long especially during dinner time hours. ?Trust me, the chicken is worth the wait though. ?When people are wiling to stand outside in the cold or rain for a restaurant, it has to be good! On a side note, the one thing I don't get about this place is the table with the huge pile of green beans. ?Does anyone know what I'm talking about? I've never had a green bean dish here, but I guess they use plenty of em. Everyone on the staff is all about snapping the green beans any chance they get. ?Talk about teamwork!

Dry fried chicken, black bean sauce noodles, green beans, and braised flounder fillet--those are my staples. ?I always come by here anytime I'm in the Sunset--which is not often enough! ?Depending on when you come by, the wait may take a while. ?But more often than not, if I come by around 5 on a Saturday--with a party of four I'm only waiting about 15mins. ?Any later and the crowds build up putting your wait to much longer. ?The food is really good and the price is reasonable. ?What more could you want?

I really like this place. Sure they get really busy and super crowded but that's part of what I love about this place haha. If a place is crowded, that means its gotta be crackin', right? Of course I'm right. :P Anyways onto the food, great appetizers (chicken wings are a MUST, as well as the calamari), there is a soup I can't remember...I think its the spicy noodle soup? I dunno but it was good! We ordered the cashew chicken, mongolian beef, chow mein, dumplings, broccoli beef and I think sweet+sour pork? I went with a large group so its hard to remember all the things we ordered. We were lucky to be given a private table (inside the room) because of our group size. Everything was very delish! I've been here several times actually and I've never left disappointed (on the contrary, happy+full). Great food, fun staff/service. I normally hate waiting for tables at restaurants but for San Tung the food is worth the wait. I recommend going in a group cuz you'll save more on the bill + you can try out more foods!

Yup, another an A-OK typical chinese restaurant in the bay area. People rave about their chicken wings here, I have to say, their wings are the bomb. Crispy, succulent, and really deep fried (some restaurant serve chicken wings still half cooked and have blood inside, wth?) Another good food from this restaurant is their noodle. Not too mushy, not too hard, serves perfect. I just recommend you guys if you happen to read my review, don't come here during Thanksgiving day, or Christmas day, or NYE. Because you know all chinese restaurant open during all those days where other western restaurant are closed, right? So if you happen to bump here since they're the only open open on that day. Be prepare to stand on a very long line, and watch out for sneaky people who try to cut your line. Oh yeah, they have to fix their waiting line system too. Well, it's quite hard to expect a place like this to have buzzers like Cheesecake Factory. What a shame they're still doing the "write your name on the board". It's a chinese place in SF. what do you expect?

if you don't want to wait, go to the bubble tea next door and order here. they actually bring the food out to the tables in the bubble tea place. for koreans, we always seem to order the the jja jjang myun (black bean noodles), jjang pong (spicy seafood noodles), and kkang poong gi (dried chicken wings) when going to chinese restaurants. They seem to use more premium ingredients than your average korean-chinese restaurant for the black bean noodles. ex: for the black bean sauce (instead of just the standard sauce + veggies, they also add slices of beef as well). the spicy seafood noodle soup was just average. the soup always seems kind of luke warm instead of hot and the broth is just average. nothing about it really stands out to me. the chicken wings are good, crispy, good sauce. tastes similar to kkangpoongi i've had at other chinese-korean restaurants. garlic chicken - not really a fan. for some reason the sauce was brown, and didn't taste very garlic-y. overall i give this place 3.5 stars but i'll go ahead and round to 4.

I'm adding nothing new to this thread, but they're just so good that I have to repeat what everyone has said, the wings! The best chicken wings anywhere. I don't care if you prefer Buffalo Wings, Angel Wings, Popeyes or KFC type fried chicken. These are the best chicken wings you will ever try. Different from any and all others: powerful, sweet, and surprising. My other favorite are the pork dumplings, give me the dozen along with the Dry Fried Chicken Wings and I'm good to go.

Love San Tung! I usually order the diced dried fried chicken (of course!), because it's so much easier to eat and not as messy. Sooo goooddd!! I also usually get potstickers or their dumplings and the peanut noodle. Oh and the green beans are good too, with just the right amount of spice. I would recommend coming in groups of 4 or less, unless you want to eat as early as your grandma (at 5PM). ;)

Can't go wrong with "homestyle" cooking. This is a family ran business and I've tried most of their items on the menu, but everytime I go, I always get one thing. Dried fried chicken wings. It's sweet, tangy, a lil spicy, but above all, the chicken is moist! I would give it 5 stars, but the service is some what rude. Always, feel like I have to rush on what to order. I bring all my friends that visit me to this restaurant to enjoy the food, have a few beers, and kick back. It's probably the only restaurant in SF that serve the food that is still "hot" when it comes out.

I had been hearing about their chicken wings for a while now. Tonight i finally had the opportunity to go and try it out. My friend had never been either, but he was told that the black bean noodles were really good too. So we got those two and a plate of potstickers. It was all pretty tasty. Yes, the wings were really good. Yes, the black bean noodles were good (not as phenomenal as his friend said they were). The potstickers were huge. The wait was about an hour though, and i felt it kind of necessary to just eat and get out because i didn't want to hold up the table for anyone else who might be waiting. It's not the best atmosphere to feel so rushed. I'll probably come here again and get the chicken wings again, but during off peak hours. And no, i will never describe the wings as "money" as another reviewer did a few days prior to this review. It's not 1994.

I would never go here for anything other than the potstickers and the chicken wings, maybe the beef noodle soup but everything else looks/tastes like subpar Chinese/Korean food. Those chicken wings though i don't know what they're smothered in but I can only suspect it is a mixture of ginger, chili, garlic and liquid crack. Don't bother getting them done boneless, it just ends up being a dry, sticky mess of what would have otherwise been deliciously tender and juicy wings.

Ordered string beans, zha jay mien noodles #7, THE wings (this place is known for some amazingly tastey,moist n' crispy wings) now, I know most folks don't think of Chinese restaurants for wings, but their wings are bomb. Ttwo orders of pot stickers, tofu with minced pork. And several other dishes, always great food here. Except the chicken/broccoli was weak, perhaps the brown sauce is the culprit. nuff said. Decor: ok, always filled with happy, hungry, chatty patrons, families. Your prototypical San Francisco Chinese eatery for locals and those in-the-know.

We actually came before the rush, came on a Saturday around 11:15AM. I think the rush came around 11:30AM. Table for 3 please. We came for CHICKEN WANGS!!!! Yes wangs, not wings, that's how I say it. Ordered: ~black bean sauced noodles http://www.yelp.com/biz_… A big bowl for all 3 of us. It was good & saucy. I couldn't decide between this and the dried black bean sauced noodles, don't know what the real difference is. I chose this, because dry might have been too dry, maybe I'll get that next time. ~2 orders of chicken wangs (wings) http://www.yelp.com/biz_… http://www.yelp.com/biz_… One order would have been enough, but we got 2 just in case we wanted more. Tasty, delicious, yummm. Do I need to say more? ~dry fried beef http://www.yelp.com/biz_… It said spicy, but it wasn't THAT spicy. It was good & tasty. ~free chinese style kimchee http://www.yelp.com/biz_… It was okay, not great. Total was a little under $40 including tax, not including tip. Lots of leftover food for the next meal. It looked like we didn't eat hardly any of the food, even though we all ate a lot. I must say everything made me feel THIRSTY. Very thirsty, all the salt, spices & whatnot made me THIRSTY. Parking is hard. Service is ruder than most Chinese places. I don't understand how that can possibly be. Old guys were meaner than the younger ones, maybe it's that they've worked there for so long & have come to hate their job. They put fortune cookies on the plate with the check. We didn't eat it because people put CASH on it, grossssss. I wish the fortune cookies were in a wrapper, then I'd eat it.

Like everyone said, their dry friend chicken wings are the best things here - a little sweet, a little spicy, and fried to perfection. ?However, there were other items I enjoyed as well, like their black bean paste noodles and their five spice beef noodle soup. Was the food alone worth the hour wait? ?Perhaps not. ?Was the combination of the food plus good conversations with old and new friends worth it? ?Absolutely x 250. P.s.

After witnessing 8,000,000 people standing outside of this restaurant on a Sunday evening, we decided to flip an U and try another time. Less than 48 hours later, we drove up on Tuesday evening and decided to wait with just 3,000,000 people outside of the restaurant. There was a lot of hype over San Tung. There were a ton of whoo-whoo over their dried fried chicken wings. There were plenty of hungry fans standing outside waiting for a table. There were talks of this being the best Chinese restaurant in Sunset, maybe even San Francisco. These guys had expectations after expectations to live up to.

I love this place for their dumplings and dried fried chicken. ?The pork dumplings and the shrimp and leek dumplings are my favorite things to order here. ?These dumplings are boiled in water, so don't expect steamed dumplings. ?If you want steamed dumplings, order the steamed pork potstickers instead. ? The dried fried chicken is unique because I haven't seen other places make it like this. ?You can order dried fried chicken wings or diced cubes of dried fried chicken. ?There are no bones if you order the diced dried fried chicken, but minus points to the scraps of fried batter with no chicken on the bottom of the dish. ?The chicken is coated in a sweet and salty sauce and the batter is nice and crunchy. My other favorites from this restaurant are the garlic green beans and the dry black bean noodles. ? Beware this restaurant usually has a long wait. ?I came last night on a Tuesday, and I had to wait about five minutes for a table. ?I only had to wait five minutes because I came a bit before 6 PM. ?Once I sat down, I saw a crowd building up outside the restaurant. ?A line for dinner on a Tuesday night??? ?Crrazzyyy...

The dry fried chicken wings didn't disappoint! For about $10, you get 7-8 pieces (wings and drumsticks). They're sweet, salty, crispy and dangerously good. You can also get the chicken cut in small-ish pieces instead of wings/drumsticks if you prefer to eat it that way... Also tried the mu shu chicken which was fantastic! Comes with 4 wrappers (think thin tortillas) and hoisin sauce of course. Yum. The shrimp and leek dumplings were also a hit. We also tried the steamed postickers which were good, but I'd definitely go with the regular fried ones next time. For the 4 of us, we got 5 dishes and the bill was about $53. There seems to always be a wait but the line moves fast. They will consolidate smaller parties and make you eat at a communal round table. Can't wait to come back!

A Chinese restaurant cannot rest on its dry fried chicken and shrimp dumplings alone!! OK, maybe it can, as evidenced by the insane crowd in- and outside of San Tung. Seriously, though, the veggie chow mien was a bit greasy and lacking in veggies and the kung pao chicken is NOTHING compared to that of Abacus (http://www.yelp.com/biz/…). HOWEVER, San Tung's hot & sour soup is f#$%ing fantastic, and I will go back for that alone...seriously, gallons and GALLONS of it. (Mmm, they use shrimp instead of pork...drool.) And, yes, I will definitely try the dry fried chicken next time I stop in to ladle soup down my throat. (Besides, I was forced into the kung pao by the bf, who insists on that dish ad infinitum.) A 3.5ish star experience overall: 4.5 for the soup 2.5 for the other dishes 4 for the reasonable prices 4 for the staff attitude...the guy on the phone was incomprehensible and gruff, but I got "thank yous" from no less than 3 staff members on the way out.

I CAN'T BELIEVE IT!! Came here for lunch on Tuesday and, for once, there wasn't a line! usually, the line is unbelievably long! You want to eat at 7pm? Better get your butt down there and put your name on the board by 5pm. Their food is definitely worth the wait! I usually come here with my friend, whom I've known since preschool. We both like the exact same dishes so there is never a problem ordering family style with her. BOY can we eat! ?We go in hungry like lions and come out stuffed like hibernating bears. For starters we would order the pork dumplings and potstickers. MMM! ?each bite is full of bliss. The sweet juice from the dumplings gushes out and excites each and every taste buds. For entree we'd get the black bean sauce noodles, three deluxe Spicy sauce noodles, orginal dry fried chicken *diced*, ?dried sauteed string beans and garlic flavored egg plant. SPICY SPICY SPICY! we love it! Only at San Tung are we able to eat this much. Nothing left to go, finished to the bottom of the bowls and plates are licked clean. Tab isn't pricey either. Satisfied every time. Don't expect great service, but they do the best that they can. These guys are so busy running around, they look slimmer each time I go in!

Ok, it's not the most delicious food I've had. Waiting in the crowded front area for a seat is enough to send a claustrophobic person (ME!) to the nuthouse. It's certainly not romantic either. But damn those dry fried chicken wings are good. I will come here and order much more than I can eat, just so I can eat it cold the next morning. And I like variety. I also get out of there for super cheap as well. It's the place to go! Besides, is there anything more romantic than chicken grease all over you and your date's faces?

Dry Fried Chicken Wings, Dry Black Bean Sauce Noodles... 2 must gets. Went here for Derek's birthday. I freaking love these 2 dishes. I have to order these 2 dishes. You can order other stuff, but get these 2. If you don't you're seriously missing out. One time, after Halloween a few years back, I ate 2 orders of dry fried chicken wings to myself. Then I came back the next day for the wings because they are that damn good. The noodles are super filling and really good... and are also a constant order for me, as there is nothing really like this. Other stuff we ordered: Green beans - pretty standard. Fried perfectly for that good crunch with a good amount of garlic. Simple and very well executed dish. Typically, I don't like wasting time with veggy dishes, but they perfected this dish, so I would definitely consider the green beans if you are looking for a green dish. Dumplings - these were ok. Nothing spectacular... ?then again, I was spoiled from the ones I had in socal about a month ago so thats really not a fair comparison. Fried Fish - again another very standard dish. Simple in presentation but very delicious. Hard to really mess up this order. Another one to note in the books to consider ordering. Excellent service as always, and they gave us a free round of nigori sake shots. Seriously... get the wings and black bean sauce... I got hungry just thinking about those. Those 2 alone, coupled with a little bit of perks here n there are what make me love this restaurant. I'm glad it isn't closer to my house... otherwise I'd probably be obese.

Five big duckets you ask? Has J-boy gone CWAZY?? For San Tung, you betta believe it!!! They're one of my favorites. I used to be all "ssshhhh don't tell anyone but there's this place." ?Then I found out that everyone and their pet Tuttle was doing the "Sssshhhhh don't tell anyone." Then everyone told everyone, "and they told 2 friends, and so on and so on and so on." ? Well, the secrets out people! Let's just admit it. San Tung should be one of the top Chinese (w/ a bit of Korean) ?Restaurants in the bay, but I think everyone is trying to keep it as their own guilty pleasure. ? Not to be missed: Chive Dumplings; Original Chicken (though it'll clog the arteries of a Sumo wrestler); Ja Jiang Mien, Seaweed Soup. ?Get your name in early on Saturdays otherwise you're eating at the Viet place next door (Yumi, Yumi), which isn't bad....just sucks to see everyone leaving ST all fat and happy with their meal done right, while your slurping down some Pho.

5 for the food and price! ?For this most recent visit we had a group of 7 for a 7pm reservation. ?Of course its packed inside the restaurant and outside of the front door. ?We had to wait a good 30 min. before we actually got to sit down but what can you expect? ? Everyone talks about the Dry Fried Chicken but pretty much anything fried there is bomb. ?I'm sure its horribly bad for you but it hurts so good! ?Just cleanse the body with some tea and you're good though right? ?That's what my mom always told me at least. ?We had a couple of dumpling dishes (I'm a fan of the shrimp and leeks) and some of their homemade noodles. ?The three spices noodle was pretty good but I kinda expected more flavor...and a serving spoon of some sort. Overall, we got a bill around $70! ?Service was quick but unorganized and they could probably expand their business and get a larger restaurant space (like sushi house did back in the days), but $10/person is hard to beat.

Some food leaves you feeling like you're a better person. That's San Tung. The wait was 800 percent worth it, particularly with Peasant Pies right next door. After we were seated, we were promptly served and our food came very quickly. (Beware -- the starter kimchi is HOT!) We ordered the peanut noodles with scallops and shrimp, as well as the garlic chicken. Both were wonderful, particularly the garlic chicken, which instantly turned me into Mother Theresa. Remember what I said about being a better person? Man, even the fortune cookies were better than normal.

I read about 15 of these reviews before deciding what to order. ?We went as a group of 9 so we got to sample quite a few dishes. ? As a mostly-vegetarian, here's what I would order again next time: (1) vegetarian Egg Rolls (2) vegetarian Mu-Shu (3) Seafood Noodles* (4) Dried Fried Chicken Wings* (5) Dried String Beans: nothing spectacular but if you want veggies this is good for you and tastes good. (6) Sauteed veggies with tofu: decent but not the best dish here. * = remember I'm mostly vegetarian. ?Few things are worth compromising for. Depending on how vegetarian you are, these items may be worthwhile. In my opinion, these were overrated: Potstickers Peanut noodles Hope this helps other veggie yelpers! ---- There's almost always a line outside. ?People wait 30-60 minutes to get a table. ?If you're going with a large enough group (6+? I'm not sure..we had 9) make reservations ahead of time! ?You'll feel great skipping the long line.

During one of my visits to the Bay area, my good friend brought me to San Tung for lunch. All I remembered during our twenty minute scout for a parking space during the lunch rush was how delicious the dry fried chicken wings were. At the time, I was a tad bit skeptical. Wings are wings - either they're extra dry, extra saucy, or not saucy enough. So wrong! I can't even remember what else we had ordered that afternoon, but I can still recollect the deliciousness of the dry fried wings. It's amazing how the wings stayed quite crispy even though it was doused with a sweet, tangy, sticky sauce. Just imagine a cross between the crunchy exterior of a right-out-of-the-fryer fried chicken with the moistness of a ?rotisserie style like chicken - all covered with a sticky honey sauce. ?A sauce that isn't too runny nor too thick- just the right viscosity to make each bit savorlishious! ?That mouth watering vision is what the famous wings are all about. A definite must try!

Order the wings!! It's what they are famous for! They are really awesome! But im sure that sauce would make a shoe taste phenomenal the rest of the food is pretty good, but not too diferent from most chinese places in the city. It's the wings! The wings are the clincher! Usually there is a long wait (its the wings!!) but it moves pretty quickly... and trust me, im an elite :)))

This place presents some mixed issues. ?What it does well, is more enough to convince most people to return. ?My friends have dragged me here a number of times, and the chicken wings alone have made the trip worthwhile, and was supplemented quite well by the stir fry items we ordered. ?That said, this it isn't a restaurant where you can point blindly at the menu and get good food. ?The dumplings and pot stickers were bland and far too soggy; just about any noodle dish was atrocious. ?Either way, the menu prices were so cheap that we didn't feel ripped off on any one item which didn't meet our standards. Normally I would have given this place four stars, but I'm obligated to knock it down a peg based on bad service. ?One of the waiters waved down our group after departing the establishment and asked us to tip him, claiming we hadn't. ?It's very well possible we didn't, and the other people in our group didn't feel that bad since they enjoyed the food and service so much. ?I however consider it a cardinal sin to ask for a tip.

Decor: typical Chinese restaurant with simple wooden tables and lazy susan's in the middle. Devour: just order the dry fried chicken wings. Worth the wait.

The best way to tell whether a Chinese restaurant is good for Yelpers is not by how many Chinese are in the restaurant overall. The litmus test is to scope out the number of young adult Chinese in that restaurant. The more you see, the more you can be assured that the food is good and not your average Chinese fare. What's the logic behind it? Young Chinese adults typically grow up in families where typically the only food consumed in restaurants is Chinese food. As a result, we grow tired of the standard Chinese fare and so veto those types of restaurants when going out with friends (sucks for the non-Chinese friends who want to eat Chinese). If you see a lot of us in a restaurant unaccompanied by old adults, it means the restaurant's food is so good that it has overided our veto of Chinese food. San Tung is exactly the type of place where you'll see us in hoards, willing to withstand a long wait, in order to consume the deliciousness that is the dried fried chicken (I prefer diced because it requires less work than the wings to eat). I can only explain it this way to the novices: think of Panda Express orange chicken only INFINITELY better. Don't be put off by the use of Panda Express. I think the chickens die willingly for that dish. My other favorites are the sauce noodles and pot stickers. The potstickers are made fresh, though careful not to order too much food because these are the biggest potstickers I've ever seen. I'd actually think about naming my first born Dried Fried Chicken Diced if it weren't for the fact that I'd feel like a hypocrite for making fun of parents who name their kids weird things such as Female and Apple. Get here really early or really late for lunch and dinner as it gets packed easily. I hear you can call in for a reservation but I've never done that. Parking is huge pain on the weekend but easier on the weekday. It'll delay your consumption of the chicken, which may make you upset.

Initially, I didn't really like San Tung. Just your regular neighborhood Chinese restaurant, if you get what I'm saying. There are larger portions at other Chinese places... And then I really put this place into perspective. I have to put my name down in order to get a seat for 2,3, or 4. I have to fight for parking in the inner Sunset in order to eat at this establishment. I have to talk over insanely loud crowds in order to be heard from a friend across the table. I am served kimchee...at a Chinese place. My waiter acts as if he doesn't speak English... And yet, to top these thoughts off, I have had the most amazing dry fried chicken wings ($8.00) I've ever had. The dried sauteed string beans ($6.50) are perfectly - and I emphasize perfectly - cooked. The black bean sauce noodles ($7.00) are delicious, but the dry version, for .75 more, may be even better. Craziness! Their lunch specials are all under $8, most of the dishes being around the $5.50 range. I would say their peak hours are around dinner time and early afternoon. Late lunches, anyone? For food this good, I can't help but ignore horrible street parking, long waits, and so-so service. It's definitely worth all of my time and money.

I was ready to get blow away by San Tung Chinese Restaurant. ?Afterall, it's not everyday you walk into a establishment that has more than 2000 reviews! ? We walked in around 7p, wrote a name down on their little white board by the front door, and waited for about 45 minutes. ?There is no frou-frou here, but the place was packed, smelled delicious, and everything looked incredibly good. ? Here's what we ordered: 1) Hot and Sour Soup 2) Shrimps with Snow Peas 3) Dried Sauteed String Beans 4) Original Dried Fried Chicken I found the first three dishes to be so-so. ?The winner was definitely the Original Dried Fried Chicken. ?You must order this if you come to San Tung. ?Even though this is located about an hour from me, that chicken could get me to get in my car and make that trip.

Don't think this place was really worth the wait. We got the fried chicken wings and they were nice and crispy and seemed to be tossed in a slightly spicy sweet and sour sauce. It was good but I feel like I can get the same level of crispiness from another Chinese restaurant and the sauce isn't amazing. Our meal wasn't very cheap either. If I come all the way from the south bay to get Chinese food in SF I would expect cheap prices. This restaurant would be 4 stars if it was not over hyped and had a shorter line.

I made a pit-stop here just to try their chicken wings for the first time, and I must say it was WELL WORTH the stop. ?Apparently the yogurt shop next door also sells the Dry Fried Chicken Wings freshly made (I assume they're owned by the same people and they just go to the kitchen to tell them to make a new batch), so that's where i got my dozen or so wings. ?I actually wasn't expecting that many wings for the $10 I paid since most specialty wings places usually cost at least a dollar per wing. ? They came out smoking hot (wow, my mouth is salivating right now), and that first wing was incredible. ?The crunch of the fried skin and the wonderful tangy/spicy sauce was a burst of delicious flavor in my mouth, and the chicken itself was moist and juicy. ? These are arguably the best wings I've ever had, and I'll want to get them pretty much every time I go back to SF now...

Wow I have never seen a more diverse authentic chinese restuarant! Look at the crowd! Seems everyone can all agree their food is top notch, especially the dry fried chicken wings. Enter the door. To the right , on the wall, is a list. Write your name down. They usually split the board in 2, because yes there will be THAT many names! Expect a 40 min to an hour wait. Sometimes when standing outside I cant hear the person calling out the names ..strange. Service is quick and water is constantly filled. Wait staff knows perfect english.Thumbs up Prices of chinese dishes is higher than a typical chinese restaurant, but the taste is good! beef & onions ~ $10. You get a ton of pieces of the chicken wings, anticipate leftovers if youre coming in as just 2 people. Leftovers from here make me happy!

Look for good ol' comfort food? There's nothing like tripple-fried chicken wings smothered with sweet and tangy sauce. They serve it up in a plate of about 12 wings. You will be glad ?you are alive! How about calamari fried in a similar fashion, then served over white rice? I'm sure you're drooling already! I've been here 3 times but enjoyed every moment of it. Although it gets really crowded, the staff was nice and the food was served on time. Although, you should consider standing up to get their attention since they're always rushing around. Their other, healthier, alternatives were just as good. Like their stir-fried pea shoots or pork potstickers. Very authentic chinese flavors. But hey, why eat healthy when you can have tripple-fried chicken?? (I'm not being sarcastic!)

This place has turned out to be one of my favorite Chinese places in San Francisco, for it's prices and great food. We had a dinner for four people last night for about $33. My new favorite there is the black bean sauce over homeade noodles. YUUUM #6 I will testify that YES the chicken is awesome. I prefer the one with the wet sauce. The fact that Chinese people love this restaurant should be a BIG FAT CLUE that the chicken is HELLA good.

Have been going to this restaurant since it was in a small hole on the western side of Irving, beyond 19th Avenue. We used to call it our favorite for home-style cooking and authentic taste. Well, today, after a Sunday lunch, I am not so sure. We waited for over 40 minutes to be finally seated at 2:30 pm! Crowds were waiting and the air was sticky... Chuck, one of the owner's sons, "served" us in a less than friendly way, probably exhausted from the onslaught of more and more people. Each time he brought a dish, he slid-dropped in our table, without a smile or word. After I complained about the Fried Dried Beef being to cold, soggy and watery, he became visibly annoyed asking me why we ate half of it if we did not like it. A lengthy discussion followed that should never had been happening, and defied any notion of customer service. Who is the customer to tell that the dish was not the usual quality? He was one example of over-worked guy. With all understanding, I requested him to take the beef back, and to provide us with a new one that was hot and fresh. He came back and slid the replacement on our table - something that could be called fried Wonton skins, or deep-fried batter with beef jerky. The revenge of a tired, worn-out server in a restaurant that may now be a victim of its own success and its popularity-there was still a line for lunch long after 3 pm-changing to become a disappointing "feed the masses!" The dumpling we had were hum-ho, but the hot sour soup excellent. Green beans fresh, and good. Stick to the fried chicken wings, and expect a looooong wait followed by a meal with others waiting and eyeing when you'll be finished with your dishes and pay. High turn-over is the key here, with the "Lao-ban" watching the wait staff from a chair. The Chinese have a saying: "It take one small mouse dropping to spoil a whole pot of congee" - well, that was their mouse poop today! It will be a good while before we go back there again...

I've only been here twice, but that's all it takes to write a good review about one of their most famous dishes; the spicy chicken wings in thick sauce. I've always seen big crowds of people outside this place and wondered what the big deal was about. So one day my family and I went inside and ordered the usual Chinese food plus the famous chicken wings. I was excited because it said it was spicy and I love spicy food. When the dishes came out, I thought the food wasn't too bad, it was pretty good. However, the wings were amazing! They were spicy and the sauce was delicious. I couldn't eat enough of them. They were hot, juicy, and had a little bit of a crunch on the skin. If you decide to come here, don't miss out on the wings. You have to try them.

Definitely not over hyped. I took one bite and was in food heaven. Granted, I was famished after a 7 mile hike but the sauce...oh the sauce...they must put crack in it because I'm still thinking about it. The other dishes I had were mediocre -- garlic chicken (barely any chicken) and the seafood combination with squid, scallops and shrimp. The seafood was super bland. But back to the chicken...the sauce was so good, after I finished the chicken, I scooped up the sauce and ate it with my rice. Oh, and brownie points for the free kimchee! The servers were also really nice and polite despite the large crowds.

5 stars for their dry chicken wings!!!! BEST chicken wings ?and one of the best things I've ever tasted. It's just soooo good. I'm pretty sure everyone in the restaurant orders them because they are freakin' delicious. It's fried, cooked right, and the sauce is just amazing. The dumplings are really good too. They come in a plate of 12 little dumplings and everything from the wrapping to the stuffing inside is made right. Dipping it in soy sauce and vinegar make them more delicious. I also ate the potstickers, which I thought were alright. Nothin' like I haven't tasted before, but still good. I do like how thick the ?wrapping was. We also order the mu shu (I forgot which kind we got) and that was pretty good. It's always messy to eat, but it's fun. Like a little Chinese burrito. I tried some of the spicy seafood noodles and it was for sure spicy, but probably because I can't handle spiciness very well. I probably wouldn't order the noodles again because they weren't great. I rather order something else like... CHICKEN WANGS! Like seriously. Go eat them if you haven't already. The restaurant itself isn't very big and the wait is always long especially during dinner time. I came here at 2ish in the afternoon on a Thursday for lunch and the wait wasn't bad. Our food came pretty quickly too. The service was good. The lady who took our order was nice. As for the sanitation, the place is fairly clean. The bathroom was clean. One thing to look out for when coming here is the parking. It can be a real hassle, especially during dinner time. But that's the case for all of Irving. Oh well, for all the good Chinese food you'll be eating, it's a good thing to walk a few blocks to your car. You must check this place out, and I must come back here again.

Darn you San Tung. I thought I nicked my meat eating habits once and for all, but your chicken wings were too enticing. I couldn't resist the crisp skin, the sweet, slightly spicy glaze. I had a minor tummy ache as a result of this fix I'm afraid. Back in high school I would seriously drive all the way to sunset 2-3 times a week after school with friends and eat these wings...(we weren't from the city either). We'd also order the Dry black Bean Sauce Noodles, Noodles with Peanut Sauce, and Beef Soup Noodles at times, but for the most part, we were there for their wings. Now my bf is hooked and I'm doomed. DOOMED!

Came here on a Saturday Night with my family (total 9 people.) There was a ridiculous amount of people waiting... but luckily we know a person that work there and told him what time we were going to be there... but we still had to wait 10-15 minutes before we got seated. I think the food here is really good. I really liked their fried potstickers(they are hugeee) and everyone loves the dry fried chicken wings (we had three orders.) I also tried their hot & sour soup... but it wasn't really spicy... so we had to add pepper in ourselves. I also had the Number 7 Black Noodle, which is beef, shrimp, and calamari. The noodle was good, but the sauce did not have enough flavor.... ? Overall, this place is pretty good. Prices are really reasonable too.

When you first sit down, you'll notice a plate half filled with kim chi. It's ok, it's not leftover from the last group, it just looks like that. Go ahead and try some, be warned, it is extremely spicy. It's not for those with weak heart. We ordered some dumplings, a veggie dish (bamboo shoots, beans, and mushrooms), and that crispy chicken that everyone was raving about. The dumplings were good, I just wished it came with a sweet dumpling sauce or some red vinegar sauce. The table has all kinds of sauce, but nothing for the dumplings. The veggie dish felt like it was half empty, but it was good. We made sure that plate was cleared before leaving. I don't get the chicken dish. Didn't taste too authentic. Not sure if its a fushion of Chinese /Korean dish (noticed the Korean characters in the front). It was tasty, but felt like it was more of an dish targeted toward the ?American taste.

Solid "authentic" Chinese food! ? Everyone talks about the wings, but we thought the real stars here were the dumplings (esp. the pork). ?Basically you eat the dumplings and you're like "oh THIS is what they're supposed to taste like" and you regret every other crappy dumpling you've ever eaten. Wings are good too, but I think I might like them better at Capital or SO, where they're a little less sweet (although Sun Tung wins on crunch factor). The noodles dishes we tried were good, maybe not salty enough (spicy peanut and black bean). ?The string beans were actually really delicious and perfectly cooked. Will definitely hit this place up again whenever the HK in-laws are in town!

BOMB BOMB BOMB!!!! Think about your typical Chinese restaurant and now times it by 359038657653! Every dish we had was DELICIOUS!!...I don't quite rem the names of the dishes because my friends ordered everything but I think we had the Black Bean Noodle and Fried Chicken (perfect crispiness and yummy sauce)....soup and another dish also....they were both so good I wish I can remember the name. Best part was it was hella cheap!! 4 dishes for around $30!

I don't want to sound redundant, but their chicken wings is the shizzle! It's so ridiculously good that I dream of eating San Tung chicken wings at night. It's spicy and sweet, so crunchy and soooo juicy. Let the sauce drip from your mouth cause you will lick that ish back up to avoid wasting some finger lickin' good sauce!! The Eggs and I tear it up when it comes to San Tung chicken wangs. I'm drooling as I'm writing this because I'm picturing myself eating them wangs. San-Tung will always be my favorite. I don't care if I have to wait in line for hours. I will wait for it. (I'm still taking a star off lol) Other recommendations: Dumpings Seafood black bean noodles Potstickers

I have been to San Tung's more times to count than the number of fingers and toes I have, yes I still have 10 fingers and 10 toes. Time after time, my experience here has been great, minus the minor hiccup of waiting but it's part of the whole San Tung experience. The main dishes we get here are the Potstickers (fried), Spicy Combo, and Dry Fried Chicken Wings! This combo has never failed in filling our stomach for dinner, lunch, and nursing a hangover! The potstickers are oil slick and super crisp and super big, not the small Ling Ling potstickers (they're good too) you get at Costco. The Spicy Combo Noodle is delicious with seafood and oodles of noodles! The Dry Fried Chicken Wings are the must get dish here, you will hardly ever see any patrons dine without this dish. It is a given that everyone orders this dish (except maybe vegetarians). The wings are crispy, spicy, sweet and just DELICIOUS! You will lick your fingers like no tomorrow once you get your hands on these things. This dish is often imitated but never have I had chicken wings that compare to the wings that San Tung's churn out. Parking can be difficult but if you don't mind walking a bit you can get parking in the more residential areas. The wait can also be quite terrible but if you visit at odd hours you can usually get a table. Walk if not RUN, to San Tung's, the 1950+ reviews can't be wrong.

Hungover from an amazing thanksgiving pigout in Napa, I was more than depressed at my culinary prospects. ?Which just goes to show how good this place is. ? The dry fried chicken wings are freaking amazing. ?Not dry though, just so we're clear, but perfectly moist, crispy, and sauced with a sweet but spicy goo. ?yummmm. ?I could eat a plate of these by myself. ?Comes with wings and legs. The veggies, garlic eggplant and green beans, are also really good. ?FResh and tasty, though be advised that at $8 per plate, very pricey. ?The shrimp and leek dumplings I remember thinking were okay, but since for the life of me I can't remember the taste, we'll chalk it up to not good, not bad, but entirely forgettable. The not so great/wouldn't order again: ?combo seafood noodle soup and seafood black bean sauce noodles. The moo shoo here looked amazing so next time, I would definitely get it. Always a wait, though never long. ?As you walk in, head straight right for the board and put your name on it. ?Pen on ledge to the left. ?Don't dither around or else someone else will just cut!

So this place has made it on the list of 100 things to try in San Francisco before I die, but so has 99 other things. ?But my friend has been recommending this place for the longest time...so we went. The verdict? ?The chickens wings are BOMB! ?I also enjoyed the potstickers here, but other than the chicken wings...did I mention they were BOMB!...this place didn't stand out that much. ? I've heard this place gets busy, but I came at an off time so I didn't have to worry about that. ?Try the wings...and then dip everything you ordered in the sauce as well.

the only decent dish is the shrimp and chives dumpling. If you want super americanized chinese food, this would be the joint. they even put sugar in pan-fried string beans! Is this suppose to be a dessert dish? the pan fried potstickers have super thick skin with pork filling that's hard to swallow. I couldn't even finish 1/2 of potsticker. the owner of the restaurant admits that people love the chicken wings because they put a lot of sugar in the dish. moms beware -- diabetes kids to come if kids are raised on this food...

Delicious!! ?(I would give it a 4.5) The food here is amazing!! Definitely worth the 30+ minute wait (for a table of 5). ?We went on a Thursday night, and it was busy! ?Since they are so busy, service tends to be a slower/less attentive, but the food is flavorful and makes up for it! ?The shrimp with lobster sauce was my favorite! ?The fried chicken wings (both wet and dry) were also great! The glaze is a nice balance of garlic with a touch of sweetness. ?I also enjoyed the simple but welcoming and lively atmosphere. Note: parking can be a bit challenging, but is possible, especially if you are willing to walk. ?Also, there's not much waiting space inside (and it can be cold outside!)

i work down the street and my coworkers brought me here calling it "across the street" becaue they use to go to the place across the street but then found this place. since they don't want to get hated on wed,(it's closed) when they go back across the street the place earned an amazing code name, across the street. Since then I refuse to learn its name and simple refer to it as "across the street." and across the street is fucking good. Beef and black mushrooms is hella dope, but as many have said the fried chicken is fucking amazing. there is a reason I see tour buses drop off assloads of tourist here. The food is fucking retarded, I would never show up at noon cause the wait is a bitch but fuck man go early and you can wreck shop, I will ride for this place no matter what, these motherfuckers can hook it up I wrote this when I was drunk but so what, it's better than fuck!

They should rename San Tung Yummy Yummy because man...it feels ilke they sprinkle crack on their chicken wings and other great specialty items...its sooo addicting! Its "Korean Style Chinese Food" and some of my favs besides the chicken are the dumplings, green beans, deep fried squid (sauce on the side), cherry pork, heck yeah..i'll say it..the mushu too! Some advice...they have a dry erase board in the back to sign your name in and the lines move pretty fast.

Arrived. They told us 15 minute wait. It ended up taking 45 minutes. 15 minutes my ass. But then we proceeded to have some of the best northern style Chinese food I've had in a minute. If you haven't tried hand pulled noodles, they are a specialty of northern Chinese cuisine. ? The wet fried chicken was really good, but a bit sweet and not something you can eat a whole plate of. I will definitely be going back, but my tolerance for waiting was really tested last night after a long day of work and driving 40 minutes to get there from Candlestick Point. My review is not going to convince any of you to try this place. The damn 400+ reviews will! So this review is really just for me to kill time at work. Mission accomplished.

Located near in the heart of Sunset, parking usually is slightly tough and during dinner time, you can expect a line of eager people. There is a marker board to put your name and # of party on so don't forget otherwise you'll never get a seat. Their fried garlic chicken wings are a must (listed as one of the 100 must-eats in SF). EVERYONE gets that plate at San Tung - as you can tell when you see that every table gets at least one plate. The sauce is a house sauce that is sweet and sticky and Yummy! Also, the black bean sauce noodles are perfection; saucy, sweet, salty, yum. I've also had their won ton soup which was better than most won ton soups I've had. There was no msg used and the flavor was quite different from your standard msg-infused won ton soups. Also, the won tons were generous in shrimp and cooked just right. I'm looking forward to trying more of their dishes since it's so close. If there's a line of people out the door, you know the food must be good!!!

After all these years I still get excited to go eat at San Tung. ?When my friend/competitor JASON GEE ( Farmer's Insurance) haha suggested to eat there, I was all for it. These are my recoomendations: 1) Kim Chee ( must soak w more vinegar) 2) Make a side sauce with soysauce, vinegar, hot oil, and of course hot sauce 3) Potstickers 4) Shrimp and leek dumplings 5) Dried chicken wings 6) Blackbean sauce noodles 7) Dried stringbeans Jason Gee likes the mushu pork!

Like everyone else, I LOVE LOVE LOVE their chicken wings!! ?Crispy, sweet, with a little bit of a kick. ?I can go through so many wings it's dangerous! ?The drive and wait is worth it simply for these wings!! And like everyone else has mentioned, the ja jang myun (black bean noodles) and shrimp and chive dumplings are the staples there. ?The ja jang myun isn't necessarily the best I've ever had but it's pretty good and if you're having the craving for it, it hits the spot. ?I also really like the dumplings. ?It's a healthy alternative to the fried kinds. ?I've had their fried dumplings which are the Chinese style with the thick wrapper. ?I think both are good but I prefer the steamed dumplings. I've also tried their tang soo yuk (deep fried sweet and sour beef). ?This dish is also a classic Chinese-Korean dish which I thought was ok.

This place is a bit overrated IMO. ?Yes, the wings are good, but not the best. ?The dry wings are misleading because they aren't really dry; they have a thin coating of the sweet/spicy sauce. ?The wet wings just have a thicker sauce although the wet wings tasted better to me. They offer actual wings or chicken chunks... Get the wings. They're messier, but they taste so much better! Their shrimp and leek dumplings are delicious and I could have eaten that for dinner. haha I also liked the hot and sour soup. A Medium size fed 7 people with no left overs or second helpings... They didn't give much rice for 7 people, ?sad. ?I didn't enjoy the noodle dish we had... I think it was black bean noodles... Didn't taste right to me. Service is typical Chinese restaurant service: semi-attentive but not polite... ahhaha that's in my experience... I wouldn't wait 45 minutes for a table; not worth that.. But if you're looking for a cheaper dining option and like chicken, check this place out. Parking may be tough during busy nights so be prepared to drop someone off to write your name on the whiteboard waiting list. PROS: decent chicken, good hot and sour soup, awesome shrimp and leek dumplings! CONS: didn't give enough rice, parking may be tough (METERS take dollar coins!)

So for some reason, you came across this review among the million other reviews for San Tung and you're wondering, what do I order if I've never been? Here's my take on what a novice should try. ?No lemon chicken or mushu pork, this is San Tung which means "not Panda Express" in Cantonese. Dry Fried Chicken (dry not wet) Black Bean Sauce Noodle (dry or wet, you decide) Sweet and Sour Beef (brown sauce) Dry Fried Flounder Fillet and maybe a side order of steamed rice. They have excellent soups and great seafood dishes, but these are the staple items. ?Most people say they have "died and gone to heaven." ?If you're like me and eat here too often, you're in heaven and you'll probably die soon. ?Bring a defibrillator.

Came back with the family the other night as I've been craving the fried chicken wings ever since I first tried them a month ago. My mom's co-worker had informed her that the chef left to another restaurant so the whole drive other there I was hoping that the food was still the same. We ordered two orders of the potstickers, one of the fried chicken wings, pork dumplings, string beans, szechuan tea smoked duck, cold noodles, and the five spice beef soup noodles. The potstickers which I loved last time were soggy on the bottom and definitely didn't have the same flavor. The pork dumplings were still good and luckily the fried chicken wings were just as I remembered them...finger-licking good! I also liked the cold noodles, had some peanut flavor and it was definitely a lot better than the peanut sauce noodles that I tried a little of last time. The wait staff here is a little rude and forgetful. I don't know remember how many times I had to ask for a Sprite. Other than that, the chicken wings are worth the trip, even if you don't try anything else.

Oh my bajeebus. Their wings. They are freaking delicious. Crispy, sweet and salty coating, moist meat. Sooo good. I would seriously just order a plate for myself. And some rice and that would be a great meal. Their dumplings are pretty delish too. Minus one star because they aren't really authentic. I noticed in their Dan Dan Mein that they use mushrooms that are not in Chinese dishes. So come here for the wings. And some of their other stuff. Minus one star because it was a tad pricey for me. But it's not bad, like 10 bucks a person. Also, this place is cracking at all hours so you're gonna have to wait.

We came here yesterday at 12:30pm (which was more like 1:30pm b/c we just changed our clocks an hour back the night before) in the pouring rain and yet there was still a 40 minute wait. ?Baffling, but a testament to how good this place is. ? San Tung has the best chicken wings in SF, period. ?The original dry fried chicken wings are the gods' gift to mortals. ?They are the perfect blend of textures and flavors: crispy on the outside and incredibly tender inside, sticky, sweet, salty, sour, and garlicky. ?They're the ideal size for devouring the wings efficiently without getting sauce all over your face. The chicken mu shu was surprisingly good as well. ?I'm a fan. ?I want to try pork next time. ?=) The black bean noodles and steamed dumplings were rather unimpressive and begging to be seasoned. ?Not worth the calorie intake.

The food is fantastic. Of course, everyone comes here for the dry fried chicken wings, but don't miss out on the black bean noodles or the dry fried beef! What I like about the beef is that you don't have to deal with bones. The reason San Tung gets four stars is because the wait is ALWAYS redonkulous! Come here with friends you can chat with or a book/smartphone because there is no doubt you'll have to wait at least 30 min or more. IDEA! If you're going out to eat with someone you have a crush on, bring them here. It'll make your date even longer since you have to wait. Also, check out SO on 8th and Bryant. The owners are the same, and the food is pretty much the same too!

This review is only for the dry fried chicken wings.They come out piping hot and covered in their sticky gooey sauce. It's a perfect combination of sweet and spicy. ?These are the best chicken wings I've had in SF and maybe ever. Other solid wings include the old pro in Palo Alto. I don't love cluck U/university chicken/smoke eaters in San Jose/Santa Clara. I've been there many times, but I'll actually crave San Tung when someone talks about it. We can never go in and get one order of wings! How has it taken me so long to review the wings here The rest of the food is average at best.

WOW! Dry Fried Chicken Wings ROCK! I have never tasted anything like it. Its crunchy and the sauce covers the wings perfectly. Its like candied chicken wings. Yeah, I know that sounds weird, but when you're eating it you will invariably think that and you will understand. Trust me get an order of this for yourself, because sharing this is tough, unless you want to get in a fight with whoever you are eating with. I ordered their cold noodles and dumplings, but honestly everything else they have pales in comparison to how well they make the chicken wings. I come here on a mission to destroy 1, 2, maybe 3 plates of Dry Fried Chicken Wings! Order it, you can thank me later. Enjoy!

i wanted to see what all the hype was about with the chicken wings and now i get it...even my mom who is never a fan of fried chicken wings or any type of take out chinese food LOVES their wings :) I also had the dry fried string beans which was salty but also very good...the sauce taste like the chicken wings sauce i've also had the sweet and sour beef with brown sauce and that was really good and tasty as well. my dad who also never likes sweet & sour anything also is a fan of this dish. They only lose 1 star b/c this place is more expensive then your typical Chinese food, but I am definitely a fan :)

Of course the dried fried wings and black bean sauce noodles are required if you go here, and pretty much everyone already knows that. In addition to those awesome dishes, I'd recommend the mushu vegetables that comes with some sort of egg wrap. It's super flavorful and adds a nice contrast to the black bean sauce noodles. Oh and BTW, if you order all three items mentioned above, then you will need at least 3 very hungry people to finish it. Again, the line can be long so I would recommend getting there a little early for a bigger group.

I have to say I am a bit biases because I have been going to San Tung since they were at 23 and 24th and Irving. Honestly their food was way better then when they were competing for business with Golden City. Food is still good. Chicken Wing are great. I love all their noodle dishes. Huge tip. If you are it's if chow mein make sure u order it with their Home made noodle and I love it spicy. The dumpling are the best still. ?I have only one grip as I went today and they had 2 servers that pissed me off. Kept on ignoring us and dropped the food and ran when I was trying to ask for something. They need some more training guys!

CROWDED NORTHERN CHINESE WITH FAMOUS CHICKEN WINGS We arrived early to avoid the crowds but still had to share a table. ?The server threw down a plate of spicy kim chee and two menus. ?I appreciated that the menu gave a detailed description of each dish. ?We ordered the following: Original Dry-Fried Chicken Wings-This dish lived up to the hype! ?The chicken wings are deep fried and covered with the most addictive salty, spicy, and sweet sauce laced with ginger, garlic, and red peppers. Dry Black Bean Sauce Noodles-Hand-pulled noodles covered with a dark black bean sauce with shrimp, calamari, scallops, and sliced cucumber on top. ?I mixed and mixed the noodles to spread the sauce around. ?The sauce was a little bland and benefited from the addition of hot sauce. The food arrived quickly and the service was efficient. ?I am looking forward to coming back to try the dumplings and cherry pork.

On the first few bites of everything raved about by Yelpers here, I was positively dumbfounded as to why people could possibly be crazy for this food. ?It was heavy, sodden and throat-woundingly sweet. ?Then it dawned on me. ?It was throat-woundingly-sweet. ?Who but Americans raised on a steady diet of sugar since birth could enjoy this food. ?All those Yelpers who talk about "don't know what stuff they put in here but it's like crack"? ?Well, it is crack. ?Or at least it's white powder like crack and as addictive as crack. ?It's SUGAR, people. ?Get a grip and grow your tastebuds up a bit. ?Wait around until the restaurant closes and check out what the waitstaff are eating for their supper. ?It ain't that sugar-infused s*** they been feeding you all night.

OMG the fried chicken are sooooo good! They need to open one in San Jose!!! I have been craving for their food everyday since I tried it for the first time which sucks because I don't live in the city. I ordered string beans, rice and the fried chicken. ?They serve a small plate of Kimchi at each table and everything is just so damn good!!!

On a Saturday night, we show up around 6 and wait until 7:30 before getting seated. 90-minute wait? For a fancy schmancy Italian restaurant with pasta hand-made to order, getting toasted on wine in the meantime, fine. For short-order Chinese food and crispy chicken wings, no way. To be fair, there are some things you get here that you don't get at your usual Sunset Chinese restaurant: * A whiteboard near the door to write your name and party. * A pretty clean place to eat. No complaints. * Crispy sweet chicken wings. Not worth 90 minutes, but they are good. If you happen to be stuck waiting, you while away the time staring at the empty Golden Rice Bowl "Chinese Bistro" across the street, speculating on what the food is like inside.

I didn't give this place 5 stars because I'm only basing it on my first visit. Anyways, all I can remember about this place is that my friends and I ordered the dry fried chicken. It was delicious! the texture is like orange chicken from your typical chinese restaurants or panda express, but with some kind of korean sauce. Prices were cheap during lunch time too. I heard it's packed on Sunday mornings or afternoons, where there's families waiting outside so probably not a good idea to go on Sunday's. And again, I am really big on service (it's like the 3rd Rock from the Sun episode; the better the service, the higher the tip and vice versa), yes I know almost all Chinese restaurants have terrible service, but at least they should refill my water when they see the glass is empty! but that was the only thing, everything else was cool, waiter took our order really fast and it felt like a minute went by and our food was out. Totally awesome!

Not the most authentic food but nevertheless, very good ... especially the chicken wings ... yes, it's as good as everyone says it is! The service at the restaurant is a lot better than the service, or lack thereof, over the telephone, and when ordering a take-out, be sure to give them a tel. no. that you can remember, as they'll grill you on it when you pick up your food.

Love their Dry Fried Chicken! I have tried it in both "Wings" and "Diced" form. Both forms are equally amazing. I find that you get more chicken when you order this specialty in "diced" form. There's also no bones to worry about and you won't have messy fingers! Their dumplings are pretty good. They have shrimp and leek, as well as pork dumplings. I liked both of them. I also tried their black bean noodles and that was just ok. It was pretty bland to me. My sister said it tasted like soap. How she knows what soap even tastes like... I have no idea. They also offer complimentary kimchi while you wait for your food. The kimchi in your mouth starts off sweet and then transforms into something spicy.

What are you supposed to say in a review that 1500+ other reviewers haven't covered? The waiting area could be bigger? This place has a ridiculous wait. I mean totally ridiculous. We went on a Saturday night at 6:45, put our names down, went down the street to a bar and had a couple drinks, walked back, and still waited another 25 mins. That's a 1.5 hr wait. ? However, once you get seated, you realize why you waited as long as you did. We ordered the fried chicken wings, noodles with black bean sauce, and green beans. The noodles and green beans were solid, but the fried chicken wings were incredible. Crispy skin cooked just right, with an amazing sauce. Only thing I would say is that each dish was super flavorful, almost to the point where I wanted something plain to cancel the other flavors out. Next time, I'll probably get wings with plain white rice, or just get rice on top of all this stuff as a palette cleanser or something. Not a knock on the restaurant, more so a testament to how flavorful everything was.

4.5 Stars What can I say about San Tung that has not already been said. I am concurring with all other 4 and 5 star reviews. If you are a San Tung virgin: try the 1. DRY chicken wings (trust me, I have tried both, it is crispier) 2. Steam dumplings Everything else is OK - good, depending on your taste/cravings. The line can get gnarly. The best time to go on the weekend is 2-5 pm. I am going to add these chickens wings to the top 10 "last meals I ever eat." If I eat here enough, it might be my last meal. I'll drop dead at the table with my face buried in a plate of sauce. So be it, I am going out in a blaze of food glory. YUMMMMM!!! (pounding my keyboard as I type YUMMMMM)

All I know is that any time I'm in ?SF, I'll be at San Tung's for some DRY FRIED chicken wings and the VEGETABLE MUSHU Son! Yeah I know what you're thinking. ?Chicken wings from an Asian restaurant? ?Must taste like some soy saucey crap! ?But this is far from the truth! Just thinking about those how those wings are perfectly fried, perfectly seasoned, and perfectly drenched in sweet and spicy sauce makes me wanna commit a crime! ?Ugh!!!

My co-worked wouldn't shut up about this place so I took some buddies here one Friday night in hopes of some decent chinese food, which, surprisingly, can be hard to find in this city. * The wait was ridiculous and I'm pretty sure some jerkface put his name above ours on the self-serve white-board queue (bad idea) but OH JESUS THE CHICKEN WINGS. I guess I will reiterate what others (300+) have written below, but just eat them. Yes, yes, I know, I hate going along with the crowd and I especially dislike agreeing with other people, but do it, stupid jerkface. I was pretty ready to hate them so I ate everything else first: black bean sauce noodles (amazing but overwhelming), something curry (decent) and vegetarian Buddhist delight (pretty standardly tasteless). I was damn full; I had unbuttoned my pants. At this point chicken wings made by the Virgin Mary herself would have tasted like cardboard, but, expecting nothing, I tried the San Tung special anyway. THEY WERE SOO GOOD. So we are happily munching on a large plate of wings when I catch sight of a guy at the table behind us pouring his buddies large teacups full of sake. They were acting like a bunch of drunken fools so it was hard to miss. Then I noticed that man, standing at the table, had something in his right hand. It was wooden and hard and he was waving it about like a wand. I said to my friends "That guy is holding a wooden dildo," which is, I guess to my friends, nothing to write home about. Nobody said anything either because they didn't believe me or they didn't care, so, like I always do when people ignore me, I repeated myself. "No, guys, really, that man is holding a wooden penis." No response. At this point the man at the table notices me staring at him, grabs four glasses from the shelf behind him and brings them over to our table, placing one glass in front of each of us and filling each to the brim with cold sake. "Cheers!" he nearly shouted . "Wow, thanks," we say in perfect unison and raise our glasses to him and the table behind us. We drink. Just to be an a-hole, I ask "What's in your right pocket?" "Oh, this?" He pulls out the wooden dildo. We all start cracking up, nearly spilling our sake, and he points out that it is a bottle opener. My friend Kyl squeals "That's how mine works, too!" The guy waves it around a bit then drops it in my friend's plate. He laughs and walks into the kitchen. Then his friends at the table say he is the owner or manager or something. I f-ing love this place. * Ironically or not, I'm fairly sure this place is Korean owned after talked to a Korean friend, but I have no confirmation other than the kimchee.

2009/11/20 Ordered Pork Dumpling, Black bean sauce noodle and Dry spice chicken wing with tax and tips $28 (with hot tea). Its always crazy crowded on Friday night, though not as bad as usual (1 hour on average on the weekend), probably it has been raining. ?Parking is never easy, but got lucky and park just in front of the restaurants after waiting like 20 minutes. To all my American friend, never and never order things like sweet and sour something or some curry something. ?This is a restaurant where you can only order these menus I listed below since otherwise you have wasted time waiting to just order other regular "mediocre" chinese food. -Dried Fried Chicken Wings -Dried Fried String Beans -Shrimp and Leek Dumplings & Pork Dumplings -Steamed Potstickers -Black Bean Sauce with Noodle - -Peanut Noodle just my 2 cents

I usually stop by here to get the chicken wings. They are fantastic. I was recently introduced to the seafood noodle soup. The noodles are deliciously chewy and flavorful. This place is crowded at normal eating hours. Don't stray too far while waiting to be seated or your name might be erased from the dry erase waiting list.

San Tung deserves two ratings: (1) for their signature dishes; and (2) their regular dishes. (1) For their signature dishes (dry fried chicken wings, pan fried/steamed potstickers) this place deserves a big 5-star rating! ?Their chicken wings are hands down the best we've ever had. ?And if you like the sauce, instead of wings, you can get shrimp or fish instead. (2) For their other regular dishes, the place is at best an average chinese restaurant. This place also serves some Korean/Chinese fusion dishes. ?I have to say, their Jajangmyun (black bean sauce noodles) is below-average. ?Not even close to the good Korean/Chinese fusion places in LA and a place called San Wang in Japantown serves better Jajangmyun in SF. For those of you who don't like spicy foods - they bring out cabbage kimchi as an appetizer which is very spicy. ?We like it but some of our friends who aren't too keen on spicy have tried it and have had a difficult experience with it. Expect on average a long wait. ?Place your name on the white board and if you are with a smaller group, don't be surprised if you are sharing a table with strangers. Also note - they are closed every Wednesday. ?Don't want anyone craving the chicken wings on a Wednesday and you get disappointed when you get there. Overall a solid experience and if you get their signature dishes, absolutely worth dining at San Tung.

Ah, San Tung ... you remind me of Golden City on 24th and Irving, and rightfully so, since a lot of the staff from there seemingly had moved to here. ?My friends and I came from out of town and wanted cheap, filling, delicious food. ?This place is the best Chinese restaurant in the Bay Area. ?You don't come here for the decor, very plain. ?You just come here to wait to be seated then pig out. Almost a must to start off with the sizzling rice soup to warm up the belly. ?Then I must have my favs: black bean sauce noodles (ja-jang myun), best dry fried chicken (gom poon ge), and dumplings; all are already well reviewed. ?I also love the sweet & sour shrimp and seafood combination. ?This is the stuff you crave all the time, especially the 6 items I mentioned, because of all the different tastes where you'll be eating a bit of everything with equal satisfaction and end up undoing the button on your pants for more wiggle room. ?Everything comes out efficiently, so you'll be indulging in no time. service is good where things are to be efficient bathroom can be ok or messy parking is difficult, metered, prepare to circle around a lot

Every table had the dry fried chicken wings -- which isn't dry at all, but sticky sweet and oh so good. We also ordered the leek dumplings and the shrimp dumplings. Waaaay to much food for two people, but we took the leftovers to family, where it was devoured again. The restaurant was full of Chinese families, who know where to get the good stuff... We went Saturday for lunch after visiting the DeYoung, so there wasn't any wait at all.

Get the DRY chicken wings. ?That's the famous one, not the wet. ?The wet is like a gravy, whereas the dry is glazed already. ? I had the benefit of eating here at 9pm on a weeknight, and 6pm on a weekend. ?Both of these recent visits allowed me to dine in peace. ?It made my mushu pork, dumplings, and chicken wings THAT much more enjoyable. ? ?

You know it's a good sign when a "chinese" restaurant is packed with asians. ? On a usual night this place is not only packed, but there's a line of people trying to get into the small establishment. Food was pretty good. * kimchee was a little on the weak side. ?Not enough spice and not enough vinegar. ?But the tables have both of these, and after dousing the kimchee, it became very tasty. * vegetarian dumplings: probably the best thing we had that night. ?it's hard to make the dumpling skin well, and hard to make vegetarian dumpling filling taste that good. ?kudos to them! * fried chicken wings: This still seems like some bastardized version of buffalo wings, but I have to say that it does taste pretty good. ?It's very crispy and is covered with this sweet but surprisingly addictive sauce. ? Am looking forward to trying the handmade noodles at the next visit!

I was looking for the most popular Chinese restaurant in SF according to Yelpers...and San Tung it was! Came here for an early dinner, since fellow Yelpers reminded me that this was going to be a packed restaurant! After a short 15 minute wait, we were seated and ordered: Beef Stomach appetizer, Pot Stickers, Dried Fried String Beans, Beef Tendon Noodle Soup, House Special Fried Chicken Wings. As soon as I got a bite of the Beef Stomach, I almost went to heaven! It was SOOO GOOD! very tender, very flavorful! ...next time I'll add some hot sauce to make it even better! The Pot stickers were zesty hot, very meaty inside, and had a nice thick skin...super delicious! The Beef Tendon Noodle Soup was also really good. Soup was very flavorful. Noodles were excellent and beef tendon was very soft and flavorful. ...again next time I'll add in hot sauce! Dried fried String beans: Perfect! Slightly spicy, slightly fried before stir-fried, excellent dish! House Special Chicken Wings: They were very good. To me, they were like a hot and sour chicken w/ chicken wings instead... The chicken was good, but wasn't super fresh, super tender. still very good. All in all, excellent food. Service was typical Chinese restaurant...pretty mediocre to non-existent. I'll definitely come back in the future...:)

The food was sweet, salty, spicy . . . unremarkable, overall. But the service was attentive and surprisingly speedy. Excited by the overwhelmingly positive reviews, we went all out. My wife and I ordered the shrimp and chive dumplings, the "original dry" (but, confusingly, sopping wet) fried chicken wings, mu shu pork, and the spicy combination soup noodles. The waitress was aghast when she realized that the last dish to arrive - the famous chicken wings - were also for our table of two. Generally, the food was okay and the noodles were good. The rundown: (1) kimchi: (complimentary) good spiciness, but a bit too sweet; needs more garlic and a few more months of fermentation (2) shrimp & chive dumplings: a bit on the salty side and the filling was somewhat mushy with no palpable shrimp texture (3) mu shu pork: the filling consists of an average stir-fried pork and mushroom in a runny brown sauce; too runny to sit comfortably in the mu shu wrap (4) combination spicy soup noodles: yum - the highlight of the meal for me; the handmade noodles were tender with a little bounce just the way I like it and the broth was flavorful, spicy, and had a nice variety of solid ingredients (beef, cabbage, carrots, squid, mussels); I appreciate that the mussels were off the shell (5) dry chicken wings: I'm not sure what the big deal is; the wings tasted like a Chinese version of southern honey fried chicken wings, which could be good or bad depending on your palate - personally, I do not prefer sweetly-seasoned meat; I loved the texture of the chicken and the lightly battered skin, but I did not enjoy the sweet and spicy syrupy brown sauce drizzled over the wings Overall, I have had better Shan Dong cuisine at Shan Dong in Oakland (http://www.yelp.com/biz/…) and Palace Chef in Fremont (http://www.yelp.com/biz/…); but those places don't have the dry chicken wings, if that's what you're drawn to. NOTE: An unpleasant odor wafted around the table at which we were seated and the bathroom was not terribly clean; however, our table was clean.

Despite the long lines, this place is worth the wait. Not sure about the kimchi since it's a bit sweet and not quite the right taste, but this is one of the things I don't care for that I've tried so far. ?Maybe because I'm jaded by my family's radish kimchi. Dry fried chicken diced with that sauce.. so yummy! ?The pancakes with the mu shu pork are good but the pork filling is pretty bland, where the ja jjang myun is good and has the right amount of ja jjang sauce. ?The dumplings (chive and shrimp) are also solid --the pork ones are very average. ?They have these noodles that look similar to japchae (clearish brownish color) and are pretty good too, but it seems to be the same stir fry combo that comes with the mu shu pork filling (a bit disappointing and oddly soggy-ish). Overall, I'm sold on the chicken. ?Will definitely keep coming back for more of that.

I came here on a sunday afternoon. I was excited after hearing all this hype. Although the food is good, it is not great or anything that wowed me alot. Ate the dry fried chicken wings, dry black noodle sauce, pork dumplings and vegeterian dumplings. The dumplings were ok. But it was nothing amazing. The flavor was lacking. The chicken wings were great. Crispy and good flavor. Dry black noodle sauce was ok. It was good but nothing to be overwhelmed with. The place is solid but kind of pricey for me

It feels redundant to add to the nearly 2,000 reviews, but here goes anyway. The Dry Fried Chicken (and their other dishes) absolutely lives up to the hype. I've had good Chinese food -- a product of living in major metro centers most of my life. I've had bad Chinese food -- which is endemic to living in totally homogeneous places such as where I am now. San Tung is seriously some of the best Chinese food I've ever had the chance to eat. When everyone from Zagat to Top Chef throws their name behind this place, you really can't go wrong. And to top it off, their dishes are relatively inexpensive as well. When I think of the people who are satisfied with Panda Express, or even P.F. Chang's-level food, I can only sigh in disappointment. If only they had the opportunity to eat food as good as San Tung's. As noted, this place does get packed out. When we went, we walked right in and were seated immediately -- but that probably had more to do with the fact it was pouring rain, and it was also during off-hours (3pm). So be ready to wait if you're coming by. I've always dreamt of finding a place that has food this good. Now my next dream is to live somewhere much more convenient to San Francisco!

Gotta love this place, even with the wait. ? Came here with a party of 8 and we got the private room in the back. The service was great, though a bit slow. ?I'm not even sure how the waiters were in such a good mood considering there were a sea of folks waiting for their tables. ?The food was outstanding. ?The price was very reasonable for the amount of food. Tips: Make a reservation if you can (I think they require a minimum of 5 or 6) Must order the dry fried chicken wings and sizzling rice soup Be patient cause the wings are worth it

We got take out here because my friend swore by the dry fried chicken wings. ?He's been swearing by these things and talking them up for the past few years and we've never gone there until recently (we just moved to the City after years of just visiting him). Well, hot diggity, these things are pretty damn good. ?The green beans are smashing as well. ?You can read all the reviews, and they'll all say the same thing. ?Get the damn chicken wings or you'll regret it.

Darn. I didn't get to try to fried chicken because I read these reviews after the fact, but I have to say their Tangsuyook (deep fried pork in a sweet and sour sauce) is the best I've ever had. ?Their pork and leek dumplings were addicting. Their spicy noodle soup was very flavorful. Their black bean noodles were just okay. There weren't enough vegetables like zucchini and onions, but the noodles themselves were cooked well. The ladies who worked there had a huge pile of green beans on one of the tables, trimming them with their hands. ?I'm talking a mountain of green beans. I took a picture. I am still confused whether this is Chinese restaurant run by Koreans or a Chinese restaurant just with some Korean lettering on the outside and there's also Korean on the menu. When we were pronouncing some of the Chinese dishes in Korean, our waitress couldn't understand, so I'm guessing the latter. Or maybe the owner is Korean? Gosh I don't know.

Day 3 of MWLAWMBF: Whenever we would pass by this place, my boyfriend would comment that the fried chicken at the restaurant is amazing...EVERY SINGLE TIME. It's seriously a typical Chinese restaurant, one that I've been to a million times in my life. We were seated pretty quickly in the back room - although there were only 4 of us - my boyfriend, his 2 best friends and me. We ordered some random dishes that aren't really worth mentioning - veggies, a cold plate of meat (which by the way, was good) and some noodles. The only thing really worth mentioning was the friend chicken. It was pretty good, but really like any fried chicken, I can't eat too much of it. Diet remember? Overall, it was good I guess. Nothing amazing, nothing horrible either. Craving some authentic Chinese food? Come here.

Be prepared to wait in line and try to come early, if possible. There is a dry erase board near the entrance where you have to put your name and # in your party. My friends ordered the dry fried chicken wings, black bean noodles, and dumplings. Their wings are one of the BEST I'VE EVER had in my life. I strongly suggest to order a dozen or more. MSG? perhaps, but I don't care.

The wet chicken wings are the best Asian wings I've ever had! The potstickers were pretty good too, but I might try something else next time. The noodles were whatever (I got the ones with the scallops and shrimp in it).

Unfortunately I can't agree with the rest of the Yelp community and give San Tung glowing reviews. ?I was there a few days ago to have lunch with my father and brother and it was a disappointing experience for all of us, especially since we had all been there before and had enjoyed our meal. Though the service was a little slow (we never got refills on the water or tea) ?and the restaurant looked nice from a recent remodel, we were not that impressed with the food. ?We ordered mainly from the lunch menu - the famous dry-fried chicken wings (we ordered it wet), shrimp with lobster sauce, and the twice cooked pork. ?We were feeling like dumplings too, so we got the pork dumplings. ? The first thing to arrive was the soup that came with the lunch special, which was egg drop soup with tofu and mushrooms. ?The soup was tasty, though a little heavy on the garlic, which would also be a problem later on in the meal. ? The pork dumplings were next to arrive, which were disappointingly bland. ?We had to dunk them quite a bit in the self-made soy sauce/vinegar/hot oil mixture before they tasted okay. ?Even my father, who eats a reduced sodium diet, found them to be lacking. ?I appreciated the fact that the wrapper was hand-made but it was basically tasteless. ?The filling was a good mixture of pork, ginger, and cabbage, but again a little salt would have done wonders. The dry-fried chicken wings were good, but personally, I think that they're overly sweet. ?Though I could taste the five spice, I would have appreciated some additional heat to balance out the sweetness. ?The next entree, the shrimp with lobster sauce, was awful. ?The shrimp was fresh, but the sauce suffered from too much cornstarch and way too much garlic. ?A hint of garlic might have been nice, but the bits of garlic overwhelmed what should have been a delicate sauce. ?The last entree, the twice-cooked pork, came in a pool of oil. ?It was tasty, but the oil was too much and we didn't finish it. ?To add insult to injury, the steamed rice tasted old. Overall, we were a little sad that the meal just wasn't the exceptional one we had been expecting. ?Perhaps we should not have ordered from the lunch menu and instead gotten some of their specials, but I expect that a restaurant of San Tung's caliber would be able to do justice to ALL the dishes listed in their menu. ?I might be back to try other things on the menu if I was in the area and was able to get parking right away (rather than the twenty minutes we spent circling the block).

Delicious Chinese/Korean food! I love these kinds of restaurants, they always combine the best of both worlds. Pros: 1) Food comes out quickly! 2) Waiters are pretty friendly (at least, the one who was helping us the most, always had a smile on his face) 3) The wings - need I say more? The dry chicken wings are so delicious with their spicy, slightly sweet/tangy sauce, covered in garlic and red peppers. 4) The seafood noodles (I don't remember what the name of the dish is) was pretty tasty and spicy. 5) The kimchee is very spicy compared to other Korean/Chinese restaurants. Hot! Cons: 1) Very long wait, the place was so busy and so noisy. 2) There's a board you write your name on, and the waiters come and erase your name as you're seated, but then other people will come in and write their names above the next people in line, effectively cutting and making everyone wait twice as long! 3) The ja jyung myun is not very good. A bit dry and bland. 4) Parking can be tough if you're not lucky.

DRY FRIED CHICKEN WINGS. ?had it twice this weekend already. few chinese restaurants impress me and i rarely get the chinese food urge, but i'd come back here in a heartbeat. SPINACH WITH GLASS NOODLE? ?i think that's what it was. ?enjoyed this as well. ?DUMPLINGS, i'm not usually a fan of, but they were good. ?DEEP FRIED FISH - not usually a fan either, but YUMM! ?GREEN BEANS and the PORK with cabbage/vegetables. ?Delicious. ?more please!!

3.5 After having the wings at SO, I kind of expected San Tung to be exactly like SO, especially since so many of the reviews talk about the chicken. But San Tung, atmosphere/decor wise is like any other chinese restaurant. I thought the food was alright, but not super special, but of course I was just there for the chicken. They have a dry and wet option, and we decided to get the dry ones. Their not really dry, but it was just the right amount of sauce on it for me. This place gets packed. We went for an early dinner, and people were waiting out the door as we were eating. And it was pretty obvious that the staff was rushing us out.

Best Chicken Wings ever. Wowsers. Holy Grail. These are some damn good chicken wings. Hot...crispy...WABAM OF IN YOUR FACE AWESOMENESS! How can "chicken wings" taste so good? They're probably not chicken wings but instead, some unknown animal the government has secretly kept away from us for the past decade and the sauce...most likely illegal. But Whatevers, as long as I don't get sick and it's damn good. What about everything else? The string beans were probably one of the best I've had (something in that sauce again!). The shrimp and leek dumplings were good but definitely not worth $1 a pop. We also ordered the peanut sauce noodles and the black bean sauce noodles. Both were overly salty and I've definitely tried better...from those bag of noodles. The wait on Mothers Day was Horrendous (every other day is the same). I basically put my name down at 6:00PM and drove home to get my parents. Came back at 7:15PM and still had to wait about 30 minutes. All for those Chicken Wings. Damn you illegal Chicken Wings...so GOOOD.

Got the potstickers and chow mein with handmade noodles. ?The noodles were nice and chewy but not too soft. ?However, I didn't think the chow mein seasoning itself was all that. The steamed potstickers with pork were delish. ?I love the chewy thick wrappers encasing the filling. You just don't get potstickers of that caliber down in LA. The restaurant seems to be busy all the time and the waitstaff is helpful. ?The wait for the food though is a bit long and that just may be a testament to how much love that place gets.

Best Chinese restaurant, hands down. ?First place I hit whenever I'm back in SF. ?The wings and dumplings are fine, but I strongly suggest trying other things on the menu. ?Dry fried shrimp, mapo tofu (extra spicy), hot braised flounder fillet (one of my favorites), ja jang myun (noodles in black bean sauce), jjambong (spicy, seafood noodle soup), beef with black mushrooms, the list goes on and on... For weekend lunch, go when it opens or wait until after 1:30, otherwise you'll be waiting forever. ?Dinner is crowded every night so go early. ?The service may not be the best, but it's quick!

No exaggeration: the fried green beans, dry fried chicken wings and the dumplings are freaking amazing. If you go at lunchtime you have a better chance of not having to wait.

Oh baby. That's what comes to mind when I think of San Tung. It's that good. They've basically made their reputation from the house chicken (we prefer the dried version, although it's not really dry in the typical sense of fried chicken). The noodles are also good. Only downside on the menu is they don't really have a great selection of vegetables - just the usual boring bok choy, broccoli, and mushrooms. No pea vine tips or ong choy. One star off for the incredible wait. By 5pm on any given day, it's already packed with a line of dinner hopefuls. Make sure the waiting list is numbered so no one cheats you out of your spot!

Deep-fried wet chicken wings, why do you live so far away from me! ?Unfortunately, I live in So-Cal, so I can't eat these wings as often as I crave them, but I always go to San Tung when I go up to SF (I'm not kidding either). ?Usually the only things we ever order are the wings, and moo shu chicken. ?Sometimes we mix it up with some potstickers or dumplings, or cold-sliced beef (I love cold-sliced beef, haha). ?But the wings and the moo shu are the star attraction of San Tung and its worth the wait (as you can tell by the throngs of people always waiting outside and inside the place). My only caveat, do not get the boneless wings! ?Being the lazy person that I am, I thought to myself, San Tung chicken wing goodness without the hassle of the bones? ?There has to be a catch right? ?Well there is. ?The boneless wings definitely are not as good, and it often has too much batter that you can't even taste the chicken. ?Stick with the original wings! Now I made myself crave the wings and moo shu but I'm 400 miles away ugh.

Really good chinese food! I meant to come here with some friends a while ago, but never had the chance until recently, when coincidentally, my friend had to drop something off at one of the restaurants across from it. If you come here, the DRY FRIED CHICKEN WINGS are a must. It comes in a small box, and its about $10, but they are soo good. The cashier was a bit rude, and told me that he had to check if there were any wings left in the back before they could make me any. I was like.. wth.. isn't this what you are known for?! You should have this on hand at all times! But he came back, didn't say anything, and in about 5 minutes, I had my wings! Yessssss nom nom time

LIKE CHICKEN CANDY (but watch out for roaches) It's a better than average Chinese restaurant but seriously, the only thing really outstanding on that entire menu is the dry fried chicken wings. They are well-worth the hype. They are not worth, however, a 30-60 minute wait. No way. And my wife and I have been eating there for two years - we literally live down the block - but we've had to stop after (drum roll please), she found a cockroach (dead, but still) in her food. Since then, we haven't been back. :( I miss the chicken wings but that said, I'm not really that sad about missing anything else. The thing is: San Tung always stood out to me because I find the Chinese food elsewhere in S.F. to be so consistently mediocre and predictable, anything that even had a hint of being a little better stood out and that's pretty much what San Tung represented.

I love the food. Everything I have tried, even things I have been nervous about, has gone above and beyond my expectations.

YUM YUM YUM! I love this place. Their dry fried chicken is delicious!! My friend and I come here with an empty stomach and leave full as all hell. Just between the two of us, we'll order potstickers, the black bean sauce noodles or the three deluxe spicy sauce noodles, dry fried chicken (diced), and the dried sauteed string beans or the eggplant. All that food between two females, we're able to finish. Come here early because there's always a long wait for dinner or if you have a large party, make a reservation. They don't take reservations for small parties. It's less crazy during lunch hour. But nonetheless, the wait is sooooo worth it!

When you want to eat Chinese, but not your typical Cantonese fare go to STCR. Chinese people eat here. Koreans eat here (they call it Chinese-Korean cuisine?!?!?). Lo Fan (people of European decent) eat here too. ? You'll see the lines and wait with the rest of the hungry masses. But the rewards is when you sit and have some dry chicken wings, dan dan mein, bean sprouts, shrimp and leek dumplings, and pot stickers you'll know why you came and will come again.

I am in love with this place. Great food but so-so service. Every time I go here, I always order the dry fried chicken wings which are to die for! Other great dishes include the sauteed string beans, five spice beef noodle soup, shrimp & leek dumplings, and pot stickers. There is always a long wait to eat here, so I suggest you to go early and beat the crowd. The place is on the smaller end and can be very cramped. If you're looking to get comfortable and receive great service, you're better off going somewhere else. If you're just looking for a great, cheap find, then absolutely try this place.

Dried fried chicken. No one else comes close. Enough said. Everything else. Also good but you can get it elsewhere. I try to come here for lunchtime, right before dinner though so I don't have to wait. Right before the masses begin showing up. Time it right or else you'll be waiting forever.

It took at least half an hour for my party of 6 people to finally get seated. When we were seated, we were served a plate of forgettable kimchi (it just tasted spicy without being pickled at all). We ordered dry fried wings, shrimp and leek dumplings, cold noodles, five spice beef noodles, and dry fried green beans. The dry fried wings were very good, and the dry fried green beans had a similar sweet salty favor. I thought the five spice beef noodles were kind of one-dimensional, but the beef in it was very tender and just fell apart in your mouth. The cold noodles were the best ?think. Chewy wheat noodles, tender shrimp, five spice beef, and blanched spinach draped in cold peanut dressing. Awesome meal, but good luck with the wait.

I'm just going to add onto the 4 star category, because this place deserves it. If you don't believe me, drive by this restaurant.. if you forgot the address that's fine, just look for the huge crowd standing outside and you've found it! To me San Tung's food is more upscale tasting than the average Chinese restaurant. As everyone mentioned their chicken wings are fantastic. I minused a star, because I hate scrambling for parking, always waiting in line, and sitting in cramped restaurants. I think it adds stress to my life!

San Tung will always be my go-to place whenever I go back home for break. I crave this on a weekly basis whenever I'm in the city. Parking is always a bitch, so some people park in the Andronico's parking lot and go home with fat tickets. Don't ever be stupid and do that. Anyway, if you come anyday cept Wednesday (cuz its closed) during peak lunchtime or dinner hours, expect to wait atleast 30-60 min for a table. As far as the service and cooks are, theres so many people that crave this place that theres going to be a wait no matter what. Sometimes when I drop by and theres a line, I just get take out and eat it at home (they usually prepare my food in 10 min or less) so if you dont wanna wait that ridiculous line, just get takeout and eat at home. Trust me, it'll still be good. I ALWAYS order: DRY FRIED CHICKEN WINGS - i always ask for all wings but they never seem to understand what all wings mean. Whatever, still the best kind of chicken ive ever had in my life. String beans - I dont like vegetables really so I order this to make myself feel better. It has a really good taste to it and compliments the chicken well. With rice of course. Cherry pork - this is delicious as well! Sometimes I think its too sweet but many people like it. ?Its crunchy and drenched in sauce - how much better can that get? Well, im sure the other reviews tell the same stuff but heres my 2 cents :)

I couldn't agree more with everyone on this post. ?I hadn't heard of this restaurant on Irving before until this past weekend. If you look at the photos on this post, you will notice the chicken is by far what makes this place famous. We ordered the dry chicken wings and the dry diced chicken, and we ordered the fish and some appetizers. Everything ordered was so delicious. I couldn't tell if I had such a tremendous appetite or that the food was out of this world An additional tip "Don't fear the fat man". As some have put in their posts, he's a great guy and funny as hell! ?I understand that some people are put off by his personality, but it is more for his amusement than anything else. ?My compadres and I had an incredibly brilliant time having drinks with him for the duration of our dinner. ?I cannot wait for my next visit.

we liked San Tung until our unpleasant experience 3 weeks ago and will never come back here again. we went on a sunday afternoon and waited for about 30 mins. it was not our first time there so the wait was not a problem to us at all we got our table around 2:30 and by the time, there was about 30% full of the restaurant (2 waiters were having their lunch break.), not busy at all we ordered some dumplings, shrimp fried rice and twice cooked pork. they served our dumplings within 5 mins which was really fast, but we waited other 2 dishes for over 30 mins. at the time i thought, maybe they forgot about it so i went to the cashier and asked a waiter about it. the waiter said, the boss is selecting. i was confused and asked, selecting what? the waiter answered: shrimps so i was speechless and returned to my seat 10 mins after, we finally have our shrimp fried rice and the table right next to us got their shrimp fried rice, too. (they got in less than 10 mins) I've been working in restauratns and understand people sometimes forget orders. If they tell me they forget about it, i would be ok. dont just give me a ridiculious excuse. especially, whoever knows how to cook fried rice would know how fast that dish can be done. at the end, we cancelled the twice cooked pork because we were not happy and ready to leave (yes, the dish came 50 mins when we asked for the check.) i didnt asked why it took so long, maybe the boss was catching and selecting pigs?

I didn't try the dry fried chicken wings that everyone raves about, since I don't eat poultry/red meat, so take that into consideration with this review. The food I had sucked ass. ?It barely passes with 2 stars just because it at least is edible. ?The garlic spinach had barely any spinach and was definitely not stir fried. ?They basically boiled it, tossed some garlic on top, and called it qingchaobocai. ?That's just disgraceful. ?Then there was the sweet and sour fish. ?WTF are they smoking, there was no flavor to the sauce, and the fish itself was bland. ?They themselves admitted it wasn't fresh. ?The shrimp was passable, but seriously, it was subpar. ?Barely any flavor. I must be ordering the wrong things (that's what I get for ordering seafood at a ShanDong style restaurant, although it didn't seem very ShanDong style either) or everyone else who reviewed this place must either be smoking crack or work for this place.

If you come here, then you will most likely have to wait for a while, but it doesn't matter to me. ?I never came here disappointed. ?So far, I've tried the tomato egg drop soup, hot and sour soup, dry fried chicken wings, potstickers, dry fried green beans, black bean noodles, fried rice and chow mein. ?Trust me on this, they have all been freaking DELICIOUS. ?I just love the flavor. ?I don't give a damn if it's loud as hell during the evening and I have to shout out loud to have a conversation with a friend. ?Please, go there now, give this place a try and fall madly in love.

The wait is a bitch, but that's only dinner time. ?Suck it up! Listen to me, and you can't go wrong. Dry Fried Chicken Wings are a *must*. ?It is much better than the diced kind. Diced= not as finger lickin good. Hot and Sour Soup: They have the best hot and sour soup ever, and they don't skimp out on the tofu. ?Super flavorful and spiced perfectly. ?A size small = 3 servings and a little extra. Braised String Beans: I'm really not a big fan of greens, but this is very good. ?Great garlicy flavor and crunch. ?You'll love it.

It is totally against my self interest to rate San Tung, as there is almost always a wait, and that is because they: a) make their own dumplings b) have these delicious chicken wings c) I think make their own mu shu pancakes d) even their vegetable fried rice is good. So don't go there!

3.5 Stars The wait was long cause we came during a peak time. We had soup (don't remember which), the leek and shrimp dumplings, and the wet chicken wings. Everything was decent and good. I'm not sure if the food would be something I would crave for though.

Never had any complaints about this place. ?Fast service, clean, always lively. ?Parking sucks, but so does every other restaurant on Irving. Like I'm sure everyone says, the dry-fried chicken wings are a must-try. ?But I must say the noodles are some of the freshest and best around. ?If you are looking for a hearty chinese noodle and won't settle for the typical, crappy chow mein or lo mein that comes straight out of the package, try this place. ?Potstickers are good, too. Try anything with black bean or garlic sauce. ?The dry-fried beef is awesome too. *** To be 100% honest, I liked the old place on 25th and Irving better. ?That place deserved 5 stars. ?For those of you locals who are in the know, the other place was run by the dad and the two sons had been there since they were kids, too. ?Later, it became So (asian fusion), which had really great noodles and wings as well. ?The brother that ran that place ended up selling it. ?Shame. ?Now it's stupid Macao Friends. ?Stupid.

I haven't yelped for months. This is mostly due to the fact that most places have 1000+ reviews, and like every lazy American, sometimes I feel like one person can't make a difference. BUT. Despite the 1086 reviews, I have to say that San Tung lured me out of my Yelp Review cave. I thought Korean Chinese restaurants only existed in Chicago. MAN! I was so happy when I discovered this place. Granted, it's more Chinese Korean than Korean Chinese, the food is more or less the same. Chinese Korean being more sweet and less spicy than the other way around. Chicken Wings. Greasy. Yummy. Not spicy enough for me though. Mongolian Beef. Delicious. Lots of scallions. String Beans. We had to get a veggie and I'm glad we got this one. Rice. Like any rice-wielding place in SF, you have to pay for it. Tea. Pretty standard. Overall...I prefer this over Nan King, Big Lantern, and any other szechuan, hunan, or cantonese place I've tried--largely due to the mystery-less meat. No stray tendons, veins, or cartilage were chewed upon throughout our entire meal. The wait is not long at all for a 2 top. Will definitely go back.

One of my favorite Chinese restaurants in the city. All you need (for a party of 4) is the dry fried chicken wings, sweet and sour beef (you'll be surprised!), hot and sour soup, shrimp and leek dumplings, and combination chow mein and you're good to go. I think I went here like 3 times in one week... on accident though... on accident. I don't recommend normal dinner time for this place. You need to somehow beat the crowd and put your name at the top of that whiteboard. I think I got there around 6:00 to 6:30pm the latest and I didn't have to wait that long. Once the clock hits after that, the line and wait will be too long for you and you'll just end up settling for Yummy Yummy next door. Also, parking can be a bee-otch sometimes so plan ahead. Service is so-so since they get pretty busy, but overall, I'm sure you will enjoy everything.

I ate at San Tung again tonight, and the food was absolutely as amazing as it was last time. The food is definitely still 5 stars, but after my experience tonight I have to remove 1 star. The problem was that we were seated in the front corner and people were standing and waiting so close to our table that my elbow was rubbing on them. ?When I wanted to go wash my hands it was impossible to get out of my chair until I finally convinced the people to move over. ?I hoped that would give them enough of a hint, but when I came back to sit down again they were back blocking my way. Now, it could be argued that these were the actions of the patrons of this restaurant, but the staff did nothing to stop this behaviour. ?It wasn't even that busy - there was plenty of room for them to stand elsewhere...or even outside (which is were my party waited politely before being called). ?The staff of the restaurant should keep people a polite distance away from people eating their food. ?Even 3 ft would be better...3 inches is too close!

After 1234 reviews of mostly positive reviews and a 20 minute wait, I thought this place would be fantastic. Well, I hope that San Francisco has better Northern Chinese restaurants than San Tung. We tried Noodles with Black Bean Sauce, Chicken Wings with Sweet Sauce, and Pork Dumplings, all of which were highly recommended. The dumplings lacked flavor- no ginger and was not seasoned well while the chicken wings were doused in a sugary sauce that left the pathognomonic dry MSG taste in my mouth. The noodles were okay, not overly greasy, nor flavorful. I personally like the Zha Zhang Mein at Korean restaurants near Geary a lot better. The Kimchi, was more Quickchi, no fermentation with more sugar (probably left over from the chicken wing sauce) that was made with regular not napa cabbage. What's the hype? I went to this place with a Chinese American foodie, and she doesn't get it either.

A couple weeks ago, a good friend came to town: a man whose Chinese parents had arrived in this country in 1960, bought a Swedish smorgasbord restaurant in West LA, and converted it to what was probably the only Swedish/Chinese buffet outside of Stockholm. Anyway: he knew his chinese dives. We had a history of feasting on Chinese food until they had to dump us out the door in a wheelbarrow. And he charged me with finding the right place in SF. I searched Yelp for "most-reviewed" Chinese Restaurant, and San Tung came up. I figure, lots of fans must count for something. When we drove past, at 8:30 on a Thursday night, the sidewalk was jammed -- and the other restaurants on the block were empty. "Chinese people waiting in the dark for a table: good sign," said my friend. As we waited, Will watched the waiters walking out of the kitchen with fully-loaded plates -- about 50% of them with the same chicken wing dish. He wondered out loud, "Wonder what those wings are everybody's getting." A waiter overheard and shouted out "Number 74!" We waited an hour for a table in this small, unglamorous, crowded, boisterous joint. And the food, when it came, told us all we needed to know. This is the most-reviewed joint for a reason. Yeah, we got the wings. They were perfect: straight from the wok, almost too hot to eat, but with an outside that crackled like candied sugar, giving way to perfect meat; all coated in a sweet garlic and chili glaze that was five degrees of moist short of being an actual sauce. The wings were emblematic of everything San Tung gets right. What's supposed to be crunchy is crunchy. What's supposed to be saucy is saucy. Not a single dish came out slimy, soggy, gloopy, or gloppy. Everything was textbook-perfect. My friend's verdict? "Most awesome Chinese meal I've had in years." I'm going back, many times. Although in the future, I'll bring a little flask to keep me company through the wait.

Wow, over 1400 reviews...this review will just be noise! You go for the food, not the service. And besides, for this price, you can't expect the best service. Dry fried chicken...this is all you need to really order. You can try the other stuff but look around the room before you order, they'll all have the dry friend chicken wings. Don't miss it. I'm a food snob who is about about the great service and food...I'm willing to overlook the service her because the chicken wings are that great. Basic order for me and my family/friends: 1 Vegetarian Pan-fried pot stickers 1 egg rolls (I personally HATE this but the friends love it) 1 black bean sauce noodles (ja-jiang-mein) 1-2 Dry fried chicken wings Total bill - $20-$30 (can't beat that with all this food!)

THE BEST CHINESE RESTAURANT EVER..FROM THE SERVICE TO THE YUMMY DELICIOUS FOOD AND DRINKS.... -Dry Chicken Wings and Dumplings are must have on the tables. ?Just these two yummy dishes alone, this place deserves 5 stars already. -The service was incredible friendly and welcome. Espiecally the owner, super COOL, he let us try the plum wine, which tastes like juice but you will feel the alcohol later after the meal. And the runner, he was so upbeat, he kept giving us the delicious spicy kimchi. Another 5 stars for the service .. There is always a long wait and parking could be a pain in the ass, but it all worth it...

Hands down the BEST dried fried chicken and pot stickers! Plenty try to imitate. Some come pretty close but no where else I've been to can beat this place. Yes, I think it's THAT goood. If you go on a weekend for dinner, be warned that there WILL be a wait. One Friday night I had to wait for almost 2 hours.... YES! 2 freaken hours! just to eat their dried fried chicken and oh so good pot stickers. (They have really good dumplings too.) ? I guess the food may be worth the wait but I'd rather go there for lunch on a weekday just to stay away from the crowd. Oh, and parking can get pretty bad.

I am in love with this place. If it was a person...well, i guess it would be me. Mostly because it's blend of Chinese, Korean, and all delicious. The only reason I give it 4 stars is because it is frequently busy, but I guess that's the price you pay for fame. Also, the food the past couple time I've been has been a tinge disappointing. Not like I remember it. Nonetheless, I still love it. Sometimes, the service ain't so hot either. This also contributes to the 4 stays. Basically, you've got to get there early in order to find parking and wait. Have patience, your mouth will thank you later. MUSTS: You have to try the wet or dry chicken wings. A korean staple, for sho. Or as I commonly refer to them: "little chickens from heaven." And also, the black bean noodles. If you go, you have to try these two, in the least. I wish they delivered because I hate waiting. And i hope the next time I go, they don't disappoint my palate. The service can be bad, the place can look like shit, but if the food doesn't taste good, it's all for nothing. If you're on the fence, I'd definitely give it a shot. And if you've been once and didn't enjoy your experience, i would give it another shot.

This place has 2,000-plus reviews so that alone should tell you something. Nonetheless, here's my own personal rundown of San Tung: really great food if you order the right things, potentially long wait depending on what time of day you go, large Chinese families yelling at each other while eating, cramped and aesthetically unpleasing seating area, and waiters who are rude, pushy, and largely unhelpful beyond taking your order and bringing the food to your table. So basically, it has all the essential elements necessary for an excellent Chinese restaurant. I'll be back.

San Tung is delicious, but very busy. On a Saturday for dinner, we waited for about 45 minutes, some of that outside in the cold, watching the bugs crawling around in glass menu posted in the window. Periodically we peeked in to see how much longer we'd have to wait, and I caught a glimpse of a white girl, sitting at a table all by herself, cuddling up to some fried rice and chicken. How I envied her, eating to her heart's content, not having to wait for a larger table to open up, not having to worry about sharing with her dining companions. She was perfectly happy in her own little world, ignoring the stares from the other Chinese patrons. I wanted to be that girl, but I never have the balls to eat by myself in Chinese restaurants. The food was delicious. The dry fried chicken was not at all dry, so maybe I'm missing something in the translation. It was tasty though, despite not being at all what I expected. We also had the wet black bean noodles, family style tofu, and shrimp/leek dumplings. The flavor was very close to what I have at SO, but the preparation of the fried chicken was not as good as what I've had at SO. The shrimp/leek dumplings are a must. Overall, a great dinner, but I would opt for SO over San Tung since there is never a wait when I go, and it's much, much closer. Still, 4 stars.

Dried Fried Chicken wings here is the yang in the ying and yang. For those of you who don't know about the ying and yang, let me sum it up for you guys. ying and yang is a symbol in the Chinese culture which represents light and dark. The most important part of this symbol is the irony that it shows, even though light and dark is total opposite, they are interconnected and they represent the best of two worlds. Dried Fried Chicken wings is the yang because it is the best of the fried chicken wings with sauce. by now you might be wondering what is the ying? well, let me tell you, the ying is the salt and pepper fried chicken wings from Capitol restaurant located in Chinatown. So if you think you have found the best Chinese chicken wings, you are wrong. What you found is only the best of one of the worlds. Now go out there and try the "best of both Worlds"

San Tung has got to be one of my favorite Chinese restaurants in the city. What I get every time I go: Diced dried fried chicken (wings are fun, but diced means you get to work less for the deliciousness in front of you!), string beans, two orders of pork dumplings (I could eat these every day, I swear), and steamed rice (duh). That's really all I need to have a great meal here. The location is fantastic and the wait is DEFINITELY worth it, although I've learned to either order to go or go during non-peak times. I've brought my friends (whose idea of chinese food is Panda Express) here and they've all loved it. It's CLEAN and it's not the same annoying banquet food you see at every family party... GO TRY IT! San Tung doesn't disappoint.

Came with my husband. All the side tables were full so they sat us at one of those large round tables. Yay! I get more room for my stuff. WRONG!!! They just keep packing the table with random ass people who come in off the street to eat by themselves even though the other round tables are empty! Then those random ass people wont stop talking to you and trying to share their food with you. This is cool if this is what you came here for. But actually I just wanted to eat my food and spend time with the company I came with. And it was too damn early for me to be poetic with strangers on a Saturday. It got so awkward because we were there to eat our own food and not socialize with strangers or eat their food that we asked for our food to go and took it home :(! Not cool. I can't review the food because I'm still waiting for it while these strange lone dinners mad dog us from across the table. Awesome.

Gotta love their dried fried chicken! Slightly spicy, and sweet. I'm usually not a fan of sweet food, but this is good. If you want something a little spicier then try their dry fried beef. I typically don't EVER order fried rice, but it's probably one of the better fried rice dishes I've had. Also, just like what everone else orders, the dried fried green beans are good, and garlic spinach. You won't be disappointed!

San Tung is quite possibly one of the best restaurants I've been too. ?Aside from the long seating wait due to its popularity, I'd stand there for hours until I got a seat. I give this restaurant great praise mostly because of their ultimate Dry Fried Chicken Wings. Definitely something I can eat for days without getting sick of. The sweetness and crunch you get from the wings is absolutely delicious!!!!! I LOVE IT! I've tried a couple of their other dishes as well and I must say they're pretty darn good. However, if you ever happen to stop by for a bite to eat, ALWAYS get their fried chicken wings. You won't be disappointed. Service is efficient especially for a place that has a line out the door every time I go. ?Check it out!

The food there is very good. ?Their house noodles are yum, green beans, big homemade potstickers, etc. ?but they are best known and famous for their dry fried chicken wings. ?

Dry Fried Chicken Wings. You heard they're good right? Well go find out if hundreds of people are lying. They are so perfect. While here I also had some green beans and some beef dish that weren't as memorable. But I'll be back for the chicken for sure. I went there after the Haight Street fair on a Sunday, had to wait about 15 minutes which isn't bad at all considering I have heard of people waiting for up to 45 minutes. The place was packed, service was fine. My water and tea cup were filled the whole time.

With so many reviews, nothing I say will keep you from waiting in the cold, but in my humble opinion, this place is WAY OVER-HYPED. If I lived in the hood, and there was no line on a Monday, I might order take-away here, but that is about it. We waited 45 minutes for lousy service (they could have seated us 10 minutes earlier but just were't paying attention,- people seated after us got food 10 minutes faster...) Dumplings are good, the chicken is good, but the noodles were chewy even though hand made....how do you do that with handmade noodles? Also, on the San Wang vs. San Tung controversy: all you San Tung fans keep waiting out on Irving, I'll be inside over on Post next to Soko Hardware having some of the best black bean noodles outside of Nam Dae Moon market....with no line.

I discovered this place about 7 years ago and every single time we come here, it's always the same dishes that we've been ordering since I first stepped into this place and I never get tired of them...that's how good this place is...and they're mostly the 'dried-fried' items...which are the chicken wings, flounder and green beans. ?Sweet, crispy and a little tingle from the peppers. ?Once the chicken wings are done, get the rice and drench it in the sauce. ?We always get the black bean sauce noodles too. ? It's funny that every time we go there, you look at other peoples food on the table and they're almost identical to what you're ordering. ?But you'll ALWAYS see people with the chicken wings. I don't know if it really matters what time you go...this place is so good that there's always a wait...but it's damn well worth it. ?The only thing that's kinda awkward is that if you're a small party, they'll sit you with 1 or 2 or even 3 other parties on one of their big ass round tables.

This place is good eats. ?Here are some notables: Jambong - Spicy with a good soup base and decent amount of seafood, pork, and veggies. Shrimp and leek dumplings - Homemade and fresh, better than the pork ones although they're good too. Sweet and sour pork - Sauce isn't too sweet with good chunks of meat, not that stringy stuff. Fried chicken wings - In a red pepper, slightly sweet sauce, most folks who wait in the cold Sunset wind for a table here get the chicken wings. For groups of six or larger, make a reservation!

Based on the dry fried chicken wings - 5 solid stars. Combination of the fried chicken wings, dry black bean sauce noodles, I'd give it an average of 4. Noodles lacked flavor in comparison to the wings... Service was incredibly fast and efficient. The waiters kept filling our waters even after we finished and were just chatting away. They didn't rush us at all. I came here one other time and ordered the dry and wet wings - dry ones are definitely better. omg. so good. I ordered the dumplings the first time, and didn't think they were all that. I'd definitely come back here for the wings. again. and again. and again.

Their famous dry fried chicken wings are FUCKING SWEET AS HELL. Sure the skin is nice and crispy, but it seemed to have carmelized sugar as the sauce. Hella sweet. And I'm not a sweets person, so you can't expect me to like it as much as other people do. The rice was cheap. It didn't taste like the good jasmine rice. It tasted like the rice that kids get from lunch lines during school lunch. It was that bad. We got broccoli beef also, that was ok. Not much to say about it. The location; park in neighborhoods around it. And it's short of a hole-in-the-wall

Crazy long wait but you knew that. I mean, I did. Kimchee is the first item to hit the table. It's OK - I've had much better. Entrees we ordered included dry fried chicken, bunch of different dumplings, and the dry rice soup. All was solid, good food but not quite up to the hype. Service was surprisingly good in spite of the crowd. If it was easier to get in/out it would be a great lunch spot. Oh yeah - for those of you who are making your first trip, put your name and party size on the white board.

Location is not too easy to get parking and I walked in on a Saturday evening, number 15 on the white board list and I knew this was not good and true. All the tables are round like most Chinese restaurants so having a list full of parties of 2 meant I was getting to go. I ordered the wings and vegetable fried rice. The wings are spectacular as everyone has already and will already write. I was expecting those wings like at SO and I have to say they ARE better. It's the perfect amount of tasty, sweet honey sauciness that layers a not TOO crunchy but crunchy fried chicken wing. I could easily eat one full order, but one order is optimal for 2 people. As for the fried rice, that was good too, it was moist and not crumbly like Panda Express is at times. I recommend, totally and utterly, no question.

I've decided that San Tung will be my very first review because it's that good! My friends from SF have been raving about this place and so I made it my mission to have San Tung for lunch! The only con would have to be the wait. Since it's such a popular place and I did go on a Sunday for lunch, the wait was about 30-45 minutes. The restaurant is relatively small and the bigger your group is, the longer you'll have to wait. My friend said that sometimes they'll seat you at a big table with strangers if you have a small group! All I can say is that it was well worth the wait! My friend and I ordered the boneless fried chicken with fried rice and green beans. The fried rice was like any other fried rice you'd find at a Chinese restaurant. But it was the chicken that was soooooooooo goood! It's definitely the most popular dish at this place and it's you should order! The green beans were nice and crunchy which is also a plus! I'm definitely going to bring my family here next time I'm in the city. San Tung FTW!

I rarely eat chow mein cuz I'm in love with beef chow fun, but my bf said lets get chicken chow mein instead... I'm so glad I did cuz I think I ate most of it! My bf also rarely eats rice and I'm the rice whore so I opted for chicken fried rice and he ate most of it! This place is a pleaser and will make you eat things you don't normally... SO GET OVER THERE AND EAT SOMETHING! We also had lemon chicken and sweet/sour pork and this place serves some of the best I've had. Didn't know I'd be up against a crowd of 15 standing outside to be seated at 8:45pm or a 25 min wait for take out, but it was worth it! I'd go back!

Even if the rest of their food was crap, I'd STILL come back just to eat their dry fried chicken wings!! WIN WIN WIN!!! The wait however can be veeeeerrrryyy long so my suggestion is, don't come here. That way, there'll be more room and wings for me!!! ;0)

Came here for dinner #2 with the parents and my little sister after dinner #1 took too long/didn't fill us up (see my previous review for kazu sushi). We were seated right away and had food on our table within 10 min. Yay! We tried this spicy noodle soup w/ meat and seafood (not sure what it's called), string beans, dumplings, and the dry fried chicken wings. The noodles were pretty spicy, but delicious. The string beans were good in its unique way.. sweeter than the traditional dish. The dumplings were nothing special. But oh my gosh, the chicken wings are amazing! I instantly started raving about how good they were, and missed my mom's description of how they're really not that hard to make and just require soy sauce, sugar, wine.. ?hm, don't remember the rest cause I stopped listening. I definitely want to return to this place for more chicken wings!

It's all about the chicken wings. ?they will take you into another dimension. ?sweet but salty. ?desert but not. ?the dumplings are on hit . ?so is the cha chang men (black bean noodles). ?i've had these noodles at over a dozen different korean/chinese restaraunts and they usually taste the same. ?these cha chang men noodles stand out. ?i know this because i dont usually like cha chang men..but i'll order them here. ?only downside is that after its all said and done, don't be suprised if you're taking those long blinks. ?msg?

It's damn hard to make good Chinese food. I don't know why that is but I do know that this place is good. ?Not very expensive, in a nice neighborhood, truly run of the mill decor, and wonderful food. the dry chicken wings are very good, and the pork dumplings are a must have too. I do wish they had dim sum or bao though. Just get anything, this place is solid. ?Don't be surprised or bitch about the wait, good food everywhere is always in demand.

Holy Jesus this place is awesome! I went with two people and we split four entrees, each being absolutely excellent. I don't know what they make this stuff with but it's a TONGUEGASM times ten. We ordered the hot & sour soup, the dry fried chicken wings, the beef with black mushroom and the pork dumplings. The dumplings are CRAZY TASTY if you combine the three sauces they have at the table (vinegar, soy and oil). I suggest using one part oil, four parts soy and four parts vinegar. UNBELIEVAWABLE. The SHICKEN WANGS are the best I have ever had, and I've had the wings from the Anchor Bar in Buffalo, NY. That's right, these wangs are superior. Their interpretation of hot & sour soup is a hearty blend of DELICIOUSNESS, tofu, pork and other crap with a lot more flavor than other places. The black mushroom beef had thick chewy shroomies to round out our dining experience. Really good, pretty fast, extremely wonderful.

We ate in this neighborhood a few times and this place always had a queue of people waiting for tables. ?So we thought it must be something SO GOOD that shouldn't be missed. ?Tonight we were on our way to our favorite sushi restaurant when we walked by and didn't see a queue! ?So we decided to give it a try to see if this place is really worth the wait. ?We ordered 4 items: 1. ?Pork dumplings 2. ?Dry black bean sauce noodles 3. ?Original dry fried chicken wings (Dry) [They have a Dry and Wet versions and we went with the Dry one.] 4. ?Braised Bean Curd The dumplings came first and they were just OK. The dry black bean sauce noodles were so black that you couldn't even see what the other ingredients were other than the noodles. ?It was too sweet for our taste and I had to rinse off the sauce with some hot water before I could finish it. ?This was the WORST dish that we had tonight and all 4 of us agreed. The chicken wings were good but we didn't like the sweet sauce on which they were placed. ?Also, I thought it should be "dry" since they had a "wet" version, so why did it come with a sauce which detracted flavor from this dish? The tofu dish was OK but again the gravy was a little too much for us. So this is a place that we will NEVER go back to since it is one of the worst restaurants that we have ever tried in San Francisco. ? It is definitely not a place for people who have tasted and appreciate the best Chinese cuisine in Hong Kong, Taiwan, and China.

I was pretty psyched, since the 1) crowded dining room, 2) people standing around the entrance, and 3) the Sign Up Board all usually mean a good meal. Well, it was A-OK. Made plans to eat here at 5:30p. ?Half my group (2 people) says they're going to be late at 5:45 (beefy!!). My friend and I sit down around 5:50. We already know what to order, but by the time our dear friends joined us around 6p, the waiter still hadn't come by to take our order, so basically their lack of attentiveness robbed my friend and I of the smug-ness we could have felt by getting the order in before they showed up :). ANYways, we got: 1) sizzling rice soup - just aite. ?the water chestnuts made me think of raw potatoes. or WERE they raw potatoes? 2) jjajangmyun (noodles w/black bean sauce) - pretty good, one of the better dishes of the night. 3) green beans - a little too salty, but otherwise ok. 4) chicken wings - pretty good, about as good as the homemade kind. It was a satisfying dinner. ?However, the service was not too good (each time they refilled my glass, it was like being at seaworld in the SPLASH ZONE). ?For the price, there's better food and service to be had elsewhere.

San Tung used to be better San Tung used to be our favorite place to go especially the dried fried chicken wings, pot sticker and steamed chive dumplings, mu shu pork, spicy sting beans, hot &sour soup and the dan dan noodles.....used to be Delicious...don't know why, it seems that the food quality has gone down , food has become a lot more greasy for example the pot sticker it looks like it has just been deep fried, shrimp and chive dumpling smells foul, chicken wings wasn't as good special, could have pick the chicken wing up at 99 Ranch Market hot food line. ?Wait staffs are nice. ?Not worth it for the price of the chicken wings.

I'm a chicken fan. ?I'm not sure why. ?Whether it's Popeye's, soy sauce chicken, or chicken pho, I'm a big fan of eating our feathered fowl friend. ? That being said, when I think of good chicken, my mind often wanders to San Tung. ?I used to live 5 minutes from this place and the famous chicken wings (three types but all tasty) are among the tastiest, albeit stickiest, in San Francisco. ?I'd venture to say they're unique too as I haven't been to another Chinese restaurant that serves this style. ? As for other dishes, some people like the dumplings (I thought they were ok), many like the fresh noodles (jajang mein and black bean), but it was always the chicken wings that drew us back. I've had meals of just two plates of chicken wings and rice with friends and we were not the only ones...

I'm horrible at ordering Chinese food. ?I know, I'm a shame to my peeps (and mainly, my momma). ?I came here with a friend at around 8:45 (no wait, easy parking) and proceeded to consume an absolute obscene amount of food. ?Obscene as in I was disgusted with myself...yet, secretly proud. We ordered: - Mu Shu Chicken: ?Delicious - with a lot of egg (which I like), but fairly oily. - Mustard Green & Pork Noodle Soup: ?WOW. ?Usually, this soup is a little on the bland side. ?Not at San Tung - very flavorful (even the noodles) with real slices of pork (versus the oddly blanched out pork that's usually used). ?This is one soup where I'd probably pass on the soup because of the msg & salt content. ? - Shrimp & Leek Dumplings: ?For $6.50, you get 12 pieces. ?The ingredients taste very fresh and seemed pretty authentic. ? I liked that they started off with Chinese Kim Chee (opens the appetite). ?Our bill was less than $25 and we ate almost everything even though the portions are gigantic. ?My only complaint, as with most restaurants like this is that the food was more oily and salty than I preferred. ?However, last night, it totally hit the spot.

Anyways, the dry chicken wings were great!! ?I can still taste it!! ?We ordered the dumplings, the potstickers, bean curd, chicken wings, and the pork & mustard green noodle soup. ?All were delicious!!

I LOVE this place! ?Yes, there is generally a crowd and a wait regardless of what night it may be, but that just shows how good it is! ?What, you expect a bad restaurant to have a wait like that? Whatever you do, whatever you feel like ordering...you HAVE to get the dry fried chicken! ?Pretty much what they're known for, it is THAT good. ?We've also tried some of their other dry fried items to see how they compare, and while they are tasty (especially the fish...beef and calamari aren't bad either), the wings are still the best. ?Other delicious staples we will get are their dumplings and black bean noodles, as well as their potstickers (pretty hefty and generous sizes). ?They also have a number of noodle soup dishes that are filling, with the mustard green noodle soup dish being a personal favorite. ?Throw in an assortment of their other items, and we'll be that big table along the wall stuffing ourselves silly. Get here a little early or a little late to avoid a lot of the crowds, throw your name on the list, and talk a walk over to 9th to grab a coffee or hot chocolate. ?It's definitely worth the wait, but remember to order the wings! ?Just don't get too many orders...my friends and I want our share as well!

I waited 45 minutes just to get a table. I only went here because the waitress at Toyose was VERY rude. So this restaurant was plan B in the Outer Sunset area. I don't think that the 45 minute wait was worth it. However, I do think that this place is worth trying. The Dry Fried Chicken Wings were pretty good, I have to admit. They were very flavorful and the sauce it was bathed in is mouth-watering. It wasn't the BEST I've ever had, but it was a good eat. The rest of the dishes weren't anything special either--we got the Shrimp and Leek Dumplings and the Combination Fried Rice. That was filling to our hungry ?stomachs. The service, was GREAT. You wouldn't expect that kind of service at a Chinese restaurant. But I guess they want to stay the most popular restaurant on the block. I don't know how this place got so popular. It's not bad. I would say above average though, 3.5 stars. But not a 3.5 stars that I would round up to 4. Oh yeah, and parking is tough, just like everyone else is saying. I'd only come here for lunch or non-peak hours. It is worth a trip though! Good plan B.

My family and I have been coming here ever since we discovered it's amazing chicken wings. We always order the same thing when we come here, with a few minor alterations here and there depending on the number of people we have. My expectations for coming here are always high, and I don't ever remember leaving San Tung unhappy. Sure the wait is long, or the service is not the best... but I judge base on their food... which is DELISH things i recommend: - their shrimp and leek dumplings - potstickers - CHICKEN WINGS - beef and spinach noodle soup - Sour and Spicy Soup

Dry chicken wings. ?I waited to put you in my mouth for over a month. ?Were you worth it? ?First, you have to consider my love of chicken. ?At one point in my life, I was only spending my money on beer, cheese and chicken. ?If there was a Chik-fil-A around I would still go there despite their Glenn Beck holy rolling. ?If my cousin was from Arkansas and married a chicken and had little chicken babies, I would probably try and eat them. ?Which is saying a lot because I only eat Irish babies. ?Sorry I am digressing like Melville in Billy Budd (just be thankful I don't bring up mutinies or allusions to Christ). ? Basically, these chicken wings had a lot to live up to and I did indeed love them. ?The wings were shy at first and I was initially dissuaded by the sticky layer they left on my fingers (those this has not deterred me in the past). ?Once I allowed myself to give in to my carnal desires, I realized that these wings were definitely worth the wait and the BART/Muni journey (I actually saw a women with a mouse in a ball in her purse). My friend and I also got Shrimp Lo Mein. ?It was average. ?Hence, why I cannot anoint San Tung with 5 stars. Be very careful not to get the wet wings though. ?Apparently, the recipe comes from Sarah Palin's Grizzly Mom Hibernation Treats.

On a month long trip to find the best friend chicken, a friend suggested this place. ?It is worth the drive to SF from our area. ?The location is a little out of the way. ?Get there early! ?We went around 7:00 and the place was half way full. ?By the time we got our appetizers the place was PACKED. ?They were sitting two parties to one table if they could. ?It's very greasy spoon, but the food speaks for itself. The chicken is AMAZING. ?We got it both ways, dry and wet. ?I like the wet ones better. ?The sauce is not spicy, which is my thing. ?They are tangy sweet. ?Messy, hard to eat with chop sticks, but delicious. ?We also ordered potstickers for an appetizer. ?They were just okay. ?Nothing special. ?The service is like many chinese restaurants. ?They take your order and disappear for a while. ?Its not very modern high end, but the food is just too good to mark it down just for the tableware or the atmosphere. ?I would come back for sure.

I finally decided to try this place with a girlfriend since almost everyone I knew recommended this place. We decided to order the famous Dry Fried Chicken Wings and Black Bean Noodles.The Black Bean Noodles were good but kinda salty. The Dry Fried Chicken Wings however were amazing... Sweet, savory, scrumptious. I have to say they're the best chicken wings I've ever had. I heard the wait can be really long, especially during weekends but lucky me I only waited 5 minutes to be seated.

2 words: yummy deliciousness!!! The dry fried chicken wings are soooo good. We love the chicken so much that we ordered the boneless ones and the boned ones. The wings tastes better but theres less to eat. The string beans were pretty good too. The sauce tastes like the sauce they use for the chicken but more watery. We also ordered noodle with peanut sauce, dry black bean sauce noodle and seafood noodle soup. The noodle with peanut sauce is hella good. I don't really like black bean sauce noodle but it's actually pretty good here, although I don't think its better than the peanut sauce noodle. The seafood noodle soup was just so so. I didn't want to eat that since we ordered some much more yummy dishes.

I only came here twice. First time it was great- dry wings and fried rice. The fried rice and chicken took a really long time to cook but it was delicious! That's why I came back here for the second time. Second time-lunch combo (dry wings,soup of the day,rice for $7/$8) and chicken chow mein. The chow mein wasn't the best but it was alright ($6ish) chicken wings for lunch special was only 6 pieces versus the whole order of 12 wings. 4 stars because the only good thing here is the WINGS.

This place is delicious! Like everyone recommends, those chicken wings are really something. It's definitely a must have every time you decide to go. The wait can be brutal--over an hour. I suppose it's worth it if you're craving those wings.... Mmm those wings... Ahem, moving on. The string beans are another MUST! Normally I hate veggies but this place has got it down. I still need to try more of their menu but these 2 dishes alone keep me coming back for more. The waiters are awesome. They are energetic with a good sense of humor and never make you feel pressured for taking too long or anything. Another plus is that the food comes out super fast once you've ordered. However if you're looking for an extremely "authentic" spot for Chinese food, this might not be for you. The food is very delicious, yes, but also very commercialized in its own way. The place looks overall quite clean but the chairs look a tad old and dirty. Nonetheless it's worth a try if you're not too nit-picky about hygiene and authenticity of the taste.

We used to go to this place when it was located in a tiny hole-in-the- wall space near 25th and Irving. It was great back then. It's even better now with the bigger space...you can actually breathe. The spicy sweet wings or shrimp, the spicy long beans, the dumplings!!! Wow...the dumplings. The homemade noodles in soup or even the ja jeorng noodles (some dark sauce on top) that I have since given up, because somehow, they seem way too fattening to be worth it. This is a great place for food from this region of China (near Korea). One important tip: do not get take-out from here. It never tastes as good by the time you get it home. It's beautiful food straight from their kitchen to your table. Some food is just like that.

Great, authentic food. All write about the dried fried chicken wings and they are as good as the press. The dumplings are amazing, always fresh and hot and skins homemade, as are the homemade stretch noodles. Dinner fit for a royal court. Only problem is extremely popular and wait times can be big. If possible, avoid the obvious crush times or be prepared to wait 1 hour or more.

This place was jammed for a Sunday evening, and so the story begins.. While waiting for our table to appear, ?I scoped out the other tables and it seemed that everyone was ordering the Chinese Style Hot Wings fried chicken wings/drummettes to go with whatever else, so we did too.. Yummy.. Oh yea.. for starters, we ordered up the 6.95 size of the Sizzling Rice soup. ?Perfectly prepared, and tasty, yet NOT overly salty, and no MSG from what I could detect. 2nd plate to arrive was Curry Chicken. ?Great Chinese-style Curry Chicken! ?Tasty, flavorful and very aromatic for a "staple" Chinese Restaurant dish. ? Top dish of the night, for my simple tastes! I will order any ?of the above again esp. the curry and the soup. We also ordered spicy string beans - tasted a little flat, it was missing that little "something". but was cooked perfectly, and also the pork dumplings. ?The dumplings were good, but the dumpling skin was a bit of a letdown, being a bit mushy/overcooked, destroying the texture a bit. Good meal, though the waitress gave us a dirty look when we ordered up some more rice right before we left! ?Hey.. ya gotta eat these leftovers somehow!

When I think of San Francisco, I think "I have to have some Dry Fry Chicken." The experience is what I'm after. A busy restaurant, waiters running mad like chickens with their heads cut off, and diners pacing back and forth in anticipation of a quick fix. And when you bite into that famous chicken, the silence will be deafening, your drool will pour, and the air you breathe will be sweet. This is not an elevated dining experience but by far the most nostalgic one you will ever have when it comes to dining in San Francisco. yum.

**SO SORRY to say, but this place was far from DELICIOUS!! ?My Fellow Yelpers & 7x7 you have truly let me down this time...=( I ordered the supposedly uber-yummy "dry fried chicken wings" and I must say they sorely missed the mark on this dish. ?First of all, the wings just tasted like typical honey teriyaki wings that you can get from any local sports bar. ?The wings are just quickly fried and then smothered in a very very SWEET sauce. ?I was just expecting more savory, especially based on the menu description which does not mention the sweet factor AT ALL. ? The other items I ordered were the Seafood Fried Rice and Beef w/ Green Onions. ?The seafood rice was OK because the mussels and scallops were perfectly cooked and very fresh. ?However, the rice and the seafood basically lacked any real flavor. ?As far as the beef, I rather not go into detail about how chewy it was and not quite sure what type of 'beef'' this was. Overall, I definitely wasted a lot of time heading all the way to Sunset and waiting an hour to be seated for the famous San Tung wings. ?I was soooo dissapointed because I truly WANTED to love this place so much!! ?Usually, the YELP reviews are right on point, but not so with this place. =-(

Are you kidding? ?Line out the door, mostly of young Asian Americans, my Asian American friends recommend...amazing food, busy ALL the time. ? I don't really know what else to day except I feel sorry for the Chines Restaurant across the street. ?Clearly they are surviving on spill-over. The food is amazing. ?Great Chow-Mein ($6.50-9.50) perfect crispy pot-stickers ($6.95) and when I go back I will definitely have the chicken wings and green beans (both $6.50) ?They were being passed around on every table and a staple on every lazy-susan within view. ? Service, well I don't know because I got take-out. ?But, as with any busy place with an international menu, you don't really go for the service. ?They seem to get the plates out on time and that's all that matters. ?Don't need a smile for that and frankly, don't care. ? This is a great place to take friends! ?If I had any out here, I would! Tip: Get in early, put your name on the board and if you don't feel like waiting in-line, you are an idiot.

One of my favorite Chinese Restaurants...and its not just cause I know the owner and can skip the line. The Dry Fried Chicken Wings here are legendary. Their dumpling are pretty tasty too. I actually don't think I've had anything bad here. The spicy tripe is good, maybe a lil too chewy. There is nothing that I wouldn't eat here. Almost everything is good and nothing is below average. Oh yeah, it's cheap too.

My grand introduction to Sweet and Sour Prawns, and boy, do I want more of those. ?Mongolian Beef, Curry Chicken (in the yellow curry variant similar to what Tu Lan offers for those familiar with that popular 6th St. establishment), Dry Fried Chicken Wings (wow! ?yum! ?hadn't had anything quite like these before but vaguely reminiscent of fried chicken we ate in South Korea last year), potstickers (good but not as good as Just Won Ton), and sauteed string beans (which others enjoyed but I didn't get around to trying). A truly gigantic menu and a bunch of noodle and soup dishes we'll need to try another time.

____UPDATE________________________________________ I've just been informed by those in the know, that you are supposed to order the Dry Fried Chicken Wings. So, I guess I did order wrong. Alas, I won't change my rating because it's impossible for me to eat chicken wings, they creep me the fuck out. Still - if you're going to go here, don't screw it up like I did. __________________________________________________?_ I've been searching for a good Chinese place for what feels like forever. ?Maybe it's me and I've been spoiled by Su Hong (in MP; raised on the streets of the BA) or maybe all Chinese food is total shit that can either be prepared correctly or not. I searched Yelp for the highest rated, most reviewed Chinese Restaurants and decided to do San Tung on a Tuesday night. It was surprisingly crowded when we arrived, but we only had to wait a few minutes for a clean table and some hot green tea. ?Started off well. I'm always reassured when I frequent any ethnic restaurant and people of that actual ethnicity are eating there, it's like a validation I need - proof that the food is legit. We ordered the Egg Rolls and Mu Shu Pork to start . ?Both of us ended up not eating the Egg Rolls and I'm pretty sure I've had better from a Costco sample giver. The Mu Shu was good, but not the best and isn't Mu Shu hard to fuck up? ?There was a problem with the pancake/Chinese tortillas you use to wrap them though, they were obviously microwaved because they got hard and cold really fast and stuck to each other so much that they ended up tearing apart and ripping. So, we each only ate about a half of an Egg Roll and one holy Mu Shu each. We ordered entrees thinking they would be better and they weren't. ?My Kung Pao Chicken was bland and relatively tasteless. ?I thought the chili symbol next to Kung Pao meant it was spicy - umm, not so. My boyfriend got the Sweet and Sour Chicken and his was a lot better than mine, so we both just ended up sharing his, but after a few bites we realized the bright red goop wasn't that great, it was just that we were both still super hungry at this point. We took home none of the leftovers and the service was hasty, not friendly by any means. ?I wouldn't be surprised if we ate one of the chef's spit when my bf asked for a clean plate to put his chicken on. Which was another disappointment; the dirty plates. ?They don't clear them and you end up with like ten dishes cluttering your table. ?Hot! Maybe we just ordered wrong? ?Nothing out of the four different dishes we tried will I ever go back out to the Sunset for.

I finally made it. Went with a friend for lunch. So the menu comes out with a plate of kim chee. We ordered pork dumplings, leek dumplings, black bean noodles, and the infamous dry deep fried chicken wings. The deep fried dry wings are as advertised. Deeeelicious. They come out with a glaze on them. They have a bunch of chilis mixed with them though not totally noticeable. They also have a sweet taste to them. I can see how one could eat 3 plates of them. The dumplings were also pretty good. They come out hot and soft. They come in plates of 12. You could probably eat one plate on your own. The noodles were also good but we may not have needed them. There was a lot of black bean sauce. It completed the job for us. Anyway, if I'm to get back to this place, then I'm probably just going to do chicken wings only.

My favorite Combo: Dry Fried Anything (Chicken is my favorite) "The Abnormally Large" Potstickers Black Bean Sauce Noodles Steamed Dumplings I've been an avid fan of San Tung since this place was at it's old location. ?I have to agree with a few Yelpers that the quality of a few of the dishes have decreased. ?However, after saying that, I still can't find another restaurant that remotely comes close to competing with the dried fried chicken or the black bean sauce noodles. If you want to try this place, don't be scared away by the crowd standing in front. ?Pray you're one of the lucky ones to find parking in the area, put your name on the wait list and try out the dry-fried items; it is worth the trouble.

Well, everyone else already said it all, but I'm gonna reiterate so I can feel productive on yelp: - dumplings/potstickers (my personal favorite = steamed potstickers! you get 8 of them, vs just 6 potstickers and they're the same size) - the dry fried chicken is good, true, but $9 for chicken makes it a little bit less good. - noodles aren't bad either. I mean it's a "shan dong" restaurant, so of course their noodle products are pretty decent. =) Everything else is aiite, really it's the dumplings/potstickers that stick out the most. Service is top notch for a Chinese place too, I tipped them a good 20% and felt it was worth it. =) Never once had to ask for water refills, they bring them constantly as needed. Fast, efficient service, these workers are hauling ass!!! Friday night strangely was not busy (6pm), but I went again the next day, and Saturday night I waited for 40 minutes. *shrugs* Don't know why! But usually when I drive by this place, it's off the hook, piles of people waiting outside the door, and lots of people running in and out for take-out. Smart people. I recommend: Try it out, it's popular for a good reason!

These reviews are pretty close to the mark. The food is authentic and the prices are quite reasonable for San Francisco. Getting a table can be tricky. The dishes are just plain terrific. Try this place. I doubt you'll regret it. GET THE DRY FRIED CHICKEN! Though, the kimchee they bring for free isn't all that good.

Came here for my birthday dinner with the family. Great food, average Asian service (which means you need to be aggressive and wave them down), casual atmosphere, decent prices. Downsides are parking and long wait for a table even on weekday nights. - Dry Fried Chicken Wings: a bit spicy but soooo good! MUST TRY!!! - Dumplings: pork is good, shrimp was okay, use the sauces! - Spicy Combo Noodle Soup: big portion, a bit of everything meat/seafood, noodles okay, spicy - Garlic Eggplant: really tasty! although a bit oily - Combo Claypot: okay, nothing special - Chicken & Mushrooms: good Please be warned that the meter maids are still going at it even at 8pm! Be careful where and how you park! We saw people getting tickets for not curbing their tires and parking in their driveways.

I would say 4 stars for taste, 2 stars for the MSG...so an average of 3. Busy place. It looks like your typical Chinese restaurant. Luckily we arrived (11 of us) before dinnertime so we got a table easily. FOOD Most of the food was pretty flavorful, but I could tell there was a lot of salt/MSG in it. In fact, I think my tongue is still a little dry from it (umm...9 hours later? I need water...). Dry fried chicken wings! I don't know what they season it with...but it's spicy and kind of sweet at the same time. Get them. Sweet & sour pork (I think): Pretty fresh. I liked the little crunch that came with it. Broccoli with beef: Tender, just the way I like it. Chicken with green beans: This was pretty good too. Plenty of sauce to go around... Black bean noodles with some seafood: I didn't like this one as much. It was basically chow mein noodles drenched in black bean sauce with some seafood in it. Shrimp & leek dumplings: These were ok, something different. Eggplant dish (with garlic? I don't know): Good if you like eggplant. PRICE It came out to about $11 per person, so it was okay I guess. Good luck with parking!

If I were to rate this place based on the dry fried chicken wings alone, I'd give it a 5 stars. However, I have to rate it based on the entire experience, bringing it "down" to 3. I heard so much about this place. ?My bud lives so close to this place he says he can smell it from his room. But then I realized, the food smell is so oily and strong, I can still smell it here in Socal. They have a lot of variety and great choices. I also tried kung pao chicken, dryfried fish, different dumplings, chicken noodles, fried rice. There is like nothing relatively healthy here, and I don't think they have any good veggie dishes, which I like mixing in with my food. This knocks a ?bit. ?I'm just not a fan of ridiculously oily food. We're talking super coated. Not the crust of the earth, but the mantle, that thick layer of molten magma inside the Earth's crust between the hot core and the outer crust. Yes, that mantle, remember 3rd grade now don't you? Well, it was coated like that. Of course it's going to be good when coated with this much oil. It isn't a special recipe or a great taste, it just taste good due to MSG, fat, and oil. But the thing is that it does taste damn good, but it's nothing most restaurants can't do, or something I can't do at home easily.. We took out, but the staff was friendly, and nice, and helpful. In addition it's a pretty big place that fits a lot of people though it DOES get busy. I just don't think this place is a special experience. A award 4-5 stars to places with that special tasting experience, I don't feel it deserves that. 3 stars , A -ok!

As this revered restataunt is on my daily walking route in my neighborhood, I feel compelled to follow up on my earlier review with additional observtions. Since my first AWFUL gastronomic experience dining at San Tung (it's been a while since any restaurant served me canned vegatable soup which made me ill!), I've noticed several additional signs while walking by on Irving. Here are but a few: 1) A handwritten sign posted with the following request: "San Tung employees: Do Not Spit on our homes or our Cars. Police Reports filed!" 2) HUGE (50lbs) sacks of MSG being loaded in through the front door around 3pm -- before the dinner rush. 3) Roughly 75% of the photos posted on Yelp are of 2 dishes. No matter how good their MSG-laden *dry chicken wings* are, ONE DISH does not make a restaurant! San Tung: FAIL!!

When I'm ready to stomach a parking search that ?matches that of the holy grail, I commit myself to a trip to San Tung. ?My patience already wearing thin from the parking situation, I synchronize my visit right before doors open. ?I'm not the only one. Dubbed "crack wings," ST's wings are harmonious and downright divine. ?My order does not deviate from any other visit: ?wings and dumplings (shrimp & leek and pork). ?The dumplings are a nice contrast to the bursting-with-flavor wings. ?

It's amazing how long the wait is here. It's always packed. Overall, the food is fine. Standard, sit down chinese fare about traditional enough to satisfy an ABC and Americanized enough to bring your non-asian friends. If it weren't for one thing, this place would be three stars but the wings here are AMAZING. Everything people say about these being crack wings is true. People have been raving about the little dinky wings you get at korean fried chicken places - BonChon or Kyochon. But, this is the real deal. Big, meaty wings, fried perfectly crispy on the outside and tender and moist on the inside. The sauce they use is sweet and salty and spicy all at the same time. They need to open up a stand to just sell these babies. I smell a franchise! Move over korean fried chicken the chinese got your number.

So the food here is awesome!!! Of course the chicken wings, but also the black bean noodles, dumplings, mu shu pork, and especially the hot and sour soup. Went with friends on saturday night, very very busy. Because we were a group of four they would not use one of the large tables for us, but we shared with two other people to get a table asap. It was so busy I won't comment too much on service.... I would like to see how it is on a regular night. Great food and reasonable prices especially for the among of food you get.

In the past I would have given this place a 4 star or even 5. ?But it has definitely gotten downhill for me. ?I'm definitely going to be coming here less. Price increase - They've increased their prices dramatically, some of my favorites the Fried Flounder and the Cherry Pork have gone from $11 to $14 and $9 to $12. ?When they have that many people waiting to eat there every time I go by I guess they can afford to raise prices like that. ?And normally, I would be ok with that except... Downgrade in Quality - The last couple of times I ordered the cherry pork, there were a lot of fatty and chewy pieces, basically meaning that they've downgraded the quality of meat that they use and/or the meat isn't fresh. ?I've also had the chicken wings a couple of times and the meat definitely wasn't very fresh as the flesh was dry and stuck to the bones. ?They need to realize that the great taste of the sauce is no substitute for freshness of the food.

Hello yummyness. There are a few restaurants where I always order the same things, simply because they are so good that I don't want to miss out on them by trying something new. Here is what I always order at San Tung: Dry Fried Chicken. Chicken wings fried, then coated in a spicy, sticky, sweet sauce that is so good, you'll lick your fingers and the plate. If you don't want to bother with the wings, it also comes in pieces. Don't be fooled and order the Wet Fried Chicken, its something completely different, though good, not nearly as delicious. Fried Pot-stickers. San Tung is mostly known for house made noodles and dumplings (including the dumpling wrappers), so you must try some, even if it isn't these pot-stickers. They also come steamed, but anything with a crispy, fried bottom tugs at my heart. Mu Shu Pork. Now, I'm part Chinese, and normally I would never order ?a dish like this, but once I tried it, I was hooked. The 'pancake' is thin, and perfectly chewy. The pork mixture is filled with saucy cabbage, pork, mushrooms, bamboo shots and egg. ?Smear some hoisin sauce on your pancake, fill it with Mu Shu, roll and devour. I can't wait to go back to San Tang.

Here's what you need to order....DRY FRIED CHICKEN WINGS (Dry Style). ?The sauce is amazing! ?You can put it on $hit, and I would seriously consider eating it. ?The only drawback is the wait, but even if you had to wait 45 min, it's TOTALLY worth it!!!! Let me recap for you. ?Order the DRY FRIED CHICKEN WINGS (Dry Style), and you won't be disappointed! ?Everything else is superb as well, but they are known for their DRY FRIED CHICKEN WINGS!

San Tung is okay. ?It's what you expect, good, hardy, and salty. ?I wouldn't say it's worth an hour wait. ?When I go there, I'll only stay if there's 2 names before me or no wait. ?I don't need the spicy fried chicken or green beans that bad. ?Those are 2 of their most popular dishes. I'm not Chinese, but being a S.F. native, and eating at neighborhood spots all over the city, allows me to say that San Tung isn't an authentic place but one geared for the non-Asian-y tongue.

Oh well. ?The food was WELL worth the wait. ?Special shout out to the super friendly + adorable Chinese waiter who kept checking on us while we were waiting for a table. ?He probably felt pretty bad since we looked so utterly miserable and *slow death from starvation* was reflected in our forlorn eyes. ?

Be prepared to wait! This place is ALWAYS busy and there is always a waiting list. You'll need to write your name and number of people in your party on the whiteboard to the right of the entrance. If you have a small group of people (up to maybe 3-4), you can even be seated faster if you don't mind "sharing" a table with other parties. The prices are reasonable, and the portions are small to medium. They give you a dish of kimchee/spicy veggies when you first sit down. Their fried chicken really is as good as people say. Yum. Dumplings are great too. Potstickers - huge, but seemed more deep-fried a little than pan-fried like usual. Beef and tomato chow mein was tasty also. The reason I give this place only 3 stars, though, are the waiters. Their service really sucks! I know not to expect much from Chinese waiters in Chinese restaurants - they are usually not very friendly. But most of the waiters in this place are just downright rude! Some of them talk to you in a condescending tone and act like you're an idiot. A person in my party was SCOLDED by a female waiter because she got the name of the chicken wrong when she was ordering - sheesh! I would stop in there more often for the good food despite the wait, but I won't because the waiters are too rude for my liking.

Came here last night for dinner with a few friends. Thankfully my friends arrive a little before 6pm and was able to get a table in the back! Because by the time we arrived at 6:15, the place was packed. By the time we left at 8, there was a crowd of people at the door. Insane! Moral of the story..come here at some weird time to eat if you don't want to wait. We ordered: -Dried Fried Chicken Wings - Delicious! Crispy and then coated this sweet and spicy sauce. Yum! -Dried Fried String Beans - This was very flavorful too! -Shrimp and Leek Dumplings & Pork Dumplings - Both were delicious! -Steamed Potstickers - lots of filling, and homemade! -Black Bean Sauce with Noodle - This was good...but it can get messy eating this. -Peanut Noodle - Same concept as above, only with a peanut sauce. this was pretty good as well! Overall, all of us left with a happy and full stomach! Best part is that because we sat in the back, it was a lot quieter so we were able to talk and hear each other without screaming. Parking is a hassle there tho...well because its Irving St and there are so many cars there. Service here was actually pretty good - very attentive and friendly. Again, come early or at really random/off times if you don't want to wait...otherwise expect to wait!

My friend and I were in the area and decided to Yelp some restaurant recommendations. ?So what's this San Tung place with 4 stars and over 1400 reviews? We knew we had to try it out. When we arrived, we witnessed the lines out the door at San Tung while nearby restaurants were 'hitting flies' as they would say in Chinese for having no business. Walked in, placed our name on the whiteboard with our party size and in 20-30 minutes we were seated. Upon seating, we were greeted with a plate of kimchi and huge menus. There were a lot of items that I wanted to try but this night, I knew I had to order the Dry Fried Chicken Wings. ?In addition, we ordered the Three Ingredients (calamari, shrimp, and scallop cooked with peapods, carrots, and bamboo shoots), and the Twice Cooked Pork. Simply put, the chicken wings are worth the wait and I understood after the first bite why this place had a line out the door and why their neighbors were still hitting flies.

Took the N Judah Muni train over to San Tung to cross #36 off of the 7x7 Big Eats list. ?After waiting about 30 minutes for a table, we ordered: 1. Dry Fried Chicken Wings - Very delicious, I was expecting butthole burning spicy, but was pleasantly surprised to find a crispy, sticky sweet and savory wing with just the right amount of heat. ?Perfectly the way I like it. 2. Handmade Noodles in Spicy Peanut Sauce - This dish was also surprising, I really didn't know what to expect. ?The sauce was thick and peanut based, mixed with water chestnuts, peas, large chunks of shrimp and scallops. ?The noodles were super long and handmade - perfectly al dente. ?The whole thing was topped with julienned cucumber. 3. Pork Dumplings - these came out piping hot and juicy, it was not accompanied by any sauce, so we made our own mixture out of the condiments on the table - soy, vinegar, chili oil and chili paste. ?These weren't the best I'd ever had, but pretty good. 4. Sauteed Spinach w/ Garlic - Decent. I will say that there are 3 negatives about this restaurant: 1. The "kim chee" appetizer is really disgusting. ?Not kim chee at all, but cabbage soaked in chili paste - totally hot, not fermented, and reeking of weird cabbage smell. 2. The place kinda smells like urine. 3. They charge $1.50 per person for rice. ?No self respecting chinese restaurant should charge this much for white rice! ?It is a staple of the meal, not an optional side... All in all, the service was just so-so (typical for a chinese restaurant), and the price was moderate, the whole meal came out to about $42 w/ tax and tip (we ordered way too much for just 2 people - took home 3 boxes of leftovers).

I think this place is so UBER delicious!!! Definitely the "crack" chicken aka Dry Chicken is so good! OMG I can still taste the deliciousness in my mouth. My mouth is just watering thinking about it. It's a little bit pricey for the portions, but it's totally worth it. There was a wait for a table so while we were waiting we noticed the common thing at every single table was the Dry chicken. So when you stop by here you have to at least get one order to try. We also ordered the homemade pork dumplings. However to me this tasted store bought. It was not as awesome as other dumplings in other chinese restaurants. I only ate one piece while my friends devoured the rest. There was also a side of sauteed beans that we ordered. It was pretty good however a little bit oily but it was okay. they also give each table a side of homemade Kimchi. It wasn't as spicy as most kimchi but it was a little peppery. The overall service was good for how busy they were except that when we ran out of tea we had to go out of our way to ask for tea. Usually by tipping open the lid of the tea pot it's a signal for more tea but apparently here it's not but maybe it was because there were tons of people hungry for dry chicken.

Had a lunch here for 2 and as always, I insisted on ordering enough food to feed a party of 5. ?I remember the chicken wings, which were delicious, but not much else... Like most Asian restaurants, the wait staff isn't exactly the most attentive, but I've learned long ago not to judge Asian establishments based on service. Make like a lemming and come try the wings but definitely skip the dumplings.

We came here for lunch on a Sunday afternoon around 12:30pm and surprisingly there was no wait! Had a nice lunch but the only thing worth mentioning is the dry fried chicken wings!!!!! SO. GOOD. You haven't really been to San Tung unless you've tried them. P.S. The place gets PACKED--loooong line by the time we left around 1:30pm--so come early!

After a long uphill hike (both ways! no, not really), we indulged in shrimp and chive dumplings, potstickers, peking noodles, eggplant, and dry fried chicken wings. ?We loved everything but the peking noodles. ?The noodles themselves had a great texture, but the peking meat sauce was not as chock full of delicious veggies or meat as it should be, and much more of a gloppy, cornstarchy mess. The dry fried chicken? ?ZOMG WTF how do they get it to be so piping hot, crispy, sweet and delicious? ?I'm thankful that I'll never have to resort to McNuggets dunked in honey ever again. Thanks, Yelp and Yelpers for leading us to this little gem.

Keepin' it short.. with 2100+ review no need for more inflated fluff.. -More Korean style Chinese food -The chicken wings are a must (crispy and tangy *if you get the sauce order) -Their noodles are little chewer, it has some bite to it. Good if you like that -Everything else is eh.. (Beef noodle soup was avg., ZaJang Mein was very very average, and I am being nice) - Dumplings are hand made thick and doughy.. - Free spicy kim chee after ordering - Tons of people come here, so come early

Four words, DRY FRIED CHICKEN WINGS! The chicken wing is NEVER a disappointment! The crunchiness is perfect and sauce, I'm in love! It is just perfect! How can you NOT order this when you're here! I love Kim Chee! And for them to have it as an appetizer, it makes me happy! I ordered the Cold Noodle today since it was hot in SF, It was small, but the taste did not disappoint! I love peanut sauce! I'll probably get it in the future. Make sure you have someone put their name down while you look for parking because parking is a pain!!!

Excellent Chinese-Korean Restaurant Dry fried chicken is very good. ?The wet version is essentially the same, but with more sauce. ?Also, the fried rice, Jam-Pong (spicy seafood soup) and Ja-Jang-Mien (Black bean over noodles) are very good as well. Since coming to the bay area, I've been looking for a good Chinese-Korean (Hwa-Gyo) restaurant. ?Ethnically, these are typically chinese who live in korea. This cuisine is unique, because there are a set of dishes that can only be found in these restaurants. ?These dishes are spectacular. They are they bring the best elements of both cultures. It is now one of my favorite places in the bay area.

Let me first say that I come here purely to chow down on great homey Chinese/ Korean food. ?I'm a regular so do I have a few thoughts to share...... My tri-weekly meal (with dining companions) consists of: - Small plate of homemade kimchee - Seaweed or Sizzling Rice soup - Pork and Shrimp/Leek Dumplings - Mu Shu Pork - Sauteed Green Beans - Dry Fry Chicken Wings (Diced gets your 40% satisfaction; wings 110% satisfaction) I don't come here for quaint ambience. In fact, San Tung's hustle and bustle is typical of restaurants in Hong Kong - if you've been there, you know exactly what I mean. The only difference is that the customers dying to get a table actually adhere to the 18" X 15" whiteboard waitlist. ? I don't come here to eat off of fancy table cloths (in fact there are none; only paper placemats); or to drink fancy 20 year-old teas picked by shinny 10 pound monkeys living in remote caves. It's just regular old Chinese tea. I don't come here expecting to get table in 10 minutes, except when I eat there anytime between 2:00-5:55pm. ?Even then, I'm never alone..... where does it say you have to eat the handmade steamed pork or shrimp/leek dumplings at a specific time?! ?I say no. I don't come here to eat dinner at 7pm sharp on Friday evening. ? However if you're brave enough to tough it out a wait, here's my advice to reduce it. ?Before you enter their doors, make sure to be turn on your survival skills and focus on two things - name and whiteboard. Immediately avert your eyes away from the crowds, don't be distracted by the dry fry chicken wings on every table (just don't), ignore the noisy banter or the waffing savory aromas, go straight to the board on the wall located on the right side of the door facing the restaurant!! You won't regret it - believe me it's worth the mission. ? Lastly what about take-out? ?Well certainly convenient and empowering to walk past the crowds to leave with arm loads of food. However, broader opinions vary --- I find it just doesn't taste the same, but in all fairness, I have Chinese friends who beg to differ. ?Therefore, you'll have to decide this one your own. Again, as I stated earlier, I come here to eat, smile with satisfaction and say hi to my regular waiters and the owners. It's all about the food and being among others enjoying it as much as you! ?Feel the energy - I always do!

No idea how this place got so popular with so little. ?I think it says a lot about a place if the same menu items are on every table in the restaurant. ?Ok, I'll give them that they've made themselves famous off of their chicken wings, but seriously folks, you know they're available at other restaurants too, right? ?Try Family Fortune on Geary Blvd if you're not up to the 30 minute+ wait at San Tung. ?I don't think it's worth it to wait that long for chicken wings. ?For some reason, I don't think that folks in the North Eastern China, in the San Tung province, would delight at the fact that they've become renowned for crispy fried chicken. The rest of the menu is pretty flimsy as well. ?About 10 years ago, Golden City (with an identical menu) further down Irving Street provided much more in terms of portion size and bang for your buck. ?Too bad that's gone now. ?I guess that could account for why this place is always so busy. ?I just don't get it. ?Their dumplings are puny and mediocre. ?I get better ones from Ling Ling in the freezer at 99 Ranch. ?Their noodles are weak, and cherry pork more bone than meat. ?What gives? Moreover, service is curt and brisk, and parking is near impossible. ?Why anyone would want to spend 1 hour (parking & waiting) to eat here when they can very easily get the same stuff somewhere else is beyond me. ?Completely overrated.

Damn!~ ?Why is there so many people waiting outside? That's cause its that good. ?Let's go somewhere else? ?No, we've committed this far, let's just wait it out. ?Write down your name and the number of your party on the white board. ?I am a master of the "lean and erase"... I will make sure we get sat quickly. One of the few places I am willing wait and wait and wait. Good Kor-Chi-an (Korean & Chinese blend) food is hard to find and what we have here is a gem that every other Asian tells every other Asian who tells every other white guy who bring their Asian date. ?I've seen it many times, but fortunately, the food is good enough put everyone is a blissful mood. Things I always get: Dried Fried Chicken Wings (hella fuckin good, be sure to get 2 orders or it'll all be gone by the time it gets passed around), Sauteed String Beans (crispy and salty), Flounder Fillet with Black Bean Sauce (deep fried and topped with garlic black bean sauce), and Mu Shu Pork. ?And a huge mountain of Chinese-style kimchi which I pour vinegar over to get that tangy taste. ? Their Ja Jang Myung (Dry Black Bean Sauce Noodle) it pretty good too. ?At least better than ZaZang Restaurant's Ja Jang Myung. ?The Seafoood Combo Spicy Noodle also hits the spot on a cold foggy day. ?I especially like this place cause I can order an entire meal in Korean and the Chinese wait staff completely understand every word I say. ? This place is always packed and loud but fills you up. ?The food has become more greasy lately, so be sure to drink plenty of tea afterwards. ?They recently closed for a few weeks to renovate, but as far as I can tell, it looks pretty much the same. ?When your friends tell you to meet them at San Tung at 7:00pm, just go there around 7:45 because they'll still be waiting outside for a table.

Best peanut sauce noodles I've ever had in my LIFE! The dry fried chicken is the 2nd best I've ever had! That's saying A LOT! I discovered this place YEARS ago, and have brought over 20 friends here. They have all loved the dry fried chicken. Of course it's usually on everyone's table here, and there is a great reason why! The shrimp and leek dumplings are great too =). The decor is minimal, but the place is very clean. You never feel like anything is dirty here, and that's a plus. Service here is great too. I've never had a server scowl, or forget anything I've asked for. =) All in all, please come and try some GREAT noodles, dumplings, and dry fried chicken!

I've been to San Tung three times, each on a different day of the week, and I have to say sorry to all the fellow yelpers who do like this place because this restaurant just didn't float my boat. ? First of all the white board name placement is lame. ?I saw people who would just write their names above the other person's name and the waiters are too busy running around to care. ?We waited for an hour for a big table and it turns out they kept skipping us until we requested to be seated. ?Everyone is cranky waiting around and the whole vibe is not pleasant. The food is real mediocre and overrrated. ?Each dish is just slathered with a bunch of thick starchy sweet and spicy sauce. ?I am not sure if the San Tung cuisine is supposed to be that way. ?If so, the cuisine isn't the right fit for me. I think the initial thing that made my experience undelightful each time was the service. ?The waiters just don't care, it's just absurd. I definitely won't be back for a long time, there are plenty of other Chinese restaurants that deserve my money and time.

Food/Quality: I have been here several times and the food here is usually pretty tasty. I have enjoyed the dumplings, as they are thin on the outside, and delicious on the inside. The vegetables are hit or miss as sometimes I think they are cooked with too much garlic. Atmosphere: Every time I have gone here, the restaurant is packed with people, a good sign! The wait always looks like it is going to take a long time, but it usually moves pretty quickly. Tip: The later in the evening you show up here, the shorter wait time. And of course, since it is full of people, it can be a bit noisy. Service: The service is decent, however the servers are usually in a hurry since it is always busy. Value: Price is consistent with what you pay for, and I usually end up ordering so much I have leftovers for the next few days!

Truthfully, even tho everyone I know loves the place, I haven't been here enough nor sampled enough of their food to give them 5 stars. ?The 1 time I went here and the 1 time I ordered takeout were good so thats why I give 4 stars...nothing bad so far from them. Yes, we ordered the chicken wings...and yes, they rock! I chose to order a Chinese/Korean dish called Jia Jjang Myun (or Za Ziang Mein in Chinese...I think....whatever)...it was good. ?I tasted a couple other dishes of my friends and they were good too. The only thing I don't like about going here is their parking...its downright ducks during busy times and you have to wait if you don't go early for dinner or peak times.

Not too much to say that everyone else on Yelp hasn't said about San Tung. ?The chicken wings are delicious as always, can never have enough. Some things people do need to realize (after I have read a lot of the reviews). ?Parking sucks because your on Irving street. ?It is a super long wait because of the popularity. ?They do take reservations and I had one before but still ended up waiting for 1.5 hours. ?I will honestly say they do have dishes that aren't very good, but then again they do have dishes that will keep you coming back. ?Service is not the best obviously, but if you have eaten at many Chinese restaurants you would know that service is never the forte of them, plus I would guess those people work non-stop for however many hours for six days a week for people ordering chicken wings. ?I think I would get grumpy once in a while. In a nutshell if they had perfect service and everything on the menu was delicious, you sure as hell wouldn't be paying less than $10 for most plates yet alone their most popular one. ?I would say you pay for what you get and this one at least by far exceeds the cost when getting their better dishes (chicken wings).

*4.5 stars* Two words: Chicken Wings. That's all you need to know, that's all you should really care about. Honestly, I think that's the only reason why San Tung is the most hyped-up & talked-about Chinese restaurant in SF. But damn, what a great reason. We went at the perfect time: 3pm on a Saturday afternoon. Even though we got a table immediately, I was still surprised to see the restaurant fairly packed. Now that's when you know you got a popular restaurant. And unsurprisingly, every table we passed by had a plate of San Tung's famous dry chicken wings. So this was my very first time, even though this restaurant had been on my "Must Try" bookmark list for ages. We ordered a plate of the fried chicken wings (drenched in what is probably the most addictive sauce ever), hot & sour soup, fried calamari, sweet & sour pork ribs, spinach w/ garlic, & the zha jiang mian (black bean sauce noodles). Turns out that the only dish that stood out in its entirely own league was the fried chicken wings -- with the zha jiang mian in a distant, but still impressive, second. They also have excellent Hot & Sour Soup. The rest of the dishes were pretty mediocre actually. The chicken wings, however, were probably the best chicken wings I've had in America (my favorite is still in Beijing). So I realized my game plan for my next visit to San Tung: order everybody at the table their own plate of the fried chicken wings, and only the fried chicken wings. I know that if I had done that from the get-go, I would've surely given this place 5 stars.

DRY-FRIED-CHICKEN! Oh....oh...soooooo good. I made the mistake of ordering the "wings" once as opposed to the "diced" and regretted it. Too much sauce and took much work. Expensive and looooong waits normally. I order to go and usually get there 10 minutes before they say so I can get the food right as it comes out. I still end up waiting 20 minutes or so...right at the cashier/kitchen entrance...which isn't exactly comfortable. But still... We've order quite a few dishes, but none compare to the diced dry-fried chicken.

The dry fried spicy wings here are better than the ones at SO. ?Both are good but the wings here have a not-as-overpowering white pepper taste. ?We also stuffed ourselves silly with the shrimp and leek dumplings that were surprisingly good considering how unattractive they looked on the plate. ?They look pale and soggy but have a tender skin with good seasoning in the shrimp/leek mixture. ?If the wings and dumplings weren't enough, Husband and I also shared a big bowl of black bean noodles. ?It's good but needed a little more texture. If you go at the right time, you get seated at a reasonable amount of time. ?We went at about 3pm on a Sunday afternoon and the place the was pretty busy. ?The servers are not very nice but you can't expect much from a Chinese restaurant. ?The tables also have a nice greasy/wet look and feel to them since they're only quickly wiped down with a wet rag that has probably been used over and over again. ? Based on the food alone, I give this place 4 stars.

Garlic Eggplant!....MMMM! When I lived in the City, I swear I ate this one a week- I know that's horrible. ?But, sooo good! Lots of garlic mixed with creamy purple eggplant. The serving size is good for two meals (not for two people because you don't want to share this yummy dish). After I ate the garlic eggplant 50 times, I decided it was time to take my family ( Chinese food connoisseurs - like all Jewish ppl). Let alone, at that time I had only eaten one dish, everyone enjoyed it!

How this place doesn't have a sold 5 star average is simply proof that the rating system is flawed. It makes me wonder if people who dislike Chinese food went here and then rated here on Yelp. Their Dried Fried Chicken and Shrimp and Leek Dumplings are two items I would have on my final meal wish list. My only problems are these two items are so good I rarely try anything else... and two, I don't live in San Francisco.

This place is WAY overhyped. The food is no different from any other Chinese restaurants. String beans were delicious though! Chicken wings. Chicken wings. I really wanted to like you since everyone keeps raving and raving about you. Maybe it's because of that I had high expectations. I just really don't like the sauce. Sweet and sour, not my thing. There's this spicy noodle dish that's really good along with the string beans. 3 stars for those two dishes! No but seriously, people need to stop over-exaggerating over these sweet and hard wings.

San tung experience for me is a bit of a love hate. Everything is good and addictive from first bite and when u are done you are uncomfortably full. 15 mins later you notice you are unusually parched MSG attack. So for San tung rookies rules: ?be hydrated. Don't go hungry or you'll burst. Lastly PACE yourself. Order : chicken wings shrimp and chive dumplings and mu Shu vegetables. Share with friends.

My dad went in and put his name on the wait list..there were 10 before us! It was raining, so we (my parents, a family friend, and I) ended up waited in the car for one hour... We even bought some yummy fried spring rolls from the next door Vietnamese restaurant to calm down our hunger. :D It was totally worth the wait, cuz the deep fried chicken wings were heeecka good!!! ?I had 4 pieces, and everyone else had 2 or 3. ?The steamed dumplings, and the jellyfish with sliced cucumbers in mustard sauce were very good as well! However, the soup with the deep fried rice was alright... So was the Mongolian Beef and some of the other vegetables we got.

San Tung... home of the infamous dry fried chicken. They are definitely finger lickin' good, literally. The sauce is a sticky glaze so you have to suck your fingers clean. These are definitely a must-have when you come to this restaurant. Besides the dry fried chicken, I usually get bok choy with mushrooms in garlic sauce (to make me feel like my meal is at least a little healthy!) and white rice. There is usually a crowd of people waiting inside/outside/all sides...watching you eat through the windows as they drool and patiently wait for their name to be called from the waiting list. Parking is a headache at peak dinner times so try to get there before the 5:30pm rush. I like to place a phone order and just pick the food up to avoid all the hassle. WAITERS ON WHEELS: if you are reading this, you should add San Tung to your list of vendors. it will be a huge hit! =) Thanks in advance.

Great location. You heard this many times already-they have excellent dry fried chicken. I got my bf hooked on this along with my friends. Only flaw about this place is that they close on Wednesdays.

Some of the best dishes there are the following: Dry Fried Chicken Dry Stir Fried String Beans Black Bean Sauce Noodles The dumplings are mediocore compared to most of the restaurants I have been too. I've eaten a lot of chinese food, and this is decent for shanghainese. It's way too westernized/americanized. Some of the dishes can be great, but it is overall mediocore. Now the original San Tung was a great restaurant (located to where is now Soh noodles in the 20's avenues of Irving.)

The best day/time to go is for a late lunch (after 2pm) on a weekday.. otherwise prepare to WAIT. They're closed on Wednesdays.

The good: ?Dry fried anything tastes good. The bad: ?Everything dry fried tastes like everything else dry fried. Good food, but you usually leave with a greasy feeling in the pit of your stomach. ?Make sure to drink lots of hot tea =)

First of all, 5 stars for the wings, ?4 stars for everything else. We sat down right away. ?Food was brought out fast. ?When the wings came out, my boyfriend was drooling on the table. ?After he ate one, he had a food orgasm. ?Prices are reasonable. ?They only problem is that they don't come back with your change, so if you need change, you have to wait a while... BUT THE WINGS ARE WORTH IT!

The Dry Fry chicken (offered as wings or diced) at San Tung has reached legendary status in my house. Talk of it's spicy, crispy presence can warm even the blackest of heart. To me, it's the best Chinese dish I've ever had. It's a perfect compliment to the "Go big or go home" attitude in us all. As for the restaurant, expect a wait on weekend evenings, despite that the kitchen works like a finely tuned machine. For this reason, I'd suggest getting it for take-out and adopting my "Go big, then go home" attitude of late.

Once you arrive they bring you some tea and spicy kim chee which is great - love the spice! We had the dry fried chicken which is very crunchy and sweet with plenty of chili peppers - ?yummmy. The chow mein was also delicious - the noodles were tender, a bit fatter then usual noodles and wonderfully fresh tasting. We went early and the place was packed. When we left there was a crowd of people waiting at the door for tables. This is a wonderful restaurant. And the service was very prompt and extremely friendly. I'll definitely be back here again.

I don't know why it has taken me so long to write a review for San Tung... oh wait, I know... because I spend all my time driving from the East Bay to the city to get my next dose of crack chicken (aka dry fried chicken wings), then I wait in line for more chicken, and finally pass out happily because my crack chicken craving is satisfied. ?Wash, rinse, repeat. Okay, maybe I'm not THAT addicted. Although the last time I was there one of the waiters pointed to me and said "I know you! You're always here." ?But that really isn't the case.... I swear! ? Dishes that are a must eat and not overrated: - dry fried chicken wings (duh) - dry fried green beans - black bean noodles - dumplings (if you're into it. they are really good, I'm just not much of a dumpling person so I can't appreciate them as much) I am crazy about the dry fried chicken wings, which is why I call them crack chicken since I think about it and salivate over them almost nonstop. ?It's embarrassing. ?Enough said... I am getting hungry for them again...

Dry.Fried.chicken. If nothing else, go there for this. Best Chicken Wings ever. Their 'thank you for waiting here's some kim chi' is one of the best kim chi's I've had because it's spicy. Some of their other stuff is okay, but dang their dry fried chicken is outta this world. If you catch them during lunch, you can see the lot of them picking apart the green beans. They're not open on Wednesdays. There's almost always is a list of names on their eraser marker board thing. Lemme see, what else, ... order a plate of dry fried chicken - diced or wings, it's worth it. ? San Teezy!

Rating - 4.5 Stars Just as the other 2052 reviews before me have probably already mentioned... Dry. Fried. Chicken. (Dry). [Wings]. Every other dish on their menu just pales in comparison to these chickens. That's how divine they are. In fact, the rating is basically focused and based upon just their chicken. Now be wary my fellow Yelpers, there are two "Dry Fried Chicken" on their menu: (Dry) and (Wet). I have no idea how the (Wet) looks or tastes like, but I'm going to assume that it won't be as heavenly as its (Dry) counterpart (but I could be wrong). Actually, you should probably be more wary of the fact that despite the chicken being advertised as "(Dry)", the wings are slathered with a sauce. However, fret not at that irony! For it is the sauce that makes the chicken so divine! It's mostly sweet with a tinge of spiciness. Combine that with the lightly crisped texture of the wings and you've got the embodiment of heaven as that plate of chicken. Also, if you're wondering, there are 12 wings per plate. As for the other dishes I tried... save your money and don't get the Pork Dumplings. They taste exactly like the ones you would find in the frozen section of your market. Not to mention that it was more of a wonton instead of your conventional dumpling. I don't even know why I got the Pork Dumplings when Shrimp and Leek Dumplings were highlighted in 179 reviews.

Came here because I was attempting to do a dumpling crawl. ?Problem with going to cheap Chinese restaurants is that because everything is so cheap, you have a tendency to order too much. ?That turned out to be the case here. ? We ordered the shrimp and leek dumplings, original dried chicken wings and some noodles (couldn't remember name but they were a thick noodle with dark paste that we had to mix in with the noodles). ?The dumplings were not good at all. ?In fact, they probably were some of the worst I've had. ?The noodles also weren't very good. ?When we saw someone else order them, they looked so good. ?My advice would be to stay away. ?We ended up not eating these two items. ?The chicken wings are another story. ?The wings were EXCELLENT! ?I almost wanted to ignore the other items and give them a 4 star, however, I couldn't let good food cover up bad food. ?If you're coming here, the chicken wings are a must. ? Since we came here on a Saturday night around 8:30, there was a decent wait. ?If you don't mind waiting, then you should be fine. ?Just make sure you sign-in on the clip board next to the entrance.

Best wings I've EVER had. ?No surprise that when you walk in and look around, everyone has a plate of them on their table. ?Make sure you order them correctly. ?They're the "Dry fried dried wings" not to be mistaken with the 3 other versions. ?Their dry fried green beans are to die for also. ?The lunch special is a great deal (it includes soup and wings are an option). ?The shrimp and leek dumplings are delicious. ?The wrapper is made in house. The leek in question is actually chinese chives...beware the post chinese chive eatin' burps : ( ?The pork and cabbage dumplings are pretty bad. ?They have no flavor and having ordered them 5+ times, wanting them to be better each time, they are always undercooked in the middle. ?Their noodle soups are good. ?And the complementary chinese (regular not napa cabbage) kimchee is the perfect combination of salty, sweet, spicy. There's almost always a wait. ?I don't care. ?It's always worth it. ? FYI: They're closed on Wednesdays (just remember, Wally World--Wednesday--no Wings)

It's worth the trip to the Sunset for the famous three words: Dried Chicken Wings! 3 stars for the rest of the menu, but the dried chicken wings deserves a solid 4-star rating for sure. P.S.

A Chinese restaurant that really hits a home run with it's dishes. ?It's not much of a secret amongst native bay area residents, so expect a bit of a line if you are trying to get some food at main hours during the weekend. Their noodles are handmade and really have a quality that is hard to find, dining out. ?I have an affinity for the Noodles with Peanut Sauce. ?This dish is normally served with shrimp, scallops, chopped water chestnuts, mushrooms and peas in a soy peanut sauce. ?I sometimes sub out the shrimp with chicken to change things up a little. ?The sauce is just the right consistency with all the ingredients pulling together for a great aroma. ?This is not a soup noodle dish, so don't expect a broth (I tend to enjoy dry noodle dishes such as pastas and such, so this one fits the bill quite nicely). Some other dishes I recommend include the Black Bean Sauce Noodles (another dry noodle dish, so no broth) and the Beef Noodle Soup (ok, this one does have a broth, just so you don't think I'm completely against wet noodle dishes). ?On a side note, Beef Noodle Soup for me is comfort food. ?It reminds me of when I was younger and hitting night markets in Asia for some good eats. ?I rarely will ever order this in a restaurant unless I know its tasty. The dumplings here are also first rate. ?Outside of home cooking, it would be hard to find something comparable to these little treasures. So let's get to the main event. ?What is everyone talking about? ?The Chicken Wings of course!!! ?There are some options when ordering but my favorite (and possibly the more popular choice) is the Original Dry Fried Chicken (dry) (Wings). There's options for diced chicken and wet version, but the texture isn't as good in my opinion. ?What's so great about this Chicken? ?It's a fried chicken that is covered in a ginger, garlic, and roasted red pepper sauce. ?The end result is this spicy, yet sweet sauce that is loaded with garlic, coated over a perfectly fried chicken wing. ?Careful taking that first bite, chances are its still pretty hot. So if you haven't been, do yourself a favor and check out what all the people in the immediate area already know. ?It's worth the wait and you won't blow a lot of money for food that's fit for an emperor.

This is where I would like my last meal on earth to take place. The food here is soooooo good. The dry fried chicken is cooked to perfection, with just the right crunchiness on the outside and juicy on the inside. The sauce is so freaking heavenly!!!! Green beans, pot stickers..even the plain ol' sweet and sour pork is very good here. The food is hot and fresh. I've gone here earlier in the day and watched them prep-ing the green beans for the dinner rush. The long lines and no parking don't mean much once you start eating. I just wish not so many people knew about it so it wouldn't be so crowded all the time.

Been going here for nearly 20yrs (originally on Irving & 22nd-ish) ...and how many chinese restaurants really last this long...and can keep you coming back for the same signature dishes??? Far & few...here are the reasons why... -original dried fried chicken wings (boneless available for those who care) -shrimp & leek dumplings (all dumplings are amazing) -noodles...both soup & fried are good -mu shu pork is awesome (coming from a chinese girl means a lot) -jelly fish...crazy good, perfectly cooked--crisp with a "crunch" & excellent mustardy dressing mixed with cucumbers

Delish! ?We went with 8 people, so we were able to get a bunch of things and enjoy it family style. ?We got: ? Shrimp and Leek Dumplings: ?I did not try these, but they were gone in all of 30seconds. ? ?Black Bean Sauce Noodles: ?very filling. ?tons of meat and seafood, with hearty egg noodles. ?The sauce was good as well, though a little too much of it. ? Original Dry Fried Chicken (dry) (diced): ?OH MY GOD! ?Like little chickeny bites of delicious fried heaven. ?Don't even think of not getting this dish! ? Szechuan Tea Smoked Duck (half): ?I was not a huge fan of this duck. ?The tea flavor was too strong for me, and the duck a tad too fatty. ?However, a couple of my friends did enjoy this duck and the strong flavors. ? Braised Bean Curd: ?MMmmm. ?Its your basic Tofu and Veggies, but it was done well. ?Satisfying and good. ?I would def get this again. The only difficult thing about this restaurant is the wait. ?It is "first come, first served" with a whiteboard to write your name and party size...and then wait to have your name called. ?Wait, and wait...and wait. ?If you have a large party, you wait for one of the 3 big tables. ?If you have a small party, you wait because everyone has a small party. ?No way to avoid the system. But really, the chicken is worth any wait.

The wings must have crack in them because their ADDICTING! Have had other items on the menu which were good - I'm sure - but they're forgetable because of those darn wings. ?Don't expect friendly service and you'll be fine. ?They're still attentive. ?The staff is probably all about business to get patrons in and out because there's such a crazy crowd so expect to wait if you want to dine in. ?Otherwise, grab-n-go and take it to the park.

Haven't been to the Sunet district and ST for awhile now and I was craving for some dumplings. Went there for lunch today and what a disappointing experience. I ordered dumplings and beef noodle soup. The dumpling came first and they were good, but few of wrapper skins were ripped. This happens when the dough is too wet or uneven filling to wrapper ratio. Then my beef noodle soup came, which I was really excited about it but the noodles had a very strong alkaline taste to it. The taste totally threw off the anise taste in the BNS. It was wasn't cheap at $9. The worst part was when my bill came it was $16 so I left $20 expecting to get back some change. The female waitress took my money and never came back with change. I waited 8 minutes and nothing happened. I totally don't mind giving out 25% tip, but this was lunch, and all they did was bring over two dishes and didn't even refill my water or ask how the food was. I was in such a hurry, I didn't ask for my change. That's fine, as I won't be going back there anytime soon.

I have only ONE suggestion when eating at this restaurant.......get the DEEP FRIED DRY CHICKEN WINGS! These wings are HEAVEN and i promise you after eating the first plate you would want to order another. They are fried perfectly and also the glaze is rich and flavorful enough that you can taste it even INSIDE the wing. Other items i would recommend are their made from scratch dumplings! Very juicy and soft order the Pork and Vegetable dumplings. Garlic Sauteeed green beans are also delicious and perfectly seasoned. I honestly dont think u can go wrong with any item on this restaurants menu.

I began eating here when it was a hole in the wall a few blocks up on Irving. The chef had just left Kirin and opened his own place and it was a slow start. We ate here constantly lunch , dinner any special occasion. As a starving comic the lunch plates were filling and delicious, dry fried chicken, cherry beef, awesome pot stickers and hot and sour soup. Any one who visits me in the Bay will get a meal here. Chicken wings,pot stickers every thing I get is always the same consistent taste as it has since 1986. The waiters here can be asses, hurried and forgetful. ?This is my standard for great chinese food.

We recently had a birthday dinner here with 15 people on 2 tables. We made a reservation so the tables were ready when we arrived. The best dishes we had were the pot stickers and dumplings but the last minute pig ears were a close second! The rest of the meal was average chinese food. The waiters were polite and the food came out of the kitchen quickly. Parking was fairly easy around 5pm. By the time we left, there was a crowd of people waiting for tables. I'd go again just to eat the pot stickers. Yummy!

We came in on a Friday night at about 8 pm. It was packed and we put our names on the list. About 45 minutes later, we were seated and excited to try this highly rated totally popular place. We ordered: Dry fried chicken wings Roasted duck Shrimp and leek dumplings Black bean noodles with seafood I'm sorry, but nothing was that great. We were actually really disappointed. The dried chicken wings had a great texture, but the flavor was just not there. Too sweet and no kick or savory taste. The portion was kinda small too for $9.50. The black bean sauce noodle dish was sooo greasy! The seafood in it tasted pretty good, but they skimped on it. The dumplings, ?I was really excited for. But again, they really skimped on the shrimp and it was mostly that oniony leek filling!! I barely tasted shrimp at all. The roast duck was alright.. dry though and not much flavor. Definitely have had better. In addition to the disappointing food, about 5 minutes after we sat down, one of the waiters rudly tapped my bf on the shoulder and demanded, "What's your NAME?" very accusingly. Once he said his name, the waiter guy just rushed off. Clearly he thought we somehow cheated the list and stole the table. Totally rude. We were waiting for 45 minutes and got seated by one of the other waiters!! You'd think he wouldn't make this mistake after seeing we waited that long. On top of this, they started turning off the lights and cleaning while ppl were still eating. I felt bad for them. Also, the same rude waiter reached across our table to slam the blinds down and turn off the "Open" sign, all without an excuse me or warning. I'm not going back.

Came here strictly for the wings, and they didn't disappoint. Very savory and the portion was good enough to share. It's a small place and it can get busy. They have a sign up board and VERY little room for the waiting crowd. You can hold out for a table of your own, there are a few, OR you can opt to share a table. We ordered the wings and some soup for the vegetables, but the soup ended up not being very good. The wings are the thing.

I arrived at this restaurant which, translated into english means San (mountains) and tong (east); I knew what tong meant when I learned how to play mah-jong ages ago. ?The restaurant is clearly the product of a matriarchy. ?As I walked in, a rather older, gregarious chinese woman was eating at a large roundtable and sort of pointed where I should sit and eat. But when I was seated, it was all business and tea and a little spicy munchy was provided to me before I could say, "kim chee." The quality of the food is very good here because of the high traffic evidenced by constant long-lines outside of this place. ?Yes the fried chicken wings are good (a little too sweet for me but none-the-less good because they are fresh thanks to the intense foot traffic at this place). The spicy combination soup noodle (It's #9 on the menu) is very good to have on a cold day if you don't mind spicy food. ?I loved that and will even say that it's better than the spicy hand pulled soup noodle served at San Wang over on Post St. in J-town. The kim chee like complimentary dish (e.g. similar to how Chevy's gives free nachos prior to ordering, or how Korean restaurants provide kim chee) was similar to kim chee but it was weird. ?It had a tecture like cole slaw or pickled/pepperized radishes but tasted literally like sugar water, but what was weirder is that is was spicy as hell. ?It completely confused me. ?Just imagine drinking a shot glass of habenero sauce that tastes like sugar water. ?That's the kind of weird I'm talking about. ?Maybe I'm pregnanet or something like that. I liked that tea was on the table immediately and that service was fast and didn't muck around. ? Tip: if you want to avoid lines, you might be lucky if you go there at an odd hour like 4pm on a Saturday. ?Even at that time, there was at least 80% occupancy.

This is what you get when you have Chinese people cooking like Koreans. It's a recipe for success. ? And when you come here, all you need to get are the dry fried chicken wings. ?Fantastic, garlicky, sweet goodness dripping in that delicious sweet sauce, it's so good, it's too good for words. The dumplings are fine too, but I've been spoiled my whole life because my grandmother and my parents hand make all our dumplings at home, rolling out the dough, mincing up all the fillings, so even though the San Tung dumplings are objectively good, I think they're just okay.

Yummy Yummy is so lucky to be right next to San Tung because once people give up on waiting for San Tung, Yummy Yummy is the next best thing. The last time I was in SF, I came here but the wait was RIDICK so we ended up at YY. Good thing we actually waited this time, because the food was good!!! I felt a twinge of "GOD FUCKING DAMNIT I DON'T WANT TO WAIT IN A LINE AFTER DRIVING 7 HOURS" but lucky us, we only waited like 30 minutes and they gave us the private room in the back for our party of 7. PROTEIN: Our waiter was cool and was honest about which dishes we should get. We were about to get the dry wings, wet wings, and braised chicken but he just recommend the wings. The dry was much better. It was more "fried chicken-y." The sauce was delish! We also got the sweet and sour pork with brown sauce. Nothing spectacular though still good. NOODLES/DUMPLINGS: My friend got the dry black bean noodles but I prefer the jjajangmyun at the Tustin Freshia. It was too sweet for me. The seafood in it was nice though. I ordered the spicy seafood combination noodles. It was not spicy at all, but the broth was good and it was so satisfying after our long drive and crisp SF weather. Pork dumplings! You get 12 pieces and each piece was awesome dipped in soy sauce and chili.. *DROOL.* I love a good dumpling!

We had some people in town who were craving Chinese food. So, I did a little searchy-search on Yelp! and came up with San Tung. We called ahead to see about reservations. They will only make reservations for groups of 6+. However, the lady was very sweet and put my name on 'the board' for me before I came down. So- when we showed up a couple hours later, we only had to wait 10 minutes or so. Perfect! To get to the point- The food was amazing. Easily the best Chinese I've had in San Francisco. The Chicken Wings? HOLY FUCK! Get them. Just do it. We ordered about 6 other things as well-- most were equally as fabulous. The only items which we weren't entirely moved by were the Pot stickers (really big and doughy. Meh), and seafood noodle soup (bland.. boring). This place is BUSY and fairly loud. So don't go bringing your delicate, great grandmother here on her birthday. Call ahead and make a reservation (for larger parties only) or get your name on the board and wait it out. The food is worth it though. And the service was fantastic. Friendly, fast, attentive.

I always go here whenever I go to Golden Gate Park or to the DeYoung. The noodles are really fresh and tender and delicious. With almost any noodle dish you can't go wrong. They are the best noodles I've had anywhere. I usually order a dish of sauteed spinach or peasprouts to go with it. My main problem whenever I eat here is that I eat the free kimchee appetizer and then it's too spicey and I end up drinking a ton of water to cool my mouth and then I get too full by the time my meal comes.

This review, as most for San Tung, is a mere drop in the bucket. ?Insignificant. ?But sharing is caring, so I'll jump on the San Tung love bandwagon and provide some words. Anything "dry fried" here is beyond exceptional in flavor. ?The dry fried shrimp is my personal favorite, but occasionally a friend will bring a large tray of the dried fried chicken to a potluck and a feeding frenzy ensues. ?Seriously, it's a rare human magnetism that could drive a vegan carnivorous. Worried about the long line? ?When a friend of mine lived in the Sunset we would just call for takeout and walk it home fighting over who gets to carry (and immerse their face) in the bag. ?They were always prompt with takeout orders, and the only time they made a mistake they made up for it with a free additional dish. I will suggest that if you don't have that luxury and don't want to wait (hours) for seating, call for take out, buy some plates, utensils and napkins at a local convenience store and take your dining experience to nearby Golden Gate Park. ?That would be the best picnic, ever.

We were at Cal Academy, and we got hungry. We had had our fill of living roof, spiraling rainforest, and Alligator Gars, and the fish in the aquarium started looking like excellent sushi candidates. Being a Bay Area native and having moved to Portland, Or, I was not about to let a day go in the city where I don't take advantage of the wonderful local fare. Seriously.

So I pulled up good ol' Yelp on my phone (despite protests from our group that the cafeteria food was "just fine, and right here!") to see what was available. This place was at the top of "What's Hot on Yelp" and I was debating between this place and one of my favorites, Tanh Long. The budget won, because, while amazing, Tanh Long is spendy. It was a Saturday, and we had driven into the city (and gotten parking...at Golden Gate Park!), and I was less than optimistic about parking in the Sunset. But wait, two, no, three available parking spots? No wait at San Tung, which stood out on Yelp with its 4 stars and nigh on 2400 reviews? Yes, please! We got "the room." And I checked back at Yelp to find out what to order. Dry-fried chicken wings, black bean sauce noodles, broccoli beef (gingery! yum!) and green beans it is! We also ordered two small bowls of hot &sour soup and won ton soup. Oh! The pork & leek dumplings, too. Wow. The food was phenom. So yummy and delicious. The staff was attentive and kind, and the food was delicious. Did I say that already? Because the food was good. The won ton soup was solid, not too salty, excellent veggie selection, and housemade won tons. The hot & sour was standard, though not so much with the hot, which my children and French au pair appreciated. The broccoli beef was very gingery, which was a nice twist on the standard American-Chinese favorite. it was really good. And the sauce got the kids to eat their broccoli. Win! The black bean sauce noodles and the dry-fried wings were by far my favorite. Those things are worth ordering again and again. The sauce on the housemade noodles was really well-flavored, and complex without being too cloying. The wings reminded me of a gem we have up in Portland, Pok Pok. They make fried fish-sauce wings that beat the pants off anything else I have tried in the same category, but these guys have a close second on their hands. Something like "Pok Pok South." Yum. The staff and restaurant was super kid friendly. We had our own ROOM. Dude. Will definitely make it a point to come here again when I'm back home in the Bay.

hello 2011. In 2010, i ate at san tung. I devoted an hour of my life waiting in the freezing cold to eat chicken wings. Though it was finger-lickingly delicious and cheap, i left awfully gassy; no one wanted to play with me afterwards ?:(. In 2011, I hope to not wait in any more ridiculous lines and order to-go whenever i eat at san tung so I can seclude my gassy self in private quarters. With sincere hopes to change, Alex ? PS. I also ordered hot and sour soup, pork dumplings. The latter being the better choice of the night. PPS. Please also take mercy on my gastric problems.

Extremely long lines for dinner and if it weren't for their chicken wings, the restaurant really doesn't have much going for them. Their dumplings are just okay and their other foods are average at best. They are always so packed that service continuously suffers. Frankly, I don't think it's worth the 45+min wait on a Friday/Saturday night. If you're lucky enough to come when it's empty, it's worth a try. But by no means is the food godsend like most people claim.

San Tung probably doesn't need another rating, but I just want to rave about how amazing their original dry-fried chicken wings are :P Let me put it this way. I picked up the giant serving spoon after finishing my wings and licked it. Three times. Embarrassing my easily-embarrassed husband. Prior to this, the only fried chicken wings I loved were the ones at Mad for Chicken in Manhattan. These were just as good, if not better. Step aside, Mad for Chicken!

San Tung = Chicken Wing Heaven. Bro Danny lived right around the corner from this place. ?So jealous, he could walk here at any time. ?Can Monkey live upstairs? ?This place is packed and with good reason. ?Best to come between the peak times, but still expect to wait. ?If you just want wings, call in an order to go. ? Just by looking at interior, one wouldn't expect much. ?If you look at the huge rack of to-go orders, servers dashing in and out of the kitchen, the full tables and all those people waiting.... ?well, maybe the food is good. ?No fancy decor, no flashy designs. ?Just damn good food and service as fast as possible. ? If San Tung sold nothing but chicken wings at Giants & 49ers games, they'd change an American tradition and make hot dogs the second best stadium food. ?These days, Monkey come for the chicken and the 'Niners can watch us eat.

My only regret I can say about this place is, that I cant fit it into a box when I move back home to Seattle :( Those wings they got here.... F'ING AMAZING. I dont get why there are people complaining about the MSG in those things. ITS ASIAN FOOD. IF YOU DONT WANT MSG GOODNESS, GO EAT SOMEWHERE ELSE OR GET OVER IT. As far as service goes, they are EXTREMELY fast. When I first walked in, I found myself in F.T.N.B. mode (food-to-NOW-basis) and they answered the call. While their wait staff was prompt, I thought they were a bit too pushy and it took several times of asking for more water until it finally happened (I have a big pet peeve about water service when dining out). Other than those minor things, be prepared for a serious food coma after eating here :)

How I describe San Tung's famous fried chicken: crispy, crunchy, sweet, savory, spicy, finger-licking good AWESOMENESS! I love drizzling the finger-licking awesome sauce over white rice =) The restaurant may be very packed and crowd at prime lunch and dinner hours. However, since the restaurant doesn't close mid-day, fill your belly up with a late lunch or early dinner to avoid the crowds. If you do come during the prime hours, kudos to the staff who works systematically like clockwork to churn out patrons without rushing them through their meal. With that said, don't expect to linger around for hours...ah hem

At 5:30 on a Sunday night there was a wait. It was my first time here and I wanted to see what the hype was about so we waited (for 20 mins). I also wanted to see if the food here actually resembled food from San Tung province in China. It didn't but that was fine. The chicken wings are not over-hyped. I wish they were a little less sweet. Still I'd give them five stars. We also got pot stickers and deluxe noodles (da lu mian). Both of those tasted fine, like any other Cantonese restaurant. I was disappointed in the noodle because it claimed to be a "soup noodle" but they dumped so much cornstarch in there it was a bowl of slime. This da lu mian is such a poser that it bring a bad reputation to the noodle for others who've never had the authentic version. I might come back next time to try the ja jiang mian. Along with more chicken wings of course! It's also a bit crowded in here. The waiter bumped his butt into my shoulder a couple of times.

I heard about this place from a friend since she's been here before. She couldn't believe that I'm an avid Yelper and haven't been to this place yet. I recently found out that it was on the 7 x 7 list so after I heard that I decided to try this place out. I came here with really high expectations. My boyfriend and I came and we were kinda confused at first because there wasn't anyone to greet us or ask us how many people are in our party. For first timers, there's a white board next to the door where you just write down your name and the number of people in your party. After that you wait which might take pretty long. Our wait was less than 30 minutes which was good. Once we got seated, our waiter never gave us the menus. We were literally waiting for a good 5 minutes to get the menus considering at other restaurants you get it right when you sit down. ?I had to freakin' raise my hand to get their attention and tell them to give us some menus. Then it took them longer to even get our order which I had to raise my hand again to get their attention as if I'm in Kindergarten. At this point, I was really annoyed. The food came which was shrimp chow mein and sweet and sour pork. They were both good. I loved how the sweet and sour was really crispy and the chow mein wasn't hella oily. We were already finished with our chow mein and sweet and sour that we didn't even get the dry fried chicken yet. Everyone that got there later than us got their chicken first, smh. ?By the time we even got it, I had no chow mein left to eat it with. It was alright. All hype. I prefer Wingstop over the dry friend chicken wings. Don't even bother coming here at 9:31pm cause they will not sit you down at all even if it's one minute pass their closing time. I would have given them 4 stars but their service was whack so minus 1 star.

The chicken wings live up to all the hype. These are a must! Also the black bean noodles are a must too but make sure you ask them to cut the noodles for you because each noodle is about two feet long. If you're expecting a comfortable and relaxing meal, however, it's definitely not one of those restaurants. The dining area reminds me of an eatery; there is a constant flow of people and it's loud. So be ready to eat your heart off and be on your way.

Hot damn their dry fried chicken wings are gooood! ?They are sweet and super crunchy piled high in this uber thick sauce. The wait here is crazy with a mob of people gathered outside the restaurant. ?You place your name on a chalkboard hanging inside the front door. ?If people were shady enough, I wouldn't be surprised if they were x-ing out or erasing names to get seated faster. ? Depending on when you come, parking here is either really difficult to find or you'll be able to park right in front of the restaurant. ? Their other plates are just as good as the wings and despite the wait, the food is worth it!

We were up against one of the most reviewed restaurants in the city on a Saturday night, 7pm. We called in before, asking about the wait. Lady said, "No wait. Just come." So we came. Only to find that there were 9 other groups in front of us. But no biggie; we had to taste the hype ourselves. After 30 minutes of waiting (4 groups dropped out), we had the dried chicken wings, dried string beans, sweet and sour pork, and Mongolian beef for a group of 4. Although everyone raves about the dried chicken wings, which were pretty good, I thought the sweet and sour pork stole the night. I grew up eating tangsuyeuk (Korean/Chinese dish), but this was the best I ever had. The sauce was a lot more potent than the ones I find at other restaurants, but still really good. Probably because most of the pork pieces were half fat. The other two dishes are typical of what you'll find at other Chinese restaurants. San Tung is owned by a Chinese-Korean woman. We go to numerous of these Chinese/Korean restaurants in the LA area so we were disappointed when San Tung is just one of these. How good can it be? It's not extraordinary, but worth a visit. And not bad prices either. Each plate is around $10 and $1.50 for rice per person.

I don't care how much it costs (it's still relatively cheap for San Francisco) and I don't care how long the line is, the chicken wings are the best I've ever had. I crave the spicy, crispy, honey flavors every time I have non-San Tung wings. Other tasty dishes include steamed pot stickers, black bean noodles, shrimp and leek dumplings, and string beans. I was pleasantly surprised with the service on my last visit, since the servers were friendly and attentive. Wow. Maybe it was because it was nearing the end of the night or maybe because we had a table for 10, but they didn't seem in a rush to kick us out either.

It was packed so we waited quietly like everybody else to get seated. Nobody told us there was a waiting list. We finally noticed when more people came in after us all went to the right side of the door and squeak squeak squeaked on the wall and then we saw a whiteboard that has been covered up by the group before us. We went and put our name on the waiting list and suddenly everybody around us stopped talking and stared at us. We put our name on the bottom of the list and the talking resumed. Two seats opened up. We were the only group of two so we were seated before the other groups. But we had to share a round table with four strangers. Seated along the busy, narrow passageway, my head was constantly hit or rubbed by people's backs, butts, purses, elbows, etc. We ordered the hot and sour soup, shrimp and chives dumplings, mongolian beef, and black mushroom with bok choy. They gave us (and everybody else) a small plate of spicy cabbage that resembled kim chi but without the tartness. Food came out fairly fast and everything was delicious. The dumplings were outstanding but they forgot to give us the dipping sauce. It was near impossible to get the server's attention if they don't come by on their own. Dumplings still good with soy sauce. Food was good and not overpowering with MSG, but doesn't cry wow. Service was fast and attentive in its own way. They take immediate notice when you're done eating and will help you pack up your leftover and nicely send you on your way. I appreciated that because a bald spot was underway with all the objects rubbing the back of my head constantly. I will order take-out next time.

San Tung is overrated. Sometimes I wonder why there is a crazy line outside all the time. ?The service is terrible, the food is mediocre and the plates/utensils are DIRTY. ?The only dish I would go back for is the chicken wings. They don't take reservations, so you would walk in and put your name on the clip board. ?There is always a line, so make sure you don't go during peak hours or try beating the rush. Parking is a pain. So if you have a big party, CARPOOL!

I think this place was having an off day or I was spoiled by the jjajangmyun in Ktown and San Gabriel in LA. ?The jjajangmyung is the main reason I came here, and the sauce was very bland, so bland in fact that I had to add table salt! ?This was like the bad scene in Joy Luck Club, where the dude adds soy sauce and mortifies the table of Chinese people, but I'm an asian!!! ?My friend and I were very disappointed. ?The restaurant was jam packed and we had to wait in line for 30 minutes to be seated, and we were contemplating helping them bus tables because it looked like we'd never sit down. ?The waitstaff were overworked and snarky. ?The champong was very spicy and good. ?None of the noodles were hand-pulled, another luxury I had in the San Gabriel Valley (Mandarin Noodle House wuuut!?). ? We ordered the vegetarian dumplings by mistake. ?I saw these tiny little steamed dumplings, and ordered the vegetarian ones but the ones I saw were the pork and cabbage ones. ?Order those! ?Anyone who likes dumplings should know that one should not order big fat steamed dumplings because they don't get cooked evenly and there's too much wrapping, its an awkward amount in 3 bites and not very tasty. ?We didn't even eat half the order. Lastly ?we ordered kampong shrimp, which usually to me, is a breaded, deep-fried shrimp covered in a red spicy sauce. ?The plate that came to us was not red but golden brown, more sweet and not exactly spicy. ?It was good, but not what I was craving, so again I was a bit disappointed. All in all a disappointed Jjajangmyun experience, which is something I take very seriously!

Describing chicken wings as "wet" or "dry" is kind of weird to me, as I associate them with the condition of my son's diaper. Nevertheless, both the wet and dry chicken wings are must-haves. 1 star off: everything else here really reminds me of my son's diaper...

I normally don't go by the Pro and Con type review, but for San Tung's, I will. Pro's: Chicken wings were great. I'm talking delicious. I'm talking, I should have gotten them for my appetizer and dinner. It's true what other yelpers say, get them. You won't regret it. The lo-mein dishes. I got the combination lo-mein and it was by far the best of what anyone else got. It was filling and tasty. Con's: The wait. They don't have a hostess, they work off a whiteboard. Well, the whiteboard doesn't work. My friends and I got skipped over a few times, because the waiter working the board got persuaded by some other people. It doesn't work and I was getting mad. Whatever is served with at the beginning of your meal. It's weird looking and spicy. Confusion. The place is hot and busy and loud. It was a bit confusing and the food comes out quick, so you sit, order, boom food is there, and its hot, then when you're done, your check is there, and then you leave. It's a quick experience. Even though it looks as if I have a ton of complaints about San Tung's, it was pretty good and this is coming from a person that doesn't like Chinese too much. Those chicken wings just made my dinner. They are delicious.

Dried fried chicken wings- yummy, but I can get similar ones at SO which is way closer to my house. Soup noodles with mustard greens and pork- like my grandma makes it, just a tad on the saltier side Green beans- probably one of my favorite dishes to go with rice Dumplings- all their dumplings are pretty good. San Tung has decent chinese food, but the prices are a tad steep. The service has always been quick for me, not sure why all the bad reviews on service. Tip: They are closed Wednesdays and it's always easier to get seats for late lunch after 1pm.

I got a shared table with 2 other small parties. Everyone in the restaurant seemed to have ordered the chicken wings. That must mean something. I got the fried calamari with a sweet sauce. It wasn't what I expected, but it tasted nice. Plus the everything fried rice was amazing. Fried dumplings are a must. They serve you a little kimchee plate to start & tea. While waiting for our food, this little brat sitting at our shared table took my tea pot because he couldn't wait for the servers to bring his. Chinese parents need to tame their "little kings."

1650 reviews and this place still gets 4 stars? You know what that means then right? This must be one darn good Chinese restaurant! After a long bike ride around the city, we were starving so we headed to San Tung. I've been waiting forever to try out this place after hearing so much about their infamous dry fried chicken wings and how crazily delicious it tastes. I just wanted to see what all the talk was about. Believe me, after devouring my first wing, this dish definitely lived up to its hype! The marination, the fantastic flavor and smell it gave off, and how each wing magically stayed perfectly crispy even after being covered in their amazing sauce...everything just hit the right spot for me! YUM! It was the best asian style chicken wings I ever tasted and it was GOOOOOOOD. Really, every single table literally had an order of it. That's how yummy it was. We also had an order of the fish fillet covered in what looked like garlic-y black bean sauce and an order of black bean noodles. Both were covered with way too much of that thick sauce which became very overwhelming for my tastebuds. Personally, flavoring wasn't my style but other tables seemed to have enjoyed it because they all ordered the same thing and cleaned the plates fairly quick. I was already super happy and satisfied with the chicken wings alone :) I was told the place is usually packed every night and you would normally have to wait a pretty long time before getting seated. Luckily for us, we came just in time to snag the last table. 5 minutes after we sat down, there was a huge line of hungry customers waiting to get seated. Whew, I was so glad we beat the rush! Service was surprisingly very good too! I usually don't expect much service or attention when I go to asian restaurants. Here, they actually do more than just acknowledge you. My nose was running, and I used my napkin to wipe it. A waiter then comes by to give me more napkins instantly. They also came back to check up on us a few times and our water glasses were continuously filled. Food came out quick too so that was a plus! All in all, if you havent been here yet, you MUST come and try their chicken wings! MMMmmm

The Original Dry Fried Chicken is incredible! ?(Day 2 cold chicken nearly as good.) ? But my favorite is the Dry Black Bean Sauce Noodles. ?I'm Korean and am always on the lookout for this dish. ?Having grown up in SoCal and knowing a thing or three about noodles in that yummy black bean sauce, I can vouch that sadly, San Tung is the closest I've found here in San Francisco. ?It's sad because the line is everything that everyone speaks of. ?But if you can manage to get there super duper early, then you may be able to get seated fairly quickly.

who would have thought that a place, a chinese restaurant at that, can actually live up to its hype?! to me, chinese restaurants all taste the same; it doesnt matter if its a 3 star restaurant, or a 5 star restaurant, or a restaurant like yank sing that makes their chow fun with friggin filet mignon and crack, they are all the same to me as long as you don't shred out lava or spew out bile; let me tell you though, my hood is CT I grew up there, and my fajjas still a cook there. I've been to many many many many chinese restaurants and let me tell you: san tung wings are that of legends. how the heo do they keep their wings so crispy?! DESPITE the fact that its drenched in sauce? i have no idea. i really dont. it blows my mind. it defies gravity. i can only conclude that san tung' wings do not obey the laws of physics. its that good. get on it. -wifive

If you know me, then you'll know that me and Chinese food have a love/hate relationship. I eat it often so I never crave it and it all tastes the same to me. Except when come here. There's something about this place that always hits the spot. What we usually order: dried fried string beans - pretty good. dried fried chicken wings - one of the best I've had. dumplings - not really a fan of this because they're boiled, so they taste all soggy to me. I like them fried. black bean sauce noodles - my favorite. The sauce is nice and thick. I just wish there was less seafood and more cucumbers. I like the beef in this for some reason. I don't know what they do to it but I think it's tender and good. Portions are pretty big and if you plan on eating here at ?a certain time, better get here early because there's always a line outside. Even harder to get a seat if you have a big group.

Expect a wait when you eat in, but if you're lucky enough to live nearby you can just order ahead and enjoy it at home. The service is typical chinese restaurant, quick and to the point, so once you're actually seated you'll be eating soon enough. I've tried the top three mentioned on yelp but I really like the wings (which deserve 5*) the best out of all three. However, there is an issue with the wings in that there's 2 ways you can order them. It just confuses me since I can never remember which type I like more.

When the boyfriend's away, Cathy will play. And when I say play, I mean eat things that are deep fried. Boyfriend went off for a bachelor party in Tahoe so I rounded up the troops and took myself to San Tung to partake of their delicious chicken wings. These are seriously the best chicken wings I've ever had, buffalos be damned. Yummy, yummy, yummy. I could have eaten a plate all by myself. Their pork dumplings ain't too bad either.

Best Chinese place in town, hands down. ?I used to frequent this place a few years back and just went back for the first time last weekend. ?The wait is still long and you have to write your name on the little whiteboard... but I'm telling you. ?IT'S ALL WORTH IT. ? They say the best things in life come to those who wait. ?And to me, they came in the form of chicken wings, steamed dumplings and a black mushroom and tofu dish. Whenever you mention San Tung it'll make my mouth water. ?Check out it.. you wouldn't regret it. ? San Tung has a special place in my heart also because of the name... San Tung came from the word Shan Dong, a province in China where my father is from, and the same place where they got the word TsingTao for the beer.

I've been here twice. The rumors are true: the chicken wings here are fantastic. I prefer dry fried over wet, and really recommend the dry ones if you come here. I also had the shrimp with lobster sauce. Super good. The place is a tad pricey, the service can be iffy when it gets crowded (which it definitely does, for dinner, so come early!), and parking can be a pain, but it's surely a Chinese restaurant to try! Can't wait to bring my boyfriend here for dinner, he loves their chicken wings =)

The fried chicken wings here really are amazing. ?I liked them both as whole wings and diced. ?The whole wings are nicely fried, crispy and the sauce is so good. ?They really are great wings. ?The diced wings are also very good as well, they're breaded and fried so their very crispy and delicious. However, the other food I had here was only ok. ?The jia jiang mein was good, but nothing special. ?The fried rice and the dumplings were only ok as well. ?There were a lot of good reviews of the shrimp and leek dumplings and I have to say that I was disappointed by them. This place has a lot of hype, and I think it lives up to it. Come here for the chicken wings, but don't expect much from the other dishes.

Friend and I went here for dinner last night... and I'm so thankful she took me here! PACKED is definitely an understatement! Geez... for a weeknight... this place was happening! We had to wait for about 20 mins just for the two of us. BUT service was fast so it balances out. Since it was my first time being there... friend took control of what to order: - shrimp and leek dumplings = Damn... this was delicious! It was light and just the right amount of seasonings. - five spice beef soup noodles = The beef was the fatty portion so I wasn't a fan ... but the noodles itself was good. Friend told me that they make their own noodles in house... just thought I'd share that. The soup was good ... not enough noodles for me... - dry fried chicken (wings) = This came in last... and it was good... I had to ask the friend... why dry if its wet? Oxymoron indeed! The taste was just the right amount of sweetness. Total for the two of us: $28 = nice. I told the friend that I want to go back when I can eat rice (after Lent) so I'll definitely be back to try their other goodness! Just remember: it's gets uber packed!

Their dry style chicken wings are AWESOME! ?(They are even good reheated in the microwave for a snack the next day.) Be prepared for a long wait though (you sign your name on a whiteboard next to the door... and just hope that they figure out the right order!) ?The service is far from great - takes a lot of effort to get their attention, so it's a good thing that their food quality makes up for it! I made a reservation once... but still had to wait almost an hour as they processed through the board - don't know why they bothered taking a reservation.

Came here on a Saturday night. ?There is definitely a long wait so bring good company (which I thankfully had) or some reading material. I only tried a few of the dishes which were generaly good but nothing to yelp about. ?However, the dried fried chicken wings (which were a staple of every table) were fantastic. ?Truly a unique flavor and dish well worth the wait - even if just to know what they taste like. The next question would be - "How well does the chicken travel?" and "What does it taste like the next day?" ?The answer should determine whether this place is worth a trip for take-out for your next super bowl party.

Best fried chicken west of the MIssissippi with a sugary Chinese twist! OMG, simply orgasmic is the only way I can describe the dry fried chicken that is a staple to every order at this joint. It's sugary, crispy, spicy, and piping hot! Watch out when you take that first bite, our you won't be able to taste anything else you eat for another day and a half. The shrimp and leek dumping are also very, very, very good. Not orgasmic-send-you-to-the-moon-dry-fried-chicken good, but it's a nice runner-up. I took my friend here for the first time last year, and he has to go at least once a week for the chicken wings. Word of caution, you will have to wait for a least an hour on any given saturday. There is very little space to wait inside the restaurant, so you have to wait in a cramped little area, huddling over other people's food, while inhaling all the delicious aromas which increasing make you hungrier by the minute, or wait in the bitingly cold sunset fog. I've been told that you can make reservations but have never tried. I think it's one of those urban myth things. Right, and parking always suck around these parts.

I've been to this place soo many times with my family...It used to be really really good..they used to have the best peanut sauce noodles, black bean sauce noodles, homemade potsickers, and fried chicken wings...now, not so much. The potstickers and chicken wings are still really good, but the noodles went downhill. It seemed like they gradually lessened with flavor and now I don't even bother ordering it anymore. One thing that makes me never want to go here EVER is the wait....it takes a while to get a table (although there have been lots of times where I was seated right away) but it definately takes a whole day for your food to come. Never come here if you're starving...you will die (I have been soo hungry here before). But definately come to at least try the homemade potstickers and chicken wings.

I was looking for a good chinese restaurant to take my aunt and her family. The restaurant with one of the highest ratings (according to yelp) in my area was this one, so I thought I'd check it out. Right when we get there, the place is packed and a little noisy. A waiter approaches us and asks how many people are in our party. I tell him and he guides us to this secluded room in the back. Now that's what I call VIP! =] We got to celebrate her birthday, family and all, in total peace and quiet. We ordered the famous dry fried chicken. There is a wet version and a dry version of the dry fried chicken. But, I prefer the dry version. The outside is golden brown and crispy, with a perfect sweet and savory glaze on the outside. This chicken reminds me of the angel chicken at Joe's Excellent Chinese Cuisine on Ocean Ave. Joe's chicken tastes pretty much the same as San Tung's, but it's a little sweeter. I would recommend Joe's angel chicken if you don't like your chicken too spicy. Though, I didn't think it was spicy, some of the people who tried it thought so. Overall, I like San Tung. I've been back a few times now. Though their food might not seem like anything special, their cherry chicken (off the menu) is pretty good. If you're looking for food that is inexpensive and great tasting, go to San Tung's! *Update* I previously gave this place five stars. I'm leaving an extra star because though their food is good, it wasn't worth the experience I had. I ordered take-out from this place not long after my first visit and i literally had to wait around, along with a growing number of people who also ordered take-out, for over an hour. Everyone around me was getting understandably impatient and angry. I placed the order at least 30 minutes before i came down there (not including the time it took me to get there), and the food STILL wasn't ready. It was a terrible experience and I haven't been back there ever since.

I had to change my church from St. Elizabeth to St. Anne (a block away from San Tung) just so I could go to San Tung every Sunday! Did I commit a sin? A big loss from St. Elizabeth with my $7.00 donation weekly and a huge gain for St. Anne's. ?Plus $50 every Christmas. Oh, and a gain of course for San Tung. I always order the dry fried chicken (wings and boneless) and curry chicken and string beans and dumplings :)

OMG the chicken wings. ?So good. ?I so wanted to get another order, but sadly, I did not. ?Everyone else was done eating, so I ate the last chicken wing. ?And even though it had been sitting there, the chicken wing was still surprisingly crunchy and not soggy. ?BONUS!! The seaweed soup was really good, as was the hot and sour soup. ?I don't care for fried rice but the chicken fried rice was much more flavorful than your typical ones. ?We also had the shrimp and leek dumplings and potstickers, but we could have done without those two. I've also tried the dry black bean sauce noodles but it was much too sweet and saucy for me. ?It was sauce overload. ?I couldn't eat it, so that went to waste.

Beware the stale unwrapped fortune cookie with bad fortune bad grammar. walked into this place and every table had dried chicken wings and Asian people. So I had to order it. They are good-crispy glazed wings with a little kick of tang. Kind of like general tsao wings... But good yum yum yum yum (4 yums for me) For experimentation purposes, I tried the wet wings. Spicier.. But not as good as the dry. Also had the green beans great dish... The food did dry out my throat. MSG? I don't know.. But it was tasty. Service is typical Chinese restaurant. Nothing extraordinary.

After hearing the whisperings of "crack chicken" in SF, my curiosity got the better of me and I finally tried Sam Tung. Once with a friend and once with take-out. The chicken was as fantastic as expected. On both occasions (dine-in and take-out) the outside was oh-so-crunchy, almost caramelized by the accompanying sweet sticky sauce. The inner meat is good. I've had softer fried chicken meat but it's not a factor that makes me unhappy. I would totally order this dish on every future visit to Sam Tung. The jja jjang myun (black bean noodles) are one one of the best I've had. I'm not usually a great fan of seafood but the combination of the homemade noodles and sauce are really heightened by the seafood used in this dish. The squid is chewy on the first bite but ease into a pleasant soft texture after the initial chomp. Another dish I would choose on future visit to Sam Tung. I had the steamed shrimp dumplings and I wasn't too impressed. But to be fair, perhaps its because I got these to go? The insides weren't very flavorful and getting them to go wouldn't really change that factor... On following trips to Sam Tung, I personally wouldn't put my money on this when there are much more delicious items to invest in. I also tried the beef and vegetables dish. It was decent. Not outstanding or poor. Tastes just as expected. CONS: Service will be rough and slightly condescending. If you don't respond in 5-10 seconds of being prompted to order, the server will walk away. lol Dinner time waits will be long and there is not much standing area. make sure to write your name down on the white board! OR avoid long waits by ordering to go! :)

Chicken wings, chicken wings, chicken wings...!! Have I mentioned that I didn't like greasy food before going to San Tung? Forget all of that, I can finish that whole portion of chicken wings by myself. After eating that divine, heavenly chickens, I always looked around and ordered chicken wings whenever a restaurant that I visited serve it. By far, San Tung is still the best. Slow service, server spoke little English and easily irritated String beans is so good.... No wonder there's always a line in front of San Tung

We got lucky. There wasn't a long line/wait. We got seated right away and ordered the dry friend chicken wings and broccoli beef (maybe that sounds familiar..my sister wrote a review already). Everything was gooood. When my boyfriend first told us about the chicken wings, I was expecting something like KFC, HAHA. But noooo, it was not like that at all. There was this nice sweet sauce over the nice and crispy fried chicken. Ohhhh, the texture was perfect, and with the nice sweet sauce, was like a melt-in-your-mouth, can't-wait-for-more kind of feeling. They give you 12 pieces, which is a pretty good portion. (I normally don't like sweet sauces, but this, I like..a lot.) The broccoli beef tasted like any other broccoli beef, haha. We just wanted vegetables (with meat). Service was quick and the food was yummy and filling..for me anyway, hehehe. I recommend this place if you're ever in Sunset. Definitely a go-to place if you're out with friends and definitely get the dry fried chicken wings. (:

There is always a line for San Tung but if you don't mind the hour wait, then you're in for a treat. They have really awesome dry chicken wings, dumplings, won ton soups, black bean noodles, and deep fried duck. Everything is covered in this awesome sauce and it's always consistent. I don't think they have the best black been noodle dish but I crave if often and it's the only place I know in the city that makes it (a Korean-Chinese hybrid dish). If anyone knows of other places who make this dish, please PM me. Thank you.

When you go to san tung, you should order: 1. Potstickers: ?HUMUNGO! ?Well worth the money for the taste and size of these bad boysss.. best chinese potstickers i've ever had. 2. Chicken Wings: ?they tie with SO's just because they are both equally good, but different. ?anyone who has had both to compare can agree that the chix wings are both really delicious at both restos.

Came here with my brother, Wong (his first and last name), Patty (but she hates being called that) and 5 of her friends for a little New Year's Eve dinner. ?There was actually quite a wait before we could finally get a table - but not really a problem as it gave us more time to chat with each other. ?Eventually they called our number, and since they made us wait so long, offered us the VIP room in the back. ?It was kinda dingy though, a most pallid, painted off-white room with no wall decor. ?But at least it offered some shielding to the noise of the crowd that night - business was bustling. We had the fried chicken wings - apparently a specialty here. ?I wasn't all that impressed; I don't think wings ever really impress me. ?I mean, I love chicken wings, but what can you really add to them to make them exquisite? ?I find breading just dilutes the glory of the wing, which is the wing meat and skin itself. ? We also had the potstickers, string beans, that jajeng mein. ?Almost all the dishes that were ordered were a bit too hot for my tongue though. ?Note to self: make sure to request a non-spicy dish. ?All in all, I found the company to be more interesting the food itself. ?Which was a good thing. ?A shame we had to part ways after dinner. ?Ah, Libby, I'll never forget you!

I'm Chinese and I hate Chinese food. ?Aside from my Mom's (that's always the case isn't it?), I usually find Chinese food too salty and oily. ? However I LOOOOOOOVE this place. ?Not necessarily because it's "authentic" Chinese but because their interpretation is OH SO YUMMY. ?Their noodles are hand-drawn (a rarity in the bay, most people use packaged stuff) and their sauces are really tasty. ?GARLIC and SPICE is what keeps me eating. ?Kind of like korean fast-food, San Tung uses garlic and sweet chilli in alot of their popular dishes. ?Served quickly and hot. ?AND with proportions and cheap prices that can't be beat. Crowd pleasers: Original Chicken Wings (every table has a plate of this) and noodles w/ black bean sauce.

I can't believe I forgot to write a review for this place after my trip in SF in September. I'm giving it five stars, but really, I hate this place. It may just have ruined Chinese food for me for life! Nothing, I mean nothing, can compare to the dry fried chicken. I don't know what it is, but they do something to that chicken that makes it absolutely obscene. So, so very good. I just wish I could find something like it back east :( Everything else we had was good as well, but they just didn't have the same effect as the chicken. Best chicken I've ever had of any cuisine.

The wings gave me explosive diarrhea and a spastic colon. I've been spray painting the toilet for an hour and definitely cracked some porcelain. Just kidding! The wings, although we did not order them and still paid for them, were really good and my lucky roommate enjoyed many of them. Our actual order was sweet and sour chicken, steamed rice, and pork fried rice ... all of which were very good. We ordered take out and the gentleman was very nice despite the fact that this joint is nearly always packed to the hilt. Good luck finding parking, so take MUNI or just get carry out. The prices are very reasonable and we didn't totally mind paying for the wings we never ordered. I guess he assumed we'd want some b/c everyone else loves them so much. My gf wants me to suggest that you order out whenever possible and then you won't have to wait in line. Also, b/c "it's not like there's a cool ambiance or anything, it's like a dining hall inside anyway." And, as usual, she is correct. San Tung is proof that the Irving strip between 7th and 19th is one of the best places in EsEf to get food of ANY sort. I'd pit our top ten restaurants against any other neighborhood's in a dollar-for-dollar, food coma showdown. The game is on!

As advertised, the dry-fried chicken wings are delicious. However, based on the rest of the food and experience, I won't be back. I believe everyone in the group I was with agreed with that assessment. First food: Shrimp and Leek Dumplings - ?Good, if a little bland. When I put sauce from the wings on it, it improved. If the chili oil weren't at the other end of the spinny-thing, I would have used that. Cold Noodles - Not the sesame ones you expect. Peanutty, and yummy. I did not eat any of the beef in the dish, but word from the other side of the table is that it tasted like liver. That's disturbing. Three Deluxe Spicy Sauce Noodles - Not deluxe and not spicy. These definitely did not live up to their reputation. Hot and Sour Soup - Good, but not special. Dry-fried Calamari - Tasted exactly the same as the the dry-fried chicken wings, but with calamari. My 2nd favorite dish. Wet wings - One person liked these better than the dry wings. I thought the sauce was very bland, and once the wings lost their crunch, they lost their specialness. Now, the service. Nine of us were crammed into a private room and table that would have been comfortable for six. There was a bigger table available that was given to a group of 4. (I guess it's because they were all Chinese and none of us were - because we were there first and had our name higher on the waiting list.) Then the waiters ignored us for about 15 minutes. Finally we got someone to give us a pot of tea and take an order for wings. She ran away before we could order any more food though. When she came back with the wings, she acted surprised and put-out that we in fact wanted to order more food. However, she grudgingly took our order. She was also angry that the pot of tea did not contain enough tea for all 9 of us and she would have to bring another. (Actually it was the worst tea I have ever had in a Chinese restaurant.) I suggested she could bring 2 pots and make fewer trips, and she actually *snarled* at me. (We did not get a third pot either at the same time or later.) Getting cold water and serving utensils was also an ordeal. There are more details along the same line, but I won't bore you. On the up side, when we were ready to go they were clearly eager to get rid of us, because they couldn't bring the check fast enough!

In the words of Rachel Ray, Yum-O! My boyfriend and I stumbled upon this place after checking out the Circus Center a couple of blocks away. ?We came around lunch time, so of course, there was a little wait at this crowded gem. ?You sign your party up on a white board, and to my surprise, we were seated very quickly! ? The reason why - San Tung feeds you fast! ?Your food is ?in front of you seconds after you order. ? We ordered the steamed potstickers (you get 8!), hot and sour soup (which was not spicy enough, for my taste), and these peanut noodles (forgot the name..) ?The steamed potstickers were divine, but the peanut noodles were the real hit.. ?Atop fresh noodles, was a peanut sauce filled with peas, mushrooms, scallops, and shrimps. ?Delicious!

Amazing Dry Fried Chicken Wings!! I've heard all the hype about San Tung and those darn chicken wings for a while though and I had to finally try them for myself. Went on a rainy day for lunch so there was no wait . . . SCORE!! The chicken wings were also available in the lunch special for $6.50 . . . DOUBLE SCORE!! It also came with soup of the day and rice. The sweet honey (slightly spicy) glaze was amazing and tossed with the perfectly fried and crispy chicken wings. I am a fan and I will readily admit that the 7X7 list got it right on this one (^_^)

Oh San Tung...you know how to talk to my stomach! ?You're Dried Fried Chicken is nothing like I've ever had before. ?You always keep me wanting more. The Dried Fried Chicken is definitely the best thing on the menu. ?I usually get diced rather than wings as I tend to be lazy and don't really want to get messy with the wings. ?It's tangy and sweet. ?Just the way I like it. ?Everytime I come here I always order the Dried Fried Chicken, Cold Noodles, Beef w/ Snow Peas, Hot & Sour Soup, and their Garlic String Beans. ?Yumm...just talking about it is making me want to eat it now. LOL. ?Just beware this place gets really packed any day of the week. ?If you want a table right away get there no later than than 6:30. ? After that be prepared to wait. ?Also they don't seat you unless you're whole party is present too.

I love coming here! Even though there is always a line, it's totally worth it. When you get there, write your name and how many in your party on the dry eraser board on the right side of the door. There isn't much room in the front of the restaurant to wait so while you are eating all eyes are on you waiting for you to hurry up and finish your meal. The home made noodles that they have is delicious! As is their kim chi that they give for free (however there have been occasions when it's been too acidic). We always order their dry fried chicken. ?I know that everyone else orders it as wings. I personally like the boneless one more. We also always order the dry fried flounder! MMmmm... writing this makes me want to go there for dinner!

I really did fall in love here... i couldn't believe all the hype. How can a chinese restaurant have such high reviews and its all over just wings!?!? Well... I was definitely wrong. the dry fried chicken wings= AMAZING, so much flavor and crispy... drooling and salivating over it as we speak. The wait was long, it was dinner time= figures. I haven't gone any other times, so I might try to go in the afternoon one day and see how the wait is.

I would give this restaurant a 2.5 stars if I could. Don't get me wrong, the dried fried wings that everyone raves about really are delicious. However, it's the only thing on their menu that's worth writing about. Everything else I've tried here has been mediocre and just "alright". I would name what I've had before, but they were so blah, I've already forgotten what they were. The main issue I had with San Tung was the service. All of the waiters are Asian, naturally, and they're not usually the friendliest. Many of them are decent about customer service, meaning they'll come refill your water say maybe after you've waited about 10 minutes. This isn't TOO bad, I suppose, considering that the restaurant does get really busy. However, there is one waiter who REALLY stands out for his terrible attitude and poor customer service. I'm not sure of his name but he is the larger, heavier set Asian gentleman with a tattoo on his arm. He was extremely rude to the point where it was completely unnecessary. His attitude actually makes me want to take 10 stars away from the wings (which I wont, cause they really are pretty damn good). We came with a party of 5 and were seated at a table for 4. So naturally, the table was a little cramped and the settings didn't quite fit properly. Anyways, when this waiter was putting down the place settings for us I happened to move mine so that it would not be on top of my friend's setting. This apparently is a restaurant faux pas since the waiter just glared at me until I moved it back. His attitude was infuriating and every time I go back he is still so rude and unwelcoming. Needless to say, I try to limit my San Tung visits to avoid dealing with him. If you don't want to work there buddy, find a new job. Overall: Dry Fried Wings (5/5) Other dishes (3/5) Service (0/5)

Oh Heaven! Homemade, authentic, well-seasoned. Each dish is different and interesting. Dry fried Chicken wings are a favorite. The Mu Shu is so good and fresh too! their noodles are all homemade. Their dumplings are the freshest you will ever have. Everything tastes so fresh here, the wait staff is generall efficient and the owners are often present. ?This is a gem!

MMMMMMMM I am lover of all things fried, and their chicken wings...I swear are the BEST chicken wings I've ever eaten! Chinese and Korean people know what's up! YUM! I usually just eat the fried skin on chicken wings, but here? I even eat the chicken meat! YES that good. Last time we ordered a plate of their Dry Fried chicken wing (wet) lolz I like saying it...Yummy chili garlic sauce *mmmmm* and I ate 10 wings..my boyfriend ate 4...Hell yeah I felt like a pig with me chowing down like there's no end but whatever...we had 2 leftover for his breakfast...that smelled absolutely sinful at 5 in the morning... Their home made noodles are really good too! We got the tomato beef one, didn't really taste much like tomato beef..But whatever, its good! Pay that extra buck! Got a fried flounder in black bean sauce...eHHHHHH that was okay. It came out first too, so it was kinda weird to eat without any starches. The wait is absolutely horrible...Its just all in the timing I guess...But I don't mind waiting for good food! Parking is a hit or miss. Its always packed so don't come hungry cuz you'll be waiting a while..but you'll leave extremely happy =)

The food is basically what Korean people call Chinese cuisine in Korea. ?The restaurant was full of young people in their 20s. ?Maybe it's the taste of the food, maybe it's the price range. Dried fried chicken wings had the perfect ?balance of sweet, sour, and spicy. Black bean noodles is pretty much as good as it gets in the U.S. Got there on Friday night around 9. ?Waited for 30 minutes to seat 2 people.

This place had been given raves by my niece for months..."their chicken wings are the best"....yeah, yeah, yeah..what does a 20 year old know besides Justin Timberlake's birthday. Well, surprise surprise...this place (and their chicken wings) was pretty damn good. I really miss this style of Chinese-Korean food. It brought back fond memories of my other favorite restaurant, the ORIGINAL Kirin on Geary Blvd bet 25th and 26th. I miss Mr. and Mrs Chu's (I hope my memory served me well on their names) hand pulled noodles, his dried fried chicken, cherry pork, pork with pickled greens and dry fried string beans...but most of all I miss their hospitality. ?Mr. and Mrs Chu spoke only Korean and Japanese, so I'm still wondering if these owners are relatives of that family, when most of the waiters appear to be Cantonese. I digress...on to San Tung. Well, we had the signature dry fried chicken wings, cherry pork, pork and pickled greens soup noodles, pork dumplings, and lastly the dried fried green beans. This definitely brought me back 25 years, also curing my ED to boot (and luckily, it did not last longer than 4 hours). I can't wait to try it again, perusing the menu for more familiar dishes of my past (ie. garlic eggplant, mu shu pork, and lastly the Hot braised fish...I just hope they have this). In spite of what others have said about service, I thought it was quite spiffy. I could swear the food came out 10 minutes after we placed our orders...as my kids would say, "it was faster than fast food". Waiters weren't chatty, just efficient, perfunctory, somewhat robotic, but gets the job done...heck, ?all of the things you would expect from a Chinese waiter at at a Chinese restaurant (I'm a Chinese man, so I know from experience)...its all about the food, man. I can't wait to try this place again...I just better shut my computer down and start looking for a parking space now...sigh.

I love San Tung! ?The chicken wings are really tasty. ?Make sure you dip them in plenty of sauce. ?The other things that are good are: ja jang myun, the five-spicy hot beef noodle soup, and the cold noodles. ?The cold noodles are pretty peanut-tasting, but the flavor is still good. ? The wings, of course, are a staple, but they do have other foods that are delicious as well.

The dry fried chicken is by far the most amazing tasting chicken wings I've ever had. I swear there must be crack in it cause I'm addicted. This isn't the only good dish they have either, according to my friends the rest of the dishes they serve are also good. Expect a long wait but trust me it's worth it.

Four years ago, when I first left home for college, I was conned by two people off Craigslist into living the crappiest crap hole in existence. The only good thing that came from it was that the apartment was located next to the most divine fried chicken place ever. I would come back from class, pop by the place for half a dozen wings, plop down in the middle of my dungeon and anguish over the cruel hand dealt upon me by the housing gods. But even in the depth of my despair, after one bite into those juicy wings, the room would seem a little brighter, the cockroaches a little cuter, and the world a little better. Ever since then, I've been trying to recreate that experience. And San Tung's fried chicken wings come pretty darn close. The bf and I went on a Monday and we had to wait ~25min for a table (it was probably busier than a usual weekday due to people having President's Day off). We ordered: Everyone's favorite crack chicken (heavenly) Mongolian beef (one of the best I've had in the Bay area) Shrimp and leek dumplings (meh, everyone's grandma could make better ones) Hot and sour soup (a little better than your typical Chinese restaurant) So all in all, like the 2000 something reviews before me, come here for the fried chicken!

Other than the not very polite service, and the long line, i like this place. ? San Tung serves Americanized Chinese food, but that doesn't mean it's bad. ?Dry chicken wing and the dumpling are must to order items. In fact, the dumplings are better than most of the "Chinese" Chinese restaurant. If u don't mind the service, and the long wait, ?it's the place to go!

I'm not a huge fan of Chinese food, but the boyfriend wanted to try the wings here REALLY BAD (big surprise...) It was Thurs at like 130 pm and it was packed! Their waiting list system is weird and not a lot of room to wait. -The dry fried wings the hyped up, most delicious wings out there. Or so I was told. Don't get me wrong, they WERE good and better than most places, but for as hyped up as it is I expect better. It kind of tasted like hooter's spicy garlic wings. Boyfriend agreed. -The rest of the food--average Chinese food. Oh, and the waiter told me he gave my drink to a different table that's why I didn't get it before my meal -__-;;

I just love fried chicken (especially with rice). ?And San Tung is the only place for my chicken fix. ?I can't go here with at least two (2) plates of their chicken! ? The instant I tasted their Dry Fried Wings, it reminded me of a spicy and crisp kettlecorn-like ?blend--. I was like, "Holy Shit, where have you been all my life--you little chicken wings!?!" ? Fried to a perfect crisp and then glazed with an uncanny sweet and spicy sauce, these wings changed my life. I prefer getting the wings, not the boneless style wings. I like getting my fingers messy in their addictiing sauce. The Black Bean Fish is another fried favorite. But I'm not going to get into that. Occasionaly, I order some chow mein and string beans to balance out my chicken meal. In fact, all their dishes are prepared nice and hot. ?But I haven't tried a dish there that's as addicting as their wings. The environment is clean and located in a suitable area. I would have given San Tung a "5" alone just for serving up some good friggin chicken. ?However, the service has been slow on non-busy days. ?And ?when it gets busy, it gets real busy. ?Expect to wait at least 35-45 minutes.

My review here is based solely on the singular item I had the good fortune to sample; and doesn't take into account the service or the restaurant facility itself (I had take-out for lunch) or any of the other food items they have available (haven't tried 'em yet). But I've come here today to confirm what the masses have been saying all along: ?the fried chicken wings are the best around! In fact, I'd go so far as to say, that if God does indeed exist, and if God has a sex and is a woman, then the experience of placing San Tung's addictive fried chicken wings into one's mouth would be akin to suckling the voluptuous and most gracious teat of dear Mother God for her sweet and savory, life-sustaining elixir. (And added for further effect: if Mother God was a crack whore who was feeding her crack-addicted baby its next fix.) Yep, they're that good.

I have been coming to this Chinese Restaurant for about three years. ?And I am still addicted to what I like to call, the crack chicken, also known as dry fried chicken. ? It should be known that this is a Chinese Restaurant with some Korean influence, if that matters to some of the more die hard eaters. I don't think I have had a dish at San Tung's that I didn't enjoy. ?Every item I can think of has been nothing short of delicious and at a great price. ? I think you can get away with 3-4 dishes for under $35 that will feed more than 3 people. ?Everything here even looks amazing, I started eating the black bean noodles by looking around at what other patrons were eating one day. ? So let me tell you the best dishes (my favorite): Pork dumplings beef noodle soup black bean noodles dry fried chicken wet (diced) green beens broccoli beef chicken and asparagus (seasonal) kung pao chicken [I am starting to feel like I am naming off the whole menu] Other noteworthy dishes that are good, but nothing to yell over: Sweet and sour pork fried rice cashew chicken I think I should stop there.. my mouth is beginning to water.... Its also important to mention that this place is always packed.. at all business hours there is a wait. ?They have a white board name and number of party system that is somewhat aggressive, you have to watch out to make sure no one else who is waiting squeezes their name above yours or moves the queue around. ?If you're a small party you will definitely be seated faster, but you will also be asked to share one of the larger tables with other groups of people. ? I still think this place is worth any wait. Furthermore, the wait staff here are incredibly fast and friendly and know how to keep this busy moving. Overall, I am going to go out on a limb and say that this is my favorite Chinese Food Restaurant of all time.

Since everyone raves about this place, I decided to try this place a few times in the last year. So far, some of their dishes that are note worthy are: Stir fry green beans Pork and chives dumplings Stir fry beef dishes Mu shu pork As far as their wings.... it's a bit on the sweeter side for my taste. It's dry wings with a coat of sticky sweet tangy sauce. It has some heat but not much at all. If you are gonna come here, be sure to come early otherwise you will be waiting for a good hour at least for your meal since it is so popular.

At this point there is over 1300 yelp reviews of this restaurant, I have nothing new to add, except I have a trick to getting a seat. ?The problem being is that it is good food and priced well and once again, the food is amazing. Seating can be a short wait. To avoid the wait, eat alone, it is what I do. ?I don't bring people here, I don't want to wait. ?So if your party is larger than "alone", I recommend, but if you are alone, go at once, you'll get a seat and eat in no time.

So, I moved again. This is the 4th time in a year. I used up all my favors with my friends and they were getting sick and tired of moving my ass around the city. But I had one ace left to play. "I will buy San Tung for lunch." They could not get to me fast enough to move my stuff. They worked like dogs running up and down the stairs (yes, it is a second story apt.) and after 4 hours of this they were ready to eat. They had not eaten all day in anticipation of San Tung. I went and ordered about $100 worth of food, mostly the dry chicken wings and we pigged out. We had so much food left over I was still eating it the next couple of days. Thank you San Tung for getting my back. Also, a little history lesson. San Tung is not necessarily a Chinese place. It ?is a Korean stye Chinese restaurant. I grew up in Southern California in the OC and we have quite a large Korean population there. So naturally the Chinese living in Korea who ran restaurants followed and opened new restaurants here and kept making food that the Koreans liked. A lot of people seem to have a hard time understanding this concept. San Tung may be Chinese in origin, but it is Korean in nature. The fact that they serve kimchee at the start of the meal should be a giveaway. My parents always took me to these Chinese places and I was raised on these foods and I was puzzled at first as to why other Chinese places didn't have the kind of things I liked (like the dry chicken wings and black bean noodles) and why their food tasted so bad. Then I realized that I was eating in the wrong places. When I came to San Francisco, I searched and searched for a Korean Chinese restaurant and almost gave up, until a year later I drove by San Tung and saw the Korean lettering and knew I found one. One by one I started taking my friends here and showed them how good it was here and how awful it is elsewhere. Now they are hooked just like me and we couldn't be happier.

I've been going to this place since I was a little girl and there were 2 of them on Irving street. I would go to the smaller on by Wells Fargo Bank. ALWAYS start off with the steamed shrimp dumplings! Then an order of zha zhag mein (not sure if that's spelled right, probably not) but it's the Black Bean Sauce Noodles. I've tried this dish at other places, but they never compare to here. Then of course the Original Dry Fried Chicken (dry). Damn...want some now!

Here's another addiction that's hard to pass up sometimes. Took off one star for the super hard to get parking and long lines, and sometimes shady tables and customers. But not a big deal ok!? I would go back any time! OK! here we go. Our friend was raving about this San tung place in SF, and brought us here. Wait was long, but quite exciting! It was a Sunday and it was almost 2pm. Still, frequented by customers. The surrounding restaurants were almost empty and it hyped up the place more. The tables were so close to eachother. We were seated super closely to this other old couple. Whatever. We're hungry. He ordered for us: The famous San Tung dry fried chicken wings with the sauce on the side, fried rice, Black bean noodles, and potstickers. They had kimchi on the side too. Yum! So i guess it's a Korean-Chinese fusion of some sort here? YUM!!! Potstickers were gooooddd! and everything else was heavenly! I've never had the same kind of friend chicken wings and sauce ever ever ever!!! Sweet-spicy goodness!!! and the black bean noodles... I'd lick my bowl if we weren't too close to this couple who kept looking at us. LOL! SUPER YUMMMMMMMMM!!!! After this... I was craving for it like I was pregnant, even taking pregnancy tests to see If I really was. LOL! But yeah... I understand the hype!

Came here for lunch with my family. It got super crowded very quickly for lunch. Get the chicken wings. They are great. The beef noodle soup was very good too. The beef and noodles were nice and tender. Also the soup had a nice flavor. The leek and shrimp dumplings were tasty. The pot stickers were ok. I think they fried them with a bit too much oil.

I was introduced to this place through a family member and ever since then we have been taking new friends to this place every time we go. ?I try not to hype up the chicken wings too much but its hard not too! ?If you like crispy, sweet and savory dishes you'll loveeee the chicken wings. ?Theres enough reviews about the wings that I won't go on any further about them. Just go and TRY IT! Aside from their headliner dish the rest of the menu is pretty standard for a chinese restaurant. ?The last time I went service was SUPER fast (I think because it was crazy packed and they may have cooked a whole bunch of the same dishes at once). ?Besides the wings we had the hot and sour soup to start which is a bit on the salty side for my tastes but my friends like it. ?We also had the string beans which I think are coated with a sauce similar to the chicken wings so I thought they were pretty tasty also! This place gets insanely packed. ?On fridays and weekends I would recommend putting in a reservation (they accept reservations for parties 5 or larger and you have to show up on time) or you'll have to wait 30+ minutes for a table.

San Tung's fried chicken wings are the best wings I've tasted in awhile. They have the perfect crisp to them and the flavor is just right! Their Honey Walmut shrimp compliments the chicken very well with a plate of the combination fried rice. Although, I would go there just for the wings if I had to!

Review for the dried fried chicken only; Pretty good. I ordered it to go to avoid the crowd and it was prepared quickly. The chicken was really crispy; and was covered in a sweet/spicy sauce. Worth it to go for the lunch specials; not sure if I'd pay 9.50 again for an order of wings alone just because the sauce gets a little overwhelming after a couple wings.

The place must have some really good Chinese food since there's customers coming in and out. I had no wait time luckily but I was wondering why there were so many people on a sat afternoon when there was no dim sum! Fried chicken wings are really good! My friend talks about them all the time he loves them more than hooters, wingstop, and kfc! Tons of regulars! prices are normal for Chinese food but not super dirt cheap. Parking was easy since its on the other side of the not so busy Irving. highlights: best chicken ever

Everyone was hyping up their chicken wings so I was ready to be disappointed, but even with the standards set high, their chicken wings were pretty damn good. It's saucy on the outside and crispy and juicy on the inside. Just yummmm! We also got their dry noodle with peanut sauce which was good too and their green beans. yum! We ordered take out, but I definitely want to try dining in.

this would be the fourth or fifth time i've eaten at san tung and always, the dry fried wings are the star. but there is usually a long wait to be seated and a couple of times, it took awhile to get served, as well. the last time was sunday. we got there early for dinner - maybe 5pm and were seated immediately. plenty of tables. we were a party of four and the other half of our table wasn't filled for another ten minutes or so after we sat. but in those ten minutes we were also completely ignored. no order taken, no water brought. just the spicy kimchee that gets delivered along with the menus - which is a bit cruel when there is no water or rice to quell the heat. that other party of four at our table had a different waiter. while we were at the fifteen minute mark (and they were at five), both of our orders were taken. their chicken wings showed up immediately. the first thing we got took about ten minutes longer and was a vegetable dumpling appetizer (we asked for steamed and it was fried but at this point, almost a half an hour in, we were too hungry to complain). i asked our waiter twice for the wings before they came out. and the rice. he was dismissive, never apologetic, and always in a hurry to get away from us. eventually, we had the majority of our order but were still waiting on two entrees. our waiter never came. i grabbed the seater guy (since by now over an hour had passed and the dry erase board/long wait to sit was going on) and he came back with one entree and said the other one was already brought out and "they couldn't find you" so it went back to the kitchen and got cold and they were remaking it. for the record: dry fried beef sucks. the meat is so thin that it's practically non-existent with all the breading. some of the pieces i swear there was no beef, only breading. it wasn't until we got the bill (from the seater guy again) that our waiter re-appeared and acted like nothing was up. i'm sure he got the hint though when we received absolutely no tip from us 2 hours and 15 minutes after we first sat down. i realize this is not the norm for the place. and i do enjoy eating the food. but 4 star food that you have to wait and beg for isn't worth any stars in my book. ?i can't afford to play russian roulette with my plans again by risking another meal at this place. we nearly missed our movie date and our dining companions got on the road an hour later than anticipated. ain't no chicken wings worth two hours and all the hassle.

even though i am chinese, i HATE eating chinese food in a restaurant. BUT i have to admit San Tung is good. yes, GoOd! There is usually a line for this place but it is definitely worth the wait. The prices and portions are reasonable. The steamed dumpling are okay but the dry fried chicken legs are a must have, juicy and crispy. Also, try the dumplings: Shrimp and leek, pork, pot stickers. The noodle selection is excellent as well. And of course their dried fried chicken is a signature dish and must order. The food and prices are great. Just be aware that this place is always packed.

Extra star for 1) being cheap ($11 pp), & 2) accommodating our large party (10 people!). We ordered a ton of food - spicy & regular dry chicken wings, fried fish, cherry pork, string beans, tofu, and potstickers. ?It was a very filling meal. ?the chicken wings lived up to their name - freshly fried, hot, and crispy with a sweet-savory sauce. ?The fish and the pork were pretty much prepared in exactly the same method and came in the same sauce causing my friend to comment about the lack of non-fried meats at the table. ?Not like anyone cared! ?The potstickers were really large with a doughy crispy wrap. Service was fast and efficient - we were out in less than 2 hours. ?Good times, good times.

Dried fried chicken (aka Crack Chicken)! Super tasty and addicting. Basically these are wings coated w/ some sort of sweet sauce. You can eat it on its own. Asian Buffalo Wings! String beans are worth getting. The dumplings looked tasty. Had the Zha Jian Mien - decent. Place is semi-divey, loud, and very chinese even though there are Korean influences on the food. Closes at 9:30p at least on week days and so be sure to get in your orders before the kitchen closes. Take out is an option. Hint: you can call in your name to be put on the wait list.

They should change the name of this place to San Tung Chinese Restaurant #1! ?Because it is number 1 in my book.... and the fact there is no San Tung Chinese Restaurant #1..... Moving past that the wings or fried chicken with out bones is the best! ?Great food at great prices with poor service... what more can you ask for! My only tip is... the Cherry Pork is just sweet and sour pork! ?It is a good sweet and sour pork.. but nothing really cherry about it!

I LOVE THEIR CHICKEN WINGS!!! I've tried my fair share of chicken wings, and I have to say hands down, San Tung makes THE BEST wings in my book. It's sweet, crunchy, and also has a kick of spice in it. If I lived in SF I would probably get fat since I'll make numerous trips there as much as possible. Mmm... just thinking about it right now is making me drool... They are also known for their string beans, it's something about the sauce they have. My bf and I have tried to recreate it, but so far, we haven't been successful. btw, go there before dinner time because there's always a mad crazy line once dinner time hits!

The only good thing about this place are the chicken wings. On the menu there are dry and wet chicken wings, but when you order chicken wings, the waiters automatically assume you want the wet chicken wings...and they are correct! The wings are juicy and packed with flavor. Other than their wings, I guess San Tung is noted for their long wait. And that is true. On this visit, I waited 45 min. just to try their wings. I ordered some dumplings and a noodle dish, but the wings were by far, the best I've had.

I am taking off a star because I always have to wait. ?BUT I keep returning even though I always have to wait. ?This is pretty huge because I hate waiting! :) The dumplings are great, but the chicken wings...really? ?I think there might be crack in them, because they are just that addictive and good. Make sure you keep an eye on the white board so you dont get skipped in line.

Solid 4 stars for San Tung, which I believe is the best Chinese restaurant in the city for the price. Here's a little known fact about San Tung...they accept reservations if you have 6 or more. Sometimes you can get it down to party of 5, too. Best things to get: * Fried chicken. These are the best fried chicken wings you'll ever have. Get them dry...they're more flavorful than the wet ones, and they're less messy (less is relative, though). * Braised flounder. Really good stuff. I'm told it's also a Korean dish. It's fried and has this somewhat spicy sauce on it. * Green beans. I personally don't think it's anything to write home about, but this is what they're famous for. Do not get: * Pork and cabbage dumplings...kind of bland. Maybe the leek ones are better. * Pot stickers. Nothing too extraordinary here...I mean, they're just pot stickers, right?

Get there early to sign-in.. at peak periods [usually lunch or dinner] the wait could be up to an hour or more depending on the size of your group... but it's so worth it. It's street parking too, so unless you have a motorcycle you might want to allot some time for space hunting. OH! Don't forget to bring a jacket if you're not from the area because it does get chilly. Fried chicken [diced or wings] and string beans. Bring good company, order a beer, and eat the most orgasmic chicken on the planet.

You simply must get the chicken wings when you go here. I just went and asked them for their "famous chicken wings" and they knew EXACTLY what I meant. Those wings are soooo good. It always seems to be packed though. We went on a Monday night and still had to share a table with some other people. The service was rushed and impersonal.

I recommend only getting the dry fried chicken here, not the wet ones. This is 4 stars. I would say though, that 99 chicken in santa clara has much better fried chicken, but San Tung's sauce is mind blasting! Combine 99 chicken and San Tung's sauce, you have awesomeness! I tried the rest of their chinese food, I'd only give it like 2 stars. I give this place 4 stars because of their chicken, but overall its not that great. Parking is a little tough, but it's SF.

Okay, definitely not your typical Chinese restaurant. 1. ALL the workers don't speak Cantonese 2. When my mom tried to order some "typical" Chinese dishes, the waitress simply shook her head and said "No." ? 3. They charge you $1.50/person for rice. ? Regardless, my family and I ventured off and tried new things at San Tung tonight. We noticed that EVERY table had the Dry Fried Chicken Wings so we ordered TWO plates! ?The waitress recommended the Dumplings so we got those too...I thought they tasted just fine but ?my aunt claims "you can get better ones at Sunset Super." ?(eek!) ?We also got the Mongolian Beef, Eggplant, Tofu with Vegetables, Dried Friend Shrimp, Pork with Bean Curds (totally disappointing) and Three Spice Noodles. ?My favorite dish was definitely their noodles! ?It looks spicy, but it wasn't...and their house-made noodles were the perfect texture! ?We should have gotten TWO bowls! The service wasn't that great but hey, it's still a Chinese restaurant. ?What did I expect? Even though we had some totally excusable misses at San Tung the Fried Chicken and Three Spice Noodles will definitely keep me coming back!!!

That dry chicken wing is good! ?Not overly sweet, very subtle but flavorful that's why you can eat a lot of it! ?Crispy but juicy, yumm! ?I think I like the wet one better than the dry one but either one is good! ?The other food they good, chow mein, green beans and mongolian beef was okay... chicken wings is the reason why you're there. ? Service... I was expecting for a typical service where the staff are just there to give you food and that's it. ?But their service is actually good! ?They listen to you, they apologized when they forgot to give something right away, they talk to you and they're nice! ?That's big in my book! ?

I went here on 7x7's top 100 recommendation. ? Yes, the dry fried chicken is delicious, but I thought the rest of our meal was just okay. ?We had the Black Bean Noodle dish and Won Ton Soup. ?The noodles were too long which made it difficult to serve and eat. ?The soup was good but not anything special. The place was constantly busy, we had multiple waiters and once we got a table we were in and out pretty quickly - which is the way they want it.

I've heard so much hype about this place, so I was expecting a lot. We went there on a weekday to celebrate my friend's birthdays. I would have to say the food was OK, nothing really stood out. If I had to choose a favorite, I would probably pick the dry chicken wings. However, there are millions of Chinese restaurants that make chicken wings, just as good. Pot stickers were good, maybe cuz they were twice the size of a normal one. Eh...I've had better Chinese food.

We ordered WAY too much food. There were four of us dining - two pescatarians and two omnivores. For a Friday night, we found the wait to be pretty good. -Dry fried chicken wings - delish of course. My Korean friend said she'd had better, but she still managed to eat 4 of them. ;) They were sticky and sweet. -Garlic seafood noodles. These were really messy and a bit too fishy smelling/tasting for my liking. -Braised halibut in spicy sauce. This was really outstanding. Very saucy - so good. -Mixed veggies and tofu in a black bean sauce. Very yummy. -Shrimp & leek dumplings. My favorite item with tender outside wrappings and distinct and clean tasting ingredients. -Veggie pot stickers - the first ones that came out were pork. Luckily I was the first one to bite into one and since I eat meat, I wasn't freaked. but we find this commonly, that the pot stickers often end up being meat. Supposedly the plates were mixed up. We asked them to just cancel the order, but they brought us the veggie pot stickers anyway. They were darn delicious. -Garlic spinach. We ordered this because we needed something green and not covered in sauce. Good call. Something that I noticed that no one else seemed to was a prevalence of white pepper in at least 4 of the 6 dishes (did I mention we ordered too much?). This wasn't a bad thing necessarily, just interesting. The service was pretty random - we had three different servers while we were there, but that's kinda fun too. I enjoyed the chaotic (seeming) atmosphere, the bright lights and the minimal decor. We were here to eat. One other small drawback was a lack of veggie options which makes it tougher to visit again, but not impossible. All in all, I really enjoyed myself here and am wavering between 3 and four stars. Will visit again to confirm my rating!

So the situation was a little strange. ?Maybe. ?It was the BF, his ex-girlfriend, and me. ?She blew in on a wind from Utah, for something or other, family oriented in the south south bay. ?And we were going to go to dinner. ?So we did. ?Here. ?We chose this place over ShangHai Dumpling King, much to my chagrin, because she'd had a surprised dim sum thing with her parents. ? But it was good that we did. ?On a Monday night, around 7pm, there was still a wait of 30 mins. ?Even though there were only a few ppl in the queue before us. ?And even then we had to share a table. ?No matter. ?i ordered too much food as always. ?And it was all delicious. ? We got the dry fried chicken wings. ?Ok. ?Again, see the first review. ? 5 spice beef noodle soup. ?Eff-freaking-fantastic. mushu pork. ?The BF ordered this because he didn't know any better. ?But it was surprisingly delicious. ?The cabbage was chopped finely without being limp. ?The wood ear was not soggy or slimy. ?The pancakes/crepes were not limp. ?They might have been freshly made. ?The sliced green onion was fresh, the hoisin sauce was sweet. Sauteed spinach with garlic. ?Just like mother would make. ?Except better! ?Sorry mom. ?Somehow it was just perfect. Sauteed string beans. ?No change. ?Consistent as with the prior review. Pork Dumplings. ?I wasn't going to let this opportunity for chinese food go by with SOME kind of dumpling. All in all, more than enough food for 5, cost was around $65. ?There was not a hint of heaviness, greasiness, no msg-poisoning. ?I was incredibly happy with this place. ?As a chinese person who would rather not eat chinese food at all than to eat crap chinese food, this place made me think that it was not an impossibility. ?For years, I thought the only non-home made chinese food available for purchase was stuff that makes my stomach turn. ?This place is fantastic. ?Not sure if it's worth the wait, but it's good enough for a chinese person. ?What does that mean, anyways.....?

I went with a group of 15 people and even though we had reservations and everyone arrived on time as requested we didn't actually get seated for quite some time. Once we were seated we were provided with super yummy and generous portions of Kimchi. We ordered 20 dishes consisting of Black Bean Noodles, Combination Chow Mein, The Infamous Chicken Wings, Combination Fried Rice, Pork Dumplings, Tomato Egg Flower Soup, Seafood Rice Soup, Garlic Spinach, and Combination Vegetable Dish. Since I viewed Yelp before trying this spot, I expected it to be FANTASTIC. Although, it was good Chinese food. I didn't feel like it was the best. Although I'll probably attempt to go another time and order more things I like incase it may have been the specific dishes we ordered. Everything was pork, and I'm not a pork fan to begin with. I liked the dumplings and would like them much more if they were the veggie or shrimp. As for the infamous chicken wings... they were super sweet and not original. The waiter was a comedian and was attentive to our needs when it came to tea and water. Like I said, I'll attempt to give it another try one day and when I do I'll be sure to update if needed. My mother being Chinese, I grew up around constant and delicious Chinese food that this just didn't catch my taste buds too much. Still better than the majority of places in the bay area. Just not my cup of tea!

I've been twice and both times only ordered one thing : chicken wings. ?So this review will be quick-n-dirty. They were delicious. ?A little sweet, a little spicy. ?"Fingerlickin'" good is what I would call them. ?The drumettes were nice and meaty. ?When I was eating them I would find myself endlessly reaching for more. ?If you like Asian style chicken wings, then this place is definitely the one for you. If you live in the area, or just don't want to wait, call ahead and get your wings to go. ?It's a much simpler way to enjoy the gooey goodness. More stars may be in this restaurant's future but I just can't merit giving any more on one dish, no matter how good it is. ?Well, unless it's "I need a cigarette" good but this doesn't quite hit that point. ?It's more like, "damn good".

Upon meeting up with my very hungry friends after a quick workout, we quickly determined that we would grab something Taiwanese in the Sunset area. ?San Tung came highly recommended from one friend and, after a quick Yelp check, decided to sit in for some grub. We decided to go ahead and share a few of their most popular items such as the dry fried chicken and their black bean sauce noodles. ?We also tried their cherry pork as well. ?I could immediate see when the noodles and chicken was so popular, but I found the pork far too sweet. ?In fact, I left the restaurant with a headache that was presumably caused by the MSG content of the dishes. Nevertheless, the experience was generally a good one and I would recommend it to anybody in the area to try. ?If you stick with the favorites and you can't go wrong!

They didn't get our order right: instead of giving us the dried fried wet chicken wings, they gave us another kind. The service was fast, but cleanliness was sacrificed. Still, the wings were good. We had the classic sweet and sour soup for the cold day (we managed to finish a medium bowl between the two of us), pork dumplings and the so-so szechuan duck dish. You can order the chicken wings to go. You may also have to sit at a larger table with other strangers too, that's after waiting at least 20 minutes for a table. I want to give it 3.5 stars, but it's hard to go wrong with the quick service and the tasty chicken wings.

We saw that this place was a must eat for dried fried chicken wings on the 7x7 100 top SF eats so we decided to drive out to Irving Street to give San Tung a try. On a Thursday night, parking is usually tough on Irving but we lucked out as someone was getting take out from San Tung and leaving as we pulled in. The place was pretty packed and there was still a small wait of 4-5 tables ahead of us. The head waiter (is he the owner?) is great. ?He's in charge of the seating, ordering, you name it, he's doing it! No wonder he's drinking a venti Starbucks in the open kitchen! For a Chinese restaurant the place is really clean! It's also full of patrons that I know don't live in the area and I did see a few locals but for the most part it was college students and a relatively young crowd. We ordered the sizzling rice soup, wet black bean noodle, fried dried string beans, and the dry fried chicken diced. The hits: Fried chicken was really good! A perfect combination of salty and sweet and a hint of spice! It reminds me of Kyochon down in LA which I am currently craving. The diced version comes in little pieces so next time we will try the wings to see if there's a juicer flavor. The string beans were also perfectly fried and seasoned which I couldn't stop eating. The misses: Sizzling rice soup-we had the best one at Fang Restaurant so we were disappointed with this one which was watery and not very flavorful. The wet black bean noodle was also missing a little flavor although the noodles taste very fresh. In short, we would definitely come back again. Would definitely order the dry fried chicken (every single table had some version of this) but this time as wings and would be curious to try some of their other dishes like those huge pot stickers we saw someone else eating.

Wanted to see what the hype about the chicken wings was all about, so I came here for lunch on a Tuesday around noon. ?No wait, but at first they made us share a table. ?So awkward. I hated it especially because the ladies that were already at the table kept whispering amongst themselves like we were criminals or something. ?Snagged a newly-empty table for two and was much happier. ?Although I think another party thought that was their table and gave us the stink eye for "stealing" their table. Anyways. ?We ordered Won Ton soup, Dry Fried Chicken Wings, and Three Seafood Noodle Soup. ? The complementary kim chi was rather spicy but I didn't eat much of it. Won Ton Soup. ?Don't know why I expected it to taste like HKstyle wontons. ?Don't think of them as that type of won tons. ?They are more like dumplings with a thick skin. ?The soup has veggies, mushroom and shrimp. ?It's tasty. ?A small comes with 4 wontons. ?I liked it but it was definitely surprising. Chicken wings - I'm glad there were a lot of them, but they weren't as amazing as I anticipated. ?Maybe it's because I grew up on chicken wings and just hearing "chicken wings" elicits specific emotions/tastes. ?These were very sweet, kinda tangy, sort of spicy, and hot. ?I think the taste is very unique (as opposed to hotwings from KFC or Wingstop) but I've definitely had better Chinese-style chicken wings. ?They were a little too sweet. ?Don't get me wrong, I definitely enjoyed them. ?But I fail to see why they are on the 100 things to eat in SF list. ? Also am a little puzzled over the dry/wet dry fried chicken wing deal. ?The wet one seems to come with some vegetables. ?How complicated and confusing! ?They kind of assumed we would order the dry one, which is fine, but yeah the confusion is still there. ? My favorite order was the three-seafood noodle soup with vegetables. ?So good. ?The seafood (shrimp, scallop, calamari) was fresh and succulent. ?The noodles were really tasty and for a lack of a better word "authentic". ?Love! ? I'd come back here to try more things, but probably would not order the chicken wings again. ? Prices were moderate.

Everyone calls this the "chicken wing place" *Do the chicken dance as you say this*. I have one Chinese friend who swears this place is the "dumpling place". Either way though, I had a VERY satisfying meal! I had both the wings, AND the dumplings. The wings were very meaty and I loved the sweet glaze sauce. It was so good that I put the leftover sauce on top of my rice.. I know I know, that is a very non-Asian thing to do, but I couldn't help it! The dumplings were pretty good, but to be honest, I can't tell the difference between good dumplings and GREAT dumplings. It did definitely taste handmade, though! I also had the black bean noodles, which were fantastic! Plate-licking good! Good, cheap, and filling. I'm sure I'll be going back many times in the future!

DRY FRIED CHICKEN WINGS! They're the reason I come back. My boyfriend and I usually spend about $30 here for the both of us. We always order the Cold Noodles (Beef, shrimp, tofu, peanut sauce, noodles), Shrimp and Leek Dumplings, and the infamous Dry Fried Chicken Wing. They definitely nailed the taste of the wing and its crispy. The wings are about $9, the dumplings $7 and the noodles are about $9 too. Whenever my coworkers and I crave wings, we come here during lunch for their lunch specials. They range from about $6-8 for rice ?and a choice of entree, including dry fried chicken wings. My co workers tried the dry fried shrimp and I would recommend it too!

My wife and I went here for dinner after wandering through Golden Gate Park on the recommendation of the guide book. We had sea scallops with noodles in a black bean sauce and dry fried chicken. Both were amazing and and we enjoyed them both for dinner and lunch the next day. My only complaint was that the service was so-so and I felt like I was intruding on their restaurant. Admittedly we were one of a very few non-Chinese customers and I don't mind some of that when I'm at a dim sum or hole-in-the wall restaurant, but I like the service to be a little nicer at a nicer place.

This place was SO delicious! Eating at San Tung almost made me want to move to SF. I told everyone around my table that my supervisor was probably looking at his watch, waiting for me to come back, because the longer my visit here is, the less likely I'll want to go back to Ohio! I really enjoyed the chicken wings (of course), the eggplant dish (nice, smoky flavor), a pork dish, the fried green beans, and the jia-jia mien (noodles). Dumplings were great too. Overall, I loved my experience. Great food, great company, great weather...

My family and I decided to come here after my dad had read a few of the reviews. ?Having been to So when they were still on Irving, we had an idea what to expect, but that was years ago. ? We go the fried chicken, both the dry friend and the wet fried. ?While i like the flavour of the wet one more, i loved the texture of the dry fried. ?we couldn't finish both orders at the restaurant, so we took them both home. ?the Wet ones got soggy while the dried ones were still crispy when we got home. ?Both were really good and I think you should get them both to give it a try, the downside to that is that you'd have more chicken! I got the cold noodles with the peanut sauce. ?The noodles were firm and a bit chewy. you could tell from first bite that they were fresh and made on site. The place is a bit small and being a full grown boy that i am, i like my space so i felt a little self conscious the whole time because of it. ?But really worth a try!

We came here for one thing and one thing only: the dry fried wings (#74 on the menu). ?And holy cow, those wings were dang tasty. ?The skin was perfectly crispy, the meat was perfectly juicy and the hint of ginger mixed with the garlic, the subtle kick of the peppers and the sweetness of the sauce allowed these wings to easily meet the hype set by my friend. ?Easily. We also ordered the beef fried rice because our server seemed irked by the fact that we were only ordering the wings, but we should have just stuck with the wings. ?The fried rice was disappointing... and that says a lot coming from me because if you know anything about me, it's that I can eat fried rice 25 hours a day, 8 days a week, 53 weeks a year. Just go with the wings here.

Grabbed some take out with the family for dinner. ?The place is crowded and busy as other reviews have noted, but the service for take out is pretty rapid and easy with a call ahead. The dry fried chicken wings are excellent. ?The wings are fried and have a crisp crust while continuing to keep the meat moist and tender. ?The mix of drum sticks and wings are served with a thick and flavorful glaze. ?There are sweet and spicy noted in the glaze without an overpowering heat. The noodle with peanut sauce is another treasure. ? The noodles freshly made rather then reconstituted dried noodles. ?Noodles are soft with a bit of tooth left after cooking, in short well made and prepared. ?The thick sauce with a strong peanut flavor and seafood mixed in tastes wonderful and coats the noodles well. Other dishes such as pork and snow peas and fried rice are standard dishes but still well made with clean and crisp flavors. ?There is no heavy overly oiled taste, rather the dishes are crisp and bright in their individual flavors. In short great food and don't miss the wings. ?I would continue to eat here on a regular basis if I lived in the area.

I've been here twice. Mark C and I came here on a Tueday night around 8 and we had to wait 20 minutes. I came here the second time with Karen W on a Saturday night at 6:30 pm and we probably didn't get seated till 7:45 pm. That is a LONGGG wait. Minus one star for that and the mediocre service. But despite that, their food was pretty awesome. We got the fried chicken wings, the wet zha jiang mian (black bean noodles) and the shrimp and leek dumplings the first time, and it did not disappoint. The fried chicken was crispy and the noodles were just the right consistency. The dumplings were also very good, though I think I might have had better. The second time we got the cold noodles and dumplings. The sauce was a little sweet, but all in all, still good. Would definitely come back again, but not on a Saturday night for sure.

(My overall restaurant experience was a 4-star one, but for just the Dry Fried Chicken Wings, I'd give it a 5-star.) I went to SF to go to the California Academy of Sciences with my family and decided to ask some of my friends at SF state for their recommendation of local Chinese, Japanese or Seafood restaurants. One of my friends suggested this place and said their Dry Fried Chicken Wings were among the 100 top eats in SF so I suggested it to my family. We got there around 1 and the wait was just short of 30 minutes, as there were quite a few people in front of us which is generally a good sign. The restaurant is small and there's a wait list on a white board where you sign in when you come in. We ordered the pot stickers, chicken wings, pig ears and the "Happy Family" dish. I'm not a huge fan of the pig ears, as it is a bit too authentic for me, and the Happy Family dish was a bit small for $16 and too salty but lacking a bit of a spicy/garlic flavor that it should have. Pot stickers came with 6 and were crispy and juicy. The Dry Fried Chicken Wings didn't appear dry at all. They came slathered in a slightly tangy sweet sauce which was DELICIOUS. However, the layer underneath the sauce was crispy indeed, without drying out the juicy chicken. These are hands down the best chicken wings I have ever tasted. You'll get 12 for $9 and it's worth every dollar!

Well damn. ?The dry-fried chicken wings are like 10 million stars. ?Everyone knows how good they are. ?No, it's not just hype! ?I was smiling as I savored each bite of chicken. ? The other dishes I got were garlic eggplant and fried bean curd with pork and willow tree fungus. ?Decent dishes, but not very Chinese-y in my opinion. ?Sort of bland, but not disgusting or anything. ?I guess I just expect more from them because the chicken wings are the shits. ? My friend and I decided to share a large table with this lady that was already seated there. ?Smartest decision ever! ?Got seated immediately while other people had to wait for a pretty long time. ? The chicken wings are worth the hefty price tag, but the other dishes, not so much. ?Just get the chicken wings, forget about other dishes! ?Also, beware of their kimchee. ? The spiciness numbs your tongue right away instead of slowly creeping up on you so it's wayyy more intense than other kimchee I've had. ?Them chicken wings definitely hit a spot that I didn't even know existed. ?;)

3.5 stars. I came here with a group of 8 for dinner on a Sunday night. The place was packed, but luckily, they ended up seating us in the private room in the back, which was nice. We ordered the shrimp dumplings, pork dumplings, sizzling rice soup, five spice beef noodle soup, black bean sauce noodles, 2 plates of original dry fried chicken wings, and sauteed green beans. Overall, I'd say the food was decent. My favorites would have to be the dumplings and the chicken wings. The beef noodle soup also had good flavor. On the other hand, what was up with the black bean sauce noodles?! I know so many Yelpers recommend this dish, but something was just off about it -- maybe they forgot to add salt? It was quite bland. The green beans were also just okay. Service was fast though, so no complaints there. -L.

I've been coming for years and I gotta say, the service is always a hit or miss but the food has been pretty much the same...good! ? Ok, I never expect too much off the service from a Chinese restaurant, so given that, they are quick to get your orders and your food generally come out pretty quick too. ?If you're lucky, you get a smile, otherwise, they shove the food onto your table. ?But I come in simply for the food and not the service. Now, the staple: Shrimp and leek Dumplings Potstickers Five Spice Beef Noodles Dry Fried Chicken This is like Chinese comfort food for me. ?I don't need to say anything more. ?Oh yah, the complimentary kimchee is always spicy, but I find it to be very tasty. ? Be prepared for a wait during the weekend and dinner time. ?The place gets packed pretty quickly, but the turn around is not that bad either.

Always. ALWAYS a wait so be prepared. ?Especially for larger groups (5+), don't count on eating here if you are on a schedule. It's loud, kind of a mess and a bit divey. Don't waste your time being polite if you want some kind of service or attention. ?Join the crowd and just yell across the restaurant. ?It's possible also that you share a table with another group. We always (and so does everyone else) come here for the dried fried chicken which is finger licking GOOD. ?They are covered in this syrupy dark sweet sauce that leaves you digging around for that last lil piece hidden underneath the extra sauce. The dumplings and Zha Jian Mien are also must haves here. ?Aside from that really, ?I haven't been awed by the other food items. Due to the crowd, we often opt for take-out which is a nice option.

This was my second trip to San Tung and I was even more impressed. ?First off, I was impressed by the fact that I could read "Shan Dong" with my elementary Chinese skills (did not realize it the first time). ?Secondly, it was impressive to me (that once we were seated) how quickly the food came out. ?They clearly expect most customers to order their famous fried dry-style chicken wings and have multiple batches ready to go. ?After putting in our order, we had a plate of wings on our table in less than 3 minutes--ridiculous! ?I guess this clearly helps with turnover and to move everyone through the restaurant. ?We also got the string beans, and the bean noodles (more of the Korean style--on the sweeter side). ?I was surprised there was a some shrimp and other seafood in the noodles. ?Not bad, but I'm tempted to try the five-spice beef noodle soup next time. The staff was fast paced and seemed to all help bus/wait on the multiple tables at once. ?Even though they are clearly trying to move you along, they are attentive and courteous. ?This isn't something you always find at a Chinese restaurant. ?Definitely worth the wait if you are not in a rush--a table for two on a Friday night around 7:50 was about 40 minutes. ?So long as you are in good company, time flies by.

i'm San Tung reviewer #1858 and this place is as good you've heard. ?I've been here many times, usually for weekend lunch because it gets very crowded at dinner time. ?I went there on a Sunday night recently at 5pm and the wait was over 45 mins so I left! There is a teeny tiny banquet room in the back but don't know how to book that! ?They don't take reservation and you just show up, go straight to the white board inside, write your ame and # in your party and go for a short walk in the area. ?Lots happening a few blocks up around 10th and 11th aves. ?Just make sure you can gauge how long the wait is going to be by looking at the board. ?If they call your name and you're not there, then you are SOL! ?Your name gets erased and you're back to square 1. Everything on the menu is awesome. ?Dry chicken wings,dumplings and any noodle dish are my faves. ?I've ordered the sauteed green beans a few times and it's really way too sweet for my taste. ?If they added less sweetener and more garlic, I'd be all over it! Service is okay. ?Sometimes, you just have to be aggresive and wave down a waiter. ?They don't mind as long as you're not rude! If you haven't been there, check it out. Don't bother with take out because the fried chicken wings lose some crispiness when stuffed inside a take out box!

Dry Fried Chicken!!! Pretty much that is the greatest reason to come here because that dish is AWESOME. I personally like the diced version more than the wings. both versions have their pros and cons. the wings have more meat but the diced version you don't have to work for the meat however there are a decent amount of pieces that are just fried batter or have little meat. still good tho, but not the healthiest. other stuff that is really good is noodles in peanut sauce, their dumplings are tasty, stir fry green beans are delish! their quality of food certainly does not lack. i just wish there was better parking but it is sunset so it sucks no matter what.

If it weren't for the hype, I would've given this place four solid stars. My expectations were not met due to the hype. For a Chinese restaurant in the city of SF, i expected more, especially with all the great reviews! This is one of the most starred/reviewed Chinese restaurant in SF, and i thought the food was pretty good--up to my Dad's standards. We ordered the raved dishes 1)Deep Fried Chicken (dry)--unique crunch to it! 2) Black bean noodle Although I will be back in the future, I probably won't crave it.

For the first time yesterday, I went here for lunch. My friends and I tried getting here before the noon rush and to our lucky surprise, got a parking spot right in front (score!). Unlike dinnertime, there wasn't a wait and we were seated immediately. We ended up ordering two orders of the chicken wings and one order of dumplings ($6.75/a dozen). We didn't have to order rice, as it is included as a lunch special with the chicken wings. The only thing I wasn't that happy with was for each order of chicken wings, they only give you 6 pieces ($7). Because we were seated in the back near the opening of the kitchen and cash register, I felt like service was the best out of all the seats because if we needed anything, we could easily catch the waiter's attention or they can fulfill any of our needs without asking. perfect.perfect. perfect!

It's Christmas Eve and we planning on ordering a tray of chicken wings. So dilemna do we order from SO which is right by our house and about 3 dollar cheaper per order or do we trek out to the Sunset? We decided to go old school and go to the sunset and order from San Tung. We've been here many times and never fails to please. The Jang jang mien black bean noodles are always solid. The dumplings and chicken wings also always delicious. And once again the wings were good. Slightly peppering but a good balance of sweet and spicy. Good balance of wings to drum part of the wing. We sampled a few when we got home and declared yes good decision but we got a huge craving to eat some now but this was for tomorrow so what do we do? We place an order from SO for the chicken wings. Mostly the wing part not to many drums and way more pepper in the sauce for the wings. Good none the less but definitely different from San Tung. My gf overwhelmingly prefers San Tung. All in all San Tung always pleases hence why its always busy. Love that place and one of the reasons I enjoyed living in the sunset back in the day.

Yes people love their Dry Fried Chicken Wings but there is so much more to this place. Whether it is their dumplings or noodles, San Tung is just a step better than their competition which is a lot of restaurants around the Sunset. Back to the chicken wings...they are unbelievable. Perfectly fried and coated with a sugar glaze that is sticky and ooey ooey gooey. There must be more sugar than chicken in the dish but it is worth the cavities. The noodles are equally amazing. The Three Deluxe Spicy Sauce Noodles, made with seafood in home-made noodles was so out of this world good. It was creamy almost like a Chinese Carbonara. Awesome food, quick service, will not disappoint.

This time around when visiting San Francisco, I made it absolutely necessary that I hit up San Tung. I need to try these chicken wings for myself. My party of 5 came around 8pm and we had to wait around 40 min. I don't like the idea of writing your name on the WHITE board since people can easily manipulate the waiting list. The GOOD stuff. We initially ordered 1 plate of Dry and 1 plate of Wet Fried Chicken Wings. Midway through our meal, realizing the utter goodness of the Chicken Wings, we decided to order another plate at around 9pm. As we were placing our order, the waiter told us that the kitchen was closed and we wouldn't be able to order it. Five minutes later he comes to tell us we're able to order the chicken wings and they'll come out. We were all thinking, Dude make up your mind. Eventually it did come and it was nice and hot and we were happy. The crispy, saucy chicken wings definitely hit the spot. After my first bite, I could care less about the impact these wings would have on my arteries. I'm young and I'm gonna live eating good food. Anyway I wished we could really have just ordered the Dry Fried Chicken Wings and not anything else. The Sizzling Rice Soup and Garlic Eggplant was ok. I will not order the Jia Jang Mein or the Shrimp Dumplings again. The Jia Jang Mein wasn't very flavorful and the Dumplings tasted downright weird. The white rice here is sub-par, but rice is a necessity otherwise even a waterfall wouldn't supply you with enough water. I also didn't like that we were all seated on one side of a table forming a semi-circle at a circular table. Despite these shortcomings, I would come back again, but really this time only for the $9 Chicken Wings.

$10.40 fried chicken wings never tasted so good. After receiving intelligence from numerous sources citing dangerously mouthwatering chicken, I came in just before 6pm on a monday night to investigate. Slyly issuing my order to the guy dressed as a waiter, I flashed my silver discover card, and promptly secured the transaction. I was in and out within 2 mins; Although I was slightly disappointed in the chicken due to getting caught up in the hype of this place, the customer service i got bumped this place to 5 stars. The 12 pieces of sweet, spicy, and garlicy goodness were strategically placed in my tummy within seconds of getting home. The crispy shell along with the sticky sweet and spicy sauce will keep customers coming again and again and again. The best fried chicken Ive ever eaten. If wingstop made a chinese flavor, im thinking this is how it would taste like.

I've ordered take out from San Tung before but Friday night was the night that we decided to eat in with the family. There were a lot of people waiting outside so the long list of names was no surprise. Yes we waited about 40 minutes but that's largely due to the fact that there were 10 of us. Parking is quite difficult to find so if there's two of you, I suggest one of you put your name on the list especially during lunch and dinner time. The restaurant is quite plain actually, not really much to talk about there. They keep it simple, a little too simple. Service was fast and friendly. No complaints. On to the food. I've had the pleasure of having their food for take out when the Giants were playing the world series and wouldn't miss the game, actually I missed a few innings just to pick up the food. Anyway on to my experience tonight. We ordered the following dishes: String beans: Flavourful and crisp Eggplant: Wet but not too soggy Chicken Chowmein: Was just alright Mongolian Beef: good but a bit dry Beef Brocolli: tasty and crunchy Chicken Wings(3 orders): Was off the hook. I've had 'em before but to have it fresh and still a bit steaming hit the spot. Nice crunch to it and is packed with so much flavor. To sum it up I'd come back here for their wings and string beans. Lovely time with the family tonight!

Consistent food and efficient service. ?If you arrive and there's no table, just put name and number in your party on the white board and wait either inside or outside on the sidewalk until your name is called. Favorites include dried fried chicken wings, steamed pork dumplings, and the string beans. The only con for me - the pot stickers, both steamed and pan fried. They're just not very good.

Our family friends knew about this place and for dinner one night, we came and tried to get a table. After dropping folks off to wait and go get parking, we decided just to order to go. The place is PACKED! Everything was SOOOO GOOD. I'm Chinese and don't eat Chinese out that often, but this was the real deal. The homemade, vegetable dumplings were AMAZING. Vegetable dumplings are extremely hard to make tasty, but San Tung delivers. That is definitely the test of a restaurant - to make vegetables taste FABULOUS and they pass the test above and beyond MANY. The sauteed spinach was also great, as were the other dishes, but I would definitely go back and get the dumplings. One of the most memorable meals, even if it was take out, that I've had in SF.

Saturday night...yeah yeah, the wait is hell. The food...really good. Just not worth that hellish wait. Chicken: don't get the sauced up ones...get the original. They still have some sauce on them, but are way crispier. Could have been spicier, but guess I'm spoiled on the Korean fried chicken. The pot-stickers are huge! You must get them! I'll come back, but only if the wait is under 30 min.

A few colleagues told me the wings here ?were a must try. When I saw they were ranked #3 on the SF 7X7 Top 100 Things to Eat in SF I decided I had to go. A few of us went late on a Thursday night, had no trouble getting a table (parking is always a whole other ordeal however). We ordered the wings first (the waiter chuckled, he knew it was coming) the black bean noodles, the pork garlic noodles, and the shrimp wontons. I am not the hugest Chinese fan, but this was just delicious. The wings were so tasty, my mouth is watering just thinking about them. Crispy underneath with a sweet, thick, tangy sauce. The garlic noodles and shrimp wontons were also very flavorful. The black bean noodles were not my favorite, but I think this is just not my flavor profile. Ambiance was nothing special, service was friendly but a tad slow (it was also the end of the night), and the prices were reasonable (10-20 per dish). It is a must try, next time I will order two plates of wings.

Hands down the best dry fried chicken you will ever taste. The fusion of flavors tied to its crispiness will make your mouth dance. It goes hand in hand with some green beans and their fried rice. I am also a fan of their egg drop soup, even their black mushroom with bok choy is delicious. Every dish my bf and I have ordered there has not disappointed yet. Not the best place to have a quiet conversation (which is why I rated it a 4) as the restaurant is always buzzing with loud conversation and chatter (and is a little cramped) but could be just be the sound of very happy eaters :)

Sizzling rice soup. Mooshoo Pork. Dry-fried wings. Shrimp and Leek dumplings. Jjajangmyung(blackbean noodles). 5 things we always always order whenever we come here. ?Other dishes get added to the bunch, but those 5 are the key players. this is one of the few restaurants I take every one of my friends who come to visit me in San Francisco. ?No other restaurant measures up to this Chinese(slash Korean-Chinese) establishment. Service is very hectic, but efficient. ?Don't expect them to give you 100% attention because with the sheer number of people waiting to be served, its impossible.

Why do people come here? Its because of the chicken wings. (get the dry chicken wings because it taste soo much better) I ordered string beans here as well which is really good. Its pretty pricy here but its really. If its your first time here and you dont see any seating? theres is a white board for you to write your name. One thing about this place is that their service could be really bad. They want to rush people to leave by giving them their checks really early and taking your plates before you are done.

Two words: CHICKEN WINGS. Crispy, sweet and spicy, these wings are delicious. Pros: -flavor packed chicken wings. -great northern Chinese food all around -energetic atmosphere. Cons: -longest wait ever if you come at dinner time. (about 30mins+) -loud atmosphere if youre not for that type of atmosphere because there are many groups. -don't expect attentive service. Food compensates somewhat for the service. I always want to go to San Tung, but the wait makes me thinks twice.

4.5 for dinner + .5 for our free sake shots! Went here for Marc's friend's birthday dinner on a rainy Saturday night. There's a hidden party table in the back of the restaurant that you can get with a reservation. It never hurt to call! Dumplings- We got both kinds and they were both delicious. A good balance of filling and wrapper, and very flavorful. The dry fried chicken wings- OH MY DAMN! Get 10 orders of this! The sauce perfectly coats the crunchy wings and it's just irresistible! I could eat this and rice forever. Noodles with black bean sauce- Super simple and went well with the wings, actually. The only drawback with this dish is that it became too salty after a couple bites and I found myself drinking more water & beer to wash down the noodles. Stir-fried green beans- Gotta have some kind of veggie dish! Again, simple and addicting. A lot of garlic flavor and a little bit of spice, very little. I enjoyed this one a lot. Fried fish fillet- Totally did NOT picture this dish the way it was served. But omg, it was so good! This was a little on the salty side too, but I guess the rice was meant to offset the sauce. Def something I would order again. Our waiters were awesome and joked around with us, this earned points and made the experience that much better. Going to my fair share of Chinese restaurants throughout my life, I've learned that service 1.) really SUCKS at Chinese b/c they're rude and impatient, 2.) is really fast but rude, or 3.) comical and quick. No, seriously, these are my conclusions. San Tung falls under #3 and I would totally go back with a party or just the bf for the service and good eats.

Ahhh, I crave the dry fried chicken more than necessary! The kimchee was weird to me at first, quite possibly because I'm used to Korean Kimchee and it was more spicy than my taste buds expected, but that didn't stop me from munching on it while waiting for the chicken to arrive at our table!

First thing I noticed was the mountain of green beans with the cooks peeling the tips off. ?What kind of chinese place still does that now in days?? ?Brings back the memories of having to do that when I was a kid @_@ Mmmmm the wings. What caught my attention was how the wings retained their crispiness even when covered lightly with their sweet and spicy sauce. ?From the first bite that almost burned my tongue to the last wing that I had to battle for, it was crispy. ?The flavor was good and the meat fell off the bones. ?I did wish it was a little more spicy. ?Definitely worth trying though. Get these! The spicy combination noodle soup was good, but again not spicy enough. The mu shu was pretty forgettable. ?It comes with four wraps and charge one dollar extra for each additional wrap... ouch! ?I'd skip that one. ? Ordered white rice and when we open the cover, it was only half full! ?We are bunch of hungry asians! ?The strereotypes are true! ?We eat ALOT of rice! ?That was pretty disappointing :/ The service is the standard chinese restaurant quality. ?No water or tea refills unless you ask. ?No point complaining since I'm really here for the food.

A group of 8 went there for dinner. I don't understand why this place is popular...maybe it created a false impression that people waited in line so it looked good. We ordered 8 dishes and only 2 were my favorites: the WINGS and the long beans!! The wings were slightly marinated and the sauce were super delicious. The wings tasted a mixed of spicy/sweet/sour but it is not too heavy like the traditional Chinese food. The long beans were fresh and crisp. Overall the food is average, and the restaraunt is over crowd. you sit next to each other, chair by chair, back to back LOL... The speed of food were fast, based on the over crowed place. I know that almost every table ordered the same things: the dumplings and wings and the beans.

We've heard about this place and the famous chicken wings; instead of the usual dim sum lunch (our routine when visit mother-in-law in SF), we came here per request of the children. We had reservation at 11:30, parking was not problem at all. Probably a lot of people were out of town on a July 4th weekend.. The place filled up rather quickly, we ordered most of the popular dishes. The two orders of chicken wings were plenty for the 8 of us, it was fried perfectly, hot and juicy. The sauce was a bit too sweet for my taste, others all liked it. I would like it to be tangier. The boiled dumplings were very good; the hand rolled skins were of the right thickness/chewiness. we started with one order each of pork and shrimp, added 2 more orders of the shrimp/chive dumplings, my favorite. The string beans were pretty good but not ?necessary superior to the other good ones. ?I was not impressed with the noodle dishes;both the Jia-Jong and Chow-Ma noodles were very ordinary. We will definitely be back for the comfort food, probably not a good choice for anyone on a diet.

You'll see dry-fried chicken (I prefer the diced version to the wings) on almost every table here, for good reason: IT ROCKS! Love the little dish of kimchee that you get while perusing the menu. We also like the spicy soup noodles, spicy peanut noodles, potstickers (steamed and pan-fried), mongolian beef, hot-and-sour soup, mu-shu... Mmmm... I just ate there last night and I already want to go back. It's not as amazing as it used to be, but still a very solid, top-tier place.

There are several items at this restaurant that I rave about and it's the dry fried chicken wings and all the dumplings. ?These items are consistently good. ?When you get there and it's busy, put your name on the wait list by the door. ?They will call the next available party size when a table opens up. ? Parking is difficult in this area.

Dry Fry Chicken Wings: Amazing, order more! Cold Noodles: Fresh noodles, awesome! Everything else: PDT. Pretty Damn Tasty. Well can't really say "everything else" since the menu is pretty huge, but I've tried most of the dumplings (pdt), a braised fish (pretty decent), mushu pork (tastes great, but needs more wrappers), dried sauteed string beans (perfectly crunchy), and a few other things. Sure the wait can suck, and the service can be impersonal and hasty, but the food is pretty solid...

You'll notice that almost everyone on Yelp raves about the dry fried chicken, the steamed dumplings, and the spinach. If you go there, you'll notice that at almost every table, there's a plate of the dry fried chicken and some dumplings. Sometimes, there's a reason why restaurants are popular. So the food is good, the room is crowded, and parking in the Inner Sunset can be tough. I'd rather order for pickup and avoid the negatives. The chicken tastes just as good at my place (provided I order it from here).

Every review of San Tung so far (save those by Netty L. and Jordan M.) mentions "dry fried chicken" something or other. Suzanne H. states that "dry friend anything is good." Alice T. exclaims, "Four words, 'Dry Fried Chicken Wings'." And Denise L. states, "The best dry fried chicken in SF!! They are the bomb!! Spicy and delicious." There are two things to be learned from this near-unanimous consensus: 1) Their dry fried chicken is one of the most enjoyable ways ever to simultaneously raise your cholestorol level by 100 points and your body fat content by six percentage points in one night. 2) The other stuff isn't really worth mentioning.

Dry fried chicken. Diced or wings. Either one will make me happy. I wonder how (un)healthy this delicious chicken dish is? Why do I ask...when it won't stop me from rolling down the hill from my house toward the luring aroma of this spicy, sweet, crunchy, chicken-licious treat. The thing that could stop me is the out-of-the-door and down the street line. That's why I do take out. That and so I feel OK about chowing down ?and licking every bit of yumminess off my plate and fingers.

So I'm giving this place 5 stars even though I shouldn't due to the surly and curt service I usually get but it's a Chinese restaurant so you can't have high expectations on service. Typical Chinese restaurant - you order your drinks and food, you get your drinks and food, and you usually don't see the wait staff till you ask for your bill. So the only things I've tried here are the wings which are yummy time, absolute best appetizer they have. Not only do they come in abundance but they come piping hot and delicious! The only other thing I've also tried was the ja jang myun which is the Korean style thick noodles with black bean sauce. I usually get mine with the shrimp and calamari. Very hearty, filling, and tasty. Being Korean and ja jang myun being one of my favorite Korean dishes I have to say San Tung's is very good. So be warned that it does get very busy but they bring the food out fast and furious for your hungry food eating pleasure. Bonus is that they're very affordable as well. Enjoy!

I'm the 604th reviewer? Geez. Okay, well everything I want to say has already been said. Yes, the dried (you can also order their "wet" version) fried chicken is soooo good. Surprisingly sweet with like some sort of carmelized glaze over the bite-size chicken pieces.....could've tasted like dessert to me. **Review Update: 3rd visit last night - Sun night, April 26th** We came at 8:30pm and there was a line of people waiting outside in the cold. Wow! This place ain't no secret. And it was good to see there were alot of Asians packed in there. (a huge tell-tale sign that it's authentic, of course) We couldn't stand to wait in the cold so we decided to do take-out. We ordered our usual "dried diced chicken" and "spinach with bean threads in garlic sauce". Even with the huge wait and the crowded restaurant, we were in and out of there in 15 minutes with our hot food to go. We were delighted to find that the food quality and taste was better than ever. Mmmm. Delicious!!!!! I think this is my NEW FAVORITE CHINESE RESTAURANT! P.S. They're closed on Wednesdays

Oh, to be in San Francisco again, where I could step out of my apartment, and not a block away, steep myself in the culinary delights of San Tung's. But why not 5 stars, Melinda? - It's busy as hell, and Melinda does not like waiting for more than a half hour for her food, mostly because she's a cranky b*tch when her blood sugar drops. Best time to come here? Late lunches. - The service isn't exactly the fastest or most attentive. Partly due to my first gripe. Those caveats aside, the food here is really good. REALLY good. I made a special trip up from the South Bay, when I was in town, just to go there. OK, so it was actually to see my friend, but San Tung is my friend too, just a lesser one.

While I've only been here once, but right now I'm inclined to think that they don't deserve more stars just because they have ONE AMAZING DISH. Yes, the dry-fried chicken wings were delicious. I'm a squeamish, recent ex-vegetarian and I even was sucking the skin and every speck of meat off those little bones. The service was great and it was absolutely packed, but the other dish we ordered, some tofu/bean curd/mushroom dish was only fine. I mean it was good but by no means exceptional. Maybe I'll try some of the dumplings and string beans next time I come (I was on a no-carb diet when I went), so I haven't written it off. But I was just not impressed at all with their tofu dish. I could have made it at home with the proper spices. I'm just not sure what ALL the hype is about......yet.

Coming here on a Thursday night at 9:15pm equals no wait at all. Unless we were just lucky that night. After hearing about this place from everyone and seeing it on the Big Eats list, I really wanted to try it. Tried the Dry Chicken Wings (I believe they were about $10 for 12 wings) and the Black Bean Noodles. I actually enjoyed the noodles more than the wings. The wings come in this sweet sauce, but is still crunchy and is also has a lot of meat. They were good, but I prefer my wings salty and that's what I had in mind because I didn't know these were going to be in the sweet sauce. So that's just my preference, if you like your wings in sweet sauce, I'm sure you'd love this place because the I liked everything else about these wings :) The noodles surprised me. There was so much sauce on top that you couldn't even see the noodles, so I was expecting something too salty or a really strong flavor. BUT, it was actually perfect. The flavor wasn't too powerful, but had just enough for you to be able to really enjoy it. I'm not a fan of super powerful flavors, so this was just delicious :9 Service was quick, I guess because it was closing time soon and there weren't a lot of people. A lot of empty tables by that time. They were also very friendly. I'll be back to try those dumplings everyone's talking about soon!

I came here based on the recommendation of an ex-SF resident who had rated it #1 on her personal Top 10 SF Eats list. My expectations were higher than ever w/ all her hyping, but San Tung rose to the occasion and won me over. Order their... -Dry Fried Chicken Wings: I'm normally not a chicken wing fan, but Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints! These were phenomenal! -Dry Fried String Beans: Cooked to perfection. I always forget to order veggies when getting Chinese, but this winner of a dish won't have me forgetting at San Tung! -Homemade Noodles: Chewy and deeeelicious! My roommate sneaked a bite and couldn't stop sneaking more since they were that good! Okay San Tung. You did it. You made it into my Top 10 Eats list too!

First off I must say this is the best Chinese food I have ever eaten at a restaurant. Service could have been better but I go out to eat good food that I cant replicate and this place was far superior to any chinese I have ever made at home. Seriously it is SUPERB. Went in last night about 7:30 pm. Line was long as can be, typical San Fran style. Parked 1/2 block down on Irving so cant complain bout that. Went past the crowd and put our name on the board ( similar to Burma Superstar ). There were 13 names ahead of ours, we were a party of 3. Oh and I must say we decided on this place strictly based on yelp reviewers so...... THANKS!!!! Anyway, we were anticipating about an hour wait but instead the line flew and we were seated approx 30 minutes after first arriving, which isn't bad at all given the circumstances. I have waited at many other places for much longer with much shorter lines. HIGHLIGHTS - Chicken wings! Delicious, simply delicious. So good I even brought an order home to share with others cause they were just that good. The spicy noodle soup we had was good, not too spicy, and had a nice array of seafood and beef in it. The dry fried beef was also tasty, very crispy and flavorful, the garlic sauce was spot on. Prior to the meal I said if the had Moo Shoo Pork I would order and to my delight they did. My girlfriend made the comment she doesnt like Moo Shoo Pork. It arrived, I made her a pancake with plum sauce and all. She had I bite and proclaimed " I stand corrected ! " We also had the shrimp and mixed vegetables. Very fresh veggies it seemed, perfectly softened and mixed in amongst numerous, plump, well cooked, shrimp. Next time we'll try a different noodle and the dumplings to start. Its already been decided. This place lived up to its yelp reputation. Thanks

Let me start off by saying if you want to get some dinner here, get there early. My buddies and I went there on our vacation in Cali (after reading about it's praises on Yelp, of course), and had to wait about 20 minutes for 4 of us. It's a smaller place, but it was packed to the brim. The hostess even began seating parties of 2 together at the same table to expedite the process a bit. It's definitely a family-style restaraunt, meaning that it seemed people were sharing food with one another in their groups. We also followed suit, and it makes the meal enjoyable. I have to agree with the many posts on here about the wings for the appetizer: truly delicious. We devoured them in minutes, instantly wishing we had gotten more. The main meal wasn't too bad either - I had the chicken with black beans sauce, which came out very promptly. Service was great for everyone at our table, as we all had our meals within 5-7 minutes of finishing appetizers (which was great for such a busy place like San Tung's). It was one of the better Chinese meals I've had, and since I don't have Chinese ever, it reminded me of how good it really is. Definite recommendation for anyone in the area looking for a good Chinese meal.

The chicken wings are the best ever! I love the green beans as well and I round out my meal with the fried pot stickers. The pot stickers aren't the best ever, but they're nice to accompany the other two dishes. I've tried other dishes here but they all fall short for me compared to these three. It's been my favorite place for chicken wings for 5 years! There's always a line so get there early or order takeout =)

Who could blame the crowds of people out the door waiting for a table on the ?weekends? I've waited for more than an hour to sink my teeth into their dried fried chicken (spicey) and cold noodles. The prices are cheap, and the food is soooo yummy. Service is lacking, but that's nothing new if you're going to a cheap asian restaurant. Good luck finding parking. TIP: Make reservations ahead of time, but sometimes that doesn't even help.

This restaurant specializes in Chinese/Korean cusine.

Today I went to a picnic with some of my friends from work and one of my coworkers brought 3 orders of the dry fried wings. ?I immediately stopped eating everything else and started eating the hell out of these wings. ?I can't believe I just now found out about these! ?I have to go to the actual restaurant to check out their other "goods" but not without an order of their wings of love.

Man, oh man..... My blood sugar was quickly dropping yesterday after a hike in Marin, but San Tung saved the day! Super yummy homemade noodles with flavorful black bean sauce (Zazang Myun - to those of you with Korean affiliations), and super sweet, crispy, garlicky Dry Chicken Wings (GamPoonGhee....It's almost like dessert). More sugar, salt and fat intake than one should rightfully have in a day, but OH SO TASTY!!! ? The main reason I cannot give this place a five star rating is that on a previous occasion, I found the Hot n' Sour soup to be incredibly, sadly, underwhelming.... But the other items I and my pals tried were INCREDIBLY worth it!

Props to the big boss man keeping everything in check. ?The chicken wings are still one of theee best!! ? The hot braised flounder is so slammin' that I can get girls to eat it even when they hate fish, later becoming their favorite dish. That is some serious goooooodd stuff!! ? You sell those pickled cabbage (kim chi) in gallons? ?My friends from LA are still talking about them after 3 years. ?Tell the boys that my name is like the street, so I don't have jump at every name they shout out that sounds vaguely like mine in this crowded joint kpup

Excellent, authentic Shandong cuisine at a decent price. And yes, the dry fried chicken wings are the bomb. I could live on them for days. Their dumplings and potstickers are also delectable, being the meatier and doughier versions. I'm honestly on the fence about their noodles, but that's probably because I haven't fully explored the menu. Service was definitely off last night... some table that ordered a good ten minutes after we did got their food that much earlier. WTF? I wish they'd open up a branch in the South Bay. They're even better than Tong Soon, which is arguably the best Shandong restaurant in the South Bay.

I've been to San Tung several times over the course of the last 12 months. ?Many friends and relatives rant and rave about how great the food is. ?Quite honestly, I am a bit uncertain what the hype is about. ?Yes, there is a huge demand for their cooking - as the mob of people that are regularly waiting outside would indicate. ?But quite honestly, the food doesn't really seem all that special. ? Now that is not to say that the food isn't good - it is good. ?But hype aside, I believe that the food is really not significantly better than the Shanghai Dumpling King on Balboa, or Dragon House on Geary. ?Maybe the people think waiting 45 mins for food makes it taste better. ?Kinda like Olive Garden. Based on all the reviews, I wouldn't mind giving their full menu a good once over - but I refuse to wait 45 mins for "good" food when I can go elsewhere and not wait.

My wife and I went here at 3 pm on a Saturday thinking there would be no crowd. ?WRONG. Sure there was only a couple minute wait, but it was still completely packed. ?This is our 4th attempt at eating here, 2 times there was over 30 - 45 min wait and we were too hungry to stick around, third time they were still doing their renovations which explained the complete lack of a line outside. ?I am glad I tried again. The interior is fine, but be honest, you are here for the food. ?We ordered the Shrimp and Leek Dumplings which I loved. ?I could have eaten a couple plates of these and nothing else. ?The Original Dry wings were awesome as well. ?The only "bad" thing we had was a relatively average tasting Mongolian beef, but the rest of the dishes were great. ?I probably gained half a pound in my visit, but I would happily do it again.

Came here for lunch with a party of 7. Did not have to wait long since it was late (like 2pm). We ordered: egg rolls, sizzling rice soup, dry fried chicken wings, "2 pieces of skin", dan dan noodles, garlic egg plant and spinach sauteed with bean threads. The sizzling rice soup is quite unique with sizzling rice poured into a clear broth spinach soup with some seafood. The soup base is quite flavorful and the sizzling rice gives the soup some body and texture. The famous dried fried chicken wings are great. Fried chicken wings glazed with a slightly spicy sweet sauce. Finger licking good! "2 layers of skin" is a somewhat unique dish. Uncut bean thread skin is mixed with seafood, julienned cucumber, carrots and 5 spice beef over a slightly spicy mustard sauce. Also a hit! Dan dan noodles is a warm noodles mixed peanut base sauce and seafood. A little different from what I had expected. Pretty good, but did not measure up to some szechuan restaurant. The spinach was cooked just right with the bite cooked out of the vegetable, but just wilted with enough crunch. Very good timing/temperature control on the part of the chefs who prepared the dish. Total bill before tips was $70. My friends are so impressed with the food and the price that they want to come back for dinner:)

I've been going to San Tung for the last 10+ years. ?Fell in love with their Tan Tan noodles and have yet to find any place that can make it even close to as good as they make it. ? Three dishes that I have been ordering for the past decade at San Tung. Tan Tan Noodles, Potstickers and Dry Fried Wings, the quality and taste is consistent. I used to go to San Tung at least a few times a month, but with its popularity soaring and the lines out the door, I am sad to say I only visit them once a month these days.

Very yummy chicken here! Good dumpling too...Worth the wait... however we encountered a nosy Grandpa who accused us for cheating and placed our name on the top of the list, then trying to talk to us verrry slowly as if we don't understand any word in English. We explained that we've waited for 45 minutes already, but he keep on talking how we shouldn't have cut the line, etc etc... very annoying. maybe instead of white board they should just use regular paper, so no one can get accused of cheating... people do mad things when they'r'e hungry!!

I don't know if it's the restaurant or is it the cuisine but this is one of my favorite foods to eat. ?They start off your meal with some complimentary Kim Chee to get your appettite going and oh, does it work... I like a lot of their dishes. ?dumplings, dry fried chicken wings, string beans, deluxe noodle soup are the ones I get most of the time but I like everything on their menu. ? The only time I had a really bad experience was when I went in the early evening, late afternoon. ?We ordered the Deluxe noodle soup and it came out clumpy but everyone is entitled to a bad day. ?Luckily, I had been there many times before this bad experience. ? If it had been my first time, I may have not been willing to come back cause First Impressions are what stick in your mind sometimes... ? One bad experience... ?Many many Great Ones!!!

When I lived in the Inner Sunset, I ate here about once a week. ?Often, unfortunately, I had to do takeout because the wait was so long. ?Now I live in NYC and whenever I go home to visit the parents, I make a pilgrimage to San Tung. My ideal meal begins with sizzling rice soup, shrimp-leek dumplings, moo shu pork and the dry-fried chicken wings. ?After that, it's anyone's game. ?My dad likes the dried-fried string beans. ?My brother likes the trout in brown (or black? can't remember) sauce. ?The standards (fried rice and noodle dishes) are fine. ?I also like the bok choy with black mushrooms. ?My family always orders more food than we think we can eat, yet we often come very close to finishing. ?I always eat more than I should, but since I don't live around the corner anymore, I don't feel guilty. It's been 3 months since I've eaten at San Tung and I miss is so. ?Be ready for a long wait. ?In my very biased opinion, it's totally worth it.

Original dry fried chicken wings... delicious. Now I know what all the hype is about. Also had the peanut sauce noodles (#11 on the menu) today. Great contrast to the chicken. Just a bit of wait today even though there were a TON of tables open. Didn't mind sharing a table with another party, but the servers insisted we get our own table. Weird.

Ok, so the service is not that great here. Agreed. BUT sometimes the food at a restaurant is good enough that I will tolerate service that is lacking, but not neccesarily bad. San Tung is one of those places. It's not a big deal to me if I have to get up and help myself to some napkins or chopsticks. Well, not at this kind of restaurant. Things I ALWAYS order here: Dry fried chicken wings and pork dumplings Some kind of noodle dish- their noodles always taste fresh and have just the right consistency/texture I also alternate between the dry fried green beans or the spinach with bean thread. The wait here can get a bit crazy (sometimes 30-45 minutes even on a weeknight), but I'll wait it out for a seat or order it as takeout just so I can satisfy my craving for their chicken wings. Parking is also difficult around that entire area on Irving St.

This place is gooood. they are known for their dumplings, noodles,and fried CHICKEN!! the dumplings are actually not the best that i've had..but they are good. the noodles are delicious, with a lot of different sauces/soups to choose from. go with the hot spicy peanut sauce one. now their chicken, that thing has crack in it or something. it is a deep fried chicken with this sweet/spicy glaze over it. last time we went, we ordered 5 orders of them. get there early and get your name on the board. or call ahead and maybe get reservations..they are ALWAYS busy

Holy shit this place is popular. We didn't get seated till 9 (after an hour plus wait in the cold outside, because it was packed with people waiting inside). I didn't want to believe the hype on the fried chicken wings, but after succumbing, they are indeed pretty damn good. However, thats the only thing San Tung's got going for it. I really don't understand why its so popular, its really nothing special. I eat enough Chinese food to know what's good and what's not, and this place is definitely mediocre. San Tung is one of those neighborhood Chinese restaurants that's better than a Panda Express, but not as good as some places on the Peninsula (though it is better than House of Nanking.... gross). Prices are a little high too, and seem to get a stomach ache after eating here. Poop galore. Try if you must (the chicken wings are worth it) and see if for yourself if it lives up to they hype. I was let down.

Wow. ?Lotta reviews. Like most others, I come here for the dry fried chicken. ?You can get it as wings or diced if you prefer to eat it over rice. ?If you like sauce (and who doesn't?) you should order it "wet." ?I get all tricky and let other people order the wings, eat a bunch of them, then order the diced as my meal. ?That way I get to eat it twice every time I go there. ?I tried a bunch of other things when I lived closer, but nothing ever quite matched the wings. ?The portions were big, the dishes were sometimes tasty, but you're really missing out if you don't get the chicken. ?It gets really busy so sometimes its easier to call in for take-out and just go pick it up rather than waiting for a table. ?Also, they don't do delivery which is actually a good thing since it prevents me from ordering the chicken so much that I get tired of it.

This is one of the most difficult places to go to in San Francisco! As if parking on 9th and Irving is not hard enough...this place is absolutely packed all the time! Two huge obstacles to get by. But once you do, oh my! The food here is absolutely delicious. The must have dishes are the chicken wings and black bean noodles. They also have the fish that's made the same way as the chicken...very good as well. For the veggies, they have the string beans and this vermicelli spinach dish...should have one of these as well. Everything is really good here at a really good price. Ate here in a big group and we each spent under $10. LIke I said, it is such a struggle to eat here unless you go early and get lucky on parking. My family prefers to just order the food and bring it home to eat. That way, we avoid the parking and the wait at the restaurant. Highly recommended!

I've heard good things about this place before, so one day, my mom and I were driving by and decided to drop by for lunch. I heard a lot about the fried chicken so we got that. It was definitely a good choice! I never had spicy and sweet wings before and it was quite a treat. I also recommend the dumplings (vegetarian ones). Once you take the first bite into one, the juices just seep out into your mouth. I came back here a couple times later, always trying one new dish but always getting the chicken and dumplings. One thing to note though is that you should try and come either on a weekday that isn't Friday or a weekend. It can get ridiculously crowded and you might be sharing tables with other people. Also, it can get quite noisy.

Yes, fried chicken wings is what everyone comes here for, and they are consistently delicious. To me they taste like orange chicken in wing form. The sauce is sweet and sticky, and the wings are fried to a golden crisp. I wouldn't recommend the wonton soup---the wontons looked like they just threw some of their dumplings into the soup. Moo shu pork wasn't bad, and every table I saw had an order of the green beans. I recommend coming here early because it gets packed at dinnertime. Or you could always order to go--but you will find yourself with sticky fingers when you crack open the order of chicken wings in the car on the way home.

Merry Christmas all! ?This is my second time coming here, but my first review. ?I actually don't remember my first time here, but given tonight's meal, this time was must have better than the first time. ? First off, those of you thinking about ordering the dry fried chicken (dry & diced), I would actually recommend the dry fried fish. I found the "chicken" to be more small scraps of meat slathered in batter and fried. ?I think the first time we got the wings, but given the fact that you can't really, truly eat chicken wings without getting your fingers dirty and that this sauce is sticky & gooey, it's not normally a viable option. ?The dry fried fish on the other hand was very tender & light with just the right amount of spices & heat. ?Comparing the two was a no-brainer as everyone at the table agreed the fish was by far the better of the two. ? We also ordered the three spice noodle dish with scallops, calamari, shrimp, onions & zucchini. ?It was good but not quite what we were looking for. ? Our last dish was the spinach with bean thread noodles. ?It was good, but again, I think I would've opted for just the straight spinach or the eggplant with the garlic sauce. I will be coming here again, but no idea what I'd be ordering aside from the dry fried fish. ?YUM.

I came here for the first time with my friend. There were tons of people waiting on line with their names on the little board. We got seated pretty much right away since we were just a party of two! Score! We ordered the fried chicken and probably other stuff. But the other stuff has long faded into the recesses of my memory because of the beauty and the majesty of the friend chicken here. Just as a warning, they'll probably kick you out ceremoniously if lots of people are waiting to eat. Far from rude, it was sort of funny. The waiter came with a box and bag, packed our leftovers in front of us, and we paid and left.

San Tung is a popular northern Chinese food joint on Irving street. You have to come here early (5-5:30pm) for dinner because this place gets packed fast! I came here on a day with 90 degree weather... Everything here comes out piping hot!! 1st impression? This place has no A/C!! AHHH soo hot!! ahahha And no, the weather apparently did not deter their loyal customers. That being said, I enjoyed all their hand-made wrappers/noodles in sweltering heat. Maybe my sweat added the dash of salt that made it just right?? HAHA - And yes their fried chicken wings are great! I would even venture to say that it is their best dish (definitely a crowd pleaser). The waiters are funny, they know their clientele and try to look hip (they have my hairstyle I had in highschool). Not your average FOB ass waiter!! Overall though, I would say that this restaurant is getting there - but just isn't great. Their hand made noodles and dumpling wrappers could be better. The dumpling fillings could also use some improvement. Get the chicken wings and you'll be good.

Not sure what else I can that differs from the previous 1100+ Yelpers...but I absolutely heart their dumplings! ?We got their pork dumplings and it was so juicy. ?I can have the whole plate of that myself. ?And it's not even fried, they just boiled it in water I believe! ?So don't have to worry about clogging my arteries. ?Of course, we ordered their famous dishes of Jajangmyeon (black bean paste noodles) and their fried chicken wings. ?I must admit, I've had better jajangmyeon elsewhere, but this isn't bad at all. ?Their sauce lacked a bit of flavor for me and noodles could have been more chewy. ?Chicken wings was mixed with this honey glazed special sauce which was good but a bit heavy for me to eat more than one piece. ?All in all, not bad experience and will definitely return even if it's just for those dumplings! :) ? Quick Note: this place does get real busy during lunch and dinner hours because we came at like 4pm and the place wasn't packed but almost every table was occupied...and this was on weekday!

This is one of my favorite restaurants! All dishes I've tried were delicious. The spicy fried chicken is the best I've had in all of SF. Everything from the Mongolian beef, Fried rice, beef broccoli... all yummy. ? Since it is also one of the busiest restaurants in the area, eating here for dinner would mean waiting in line for a loooong time. So I suggest to either go here for lunch or get a take-out menu and order take-out! Either way, this place is worth the time and money.

Their chicken wings came highly recommended. It was good, and the sauce just right. Their zazang mein was excellent too. The sauce and noodle were just right mix.

Wow, what can I say other than I really, really, really like this place? I've been here twice now and loved it both times. The food is great, the service is good, and it's clean. And oh, it's authentic Chinese food, not the crappy American-Chinese food you'll find in an alarmingly high number of places in San Francisco. Every dish that I've had here was just delicious. If you're looking for a solid meal that's fast and very reasonably priced, this is the place to go. Definitely one of the better Chinese restaurants in San Francisco. Now space here is at a premium. It's not a large restaurant, but it does accommodate large groups. Chinese food is best eaten with friends and/or family, so they have large group tables. If you come on a busy day (and it's always been busy whenever I've been here) and you're by yourself or with one or two others, don't be surprised if you're asked to share a table with another group. That's not a bad thing in my book, just be prepared for it if it's not something you're used to. Parking is all street parking, and in this neighborhood that can be tricky. Be prepared to walk a couple blocks unless you get lucky, and bring quarters to feed the meter (again, unless you get lucky and find an unmetered spot). I've not been disappointed here, and odds are pretty good you won't be either. Highly recommended by a guy that's definitely a Chinese food snob.

OMFG we got in!! WE GOT IN!! LOL, it's really hard to grab some grub here as the whole of the Sunset District is inside devouring their dry fried chicken wings. Well, a few months back, we got a table and we decided to NOT get the San Tung staples, but rather, try "new" dishes... big mistake. We left unhappy and wishing we ordered what everyone else had! I used to frequent their sister restaurant So, like a million times a month because I couldn't get enough of the dry fried stuff - the fish, the mushrooms, the string beans and their curry fried rice was awwwsome! But then... sadly... they closed... saw the owners at my work and they said that they couldn't afford to keep it up and were starting a family. Wahhh!! Wahh.... such is life. So, yesterday, after years of not eating at So, Ryry and I go and order the usuals that we got at So (good tip, go at 3 in the afternoon, people are leaving from lunch and it's too early for dinner... score! and yay to sleeping in on a Saturday!). We got the dry fried flounder - crispy, spicy, with a viscous-y, sweet sauce - MMMM!! We got their dry fried string beans - garlic-y, yummayyy, the batter is to DIE for. I much prefer the dry fried fish as opposed to their dry fried chicken wings because I don't like to get my hands dirty. Granted, you can eat them with chopsticks but goddamit! That takes TOO LONG! Also got their fried potsickers... which came out last and really, we didn't even need it to come out at all. We were quite satisfied with the 2 dishes we had... though we were oogling the noodles soups our table partners were slurping. Oh well, next time! Get in here, put your name on the list, wait to be seated - you may have to share tables but who cares?? They're going to order their own dry fried fish - have no fear! Please So, open up again so I don't have to wait as long to eat! Or San Tung, can you make dry fried mushrooms because those things are so dang good!

So we're on our way to SF (my mom, my dad and my grandma) and I suggested we eat somewhere else than the same yum cha place at auntie annies, which is always crowded anyway. ?So I pull out my yelp on bberry and ?look up most rated restaurant. ?Being chinese, my mom and grandma are the hardest critics at food so I was scared to take them anywhere new but I decided to push it. ?We end up at San Tung on Irving street (far away from our usual digs at Chinatown) but we venture on in. ? First, they let us sit down even though they weren't officially open .. we were about 20 minutes earlier than 11am (I know who eats lunch at 10:40 right? but in our defense we were on our way to eat dim sum) I ordered all the usual stuff .. Dry Chicken Wings - TO DIE FOR .. SOOOOO good, so crispy and lick your fingers good Dry Fried Flounder - I liked this better than the wings, but I like fish so this was aMAZING to me .. the sauce is so good with rice, it has like crack in it I swear Black Bean Noodles - Noodles were handmade and really good, not like the usual jajangmien with ground pork, this one had seafood. ?My mom especially liked it, I thought it was really saucy, like all over your shirt saucy but I still liked the flavors Hot and Sour Soup - My dad has a whitey taste in him and he loves this soup so we got it and it was decent, nothing spectacular Jelllyfish - We got this for my grandma because its her fav and this was actually really good. Leek Dumplings - Pretty good .. i've had better down here in LA in MPK area but I still enjoyed these and they were handmade and my mom liked them which is a huge compliment, the dough that they do it with was good and also handmade (seemed like) Kim Chi ?- Gratis, but I didn't eat any VERDICT - MUST GO!!! Must TRY? - All the usuals, the dry fried items! the sauce is so good!!! will SO come back with fiance so he can try

Best chicken wings I've had in a very long time!!! Dry fried chicken wings, potstickers, and black bean noodles... That's all you'll need to order. Food is very addictive, can't say I didn't warn you...

Oh San Tung, how you've brought back so many childhood memories. ?When I was little, we would visit a particular chinese restaurant for several dishes that we could only get there, since the owner was a korean chinese woman. ?We ordered 2 normal chinese dishes; cashew chicken and beef & broccoli. ?They were delicious! Definitely better than any other chinese restaurants I've been to. The other 2 dishes were GamPongGi (fried chicken wings) and JajangMyun (black bean noodles). ?I remember sharing these with my family, as they brought back so many memories of my grandparents. ?They're both gone now, but I can't tell you how wonderful it was to taste these and remember what it was like to eat with them again. That's how good and real these dishes were. ?I won't lie, the JajangMyun wasn't exactly the same as the restaurant I went to growing up, but it was damn close. If you're korean and you grew up eating JamPpong, Jajangmyun, HehsamTang and all the other dishes you remember, then you'll want to come here and relive the memories. If you're not korean, then you'll still want to come and try a different type of chinese flavor you may not be used to. ?You'll also never find some of these dishes in any other chinese restaurant you go to. I can't wait to go back!

Their famous Wings, sweet and spicy sauce with golden fried chicken wings. A must order when you're here. The rest of the stuff, dumplings (pork and cabbage + shrimp and leek), jellyfish cold dish, sweet and sour pork, deluxe home noodles, stir fry green beans are just average, even forgettable. I can probably name 10+ friends' mom who can prepare these dishes way better than San Tung did. Also, if you were like me, expecting the food to live up to the name San Tung (as they're famous for noodle dishes) then you'd be deeply disappointed.

Everyone's here for the dried fried chicken and it's so good! ?I don't know if it's worth the hour wait, but it is definitely the best chicken in the city. ?The sauce is so good and the crispiness is YUM! ?Another favorite is any of their noodle dishes. ?The noodles are a great texture and the flavors in every bite is delicious! ? Overall - Not worth the hour long waits, but if you're in the neighborhood when it's not busy you should stop in for the dried fried chicken and some cold noodles or noodle soup.

This place sure does get busy during lunch time and maybe because it was Friday too and the UCSF crowd frequents this place. Well anyhoo, we ordered take out and it was my first time trying food from this place. The dried chicken wings were definitely tasty but a few items tasted rather bland. We ordered a seafood fried rice, ma pao tofu, chow mein, broccoli and beef, potstickers, and egg rolls. The potstickers were on steroids! I've never seen them so gigantic before, definitely made in house because they're even bigger than costco-sized ling lings! Also, the ma pao tofu had just enough spice. The chow mein and seafood fried rice looked more scrumptious than it actually was. Both were really bland and the fried rice didn't have a taste at all. Also, there was a very weird mixture of seafood ranging from scallops, mussels, squid and (huh?) no shrimp? Eh...whatever they can find in the kitchen I guess. I agree with most reviews that this place is overhyped in terms of rating but maybe it was just the combination of food that we got. I'll be back for a different combination and then I'll update!

Meh. After reading so many rave reviews, I was super excited to try out the dried fried chicken. Frankly, I've had much better. The flavor was okay (the sauce on the side was a bit sweet for my taste), but it seemed unnecessarily greasy. The dumplings were pretty good. Black bean noodles weren't so hot. Maybe I just prefer the Korean version, but these were mushy and the spice didn't blend into the sauce very well. I know it's busy and all, I just can't get behind mediocre food, especially when you have to wait over an hour to sit down and eat it.

I truly believe that San Tung makes some of the best potstickers and dumplings and chicken wings (dry or wet) in America. I made my first visit here in 3-4 years and the standards of food quality have not changed one bit. My only regret is not trying things that I don't normally try. The other regret I have is that the prices have risen significantly perhaps? They designed a new menu (same food, just a new physical menu layout) and perhaps you might be shelling out a buck or two more per dish. It's probably worth it, as evidenced by the long waits. Which gets me to my last rec: Go in the mid-afternoon, say, 3p on a weekday! No waiting!

When it comes to eating at San Tung, there is one thing you must realize before even trying to go here: you will have to wait and usually wait a long time before being seated. Even way after peak dinner hours, for a table for 2, we had to wait over 20 mins before sharing a table with another group of 2. However, this place has a secret weapon that makes the wait so worthwhile: and that's their dry fried chicken wings. I could eat these wings and the sauce day after day non-stop and could die a happy man. They're that good. To not order them is to do yourself an injustice. So if you're in line considering going to a nearby restaurant because of the long wait, slap yourself for thinking that thought and stand there in shame. Once you've had those chicken wings, you will understand why you were stupid for considering eating elsewhere.

A friend recommended this place for their Dry Fried Chicken Wings. I almost missed my flight out of SFO to find this place and try their wings, but it was worth it. FANTASTIC! It was mildly spicy with a little sweetness. It was Heavenly. I wish I had taken an order to go as well. Parking is challenging, but it's worth it to park a few blocks away and walk over to this establishment. The staff is fast and efficient and the place was packed, but we were able to get a seat pretty quickly. If you are in San Francisco, you MUST try this place... but time it so you don't end up there 2 hours before your flight. =)

If you haven't tried San Tungs dried fried chicken wings yet then you are an idiot and really missing out. Super sweet, crispy, chicken-y goodness. There are like 242343 reviews so there is no need for me to go on and on about how good the wings are. They are easily the best wings I have ever had anywhere! The staff is super hard working and seems to love what they do. You need to come here because It really is that good.

There are always long wait times for San Tung, anything less than a half hour wait is considered short. The parking situation in the area is also not that great either. But once you're parked and you're seated at the table, everything else is good from there. The chicken wings are famous here and are a must-have. Both the dry fried chicken wings and the fried chicken wings with sauce are delicious, so try both styles if you have the chance. The mushu beef is good, string beans are also very popular, and the chicken with noodles in soup is good too.

Finally tried the Dry Fried Chicken here after much recommendation. I was trying to lower my expectations since it was hyped a bit much to me. Pleasantly surprised to find it delicioussssssssss. It was sweet + crispy but you already know that since I echo the 2000+ other reviews. Have had better black bean sauce noodles though, so I do not think I will recommend that. Pales next to the chicken. They should just sell buckets of chicken instead. ( tl;dr = Chicken is awesome! Hype-worthy. )

I took my parents here for one of their first, but definitely not their last, San Francisco foodie adventure. If my parents were to review this place, their thoughts would be that the service is slow and the servers are somewhat rude, and all the food is terrible here except for the fried chicken wings. My parents are harsh critics. Had to knock you guys down one star because of it. Mother knows best.

The famous 'Dry Black Bean sauce noodle' was not only tasteless, but lack of any trace of seafood. The complimentary pickle tasted almost spoiled, it was the worst pickle I have ever had in any restaurant. The fried chicken wings are okay, but not as impressive as they've been praised. In a word, it is a very disappointed meal, totally not worth the time and the trouble.

The only things that are good here are the chicken wings/drumsticks. Everything else on the menu is a joke. I ordered dry tofu thinking it would be fried but out came a plate of cold marinated tofu. Customer service is fine but not according to my boyfriend who thinks otherwise (they just recommend anything if you ask for good recommendations). The waiter recommended the scallop dish which was around $16. It was drenched with this weird tasting sour sauce. My boyfriend was so pissed they would even dare having this dish served. It tasted horrible and was too expensive. Everything is overpriced and this place is way too loud for you to even have a conversation with anyone.

Every time I go, I will get the Dry Fried Chicken and it never disappoint. ?I also love the Peanut Sauce noodles which is just amazing. ?

Where do I go for comfort food after a long hard week of work? Nope, not a bar, but fried chicken!!! I really need to give their chicken the spot to the BEST chicken wings I eat. The sauce really adds that tummy-rubbing attribute to the chicken. Boyfriend and I usually ordered the chicken wings and wondered what "diced" option was. We ordered the diced cihcken and it's EXACTLY what you would want if the crispies and sauce is what you're looking for to eat with rice. AND it's less messy since all the pieces are boneless. PERFECT. I'd say the rest of the dishes would just be mediocre for Chinese food, but I think we all know that. The waiting time before 5:30pm is the shortest and the best time to go or else you'll be waiting in line for an hour or more (even more a party of two!) Went at 5:45pm and got a seat, no wait! SCORE!

Two words....chicken wings. ?Secret ingredient....most likely crack. ?When I was first told about the chicken wings here, I did not expect them to be all that great. ?I have been let down to many times via people's hype. ?But San Tung lived up to the hype. ?The chicken wings are just that good. ?After some data crunching with a friend, we have come to the realization that if you don't want to hassle with the bones and want more sauce per square inch of meat, go with the boneless chicken. ? If you are looking for more of a meal than just the chicken wings (which really you don't just get another plate of them, haha) I would recommend the black bean noodles (aka zha jiang mian or ja jang myung). ?Another excellent dish put together by the cooks at San Tung. ?The string beans and egg plant are other great dishes. ?The only knock on the egg plant, is I wish they would cut it into smaller pieces. ? Usually San Tung is packed when going for dinner at anytime, so be ready to wait a bit. ?But it is amazing to watch how efficiently they turn over the tables. ?It's definitely worth watch for a minute or two.

Extremely underwhelmed by this place. ? Yes, I had all the famous dishes: dry fried chicken wings, black bean noodles (also known as "Jajangmyeon"), potstickers. ?My Mom ordered a Chinese Korean dish that's served cold and comes with about eight different thinly sliced meats, veggies and seafood. Yes, this place serves Chinese Korean dishes. ?Chinese restaurants are everywhere in the world and they adapt to their surroundings by changing up their food a little, hence dishes like "Jajangmyeon." But I digress. This real point is -- this place is not very good. ? The Dry Fried Chicken Wings are hardly better than KFC's. ?They have a lot of sweet sauce on them and are pretty greasy and maybe I'm just not a fan of grease. ?It's nothing to rave about. ?Really surprised at the level of popularity it has. ? The Jajangmyeon -- well, I have had it in Korea, the real deal, so maybe I'm spoiled. ?But this was only so-so. The Potstickers -- not bad. ?Probably the best dish ?I had. ?Though I noticed the meat was on the pinkish side and it kinda worried me. The Other Dish -- my Mom's was interesting, full of shrimps and tripe and scallops, thin slivers of meat, all served cold. ?Wish I could remember the name. ?But still, it was not worth $24. ?They brought an enormous plate and half of it was full of tripe. Service -- poor. ?I had to ask for a napkin three times before getting one. ?They don't check in to see how you're doing. ?They are gruff, abrupt, impatient. I will not return to this place. ? BTW, they do use MSG and can't remove it from pre-prepared dishes just so you know. ?Bummer. ? Have yet to find a truly awesome Chinese place. ?If anyone knows of one -- please let me know!

I live a few blocks away and have never really tried this place because there seems to always be a long wait. However, I decided to give this place a try for a friend's birthday. I know this place is known for their fried chicken and has been listed in 7x7 magazine's 100 foods in SF you have to try before you die and maybe featured on Food Network. And my neighbors have actually mentioned that living close proximity to The restaurant was why they moved there. But I'm a natural skeptic. What makes this place so special? Well I'm a believer now. We had their dumplings, cold noodles, some kind of sweet chicken (can't remember the exact name), and of course, their famous chicken wings. The dumplings were perfect, the skin wasn't too thick, too rough, or too overcooked. Sweet chicken, like little nuggets were amazingly delicious. And their famous chicken wings were pretty good, not amazingly spectacular as it had been hyped, but still very good. I plan on coming back here often, but probably to order to go.

just listen to everyone else in the world and get the dry fried chicken wings. only minuses are - sometimes they get too busy and the wait is long. sometimes they seat multiple parties at a large table. the minuses don't really matter, because the wings make you forget where you are or what you are doing. i really don't know how they make such delicious treats... fairly certain they have a direct line from heaven. but seriously, fuck. go. protip: chowmein noodles with their lemon chicken. mix well and devour. mmm. don't ask if they deliver. the answer is no. and the lazy inside of you will be sad all over. but it's probably a good thing... the whole city would order from them!

This is truly one of the best Chinese Restaurant's I' ve been to. The unique flavor to this place is the combination of Chinese and Korean. How different? Well to start off with they give you kimchi as a starter. My friends who love spicy food would go for the spicy chicken wings, dried fried shrimp, and the spicy seafood noodle soup. By the way, I'm not sure if they stil do this but from what I last remember they make their noodles by hand. My fav item are the steamed dumplings. Two things that won't make you like the place is the lack of parking during peak hours and the wait (depending on time and day).

Go for the dumplings, chicken wings (yes, the wings), homemade noodles, and duck. Stay because you can't move from eating far beyond your fill.

If you are white, make sure you know what to order here. The first time I ate here, I think we ordered poorly and I was thinking, What the hell is all the hype about. But after taking some Yelp suggestions into account and ordering with a more experienced friend, I at last have seen what the hype is all about. And yes it is worth the wait. If there was ever any doubt, the dry fried chicken wings are ri-god-damn-diculously delicious. Chicken connective tissue never tasted so good. The seaweed soup was fabulous, the mushu pork good if a little salty, and the dry-fried string beans average. Bring your Lipitor.

The wait was long, but understandable as it appears to always be 'popping' whenever I drive by, so it didn't help that it was a Friday night, around 8pm. We were watching what others were getting and there were many things that I wanted to get, probably too much for our 3 person party. Finally, when we got seated, we decided on getting a soup, the spinach and tofu soup (even though I wanted to try one of the noodle soups that everyone seemed to order). ?That was good, very good broth. ?Then I decided to get the JaJangMein (spelling?) since it also looked very good when others were eating it. ?That actually turned out to be pretty disappointing. ?There was TOO MUCH sauce and it was too thick and there actually wasn't much flavor to it, nothing special to it. ?Additionally, I did not like the texture of the noodles, I'm a skinny noodle kind of gal. We also go the dry fried chicken, diced, since I didn't want to deal with the bones of the wings and that was DELICIOUS. ?The flavors were awesome, a little sweet, a little spicy, simply awesome. ? Lastly, we got the braised tofu, thinking it would taste like the way regular cantonese restaruants made it. ?It wasn't horrible by any means, good variety of vegetables, but just not the same, the tofu wasn't soft in the middle too, which is one of the best parts of braised tofu. There are things that we NEED to try next time, such as their dumplings and noodle soup. ?All in all, an alright first try, except for their awesome chicken, will go back again to try more things.

Another fan of the dried fry chicken. Had it a few days ago, and I must say, it was probably the best damned batch of dry fry chicken I've ever feasted on. Crunchy, juicy and sticky sweet! I always order too much because San Tung serves up some faves I cannot bear to not order -- shrimp & chive dumplings, pork panfried dumplings (like XL gyoza, but with a bit of crunch), green beans, and my beloved black bean noodles. I love this noodle dish. I order my sauce separate, so it doesn't drown the noodle too quickly, but most folks like it mixed up. Topped with cucumber, it's a great dish on hot days. Crowded as all heck, but worth the wait. I used to go to the San Tung 1 on Irving, near 24th, but it is sadly long gone. It was my San Tung of choice then, but am glad this one is alive & kicking.

My mouth waters as I think of the delicious dry-fried chicken wings/drums here. ?The shrimp & leek dumplings are to die for, and the potstickers are also tasty. ?Yumm.. For SF, this is one of the best places for dumplings & noodles. I am giving 4 stars (instead of 5), because as another Yelper pointed out - NOT every dish here is excellent - WATCH WHAT U ORDER - see below. (Don't stray too far from the chicken, pan-fried string beans, dumplings, potstickers, and certain noodle dishes. ?Like any restaurant - they have their special dishes here) BTW: San Tung #1 closed down several years again, but re-opened as another restaurant by the same family - I will report back when I stop by next time. ?This is the ONLY San Tung left.

Dry fried chicken wings. ?Whoa. ?Goes great with a big tub of rice. I haven't had any bad soups at this spot. ?Although the mushroom soup is my favorite. ?Dumplings, steamed or fried, doesn't matter; they taste the same no matter how it's prepared...but I must say, steamed is a bit healthier. ?And just keep the hot tea comming, you'll need it to wash out the oil from your system! The bad thing about San Tung is the wait for a table. ?The ONLY time I didn't wait to get a table was when I went there for a really late lunch, or I guess you could say a REALLY early dinner, at about 4:30 or 5pm.

Great food. Terrible wait. The wings make the place, but the steamed dumplings are good as well. Definitely a place better suited to take out, but that was pre-remodel so who knows if it's a better sit down place now. The wait used to kill the joy of eating. Only reason it doesn't get five stars from me. My favorite is the Black Bean Sauce noodles. Mmmmm...salty.

It was closed for remodeling few weeks ago, so I am planning to go back there soon and wait in the long line again.

Overrated. Now, I'm not saying it's not good. I'm just saying its overrated. Rather skip the line, and go to Go Go Cafe instead.

I've had 2 lunch visits here in the last 2 days. So yeah, I like this place. The service is pretty good considering. The place is consistently busy but it's always good to go a little off the busy times to be seated quickly. The waiting list is a white board right by the door. I liked all of what we ordered here. Between the 2 visits, the orders were: shrimp and leek dumplings, beef chow mein, chicken wings, cold noodles in peanut sauce, pork dumplings and seafood chow mein. The most popular dish are the chicken wings. Nearly every table has a plate. They're fried and then quickly stir fried in a honey chili sauce. Tasty and crispy. There will be many, many return trips here. 7.2.07 ?I've been here a few more time since and I'm burnt out on the seafood chow mein. It's a really good dish but 4 times is enough. The shrimp in lobster sauce was a little disappointing. Not a bad dish but it didn't have any real taste to it.

Just came back from this place on a Saturday afternoon. If you know this area, you know it's annoying to find parking. So from the get go I was already in a pretty craptastic mood. Anyways, so my friend was telling me this place is some Korean style restaurant, so that's what I was expecting to eat. Once I passed by I noticed the name of place is actually in Chinese. So I'm thinking, wtf, this is Chinese food. My friend explained to me that 'it's Korean styled food, the place is run by a bunch of Chinese people'. So we waited for 30 mins before we got a table. I'm thinking this place gotta be decent being this packed. Sucks for the Pho place next door, it use to have good business. So we ordered the signature wings, some pork dumplings, mongolian beef noodles, and some kind of soup noodle dish w/ beef. The wings were fantastic. They were the only highlight of the meal (the only reason why this place even gets a 3 star from me). The dumplings were forgettable. Pretty bland, nothing special about it. The mongolian beef noodles were pretty decent, had a very subtle smoky flavor to it. The soup version of the same noodle was awful. Way too salty. I was thinking it was just the soup, but as soon as I bit into the chunk of beef ?I was greeted with a salty punch to my mouth. My taste buds were assaulted by this terrible dish. The atmosphere was that of a typical Chinese restaurant. Very loud and very crowded. Other than the 2 paper dragons hanging from the ceiling, the decor was pleasing to the eye. I probably wouldn't come here again for anything more than a takeout order of those delicious wings.

This place is awesome. I used to live in the Outer Sunset and I loved to frequent this restaurant. Be prepared to wait in line though, and make sure you guard your spot on the dry-erase board because patrons are feisty and will sometimes write their name above yours (I've seen this done many times!!). The wet-fried chicken is the best thing they have. Almost every single table orders the chicken. It's freakin awesome! Apart from that, the hand-made noodles are all good and the mu-shu is quite delicious as well. Imagine Chinese and Korean food fused together. Amazing!

I like to bring out-of-towners here and order the staples: homemade noodles, dumplings, fried potstickers, fried string beans, dried fried chicken (fried is a keyword here). Whenever I'm away on vacation for a long time and haven't had any noodles or dumplings for a long period of time, I come here.

San Tung, you would have been five stars if I didn't get such a wretched salt-hangover twenty minutes after leaving. I don't want to throw out the M-word casually, but I have my suspicions. Ambience: none. zero. painfully illuminated. Service: not always with a smile, but definitely efficient. Chicken wings: i'm embarrassed to say that I was smacking on my fingers and tearing those babies apart. Oddly meaty for wings, but I refuse to guess why. Black Bean Noodles, Chinese Broccoli, Mongolian Beef: delicious but insanely salty.

I don't like to eat meat that I have to touch. Especially if it has bones. The dry fried chicken here is my only exception. It's so tasty. And it tastes kind of like that packaged souped flavor, but I still like it! Really must be laced with crack or something. I don't even remember what else I have tried here. The kimchi tastes too sweet to be kimchi. And of course it's really crowded around dinner time. I really want some of that chicken now. Edit: It can get really crowded and it is really annoying if you are seated near the door and people stand people close and breathe all over you and your food. And then proceed to steal one of your chairs and one of your napkins. And you don't know if, during their conversations over your food, they might spit when they talk.

Dry fried chicken. Fried potstickers. Lots of napkins. Eat, wipe, repeat. Everything else is alright. Black bean sauce noodles were loaded with flavor, but it was evident this was due to the immense amount of MSG spilled in. Everytime I come here, i try something new from their large menu, but I always wind up sticking with the chicken and the potstickers. Hot and sour soup, and add noodles. But the style of hot and sour soup is really just egg drop soup with tofu, mushrooms, shrimp, and a dash of vinegar. Not really the authentic stuff. Just be prepared for a wave of nervousness, increased heartrate, and for some of you, headaches and neck pain. The MSG level is sky high here. Perhaps that's why it all tastes so good.

More like 3.5 stars The free kimchi is a good starter while you wait for your food although the taste varies from time to time. Sometimes it's too sweet and sometimes it's too spicy. But hey, it's free. Can't complain too much folks. The wait time for your food varies depending on what you order. The chicken wings may take awhile for their arrival, however the appetizers and noodle dishes come in a pretty fair amount of time. I don't recommend eating any of their rice plates, but rather their noodles and appetizers only. The (+): dry fried chicken shrimp and leak dumpling fried potstickers bean curd cold plate sliced beef cold plate spicy combination noodle soup noodles in peanut sauce (only order if you are a peanut butter fan or else you may be grossed out) price is fair (-) chicken chow mein (a little on the bland side) If you arrive after 5:30 PM, be prepared to wait. It's not a huge waiting area so you may get stuck waiting outside. Put your name up on the board and wait to hear your name. There are some sneaky bastards who try to slip their name on top of your's so watch out.

When I go to San Tung, I order only 3 things on the menu: their shrimp/leek dumplings, their pork dumplings, and their honey deep-fried chicken wings. All of the aforementioned are delicious. I'm giving the place 3 stars though, because: 1) everything else on its menu is ehh.... they're all rather forgettable. 2) service is pretty bad. You'll have to remind them several times for things. But they can totally afford to be a$$es, because you are just one out of their gazillion customers. 3) the wait (esp during dinner time) is horrendous. Be prepared to wait 30 minutes even IF you have a reservation....and 45 minutes to an hour if you do not. If you want to try San Tung yet don't want to wait, I'd suggest going in the late morning (maybe 11 am), or early evening (6 pm).

i often find myself with a crazy twitch & uncontrollable itch if it's been longer than a week without San Tung's dry chicken wings. ?Just call me Tyrone Biggums from the Chappelle Show because that's how badly i feen for this CRACK CHICKEN. No need to order anything else because they're all just fillers and taste pretty much like any other chinese restaurant. It can get busy ,so I advise on dropping one of your friends off to place a name on the dry erase board as you try ti find parking. ?Also remember to watch for cutters who may try to squeeze their names in between the lines (this HAS happened to me). ? remember: DRY WINGS ONLY, you'll regret if you get them wet!

I love this place. Original dry fried chicken is the stuff of my dreams. I could eat a whole plate of the spinach and bean threads and still want more. I'm slightly allergic to seafood, but I love the shrimp and leek dumplings so much, I risk it. This place is that good. I live in New York now (so sad), but whenever I come back, I always head to San Tung for my first meal at home. And if you're intimidated by the wait, just know that it is totally worth it. PS: Everytime I go to San Tung, I see everyone ordering the original dry fried chicken wings, but after trying the dish prepared both with the wings and diced, diced rules! Try it!

Garlic. ? That's pretty much the major ingredient in most of their dishes. ?Don't get me wrong, garlic can be good. ?But, OMG, the amount they use in some dishes is staggering. ?Better be careful if you're you are on a date! My parents and I headed here as I had consistently seen a line out the door most nights as I walked by. ?And when we went in, what dd we see on pretty much every table? ?Some dumplings and chicken wings. ?Turns out, their dry fried chicken wings are quite well known - and for good reason - they are pretty tasty! ?And their dumplings are also quite well done (not much garlic in these, thank goodness). ? We got a couple other things, but I think we decided that the best things were the dumplings and wings, so that's what we'd stick to if and when we come back!

Surprisingly good Chinese food. We love the fried chicken - you can order it dry, diced, or wet. Such options for someone like me who doesn't eat a lot of meat. I would not recommend trying to dine in especially on a Saturday night. It gets packed. We always order out and even trying to get to the cashier can get tricky (you need to maneuver your way thru those seated). They should consider delivery. It would be another good way for this restaurant to make a lot more money.

The wait for the food was pretty long. ?We saw tables that came/ordered after us get their food before us so we were upset/hungry. ? Anyway-when the food came we were happy again. ?man...their chicken wings were might delicious. ?We also ordered steamed pot stickers (not the best i have had), mushroom chicken, chicken with string beans...the food was really good. ?I miss the chicken wings already...we should have ordered more!!! ?The price was ok but a lil on the high side in my opinion since it's not a fancy place and it's located in china town daly city.

Overpriced Chinese food. ?Sure the dry fried chicken is awesome, but not sure if the lines are truly worth it (1.5 hr wait on a weekend??). ?Dumplings are pretty good, as well as their veggie dishes - but everything else is just decent (including the black bean sauce noodles and the sizzling rice soup). My parents kinda like this place and we also like to take out of towners here for the chicken, so I'd go back for them - but there are definitely better places to get your grub on. If I lived closer, I'd do take out for the chicken on a regular basis.

Dry fried chicken wings were gooooood. They're so crispy & juicy & lightly coated with a delicious sauce. Eggplant dish was ok -- it was kind of overloaded with sauce though (& super cornstarch-ed sauce, at that). I also had some seafood noodle dish, but I was not a fan. It was basically a huge bowl of noodles, with a sprinkling of seafood & some sauce. Was very disappointed with it, but I had the chicken wings to nurse my hurt feelings away. Trust everyone else's review when they say the wait is super long -- & trust them when they say the waitstaff is awful. Yes, you will have to wait an hour to get seated, & yes, when you're finally seated, you'll be ignored for another 20 minutes. BUT THOSE CHICKEN WINGS! Maybe get them to go.

The food here is unreal. ?I love it. ?Easily 5 stars in my book. The service is good at times, and really sucks at others. ?My last two times here have been poor in the service department. First, I brought my family (visiting from out of town). ?I called in beforehand to set up reservations for 7:00. ?We arrived and weren't seated until 7:20, and even then, it was only because they had seated 2 other groups, and were about to seat a third when we interjected. ?Not a fun experience. ?They were busy that night, but the service was poor in that it barely existed. Second, I called in for take-out yesterday around 2:00, ordered the dry fried chicken wings, the shrimp and leek dumplings, and chicken fried rice. ?They told me to pick it up in 15 minutes. ?I showed up then and waited another 10 minutes for them to get the order out. ?Perhaps not the biggest deal, but I wasn't impressed. Anyway, excellent food, lacking service. ?I'll continue to eat here often, but only because the taste slaps me in the face and calls me mother.

The 860+ positive reviews were right, San Tung is a great place for Chinese food and my guess is that it has something to do with its Chinese/Korean-ness. We had the Dry Fried Chicked (diced, but if you look around the wings are as good/better(?)), the Three Deluxe Spicy Sauce Noodles, Mongolian Beef, and pot stickers. ?Oh, and there was kimchi! San Tung is our new favorite Chinese food restaurant and we will be traveling from the peninsula to the Sunset to eat here.

My family, close friends, and the industry I love/live (tech) is in Northern California yet I've thus far resisted the move and instead prefer enjoy life in Sun Diego. But every time I have the opportunity to partake in dry fried chicken, peanut noodles, shrimp/leek dumplings, mushu pork from San Tung, I nearly pack my bags. Another spot that does not need my review but I feel guilty every time my taste buds explode in this restaurant and I haven't posted a review so here ya go.

Some other things that are consistently great: ?shrimp and leek dumplings, pork dumplings and mu shu pork. The service gets a bit sloppy when they are really busy (which is most of the time). ?Some of the servers are great and attentive, but others just ignore you and don't really care about servicing you at all.

With almost 1000 reviews, and a solid 4 star rating on Yelp, there seems to be hardly any point in add to the onslaught of people saying how amazing the dry fried chicken is, or how long the wait is. ? The wait is long, and the dry fried chicken, on or off the bone is amazing. ?The turnover at this place is incredible. ?You are in and out really quickly, unless of course they are running behind, which is typical because there are so many orders coming in at once for the admittedly too small restaurant. ?Honestly there isn't too much more to talk about when it comes to the food at San Tung. ? This place belongs in Chinatown. ?It's nice to have it in the sunset. ?The parking is easier (but not much) and the mix of Korean and Chinese influences do make for tasty combos on the menu. ? If you want amazing chinese food in the sunset and have 30-45 minutes to wait before sitting down to order, this is the place to go.

This restaurant is a gold mine. ?It's always packed with a line out the door. ?Even on week nights. ?I made several attempts to eat there, but always gave up due to the long wait. ?I finally decided to get a take out to see what the hype is all about. ?I was a bit surprised how mediocre the food was. ?The dumplings (Northern Chinese dumplings - Jiaozi ? or Shuijiao ) were pretty good (better than most northern Chinese dumplings you can get in SF), but other items were nothing to write home about. ? I've been to San Tun twice since my take out experience to try other dishes and my verdict stays unchanged. ?If you decide to go, I would stick with the dumplings (the shrimp and chinese leek is good) and skip the rest.

If this place did not require a 45 min-1:30 hr wait any major dining night, I would give it four stars for being a decent Chinese restaurant. That's all the food is really. Some people are saying that it's crap, others that it's amazing, and the truth is really somewhere in between. For anyone who's had good Chinese at various levels--home-cooked, in China, upscale fusion or Hong Kong, and so on--this place will be passing, occasionally pleasant, fare. That's about it. The chicken wings people are raving about? I looked at them, they look Korean-style, but someone correct me if I am wrong. You can get them at many Korean grocery supermarkets. I wouldn't venture onto the Korean menu here, because probably like the rest of the menu: a tad too greasy to be subtly delicious like rockin' Chinese food is at its best. Bottom line, there are Chinese restaurants that are WAAAAAY better than this place at the hole-in-the-wall level (like this one) in the East and South Bay areas. In Sunset, I'm not as sure, but somehow I get the feeling there are other places that people in the know are keeping an avid secret from the less than informed masses flooding this place... And I can't blame them! (Just secret msg me where y'all be going!!!!!)

The more hungry you get while waiting, the better the food will taste =). There were 3 girls with the rest were guys. So figured, we got a table filled with dishes and after dishes - dumplings, beans, mushu, zazang myun, jum pong, eggplants, fried fish, and of course the chicken wings. ?Everything was a-okay. ?

5 stars for the food -1 star for the crappy parking and the not so great service and the sometimes very long wait....... Everyone is crazy about the chicken here, but I am all about the dumplings. The pork and cabbage dumplings. The small ones, the big steamed ones, the big pan fried ones, I take them in all shapes and sizes LOL The noodles r good too, I always get the black bean sauce with shrimp and beef and octopus. I swear they put crack in their dumplings! It's so freaking good. The free kimchee is good too, but if u go later on at night they run out =(

4.50 stars. Great little Northern Chinese/Korean restaurant. Their fried chicken is pretty legendary. But this place suffers from the Yelp-effect. There's always a line at night (haven't tried coming here for lunch), and you cannot make reservations. You need to write your name on a board. But once you sit down, definitely get the steam dumplings, fried chicken, and another of their noodles. Their noodles (the one with peanut sauce is awesome) are delicious! The wait can be discouraging, but you can weather the storm (not that hungry when you first start your wait), it is worth it.

FYI San Tung is closed on Wednesdays (I know, WTF!). We didn't know this and were met with quite a disappointment. Upon returning the next day we sank our teeth into yet another great meal at San Tung. This place seems to be perpetually crowded at dinner, but the wait is never too bad and they do seating's in big waves. We shared a table with a family, but still had plenty of room and didn't feel packed in at all. As for the food, the high marks blow all other Chinese food out of the water and set my standard for what I want, however, not all items on the menu live up to the standard set by these great dishes. The Food: The dry fried original chicken is hands down my favorite rendering of fowl. It's hot, crunchy, spicy, sticky, and incredibly flavorful all at the same time! This may lead you (as it did me) to think the other fried chicken choices might be similarly life changing. Unfortunately the lemon chicken we ordered on a second visit was really pretty bland, high on fat and low on meat, and in desperate need of salt. Lesson here, stick with the fried chicken and don't let go. The Chow Mein (make sure to ask for Housmade noodles for a $1 extra) is better than you think Chow Mein could possibly be. It makes all other chow Mein seem like garbage. The spinach is light and tasty, the dry fried shrimp are a great fish alternative to the chicken, and the pot stickers are good, but not as good as they look. The dumplings every one raves about I found to be quite boring and were weighted down with water. The bean curd was nasty, but I don't think its my thing anyway. The sweet and sour soup is really good and a great start to a meal. Seems like the perfect take-out spot.

Yesterday was the second time I've been to San Tung. I think I'm going to make it a summer tradition. We got there around 4 o'clock (I had made reservations ahead of time) and they seated us right away, which was awesome considering we needed 3 tables of twelve for our group. Combining all the food that was ordered we must have eaten half the food that was in the kitchen. The staff was very quick and friendly. We ordered: Mushu Pork (w/ and w/o mushrooms) Shrimp and Leak Dumplings Pork Fried Rice Chicken Chow Mein Potstickers Dry Fried Beef Mongolian Beef Steamed Rice And the famous Chicken Wings!!! (spicy and not spicy) Green Beans Everything was fantastic and having a ton of friends there made the evening even better (not to mention the sake!) I'm eating the leftovers for lunch!

Finally tried the famous dry fried chicken that everyone has been raving about. We opted for the diced chicken. We got it for take-out to eat at the park, along with the other yelper-recommended dish, the black bean sauce noodles. The chicken was good, yes, but not mind-blowing as it's all hyped up to be. It reminded me of orange chicken. Noodles were also good and I liked that they separated the sauce from the noodles so it wasn't soggy by the time we ate it. Altogether, it was about $19, which isn't bad but I know $20 could feed up to a family of four at other decent Chinese restaurants. But at least I could say I've tried San Tung's dry fried chicken and check it off my "To Try" list.

The chicken wings are the BEST!! ?When I had my first daughter, this was the first thing I ate after my c-section... ?It was a regular when we use to live in the Sunset. ?I miss this place! Go try the chicken wings! ?Oh yeah, other good items are the crispy pan fried noodles and the string bean in black bean sauce! ?You can ask for no MSG if you want too =)

Okay so I'm just one of hundreds who is writing about this place but I do need to reiterate how great the fried chicken wings are! I don't like to get the boneless ones since those always end up bathed in the sugar sauce which is great in moderation but with the boneless ones, the sauce to meat ratio is just too high and once the sauce hardens, it turns into these tough, sugary bits of chicken. ?The noodles are great also! ?I don't love the sauce in their jia jia noodles but I'm such a sucker for the fresh noodles. ?The hot and sour soup here is also pretty good but everything else here is pretty mediocre. Especially the kim chee which is just chinese pickled cabbage with spicy sauce. ?Completely different from Korean kimchee. I haven't really run into any sort of problems with the wait time and parking for some strange reason. ?Maybe because I don't usually go during prime times but I have gotten takeout and that's a decent option for those of you who aren't willing to wait.

Okay, this restaurant rocks and I shall be forever grateful to my friend Chris M. for introducing me to San Tung's WINGS, POTSTICKERS, MU SHUI PORK and many other BIG dishes. I write BIG not as in size although servings are not modest but rather in reference to the BIG taste.

Fried chicken wangs. ?The beef with green unions isn't bad either. ?And the white steamed rice tastes like heaven...ok may be not. ? Always a line unless you go at totally off hours like 4pm. ?Service is pretty good compared to asian restaurant standards! ?Makes me actually want to tip!

After years of patronage, sorry San Tung for taking so long to give you kudos for the scrumptious food and consistency. ?We visit at least twice a month and as creatures of habit, always get the same dishes. Fried Pot Stickers - three orders please, not kidding - need I say more Shrimp and Leek Dumplings - the kids love this dish Dry Fried Chicken Wings - one order wet, one order dry (I personally prefer the dry) Pork with Mustard Green Noodle Soup - one order although we need to increase to two soon as one never seems to enough Five Spiced Beef Noodle Soup w/Spinach - Grandma likes this dish Spicy Seafood Noodle Soup - spicy and hits the spot on a cold day Other items worth ordering - mongolian beef, dry fried shrimp, sauteed string beans, sweet and sour pork And there are never leftovers! ?Yes, we are pigs, but thank you San Tung for making Saturday lunches with the family an event to look forward to!

the wings are hella legit, probably best chicken wings i ever had. Got an order each of the dried fried wings and the wet fried chicken wings. ?5 stars for both variations of the wings, but if i had to choose, the nod would go to the dry fried wings because i just like the drier texture when i bite into it. ? we ordered some noodles which we saw at another customer's table and told the waiter we wanted that too. it was the black bean noodles or something, i dont remember the name but its a pretty popular chinese noodle dish...except here, i thought it was below par. ?it was pretty bland and didnt have a good ratio of noodles to other ingredients like onions and whatnot

I had to update my review because I finally got over the hype of this place. Yes, the dried fried chicken wings are freaking amazing. It's the freaking sauce that's makes them delicious. They are worth 5 stars but everything else on the menu is pretty much alright. I've eaten better Chinese food elsewhere in the city...

I went to San Tung for the first time last night and people were not exaggerating when they said the wait can get obscene. Even for two people waiting for a table it took at least 20 minutes before finally getting seated. I heard this restaurant serves a lot of Northern Chinese aka Mandarin cuisine so I was especially anxious to try their dumpling and noodle dishes. This is what I ordered: Sizzling rice soup was ok. Most Chinese restaurants has this on their menus and it pretty much tastes the same so I wouldn't come here just for the soup. Shrimp and leek dumplings were good, but not 5 star worthy. The dumpling skin did not fall apart when I picked it up, but the dumpling itself was kind of bland and wasn't very hot when it arrived at my table. I was mildly disappointed with this dish because so many people were raving about how this restaurant serves one of the best dumplings. Three deluxe spicy sauce noodles were tasty with just the right amount of spice. The noodles itself however was mediocre and didn't taste homemade as the menu claimed. In fact, it tastes just like the pack of udon noodles I usually buy at the Asian markets. Dry chicken wings are the most popular item on the menu and I did notice that every single table in the restaurant ordered this dish so I decided to try it. The wings were fried very nicely but I didn't care much for the sweet sauce. Maybe it's because I'm not a big fan of sweet food (except for desserts), but I don't see the big deal about these wings. If I wanted fried chicken with sweet sauce I would've gone to a soul food restaurant and ordered some chicken and waffles. Overall I'm disappointed that San Tung did not live up to its hype for me. The food itself wasn't terrible, but not knock-your-socks-off yummy either. I don't think it's worth the long wait unless you have time to kill and happen to be in the neighborhood already. I've traveled to China and Taiwan so I have an idea what 5 star noodles and dumplings should taste like and at San Tung, it's 3 star quality at best. I think San Tung is so successful because there's not much competition in Mandarin cuisine, considering San Francisco's Chinese population is mainly from Cantonese speaking regions.

Definitely a must-try restaurant in SF...just look at the 1400+ reviews! It also caught my interest since its Korean-Fusion cuisine... Came here on a friday night, the wait was pretty insane....the restaurant closes at 10 and there are still a line at 9:30! luckily we arrived early so it wasnt too bad. Their signature dish, Dry Fried Chicken Wings, are a must order. The chicken sauce is a combination of sweet, sour, spicy, tangy tastes but its irresistably good! Ja Jang Myun (black bean noodles) was also my favorite....but other than that, we had pork dumplings and chicken mooshu which are just average. #36 @ the BIG EAT SF list.....check!

Went with 3 other friends before a show. We ordered dried fried chicken wings, potstickers, dumplings, Peanut sauce and black bean sauce noodles. Chicken wing are a must here. I could have done without the potstickers and dumplings. Nothing special and I've gotten better ones at Dim sum places. The peanut sauce was good, and so was the black bean sauce. I probably would get those dishes again when I go back. I was so full from the appetizers that I only a small bowl of each noodle. The line to eat here can get crazy long, so when you're trying to find parking have someone run to put your name on the list. It actually didn't take that long to be seated, but if you have a big party, get ready to wait.

Some hole in the wall places are just ridiculously good, and this is one of them. ?I like the white board up front where you put your name and how many people there are in your party, reminds me of how the old Kitaro place used to be. ?The people at the front desk don't even deal with you and they just point to the white board. Ridiculously good fried chicken wings and I went ga-ga over the bean thread noodles (in the Vegetarian section of the menu). ?I also love how their soup is clean (not a pool of grease floating in it). ?A definite place to go for some good eatin'.

Best. Wings. Ever. That's pretty much all I can say. My friend always brings their wings down to get-togethers in the South Bay for us, but I finally had a chance to try out their food "fresh" from the kitchen. It's like any other Chinese restaurant you have gone to. We started off with a tomato egg drop soup, which was decent. On my friend's recommendation, we went with the deluxe spice seafood noodle, which was really flavorful and tasty. And of course, the ever popular dry fried chicken wings (wet). The sauce is AMAZING. Ours wasn't particularly spicy at all (in fact, it was a bit sweet) but nonetheless delicious. I bet the sauce would have gone GREAT over rice as well! In the end, as with every other Yelp review for San Tung --- GET THE WINGS!!!

This is based on the food alone. Let me just say this is THE place for all of my chinese food needs. ?Specifically chicken wings. With over a thousand plus reviews I'll keep it short 1. come early ?4-5pm for dinner to avoid a long wait ( when it is crowded get to the white board quickly or else you will be surpassed by 5 people right behind you. 2. Order the Dried fried original chicken wings, Black bean noodles, beef noodle soup, ( everything is great, but these are no fails) 3. eat and eat and eat and eat.

When my friends first suggested we eat at San Tung, I'll be honest and say that I was a bit hesitant, mainly because at the time I hadn't known how popular the place was. Boy, was I wrong! I don't recall the wait being too long, maybe 20 minutes at most. I don't even remember what we ordered since my girls were the ones doing all the ordering while I sat and waited until the food came out. I just have to say that their dry fried chicken wings are hands down the best chicken I've had. I'm not saying I don't like my Wing Stop but San Tung's chicken surpasses theirs on any given day. All I keep hearing is all the hype about Wing Stop. Now I know that it's probably because they haven't tried San Tung's dry fried chicken =P

I have been going to San Tung for years. ?Even way before they got super popular by word of mouth and by Yelp. ? Let me just say - the hype and now the long ass wait to get a table is worth it! ?Once you get your table - here is what you order: ?dry fried chicken wings (you may find yourself ordering a second order after you devour the first one), black bean noodles, combination spicy soup noodles, and the dumplings. You will walk out satisfied! ?I always do =)

Alright San Tung. I can see why you're so popular. From the two dishes we ordered at lunch (chicken wings, black bean noodles), I can tell that you serve solid Chinese food. I can also see your appeal of clean tables, friendly staff (in a Chinese restaurant? VAAAT?!), and bomb-ass chicken wangs. Glad we took advantage of the free time around lunch to bypass the typical crazy wait. Got the lunch special with the wings ($6.50) & an order of the hand-made noodles with black bean sauce ($9) for the quintessential San Tung experience. Both were very tasty, and we definitely could see how the wings rank among everyone's favorites. However! I can't overlook the MSG attack I had a couple hours post-chow down. I don't oppose the use of it, as I've learned that a bit of it isn't harmful at all. But when I get crippled by the amount used and am forced to pass out and wake up groggy... that's a little different! Not sure if I want to risk that and miss a few hours of work again... -____-

The hype is true...IT'S ALL TRUE! The chicken wings were so scrumptious that i would have been happy with just the chicken wings. They were seriously made to perfection, and the sauce? Oh man, that sauce was ooey and gooey with delicious written all over it. My friends and i weren't sure what the name was but all you have to say is, "can i get the chicken wings?" and they'll know what you're talking about. Ok i'll stop talking about the wings and start getting down to business. Everything we ordered was superb. The ingredients were super fresh and tasted fresh which is a plus in my book. The asparagus dish (which is seasonal) was really good. It was cooked to perfection, it was crisp and cooked well. Same goes for the string beans. I wasn't a big fan of the bean curd (tofu) dish but that's only because i'm not a fan of fried tofu. But not minding my taste buds, that dish was pretty good as well. So really, how good is this place? I'm thinking of ordering the chicken wings to-go for dinner tonight. That's how good it is.

We ordered both the dried and the wet chicken wings along with garlic spinach, combination fried rice, and some kind of dumplings. ? The dried ones are by far the better of the two. ?The wet chicken wings was served with a sauce with bamboo which made the sauce very good with the fried rice. ? The other dishes was typical chinese nothing special. ? Ironicallly, ?I found the complimentary pickled cabbage to be the best item served. ?Very spicy which goes good with chicken wings. ?I would call it kim chi but ?they is a chinese restaurant not korean. ?But its pretty much kim chi. ? The service was very good compared to other Chinese restaurants. ? Three stars for food plus one for great service.

2/5 stars on the Wing Scale... - Quality of product: 2 of 3 stars - Quality of service: 0 of 1 star - General feelings of happiness: 0 of 1 star My husband is already telling me he disapproves of this low rating but here goes... This place has two big things going for it: 1) making it onto the Big Eat SF list 2) being one of the few Chinese restaurants in the Inner Sunset The Big Eat SF folks listed San Tung's dry-fried chicken wings as a must-try item for foodies. My response: NAH, SKIP! Yes, I am very aware that other Yelpers AND my dear husband disagree. But honestly, these wings taste like MSG and white pepper to me. That's usually a tell-tale sign of bad Chinese food, no? I don't care for San Tung's dumplings either; the meat is too mushy and the overall taste too gingery for my liking. On the upside, their fried noodles and veggies are usually good bets. The service has the potential to be decent. The waiters can be nice but they are totally understaffed and overworked. Don't expect to be waited on too much and speak up if you need something. ? And whose not-so-bright idea was it to use a whiteboard to seat hungry people?! Like other Yelpers have mentioned, the "system" creates more confusion and anxiety than anything else. Cut the stress out of dinner-- check out the Outer Sunset or the Richmond for Chinese food.

This place still satisfies me after all these years. In the recent months, I've met some people who share the satisfaction with me about Santung. Apparently... we even order the same stuff! A must: Shrimp and Leek Dumplings, Dried Fried String Beans and Dried Fried Chicken Wings. And of course... you gotta have the rice. Yes the line does suck if you don't get there before the lunch or dinner rush. Take out can be such a pain as well. You gotta push your way through the waiters and people standing around anxiously awaiting for a table. And then... push through the waiters and hungry onlookers to get back out. But trust me. That chicken is to die for. Try even pouring the sauce over your rice. I know I'm not the only one who does that!

So, I'm thinking...yeah, we're gonna get a table after my friend called San Tung at 9:00PM saying "My stomach is hungry, can you feed us?" ?The guy over the phone said yes. And we're on our way to chicken wing heaven! Little did I know, there was a line out the door and a white board full of names of people who were already waiting for a table. ?So we ended up ordering to-go. ?While I was inside, I noticed one dude was just eating chicken wings and rice. ?Now that's hardcore. ?It got me real excited for my first taste of these infamous wings. ? So, when I imagined these dry fried chicken wings, I thought they were actually gonna be dry. ?I was totally confused when I saw that they were smothered in a sticky sweet sauce. ?Then again, it didn't matter because they were so freakin' delicious! Thank goodness we ordered three boxes. ?We also ordered two different dumpling dishes that I didn't care for. The dumpling wrap was soggy and the filling was nothing spectacular. ? All in all, I don't think I would wait that long just for the wings. ?I would definitely go again when they're not as busy.

Maybe we picked up togo on an "off" day? Recommended by a friend who loves dry fried chicken wings we thought "let's try it to go" since apparently the lines are crazy and it is Saturday night. None of the food we ordered was seasoned (new chef? bad day?) even the wings were not as I imagined. I've had more flavorful wings at other places so I can't understand the hype. Can 1770 reviews be wrong? The black bean noodles were disgusting and I mean that in the nicest way. The sauce was ooey-gooey and had no flavor. It ?tasted like I imagine dog food gravy must taste. Poor Rover! The beef broccoli and beef in the fried rice was so mushy I took one bite and had to toss it. I hope we don't get food poisoning as it's sooo mushy it leads me to believe it's really, really old. Chicken wings deserve 2 stars, the other food...meh, ?no stars if that was an option. I don't think I'd risk it again but, maybe 1 more try for just dry fried chicken wings...I still can't believe all the love for the chicken wings.

I don't understand why people brag about this place. My unbias taste buds weren't the only one being critical of this restaurant as my other friend dining with us that evening shared the same opinion. 2 friends and I came for an early dinner and got seated immediately. This greasy spoon Chinese restaurant is known for their dumplings and dry fried chicken wings. We order 2 kinds of dumplings and some wings. The dumplings fillings were good, but the skin was too thick and lack of texture. The wings were WAY too sweet and as if they were fried and then coated with a thick layer of molasses, honey and some spices. No tasty at all. You can't taste the chicken, there is no crispiness because the sauce made them soagy and the sweetness was so over powering that it made my tongue tasteless after this dish. I can't ?taste or differentiate anything else after eating the wings. My chef friend spoon the remaining sauce on the bottom on the plate and pointed out how much sugar they use to make the sauce. It was disgusting. Feeling dissatisfied from the dumplings and the wings, we ordered some stirred fried noodles with beef and vegetables. The noodles was so soagy and greasy and it has way too much sauce in it. Again, nothing outstanding. The dish was so bad, we didn't even finished the dish. I doubt my friends would go back any time soon. In my opinion, there is mediocre Chinese food from greasy spoon Chinese restaurant that I would tolerate once in a blue moon, and then there is horrible, yacky food that I wish I didn't eat at all. This place is the latter. I will not be coming back anymore.

One of the first Shan Dong places I have been to. My cousin had brought me here when I visited SFO summer of last year for dinner. The wait time was pretty long, but hey, good places, lots of people. thats a good thing right? Its a pretty popular places among the younger population. Great for groups. They have a waiting system where you write your name on a white board at the door with number of people. In a way its an honor system, another way, its a smart system to have 1 less person having to work the front. Fairly organized on that system aspect except it was kind of iffy by reservations. (reservations on written down at the counter at the back of the restaurant whereas the white board is at the front... sometimes theres a small communication issue) the wait time is around 45 minutes to 2 hours. in my opinion, it was worth the wait. the dumplings were fresh hand made. You can tell from the skin that they made it themselves. if i recall correctly, the selections for filling is pork, pork with chinese chives, and something else... The kim chi was really yummy too! one of the best ones ive tried. pretty sure they make it themselves too ! One of the most popular item of order is their chicken wings. I dont know what they put in those wings but man they are good. It has a sweet, slightly spicy to add a little kick flavor. Their noodles were pretty good too. good place to try out if you have the time to wait or call in advance and reserve.

This place deserves 6 stars!!! Visited this place when I was around the SF area. ?My GF says I must try this place because they have the best fried chicken wings in town. ?I didn't think much of it since I have had fried chicken before and thought I check out what the hype is all about. ?Boy was I wrong. ?I am so happy I tried this place out. ? The dumplings are good. ?Service is great. ?It was packed when I visited this place so I had to share a large table with another party. ?not a problem for me, but if your the type that likes to enjoy food on your own table, then the wait will be longer for you. ? The dry fried chicken wings are the s*it here. ?I wanted to slap Colonel Sanders from KFC for lying to me all these years about fried chicken. ?KFC can keep their secret recipe locked up cause they are just going to embarrass themselves if that ever got out. ?The wings are juicy, sweet (cause its glazed with honey!), crispy, and a bit spicy, but just enough to give it a kick. ? Check me into rehab because I am addicted to the fried chicken here! ?Next time I am going to order the party platter of the fried chicken and a bowl of rice the minute I step foot into San Francisco. ? You guys MUST try this place out if you haven't. ?It will change your life. ?The fried chicken is powerful enough to turn a vegetarian into a believer! ?Yes my friends, its that good ... ?The level of awesomeness in the fried chicken dish served at San Tun is EPIC.

We went on a Hungry & Sweaty adventure to San Fran. The first thing we needed to do when we got to the city was EAT ?of course! We walked 2 blocks from the apartment we stayed at our host's recommendation. We got there at closing time, and pretty much manipulated our way into getting a table. First, we said "just let us order something to go" then grabbed a table when a few opened up. They did a great job at getting us in and out of there because they didn't want us there in the first place. We didnt see a menu but picked something off a table that looked good in the interest of time. Everyone seemed like they wanted to yell at us hahaha. Almost 100% of the other patrons were Asian - always a good sign. We got tea, fried rice, and udon. The noodles were enough to feed a small country. They gave us about 10 fortune cookies after they saw me gobble them up. Also, to get us out the door they dumbed them on the table with the check (only $17!) we were laughing so hard at this point we loved it. BOTTOM LINE: Great food, mean service, but who cares if the food is good.

Run in and sign in asap! ?There's always a line here. ? Service-not as attentive as you'd like and you'd understand why when you see a sea of people waiting outside and constantly sitting down and leaving. There were 6 parties ahead of us, and we got seated within half an hour. We ordered: pork dumplings-juicy and flavorful. Shrimp with leek dumpling-my fav! Combination fried rice-when you can't decide which one to get, why not have it all?! It has chicken, beef, seafood, etc. Dry chicken wings-still comes out wet, but with a different sauce. ?The wet chicken wings has mushrooms in the sauce. ?Slightly sweet, juicy, savory, and just good! Wok fried pot stickers-this is where they lost a star. ?They forgot our order and had to be reminded 5 times. ?I even walked up and said we had to get back to the meter. ?The only reason why we were still sitting around was because we wanted our order of pot stickers. ?When it did finally came we had already packed our food and got the check. ? So if you think a dish is taking longer than it should to come out, definitely check because the kitchen does have it's occasional slip ups.

My friends and I were looking for a place to grab a quick lunch, so we came to San Tung because it was only a couple blocks down from my friend's place. The restaurant is medium sized; there are a good number of tables for both small and big parties. We came right around lunch hour rush, but luckily we were able to grab one of the big tables. As soon as we sat down, the line started forming. Got lucky with no wait! The service is reasonable. The staff is friendly but somewhat slow. Also, the food was served promptly, so I can't complain that much. We ordered family style with 7-8 dishes. The food portions and food were just average. Overall, San Tung is just your average Chinese restaurant.

My boyfriend and I were craving chicken wings so with no hesitation we decided to go to San Tung's. When we got there we had to wait about 25-30 minutes for a table for two on a Saturday afternoon. Yes, even for 2 people there was a long wait but the wait is well worth it! San Tung Dry Chicken Wings are the best here. sweet and crunchy!

All i have to say is.... WOW!!!! I love the spicy preserved cabbage they first bring to you. I'm still craving for it! If anyone knows how to make this please message me please!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!?!!!!!!! Their kimchee is the best kimchee I've ever had in my life! I don't really like korean kimchee because it's too garlicky and other pickled vegetables are just too sour but this one is definitely one of the best I've ever had. Next time I'm going to ask if I can buy a Jar from them. The chicken wing was off the hook!

Dried fried chicken = AMAZING!!! If you don't want to wait for a table, just order it to go. It's still the same, with the same taste. I also tried the black bean sauce noodles, and it was okay. I don't think I would order it again. I think it had too much sauce or too little... I forgot. Parking is a hassle in this area when it's super busy. The people there are also not bright when it comes to change.

Alright.. So where to start with this place. First thing I noticed when I got to the restaurant, the line was immense. It was really long and yet, there were people waiting to get in regardless. I went with a group of ten people and our wait was about an hour long. An hour long wait that was well worth it. All this talk of delicious chicken wings had gotten my appetite worked up to a frenzy. We ordered the black bean noodles, chicken wings (of course!), walnut shrimp, and dumplings. Do NOT get the black bean noodles because they were dry and very pasty instead of chewy and moist. The black bean sauce wasn't very flavorful either and it was very bland. The chicken wings are just something that is ungodly. They were hands down the best Asian styled chicken wings I've ever had and I've had quite a bit. At every table that you could see, chicken bones littered the empty plates or people just going to town on them. The walnut shrimp was very succulent and delicious but the sauce was on the heavier side. The dumplings were like any other appetizer dumplings that you might find in another Chinese restaurant. What made this experience unique was that there was a proposal at an adjacent table! The last thing I would expect to witness while eating chicken wings and sauce all over my face is an engagement. It was a big party of Asians (probably about 15 people) and all of a sudden I see a girl gasping at what seemed like a hand floating up from under the table! Then I realized that this dude just proposed to his girlfriend and she accepted! On top of all that it was her birthday and really all I could think was, this is hilarious. Final words: I'd come here again.

The wait is long for a reason, because it's worth it. My month is not complete without having their chicken wings and string beans. Best wings I've ever eaten. Oh, the black bean noodles are awesome too! And the waiters are really nice, specially the one who we call "Boss" (guy with the gel-ed up spikey hair who looks like Bunta from Initial D. Lol) When we come in, he always comes by and asks what took us long to come back-- simple acknowledgements like that definitely makes us feel welcome. =]

My friends and I came here during lunch on a Saturday. The restaurant was filled with people, but there wasn't a wait. We tried their fried dumplings. They came out fresh and hot. They were a lot bigger than we had expected. I thought they were so-so, but my friend loved them. We also ordered wonton soup with vegetables. The soup was mediocre. I've had better. The fish with black bean sauce was different. Would I order these items again? Probably not. The 4 stars is for their famous dry fried chicken wings! They are DELICIOUS! I would definitely order a plate of this for myself. It's crispy and flavorful. I'm drooling just thinking about it =(

This is my go to place for chinese food- comfort food home away from home. The parking can be awful, the wait tortuous, and the service is alright. But when I get my shrimp and leek dumplings, dry fried chicken and string beans, its all worth it. I usually try to get a group of 6 or more to go so I can make reservations, but even then, there is usually a 20 minute. More than once they have no record of my reservation or have it for the wrong day, but i love this place and i haven't found anything else in the city that compares. The dry fried fish, fried rice, and soups are also really good. I'm not a fan of the noodles- I keep trying different ones hoping I'll find one I like, but it just hasn't happened.

Wow this place was great! At first I was a bit skeptical about ordering chicken wings at a chinese restaurant but I ordered them to see what the hype was all about. OMG! I see what everyone was talking about, the dry fried chicken wings are by far the best wings I ever had; crispy on the outside moist and tender on the in and packed full of flavor. You have to stop by and try this place. Also another must is the shrimp and leek dumplings those were great as well. If your in need of more suggestions these are what I found really good the black bean sauce noodles and the sauted string beans. I wish I was able to make two trips here, the next time I'm in the Bay I will stop here first.

The name is "San Tung" but the taste is "altered" to Canton flavor--probably because most of the customers are Cantonese. ?I'm from mainland China and been to San Dong province several times and the food is just not authentic to me.

If you're new here like I was, then make sure that upon entering, turn right and write your name on the whiteboard which is their waitlist. ?I didn't notice it and spent a good 5 minutes looking for a receptionist or someone to list me down somewhere. We ordered: Pork dumplings - ?ok, tasted like xiao long bao without the soup. Black Bean noodle - we didn't like this at all and didn't finish it. ?In our opinion a bit tasteless. Dry Fried Chicken Wings - yummy. ?If you've had korean fried chicken like BonChon, San Tung's version is much better. ?Sweet, crispy and tasty!! ?Must eat with white rice. Dried Fried String Beans - ?My husband loved this. ?Crunchy with a sweetish taste. Funny enough, this is a Chinese restaurant but a lot of their dishes seem Korean inspired (ie the kimchi type appetizer and the korean type fried chicken!) Will be back only for the chicken....

I was taken here with the promise of amazing Chinese food, and the food did indeed exceed my expectations. Since then I have taken guests and friends there four times, and each time the experience exceeded expectations despite my claims of it being 'the best Chinese restaurant I've ever been to'. The service is brisk and down to business. The atmosphere is best summed up as a sparsely decorated large dining room, packed with people. It gets kind of loud, so sitting at one of the large round tables forces you to talk only with folks at either side of you and leaves you out of earshot of those across the table. Given this atmosphere I'd say this is not a date place, but ordering take out would be a perfect way to enjoy the food and choose a cozier setting to enjoy it in. Of course, the quality of the experience ultimately depends on the dishes you order so here are my favorites: First and foremost ~ Dry Fried Diced Chicken Wings Other top dishes ~ Mushu Pancakes, eggplant, stringbeans, beef with broccoli, shrimp dumplings. I have enjoyed many other dishes here, but the ones listed above are what make this place stand out among its peers. Reservations are always a good idea (as well as being prepared to wait outside a bit later than when you made your reservations for... which isn't so bad as long as you come prepared to wait and confident that it's worth it) oh, and it's closed Wednesdays!

Oh, how I dream of you every night! I only use their "take-out" option because I do not want to wait for 2 hours, but I would wait for 2 hours. They have the best Veggie Soup Noodles and (since I dont eat meat)...my boyfriend agrees, their famous Dried Fried Chicken Wings are spectactular. ?Their noodles are homeade and extra chewy, yummmmm.

Ugh. I bet you anything the people who voted 4/5 + are not of Asian decent.... Because: 1] the food is so loaded in MSG 2] better Chinese food in... guess where... CHINATOWN 3] not worth a wait that long as a Chinese place anywhere The only redeeming dish was the fried chicken. The Jajang myun (mien) was disgusting. It was oily, and the sauce was watered down. I will probably never come back here, it's just not worth the hassle.

Some other yelper wrote: "Get anything that starts with "Dried fried" (ie: ?Dried fried chicken, Dried fried shrimp, Dried fried beef (?)). You wont regret it." They were right! However, the Shrimp and Leek Dumplings were delicious! The Steamed Pork Pot Stickers, kind of gross. The Beef and Oyster Sauce-YUK! (San Tung uses that bad, cheap steak(?) that seems to be used in most meat dishes in SF (and lends to the reason why I seldom order any beef dishes in SF Chinese Restaurants). So, to re-quote: "Get anything that starts with "Dried fried" (ie. Dried fried chicken, Dried fried shrimp, Dried fried beef). You wont regret it." Oh, except, skip the beef-no matter how it's prepared, I don't trust it!

Fried chicken wings and nothing else. I've eaten here a hand full of times and everything I've ordered besides the chicken wings have been bad to average. More average than bad. The line is usually at least 30 minutes long, but the chicken wings are worth it. The rest of the food isn't. I can make this at home because most, if not all, the flavors on the chicken are very bold and it's pretty easy figuring out what they put on it. I'm not going to say because I don't want to ruin it for them. Very crowded and nice and cheap place, you HAVE TO order the chicken wings if you eat here, otherwise ?don't bother. That's what they're really famous for. Would I eat here again? Sure, if I felt like chicken wings.

Came here yesterday for an early dinner and dude, it sucked. Where the heck was the FLAVOR?? (forget the MSG?) I was so excited to take my boyfriend and another friend, and was so embarassed after our meal. shrimp & leek dumplings- ok dry fried string beans- bland black bean sauce noodles with beef, squid, and shrimp- no flavor, and it was once piece beef......ou est la boeuf?? wet fried chicken wings- boring (shoulda went for the dry) At least we didn't wait in line for a 1/2 hour for a mediocre meal. We only waited for 5. food: bland, mediocre, pricey for what it was service: what service? ambience: ?dirty dishes and spoons, at least the walls were clean

This place is one of the best places to eat on Irving. Everytime I go I get a table almost right away. I like the service because they don't bug you and wait for you to flag them if you need anything. This kind of place doesn't need a pesty waiter asking you about your meal every 2 seconds. I always order the shirimp and leek dumplings, potstickers, hot and sour soup, original dry diced chicken, original dry fried wings, garlic green beans, black bean noodles, and kung pao shrimp. It is always cooked to perfection. I am getting hungry. =)

As of 10/16/08, paid $7 for lunch special dry fried chicken wings, came with 6 pieces with a lot of white rice. I rather get an extra wing than so much rice. --------------------------------------- i hate that VIP room. ?You have to walk out yourself and wave at a server to get your attention. Every time I've been here, they always seated us in the VIP room. its stuffy and no ventilation, servers forget that you're there. I get better service at in n out, and they don't even have waiter serivce menu is simple. 1)dry fried chicken wings 2)dry fried diced chicken 3)dry fried beef 4)dry fried fish fillets 5) dry fried shrimp.

My fave restaurant hands down! The diced fried chicken, string beans, dumplings, kim chee, black bean sauce noodle, and shrimp with lobster sauce kicks a$$. The wait staff is friendly and quick. They don't take reservations so anticipate on a long wait during rush hours. ?If you come around 5-6 the wait isn't bad at all. ?If you got a big group, go early!

Cheap, good, fast, and busy. East on the wallet and you get a lot of food. Tastes pretty good esp the fried chicken. I would say above average Chinese food for the price! Dishes come a few minutes after you order. Can get busy here since its a pretty popular spot for the younger asian crowd. guess the price is right and the food is good.

I'm also one of the few on this page who do not understand why this restaurant is so popular. I did notice a lot of college students here (maybe it's just a hang out spot)? The food was just OK. The spring rolls were cold in the middle. A lot of MSG in the food. What I didn't like was the waitress never returned my change after paying the bill because she assumed it was all going to be tipped. After 20 minutes of waiting I had to go to the front desk to ask for the rest of my change. I was rudely questioned about whether or not I even paid the bill. For this reason I gave less tip. I shouldn't have even tipped at all.

Once again proving that .. the worse the service... the better the Chinese food. The wings are a must ... the dumplings we had were perfectly cooked, plentiful ... and had lotsa ginger in them.... Too bad the line took forever...and the squeegee board system is all whacked out.. We walked down the street to one of those weird stores that has everything from dish scrubbers and $2 10 packs of toothbrushes... to used Nintendo from the 80's .... We killed some time ... made it back for a delicious meal with leftovers. Review number 966 is now complete.

Well, my friends and I being connoisseurs of chicken wings, decided to go try San Tung's dry style fried chicken wings. They were pretty good, but we unanimously agreed that Toyose's chicken wings were better. Now, when they say "dry", we assumed that they were dry, but they were on a bed of sauce that just tasted like sugar. Take off the chili pepper symbol next to these babies. We also ordered the string beans, which were very fresh. Tasted like they were caramelized with sugar. The black bean noodles were pretty good. The noodles were a bit al dente for my taste, but a pro if you're into that. Also had an order of the shrimp & leek dumplings, along with the beef and black mushrooms. Nothing special there. The service... well.. you're in a Chinese restaurant. No one looks at you and they're all at the round table, snapping the string beans. Parking is hard to find and usually there is a wait. Happy eating!

Like it's probably been said before, the dry fried chicken here is deelicious! We usually get the dry fried chicken, the dumplings and some type of noodle dish. The fried chicken and dumplings are a must. After not coming here for a year or so, I almost ordered the wet fried chicken *gasp*, but the waiter knew better and corrected me. Dinnertime is always busy so we try to get here early. The service isn't the friendliest but the great food makes up for it.

Best Americanized Chinese food I've had in quite a while. ?We came here based on the Yelp reviews (1000+?! ?Is Yelp headquartered here or something?) and weren't disappointed. ?We came for lunch on a Sunday and were surprised to find easy parking, no crowd and no wait. The service was excellent, if you know what to expect from Chinese restaurants (you have to ask for everything, but get it fast and the wait help expects to be flagged down). ?We ordered the dry wings based on the reviews here: very good, but if these are "the best wings in the city," San Francisco needs help. ?The duck was moist and flavorful; the pork hash equivalent was also very good. Two of us ate our fill and had enough left over for an entire extra meal; our bill was $33. ?Phenomenal value.

Many of those people who grew up in the city of San Francisco would agree that this is one of the places to go to when thinking about good food. Every time I go here there is always a line waiting out the door and a sign up sheet that is always full inside. I know that everyone here has their own personal opinion of what they like or dislike but I'll try to be a little different. It seemed like forever since the last time I came here but boy was it amazing. First we started off with some pork dumplings which came out perfectly cooked and steaming hot. It's always nice to get the meal going with a nice light snack that isn't too heavy on the taste buds. Along with some soy sauce and some vinegar and it was a nice refreshing beginning to our meal. Second off were the noodles. Since I never really come here for this dish I decided to try it out. When it came out I wasn't disappointed at all as the plate was perfectly tossed and it was nice to have something different for a change compared to the greasy friend noodles at some others places I have tried out. Third were the rice and green beans. Now I can tell you this is one of my favorites. Not a big fan of veges at all but this place does em right. The marinated taste went perfect with the rice and I actually felt I was eating something healthy! Last but not least who can forget about the dry fried wings. I normally go with the bone in version rather than the boneless because of the old school feel to into the food with your hands. A great mix of spice and seasonings make this an unforgettable dish that almost every other person before me agrees with. If you want to try an alternative try their fish based in the same sauces and spices if your not a chicken fan, same great taste and will satisfy those who doesn't like meat all too much. This place has an amazing turnover rate, always having people come and go rarely ever waiting more than half and hour for a table. Great service for a smaller restaurant and it's nice to see a place really care for it's customers.

Best dried fried chicken ever. period. Oh yeah, the dried fried flounder is great and so are the string beans. ?The dumplings are pretty solid too and add sake into the equation...well, doesn't that make everything 10x better?! Parking does suck around the area and you're almost always faced with a wait but after that meal, trust me, it is well worth it.

The dumplings are yum yum.....the black bean noodles were good.....the beef tripes were good..... and the fried chicken are good, but it's really good if you are white, it's fried chicken with a sugary glaze over it, and you know off the bat that you would not find this in Asia like sweet and sour pork, that dish alone was created white pple, but even if you were asian, I'd try it once. Not much of service, the only time they came around to ask us if we needed anything was when they needed the big table we were sitting at for someone else, hint hint. And one of the girls that we shared our table with was getting emotional and started to tell us that she feels bad, so my buddy asked her if it was from her food and the girl said, no, it's because she broke up with her bf... and I was like.... whoa whoa.... I'm eating here..... so I told her to go to BevMo because they have the one cent wine deals or just head to a dive bar on Irving because alcohol cures everything..... she didn't seem to like my advice.....

My friends and I were discussing who made the best chicken wings. My friend so kindly lifts the veil from over my eyes and introduces me to the beauty which is San Tung. Yes, there is a wait but it's completely worth it! Their chicken wings were scrumptious! Perfect hint of spices and sweetness, total party in your mouth. We also ordered the black bean sauce noodles, which too were good. But a little to much sauce. I'd recommend ordering it on the side, might be a little bit more tasty. I would definitely come back here again, but bring more people so we can order more food!

This review is solely for the dry fried chicken wings. ?Normally I would take into account service, ambiance, cleanliness, and so on and so forth, but this is a Chinese restaurant, so it is expected that all of the said dimensions of measure are subpar. This place is always crowded and I always end up waiting at least 10 - 30 minutes, but the dry fried chicken wings are the best ever. ?I think they put crack in the sauce because I will get some bad-ass cravings that I can only compare to addiction.

I'd heard so much about this place and I finally went there last night with my friend. As soon as I got there I noticed almost everyone ordered the chicken wings and dumplings. So of course we had to order those just to see why everyone ordered them. They're delicious!!! The chicken wings were crispy & tender, and the sweet & sticky sauce was just right. I could've finished the whole order by myself! We also ordered the shrimp & leek dumplings and some stir fry string beans in garlic & pepper, and they're both very good too. I can't wait to go back and try the other dumplings, and will definitely get the chicken wings again! Go there early if you can. When we left around 7pm, there were at least 15 people waiting, and it was a Monday night.

Mmmm dry fried chicken wings and dumplings... hot braised flounder filet and black bean sauce noodles, add to that an order of their sauteed string beans and you've got the makings of a very filling and tasty meal. ? It's worth the wait for a table, but since they kept raising the prices of those oh-so-delicious wings, I'll have to give San Tung 4.5 stars.

If you haven't gathered from the 1250+ reviews, there's only one thing you must order from here: Dry Fried Chicken Wings. They are the equivalent of crack in poultry form. Wait can be long, service can be down-right rude (hence the 4 star), and the rest of the food on the menu is rather forgettable... but the wings, they are heaven.

I will give this place a 5 stars because i was happy with my food! We arrived arounddd 12, first ones to go on the list, so we didn't wait too long. Now this place has been hyped up a lot! Everyone says the chicken wings are uberly awesome and i was craving some wings! We sat, and my friend ordered 2 ord. wings, string beans, potstickers, and dumpling thingies. All this fed 4 ppl. they gave a kimchi like thing to munch on, but the food came out pretty fast. the chicken wing sauce thingy was goood, very satisfactory for salty food cravers, string beans were good tooo, potstickers...were ok....i could make better, haha and dumplings are good. it's one of those asian resturants, and somewhere to go with family, or friends. kinda hard to find parking but not too bad. yuppp, i'd go again to try their black bean sauce noodle thing!

Of course I am not suppose to compare restaurants here against the ones in China, but I cannot help it. They serve good food, though not to the level of real northan Chinese food in China, still the best I have in California. The dumplins are good for mass produced food. I'm sure they can make it better, but when there is a constant line outside of the store, I understand they have to be efficient. The famous Chicken wings are very good. Fushion or northan chinese, sichuan la-zi-ji and American Chinese sauce. Also ordered garlic eggplant, which was cook the northan way and I was very happy. One less star for the taste could be better if they had less customer, and the typical northan style attitude (which actually makes me feel homy).

Best: ?Dry fried chicken (5 star goes here) Good: 1) Leek/shrimp dumpling 2) Five spice beef noodle soup 3) Handmade Noodle (in general) 4) Kimchi Everything else looks and tastes like Panda Express. Bad: 1) Line. ? 2) Service is good - fast, efficient - but servers seem to have this arrogant attitude; very unfriendly. ?If not for the chicken, I would stand up and leave in a sec. Note: Leek/shrimp dumpling always come out just barely "warm"...precooked in batches i guess.....

Instead of just repeating what everyone else is saying... The other positive reviewers are right, this place is very good. When all of the other restaurants have 1 -5 people in them, this place is full with a line waiting out the door. Even at LUNCH! ?Dinner is insane; I can't imagine even getting in, so we stick to getting there when they open for lunch. Get the dry fry chicken and the asparagus. Oh, one thing I forgot to mention: a complaint or two would be the flies in the dinning area were numerous and they take their deliveries through the front door. ?You have to sit there with vegetables being wheeled by you and flies buzzing around. ?But, damn, it's really good so you get over it. ?Minus 1 star for that.

My co-workers and I had our Chicken Wing feast here the other night. ?The dry chicken wings are really still wet, but has a less sweet sauce than the wet chicken wings. ?Next time I will try the chicken wings with the jalapeno and garlic. ?Though the wings were mighty tastey, I felt the after effects of MSG, which I am allergic to. ? I also tried the dry string beans which were delicious and crunchy, along with the 12 pork steamed dumpings. ?The dumplings were mushy on the outside and the goodies inside had a soft consistency.

I would give 3 1/2 stars... I was here last night and this was what we ordered: Shrimp & leek dumplings - ALRIGHT cuz the marination inside the dumpling was not CONSISTENT; half bland and half SALTY and the DOUGH was THICK! Mu-Shu Pork - ONLY the wrapping, hoisin & green onions was delicious. ?The cabbage, mushroom & pork was BLAND and the appearance looked like BAD chop suey; not appealing!!! Their famous DRY FRIED WINGS - not bad. Deep fried w/a generous WET COATING of HONEY sauce along with a few whole dried chili peppers. So really the wings are not that DRY; expect lots of napkins to clean your sticky fingers :p ?The wings would be a lot better if it was WELL MARINATED INSIDE. Once you surpass the fried coatings, the meat is very very BLAND!! Service - eh...what do you expect @ a Chinese restaurant! ?Tiny little restaurant so do expect to wait in line after 6:15pm.

Most notably, the dry fried chicken wings were absolutely delicious, and I highly recommend it to everyone who goes. ?As well, definitely get their dumplings, (Side note: the restaurant's name, "San Tung", refers to a region in China renown for its flour-based foods, such as dumplings) they are outstanding. ?Their spinach crystal noodles were also very good.

One of the best Chinese restaurant I tried in SF. They have great chicken wings. But this time I didn't have it. Ordered garlic sauce with minced pork for lunch (ummm...forgot what it called exactly, lol) Anyway, ordered vegetable steamed dumplings and broccoli ?beef as well at the same time. These two is my dinner and later dinner, since I won't be able to go to bed till 7 am because of the deadline stuff. They all good! Very good actually. BTW, I always order their noodles, not this time, but always, they are good too...

This is my favorite chicken wing spot of all time. ?A friend brought us here one hungry night three years ago and it has become one of my favorite little restos in the city ever since. ? You MUST get chicken wings. ?Dry or wet, they are the most delicious wings you will have. ?Sweet and spicy and fried to a crisp. ?If you order them once you will probably be hooked. ?We order other stuff here too, but just some food that might go well with the wings - sauteed green long beans, sauteed garlic spinach, fried rice, HKG style noodles w/ seafood. ?All very good. ?You also get a side dish of kimchi with every sit-down or take-out order. ?I think its a Korean-Chinese restaurant. ?I dunno, I noticed some Korean paper art one time next to the cash register. The only crappy thing about this place is the wait. ?If you come here in the evening (after 6pm) expect a very long wait for a seat, especially on Fridays and Saturdays. ?I have waited for 1.5 hours once. ?When you do get seated, expect to be put at a table with strangers. ?One time, our 8 seater table had 4 different couples seated there. ? It was kind of akward pigging out on those delicious, messy wings with people sitting right across from you. One way of enjoying their great food and skipping the wait is to call in your order for take-out. ?I have done this a couple of times. ?Just call and place an order and pick it up in 15 mins. ?Same great food and absolutely no waiting. ?I like to see the faces of the people waiting for a seat when I walk out the door with a hot, steaming bag of chicken wings and green beans. This place gets 5-stars and nothing less.

Took my boyfriend here on Chinese New Year Eve to get the dry fried chicken wings - and we both have to agree with the thousands of reviews here that they were the best wings ever. Actually best chicken dish ever known to man. When I dropped my boyfriend off at the airport, his mind was still lingering over the wings. And it was Valentine's Day! Humph! :P Tip: Bring some moist wipes, you will surely lose your table manners when eating these wings.

Fast, efficient and delicious. Came here with a friend on Monday night for dinner. We waited about 10 minutes for a table to open up (which I hear is rare, usually the wait is pretty long). We ordered the Original Chicken Wings and the Noodles with Black Bean sauce. I just have to say the wings were ridiculously good and I am not a fan of chicken wings. I'm definitely going to come back and eat a whole order to myself the next time around.

I must give this place five stars for its delicious dishes. The Dry Chicken Wings here are as good as it gets! The chicken wings are fried to perfection and the sweet and spicy sauce is excellent! Second must have item are their Shrimp and Leak steamed dumplings. The dumplings have just the right amount of filling; dipped them in soy sauce mixed with a lil vinegar...YUM! Some other item you'll likely see on everyone else's table are the Noodles w/Peanut Sauce. The Noodles are not over-powered by the Peanut Sauce; just lightly smothered and doesn't taste heavy. The Mu-Shu Pork is another favorite of mine. The dish is served with stir-fried shredded pork and veggies and offered with a plate of tortilla like wraps; like a Chinese burrito, delish! Only thing bad about this place is the crowd. The lines spill onto the sidewalk every day of the week and all of hours. I've gone here during a week day lunch and had many dinners here. Be prepared to wait in line for thirty minutes plus.

I usually put more thoughts into my reviews. But this time, I only have a few words of advise. Fried chicken wings, dumplings, poor service and long lines. Come during the afternoon if you can, otherwise be prepared for a long wait. Not the best service you can get. The servers are some what snobby, but I guess they can get away with it because of the quality of their food. minus one star for long wait and poor service. Otherwise, 4 stars for their food.

Has got to be one of my favoriteeeee Chinese places EVER. It's the best Chinese food in the Bay and I'm ALWAYS looking for legit places to take my taste buds back to Taiwan. We ordered the famous Dry Fried Chicken wings, which will not disappoint. It's like a party in your mouth. It has more flavors than you could imagine a fried chicken would have. I forget the names of the other dishes we ordered. But we had this super delicious fish and the sesame noodles were yum. Everything else is decent but not anything outstanding.

Wow! My friend took me here last night. I would give it 5 stars, except for the long wait. We showed up at 730pm and didn't get a table until 830pm. And there's very limited room inside, so we waited outside the whole time. There's no place to sit and there are no heat lamps. This is the sunset, and it's get chilly, even in JULY :P Anywayz, we finally got a table. My friend ordered us the Mushu Pork and the Dry Fried Chicken diced. OMG. SO GOOD! The Chicken especially. Get it diced unless you like sifting through bones in your chicken with chop sticks. The sauce on the chicken was super tasty and addictive. Would totally go here over and over, and great for take out. GO NOW!

Okay. So this is my 2nd time coming here. Yes, the chicken wings were delicious as ever.. but everything else wasn't that great. We had several dishes of vegatables and they all seem to have the same sauce..they weren't cheap either. ?The seafood was about $16, and tasted exactly the same as the vegetables for $9...

I was very surprised. Very good. Apparently they pull their own noodles, which are delicious, especially in texture, they really soak up the flavors. Of course the chicken wings are good. Pot stickers are notable. We also had the shredded pork noodle soup which I thought was perfect, great savory flavor coupled with those great noodles. The staff was very friendly and very accommodating, despite it being very crowded.

Came here on my trip to San Francisco with my ex-roomie. She was talking about "the best chicken wings in San Francisco" and I got curious. Since I have no idea what to order, I let her take the reign. So we got the dry fried chicken wings, egg drop tomato soup, black bean sauce noodles, some breaded beef dish (I think it's the sweet and sour beef with brown sauce), beef tripe appetizer and oh, a side of rice. So yeah, enough food to feed 5 people and there were only 2 of us. Verdict: the wings did not dissapoint. Deeeeelicious! I mean, wow, I can't believe wings can be that good. I really like tomato egg drop soups, the mushrooms in that makes it really hearty. The battered beef dish was different than what I've ever had Asian-food wise (and yes, I am certified born and lived in Malaysia asian) and while I had doubts that there actual meat particles in the dish, the batter and sauce was good. I really liked the black bean sauce noodle with the cucumber. I wanna learn how to make that! But seriously, those wings will haunt you but in a good way. So, so good. I wish they deliver to Seattle.

Sweet sweet success! Finally made it here for dinner after having cravings for their dry wings for a month. We ordered the black bean jajangmein, shrimp and leek dumplings and their deliciously addicting dry wings. the noodles were good and had the right amount of chewiness but the sauce was eh. :/ it wasnt as flavorful as i thought it would/could be. add more beans?!?! and why are there potatoes in it?? the dumplings werent anything special, seemed like i could buy a bag from sunset super and boil it myself. the wings were good. no surprises.... o wait, the only surprise was how many I was able to eat. haha

THIS PLACE IS AMAZING! I came here twice and both times was UNFORGETTABLE. We ordered cold noodles, vegetarian dumplings and the famous WINGS. When I first saw the wings I thought, "hellll no! I aint touchin' that!" Since there were red peppers all over the plate. (I can't handle spicy). But everyone told me I wouldn't regret it, and they were right. It was sort of spicy but also with a sweet honey glaze all over it. OMG, I am drooling right now just thinking about it. It was all at a reasonable price. I know that there is normally a LONGG line outside, but both times my friend had been there early already. The one time I took it to go, the manager thought I was in a hurry so he gave me the next wings that came out! FUCKING AWESOME!! I ran home so my family could try it before it got cold. DAMN, that shit is goooooodd! TRUST ME! THE WAIT IS WORTH IT! And hey! Don't hesitate to order ANYTHING on the menu because EVERYTHING is INCREDIBLY DELICIOUS!

I really wanted to like San Tung based on the rave reviews for their dry fried chicken wings, but I just wasn't wowed. They are pretty small wings and while I love the crispy, fried-just-right texture, the sauce is too sweet! It tasted like sugar chicken wings. Otherwise, the blend of garlic and chilies is just right. The mongolian beef (my friend's pick, not mine) was too soft, like they'd soaked the meat in soda for too long. If I come back, I'd try the noodles.

We had to try this place because it's the best reviewed Chinese restaurant on Yelp in SF. First thing first, take my advise, do not eat the spicy pickled veggies they give you unless you want your mouth on fire. I eat pretty spicy, but that thing was way over my league. OK, the dry chicken wings was very good. They were crispy and a little sweet, juicy and tender inside. Pot sticker had very well made skin, but stuffing was not that tasty. We also ordered dry black bean sauce noodle. Mistake! I should have ordered regular or wet black bean sauce instead. They were not bad but just like the name, it's too dry for me. Combo spicy soup noodle, they were pretty good. It was just right on the spicy level. They noodle was very "Q" (crunchy for soft food, Taiwanese way of describing food). If I ever com back to SF, I would come here again and order chicken wing and wet black bean noodle.

I like to describe the dried fried chicken as "edible crack." ?The first time I ate at San Tung was after a Bay to Breakers morn o' fun! ?Since this was about 4-5 years ago, I don't recall if we waited long to be seated. ?I guess it doesn't really matter at this point, because there are days when I just crave their chicken! ?Its tender meat, and crispy sweet and spicy exterior is the best there is out there. ?For friends that come from out of town, and ones that are looking for great restaurant suggestions - I always mention San Tung. ?And they do have other incredible food besides the dried friend chicken. ?They make their pot stickers and noodles from scratch. ?Freshly made - the only way I really like it. ? So, if you are looking for some wickedly delicious Chinese-American food, this is the place to go. ?A large-sized "hole in the wall", so don't expect 5 star service, because it is definitely worth it for the chicken. ?DO IT FOR THE CHICKEN!! .... They also have a dried fried fish as well. ?And it's just as addicting. ?:) EAT ON!

I gave this place another shot after my first visit and it is soooo much better than I first had it! The chicken is delicious. I love their noodles (black bean and peanut ones). They have the best sizzling rice soup. LOVE the pig ears. I like how you can half/half the cold appetizers. After my second visit I go frequent it once a month. I bring visitors here and ?they get hooked! Best time to go is during lunch because there is no wait..actually it's the only time I go now.

San Tung... i adore you. ? Come for the renowned chicken wings and stay for everything else on the menu. ?Be it the sublime dumplings, the noodles, or mapo tofu, its difficult to find a miss that comes outta the kitchen. Am i being effusive enough? Look... i know good authentic chinese food when i see it, and while this isn't necessarily the most authentic, it is that other thing that is much more important... and that my friends is that it's efin delicious. ?Clearly the service and decor and such could use some help, but i know what i'm getting when i walk into a restaurant such as this. ?It's not about the five star service, but about the five star food.

A friend of mine told me that I should try San Tung because their fried chicken has crack in it. ?I was like "Fried? ?Chicken?? ?Crack?? ?The???" ?So when we had the opportunity to try the crack chicken with our favorite eating buddies who live a few blocks away, we jumped on that faster than a drunk sorority girl on a mechanical bull. The dry fried chicken wings came out to us piping hot, fresh out of the fryer. ?It was crispy outside and juicy inside and covered with a sweet sauce. ? The sweet sauce is usually not my thing, but in this case, it worked ok. ?The shrimp and leek dumplings were a bit under-seasoned for my taste, and the wrapper was a tad mushy. ?I would forgo the shrimp and leek dumplings and go with the pot stickers, which were huge and deep-fried, two of my favorite adjectives. ?The noodles we ordered (#16, I think?) were quite good, nice chewy-toothsome texture. ?I do want to try the black bean sauce noodles next time though. The wait for a table was a pain in the ass. ?Apparently, that's the norm here every night of the week. ?The waitstaff can be abrupt, but it's not unexpected for a Chinese restaurant. ?Prices are a tad high for San Tung cuisine, which isn't exactly "dericate" or intricate.

Went here yesterday (the day after Thanksgiving) and it was crowded even at 2 PM. We waited about 20 minutes for a table and were starving when the waiter came. We ordered three dishes plus an appetizer and all the food was really tasty. The fried chicken (as everyone seems to know) is to die for. That sauce is just the right mix of sweet and acid without being too syrupy and the chicken is cooked perfectly. The leek and shrimp dumplings were also fabulous. Really fresh, didn't taste like they had sat in a steamer for hours. My homemade noodles with a spicy sauce and seafood was tasty but the fried chicken was clearly the standout item. I could've eaten a whole other plate of it. Service is OK if a bit rushed since they seem to be very busy all the time. All in all highly recommended.

There's a reason people wait and it's totally worth it. They have the most amazing dry fried chicken wings and pot stickers. You'll find one or both of these items at almost every table. I'm also a big fan of the shrimp & leek dumplings and vegetarian mu-shu pork. If you're in SoMa, go try So. They serve the same dry fried chicken wings and pot stickers along with a lot of other great dishes.

The 5 stars are strictly for the wings. ?Even with all the hype, they did not disappoint! ?The dry fried chicken wings were ridiculously hot when they got to our table, but we were so eager and hungry we dug right in. ?Then, once I realized how good they were, I couldn't bear to stop eating. ?Definitely worth burning my mouth for! Warning: After trying these once, you'll crave them frequently. ?My cravings start as soon as the pains from overindulgence begins to fade.

I can really only talk about the Dry Fried Chicken Wings here. ?Everything else is mediocre. The chicken wings definitely lived up to the hype (5 stars). ?It came to us piping hot and full of flavor. ?I've never eaten wings like this before. ? We also ordered the dried fried green beans which wasn't great, the dumplings also not that great, noodles and fried rice which again was not great. ?I could've cooked all that at home. ?Rest of the food (2 stars). I would come back to this place because the Wings are enough to keep a person coming back.

so after hearing about their infamous chicken wings... i had to come try them out for myself. I went in today around 3 to avoid the crowd and ordered the famous wings to go. i ended up doing some grocery shopping as well so my wings ended up being not as hot As soon as i got home, i dug into the wings and of course... they were delicious!!! after my 4th wing though, i have to admit, that the chicken started to taste too sweet. too much honey maybe? either way.. they were definitely really tasty wings and i'll be back next time to sit down and eat! that way.. i'll taste them while they're hot and try some of their other yummies!

My bro-in-law and his lady were sweet enough to take us out for dinner to eat here tonight. ?It was everyone's first time, and we were super excited to try it. After all, we had heard SO much about it! Parking was a bia, but luckily we got a spot across the street within 5 minutes of looking. For 6 of us (4 adults, 1 toddler, 1 infant) we waited about 20 minutes for a table. We ordered the Dry Fried Chicken and the Wet Fried Chicken, Garlic Eggplant, Pork Fried Rice, Egg Rolls, Noodles in Black Bean Sauce and the Pork Dumplings. Yes the chicken and Garlic Eggplant was very tasty, the Eggs Rolls tasted like they should, but I must admit, everything else was BLEH! Everything tasted kind of bland. Also, I drink LOTS of water, and we didn't get any refills on our water the whole time. (HORRIBLE!) Anyways, it was cool to finally try this place, but I think the wait was SO not worth it, even just for the chicken. The service was so-so besides the water issue. I really don't get all the ranting and raving about this place? As you can probably guess, I won't be back.

Get the chicken wings. Get two orders of chicken wings, then get a few more. They're so good. The other stuff I've had here was meh, but the chicken wings... Always seems to be a large crowd waiting, so i would suggest take-out. Also, I think they use a lot of MSG, so if that's not your thing, watch out.

Ridiculously crazy in this place. Get ready for a long wait. ?People constantly going in and out. The draft from opening and closing of the front door gives you a chill you can't even enjoy a good meal. So, wear a jacket on a chilly night while dining. Plus, people coming and going from ?their nonstop takeout walking down the aisle looking and breathing over your dinner --- Nah ah!!! Too crowded and too noisy. Those are the downsides. Now, the upsides. Fast service. Cool, calm and collected servers despite the craziness. The dry fried chicken wings (crispy sweet not too spicy) was enjoyable. The 3rd star was actually for my kids liking their specialty wings. The fam also enjoyed the smoked tea duck with the bun and hoisin sauce. Pretty good...Their combination handmade chowmein noodles I've had better. Cherry pork was so..so..a more expensive version of the Peking pork spareribs. After all that, the time spent looking for a street parking, the long wait to get seated and the craziness while dining --- I just don't know if the wings and the tea duck are worth coming back for???

Another over-rated place by Yelp. Nothing so special about the chicken wing. I tried both dry and wet chicken wings, the sweetness is overpowering other taste buds. The string beans is also sweet and I don't like it sweet. Their black bean noodle is pretty good (the only entree I ordered that is not sweet) eventhough everyone says it's bland. Definitely dont go to this place if you are diabetic. With the waiting and all, it's not a sweet place for such sweet (literally) food. It's all hype, no hits.

Been here a few times but never came to writing a review, so here I go. Decent Chinese food at a fair price, some stuff are really good and some I probably wouldn't order ever again. The black bean sauce noodles are really good. The only gripe I have isn't with the flavor, it's exactly with the bowl it comes in. It would help if they actually put the noodles on a plate or a bigger bowl. It's pretty hard to get a good mix since the sauce just sits on top of the noodles. Tried mixing it but didn't do a good job, so one time I literally gave my friend a bowl of heavily drenched black bean noodles. Other than that... a good dish! The soups... meh. I've had better... the sizzling rice soup wasn't even that crunchy and the flavor just isn't there. Maybe I'm just used to having some very flavorful homecooked Chinese soups. Cherry pork was a good dish, but basically tasted like sweet and sour pork to me. One of my favorite dishes to order usually are the beef with green onions and this place doesn't disappoint on it either. The onions aren't there to just make the dish look good... eat the beef with it! I've tried both the dried and the wet chicken, both are good. Even though it says dry, its not what you think. So it'll still come slathered in sauce... but it's fried. So don't stare at the dish when it comes to you covered in sauce thinking they gave you the wrong dish.. it's correct! Tried the Szechuan Tea Smoked Duck... sounded really good in the description but it was really not that great. Flavor wasn't that good, the duck pieces were pretty big and dry. The funny thing is that the duck pieces come with a bone... so you can't wrap it in the buns without ripping the meat off the bone... I kind of just expected something like peking duck. lol. The walnut prawns... I was really craving it... but something about the shrimp here just isn't that good. I'm not expecting fresh caught shrimp but the shrimp just left this nasty after taste so I won't be ordering that here. Got the dry fried flounder.. good dish, again expect it to be slathered in sauce even though it says dry. ?The mushrooms, bamboo shoots, and snowpea dish is pretty good. The black mushrooms with baby bok choy is also very good. Not bland or too salty. Tried the seafood chow mein... was decent, but again something about the seafood that leaves an odd aftertaste. Overall, food here is decent. Does get busy so be prepared to wait. Always a line and if you're sitting by the doors, people waiting may be a bit too close to you.

Everyone knows it, everyone talks about it and so will I! Dry Fried Chicken Wings are 10 out of 10 every time. You can also order them diced, which somehow seems like there's more food. Winners: - Shrimp and Leek Dumplings - Black Bean Sauce Noodles - Dry Fried Fish - Green Beans Drive by in the evening and there's 10 people waiting outside, every night. Like many patrons, you can go at 7pm and wait an hour. That even happens at 12 noon. My recommended times are 2-5:30pm: 15 minute wait!

During my visit to SF to see my sister she recommended that I MUST try san tung for the chicken wings. We went at around 6pm on a weekend and the line was out the door! It was about an hour wait to seat 3 people but once we got in the food did come out pretty quickly. We ordered the Dry Fry Chicken, five spice beef noodle soup, dry black bean noodles, string beans, and some fried dumplings. The portion sizes are really big and the chicken wings they give you are very meaty, with a hint of spice, the sauce was so yummy! The chicken wings are definitely a hit and every time i go back it never fails to lose it's "WOW"! And ever since then I made it a tradition to eat San Tung at least once when I'm in town, because its THAT good. I've already been here 3 times in a span of 2 years and its still on the top of my list. San Tung will be my most recommended place for anyone visiting SF, the wait was worth it. But if you don't want to stand in line for 1 hour then i suggest you get there during slow time (4:30pm-5:45pm)

Thinking we'd skip the lines and long waits, I headed over to San Tung on a Tuesday for a late lunch with the family. ?I was fooled by the easy parking (like that ever happens in the Sunset). ?We walked in and there were still a few people ahead of us waiting. ? Foiled again! No fear, we were soon seated after a few minutes. ?Even saw some friends finishing up their lunch while we were waiting. ?Too bad they were at a small table or we could have squeezed in to join them. ?Anything to start digging in to the wonderful dishes that San Tung puts out. ?But I digress... We started with the steamed pork dumplings, ordered some spinach with clear bean thread noodles, and of course the dry fried chicken - diced this time. ?When I'm that hungry, I don't want to mess around with bones, even though you do get a juicier flavor from the original wings. ?Rice was necessary to suck up any sauce that was left from any dishes. ?Pork dumplings were served first and were gone in seconds, before any other dish came out. ?Chicken and spinach dish were easily devoured, with only a pool of thin red peppers left that you use to dare someone to eat. ?You know the place is good when you hear tables full of chatter until the food is put down in front of people and there's that sudden silence that only comes when grubbing is in full effect. ?Nice thing is that they have lunch specials, though everywhere I looked, everyone had a plate of dry fried chicken and rice in front of them. ? Only reason for one less star was because we asked for a fork for my son twice and it never came. ?At least it forces him into survival mode to get his chopstick skills up. ?Next time I'm getting dry fried "fill in the blank here" and some of their awesome noodles.

My family used to make occasional visits to this restaurant, often enough to judge if the quality of their food has changed. Now, their dumplings are nothing spectacular. Their black-bean sauce with noodles definitely tastes plain. There was absolutely no flavor I could get out of the dish and I was definitely disappointed. There was more food that I tried that was almost just as disappointing. Their food isn't horrible, but it isn't the best you will be able to get in San Francisco. The service, as I recall, is not horrible. However, I distinctly remember a man who was particularly rude. They didn't ignore me or my family for service though, which is never bad and is a plus in my book. Would I recommend this place? Probably not. I'd have another place to recommend you to eat similar foods for a better experience.

This place is delicious, cheap, and authentic. If I could give it 6 stars I absolutely would. I went here 2 times this winter break, even though I was only in SF for 5 days - just couldn't get enough. My b/f and I split the sweet and sour chicken and moo shu pork during both visits. The moo shu pancakes were hands down the best I've ever had at a Chinese place - I wouldn't mind eating them on their own. The sweet and sour sauce was equally amazing - sticky and the perfect flavor. And their rice... oh man, their rice. Being an Asian food lover, I often judge places by the quality of their white rice. A good Chinese place will have good, sticky rice, whereas a bad one will often have drier, unappetizing rice. San Tung's rice was just the right level of sticky, and just like the pancakes I wouldn't mind eating it alone. I was in heaven. I also got to try the wet, dry-fried chicken wings. At first I was skeptical (after all, what kind of authentic Chinese place is well known for their chicken wings?) But, we ended up trying and LOVING them. Super yummy! The "wet" dry-fried wings are covered in a unique tangy sauce and just like the rest of the food I had here, I definitely recommend them. Just writing this review is making me wish I could have their food again. If you're in the city, do yourself a favor and visit San Tung. It's worth any line you'll have to wait in. One last note: the service here is not bubbly and outgoing, but they will bring you everything you ask for, don't worry.

dry fry chicken wings and pot stickers - 5 stars!!! the other stuff we ordered (green beans, mu shu, eggplant) was just ok. the wait can get pretty ridiculous. using a whiteboard to keep track of people waiting is a terrible idea. it's worse than dealing with the raffle ticket lady at hk lounge. people were constantly monitoring the board to tell the host who was next. the board filled up so there were all these division lines and arrows pointing everywhere. well worth the wait though!

dry fly chicken wangs! Simply a masterpiece. I usually just order this to go. Screw waiting on a long list written on dry/erase board with the whole damn Chinese community outside with you for dinner time. It's loud and cramped in the front of the store. You're screwed if it's raining, too. Tried many other dishes they don't stand out compared to the chicken wings but they're good too.

Since the "secret" is obviously out... This is my favorite chinese food in the city. I am not a chinese food expert though so any knocks on "authenticity" I cannot answer to. ?Don't try go for dinner if you are really hungry and it's after 5:30pm, you will just get hungry and angry while you wait. I recommend lunch - you almost never have to wait. No ambiance - just the food. In my order of personal favorites: 1) Dry fried chicken wings 2) If you don't feel like getting your fingers sticky, get the dry fried fish. Same sauce but more of an entree dish. 3) Pork dumplings 4) Green beans 5) Pork and green onions 6) Shrimp in black bean sauce 7) Noodles (But I don't like their black bean sauce on the noodles. It's very bland in this presentation) ?The chicken soup noodles are great when you are not feeling well 8) Any of their soups. I love the hot and sour, the sizzling rice, and the tomato egg flower.

Wait, how have I not reviewed this place yet? My girlfriend and I make a pilgrimage here about once every month or two. We plan the whole evening around it. City CarShare? Check. Get off work a little early to get a table? Check. Big appetite? Check. A one-night break from my diet? Check. We always get the diced dry fried chicken, the string beans, and some dumplings. Those three things are THE BEST. We sometimes add one more item if we are feeling especially gluttonous. The other items are good but not up to the level of our mainstays. That is fine. Actually now that I think about it we should get the dry fried flounder more often. Parking really isn't that bad. I always drop my girlfriend off and then go find a spot, maybe two or three blocks away. I don't mind the walk, and it is good to work off the chicken at least a little bit. Just writing this review...I really want to go back soon.

First of all, parking is a huge hassle in this area. Do not bet on finding parking withing a 1 block radius the moment you arrive. Chances are that you will have to walk at least a couple blocks in the cool and crisp Sunset weather. When you get to the restaurant, don't be surprised to wait in the queue to be seated (you may have noticed this circling around the restaurant 10+ times for a great parking spot). On top of the wait, there is no hostess to take jot down your party. You have to do this yourself on the whiteboard. Finally the food is not the quickest to come out. Their popular dishes seem come out in batches where they make enough for about 4 orders. With all that being said, is the restaurant still worth it? Yes most definitely. The food tastes great. The dishes and taste is uniquely different from typical chinese (primarily cantonese) restaurants in the area and most of SF. The dried fried chicken wings and potstickers are staples. A word of advice for these 2 dishes: they come out HOT from the kitchen. I made the mistake like many others of trying to devour it but instead burning my lip/tongue/mouth.

San Tung is one of my favorite restaurants in SF. The owners are Korean and Chinese so the food reflects buth cuisines. My favorite dishes are the homemade dumplings (shrimp and pork), the ja jung myun and the cham-pong seafood noodle soup. They are famous for their fried chicken wings but I find them a bit too heavy and sweat for my tastes. Their home made noodles are incomparable. The service is a bit curt until they get to know you, if you are a regular they tend to throw in a free appetizer. The atmosphere is not fancy - lazy susans on some large shared tables, clean but certainly not focused on interior design. But that's not what you come here for.

Three guys and one girl equals original dried fried chicken wings, cherry pork lunch special, curry beef lunch special and dumplings. Result? Ate every edible morsel and licked off the savoring sauces on each of the plates. Now for the serious stuff: We came after the lunch rush so we got our seats in 5 minutes. No sharing today, yeah! ?However if it's busy and space is limited, be open to sharing a big table. Otherwise, wait an hour and starve. One star taken off for the not giving us soup for lunch special, giving 1 bowl of rice for 2 lunch specials and setting up the table for 3 people when obviously, there were 4. ?Unless....girls don't count because they don't eat..... Service is usually pretty good. I don't know what happened this day.

Excellent Chinese food for Korean folks. I live within blocks of several Cantonese-speaking Chinese restaurants and Vietnamese restaurants run by ethnic Chinese. I like the food that I can get at these southern-style restaurants. However, sometimes I really crave northeastern-style Chinese food, like the kind that is served in Chinese restaurants in Korea. San Tung perfectly satisfies my craving. The menu has Korean names written next to some of the menu items that are beloved by Koreans, like ja jang myeon, tang su yuk, jjam bong, braised sea cucumber. The food even comes with a dish of Chinese-style gimchi. This restaurant is almost always crowded, but the food comes out quickly and the waitstaff are breezily efficient, so the wait is often surprisingly short. I've been told that take-out service is reliable: just call ahead and they will have the food prepared correctly and on-time. I recommend the cold jellyfish salad; it's well-seasoned with mustard and has a pleasing proportion of jellyfish to cucumbers. The sauteed scallops are also very good and surprisingly fresh-tasting.

OK. OK. This place like every other place in the city has been reviewed a million times. So why should my review make a difference. Because I love food! Good food. I'm picky, and truly interested in helping everyone get connected with good food, not just adding another notch to the yelp bed post so I can look cool. San Tung. Man, this IS the best chinese food in the city. I won't mention any one dish because they are all extremely tasty. You can't go wrong ordering any of their dishes. BUT I will worn you of this: If you live in the sunset call-in for pick-up. DO NOT attempt dining in unless you have a lot of time to spare. There is always a line out the door, especially in the evening time for dinner.

All I can say is...those chicken wings are to die for. I don't think I've ever had anything quite like them. I brought two of my friends from out-of-town here the other day and they both keeled over after their first bites. We ordered a second plate of chicken wings which everyone ate in complete silence. We just sat there. Gnawing on every single last, succulent, sweet, sticky piece of meat that was left on the bone. And then we went into food comas...I think I'm still full. On a side note, I love the dumplings here...I don't know why other people don't seem to like them. The service here could be a bit better, the people tend to be rather unfriendly...almost to the point of being rude. If the food wasn't so good, I would be bothered more by the quality of service.

Err... yeah so the place is aiight... We ordered their chicken wings that everyone raves about and I'm not sure what the dealio is. Deep-fried chicken wings with a cornstarch based sweet-savory sauce. I thought it was too sweet. I prefer either dry-fried or paper-fried chicken wings because the skin gets a lot nicer and why else would you eat chicken wings? But they were still good, just overrated. Their chajangmyun is pretty standard Korean-Chinese fair. Nothing too special here beyond the usual. I prefer the toothsome qualities of hand-pulled lo mien rather than machine extruded, die-cut noodles. They skimp on the fancy ingredients like sea cucumber, which to me was always my favorite part. Boo. Hmm I'm not sure what people mean by black-bean sauce noodles... The base for chajangmyun is mostly tien mien jahng (sweet flour sauce) with a little fermented black beans added in for pungency and depth. Conclusion: Not a gastronomic epiphany, but for the price it doesn't have to be.

This restaurant is situated in the shadow of the Death Star (UCSF Medical Center, for those of you in the know), but despite that fact, I get a warm fuzzy feeling whenever I think of this place. Potstickers: ?REALLY tasty pork and Napa cabbage filling and wok-fried so they are super crispy. Black bean sauce noodles (ja ja myung): ?I kinda hoped for a slightly darker and earthy sauce, but still wonderful nonetheless. Orginal Dry Fried Chicken (dry) (diced or Wings): ?GET DICED. ?I know wings are traditional, but getting the diced yields a larger breading to meat ratio which equals frickin' awesome spicy savory crunchitude. I'll be back!

Dry fried chicken wings, dry fried chicken wings, dry fried chicken wings. ?Maybe if I say it three times, those wings will appear whenver I want just like Beetlejuice did. Seriously, there should be an addiction support group for these fried pieces of poultry, because everyone and anyone will become hooked while chowing down these crispy, sweet, slightly spicy wings of glory. I hate waiting for food, yet time after time again, my bf and I will come to San Tung's and patiently wait for those waiters to call our names off the dry erase board. ?We always order the dried fried chicken wings, the green beans, and some kind of noodle dish. ?Let's just say the other dishes play second fiddle to the wings, only because the chicken wings are THAT good. ?The cherry pork is also a good thing for those that want a tangy, sweet & sour pork-esque (but way better than your average) dish. My only issue with this restaurant (and most Chinese restaurants in general) is that...they're skimpy with the napkins! ?Moreover, the napkins are so thin that they don't absorb ANYTHING, and let's face it --- Chinese food is sometimes too saucy and greasy. ?So my bf made the best discovery on earth when he found extra napkins stored in the divider by the front door...we always grab those ourselves before we sit down. Service isn't that great, and I've seen them carry the garbage out the front door one too many times during normal service hours. ?Sometimes they try to make you sit with complete strangers if you're a smaller party...which is too awkward for me since I want to eat my wings in peace. ?However, that doesn't matter because trust me...you'll be back for more.

Prepare yourself for a great down to earth chinese meal. ?San Tung is famous for its dried fried wings. ?Anyone who didn't stop here just because the light was on orders a plate of those caramelized-slightly spicy wings... ?The dumplings, either boiled or steamed, are also excellent. One of my favorites is the noodle soups. ?The noodles are freshly home made. ?You can't go wrong with any of the soups, just watch out for the spicy broth... It is very spicy. ?Be prepared for some wait any day of the week. ?The wait is worth it.

I really wanted to try the popular dry chicken wings and I finally got the time right before work. This was around 2:15, so we got seated right away. When we walked past this place on Sunday, I told my friend I've never ate here. She gave me crap about it since I do live around the area. I felt ashamed, so I made sure to try it. We ordered the original dry chicken wings and hot and sour soup. They give you complimentary kimchi, and when I looked around, nobody ate their kimchi. So I just picked at it. Our food came quickly, that's why I love eating during off-hours. The hot and sour soup was good, nothing too special. The chicken wings were good, fried, and good. It was also very sweet, not what I expected. I thought it would be more spicy than sweet, but I was fine with it. It's not something I would eat every week because it's that unhealthy, but it was worth it. I would like to try the dumplings someday too.

Their dry fried chicken is bomb-diggity!!! ?The chicken is coated in some sort of sweet syrup concoction that has a hint of citrus, making the chicken ?extremely addictive. ?It sounds weird, but it's very tasty. We usually order the dry fried chicken, braised fish and garlic spinach. ?This is my favorite Chinese restaurant. ?The only draw back is the wait. ?If you have a big group and you're going for dinner, expect a wait. ?People line up out the door. ? When I go with friends, we usually drop someone off in the front, while we park, so they can put our name on the list. ?This place can get extremely busy. ?If there was a 3.5 rating, this place would receive this score solely because of the waiting list.

Bottom Line: Good Chinese, Great Price, always a wait, service is average, seating and waiting could be better. Positives: -Good Foods. Dry Friend Chicken. It was Savory, Sweet and Spicey.. Dumpings. It has fresh fillings and awesome skin. Tomato Egg Flower Soup. They use Seafood Stock to make it Mushu Wrap. Great skin and tasty filling - Price. $15/head including tip&tax and 1-2 boxes of leftovers per person. Averages: - Average Foods KimChi. A little bland, but it's a freebie. Jia Jhang Noodle. Sauce was not strong enough, but not bad tasting Pot Stickers. Only slightly better than store bought. Long Beans. Nothing special. - Service. Not too many smiles or much small talk, but it is polite and efficient. Negatives -Always a wait. We were there on a Tuesday at 1:30pm and had a 20 minute wait to get seated -Too small for its own good. Seating is thus cramped and waiting area is too small. This contributes to the "always a wait" phenomenon above.

really has gone a bit down hill in the past year. I usually come here for the jjam bbong (spicy seafood noodle soup), jja jjang myun (black bean sauce noodle) and the chicken wings. The spicy noodle soup has gone down hill. ?It's not as spicy, they have started to skimp on the noodles and there is too much broth in comparison to seafoood/veggies/noodles... it's still a good place to try but it's not crazy good as it was when i first tried it.

This is crave worthy fried chicken. ?In fact, this is always on my list of spots to hit whenever I'm visiting friends in the bay area. ?I can only vouch for the chicken and both the dry fried and the wings are equally delicious. ?We usually end up ordering both whenever we go. ?My friends also seem to like the sesame and black bean noodles, but I find them a bit gummy. If you're planning on going with a large group get there early and be prepared to wait. ?The place is mad busy and don't be surprised if you're asked to share a table with another group. ?The prices are reasonable and the staff are generally very friendly.

It is all about the sauce. ?The chicken here has an extra crispy texture to it with a very thin batter. ?The sauce has a honey thickness, slightly sour, with a chili and a soy base. ?It is sweet and spicy with an extra zest. Expect a wait. ?Also, expect typically unfriendly but fast service you'll find at successful Chinese restaurants. ?(This is not a cultural knock. The way I understand it, Chinese restaurants are mostly staffed by relatives and therefore the staff don't really receive the tips, so why work hard for it) The rest of the menu is typical fare. ?Oh...and seriously people, it is asinine to bitch about parking in San Francisco. ?It is like bitching about the hills.

What can I say? Been here many times and the food is great every time. I'm a fan of dry fried anything. Here's what we usually order Dry fried beef, sting beans, chicken (both wings and diced). dry fried fish, pot stickers and dumplings. We also get the seafood over wasbi noodles if there are enough people, it's a big plate. and last night, we ordered the beef with snow peas, which was excellent. So here's my take, dumplings - just ok, average, then again this ain't a wonton/dumpling house, it's not expected to be great. pot stickers-good, only because it's deep fried. for some strange reason, the same deep fried pot stickers at So noodles was better. dry fried beef - is a must have. dry fried chicken - must have, i like the wings but love the diced chicken. I guess it's smaller and a little crispier, but I do like both. dry fried fish - i like it, not too many of my friend do. sauce is the same, but i do admit the fish itself can be better. string beans - again, i like it, but not everyone does, it can be very salty at times because of the preserved vegi/pickle(?), but i don't mind salty. there is one dish i will never get, jajang mein. It just doesn't do anything for me. I actually didn't realize this was a Korean dish, considering I order this all the time at Taiwanese restaurants. I see people ordering it all the time so it can't be that bad, just not for me. so yea, great place, great food....one of my favorite spots.

5 stars just for the dry fried chicken. ?Make the journey out to the Inner Sunset, put your name on the list, grab a beer and wait 30 minutes for a table, order the chicken and enjoy... The place was crowded but it was a Saturday night when I went. ?Once sat down the waiters were all over us. ?The order was super quick and the food came out right away. ?Looking around the restaurant it seems like the appetizers are a hit so next time I might just do a few apps and maybe the won ton soup because that was pretty grubbing too.

The food here is always consistent, always yummy. I usually like to try different dishes at restaurants, but at San Tung, I always and will always stick with the dry fried chicken wings. I can rave on and on about them, but you all have probably heard/read it all. As for the black sauce noodles and pork dumplings that everyone else raves about, I find them an interesting combo. I always thought the noodles were extremely thick in sauce and flavor, and the dumplings a little less flavorful on the spectrum. These would not be my regular dishes. ?The cherry pork and beef & snow peas on the other hand, are more to my liking. Anyhoo, the chicken wings themselves are worth the 5 stars. Check this place out, and you'll see that every table has a plate of this chicken (wing or diced-- I prefer and will get wings all the time, but diced is a yummy boneless treat too!). Oh, I find their fortune cookies' fortunes extra appealing too.

As other yelpers have mentioned, the food is pretty good in this unassuming restaurant. ?While waiting for our table, my dining companion and I chuckled when a woman asked another patron what the difference was between San Tung and the poor, empty Chinese restaurant across the street. ?"Is the food any better?" she asked. ?Well, let's figure that one out, based upon the wait at San Tung vs. the empty tables at the other restaurant. In any case, the shrimp and leek dumplings were very nice, I had the best potsticker since my beloved Yuen Yung in Menlo Park closed years ago and the chicken wings were really nicely done!

I won't bore you with details as everybody has already said it. 3 stars cause it really isn't as special as the 1300 reviews. ?It is quality food and they run a tight ship compared to most chinese restaurants. ?However, I'd choose my favorite Chinatown spots over going here. ? They realllllly love to use salt and white pepper...if they only used the right amount I'd probably give this place a 5. ? Maybe I need to go back and sample again.

I am very picky when it comes to Chinese / Chinese-American restaurants. We went to San Tung on a Thursday evening about 9:00 pm. No wait. Plenty of space. We got MuShu Pork & Fried Potstickers (with Ground Pork & Chinese Chives) Everyone else was getting the wings - next time I want to try them. MuShu was the best I've ever had. Potstickers were great and not overly fried or greasy. However the pork inside seemed a bit raw... We've just moved into the neighborhood and I can't wait to come back to San Tung.

Just happened to be in the Inner Sunset and thought I could tick off another item from the 7x7 must eat foods list. Yes, I had the dry fried chicken wings. The lunch special came with rice, soup and they serve a yummy kimchi on the table. And it only set me back $7.15. The restaurant serves a busy lunch crowd and I was jealous of the other tables since everything looked great. I wish I was not dining solo so I could have taken on a variety with friends. Try it.

San Tung is ok, but they go a little too far with the MSG, and the dry fried chicken wings are pretty decent, but honestly not that much better than any chicken wings you'd get at a bar or fast food place. The dumplings are fine, but nothing really special, and the rest of the dishes get overwhelmed with MSG to the point where that's all you can taste. This place isn't bad, but not really worth the long wait you're going to have to endure, even at off hours.

I have now been blessed by the almighty Dry Fried Chicken Wings on three separate occasions - first, take-out; then, lunch; and most recently, dinner. It is getting increasingly better each time. You must get the version with the sauce for the full sweet-savory and fried-wet double-foil effect. The other quality dishes are the shrimp and leek dumplings (unique texture), chicken with black bean sauce, and the dry sauteed string beans. But the star is the chicken wing. In fact, my parents celebrated this first taste of San Tung heaven by taking home TWO orders back to Southern California, one for them, one for my aunt. And if you have a look around while you wait for a table, you'll notice a large majority of patrons will have this dish front and center. (By the way, our wait on a Tuesday at 7:30pm was about 10 minutes, and during the course of the meal it never appeared longer than 15 minutes for anyone.)

Just to add to the already 1000+ reviews -- Pretty much the best chicken wings i've ever had in my life - sweet, spicy, crispy, and juicy. At the end, I think I probably overstuffed myself on rice just so I could sop it up in the leftover chicken sauce/syrup. I think everyone should make it a point to eat at San Tung once in their life, I actually think it's on the every publication of what to do when you visit SF - so, i'm glad I can cross that off. I also tried the other things they are known for like the black bean sauce noodles and dumplings. Boy, I WISH Seattle would come up with a chinese/korean place like this. Cant wait to come back!!

Ok, so everyone is right about the dry chicken wings, they are to die for! Also, if you like the chicken wings, you'll definitely love the string beans as well. I think they're made with the same sauce, but don't quote me on that. People also seem to like the cold or hot noodles, but i'm not a big carb eater, if you are.. definitely try. The only down side is their limited English speaking skills, and the fact that they don't take reservations under 6 people. I called to try to make reservations for a party of 4, but the dude on the phone said "sorry, no reservation under 6" and hung up on me! I must admit, it was kind of funny at the moment, but definitely bad for business! If it wasn't for that, they would've received at least 4 stars from me. Bitter much? Definitely.

San Tung came highly recommended from a friend, but I was not impressed. ? Deep friend dice chicken: sauce was too sweet. ?Not much chicken. Zajiang mien: noodle was decent, but the sauce was way too overpowering and too sweet. Pan friend string beans: undercooked and borderline raw. Mushu pork: wrapper was a bit thick, but the filling was good. I will not go out of the way to try this restaurant again, but may come back for the Mushu dish if I am in the neighborhood.

The food here is pretty good. Not the typical type of Chinese food you'd expect. They're northern Chinese food and look like a comfort, family Chinese food. It was delicious. Their house shrimp is as fantastic as the tea smoked duck. But I could feel some MSG in their food. I'm not a big fan of MSG...since I'm sensitive to it. Otherwise, everything is tasty. The prices are a little higher than I'd like. They charged $4.40 per beer and the entrees are easily over $12 per plate. Prices didn't seem like it would be an issue though since the restaurant was packed when we went there.

Addendum: 3 small Asian girls, 3 plates of wings. All wings finished. That.is.how.good.this.place.is. Saucy dried fried chicken wings (how do they do it?!). Oxymoron? Yes. Wonderfully delicious to the point that I told my friend "If I were on death row, this would be my last meal"? Double yes (seriously, I'm aiming to complete the SF 7x7 100 Best things to eat+drink before you die, and I always end up just going to San Tung). (Chow mein my roommate ordered also good). However, it is fricken difficult to grab a hold of a waiter, and the wait is generally always long (and it seems eternal after you know what heavenly morsel awaits you). A plate of wings will feed two fairly well (I want to say ~10 pieces), but be careful because on many occasions, my friends and I became greedy and ordered more plates, only to realize later we couldn't finish. I generally hate overhyping things, but it is not overhyping when the hype meets expectations.

My parents are creatures of habit. A fact that comes from a neverending search for comfort food. And because they of this mindset, on the occasions that I've been in the city this year, we have always eaten here. And we have always eaten the same thing. It never gets boring and I suppose I should credit that to the fact that I'm in town for very little time out of the year. That doesn't take away from the flavor factor, however. Dry fried chicken. Dry fried squid. Eggplant. Mongolian beef. A large bowl of rice. Or two. ? Everytime those steaming dishes appear, our table looks crowded, among sauce-laden dishes, cups, chopsticks and a pot of tea. And hunger is sated. That said, I believe that those who have a bit of negative to offer aren't really concentrating on the job at hand: eating and savoring. Keep life simple. It ain't that hard.

Came here for a late lunch after a morning at Golden Gate Park. ?Sure enough, there was a wait, but it was managed efficiently and fairly. ?YMMV on service depending on the waiter (helps if you have a cute asian girl in your party) Dumplings - Since the place had "Dumpling King" written on its windows, we gave the Shrimp and Leek dumpling ?and the regular Pork and Cabbage dumplings a try. ? The shrimp one balanced the shrimp and leek flavors well. ?The pork one was too "loose" as if the filling used excessively fatty (cheap) meat--I couldn't finish one dumpling. ?Both were a little overcooked and too salty. ?Not particulary impressed. Seafood Noodle Soup - The noodle texture was great and the soup was light and smooth. ?A little shy on ingredients, but helped to wash the dumplings down. Wings - Still not sure if I got the dried or the wet ones since some yelpers noted that the dry ones are still wet. ?Either way, they were just the right level of sweet, spicy, salty, crunchy and moistness. ? Really should be dubbed "Wing King" rather than "Dumpling King."

Not the very best in Chinese I've ever had, but for a first impression of San Fransisco for me, it was still very good. My friend told me their Chinese style wings were comparable to my favorite Korean-Chinese joint in Chicago so naturally I was curious. ?I tried to walk in with no expectations, but it was rather hard. The wait was reasonable, but the place is small and cramped. ?The staff was generally very nice to us, joked about our table too so it was good to have that interaction. ?They did forget about our potstickers and ended up not coming out until the end of our meal (defeated the purpose of appetizers). ?The servers were at least prompt and our food came out quickly. The dry wings were indeed very good but the portions were rather small. ?It also lacked a bit of depth. ?I recommend the cubes; portions were significantly larger than how many wings we got but the taste I thought came out better (then again, I also like breading). ?We ordered the dry version of the wings, but were able to use the sauce with our remaining white rice (which made it even more awesome). ?Our pork dish was delicious, the Jjajjangmyun wet noodles were very disappointing. ?It was watery and lacked flavor, although our friend told us we were supposed to order the dry version. ?Oh well. ?I'd recommend the potstickers if they come out on time. ?Enhance the flavor by adding the sauce from the wings! What was odd was the kimchi they served before the meal. ?I've never tried kimchi made with American cabbage and red pepper paste. ?It didn't taste very good, yet we couldn't stop eating it. Overall, the food is good. ?It certainly doesn't taste cheap and I have confidence that most of the food you might order will be far better than the cheap crap you might find in the rundown Chinese restaurants ?these days.

It's a 3.5 stars! Waiting time - 1 hour or more ? Chicken wings - delicious Mapo Tofu - good Twice cooked pork - good complimentary kimchi - not so great Suggestion: Order take out from here is much easier, and the food still tasted good after 20 min (Still hot) Will be back

How lucky! So I recently moved to the inner sunset. My bf and I never really ate much Chinese because in Santa Cruz there is no good Chinese. So we went here just to try.. I hadn't even read the yelp reviews.. LUCKY us we go here, the BEST chinese in SF! My bf got the DRY FRIED CHICKEN PIECES.... its a must... I repeat: DRY FRIED CHICKEN PIECES if you don't get this here.. its a fail. I love this place. Its always packed, beware. The first time we went, it was at 9:20pm and it closes at 9:30 I think and people were still standing outside! I hightly recommend! Enjoy! -JF

Must try the dry fried chicken wings... Wings are not spicy enough for me. However, they are crispy and have the right amount of garlic/soy sauce/sweet sauce to them. Don't love the 1 hour long wait on a Friday night. This place needs a face lift for more decor inside. Impossible to find close parking.

First off, I want to make sure you understand, I LOVE chicken. I actually feel bad for them because I don't think I've ever seen an old chicken...they don't get to grow old because they are so damn tasty. So I was lead here by a good friend who mentioned this was one of the best spots for fried chicken. We came on a Saturday around 3:00pm. Wasn't busy, but I can tell it would get packed during the rush hours. I highly suggest the dry fried chicken, it has a great mix of sweet and savory. Literally finger licking good. As for the other food, sadly I came just to snack, so I did not get to try anything else. I will be back.

Ive always gone to So(the original location), and when So closed, i was saddened. Between then and now, i knew that San Tung was run by the same family and wanted to make time to try but the opportunity never presented itself.Finally after So reopened did i find the time to try San Tung. Every item that ppl rave about is good... the wings the various noodles, dumplings, potstickers... fresh and tasty... My gripes are with parking, and the wait on busy nights(which is almost every night) and the price. After some consideration for me personally, because of where i work(SOMA/Potrero Hill) and price point, i would go to So instead. The popular dishes are almost the same... the wings, noodles, dumplings, potstickers... ive also never really had any issues with parking or waiting for a table in the evening(6pm-8pm). Worth trying but maybe restrict return visits to take-out?

I came here with my then girlfriend/now wife back in 2007. ?I was actually looking for a different restaurant of the same name and on the same street but about 20 blocks west. ?I remember that the other restaurant had a blue awning with white Chinese characters, "Shandong Little Restaurant", over its front door. I failed to find anything about this original Shandong restaurant on Irving on the web, so if anyone can tell me what happened to the place, I'd greatly appreciate it. ? This other place had the best Korean style potstickers ever. And, I don't even like potstickers that much. ?I am a steamed dumpling type of person. ?Yet, that potsticker was hands down the best dumpling type dish I've had. ?It was filled with both meat and seafood. ?And, it was oversized like typical Korean potsickers are. ?Their noodle dishes were very good too. But, anyways, back to the topic at hand. ? I really didn't enjoy my meal at San Tung. ?We did the obligatory 1hr wait for a table on a Saturday night. ?We ordered the JiaJian Mien, the potstickers and Ganpengi. ?The first two dishes were just so so. ?The third dish was ordered with a hair on the chicken. ?It was the curly kind, so I wander about its origins. ?We complained to the waiter, and he removed it with his hands. ?Well, we paid and left that dish untouched. ?No tip was left. At first, I thought maybe the first restaurant I was looking for simply moved to where the current San Tung restaurant is at now since it has the same name and has similar menu items. ?But, I now assume that this is not the case since the two restaurants' cooking styles are very different. I don't live in the Bay Area anymore. ?Every time I come back to visit, I really really miss the Shandong Xiao Guan with the blue awning that was about 20 blocks west of this reviewed establishment. ? What happened to it??

Not sure what else I can add. ?The 45 minute wait was worth the food! This is for sure some of the best chinese food I've ever had. The dry wings were soooo sweet, the spinach/garlic was not too salty and perfectly seasoned. I didn't love the black bean noodles. I found them to be too soupy but the other veggies (potatoes?) in the sauce, were a nice surprise. I can't wait to go back and try more.

I think we all know what I'm going to write about in this review. Dry Friend Chicken Wings. Oh yeah, it's definitely that good. What more can I say? the chicken wings are cooked to perfection with the right amount of sauce. The sauce is sweet and spicy, so it might not be you cup of tea if you can't handle the heat. Even though it's more mild than spicy. Ordered chicken fried rice and then some Dry Fried Shrimp. I was hoping to try the salty fish fried rice. Unfortunately, they do not serve them anymore. Dry Fried Shrimp is not as good as the chicken wings, but it does deserve some ordering if you're a big seafood fan. The service, could be a bit nicer. But I can care less when I'm eating my chicken wings and rice. Definitely need to try the Black Bean Sauce Noodle next time. Didn't get to have any last time around. Overall, if you come to this little spot in west frisco, try the dry fried chicken, you will not be disappointed.

The wait is crazy long and feels like you are at a cattle auction with everyone milling around by the door. However, your wait is rewarded with the first crispy bite into some fried chicken and you forget about the prior one and a half hours you waited. The jajangmyeon is also a must eat. If you don't want to wait you can call and order ahead and munch on some fried chicken wings in the comfort of your own home.

everything we ordered was ?very good, but i def recommend the house chicken wings! i think what makes it special is really the sauce. but besides that, their crunchy texture and juicy inside makes it the best chicken wings ive ever had. also recommend the follow (after scouting to see what other customers ordered): - black bean sauce noodles - stir-fried string beans (best vegetable dish i've had, def worth getting) - shrimp/leek dumplings wait is about 20-30 min on the weekends.

Crack chicken is what people call this place! I am from Sacramento, trying to hit up all the hot spots in SF and this was one of the spots i've been dying to try since last year. I finally got the chance to try it last weekend when i was in town. Lucky enough, when we first walked in, we got a table right away. They give kimchi has a starter for every table. Then, when it came to ordering, we got a really rude waitress who looked purely annoyed of all of the customers. We were a little indecisive, so she said "okay i take your order later" and rushed off to another table. We then ordered with another waiter who was a tad bit nicer, but still not cheery and in a rush as well. Food: Dry Chicken wings: Taking the first bite, hoping it will rock my socks off, made my world turn upside down in full disappointment. The chicken was wayyy too sweet and was not that great. The chicken alone tasted alright, i mean it was deep fried to perfection where the skin was crisp and the inside was moist, but the sauce was not great. I love chicken wings and this place really disappoint me because iit was suppose to be known as the best chicken ever.. Black Bean Stir-fried Noodle: Noodles stir-fried with black bean salt and onions and scallops. It was terrible. Probably overburnt and was really black. Only took a few bites and couldnt eat anymore. Quite salty. Coming from out of town, expecting this place to hit the spot was a disappointment. Not that great of service? Not a problem to me as long as the food is good. But Not that great of a service + not that great of food = no no. Dont think i will be coming back here. Stars: 2.5

I love this place. The people that I take here love this place. It's just amazing. I first went here because I heard they served my favorite Korean/Chinese dish. Then, another friend told me about their "dried fried chicken" being the best thing ever. And me loving chicken, I was excited to try it. Trust me, they are famous for this dish for a reason. It is absolutely genius & pure delicious. They are so good, my boyfriend went at least once a week to get some, which to me was a little bizarre. Service is very quick & yes, the waiters' accents can be thick so it may be hard to understand. Also, they can come off as rude, but my boyfriend & I came to discover that's just them & they are not rude at all. If you're not from here then you'll need to know this... The place is tiny & gets VERY crowded when it opens for lunch & also for dinner. The best time to go are between 2-5 on all days (they are closed on Wed). Yeah, it's not the best time to eat, but you will at least get to eat the food rather than wait for 45+ min. Yes, when they are REALLY busy, your minimum wait will be anything from 20 min to an hour! And it's not fun when it's raining or very cold to wait for a long time & you're hungry. Also, even though you may feel rushed, just take your time & take your time ordering.

I've been here once and the chicken wings are as AMAZING as everyone says! That alone would garner 5 stars. I'm only giving it 4 because the wait is terrible and parking is hella hard to find. You write your name and the # of people in your party on a dry erase board. My paranoia had me looking at the board every 5 minutes to see if someone's broad shoulders would rub against it. There was only the 2 of us but the wait was still about 20-30 minutes on a Saturday afternoon. Once seated, we got the wings, some green beans, and a black bean noodle dish. The wings were finger-lickin' DELICIOUS! The noodles were good but could have used an extra bit of something. The green beans were a good standard; can't really mess that up. They also give you some really HOT kimchi on the side, bonus! I didn't find the wait staff rude or unreasonable. They were plenty busy though; took the order, came out with food and that was that. I'd definitely come here again, if only to have those crack-tastic wings again! YUM!

Best dumplings ever! Imitators beware - you can't compete with San Tung unless you truly create your own dough and are generous with the filling. Of course, nothing more needs to be said about the noodles and dry fried chicken. There's a reason why people are willing to wait in a huge line in the cold foggy Sunset District. This place has awesome food.

My 2nd time visiting this place as I was somewhat impressed with their famous dried fried chicken wings, it was a disaster! ?After waiting 25 minutes, we were next on the list, but then the waiter waved in 3 groups of 5 and larger and would NOT acknowledge us of showing them we were next. ?It was pretty unbelievable how rude this waiters were, so won't be back. ?I have a recipe that's better than theirs if anyone is interested!

Decent food. I'm a vegetarian, so I can only say that my husband LOVED the chicken wings. I had Family Style tofu, veggie potstickers, and veggie chow mein. We arrived at around 8:45 on Saturday and only had a 10 minute wait. This was welcome news as we had spent well over 20 minutes looking for parking! The service was really good-- not super friendly, but incredibly attentive and efficient. The only item that was disappointing was the chow mein. It came out looking and tasting exactly like lo mein, which was still good, but just not what I was expecting. I have a feeling my husband will be dragging me out here again for the wings, and I certainly won't complain!

I love their string beans and fried rice, it's a perfect combo with the chicken wings! this isn't the type of place to come to if you're looking for service so don't expect hospitality. i honestly don't care about that because the food is just that good and they are quick. also, be prepared for long lines as there is always a wait during peak times!

First of all and most of all, their wings make up for everything negative I am about to post. Their sauce is so special it should be patented and marketed. But, then again if they do that no one would probably come to their restaurant anymore. Okay, your mission if you choose to accept it: Come to San Tung and ONLY eat their chicken wings. Their wings should be the only reason for you to come and nothing else. Yelp reviewers have recommended their dumplings but I can tell you this - their dumplings(I had the pork & leek)are anything but medicore. I've had better dumplings from the frozen food section. So, I can tell you this - it's not worth spending 4.50 on the dumplings. That being said, order the CHICKEN WINGS! Especially the ORIGINAL dry fried wings. They are the best. The wet ones are a little more juicer but not as great as the dry fried one. $6.50 for 10 wings is worth every penny. ?It is THAT good. Okay, let's work on the negatives. The customer service is inadequate but then again you do not come here for their friendliness. You come here to eat their wings. As you sit at your table, you will notice the employees trudging their feet along their floor with sad drooping faces that pretty much sums up - I don't want to work here. But honestly, I don't blame thing - it's literally busy all day long here! I came at 11:15am (they open at 11am) and it was already packed; I came one time at 6pm, and we waited for a hour before we sat(table of four) The seating environment is the traditional Chinese restaurant type. Nothing special or spectacular. Seats are wooden and hard but YOU ARE HERE FOR THE CHICKEN WINGS heh. Once it gets crowded, you will most likely have to share tables, and it gets crowded. Large bathroom, and surprisingly - clean. (One toilet, one sink) Let's move on to the other negatives - literally, every other food San Tung offers is tasteless or mediocre. Now, I can't be the judge for every single food because I haven't tried them all. But here is the list of some foods to avoid: 1)Black bean noodle 2)Sweet & Sour Pork 3) Mongolian Pork 4) All Dumplings There is an exception: I ordered the Peanut Noodle and wow, the sauce is blended with the noodle perfectly. I recommend it. Parking is limited during the extremely crazy hours. I highly recommend to go early when they open. Oddly, they are closed on Wednesdays but this place is the place for Chicken Wings of the Bay Area.

When someone told me that there was a Chinese restaurant that served incredible hot wings, I automatically envisioned an Asian Hooters. ?But unlike the famed franchise, people actually did come here for the wings. ?They were deep fried and mixed with a sweet/savory sauce with a little kick. The other dishes were pretty good such as the pork dumplings which had a really good homemade dough around it. ?The noodles dressed with peanut sauce were also surprisingly good and not over-powering. ?But above all, you have to get the wings.

great chinese food - better than anything you'll find in chinatown. ?Only con is that it's a bit of a drive for those of us who a) live downtown b) live outside of SF. they're known for their * chicken wings and bits * dumplings I also order the sizzling rice soup, the mu shu pork, and some sort of veggie dish - even potstickers on occasion the two of us will usually order like 5 dishes and the first couple of times the waiters were like - "you two skinny people are going to eat all of that?" ?i just said - yep, we eat a lot :) ... and then we'd barely make a dent and take the rest home.

After that time, I've been introducing everyone to this place and they all loved it. It price isn't too expensive and you get a lot of food. Their combination fried rice is very good too.

What I love about this place is its lack of pretense: ?you, the customer, are there to eat food, pay for food, and leave. ?The servers are there to take your order and transport the food to your table. ?No small talk, no smiles, no joking around- it's kinda refreshing. ?You'd better have an idea of what you'd like to order before you sit down, b/c if you ask for a "couple more minutes" when the guy w/the pad comes around, who knows when you'll get another chance to put in your order. ?I also like the food itself for being pretty close to home-cooked style, as opposed to restaurant style, which means it may not look pretty, but it's filling and comforting. Lunch rush can start as early as 11:30 on a weekday. ?Parking is typically madness in that area.

The last thing this place needs is another review about their dried chicken wings. ?(Mixed reviews on, by the way. ?My friend absolutely loved it, but I didn't find them spectacular. ?Perhaps that's because I could feel my arteries clogging up as I was eating them.) The shrimp and leek dumplings were mediocre as well, and the dried string beans (which I usually love) just weren't quite up to par. The plus? ?There's no line when you go at 5:30 or 6 pm, even on a Friday. The minus? For semi-pricey Chinese food, it just wasn't that great. And I should know. ?I'm Chinese, and I'm from LA. ?(The land of amazing, cheap Chinese food. ?Outside of China, of course.)

We went here becoz of the good reviews at yelp. ?First visit was not too bad, we got our seat right away and ordered the wings, seafood noodle soup and black bean noodle. ?The wing was pretty good, seafood noodle soup..ah...not good..very dissapointed and black bean noodle, just ok. ?We decided to come back becoz my hubby likes their chicken wings. ?This time we ordered wings, beef noodle soup and black bean noodle. ?Wings still good as usual, beef noodle...na,...regret ordering it and black bean...just ok..plus we ordered dumpling..just so..so. Another visit, we waited for a while and finally were seated with another family...arrrhhh..very uncomfortable...my hubby was not HAPPY at all...Unfortunately the table sharing is not working out...food was delivered to wrong customer...arrrhh...i really wish they can treat customer a little bit better....

Wow, like reviewer #958 or #93t613261 whatever, there's almost no point in reviewing this restaurant but since it's 3:03 a.m. and I'm bored but almost about to pass out, I had a temporary craving for their dry braised string beans which inadvertently led me to the review page for this wondrous restaurant. As everyone has said, the dry fried chicken is probably the most famous item they serve. I preferably enjoy the diced version and a friend of mine and I agreed that you get more chicken this way. Favorites: Dry Fried Chicken (diced) Braised String Beans Steamed Potstickers Cherry Pork Disclaimer: If you order anything else than the above, you may not agree to the five star rating. Surprisingly, I have seen individuals show up and not get the dry fried chicken which is blasphemy or chickensphemy whatever you want to call it, it's just plain wrong!

'Nuff said about the Dried Fried Chicken Wings and Dumplings. . . ?yes, there's a lot of pork here as well. ?There's always a wait, but if you have a day off or time for lunch, the suggestion is to come here when it's a bit (just a bit!) quieter. ?If not, get there early for dinner! ?It's always worth the wait. Other good dishes are the Garlicky Eggplant, Pickled Cabbage and Pork Soup Noodles, and Dan Dan Mein (spicy peanut sauce noodles with seafood). Oh, and don't dream of this place on Wednesdays - they're closed.

Great!! ?The number 7 is my favorite. ?The Dry Black Bean Noodle with Sea Food. It's great and has an unusual taste to it. ?I would give this joint a 5 but most of the foods I enjoy here are fried and greasy (which I'm not usually a fan of). Other great eats! ?The Dried fried chicken wings, the deeply fried pot stickers, the grean beans, the walnut shrimp, and the beef tripe. ? For those looking for Americanized Chinese food (ie. Sweet and sour pork, fried rice, beef broccoli, Mu shu, etc...this is NOT the place for you. ?When it's busy, it's chaotic, people running around everywhere, etc.) ?If you are looking for that type of Chinese food, then go to Dragon Well(Marina), R&G Lounge(China Town), or House of Nanking (North Beach).

I would have given this place 5 stars, but it's too crowded and definitely no elbow room. ?You're better off getting the food to go. The place gets really crowded for dinner. ?I mean, there's a line out the door... If you're planning to go, I'd suggest an early dinner - some time around 4:00pm. ?Anytime after that, expect a wait. Now for the food. ?Everything they've said about the dry fried chicken wings is TRUE. ?If you love sweet and flavorful, this will definitely hit the spot. ?We LOVED it and wished we had ordered some to go... I'd also suggest the vegetable chow mein, the green beans or spinach with garlic. ?Very yummy and kid friendly. ?The kids enjoyed their meals and expressed how much they enjoyed eating there... But like I said, there's no elbow room. ?So if you're claustrophobic or don't like eating next to strangers take your order to go!

This place is famous for their chicken wings. They're sweet, spicy, crunchy and perfect. ?They do have other dishes that are good as well, but the chicken wings are definitely worth checking this place out for. ?Its usually busy for dinner. ?

How on earth can each highly reviewed restaurant on yelp be better than the last? But here we go...yes, San Tung is yummy. Vegetarian pot stickers....wow. Best we've ever tasted. Gotta take a spin in the two vinegar sauce! Chicken wings...out of control. Caused my BF to say this is his new favorite Chinese restaurant. Vegetables in garlic sauce...wow again. Great hit of ginger to balance the garlic. So we'll be bringing our friends and famiy here. BTW, parking is plentiful and there's no wait at 4pm. No wait, I shouldn't have said that. Ummm errr!

I've been here a few times but never with my husband. I've been raving about the dry fried chicken and finally he agreed to go today! As soon as he got home from work, we took off. ?We got there around 630ish and found parking few blocks away. ?We got a table right before the rush. What we ordered: Pork dumpling, dry fried chicken, and tried the black bean noodles everyone was raving about on yelp. ? The noodles were interesting, tastes better than it sounds. It was drenched with black bean sauce but you don't have to eat all the sauce. I took out some of the sauce and enjoyed it better. ?Next time I have to try the string beans as so many other ppl ordered it. The only thing I have to comment about is that they charged me an extra serving for STEAM RICE for my daughter who is only 1 year old. ?Wow, it is getting expensive eating out with my new one I was telling my husband. ? I just had to ask the server if they really charged us for her and I guess one of the owner guys came up and he removed that 1 serving of rice of the receipt. ? I just wanted to know for sure that was what it was... I wasn't complaining, we were up and ready to leave... Now that I"m home, come to think of it...It was a small container of rice that was enough for 2 and if they were to charge us for 3 servings of rice! ARgh! ?A-OK. I"m almost a fan but will come back anyways for the dry fried chicken. ? When we left around 730 there were at least 15ppl waiting outside. I recommend going early!

hmm. what is all the hype about? San Tung's line is out the door each time I pass by. Yelpers, can you help me understand? The noodles with black bean sauce that everyone raves about lacks flavor and quality. It tasted like it was cooked in bulk, without much consideration about the ingredients or taste. I've had better at other chinese and korean restaurants. The dry chicken was good. It definitely excited my taste buds, and I would recommend it to visitors. However, I've also had similar taste- bud- stimulating dishes elsewhere made with quality, tender chicken breast! The pork and leek dumplings: the dumpling wrapper had a very good texture. There is no doubt that they make and wrap their dumplings well. However, the dumplings lacked flavor, and you have to guess at the quality of the ingredients. I was disappointed. I tried a few other dishes- green beans, two noodle soup dishes, cold sliced beef dish... There isn't much for me to say. Everything but the chicken wings lacked flavor, and nothing really met my standards for quality food. San tung doesn't offer a very great experience either-- you can expect to be packed tightly in the small restaurant, receive below average service, tap water tasting ice water, a dirty restroom, and no music. Time to move on.

This is my favorite Chinese food restaurant and it's worth the wait. The best time to go to avoid the crowds and hour long waits is around 5:30 for an early dinner or 8:30-8:45pm when it's almost closing time. I always go there with a group of friends and order the usual dishes. 1. Shrimp and Leek Dumplings 2. Mu Shu Pork 3. Dry Fried Chicken 4. Dry Fried Flounder 5. Garlic Spinach I just tried the Vegetable Chow Mein the other night and that was pretty tasty too. You can really over eat at this place so come with an empty stomache.

Order the Dry Original Chickens wings or else you've wasted your time. ?Be sure to order two plates. The pig ears were good, but they could have been a bit more crunchy. The beef that had batter on it, forgot the name because it wasn't good, was missing something. ?I couldn't place my finger on it. The noodles were ok. ?A very subtle flavor as the noodles are not cooked with the sauce. ?The sauce is placed only on top. It is always busy here so be sure to put your name on the board and make sure everyone is there. The service isn't friendly but they can be efficient. My foodie friends from LA have told me I have to try the Korean Chicken wings down there. ?I'll let you know.

A popular Inner Sunset joint that serves family style Northern Chinese fare that draws a range of dinners from immigrant families, SF yuppies, and college students.

Had lunch here today for my roommate's birthday. Dry fried chicken wings still taste the same. I dunno but I'm starting not to get the hang of it anymore. Still great but I feel that there's too much sugar in the sauce. Maybe my palate is probably changing, leaning towards into simpler, more subtle tastes now. As always, kimchi is still bad.

All you have to really do is get the fried chicken wings. Some of the best chicken wings can be found right here and I have no complaints. Try to go early or during off-peak times, this place gets crowded. The only odd thing I noticed was when they empty a boatload of green beans onto a dining table and sort though them. In any case, go for the chicken!

Awesome Chinese food that's a bit unique to the area, as I have not found anywhere that serves anything similar with the quality of this place. Everyone loves the chicken wings but I also think they make the best potstickers(which have some substance to them, taste and look freshly made, and don't look or taste like they came from Costco, like most Japanese places have with their Gyoza). Recommend those two, the mushu pork, the 5 Spice Noodle Soup, and the Noodles with Peanut Sauce. I don't like everything on their menu but most things I've tried are at least decent...most turn out pretty good. Service is usually pretty good, which, considering how busy this place gets during dinner hours, is pretty nice. If you come for dinner, get there really early, especially on weekends, probably around 4-5PM, because the wait can be absurd and there is not much room to stand/sit inside, which can mean standing in the cold for around an hour or more. The alternative if you don't mind a late dinner, is to get there around 8PM, when most people are about done and few others come around that time. The few times I've been there for lunch, it's usually pretty clear with open tables all around...I waited for a lunch table just once and that only took 15 minutes.

Man, I don't even know there is always a line here. Everyone are saying the chicken wings are hella good, but it's only average. It's nothing special, not worth the hour+ waiting. I would be pretty pissed if I had to line up for a meal here. Tried the pork dumplings, sizzling rice soup, black bean sauce noodles, and the dried fried chicken. Everything is only average, comparable to most other restaurants out there. I did like the kimchi they give you when you sit down. I think it's on the house, not 100% sure though. The place is decent looking, not dirty or smelly. Service was nothing special. Sit at table and they serve some tea. You order, eat and get out. I would come back if someone wanted to come, but I won't be coming if I need to line up.

My family has now moved to to the otherside of the bay bridge, but whenever we go to the city we ALWAYS come back here for a visit! They give you kimchee, AWESOME! The onwers always pack a take out box for me of JUST their kimchee...I love it! The pork dumplings, pot stickers, the chicken wings (wet not dry!), my mouth is watering just thinking about it...yummmmmm Always crowrded during dinner and lunch rush, sometimes you have to share a large table with another crowd, but you'll forget it once the food comes!!

Every time I walked past this place at night, it was always packed and sometimes out the door with people. A friend and I came here last month to check out what the food hype was here which made it so popular. It looked like a typical Chinese eatery to me until we sat down and looked at the menu. The menu came with a good description in English and in Chinese. Plus it came with pictures! I'm a visual person and I like to see pretty pictures. Then again we were also observing what other patrons had ordered. Other than a Chinese cuisine style restaurant, most of the items on the menu are northern style. Most of the Chinese restaurants around the SF Bay Area are southern style and come in large portions. This place also gave us large portions, but the service was excellent. I didn't have to constantly ask them to refill my tea pot, they checked the pot every 10 minutes to see if it was half full. Maybe they knew I was coming haha. Onward to the food... While we looked at the pretty menu, my friend and I were served tea, pickled vegetables and roasted peanuts. I don't know many places which give you this kind of service! Anyways, we ordered the dry fried chicken wings which was delicately infused with spices and marinated in a tangy sauce. We were kinda wondering what the Szechuan Tea Smoked Duck would taste like, so we ordered that too. It was a pricey $12 but it was well worth what we ordered. As for veggies, we went with our favorite Eggplant sauteed in a garlic sauce and Chinese mustard greens, plus rice of course. You can't go wrong with ordering mustard greens. There's not many Chinese eateries that I know of which serve tea infused or dry fried meats. I guess these two items really stood out for me on the menu. If you would like to come and eat at San Tung's, I highly recommend coming here at the ass crack of dawn and.. I'm just kidding. It's better to come here early for dinner or lunch since this place fills up fast. Parking is a bit hard to find around here, but I suggest parking 5-6 blocks away and walking to the restaurant. Therefore if you are feeling a bit bloated, you can walk it off as well.

I visited this place on a Saturday evening and it was PACKED. ?The wait was a little bit over an hour, but a friend had recommended this place and it sounded awesome. We had the Dried Fried Chicken Wing, the Pan Fried String Beans, Zajiang Mein, and Steamed Shrimp and Chive Dumplings. ?I'll review these in order of what I liked least to most: Zajiang Mein: ?The noodle itself was pretty good, but I wasn't impressed by the sauce - it didn't have enough flavor. Pan Fried String Beans: ?Usually I don't order vegetable dishes at restaurants but everyone had this on their table so we had to order it. ?The flavor was good but the string beans were overcooked. ?They didn't have enough crunch. Steamed Shrimp and Chive Dumplings: ?These were awesome. ?I would give them 4 stars! ?The ingredients were fresh and the flavor was ?great. ?I would get these again. Dried Fried Chicken Wings: ?5 stars! ?These are amazing! ?My friend was absolutely right. ?The wings were just crispy enough and the sauce was great! ?Sweet but not overpowering. ?You HAVE to get these at San Tung.

So I'm giving San Tung's five stars, for two reasons. One the food was dank, and two the entertainment it provided me and my friend with. I will explain, but first..the food! So I came here with a friend because she had told me about their dry friend chicken wings, and I'm all about wings so I was all for it. We ordered hot and sour soup, the wings, white rice and chicken and broccoli ( don't judge us, we had skipped lunch and we were hungry!). The wings lived up the the hype..SOOO good! the hot and sour soup was also on point. Everything really was great, and there was enough left over for both of us, and the prices are reasonable. All that food for 30 bucks. Food always taste better when its also cheap! Now for the entertainment, so we're chowing down on the wings, when all of a sudden one of the waiters and a customer starting getting into it! the customer was heated, i couldn't tell what they were arguing about. But it got intense, a lot of yelling and at one point they "took it outside". Where they almost fought, but didn't. But still quite entertaining, who doesn't like to watch fights? don't lie! so yes, go for the food! and if you're lucky enough, you'll get a show too.

I was pleasantly surprised at how packed it was and was eager to see what the hype was all about.

I found this place through word of mouth then decided to check it out with my friend. This place is amazing. The food didn't take too long to prepare and it was hot and delicious. I had shrimp fried rice and the dry chicken wings. The rice was great and the chicken wings are as good as everybody says. I have 2 complaints about this place, however. 1. This place is packed come dinnertime, I arrived around 6:30 and we didn't get a seat until 6:45. 2. My friend doesn't use chopsticks and felt it shouldn't be necessary to request a fork. I will definitely eat here again!

Simply put, this is the best Chinese food I've had outside of China! The food is authentic, tasty, and doesn't leave your stomach feeling gross after wards. I've been here only twice (in the summer and fall of 2010) but tried the dumplings (go steamed over fried), Kung Pao Chicken, and Mongolian Beef - all were excellent (especially the Mongolian Beef). The two times I've been there, on late Saturday and Sunday afternoons, it was packed but we didn't have to wait too long (maybe 15-20 mins tops?) for a table (party of 2 and 3). To top it all off, prices were very reasonable (about $9 for an entree). Service wasn't bad either. I will go to this place for a delicious meal any time I am in the Bay Area, and if you like good Chinese food, you should too!

I was absolutely in love after taking a bite of their dry fried chicken wings. Although, I've never tried anything else from there, I am giving this 5 star rating solely for their wings. It's ridiculously amazing how crispy their wings are even after being drenched and soaked in their godly wing sauce. If I lived in the city, this would be my go to spot for whenever I'm craving wings.

I really have a problem with the syrupy sauces and heaviness that befalls some Chinese restaurants, so I really can't love San Tung. The garlic chicken wings do not escape this mistake and I almost find them inedible, the corn syrup sludge that they are. The pot stickers are huge and thick-skinned. And there is this strange dish of prawns coated in honey and mayonnaise, probably the strangest thing for someone to concoct, and I just don't think it works. The won ton soup is flat, and slightly greasy.

I've heard such good things about their dry chicken wings therefore I had to make a stop here. Chicken was good, just good. I honestly don't know what the hype is about. Honestly, I've had better wings at Korean Chicken places (99 chicken, bon jon chicken, etc etc). Dry chicken wings taste identical to soy sauce chicken from 99 chicken. If you are in San Jose area, I would suggest you try Korean fried chicken places first before taking your trip to the city. However, I did came across a dish I enjoyed very much at San Tung-Cherry Pork. I've had it when I was little so I knew exactly what it was and what to expect. It's basically a sweet and sour pork with slight flavors of tomato. The flavor is rather authentic. As a matter of fact, it's the closest thing to Cherry Pork I had in China. If you're into the sweet and sour asian taste, I highly suggest you try the Cherry Pork here!

Oh man, best chinese food I've had in a looooooong time. The chicken is flipping amazing and the green beans were of the chain! Wait was about 15minutes but well worth it! Waiters are nice and service was pretty decent. I will come here over and over, and it doesn't help i live 300ft away =P tip: walk in, turn right and on the wall next to the door is a board, write your name on it and the waiters will cross names as tables become available.

This place was originally introduced to me as the "crack chicken" place, and that's about the most accurate description I can give to the Dry Fried Chicken Wings.

My sister, who loves food, read good reviews from Yelpers about this restaurant. ?We came on a Tuesday afternoon thinking we could walk right ?in. ?Nope, waited 30+ minutes, but it was worth it! The chicken wings that everyone raved about were indeed crispy, garlicky, sweet, but could use a touch more heat. ?Another excellent dish was the sauteed green beans. ?They are crunchy and fresh! ?Their noodles were al dente, just the way I liked it! ?The shrimp and leek dumplings were good. ?The only dish that failed our expectation was the vegetarian potstickers. ?I wouldn't order that dish again. It's been days since I ate at San Tung, and I am still daydreaming about those crispy wings and crunchy green beans!

Theres not much to say about San Tung that hasnt already been written. I will say that I lived next door to that place for 2yrs and there is ALWAYS a line. Though that didnt stop us from eating there once a week. The wife and I would order food to go and even that could take 30/45min on a busy night. The realest thing at San Tung: Frank. The owners son makes San Tung... well, San Tung to me. If he's not bringing over free beers or sake then he's running around table to table talking up the customers and bringing out their wonderful food. Parking is TERRIBLE... Though if its really bad drive down to Funston/Irving and park in the Andronicos parking lot. There were times we had to park there overnight when we couldnt get a spot on the street.

YUM! Dry Fried Chicken and Dry Fried Shrimp - These are what this place is known for and for good reason. ?If you like the combination of sweet, salt, and spicy...you have to indulge yourself with a serving of the chicken or shrimp. ?My other favorite is their dumplings and steamed pot stickers. ?This is the only place I've been to that doesn't have that super thick overly doughy wrap that takes over the flavor of the meat on the inside. ?Their dumplings are steamed to perfection. ? The only thing that is really annoying about this place is that it is constantly busy, the wait is long, and it's very loud. ?BUT...since I LOVE the food so much, I'm willing to endure the rest. ?My only suggestion to avoid this is to come early, before "peak" meal times. ? It's the perfect place for the whole family, especially when you have loud obnoxious members (mom) who have no censoring to what they say :o)!

First and foremost, my 5 might be your 1. ?CAUTION: ?Noise level can be really loud. ?Emergency Park to sign in on the white board to the right of the entrance before parking. If you're not used to circling around the block a few times searching for parking, you'll start off on a wrong foot. ?It's a City thing, I'm used to it. It's loud and the crowd is usually younger, expect with a few exceptions of families. ?It's a great before hitting the clubs or lounge / bar. I brought my mom here. ?She really liked the Cold Dish, sliced beef somthing or other. ?And the Black Bean Noodles...That's really Asian. Chicken wings are cool as well as Dry Fish.

I always drive by this place and it's always pack So I suggested this place for my friends birthday Ordered the original Chicken which was pretty good... the Shrimp Leek dumpling was just ok but it didn't look like they had any shrimp in them.. had the string bean which was ok... the other dishes we ordered were terrible... we order the pork noodle dish.. it tasted like they threw a whole bunch of salt.... I went back a couple of nights ago for more original chicken and was I disappointed...... The chicken wing was covered with their famous sauce but it was very grainy.. like a they just threw a bunch of brown sugar on top.... I decided to try something different from before so I ordered a chow mein which was over powered with the flavor of alcohol... or wine.. something of the sort. also ordered a noodle soup which a saw a lot of people ordering.. they were drinking the soup so I ordered it.... BIG MISTAKE......... you can not drink the soup cause it was full of salt and MSG.... After waiting for so long about 30 minutes for a table.. it sure was not worth the wait..... I forgot to mention..... it's over priced and the service was terrible...... They were rude.. and when it came to pay the bill.. that was the fastest service ever......

I never get tired of this place. I love their chicken wings and dumplings. Even with their long lines and bad parking, these two dishes are worth the trip. ? I also like their string beans and eggplant too. ?I have still yet a dish that I haven't liked on their menu. They need to open up another restaurant to fit the crowds of people that usually pack this place. ?Best time to go is late afternoon or late in the evening. ?If you go during regular dinner time, be prepared to wait.

The only place I go to eat good Chinese food. I always order the Dry fried chicken, dry fry string beans, pot stickers or shrimp & leek dumplings. I have been known to wait almost an hr to eat here, so that says alot about how much I enjoy the food. I try to avoid the crowds by either eating here for lunch or getting take out. I have also turned friends and co-workers on to this place.

San Tung. ?This is the Chinese spot in SF. ? The wings and shrimp leek dumplings are so slamming that I invited them to my birthday party. ?I wanted to keep things simple, so we just put in a huge order and had friends over. ?Of course the food tastes best hot out of the kitchen, but I couldn't possibly say anything bad about eating San Tung with good company. ?It's the little things that yield the biggest smiles! I recommend the dry fried chicken wings. ?The wet ones are good, but when you have the dry ones as an option, it almost feels like a waste of tummy space to eat the wet ones. ?Shrimp leek dumplings are awesome (sorry kingdom of dumpling- but they blow yours out of the water). ?Also good are the seafood black bean noodles and string beans if you need some vegetables in your life and the complimentary kimchi isn't sufficient. The wait staff is cool enough- I don't need a foot or ego massage for $15 a head. ?A smile is plenty.

I've heard about this restaurant for quite some time now, and I never had a chance to try it until a couple weeks ago. It looks like your typical Chinese restaurant in the SF Richmond area, but the food is absolutely amazing. I don't know...I've always liked nontraditional Chinese food such as mushu pork/chicken, sweet and sour this and that, and fried stuff....so San Tung was perfect for me! Everyone told me the dried chicken was good, and they were absolutely right! I don't usually like chicken wings and little drums, but I ate it and was completely satisfied! The boneless ones were just as good...but maybe not as flavorful compared to the larger ones. But if you're lazy, boneless ones will do just fine! Food was overall great! Service wasn't bad either...you can't expect that much from a Chinese restaurant. I was surprised that even on a Sunday night, despite the spiraling downward economy, people are still waiting in line for long periods of time to eat at San Tung. Other memorable dishes: black bean noodles, honey walnut prawns, string beans. The dumplings were okay too! ?I'll definitely be back! Prices are also very reasonable and affordable.

The food was decent, but I found the sodium content or msg to be rather high, as I was extremely thirsty after dinner. The chicken wings were tasty, the parking was horrible. ? The service leaves much to be desired. Although the restaurant was busy, it is still no excuse for poor service. We asked for a second helping of rice, but the waiter said they were out of rice??? Then the waiter came and collected our bowl, went to another table which had just vacated, and placed their old rice into our bowl. I kid you not! When he returned to our table we just looked at him with disgust. At that point we decided to leave and never return to this restaurant again. How unsanitary! If actions like this occur in the dining area, I would shudder to think what of what goes on within the kitchen. I would rather eat at the House of Nan King if given the choice.

We have eaten here in the past and I found the food to be good, a little skimpy, and pricey for what you got. ?Today was no exception. ?Our youngest daughter was visiting from the Miami area so our party of 4 ate lunch here this past Monday. ?Get got there about noon and it was already crowded. ?By the time we left, there were crowds of people waiting outside. ?Somehow, I don't see why this place is so popular. ?Maybe it is a place to be seen! We started off with some sizzling rice soup. It was a disappointment, nothing like the sizzling rice soup we had at Kam's and other lesser Chinese restaurant. It was mostly broth with some canned mushrooms along with the rice poured on top to make it sizzle. ?Rice is not that expensive so I don't know why they scrimp on it. ?We also ordered some chicken chow mein. ?It was mostly noodles and again the volume wasn't much considering what they charge. ?Additionally we had their fried chicken wings (very good), green beans (very good), and pot stickers (good, but a little too doughy). The restaurant is clean and the service is average. ?I would come here again, but it is certainly not my everyday style comfort food. ? We spent $53 (not including tip) for 4 which is pricey for Chinese food.

Holy crap this place is good!!! A friend & I happened upon this place by accident while trolling the inner sunset for some good grub. ?It was crazy... the place was packed with a big line out the door, while the Chinese restaurant directly across the street was a ghost town. ?We were both so happy we hopped in line at San Tung! The rage here is the dry fried chicken wings. ?I'm not much for picking things off the bone, so we opted for the chopped option. ?This stuff is evil in the very best way! ?It's so crispy it seems to pop in your mouth and the honey infused coating of sauce is amazing! ?It's like molten lava though, so you might want to give it a cooling off period before shoveling it in. I'd also recommend the shrimp and leek steamed dumplings as a starter. ?No sauce needed for these savory little pockets of happy. ?Between the hot & sour or wonton soups, I'd opt for the hot & sour... though both are good. ?The h&s had these big fresh green peas that were super yummy. This place is worth the wait in line & totally worth trekking to the foggy sunset.

This place is so F**ing good! I've been to A LOT of Chinese restaurants. This one is my absolute favorite. I HAVE to order when I come here: The Dry Fried Chicken Chunks. That's the HEART of my reason for coming to this place. Some people prefer the wing form, i like it in chunk form. Its not dry, its just right. They have some sort of special sauce that I hear they put on a large majority of the food. Whatever their secret sauce is (packed with MSG im sure) it is effing delicious and I'm a health fan but I just LET GO of all my inhibitions when I eat here. God its worth it. I also enjoy the egg dipped in light garlic soy sauce, thick vegetable or pork pot stickers, the peanut noodles, the beef chowmein and the dry fried fish which is basically a fish version of the dry fried chicken chunks. Almost everything I've had at this restaurant has been fantastic. Its a popular place, there is always a big line to get in regardless of what night of the week it is. I recommend ordering sake and tea with your meal. it makes for a terrific evening. I know by experience. :)).

Last night was the second time that I have been to San Tung and the second Sunday in a row that I have eaten at San Tung. ?The place closes at 9:30 pm and be sure to note that when you walk in that door at 9:15 pm, there is still a line of people waiting to be seated! On a Sunday! I haven't eaten the much yelped about chicken wings but have had the chance to try some other gems. The shrimp and leak dumplings and veggie potstickers are delicious. Each are equally fresh and have a good home made feel to them. The dried black bean and seafood noodles were delicious. The cruncy and fresh cucumber atop the noodles paired well with the hot and mushy black bean sauce. The sizzling rice and shrimp soup is a nice light and clean soup. Its a good go to soup when you want something that is not too heavy but flavorful. ? This place definitely does not dissapoint.

This place has definitely the best chicken wings EVER!!! On the menu, its called original dry fried chicken wings. Once you try them you will want to come back for more. The wings just have a perfect mixture of sweetness and saltiness. Their chicken fried rice and string beans are pretty good also. I normally don't eat too much veggies, but their string beans comes with this salty meat in there which give it a perfect salty veggie taste. Once you come to eat here, you will come back all the time!! The only bad thing about this place is the wait. If you come around dinner time, brace yourself for about an 1 hour wait. Sometimes they will split you and another party in a big table, but they will ask you first. So if you don't want to be split, you'll have to wait for another single table to be opened before you get your seats.

We've been going to San Tung for many years and we love it. Our favourites are the dry fried beef, ?pot stickers, green beans and the dry fried chicken wings. The restaurant is most often busy so it can be a bit loud but our family feels like that's just part of the fun, no romance to be found here. A great stop if you're visiting SF.

Even though I always get take out this is my favorite chinese food in SF. Going to this place makes me feel like I'm back in Hong Kong. It is always packed with people and waitstaff bringing yet more delicious looking food to the crowds. Food is great but they really aren't trying for any kind of nice ambiance. This is a place for people that want really good food at cheap prices and aren't worried about the lighting. My advice is to get take out rather than eat there unless you like a side of chaos with your dinner. The dry fried chicken wings really are exceptional. I like to get the diced version though too as it saves me about 20 napkins as get the sauce all over me picking up the wings.

San Tung is quite possibly one of our all time favorite restaurants in SF. We were recommended to it by an Asian who told us just what to order. We did, and we've been a fan ever since. As everyone as said, the dry fried chicken wings are the best thing in the world - making my mouth water even as I sit here. I love them. Pot stickers are amazing, as a dumplings, hot & sour soup, etc. Only downside is how busy the restaurant gets, and just about every night! ?If you don't get there before 5:30 p.m., you will have to wait for quite some time. Which can be a be problematic. Otherwise, awesome!

Dried fried chicken wings. DELICIOUS. In fact, everything that San Tung offers is delicious. The wait is always worth it and even though it seems crowded they move people in and out pretty fast. There is a dry erase board inside and you just write your name then wait around with everyone else to get a table. My friend and I went and got 2 orders of dried fried chicken, peking duck, and shrimp fried rice. Even though I was super full, I never ran out of room for those legendary wings. Always worth it. They are spicy, sweet, crunchy, and tender all in one bite. Making my mouth water just thinking about it. Probably the only review that I fully support with 5 stars.

Order the dry fried chicken wings with rice on the side! You will not be disappointed by the portion size or the quality! Just be careful though because it can get sticky. Ordered here recently with my boyfriend and got confused about wet vs. dry. The dried chicken wings do have sauce on them, making the "dry"-ness of the dish misleading. We ordered over the phone, went and picked it up, and they had it ready and waiting for us on time! Never disappointed by San Tung, but I recommend not ordering from here too often because I liked considering this place a "treat" :)

San tung - It's no King of Noodles Why all the hype folks? First off the chicken wings...I will admit they are pretty good, but what isn't when it's deep fried? ?I'm pretty sure I'd eat my shoe laces if they were deep fried and rolled in honey. ?That said, I did wait in line for 1.5 hours in order to pick up a large order for a super bowl party. ?Tipping the scale from a 2 star to 3 star rating. But what about the rest of the menu? ?Answer; Average. Average Mongolian beef, average fried rice, average kim chi (I wouldn't eat it, but others said average), ?beef with black mushrooms, beef with been curd, dumplings, sea food noodles...all average. ? Let me remind you, I'm not saying any of it was actually bad. ?It was all just average. ?There are much better dumplings at Yu Lee on Hyde or and I love Tai Chi's fried rice... ?Maybe it's because I'm a gwailo...but I have been to San Tung with some legit asian conessieurs and none of them understood all the hype. ?Again, it wasn't bad, but not 4-5 stars either. If you don't want to deal with the long wait for a seat and love a great bowl of pho (pronounced pha - who's the gwailo now!), then hit up Yummi Yummi. ?It is legit. ?I just tried the spicy beef and pork pho and it was damn tasty. ?Also, King of Noodles on Irving between 17th and 18th is still King! ?God I love that place.

THE best, excellent, Northern Chinese/Korean cuisine in my life!!! My family, friends and I have been going to San Tung for over 10 years. From the time it was in Outer Sunset to Inner Sunset, right by the corner of the street that I used to live!! Now that I reside in LA, I can no longer enjoy their dishes anytime I want; I can only go there when I have the time to visit SF. Anyways, here are the recommended dishes: Shrimp & Leek Dumplings (tender, juicy, and just right) Pork dumplings (again, just right) JaJiangMyun (tasty sauce over right-textured noodles) San Tung Spicy Sauce Noodles (spicy-diced!!!! and the best) Dry Fried Chicken (crispy and spicy and tasty!!!) Pork and Preserved Veggie Noodle Soup ( another must) Well, I hope that sums it all! The food there is so good that the people and the service are the second most important. I highly recommend this restaurant for locals and visitors to SF!

Hands-down, the worst service I've ever experienced. Including the wait, my friend and I were here for over three hours. And I never got my food! First they brought out my friend's dish, twenty minutes later we got our "appetizer", followed by my rice. Fourty-five minutes after that we decided to give up on my dinner and we flagged down another waiter to ask for the check. At least they were quick about bringing that. I'm guessing by the number of five-star reviews that this was a fluke. But still, I can't believe that a halfway decent restaurant would treat customers like this. Thoroughly disappointing.

Overall, experience and food was 2 stars. Chicken wings were 3.5 stars Everything else was really disappointing. I'm Chinese, and I wouldn't take my parents here - they would hate it. ?I grew up on Cantonese food. Granted, San Tung is not Cantonese, but I've had my fair share of Szechuan, Hunan, Shanghainese, and Taiwanese foods. ?I lived in Shanghai for a few months and had sampled the best of all regional foods their restaurants had to offer. This place confounds me. Especially the popularity. The best I can say is that it's probably loved for the "comfort food" factor - it's cheap, and yes, the chicken wings are hot, crispy, and covered with a sweet sauce. ?Nothing else I ordered was bad, but it wasn't good either. ? Ordered: Beef Chow mein Ma Po Dou Fu (Spicy bean curd dish) String Beans Tea Leaf Smoked Duck Dry Chicken Wings Rice Everything was mediocre, except maybe the chicken wings. ?Ma Po Dou Fu was especially disappointing - it was the kind of spicy that was too simple and too strong. ?There was no other flavor to it. ?The tea leaf smoked duck had a pretty good flavor, but ?presented like Peking Duck, which it was not. ? Rice - I am pretty sure they re-use. ?(They give each table a big bowl of rice for everyone at the table, and if you don't eat it all, I'm pretty sure it gets scooped up and reserved.)

GREAT WINGS!!! ?When you come to this small restaurant be prepared to stand in line and wait awhile. This place gets busy but food comes out fast and you won't be disappointed. They have some of the best wings I've ever had in a chinese restaurant. Their green beans dish was also really really good. Not fond of the curry shrimp, the mongolian beed was alright. Just get wings and rice you'll be good. SERVICE... 2 out of 5, I guess since it's an asian restaurant then that's a given lol. The guys aren't very friendly they don't check up on you and make sure you're good with drinks they just want you to sit down eat and get the heck out cause people are waiting so don't sit around and mingle cause you'll sure get dirty looks.

The dry fried chicken wings were delicious. The seawood soup was good. The green beans were good, but I think the ones at Kirin were better. Everything else we ordered was a bit on the salty side (so only 3 stars), especially the shrimp with black bean sauce and the chow mein. ?However, the noodles themselves were wonderful--thick and tasty.

Took a friend from Argentina for dinner. Didnt realize had to put our names on the whiteboard till another customer pointed it out. After a few minutes a waiter came by and said something to all people waiting which I could not comprehend at all. Suddenly 3 girls who came after us were being escorted to a large circular table which was partly already occupied. Apparently the waiter said "share a table?" !! Total wait time - 8-10 mins. Service prompt and courteous. Dry chicken wings as good as the hype. My friend ordered sweet and sour pork. It was like eating pork dessert. I could not eat one bite but she enjoyed it and even boxed the leftovers !! Decent price - 24 for 2 entres and a serving of rice. Would definitely go back again to try more dishes !

I've been this place so many times, and have craving for this regularly once a month. Black been sauce noodle is awesome, not to mention dry chicken wing. everything I tried so far have not disappointed me. be aware that this place is always packed, seriously. be there early like 5 PM if you want to beat the dinner crowd. if you go there 6 PM, you gotta wait at least 30 min. no joke.

I just love this restaurant. A friend introduced me to it about a 2 years ago and I could never forget how delicious their chicken was. HMMMM!!!! Food quality is great. Tons of flavoring in all the dishes I've tried. Noise level could be something improved, but I can tune it all out for the food. Haven't been able to find chicken anywhere else that even compares. Will always keep coming here to satisfy my chicken cravings..

GLORIOUS. The chicken wings are GLORIOUS. I came specifically to San Tung for this dish. ?So we made it an event and reserved the back room for our party. 3 orders of the chicken wings disappeared in an instant. The shrimp and leek dumplings were smooth and exceptional. ?The ?Ja Jarng Mein/black bean sauce noodles were marvelous. Both dishes were old school delicious. My mouth continues to water just thinking about those wings. This needs to be on everyone's bucket list.

San Tung's wings are things of legend. ?They made the 7x7 list and people often swear by them, proclaiming them these greatest wings ever. ?Alas, I never tried them nor even heard of them until recently. ?However, they seem to be so popular, especially in conversation, that I often find myself licking my lips from their descriptions for these things I have never tasted. ?Sometimes to fit in, I will nod in agreement and when they roll their eyes back, reliving the taste of their last Sam Tung dry wing batch, I follow suit, for no apparent reason other than to be accepted. ? Going to Yancy's yesterday to watch the Thundergod himself drop 48 points on the Thunder, JoHoBlah name dropped San Tung as a possible halftime snack. ?Yancy allows you to bring food into eat. ?JoHoBlah's eyes nearly bugged out when he learned that I, nor Wangsta nor Squawla never tried these. ?He ranted about the lore, saying that people drove from outside the city and waited hours for an order of these wings. ?I told him to say no more and promptly called San Tung and ordered 2 orders of wings. ?I came to pick them up approximately 20 minutes later and quickly ferried them back to the bar. ?Opening the box and having all eyes on me, I took a bite. ?FUCKEN DELICIOUS MAN!!. ?These wings are savory, sweet and just out of this world. ?It is called dry fried chicken; ironically, it is wet with sauce. ?However, the skin is so crispy and remains so, even when sitting around for 15-20 minutes. ?They are so addictive..once it touches your fucken lips......its over. ?I made an error in judgement and ordered only 2 orders of wings for 5 people. ?I underestimated the power of these wings as in hindsight, I should have ordered 2 boxes PER PERSON. I forgot to mention that I am not even a "wings" person. ?I don't like messy foods and the bone to meat ratio for wings are pathetic. ?It's beneath me...or..it WAS beneath me. ?San Tung's wings are enbedded with the force. ?San Tung's wings would definitely be the official food of the Dallas Mavericks.

I'm not generally a fan of fried chicken, but I'd heard so much about San Tung that I figured I had to try it. I mean, my friend has to take her boyfriend there every time he visits. It was 2 pm on a Sunday afternoon, well after lunch time, but we still had to wait about 30 minutes. We obviously ordered a plate of the famous dry fried chicken wings and also a cold peanut sauce noodles. The noodles were great - good chewy texture, though the sauce could have been more peanutty and the chicken wings were very tasty. They were piping hot and I think I burned my fingers a bit because I was too impatient to wait for them to cool down before eating. San Tung's chicken lived up to my expectations and is probably the best Korean fried chicken I've ever had, though I've only been to Bon Chon and 99 Chicken. Try it if you're in the area and don't mind a wait, it's good!

This is your normal Chinese restaurant. Big tables and loud conversations. The waiters are pretty rude too. It's like they expect you to know to put your name on the waiting list. But I guess their chicken wings are just that good to trump their service. I mean, that should be the only reason bringing you to this restaurant. Everything else is the same as any mediocre Chinese restaurant at an increased price level. If you avoid prime lunch or dinner hours then you're good to wait about 15 mins max.

san tung = saucy the wait was so long that i read all 2K reviews while waiting. ?j/k it only takes 5 reviews to figure out what you are supposed to order, so we ordered the dry fried chicken wings and the black bean sauce noodles. ?both were good, but a little too saucy for my taste buds. ?for my second trip i ordered the wings with the sauce on the side and less sauce for the noodles. since i didn't have to stand there and read all the reviews, i ended up being the erase board police. ?who knew it was so hard to write your name at the bottom of the list?!! ?i called one guy out for writing his name before the girl at the bottom of the list and i stopped one girl from writing her name at the top of the list. oh, and if anyone has a 3rd fav dish, besides the dumplings, please post.

I'll try to keep it short. Good food. Dry fried chicken wings lived up to my hype. Fried rice was some of the best I've had in a very long time. Problems: Pricey for the portions. Our group of 8 devoured nearly every dish in one go around, and we were all still feeling pretty hungry afterward. I guess it's ok if you are eating with a small group, but for a group like ours, you might want to do multiple orders of each dish, unless you're a light eater of course. Regardless, I recommend this place, and will probably eat here again in the future. FYI: Reservations are available for groups of 6 or more: Yelp ad needs to be updated.

I didn't understand the hype, so I decided to try it out and see for myself... Here's how it went down: Though mentally prepared, after looping the block 7 times and 20 mins later to find a parking spot two blocks away, I was skeptically hoping that the meal would be worth the trouble. Surprisingly, we were seated with a party of 11 right on time. Walking pass the mob in front of the place, I found myself in a very typical looking Chinese restaurant. We had all ordered quickly thanks to the suggestions from fellow yelpers. ?So we... Got the shrimp leek dumplings-decent but can be found easilly in many other restaurants. Got the dry noodles with the black sauce-didn't like it much since the sauce just covered up everything both in color and taste. Got the duck with buns and hoisin sauce-the duck was way too chewy to be eaten in the bun. Got the beef noodle soup that supposedly was made with soup that should be aged for many weeks-didn't wow me. I've had better. Got the dry fried chicken-this was the star of the night. Crunchy on the outside and moist on the inside. I have to say it was pretty good. Although I've seen this dish at many thai restaurants. All in all, I believe I ended the night more confused than satisfied. What is it about this place that intrigued the 200+ positive reviews here at yelp? Is everyone ordering something that I'm not? Why is it that the crowd in front waiting for tables only seem to grow larger throughout the night? Why would anyone want to bother with the frustation of parking only to find themselves standing up to 30mins infront waiting when Irving is down the block and Chinatown is 20mins away?

Hands down best Chinese food in the city! Dry fried chicken wings are the stuff of my dreams. Etherial shrimp and leek dumplings. Noodles are out of this world. Kim chee is stellar. Bok choy?! How do they make it so tender and flavorful? usually I don't get all bent out of shape for veggies, but this place has some killer veg. Steamed flounder, I didn't even know I liked steamed fish. Atmosphere- there is none, so don't expect it. Service- hey just be thankful that you get fed. With a kitchen and staff as busy as this place is, I don't need them to come check on me. However if you plan on drinking more than one glass of water, just ask for a pitcher/caraf for the table.

Crowded. ?Expect to wait 30 minutes. I usually order the noodles with black bean sauce (of the korean-chinese hybrid kind). The noodles are hand-pulled and are delicious. ?The sauce could use a little refinement as it's usually too light, but it's still a great dish. ? The dry fried chicken drumettes is the best dish here. ?Everybody orders them, and they are to die for. ?Do those extra sit ups, it's worth it. ?Their dumplings are good too. ? Other than that, everything else is just mediocre. ?The beef dishes all taste the same and the chow mein is sub par. ?It lacks texture and reminds me of a bad Chinese deli item.

I grew up in Indiana, and I thought I hated Chinese food. Then one day eight and a half years ago, my now-husband's family invited me to dinner at San Tung. ?Figuring that at worst, it couldn't be poison if everyone else was eating it, I tried it. ?It is not an understatement to say it was the single greatest gastronomic discovery of my life. When you go, be sure to order the shrimp and leek dumplings and the dry fried chicken (specify dry or wet, diced or wings, and spicy or not - we prefer dry, diced, and not spicy). ?Other joys include the egg rolls, bok choy with garlic sauce, mongolian beef, and tomato egg flower soup. Don't be intimidated by the cramped quarters when waiting for a table or mistake the hustle and bustle of the waitstaff as rudeness - they're friendly when taking your order and bringing your food. ?They loved my husband's grandparents so much they occasionally brought us (a table of white people) a complimentary dessert of moon cakes or oranges. I have taken every visiting friend or family member to San Tung, and they have all loved it. ?Repeat visitors to San Francisco have requested repeat visits to San Tung.

Great spot and I don't like chicken wings. ?This place is really Korean/Chinese and as such gets a rare distinction in San Francisco. The menu is authentically drawn from both cultures and can convince natives to come and wait for a table. ?The private dining room holds about 8 people and is quieter than the main dining room, which is fun and busy. ?The kitchen can be uneven and the service a bit abrupt, but again the food is why people come here every day and are willing to wait. ?The wine list is a bit weak, but corkage is so reasonable that you can byob. ?This place is only held back by lack of parking and is a bit noisy for me.

This place is really tasty. ?Beat the long line by ordering take out, which takes only 20 minutes, or coming at odd hours. ?Save some money and time by coming at lunch time. ? I tried the diced wet chicken (#76), a departure from the dried chicken wings, and really liked it. ?It has more batter and therefore more of that flavor. ?The dried sauteed string beans (#113) was also very delicious and crunchy. ? ?I have also had the black bean sauce noodles (#6?) -- fresh, with plenty of meat and other ingredients, good consistency and not too salty. ? I've had overall very good experiences here with the staff and even got to meet the owners while sitting at the large circular table with their buddies. ?They seem nice and they keep up the place pretty welll. ?I will definitely continue coming here, but I think I"ll start ordering take-out to avoid the line.

There I was, standing in front of San Tung, wondering if going to another city Chinese restaurant was a good idea. ? I'd been burned by bad Chinese restaurants in the city lately and in the nearly 2 years I've lived here I had only found 2 good Chinese restaurants in the whole city. ?Go figure. ?I had just moved from North Carolina so I wasn't exactly being picky with my Chinese food either... But back to the story. ? I decided to take the leap since I'm all about trying out new places to eat and you know what...it ROCKED. ?Their chicken wings and dumplings were savory and reminded me of good ol' home cooking. ?

Good Chinese food at reasonable prices.

My only complaints are that we asked for water and didn't get any, and that the center of the restaurant is filled with long tables which are seated on both sides with different parties, so if you come in a group of 4 or less you will likely not get your own table.

I went to San Tung because of the hype on yelp. The dry fried chicken wings did not disappoint- probably the best in San Francisco! ?At first I thought they were comparable to the BBQ wings at Plutos a couple block down on Irving St, but one after another each piece became increasingly addictive. I stand corrected that San Tung is indeed much better than Plutos. ?It seems every patron goes to San Tung for the wings as each table had a plate of their own. ?I also see a lot of dumpling orders, which I have yet to try. ? Although I've read negative reviews about their service, my experience has been overwhelmingly pleasant... nothing negative at all to state. ?In fact there's a waitress who always jokes around with me when I sit down and immediately state that I already know what to order-- dry fried chicken wings. ?The waiters are more serious and don't joke around as much, but they're still friendly. ?The waiters/waitresses don't come by during your meal to check on you, but that's typical at a Chinese restaurant. ?I personally prefer that they don't come by throughout your meal and ask if everything is okay, so long as they don't ignore you when you try and get their attention. I give 5 stars to the dry fried chicken wings and service, and 4 stars because it seems other dishes are good but not outstanding. ?The wings are enough to keep them in business year around. ?We ordered a beef dish that was okay, unfortunately I don't remember the name.

I realize that a place that already has more than 1100 reviews probably does not need another raving review, but I just can't NOT review this paradise. ?Everything on the menu is delicious. ?I am very particular about Asian, and specifically about Chinese food. ?Honestly, I have never, ever, EVER had anything so good in my life. I am so sad that I no longer live next to this place. I dream about San Tung food. ?What is it about this place that makes it taste so incredible?? I just don't know. But if you are in SF and you are looking for a good Chinese restaurant, you absolutely cannot NOT go there. It would be a crime to miss this place. As far as what I recommend there...Again, anything is good, but my personal favorites are the shrimp and vegetable dumplings for appetizers, and green string beans (even if you don't like green beans, you'd love this!), hot eggplant, and the spicy chicken wings. But again, everything is INCREDIBLE. Yes, the line for this place can be quite long, but hey, if you are looking for a food you will not forget until you die, I think it's MORE THAN WORTH IT TO WAIT IN THAT LINE. Really.

When I arrived home and took everything out, I was impressed that they separated the black bean sauce and noodles in different containers. ?Overall, the food was good and flavorful. ?The noodles with Black Bean sauce was enjoyable although I had to add some chili garlic paste to spice it up a little and the dumplings were very tasty. ?I would defintely go again and perhaps try the Dry Fried chicken wings that everyone is so crazy about.

Tons of people are usually waiting for a table here. Sometimes your name will even be erased on the waiting list by accident or by people who are impatient. Environment is very loud and cramped. Definitely cramped if your table is near the entrance where everyone is standing around waiting. Waiters and Waitresses are unpredictable. Sometimes orders will be taken quickly, sometimes not so quickly. One of our guests had a drink spilled on their jacket with no apologies. Water was never refilled even when asked. Food will come sometimes all at the same time or close together, other times the food will come so incredibly spaced out that it feels like they may have forgotten your food at points. Prices are being increased, but still fairly okay. The food is excellent. With all the negatives that this restaurant can provide, **atleast** the food is excellent. Seaweed Soup Dry Fried Chicken Dry Fried Flounder Dry Fried Greenbeans Black Bean Sauce Noodles Visited about 7+ times and will continue to revisit for the food. Definitely not for the service and environment. Take out seems to ruin the food by the way. It gets soggy and flavors seem to fade. Best to endure the beating for the good food.

The dried fried chicken is delicious! I've had it in 'wing-form' and in 'diced-form.' Personally though, I would rather have the sauce on the side, because, well I'm not too big of a fan of things drenched in a thick glazed sauce. But the sauce does give the chicken a punch on top of the crispiness. I've also tried the black bean noodle dish (ja jang mien), the sauteed string beans (a bit too salty), the peanut sauce noodle, and the shrimp and leek dumpling, all of which were decent, but nothing spectacular. Serving Northern Chinese cuisine, it's only understandable that the flavors are very heavy, but I think that the foods can taste just as great with less sauce and sodium. I'd be willing to go back to this place, but it's not a go-to place on my list. P.S. the wait can be long, so make sure to get their early and get your name written on that whiteboard!

This review only comments on the food. (Despite the fact that it's over-priced, and the wait is too long.) Um, why did nobody mention that the Dry Fried Chicken is SWEET?? Don't be fooled by the photos - it ain't gonna be spicy or salty, despite the presence of chili peppers in the dish. The sauce for the fried chicken was thick like honey. Indeed, it was honey-encrusted chicken! Not what I expected at all. The green beans also came in SWEET sauce! Holy shit, are they catering towards toddlers or something?? Hey parents, bring your kids! This place will satisfy their sweet-tooth fo sho. Don't order soup - the mushroom in the one we had ?was canned, not fresh. I didn't order any dumplings, because nobody can beat my mom's dumplings. Not to mention the fact that any Chinese person would've had dumplings since they were babies.

RECOMMENDATIONS: DRY FRIED CHICKEN WINGS I came her with a relatively large group on the weekend only to find that there was nearly no way for them to seat us. ?They had the tables, but there were simply too many people in there! ?We waited almost thirty minutes before getting seated, but we were serviced pretty quickly. ?Most of the servers have really good English while the rest can get by. ?I didn't get anything extra for speaking to them in Chinese =P. The dried-fried chicken really is very good! ?This is probably the only reason most people come here. ?That being said, I would come here only for the chicken. ?The other dishes I tried didn't tickle me right at all. ?They claim to be "dumpling kings" outside, and they aren't bad, but they did somewhat let down. ?Maybe it was that there was too much hype from having waited so long to get seated, and I expected these pork and veggie dumplings to really wow. ?Everything is a bit more pricey than expected but only compared to typical SF Chinatown offerings. ?I might just as easily give four stars, but the wait is a little not worth it for just chicken.

The dry fried wings were absolutely worth the bike ride from SOMA and are worth the four star rating. ?Also tried their black bean sauce noodles, which I thought were good, though not great. ?Service was exactly what you'd expect from a popular Chinese restaurant in the Sunset/Richmond... mild wait followed by service that is adequate, but not outstanding. Overall, definitely come out to try it at least once and get the wings.

Yes their chicken wings are what drew me to come here and wait for over an hour every single time. But I honestly cannot understand what the hype is for the rest of their foods. The first time I had the wings, I felt like I was in heaven. Then my friends and I decided to order a second dish of wings and it didn't hit me as it did the very first time.

This place already has too many reviews and I most likely will be echoing what others have said. ?I just tried out this place today for the first time. ?I had Christmas lunch with my sister. ?Let me just add my two cents. The place opened up at 11:00 a.m. ?We got there at around 10:45 a.m. and there was already a line forming!! (Good sign!!) What we Ate 1) Dried Fried Chicken Wings == F'n AWESOME--cripsy, tangy, sweet, juicy, LOTS of flavor. so far the best Chinese style wings I have eaten so far 2) Ja Jang Noodles (black bean sauce) == Pretty good, but I've had better. ?Large portions of seafood. ?Just a tad on the dry side. ? 3) Dried Fried Green Beans == Fresh veggies, very nice combination of salty and sweet--(my wife thought they were a little bit too salty) But I had no complaints. ? 4) Beef-Tang-suyuk -- Very fresh veggies were used, the fried pieces of meet were good. ?Sauce was good. ?Overall a good dish, but I can't say it was any better than the tang-suyuk I've had at Sam Wang (japan town). 5) Portion size=a little bit smaller than what I'm used to getting at a Chinese Restaurant. ?However, the quality and taste made up for the portion size. 6) service was typical of any Chinese Restaurant, quick, efficient, but not friendly. 7) P.S. I saw a lot of tables ordering what looked like steamed dumplings (or for you korean folks, mul-mandu) -- A lot of people were ordering them, I'm going to make sure to try them next time. Overall, My new favorite Chinese Restaurant!! (former favorites were Tsing Tao in Berkeley and Sam Wang in SF Japan Town).

From outside, this place looks like it would be forgettable, but I was definitely impressed by this gem after a local recommended it. MUST ORDER: Dry Friend Crispy Wings - ?I'm a wing eater, so it means alot when I say that I was blown out of the water by their seasoning and cooking. ?The wings were friend to a mouth-watering golden brown, and then basted in some sort of honey-chili-soysauce sticky sauce that I can still taste now. ?My mouth is watering just thinking about it. ?The wings are big too! ?And the taste is so unique. Ja Jang Myun - ?The noodles seem to be hand tossed. ?The actual sauce is cooked very traditionally and includes many slices of pork belly and cucumber. ?The portion was huge! ?Definitely enough to share, and a great way to fill up if you're hungry. Seafood Chow Ma Myun - ?Likewise, the noodles were hand tossed. ?THis is a red spicy seafood noodle soup. ?I was very impressed by the broth and all the little elements in the broth that gave it such a strong seafood flavor. ?There were shrimp, scallops, and mussels, as well as sliced onion, zucchini, and carrots. ? I was also very fond of the service here. ?Unlike other Chinese places that I'm used to, the service here was fast, friendly, and respectful. ?The flavors here cannot be replicated. ?I will definitely be returning in the near future.

Most people come to Sung Tung for their dry chicken wings, but its their authentic Asian style noodles that keeps me coming back. ?The cold peanut noodle is especially delicious and comes in large portions. ? The only downsides to this neighborhood joint are the waiting and parking situations. ?If you do decide to try this place, be prepared to wait at least 30 minutes. Parking is a pain as well. ?It took me 10-20 minutes to find a parking spot. ?If you live in the sunset area, I suggest taking the N line rather than driving.

Best Chinese restaurant I've ever been to. Chinese is amongst my favorite type of restaurant and I've been to a fare share of them. Everything was so flavorful, the seaweed soup is to die for. The chicken wings are truly great. The dry beef was yummy, but the best dish was the cherry pork. Every thing was so flavorful. Plus, Rob Lowe ate right next to our table. I highly recommend to any Chinese food fan!!! New note. ?The only thing that didn't hold up on re-heat were the chicken wings, but everything else had the same great taste.

I really don't get all the hype. To me this is your typical Americanized ?Chinese restaurant. We settled with their spicy wings, peanut sauce noodles and their tea smoked duck. The wings weren't spicy at all. In fact they were incredibly sweet. I'm pretty sure our waiter did that intentionally cause he kept on telling us the spicy wings would be too hot for us! You don't know me foo! I eat food hot enough to make you cry in the corner begging for milk! The peanut noodles were ok- the sauce was a little too thick and the flavor of the peanut sauce overpowered the shrimp and scallops. The duck was the winner of the meal! Juicy, tender and flavorful smoked duck that just melts in your mouth. In a city with a million Chinese restaurants, I just don't see myself coming back here. Why wait an hour for your typical Chinese restaurant?

I've been going to this restaurant for years, and it is still delicious ... And usually crowded. Parking can be difficult in this area, depending on the day/time .. But most locals know that already. I usually get my food to-go, and it still tastes great! Obviously, the dry fried chicken wings are a must (the popular ones)! The sweet and sour cod fillet is tasty and tender - don't let the bright red color throw you off. The beef and green onion dish is another favorite, along with the popular green bean dish. Ooh, I'm getting hungry just thinking about all of the tasty dishes. I'd recommend this Korean-Chinese restaurant in a heartbeat.

the sweet and sour beef with brown sauce is a MUST TRY! sweet and sour anything is probably my least favorite chinese dish to order... its soo "americanized" but its soo good here! just a FYI for those who gets excited too quickly... if you ever order it to go, they pack the sauce and the fried beef separate... its not a free box of food with a weird sweet and sour soup :P the five spice beef noodle soup is delicious too! i love all the tendons it came with and tender big chunks of beef. the sauteed string beans had a good crisp texture but it was too sweet for me

Love the dry fried chicken wings, black bean sauce noodles, and steamed pork dumplings in that order. ?Veggie pot stickers and spicy dry fried string beans are close runner ups. ?Either go real early, or real late. ?The wait is long! ?They have a self serve sign-up dry-board. ? They have a good sized menu, but we tend to order the same things over and over; so I can't review the other dishes. ?I've been going here for years. The dining room seats about 60 and gets really noisy. ?The servers always seem a little rushed, but their English is better than most Asian places. ?The boss speaks it just fine. ?Never had any problems except they tend to check on you less if your table is close to the street, farthest from the kitchen. ?It's well lit, but otherwise, it's a no nonsense decor. ?Closed Wednesdays. ?Groups up to 10.

Easily one of my favorite Chinese restaurants. The pricing is reasonable and the portions are big. Lunch dishes come with soup and rice--plenty to fill you up! The diced dry fried chicken is my absolute favorite thing here. It's a bit crunchy but tender and sweet with a hint of spicy. It's always busy, so come early. The wait is long, but (as long as it's not raining) it's sooo worth it. I'd come out more, but parking is pretty difficult.

5 stars for one of the best dry fried chicken wings I have ever tasted. However, the rest of the food in the restaurant is just decent after that. A safe bet is to order noodle dishes when you are there since they are not bad at all. I'm sure mostly everyone goes here for the chicken wings, which I do not blame them for. Just don't have the highest expectations when it comes to ordering other food besides the wings.

Hotty McHotterton: ?*Hey luis, you want to go have dinner at San Tung?* Luis m: ?*Yeah!* ?slaps belly and does fat boy dance... Oh my goodness, what the heck is wrong with me? ?This question was posed and the above answer given AFTER Saturday's Clambake. ?You know, the clambake at which I pretty much just sat in one spot and stuffed my face. ?Sedentary lifestyle at it's finest and yet I'm going to go have dinner where I will stuff my face some more. ?I'm seriously a whole lot of not quite right. Anyway, I found myself here with a group of other yelpers who had enjoyed the clambake as well on a late Saturday afternoon. ?With Ed taking control of the ordering we were treated to San Tung's finest tasty options. ?We had two orders of the shrimp and leek dumplings, which were probably some of the most savory dumplings I have had. ?Of course my expert concoction of white vinegar, soy sauce, and chili oil just added to the already great taste. ?We also have two orders of some large pork dumplings which were good. ?The beef and tomato chow mein was an MSG coated hit. ?The noodles slid across your lips and tongue leaving a trail of tasty behind. ?We also had 3 orders of the fried chicken. ?Two orders of wings and one order of the diced. ?I think that was a great combo because the wings, while more work, are enjoyable to eat and the diced chicken kept a lot of moisture in the meat. ?It was a great balance of sweet and spicy. The place itself is a bustling Chinese joint filled with Asians, an important indicator that the food they serve is making someone happy and it's not someone who doesn't know what they are talking about. ?Seating is very cozy. ?The room is filled with round and rectangular tables. ?I'm sure they could accommodate two person parties but this looks like the kind of place you bring family and/or friends for some serious grubbin'. ?They even have a small room with a large round table that I am sure you can make a special request for if your group needs to discuss your plans to take over the world in a more private setting. I'm going back for a plate of chicken and those shrimp/leek dumplings for sure.

Any night you score parking in an 8 passenger monster SUV within 2 minutes, directly across the street from your destination is a rip roaring good night. ?On top of that, with reservations, our party was seated within 5-10 minutes. ?Precursory sequences like this can make a hungry girl downright giddy. ? While San Tung's storefront is a visual wonder, the dining experience actually isn't as health hazardous as it would appear to be; well, except for the fact that there's a lot of foot traffic and it's sort of self-serve... meaning, you lifting up the empty dishes your table has polished off to flag down overworked, hard-pressed waiters ?(TIP: They're actually very resilient and responsive to this method). I'm not sure what kind of fire codes they adhere to, but they pack it in - though, ?certainly an indicator of good food. ?I hadn't read all the Yelp reviews before visiting, but fortunately, my expert friends pulled rank and ordered all the recommendations (thanks Jason & Jane!): jajangmien cham-pong (spicy seafood noodle soup) *kampungi (spicy fried chicken wings)* steamed dumplings (watch out for 2nd degree burns) green beans vegetable stirfry spicy shrimp... even the white rice was yummy. ?All excellent, flavorful, with perfect texture. ?(Actually, I didn't care for the jajangmein - sadly, tasted like a lump of dough). ?We stuffed ourselves silly with hardly any damage: $13/pp for a party of 10.

we came a couple months ago, on a sunday night, and the place was so packed that the wait was out the door. so we tried another place that night and decided to try this place another time. yesterday afternoon, we were in the area, so we decided to stop in for lunch. one of the things i had heard about san tung was that it was dirt cheap. that definitely wasnt the case. $13 for an order of kung pao shrimp? dayum! i could go to places just as good, if not better, and get something similar AND an order of fried rice/chow mein for the same price. the food was aight...i got the dry fried chicken(diced). it wasn't really dry, maybe they gave me the wrong order. but it was pretty good and had a ton of chicken, so it was probably worth the $9. the kung pao shrimp tasted ok to me, but nothing special. definitely not worth $13 considering the shrimp, or lack there-of. the service was a bit lackluster. the guy that took our order was a little rude. nothing specific that i can pin-point, but he just came off that way. our entrees came at different times. we were nearly finished with the shrimp and rice before the chicken finally came. i'd rather wait an extra few minutes and get my food at the same time. anyways, for me, it was just average/expensive chinese food with mediocre service. next time im in the area, i'll hit up irving pizza...

Somehow I managed to marry into the only Jewish family on the planet that doesn't eat Chinese food. To my wife, my sister-in-law and my mother-in-law Chinese food means plain steamed vegetables and rice or Chinese Chicken Salad. So I thought that the stereotypical Jewish Christmas ritual of Chinese food and a movie was out this year and the movie part was but fortunately my brother-in-law, the son of a minister, and my father-in-law both really wanted Chinese. They live in that well known desert when it comes to good Chinese food, Marin and rarely come into the City and even more rarely get to eat Chinese food let alone good Chinese so before I knew it I was phoning in a large order to San Tung. I should add that I was phoning the order from the foyer of an Orthodox temple. I'm not making this up. It's a long story, actually it's not long but it's not interesting either. Anyway, if you ever want to get the stink-eye order pork with green onions, shrimp and leek dumplings and pork chow mein with homemade noodles from San Tung while in the foyer of an Orthodox temple. Lightning did not strike me so if there is a god he obviously has better things to worry about like making sure gays don't marry and people make field goals and free throws and stem cells don't get used to cure diseases than what I choose to throw down my gullet. (For full disclosure I should add that my father is an Italian Jew. Not the progeny of a paisan and an member of the tribe like Amy Fisher, Howard Stern or Andrew Dice Clay but an actual Jew from Italy so obsevance of Kashrut dietary law took a back seat to love of really good Prosciutto di Parma. My mom isn't Jewish so technically I'm not although I did have a Bar Mitzvah. But I didn't study for it. I did it phonetically from note cards. In Greece. The rabbi flew in from Istanbul. Really. I'm not making this up. Also I didn't actually know my dad was Jewish until about a week before the BM) Enough about my bizarro-world heritage onto important stuff-FOOD. Dry Fried Chicken. Everyone raves about it. Why? Because it fucking rules that's why. Here's the thing, for the most part, chicken, to me, is something that must be tolerated. In the great meat hierarchy it is way down on the list after beef, pork, fish, lamb, duck, veal, goose, venison, elk, moose you get the picture. Dry Fried Chicken from San Tung is the exception. As much as I love Dry Fried Chicken I thought that Dry Fried Beef would be even better. It isn't. Stick with the chicken. It is better than the beef. I don't know why. I thought that chicken fried steak would be better than fried chicken too and it isn't but what do I know. I digress. My preference: Original (dry) dry fried chicken diced. Tea Smoked Duck. After you have TSD from San Tung you will never go back to Peking (Beijing?) duck. And I've had Peking (Beijing?) duck in Beijing (Peking?). Homemade dumplings. Shrimp and leek dumplings, pork and veggie dumplings, potstickers. DAMN! Homemade noodles. If you order soup or noodles here spend the extra buck and get the homemade noodles. Yeah San Tung is always crowded and has no ambiance and the place isn't as tightly a run ship as it was before James left to open So about ten blocks west ?and you have to wait and parking sucks but it's still the best Northern Chinese food in the City. Oh, and my wife and sister-in-law and mother-in-law say they make great steamed vegetables.

The chicken wings are incredible. Our party of 5 had to wait less than 5 minutes to be seated. It is unfortunate that our waitress was somewhat unattentive (slow refills of tea, no refills of ice water), as that is the only thing that keeps this from a 5-star rating. Great place to eat. The caveat is that all the dishes are heavily doused in oil and sauce, so it's not the healthiest of places to eat. More of an once-a-week indulgence, at most. Dinner was cheap as well, our party of 5 was completely stuffed for around $10/head.

I can't believe we still had to wait for 20 minutes on a Monday afternoon for lunch. This place is consistently packed with a long line to boot. The only knock is that service and the waiters can be pretty rude and inattentive. But they do pack your leftovers for you rather than just giving you boxes. Before reviewing the food, avoid coming here on Wednesdays because they are closed. You will be pumped up to eat good food only to disappointed and fall into a depressed state. Anyway, onto the food! The dried fried chicken wings are the best chicken wings I've ever had hands down. They just don't compare to anything else. Perfect blend of sweet, salty and everything in-between. The same goes for the calamari. The dried fried calamari is one of the most underrated items on the menu and nobody seems to talk about it at all. Like the chicken wings, it is fried then served with a wet sauce. It has a really nice crunch and the flavor of the sauce is great - it tastes like a honey glaze. It's my favorite thing on the menu and I think it's even better than the chicken wings. The potstickers here are also huge and tasty. They are fried too and have a nice crunch with wonderful soup juices within. Unlike everything else, they lack a delicious sauce, but you can create your own with soy sauce and the hot chili paste. Lastly, their noodles are also a must-try item. I've had the black bean noodles twice now and they are good, but my new favorite is the three spice noodle dish with a bunch of seafood and vegetables. It is a little spicy, but I like it a lot and gives it a good kick. With all the sauce you get from all the dishes, one would think you should order some rice, but by the time you get through all the food, you will be stuffed. ? This place is definitely a required place to try if you're visiting the city and you have the patience to wait a long time to be seated. Otherwise, come at an odd hour in the late afternoon and grab a takeout box of the chicken wings to take home - plop yourself in front of the television and enjoy!

The original dried fried wings were delicious. I just had lunch but i'm drooling thinking about the savory sauce on the wings. I'm still swallowing. The other dishes were pretty solid too but the best was the wings. For the price and for what you get, this was I think the best dinnner in SF for me.

3.75 Stars My friend took me here recently for dinner but the wait was killer. I am pretty impatient when it comes to waiting in line to sit down so I always make reservations or go when the restaurant opens. 40 minutes later or probably longer, my friend and I were seated but we had to share a table. But luckily, it was a huge table so no biggie. Service was a bit shaky but we ordered and got our food, spicy chicken wings, rice, dumplings, and lemon chicken. If I knew in advanced what to order from Yelp, I would have not ordered the dumplings or the lemon chicken. The fried chicken wings were very good and seems like everyone raves about it but the other items were pretty much disappointing. The dumplings lacked flavor and I drenched them in soy sauce just to cover the odd taste of it. The lemon chicken was the biggest disappointment here. I have never been disappointed which lemon chicken until now. Typically, places I have gone to would have a sweet tangy sauce and the chicken would be tender, juicy, and crispy on the outside. San Tung's version was sour, and I mean sour. It tasted like the SOUR LEMON candy was poured all over the sauce and chicken and there was so much sauce all over the chicken that the crispiness was not present and you cannot taste the chicken at all. Every bit was painful and excruciating. I did love the chicken wings which was perfect and no complaints there. I would order to go from here because it is pretty pricy for a party of 2 and the wait is just too much.

arrived in SFO at 1pm came here for lunch and it was packed!! 2pm, and there was still a line! We ordered the famous dish: chicken wet (both wet and dry)... the chicken wings were good! Each dish had about a dozen chicken wings. Both dish is spicy, but it wasnt at all. The wet chicken wings tasted like hot and sour soup (just the sauce itself; if u were to close ur eyes, give yourself a little taste of just the sauce and piece of mushroom, u'll know what i mean). The dry one, isnt REALLY dry dry. there were still sauce, just that it wasnt as SAUCY as the wet dish. And they are both completely different in taste. both dishes have really good flavor. It'll for sure make you want more. we also ordered the shrimp and leek dumplings. It was okay. NOthing spectacular about them. Lastly we ordered the Black Bean Sauce Noodle. this is not your typical cantonese style black bean sauce that you normally have in restaurants. It's a thick paste of black bean sauce.This noodle is exactly like Ja-Jang Mein where you have a paste of sauce and some veggies / other ingredients and you just mix it all togheter. Perhaps that's what it says in the menu in chinese.. but in english it doenst tell you that it's ja-jang mein style. yes, i'd come back here again, but ONLY for their chicken wings.

I don't understand why everybody thinks this is such a great restaurant and why the chicken wings are good? ?The chicken wings taste like a typical orange chicken dish you find at Panda Express. ?Our group made reservations at 8pm and arrived just 5 minutes late to find the manager gave our table away and that we had to wait another hour. ?Our group did not sit down to eat until 9pm and the restaurant closed at 9:30pm. ?The food was less than mediocre. ?Definitely not worth the wait. ?I've had better Chinese food elsewhere.

My first time back here for the chicken wings in about four years. ?Best believe that it won't be that long before I'll be back here again. ?I literally forgot how good the dry fried chicken wings are. ?The sweet and spicy aroma of the fried wings invigorated my senses and got my mouth watering. ?The crunchy fried batter, sweet glaze with a spicy, savory and slightly gingery sauce and scorching and steaming hot (temperature-wise) chicken meat are a perfect combination. ?It's perfectly delicious Chinese fried chicken and it's worth waiting in line for or you can simply order to-go if you don't feel like waiting for a table as the fried chicken travels very well. ?I also am a fan of the popular black bean sauce noodles with zucchini and scallops. ?Looks like a muddy mess, but tastes pretty good.

This was my second time dining at San Tung and I went on the recommendation of many friends. ?There is always a huge line no matter what night you choose to go. ?And they will only take reservations for five or more. Monday night dining and we were seated within ten minutes with our reservations holding us a spot. ?Otherwise, feel free to join the crowd as you write your name on the dry erase board by the front door. Kim chee is a complimentary appetizer and it's not like the kind most would expect. ?Not as sour, more sweet with the heat from the spices creeping up at the end. We ordered sizzling rice soup, pan fried vegetable pot stickers, the original fried chicken wings, black bean sauce noodles (dry), and braised string beans. The soup was very tasty and I definitely enjoyed that. ?However, the meal fell flat after that. ? Six deep-fried (not pan-fried) pot stickers arrived on our table. I was a bit thrown off by the overly fried exterior. ?There's a big difference between deep-fried skin and pan-fried skin. ?Disappointing. ? ? Next, a bowl heaping with peanut sauce landed on our table. ?My dining companions and I looked at each other and I noted, "It smells like peanut butter." ?After waving down the waiter, we asked him what the order was, he confirmed the peanut smell and we told him we didn't order that. ?We saw the dish leave our table and arrive on someone else's. ?A different bowl arrived on our table a few minutes later with seafood and black sauce. ?Again, my dining companions and I looked at each other. ?I wasn't familiar with the dish myself, but two other girls were and they both noted, "I don't remember seafood in it." ?We waved the waiter down again and asked him what the dish was. ?He said it was our black bean sauce noodles and left. ?So, we accepted our dish and I had to wave the waiter down to get a serving spoon so we could mix the noodles up. ?I was expecting more flavor in the noodles and there just wasn't any. ?It tasted overly starchy. ?A few more bites, the taste improved but it was not something I wanted seconds of. ? Our plate of chicken wings arrived. ?Tasty and sweet, but noted by another dining companion that their serving sizes were shrinking. ?She was disappointed to see that. The braised string beans were standard. ?They were as they were, nothing spectacular to rave about. Service needs improvement. ?They were not understaffed at all, but we often had to wave the waiter down for water, tea, etc. ?At one point, a set of lights shut off and it was the restaurant's way of telling us to leave already. ?We were not done with our meal at this point and there were quite a few tables still eating as well. ?(Having worked in a restaurant before, this was definitely not acceptable.) ?It also didn't help with the waiter standing at our table trying to collect our money for the bill. ?I felt very rushed when eating there. I wouldn't return. ?Most people I know who love the place also know the owners some way or another. ?And I confess, the one time I ate there before, my companion knew the owner too. ?So, perhaps one needs to have it in to get some decent food and decent service?

the best thing about this place as everyone has already mentioned are the chicken wings!! also try the sizzling rice soup and the hot braised flounder. the sauce they use on the flounder is more or less the same sauce as the chicken, but the flounder provides a better texture to eat with rice. parking is a nightmare, but to be expected on irving street. the wait is crraazzyyy sometimes, but that's what happens when the food is good.

Their dry-fried chicken wings made it to the 100 things to eat before you die according to 7X7's The Big Eat SF. ?So in the quest to conquer all of the items listed on there without too-adverse effect on the waistline, I very very slowly tick off the items, one by one We arrived at San Tung on a Sunday night only to find a huge crowd waiting outside. ?From what I heard, the wait could be north of 40 minutes. Not for us. ?Since we arrived fashionably late, the rest of the group have been seated and soon the ordering commenced - chicken wings and dried black bean sauce noodles (which looked like the whole thing was dipped in ink) were the two dishes that stuck in my mind... the rest are just your typical Chinese fares. The wait and the horrendous parking situation would probably deter me from coming back.

We must have gotten the wrong dishes because everything was mediocre to us. There is ALWAYS a line out the door so we decided to see what all the fuss was about. We arrived on Saturday at 5:30pm and the place was PACKED. We ordered the hot and sour soup, the mushroom vegetable stir fry, shrimp and lobster sauce, beef satay, and the shrimp fried rice. The soup was probably the best dish out of all of those. I wasn't impressed with the other dishes. Seemed like I could have gotten the same thing at any other Chinese restaurant. Service was OK. We had to flag down the 7 waiters that were working to get our check, and boxes. Otherwise, they were pretty friendly. Meal was priced moderately as well. Would come back again, maybe take out next time. Definitely didn't stand out with me.

[overdue entry #2 for today]. A place owned by a Chinese & a Korean. The hubs Chinese and the wifey is Korean, no wonder there's a Korean kick to it. They serve Kimchi here, not your ordinary Kimchi, yea, it's spicy, BUT it's more on the sweeter side, which is NOT SO COOL especially since im Korean. It's clever to cater to the other people but what's the frikkin point when you're really not giving them the TRUE EXPERIENCE? Kimchi ain't supposed to be sweet... Anyways, I will give it 1 star for even HAVING kimchi, but then again, they lose another star for making it sweet. BLEH.. ?So I guess it evens out to no star. Service was hit or miss. Some servers were extremely helpful and accommodating. There was one who was just SO rude. ?But overall, service was AWFUL plus FOOD CAME OUT SOOOOO SLOW. Long ass wait, but I liked how they had a dry wash board where you sign in. Again, neutral stars. Hm. Now, onto the food... -Beef w/Snow Peas $5.75 lunch special (you get steamed rice and soup of the day.. the soup of the day was Shark's Fin soup I believe, and it was GOOOD.) Since soup was good, 1 star, beef w/snow peas, they need more snow peas, so no lose .5 star. -Dry Fried Chicken (dry or wet) $5.50. I give it 5. For the lunch special, you get 6 pieces, and it was GOOD. It had a sweet kick to it, the moist chicken was yummy. -Shrimp & Leek Dumplings ($6.50) 12 lil dumplings mixed w/ginger and garlic w/shrimp &Chinese chives. I think my mom makes better dumplings, but overall, 3.5stars. I give another .25 star because their menu is written in English, Korean & Chinese. Another .25 star because they have jjambbong, and jja jang myun ... (black noodle & spicy noodle soup) I haven't tried tho, I'll come back and try... I witnessed this parrot there nibbling the noodles. Peek foto! So, grand total: hahah. 3.5 stars.

shangdong style, known for noodles and dumplings but really it's the dry fried chicken wings that take the cake -- haven't seen other places replicate this (perfectly fried but with a wet glaze also they have dry fried fish they serve pickled cabbage (sweeter and less fermented) but is really supposed to go with the dumplings this place is always worth waiting for atmosphere isn't the greatest, but still crowded over the years little whiteboard to place your name -- the wait moves fast, esp. if you share tables the dry fried chicken wings are ordered so often, our waitress said "and #74 right?" dry fried chicken wings: sweet glaze, garlic and mild pepper (vs. SO, sweeter here) excellent combo of flavors lotsa noodles here (made fresh), dumplings which are the things to get peanut sauce noodles overpowering peanut butter flavor

FINALLY got to check this place out Friday night w/Grace M. ?It was almost 9pm and there were still a bunch of people waiting for tables. Knowing my Chinese brethren I figured they ?weren't gonna to turn money at the door away, so we waited it out, all the while Grace was already planning our menu. About 20mins or so we had our seats at one of the big banquet tables which we shared with two other fellows sitting on the other side. ?No biggie, our tummies did not stand on ceremony. Dry Fried Chicken, dried fried shrimp, some tomato egg flower soup, rice and tea ordered, we got to waitin'. The soup came out pretty quick (I like that they had 4 price tiers on the soup, to fit the party's size), and and the rest of our dishes arrived within another 15min. The dudes got some mushu pork and the boiled pork & leeks dumplings. We amicably checked each others food out. ? The chicken was most definitely the highlight. ?We gnawed them chicken wings and drumsticks, gnawed the gristle & the meat, EVERTHING off. ?Kinda excessive on our part, cuz it had a good 10 pieces on the plate, and we ultimately couldn't finish along with the other dishes. So we offered it to our compatriots across the table. And they shared their dumplings with us. Though we were stuffed sick, we still tried them - not bad, but not as good as Peking Eastern House in Fremont ;-). ?They thought the chicken was the best thing at the table, too. You're not coming the San Tung to get a napkin laid across your lap, a private environment, or your water glass kept full. ?In fact you'll have the gesticulate wildly to get that water, and suffer eager customers staring at you, staring you down if you dawdle. But for the price - you'll be getting some damned tasty grubs. And maybe making some new friends.

The specialty of the house is the dry spicy chicken wings; though, I think it interesting that they refer to them as dry, because it is the sauce (almost like a spicy general tso's sauce) that the wings are covered in that makes them delectable. ?I highly recommend the dry spicy flounder. It is basically prepared the same way as the chicken wings (battered fried then rolled in the sauce) and in my opinion, better than the wings (no bones!)! Everyone orders the dry string beans, but they are just okay. If you are looking for a veggie, opt for the vegetable moo shu instead. ?The pot stickers and dumplings are also great (try the shrimp dumplings). Portions are a good size and enough for sharing. Ordered about 6 dishes and the total came to ~$50. Not too bad considering we were all full. Four stars.

Yummy, yummy. ?Had vegi steamed dumplings, kong pao chicken, and dried sauteed string beans. ?Chicken quality was good. ?String beans were crispy. ?I asked for extra spicy for the kong pao and string beans. ?Unfortunately, it didn't come out that way but there was delicious hot sauce on the table which made up for the problem. ?The dumping skin and filler were good - though no special dipping sauce. ? Service was good. ?Prices were reasonable. ?I would recommend and and will go back.

It's not authentic Chinese food, but it's good food nonetheless. The deep fried chicken wings were very tasty, and I loooved the black bean sauce noodles, which are hand pulled!! The dumplings were alright - I thought they were a bit bland and dry. Definitely order the cold noodles too. The line is long but it's worth the wait. :-)

Wings, Wings, Wings! Every time I come here, I come here for the wings. One of my favorite foods is chicken wings. And here at this place, they make the tastiest chicken wings. I would say every table would order it. Other than the wings, I usually order their dom dom noodles (spicy) or the black bean sauce noodles. Both are very filling and delicious. I also like their dumplings with pork or chicken filling. I usually come here around lunch time to beat the crowd. It's usually packed at night times. Price is reasonable and service is cool. If you visit, you must order the wings. Drools!

Went here last night with my family. ?You really need to watch the dry erase board. ?They'll call your name and if you're not around they just erase it, so be careful. ?One time a girl came up and wrote her name on top of ours, so I nonchalantly fixed it for her ;) We had the dry fried chicken, really tasty but it's very sweet and spicy so be warned. ?We had the Wonton soup which was tasty. ?We had the chicken with cashews which was nice but the shrimp with black bean sauce was less than desirable. ?I guess I'd stay away from the seafood here. ?The bill only came to about $40 which is pretty cheap for 4 people.

monday six pm, group of five, twenty min wait... this is wat we ordered: combo chow mein.. greasy but delicious. mushu beef.. greasy but delicious. some noodle soup.. their noodle soups are bland in general. two plates of dry fried chicken wings.. 22 pc? that ought to be just right to satisfy our bellies... thirty mins later, i scanned the remains... ? turns out i had eaten half the chow mein, 35% of the wings, and scraped all remaining mushu onto my plate without offering to anybody else (epic chinese FAIL!)... at this point, two questions come to mind: one. did i just enact sin? ?and two. do we still split the bill evenly? ?8T

I don't understand why people are ga ga over this place. ?The chicken wings are good and flavorful but this isn't a Chinese dish. ?Its a Panda Express dish with bones in it. ?Yum. ?The dumplings here suck. ?Everyone raves how good they are. ?They are bland, boring, and crap. ?Dumpling King in outer Richmond is way better. ?There are always hoards of people waiting to eat this Americanized Chinese. ?This place is in the ranks with Burma Supercrap. ?Massive lines with massive shitty food. ?If you are going to be a stubborn fatty and eat here just get the ja ja mein.

I've been hearing so many things about the chicken wings here so I finally came here to try them. ?I came here on a weekday in the afternoon and waited about ten minutes to be seated. ?So the wait wasn't too bad. My friend and I ordered the dry chicken wings, shrimp and leek dumpling and this tofu and vermicelli dish. ?The dry chicken wings were pretty good; it tasted exactly like angel wings from Thai restaurants! The shrimp and leek dumpling tasted like the typical dumplings from dim sum restaurants and the tofu and vermicelli dish was just okay. ?I'll probably just order the dry chicken wings if I ever do come back.

First off, I usually go to Hunan food at places across town that are, well, incredible. I just moved to the Sunset and didn't want to trek across town for my Chinese food craving. So I went to this place due to all of the glowing reviews. I ordered take out because of the complaints of the wait, service, etc. When I picked up my food the place was packed. "This is a good sign", I thought. Here's the review: McDonald's has served billions, and it's crap. American Idol is the most popular television show in America, and it's crap. Mariah Carey sells millions of records, and is one of the top selling recording artists of our time. I hate her. San Tung is super popular and the food is such crap. People who claim this food is spicy really have never been to Brandy Ho's, or any other Hunan style restaurant for that matter. Can I have a little more sugary corn starch and MSG with my chicken please? And, oh yeah, my order came with: No napkins. No chop sticks. No pot sticker sauce. No soy sauce. No smile. No flavor. I can go on, but who'd listen?

Eating at San Tung has made me realize that I may need to rethink my rating system for Yelp reviews. ?It should be ranked by "most forgettable" experience to "I just can't quit you, I think about you every night and day, I've been to the moon and back" experience. ?The latter is how I feel about San Tung. ?One bite into those sweet and savory, oh-so-crispy dry-fried chicken wings and I knew I was a goner. ?But then the GAN-jjajangmyun ("dry" black bean noodles) comes along and I'm reminiscing of Dragon's jjajangmyun from Ktown (although I'd say Dragon's is still better). ?You'd think that's it, but oh no, then you get a plate of steaming, hot dumplings. ?Dip it in a concoction of vinegar & soy sauce to your liking and you're sent back in time to those days when your grandma made dumplings from scratch while you waited patiently by her side on the kitchen floor, excited to eat them right away. ?And the dry-fried green beans. ?Oh yes. ?Crispy, they are. ?Tasty, definitely. ?But don't let them steal the show. ?San Tung is all about those chicken wings. ?Those darn chicken wings that I just can't stop thinking about. ?I have mentioned San Tung in nearly every conversation I have had since eating there. ?It's like an over-obsessive one-sided love affair. We also got a side of rice that we could have done without. ?And they give you complimentary spicy Chinese-style kimchi. ?The kimchi is actually spicy! ?About a 15 minute wait around 2pm on a Saturday. ?Get there after 3 (but before the dinner rush) and there will be NO wait at all. ?Empty tables, even. ?Total bill for 4 plates and rice = ~$30. ?Parking, a pain.

The dry wings that are wet are the DELISH. ?The dry flounder is hella good too. ?From my last visit, I noticed a small private dining room in the back near the restrooms. ?Not sure how many it seats, but it's there. ?There's also a dry erase board on the front wall for the waiting list. ?If you go and there's a line, go straight for the board. ?I found out about the board after being there for a bit, so got on after someone else put their name on ahead of me. ?It makes it easier too if you put how many are in your party. ?The wait wasn't oo long, but there was only 2 of us. ?It gets pretty crowded in there but it's worth it. ?Parking is typical SF parking, so good luck!

5 stars for the chicken wings!!!! ? - it was the perfect mix of sweet and salty sauce, soaked into their crispy, freshly fried tapioca batter, which bursts into a warm flavor of heavenly goodness into your mouth. ?i could probably eat the fried chicken every day, and i probably wouldnt get sick of it. 1 star for all the other food * so terrible that we had to play games to see who had to finish the leftovers - string beans were not fresh, the texture/color was like they had been soaked in water, froze, then re-refrigerated and then brought out to fry. ?NOT crispy at all, in fact, it was very mushy when i bit into it. ?as if it was on the brink of rotting.... - black bean noodles: mushy, bland, sticky, over-cornstarched - peanut noodles: mushy, fishy, sticky - kimchi: very illegitamate kimchi with non-crispy cabbage and a pepper paste that stuck around and burned, as if they used an oilier pepper base. ?in my experience, kimchi is usually crispier and the burn only lasts a minute or two... - seafood soup: decent, but nothing i couldn't make with some chicken broth and a frozen seafood medley... lets be honest, you should only be coming here for the fried chicken wings. ?they are definetely worth the hour long wait, however i cannot say the same for all the other food.

Everyone needs a go-to neighborhood take-out Chinese spot, and San Tung is it for me. The dry fry wings are indeed amazing, and almost everything else I've had is good but forgettable. Don't eat in because the wait sucks. Just get the dry fry chicken and some won-ton soup and enjoy watching Mad Max on a foggy ass Saturday night. Wash it down with some tasty beer, and I'm like a cockroach in the tenderloin.

Even the great San Tung, like many Chinese restaurants, suffers from inconsistency at times. ?Had yesterday been my first visit, I would have given this place two stars. ?The pork dumplings were lukewarm (as if they had taken pre-cooked, refrigerated ones and reheated them by dipping them briefly in boiling water), the beef noodle soup had a slightly fishy taste to it (didn't clean the pot from the previous dish), and the pot-stickers were soaking in oil without actually having crisp bottoms. ?San Tung can do better. ?No deductions for now since I'm sure yesterday's experience was a fluke.

I wish I could give this place 4.5 stars, but sadly yelp won't allow me to. I came to this place with my 2 of friends, (one of them being Larry Y.) this past Friday night. We came here around 6:45pm and the place was packed! To be on their waiting list for the next table, they have this whiteboard next to the door where you put your name and number of guests. I was number 10, and I thought I would've had to wait for more than an hour since the place is so small. But to my surprise, I was wrong. I got seated at 7:15 which was not too bad of a wait. Only 30 minutes for 9 tables in front of me? That's what's up ! On to the food. My friends and I ordered 4 plates: Dried Fried Chicken Wings, Garlic Chicken, Black Mushrooms with Beancurds (Tofu), and Nao Jin Mein (Sorry, don't know what it is in English, but it's noodles for the non chinese speakers ) The tofu was rather "interesting" tasting for some reason. Now, don't get me wrong, I'm Chinese and I eat a lot of tofu. But that tofu I just ate, was probably one of the worst I ever had. I don't know if it's because I have "higher" standards for it, but it just wasn't good for me. ?Is that where the -1 (or the should be -0.5) star came from? Unfortunately, yes. But why did it still get the high rating it did? Because of 4 words: DRIED FRIED CHICKEN WINGS. That chicken is seriously RIDICULOUSLY good. I don't know what they put in it, but wow is it amazing. It's pretty much beyond addicting so here's your WARNING. The other food? Very very good. In the end: Come HERE ! It's a bit pricey for an Asian restaurant, but it will be worth it. Other Stuff: - Good Service, Staff are friendly - Parking may be hard - BE CAREFUL OF THE WAITING LIST. YOU HAVE TO WATCH OUT FOR WHO"S ON TOP AND BELOW YOU ON THE WAITING LIST. WITHIN MY 30 MINUTES OF WAITING, I SAW 3 PEOPLE TRYING TO CHEAT THE LIST BY ADDING THEIR NAMES IN BETWEEN TWO PEOPLE WHO'S BEEN WAITING FOR JUST AS LONG AS ME P.S. Know anybody who's a drug addict? Bring them here and give them these chickens, and they'll end their addiction with that and become addicted to this. ( it's healthier too ! ) haha. That's how good I think their Dried Fried Chickens are. hahaa

After eating here coutless times, Ive realized that I only like a few of their menu items: ?dry fried chicken, mu-shu veggies, dumplings and potstickers. ?Everything else is just goopy and greasy. ?The black sauce noodles with seafood is the worst dish (not even hot water could wash that mess of black cornstarch off the plate if it tried) and following close behind is the peanut sauce noodles. ?goop goop poop and what a horrible combination....peanut butter with seafood! ? Although they have some really great dishes, Im banning this place mainly because of the rude waiters and the fact that something is always missing when I order take out and if you call to let them know, they dont refund you, they just put your name on a list along with countless other peoples names and tell you they'll give you another one the next time your order. Oh and BTW Golden Rice Bowl (GRB) which is across the street is worth giving a shot. ?Its super clean and cozy and they have equally as good dry fried everything just like ST, clay pot dishes, quick and friendly service and each dish costs about a $1-$2 less that ST. ?They give as much complimentary fried won ton skins and sweet and sour sauce as you want to start and offer brown rice. I went to GRB last week and their score card rating was 100. ?Even more of a reason to check them out!

Not being a big fan of Chinese food, I really like San Tung. Granted it can be a hit or miss with some of the dishes, but I don't think you can go wrong with the dry, fried chicken wings. The hot and sour soup is excellent, so delicious on a cold day. This place gets very busy with long waits, but if you go, I suggest a late lunch (1:30-2pm) or an early dinner (5-5:30pm). They have quick and efficient service, they do take out and they have large round tables for large parties of up to 12 (they take reservations for 5 or more). Make sure you don't park in the neighbors driveways, even for a pick up. I think the neighbors pay a tow truck to wait around the corner ?for people who dare.

Every time I'm back home in the city, I have to go here to eat: potstickers, DRY fried chicken WINGS, and green beans! They're just SO GOOD! the potstickers don't taste like your average at all, i think the wrapper is slightly thicker and just the texture is amazing. It can be hot though so don't burn your tongue! The dry friend chicken wings just have the best sauce and is my favorite dish at the place. I remember when their sister restaurant SO was still open down the street they made mushrooms with the same sauce, it was amazing too. You have to try it, I'm not sure how to describe it, but be confident that you will love it! There is ALWAYS a wait, so be prepared. :] ENJOY!

We have three words to describe this gem of the inner sunset: CRACK-COCAINE CHICKEN!! Walk in, plant your buns down on those vinyl seats and take a close look around you. ?Really, look closely at what others are eating and you'll see a plate of orange colored chicken wings at every goddamned table! ?"What the hell is going on!" runs through your mind. ?Could everyone who walks through the door suddenly succumb to a Chinese/Korean brain-washing? ?Simply put, yes. The glazed, orange-like chicken substance is officially called the "dry-fried chicken wings" on the menu and as others have described on this fine forum, it is the essence and soul of this restaurant. ?It is so damn good, that it will make you forget how good everything else is on the menu. ?That's right, you won't even recall how good the noodles in peanut sauce, spinach with bean threads, or pork dumplings are. ?My colleague and I are painfully close to isolating the addictive substance the chefs are putting in the chicken. ?Believe you me, when we crack this nefarious code, San Tung will be out of business. ?Until then, the only place to experience the "euphoria" is tucked away in the inner sunset. ?Why only 4 stars? ?Let's face it, the decor (or lack of it) prevents this from being a perfect review. ?In fact, I think the grease stain on the ceiling over table 3 was caused by me over 4 years ago!

I finally came here after I have been dying to try it. I am so glad that they were open on Easter weekend because the Irving area was kinda dead due to the holiday. But anyways The restaurant was PACKED! So my date and I waited about 30 minutes until we finally got seated. Kimchee and tea came to us. It took us a while to flag down a waiter to take our order. Got the wet dry fried chicken diced with mushrooms and jia xiong mein, the black bean sauce noodles. Delicious ass chicken.

I've had this place bookmarked since March! Last Thursday after nannying nearby in San Francisco I got the chance to actually go here. After work I stopped by with the boyfriend around 2pm, and it was PACKED! 10 or so tables, people sharing the big tables and there was a line. Every table there had fried chicken so I thought the rumors are true. This place must have so pretty good chicken. The boyfriend and I ordered the dry fried chicken (which was weird because it's a little wet) and my god party in the mouth. It put to shame most of the fried chicken I've ever eaten! One reason I liked this place is because everything is fast, the service is fast and the servers were pretty damn nice.

One things for sure, they have the best chicken wings everrrrrr! Everyone raves about them(: i've been here a hand full of times within the past 2 months & Everyone I brought here are Always wanting to go back. Their sautéed string beans, pot stickers and noodles with peanut sauce are Bomb! Food comes out super quick and they give you a plate of their homemade kimchi for an appetizer! Warning: its superrr spicy. So If you're a fan of spicy food, kudos! This place is always packed around dinner time. So make sure you get there early! Unless you dont mind waiting a good 30 - 45 min =]

Go here, and order the dry chicken wings and dry green beans! That's what's up. Have to admit, I was skeptical when we arrived. There was a pretty long wait, it looked divish, and not in a good way. If friends hadn't dragged me along, one look and I'd have been off like a prom dress.Not sure why the dry chicken wings are called "dry." They're a little sticky, a little sweet, and leave you fiending for more for days! The prices are super reasonable, portions are great. If you want super attentive service, that's not what this experience is about - you'll get fed and waited on when they decide. But you just have to appreciate the experience for what it is, it's so worth it!

San Tung deserves five million stars for MSG-free flavor and freshness (repeat after me: dry fried string beans with tofu added), but I only gave it four since it's virtually impossible to get a table because they don't take reservations and the secret's out. I'm cool with that since I live in the neighborhood and just treat it like a takeout joint. The food is truly to die for. OK, I have to stop writing now since I'm salivating. I knew I got this keyboard cover for a reason...

Out of towner here from Florida. One food I love most is chinese food (American style). I decided to search for chinese in SF then I filtered by highest rating and I was brought here. The food was amazing (had the garlic chicken with spring rolls and pork fried rice) and the service was spectacular! $9 for the entree, $6 for the rolls and rice also was $6. Reasonably priced and hearty portions.. Overall with the quality, service, and prices I highly recommend going!

following the trend of my reviews falling into 3 categories... 1. lunch spots in the FiDi (my work) 2. places near my new house 3. places to drink and party... this is a category #2 (you probably guessed that since it isn't either of the other 2 categories for sure).... this is a very, very close place to eat to where i live. ?maybe the closest. ?but geez, i do NOT get this place. ?why oh why is it SOO crowded, packed, jammed, over-full, long lines CONSTANTLY. ?sunday at 7pm? ?30 minute wait for a table. ?thursday at 6pm? ?so busy they don't even bother answering their phone for pick-up orders! ?what is the deal? are they giving away gold with the food or something. ?i usually do pickup from this place since it's only about a block from my house and the food is good, i will say that. ?but is it THAT good? ?i don't think so. ?i'll give it 4 stars because i'm a generous, likable guy that tries to see the positive side but this is really a 3.5 star type of place. ? food is good. ?i ordered some spicy tofu soup concoction, some fried rice combination thingy, along with the pork dumpling (which i thought were actually pretty stellar). ?i've gotten take-out from here maybe 5-10 times before. ?you need to watch out for the wait - sometimes, it's so busy inside that they will take 45 minutes to make your food. ?plus, you should have a backup plan in place because (as stated previously) sometimes they don't even bother to answer the phone - even though you had just driven by and seen the lines outside. anyway, just saying: place is good. ?but is it that much better than other places in the area? ?um, i don't think so. ?i think maybe it's a traditional place for chinese people to take their entire families and since it's cheap, they keep going back week after week. very very busy!

Pure-taste-bud-joy is what I experienced eating at San Tung. I came across a review one day on Yelp when I was supposed to have Chinese food with a friend for dinner. I smartly checked out the other reviews and found what dishes were the best. We loooorved the food and I went back by myself yesterday for a late lunch. Everyone's recommendations were spot on, thanks Yelpers! I've eaten the following items: 1) Shrimp and Leek Dumplings ($7.25). Delish. 2) Five Spice Beef Soup Noodles ($8.50) I am a fan of pho (with beef and tendons) - and this soup was fantastic, but not the same flavors as the Vietnamese version. The slices of beef are perfection and the 5-spice broth, noodles and spinach are great. It's a big bowl of soup! 3) Dry Fried Chicken Wings ($9.00) Orgasmic. Universally appealing, everyone on earth would scarf this dish down. 4) San Tung House Shrimps, whole ($16.00). Excellent. I love shrimp with the heads on, but many restaurants don't use 'em because they have to be fresh otherwise an enzyme from the head leaks into the body and makes the meat mushy. I eat the whole shrimp, head, skins, tails and everything - I do NOT peel them. 5) Dry Fried Flounder Fillet ($12.50). Heaven. Same as the chicken wings, but with flounder and lots easier to eat. 6) Spinach With Bean Threads ($7.50). Very good. The food is fantastic and it's true, you MUST get the Dry Fried Chicken Wings! I will have to try the Dried Sauteed String Beans next time. Seriously San Tung is great. The kim chee at the beginning surprised me so I asked the waiter at the end of my meal what region of China this food was from. He seemed confused by my question and said it's Chinese and Korean food. Now I've seen another Yelper who described the food as the kind of Chinese food you would eat in Korea. Well, I LOVE Korean food, so I guess that's why San Tung Chinese Restaurant was such a good fit for me. I highly recommend it. Yum.

I can't believe it has taken me THIS loooooooong to write a review. Anyway, here goes... I FREAKIN LOVE THIS PLACE! I don't care or mind the wait is almost always out the door and their "waiting area" is pitiful. I don't mind that I'm almost always paranoid someone will erase my name off the dry-erase board waiting list thingy. All good things come to those who wait, right? (nod your heads in agreement) And who really cares that you can see the wait staff "clean" your table in less than 2 seconds and it's still wet with god knows what when you sit down? You came and waited like EVERYONE else for the food, right? Ok, the deeeeeeeeeeep fried chicken smothered in sticky, sweet, garlicky sauce is a must have. It's obvious that dish sells well because every table gets it (seriously). The dry fried green beans are also a must have as evident by how many other tables order that also. Besides the chicken and green bean must have, try their dumplings! It's especially satisfying after having waited out in the cold. I personally love the shrimp and leeks dumplings. They're not skimpy on the filling and the dumpling wrap isn't hard and tough. I'm also a fan of their pork and pickled vegetable noodle soup. The portion is big enough for 2 people and it's a good combo of salty and savory, the noodles seem like they're hand pulled, but I won't believe it unless I see someone pulling it! Whether or not they are hand pulled or machine pulled, it's yummy. My other favs are the mooshu pork, the hot and sour soup, and some vegetarian dish with bok choy, mushrooms, and bamboo shoots. YUM, YUM, GIVE ME SOME!!!! Oh yeah, that kimchee like thing they serve when you sit down took a little bit of getting used to, but it is SUPER SPICY! eek! :p i like it!

after seeing the line that forms outside this place daily, I had to stop by and check out what all the fuss is about. ?and i'm definitely happy I did. ?this restaurant is really known for three items: wings, dumplings, and noodles. WINGS: these wings are very chinese/korean style. ?extremely crispy. ?the sauce is unbelievably addictive. ?the portion size is also huge. ?if I were to do wings while watching a game, I would choose these over any buffalo style wing any day of the week. DUMPLINGS: ?good but nothing special. ? NOODLES: ?this place reminds me of the great handmade noodle places you will find back in NYC. ?these dishes like jaam pong and ja ja myung are common chinese-ized dishes you will find in Korean restaurants back east. ?the noodles are soft and chewy like they should be. ?the broth for the jaam pong is spicy and filled with veggies and seafood. ?the ja ja myung sauce is rich deep. ?the only complaint I would have is that in most fresh noodle restaurants, you have the opportunity to watch the staff make the noodles via a CCTV or window into the kitchen. ?you also will hear the noodles being slapped against a counter, a signature sound to signify that the noodles are handmade. ?unfortunately this doesn't occur at San Tung and therefore I have no idea if the noodles are truly handmade in house. overall this restaurant is great. ?food is cheap and tasty. ?the line moves somewhat quickly as long as you're not a large group. ?parking is horrendous in the area but its SF, its expected. ?I would highly recommend to anyone seeking good asian noodles and wings.

I love a good lunch special! I came here for a solo lunch to try their famous dry fried chicken and had to share a table with two other parties. I was a little displeased that strangers would see me eating chicken wings with a fork like a wimp. However, this was forgotten when the food arrived. Yes, the dry fried chicken wings are indeed as good as everyone says. The lunch special came with 6 wings, a plate of spicy kim chi, a small bowl of soup, steamed rice, and a pot of tea--all for $7-8.

My family and I have been frequenting this place since it first opened, long before the chicken wing phenomenon that catapulted it to mass yelp acclaim. Although the chicken wings are freakin' delicious and deserve every bit of praise and recognition they've received, it's the special hand-pulled noodles after which the restaurant is named that keep us coming back for more (and in my case, craving it 24/7). If you love noodles -- stir-fried, in soups, or slathered in sauce, whatever venue you prefer -- you really can't go wrong at San Tung. No matter how they're served, the consistency is always perfect -- chewy, smoothly textured, and satisfyingly thick, with this unmatchable homemade flavor. The dumplings, especially the xiao long bao, are to die for -- they're deliciously plump and juicy and always served piping hot, so beware if they burst boiling meaty juices in your mouth! (That's what she said.) Combine those three elements (dumplings, fried chicken wings, and noodles) and you've pretty much got a perfect meal in my book. :) Service is pretty good and non-Chinese friendly (waiters speak great English). Be prepared to wait for awhile at any and all times of the day, and don't be surprised if you find yourself bumping elbows with the party seated next to you in the restaurant's packed space -- the food is definitely more than worth it!

We arrived around 7pm on a Saturday night and I think waited at least 45 minutes to an hour. ?You can never come here without waiting. ?Of course it's due to the wonderful food but it's so hard to wait so long while watching others enjoy their meals. We ordered the pork dumplings, five spice duck noodle soup, dry fried boneless chicken, and dry fried beef. ?I wish I didn't order the beef as I didn't realize it's the same thing as the chicken. ?Should have ordered the string beans or eggplant instead. All in all, the food was delicious as usual. ?All of the waiters were busy non-stop but they tried their best to get us extra chopsticks, napkins, tea, or water. Wish I knew if there was ever a time in the day where the wait was less than 15 minutes...minus 1 star for such a long wait. ?But ALWAYS a fan of San Tung!!!

Wow, asian food really is all the much better west of C-town. I've heard many good things about this place so i finally ventured out for a taste this past Sunday afternoon. First and foremost, I feel bad for every other restaurant on the block because the line for this place was ridiculous. We put our name down at 6:30pm and never got a table until about 7:30pm (and there were only 3 of us!?!?!). The wait definitely didn't deter anyone from standing outside like the lemmings we are. But was it worth it? Hell yeah! I'm game for chinese food anytime and when you ?toss in some chicken wings, shoot... ?I would have had a tent sent up in a minute. Anyway, the dried fried chicken wings are awesome. Double order next time for sure! The pork dumplings are an awesome start to the meal. The green beans were good too. The black bean noodles were lacking in flavor and served more as a filler then anything else. Drawbacks? The wait was ridiculous. Maybe wait till after the geriatric dinner crowd is done. The line was more reasonable at about 8:30pm... basically after all the families pack it up and head home. And the restaurant isn't anything special so take out would be a great option as well!

I honestly do NOT get why the ratings for this place have been sky high? I went here last night with two friends of mine, who were on the hunt for taiwanese style beef noodles... My friend Yutai had heard about this place through chowhounds, and so we were eager to try it. I guess the first indication of what was to come should've been when we were reading the menu outside while waiting for a table. A Chinese restaurant that has Korean translation on their menu? strange.... ?But we brushed that one off. We shared everything: jellyfish and cucumber appetizer, pork dumplings, five spice beef noodles, and scallops in garlic sauce, side of steamed rice. First the jellyfish.... AWFUL. none of us could eat it. I took about three bites, wondering if my mind was playing tricks on me... and after the third bite I finally said "Is that WASABI flavored soy sauce?????" to which my friends concurred. Yeah.... we left that plate alone and off to the side. Next the pork dumplings.... were pretty good. the five spice beef noodle... the creme de la creme of what we were waiting for... was sub par... at most. The soup was just too salty, the beef did not taste of five spices, and the noodles were a bit over cooked. The only good thing about it was the fresh spinach they put in it. And then on to the scallops... WHY WOULD ANYONE DEEP FRY A SCALLOP????? no where did it say on the menu that the scallop would be deep fried. So we were all surprised when it did. It was just a very strange consistency... the inner batter was mushy, and the scallop was gummy from being overcooked. Just overall a very disappointing meal. The three of us were full, but not very satisfied with our meal. It was cheap... but honestly, I'd rather shell out $20 more each for a better meal. ;p

Yes, they have awesome authentic Chinese food. Yes, you can stuff and satisfy a group for under $10/person. But one of the reasons your wait is so long is that they have horrendous table management. ?Our group arrived at 6pm and there was already the beginnings of a line for the full tables. ?When we put our name on the whiteboard, the waitstaff couldn't tell us how long the wait would be. ?We figured, with our name at the top of the list and four large-group-sized tables in the restaurant, we would get the next available large table, already halfway through their plates of food. Turns out there was a reservation for a party of 35 at 6:30, so at 7pm when three of the large tables cleared up they got dibs. ?Needless to say, we were pissed. ?Anyone who has worked in a restaurant for a month and has half a brain knows that you can safely say "7:30" is the estimated time for the last of four tables that started eating at 5:30pm. ?If anybody had told us that we'd have to wait 90 minutes for a table at 6pm, we would have gone to another restaurant and everyone would have been happy, including San Tung who has no lack of customers. ?Instead, the manager of the place (the only one who knows what's going on - he's young has kind of a dough face as opposed to the other thin old waiters) couldn't even seat his 6:30 reservation until 7 and left us with no quicker alternative now that it was prime dining hour for the rest of Inner Sunset. It's a good thing their food is a guaranteed crowd pleaser, because everyone was happy to throw down their $10 at the end of the meal despite the rocky start.

Nobody is lying about the dry fried chicken (dry), I don't get the wings, I get the diced, but I'm sure they are equally delicious either way It wouldn't make sense to go and not try it!!!!! It wouldn't make sense to go and not try it!!!!! It wouldn't make sense to go and not try it!!!!! It wouldn't make sense to go and not try it!!!!! It wouldn't make sense to go and not try it!!!!! This place, I don't know where it came from but it is blowing away all the other Chinese food places a mile, ESPECIALLY the place across the street (ahem Golden Rice Bowl)! And their potstickers are juicy and delicious too. You don't' feet like you ate a ball of mystery........ This is the only Chinese restaurant that my whole family loves. How could anyone have a 1 star experience here? And if you want to eat there, it does take forever, but it's worth it because the waiters ARE nice and at least you know you're eating somewhere where they hype is actually backed up by a full house of diners every day. Even when we order to go, the register boy is friendly, he gave me chocolate one day! Thanks guy! Unfortunately, I get so obsessed with chicken and potstickers that I forget about the other entrees. Hmmmm, guess I'll have to go again so I can expand on my review. 1 star off because when we order mongolian beef to go, there's usually alotta mongolian and not alotta beef. So.....got to double up the order sometimes.

This definitely has the best chicken wangs! ?As long as you order the chicken wings, you will be happy. ?I also tasted the Mongolian beef, which was good, but that was more to just order something other than wings all the time. ?This place can be a long wait at times, so be prepared for that and I don't come there already starving... I recently discovered the lunch special for under $10 bucks and you can get a smaller order or chicken wings, rice, and soup. ?This is well worth it, if you have the time to stop by during the week.

eating at san tung is like going to a concert. ?you have to wait in line for 50 minutes, then once you get your table you'll have to tell at your friends cause the place is so loud, and when you leave, you're all sweaty and greasy. Dont get me wrong. I love the food. ?chinese food is suppose to be greasy. ? the service is fast, the hot tea is hot, the ice tea is cold and the sizzling rice soup sizzles like a broadway show things you MUST order: the chicken wings. ?mushu pork. ?and another dish of chicken wings. ?they're THAT good!

My family has been coming here for over 12 years and the dry deep fried spicy chicken wings deserve 4 stars alone because they are THAT good, seriously. The korean market Kukje in Daly City sells a similar chicken but nothing beats the hot and fresh kind at San Tung. Most of the dishes are alright but this restaurant gets really really crowded at night, especially on weekends and service isn't the best at this time. At times they bring out your food one dish at a time which leaves a bunch of hungry people waiting, anticipating what will be their next dish to fight over. ?You know, even if I went there and ate nothing but the chicken wings.. I think I'd still be pretty happy.

Three words is all you need to know! DRY FRIED CHICKEN! Most people like the wings but I myself like it diced cause its just easier to eat and less messy. I order that just about every time I eat there. The other food there is also very good. My Personal favorite is the Mongolian beef. Just to let you know on my Chinese food reviews I'm no Chinese food expert but I know what I like and I know what tastes good!

Was absolutely hesitant eat at this place based on the external appearence but I said what the heck, never judge a book by its cover. ?So, my family and I decided to give it a try and OH MY, the dry chicken wings were scrumptious! ?Technically it is not 'DRY', but is more like a FRIED chinese style tender chicken wings. ?VERY DELICIOUS! ?We also took a stab at the seafood combination fried rice and shall I say it complimented the DRY wings to perfection. ?One of the best slightly sweet, crunchy and tender chicken wings I have ever tried in my life. ?It's kinda a mix between ROSCOES'S Chix n Waffles and Wingstop.

If you forced me to glaze a bunch of fried chicken thighs with 3 cups of sugar I too could cook up a dish that everyone would gobble up. ?If I used as much oil, salt, sugar in everything I cooked because I don't give a shit about your health my food would look a lot like what I ate at San Tung. ?Everything was tasty but the predominant flavors here are oil, sugar, salt, garlic, oil, and sugar. ? You won't taste any of the natural flavors in the vegetables or meats that are served here because everything is drowning in sauce, oil and sugar. ?My kids loved the food here but it's a bit much for anyone older than ten.

Good local Chinese food. I didn't think it was as rave worthy as others do. At lunch during the middle if the week. Arrived and they sat some cabbage dish down. Had no idea what it was. My wife sampled it and stopped after that. Looked too much like tripe to me. There were a lot of folks enjoying the food and the service was good. I had the cashew chicken. Broth was fantastic, vegetables good, and contained probably six cashew pieces. Rice was very good. My wife had the sweet and sour pork. Pork a bit chewy and her veggies under cooked. We started with the shrimp and chive dumplings. Pretty good, but not to my palate.

This is among our best chinese restaurant. No gong-pow chicken, sweet & sour pork, or General Ho chicken. ?This is the real deal. True Chinese Food is really dependent on the regional cuisine of China/Taiwan. ?The specialty at this restaurant is it's namesake "San Tung". ?San Tung is a region at North East China. ?It's known for spicy food. ?This explains the Kim Chee appetizer that greets you upon sitting down. Dumplings, spicy shrimp, fried dried chicken wings are our usual favorites. ?Been to this restaurant for 10 years now. ?The only change we've notice during these years was that one of the owner's sons left and started his own restaurants and the staff have gotten older. Consistently good food and good staff. ?This place earned my profound respect.

Seriously, I've never really been much of a Fried Chicken WIng type of person, but after hearing all the raving reviews about San Tung's Dry Fried Chicken Wings, I figured that we gotta try these little babies out. Thank yelp, that we did...because they are absolutely delicious. Sure, they might be just "ordinary" chicken wings, but its the sauce that makes it so addictive. We've probably come to San Tung about four or five times in the past month, and every time our order always includes the Dry Chicken Wings. Let's see...other items we've ordered were the Black Bean Sauce noodles (both wet and dry--would recommend getting the dry), sauteed string beans, and everything (seafood, vegetables, beef) chow-mien. ?The dry black bean sauce noodles has the perfect ratio of sauce and noodles! Only thing I would really complain about would be how little the amount of vegetables it had....but nevertheless, it still tasted fantastic. The worse thing is to finish a bowl of black bean sauce noodles with black sauce allll over your face...and realizing how dissatisfying it was. However, San Tung won't disappoint you, and you'll be happy to be covered in black sauce. The sauteed string beans was amazing as well. They were very crispy and lightly seasoned. You know how some restaurants just pack the dish with garlic that completely overpowers the beans? Well, forget about that worry when you try eating San Tung's string beans! The place is always packed, and the wait-list gets pretty long after 6:30pm, so you gotta plan accordingly. The waiters are pretty friendly, and they're very efficient about cleaning tables and seating customers immediately. If you're in a rush or you just don't want to wait around for a table, I recommend calling in and ordering take-out. Make sure you know what you want to order before calling, hahah, because San Tung is always full of business!

DRY FRIED CHICKEN WINGS! ?Also, the dumplings, potstickers, and noodle soups are good. But never order chow mein here - it's definetly not their specialty. ?It gets VERY crowded around 7 so if you don't want to wait in a line then get here before then.

I am the 1168th review...wow that's just ridiculous how many reviews this place has. ?My dad loves, I mean LOVES chinese food so we always have our regular chinese restaurant spots--by that I mean, weekly family dinners so I actually get sick of it so it is very surprising that I stop by this particular chinese restaurant without the fam. With that said, I usually don't ask people for recommendations for chinese restaurants BUT a friend of mine--who by the way is half chinese--recommended this restaurant to me. ?We got into a conversation about how I've gotten sick of eating chinese food because I have it at least once a week but he insisted that I try this place out but that was waaay in November of 2008. ?Honestly, I was very hesitant because I figure...chinese food is just chinese food until yesterday! ?I've been nagging my bf that we should really just try this place out for the past month and we finally found the time to go yesterday! We get to the door and I say, ohhh great I think were going to have to wait. ?But I'm always optimistic when there's a line because it usually means something good and that people would be wiling to wait! ?But the wait was like 5 minutes so better for us =) !! ?The menu was not the traditional chinese menu, they definitely had a wide selection of choices which totally won me! ?We ordered the dry chicken wings (of course), wonton soup, mushu pork, mongolian beef and black bean sauce noodles with seafood (it was the 2nd one on the list in the noodle section). ?I thought they were all good choices...the chicken wings were suuuuper good. ?A couple years ago I went to Hawaii and had garlic chicken and these wings were so comparable to it--it was unbelievable! I have been searching hi and low for chicken that compared to it and I am so glad that I have found it! The mushu pork was just okay, the wonton soup was good, the mongolian beef is hands down (anywhere) good and the black bean sauce noodles was definitely different. ?I think it said that the noodles were homemade (?) well whatever it was...it was deeeeelicious! I saw a lot of tables with dumplings and I'm going to try it next time! ?My friend suggested that I get the deep fried flounder and I think that will be on my table next time as well. ?I will be going back here very very soon. ?Let's not spread the word on how good this place is too fast, otherwise it will be very difficult to get a table the next time. Heehee! ?I want all the good food to myself! lol But honestly, if you are reading my review right at this moment...JUST GO! ?YOU WILL NOT BE DISAPPOINTED! ?Maybe I should tell my dad about this place so that it can be a weekly trip here! LOL...But trust me, Chinese people know what is good food and my friend was definitely RIGHT! Thanks D!

Really good Chinese food. Black bean noodles were tops. Fried chicken is usually good, and this was a bit above the norm. Scallops were of good quality, though a bit bland. Dumplings were fresh, though I missed some kind of dipping sauce. Plentiful good tea. Overall, very good.

Getting great recommendations from friends and reading the reviews on yelp I had to stop by this spot. The thing everyone says to try is the dry chicken wings. I also saw reviews on the pork dumplings, but those were just mediocre. ?I also got the black bean paste noodles. It was not tasty as it looked. The 3rd dish we ordered was the mongolian beef and that was nowhere near the best I've had. The main dish which I made sure to order two orders of was the Dry chicken wings. Everyone in that place made sure to order a plate of that. If I ever do come here that would be the only thing I order.

A friend of mind wanted to go here so we can try out the Dried fried chicken wings and cross it off the 7x7 list hahaha and the results were YAY I'm a fan, so it lives up to it's name. The only bad thing about this place is the wait! We waited 30-40mins, and the line just kept getting longer when we sat down. The waitress seemed kind of rude, only because they were actually working and it was so busy. Thank god we came early, but let's see we ordered honey walnut prawns and chow mein. The chow mein was hmm okay I've tried better, but the walnut prawns was good! I will definitely come back!

I dont usually give 5 stars but this place surprised me with great tasting food and reasonable price. So here is my 5 stars. First off, I was skeptic while waiting outside and a guy explained that the fried chicken wing was real good. I mean seriously how great can a fried chicken wings be... well I was in a total surprise... IT WAS AMAZING! the best wings ever. Their wings put shame on all those American wings out there (like Buffalo Wings which taste so bland and so average). We also had their noodle soup and potstickers. They are amazing! Even my mom (she is very critical of food) complement the food throughout our stay. The wait is a bit long but oh well, in San Francisco, a real good restaurant ALWAYS has long wait time.

I like that the restaurant is clean and the waiters speak fluent English. The crack chicken... err, dry fried chicken is as good as everyone says it is.

Holy Isht. This is San Tung #2? Where is #1 at? Anyways the dried fried chicken is world famous, but I've eaten it so much I am literally 60% Dried Fried Chicken. I think what sets San Tung apart from your usual place is that it does the little things right. The scallops are succulent and the fried rice is light and delicious. Sometimes I think the power of the Dried Fried Chicken causes it's other dishes to be overlooked. I think that's a disservice.

This place is probably one of the better Chinese food in my book. I love their chicken wings but I love their dumplings more than anything else.

I regret to say - just because ethnic food is so good doesn't mean that some members of an ethnic enclave don't have notably awful versions of their own dishes. In fact, San Francisco is a hot-bed of ethnic food which pandered to the uninformed and is woefully below standards in other cities ... and this is one of the hot-spots for some of the most over-rated food which seem to occupy the ethnic comfort-food niche. The difficulty here is one of definition. ?I can assert that MacDonald's makes the best burgers in the world if I am willing to place the power of numbers over any notion of taste. ?And I can assert that it is "all American", but in doing so I have committed a deep categorical error. ?MacDonald's is what US mouths turn to when their taste buds morph into something suddenly fat and out-of-shape. ?It is the dark side to the themes which define better American food. ?It is what happens when a certain set of tastes completely collapse in a lapse of reason. ?It's like eating pancakes with that whipped butter on it and then suddenly just putting a pad of butter into your mouth without the food and liking it for a few moments because you have never tried fat and salt and dairy together in pure form. I suppose this is what San Tung is to the forgetful Cantonese palate long separated from it's home ... but I'm not sure. ?It is definitely of average quality and the flavors are that kind of low-class "let's see what just salt tastes like in this bite, shall we? ?Or what about if you just chewed on a piece of hot fat and nothing else? ?Is it good? ?Hmmm, well sort of ... actually it's very good in the way that eating a buck of chocolate is ... if you're that sort of person ... am I? ?Dear god help me I ... ok no one saw me and now I'm sick of it anyway ... let me put my spoon down and get out of here". And I'm not talking about me, because I was simply unimpressed and found myself doing that kind of "working chew" to get through my meal. ?3 bites in and it was "This won't kill me and it's not awful but I'll never return here again.". ?Nothing short of defiling innocent table cloth going on here - move along please. Which has me thinking. ?Is there such a thing as comfort food in China, and specifically Guangdong? ?Oh yes, of course! ?Dim Sum! ?Ah, but bad Dim Sum ?has been done over and over again - which again makes me inquisitive about how my Chinese friends could keep queueing up at such awful places when there is actually plenty of good Dim Sum here. ?And for guilao / gwailo ... there is no excuse for liking this stuff ... but I diverge. ? I love Cantonese food and have many Cantonese friends. ?And I have been to more cities - large and small - in Guangdong with them (and locals there) more times than I can remember over the last decade. ?So don't get me wrong - my tastes and culture sympathies are broad and stable. But this is Cantonese palate gone horribly wrong in a completely different direction - influenced more by Americana than Korean I would say. ?Call it "American Roadhouse" or "Small-town Airfield Cafe" or even "Motel 6 After Hours" in inspiration. ?I think I can get a bearing on it - let me at least try. ? When was in Vancouver once, where there is definitely really great food of all sorts, I saw right next to a fantastic Japanese comfort food place a really bizarre Japanese restaurant which I can't imagine could have been good at all. ?I can't even recall the items, they were so weird. ?But it was like "American hamburger meat with American cheese slice cooked au gratin on bed of fries and rice with catsup threads and spinach lumps no bun" - but it was horribly mis-spelled and cost like USD $50 back when the loony was not so strong. I didn't go in to see what that odd little place would lay out for me. ?But I did go into San Tung, to probably the same effect. ?I could see it coming, but my friends had heard otherwise and were intent on proving it one way or another. ?I won't go into the details. ?I've had better chicken wings in a desperate travel moment at a cheap airport bar. ?And we tried the dumplings as well - ?they were like to real dumplings what fish sticks are to fresh fish. ?Each one dimensionally-flavored dish tasted like it had been fried in old fat (so much so that I assumed in fact it had been). ?None of it rested well in the digestive tract either. Now, if you love San Tung and think I'm off my rocker then there are lots more mediocre places for the untrained mouth here in SF which pretend at some kind of respectable and energetic stab at comfort-food fusion - so you'll be happy posing for a bite of whatever your friends tell you is good. ?I just personally think this one falls very short, and snicker a little every time I see the long lines. Personally, I'm still searching for something more like real Chinese comfort food but can't find a real Sichuan ?huoguo ?place ... hmmm seems I also can't type in Chinese on this site ... they need to fix that.

like many, i was drawn to this restaurant because i was curious about the delectability of their famous chicken wings. ?after having sampled way too much of their food one night, i have to bluntly say that their fried chicken wings are all they got going for them. ? perhaps the enormous crowd of people outside the restaurant set me up for disappointment? ?we were lucky enough to be ushered into the VIP room (which was a super cramped, dull room that had one table for 6 inside) or else we would definately have to share a table. we asked the waiter what they were known for and he of course recommended the chicken wings. ?he also said that their dumplings were very famous and i did spot a lot of tables eating dumplings as we waited the 20-30 mins, so we ordered the shrimp and leek dumplings. ?in addition, we got the dried fried calamari and the braised flounder fillet. where do i start...okay the chicken wings were good. ?but i really couldn't eat more than 3 pieces before i wasn't feeling the flavor anymore. ?it is very tasty, but one can argue it can be too strong. ?i personally felt that while it was yummy at the first, second, third bite, it got a little too sweet for me. ? i am basically not a huge fan of dumplings, unless the quality was life-changing. the dumplings i had here did not inspire such feelings. ?none of us wanted to finish the last two dumplings. ?the calamari was super deeply fried, paired with the dry chicken wings, it was too much. ?the fried, dryness was very heavy and again, the sweetness was not my cup of tea. ?the surprise hit was the flounder. ?at first, i was a little turned off by the black sauce that topped the fried (yes FRIED again!) flounder, but it grows on you. ?and the flounder itself was good. ? all in all, it was rather medicore in my standards. ?i found myself eating a lot of rice and drinking a lot of tea. ?other than having another go at the fried chicken, i wouldn't really know what else to order. ?and i'm not sure i would willingly wait so long for it either.

Boo hoo to all you folks who were unfortunate when coming here. I've been here plenty of times and food has never disappointed. Don't go during prime time... VERY CROWDED! Basically you write your name on the whiteboard and wait....forever... if you don't come early (or late) enough. Everything is pretty zip in zip out type of deal during this time. I'd recommend the deluxe spicy noodle dish...nice and spicy..if you can handle it. Vegetarian steamed dumplings are also a plus. Service is reasonable..I mean really what do you expect from Chinese restaurant?

I have been wanting to go here since forever because everyone seems to rave about the chicken wings. And they did NOT disappoint. The wings were perfectly crispy and the sauce was exactly what I was hoping, a savory sweet Chinese-style sauce. We also had the green beans, dumpings, and the fish (which was fried and coated with a similar sauce) and all were delicious as well. I was expecting the wait to be really long but luckily a friend called in and we got seated right when we got there. I need to find a Chinese restaurant like this when I move to LA.

My parents recently celebrated their 30th anniversary, and to express my gratitude and surprise for them not calling it quits on many occasions and making me another unfortunate statistic from a broken home, I treated them out to a fancy Chinese dinner . . .at San Tung. (Yes, I'm all class baby, and I assure you my parents are very proud of the daughter they have born and raised.) When we got to the restaurant, to my dismay, the pouring rain did nothing to dispel the crowd of hungry diners wedged in the doorway of the modest-sized restaurant. There were at least 7 parties ahead of us on the white board, and from a quick scan of the restaurant watching others gnawing on chicken bones and slurping down dumplings, it didn't look like anyone was leaving anytime soon. ? This special evening was not going according to plan. I kept one hawk eye on the white board to make sure my name did not mysteriously disappear from the waiting list- I've learned to never trust my fellow China man, especially if he's hungry. The other eye I reserved for examining the dining area, staring down anyone who was brave enough to meet my gaze in the hopes of scaring them to call for their check. ?My intimidation strategy finally worked . . .45 minutes later. I need to work on my evil eye. Chinese moms are always the harshest critics when it comes to the food of their peers, but mine had nothing negative to say about anything we ordered, which is incredible. The shrimp & leek dumplings were piping hot and incredibly juicy. According to my mom, the juiciness comes from the pork fat they infused in the stuffing, but even that comment didn't come across as too much of a complaint. The Ja Ja Mien was saucy and tender; the hot braised flounder was delicious and tasty. Even the poached cabbage appetizer that came on the house was scrumptious (even if the food critic thought they tasted more like Korean-marinated cabbage than Chinese). And the chicken wings . . . my parents were a little skeptical at first when I ordered them and I had to reassure them that these were no KFC wings. ?When the fried fritters finally arrived on our table, I couldn't help but silently gloat when I watched mom and dad attack them like it was no one else's business, sucking the bones dry and digging in between the cracks to get what leftover meat they could. My mom's only remark: they gave her gas. I was overjoyed. So pork fat and gas . . . in laymen's term, the meal was an extraordinary success and San Tung not only got 5 stars in my book, but in my mother's as well.

i'm chinese and i don't really like chinese food. i don't even like white rice, what chinese person doesn't? i know, weird! i guess i had too much of it for the first 22 years of my life, practically every day!! so i barely ever get a craving for chinese food. with that said, my really good friend bree came to visit from minneapolis and she was craving good asian food, which she doesn't get over there. i had bookmarked this place a while ago to try and finally the opportunity presented itself. i mean 4 stars with over 1000 reviews, how could you go wrong? we headed over there and ordered everything that was recommended: -hot and sour soup - wonderful and not too sour -potstickers fried and steamed. they both had pork, which i don't like, but when i bit into them i forgot it was pork, it was so good!! (sidenote - i'm probably the most pickiest chinese person you'll ever meet. chinese eat everything from fish eyeballs to chicken feet -- definitely not my thing.) -stir fried string beans with some kind of pickled veggies mixed in - yumness! -fried chicken (w/ a yummy sweet sauce) - it was friggin awesome! i sucked all the sauce off the chicken! -handmade noodles with more yummy sauce poured all over it. we were in heaven from beginning to end. even the service was prompt and great. and they were even nice to me!!! usually the waitstaff at chinese restaurants aren't very friendly to me b/c i don't speak chinese. what i love about this place is that everything is cooked just right: the veggies, the noodles are chewy and al dente and they don't over do it on the garlic factor, which is always my beef about chinese restaurants! this is the best chinese restaurant!! i think this is my first 5 star rating for a restaurant! it's really worth the wait and drive over the bridge!!

After years of walking by, we decided to try this place out yesterday. We always noticed the line in front which generally indicates a great place that you shouldn't miss.. Not necessarily all the time unfortunately... This place has very good dumplings, dry soy sauce noodles and chicken but everything else was just OK. The downer for us was the reason the line was long.. The service absolutely stinks. They would have far less people waiting if they actually seated people with menus, not like us where we were seated and waited 20 minutes to get the menus and only after I caught the attention of one of the waiters. (Not ours, he continued to ignore us) Once we got the menu, they gave us another 20 to 25 minutes to mull it over.. The thing is, we figured it out (thanks to yelp) in the first 5 minutes.. We had completely eaten the meal before he delivered the dry fried wings, where weren't dry and didn't lack the one ingredient that I asked them to hold... Soy sauce.. My wife is allergic.. The other odd thing was the gentleman that seated people.. The taller, stockier fellow who purposely pronounced peoples names wrong from the list and when he called a gentleman named "tim" he said "Tihmmie (ala Southpark)... Not sure how Tim felt, but I was a bit surprised.. And I'm not always the classiest person in some circumstances. ;) So, I give the place 1 star for service and 2 stars for food. If I could give half, I would take 1/2 away for the "hosts" attitude. That being said, if I had a craving for this again and PLENTY of time to waste, I'd go back and try other dishes.

What can I say... Love coming here. Don't mind the wait at all because the food is always worth it. I usually drop in with like groups of 4 or less because that makes the wait a little better since they have more 4 people tables and only 6 tables that seat 5+ people. Then again little secret is that if you have 5 or more in your group you can call in for a reservation ahead of time. YUP San Tung takes reservations!!! I've been here so many times that I made friends with the waiters and one dude named something Yuan is pretty chill... hooks it up with free house soup often... anyway point is that very homely place once you get to know them. seems like everyones happy when they go there. And since i go so often most of the time they know what I want already. 5 stars for great waiter memory!!! I will admit that the twins (the two brothers that walk around like they own the place, chubby dudes) can be sometimes arrogant but then again they're young and don't exactly know how to run mom n pops business to the highest potential. but they're chill with me anyway onto the FOOD!!! -the dry fried chicken is to die for, diced or wings, or if you have enough buddies then get both haha... -their noodles are bomb too, i'd say black bean sauce noodles if you're craving something tangy or you can try the peanut sauce noodles if you want that sweet and just a touch of spicy taste... my buddies love thier supreme noodles or something like that but i never really got that myself, only tried theirs a few times n its not bad, but not my style -dry fried string beans, they used to spell it DRY FRIED STING BEANS until i pointed it out on their menu (or at least i'd like to think that i was the one who brought the attention to it hahaha) is my favorite vege dish form them -the pork dumplings are pretty bomb, they have just the right amount of juiciness to them and come in nice intervals of 12, 13 if you're lucky... -the five spiced beef is pretty bomb... trust, they have a lot more great food on their menu other than just the dry fried chicken -they have a house soup that usually egg drop soup or sour spicy soup... actually its not really a house soup, its just the common soups i suppose... they're both cooked perfectly can't go wrong with soup man just add in that chinese 5spice powder and ure good to go... Honestly, this is the spot back home for me... even my parents who are pretty picky when it comes to Chinese food loves this place. And they know their Chinese food... Go in, get the chicken, get some other bomb-ass things, enjoy it talk to the waiters with their limited english have some fun with it man, leave feeling like you're about to explode... its so good you'll forget ure full

After reading some good reviews about this place my hubby wanted us to try this place especially for the wings. We got there around opening so that we could beat the large crowds, were seated and our waiter was a bit impatient as this was our first time. We went ahead with the recommendation of their wings, not too cheap but also not extremely expensive. I'm not a meat person though my hubby is, so i mostly had the pot stickers, and those were OK. Heard the hot and sour soup was good too but have yet to try it. Overall, the food was pretty decent, but be sure to come right around opening if you don't like waiting and watch out for parking.

I have heard so many great things about this place and have tried to eaten there numerous times but always get turned off by the long line. I finally decided to man up and eat dinner at 430 like an old person. It was still packed but we got a table. The infamous wings were on every single table and I felt like a dumb ass for not hitting this place up last year prior to my veg kick. Luckily I ams till eating fish ans was very please with the scallops, they were a bit heavier than most scallops and drenched in a gooey thick sauce but at the time I was really enjoying it. The other dish I saw on most tables was the green beans whichw ere good and not soggy, but not amazingly outstanding. We also had the homemade noodles and the black bean noodles. All were good but not like SPECTACULAR. Over all I just feel like, yes, the place is good. But does not stand up t the hype.

came here for dinner and we weren't that hungry so we only had the tofu and an order of the wings. this place was pretty busy but not as busy as i thought it was going to be on a saturday night. we waited for about 25 minutes. the tofu was fine ...you can't go wrong with tofu. but we really only came here to try the wings and they were great....although i did go to SO last wknd and thought that the wings there were better..not sure why...i think it might've been because their wings were a little crispier. but anyways, i was satisfied here :)

So, if you go somewhere and there is no wait the chances are there is a good reason. Now on the other hand if there is always a wait there is definitely a good reason. Well I have never not had a wait at San Tung. For good reason too. It's really good. Now I am no Chinese food connoisseur but I did spend the first 18 years of my life in my family's Chinese restaurant on the east coast so I have a good idea. The dry fried wings and the dumplings are splendid. They both are a must try. Don't mind the wait. People in Russia used to wait in line for three days for a loaf of bread here it's just a fraction of that for awesome Chinese food.

i'm not sure what all the fuss is with this restaurant. it gets rave reviews here on Yelp. and on a thursday night, it was jam packed, mainly with chinese folks. all these things must bode well, right? wrong. it's not like the food sucked. it was pretty good, in fact. but the one restaurant i did keep comparing it to was Erik's in Noe Valley. and quite frankly, San Tung doesn't quite measure up. here is what i had: - veggie dumplings = skip it - tea-roasted duck with buns = great - dry-roasted string beans = good but MUCH but the best at Erik's - kung pao chicken = no good - mu shu pork = no good honestly, i don't understand what all the fuss was about.

I've eaten here and ordered carry out. While I believe you get less per entree in carryout, it's sometimes not quite worth the wait or hassle to find parking. On the other hand, if you're going with a large group, get there as early as you can. If you don't like the finger foods, tell them you want your dry fried chicken BONELESS. I tried to ask for boneless after the fact, and they brought my dish back to the kitchen (probably flavored it with some Taiwanese spit) and then brought it back out with a big smirk on their face. All that said, the food is still rather tasty. Mongolian beef and string beans are my favorites.

2 hours for take out?!?! WHAT???? YUP! And was it worth it? YES! I had to get he chicken wings because of the 7x7 list- but normally i am not a fan of chicken wings. These were the dry fried and they were pretty darn good. I actually had 2 of them, the hubbs finished off the rest. My favorite was the dry fried green beens, yum! We also got a beef n brocolli and a spicy chicken dish. Everything was yummy so I'd love to go back, but its all the way out in the sunset AND the wait is crazy long! We got there about an hour after we called in the order (they told us it's be about 45 min when we called) thinking it'd be ready, and then we ended up waiting another hour once we were there. Granted, it seemed like it was a lot crazier than normal - and the guy working the register was sweet and gave all the take out waiting pep's free beers to tide us over so that helped with keeping patient and quieting our growling tummies.

This place is one of the busiest restaurants in the inner Sunset. ?There's almost always a wait around lunch M-F and even an early dinner crowd starting at 5pm. ?Good northern China cuisine w/ Korean influence. ?Fresh hand-pulled noodles in their soup noodles and ja jiang mein and hand-made dumplings so both have that al dente chewiness I love. ?The dry and wet fried chicken are killer and what they're most famous for and don't miss the sauteed green beans and shrimp & chive dumplings. ?Waits can be long and service abrupt when busy -- be prepared to share the big tables w/ other parties.

So much has already been said about their awesome glazed wings, affectionately known as crack wings. Here's a hint you may not know: if you order the dry fried wings, which has less sauce, and leave the to go container open, the crispiness of the wings will keep for hours! Using this technique, I was able to enjoy these wings when they were brought over to the peninsula to go.

Dry fried. That says it all.

Oh, and don't forget an order of shrimp and leek or seasoned pork dumplings.

I ate at San Tung awhile, but never had a chance to write a review. There was only two things I remember about this restaurant- there chicken wings and horrible service. There food is good, but there service was so bad that it makes me not want to go back. I remember asking the server if he had any recommendation, considering it was my second time eating there, but he walk away and said he will come back when i'm ready to order. What kind of service is that. I know San Tung is pretty famous in SF and you might not care for my money, but still......

I dream about this place. Their dry fried chicken wings are great and so are their dumplings. I swear they put crack into their chicken wings because I just can't stop eating it.

San Tung is a delicious Korean-Chinese (meaning the owners are Chinese who grew up in Korea) restaurant! ?They have the best jah-jiang myung in SF, hands down. ?The jahmbong is delicious as well as their dry fried chicken (ask for the uncut version). ?Some may shy away from the Chinese kimchee but I've been addicted to it since first trying it when younger. ?I tend to not be adventurous when eating here but when I have, dishes that I normally wouldn't think to order, such as the dumplings and mu shu are very good as well. ?Be warned: the place is closed one day out of the week and is CONSTANTLY busy. ?Expect a line, but the food is high on the yummy-worthy scale to wait for. ?=)

San Tung has perfected this Chinese-Korean style of fried, honey chicken wings. They are the best. Besides that, the other items are great as well. The steamed and pan fried dumpings are second on my list. The other good thing about every food item here is that is comes out steaming hot. The bad thing is that unless you show up early for lunch or dinner, you'll be waiting at least 1 hr and freezing your ass off outside because there is a very small waiting area inside. .

Wait: long wait (up to 2+hours) if going on a weekend for dinner. My rule of thumb, get to the place early (5pm) to eat and watch people wait.. Don't ?get there during the rush (6pm) to ?watch people eat. Food: Absolutely blows your mind. Waitresses already know they you're going to order the Dry Fried Chicken Wings. I didn't believe wings could be that good, but yes, yes it is. My other favorite dish would be the Dry Fried Flounder. Ting of spicy, sweet, and savory. Even though it's fried full of goodness, it's nice to know its moderately healthy considering it's fish. Price: decently price, not over the top pricey, definitely not cheap ($10 for chicken wings), but I walk out feeling that it was worth every penny.

One of my favorite restaurants in the City, San Tung has one of the best array of Chinese dishes. Their dry, fried chicken wings is the reason why I'm constantly going back. The sauce is amazing with rice once you're done eating all of the wings. The wait can get a bit long, and if you're impatient like me, it really does test it but it's worth it every time. Their five spice noodles with the cucumbers and shrimp is also one of my favorites too, along with their cherry pork, steamed pork dumplings, and sauteed green beans. If you haven't stopped by yet, you're missing out.

The expectations were high but, alas, I found an OK restaurant with pushy careless waiters. Not that I care for the service but if I raise my hand 5 times to ask for some more rice and you pretend not to see me, you are beyond being an ass. Anyhow.....foodwise San Tung is good although the food came hyper fast and that's not a good sign. Chicken wings (apparently the restaurant's highlight) were good, plain good, not bad neither horrible. Chicken Kung Pao, tripe, tofu, dumplings....all good but far from being memorable. Cheap, for sure, and my clothes didn't stink. I may have missed the hype...maybe, I'm not sure.

whoa. how have i never been here before?! my dad always raves about a chinese place by my house that serves the best jja jjang myun, but i never made an effort to try. after a failed attempt at getting christmas dinner in half moon bay [crab landing was the whackest restaurant ever. just putting that out there] we decided to get some grub in the city. we came here around 5 and there was already a wait, but my dad insisted it was worth it. luckily we only waited about 10 minutes, and we were promptly seated and given menus. we already knew we were getting jja jjang myun and cham ppong, and an order of their homemade potstickers. i saw servers walking around with the fried chicken wings and suggested we try those. we put in our order and noticed the place was PACKED! thank god we got there when we did because the waiting list filled up quick after we sat down. the only downside to our time here was it took FOREVER to get the food out! but someone explained there were only 3 chefs in the kitchen and since it's christmas, it was crazy. so i won't knock them too hard. the jja jjang myun was delicious. noodles cooked perfectly and the sauce was packing so much flavor! the jjam ppong was also good and the homemade potstickers are huge and yummy. but the real winner is the dry fried chicken wings. oh. my. god. i've never had fried chicken wings that are nice and crispy on the outside but so moist on the inside! straight fall off the bone moist. and the sauce is awesome. i will have dreams about those wings. i'm coming back asap!

The aroma of dinner hour at San Tung is mouthwateringly maddening....when you're waiting in line watching tables turn. When eating, I like to sit with my back to the door to avoid eye contact with the vulture-esque people awaiting their noodles, dumplings, and fried chicken. S.T. serves up a style of food with prompt table delivery, spicy notes, full flavors, and a freshness that always makes me wish I was eating with 5 people so I could try more dishes. I enjoy seeing families gathered at the big round tables and the fleet of white-shirted men rushing dishes out of the kitchen. The wonton soup was a little weak for a place that excels at dumplings. I'm not in favor of the inclusion of canned sliced mushrooms and the wrappers were on the coarse side, but the filling was fine (ground pork and shrimp bit combo). Still, I love the noodles, dumplings, and fried chicken at S.T., I just have to remember to bring my crossword puzzle for the wait.

In search of a new Chinese restaurant to try, this place was rated favorably and near the top of the list. Their signature dish is apparently the chicken wings. I think I had the dry version. There was a lot of flavor to them. They're slightly on the pricier side at $8 but they're definitely better than Hooters wings. You get a generous portion of Pot Stickers as they're large. Some people complained about dishes here lacking flavor. They have flavor, just not the heavy "MSG" flavor that some people are used to. I came around opening so the place wasn't packed but it quickly filled up. Definitely a favorite and the chicken wings are a must try.

even after hearing a bunch of hype, this place still met my expectations. above par from other Chinese joints, but not quite 5 stars. we had a party of 9 and got lucky b/c it wasn't crowded at 11:30am. we were seated immediately and ordered: -hot and sour soup - standard, but with peas (which i have never had) -56 dumplings - shrimp & leek is better than pork, but both are good -a plate of potstickers - HUGE but kinda standard -garlic fried chicken wings - if you don't get this you are a moron. i mean that in the nicest way. they were beyond words -jiajiangmien - i was disappointed in this; it was too wet for me, but i was told there was a "drier" version that we didn't get to try -side of tofu - firm and delicious! -green beans - cooked the way i like 'em! -probably more stuff that i'm forgetting oh yeah, don't piss off the guy w/ the spikey hair.... a HUGE plus: everything is hand-made!

In the past two years, I've noticed that the quality of this place has gone down. Their dried fried chicken wings are still delicious but everything else that we usually order that are known to be great (ie: dumplings & noodles) haven't been so great. I wouldn't drive out to the Sunset just to eat here anymore, like I used to.

Five stars for their chicken wings alone! I remember going here earlier in the year when I was in a haze of feeling blue and didn't want to eat anything much less wait in line for some greasy chinese food. This is a testament to how great this place was or in particular their wings because their yumminess was able to get through my fog of melancholy. I proceeded to tell my sister to check this place out when I hung out with her a few weeks later. They have a couple of good dishes too but I can't think of anything else to rave about other than their wings.

i've been going to san tung for ages now, and i love this place, i really do. ?but what i used to love about it MORE was that it was a SECRET. ?thanks to everyone for discovering this place and bringing all your friends, you bitches. but since the cat's out, i might as well share some of what i know to make the experience better for everyone. parking sucks, plan accordingly. ?there's a huge line most nights, also plan accordingly. the waiting list has no rhyme nor reason to it. ?put your name at the END of the list. ?it may be hard to figure out where the end is, but any of the 4,000 people in line in front of you can probably help you out. pick a name that's hard to pronounce at your own risk. ?last night someone wrote "Kale" which was announced as "Kale-y...Kelly" so some party of 5 shot themselves in the foot. ?better for me, sucks for you. wait outside at your own risk. ?the older guy will open the door and call out a name. ?the fat guy that looks like horatio sanz won't bother. ?alternatively, get good at lip-reading your own name. along with your tea, order a can of coke. ?after you've scarfed down a plate (or 4) of the hot, crispy, tangy, sweet, and spicy chicken wings, you'll need something to wash down the MSG. ?that swollen tonsil feeling you're getting? ?it's the MSG at work. ?look man, i'm chinese, we were born knowing these things.

If you like chicken or fish, this is the place to get something yummy. The chicken is crispy, sweet and savory. Order the fish version also. Order the green beans. you will not be dissapointed. when you get there, be prepared to to wait. There is usually a line out the door because people know good food. Nothing much more to describe because you have to try for yourself and be the judge. YUMMMMY CHICKEN!!!!!!

After hearing so much about this place, we got a group together to try it out. ?I had been warned about the wait before, so I wasn't totally surprised. ?But still. ?Jeez. ?We waited about an hour and a half for a table, and by the time we all sat down I think we could have eaten the tablecloth and been happy. ?Anyway, we ordered a ton of stuff, including the "famous" chicken wings which yes, were amazingly good. ?I don't know how but most of the stuff we ordered ended up being fried, but hey, they do fry things well. ?The cherry pork was a pleasant surprise also...almost like an upscale version of sweet and sour pork. ?Even my "I don't like Chinese food" boyfriend liked the food here (no, I don't understand his dislike of Chinese food either). ?For the food itself I would give 5 stars, but the long wait makes me think I probably won't come back here too often, which is disappointing.

This place is my favorite chinese restaurant in sunset. The only problems are: 1) the parking sucks ass (luckily i live a few blocks, but my lazy ass is too lazy to walk over sometimes) and 2) the lines can get a little crazy during dinner time and lunch time, especially the weekends. My favorites: Original Dry Fried Chicken Wings- the must have thing when there Potstickers- another must have Dry Black Bean Sauce Noodles- perfect when watching korean dramas Five Spice Beef Noodle- with all the heavy and strong tastes in the other dishes, this is lighter tasting and refreshing with the other food Rice Soup thing- so cool, its like fried rice crisps that they add to the soup in front of you and it sizzles and tastes delish. maybe its the ABC in me that goes OoOoOoOo. Decent: Spicy Seafood Noodle- not spicy enough for me, I'm used to eating a lot of spicy food in viet cooking, So this is kinda bland. and not a big fan of seafood.

I love this place and like others, it's mainly for their dry fried chicken. Other places just can't compare. I especially love their noodle in peanut sauce too. Get it spicy and mix the cucumbers in! The dumplings and fried potstickers (when I'm feeling extra piggish) are good too. I really like the garlic eggplant - there is no skin on it though, giving it a different texture, so it might not be for everyone. The bean sprouts are addicting, but the salty radish makes you yearning for more water. Staff are friendly, but also no fuss, no muss. Bring a jacket for the cold Sunset weather. Yea the wait sucks, but you just have to learn when to go. What, you think I'm going to share? :)

One thing I do have to comment on, I took a peek into their kitchen, VERY clean and orderly, especially for a Chinese restaurant. So that's a bonus for San Tung.

San Tung is a great chinese restaurant! My personal favorite is the hot and sour soup, shrimp and leek dumplings, and you must order dry fried chicken wings. Almost every other table will have it. The sizzling rice soup, and mu shu is also good! Prices are very reasonable, and they're always busy. The only bad part is the parking during peek hours.

I have to keep it real. This place deserves no more than 2 stars. Notice how every reviewer notes the chicken wings in their justifications for 4+ stars. Come on! Chicken wings don't make a "Chinese" restaurant great. And truth be told, the other dishes were mediocre at best. Maybe it's because I like to keep my Chinese dishes Chinese and Korean dishes Korean (in other words, separate). Whatever. I've been here 3 times and have been disappointed each time. The wait is not worth it. And the precious chicken wings? They get soggy if you ever try to take them to go.

Food is good. Your typical chinese food, except for the dry fried chicken which is very good. Went to lunch there today and found ashy material on our plates. Don't know what it was. Teacups were dirty. Paper platematts were dirty. Glass water cups were not washed well. They still had residue of food stuck on them. Waiters were not friendly just like the owner...

The dry fried chicken wings are an obvious must. But first I want to say that parking is extremely difficult in the area around noon to 1pm. There was a waiting period but it wasn't that long on a Saturday. I ordered the Three Deluxe Spice Sauce Noodles and that was surprisingly good. The noodles are made to perfection and the sauce is an additional plus. The Sizzling Rice Soup was alright; the rice was good but the soup was a little too salty for me. Overall this place is awesome and the wings are a MUST unless you aren't a fan of fried chicken doused in a thick sweet and tangy sauce.

food: 4 atmosphere: 4 service: 4 4+! never heard about this place ever, let alone from yelp. a friend suggested it when i communicated a desire for jambong (k hot spicy soup) a chilly sunday afternoon. So to san tong we went! ok. wow. i'm a happy camper. i was pretty dissatisfied with the idea of zah zang (sp) on geary and masonic being my only option of chinese korean food. (definition= chinese k food is like americanized chinese food. you can see the influence, but it's an entirely separate fare). so i had a pretty good sampling of the chinese k food-- jah jang myun, jambong and beef tangsooyook. the jah jang myun was a little salty, and then tang soo yook a bit sweet. but together, with home made noodles. it was a perfect meal. the wait was a bit of a pain, but i'd do it again. not too sure about the "chinese" dishes, but i have to admit, i doubt i'll try them since san tung has been now dubbed my chinese k food fix.... summary: a few hours later and i'm still completely satisfied. mmmm...!

The constant line at San Tung can drive one crazy. I'm still not too sure about the origin of that place but they have Chinese and Korean signs/menu, serve kimchee as an amuse and have Korean dishes (the noodle). My friend says the cuisine (north east) might be close to the Korean border I read recently that Golden Rice Bowl across the street might be ok as a substitute if it's too packed http://www.sfbg.com/entr… Yes - Original dry fried chicken $8 - Seaweed soup (looks quite awful but tastes good) $6.95 - Dried sauteed string beans $6.50 - Beef and vegetables So so - Black bean sauce noodles (jajangmyen) $7 - Mushu wrap, I'm just too lazy for that stuff No - Pot stickers, celebrated but no go for me (huge size, filling: no, skin: too thick) $5.50 - Pig's ear $5 To try - Three deluxe spicy sauce noodles $7 Portions are huge so come with people (or appetite). Food comes out atypically slow for a Chinese place Weekdays get good deals (specials from 11am to 3pm: one dish + soup/rice for $5-7)

So- I like this place despite all the annoying hype. The food is very good and everyone I have ever brought here has loved it. My fiance (I hate that word) and I recently had an engagement dinner here. It's unconventional for the typical engagement party but everyone in our party of 14 loved it. Even the old school Chinese couples who normally only eat Cantonese style really enjoyed it. The circus like atmosphere takes away from the experience because its always packed and sometimes people hover around you as you eat if your near the door. But once your stuffing your face with just about any of their saucy dishes, you get over it quickly.

Of all the Chinese places in the city -- I've finally found "the one" (and conveniently its just down the street!). ?Now some might argue that chicken wings aren't authentic Chinese (maybe because the owners are Korean?!) - but try them and you really won't care about authenticity. ?They do a great job with dumplings and mongolian beef as well. ?The wait is long, so come early or call in your order!

Ah, I remember coming here the first few times. When my parents were away for business dinners, my uncle would take my brothers and myself here. The food was good but I wasn't old enough to enjoy and appreciate good food yet. Around my high school years, my friends and I would talk about going during lunch for some wings. We made it happen every so often and I remember just ordering the wings to go all the time. Until I reached college in Riverside, I realized how much I miss GOOD food. This place is a restaurant a frequent when I come home. When my little bro visited me in SF during our winter break, I took him here. He loved it. He poured the sauce from the wings over EVERYTHING. As everyone goes for the wings, I go for the fried rice and the potstickers. I enjoy making my own sauce for it. Vinegar, soy sauce, and chili oil. Service - not too shabby. The boss himself is the one of the people serving you. Food - Wings (like everyone is saying), chicken fried rice, sauteed string beans, potstickers, and hot and sour soup. People say good fried rice doesn't have carrots and peas in it, but this is an exception. Parking - sucks, watch out for the meter maids. So why a 4? Because they aren't exactly a 5. They're a 4.5 but not high enough to round up because the last time I had their wings, the sauce was too too sweet.

I would have given a 5 star if the service was better. They are rude and they even give you dirty looks. The food was very good though I had the Dry Fried Chicken which was VERY delicious and the Mushu Pork my favorite dish at the restaurant. It was pretty pricey though, one pancake wrap was a dollar? Not worth it especially when we asked for two more and it took them like 20 minutes to get it so we had to ask another worker for it so in the end they charged us for both. Horrible service but fantastic food.

We went on the advice of my yelp friends. ?Chicken wings, noodles and dumplings. ?Okay. ?No line today, that's good. ?The waiter ask for our order as soon as he dumped the menus and did not return. ?Another waiter came by and took our order. ?C'mon. ?As a distant relative of Edsel Fong, I can take any waiter b.s., but this takes away a half star. ?They gave kimchi as a free starter. ?It has been some time since I had kimchi. ?I ate it all. So, a great start to the meal. ?The wings were good - spicy, crunchy and hot in temperature. ?The noodles were okay. ?The hot noodles with calamari, shrimp and whatever was bland. ?The black bean was better, but only good. ?The dumplings went so fast, I would rate them the best. Pork and shrimp. There was a fight over the last two. ?We will have to go again and try other dishes.

i'm chinese but i don't really check out chinese restaurants unless i'm with my parents. they're the ones who know what to order and how to order it all correctly. i do, however, frequent San Tung. it's one of the cleaner cheap chinese restaurants and the servers speak english. if you're not coming here to get the dry fried chicken then you would probably not make a good friend of mine. i could never go there and not order the dry fried chicken. that's just an obsurdity. oh and if you get chow mein be sure to ask for the house made noodles. make sure to sign up. there's a list on the wall. if you don't write your name down then you're S out of luck. better yet just come super early or come for lunch. then you won't have to wait or share a table with random strangers.

I came here about a week ago with my boyfriend. ?His roommates and him have been telling me about this place for months. ?We got the dry fried chicken wings, string beans, and calamari. ?I loved it all!! ?We even send a picture to his roommate, needless to say we have yet to be forgiven for going with out him. ?I can't wait to go back and try more of their menu!

Hype. Service is spotty and the food is Ok. The Crack chicken dry style lets me down always. I'm sorry I know I tried to like this place I even use to miss it when I lived in Hell-LA. All well I'm happy for them their always packed. Must be something in the water.

Who would have thought the reason I hit a Chinese restaurant would be the high reviews for chicken wings... I decided to try San Tung because of the excellent reviews and the almost urban legend "dry fried chicken wings" But as Public Enemy once yelled out... don't believe the hype. First, unless you have lots of time to kill you might want to get take-out. This place was PACKED with a waiting line outside the door! My asian friend told me when going for chinese food your looking for a place with at least 75% asian rate so you know its good so we felt good going in. However, let's just say I will come back but some of the hype is not as great as the actual product. We read we HAD TO try the dry fried chicken wings and shrimp & leek dumplings so we did and also tried the tea duck, potstickers, and the cherry pork. There are some people lacking in travel to taste other excellent wings since I did not have a "stop the presses" moment tasting their wings.The flavor while decent was not the amazing flavor my taste buds were expecting. Were they decent, yes but no better than other places I've had and not as good as the wings at Su Hongs in Palo Alto or even a couple of soul food places I've tasted from around the US. ?Potstickers were HUGE probably the biggest pot-stickers I've ever seen and were on par of other potstickers because well.. there potstickers. My friend did not warm up to them but how could you not love Godzilla size potstickers (no pun intended). ?The shrimp and leeks dumplings were also nice size but had a somewhat weird smell. My friend ate them with reckless abandoned however they were my least favorite. The duck, I should have asked for it sans the hair since the duck still have lots of hair but when you got pieces that didn't it had a nice flavor and came with huge buns (stop laughing) so you could make your own duck sandwich. The star of the show actually was the one thing we were worried about, the cherry pork. Juicy morsels of meat with an amazing blend of flavors that really should be the urban legend there. Trust me... try it... its that good. Overall, I judge a place by would I drive all the way to that city to get that food (i.e Mama's in SF, Shine Yun in Campbell, or Ike's if I could deal with the wait) however this place I can get everything just as good at other closer places EXCEPT... the cherry pork.

i've been to san tung twice in the last week, and three times all together. i don't live in SF, but every time i come to this city, i somehow end up at san tung. in the last week i've had there: dry fried chicken wings wet. fried green beans leek and shrimp dumplings pork dumplings potstickers shredded pork szechuan style cold noodles black bean noodles dry fried flounder filet chicken with black mushrooms hot and sour soup jellyfish tripe i think i'm pickier about my chinese food, having lived in shanghai the last three years. that said, the food here was hit and miss for me. for the price, its not bad. a lot of the dishes don't have that refinement that i've come to expect from chinese food. the ingredients are coarsely chopped, a lot of the stir frys come topped with corn starch gravy, and the chicken wings really aren't all that great!! seriously. all the flavor is in the sauce. once you get past the crunchy skin, you get tasteless chicken. san tung should marinade the wings first, just some wine and salt would work, before frying. the sauce borders on too sweet as well. the hot and sour soup was good, as are the different varieties of dumplings. i especially liked the potstickers- big, hot and juicy, with lots of meat. the shrimp and leek dumplings are much better than the regular pork dumplings. my only complaint is that san tung doesn't have wine vinegar available, only white :) it won't stop me from eating the dumplings, just a small anal complaint. another standout were the fried flounder filets. the batter was very light, and it wasn't soaked in sauce either. personally, i'd recommend the fish over the wings. what really bugged me was the shredded pork szechuan style. the pork wasn't actually shredded, but cut into thick strips. they should really call it thick cut strips of pork szechuan style. shredded pork soaks up flavor much better, and the strips that san tung served were flavorless inside. there's also some inconsistency in the ingredients and dishes, most notably in the green beans. i had them twice, once today, once last week. they were really good last week- crisp, sweet and fresh. today, they were not crisp or flavorful at all. what i really loved last week, i barely touched this week. same with the jellyfish. flavorless last week, really good this week. i think they got marinated longer, and therefore had more garlicky, vinegary goodness. the tripe was very good. if san tung was more expensive, i'd have more to be unhappy with, like the cliched stir fry vegetables, that boring family of french cut zucchini, carrots, onions and canned mushrooms (yuck). but, for $13/person, and being as stuffed as i am, i really can't complain too much. the menu is definitely sizable, and with one this large, there are bound to be hits and misses. for the most part, most of the items are doable. at least the food comes out hot, and there is variety between dishes, and differences in the sauces. try to get reservations if you can. sometimes they take them, sometimes they don't. otherwise, there's a line there starting around 4:30 for lunch. service is what you'd expect from a chinese eatery. the one thing i ask of san tung is that they add some desserts to the menu. i really could have used some almond jello after dinner :)

5 and 4 stars for this place? Are you guys freaking kidding me? This place is a 3 stars on its best day. ?The chicken wings are good on a good day, and on the other days it's just alrite, the dumplings are always fresh, I guess that's why those lil suckers are attractive to people, but flavor wise, I just don't see what's the big deal about them. I would say the best thing they have that actually deserves some credit is their noodles, you can tell they're hand-made and very fresh, it's different than the noodles out there. But if you factor in the amount of time you have to wait, and the prices of their dishes, hummmm I don't know, it's nothing to rave about that's forsure.

I wanted to write a San Tung review (even though they don't need one) because in my profile, I have only given ones -___-, don't wanna seem like a Debbie downer now. Anyhoos, I go to San Tung very often. The wait can be very very very long. Go on a weekday if you can. I went to eat at San Tung after school (on a Tuesday at around 11:30 am). It was practically empty; but after 30 minutes or so the restaurant was filled (wtf. don't you guys need to work?!). It wasn't that bad though, the waitlist was only three people long, a phenomenon you will not see during the weekends. During weekends, go early or go after 2 pm, I think that is when the waitlist and the sea of people is starting to disperse. FOOD We got the black bean sauce noodles because my friend has never tried it and the yelpers raved it. It was really good, but my all time favorite is the Peanut Sauce Noodles! Of course, we also got the Dry Fried Chicken (wet) (part of the lunch specials too! So its cheaper!). We only ordered two things as two dishes were enough for two people. A side note is that, the Dry Fried Chicken (wet) was too sweet this time. But most of the time I eat at San Tung its good. We'll see what happens next time I come. SERVICE Don't expect much service. Servers can be rude, servers can be nice, depending on who you get. If you dont expect much, you wont be disappointed, should be the mantra. A lot of times its super busy, so I wouldn't expect much from them. All-in-all, its good food. And when its not super busy, I just chilled and chatted with my friend without guilt that we are creating a line (but it doesn't happen often)

All I have to say is Chicken, Chicken Chicken! Man, was it a delight to finally bite into what every one of my friends were talking about. The dry chicken here is hands down amazing and wonderfully addicting to me and my taste buds. It even has my mouth watering as I type this review. *slurp* So this review is primarily for the Dry Chicken (because is there anything else worth getting at this place other than the dry chicken?). All my friends raved about how addictiing it was to come here and just feast on the wings. So one day, my friend and i decided to try it. ?He was an avid dry chicken lover and i was an avid skeptic to chicken. I mean yes, i have had my share of chicken just like eveyone else, but i really wanted to see what all the hype was about. So we went in, (beat the rush, the line does seem to get very long at times) sat down and my buddy just ordered for me. All he said was dry chicken and rice. So we waited for only a few minutes and BAM silence broke. I was in there like swimwear! After my first bite, I was lured into a hypnotizing trance. It was as if the chicken and i were the only one in the restaurant and all i wanted to do was dance the night away with it. My friend and did not speak until all was devoured. All I have to say is DEEEEElicious!!

San Tung is delicious. There is a catch... it is not ALWAYS delicious and not everything is delicious. But, on a good night, fantastic! TIPS: 1) Don't come here on Sunday. There is something about Sunday. Every time my boyfriend and I have ordered takeout and it has been sub-par, it was a Sunday. I am not kidding... this is a very strong correlation. Now we always joke that every time we feel like San Tung, it happens to be Sunday and we don't even try. It will be sub-par. 2) The shredded pork with garlic sauce is OUTSTANDING. Complex flavors, good spice, unique, amazing. 3) Get the chow mein with homemade noodles. The homemade noodles are beautifully flavored with a nice chewy texture. I want to steal their noodles for my own noodle dishes at home! 4) I could talk about more dishes I like, but I think most people hit on them: wings, dry fried beef, etc. 5) There are some dishes that are very standard bland American Chinese and that seems odd in a place that can also generate such caliber dishes. It tends to be hit or miss, and I think we're done trying to find new hits because most of the "new" dishes we try are boring and not so good. SERIOUSLY, give this place a shot. I love Chinese and it is by far some of the best I have had in SF, especially because it is not overly greasy or "americanized" (a.k.a. de-flavored). But don't eat here too often, or you will gain weight. I promise! The good things here are not good for you!

yeah really fantastic place. i need to go more often, just kind of discovered how good it actually is today, after passing by numerous times and wondering if it'd be good. it most definitely is. unfortunately we didn't take the advice of some departing customers when we were arriving, which was to order those chicken wings. although we did get the fried potstickers, veggie fried rice, mongolian beef, and kung pao chicken, all of which were delish. of course there were only two of us and our eyes were much bigger than our stomachs so we were able to bring a bunch home! decor is very family-ish, as chinese restaurants often are. the place was packed (1pm on a sunday) with all different kinds of people, young and old. excited to tap into my leftovers and can't wait to go back to try those chicken wings. check it out.

Those dry fried chicken wings are good! ?Although they're not the absolute best I've ever had. ?I can say they take 2nd or 3rd place. ?I thought they were just a little bit too sweet. ?And although the sauce was good, it's more liquidy, so it makes the wings not so crispy. ?Service was prompt and the food came out fast. ?I wish I had room in my stomach to try the noodles and other seafood dishes. ?Next time, I definitely will.

Northern Chinese food, hand pulled noodles, dry fried chicken wings that are little pieces of heaven. I love their Cold Noodles and their Black Bean sauce noodles, but some of my friends don't like the heavy sauciness that is the Black Bean. Shrimp and leek dumplings are my favorite of the dumpling bunch. Dry fried chicken wings and string beans are staple. Relatively clean for a chinese restaurant.

I always tell people this is the best Chinese restaurant in San Francisco, and people always interject their favorite place. At that point, I lie and tell them I'm Chinese, which means I must be an authority on such matters. This place pretty much rules, but I'm biased because it's 2 feet away from my apartment and I'm lazy. Do not try to go after seven, unless you want to drive all over creation looking for a parking spot and wait 45 minutes in line. The dry fried string beans are my fav vegetarian dish.

a ride on a crowded muni with butts and crotches in my face, led us to the sunset district to try this oh-so-talked-about restaurant... we were here for a friend's birthday and we had a somewhat large group... we made reservations beforehand, which helped a little... we still had to wait about 30-45 minutes though...or maybe it just seemed that long... in the meantime, we were wondering why two people had a huge, round table all to themselves... kind of a waste of space... especially since a lot of people who were coming to the restaurant were large groups as well... finally seated, we order: dry chicken... dry/wet chicken? ?anyways, the chicken wings everyone says to order... i thought it was ok... just a chicken wing... sauce was good... i'll give points for juicy meat as well... fried green beans... i think this was my favorite... crunchy and salty... some slightly singed that added to the crunchiness... dumplings... think we had the spinach ones... they were ok... black bean noodles... i'm a big noodle fan... not a fan of this one though... i thought the black bean sauce was too thick, too plentiful... it just wasn't making a connection for me... potstickers... another just ok dish... then again, i'm not really a potsticker fan... garlic spinich... i'm all for my green veggies and garlic... but surprisingly this was bland... it was an experience and i'm always willing to try things... would i come back again? ?nah... been there, done that...

The best Chinese restaurant in San Francisco and not because it's close to us suburbans among urbans. No, it's the Cherry Pork. Well, that and the Dry Fried Chicken Wings. Oh, and the Chicken with Green Beans. The Shrimp Leak Dumplings too. The Chow Main. Even the rice. Basically, the entire menu. Sure, I miss the character of No 1 but the food is the same and in the end, that's all that matters.

dry fried chicken...need i say more???? ?of course i'm still trying to figure out the four permutations of that dish, and what the differences are. ?let's see, less sauce with the dry versus the wet, or is it how they raise the chicken? ?nevertheless, i like it! ? i was alarmed to find the string beans being different than the previous time i got them though...what's up with those pickles whatevers in there??? ?ewwww....did the recipe change or am i clueless, or both? ?the string beans are SUPPOSED to taste like the dry fried chicken...in fact, EVERYTHING should taste like the dry fried chicken!

Uh. YES. I would like an extra order of dry fried chicken wings to go. The wait at this restuarant is ridiculous. But the food is worth it. Did i mention chicken wings? Service can be slow because they are busy and the fat headed owner isn't too quick. What can you do? Those chicken wings are like crack.

Although the food is cheap, it isn't worth it for me. The line is always ridicously long (at least an hour long), and the food is too greasy. My face feels nasty after walking out of there. There are way better alternative around the area that you can go to beside this place.

I love this place. I came here for the first time on new year's day with a group of six, and we ordered potstickers, dry fried chicken wings, dry fried sliced fish, dry fried pork, home-made combination (beef + seafood) noodles, san tung chicken, and mushu duck. We also got 1 large bottle of sake. Total damage came out to $23 a person. WOW!!! My favorites were the home-made noodles and dry-fried fish slices. When we arrived, there were a ton of people waiting outside, but because I took the chance to call the restaurant and make reservations (even though the website says no reservations) they let us make one anyway. Our reservation was for 7:30m and we were seated at 7:40pm, which is pretty amazing considering there were groups of people who had been waiting much longer than us, who also got there before us. Also, because it was so packed, we had to stand outside to wait, so I was afraid that the host would shout out our name indoors and we wouldn't hear it. However, he came outside to find us! And, the waitress who served us was very helpful and patient with us, cause we weren't sure what to order. Also, even though I was the same age as everyone else at the table, when we ordered the sake, she asked if I was 21. I was like, of course! And she said that I looked like I was fifteen and asked to see my ID. Now instead of getting offended, I was secretly pleased :) I am definitely coming back here, hehehe.

There are over a thousand reviews for San Tung already but I can't but add my two cents and support for this place. ?This is the place where I usually bring first time visitors to San Francisco because I love the dry-fried chicken wings and shrimp and chive dumplings here. ?These two dishes, along with the beef soup noodles and green beans, are my go-to dishes. ?I always order these dishes when I come to San Tung. The service here is pretty decent and the restaurant is pretty clean. ?The bathroom isn't as bad as other Chinese restaurants. ?It gets pretty crowded here at night and the parking in this area is also quite crowded.

I haven't had better wings anywhere. That being said the understaffed restaurant's employees were rude and very distracted. My friend asked if it was possible to get a few mu shu wrappers for the duck he ordered and in response the waiter said a dollar per wrapper. The waiter then said yes or no very rudely. I also ordered the black bean sauce noodles and the shrimp tasted dirty and freezer burned. Despite the rude staff and the gross noodles i would go back for the chicken wings.

The lines and wait can be ridiculously long but the food is more than worth it. The crispy original chicken?! Ideal. A filling meal of their famous chicken wings and a side order of their chow mien and fried rice-a must. And you cannot go wrong with the chicken or shrimp dumplings. A whole meal for about 3-4 people can cost just about $30. I paid for the food, not the atmosphere which of course is busy, crowded and nosy on top of having to find parking. But hey, you pay for the food&it's worth it. Try it.

This place has a most amazing dark soybean sauce that they put on all of their dishes. ?And I repeat they put it on all of their dishes, but wow is it a good sauce. ?I have been there twice and have yet to find a dish that has a different sauce. ?Last time we ordered five "diverse" dishes; the cashew chicken, dry sauteed string beans, beef with snow peas, a shrimp dish and black bean sauce noodles. ?Everyone at the table agreed that the dishes all tasted identical, just switch the meat and vegetable added. ?Everyone also agreed that this was a really good sauce. ?I'd like to go back to see if they have any other flavors. ?If they do have any other sauces it would have been nice if the waiter could have pointed out our lack of variety, but l don't think you will get that kind of service there, because the staff doesn't speak english, but wow do they make a good house sauce.

The very first time my friend told me she wanted to eat at San Tung, i was not interested at all. I come from a family that eats Chinese food almost everyday, why would I want to eat MORE Chinese food? So my first experience there included me sitting at the table, watching my 3 friends eat lunch. A few months later, the same friend was craving San Tung, so i hesitated a little, but eventually gave in. We ended up waiting at LEAST 45 minutes on a Sunday night for a table for 2. I honestly would never wait even 15 minutes for Chinese food. But little did I know that San Tung is not your average Chinese restaurant. After we were finally seated, my friend ordered some food for us. We ate the folllowing- Dry Fried Chicken Wings (who DOESNT order that?) Sauteed String Beans Potstickers All of it was sooo good! I have never stuffed so much food into my stomach! I'm actually shocked that the two of us almost finished all those dishes, but then again, we were there for a very long time. Nowadays, I'm the one who wants to introduce others to San Tung! Everytime I mention going to San Tung, people look at me in wonder of why I would want to go to ?Chinese restaurant so badly, and then they try it for themselves, and all of a sudden, everything makes much more sense. San Tung also has a lot of other dishes that are so rich in flavor and so good! I like the noodles with peanut sauce, dry fried fish, shrimp and leek dumplings, and much more! I can go on and on, but then I'd be typing out their entire menu!

I thought the dishes at San Tung were hit-or-miss. ?I was eating with some friends with dietary restrictions, so we were handicapped into ordering what I consider to be more American, less exciting, dishes. ?The Moo Shu pork was fun, and the pickled vegetables served as the start were wonderful, but the Chicken with Black Mushrooms was sweet and not too flavorful. ?I've heard so many good things, though, that I'd like to go back and order some more adventurous dishes.

I ended up here one night because of several people swearing that this place had the best chicken wings. So finally after months and months of being nagged to death, I decided to come eat here and check it out. When you get there you have to write your name on a clip board and wait for a table. I probably waited about 15 minutes for a table for two which wasn't bad. I of course ordered the chicken wings as well as some dumplings and a couple of other things. I don't think those chicken wings lived up to the hype but I thought the dumplings were excellent. The service was decent as well as the prices. Overall, I would dine here again.

Been going to this restaurant since the original one was still open near 24th Avenue. ?Great neighborhood spot, but lines can get ridiculous (remember to sign-up on the chalk board when you arrive or get here before 6 pm). ?The food was better before the father took ill, but the sons are doing great job in keeping the business going. ?The dried fried chicken wings are the best (some of my friends like the "wet" ones). ?One of the better hot/sour soups in town. ?The tan tan noodles are very good as are the shrimp/chive dumplings. ?Pot stickers are large, but, if you're avoiding deep fried food, you may not like them cooked this way. ?Dry fried string beans or, if in season, dry fried asparagus will balance your meal (I see a pattern... Fried). ?My mom also enjoys their complimentary kim chee, made with regular cabbage instead of traditional napa cabbage.

My best friend and i LOVE this place. ?Too bad she lives in Walnut Creek now, but i am luck enough to live close to it. Even my friend in Singapore misses this place. We always order way too much. This place is famous for their Dry Fried Chicken. I normally HATE eating with my hands, but when it comes to their chicken, i don't mind getting my hands dirty and sticky at all. The sauce on the chicken is pretty sticky, so be prepared. Their steamed pork dumplings are pretty good, you need to eat this hot, and not let it cool down, or the taste will be different. ?The potstickers were only ok to me. Every time i come here i was order their Cold Noodles, the beef that comes with this dish is very tender and the peanut sauce is prepared just right.

Sorry, but I don't think I can recommend this place to people anymore when asking for a best Chinese restaurant or what my favorite restaurant is. I usually tell them I don't have a fave, but if I did, this would be it. The quality of their food has decreased more than I know. I guess I couldn't tell the past two times I came here for lunch, because we didn't order too much. We came here for dinner at first and ordered a bunch of food (all of what I used to come here to eat). The dumplings and pot stickers were misses compared to what they used to be. And the service was freakin horrible! No one gave a shit about what we said. TSK TSK. My friend said that it was excusable because of how busy they are, but still. Sigh.. From a 5 star to a 3 star.

San Tung has decent food and is cheap. I think one of its most popular dishes is the noodles with black bean sauce and it's...decent and cheap. The waitstaff is usually rushed and brusque (but Asian waitstaff usually are) but they don't mar the experience. There's almost always a line on weekends but table turnover is pretty quick. I'm giving it a higher rating than I think it really deserves because it satisfied three cravings I had quite well: sizzling rice soup (flavorful), fried dumplings (decent) and the noodles with black bean sauce (a little salty - not the best I've had). But all in all, for a cheap Chinese food craving, San Tung hits the spot.

Went in here at random. Lots of Asian customers; a good sign. I wasn't very hungry though. I got the chicken noodle soup. The broth and noodles were amazing, but the chicken itself wasn't very good. I'm pretty sure it was dark meat, and it had a lot of fat on it. Other than that I enjoyed the soup. The service was fairly quick given that the place was packed, and they weren't friendly or mean, just neutral. The place was clean with some cool decorations. If you're in the area it's a good option, and I'm sure there are lots of other good meals on the menu.

A little saucy and sweet but tasty all the same. ?Leek dumplings were decent but I wasn't feeling the black bean noodles?? ?Like Chinese spaghetti!!

With over 1400 reviews, there's not much about San Tung that hasn't been covered. But I have to give its 5-stars that it deserves. So I won't explain it here.... just go and try it... of course you have to order the dry fried chicken. Try the pot stickers and the dumplings. And have a drink or two with the staff... this usually helps with the quality of service. Enjoy!

Recommend take-out. (The staff is not particular friendly, and the wait is usually long.) The diced dry fried chicken is pretty good, but sometimes I feel like I'm just eating fried batter. I would prefer more chicken. I've definitely had better black bean sauce noodles. The sauce is usually way too salty, and the noodles are not great. I've also ordered their mu shu chicken once- there were at most 3 pieces of chicken! The shrimp and leek dumplings are okay.

Everytime I come here the line is out the door. Yes it's that good! Their fried chicken wings and dumplings are off the hook! Everything else I had here has been great too but those are my top two picks. Service is quick and the portions are huge. The price is fairly cheap too.

Fantastic Chinese food! This place is packed at all hours of the day, and once you get a taste you will understand. Great service, and their lunch special is a sweet deal. Haven't had a bad dish yet, and they give you so much food you will most likely have plenty of leftovers. It's a wonderful place to go for a casual, quick lunch that is still quite delicious.

So these chicken wings, I am not quite sure how I feel about them. They are good and the sauce is something familiar but there is also something different about it. It tastes kind of like a sweet and spicy sauce but there's a crunch to the sauce as well. It's like some of the sugars have caramelized. I think this one might be another thing that has become overrated but you should try it for yourself. I think I have been spoiled and I am just picky about my Chinese food. But I would recommend giving it a try.

This place has Chinese food that is WORTH eating at! I usually do not eat Chinese food because it is so oily and I feel disgusting afterwards. There is always some hesitance whenever I do eat Chinese food, but coming to San Tung Chinese Restaurant was a different story. I have always heard my friends talk about this place and how delicious their fried chicken wings were. Looking at the different yelp reviews people were raving San Tung, so I thought to myself, "might as well try it"! I decided to go yesterday. Right when I entered the restaurant you could everyone's food on their tables and everything looked extremely appetizing! There were so many choices on the menu! I got the Vegetarian Fried Rice, Dry Black Bean Sauce Noodles, Wet Fried Chicken Wings, and the Mongolian Beef. My favorite dishes were the Wet Fried Chicken Wings and the Fried Rice. The wings are definitely worth eating and pigging out for. The Mongolian Beef was alright. I don't think I will be getting that item when I return. Not only does this place serve wonderful food, but it is spacious as well so you aren't cramped up trying to eat your food. This place is soo good that I will definitely be returning sometime soon.

This place has been consistently good. I usually get food to go, but the one time I finally sat down, the service is uh, kind of abrupt. The sound is terrible in this place, even when it emptied out I had a hard time hearing my friend sitting right next to me. The food is so damn good though!

yummmmy Dry Fried Chicken Wings please!!! i am madly in love with their dry friend chicken wings! i really come here just for that plate because its THAT GOOD! if you want to come here for dinner be prepare to wait at least 30 minutes because this place gets PACK like sardines! ?if you have a big party its wise to reserve a table as they do take reservations for big parties only. i think the best time to come here is during weekdays after 2pm as the lunch rush is over and the dinner rush haven't start yet. parking here is near impossible! so carpooling is the smart way to go if you're going with a big party. the servers here are kind of rude and you feel rush to order, eat, and pay all the time. the only time i didnt feel rush was when we came here for my friend's birthday dinner and we had a party of 14! the plates here are usually kinda dirty so i wipe them down good before i use them. i always order the shrimp and leek dumplings which is good, also the dry black bean sauce noodle is tasteful. the dry friend chicken wings are to die for! you can either get it dry or wet or sauce on the side. i've only tried the dry wings and like the sauce mix on the wings than sauce on the side. the sauce they use kind of gives it a sweet yet spicy kick, but not too much. i can probably eat a whole plate myself if i was starving! i'll come back for sure from time to time.

What a gem! ?Good thing I came with my family because we were able to order a few dishes to share. ?This is what we ordered: 1) Stir fried green beans: 5 stars. ?The green beans were lightly deep fried so they came out nice and crispy. ?The sauce was sweet and delicious! 2) Dry fried chicken wings: 5 stars. ?These wings were to DIE for. ?We ordered a plate of nonspicy and one spicy and unfortunately, the dishes tasted the SAME. I wish the spicy dish was spicier but oh wells. ?Regardless, you must order this dish when you come here. ?I think they deep fried the wings and then tossed it into their infamous honey sauce. 3) Vegetarian pot stickers: 2 stars. ?They called it pot stickers but it wasn't pan fried nor deep fried. ?The ginger in the filling overwhelmed the entire dish. ?Would not recommend. 4) Shrimp and leek dumplings. 5 stars. Very fresh and came out pipping hot. 5) Spicy combination noodles: 4 stars. ?Not bad but tasted a bit too fishy for me. 6) Pickled Cabbage noodle soup. ?2 stars. ?Too salty! 7) Chicken noodle soup. 3 stars. ?Standard dish. Overall, I was very impressed with the dishes. ?The chicken wings and green beans were the BOMB and highlights of my meal. ? WARNING: The wait is LONG and customer service not the greatest.

Omg, my favorite Chinese/Korean food place in the city hands down. First, they start you out with some Kim Chee that I can munch on for hours. Then they have the best hot and sour soup I've been able to find. I judge Chinese restaurants by their hot and sour soup and most fail miserably. San Tung far exceeds my expectations. The Mu Shu pork is killer. Everything is good come to think of it. The atmosphere is works for a casual date (I've actually taken girls here all the way from 4th/folsom on MUNI because they wanted good chinese!). It is really fun when you walk in and their are out peeling vegetables on one of the tables. It is almost hypnotic to watch them. Anyway. I love the food at this place!

Having grown up in the South, I found it enticing to see what the whole fuss was about: the dry fried chicken. I decided to venture to this place based on a friend's recommendation; a fellow native that now resides in the bay area. It's not the typical "Joong-Hwa Yo-ree" that Koreans are accustomed to, to say the least. We opted for the steamed pork dumplings for appetizer. They looked to be homemade, and were fairly decent; but I wish they had made them bigger and less in quantity. Two people sharing six dumplings tends to bore the appetite. For the main course, we opted for the classic combo of Jjam ppong and Ra-Jo-Gi (spicy chicken with vegetables). I was curious to see how the wings and drumsticks would compare to the traditional fare of chopped pieces of chicken with the bone-in. It doesn't come close, I still prefer the traditional method. You get much more flavor packed into the meat that way. We asked for extra spicy, but it was pretty bland, and not too many vegetables. As for the Jjam Ppong, the broth was mild and flavorful, and the noodles were quite different from the usual Korean variation. However, it was just too bland for my taste, with too much ginger, and they skimp out on the seafood trimmings. Atmosphere wise, it's pretty hectic inside. You wonder if they are that busy, or if they are trying to be efficient. It took awhile for us to get our food (a few tables seated after us received their goods before us; no big deal, considering our dishes were not lukewarm or cold by any means). It's a bit arduous to strike a conversation though if you're sitting towards the middle section. Overall, one of those places you visit, eat, and come out feeling a little shortchanged. I didn't see what the fuss was about.

This is pretty much the only Chinese restaurant I go to. ?And once you do, you will be loathe to go or order from anywhere else. ?You can make the best meal out of the shrimp dumplings, dry fried chicken wings, and the sauteed spinach. ?(I somehow feel as though the spinach negates the fried part of the chicken.)

O M G their dry fried chicken wings are so good. It's better than having a real orgasm. Seriously! Passed by last Wednesday didn't feel like waiting in line for a table. So I decided to order takeout from the menu. It literately took them less than 15min to get my orders ready. I also ordered shrimp and leek dumplings and their famous braised bean curd. They are absolutely hands-down. But, the dry fried chicken wings is a MUST eat or must die. If you dont like tofu, you will like it now. Oh, did I tell you I ate all the food all by myself. Yes mom, I dont believe in sharing!

aaaah, jjajangmyun (noodles in black bean sauce) in my neighborhood! Everyone's all about the chicken wings, but I've always had a soft spot for the noodle-y goodness. (I like how the menu's in Chinese, English, and Korean.) The crowds and long wait aren't any fun, but that's the price of success. (and there's always the take-out option.) The kimchi is a bit off--maybe that's how Chinese people make their kimchi? Too sweet for my (Korean) tastebuds.

3.5 stars... I like this place well enough, though I have to say that until I moved back to the Sunset in '08, I've only ever had takeout from the joint. #1 - the food here is hearty, good-for-cold-weather fare ... #2 - definitely order some sort of noodle dish. ?house-made noodles are thick and slurpy and tasty... and usually brought to the table piping hot, so be careful. ?The gloppy, slurpy, soupy noodles make for some sloppy, splashy eating, but... enjoy. ?My favourite? The mustard-greens and pork noodle soup. #3 - kimchee starter - definitely not kimchee in the korean style (sour, salty, hot, soft napa cabbage) - but very spicy, definitely sweet, not-as-fermented, crunchy regular cabbage kimchee. ?Not really my preference, but they're ok enough to while away the time. #4 - dumplings. yes. along with the noodles and chicken wings, most folks will order them and generally like them steamed; the pan-friend kuo-tieh are the most evenly browned, most enormous specimens of potstickers I've ever seen; the dough wonderful and chewy; the inside really scaldingly hot. ?patience goes a long way in waiting a bit for the thing to cool... #5 - be a regular and call ahead. ?your party, however large, will be seated sooner and your food will come out faster. ?Not that this has ever happened to me, but I noticed this occurence with one particularly large group who downed vodka shots with their server and got their food faster than we did, though we had been seated sooner.

My plan to eat healthy went out the window this weekend when my friends took me to San Tung for my birthday. Sichuan-style Chinese food--where the majority of dishes are deep-fried and/or covered in greasy sauces--is best enjoyed when you disregard the damage it does to your body. So I threw caution to the wind and ate to my expanded belly's content. (Luckily, we'd just spent 2 hours trampolining as part of the birthday festivities so that kinda offset the fat-, sugar-, and carbo-loading.) We had reservations for 13 at 6:30 but didn't get seated until 6:55, though that's to be expected from a busy Chinese restaurant. Another thing that was acceptable-at-a-cheap-Chinese-restaurant-but-?would-never-fly-anywhere-else occurred at the end of our meal when a busboy came by to collect the dirty dishes. He just placed the not-exactly-clean gray plastic tub onto the middle of our table and we all dumped our dishes in ourselves. The only thing that bugged me about that was he took some plates that still had food on them. I, as usual, was the last person still eating and wasn't quite done with the rice and dry fried chicken; but I suppose it's for the best. On the whole, I was pretty happy with the food. It didn't blow my mind but I left very satisfied. The best part? My friends gave me free reign over the ordering! (You could say it's their collective birthday present to me =P) Being my first time at San Tung, we got 3 out of 4 variations of their dry fried chicken [dry-style wings (http://www.yelp.com/biz_…), dry-style diced, wet-style diced (http://www.yelp.com/biz_…)]. Here are my two cents on the great debates: 1) "DRY" vs. "WET": The dry-style was sweeter and more flavourful while the wet-style was a little spicier. Oddly enough, the dry-style came with more sauce, which was good since I could've eaten a whole meal of just that scrumptious sweet sticky garlicky sauce with rice. 2) DICED vs. WINGS: As a principle, I like wings better, but the boneless diced chicken pieces were easier to eat. The meat was definitely more easily distinguishable in wings-form as the diced were essentially very crunchy pieces of deep-fried dough that probably wouldn't have tasted much different without any meat in them. Not that I'm complaining since they were very tasty, especially covered in the sweet sauce. As for the other items we got, Dishes I'm still thinking about: *SHRIMP & LEEK DUMPLINGS (http://www.yelp.com/biz_…): tons of leeks, not so much shrimp (http://www.yelp.com/biz_…); they were so flavourful they didn't need any dipping sauces *TEA SMOKED DUCK (http://www.yelp.com/biz_…): loved the flavourful crispy skin! The duck itself was moist and very tasty too. *GARLIC FLAVOURED EGGPLANT: not quite the garlic eggplant I'm used to at other Chinese restaurants (often served in a claypot) and nowhere near as flavourful, but really yummy nonetheless--probably because the eggplant was saturated with oil =P Good but not super-memorable: *VEGGIE POTSTICKERS (http://www.yelp.com/biz_…): 6 huge potstickers that would've tasted better with meat (http://www.yelp.com/biz_…, this dish was ordered for the non-meat eaters in our group) *VEGGIE EGG ROLLS (http://www.yelp.com/biz_…): flavourul but very greasy and a little burnt *DRY BLACK BEAN SAUCE NOODLES (http://www.yelp.com/biz_…): very intense black bean flavour--a little too intense for me *NOODLES WITH PEANUT SAUCE (http://www.yelp.com/biz_…): not peanut-y enough *TWICE COOKED PORK (http://www.yelp.com/biz_…): fatty pieces of pork with cabbage in a spicy garlic sauce *SAUTEED BEAN THREAD WITH SHREDDED PORK (http://www.yelp.com/biz_…): liked the textures of the glass noodles and shredded cabbage Dishes I could've done without: *CURRY BEEF (http://www.yelp.com/biz_…): meh, the beef was tender but it could've used a lot more curry flavour *SHRIMP WITH LOBSTER SAUCE (http://www.yelp.com/biz_…): weren't the plumpest or most succulent of shrimp and I didn't taste any lobster flavour in the sauce We finished the meal with cake and a very audible rendition of "Happy Birthday" that echoed off the walls of this small restaurant. Good times =)

I think that San Tung is way overrated in a way because of their delicious chicken wings. ?I'm not going to lie, they're very good, but that's all they really have. ?I've ordered their seafood chowmein which didn't have much flavor, and vegetables which were over cooked. ?The line is very long when it comes time for dinner so be prepared to wait anywhere from 30 min to 1hr. ?Might as well have someone go first and call the group when they get called.

San Tung was just mediocre. We had quite a few just-ok dishes and a lot of miss dishes. - Jellyfish: too much mustard! It was almost like wasabi. - Five-spice beef stomach (cold dish): nice anise-y flavors - Shrimp and leek dumplings: Ok, first of all, they were Chinese chives, not leeks. Also, where were the shrimps? The dumplings we got were all chives with maybe a smidgen of shrimp paste. - Pork and cabbage dumplings: Ok. The skin was kind of soggy. - Spicy Santung noodles: Noodles were sticky and soggy. Didn't really like it. - Braised fried tofu: nothing special about the dish. You can get it at any Chinese deli.

They serve excellent Chinese food. We usually start with their dumplings and then move on to their chicken wings. I like the fish one more, maybe because it's fillet and there's no bones. I love their noodles and I usually eat a lot of it because by the time we get seated, I'm always starving. There's usually a crazy line, but the wait is always worth it and becomes part of the experience dining at this restaurant.

This place is good, that's a given, but would I wait an hour for a table? Hell no - it's just Chinese food. ?There's plenty of other places that's almost as tasty without the wait. ?4 stars without the wait factor, 3 stars with.

Definite recommend! ?Everyone was right about the dried fried chicken. ?It is heavenly, sort of like the chinese version of buffalo wings, but better! ?Also had the black bean noodles which were a little oily, but still great. ?The dumplings were great also, but I believe the dumpling king is still Shan Dong in Oakland. ?I will definitely go back to this hidden treasure in Irving!.

We came here after the Power to the Peaceful concert and I was famished being exposed to second hand "smoke." ?There is a long line, you place your name on the list and the servers will go down the list whenever a table is available. ?Is it worth the wait? ?Of course. Their deep fried chicken wings lived up to the hype. Also their dumplings and their black bean noodle dish are so tasty. ?Once they seat you and you order, food usually comes out within minutes. It is affordable and your not going to see many tourist around, which is another plus.

Original Dried Fried Chicken Wings kick ass. Wish they were a little spicier and less sweet, but they still rock. Never go to SanTung without ordering them or you'll miss the point. It seems like 80 to 90% of the tables in the restaurant had them. I can't say the same for the Eggplant w/ garlic that I had. In fact, it was absolutely GROSS! One of the worst eggplant dishes I've ever had. Still, I'll be back to order some of the other dishes Yelpers have recommended. It's time to get yer wing on!!!

I have lived near this restaurant for 11 years now and haven't actually eaten in the restaurant once. ?We've gotten take out a few times (which has been fabulous!) but have been a bit intimidated by the mobs of hungry people milling about outside. ?We decided to go down there early one weekday evening....it was worth the wait. ?Ummm, ummm. ?I have been reading about the dry fried chicken wings....well the bf and I just got back from Beijing and were going through authentic Chinese food withdrawls ?Dry fried such-&-such is on many of the menus in China, so we wanted to try it here. ?Not the same, but insanely delicious, we got the chicken not the wings. ?Perfectly fried and not drowned but enhanced with a tangy sauce. ?The green beans and fried rice were very similar to what we got in China. ?I have had the noodles for take out, you can taste that they are freshly made. ?All in all it is worth the wait, just make sure you go when your blood sugar hasn't dropped to crazy grouchy mode. Update: ?upgraded to 5 stars. ?Ate there again last night, we couldn't vear too far off of what we had the first time because the bf had an intense craving for the dry fried chicken (wet/diced). ?However we did get the tea smoked duck, the flavor of the duck was amazing (just have to get down to the meat through the huge layer of fat), didnt' need the doughy buns served with it.

You know the food is going to be good when Chinese people are waiting outside a Chinese restaurant. ?It also says something when every table in the joint has the dumplings, some noodles, and a plate of dry fried chicken wings on it. ?This place is consistently stellar but you will have to suffer the wait unless you eat at an odd time or don't mind sharing a table with strangers.

I will eat San Tung until I bleed dry fried chicken (diced). This is the type of greasy chicken heaven that comes oh too rarely in your life. Other favorites: cold peanut noodles, eggplant, stringbeans. Eat it all! Forget the rice, it'll just take up room. Stretchy waist-band pants highly recommended. ?It gets BUSY, so come at odd hours if you can ...

This place has got to be one of the best Chinese restaurants in the City. I have friends that request me to bring the dry fried wings whenever i visit. There are also so many more great dish's though. Any of the house made noodle dish's are awesome. The 5 deluxe spice seafood noodle is a personal favorite. Some people complain about the service but this place is so busy its kinda like the soup nazi from Seinfeld you want it or not. If not there are plenty of other peeps that want the grub. So enjoy it and move on haha. Plus i personally have never had a problem with getting a table in a timely matter or the service.

Had the Five Spice Beef/Beef Tendon Noodle Soup. The soup was multi-flavored and had just the right amount of spice -- however, it did start tasting a bit on the salty side toward the end of the meal. The beef was extremely tender -- not dry at all -- and to top it off, the noodles tasted of freshly crafted dough! Plus, it's relatively cheap -- $8 for a very large and filling bowl. The only downside is that there's not much parking around the area, had to circle around a few times before we finally spied street parking a block away.

The "dry" fried chicken wings are amazing! You can wait in the long line and drool over someone else's chicken wings for up to 30 minutes, or you can call in your order and be smothering your face with a whole lot of goodness in less than 10 minutes. What I haven't figure out is why they also have "wet" fried chicken wings, because the dry ones are quite wet.

Dry fried chicken wings!!! That's all you need to know! I came here with seasoned veterans at this restaurant so they did all the ordering. I'm not sure what the dish is called, but it was a really yummy green bean dish in a sweet sauce that was completely to DIE for!! The green bean dish and the dry fried chicken wings are reason enough to venture out here to eat. We ordered some chow mein as well and it was meh. Seriously. Chicken wings!!!

My rating is pretty much based on the Dry Fried Chicken. Anywho, I was Yelping around one day and came by San Tung. Seeing it had 4 stars with 2000+ reviews and so many comments on how amazing their Dry Fried Chicken is, I knew I had to give it a try to see what's with the craziness. So I went. I ordered Hot and Sour Soup, Veggie Deluxe, and of course the Dry Fried Chicken Wings. The soup was mediocre, a little too thick and too much pepper. The veggie dish was good, but nothing out of the ordinary. The chicken wings.. mmm. That was yummy =) ?The sauce was delectable and the wings had the right amount of crispiness. It's not something I would go out of my way to get, but if I'm in the area, I wouldn't mind going back for some more Dry Fried Chicken and giving their Jjajangmyun a try.

I cannot express on how much I tell my friends and family about this place. When they ask me where to eat for Chinese food, it's San Tung only. I was referred to this place from my coworker about their dried fried chicken wings. Once I sampled it, like to sound a valley girl but OMG. I mean the sweet sauce, the crispiness of the chicken wings were really great. So every time I come here, I try something else like the Noodles in Peanut Sauce. This one is also on plus list to order. Everything on the menu w/o a doubt some of the best Chinese I've ever eaten. The only thing I bitch about is parking and sometimes the wait. But hey what do I care. It's dried fried chicken time!!!.

As a midwesterner, I am serious about my wings. Whenever somebody asks me where the best wings in SF are, I look them straight in the eye and say, San Tung. I'm dead serious. These wings have the perfect amount of crispiness on the outside, juiciness on the inside, and bold flavor throughout. The sauce is ohhhhhh so good that my white friends poured the leftover sauce into a bowl and started drinking it like soup. ? ? The green beans were spectacular and the mongolian beef was also amazing. The pot stickers are crispy, huge, and filled with meaty goodness. ? ? However, the black bean noodles were a bit of a disappointment. The noodles were not spicy enough and I didn't really enjoy the fishiness of the dish (and I love seafood). ? ? The eggplant was also disappointing. They use green eggplant, which has a more sour taste. I guess I'm a purple eggplant kind of a guy. ? ? This place is good, but everything takes a backseat to the wings. I guess I know where I'm going to order from next superbowl (if there is a season)

After attempting to go to 2 restaurants in the Richmond that were closed on a Tuesday (!!), we made our way across the GG park to San Tung. Luckily they were open and I got to experience the delight of their famous chicken wings.

This is a chinese/korean place. Run by chinese but serves a combo of chinese/korean food. The hot & sour soup was great. Nice rich broth, flavourful not too hot or sour...nicely balanced. The shrimp dumplings were lovely, toothsome dumplings not too thick though. The wontons were a bit too much not great flavour and too greasy. The black bean noodles were OK...kinda flavourless. The chicken wings were AWSOME...OMG perfectly crunchy and while i generally prefer hot wings the sweet sauce was perfect. Dry fried green beans were OK...cooked perfectly but needed a bit of a pop. The sizzling rice soup is excellent. I go back as often as i can

( = ?not to mention that the sauce reminds me of a dish i used to eat as a kid in indonesia which i can't find here either... ?so aside from the chicken wings as being super tasty, it brings me back the taste of something i loved years ago. ?so as you might've guessed... ?i always order the chicken wings when i come to san tung. usually i come here with my bf, so we would order 3 dishes max... and we always end up ordering the same three: chicken wings, potstickers, and the noodle with peanut sauce. ? for one reason or another, we just end up ordering those three. ? once, i came with a bigger group and tasted some of their other dishes *don't remember what we ordered though* ?overall, i think the food is good. the wait can be long, but it's expected... ?i think the service is decent and honestly... i'm not one who expects top notch service from chinese restaurants. ?maybe i'll get to try some of their other dishes next time, but the three that i normally get are yummy enough that i usually end up here during my visit to the bay area. ?( =

3.5 stars... i would give it a 4 star couple of years ago... everytime i come here, there is a line - which is a good sign. ?they've gotten so popular ever since they moved to this location. ?i still remember going to their previous location and it only seated less than 15 people. ?they've grown so much. ?the wait isn't long because people just eat and go. their best dish is still the dry chicken wings. ?every table orders that. ?i don't know where else you can get the same chicken wings better. ?if i crave for it, i will definitely come here. ? parking is kinda hard and remember, they are closed on Wednesdays. ?The restaurant, Yummy Yummy, next door is always packed on Wednesdays cuz people forget San Tung is closed on Wednesdays.

original dry fried chicken wings. ?$9 of YUM. This one time, I was waiting to bring an order of wings home. Another lady got her takeout order, but right when she got out the door she accidentally dropped her chicken wings!! AHHH!!! I felt sorry for her.

Eating here is worth the wait even if at times it is 45 minutes and you're starving. I can probably eat a whole order of dry fried chicken my self. It's so yummy.

Their dried fried chicken wings are to die for. ?They're the main reason I go. ?The Mongolian beef is good, and these leek dumpling things are yummy too. ?The only set-back is that there's always a long wait for a table, and you can't make reservations. ?Around dinner time, the wait averages around 20 minutes +. ?Sometimes we suck it up and just wait because the food is so good, other times we call in the order and pick it up.

Quite overrated! I mean their wings are amazingly good, but I would never eat in the restaurant. It's complete chaos! Super hard to get seating, you're crammed in, and you can't hear anyone because it's too friggin loud! We also got zha jiang mian (too sweet and not strong enough flavor), pot stickers (meh), and fried fish (I've had better). Overall, just ok.

This is one of the better ?restaurants for chinese food in the city, I think. It looks like any other place so you would never know unless you went. It's funny some of the yelpers like the dry chicken wings so much, I ordered them once because I like fried chicken, but I think their other dishes are better, noodles, dumplings, ?etc. ?You should know not to order lame dishes like kun pao chicken and potstickers if you come here, get some starch, some meat and some veggies. prices are also affordable, if it was $$ i'd give it less stars.

This is a good place for dinner, if you can handle the parking and the crowds. Finding a nearby space took about 15 minutes. We ordered leek dumplings, bbq chicken wings, some kinda wet noodles, and beef plates. I really don't know what they were as my friends did the ordering. Every dish was pretty good. Unusual strong flavoring but not overbearing. ? A coworker said she goes here almost every week. Don't think I'd want to come here that often. The parking alone is a good deterrent. Prices are high but reasonable. Service was ok. I'd come again during off-peak hours.

Not gonna lie...a little disappointed. Makes me kinda doubt the brilliance of the 7x7 List's Big Eat SF: 100 Things to Try Before You Die. We happen to be in the neighborhood about six months ago and made a futile attempt to get a table at San Tung because I was told the dry-fried chicken wings were delicious. The restaurant was crowded, the line was long, and the stomach was not gonna wait so we ended up at a Vietnamese restaurant down the street instead. Half a year later, we finally managed to step foot in San Tung on a chilly March evening. No line, not really crowded, good for the hungry tummy. We ordered the dry-fried chicken wings (#36 on the 7x7 list, by the way), shrimp and leek dumplings (per Yelper's recommendations), black bean sauce noodles (again, another Yelp recommendation), and beef and broccoli (always a personal favorite at any Chinese restaurant). The black bean sauce noodles came first and it was pretty decent. Would I have fantasies about it in the future? Probably not. I had this dish four days ago, and I'm not craving it anytime soon. The shrimp and leek dumplings...OH MY GOD, were a huge disappointment. How can 128 Yelpers be so wrong? They were so bland, I almost disowned the foodie sitting across from me for having even ordered it. The beef and broccoli was decent, but meh. Onto the crème de la crème of the menu...the dry-fried chicken wings. OK, they were good. Five star good? No. Four star good? You're pushing it, but still, no. Three star good? Yep. Don't get me wrong. It was flavorful and all, but if you're boasting the best dish that came out of your kitchen really cost you $0.99/lb to buy and $1.00 to season, then you've got the wrong fool. I don't doubt any of my relatives in the Chinese restaurant business can pull off the same dish...and I'll either get it for free, or at least be offered a family discount. Next...

Dry fried chicken wings. that is all you need. you need them by the party tray. anytime a friend comes to visit me in the city and they need some mouthgasms, san tung is the spot.

not really San Tong... food salty and over sauced... when they first started out they were good but now I'm definitely not going back. I used to like the Tan Tan mein. I don't know what is all the rave about this place but I've seen better chinese, taiwanese, san tong, and even korean places else where. Don't like the parking and not feeling the food either. When you have fam and relatives that can lay down the real deal it's hard to take amateurish San Tong food. Mostly for the ABC crowd but for the ones that been back and forth to Shanghai, and Taiwan it might not be the best choice.

San Tung makes excellent shrimp and leek dumplings, which is usually what I order. Their hot and sour soup (my favorite food since childhood) is a bit unique compared to other Chinese restaurants, and it's a must-order for me too. There seem to be a long wait even on weeknights. When I go there solo, I prefer to wait until at least 8:30pm when the waiting crowd thins out.

this is my favorite place to get non-traditional chinese food. i don't even have to look at the menu because i always get the shrimp and leek dumplings, black bean sauce noodles (yummy homemade noodles), and dry fried chicken wings (why are you here if you don't order these?!). other items on the menu, like chow mein, mongolian beef, etc... are nothing special. we came here on a saturday nite at around 530, hoping we'd at least beat some of the dinner rush. we still had to wait a little for 4 people (30 min at most) but it's well worth the wait for those chicken wings. usually the wait would be at least an hr even for 2 people. this time we got the above order, but doubled up on the black bean sauce noodles and chicken wings so we could take the leftovers home. we also got tomato and flower egg drop soup (eh) and their potstickers. they also make these very good, but there's a 20 min wait. i think they steam it and then fry them gently. it has the perfect crispiness with juices still inside. if i still lived in the city, i'd just order takeout over the phone to avoid the wait. if anyone has san tung's chicken wings beat, pls let me know. i'd like to try to find another restaurant just to beat the wait.

I absolutely love their chicken wings! Expect to wait between 15-60 mins for a table depending on the time of day. They're very HK in the sense that they'll have you share big tables with other people if you don't mind. The service is quick but since they're so busy all the time, you'll have to wave your arms to get your waiter's attention if you need anything extra.

My family and I recently stayed in the Inner Sunset neighborhood while on vacation in San Francisco. ?I'm from Seattle originally and LOVE good Chinese food. ?I live in Phoenix now, so good Chinese is hard to come by. ?I checked Yelp for Chinese restaurants in the neighborhood and thought this one sounded good. ?Yowza!! ?Was it ever! ?We did not try tye wings that so many people have mentioned, but everything we had was fantastic. ?Hot and sour soup was good (I've had better, but it was still tasty), my kids loved the sweet and sour pork, then my husband and I shared some Mongolian beef and Mu Shu chicken. ?I heart Mu Shu chicken very much, and it was fantastic, although our take out order could have used more hoisin for spreading on the pancakes. ?I'm going to dream about this place until I get back to somewhere that has good Chinese. ?I ate until I was literally stuffed and felt sick, and that's something I never do!

Chicken wings were ok, like someone else mentioned, fried chicken with a honey glaze sauce - quite tasty but not the main reason to come here. We had shanghai dumplings, and some black bean noodles. All the food was very good and had an authentic taste.

Quite simply.....delicious. How do they do it? As everyone knows, you can't miss with the dry fried. While the chicken/chicken wings are the most popular, I would say the Dry Fried fish might be crown-worthy. ? We like to refer to them as 'fish donuts'. ?Simply delicious. Also recommend the green beans, pot stickers, dumplings, hot and sour soup, seafood noodles.....actually just about everything.

My sister and I found the original San Tung ( farther up Irving that was a true hole-in-wall that my uncle recommended) and ordered take out on a pretty regular basis. ?The amount of room that was the kitchen was unbelievably small, but what came out of that kitchen was out of this world. ?We always ordered the same thing and when we called, we would say we wanted the $18.52 special and they knew it was us. ?When the lovely lady who was the chef told us she was opening the new restaurant she was so proud and when we first went to eat there she showed us her HUGE new kitchen. ?We were very happy for her and continued to eat there until I moved to Marin County. ?I recommend to all that they cannot miss the signature dish of dry fried chicken. ?My mouth just waters at the thought. ?However, I don't get over there as often as I would like and there is nothing as good in San Rafael. ?I wish Lily continued success and I hope to get there soon.

So some friends and I went up to SF for the day. before making the trek up, we were told to eat at this place called san tung because their wings were "life changing". It sounded really good especially after reading all the yelp reviews which confirmed it. ? That being said, we went with our high expectations and empty stomachs only to be very disappointed. We ordered everything that was recommended such as the original dry chicken, shrimp wontons, and black bean noodles (jia juang myun). The food was decent and overpriced, the portions were small, and the service was terrible. I was with 7 other ppl and we all agreed, that overall... FAIL! The whole time while eating I couldn't understand how this place got so many good reviews and had an average of 4 stars. its a mystery ill never be able to figure out. this place is highly overrated and if u ever wanna go to a real place with "life changing" wings and jia jiang myun, go to Glendale (nearby Los Angeles) House of Joy... now this place is bomdotcom.

Bleh, still love the black bean noodles and chicken wings, but one star down for the peanut sauce noodle. It was way too heavy to enjoy past 5 bites, especially with the small noodle portion that comes with it. If you must eat the noodle with peanut sauce, double up your portion of egg noodles by asking for a side of it for $4. You can do the same for the black bean noodles too.

I went here with 3 other friends. 2 of us (including me) had never come here before. But here's what we thought: - Seriously, the dried fried chicken wings are a MUST. We wished we just got 3 dishes of just the chicken wings. - The spinach with garlic was delicious! - Sweet and sour pork was different than I'm normally used to. It came as a plateful of A LOT of small pieces of pork (but yummy and almost all boneless!!) They don't skimp out either so feel free to order that. - Noodles in spicy peanut sauce. My friend recommended it. It was a good portion. All four of us had a nice helping of it with another helping left over. But I wasn't too into it because it tasted kind of like noodles and peanut butter and that doesn't go together to me (but I didn't dock down stars for that.) - Took my friends like 20 minutes to look for parking. - The place is crowded at the front of the restaurant (it's so good that people are willing to wait--that's a good sign!) Came on a Saturday night. Remember to write your name on the white board to get on the waiting list!!! It ended up being $12-13 for the four of us for the chicken wings + 3 dishes which wasn't bad. And we just barely finished everything (we were super satisfied and stuffed afterwards.)

I found another place on Geary (by Japan town) with this same name.

At my total gluttinous worst, I was eating here at least once a week. ?Now, its probably once every month or two. ?Yes, the dry fried wings are worth mentioning over and over and over and over and over again. ?Yes, so are the dumplings. ?I'ts hard to stray from the "dry fried" anythings, but we do from time to time. ?I've never had a dish I didn't like here. ?One of my favorite places to eat in the city. ?If you've never eaten here, you are doing your tummy a disservice

It looks like it's getting damned redundant to harp on how good the dry chicken wings are but to any of the nonbelievers: they really are THAT good. In fact San Tung is a very well rounded Chinese restaurant (check out their home made noodles as well) that is almost worth the hour plus wait you will most likely have to endure if you stop by for dinner. The key word for me is "almost". I recommend phoning in a take out order to get straight to the wings (and other dishes) and skip out on the wait and crowded table arrangements.

If you're looking for a cheap restaurant for a big group this is the place! ?The food is catered towards the "family style" way of eatin and the wait on the food coming to your table is quick! ?Known for their garlic chicken, it's deep fried in a honey glaze and full of white meat................yummmy, definitely not the place to go if you're on a diet. ?The only down side is the parking sucks and the wait for the table can be pretty long (everyone is trying to get the same grub you're wanting)!!! ?=)

Really 3.5 A restaurant ran by Chinese people who've been to Korea makes for an interesting array of dishes on our table. My friends have heard me rave about the fried chicken that came highly recommended in Seoul. I was so sad I would never have it again once we returned to the States - until friends brought us to San Tung. The chicken wings in a sweet & spicy sauce are about as close as I expect to get to those morsels of heaven. On our table alongside the wings you'll find platters of uber-popular steamed dumplings, delectable won ton soup (none of that dishwater flavor here! though still not good enough not to need a dash of soy sauce or two), sweet & sour prawns in a potato starch breading, addictive string beans, and even kim chee and jao jim yung (sp?) - a favorite Korean dish among my friends, noodles with black bean sauce and seafood. ?These are just a few of the tasty plates we've sampled so far. We have yet to have a bad dish, though some are certainly less memorable. Not a flawless meal, but a pretty darn good one, if you order right.

One of my favorite joints in the city. I'm not a big fan of Chicken, San Tung's Dried Fried Chicken Wing ( wet- i like the mushrooms that's in the sauce) is the ONLY chicken I'll eat! My favorite dish is the JAJAMYUN, the sauce is not bitter like most places and the noodles taste fresh ( I think they pull it themselves there). Parking is a byotch but lucky for me I have excellent parking mojo- usually find a spot in the residential area. if you go around 11am there's usually no to short wait. Expect a long wait during dinner time, so put your name on the dry erase board and check out the knick knat shops in the area.

We had been looking for a really good chinese place since we moved here, and some of the places we've been too have been a little sketchy. We love their chicken fried rice and their #75, wet and diced. and their Won Ton Soup. ?Really good. One bummer, they are not open on Wednesdays, we found that out the hard way.

so, if i was reviewing this place based on their service, they would have gotten around maybe negative fifty three stars. ?this is the worst service i have ever witnessed in my life. ?the food definitely makes up for the service. so we ordered dry fried string beans, dry fried chicken, hot braised bean curd, kung pao shrimp, steamed potstickers and three tsing taos. ?we went there at a good time because apparently when its super busy, lines start forming inside the restaurant having it so that people are standing and pretty much just watching you eat. ?they also group you with other parties at the same table. my friend loves their fried chicken and i must say, its pretty damn good. ?the coating is thin yet still crispy and just tastes awesome. ?very easy to eat and not messy on the fingers. ?it was the best part of the meal. their hot braised bean curd was very good too. ?it wasnt drowning in its sauce like some places have it. ?not much more to say about it. the steamed potstickers were good. ?they served eight on a steampot along with saucers. ?definitely gotta put the soy sauce, vinegar and pepper in the saucers. ?i added a few dashes of chili oil. ?they were very hearty. ?good size and spot on dough. ?when i think of potstickers like this i recall them being smaller and too easy to eat but not these ones. the dry fried string beans were tasty too. ?not too much sauce and it was only fried for a little bit so it still has that crunch thats not too subtle. ?i just love string beans in general so it was awesome. when you order the lunch entrees, they come with a hot & sour soup and rice. ?the soup was good. ?no better or worse than any others ive had. ?it was just a little too heavy on the peas. before you even order anything, they provide a generous plate of kimchi. ?it was definitely chinese style or something because it was not like the norm. ?it didnt seem to be fermented as long as it usually is. ?adding vinegar to it saved it. ?it is also the spiciest kimchi i have ever had in my entire life. ?thats not a bad thing though, if you like heat then its all good. ?out of all the things we ordered, nothing was even considered spicy compared to the kimchi. ?it was delicious. ?the heat lingers on your tongue for a long while. ?i wouldnt recommend taking a few bites while waiting for your orders. but now it all comes down to the waiters. ?oh man, theyre such assholes and they know it too. ?since theyre so popular on yelp i guess they can do whatever the hell they want. ?when they were bringing us our other orders, we had two potstickers left and the waiter commanded us to "finish it." ?i was thinking "damn, my apoligies your majesty." ?oh and even before we ordered, we waited like ten minutes for the waiters to give us some service. ?i was looking around and noticed that they didnt really have any reason to not take our orders because there werent that many people. oh i almost forgot about the kung pao shrimp. ?it was good but it wasnt worth it. ?this was the only dish where the sauce and vegetables outnumbered the shrimp noticeably. ?the thing that saved it for me was the sauce. ?it had peanuts and water chestnuts. so the food was good but the waiters were douchebags. ?hmm, its a tough decision but they get the four stars. ?this place is popular and if youre in that particular mood where you would like some delicious chinese food AND want to be treated like you killed the waiters' mothers, then this is the place for you. ?just dont bring the friends that would ask questions like "Can we get some service HERE?" or people that would act sarcastic to chinese waiters having a bad day. ?i thought it was funny and ridiculous at the same time. ?whatever. ?its not like im going to be in this area again for a while. ?so san tung, great food but i stick both my middle fingers at you. ?BAM BAM!!

After reading San Tung fans' trash talking San Wang, I had to try this place. ?Am I missing heavenly hand made noodle by going San Wang? ? My rating is based on 3 important things for good restaurant experience. ?Food, Service, and Wait. ?I am not going to mention San Wang any where in my actual review here. ?So, I am going to start reviewing reverse order because that's what you experience first. 1. ?Wait: ?I know "Long Line out the door" means "Their food must be good". ?It is a good thing. ?I have waited 30-45 min in front of Mama's on Washington square for breakfast. ?I know the anticipation can damp or swell up your experience. ?"45 min wait" means good food, I was convinced. ?However, I have to say 45 min wait wasn't necessary at all. ?We probably could have been seated 15 min earlier if they paid any attention. ? 2. Service: ?What do you do while waiting 45 min in line? Look at the menu! ?We ordered as soon as we sat down. ?Didn't think ordering dumpling could mean wait 10- 15 min before you get your main dishes. ?People who sat 5 min after us were having their food and we are twirling our thumbs. ?Pay attention guys! ?Busy restaurant means "Work Faster". 3. Food: Finally, it is a good part. ?Pork dumpling was very good. ?We also got Dry Black bean Hand made noodle (Jajangmyun), Combination noodle soup (Jampong), Dry fried chicken (Kkanpoonggi). ? First, why I ordered dry black bean noodle not wet kind? Because I like it. ?I like wet kind, too. ?But dry kind is more difficult to control. ?If you don't do it right, it gets burnt taste. ?That's how you determine if the chef has the skill. ?At least I used to. ?Having said that, dry kind was burnt. ? Second, You can claim as much as you want to say "They serve hand made noodle". ? Probably they do. ?The truth is that there are different ways of making hand made noodle. ?Anthony Bourdain's No Reservations in Hong Kong showed "Bamboo noodle" ?It is an art. ?I haven't tried it but when in Hong Kong, I will definitely try it. ?Back to hand made noodle. ?I have seen making of hand made noodle and I have had it in Korea, and I had a neighbor who was a chinese chef who was a mean good one. ?I am telling you this ain't hand made noodle I know of. ?Noodle made in traditional way is you roll and stretch and whip the dough like a jumping rope and do that again and again literally 1000 times. ?That's how you do it. ?Texture is amazing! ? Third, Jampong was very disappointing. ?Noodle was slippery, broth was weak and not spicy at all, seafood was leathery and tough. ?Over all it was not good. Fourth, Chicken. ?When you go to Woori market in Fillmore, they give it out as a "Service" if you'r bill is over certain amount. ?That is better than this. They have great following here and I know my review is not going to keep them away from the restaurant. ?You just won't see me there. ?Hey! that means 5 min wait shorter for people who love San Tung. ?Enjoy your meal.

Since I was turned on to this place by a friend, I've been back many many times. If you don't get there before 6pm (any day of the week), you will have to put your name on the dry erase waiting list board. More recently, I don't know if it's because i'm impatient, I've been calling in my orders and within 10 minutes, it's ready for pick up. ?I'm not usally one for traditional Chinese cuisine (chow mein, sweet & sour meats, etc), so finding San Tung has been a treasure. For the best original dry-fried chicken wings and string beans, San Tung is your best (& maybe only) bet. Oh, and don't forget to ask for the KimChi if you order for take it, sometimes I ask for two.

I love San Tung they have such unique dishes I can not get anywhere else. And they tend to have more sauces for me to mix and match and make into my own sauce. ?I'm a saucesquash. They have deep fried potstickers. ?Freakn good angel wings. ?Dumplings all night long. ?Mmmm good! This is a sure shot, one in the hole!

I came here on a Sunday (for the first time) for lunch w/ some family who had been raving about how great the food is and they definitely did not dissapoint! ?Every dish that was brought out was very fresh, tasty and not greasy! ?I love green beans and their green bean dish is off the hook! ?You know they're fresh cause you can see the workers at the back table removing the ends. Another cool thing that made our trip was that we saw David Alan Grier eating here and he was thoroughly enjoying himself. ?They treated him as if he goes there often, although we don't think anyone but us recognized him? If you're in the area and are craving some good Chinese eats, go here - you won't leave feeling like you ate a big ball of sleepy MSG poison.

The bf and I came here two weekends ago for dinner - bad mistake, since we waited for 70 minutes before deciding to get take out instead. On any given day, we would NOT wait in line for more than 45 minutes unless the place is worth the wait. Given the fact that our friends raved about their fried chicken wings, we knew that it was worth the wait despite the long lines. But of course, after 70 minutes later we gave up on the wait and ordered take out. The wings...so they're pretty good, but we do think they're seriously overrated. Till this day I'm still not sure what the hype is. Will we come back here again? Possibly - if we don't have to stand in line for another 70 minutes next time around.

Pain in the butt to find parking sometimes. Outrageous long waits. ? Hands down as some of the best fried chicken in the city! Oooh that crispy, tad spicy and sweet outer layer of that chicken is to die for. ?As for all the other food, it's just decent for me, nothing to really rave about. ?Everybody comes here for the chicken. ?SO ORDER THE CHICKEN, though the $9 price tag makes it a tad less attractive. ? The steamed dumplings are definitely comparable to shanghai dumpling king's. ?The spicy noodles they have aren't that spicy, and is rather quite tasteless. ?Basically other than the chicken, everything else is just decent.

What more could I say about this world famous restaurant? I'm sure the thousands of people who have posted here have covered every aspect. But let me just say this one thing, if you're ordering take-out, check the contents there b/c in a busy restaurant like San Tung, you're bound to receive the wrong order or have items missing.

Awesome place. Good food with good service at a reasonable price. This place reminds me of how House of Nanking used to be before the prices started rising steadily. The leek dumplings are a must. I've been wanting to try the chicken wings, but always go for the diced version of the same dish (dry fried chicken) because it is sooo good. I recently added sweet and sour pork to my must have list, and this is from someone who typically doesn't like sweet dishes. They do it so well, not too sweet and crispy. The servings are huge. Even the fortune cookie is fresh. Things to be aware of: The wait is sometimes long, and you may have to share a table (put your name on the board and don't cheat). Parking is brutal, but if you don't mind walking a block, park on Lincoln next to GG Park.

The place was packed on a Friday night. We ordered the dry, wet whatever chicken, braised flounder with veggies, chicken chow mein and chicken mu shu. Family loved the chicken mu shu and chicken wings. Chow mein was ok, fish was ok too but not outstanding. It's cooked with this star shaped brown herb that completely influenced the flavor of the fish. Unfortunately it was an herb I hated. The server was really nice and cracked some jokes. But the green beans we ordered never came out. We had finished eating already when we finally inquired about it. The server said the kitchen was waiting on a few more orders of the beans before they make one huge batch to divide into 6 or 7 tables. ?Seriously? Wow. Annoying. My sister went here on a separate occasion and also had terrible service. Their mu shu came out right away. Green beans came out half an hour later. While they were waiting for the boneless chicken, the server kept coming around and asking if they wanted take-away boxes. Sister reminded him they still haven't gotten their chicken. The guy never returns. They wait a whole hour until finally, my sis' boyfriend goes up to the cashier and reminds them again about the chicken. I really don't understand how this place is still in business when they're consistently slacking in service. I don't know about you, but I HATE it when my food doesn't all come out at the same time, or at least within a few minutes apart. But an hour between entrees? I think Gordon Ramsay needs to come here and show 'em how to deal with a busy restaurant.

The yardstick I use for all northern-style chinese restaurants is their za ijang mian, an institution in northern chinese cuisine. It was completely off here. Authentic za jiang mian contains tian mian jiang (sweet noodle sauce) and dou ban jiang (mixed bean sauce), which were COMPLETELY ABSENT in the za jiang mian here. Za jiang mian should also contains scallions, edamame, and peanuts which were....COMPLETELY ABSENT. What was actually in this abomination of ZJM was a thick sweet soy sauce with cucumber, shrimp (??), calamari (?????) ?and a couple slices of pork, which brings me to my next point. ZJM is just pork, and plenty of it. The pork should be cubed, which is called "ding rou", All in all, what is served as za jian mian here is 100% NOT za jiang mian. We also got guo tie (potstickers). Now, why are they called guo tie (literally "sticks to the pot")? Because one side of the dumpling sticks to the pot and gets fried nice and crisp, while the rest of the dumpling is cooked simultaneously through steaming and never touches the pot. These were fried in oil on all sides to the point where the dough blisters.They looked deep fried, even. Which makes them more potfloaters than potstickers, if you get my drift. This place is probably way more Korean than it is Chinese.. Which leads me to rant about the third mislabelling. "Shandong Restaurant"? Call me a purist, but if you fail at ZJM so miserably, and allow more than one side of the potsticker to be in direct contact with the pot, you shouldn't associate yourself with any geographical location within a thousand miles of northern China.

YOU KNOW ITS GOOD WHEN THE DINNER IS SILENT! My friend Derek took my here to eat for dinner. We were having trouble choosing a place to eat, but as soon as he said San Tung I told him YES!! I've always heard of San Tung ever since I moved to SF, but never tried it. I've wasted 5 years here that's all I have to say. Pork dumplings (dip in chili oil mixed with soy sauce) Soup (shrimp, water chestnut?, mushroom, scallops) Original wings fried flounder in black bean sauce Everything aside from the soup (the broth was pretty bland) was delicious. Big portions. Flavorful... HEAVEN... I haven't found a good chinese restaurant in the city until NOW! The service is so so. The wait was about 15-20min. The place is packed/ cramped. Apparently someone was celebrating their birthday there and the whole restaurant sang happy birthday in unison. HAPPY FOOD MAKES HAPPY PEOPLE. Definitely coming back again!

The best dry fried chicken wings I've ever had! ?I've been here 3 times now so I can vouch for the consistency of their food. ?Chive dumplings are also tasty, but let's be honest- everyone comes here for the wings. ?Last time I went was 5pm on a Sunday and I SWEAR every single table in that restaurant had at least one order of wings. ?Damn you San Tung for being in the middle of freaking nowhere in Sunset. ?Perhaps it's the best for my waistline that it's not closer.

After being hung up on by the House of Nanking, I really didn't feel like dealing with the madness of Chinatown on the 4th of July. My family and I (all 8 of us) decided to give this place a try. We were not disappointed. The wings were delicious. They were on the sweet side but I love sweet! ?We also tried the seafood soup, the house chow mein, the sweet and sour tilapia,which was very good. We got our food relatively quickly and the staff were very friendly. I would definitely go here again.

My cousin took me here 4 years ago to have the chicken wings and dumplings when she was home to take her board exams. It was delicious but I completely forgot all about it cause I hate the drive up to SF. However a month ago, I went with my sister up to SF to sign the lease for her new apartment and when it came time for dinner I remembered this restaurant. Boy was I glad I did. The fried dry chicken wings in their special sauce was delicious and so was their noodles in the peanut sauce. I came back earlier this week when I was helping the little sis move into her place and we got the hot and sour soup and some veggie tofu dish and ofcourse the wings. Yummmm!

The wife, kids and I showed up here after spending some time in Golden Gate Park. The nearby location, overall very good Yelp reviews plus the line out the door made us want to give it a try. (Not like we wanted to wait in a line, really, but there was another Chinese place across the street yet everyone seemed to prefer this one.) We tried the famous wings of course, and also chicken soup noodles, shrimp dumplings and chicken fried rice. We really enjoyed all of it - the wings were great, almost too sweet, but the heat helped to balance it out. Nice crispy fried/caramelized crust on the outside! The soup noodles were excellent - great flavor with handmade noodles. The dumplings were very good, maybe not quite up to par with the rest, but not bad. The wife and kids said the fried rice was the best they ever had - it was pretty darn good, and had a slightly wetter texture than every other fried rice I've ever had. And I mean that in a good way - it almost had a risotto-y texture it. Overall, we were kinda bummed that we couldn't go back a second time during our trip to SF. Next time we're up North, we're going to skip Chinatown and head straight to San Tung.

so 2 completely different friends told me about these "crack" chicken wings. i had to try it. they were good, don't get me wrong, but at the end of the meal, it's just chicken wings with an asian honey glaze. to give you a little background, when i travel, i eat my way thru the place. so every meal counts and every calorie has to be worth it. since we only heard about the "crack" chicken wings, we ordered 1 order for the 2 of us. that's it. no noodles. no rice. no vegetable. the waitor asked us if we wanted wet or dry. we said dry, but it came out wet. later we heard the same waitor say, "no matter you ordah wet or dry - all come out wet." ooookay, good to know. why ask? but i digress. the first drummette was tasty. promising. but by the last wing, my tongue was raw from the salty sweet sauce. the goopy sauce was all the way under my nails and I felt jipped. not a total waste of a meal, but i think there could have been something better for me out there. ?if i lived in SF, i would go again. the noodles actually looked good, but we stuck to our guns and only ordered chicken. btw - every table in the restaurant orders this dish! so 20M fans can't be wrong. right?

This restaurant will be one of the few that I will give 5 Stars to. The reason is because this is the only restaurant I know serves Ja Jang Mein. One of my all times favorites and they make it the right way! It is homemade. Nice and saucy with meat and shrimp. The only complaint is the last time I had it they got a little skimpy on the shrimp and meat. But still, I don't know any other place. If you do let me know. ?The chicken wings are also a favorite.

I came here with a bunch of girlfriends on a Friday night. One girl had to show up at 5PM to reserve the table. This place gets packed really fast on a Friday night. We came with a big appetite for chicken wings, green string beans and beer. We kept putting in more orders for the spicy chicken wings. The waiter was extremely nice, we placed an order for another plate of chicken wings and he gave us the one he was holding. I'm sure that plate was supposed to go to another table but he saw how hungry my friend was and gave it to us. Our food came quickly and I had my fill of wings and beer. I will be back to try the noodle dishes in the future. Prices here were really reasonable. This is a fun place to hang out on a Friday night.

Typical chinese place. Although, I have to admit they are more authentic than most because they serve pai dan (perserved egg) and pig ear. I think it is way to hyped up. Chicken wings were not worth the wait. Mongolian beef - average Chicken wings - a little above average. If it weren't for the fact that it was sweet, they would be normal friend chicken wings. They add honey, molasses, or some kind of sweet syrup to the chicken wings to make them a little bit sweet. I would even go as far to say that this dish is the same as going to KFC and getting chicken wings with the honey dipping sauce. Green long beans - normal. A friend recommends the pig ear dish. I am too "white washed" to try it.

Dried fried chicken wings or anything dried fried for that matter is a must try. Everything is pretty good, and worth the wait as it can often be pretty long. Even when I have phoned an order it, no matter what it is will always be an hour before you can pick it up. The clearest indicator that you know this restaurant is good, is ?on a cold and rainy day you can often see groups of people huddled outside waiting for a table. If people will wait in inclement weather for your food, your definitely on to something.

Came here again a couple months ago . The soup was very good that came with the food was very good . The shrimp & leek dumplings was okay . The almond chicken was ehh .. tasted just like kung pao chicken except that the almond chicken dish was not spicy and it had almonds instead of peanuts . Haha , forget almond chicken .. kung pao chicken all the way !! I finally decided to try to infamous chicken wings since my friend keeps raving about it . I don't know why everyone likes the chicken wings because I didn't . I thought the chicken wings would be " dry " like it stated on the menu but apparently they weren't dry . They had a sauce coating and it got tiring real quick . I wonder what are the " wet " chicken wings then haha !

this is one of my favorite haunts in the bay area, and definitely one of those hole in the walls, that EVERYONE seems to know about. despite everyone raving about their dry fried chicken wings, which are good... but actually kind of greasy. if you like their dry fried sauce, i would suggest the dry fried shrimp instead. but honestly. THE BEST POTSTICKERS EVER. they are seriously the size of my fist. and oh so airy and poufy! and extremely extremely hot. i don't know how they do it. but it's amazing. their dumplings (esp the shrimp chive ones) are just the right consistency and are simply put: amazing. i also love their hot and sour soup and mushu plates. don't come here expecting a nice family meal though, unless you're chinese and are used to the hustle and bustle. it's crowded, and loud, and not the cleanest. but man. those dumplings make you forget it ALL. even the hour long waits!

ahhh, san tung.. how do i love thee? let me count the ways... my friend (and fellow yelper) told me about this place after her cousin had taken her here for the"crack chicken" (hi jes!) after a good 10 minutes of ranting and raving about how good the food was, i ran for the car and we were off! the place was PACKED! i was a bit confused as to how the whole thing worked (there was a dry erase board on the wall where you'd have to write your name and your party size) and not much space to wait inside for a table, but we lucked out and it was above frost temperature outside, so the wait wasnt too bad. they sat us next to another party (kind of reminded me of the highschool cafeteria where you get in where you can fit in... but.. what a way to make some new friends..=) we had the dry fried chicken, green beans, and the dry beef with the sauce on the side and LOADS of rice. to my suprise, it was true what my friends cousins' had said "the chicken makes you full, but you dont feel sleepy after", hence, the "crack chicken"... i've been here about 3 times since, and have yet to be disappointed. in any case, you definately get your money's worth here. suggestion: there WILL be a wait, so anticipate that (you may want to bring a little snack if you're super hungry... and a coat..)

one of the many great restaurants during my visit here. ?loved it so much we went here twice! Steamed dumplings- good but your normal dumpling Pan fried dumplings- HUGE! but a little dough-y for my taste Black Bean Noodle- we tried 2 versions of this 5 and 6 off the menu i think. ?both were good. ?noodles are very tender but still a good chewy texture. ?I would have liked to try another noodle dish that isn't black bean sauce or a soup. Green Beans- always a good pick at any chinese restaurant. ?here though they threw in a pickled radish that I wasn't so found of. Fried fish- my favorite dish. ?fried but not heavy or greasy at all with a light sweet/spicy/savory sauce. and their specialty dry chicken wings- the other reviews say it enough. can't come here and not get it. yum Prices are decent for a chinese restaurant. ?they have good lunch deals that end at 3 on the weekdays. ?service- decent. ?my friends that live here always take visitors here- great indication that it's a great place. ?i will be here again next time i'm in the bay area.

Mediocre at best. ?I don't get why this place is always crowded. It's pretty run of the mill, take-out Chinese food. ?The fried chicken is good, but is that even Chinese? The flavors are pretty bland. ?Nothing special about the dumplings - I've had much better. ?They market themselves as 'Northern Chinese' - hence the name. ?But nothing is uniquely Northern about their menu. ?I'd probably give them 3 stars if it weren't for the crazy crowds and mass chaos.

My boyfriend and I went to this place recently at 7pm on a weekday night. Had to wait for 1 hour before we got seated. That was the major downer. But once we were seated, we got served tea right away and our menus. The kim-chi appetizer that came with our menus tasted kinda nasty for me. Didn't like it at all and I always love kim-chi. My Korean boyfriend didn't notice and said it tasted fine. So we ordered some stuff, rice, and these soft tortilla-like things where we can add lettuce/chicken/sauce/etc on it. That tasted soooo good, better than the one they serve at Elephant Bar. I am so getting that again the next time I come here. Of course we had to order the chicken, it's always the best at this restaurant! ?We were so stuffed, we took the chicken home for dessert! Yummm. Will be here again, though not for the wait. By the way they are totally PACKED on weekends especially right after church. In fact, let me re-phrase that: they are ALWAYS packed. But a lot of customers only means one thing: great food! Had to take off one star for the wait though.

Lunch portions are large, very inexpensive, and there is good, super quick service. There was tons of people and the dry chicken, we got it diced, was AMAZING. So very perfectly crunchy and the sauce made me want to lick the plate, sweet, savory, and a bit of red chili spice. We are definitely going back, for lunch, dinner, and for sure, take out. All the other yelpers who suggested the chicken were right on.

This place is highly over-rated but packed with folks (they must be hungry). The (very) dry fried chicken was bad and the noodle dish my wife ordered needed more seafood (horrible). You don't have to be Chinese to know that San Tung is just okay.... not close to being great. I won't be back. Adios!

Since my friends have taken me out here, I have become a regular! I usually order take out from here since the wait can be long. The dry fried chicken wings are some of the best chicken wings I have ever eaten! We usually order 2 orders to go. The secret to take out is to put it under the broiler for about 2-4 minutes and the wings become crispy, sweet and savory heaven in your mouth! Just be careful cause it is hot out of the oven. We usually order chow mein and rice on the side because the chicken wings are all you need! If only I could find out the secret recipe....

The food here is ok. I can see why people like the dried fried chicken wings. The wings have a crispy honey glaze in a sweet chili sauce. I also ordered the Three Deluxe Spicy Sauce Noodles. DO NOT GET THIS. It was really bland and nothing special...totally not spicy at all. It had shrimp, scallops, and calamari in it...all overcooked and ?rubbery. We also had the Combination Fried Rice. That saved us...we were able to eat that and the chicken wings. All in all...i would have given this place 4 stars b/c of the chicken wings, but the service here SUCKS!...minus one star! ?the waitress came to sit us to the table and take our order. We didn't see her until she came back to our table 30 mins later to give us our check. She never came back to ask us if we needed anything, if our meal was ok, or to refill our waters (which my bf ran out of and I had to give him some of mine).

YUM YUM YUM! The black bean sauce on top of homemade noodles were sooo goood! It looked real heavy and I was prepping myself for an over salted experience however everything was mellow and seasoned just right. Of course the standard dry fried chicken wings, dry fried green beans, and veggie fried rice were a hit. I love this spot and really don't mind the wait. Parking was not too bad and service was helpful and fairly friendly. The restaurant was buzzing on Friday night with real fast turnover. Price was great... where can you get 5 dishes and 2 beers for under 50 bucks with PLENTY of leftovers in SF??? I am already counting the days to go back and eat there.

i've heard about this place for years, i've had someone's leftover dumplings before and they were amazing! so, when i found myself with a free saturday night this weekend, we decided to endure the 40 minute table wait. Since i don't like chicken on bones (weird, i know..but whatever), we didn't get the dry fried chicken. However, the trio we shared the 5-person table with got TWO orders! We got two orders of the drumplings (shrimp & pork), hot & sour soup and a beef dish. all of the items were amazinnggggg. i'm only giving 4 stars though, because i still think my boyfriend's mom makes better dumplings.

It was about 6pm on a Saturday night, and there were 15 groups ahead of us. ?My friends and I had driven across the city and were not going to be deterred, so I put my name on the waiting list and we ducked away next door at Tom's Peasant Pies to get away from the cold. ?45 minutes later, we finally got our table! ?Looking around, the place was packed, mostly with Asian folks which promises a more authentic Asian food experience (including at times rude, but mostly rushed service by the waitstaff). ?You have to be a bit aggressive to get any attention, but once the food came, all was forgiven! ?My friends and I had ordered a bunch of dishes to eat family style, and here are my thoughts on what we ate... --Steamed potstickers (not the most fresh-tasting, as I saw from the wrapper that it had some freezer burn, but the filling was good and not greasy)...I did see a couple plates of the dumplings pass us by, and those looked more tasty (mental note for next time...) --Black Bean Sauce Noodles or Ja Jang Myun for you Korean folks (very good, with thick fresh noodles, just-right sauce, and topped with crisp sliced up cucumber) --Original Dry Fried Chicken...the combination of the sweetness of the glaze, spicy from the peppers, and the crispy crunchy of the fried coating....mmmm, finger-licking goodness! --Dried sauteed asparagus...perfectly cooked, chopped asparagus, with that slight crunch that is cooked in a nice, light garlic sauce. --Chicken fried rice...very good standard fried rice My advice--come prepared for a long wait around peak dinner times especially on weekends, but once seated and the order is put in, the food comes out pretty quickly and you can take your time to savor the delicious food. ?:)

As if this place needed any more help, I figure I'd say San Tung is awesome as well. Of course the chicken wings are delicious, but so is everything else. If you're a big fan of the salty, the black bean noodle is very strong in that regard. The service is fast and friendly, though the place definitely gets packed, so if you're not against eating at odd hours, that'll come in handy. Of course when you do get seated, you get the food fast and happiness ensues. Also, don't be shy to share a table with your local San Franciscans, sometimes it does get that packed.

The perfect ending to our Thanksgiving Foodie Fest. We went at 3:00 p.m. ish and there was still a line. Which should already show you how good the food is. We ordered the Dry Fried Chicken Wings which were perfect. Deliciously sweet and a little spicy, crispy on the outside and moist on the inside. Of course, I would come back just for those wings. On top of that, we had the -shrimp and leek dumplings which were so juicy and fresh -Garlic Eggplant which was pretty unique and flavored with allspice as well. -Seafood Black Bean Sauce Noodles which were probably the least impressive out of the whole bunch, but it might also be that we were getting full. (it came last) Next time, I'll probably order two orders of the dry fried chicken wings, the shrimp and leek dumplings, garlic eggplant, and their dry fried chicken.

Food is good, but may be a tad too sugary in some dishes. ?Ambiance is typical fast-food type of Chinese restaurant, waiters are not very customer service oriented. ?Evenings are very crowded, busy, crammed and LOUD. ?The waiters often ignore you because they're busy, which could make for a slight stress while dining there. ?And, oh yeah, although it's been a while, the last time I ate there with my family my sister found a cockroach crawling on the walls. ?Enjoy!

Came here a couple of times recently just because of their famous Dry Chicken! Once again, I was speechless. Haven't had any kind of chicken like this one. It's has a sweet taste to it that i can't describe which you should try out for yourself! I also ordered their Mongolian Beef and Combination chow-main, both were okay. Nothing significant about it and can be most likely bought at another Chinese restaurants. As for service, it's okay. It's a bit of challenge to call them over to refill your water, especially if you're by the door. But for sure the the Dry Chicken is BOMB! ?It's good paired with plain white rice since the chicken itself is rich in flavor already. This is why I will many more visits to this place. Highly Recommended!

For the past few years this place has been a bit a hidden gem in SF for my cousins and I. We'd drive an hour from our home to SF, and wait in the longass lines just to get our hands on some CHICKEN. Then drive home. Yup, it's worth the wait and long drive. EVERY time I've been here and trust me it's been more than 10+, the food has been on point. Service aside (it IS a chinese restaurant afterall), the food is beyond wonderful. Well, the chicken at least. We always get the sizzling rice soup, green beans, dry chicken wings (2+ orders :)) and sometimes spicy beef noodle soup b: My dad enjoys the steamed dumplings and they also have a fried meat that's drowned in the same sauce as the chicken. As for rice, you order per "bowl" and the bowls usually come w/ a lot so one bowl is good enough for two people... ANYWAYS, GET THE CHICKEN. The sauce is surrriously TO DIE FOR. One time I couldn't eat meat I made my dad drive me there just so I could have rice and the SAUCE on the side. They were kind enough to do that w/o charge of sauce, :) Hehe. This isn't your typical chinese restaurant, it's beyond your wildest dreams. LOL

All I have to say is, I love the "Dried Fried Chicken Wings". Need I say more? There dumplings are also very tasty. Great place for people with kids. I'd recommend you call ahead, the wait is long if you don't have reservations.

Every time I come here...i am STUFFED and beyond satisfied. Go early, expect greasy BUT totally delish Chinese food and wear expandable pants If you decide to come here, get these three items and it'll change your life: 1. The Chicken Wings-dry or wet...it don't matter...it's going to turn out FREAKING good either way...just depends how you like em...in fact...get BOTH! and ask for a little bit of spiciness. 2. The vegetable fried POT-STICKERS...yes, you can get pot stickers anywhere in town...but there's something about San Tung that makes it's juuuuuuuuuuuuuust right! 3. Last BUT not least order either the garlic green beans or spicy garlic eggplant...BOTH will knock y'all dead! But you should order either of these so you don't feel so guilty ordering all greasy fried items...you got a veggie dish! :) it'll balance it out. get these three dishes and you will be content when leaving this place...i promise you'll come back and order the same thing again and again...and you'll be OKAY with that. I know I am.

crispy chicken wing with garlic, ginger and roasted red peppers with a nice hint of honey. wow!!! wow... wow... have i said wow yet? seriously, this one of the best wings i have ever had and i love me some wings. i also love me some hot and sour soup. like the wings, its definately one of the best i had. makes a cold foggy san franciscan days much brighter and warmer. the only downfall of this place is the service. perhaps, they were more packed than a can of sardines with 20 ppls on the wait list (of course, i can see why). i dont think it takes 15 minutes for a to go box and our check. but what the heck, i went back the next day for more soup and wings.

Definitely a hole-in-the-wall, but totally worth the experience. ?You will probably have to wait and may have to share a table with strangers - which is not atypical of authentic Chinese restaurants. ?The dumplings were okay, I think the potstickers may be better. ?The spicy-seafood-noodle (jjam bong) is quite good - a HUGE portion that my husband and I shared. ?The chicken wings are a MUST. ?Crispy, sweet and juicy, my husband is trying to figure out how to get them for the first football game of the season.

i was in search of korean-chinese food. ?good korean-chinese food. ?do you know what i mean? ?there are a ton of korean-chinese restaurants in l.a.'s k-town (my hood), but thanks to yelp!, i found san tung. ?actually, we're heading there tonight! ? san tung's menu consists primarily of chinese food, but it also has a number of my absolute fave korean-chinese dishes. ?spicy seafood noodle soup (jambbong), noodles with black bean sauce (jajangmien) and sweet and sour beef with brown sauce (tongsooyook). ?my mouth is watering just thinking about them. ?we get other stuff too (my husband hearts the dry fried chicken wings), but the noodle dishes and the sweet and sour beef are why we keep going back. ?the couple times we ordered some of the chinese items on the menu, we were a bit disappointed, however, so we stopped doing that. ?san tung also has the yummy cabbage kimchi that you can only find in korean-chinese restaurants! ?and the portions are very generous. as anyone who's been to san tung knows, the wait can be very long. ?the small waiting area right inside the front door can be difficult to get through and often there are a lot of people waiting on the sidewalk out front. ?so we always order to go. ?also, parking can be difficult in this neighborhood. service may not be the friendliest, but they get the job done.

It used to me 1 of my favorite places in SF. But not anymore. The steam dumpling is too salty. I mean it tastes no flavor but just dead salt. My ex roommate only took 1 bite and refused to eat the rest of them. ( This place is one of her favorite place in SF, too.) The shrimp of dried fried shrimp is too small. And the chicken is the way to sweet now. What's wrong with this place? I miss my old San Tung Chinese Restaurant.

The two things I heard about this place were 1. Theres always a wait for a table where folks are scattered by the door and on the sidewalk. 2. Tjhe chicken wings are worth the wait. After eating here I can say both are true, lol. Got there at about 8 or so and there were quite a few people ahead of us on the board. The wait was pretty long, but it wasn't so bad. The staff is pretty quick about cleaning up a table and seating whoever is next right away. For dinner we ordered the chicken wings, which were really good. But my friend was telling me she thought they used to be spicier. We also had the hot n sour soup and beach w/oyster sauce. I don't love hot n sour soup but my friend wanted it so I had a little bit...after the server poured some in a bowl for me. Haha so I had no choice. It was good though. The beef with oyster sauce was ok in my opinion, meaning it was good enough but not great by any means. Also ordered the scallops in garlic sauce to take to the house. Didn't eat this right away so its hard to give a fair judgement on it since it wasn't eaten straight from the stove. But it was pretty good still. If you come here eat the wings like everyone says, haha. San Tung is a good spot.

This place used to be one of my favorites. ?I understand that good restaurants in my hometown attract a loyal following, so I won't rant about the long waits, cramped seating, and crazy noise levels. ? I've waited over an hour on a Friday night for a table for two. ?Some of you might be able to relate, but toward closing hours, when most people have left, it feels eerily silent compared to the romping beforehand. ?That's when you realize how loud it gets. ? I personally don't think it's worth such a long wait(that's why I always pick my spots when I go), but I don't hold this against them. ?It gives you great bang for the buck. ?The Ja Jang Myun and potstickers are among the best that I've had. If you read the other lower-star reviews on this place, a lot of them mention service. ?For me, it was never quite a downer because I know that Chinese restaurants are all about speed and efficiency. ?They don't win you over with friendly service. ?With an adjusted expectation, I even felt that some of the waiters offered good service at times. ?I don't expect much and have gotten used to people throwing down the bill at me before I'm done eating, and then checking multiple times if I've paid when I have not even touched the tab from its original position, although I admit that has gradually become one of my major pet peeves over the years. But when I went about two months ago, one of the waiters(looked relatively newer than the more familiar old-timers) had the audacity to explicitly tell my friend and me to leave because there were other customers waiting in line. ?Perhaps it was my mistake for paying for the bill relatively fast, thinking that it would afford me a few more minutes of carefree conversation with my friend to let the food digest a bit. ?Servers have a way of indirectly pressuring you to leave. ?What this particular waiter did was outrageous. ?Is that how they train their staff? ?Was he banking that I was planning to wear out my welcome and wanted nothing more than to stay in that noise filled space for another half hour? I sincerely hope that this was an isolated incident. ?Do not stay away from San Tung simply because of the experience detailed here. ?Chances are what happened to me isn't going to happen to you. ?But let this be a reminder that service expectations need to go out the door; that way when you do get some level of service, you'll appreciate it all the more. I suggest going here for takeout as a safer bet for your time and satisfaction. Also, don't expect any fresh seafood.

Expect a wait. But think about the chicken wings that you'll get to enjoy later. They pack this place as tight as it will go. Expect to share a table among strangers if there are no large parties at the time. Service is spotty. But usually you're stuffing your face that you don't notice it until end of the meal when you realize you need something to drink after finishing the finger-licking goodness aka chicken wings.

I thought the food as okay. The chicken wings are good, but I had better. The pig ears were okay, I prefer it to be crunchier in texture. The dried beef ?or deep fried beef was not good.

I have to give this place a WTF. ?Went on a Saturday night and it was busy to say the least. ?There were 10 groups ahead of me. ?I put my name down and waited. ?The wait wasn't bad, about 30 minutes and we were seated. ?There was a 5-10 party wait the entire time we were there, they do some business. ?Staff was good and service was also good especially considering the volume of business they are doing. As everyone on here recommends, we got the wings and some dumplings. ?We also ordered hot and sour soup, crackling rice soup, curry chicken, and the cold noodles in peanut sauce. The wings were good. ?The wings would get let's say 3 and a half stars on their own.. The dumplings were pretty average, let's say 3 stars. ?The other dishes were downright mediocre. ?The hot and sour was ok. ?I have a mild allergy to shrimp, so I asked them if they make the hot and sour without shrimp, the waiter said yes and I ordered the soup. ?As I'm eating the soup I bite into a shrimp and found 2 others. ?Thankfully, my allergy isn't severe, but that was a pretty big screw up in my book. ?I'm not taking this into account in my rating because it wasn't a huge deal for me personally, but it's worth noting. I didn't have the crackling rice soup, but my friends said it was very bland and dumped a lot of salt into it. ?The curry chicken was the most disappointing, just not flavorful or good in any way. ?The noodles were just ok.. again fairly bland. Overall, this probably scores a little lower because of the hype. But this is mediocre food in my book.

Ordered: leek and shrimp dumpling (cheap $5-7) potsticker (cheap $5-7) can't remember pork fried rice $6 something dried chicken wing $9 dry black bean noodle $8-10 something I am not a big fan of sweet chicken wings. But they are pretty good. Crispy on the outside, moist on the inside. The black bean noodle was OK. I had better ja jang mien somewhere else. The dumplings was ok (slightly better than the instant dumpling you can get in ranch 99). Their potsticker has tons of meat juice so beware and DON'T SPILL IT like I did :( The surprise for me was their pork fried rice. Their fried rice was amazing. The unique smell of slightly charred rice and egg, combined with succulent pork slices. OMG. this is a must order when you go here. Also don't order the steamed rice. For $1.50 per person I'd rather order 1 pork fried rice to be shared with 4 people than getting steamed rice for the same price. So next time when I go here, I'd just order pork fried rice + chicken wing and I'm set. PS: the pie shop next door has some pretty good pies. I had one pie because I was too hungry to wait for san tung (30 minutes wait for Sunday lunch)

Excellent crispy chicken with just the right amount sauce. Not too "complicated order "and not too dry.hahah I hate those wing places where the wings are soo drenched in sauce I feel like getting a facial done afterwards... . I ordered both chicken wings and diced chicken pieces which were amazingly good by itself without rice needed. It would think it's great for superbowl or some parties you have even though I don't watch football. The point is that I can eat it anytime of the day. hehe I would definitely bring my friends and family here since they have other dishes to order that appeared delicious from the view I had from my table during my dinner. GREAT WINGS :)

Dried, Fried Chicken Wings are the main reason to come to San Tung. The specialty sauce used is an addicting honey, garlic glaze that will you have licking your fingers afterwards. San Tung also uses the sauce on other dishes, including vegetables and my personal favorite - Dried, Fried Flounder Fillet. The fish is more tender than the chicken wings, which can also come as diced chicken. Also worth trying: - Cold Noodles - Fried Pot Stickers The food is tasty, but may not be worth the typical hour-long wait on busy nights. I'd recommend going early, or picking up an order of Dried, Fried Fish or Chicken to-go.

i'm nicely giving it a 3 star, it just meets my expectation for an average chinese restaurant. ?not sure why the restaurant is always full of people when i come here( i have been there for quite few times to give another try for different dishes). ? so i come to a conclusion that their food is only A-OK. ?ordered chicken wings for few times, but they tasted differently every time. ?one time is too sour. ?other times are sweet and okay. ?do not order the eggplant, which is too plain of flavor and greasy. ? i would not refuse to come here if my friends ask for since their food is average. ?i just won't get the dishes that i already tried and don't like. ?but if my friends ask me to go for chinese food, i would probably about to ignore this restaurant because their food just can not impress me.

Whoever rates this place a 3 and below doesn't appreciate the food offered by San Tung. It's easy to make fake Original Dried fried chicken wings, and sell it cheap, but it'll never be the same. I can always taste a fake. Anyways, this place is F***ING delicious. What i like to order is the Sizzling Rice soup, fried potstickers, sauteed string beans, and of course ORIGINAL DRIED FRIED CHICKEN WINGS! Best kind of chinese chicken wings.

Being somewhat lazy and living on the other side of SF, it can be a struggle to get me to any place in the Sunset district but I'm certainly glad I made it. ?A co-worker suggested the place and of course mentioned the wings so I went in with pretty high expectations. I went with my wife and her two siblings. ?First, service was great there. ?They were friendly, fast, and courteous. ?It' unfortunate that they don't take reservations but it's a little Chinese place so I don't really expect that from them and don't hold the wait against them. ?It's part of the deal. ? I'm undivided about them seating 3 people at a table for 7. ?Would I or anyone like sharing a table with others? ?I've been to restaurants in the US and other countries where they aren't shy about that and don't remember complaining or having a bad time. ?If anything, good conversations usually come from it. On to the food - we ordered the dry wings, pot stickers, hot and sour soup, a beef dish, and fried rice. ?I considered ordering both dry and wet just to try them both out but went with dry. ?Given the name, I expected wings without any sauce so I don't know what makes it "dry" or did ?I get the wrong order? ?Wings were fantastic! ?Probably some of the best wings or chicken dish I've had. ?My sis-in-law is a huge pot sticker fan so this is really her feedback (which I agree with) - too big and the wrapper is too thick. ?When it's too thick, it gets to be a bit chewy and more labor to eat than it should. ?The hot and sour soup was good and would satisfy anyone's expectations. ?It was well balanced cause no one added any additional white pepper or vinegar except for me. ?I like my h-n-s soup really strong. ?The fried rice was fried rice - easy to get right and easy to screw up so they get some points for it. ?The beef dish was great as well - sauce was a great consistency, great flavor, and the beef was cooked nice and tender. As for pricing, all the above with soft drinks and a beer was around $60 which is great for 4 people and the amount of food we had. ?I'm looking forward to coming back with either my family or my in-laws. ?My wife expects her father to love this place and he's the chef at a Chinese restaurant.

dry fried chicken wings. best. thing. there. I came with a group of 10 and they were very accommodating. luckily, we came before rush hour so we were seated very fast. waiters were nice and speedy and once we decided on what to order...food came out pretty promptly. we ordered about 8 different dishes in total so I was able to get a pretty good sense of the kind of food they serve here. everything was kind of mediocre. maybe it was all the msg, the oil, or just what we ordered...but it was just decent. overall...good service. decent food. come for the bomb-ass chicken wings!

5 stars for their chicken wings because that's pretty much the only dish that's good here. I've been here a couple times, yes just for the wings, and each time it is crazy crowded! So be prepared to wait an average of 20-30 mins depending on the day. service is pretty good considering how busy they are. people are raving about their dumplings but it's really nothing special, the ones my mom makes are better. so if you're in the mood for some awesome chicken wings, it's worth a trip here but otherwise, I wouldn't recommend coming here for any of their other dishes.

Went here with some friends for a friend's birthday. The wait was reasonable. They don't take reservations but if you call ahead and tell them a large party is coming, they'll save you a table. The chicken wings are "crack" good, so are the green beans. The dumpling was okay and everything after that was a blur. Great place to get a great meal. And remember to tip your server well.

Came here per recommendation of a friend. It was *packed*. There were about twenty people waiting outside, and the waitlist showed six parties. So I got the much-acclaimed dry friend chicken wings to go. As expected, there were really tasty. But not quite out of this world, and probably quite unhealthy. The portion of chicken wings was about $10, which I consider pretty pricy for just chicken wings. I also bought a portion of rice for an extra $1.50 or so. It was a good experience, but I don't see myself returning alone unless the prices dropped a bit. I wouldn't mind taking a friend here, though. It's a worthwhile experience, and I imagine that a larger party would allow a more varied meal.

We all know from previous reviews and word of mouth that San Tung is the best place to get chicken wings. Absolutely mouth watering. However, I would like to talk about their service and other selections on the menu. If you go before the dinner rush, you should be seated right away. The dinner rush at San Tung is ridiculous and you could spend a long time waiting. They try to seat smaller groups together at big tables, but still, they need a bigger place in my opinion. The service is quick and friendly and as good as it can get when they are that busy. This is a fun, loud Chinese restaurant that I love taking my friends to whenever they visit me in the city. The staff gives complimentary kimchee when you order, which is nice and spicy. I've ordered fried rice, chow mein, dry fried beef, cashew chicken, and a number of other items. All of these are great. I can't complain about a single item on the menu. Overall, if you're looking for just regular Chinese food, go somewhere else that's cheaper and quicker. But if you want something amazing, get the wings. Its the only item on their menu worth getting and waiting for.

My ultimate favorite Chinese style chicken wings, not only in SF, but in the world. ?I frequently travel to China and even there, the wings don't compare. ?I can't quite pick out their secret, but this signature dish, attracts 30 minute lines during busy hours and the wings are tangy, tasty, crunchy, hot, moist and tender. The dumplings are also awesome, as well as the dried string beans.

Really bad service experience on my most recent visit. Our steamed rice never arrived, and as we finished eating, the staff hounded us to leave the restaurant, going so far as to hover over our table with new place settings in hand as I hurried to sign the credit card receipt. But it's true, the chicken is incredibly tasty (I like the dry, diced version). The potstickers and black bean sauce noodles (Korean ja-jang myeon) are also top notch. If only the restaurant itself and the service were more pleasant...

Perfect ending to a long day spent at the GG Park. We ordered: 1. ?Shrimp and leak dumplings: ?tasty 2. ?Steamed pork potstickers: ?yum yum 3. ?Dried spicy fried chicken wings: ?the best finger lickin goodness. 4. ?Noodles with dry black bean sauce: ?excellent. ?Compares to the best 5. ?Jampong: ?average 6. ?Braised green beans: ?my daughter's favorite. ?slightly sweet and in season.

Came here on a friend's recommendation that their Koreanized Chinese food was better than LA. ?Now, everyone knows, LA has the best Koreanized Chinese food...let's just say i'm no longer friends with her. ?The statement was bold, the food was not. I had the ggan jja jang and jjam bong. ?Both were bland...now, how can you make jja jang sauce bland? ?It's freaking made of beans, salt, and pork...oh yeaaaa because they use seafood....fail. ?The jjam bong was worse, it was warm water with food coloring. The kkang bong shrimp (not kung pao shrimp, its the dried fried shrimp with garlic sauce) was too sweet...a semi fail. Now that i've vented. ?The good. ?The chicken wings were legit...but i could only eat so much of it. ?The hot sour soup and sizzling rice soup were delicious as well. I'm going to make the assumption that San Tung's food catered towards white folks are good...and whoever writes that their jja jang myun and jjam bong are good are on crack.

Went back for wings for Super Bowl party, was made to wait an additional 40 minutes after calling in the order 30 minutes earlier. ?Take-out "system" was completely disorganized, they left no where for customers to wait for their orders. ?Consequently, everyone who were waiting for delayed orders crowded around the register which was located right outside the opening to the kitchen. ?Waiters barked at their loyal customers as they wait up to an hour for their order, and the waiters randomly handed off the infamous wet chicken wings. ?BTW, Lee Hou on Clement between 4th and 5th has a Honey Garlic Chicken Wings that can kick San Tung's Wet chicken out of the ball park.

So I come to this place at 5:30pm for dinner on a Sunday night, anticipating a long wait and large crowds at the door. Lucky for us, the wait wasn't too long. A party of 8 with 5 of us being from out of town, we had to order the famous spicy dry chicken wings. In addition to that we started off with the dry black bean sauce noodles, garlic stir fried string beans, honey walnut shrimp, and pork chow mein with home made noodles. We quickly realized that this wasn't enough food for 5 big guys and 3 girls so we added the wet chicken wings, sweet and sour pork, and peking duck. I'm not a huge fan of chicken wings so this review might be a little biased. I've been here before so I've had both types of the wings. They seem like pretty standard spicy chicken wings to me. A lot of the people I was with said that they didn't feel the spice, but I (being terrible with spiciness) had to keep the water in hand. Everyone really liked the wings but my favorite was the black bean sauce noodles. I really like the sauces and the noodles were just the right amount of chewy. The string beans were good but very oily. The peking duck wasn't sliced thin the way it was supposed to and the little bit I tasted was really salty. The honey walnut shrimp was pretty good and I didn't have any of the other dishes. The service was very fast on our first round of orders and it slowed a little on the second round, but it was okay, our stomachs were full enough to wait. Once it looked like we could possibly be done, the waiter took no time to drop some fortune cookies and the bill on the table. They actually overcharged us, so our friend took it up to get it fixed, the cashier said, " I knew there was a mistake, I was waiting for it to come back." That's a pretty bad mistake which qualified this place for the removal of a star from me. Good food, and hit or miss service.

I've eaten here about 20 times and I've had only a few minor disappointments with the food, almost always exceptional with generous portions and quick service. The lunch special menu is a steal, always turns into a second meal at home later. The only hassle are the lines, always a wait during peak hours and their do-it-yourself-chalkboard-wait-list is anxiety inducing. I recommend coming either very early or very late.

My only complaint for this place is that it's too popular. I went today for a Sunday brunch and waited outside for about 30 minutes. But, there is a reason that so many people are waiting for a table here - the food is fantastic. Our meal started out with a complimentary appetizer of Kimchi, and then we had Mu Shu pork, Mongolian beef, potstickers, Lo mein, and of course the famous fried chicken wings. It was all so delicious - I can't pick out what I liked best.

Came here to try the infamous chicken wings that everybody is talking about. Thankfully it wasn't too crowded because I went on a Friday afternoon for lunch. The food we got was alright, tasted like any other Chinese food to me but the chicken wings was very good. Only disappointment was that the service was HORRIBLE! No one came by to take our orders even though we called them numerous times. We had to go up to the counter to tell them to come over. While we were waiting for our food (which also took a very long time to come) a war literally broke out inside the kitchen. The owner started yelling at the people in the back. She stormed out and actually closed the restaurant as we are eating. She came back 20 mins later and continued yelling. Overall, the entertainment was the best part of my visit. Would I come back?? Maybe if they remember to bring me my freaking chicken wings!

First off, I know and love food, that coming from a family that cooks and also owning a restaurant. ?Most people who compare food to their mother's is not a fair comparison because almost everyone will say, "oh my mom's is better", well I agree, mom's food is always better because it reminds you of home and comfort. ?The cynical side of me will say if you mom's is so good then why didn't she open a restaurant and have others review it and why dont' you invite me over because I will never pass up on good food. Ok, back to the restaurant of San Tung, and it is one of my favorite places to eat. ?Everyone writes about the dry friend chicken wings, the black bean sauce noodles and the string beans, and you know what? They are excellent. ?Yes there are not enough Korean/Chinese style food, but for what its worth, I go once a week to have it. ?Plus I do not believe its the hype of Yelp that people go there, yes that part of it, but it is also word of mouth and when I moved back to San Francisco alot of my chinese friends took me there, and it reminded me of food that I grew up with and to the similar restaurants that I have been to. People who give it one star usually talks about the service which to me is not that bad because i have been to worse( for example not getting my dinner for 2 hrs during valentines day), or basically order the wrong things, please do not go there for the brocolli beef, or the mu shu pork, or whatever else you can order from the American-Chinese restaurants, yes that is part of the menu but there are other things to order. ?Its like going to a real burger place and comparing it to McDonalds.

I visited this place today based on so many 5* yelp reviews. Even on Sunday night 8.30PM, we have to wait for 15mts after It is normal good Chinese food but not a unique interesting place to speak about. We ordered Fried Rice, Chow Mein, String Beans & Dry Fried Chicken (wet), they were all OK, fried rice was little bit salty and the Chicken had sweet taste, menu mentioned it as a spicy dish.

The food is very good. ?Far-and-away very good? -- not really. ?I've had just as good or better in SoCal, where these Chinese/Korean joints are easier to find, but if you're in the Bay Area and have a hankering for black bean noodles or dry fried chicken wings, this is the place to go. ?Just beware of the crowds. Ambience and service aren't really San Tung's order of the day, but that's ?probably fine with the throngs of families that pack the place every night. ?Friday and Saturday evenings are, of course, even busier, and an hour-long wait (on top of the hunt for parking) is no surprise. ?Personally, I preferred to forgo all the above and just phone in a take-out order. ?No crying babies, no impatient waiters, and no sharing tables with other groups (yes, they do that). If you do dare to go with a large group, maximize your experience. ?In addition to the black bean sauce noodles and wings, try the shrimp leek dumplings, hot and sour soup, and mu shu pork.

I was in SF for work last week & one night my boyfriend was craving for chinese food for dinner. ?So we pick up two of our friends and head over to San Tung in the Sunset. ?While waiting a good 30 minutes for a table for 4, I noticed about every table ordered chicken wings. ?So, we decide to order a plate of the dry chicken wings to see what all the fuss was about.... Now I like chicken wings every now and again, but WOW! This was good--like finger-licking good. ?My boyfriend asked if I wanted the last piece of chicken wing, but I declined the offerring to be nice to our other guests (secretly I was eyeing that last piece & was hoping they were too stuffed to eat it)... and YES, they didn't want it either. ?So my boyfriend, scooped up the last one and placed it delicately on my plate (good boyfriend!). ?Yup, the dry chicken wings was the only thing I really remember out my dining experience here---so if you do go, make sure you order a plate. ? For those who are not into chicken wings, this place offers comfort chinese food-- nothing too spectacular, & the prices are reasonable.

My friend loves this place, so we went. Everything was sooo good. She asked me if I wanted the Dry Chicken. Suuuurree. (Sounds terrible, but I let her pick since she loves the place and doesn't live in SF anymore). Not a great name. They are little wings that are crispy with Yummy sweet/honey sauce with just a touch of spice. We also got the peanut noodles. I would go back just for that - it's a meal for two by itself - thick noodles in a creamy peanut sauce with a little shrimp (2), a little beef, and a little tofu. Leftovers were heaven. Even the simple chicken and broccoli had a great sauce. This did not, however, cut it reheated as leftovers. the sauce was never quite the same.

We gorge on double orders of the pork dumplings when we go here. ?Luckily, the parking situation is horrible enough to discourage frequent visits. ?But when we go, we EAT! ? Tip: call in and have the waitstaff put your name up on the board...unless you want to wait 45 minutes for dinner.

The main attraction here is the dry fried chicken wings. I refuse to share this plate with anyone. Every time I go I always get my own order just for myself. Which usually works out because they're so good that everyone wants their own order. I wish it wasn't so far away and packed all the time so I could eat here more often.

We've been eating at San Tung for over 15 years. ?Every time we try another Chinese restaurant - we head right back to San Tung. ?The atmosphere is typical of most Chinese eateries in SF. ?Cleaner than most, and very popular. If you go after 5pm, expect a wait. ?When it's busy - which is most of the time - it gets very loud, making conversations difficult. ?The waiters are businesslike but helpful if questions need to be answered. ? The food is consistently delicious. ?We enjoy the hot and sour soup, handmade shrimp and leek dumplings, dry fried chicken wings, braised flounder, dry fried green beans and noodle dishes. ?The ingredients are uniformly fresh and the servings are generous. ? I don't think you can go wrong here. ?You might find a cheaper spot, but you won't find a more satisfying Chinese meal than San Tung.

That chicken everyone talks about is probably the greatest chinese chicken I've ever eaten in my entire life. I would be here every night if I could...

My wife and I've been coming here for over 10 years, especially since the closure of Golden City to fill our cravings for Northern Chinese/Korean food in San Francisco. Now San Tung is NOT a Korean restaurant, but it serves a type of Chinese food which arose along the North Korea's border with China. Thus they serve complimentary Kimchi (Korean chili spiced cabbage) and some of the menu items are written in Korean. Signature dishes of this cuisine include Ja Jang Myun (Black bean sauce noodles - don't order the dry version, trust me), Jam Pong (Combination Spicy Soup noodle) Tang Su Yook (Sweet and Sour Beef with Brown Sauce). Also included are dumplings, dry fried chicken and seafood dishes which has sea cucumbers. Note that they are crowded, it gets really loud and service can be slow. Also I've noticed couple of times over the decade of experience that the food quality can be uneven (maybe the head chef wasn't in the kitchen that day?). However, the food is usually very good. As a bonus for those of you who've read through my review till the end, Sun Tung DOES take reservations!!! Just don't spread it around to everyone so we can be sure to get a table.

I love to eat this place. It's one of the many places I love to go to for Chinese food. I eat Chinese food everyday, so when I go out to eat something, I don't want Chinese. But every time I think of this place, I always want to go to it. My favorite dishes are the chicken wings and the dumplings. I like dumplings with chives in it most. This always a very crowded and noisy restaurant, but the food there makes up for it. The service is pretty good, though one of the many times I went there, the waiter tried to get us to leave cause there were many people waiting. San Tung takes no reservations before 6 pm which is alright. Every time I pass there, there's always a big crowd. When it's someone's birthday party, and they order large portions of food, the chicken is always there also. I ordered it for my birthday too. It's very good.

I have always seen the line outside of this place and finally decided to try it for take out for lunch. The staff was very nice and professional the the food smelled great. ? When I got home and started to eat, eh... ?Maybe I ordered the wrong items but nothing was much of a stand out except the ?Dry Fried Chicken (WET) -- sounds weird but it was really tastey. ?The chow mein was blah, the won ton soup was dreadful, it had no flavor and the won ton noodles were much too thick for my taste -- the dumpling filling tasted ok but a bit too much ginger. ?The shrimp and leek dumplings were ok but I could get better for cheaper in the Richmond. All in all, I'd call this place below average and you don't get much for your money -- not a great value.

Without a doubt, it was the worst and most stressful restaurant experience I've had to date. There was a crowd of about 20 out the door. Hyped place to be the best Chinese food out there. We waited patiently for our name to be called from a white board. At least 20 people more that were not in their board where seated before. The stress increased after we saw space after space be filled. It was super busy and I was about to go crazy when people just sat down without any wait and their name was at the end of the list. The waiters were to busy to care. My BF and I almost had a massive argument but thankfully we remained calm. Finally, we got seated and I was expecting it to be amazing!! It was not!!! Maybe we had unrealistic expectations or not. We might have also not known what to order. I guess the thing to is the chicken wings.. now that I see it in the reviews. Well... we ordered the duck and some other stuff which all seemed to be less than tasteless. I am not sure the reason for the long wait ..next time I'll go to House of Nanking which regardless of what you order you are more than pleased. UpDate*** Yelpers you were right!! The wings ARE amazing!! We ordered to go!! Best idea ever... as amazing as the wings really are not enough to sacrifice my inner peace for the wait for a table. I'll raise my stars by one.

My friends took me to this restaurant because it's sooo well known and also because I've never eaten here. I didn't understand what all the excitement about when i arrived. The restaurant looked small, tacky, musty, and dirty. I mean, it's no 'five star restaurant.' However, I'm always open to trying new things. And to my surprise, their food was not half bad. They're veggies were yummy and not drenched in oil, tried the bean curd noodles (i think) very tasty, and the famous wings... I'm not sure if San Tung was the place who started the trend of making fried wings w/ sweet and spicy sauce, but I've already tasted those wings at many many restaurants before San Tung. Don't get me wrong, their famous wings were amazing, it's just that I've had them before at so many different restaurants. IF San Tung were the ones who started them then KUDOS!

I'm with everyone else...if I am in the San Franciso city area I have to have the Dry Fried Chicken Wings. This has become a favorite for my 2 picky teenagers, as well. I have been to this place twice now, once on a Sunday for dinner and the other time on a Tuesday for late lunch (around 3pm). Amazingly both times I had to wait for some time. But, it is has always been worth it. The other items that I have tried and really like are their pan fried and steamed dumplings and the smoked tea duck. I don't think I have had any dish that was bad, so far. In addition, the prices are very reasonable.

The dry fried chicken wings are the best! I don't know why they are called "dry" cause they are actually quite wet and sticky and sooo delicious. I'm also a fan of the cold peanut noodles. Everything else is pretty standard. Service is as good as any other busy, family-style Chinese Restaurant. Sometimes it gets so crowded I've shared a 9-seater round table with other diners which is kinda weird, but worth it if you're hungry and don't want to wait for a private table.

The chicken wings are the thing to get. When one of my friends forgot to order them, the waiter reminded us that we didn't order them. The waiter commented that every person order these so it thought it was weird we didn't initially order any. My other favorite dish are the cold noodles. There aren't a lot of Chinese Restaurant that have this on their menu. I love peanut sauce and noodles. The wait can sometimes be long but ordering out is quick and easy especially if you order the chicken wings. For the quality and price of the chicken wings there really isn't a reason to try and make them yourself.

This place gets 5 stars purely for the food or more specifically the Dry Fried Chicken Wings. ?Yes, it's a hole in the wall. ?Yes, it could be cleaner and yes, the waiters could be nicer. ?But the chicken wings are spectacular. ?Just the right balance of sweet and savory slathered on a crunchy but light exterior. ? Besides the wings, I also ordered pork fried rice (great), ?dry sauteed string beans (good) and the shrimp dumplings (good).

Wow!

Nice and crunchy with just the right amount of spicy and salty. ? By the way...anyone know what the difference between the Wet style and the dry style of the dry fried chicken? I've been there a couple of times. ?I always order the dry fried chicken....the waiters never ask whether I like the dry or wet one? ?I guess if I order the DRY fried chicken it's the dry one? shall i order the WET fried chicken? ?The dish that comes has a nice sauce on it...is that considered the wet or dry one? ?I have no idea....is the dry one completely dry? no sauce? ?Well if anyone can clear this up, that'll be nice. i hate the damn line! =(

Decided to check this place out as it seems to pop up everyday on the Yelp feed and enjoy new spots. The diced dry fried chicken is delicious...sweet and spicy. One of my only complaints... like other take out/delivery I got quite a few tiny worthless pieces of chicken mixed in with the other larger pieces. When eating AT a restaurant, they always seem to give you the larger pieces...?? The potstickers were light and unique, handmade and not doughy. Mixed Chow mein and fried rice were full of fresh ingredients including the seafood. They don't deliver so take out it is, and parking stinks around here. Very busy place. I can't say I'd do take out again, but would definitely eat there next time around. One of the better places I've gotten Chinese food.

OMG BEST CHINESE FOOD EVER!! The Chicken wings are so good! Let me just give you an idea, if you go in to eat every single table in the restaurant will have a plate of Chicken Wings, GUARANTEED! The only downfall to this restaurant is that it is so popular there does tend to be a wait and it's always loud, unless you get there at around 9pm on a weekday evening!!! The food overshadows the crowd and noise though. I eat there several times a week I love them that much!!! LOVE SAN TUNG!!!

San Tung is my favorite Chinese restaurant in all of SF! I usually come in for the dry fried chicken wings! Aside from that, I usually order a couple dishes of noodles. The sauce on the chicken wings is THAT good that I almost always spread it over all my other food! Last year, I brought some of my friends from LA, and they were completely in love with their chicken wings! They still talk about it to this day about wanting to go back! Waiting time is usually pretty long, considering how popular this place is! I recommend going before the the rush, which is generally around 6pm. Parking may be difficult!! Also...it's way too loud in here! So don't bother coming if you want a quiet place with your date or something! I'm pretty sure this will be my first destination when I come back to SF next week!

Looking for a place in The City that could accommodate my big extended family for Father's Day lunch is tough. Thanks to Yelp we found this restaurant. I don't know if it was the dishes we ordered or if they were having an off day. We heard great things about the Fried Chicken so that was the first dish ordered. Everything else just tasted like ordinary Chinese food. Nothing really stood out to us.

delicious! their lunch special is a great deal and as all the other yelp reviewers say - try the chicken wings, both dry and wet are delicious although a little spicy. also enjoy that they set a pot of tea in front of you and some kimchi while you wait for the food. definitely my go-to chinese place in the area

I just don't get the appeal of this place. Yes we had the dry fried chicken wings, which I took one bite of and shoved away. They were saturated in overly sweet sauce and had more greasy fried and fatty chunks than any chicken. We started with hot and sour soup, which lacked the spiciness that you would expect with that particular soup. My parents had the black bean noodles, which was supposed to have scallops and shellfish, but we couldn't find any. It was served with all the sauce on the bottom, so when they originally dished it out, it was flavorless. Maybe they should mix it before they bring it to the table instead of sloppily putting it in a bowl. The one redeeming dish was the shrimp and leek dumplings, which although really doughy, were homemade and fresh tasting. All the food was sufficiently hot, which I am a stickler for, so they get one additional star there. Service was brusque and fast, which is pretty standard for high volume restaurants. Maybe we hit them on an off day, maybe the chicken wings are full of MSG so I just need to eat a plate of them to realize their amazingness, who knows. But for the meantime, out of all the great restaurants in the city, I would skip this one for sure.

I have to say, I'm very disappointed with San Tung Restaurant, despite all the good reviews from yelps. -The waiting line is ridiculous, we came around 5:30pm, and we are on the 23th of the waiting list. we didn't get our table until 6:30pm. By the time we got a table, the waiting list was long enough to reach 50th. -It is very very noisy, mainly came from the people who are waiting for seats. -the food are not that great, we tried all the chef recommended dishes-the 'dry fried chicken' 'dry fried fillet' and ' seasoned beef noodle', shrimp and leek dumplings and the combination seafood soup. The best out of the 3 dishes we tried was the Dry Fried Chicken which we couldn't finish even in a group of 5. The initial taste of was awesome. However we began to realize once we started digging on the 3 and subsequent pieces, we began to get bored of the "sweetness" and the quality of the sugar used The combination seafood soup is horrible. We ordered a large portion, which contains: 4 shrimp, a few veggie, 2 scallop and water. The best thing is, we can taste the water as if we are drinking it directly from tap. Oh yeah, and the dumplings almost taste as good as the ones we bought in super market.

Yes, it may be messy...yes, tables may need more cleaning sometimes...but, hey, these people have a high turnover, lines are already there.

My family and I had dinner here a couple days ago. We really loved the dried fried chicken(wings and drummettes are my fav). We also ordered the usual dried string beans, which was also excellent. This restaurant was recommended by a family friend who lives near by. By far an excellent recommendation.

I have been going to San Tung for years, even the original place, which is now converted to a noodle shop. ?Do come early (before 6) and sign up, or else the line gets really long. ?The food is great and we always order the dumplings, which are pretty authentic. ?The dry fried chicken wings are also superb. ?The sweet flour noodles are pretty good as well. ?Actually, most of the dishes are a hit. ?The atmosphere and service are passable, but just come here for the food. ?As a note, they are closed on Wed. ?Perhaps, business is too good and they don't need to open that day. ?:(

We will choose Golden Rice Bowl over San Tung any day! ?Why you ask? 1- The service at San Tung is lousy. The last time we went, they stuck us in the back room... with their vacuums... and promptly forgot about us. 2- San Tung has a HUGE line, which has never been worth the wait, except maybe for their kimchi...on a good day 3- San Tung may have great reviews on their chicken and noodle dishes, but everything else failed to excite our taste buds...not to mention their beef has a funky texture. 4- Taking into account how inconsistent their food quality is (that's right! I said inconsistent...I have given this place many chances) AND their ill-mannered service, it's not worth the prices they charge. Go across the street to Golden Rice Bowl...do it...they wont miss you at San Tung...they probably never even knew you were there...

I am so sory to be the naysayer but I didn't enjoy the food. ?We ordered the chicken wings, string beans, peanut ?noodles and the hot and sour soup, all which were reported to be stand out menu items. All the spice on the wings was in the bottom of the container and they weren't salty enough. ?They were, however, ?by far the best of the four items. The noodles were overcooked and mushy with a very non-peanut dressing. ?Really not good at all. ?Bland beans and H and S soup with no beefiness rounded out this very disappointing meal. I will give it another chance as sometimes a restaurant can have an off night but if it is a repeat of this disaster, that will be my last time.

Friendly restaurant in my opinion, but if you're looking to go there for dinner, chances are you'll probably have to wait in line or write your name on a clipboard., unless you go early enough and miss the crowd. Mostly Chinese food, with a hint of Korean. If you ever go, get the chicken wings!

Their shrimp/leek dumplings were the best I've ever eaten. ?Both of my parents were from Shandong, even they agreed the dumplings were darn good. ?But recently they are just OK. ?I guess good business is hurting the quality of the dumplings.

I'm not sure if I had an off day (sunday evening) but my experience was pretty bad. The leek and shrimp won tons were pretty good. ?However the ha kau (spell?) at andy's down the street are way better. ? Skin was alright, and inside flavor combo pretty tasty. The chicken wings were pretty good. ?Not too dry, properly fried with crispy skin. ?I don't mind some sweetness but I think it was overly sweet. ?Would have been much better with less sweet and more spice. Black bean noodle dish (dry) was horrible. ?It was god awfully sweet. ?Texture of the noodles were ok, but the sauce was about as sweet as apple pie. ?I'm wondering if they confused their simple syrup bottle with their vegetable oil bottle. ?Really bizarre. Moo shu pork with "pancakes" was a bit below average. For the price I bet I could eat a lot better in the area. ?Maybe I just ordered all the wrong dishes?

Wings, dumplings, entrees very tasty! This is why there is ALWAYS a long wait to get in! I've never eaten in because although I tried to several times, I had to jostle around the front area with people elbowing/pushing me, and deal with the growing wrath of my growling stomach. Plus, if I ever ate in there, I think I would have hated it! Waiting patrons constantly staring you down to finish, crowds in the middle of aisles in between dining tables, and/or the people who are waiting so closeby your table they are basically sitting in your lap or on your dishes on the table! The restaurant definitely violates fire codes. I recommend ordering out and eating at home!! Minus 1 star because I don't think their food is consistent. Once we got dumplings which were LOADED with salt. Waaaaay too salty. Also, I suspect their food tastes so good because of MSG (and the fact that I've had after-San-Tung-meal headaches before).

Everyone orders the dry fried chicken. And why not? It's freaking awesome! Best chicken I've put in my mouth. I'm giving it a four though because the service kind of sucks. The last two times I went there, I got yelled at by waiters. I suppose it's just our Chinese ways, but still...how rude. I got yelled at for ordering by numbers instead of the names, and got yelled at for nearly ordering the wrong dish for my meal? It doesn't really make sense, but the waitress called me out for ordering the wrong dry fried chicken and told me to get the dish everyone else had. Oh well, it was still good. I also got the dry noodles with black bean sauce. DELICIOUS!

Went here with my bf, and ordered many courses to try since we heard this place was so good!! Started with veggie dumplings and pork potstickers, didn't care much for the veggie ones. The hot and sour soup was delicious, but my bf couldn't eat it since it had shrimp chunks in it and he's allergic! I've never heard of a hot and sour soup to have seafood in it, and it should be stated on the menu! We then had the mushu beef, which was amazing! The chicken chow mein was a little disappointing with big thick, blandish noodles. Overall, the food was very good and we had very attentive service! Get there early though, because it fills up fast!

The wait is INSANE but the food is DELICIOUS. Wow..basically all I see in front of this restaurant is a mob of people waiting to be seated. Many can't stand the wait for their own table so they share a large one instead. My friend and I ordered the infamous chicken wings, Mongolian beef, and string beans. Everything was SO GOOD that I forgot that I waited 30 minutes for a table. So I give this place 1 star for its fast service right when you sit down, 1 star for the dishes being piping HOT and delicious, 2 stars just for the CHICKEN WINGS!

Yes folks, the wings are really that good. Yes folks it's worth the hour long wait. I recommend buying a 24 ounce can of Budweiser from the liquor store next door, brown-bagging it and sitting outside shooting the shit while you wait for a table to open up, or there is a bar up the street, but beware, some folks will write their name under yours on the 'board' if they think you're gone. The waitstaff is, brusque as a light term, but then again they're trying to accommodate an awful lot of people. The hot n' sour soup was good too, but seriously, best dry fried wings in the entire country, not just San Francisco, but the country. It's like angels fucking. Go now. Put your name on the magical 'board,' and wait for forty five minutes outside in the wind, you will not regret it. So so good!!

The 4 stars are for their dry fried chicken wings! They taste best when they are hot and crunchy. After 2-3 wings though, the sauce gets a tad too sweet and need some rice to balance out the taste. I also tried the dry fried flounder fillet. It is basically made with the same sauce as the chicken wings. But of course, I would choose the wings any day! As for the other dishes I've tried, the noodles with peanut sauce was too sticky and was made differently than other Shanghai restaurants. The chow mein, potstickers, and dumplings are decent, nothing special. I would love to try their black bean sauce noodles though! This place is packed every single time I come in. Since it is full all the time, it is best for you to pick your time wisely or prepare for some waiting time.

Had to order the (original) dry chicken wings since they are so famous - and they were excellent - crispy, flavorful, and hot! ?The surprise of the meal, though, was the pork dumplings. ?Usually at other restaurants they taste funny (maybe because they were frozen previously?) - but the dumplings at San Tung tasted freshly made - as good as homemade! ?The dan dan noodles were a little too salty. ? The place was crowded with locals - a good sign - and a long waiting list. ?Service was ok (they were busy). ?Parking is on the street (no parking lot). Would definitely return for the wings and the dumplings!

I'm rating only one thing on the menu. DRY FRIED CHICKEN. The wings are fried perfectly without any batter or ?oil drippings. A crisp skin with DELICIOUS TO DIE FOR sweet and spicy sauce stuck ONTO every part of the wing, and then perfectly cooked chicken. Free rice, soup, and tea as usual. But there's more, even KIMCHI. ?That just pushes it over the edge. Good chicken, rice, and delicious kimchi to go with the meal. It's pretty perfect. The portion is perfect for me. A plate comes with six, I usually only finish four and my boyfriend finishes the rest. Pretty great lunch place. It could get crowded and you may have to share tables. It's a little awkward but the chicken is all worth it to me.

I admit, their chicken wing is probably the best in town. Is that enough to justify waiting in line for over an hour each time we come? NO! 2 stars down for their sucky service and 1 star down for the unreasonable long line. I think they're so successful because of their location. I've been to their other restaurant, SO, in SoMa and there is no line, food is about the same, and the price is cheaper. I've tried their handmade noodles, but it's just so-so. Nothing to rave about here.

Yep, you'll find me here every other Friday night, standing in the cold (with 10 other groups of people) waiting to get in. I usually write some random name on the waitlist just so I can hear them shout it out--it's hilarious. "HEEZY?? TABLE FOR 4!" I love the complimentary kimchi appetizer they provide while we make our selection--but I don't really have to look at the menu anymore. Dried fried chicken and mushu pork, please. Their secret ingredients are: MSG, white pepper, and cocaine; I get these major cravings.

The name San Tung refers to China's Shandong province, written with characters for "mountain", then "east, referring to its location east of the Taihang Mountains. More importantly, Shandong province is geographically close to Korea. Thus, the Korean hwagyo (Korean for overseas Chinese [in Korea], c.f. Mandarin huaqiao) family that runs San Tung serves Korean Chinese food, along with Shandong cuisine, considered the most influential of China's 8 culinary traditions. Shandong cuisine is characterized by corn, peanuts, grains, vegetables such as cabbage and sweet potato, and vinegar. You will notice on the menu the presence of Korean as well as Chinese characters, but not for every menu item, but the presence of Korean does not guarantee that it is a Korean Chinese dish; e.g., broccoli beef has a Korean translation (it's just phonetic), but well, that is a popular dish in general! Once you enter the restaurant, you might not notice the fair decor, but you will notice the happy faces of people enjoying the food. Each table gets a complimentary plate of spicy kimchi-style "suan cai" [house-marinated Chinese pickled Napa or head cabbage, aka Chinese sauerkraut], a variety of "pao cai" [Chinese pickled cabbage] common to northeastern China, such as Shandong province. The cabbage is drier than Korean kimchi, and its spiciness is felt right in the throat. The complimentary tea may help with the spiciness, but is nice in and of itself. San Tung's most famous dish, and deservedly so, is its Original Dry Fried Chicken, gan peng ji (gan) in Mandarin, ggan p'ung gi (gan) in Korean, available diced or as wings, dry or wet, $9, $6.50 as part of a lunch combo (#20). The first time I ordered these, I had them diced, to avoid the potential messiness, but this time I ordered them in wing form. And it is possible to eat them with a minimum of mess; chopsticks in one hand, and a Chinese soup spoon in the other! The chicken wings are deep fried in batter with garlic, ginger, and roasted red peppers to produce the most succulent, sweet, savory, and spicy meat you might ever taste. They're addictive! In deep-frying before stir-frying (peng), foods are deep-fried in very hot oil until cooked. Then the excess oil is poured out and a sauce which, unlike slippery-frying, does not contain cornstarch is added. The dish is stir-fried for a few moments to blend the ingredients before being served. Dishes prepared this way are crisp outside and tender inside, with each morsel covered in a velvety sauce. Dry indicates that before being deep-fried, the food is covered in cornstarch (corn flour). My 2nd entree is a dish that I've had both times that I've had lunch here: three deluxe spicy sauce noodles, Shandong jiang mian in Mandarin, Sandong myeon in Korean. This dish is stir-fried shrimp, calamari, scallops, diced zucchini, and onions in a spicy sauce served over homemade noodles, $8.50. ?Such a good dish. We had some vegetables to round out the meal: black mushrooms with baby bok chow [sic][aka bok choy, bai cai], $7.50, donguu [aka shiitake] cai xin in Mandarin, beoseot yach'ae bokkeum in Korean, fresh baby bok chow and whole black mushrooms tossed in a garlic sauce. Perfect and yummy. I did eye some off-the-menu dou miao [pea sprouts] at another table that looked tempting. One of the other best dishes I recommend, which I had the first time I had lunch at San Tung, is the shrimp and leek dumplings, $7.25, xiaren jiucai shuijiao in Mandarin, saewu mul mandu in Korean, 12 little dumplings filled with a savory mixture of ginger and garlic infused ground shrimp and Chinese chives. Service is fair, but the food is really good and inexpensive! Some of the other Korean Chinese dishes worth trying are: the black bean sauce noodles (dry or wet) (zha jang myeon), the combo spicy soup noodles (samseon zam bbon), the San Tung chicken, the sweet and sour pork with brown sauce, and the San Tung house shrimps (whole). Whatever you order, ?the awesome food here is likely to make you a wing nut, despite the lines outside the door!

I've been coming here since I was young with the fam. Only standout in my mind is the fried chicken (bone-in). Crispy skin with moist meat, sweet and spicyish flavor and a decent portion. This restaurant is one of those strange Chinese-ish Korean/Korean-ish Chinese hybrid places that is hard to describe. It's definitely not authentic middle-of-China or Korea-Korean food if that's what you're looking for and it's more Chinese than Korean. Standard dishes like broccoli beef taste about as good as what you will find elsewhere in SF and the steamed pork dumplings are good but are not something you haven't tried before (sorry for the double negatives), and I honestly think my dad makes better but these will do. The wait's here are really ridiculous, I try to come at odd hours. I think the wait is just for the chicken. It's not face-melting spicy and not sugary-sweet either so it suits most palates. Just try it, most people love it (including me). The kimchi is too sweet for my Korean side but I still like it for what it is. Attentive service and casual atmosphere. Good luck with parking if you come at dinnertime...

Don't mind general noisy family-style get-in-there-elbows-chopsticks-and-all eating? Then this place is fabulous. ?Get there early (like 5:30 pm for dinner!) unless you want to wait outside the restaurant in a long line of people salivating over the thought of DRY FRY CHICKEN. ?Yes, you must order the dry fry chicken. ?When I went there the first time with my friend John B., we ordered that dish because everyone's tables had it, and we pointed and said, "We'll have that." ?Suffice it to say that ?I am addicted to dry fry chicken like a drug addict is addicted to crack. ?Hot, sweet, spicy, crisp, and gooey all at the same time. ?Oh, and their noodles are hand-pulled, potstickers fat and lovely. ?Serivce is no-nonsense but friendly. ?They don't pamper you there with anything but the food. ?I even saw the chef from Singapore Malaysia eating there with his family one time. ?That's foodie cred.

WOW! One of the best restaurants in San Francisco. I always get fried vegetarian potstickers, and the veggie mushu. On occasion, I will order the hand-pulled vegetarian noodles. So delicious! My family always orders the fried chicken wings with the sauce on the side...which I use for my potstickers. The wait is usually pretty long unless you go an hour or two before noon for lunch, and at 5 for dinner. YUM! You have to try this place at least once in your life. You will not be disappointed.

THE WAIT IS RIDICULOUSLY LONG! On the average, the wait is about 45 minutes...BUT it is DEFINITELY WORTH THE WAIT!!!! They're famous for their dried fried chicken wings (it's spicy), potstickers, dumplings, black bean sauce noodles & string beans. I brought some of my friends who are picky eaters here, and they loved it. Well, if anything, the chicken wings are a must! (So there's wings and there's boneless, I personally think that the boneless isn't worth it because all you're eating is lumps of fried flour? The wings are LEGITLY EPIC.) Warning that parking is also hard to find. Overall, it's a place you must go to and try for yourself :)

those dry chicken wings bro, it lived up to the hype from yelpers. Looks like nothing special, looks simple, but boy that bite was amazing. The flavors in the wings, and outside was good. The sweet flavor was good. tasted really good, skin was really good. Once you eat these wings, you wont be able to stop, that how good it was. Finger licking good. I got 24 for 21 or 20 dollars plus tax. 12 wings for 9 dollars. i got some for my dad, and he like i tasted this before, and he said it was ok, when my dad said something ok, he means it pretty good, his mind told him to say something, but his mouth, and fingers was non stopping gobbling, and grabbing those delicious ?wings XD

wow, yelpers really dig this place! no wonder because I have not had a ?bad dish here. one dish that was not mentioned yet but is very well done here is the sliced pork with preserved mustard green soup noodles. the pork is lean and flavorful; the noodles are housemade; the preserved veggies are slightly salty and the broth is delish! the ULTIMATE comfort food served steaming hot and the perfect solution for days like today (post hail/snow in SF area)! gotta love the housemade kim chi too! not too much fire and more vinegary and sweet than the standard Korean version.

OK ... I really don't know what the rave was all about. ?I decided to check this place out based on the good reviews and the huge amount of people waiting in line to eat at this place. Let me start off by saying that I've lived in Taiwan for 3 years ... and I am originally from Houston, Texas where the Taiwanese and Shan Dong cuisine is actually quite decent. This place did not taste authentic at all. ?C'mon ... fried chicken wings is there specialty dish? ?I thought we were talking about Chinese food here. ?Being named "San Tung" ... I was expecting some awesome noodles and dumplings. ?The pan fried dumplings were more like deep fried ... and while they weren't horrible ... they were average at best and definitely not Shan Dong style. ?The noodles were also average and nothing to rave about. ?The food here felt very Americanized to me. ?So ... if you are looking for some Americanized Chinese fast food ... this might be the joint for you. ?But if you really know what good Zha Jiang Mian, Niu Rou Mian, or Jiao Zi are supposed to taste like ... skip out on this place. ?The hunt for a good place to get the previously mentioned dishes continues. ?Seems like the bay area definitely has a shortage of good Chinese food that isn't Cantonese ... i.e. Taiwanese, Shanghainese, Shan Dong etc.

It's so nice to visit SF during mid-weekdays, when traffic is relatively lighter, more available parking, and best of all... no lines. The first time I ate here with my wife's family, it was during peak weekend hours and the wait was bitterly atrocious. This time around, we were gnawing on their famous "dried fried chicken" in no time. It's flash fried and drenched in a very sweet glaze that, frankly, reminded me of the notorious orange chicken (gasp). But it's just too good to resist, and I found myself enjoying the wings more than the boneless variety. I dig the noodle dishes, as they use the same type of flat noodle that gives just enough chewiness. The black bean noodles can be pretty overpowering with the sauce, and the five spice beef noodle soup was hearty. But my favorite would have to be their dumplings. Slather on some hot chili and soy sauce, and you just about have yourself the perfect food.

I heard a lot about San Tung's famous fried chicken wings (dry). So, some of my friends and I gave it a try last night. When we entered the small, crowded restaurant, we wrote our name on the waiting list, and were seated within 15-20 minutes. The chicken wings were pretty good - crispy on the outside and more meat on the inside compared to other chicken wings I've tried. Kudos for the chicken wings, but none for our waiter. It seemed like he didn't enjoy working at this restaurant, and as if he were annoyed to take our order. Boo! He made us feel rushed. There was nothing special about our other dishes - wet jja jjang myun (black bean sauce noodles), mu shu (pork), and chow mein. They tasted like any other normal, greasy, cheap, Chinese fast food. Our entire meal for five people was under $90. I felt sick the next morning, but it was probably because I ate too many of those great tasting chicken wings! This would be a great place to bring a bunch of hungry friends and feast on some tasty chicken wings together.

yes, their dry fried chicken wings are really good. ?i am a huge fan of their fried potstickers too and i normally don't like thick skinned potstickers. but this reminds me of old style hk/macau potsticker stands on the street where you pay $1 or $2 hkd/patacas for a potsticker on the walk back home after school. yes, and i ate all 6 myself, not in 1 sitting though. maybe it was an off day for their green beans, because some were pretty brittle. i am eager to come back to try the boil leek and pork dumplings. but fo sho gotta come early. even though our 2 person wait wasn't bad on a saturday afternoon around 2pm, it was still scary when you walk up and there are around 20 people standing outside waiting. who knows when you'll get a table.

After hearing from everyone to go here for the chicken wings, and of course, checking Yelp, I finally got around to going to San Tung. ?I have to give this place five stars just for the dry chicken wings! We got two orders, and tore them up! ?We ordered family style and got Pork fried rice, pork dumplings, string beans, sizzling rice soup, and of course, the chicken wings! ?It was poppin' even at 2 pm on a Saturday (late lunch). ?However, we got seated relatively quickly. ?We had a party of five, and only two of us were there. ?They seated us in the back room, and were not too pleased that we waited for other members for 20 minutes. ?Despite this, they were friendly, and our waiter recommended that many people order the string beans for a vegetable dish. ?I can't wait to go back to eat here! ?Next family din din will definitely be at San Tung! ?For the five of us, it was $12/person, not bad at all!

Once you get the boneless fried chicken, nothin else in life matters anymore. The flavor was on point and the meat was cooked perfect where its not dry. The sizzling rice soup is also good. Its hard to find an asian restaurant where the soup doesnt taste fresh. The soup was so good that I ate a bowl went back to the chicken another bowl more chicken. Then had the walnut prawns and then another bowl of the shrimp. Okay I ate the chicken crumbs too, dont judge! Haha. This is prob my new fave chinese place. However service was pretty whack. If you missed the chance at calling your waiter it was pretty much now or never. You pretty much need to yell and waive your hands to get their attention. Our waiter did not seem to like us very much. Not that we gave him a reason to dislike us but he just seemed angry. What did we ever do to you?! We payin your bills bro! Anyways you also receive free kimchi. Holla.

I've eaten here a few times and I ate here last night again w/ a friend who was craving noodles. San Tung does have very tasty noodles. My favorite is the Noodles in Peanut Sauce. It's sweet and spicy and is mixed w/ lots of shrimp and veggies. They make their noodles fresh too so you get the springy texture that you can't find in the packaged stuff. Like everyone else here, I also heart the Dry Fried Chicken but I prefer the wings over the diced chicken b/c the meat stays moist when cooked on the bone. This place is super good and super cheap. I hate the waiting process though and their waiting area isn't big at all. It wasn't so bad last night but it was Monday. They do, however, give you the option of sharing a large table w/ other small parties of 2 or 3 and it's a typical practice for restaurants in Hong Kong. It's not a big deal to me b/c I'm usually starving by the time I arrive and the faster I get to sit down, the better but I can see how some pple wouldn't like it.

almost feels useless to write another review about this place. its great, if you hadn't tried it, you're missing out big time. this place is so crowded, even at 530PM. insane. they do take reservations tho which is a plus. we usually go in big groups so we get to order everything and eat everything. chicken wings, both wet and dry are good. shreded pork with garlic sauce is yummy, hot and sour soup is way better than any chinese place! the dumplings are real good too, we usually get the shrimp and leeks, i personally LOVE THE COLD NOODLES. dry fried fish is awesome too, its the sauce, i think. green beans are awesome too, we get so much food i usually just skip the rice. this place is real cheap too, order a table filled with food and the bill comes to barely a $100. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED if hadn't tried yet!

I used to come here every week with the fam. Yes, it was that good. But the crowds got to us and we stopped coming. Just went back a few days ago and it's still as great as before. The killer lines are still the same. The chicken wings are a must get! The lemon chicken, string beans, and noodles are just as good. You pretty much can't go wrong when ordering from there. Family style, loud chatter, and cheap prices makes this a true Chinese restaurant!

this review is just for the dry fried chicken wings, which are truly amazing! on the outside they are super crispy and have a sweet taste to them. the chicken itself is so juicy and tender. i must say, they have some the best fried chicken i've tasted thus far. i'll definitely be back again for them!

MMMMMM. ?So this is one of those places that I would have never gone in to unless I was brought there by one of my Asian friends. ?Call me closed minded, but I just wouldn't have felt comfortable. ?Now that I have been there I might go back alone, but probably not. ?Anyway, with that aside the food was great. ?We got a spicy dried fried beef dish that was so flavorful and then a chicken noodle dish. ? They were both very flavorful. ?Overall our bill for two (very full patrons) came to $16.??. ?The decor and service are nothing to write home about, but for good Chinese food on a budget that place should make the list of places to check out.

Get there good and early because the wait is kind of sucky (mostly cause you don't have anything to do while you wait). Also when you get there immediately write your name on the board by the door to hold your place in line(I learned that the hard way). My friends and I ordered family style, which I recommend. We ordered string beans (which were a tad spicy, soooo good), black bean (dry) noodles (it was a bit salty though. I just remember not really liking it that much), white rice (a bad choice cause we already ordered noodles, but good rice), calamari, pot stickers, and the star of the evening, the wet chicken wings. I know you've probably heard from other reviewers that the dry wings are the BEST, but I disagree, the wet fried wings...oh man, I could eat those forever; they're too good. I gave four stars because not everything was like delicious delicious. But if I were judging on the wet wings alone, I'd give a 10 if I could.

Twice I've asked for dry chicken and we get chicken with thick syrup. Don't know if I should emphasize on "wet" and get dry. That would be the next experiment. The chicken wings are very tender. Everything is fresh. Love the dumplings. ?Love the Kim Chee. First bite is like "too spicy." Second bite and third bite is like "just right" and you can't have enough of it until the food comes and you have to ignore it. The service is quick and to the point. We were told no special veggies, only whats on the menu. Side Commentary to the guys staring us and rude commentary on our eating the pig ears. The restaurant is quite cozy; you sit next to people, but you still get your space. Rude comments can be heard. We all pay to enjoy a meal out now and then and we are not there to hear how someone who doesn't eat pigs see other people eat pigs. Next time, guys, go some where else or keep your comments to yourself.

If you eat chicken, then you will LOVE this place. I love chicken, so i love this place. However, most of the other things on their menu are average and nothing worth noting. If you dont plan to get the ORIGINAL DRY FRIED CHICKEN WINGS, then i strongly advise not to eat here. You can find better chinese food elsewhere. Im sick of reading reviews with 1 or 2 stars with people saying that they didnt try the wings. That being said, ORDER THE WINGS OR DONT GO! THANKS! :-)

This restaurant is overrated. The food is good but it's not that good. Come on! I didn't think it was worth the wait. I miss its sister restaurant, So's, for the dried fried chicken wings. Miss you So's!! Now I guess this is the only place to get it. I've been here several times and the food was nothing spectacular, especially not for a 1 hour plus wait. At least you can go to Yummy Yummy next door for a back up plan. Are you really going to give this place 5 stars for one great dish?

definitely the best northern chinese restaurant in the city! ?everyone raves about their dry-fried chicken, but there's something to be said about their dry-fried beef. ?the shrimp & leek dumplings make a great appetizer, and the ja jyan mien (black bean sauce noodles) are a standard. while most of their ingredients are good quality, the dishes tend to be a bit heavy with the sauce. ?and the service is not exactly friendly, although what can you expect when the place is always so packed.

My boyfriend and I got food poisoning after eating their Kungpao Chicken, Fried fish with spicy sauce, Mongolian beef, and dumplings. We went there around 7:30 and as we arrived home and finished watching movie around 12:00, we started to feel nausea followed by severe vomiting and diarrhea. It was so severe that I almost slept in front of my toilet. It was the worst nightmare I have ever experienced in my life. What it represents is the uncleanliness of the restaurant. My boyfriend is still feeling a little nausea and body sourness. It was October 30th that we went and thank you for the dirty food of the restaurant, we are not going to be able to enjoy our Halloween day even after long preparation... I seriously think the restaurant should close. Stop harming people's health!

after looking at the other reviews, i guess i'm not the only one who knows about the chicken wing of san tung. ?i was first introduced to their poultry when a friend invited me to a giants game last year. ?she brought each of us a box of these chicken wings to the game to eat, and i had to restrain from looking with disdain. ?but she bought the ticket, so i let myself ?face the potential stares of mockery from the bleacher creatures. ?or at minimum, i expected quizzical flashes from the neighbors. ?it's baseball by the way. ?hot dogs, peanuts, pretzels, and beer. ?get 'em here. ?but alas, i forget i'm watching baseball in san francisco. ?a city where it's all good. ? with a ballpark that boasts free wi-fi. ?if anything, as i grinded into those delectable wings, it was an air of envy which surrounded me. ?i forgot who won the game.

ok this place is a very busy place plan to wait a bit for a table. its typical chinese service. not too friendly but the food is good. everybody comes for their chicken though. i prefer the fried chicken wet and peanut sauce noodles. the last time we were there, the male owner was yelling in chinese from the kitchen door. he seemd drunk or sick or on something. everybody in the restaurant was looking like "wtf?" and none of the workers looked at him or acknowledged him. he yelled nonsense for about 15 minutes. i was talking to the guys at the next table and i said he sounded like SLOTH from the goonies!!! and they agreed!!! id come back just for the chicken. in and out thats it. not a dining experience though.

i remember going to this restaurant before it got so frigging popular. and it's still so crowded every night of the week. the best bet is to go super freaking early and wait in line or go right before they close! the reason i love this place is cuz of the dumplings which remind me of what mom makes. totally worth paying the $6 instead of buying all of the ingredients and doing it yourself. of course the dried fried chicken and string beans are favourites.

I came to San Tung's with my father on a weekday night hoping to eat their chicken wings. We had to wait around half an hour before we were actually seated which sucked because it was extremely cold outside. When we were seated, we received a complimentary dish of Kimchi. Free food is always a win in my book. We ordered the dry fried chicken, dry fried founder fillet and white rice. We're trying to eat healthy therefore we didn't order another plate of chicken. I absolutely love the chicken and the fish. The only difference between the two was the fact that one dish was fish and the other was chicken. I don't know what's in the sauce and I don't really care as long as it's in my belly. Even though it was just the two of us, we finished both dishes because it was that delicious. I even put the leftover sauce on top of my rice so I didn't waste anything. I can get pretty disgusting at times. It's all good though, I would come back to try their other dishes as well. That was a lie, I would come back for more chicken.

This place is awesome. Seriously delicious food. I grew up around chinese food, and this is some of the best I've ever had. Be warned now, there is a line, come at the wrong time, and you may be waiting an hour. Ok lets start from the beginning. Once you sit down, they hand you a plate of Kim Chi. This isn't your ordinary kimchi that you get from Korean places, this is better. The cabbage crunches, there is less vinegar, and the spicy kicks in 20 seconds after you take a bite. Normally I eat like one or two pieces of kimchi, but here we asked for like three plates. ?We also go dumplings which were big and hearty and string beans that were very flavorful. But really, the chicken wings are the things that stick in my mind when i think of this place. Next, the chicken wings here are to die for. They are so good, I saw black people... and chinese, vietnamnese, and white people eating it :D It is universally delicious. Even my buddy who lives in oakland chinatown would drive out to SF just to eat here. Highly recommended, I will be coming back

Every weekend night you can walk by San Tung and there are at least 20 asian folk hanging out in front of the restaurant. ?I noticed this on several occasions when I lived on Irving and 17th and would think to myself ?"any chinese food place with a line of asians out the door must be pretty damn good" (note: ?i judge dim sum joints the same way). ?So one night I finally forced myself to wait in the line to see why in the hell all these people would wait to eat here. ?I soon found out. ?My boyfriend at the time and I had the waiter order for us. ?All I remember are the deep fried chicken wings. ?I know that all the food we ate was tasty, but the chicken wings are the most memorable part of the meal. ?These are BY FAR THE BEST CHICKEN WINGS I HAVE EVER HAD IN MY LIFE!!!!! ?Perfectly deep fried with ginger spicy goodness....OMG my mouth is watering just thinking of them. ?Ever since this dining experience, I will go buy an order of chicken wings and eat them all to myself. ?I'm selfish, whatevs.

Enter the restaurant. Immediately turn right and jot your name on the white board w/ the number of pple in your party. Do not pass go. Do not wait to be helped. ?Always seems to be a line here and you do not want to wind up hungry as you watch everyone eat their food. ?Waiting area is virtually non-existant. ?So if its cold out, make sure to put on some extra deodorant and be prepared to get a l'il friendly w/ your neighbor. ?Tried most of their specialties (except the wings). Hot and Sour soup is good, not the best but i'd give it a 8.5 out of 10. ?Was not impresssed w/ the pork dumplings (FYI, there was white vinegar at the table Miss H.) - think i'd rather go back to LA for some of those at Dragon Mark. ?Then had the Jia Jiang mien (#6 on the menu I believe). ?It was really good :-D ?2nd best in my book. ?Very flavorful and lots of good meats that you could bite into. ?I think next time I want to try it dry though, sauce was a bit too runny for my tastes. ?Prices are pretty decent htough. ?$30 for all of that plus an order of spinach w/ garlic that was reaaaaaaaaally fresh and yummy.

a big thank you to all the yelpers who alerted me to their dry fried chicken wings. ?they were sweet and extremely tasty. ?sabrina l & i polished off 1 order after a day in which she & i ate: ?chinese egg tarts in chinatown, duck sandwich, lobster burger, & 2 desserts at the ferry building, sorbet at marco's, and a full course meal at the range. ?that's right, be afraid, be very afraid...i mean for my health. ?really. ?is there a yelp doctor in the house?

Now I know why they call it "crack chicken". ?I had my first taste last night and I'll be back again today. ?Even after the last wing is gone you'll be rubbing your glazed fingers on your gums in an attempt to maintain your sugar high. ?Left a box of em in my fridge for a day and the sauce completely crystallized into rock candy. ?Not great "Chinese chicken wings", but rather, great chicken wings...period. ?Ever wonder why all the Japanese and Chinese restaurants in the city are owned by Koreans? ?I'll tell you why: It's a formula for mainstream success. ?If you feel no need to preserve a particular cuisine then you are completely comfortable adapting flavors to appeal to the taste to the widest audience possible. ?Don't hate. ?Diane told me that ?"Santung" is actually a region of China that borders Korea, so the menu makes more sense than you'd intially think. ?Keep an eye on the dry erase board to make sure your name doesn't disappear from the queue.

the fried chicken wings were highly recommended at this place so we decided to go here for the first time. i was thinking how good can fried chicken be at a chinese restaurant? but after trying it, it was damn good! we got the dry chicken wings, and we were confused because it had a sauce over it and looked wet. but the wet one actually has even more sauce on it and has bamboo shoots and other stuff with it. the sauce on it was super good and it sort of resembles the spicy angel wings that we love at Marnee Thai. we also got the pork dumplings, which was just ok. then we got the black been noodles or something like that (2nd noodles dish) and it was pretty good. we also got the five spice beef noodles soup and that was really good too. the noodles here are made very well and are definitely worth trying.

I won't bore you with raves about the dry fried chicken but remember to order it DRY which makes no sense since it's wet with delicious yummy sauce. I always forget but the wait staff always ask twice when I mistakenly order it wet. But I digress. ?Most of the other dishes hit the spot but for some reason my two favorites that stand out are the garlic string beans (I'm not a veggie person, so go figure) and the mongolian beef. ?I'm always on the look out for good mongolian beef and this one is different from my ideal but for some reason I still love it. ?Get there at 5:30 to beat the rush or get there at 8:30 to avoid waiting. ?Final criteria for Chinese food: check out the diners; if it's mostly Asian/Chinese people it's gotta be good!

Came here for lunch around 1pm and still took about 30 min to get a table. Totally worth it. Everything you have read about the chicken wings are true. They are fabulous. Also got the black bean sauce noodles, peanut sauce noodles, fried flounder with the same sauce as the fried chicken, shrimp and leek dumplings, pork potstickers and green string beans. The flounder was pretty good but nothing that knocked my socks off. I'm not a huge fan of the black bean sauce noodles but they were really good here. ?The noodles were a bit overcooked but not mushy. The shrimp and leek dumplings tasted great. ?Just like my mom would make. The outside tasted like hand made dough. The string beans were fried and then the sauce from the chicken was added. ?That sauce is just really good. ?The pork potstickers weren't as crunchy as I usually like. ?The inside filling was pretty good but could have been a bit more flavorful. ?The peanut sauce noodles were just ok. ?Not much flavor at all to them. ?I won't order it again. ?I heard the seafood noodles are obsolutely fantastic. ?I will definitely want to try it next time I come here. ?The service here was efficient and they didn't have a scowl on their face when you asked for more kimchi. ?Highly recommended and I plan on taking my parents here. ?They are chinese food snobs and I'm pretty sure they will like this place.

So it's been a while since I've eaten here. My sister and niece e-mailed me sometime last week and told me that they wanted to treat me for lunch today (Sunday) for my birthday (it was on Tuesday the 1st). We planned on going somewhere else, but that restaurant was going to be closed today in observance of the Labor Day Holiday weekend. So my sister asked me if there was someplace else I haven't eaten at in a while, I thought of San Tung. Actually, I forgot the name of the restaurant and only remembered their spicy dry fried chicken....Mmmm. To remember only the name of the dish and not the restaurant can only tell you how yummy this dish is. We decided to get there before 12 Noon, since we knew it would get crowded by then. We go there a little after 11:30 a.m. after circling around three times looking for parking. The restaurant was packed, but fully packed since we were able to get a table as soon as we walked into the restaurant. Mmmm...you could just smell the chicken. We ordered the dry fried chicken wings (you can also order them boneless), the black bean sauce noodles, friend vegetarian potstickers, steamed rice and shrimp won ton soup. My grand nephew who was also with us ate the soup, while the rest of us devoured the other dishes. We've never had the black bean sauce noodles the other times we ate there and we ended-up enjoying this dish. It was delish and especially our chicken wings, which were tasty, spicy, and crispy. We've always wondered how they stayed crispy even drenched with the sauce. Needless to say, we devoured everything as I said and left the restaurant full and satisfied. What a tasty meal =)...yummy. Oh, I forgot to mention and how could I forget...the Kim Chee at the beginning of the meal. That was gone in a couple of minutes =D.

hmmmmm....where do i even begin? ?i took my parents to san tung on a sunday night. ?after reading all these reviews, i was super excited to try the food. ?We got there at 6:10pm. ?Waited for a good hour before we got seated. ?This place is crazy packed! ?some people even had to share tables. ?awkward much? ?After getting seated we put in our order. ?We had the sizzling rice soup, which i very much recommend. ?However, it takes a long time to prepare the soup, so you have to wait a little longer for your main entrees if you do decided to order it. ?I thought the dried fried chicken was just okay. ?It is literally overrated! ? everyone at every single table had at least one order of their famous chicken. ?i ordered two. ?I got the one with bones and the other diced. ?Like I had said previously, it was just okay. ?We also had the honey walnut prawns, they overdid it with the mayonaise. ?I heard that the beef fried rice was a great dish as well, but also...to greasy for my taste. ?We had a feast! ?We also ordered half a duck, and that I felt was too dry. ?The dried calmari was decent. ?And the beef and broccoli was pretty good. And you never go to chinese restaurants for service...with that said, i think this place is over hyped. but then again...maybe it's just me, i've had chinese food all my life, and quite frankly, I'm just not a fan of it. with that said, my favorite dish out of the 8 or 9 we ordered was the sizzling rice soup. ?try that if you plan on going to san tung!

Finally! I've been wanting to go here for so long and we finally went today for lunch around noon on a saturday. They were busy but when are they not? The place was very nosy and we waited almost 5 mins for a table for four which is not long at all. Since the place is not very big the tables and chairs were very close together so that does not leave much room between your table and the next. I didnt care too much though. I was there for the dry chicken wings! We ordered seaweed soup, chow mein, steamed pot stickers, and dry chicken wings. The seaweed soup was on the salty side and the chicken wings had a few drumsticks thrown in which was nice. I was not impressed with the chow mein or the pot stickers. I would not really want to order those again. The only dish that stood out was the dry chicken wings. I had high expectations for them coming in and they sure met them! They truly are the best chicken wings I've ever had! I want to try the dumplings next time. My friend said the dishes are cheaper at lunch during the week opposed to during the evenings and weekends. I will be back!

Normally I would ding a restaurant for slow service AND I love San Tung's food too much to even do that. Food can sometimes take a while to get to the table and the wait is almost always long. (Make sure to show up by 5:30ish to get a spot right away.) I always get the same awesome dishes. Pork and leek dumplings, black bean cold noodles, fried chicken wings. All to die for. The noodles are fresh, not dried. I've tried a bunch of their other dishes and I've never been disappointed.

would give them a 4 except i lost my appetite when i noticed our waiter had a red puffy eye oozing with pus. ?yuck. ?don't know if it's contagious or not but it looks gross and you shouldn't be handling food like that. chicken wings were crunchy with a good sauce. ?black bean noodles: sauce was bland, texture was good. ?kung pao chicken: standard. ?gyozas: oversized, not crunchy enough. ?mongolian beef: ok. ?hot n sour soup: good. like the rest. ? to me the food was standard. i prefer house of nanking, R& G lounge, andys for take out, and yuet lee. they were packed when we got there monday night at 830. waited over half an hour.

DRY FRIED CHICKEN!!! ?My sister has been ranting and raving about this until I finally decided to try it last year, which means I'm due for another visit soon! ?The sauce is so good and the chicken so crispy and tender. ?This place gets pretty busy at dinnertime so expect a line out the door or people scrunched by the entrance. ?You should write your name on a dry erase board by the door once you come in. ?That's their waiting list. ?Sometimes it gets so full that if you're a smaller party, they will just seat you at a larger table with other small parties. ?The place is pretty busy during dinner but lunchtime is not bad. ?The soup is a little bland, but you can't deny the goodness of the dry fried chicken. ?That's all you really have to eat here to be happy.

4.5 stars. One of my local favorite Chinese places - we've been doing take out since the wait is long if you don't get there early. I've tried a bunch of stuff on the menu, but always always get the dumplings - luscious morsels of heaven! Pork are my favorite, shrimp and leek are good (gives you garbage smelling burps), and their potstickers. MuShu chicken is usually a staple too, but by the time i got to the kitchen to get my food after putting baby to sleep my hubby ate all the pancakes..."oh, i thought everyone got one, so I ate 2". Dry fried string beans tonight, but their spinach is good too. Good homemade noodles too. People rave about the dry fried chicken, which i think is good, but I've said it before, Marnee Thai's fried chicken easily tops it, IMHO :). MMMmmm! i'm looking forward to lunch leftovers tomorrow!

My other favorite dishes are the hot & sour soup, pork dumplings, mu shu, and cashew chicken.

I probably would have given this 4 stars but then I went to Yummy Yummy next door and that was so much better. This is ok - but not special enough to go back.

Specializing in shandong food (dumplings), the verdict on San Tung is similar to that for House of Nanking -- solid, tasty food that owes as much to the food as to the hole-in-the-wall-esque uniqueness of regional food.

I can't comment on the meat dishes as I'm a pescatarian, but their shrimp and leek dumplings are delicious, their vegetarian noodle soup broth has a wonderful flavor and the noodles are perfectly cooked. I thought the seafood in their three ingredients (shrimp, scallops, squid) in a light garlic sauce was also very good. I was not impressed with the vegetarian dumplings though. ?Good, but not even very good. ?Overall, maybe we ordered wrong. There were only two of us and it was our first time there. ?Next time, we'll try other things on the menu.

I have been coming here since i was but a child. I remember the day my cousin threw a hissy fit and locked herself in the bathroom in this restaurant. I was enjoying my dumplings, fried chicken, and ja jiang mien, all delicious in their own ways. The management was beginning to become very angry at our party because other customers had to use the bathroom. I minded my own business and enjoyed their tasty fried green beans. I came back many more times, but i started to realize that all the other "San Tung" dumpling restaurants were going out of business and this one was practically the only one left. They eventually raised their prices and their lines kept growing and growing. I don't come back very much anymore, because although their food is delicious, the service has become way too messy and the lines are way too ridiculous, my saving grace now in this district is another restaurant just 2 doors down! You'll have to read my next review to see what restaurant that is! -1 point for sloppiness and the ridiculous lines... oh, and parking can suck sometimes too.

this is my favorite chinese place in san francisco. you dont go there for the decor or the ambiance but for the excellent food that is consistently good. in fact it's so consistently good that you may have to wait. it's worth it though. it's the kind of place that makes people who are used to ubiquitous average corner spots reconsider pushing chinese food to the bottom of their food list. highly recommended!

One of my favorite chinese places to eat in San Francisco. I have been going there for years and I keep on going despite the long wait.Since I have been a long time customer though, the owner of the place recognizes my face and is always friendly and upbeat. I can understand however, how people may be a little bit frustrated by thier service, but you must understand that this place gets very busy and all the waiters seem as if they are a bit overwhelmed by it all. Honestly, who goes into a chinese restaurant like this and actually expects good service?!?!?!?!? The prices are great and the food is delicious. You can never go wrong with thier chicken wings and thier five spice noodle soup. Thier peanut sauce noodles are excellent as well. The mere fact that they give free chinese fusion type kim chee makes this place five star worthy! Beware of the lack of parking though..

I don't know what the big deal is about this place. Everytime I eat at one of my fave restaurants, Yummy Yummy, which is just two doors away, I see hoards of people outside this place waiting for a table. Why? I have no idea. My first and only time coming here was over a year ago- it was in the afternoon so it wasn't busy at all, yet we had horrible service. The waiter was rude and the food was far from the best. We had the chicken wings, which were bland and not crispy. The other entrees we got tastes better at to-go places. IMO, this place overrated and just plain bad.

If you go to San Tung for dinner, especially on the weekend, you are going to wait for a table. And you'll likely be waiting outside in the cold Inner Sunset air, so bring a jacket. While you wait you might get to watch the Chinese cooks squatting in the neighboring doorway smoking cigarettes and looking authentic. Once you're finally seated you will almost certainly be super hungry due to the long wait, so grab a chopstick full of kimchi and settle in. Most of the menu is solid and after perhaps two or three visits you'll have a very good idea of what to eat. You can listen to other people's suggestions for dishes if you are the impatient type. But then again if you're impatient, you might not last the wait for a table... (more room for the rest of us)

Can't see that San Tung deserves the high rating it has. Was there in a group of 8 last night. Yes, the dry fried chicken wings are special, but everything else was pretty ho-hum. Of dishes that others have mentioned: the hot and sour soup was different and good, but lacking in both the hot and sour departments; the dumplings were good, but nothing special; ?the sauteed green beans are worth ordering. We also ordered a pork in garlic sauce and a beef in oyster sauce. The sauces were indistinguishable and heavy on the garlic, without other discernable flavors. The pork dish was advertised as hot, and indeed had a couple of dried chilies in the sauce, but they must have been there for presentation since they added nothing to the flavor - heat level was 0.

I was really excited about trying this place after walking down Irving street and seeing it packed with Chinese people. ?My friend drove up from Sunnyvale and we ordered the shrimp dumplings, the wet dry fried chicken (diced), and seafood noodle soup. ?The dumplings came first, they were wonderfully juicy; my only complaint was that the shrimp was overcooked and there was very little of it (four stars), the chicken came next (sweet, sticky, good, but not astounding...tastes pretty much like any fried chicken in a sweet sauce that you can find in pretty much any Chinese restaurant), and then the seafood noodle soup...horrible. ?The noodles were cooked well, the broth was totally bland, the vegis and the seafood was overcooked. ?All in all, it was underwhelming.

There are so many great reviews of San Tung already...I will just add that the dry fried chicked wings are addictive, the dumplings are delicious and the service is fast. I usually just order the above items with soup and call it a dinner!

I usually get takeout because I can't bear to eat three orders of wings all by myself, publicly. ?Home made noodles, the dumplings, the beans....oh dear, I may have just drooled on my keyboard. ?Any place where I am willing to drive 30 mins from home, battle for parking and spend $80 on enough food for 10 people (that alas, only 2 of us are going to consume) HAS to be the best place on earth.

Although I hate the wait at San Tung, there is a reason. They are very good. This is currently our favorite sunset Chinese Restaurant (that is inner or outer sunset). We never had a dish we didn't enjoy. We have had the yummy dumplings (pork & chive), fried chicken wings, mu shu pork, several fish dishes, garlic green beans, sweet and sour pork and the chicken. We often take out town guests here and they all seem to really enjoy it (especially the younger ones).

Dried fried chicken wings are amazing. I went here on a Thursday night and it was a bit of a wait (maybe 30 minutes) but well worth it. Everything I ate was delicious, especially the chicken wings. We ended up ordering a second plate torwards the end of our meal because we couldn't get enough.

Like everyone else, I looooove the wings here. The many kinds of noodles are pretty good too. The servers are pretty nice, but the place IS really busy most of the time, so service isn't perfect. The prices can also be a little high for the food you get, but no matter - I still think this place is worth repeat visits!

Love this place. The Combination fried rice is very yummy. But what makes this place one of the best are of course what everyone here talks about: the dry/wet chicken wings! Deelicious. ?We take ours to go because this place can get very packed. ?Mmmm the dry calamari is so good as well.

Been coming to San Tung for about 10 years, and while the chicken wings are good, the noodles in peanut sauce are SPECTACULAR! ?Great flavor, big chunks of seafood, and you get the same exact dish every time you order it. ?There's usually a wait, and parking can be rough, but it's San Francisco, whatever. ?i love San Tung!

My husband and I were in SF last weekend. We read all the good reviews about this place from yelp, so we gave it a try. It was Saturday dinner and we had to wait for 40 min. for the table. As a Korean person, I liked the Black bean noodle(Jja jang myun) since the owner is Chinese Korean and I grew up loving this and they didn't disappoint me. My husband-white American-liked the Dry Chicken wings, but too sweet for a Korean like me. Shrimp and Leek dumpling was just OK. Overall the food was more than average. Then why only 2 stars? Because the owner's son who was working ?as a waiter/manager. He was a big young man and whole dinner, he was STANDING at the next table drinking rice wine which he bought for the girls at that table. He was trying very hard to pick up one of the cute Asian girls. He was telling the girl that because his mother has been giving him the evil eyes, he hasn't been able to drink or buy drinks with customers while he works at the restaurant very much(?). He kept on asking her to go out with him. I don't think the girl will ever go out with him, but she certainly didn't mind the free booze for the whole table. We had to endure this loud and annoying conversations during the entire dinner. Since we were stuck at the small corner table right next to him, we were trapped audience and they got louder as they got more drunk. Other waiters try to pull him away from that table couple of times, but he wouldn't move, like I mentioned he was big and the son of the owner. My husband said to give him a break since he was trying so hard, but I couldn't enjoy dinner at all. I thought it was so unprofessional. I felt bad for his mom and other waiters. Luckily for them, his behavior didn't seem to affect their business negatively in anyways. I don't think I am going back there next time we visit SF.

San Tung is probably my favorite Chinese restaurant. Their dried fried chicken wings (which i'm sure everyone has commented on) are the best!!! The soups, noodles, and dumplings are so delicious as well. I come here all the time, but the last time I ate there, we found a metal wire, about 1 inch long (kind of like a staple that was flattened out) in the noodles we ordered, and we had eaten it! We thought it was a bone at first (but there are no bones in the black bean sauce noodles). We showed the owners and they just shrugged their shoulders and said "sorry." What's even worse was that we were still forced to pay for the order of noodles that almost killed us. Other than that incident, which happened once out of the many many times I've been there, I've usually had a pretty good eating experience. The worst part is usually the super long wait before you get to eat and sometimes you have to sit at the tables near where the people are waiting and they are just hovering over you, waiting for a table themselves.

I want to give them more stars but there is just something missing. ?Okay, we went on a Monday evening around 7:30 and the place was jammed and, lo and behold, we only waited a few minutes for a table for two. ?Perfect in between dining time. ?Menu looked good and we were hard pressed not to over do it. ?I am a pescitariian (I eat fish for those who struggle with made up words) and we ordered the dry cooked black bean noodles with seafood and the black mushrooms with bean curd. ?The kimchee wasn't great, but it was addictive (I guess it was the spicing). ?The black mushroom dish was great, even though they COULD have supplied a few more black mushroom since they were the main listing. ? The noodles themselves were great, but the flavoring was a bit bland. ?I would try them again, but just to test out the kitchen. ?There was enough on the menu to bring me back and test them out again, but for this run they get the three stars. ?Oh, yeah, the service was fast and efficient, no more, no less.

After reading so many reviews of this venerable establishment in several papers and of course here on Yelp, I finally got to try it after my appointment last night. This is one of those rare gems as they specialize in Shan Dong cuisine (northeast of Beijing.) Be warned that they don't take reservations; you show up, give them your name, and wait for it to be called. Lines form at peek times, so be prepared to wait in their small waiting area as this is a small restaurant. But, it is worth it and my mother and I will gladly put up with it to get some of the best Shan Dong food as it is a great alternative to Cantonese-heavy cuisine of San Francisco and the peninsula; I love Cantonese as it is my first love, but this a good alternative now and then. The shrimp and leek dumplings are to die for with a filling of fresh ground shrimp and leeks, the dumplings dough being firm and light, not doughy and pick; drizzle with soy sauce and you are in business.! The dry fried chicken wings are heavenly with a light, sticky chili sauce with other ingredients that make it a wonderful subtly spicy rendition; the meat tender and badder just right (not too thin or thick and crispy.) The peanut sauce noodles are sumptuous with aldentae wheat noodles with succulent shrimp, scallops, calamari, mushrooms, and peas in a creamy, peanuty peanut sauce with ground peanuts worked into the sauce (not like pad However;) this takes on its own version. The cabbage they give you before your meal is tongue tingling or fire setting; so, have some tea or a beverage or even rice which works better close at hand.! Round it off with a Ching Dao and you will not be disappointed. The tea is subtly sweet and a wonderful pallate cleanser. The steamed rice is firm, not soggy. It is so fun to hear diners having a good time as you will see a lot of Cantonese and Mandarin speaking clientele and of course Caucasians as well. The service is very friendly and they will take the time to answer any questions and make recommendations. At $40.00, we were shocked; such great food at low prices.! ?So, for excellent Shan Dong cuisine at reasonable prices with friendly service in an upbeat, casual atmosphere, San Tung cannot be beat. Keep up the good work guys.!

i have been coming to this chinese/ korean place ever since high school (about six years ago), and it is still amazingly good, but also unfortunately now amazingly crowded at all meal times. ?the noodles are all freshly made and hand pulled, and you can really taste the difference from packaged/frozen noodles. ?the dry (or wet, but i prefer dry) fried chicken wings are DELICIOUS, and the black bean seafood noodles or the chow mein are my favorite. ?the staff is always bustling around and sometimes are a little bit curt or absent minded, but overall they are really pleasant.

from going to yummy yummy's next door and plenty of word of mouth, me and my family decided to go try this place. we heard all about their chicken so we were pretty excited about that. only thing is, we sit down look at the menu and say, now what? we order the chicken and several other dishes, one noodle, one vegetable and something else. chicken was good, only thing is every other dish tasted exaclty the same. WHAT THE HECK? do they just drizzle this sauce over everything they cook? pretty over hyped.

I love this place, especially the chicken wings. This place is consistently busy all the time. I would come here every so often with my cousin after our 6 mile run along the SF marina. Since I am training for an upcoming marathon, I think I'll be coming here more often. We usually order the same thing every time which consist of dumplings, double order of chicken wings, noodles with peanut sauce, seafood noodles and string beans. I havent tried any dishes that are out of my comfort zone. Maybe one day I will. These past few nights Ive been trying to replicate the chicken wing dish. I am very close to discovering the recipe. I have not gotten the frying technique down, but the sauce is coming along. For the sauce I used soy sauce, oyster sauce, honey, sesame oil, chili pepper, white pepper powder, diced garlic, green onions, ginger root and rice wine. It is still not perfect, but its getting there. If I perfect this recipe I will no longer need to drive to Frisco for this dish. yeah this is what I do. When i find a dish I like, I would attempt to cook it myself.

been coming here, forever. then word got out. now the wait is ridiculous. but, best dumplings and dry fried chicken around. so we still make this one of our regulars. but be forewarned about the wait-time. or do what we do -- you can order pick-up in advance and bring it home for comfy eatings. note: we order our dumplings raw (except for the steamed dumplings) and cook them ourselves at home.
