Small little sandwich place on the campus of Stanford. ?They do sandwiches right! Every sandwich is prepared well and they are very delicious. One recommendation is to get there around 11:30 am for lunch, by noon there is usually line that stretches 15+ people long.

Have you ever eaten somewhere and your order is so amazingly tasty and you never stray from ordering the same item every visit thereafter? ?I never stray from ordering "Purple B's Veggie CA-BLT" ?It is avocado, choice of cheese, lettuce, tomato and scrumptious veggie bacon piled atop your choice of bread. ?Be sure to pile on the "standard" Ike's topping and sauce. ?Ike's gets brownie points for offering an abundant selection of vegetation, vegan and gluten-free options to the cleverly named sandwich selection. Be warned that this location is swamped with Stanford students and often has a lengthy line. ?Thankfully they allow you to order ahead via their website. ?I often cure this craving on Saturday's when there is less of a crowd and as a reward to completing a verbose expedition on the road bike. Note that this location closes at 3:00 on Saturday.

I am forced to reduce two stars here from my previous review of Ike's for the following reasons: 1. They no longer have a half(6") and full(12"). Now it's only a full(9") but the prices are the same as they used to be for the 12". 2. There is a HUGE drop in quality. The chicken is always overcooked(especially in the Ménage à trois which was a standard favorite) and very tough. The meats are just thrown on with uneven sauce that spills out of the sandwich. It's almost as if they just don't care anymore. This place used to have long never ending lines of hungry students who always left satisfied despite the wait. But as is evident from the shorter lines these days, they really need to do something to get back in the game. The once fulfilling sandwiches now leave you wishing you had just gotten a subway instead(which I have started doing regularly off late).

Line is always long despite not too many orders. ?Only tried tonight when it is closing but still need to wait for ten minutes for a sandwich. ?Worse still, the cashier pays no attention to your orders at all, and has lost my side order. ?Food is okay, but would rather go to Axe for a quick burger which is equally tasty!

I had warned my Ike's Place virgin coworkers that it would be an adventure as I was not sure how to get to this location. Google Maps indicated it was only 4 miles away, but as Stanford University is confusing, it took us quite awhile, at least 20 minutes more than what Google had indicated to get here. Luckily, I had noted directions from other Yelpers, and we nabbed the last visitor parking spot in Parking Structure 2. 5 cents for ever 2 minutes. It was a gorgeous day, and we found the building easily, even though Via Ortega was closed. At first I was confused that we were going to the campus cafe, but saw the familiar pictures, and walked to the end where a line was formed. Luckily, I have studied this menu pretty intensely, and knew I wanted a Tony Soprano. My coworkers on the other hand, only looked at the few choices on their menu above, and service with Verizon is pretty slow here so I couldn't pull up the menu for them. That's what they get for not studying the menu on the link I sent them days before! The workers here are chill and helpful, and you can see the steady flow of sandwich making behind. One guy was in charge of putting the sandwiches in the bag, with the caramel apple lollipop and napkins and calling out names. Takes the usual 10-15 minutes to get your order, and I was dying of starvation that I almost opened up my sandwich in the car and ate it. Sandwich is just as good as always, but normally I can't finish a whole in one sitting. However, I devoured the whole thing fast, and didn't feel overly full the whole day. Coworkers loved it, which I had no doubt they would. Would come back since it's the closest to my work, but it's quite a journey and paying for parking stinks.

I love Ike's! I started heading over here in 2010. Over the years, some of the sandwiches (the tri-tip) have been taken off the menu and the prices have kicked up a bit, but I don't mind. They've managed to keep my Spiffy Tiffy on the menu and that's enough to keep me coming back every time. First off, the dutch crunch bread is simply amazing. I always get the Spiffy Tiffy- a sandwich filled with chicken, avocado, mushrooms, pepper jack cheese, pesto, and provolone. omgahhhhhh nommmmmmm. I always get the full sandwich with some dirty jalepeno chips and I'm good to go until the next day. These sandwiches are huge! So yummy! Yeah, Ike's is a bit pricey and a bit hard to find (it's hidden in the Stanford campus), but it's so worth it. They've got something for everybody. P.S. watch out for the wait. The place fills up with students and techies at all times of the day. It's worth the wait since they make everything fresh, but you'll def be waiting!

I agree with one of the other reviewers, that the full-sized sandwiches used to be bigger, and the chicken is almost always tough and dry (and usually unevenly spread out). Between the shrinking portion size and the fact that I now have to open up my sandwich to rearrange the chicken more evenly (i.e. so one side doesn't have it all, causing no chicken on the other side), I really think Ike's Place has been overwhelmed with good business and might now be trying to reduce the number of customers while making more money. Ike's used to be one of my favorite places on campus, and a special treat (since it usually involved standing in a long line); it's sad that they're no longer as good as they used to be and are pro-actively (it seems) getting worse overall.

At one point I used to live on Ike's. There used to be long lines in front of their shop and sandwiches used to be filling. Then the staff changed or I don't know what happened, but their sandwiches shrunk in size and became all greasy. I've been getting leaky sandwiches despite specifically asking them to go light on the sauce. And of course, these sandwiches are unhealthy (fatty), as they always were.

I went to Ike's Place with my friends and really enjoyed the food. I had the "Spiffy Tiffy" which consists of Halal chicken, mushrooms, avocado, pesto, provolone, and pepper jack. I had it on gluten free bread. I thought it was delicious. I would recommend this place to friends. I would only warn people that you don't want to order food here if you are in a hurry.

This place. Oh. My. God. I've got my three favorite sandwiches that I alternate between: The Matt Cain with avocado, the Paul Reubens, and the Al Bundy (which I only recently tried and fell in love with). But they have SO MANY OPTIONS. I would strongly recommend researching their menu before you go so you know exactly what you want. Otherwise, you'll get left standing at the counter trying to figure out what to do with your life. Other recommendations: Go early (like, 10 AM early) if you're planning to order in person. If you wait until lunch time, the line is out the door and around the corner and you'll spend your entire lunch break waiting around. If you have an iPhone, you can also place an order online and schedule a pick-up time, which is what I usually do. Again, you need to do this early - all the reasonable pick-up times get taken by 11:30 and you could get stuck picking up your sandwich at 2:45. Aside from the crazy wait times (which is nothing if not a testament to how fantastic the food is), this place is BOMB.

It was my first time visiting and all my friends recommended Ike's. Even with the hyped up expectations, Ike's delivered in service and quality! I told the cashier it was my first time and he was extremely helpful in selecting a good sandwich - broke it down by meats, flavors, then toppings. Ended up going with the Ménage à trois. The sandwich took longer than most sandwiches to make, but my goodness it was delicious! Now I really want to try the Ike's in SF next time I'm there. One other unique thing about Ike's is that they stock hard to find drinks/chips. I tried their Voodoo chips, and can only describe them as a mixture between Salt & Vinegar and Barbecue flavors. The Leninade lemonade was interestingly good as well.

My taste buds are too peculiar to like this place. I don't like their dirty sauce, but I also don't like sauces much on my sandwiches anyways. This place always seems to be closed around dinner time or have extremely long lines, but that's not why I give it two stars. I give it two stars because all their options are weird and unsatisfying and definitely overpriced. They also give me a dirty look whenever I tell them I don't want any dirty sauce on the sandwich.... So if you're very particular about your sandwiches like me, you may want to approach with caution. Otherwise, ignore my review and read what the other normal people think.

I came here with some pretty big expectations due to all of the hype, and I was a little underwhelmed by my experience. ?I knew that there would be a big line, but I didn't anticipate the hour wait at 2:00pm. ?There are very few restaurants that I will actually wait an hour for, and I thought this might make the list with all of the rave reviews. ?Unfortunately, it did not.. by a long shot. We ordered the Spiffy Tiffy and the Herbert Hoover - I'm going to leave it open that I may have ordered the wrong things here, but I read quite a few reviews before ordering to get an idea of what people enjoyed here. ?The sandwiches were okay, but definitely nothing that stood out to me. ?Granted, I have had some incredible sandwiches back when I was living in St. Louis, so I have a different baseline of "sandwich epicness." ? Anyway, I thought that the sandwiches were kind of bland. ?The Spiffy Tiffy had pesto sauce which I wasn't a fan of since it really didn't taste like much. ?I thought that the chicken in the sandwich also tasted bland. ?There just wasn't a pop to either sandwich - it just tasted like cafeteria food, which I guess I should have somewhat expected since it is on campus. Overall, I don't think that I will be back. ?I don't regret going, but I just don't think that the time that you spend waiting in line is worth the food that you get (and at the price that they charge).

I loved these sandwiches with their unique toppings and fun dressings, even putting up with inept service and long wait times. ?But Ike's doesn't respect dietary requirements and people should know it. One of the many reasons I loved Ike's was the plethora of vegan options. ?Ike's seemed to care and understand about the non-animal product lifestyle and it felt so nice to find a sandwich place like that. ?It's hard to find. ? Then, after eating it many times and despite it being listed on the menu and website as vegan, the manager informs me that the vegan chicken nugget has egg. ?I express much disappointment and dismay and he nonchalantly said "yeah, the menu and website should be updated". ? And that was it. ? I won't get into how disrespectful and offensive this attitude is, and I'm sure non-vegans would agree that is no way to treat customers. ? Be careful what you order at Ike's. ?They aren't honest about what they serve and they don't care who it hurts.

Fuck. I have to admit this is probably one of the better sandwich places I've ever been to. The trick here is that they have an extensive selection online that isn't reflected by their physical menu. http://ilikeikesplace.co… I got The Change with avocado on sourdough. It was delicious. The place has got a bit of character. They've got a selection of esoteric sodas and you get a caramel apple sucker with your meal. The sandwiches also have clever names like "we're JUST friends" and "name of girl I'm dating" You goddamn Stanford kids have no idea how lucky you guys are, back in my day we had to hike off campus to a Lee's Sandwich to eat sandwiches with meat that tastes and smells like it was manufactured in a lab, and bread so hard and crusty it would cut your mouth like shattered glass. And we *liked* it, because it was better than anything else within 5 miles. We also had to walk uphill both ways...

For an awkward service. My boss treated us to lunch today at Ike's. No one at the counter ever asked for tips for an order "To-Go" before, but today, he did and quite rudely. Other than that the sandwich was still good. FYI, according to the director of Stanford Hospitality & Auxiliaries and senior associate dean, "Stanford operated retail operations have a non tipping policy. And any tipping is completely optional and would typically include 'just the change.' "

Elvis Keith on Dutch Crunch...to die for! As an engineer, I always find myself trying to reverse engineer everything I encounter. How does it work? What kind of components make up the assembly? The Ike's sandwich has stumped me because I can't answer any of these questions....and I'm ok with that. Usually, one can take a look at the insides of a sandwich and have a pretty good idea of replicating it. You simply can't replicate an Ike's. It's simply magical. If it's your first time eating Ike's, do make sure you have time to fit in a 3 hr nap after the meal. Instant food coma.

I used to love Ike's, but ever since they opened at Stanford, I've noticed a steady decline in price as they have gained popularity. I assume that this must be a result of their attempt to make more sales and get more profit, which is fine because the line is always a long wait so they have plenty of customers, but the quality and quantity of the sandwiches has really declined. They gave free chips with each sandwich, which has also ended. The amount of sauce and veggies has definitely declined along with the quality of almost all the ingredients. In addition, the size has been getting smaller and prices are on the rise. Ike's was once a really noteworthy sandwich, but lately I consider it pretty much average, which is not something you want out of a sandwich place because a sandwich is something so easy to make for yourself. Given these comments, Ike's is still slightly above average, but I detracted a star because of the long lines and high prices, which are no longer justified. The sandwiches are usually small and soggy, not exactly my favorite. The best sandwiches are Matt Cain, Menage, and Jim Rome. The only time I come here is when I know there will be no line because it's just not worth the wait anymore.

During our tour of Stanford University's campus we stopped for lunch at Ike's Place. Ike's is a San Francisco Bay area sandwich shop. Our tour guide pointed out that the Stanford location is a very popular spot and it often has a line out the door when classes are in session. Fortunately for us classes were not in session, so there was no line to order. We were pleasantly greeted by one of the cashiers, who seemed more interested in having a conversation than taking our lunch order. According to their story, "When you come to Ike's Place it is our goal to make you feel like the unique individual that you are." That mission was definitely accomplished. After our conversation with the cashier along with a long look through the lengthy menu, I finally decided on the Spiffy Tiffy sandwich with halal chicken, mushrooms, avocado, pesto, provolone, and pepper jack ($6.96 for half, $9.99 for whole). In addition all sandwiches come served with Ike's Dirty Secret Sauce, lettuce, and tomato. Mustard, jalapeno, red onions, pickles, and banana peppers are also available free of charge. You also have a choice of French, Dutch crunch, sourdough, wheat, or gluten-free. I went with sourdough. The sandwiches are all served toasted and are stuffed full of ingredients. I decided to get the full sandwich, but normally half would have been plenty for lunch. The flavor was excellent and all ingredients were fresh. The addition of pesto to the sandwich added a nice flavor throughout and I liked the secret sauce. I also had a bite of my wife's Menage A Trois sandwich which comes with halal chicken, real honey, honey mustard, BBQ, pepper jack, swiss, and cheddar. This is listed as one of the most popular sandwiches, and I can see why. The flavor combination was outstanding! If I a student at Stanford Ike's would definitely be on my weekly lunch rotation. I would absolutely visit again on a future visit to the area.

5+ star taste 3 star price 1-4 star service Taste: On my list of the top 5 sandwiches I've ever had in my life, Ike's appears four times. The menage a tois, spiffy tiffy, name of the girl I'm dating, and we're just friends tickle my taste buds in a way no other meat between bread concoction can equal. Their sauces have unparalleled taste, and every bite bursts with flavor. The sandwiches are all served hot with dirty sauce, but try to find a way try the 2 pestos and godfather sauce because they are all amazing. Price: Ike's isn't cheap. $10 buck sandwiches. Cheapest way to go is to find a friend and split a superman. Service: Depending on when you go and how your order, service at Ike's is either terrible or fantastic. If you go during the lunch hour during the school year and don't order ahead, good luck. Be prepared for a 40 minute wait in line and a 20 minute wait for you sandwich. If you go at an off hour and use the app to order ahead, chances are you will walk right up to the counter and they will hand you your sandwich.

Ike is like the Pied Piper of deliciousness.

So, I don't like sandwiches. I really don't. I like bread and i like meat but i don't like them mixed in messy combinations, with one exception, IKE'S. I always get the same thing (Menage a Trois) unless I'm really feeling down (then I opt for If I Were Cute). The chicken on these sandwiches are amazing (usually i'm a turkey fan but not here) and ike's dirty sauce is like mayo on steroids. It's pretty easy to find a full listing of all the secret sandwiches so take a look at those too. This place isn't cheap; however, you never leave here hungry. Plus, there are ways to get half off if you're special like me. As for the location, it's Stanford! Huang is one of the cooler buildings on campus.

Well my favorite sandwich place is Earl of Sandwich, but seeing how that all the way out in Las Vegas and can't go there very much this place fills in very nicely. I have only come here on a couple of Saturday afternoon's so I can't really say that it was too busy. My favorite sandwich here is the Matt Cain on dutch crunch, it's such a great sandwich, very flavorful. My only knock about this place is they are hard to find. My first time here I spent about 10 minutes looking for it because I was not used to the Stanford campus.

Why does it take them so long to make a simple sandwich? I know Ike's is popular and the line can be out the door, but I come here at dinner when there is no line, and it still takes them 20 minutes to assemble my sandwich. What are they doing in the back? Do they have to humanely kill the halal chicken? Are they baking the bread? I just don't understand what takes them so long. The sandwiches are pretty decent, but nothing to rave about. From reading the other reviews, you would think that Ike invented the sandwich. My vote for best sandwich purveyor in the greater Palo Alto area goes to Village Cheese House.

I've had it with Ike. ?His sandwiches remain delicious (albeit expensive) but the customer service continues to decline, even when you think it can't possibly be any worse. ?Not only do you have to deal with the long lines, lost orders, and the fact that they regularly mess up the ingredients on your sandwich, but their employees also refuse to honor their promises. ?My husband had a buy one get one free coupon. ?He couldn't figure out how to use it online so he called the store where he was going to pick up his order and they told him he should just place the order online normally (paying for both sandwiches) and they would reimburse him for one when he came in to pick them up. ?When he showed up, the (presumably different) employee said there was absolutely no way they would reimburse him. ?It's fine if its their policy not to allow use of the coupons with online orders, but they need to be upfront about that and not mislead people into thinking that the coupon will be honored. ?We would not have purchased the sandwiches had we known they wouldn't honor the coupon the way their employee said they would. ? We have tried to contact them by several methods to discuss the fact that their employee made a promise they refused to uphold and have not received a satisfactory response. ?It is frustrating that they respond to every positive comment on their Facebook page with something like "Thanks so much!!! ?We love having you as a customer! Come back soon!!" but ignore any critical comment or question. ? It's clear that Ike thinks he's gotten too famous and popular to care about how he treats his customers. ?Its true that his business is so popular that customer service probably doesn't matter much to his bottom line, but as a result, he has lost the two of us as customers.

Absolutely love their sandwiches, not sure what it is but it's always delicious. The operations could use some improvement though. ?I like that they have an iPhone app now (but you have to order at least 1.5 hour ahead I think) to cut down on the wait time. ?Why not have everyone in line be able to order with their iPhone? ?or have two cashiers instead of one even when the line is 1 hour long? ?or have more people delivering sandwiches? I would come here a lot more often if it didn't take so long to get my food

Great sandwiches!!!! My family and I came around 01PM today (Sunday), and there wasn't much of a line; our sandwiches came pretty quickly, so no complaints there. Today, I tried the Jim Plumber (Turkey, Ham, Brie) and my parents had the Menage a Trois. Really nothing to complain about regarding these sandwiches. However, I do wish their customer service was as good as their food. My dad wanted some peppers so I went to ask for some. The cashier dude said, "I'll have those peppers coming right up for you" , so I stood there and waited. A few minutes later .... my dad comes up to me and tells me that he has already finished his sandwiches. . . . Does "coming right up" mean something different on the Stanfurd campus? Maybe they could tell I was a Bear, ahha. Overall, I'd still say it's a nice place to get lunch, especially since it's only like 04 minutes away from the Stanfurd Shopping Center! (AND remember, free parking on weekends!)

Ike's would be great if they could get your freaking order right. They always forget any add-ons you request like jalapeno poppers. I think they've gotten it right once in the 4 or 5 times we've been there. They also take a while to make the sandwiches. That being said, I love the sandwiches. We've introduced many people here, and they all like it as well. We like to come to Stanford on a Sunday afternoon with our dog and get some Ike's.

I love Ike's. ?After visiting the SF institution, it's great to see it do well and move to a variety of location on the Peninsula. ? The selection here is slightly different than the SF one and I do miss the choice of superhero selections (Superman, Doomsday, etc.), but I believe you can order them off menu. Nonetheless, I tried the Matt Cain and enjoyed it. ?The key is still the dirty sauce and the great ingredients. ?It's not a particularly large sandwich, but it's delicious. ?If you're hungry, definitely get the bigger one. ? A bit hard to find and parking is a challenge. ?Luckily, someone picked me up a sandwich.

That caramel apple pop you've got in your mouth might as well be a giant sign hanging around your neck that says, "Look at me! I went to Ike's for lunch today!" MHMMM. But I will proudly wear that sign-- I love Ike's! The "menage a trois" is my favorite here. It probably gets its name from the three cheeses in it, and I always feel funny ordering it, but then again, all the names here are a little odd. The best part of the menage a trios is not the cheeses though-- it's the honey. The added sweetness that it gives to the sandwich is superb. Even just thinking about it makes me hungry. The "spiffy tiffy" reminds me a lot of a chicken caesar salad, even though it's pesto based. With avocado. And mushroom. I don't know why, but my first thought after taking a bite was "oh tastes like chicken... caesar salad." The bread here is amazing! I always get the dutch crunch when I go to Lutticken's at CCSR, and same thing goes when I go to Ike's. The dutch crunch is a must for your bread choice. Even though it has "crunch" in the name, it's not super hard and crunchy, so don't let the name dissuade you. I will say though, that Ike's is a once or twice a week meal at most for me. I don't think I could do any more than that because the sandwiches are so rich and filling. Even half is enough to fill me up for the rest of the day. The line is always super long around lunchtime-- even at 1pm. It doesn't really die down until after 2-ish, and even then there are still people milling around waiting for their sandwiches. Also, the people who work here are really friendly and always try to find a way to connect with you or make small talk while taking your order, which is quite endearing. The menu at any Ike's Place is definitely a lot smaller than what you would find at an Ike's Lair, but then again, not all Places are Lairs, but all Lairs are also Places. The Ike's Place app seems like a good concept, but it's extremely buggy and unreliable and requires multiple restarts before anything can be accomplished. Someone should get on that... tl;dr: Some of the best sandwiches around-- unique, flavorful, and full of sandwichy goodness. I just wish the line was more reasonable, but I guess that's what you get for being so popular.

I've only ever had the menage a trois and I'm satisfied with that forever. I love Ike's! The only drawback about this place can be the excruciating wait so order ahead on Ikes's iphone app. + Do get the menage a trois on dutch crunch + Do order a full. You'll eat it all

Not much to say about Ike's that hasn't been said here already. A vast menu with interesting and expertly crafted combinations and names. Horrific lines at lunchtime, so order in advance to pick up if you can, which now requires 24 hours notice by phone (the app may be different). Ample seating, albeit in one of the engineering buildings with a somewhat sterile-looking concrete look and bad acoustics, so take your sandwich to go and find a scenic spot on campus (there are many!). Lastly, a haiku: the menage a trois on dutch -- perfect, if it just had avocado.

Stopped by Ike's again tonight and got my favorite sandwich at Ike's (or anywhere else for that matter), the "Do You Smell What Barack Is Cooking?" In a previous review, I mentioned that I thought their BBQ sauce was just killer, with the right mix of spices and tanginess in the flavor. I subsequently got another one of the BBQ sandwiches, though, and was relatively unimpressed by it, finding the BBQ sauce rather bland. When I ordered the "Do You Smell What Barack Is Cooking?" again tonight, I think I discovered what it is that actually makes this sandwich. It is, in part, the BBQ sauce, but more important than that, it's the combination of the BBQ sauce with the extra dirty sauce (garlic aioli) that the "Do You Smell What Barack Is Cooking?" comes with! This represents the perfect combination of flavors that complement one another. Their BBQ sauce is a somewhat sweet one, but when it's paired with the garlicky flavor of the dirty sauce, then it makes the sandwich really very good. Now that I know the "secret sauce" (pun intended), I'm tempted to go back to their other BBQ sandwiches and request them with extra dirty sauce. When they do it with the "Do You Smell What Barack Is Cooking," they certainly make it really, really damn good. I'll be back for this particular sandwich in the future!

I'm very conflicted. I go to Ike's at least 3 times a week, as I work right next door at the Palo Alto VA. I always order the same sandwich (#15 Jim Plummer, adding tomatoes, onions, cranberry sauce, and mushrooms) and it is always delicious. EXCEPT FOR THIS ONE TIME. I had noticed that they weren't cutting the rind off of the brie (which, as cheese-lovers will note, is edible but definitely not good eats) for any of the sandwiches I had been ordering, but whatever, I could live. Then, last week, THERE IS A GOOD AMOUNT OF GRAY MOLD ON THE RIND. Parts of it were still fuzzy, but some parts were partially liquefied (the sandwich is served hot). I was so grossed out I threw away more than half the sandwich, having already eaten almost an entire half before I noticed. I was pretty pissed off (with the add-ons, the sandwich costs a little over $11). ELEVEN DOLLARS. For a sandwich with mold. WTF. I called them immediately and was transferred to the manager by a very polite register worker. However the manager, although polite, told me some pretty ridiculous things: (1) "We don't cut off the rind because it takes too much time. It would add on wait time to a sandwich that already take some time to make". (2) - and this is the most effing ridiculous thing I've ever heard - "THE RIND IS EDIBLE, IT JUST DOESN'T TASTE THAT GOOD" ... WTF?! I couldn't believe this was the response I got. I mean, cooked bugs are edible but they don't taste that good. I pay $11 for a sandwich, at least 3 times a week, and I get told that I should eat the rind because it's edible, or I can pick it off myself because they don't have the time. I get that they're extremely busy, and that they're getting good business, but I've already read a couple of other reviews indicating they don't take customer service or customer retention very seriously. I still go by about once/twice a week because it's one of the better and closer lunch places around, but I was really annoyed by their response to unsanitory food conditions. Yeah, they gave me a free sandwich, but the manager also told me: "We'll give you your next sandwich for free, but we still won't be cutting the rind off the cheese. You can always subsitute another cheese in its place". WTF.

I concur, very hard to find! We were super stressed because with left at 2:15 pm and they close at 3 pm on the weekends and we live in San Jose. ?Ike's is inside the Huang Engineering building on the Stanford Campus. There was only 5 people in front of us, and I heard at times the line is VERY LONG. The man working the register was VERY nice and knowledgeable of all the dozens of ?Sandwiches they offered. All the Sandwiches have funny little spin off names or are named after people. ?We both decide on "The Change" which is a thinly sliced Rib-Eye Steak Sandwich with Bbq sauce, Onion Rings, and Cheddar Cheese with the option of Lettuce or Tomato on either French Roll, Wheat Roll, Dutch Crunch, Sour Dough, or Gluten Free Bread. The sandwiches are Super Messy. ?That's what they make napkins for. ?I would rather have a JUICY sandwich that got crap all over my face over a disgustingly dry sandwich that made me buy and additional drink to wash it down any day. ?So bring some paper towels or wet wipes and Pony-up! Cuz these sandwiches are BOMB!

Taste-wise and service-wise, the SF location is way better. Parking-wise, the Stanford location is so much better... Anyway, CALL AHEAD!!! I mean it! Like.. two hours ahead, seriously. So it was strange. I called at 12 and requested my menage a trois to be made for pickup at 1. My friend called literally right after me, and the dude (who sounded extremely high... or just super friendly) on the phone said her sandwich wouldn't be ready until 2. Wtf?? Such a drastic change... so I called back to change mine at 2 since I was meeting up for lunch with her. I came at 2, and there was a loooong line. I'm glad I got to skip that, but the whole place was SO unorganized. There's supposed to be a pickup line, but there was no cashier there... which ended up a huge mess because the cashier from the order line would have us pay first and then get our sandwich when it's ready. When I got there, my sandwich wasn't ready at that time... and 10 minutes later I got it. But it was cold... It still tasted amazing, but not as orgasmic as the one from SF. They seemed to skimp out on the chicken and looked really sloppy... or it seemed to be missing something. And to make things worse, my friend's sandwich wasn't ready until like 20 minutes later... so my sandwich was just not fresh-tasting. It turned out hers was ready, too, but the cashier ?forgot to check on the sandwiches for pickup... irritating. I'm so sorry, Ike's... but I have to give you a 3. For now, I'll probably drive my ass to SF for better service and yummier sandwiches... or wait til the Cupertino location opens. Wooooo!

I hate that this place is so good, mostly because I live in New York City. Every time I'm at Stanford I make sure to pay a visit to Ike's. The Matt Cain on sourdough is a beast of a sandwich. The sauce is almost too damn good to be on a sandwich. I feel as if I should be having that with some well roasted duck. The staff is really friendly, the drinks they have available are great too. If you're at Stanford, in Palo Alto, hell if you're anywhere in the Bay Area it's worth a trip. The campus itself is beautiful and the food here is great.

I went today and I wanted a sandwich that was similar to my usual turkey and cheese at any other sandwich place. The cashier recommended the Joe Plummer which was turkey, ham, and brie cheese. It was by far one of the best sandwiched I've ever had! The service was alright; we asked for some peppers but they were taking a long time so we just dropped it. Otherwise it was a really great lunch!

I have a tendency to forget about the price of food as long as the taste makes up for it, but up to 12 dollars for a sandwich?! This better be a damn good tasting sandwich, not to mention the journey it took to get here We arrived on the Stanford campus at 1:30pm and located the Huang Engineering Building. Since we were unfamiliar with the campus, we were unsure of parking. The parking structure we found had 2 rows of visitor parking. At the time, there was a career fair that was going on, so there was a line, but it took less than 5 minutes for them to take our order. The wait really occurs after you put in your order, but even then, we didn't experience the wait that some people mentioned. It took about 10 minutes for us to get our sandwiches. They don't have much of your main stream beverages and I don't think they have a full menu of sandwiches, but there is still PLENTY to choose from. Definitely would go back to fulfill my heffering needs :)

15 minute line wait + 30 sandwich prep wait + 15 minutes to devour my sandwich = one of the best hours I've ever spent. Ok, I'm exaggerating the 45 minute total wait probably wasn't worth purchasing just one sammy, which is why I recommend you come with a big group of friends. The wait can get a bit long but if you have good company or great iPhone games then it's not too bad. To get to the point, order the Matt Cain and prepare to wait a while.

I love sandwiches. ?Ike's does make a very good sandwich. ?But any restaurant should have some sense of good customer service to be really successful. This is where Ike's @ Stanford really fails. ?I work at the hospital on campus that is only a 10 minute walk away. ?Trying to put in a group order has become more trouble than it's worth. ?This location now refuses to take phone orders, even though they advertise that on their website. ?When we attempted to do so, we were instructed they would only take an order through their app. ?Okay, so Ike's apparantly does not want the hospital's business. ?Funny given that we are only 10 minutes away and are open 24/7 with limited food outlets on campus.. This comes to the second issue. ?Ordering through the app requires prepayment of the order by credit card. ?There is no option to pay at the counter. ?We had one individual make the order on two different occasions and the same thing happened each time. ?Two to three days after using the app, the credit card company called the person who used it and reported fraudulent charges on the card. ?This happened with two different cards at two different times with the only thing in common being placing an order through the Ike's app. So, while Ike's does make a good sandwich, it's not worth the typical long and slow line or the hassle to order through the app putting your credit card at risk. ?When I'm asked at the hospital for a good sandwich place, I point them in another direction. ?Ike's just isn't worth it.

Back to being a FAN! My update follows: So after my disappointing incident; I wrote to Ike. And after more than a few days, I heard back. He explained that the Stanford location does not offer the "call-before-closing and pick-after-hours". He followed up with me upon not hearing back from me. While I was offered freebies in return for my disappointment, I have not availed any. (Yet ;) I absolutely LOVE their sandwiches and will continue to visit the different locations. I just pray that the success doesnt morph into arrogance. ~~~ Here's my longer review about the terrible customer service: On their website, they proudly claim that you can call in before closing time and they will wait for up to an hour after closing for you to come pick up the sandwich. With that proud claim in mind, I called in at 5:40 pm but to my horror, they refused to take my order. They said I could come in person and place the order, but wont take my order over the phone - purportedly because they had already taken all the orders that they could for the day - they supposedly only serve 20 people after closing. And apparently, their "system" does not allow them to take any more orders beyond 20. I offered to pay upfront - they asked me how they would verify my id - I said I would be going there at the store front to pick up my sandwich any way - so I would show my id to them at that point. They continued to maintain that if I were standing in line at that point - they would take my order. I said - just treat my order as if I were standing in line - charge me right here, right now - (only because their "system" wouldnt allow them to take more phone orders) - which would thus be no different for them than ordering in person at the store front. They still refused. I went on to explain to them - that I have been a very loyal fan all along - have helped Ike in so many ways already - by "Like"ing their businesses on Facebook - both the San Francisco location as well as the Stanford location. Have helped them in the ESPN fanwich competitions, and several other calls to help from Ike. And all they had to do was make me a sandwich - which was being ordered within the confinement of ?the rules set by them on their website --- "If you can pick up your sandwiches within an hour after we close, call it in! We'll hold them until you can make it. However, we do not take calls after closing, so call in your order BEFORE closing." Even after pleading to them that I have been a very loyal fan, given them my love on Yelp and Facebook - they refused to budge from their stupid stand. ~~~ To top it all; I wrote a long letter explaining my miserable experience to Ike: ike@ilikeikesplace.com hoping that I would hear some sensible answer from HIM! But to my biggest shock and disappointment - I heard back no answer from IKE. Terrible indifference to a loyal customer's pangs of anguish. I waited for one whole week before sending him a reminder about my terrible customer service. No reply. Even after waiting one additional week after my reminder - I received no reply from Ike or any one at their company. I see Ike periodically putting up some status messages on Facebook - which clearly means he has time to read his emails. My email message did not bounce as well - so they have received it. THAT last part - total and terrible indifference about a LOYAL customer's anguish - was the last straw. While their sandwiches are delicious - their customer service is TERRIBLE! I hope some modest success doesnt blind this genuinely good business and they come back to their senses at the earliest. Bad customer service will most certainly hasten their downfall.

This is seriously one of the best sandwich places you'll ever try. The menu (online, and on their iPhone app) is vast. The fact that you'll have a long line waiting for you if you go during the lunch hour is testament to just how good these sandwiches are. I'm especially partial to the Ménage à Trois sandwich on Dutch Crunch bread with extra dirty sauce. Yeah, it's probably 1500+ calories for that single sandwich, and yeah, it's ten bucks, and yeah, that's a lot of money and a lot of calories for a sandwich. But when you're jonesing for Ike's, it's totally worth it.

Love the Spiffy Tiffy on dutch crunch bread. I wish Ike's had a diced chicken option. Their chicken is shredded, so it's a huge mess to eat! The line is SO long. Use the iphone app to order your sandwich to save some time. The iphone app is buggy and freezes though. You may need to be patient with it. Employees are super friendly. Sandwiches are unfortunately pretty pricey.... $8 (with tax) for a 4-inch half sandwich, more than $10 for most full-size sandwiches. During non-peak hours, there are plenty of tables in the Huang Center Atrium. Good place to work if you like ambient noise.

Boy is this place hard to fine. I did A LOT of research before coming here. I had to look up EXACTLY where to go and which building to enter into. It was difficult, but after having been there once, you won't get lost again. I think... Anyway, I came on a weekday -super early 11am. There place was empty! All this talk about long lines and I was worried it wasn't open because no one was standing at the counter! But he was just in the back answering the phone. Yes, as I ordered, lunch orders were keeping the phone lines busy. I heard you can call in to place an order and avoid the line. Rumor has it. I order two sandwiches from here. The Menage a Trois and Matt Cain. I had no idea what I was ordering. I literally just told the guy, "it's my first time here and I need two sandwiches, you pick." That is how I ended up with the two I had. He said it was the two most popular. i was iffy about the the three sauces and three types of cheese in the Menage a Trois, but according to the guy "I HAD TO TRY IT." He was pretty awesome. The service was awesome in general. The prices, however, were... It wasn't too expensive, but it was not like Cali sourdough price. Then again, the sandwiches are HUGE. Sooo I guess I can't complain. The Menage a Trois was overwhelming. The three sauces really does make the sandwich VERY sweet. And that is just a turn off to me. Also, the sandwich was difficult to eat in general. The Matt Cain was bit better. I actually liked it more than the Menage A Trois. I'm a plain jane. So any sandwich with a sauce overload is not something I praise. I am old fashion. Then again, I've ?girl who has had Katz deli before, so I'm hard to impress. Would I come back? I honestly don't know what is so awesome about this place. It's just... okay. If I had to choose between Mr. Pickles, Little Deluca's, Ikes or Cali Sourdough, I would go with Cali Sourdough. Sorry Ikes. You didn't impress. Maybe second time will?

I.............cannot..........even..........begin.?.........to.........explain..........how........?awesome......this......place......is. Okay, I CAN but there are some things that come to mind when eating Ike's that simply words cannot describe. So how did I hear about Ike's you may ask?? Two words, Adam Richman. I'm ALWAYS down for a good sandwich and, one night while channel flipping I came across the episode in which he travels to San Francisco, more importantly however the place he was visiting at that very moment just happened to be Ike's. Senses halted I just stared at my tv in awe thinking "did that dude just REALLY put poppers IN the damn sandwich" and "what kind of bread is that" and "you said they had HOW many different combinations" That's it... ::pulling up yelp:: 'bookmark'. That was 2010. It's damn near 2012 now. 5 SF trips later and I just NOW had tried Ike's, let's just say the people I went with are not food whores like me and "can't see why we have to go ALL the way across town when there's a Subway across the street" Pardon the language but this needs to be said. I gotta find some new fu*kin friends. So, finally on my 6th trip to the bay area (this time solo) I end up in Silicon Valley on campus getting ready to enroll for classes in March. I knew Ike's was on campus, so what did I do? I woke up at my place in LA around 9am, got a ride to the airport, checked in, got on the plane, had a glass of OJ, landed at SFO, took the BART to the CalTrain to Palo Alto, checked in my hotel, threw my bags in my room, got a cab to campus, went to my advisor, talked, asked directions to Ike's (which was in the next building over) walked over and... SCARFED DOWN THE MOST AMAZING DOUBLE DIRTY sandwiches EVER, oh yeah, you read that right, first meal of the day and it was AWESOME. I'm bringing a tent and sleeping bag, I'll just explain that it's part of an engineering project so I never have to leave come March.

I went to Ike's this afternoon for a sandwich, remembering I had a delicious experience with a Meatless Mike a year ago. The sandwich I eventually ate was tasty, but the collective experience was one of the worst meals I've ever had. It took almost 40 minutes to get through the line, and another 30 minutes to actually get my food, and on a Sunday! If you have anything to do in the afternoon, don't go to Ike's. The service staff is apathetic and appears to work especially slow when they see the line stacking up. The pony-tailed hipster taking the orders loves making small talk while customers are getting progressively angrier in line. To reiterate, I waited 70 minutes to get my lunch.

After driving around aimlessly looking for this place, we finally parked and asked some students where Ike's was. It's located in the engineering building on Stanford campus so it may be a little hard to find for non-students. However, the trek is worth it as these sandwiches are easily among the top 5 I've ever had. The menu they have on the blackboard lists only some of the more popular ones. They have menus on the counter with the full selection which you can also view online. I decided to go with the Lincecum and I was not disappointed. Loaded with turkey, ham, bacon, avocado, havarti, tomato, and lettuce, each bite was heavenly. We came around lunch on a Monday but there was no line and we were able to order right away. They even brought the food to us afterwords even though we sat across the room. I would recommend getting the full-size, however, as each half is only like 4 inches. Will definitely be back to try some of the other sandwiches.

If I went to school here, GAME OVER. ? I was just visiting a friend and she told me about the infamous sandwiches. ?YOU'RE SPOILED STANFORD. ?I'm jealous. ?Unique and delicious sandwiches. ?It's my goal to try them all at least once. ?The line is sporadic, so you're lucky if you catch it when it's not too long. ?I haven't been lucky every time so far. ?My wait has been on average 45 minutes...sigh. ?Worth it though. The pick up method could be adjusted though. ?A staff will call out your name, but most of the time people aren't waiting nearby. ?So the staff walks around in circles calling it out. ?It's very inefficient in my opinion.

You know those movies where the dude says "Make me a sammich" to the girl after a night of bumping uglies? ?I'd imagine Ike is both a ladies man and very observant, as he's managed to hone a lifetime worth of one night stand sandwich making excellence and perhaps breakfast pleasantries. ? The diverse menu seems to evoke the preggo in me every time I visit. Today was my first time visting the Stanford location. ?A little tricky to find, but nothing a little GPS and asking around won't fix. We must have gotten lucky as there was no line in the engineering building. ?After ordering our sandwiches from the two pleasant man-bearded men we sat around patiently for our food. ?What, they bring your sandwich to you? ?Why thank you friend, so polite! On to the sandwich: I decided on the Matt Cain with mozzarella sticks on dutch crunch. ?Yes, mozzarella sticks, jalapeno poppers, and onion rings are potential add-ons to the inside of the sandwich. ?Subway can go eat fresh; I'll deal with the extra 2 mile run needed to compensate. ?But anyway, what else is there to say about the sandwich other than it's good. ?Slap your mama good. ?I'm not sure what the godfather sauce is made of, but they should rename it to God's Tears sauce. ?I tried to tell some of the MIT folk via the wormhole what they were missing out on. ?I think I just looked crazy. ?Their loss really. But honestly, stop reading this and get your sammich on. ?Do not let these women's hearts break in vain.

This review pertains to the vegan options at the Stanford location. As another reviewer said, I'm disappointed that Ike's advertised something as vegan that wasn't (and continues to do so, though they have stopped serving the non-vegan item on vegan sandwiches at the Stanford location). I'd eaten several sandwiches with the veggie chicken, which was advertised as vegan. Then one time I ordered a sandwich which was supposed to have the chicken, but came with the veg turkey instead. The workers there told me the veg chicken they had been using actually wasn't vegan. This had been advertised and served on vegan sandwiches for at least a year, I think. Now Ike's continues to list this meat substitute as vegan, but simply replaces it with a vegan (actually, I believe) turkey when you order a vegan sandwich that is supposed to have the chicken. This is upsetting 1) because they were serving non-vegan food advertised as vegan for quite awhile, when all it takes is one quick check of ingredients to avoid this and 2) because it continues to be advertised as vegan and replaced with an inferior (in my opinion) substitute without warning the customer. I wouldn't order the sandwich I had if I knew I was going to get the fake turkey instead. I don't really understand how this issue happened because Ike's seems sincere in their interest to offer vegan options. They even let you know that some of the bread has honey in it if you try to order a vegan option. I really appreciate their effort to offer vegan options, and don't demand that Ike's offer a vegan chicken, but they really shouldn't continue advertising it and switching it out for vegan turkey. Just take it off the menu as vegan, cmonnnn.

Ike's Place is a great place to get a really good unique and interesting sandwich. The Spiffy Tiffy is hands down my favorite. It really is nothing like I have ever had before as far as sandwiches go, and their list of unique and really really good tasting sandwiches goes on and on. Yes, the lines are long at peak lunch time... Call in your order and have your sandwich ready for you when you get there instead of complaining about waiting. Yes, the ambiance is... well casual and somewhat tacky (someone said something about it looking like a cafeteria?), but what do you expect? It's a sandwich place... This place has good seating and is well lit, so if you end up waiting a long time, its not too bad if you're in good company. Ike's does not have its own parking really, and it's kinda hard to find, but if you check out the pictures of the building (a couple posted here on yelp), once you're near, it'll be hard to miss. If you are looking for your classic sandwich with traditional tastes and good quality ingredients, then you should go to Driftwood on El Camino. If you want to try a new sandwich that will blow your mind, go to Ike's Place. I give Ike's Place five stars because it is a sandwich place that you can count on for making you a delicious and unique sandwich. That's all I care about when it comes to places like Ike's.

Dirty sauce. Ménage a trois. Dutch crunch. Somewhere in there is a metaphor for a sinfully delicious encounter, and that's how I'd have to describe my experiences so far. ?The Halal chicken can come out a little on the dryer side, but this is a small complaint for otherwise amazingly addicting sandwiches. The sandwiches come in half and full sizes- a reasonable person can get full off of half, but why would you when you can get the full size? The wait on the weekends have never been that bad before 12:30pm, and there's parking nearby if you know where you're going. You will want to make this trip, trust me!

I always heard the hype about Ike's sandwiches and finally got around to trying it at the San Francisco location (after which I DEFINITELY became a fan). When I heard that they were opening a location in Palo Alto I died a little inside, because that was only a 15 minute drive from my house. (When I heard that it was on Stanford's campus I was a little confused and kind of really jealous of all the students there, so lucky.) Whenever I go shopping at Stanford Shopping Center, I call in and order my sandwich. That way there is no wasted time, and I don't have to pay extra for the parking meter! The only thing I don't love about Ike's being on Stanford's campus is that I have to find a parking spot at the meters, pay for it, and cross my fingers that my sandwich is ready for pick up at the time they told me (which it always is!). The price is a little bit pricey, but if you finish with a full and happy stomach I say it's worth it. (And if that isn't enough, at least you get a nice caramel/apple lollipop to cheer you up!) The price at the Palo Alto location is slightly cheaper than the San Francisco location, but I think that's just because a bag of chips isn't included with it. My favorite sandwich (and honestly, the only one I've had at this location) is the Paul Reubens on Dutch Crunch! Yum. I can never wait to bite into the delicious sandwich the second I get it. (Side Note: the last time I was here and waiting in line to pick up my sandwich, Ike himself was here and PERSONALLY DELIVERING the sandwiches to students around the seating area. He'd call their names, they'd raise their hands, and he'd run it to them. Straight up dashing and sprinting to them with sandwich in hand and everything. Not gonna lie, that was pretty entertaining.)

Kinda hard to find this place based on the address (don't believe the marker on your iphone, it's on the OTHER side of the Engineering Building. ?I ended up circling the area even though I was allegedly standing right where the map said it was supposed to be, so that was annoying. Aside from that though, the sandwiches are pretty close to the level expected from the SF location, but not quite. ?Seems like there's less sauce and a little smaller than the Castro flagship. ?Also, they don't throw in the Dirty Chips with your order, so that was a little disappointing. ?That being said, the sandwiches are still really good, and if you can't make it to SF, this'll more than meet your Ike's craving.

Name of the Girl I'm Dating (MMMMMMhmMMMMMMM) World Championship - (Secret & not on the menu!) This place is located in a nook & crack on Stanford's campus. The trip here may seem overwhelming, but rest assumed the sandwich really makes up for it. What I must say I pride them on is that "dirty sauce" they put on every sandwich. I have no idea what is in it, but golly.. it really blew me away. The prices are pretty high for these sandwiches, but it's really delicious. You will leave here happy. What else could you ask for?

The place is really good as per food, amazing sandwich, but they have really really really sucky staff. I wonder why can't they hire decent staff or make proper channel! I get it they are really cool, but getting things done is equally important as is being cool I order at 11:15 for 7 full sandwiches to be picked up at 1:15 ( 2 hours in advance) , I go at 1:20 and they say ok now we will start making it.. i think this why u are better off ordering stupid pizza for meeting than getting a good sandwich, on the other hand u have nothing else to do in life, have all the time in the world, and want good sandwich ,Ikes is the place!

This place only gets 5 stars if you can plan ahead. ?You know: 1) Wake up 2) Realise you will want to eat lunch that day 3) Think "the tastiest lunch in Ike's sandwiches" 4) Go onto the smartphone app and place your order 5) Pick up your sandwich later that day Seriously, if you show up hoping to get place the order and get the sandwich you will be waiting for ever! ?I was amazed to see that at 1 PM on a Saturday there was a very long (just like a weekday) line. ?I ordered via my smartphone for a 3 PM pickup... and the line hadn't gotten any shorter by then. ?They close at 3 PM on a Saturday, so I fear many of those kind, hungry people were going to be sad and not get their sandwich. ?If you end up sad and without a sandwich, I'm sure you wouldn't give it 5 stars. Sure, it is expensive. ?So is everything else on campus worth eating. ?And half of the stuff not worth eating. ?There is no meal I would rather eat on campus than Ike's and for the money I actually end up full. ?On some days (where I won't be trying to live on one meal all day) a half sandwich is good enough.

Don't get me wrong, the sandwiches are bomb especially my Paul Reuben's that had sourdough with pastrami and poppy seed coleslaw..this was crazzzzy bombbb! It was $8! Now...turnoffs were getting to the place. I had to park at the damn Nordstrom Stanford shopping area and walk to this place..ughhh I swear it's not cool. There needs to be better and easier access to get here. Second, the time of getting my food took too damn long..I'm not sure how many people are wrapping up bread in the back but speed needs to change especially when there's soo many people coming. I also didn't like how the menu wasn't fully shown. I saw a white binder being passed around..that's a little un-classy. I will be coming back! I love these sandwiches

Ike's Place at Stanford University is a great discovery. Of course I've heard of the world famous Ike's in SF. This collage annex certainly lives up to the reputation of the "mother-ship". I had ?the "Matt Cain" and my wife had the "Jim Rome". Both were creative and ?delicious. Their special sauce is very tasty and should be bottled and sold in stores. The options of fresh baked breads are numerous, but I suggest their "signature" dutch crunch. Also, go for the large size, I made the mistake of ordering a half and was wanting for more. Ike's Place is located in the Engineering Building, however, it's not well marked, just ask one of the students walking around, they'll direct you. If you're working or visiting someone at the Stanford Hospital, don't settle for hospital food, seek out Ike's. You won't be disappointed.

I know I am supposed to love Ike's but I just can't. ? It is a true SF invention, has innovative sandwiches with names inspired by local and not so local celebrities, but, the bread is tough, stale and hard to chew, ?there was too much meat and mayo and not enough toppings. ?While it is fun that the sandwiches come with chips and a caramel apple candy, I would rather have a cheaper sandwich. ?$11 is too much for a takeout lunch that I don't want to finish. ? Finally, it just takes them too long to make a sandwich. ?I want them to take my order and return with my sandwich in less than ten minutes. ?Many other cafes/ sandwich shops have mastered this skill. ?I don't know why Ike's can't. ?True there is a long line, but I think it would move faster if they could just make a sandwich while I watched.

Even though I work on the other side of the campus I still make it my mission to get an Ike's Place sandwich (my crazy speed walking and trying not to get sweaty is totally worth it). The sandwiches are premium quality and as an added bonus they give you a lollipop (it really does make a difference). I always ordered my sandwiches via the Ike's Place app on my iphone so I can beat the line and get to my sandwich quicker. Some of the sandwiches are the same as the Cupertino Ike's Liar location and others are different so I recommend being adventurous and trying all of the sandwiches because even if they sound a bit strange they are still delicious.

Dirrrrrrrrty. That's how I like my sandwiches and my men. Wait... no... not men, just sandwiches. I like my men clean. Anyhoo... I digress. The sandwiches at Ike's are absolutely delicious and enormous. My personal favorite is the Lincecum. Avocado, havarti, ham, turkey and bacon. Add a little of their special dirty sauce, lettuce and tomato and it's orgasmic. My coworker introduced us to this place, since he's a sandwich aficionado and I've been forever changed. Also it's nice to walk on the beautiful stanford campus from time to time and chill on a nice warm day.

I am just not that into waiting in long ass lines for anything these days. ?I went to this Ike's the first week they opened - at that time, they only served full sandwiches, and they automatically came with chips and a piece of fruit. ?I really liked that. ?The sandwiches were also so obviously fresh and delicious. Now, however, I feel like it's gone downhill. ?You do have the choice of ordering a full or half sandwich (which I appreciate) but they no longer give you a bag of chips and a piece of fruit along with it, which is really a bummer. ?Also, after you wait forEVER for your sandwich, the bread is generally soggy.

I love Ike's. I am so glad they opened one nearby to me instead of me having to drive all the way to SF whenever I am craving this. My boyfriend has never tried this so I wanted him to get the Ike's experience. We decided to go after we were thinking of a place to eat in Palo Alto. It was kind of tricky navigating to this place only because it is on Stanford's college campus and I am not really familiar with it. After finding it you can park in the garage then walk over to the sandwich shop. The location is pretty cool because I got a feel of this prestigious college. When we got there it was 20 minutes till closing so it wasn't super packed. The location seems like its in a student union center or can be a study area as well. I like it because there is actually a place to sit and wait. I got the Al Bundy Sandwich and my boyfriend got the Matt Cain Sandwich. My boyfriend basically got everything in it and even added a Mozzarella Cheese Stick in it. I went the other way, I took out a part of their special sauce just because I do not like mayo. I didn't really want my sandwich to be dripping left and right so I kept it simple adding lettuce and tomato. The Al Bundy itself comes with ham, salami, cheddar cheese, avocado all on a toasted bread. TOO good. The portion sizes are a good amount and everything here is too good. I highly recommend this place one of my favorite sandwich spots!

I know everybody loves this place but... It took them 45 minutes to get our food after we ordered. Would have been fine as the place is busy but somehow, people who ordered right after each other got food 30 minutes apart. When they finally brought it out....hot sandwiches were cold...which means they had been sitting around. When we asked them to do something about it...they didn't give a shit because there are enough lemmings who think this place is great. They were assholes to use. I now boycott Ike's. Screw them.

I heard a lot about Ike's and my friend specifically invited me to come try it out. I had the Spiffy Tiffy. It wasn't bad, but it wasn't that great either (chicken meat was a little dry/chewy). Once you take away the crazy-names and the organic/halal meat, it's just a decent sandwich place. I much prefer Specialties to it. That's just me... Oh, they don't give cups out for water (apparently Stanford has banned disposable cups as part of a green initiative), but around the corner is a coffee machine that has cups and there is a water fountain downstairs.

Still delish. Menu's clearer on the board in the back. They no longer have water cups for conservation reasons, but they do have plenty of beverage options. My faves are still the Menage A Trois (BBQ sauce!) & "We're Just Friends" (orange glaze!). I'd go for the foot-long since that's the most bang for your buck considering a half-sandwich is more than half the price. Wheat bread's good as ever. Line's def died down from when it opened initially, though, this might be a result of it being the summer + early lunch (11:30am).

Ike's is a sandwich's sandwich. ?It is packed with the meat or vegetarian/vegan option you chose (no skimping here), loaded with toppings, and is always savory. ?The variety is unbeatable--if you want it, Ike's has it. ?I usually get the Jack Skellington, but if I picked something completely random from the menu it would be good as well. There is always a ridiculously long line here. ?I bypass this by calling my order in, so I can just go up to the side register to pick up and pay.

This is about to be really painful for me as I am a diehard Ike's fan, but the quality of this location is crazy inconsistent and more often disappointing than awesome. The last time I came, I ordered the Lincecum, so I was pretty surprised when I was delivered a Menage a Trois instead. Nonetheless, the Menage a Trois is pretty delish (although you certainly have to be in the mood for the savory-sweet bbq sauce/honey combination, which I definitely was not that day), so I unwrapped my sandwich and took a bite anyway -- only to find that the sandwich was literally freezing cold and soggy and the bread was unacceptably stale and old-tasting. It tasted as if it had been made hours before, and had been removed from a refrigerator and blasted in the microwave for 30 seconds immediately prior to serving. I've been to all 3 Ike's locations multiple times, and this was by far the worst experience I've had. On the other hand, I've had a few solid sandwiches here -- the Matt Cain being a standout (although I haven't ordered it at either of the other locations). Unlike the unfortunate Menage a Trois experience above, the sandwich was piping hot and delicious, served on an extremely fresh crunchy-on-top, soft-and-chewy-inside Dutch Crunch roll. My advice to those in the south bay with a hankering to try Ike's: go to the Redwood Shores location instead!!! It's WAY easier to find, the service is better, and the quality is more consistent -- it is totally worth it to pay a little more in transportation costs to drive up to Redwood City and enjoy Ike's as it's meant to be than to take a gamble on quality at Stanford.

Full 5 stars. FULL five. I love this place. I used to wait eagerly in line in the Mission back in the day when it was up in the city. Now, I wait eagerly in line at the Stanf. People who knock stars off for the wait are ridiculous -- how can you fault a place for being popular?? Know that the dutch crunch bread is serious -- if it doesn't shred up the roof of your mouth, you're not taking big enough bites. The Menage a Trois is their most famous sandwich (so 7 x 7 says, anyway), and if you're the rare sandwich-lover with a sweet tooth, this is the choice for you. Just remember to ask for extra napkins.

Simply loved the "Your Favorite Sesame Street Character" sandwich I first went there. So I decided to get the same for lunch today. I vaguely remembered that sandwich from previous time, so was expecting avacado, tomato, lettuce, and cheese (a nice thick slice). When I got my order, I see there is no cheese. I thought for few minutes if this is the same sandwich I had first time, I wasn't 100% sure. So when I came back to look on Ike's website at home, I see the picture. Picture had thick slice of cheese with other goodies ! I am so disappointed right now, because my expectations were clearly not met. I think cheese made the sandwich awesome the first time. How can you forget the most important ingredient? Anyways, next time I am going to place my order after looking at the picture online.. they don't serve what they tell.

I'm hard to please when it comes to sandwiches, but I made sounds of ecstasy when I took my first bite of the Jaymee Sirewich. My girlfriend and I split that with a Matt Cain w/mozzarella sticks added. Both were equally tasty. I actually regret getting mozzarella sticks because they aren't gooey at all. It just feels like you're biting into a piece of string cheese. Definitely not worth an extra $2.92. Yes, these sandwiches run you $10 each for a large, but think about something for a second. When you go to Togos, you pay $5-$6 for mediocre ingredients and small portions. So you get what you pay for. Ike priced the sandwiches very fairly in my opinion. Line was fine when we went in the afternoon around 3pm. We just walked up to the register and was helped out by the friendly employee at register.

I never knew a sandwich could taste so good. There are some really funky sandwiches at Ike's and I really wasn't brave enough to try anything all that crazy since it was my first time. I had the Jim Rome and let me tell you, I was in HEAVEN! Much to my disappointment, they didn't have avocado when I went, but I subbed the avocado for cucumbers and it was still one awesome sandwich. The red pesto and the dutch crunch bread really did it for me... and I don't know exactly what is in their dirty sauce, but it is effing delicious. I'm sad I popped my Ike's cherry because we all know things aren't as good the second time around. :( Four stars because they ran out of avocado (if you've read my other reviews you know running out of ingredients/things on the menu is a pet peeve of mine) and also because the sandwiches are really pricey. I can't believe they have sandwiches going for as much as ~$20?! Ridiculous. If they are going to charge that much for their sandwiches they should reinstate the +fruit and chips deal they used to have.

It doesn't beat La Lucha sandwiches in Peru, but it's the closest I'll find at home. I'm a sandwich lover, and I LOVE Ike's. No better spot for it than on campus, though I wish they delivered. For those of you who aren't familiar with Stanford campus, you should just go to the Redwood City location which is way more accessible. While you can walk over to the engineering quad and order, the smarter thing to do is ?use the iphone application to have your order ready exactly when you want it and then go pick it up without a wait. The app even saves your favorites and your info to make it a speedy process. Not the cheapest sandwiches, but the price for the whole is not so bad (compared to all the other overpriced stuff you pay for in palo alto) and they are super flavorful and filling. Don't leave leftovers for the next day though, as the bread gets soggy and it no longer has that crunch.

Pretty good sandwich, though I don't know if I'd rave about it as highly as most other people do. I try to be adventurous with their sandwiches every time I go, and I've yet to be disappointed. Now their line... it's ridiculously long, and probably not for good reason, as I don't need to be sweet-talked while I'm ordering my food. However, they have an iPhone app to let you order your sandwich ahead of time, so it's no longer been an issue for me. They always set you up nice with chips/fruit and a drink, and of course their caramel apple lollipops (I'm not gonna lie, it's a huge part of the appeal for me!). Prices of their sandwiches are a bit high for the half, but if you get the full, its a pretty good deal, so go for it and save the other half if necessary!

This would get five stars if it wasn't so difficult to get to. No matter how many times I've been, I still get lost, and I never get quite as flustered and grumpy as when I don't get my sandwich. Ordering ahead is also frustratingly hit or miss: sometimes I've been told they take orders up to a half hour before closing, but most times they refuse to and I have to literally jump out of the car before my friend can park and sprint there. Ike's will always be worth it though, and I'm so glad that I don't have to drive all the way up to San Francisco for it. NB: their sandwiches are mostly the same but with different names, so I would definitely check out the ingredients in detail on the online menus and figure out what your usual from San Francisco is called at the Stanford location.

If you don't have a smart phone, look at the online menu before heading over here. When I came here, they said they don't have a menu to look at. I came here a couple of weeks ago and ordered the Hollywood's SF Cheesesteak (thinly sliced rib eye, mushrooms, and provolone). I thought the sandwich was all right, but a little pricey. FYI, you can't order half a Hollywood's SF Cheesesteak . The steak in half of my sandwich was cooked and the other half was raw. When I noticed the meat was still raw, I brought it back asking if they could make me a new half. The employee that helped me was very nice and made me a full size sandwich even though I told him it was unnecessary. I'll probably come back again in the near future to try the Menage A Trois

I don't know how they do it. ?I mean, how do you make a sandwich that's literally dripping with sauce and liquid and stuff so that the bread is soaked and wet but the halal chicken remains dry and tough. ?I just do not understand. ?Must be some sort of new modern sandwich technology. This location, summer or not, has always been fairly busy when I've visited. ?They have a lot of vegan and vegetarian options, but few that don't involve some sort of breaded and fried product of extreme unhealthiness. Lots of topping choices, interesting sauces, even more interesting names. ?I can see why it's a popular place ... sort of. ?But for me it's just okay. ?Too much sauce, too messy, and not worth the wait. You *can* call ahead and order if you don't mind being on hold, and they don't decide they're too busy. ?And they stock some of the more popular options in the vending machine around the corner if you're really in a hurry. But this is not anywhere near sandwich perfection, at least in my experience.

A friend rightly described these as the best sandwiches on Stanford's campus. ?The dutch crunch bread is tasty, sturdy, and satisfying-- the perfect thing to hold up a messy sandwich. ?The first one I got, some sort of spicy chicken sandwich, was excellent, and I look forward to trying many more-- especially the extensive vegetarian selection, perhaps supplemented with onions, pickles, and peppers. ?The line wasn't even that long. I'm very glad to have discovered a replacement for Best Sandwich Co. in my weekly routine.

Ever since I saw this on Man vs Food I knew this is one of the places I had to try. We headed out ?for our team lunch find this place @ Stanford campus which is quite a journey coming from San Jose but so worth it. I knew what I wanted and had to try the "Menage et Trois" with the dirty sauce hee hee.... It was as good as it get's chicken, honey bbq sauce was tasty on the dutch crunch. It did get messy, you will need extra napkins of course I got some on my shirt but ooh well for later ; ) Boss got the "Vegan Terminator" said it was good not the best as claimed on their website. Someone else got the "Name of the girl I'm dating" I tried some of it and it was really good too. I can't wait to go back and try the "Spiffy Tiffy" or the "Lincecum" ooh so many choices!

Ike's Place is definitely my go-to place for great sandwiches. The portions are big, and the sandwiches are so tasty! I had my first Ike's sandwich at the SF location around New Year's, and couldn't stop thinking about them since. I was ecstatic to discover that there's a location in Palo Alto, since I live in Cupertino. The dirty sauce (delicious secret sauce) and dutch crunch bread make it worthwhile to drive 30 mins from Cupertino to the Stanford campus. My favorite is definitely the Matt Cain - roast beef, turkey, salami, godfather sauce, provolone, yum!! They also recently lowered their prices by $1, though you don't get the bag of dirty chips with the meal - still available for separate purchase. The only downside is that it's difficult to find because it's in the middle of the Stanford campus, inside the Forbes Family Cafe in the Engineering Center. There's currently construction going on around Via Ortega, so you have to drive from Panama St, and park at the parking structure there. The wait can be pretty long, so be sure to call in ahead of time and skip to the front of the line!

I am not a huge sandwich person, but the sandwich I got here was surprisingly good. I got the [name of girl i'm dating] sandwich. I wasn't sure if the halal chicken in this sandwich would be good since I've never had halal chicken before. I was also scared the chicken would be too dry, because I usually feel this is the case for sandwiches with chicken in it. BUT i was pleasantly surprised. It was moist and the sandwich tasted great! I also heart honey mustard so this may also be why I loved this sandwich. Got it with the dutch crunch. This place gets pretty packed around lunch time, so my friends and i ordered our sandwiches right when it opened at 10am and picked them up around 12. When we got there, the "order here" line was incredibly long and the "pick up here" line had no one! I suggest you order your sandwiches early. There is also an Ike's place mobile phone app that you can place your order on if you don't want to wait on the phone to place an order :)

I love Ikes and found out that this place just opened since San Francisco is too chilly for this time to wait in the cold so hearing about this place, I had to drag my best friend and boyfriend to experience it's goodness! When we arrived to Stanford, it was really hard to find the place. We had to use the campus map and even that was a little confusing. Eventually we found the place and to our surprise at 11:30, there isn't a long line like San Francisco. But that was fine by me because I was hungry! At this particular location, they do not give free chips with a sandwich because their price is cheaper than SF but fear not. You still get your caramel apple lollipop. Anyways, the sandwich I wanted wasn't on the menu which is the Hollywood Cheesesteak but I still asked for it and sure enough, they know how to make it! So we waited for a couple minutes and a whole rush of people were behind us and continued to crowd until we got our sandwiches and left. Which means that even at this location, no one can get enough of Ikes! I loved my sandwich here and would recommend people to come here since it's closer but sill still go to the one in SF if I'm ever in town.

Occasion: Picking up lunch with co-workers What I Had: 'Sometimes I'm a Vegetarian' Food Review: LOVE their vegetarian sandwich. Their 'Sometimes I'm a Vegetarian' includes: Mushrooms, Marinated Artichoke Hearts, Pesto, Provolone. DELISH! Just the right amount of pesto sauce, too! I like that the bread wasn't dry (maybe with the help of the pesto!). They really did a swell job with the mushrooms to the point where I was checking to see if they had actually put meat in by accident (phantom umami perhaps??). ? Service Review: Service was fine! We were just picking up our order, so not much to say here, but the cashiers were all cheerful. Venue Review: The line was really long, but luckily the place is in a Stanford indoor dining area so we could wait while sitting around at the tables. Stanford is a beautiful campus, and I could totally see students grabbing their sandwiches in the afternoons and eating outside in the quad areas or out by the lawn. Overall Impression: Top notch quality sandwich, actually the best vegetarian sandwich I've ever had! It's well worth the wait.

PROS: + Matt Cain + Menage a Trois + Great bottled drink selection CONS: - Long Wait - Parking is a pain I came here with my family the first time and everyone loved it. Then I came here with a co-worker who decided to do a custom sandwich, and ended up order like 15 items in the sandwich. We heard the guys in the back groan and say, "What the hell is this!" when his order went back. HAHAHA! Our order took a bit longer because they were all confused by the items chosen. The short version of the list is jalapeno popppers, onions rings, no veggies, lots of meat, not sauce, maybe oil and vinegar. But it turned out great according to him! I got the Menage a Trois, almost as good as the real thing. If you don't know what the real thing is, go ask your parents....just kidding, google it, haha.....NO DONT do that, its not important. Anyways....the sandwich is a great mix of sweet and savory, just like the name.... The Matt Cain is great roast beef, turkey and salami sandwich with their god father sauce, which I didn't get a chance to analyze because I eat everything so quickly. This ones excellent. I they have a great bottled drinks selection! some stuff I have never even heard of. And all soda taste better from a glass bottle, you can't go wrong with any selection. They do take their time making the sandwich, which is good and bad. Since this location is on campus, its a pain because you have to pay for parking on campus. This is one of my go-to places for sandwiches. It should be one of yours too. Enjoy!

It took us forever to find this place. ?Visitor parking is difficult to find on campus and Via Ortega was closed when we went through there (late August). Then it took us a while to realize that it was inside the engineering building; then we had to find the engineering building. But, we eventually made it. ? And it was totally worth all that hassle because the sammiches were damn near amazing! I had a [name of the girl i'm dating] on their crunchy bread and, i swear, it was one of the best sandwiches I have ever eaten. ? Sure, it's smack in the middle of Standford campus and the line is always long, but who cares, this place is amazing. Don't miss out!

Over the summer, you couldn't really go there between 12-1 because the lines were so long... ?I can't imagine what it will be like once the undergrads arrive. ?You can download their app and call your order in earlier (you can even order to pick up after they've closed (as long as it's within a certain time period that you'll pick it up)). ? This place has fantastic vegan and vegetarian options. ?It is a tad pricey for a sandwich, but the sandwiches are good. ?Oh yes, and they're probably really unhealthy. ?I usually tell them to go light on the dirty sauce. ?[My Favorite Sesame Character] was one of my fave sandwiches. ?But honestly, you really can't go wrong on this one. ?Just order whatever and enjoy.

I really like this place for having an appealing vegan lunch option. ?The vegan sandwiches are both tasty and have enough protein to satisfy a born-and-raised Midwesterner. ?(Note that after I've lived in CA for the last 7 years, I still prefer more protein than most natives, but less than what I am served whenever I go back to TX. ;) ) ?I almost always order the vegan captain Corey, and they've never made it badly. That said, the main reason I come here is that it is ~300 meters from my office in Gates. ?And I NEVER go during lunch time: the wait is just too ridiculous, especially when I'm hungry. ?I sometimes come here for dinner for a late night @ the office, because they stay open until 7pm, and they get very few customers in the evening, so the wait time is much more reasonable. If you really want to have some Ike's for lunch, your best bet would be to call in and place an order at about 10am or earlier. ?I wouldn't recommend just walking in much past 11.

This is amazing!!! ?I ordered the Paul Reubens sandwich and it was a 1000x delicious! ?The pastrami and the poppy seed coleslaw with the french dressing created the perfect taste combination. ?It was a bit messy, as the dressing would ooze out, but so worth it! ?Would definitely order this one again, but have yet to try the many other mouth-watering sandwiches they serve. ? Only thing disappointing is the price, otherwise I'd rate it a five. ?I paid about $6-7 for HALF of a sandwich!!! ?When I ordered the half, I assumed it would be a good, decent size, knowing that it was about seven bucks, come on now, that's almost the price of an average full-sized sandwich at many places. ?The whole sandwich is $10, which i thought was pricey. ?So, I went with the half and ended up still being hungry! ?

Is it worth $11 to get a full sized sandwich? Probably not. BUT OMG was it delicious. Expect to make a mess. And always call ahead! If you're hankering for something sweet, go with the Menage a Trois. If you want something savory, try the Spiffy Tiffy. Ike's Love Hour special is 3-6 on weekdays, 3-5 on weekends. You get free chips and a can of soda. But they're rule sticklers, so don't expect to get anything at 5:05... Expensive. But SUPER tasty. And thank God they're on the far side of campus, because Lord knows I'd be obese and incredibly poor by now. They could use a real improvement with the attitude though. I've only been here twice, but they look like they hate my existence and don't want me there. Sorry dude, I'm just hungry. If you don't want me ordering, don't make such darn good sandwiches. Edit: Apparently they don't give away free chips anymore. Seriously?!

Ike's Place makes delicious sammies. ? They have a long menu of varied options, good fresh breads and ingredients, delicious halal chicken unique as a sandwich fixing, and tasty garlic pesto mayo house sauce. ? The only knock to Ike's is that it's grossly OVERPRICED (approx. $12 for their typical sandwich). ?There's far too much potential for $12 to make Ike's average sized sandwiches worth a semi-regular visit. ? There are also better things to do with your time, considering this location inside Stanford's Engineering quad is only convenient if you're walking through this part of campus. ?Parking isn't particularly close or easy, and the lunch time hours guarantee a long wait. ?CALL YOUR ORDER IN EARLY (i.e. in their first hour of being open) if you're anticipating lunch at Ike's. ?Otherwise, orders (also submittable via their App) can only be prepared for 2-4 hours from call-in time, so be ready to wait. ? What I've had: Their dutch crunch roll is a winner. ?I typically opt for wheat bread with sammies (and theirs is delish), but this doughy bread with a moist inside and crackly top (made by a lather of rice flour, butter, sugar and yeast applied before baking) is irresistible. ?It's also flexible, fitting well with nearly any sandwich. ?On a fun note, dutch crunch is apparently unique to NorCal and Oregon. ? Spiffy Tiffy... this sandwich is worth going out of your way for. ?Shredded halal chicken, mushrooms, avocado, pesto, provolone, and the house sauce make a wonderful combination on wheat bread or a dutch crunch roll. ? SF Giants... turkey, bacon, avocado, swiss. ?Nice combo, delicious lunch. ? Menage a Trois... the halal chicken is awesome, but the honey + honey mustard + bbq is a bit complicated and overly sweet. ? Jim Rome...turkey, red pesto, avocado, and cheddar goodness. ?Nothing to write home about, but it's a reliable lunch fix. ? In all, Ike's makes some good sandwiches at an overly steep price.

I finally went to Ike's this weekend. ?I was convinced it would not live up to the hype, but the buzz is completely deserved. ?Appreciated the willingness of the staff to freely swap out ingredients to get to the exact sandwiches we wanted. Ike's offers some really unique tastes and combinations, which made some 'typical' sandwich combinations extra tasty. The 'red pesto' was a great adder to our sandwiches. Sitting outside in the Engineering Quad is a terrific experience too. ?Only reason I'm giving it 4 stars is that the sandwiches are expensive, which makes it an occasional treat rather than a frequent go-to location.

There's a lot of hype about Ike's, and I'm sure that Stanford felt really lucky when they found out they were getting one on campus! ?(I know I'm jealous!!) Like any other Ike's location, this place gets super packed during lunchtime. ?Unless you're ok with waiting, come before 11:15am or after 2pm. ?Even when you come at those times, there is a bit of a wait for the sandwich. ?Without a line at the cashier, I think I waited almost 15 minutes for my sandwich. I ordered the Menage a Trois (as per Yelpers' suggestions). ?When I had first read the desciription of this sandwich (Halal Chicken, Real Honey, Honey Mustard, BBQ Sauce, Pepper Jack, Swiss, & Cheddar), I was a bit skeptical. ?Honey? ?In my sandwich? ?Not so sure about that. BUT. ?The first bite convinced me otherwise. ?This sandwich is PACKED with flavor and is honestly one of the best sandwiches I've ever had. ?Sweet and savory and delicious. ?Maybe not everyone will agree (although the plethora of reviews seem like most will), but it's definitely worth trying. For a sandwich, it IS pretty pricey. ?If you find that it is amaaaaazing like I did, then it's worth it. ?If you don't, great! ?One less person to beat out in line :)

In general, I'm not a sandwich fan.... but I was really intrigue to try Ike's sandwiches after all the hypes and rave reviews. My coworkers have been trying to get Ike's sandwich for lunch in the past month..3 times fail because they didn't call early enough and the voicemail boxes were always full! Finally, when the HR asked us for a suggestion to order office lunches.. we voted for Ike's Place Sandwich unanimously, so we placed a large order the day prior... email the "nachoboy" :) The pluses: LOTS of creative sandwich options....lots of vegan sandwiches..and cool names :) I traded my sandwich with two coworkers.. so we got to try THREE sandwiches at a time.. so here are my verdicts: - My fave of the three: Menage A Trois, the real honey and honey mustard certainly added sweetness and mixed well with chicken and BBQ sauce. It was not too sweet like BBQ pulled pork sandwich. - Spiffy Tiffy: The chicken was really tasty, the pesto sauce was garlicky but didn't take over the flavor of other ingredients, but I thought they were too skimpy with the mushroom topping and needed extra salt for more bold flavor. - Lincecum was our least favorite of the three... nothing special and really skimpy on the meat...!!! The sandwiches are a bit drenchy (especially the menage a trois!)...so you should eat it asap...leftover will be gross because the bread will be overly soggy! Price wise...it's pretty steep!!! Also.. most of us finish the FULL sandwich.. half would be the diet portion ...it's not big! O...after eating the sandwiches... three of us who traded sandwiches and a coworker who ordered Menage A Trois... got stomach ache.. so we were wondering if the Menage A Trois had some issues that day!!! Won't be back anytime soon..but it was certainly a great sandwich experience :)

We came here after all the hype. ?It took forever to find parking, pretty long time waiting in line but not too horrible, I guess . . . . The cashier was fairly friendly when we finally got up there. ?Quick and with a smile we ordered and then were waiting. ?I kind of feel rushed at the cashier though since it is such a long line and everyone is waiting. It is located in a dining hall type place, while a large area it is not intimate and just like a cafeteria. ?Not much for ambiance. Our sandwiches were indeed pretty darn good and a big portion. ?While I forget exactly what we ordered now, I remember the yummy sauce and fresh bread. ?Good sandwiches. We haven't been back since though, with the wait and the sandwiches being good and not tasting like heaven, I just can't imagine coming back. ?Worth checking out once or going when they might have off times (is that ever?).

Matt Cain, why are you so damn delicious! The sammich, not the baseball player. With your warm meatiness and yummy sauce dripping all over the place (godfather sauce drippings make for great chip dip - and bring a mint, or maybe 10 cause your breath will be kiiiiickin') Ike's was so smart to open this location on Stanford campus, and yes, they are open on Sundays. There isn't a long line and it's nice and quiet, a few students and families here and there, but nothing like the hustle and bustle of a week day. Also, it's nice to grab some sammiches to go and walk over to the Roudin Sculpture Garden on the side of the Cantor to enjoy your meal on a beautiful sunny day.

came back and got a Lincecum. Without question the greatest sandwich I've ever experienced. Make sure to ask for pickles, peppers, and onions they don't come on the sandwiches but they're free to add. With the Lincecum and the Matt Cain Giants starting pitchers are the sandwiches to get at Ike's. I think the Lincecum just edges out the Cain though. The parking can be a little overwhelming during the week. There aren't very many spaces and you've got to pay, but I noticed that parking is not enforced on weekends or past 4:00 PM so you can park where ever you want then.

Believe it. My review is mainly for the ...stupid eggplant sandwich, which is hands down the best sandwich I've ever had. The first time I ate it, I almost cried it was so delicious. Seriously. The vegetarian and vegan offerings are plentiful. Parking is a bit of a pain in the ass since it's located on a college campus. But, don't let that deter you. Once you have a bite of Ike's, you'll wonder how you could ever wrap your mouth around another.

This is how sandwiches should always be, period. We live at Stanford and recently discovered Ikes place. Lots of friends had recommended the place, but it looked a little pricey for just a sandwich. But here's the thing, it is not "just a sandwich". ?It is probably one of the best sandwiches you'll ever have. We've become regulars now. ?I love the Jaymee Sirewich sandwich!! very tasty! My husband is a vegetarian and he usually goes for the Your Favorite Sesame Street Character Sandwich and he can't stop talking about the pesto sauce.... The size of the sandwiches are big enough so that he doesn't complaint afterward that he is still hungry as is usually the case after we eat sandwiches. We usually call to order and then pick them up because the wait can be long. I would highly recommend this place for anyone visiting Stanford.

Graduation weekend wasn't the best time to try out the Stanford Ike's location, that's for sure. A 45 minute wait just to order...yeah, wasn't sure if it was gonna be worth it. But it still delivered! Three of us shared the fabled Kryptonite, which actually came as two sandwiches since they didn't have a dutch crunch roll big enough. Sure it made the sandwich seem less than it should, but I found it way more manageable to take down. And of course we shared a Matt Cain on the side. That sandwich is hands down my favorite and always delivers with the godfather sauce. No wonder it won the ESPN sandwich contest! So, my advice is to go here and grab a sandwich. Just don't do it on Graduation weekend...I'm warning you!

AMAZING. BEST SANDWICH. I'm a big sandwich person, so the fact that this made me deliciously omgasm is a GREAT sign! I ordered the MENAGE A TROIS (they have very interesting names for their sandwiches!) on Dutch bread. OMG. Dutch bread is AMAZING, It's crispy and crunchy. Very sturdy, holds up real well. Also order the menage a trois if you like slightly sweet things / sweet sandwiches. They also have good drinks on the side as well, including the leningrad soviet drink, and some cream sodas. Very clean and open area to eat and enjoy your sandwiches as well! Sidenote: this is a green building, so they don't hand out cups or anything.

Just had a Nacho Boy from Ike's Place and it was delicious. ?The meat stack was fairly thick and the other toppings were great as well. ?The Dutch Crunch was also nice and crusty as well. ?The only disappointing thing today was that they didn't carry meatballs. ?I don't know if that's typical ?or I got unlucky, but that made me a bit sad. For me this is a pretty good weekend spot, as I really don't want to deal with the madness that is Stanford during the work week with a much greater amount of foot and automobile traffic.

Got the Jim Rome (turkey, avocado, pesto sauce) - since I was a newbie, didn't know it came with "dirty sauce" so was kinda surprised by it but turned out to be delicious! Bread was really good and lots of veggies and meat. Guys tend to say the large is too small for them but I couldn't finish the whole thing and only ate a half. However, there was a lot of sauce in it so it kinda made a part of my bread slightly soggy, which I hate. The price is also a little steep for a student's budget. Will probably only go here if I have friends visiting and need to take them to a tasty place on campus!

I love Buster Posey! The catcher, haven't tried the sandwich yet. I love Matt Cain! The pitcher and the sandwich. ?Matt Cain is a solid sandwich, I've had it twice and it was just as exciting and delicious as the first time. I love Tony Soprano! The sandwich. ?Whatever they do what they do to the salami is insane!! I love Ike of Ike's Place. And I've met him too...I don't know why I was so star struck. ?Quite a handsome gentleman too. ?"Love to you" too Ike! I love Ike's Place! Just not a fan of this location. ?Not sure why Ike picks these selective, off the wall, locations that caters to a select group of individuals, i.e. Stanford and Redwood Shores. ?I still love the sandwiches though...damn it for making me drive out of my way and burn some super unleaded gas. If you're unfamiliar with the campus, it can be a little hard to find, unless you happen to be one of the thousand geniuses that attend Stanford, then, it's simple as "Pi." Same rules apply as Redwood Shores, call in your order! ?We went on a Sunday afternoon thinking it'd be quiet and no, it definitely wasn't. ?However at this location, the price includes a bag of chips, which is why I was wondering the menu was like a buck more here.

Damn, I definitely got the wrong sandwich the 1st time I tried Ike's out. This time I gotta admit, that quality was definitely there in my Matt Cain sandwich. The sauces at Ike's are KILLER, definitely the key element of the sandwich. Only things holding Ike's back from being a 5 star sandwich shop. 1. A little too pricey 2. Terrible location for non Stanford students 3. Wait time for your sandwich is quite long A couple other things I digged about Ike's place. - Free scrumptious caramel apple pop for right after you kill your meal - Spacious area to grub out compared to Redwood Shores location - Cashier is a look a like of J-Wow from Jersey Shore

Although, the first experience the Ninja had with Ike's in SF was rough (over an hour wait.. seriously... it was not the Biz...)... in the end the Ninja devoured his sammy with luv. But waiting over an hour.. never again.. .::Overall::.

I regret coming here for the first time because now I'm gonna forever crave these sandwiches! DIRECTIONS: I graduated from Stanford before all these engineering buildings existed, so I felt like an idiot after initially thinking I could easily find Ike's. ?For those not familiar with the new engineering quad: -Park in Parking Structure 2 on Panama and Via Ortega (free on weekends and after 4pm on weekdays) -Walk across Via Ortega past Y2E2 (Jerry Yang and Akiko Yamazaki Environment and Energy Building) -Look for the Huang Engineering Center. Ike's is inside there in the 1st floor Forbes Cafe area. Or, just look for outdoor patio seating in that vicinity-- it'll lead you to either Coupa Cafe or Ike's. I was here mid-Tuesday afternoon, and it took me about half an hour to get my sandwich. ?The soft/chewy/crispy Dutch Crunch bread with that garlicky dirty sauce was AMAZING! ?I got a Menage a Trois, but I think I could be happy with just lettuce and that bread alone.

Really good sandwiches but expensive for the portion, having to pay for parking and having to wait. I miss the days when they let me order fried mozzarella sticks ON THE SIDE. The last time I went I ordered it in the sandwich (it's mandatory.. lame) and they forgot to include it. Price for 2 sandwiches and one soda was about $25. Good sandwiches with a hefty price.

this is going to be really short. This place is not the place to go if your specifically looking for Ike's. This place makes Ike's look really bad. The flavoring and quality just doesn't compare to the other Ike's. Service is REALLY slow here, the bread is already soggy when it comes out. If you really want Ike's then I'd suggest going to the redwood shores one or the actual ike's in san francisco. There IS a new one in redwood city as well, never been there so I don't know if its good. One thing that's cool about this Ike's is. You can place an order on your iphone and i think even pay. Not really sure how it works, but it's possible.

I've heard of Ike's for a long time but never got the chance to try it until the Stanford location opened up. We've been back several times and the sandwiches have always been super tasty. My first sandwich was a Spiffy Tiffy and I was amazed at how flavorful it was and definitely not dry. On our latest visit, we got the Menage A Trois which has halal chicken, honey, honey mustard, bbq, pepper jack, swiss, and cheddar. We got it on the Dutch crunch bread and it was pure deliciousness. I really like the fact that the dutch crunch doesn't scratch up the roof of my mouth. Be sure to ask to for the lettuce, tomatoes, and other fixings since they don't come by default. ?The sandwiches can be messy, so load up on the napkins. Wait times can get long, so save yourself some time by calling in your order before heading over. If you have an iphone, you can even use the free Ike's Place app to place your order!

Friendly tips for visitors unfamiliar with the Stanford campus: - Parking on campus is free on the weekends. The closest parking is PARKING STRUCTURE 2. The following directions will be assuming you will park at this structure. (Just google map 475 Via Ortega for directions to get you to the parking structure) - As you exit the structure there will be a white building right in front of you. Look for a breezeway/arcade/open underground open hallway. Start walking down that hallway. - On the left there will be courtyard. Start walking in the courtyard and towards 475 Via Ortega on your right. - If you find yourself in a fancy cafeteria and smell garlic, you have arrived. I went on a Sunday thirty minutes before closing and there a good amount of people still ordering. It took about 20 minutes before our order was ready. I got the half 'Ex-Boyfriend' and it was pretty delicious. It's definitely not a 'Subway, Eat Fresh Sandwich', but more of a cheat day sandwich.

MMMM delicious sandwiches. ?This is not your regular Subway or Quiznos. ?The sandwich that I had, "The Name of Girl I'm Dating", was sooo delicious, all the different tastes from the ingredients meshed together into a scrumptious party in my mouth. ?I ordered a half size, but immediately regretted it later, because I could've easily finished a full. Located inside the Stanford campus, here are directions on how to get there: 1. Google map the address (it should take you right to parking structure 2) 2. park in parking structure 2 ?(parking is free after 4 on weekdays, and free all day on weekends) 3. walk past the Jerry Yang building 4. look for outdoor seating, there will be a building labeled Huang right by it Arrived at 4pm on a Sunday afternoon and it was not busy at all. ?Can't comment on the weekdays over all. ?I was pretty surprised at how delicious the sandwich was just because there had been so many rave reviews on it. ?Believe the hype.

Tucked away deep inside the Stanford campus, a short (though not well-marked) walk from the parking garage through the hallowed halls to where the entrance is located, these sandwiches are definitely worth the trek. I had the Spiffy Tiffy with added bacon (if you're going to do it, go all the way!) and it was pure heaven. The sandwiches are hefty, hearty and oh so tasty. Cap it off with a caramel apple lollipop and your experience is complete. Sandwiches are fresh, made to order and served quickly. Eat outside for a real collegiate feel. Tip: check out the menu on-line ahead of time; there are no sign boards and only a couple of very well-worn paper copies available for use at the counter.

Came here once and left happy. Came here twice and left happy again. I don't think I will ever leave here unsatisfied. Had the Captain Corey and to be honest it is very good. Maybe because it is smothered with the special sauce and sweet orange glaze sauce, but the vegan chicken patty is good. Possibly too good to not be chicken! Not at all bland. Try it with OrangeCreme soda and you'll be in sandwich heaven. My friend had the We're Just Friends, the real chicken version of it and claimed it tasted scrumptious. The sandwiches here are sooooo good, I don't care it is unhealthy version of sandwiches. I can binge on these foreverrr.

The sandwiches are awesome! It's true: You do have to jump through a lot of hoops to get a simple order... The line, occasionally incompetent staff, and unavoidable confusion are as much a part of Ike's as the delicious sandwiches. It helps to phone in your order 30 minutes before you want to pick it up. This method isn't always convenient, but sometimes the customer has to put in a little effort, too.

The new Ike's place at Stanford campus was a HUGE disappointment. I love Ike's Place in San Francisco and Redwood Shores, but this one is definitely not worth going to for me. Here's how I break it down: Pros - Plenty of seating. It's in some sort of student center so there are plenty of tables and chairs to enjoy your meal. This is the only plus, relative to the other locations. Cons - - Hard to find. I had the address in Google maps on my phone, yet it took me at least 20 minutes of walking around campus to find this place. There are no signs making it clear, even when you're 20 feet away from it. - Paid parking. I had to pay for parking! - No fresh baked bread. At this location I ordered and my sandwich was ready 5 minutes later. Some may see faster service as a pro, but I used to love the fact that Ike's Place baked their bread to order, explaining the 20 minute wait for sandwiches. I don't know why they're sacrificing one of the biggest factors that made their food unique at this new location. - Small and expensive. The guy at the counter explained that they offer half-sized sandwiches at this location and that their prices are cheaper than the SF location. Unfortunately this means that they sell half-sized sandwiches for the same price of a full sandwich at Redwood Shores. I spent $17 on two tiny sandwiches, and both me and my brother were still hungry after finishing the meal (we even had free chips because of a coupon from their mailing list). Definitely not worth the price. - Temporary cons: no credit card, no telephone for phone orders, and limited selection of sandwiches. They claim they will fix this when business starts to increase. Overall, this location is not worth going to. It's deep in campus so it takes forever to get to, paid parking, small sandwiches and NO FRESH BAKED BREAD (the worst, in my opinion). It may be worth it for Stanford students if they want an expensive sandwich, but everyone else should make the drive to Redwood Shores for a real meal.

I'm lucky to work on Stanford campus, so the walk to Ike's is about 5 min. Yayyy for my tummy, but not so good for my waistline. ;) I still remember my first sandwich there... it was like a dream. lol. I love hot pastrami, so I went with the "Say Hey!" I took my first bite and needed a moment of silence because it was so freaking good. I had to take another slow bite just to make sure I wasn't imagining all of it's goodness. It's the dirty sauce in the bread that does it to me. I'm sure of it. Hahaha! Really though, I have since tried about a dozen sandwiches since my first time and I have enjoyed them all. I love the variety and all the sides you can add/remove. Sometimes though, I just go with the "John Elway" and add mushrooms & red pesto. That is usually my go to one, when I'm not in the mood to try something new. I actually keep a printout of their menu at my desk, so when I try a new sandwich, I can make little notes about each experience. Then I go on to try the next one. I have to try them all eventually... they are that awesome! Yes, I agree the sandwiches are super messy and pricey. Today I paid just over $14 for my large go to Elway with my usual fixins and a bag of chips. Brought my own bottle of water. However, I'd rather pay 14 bucks for an awesome sandwich that not only over-fills me, but also makes me happy-happy... rather than a $7-10combo that's just okay! Ike's is it for me, even though I need to use 4-5 napkins to keep myself presentable during my chomp fest. ;) The lines get crazy long here, so either come before 11:15ish or after 2ish. If you're not familiar with the campus, it is very difficult to find. Ike's is inside the Huang Engineering building on Via Ortega. There are no Ike's signs outside, so look for the building name. Also, if you're not from campus, I recommend coming on the weekend instead. Parking is free on weekends, plus the lines aren't as crazy. You can grab your sammich, chips & drink, and enjoy the beautiful scenery that is Stanford. Sometimes we bring the kiddos and the hulking dog and go for a bike ride / run around the campus first, then stop in for a late lunch. Everyone loves it! :)

Ike's made my favorite sandwich (Turkey Bacon Avocado on Dutch Crunch) even better by adding that dirty sauce on it. Mmmmm diiiiirty sauce. If you like turkey sandwiches, get the "SF Giants" and if you are feeling a little risque...add the pesto (free.99). Next time, I might just go extra on the dirty sauce too. The bf got half a "Menage a trois" and half a "Matt Cain". He liked the Menage a trois better, probably because he loves bbq sauce, but I concur that it was better. I can't see you going wrong with any of the sandwiches, just pick your favorite kind of sandwich, have it with Ike's sauce, and it'll become your new favorite favorite sandwich (not a typo, i did say favorite twice). Oh minor one-star deduction, the half sandwich is on the smaller side and is ?$6. A little steep for half a regular sandwich, but I guess this isn't just a regular sandwich. I'd still come back and try other sandwiches. Thanks for bringing your sandwiches to the S.Bay Ike!

I feel terrible giving only 2 stars. Let me be clear, 5 stars on the food. Even though this location is a good as the others, I don't think the half sandwich for 1 dollar less is fair at all. Even if you do get a bag of chips or piece of fruit with it, I think I can safely assume most people would rather just pay the extra dollar and get a full sandwich. At the very least give people a choice whether they want the combo with a half sandwich or the full sandwich. For those who have been to the other locations this is very sad. Again, the sandwiches are fantastic but where did this half sandwich idea come from? Please let us get full sandwiches for the same price as SF and RWC! I realize this location just opened up yesterday or something, but I hope this menu is not permanent. Anyway, this might be useful info...I came around 11:15 and there was no line.

When I first heard about Ike's Place coming to Stanford, I knew nothing about it. I just thought it was a run of the mill sandwich shop. I decided to finally give it a try. After trying Ike's I can say that Ike's has ruined sandwiches for me. Every time I eat a sandwich now, I will compare it to Ike's. I used to like Quizno's, Subway's and Togo's but now Ike's is 1-2-3 then the rest. First off, seeing their menu was a bit overwhelming. For my first time I decided to try my own creation which was: Turkey Grilled mushrooms Red pesto Mayo Dirty sauce Lettuce Pepper Jack French bread I took a bite of the sandwich and I was blown away. I couldn't believe it was that good. The dirty sauce and fresh made bread makes a huge difference. It was the best sandwich I ever had. I also love the fact that you get a bag of dirty chips with your sandwich. The sandwich was so good that the bag of chips was ruining my sandwich (and I love dirty chips) experience. I've gone 3 times, had my custom sandwich twice and the Super Mario (I usually don't like meatball subs but something about it made me try it. It was great. Not too much sauce and it was delicious), and I plan to try every meat sandwich there. The line begins about 11am , which is crazy considering that the place opens at 10am. If you want to avoid the long lines you have 3 options: 1. If you have an iPhone or iPad, download the Ike's app (not Ike's Lair...unless you plan on picking up your sandwich in Redwood City) an you can order right from your iPhone or iPad! Pick the Stanford location and cruise through the menu. After you've made your choices, you'll see your sandwich pick up time. ******Cons: There are some sandwiches that are NOT on the Ike's app (ex. Jaymee Sirewich) which is a bummer. Most of the time you should be pickung up your sandwich at 1pm-ish. Maybe try submitting the order at like 10a and see if you get lucky with a lunch pick up time of 12p. 2. Call (650 322-1766) your order in right at 10a. You'll still get a pick up time around 1p or 1:30p (they save the noon slots for the big sandwich orders, like 10+, for this time slot) but at least you're picking up and going. Make sure you have the following information: Name Sandwich (Whole or Half) (Bread, What kind of toppings etc) Once you order is in, arrive during your pick up time and go right to the front to pick up your sandwich. Nothing feels better than strolling right to the front to get your sandwich. NOTHING. ******Cons: This guarantees you a late lunch (1p-1:30p), so snack accordingly or structure your eating for that day so you won't be starved by noon. 3. Get to Ikes by 11a to order a sandwich. I've been experimenting with line times and I find that the 11a-11:15a window is good time to go order a sandwich. they'll be either be no one in line or 3 people. Either way you'll get your order in and sandwich for an early lunch. ******Cons: Early lunch, unless you plan on eating it later...but everyone knows you don't eat a hot sandwich later. Space your meals to prepare for early lunch. If you want to go to Ike's and can't get there during the week, definitely go on the weekend. Parking is free at Stanford on the weekend which is a huge plus. Enjoy the scenery at Sanford while your having your sandwich Mon-Fri 10am to 6pm Sat-Sun 11am to 3pm Sandwiches that are awesome (and that I've eaten multiple times): John Elway - throw in some mushrooms and the red pesto Jaymee Sirewich Menage a trois Pizzle Paul reubens Say Hey Spiffy Tiffy SF Giants Jim Rome Elvis Keith Super Mario (removed from the menu but dammit still awesome, get it at another Ike's) Menu: http://ilikeikesplace.co…

Two words: Not Impressed! I can't say that I have ever enjoyed a dining experience with Ike's. ?No matter if we queue to place an order or call ahead, the orders have never been ready and take ages to complete. ?They have gotten my 'no onions' request wrong on several occasions and the service is just awful. I've been ignored AT the register, while waiting for the server to finish mucking about with his coworkers or have to wait for them to finish chatting up the girl ahead of me. As for the sarnies, talk about sodium overload. I can't remember a time I've had a sandwich here and not had a massive headache afterward. ?The dutch crunch rolls are nice, but it's just bread and not worth all the hype. ?My favourite line is "we're a gourmet sandwich shop, not Subway", to explain the exorbitant cost for what in the end is simply a meidocre sandwich that uses all the same ingredients that Subway uses (for a lot more)!

Read all the reviews about how long the wait is and how unworthwhile the sandwiches are. Please take them to heart. And stay away from Ike's. Don't come here. Like everyone says, the sandwiches are *SO* much better at every other location than this one. So don't even bother waiting in line. Don't waste your time paying for parking. Just don't bother. Stay away from my Ike's. To be honest, I'm not sure what everyone is up in arms about. The sandwiches are delicious here. The Spiffy Tiffy and the SF Giants are both very solid sandwiches. The Dutch Crunch bread is actually to die for. And the dirty sauce that accompanies both sandwiches is really freaking amazing. Yes, the sandwiches are more expensive. It's Stanford, I bet the rent is pretty high. But really, I've spent about the same or more money on mediocre stuff from Lutticken's, and had too much sandwich that just wasn't worth finishing. The half-sandwich here is just the right size with a bag of chips, and I don't feel like a Fatty McFatterson afterward. It's a delicious sandwich that you don't get sick of. I've seen Ike here the last couple of times I went, so it looks like since the SF location closed down, he's been taking care of business here. I'll admit, the waits are really inconsistent, and either really quick given the number of people in line, or really, unbearably long. Don't come here for a quick lunch; that's about the silliest thing you can do. If you show up not on a schedule and know how to be patient, then it's totally worth it. But really, don't come here. The fewer people in line ahead of me, the better.

Ike's at Stanford? No way. This is much better than driving all the way up to the city for a sandwich, not that I would do such a thing. This Stanford location is just Ike's lite. It does have a trimmed down menu, but you still can order online/phone and have the awesome sandwiches. The one thing that's awesome about this location in comparison to the SF one is that the wait is incredibly shorter. Since it's on campus, you don't have a huge crowd, which shortens your wait to 5-10 minutes. My personal favorites are the menage a trois and the we're just friends. The halal chicken is not too dry, but the key to my heart is the sauce they use here. It's straight up a one way ticket to clutch city. You don't get free chips with your sandwich, but they still give you the caramel apple pop. As far as drinks go, they do have that real deal sugar cane soda. None of that corn syrup crap here. You get the legit Pepsi and other sodas. Epic sandwiches, awesome location, no crowd. What more can you ask for?

Yes, its in the middle of no where (unless you are a Stanford student), but at least its open on the weekends and less crowded (on weekends) than any of the Ike locations can be during the week. Being less crowded, its given me the opportunity to enter into a dialog to explore their various sandwich choices and staff recommendations. Move over "Ex-boyfriend," it now all about "The Girl I'm Dating" and "Menage a Trois." This location also gives a free bag of chips or fresh fruit with every sandwich (unlike the Redwood Shores location which charges extra).

This one isn't comparable to the one in SF. The quality of the sandwiches is definitely different. Not as big! Before you take a trip tip: It's actually on Stanford campus, due to recent construction you probably have to park in the visitor parking structures and walk about 6 blks to get there. It's kind of hard to find, given all the building are similar. There are outside patio umbrellas, to let you know you are close. Opens on weekend, hard to find parking, and pretty expenses for sandwiches, all in all good sunday afternoon.

BEST FOOD AND BEST SERVICE ON CAMPUS! On their (reallly busy) opening day, I special ordered the Kryptonite - their most ridiculous sandwich - and they were happy to oblige even though it wasn't on their campus menu at this point. It was HUUUGGE! I split the sandwich (which was a "half-sandwich") with my buddy and we both were stuffed by delicious amazing sandwich at the end! I also go to meet Ike, which is sick!! The next day I got the Ménage à trois, which was probably the tasiest sandwich of my life. Amazing stuff! To quote a youtube video "It was messier than I expected - not the first time someone said this about a Ménage à trois". The third day (see the trend? Yes, I found my new lunch place) I split the Doomsday sandwich (again, a special order that Erin had no problem making) with a friend, and again it was amazing. Just the right amount of Habanero to make you go YUMMMMMMMMM. On-campus lunch has never left me feeling this healthy and invigorated. The only other thing on campus that is comparable is the Pesto Crepe at Coupa's. Their staff is amazing - such a breath of fresh air compared to the usual service on campus. Every time I go I end up in a conversation with the people working there, who are all very helpful - makes me feel like the food I'm getting is really made with care. To all the haters: this is their temporary menu! Talk to the staff before you give a shitty review! Also, there is no parking close by, this is for the engineering students, not the VC crowd from Sand Hill or something. Back off on the negative reviews already. Ike is right there, why don't you go up and talk to him, make some suggestions on how you think the place can be improved. They're really open to figure out what works best on campus, so just suggest things. They're strongly considering serving coffee as well, since many people have apparently requested that. (Another coffee shop on campus? well, I guess it works for the people in the building). Anyway, go here and spend your hard earned dollars to get something worthwhile!!

It's nice to not have to go all the way up to SF ... except the line can be totally insane when the students are around during peak hours. ?If you work on campus, it's a great location, but it's otherwise a little tougher to get to than the Redwood shores location. ? Bread - go for Dutch Crunch. ?I'm not a mayo fan; therefore, I'm not a big Ike's sauce fan, either. ?I love chicken, so Menage a Tois (bbq sauce, honey, many cheeses) and [Name of the girl I'm dating] with avocado and bbq sauce and pepperjack are my favorites. ?For a healthier, more decadent one, go for the vegetarian meatball sub. ?The eggplant is the other vegetarian you shouldn't miss. ?Everyone else in the group went for the Lincecum, though. You can order ahead to avoid the madness there! ?It's kind of like the sandwich nazi...

I came to Ike's at Stanford on opening day and got the #9 [Name of the girl you're dating], with chicken, honey mustard, pepper jack, and avocado. ?It was delicious, and worth the 1h 21m wait for my sandwich. ?I think that kind of wait was only due to opening day. ? I've been reading what other reviewers have been saying about the half sandwich pricing, as compared to a full sandwich at the other Ike's locations. ?Personally, I think the price per amount of food, and certainly price per calorie are reasonable and comparable with the rest of Stanford and Palo Alto area. ?Seriously, if you're looking for a bargain, WTF are you doing at Stanford? ?It's the rip-off capital of the world! ?The grad students that are truly poor pack their lunches anyway, or they should. I also have to mention that Stanford Ike's is located in the beautiful new engineering quad at Stanford. ?While new, they adhere to Frederick Olmsted's original master plan for Stanford campus! ?It's nice to hang out in new engineering buildings or in the big new courtyard outside while consuming a sandwich.

Sandwiches were good, but the other reviews don't lie, you will probably be waiting a LONG time for your sandwich. We waited about 30 min to order and then another 20 to actually get our sandwiches...and the lines weren't even THAT long. None of the employees seemed to be concerned with moving quickly. I had the Vegan Sally Ride on sourdough (caution, the wheat bread contains honey, the cashier was nice enough to let me know). It was pretty tasty, but they were really cheap with the Tofurkey and they left off my soy cheese. It also had way too much shredded iceburg lettuce that ended up falling off everywhere and making a giant mess. The bread was excellent though. I feel like I should have gone with the vegan meatball sub or one of the ones with breaded 'chicken.' ?I ordered the small size, and it was really filling. My husband the omnivore had the Luigi, with the meatballs and the jalapeno poppers. He thought it was pretty tasty. It was messy to eat, but I think all meatball subs are that way. It's kind of expensive to eat here, so I wouldn't do it all that often, but I'd like to go back and try some different orders. I thought it was nice that you have a choice between fruit and chips as a side for your sandwich (I like having the healthier option).

Don't believe the hype.

So good, but it's pricey & very likely you'll have to wait in line for a long time around lunch. ?Their secret sauce is key to the deliciousness of their sandwiches - I have no clue what's in it, but it is good! The Spiffy Tiffy on Dutch crunch is my go-to sandwich here. SO delicious - the main ingredients are chicken and pesto. Call in & order (way) ahead of time to avoid the long wait times. ?Phone callers be warned, though: one time I called to order around 12pm, and they said the earliest I could pick up my sandwich would be 2pm. Two whole hours later!

Come on, Ike's! ?With the new call-in and email system, things are still not working as expected. "*Long lines so just call ?(650.322.1766) or email (nachoboy_5@yahoo.com) your order ahead of time!" If you email in... ---You have to order 24 hours in advance for large orders ---Call when they open (10AM) to confirm they got the order ---Bring a copy of your order to help speed up the payment ---When you arrive at the pickup time, expect 10-15 minute delays ---Expect to feel like an asshole for skipping the long line Also notable is that they accidentally gave me an extra sandwich (which is ok, extra is better than incomplete) and messed up a couple options on a few sandwiches (where's my dutch crunch??). Redwood Shores is crazy efficient - less space and fewer people. ?At the RS location, I was in and out super fast (5 minutes tops). ?My order was always ready at pickup time, payment was quick and organized, and rarely did they make a mistake on an order. ?Since it was so quick, you don't feel like an asshole for skipping the line. I'll keep coming to support the Ike's franchise on a weekly basis, but I hope some big improvements are made on service, efficiency and organization. I won't be upping my star rating until it does.

I came here on a Saturday and I was expecting a long line but that wasn't the case. I was the 5th person in line and got my sandwiches 10 minutes later. It felt like a hidden gem that only Stanford students know about. Just wondering how many people will go out of their way and enter a campus just for food. I ordered the Manage Trios and the wife ordered the Paul Rueben. We both had it on their famous dutch crunch, Manage Trios had really good flavors from the honey and bbq sauce but I was expecting the chicken to be whole breast instead of chopped. The Paul Rueben was also delicious. The pastrami was little dry and I am use to thin slices. The slaw is probably what makes this sandwich. The sandwiches are on the expensive side at 10 dollars but definitely worth it for something different.

It was 2:30 PM and i was starvinggg. energy levels were down and i could feel myself shutting down. that and the 20 minute wait pushed me over the limit. So I went ahead and ordered the Full-Size "Insert Name of The Girl You're Dating", a chicken, honey mustard, avocado, cheese concoction. IT WAS FREAKING DELICIOUS. and filling. Maybe it was the bag of chips and drink (Free w/ college ID - ANY COLLEGE. I pulled out my CAL ID and the nice guy behind the counter let me use it!! booya stanfurd!) I had, but I could only stomach half of the sandwich. you have to get the dutch crunch and based on everybody's reviews, i don't think you can go wrong with any of the sandwiches. i'm so tempted to apply to grad school here just so i can get my fill of ike's on a regular basis!! while wearing my cal shirts of course =p!

Still crazy waits unless you get your sandwich at like 10 am. ?I try to call in my order and they never pick up, even after calling every 5 minutes for half an hour. ?Their voicemail doesn't even say "Ike's", it's just a generic message, so I'm not even sure if the phone number listed online is the right number!! They're always running out of ingredients, even first thing in the morning. The sandwiches barely have any cheese. Also now: sandwiches do NOT come with chips or fruit for free. ?75 cents for fruit, $1 for chips or something, even though the menu hasn't been updated to reflect this.

Just wanted to update my review.. Decided to give this place another try. The last time I was here it took 2 hours to get my food = order time + food making time. At first I though there was some miracle because the line was so short. Turns out they just took our names down to tell us when we can order. Uhh, thanks?? Seriously, what is with the wait time?! Had to wait 30 minutes just to order. Then had to wait almost an hour for my food. We took a look into their kitchen. It seems like this place dedicates all their time for 1 sandwich at a time. Yes, they have 1 meat griller, 1 sauce guy, 1 bread, and 1 whatever BUT they all spend their efforts on 1 sandwich. No wonder this place is slow. Do they want to make each sandwich perfect or something? That's nice, but I would rather have my food toot sweet in a jiffy. Also, dude with the microphone? COME OUT into the dining area because we can't hear you. Stop standing behind the register and chatting with your friend. You should be fired for doing that. So why is my review still 4 stars? Because the food is unbelievably good. If I would separately rate the service I would rate it NEGATIVE 5 stars. OMG.

The best of the BEST! Stick with the Vegan Tom Brady on sourdough, it's da Bomb! The bread's toasted and the sandwich is so stuffed. The only drawback of Ike's is the wait.

There's an app on the iPhone. You can view the menu, place your order, and freaking pay all w/ a few clicks on your phone! This beats waiting because thereat can be longer than having your pizzas delivered but trust me, it is oh so very worth it. I can't get enough of Ike's. I ordered the Pizzle again. I can eat a million of those. The chicken, bacon, ranch, along w/ the infamous Dirty Sauce and the lettuce, pickles, and peppers is a combination that equates to a heavenly bite. I asked for no tomatoes though. Oh and the Dutch Crunch is toasted to perfection. They have whole wheat, French bread, sourdough, Dutch Crunch, and gluten free bread... I used to always order sourdough until I discovered Dutch Crunch. Super friendly and upbeat staff. Probably the best bunch around! Parking is much easier to find than on the weekdays.

Delicious sandwiches, choice overload, but in a good way. Jim Rome is the best. ?The caramel apple pops are a nice extra. ?Yeah, there's a long line, but it's totally worth the wait.

Get: "Menage-A-Trois" (aka "The Last Kiss") on Dutch Crunch Hands down the best sandwich I've ever had. Granted, I gain 5 pounds just from looking at it, but it's so worth it. Been twice and gotten the "Menage-A-Trois" (aka "The Last Kiss") as per 7x7's recommendation and wil probably never try any other sandwich. I still don't know what's in it...but I don't care. It's that good. Went on a weekend, I think on a holiday, and it was pretty empty although I imagine that it's packed with a bunch of coders around lunchtime on weekdays (it's in the new engineering building on Stanford campus). Not the cheapest sandwich but it's worth it to try at least. I wouldn't go every day for the monetary and health reasons (their bread has dirty sauce - probably just garlick-y mayo - baked into it) but if I didn't care about that stuff, then I'd be there breakfast, lunch, and dinner! The fact that there's an Ike's on campus is one of the main reasons why I'd consider going back to grad school...

To being with, I would have to say the sandwich is very good and deserves to be 5 star. The main gripe I have is the unreasonable wait time during off-hour. I started waiting in line at 1:44pm, which was long past lunch rush hour. I got my order in around 1:55pm and I did not get my sandwich till 2:20pm. I consider this unreasonable for a student on-the-go. There are several things that contribute to the long wait time: i). Only one register accepts the credit card. Maybe bling payment is on the way?; ii) I found it odd to put orders on a post-it while having hundreds of sandwiches/breads/dressing to choose form. Will it be more efficient to have a pre-printed list of options and just check things off? iii) the seating area is quite big and it's hard to find who orders what unless by yelling. I would not want to go back (between 11am and 2pm) till things improve. Again, this has nothing to do with the sandwich but more to do with this particular locations and how things are managed here.

I've had Ike's prior to visiting this location, and let's just say, i've had better. Perhaps it was an off day, but overall, it wasn't up to par. Based on the other reviews here, I think it may just have been a fluke, but here's what went down. I arrived with a friend to have a late lunch. There were some wandering bodies near the register, and it wasn't clear if there was a line. When we approached after waiting as the wanderers were chattering about, we were rudely addressed by the staff that 'there's a line.. OVER THERE!' OK! no prob. when we finally paid, we ordered a half menage with everything and a full rum rum with lettuce only. We waited for a few, and my name was called. The young gentleman that brought the food was very polite and was bringing the sandwiches to people's tables (totally unnecessary in this cafeteria-style place, but a nice touch). I was so hungry that I ripped open the sandwiches to find that the menage was missing tomatoes, and the rum rum had everything on it. Screwed up the order. Also the menage had way too much sauce (soggy sandwich), and the rum rum had too little sauce. I was disappointed. Hopefully they read this review, and really be careful when they're making these sandwiches. The sandwich is the ONLY reason people come here; it's there proverbial bread and butter. If they start screwing that up because the staff isn't paying attention or they're just hiring anybody, then the REALLY GREAT sandwich place becomes just another mediocre sandwich joint. Please improve!!

Look Ma, I finally made it to Standford!!!!!!!! ? Ok Ok. ?I ?only made it here to eat at Ike's Place. This little sandwich shop is located within the campus famous and esteemed Stanford University. ?This is the second location of the popular Ike's place located in San Francisco, California that is causing quite a a stir within food articles and Yelp. ?As of this review, the original location have over ?4k reviews with an amazing 4.5 stars average after opening in just 2007. ?The sandwich is so good that in order to get the sandwich here to the students and faculty in Standford, Standford gave Ike's a little spot within one of their dining buildings free of rent, with only a minimum percentage of the sales going to the college as payment. ?How do I know this? ?I befriended one of the owners of the third and fourth Ike's opening up while I was working in California and he told me. Despite this place being within a University, the dining area is open to the general public. ? Since I couldn't find the time to travel to the original location, I made do with getting my hands and stomach at these sandwiches at this spot since it was a lot closer to where I was situated. First thing I discovered about Ike's here. ?The campus is a freaking maze. ?The drive goes through multiple winding roads which was not help by multiple blocked areas because of construction. ?Once parked at a nearby parking lot, you still have to figure out how to get to and locate the building where this sandwich shop lies. ?You can't tell from the building outside since there is no signage declaring that there is food much less Ike's Place is within. ?Don't be too shy to ask for directions. ?We did.. like 3 times. This place is perfect for Stanford. ?It takes a genius to find it. This location makes up for the difficulty in finding the place by not having the long 1-2 hours line that the San Francisco shop is known for. ?Walking inside, you'll see a disappointingly small looking stand declaring it's Ike's place. ?Despite it's size, it takes no longer than a few minutes before it's your turn to order. ?That's one reason to eat here instead if you are just interested in trying these sandwiches. I heard there was over 180 combinations of sandwiches including a few secret ones only insiders know about. ?I could believe it because besides the more popular selections up on the board behind the cash wrap, there is also a whole binder available that is full of selections to choose from if you are so inclined to read it. ?Me, I just wanted to eat and I went after what the cashier (and verified by the owner of the other Ike's) told me was one of their most popular sandwiches, the Menage A Trois ?consisting of halal chicken, real honey, honey mustard, bbq, pepper jack, swiss, and cheddar cheese. ?You could choose a selection of bread ( I believe it was white, wheat, and sourdough) ?all grilled with their signature Dirty Sauce onto the bread. ?I highly suggest you let them slather another helping of the Dirty Sauce all over the interior of the sandwich also. Dripping with it, the sandwich was moist, fragrant, with a chewy bread, and unbelievably delicious. ?I bought the large size instead of the small and it still disappeared like nothing. I couldn't help devouring it. ?One of the better sandwiches I ate anywhere and I highly agree with it's enthusiastic reviews. If I loved it so much, why did I give it a 4 instead of a 5? I had to deduct a point for having lack of sides. ?They had only bagged potato chips here where the cashier told me that they fry up some amazing stuff at the original location. ?Saving that last star for whenever I get to the original Ike's then. **************************************************?************* The Ménage A Trois: http://www.yelp.com/biz_…

I was so excited when Ike's opened at Stanford. It's a short walk from my office, and I love the new SEQ that surrounds it. My first few times there, I could look past the ridiculously long line and then the rather lengthy wait time for an innovative and fun sandwich. But something just wasn't clicking for me, and it wasn't the odd (cheap?) choice of chicken cuts (not a whole breast, not shredded, not sliced, but more like diced). And then I realized that the special sauce was overpowering the rest of the flavors -- regardless of which sandwich I got it all kind of tasted the same. Now when I venture over, I'll get my sandwich without the sauce, mayo, onions, and sometimes even banana peppers just so I can enjoy the uniqueness of each sandwich. Easy enough to remedy, and that's definitely personal preference (I know people who'd kill for their own bottle of that sauce). So why three stars and not four? The price. When they first opened, each sandwich came with a bag of chips or a piece of fruit. When they uncoupled that, it felt like they increased prices even though they dropped the prices on the sandwiches to compensate (I guess I'm a sucker for package deals). I also don't think an Ike's sandwich is enough for lunch by itself (for me at least) -- I might be imagining things, but the six incher from Subway (which is even closer to my office) seems much more substantial than a half sandwich from Ike's.

Yes there's a line. Yes it's a greasy sandwich. Yes you pay $7+ for a half sandwich. Just accept and love. Got the much touted menage a trois, +jalapenos -onions. Perfection on dutch crunch. In fact after waiting half an hour (line+ordering+waiting) and despite ordering it to go, my friends and I had to stop mid-campus to at least try a bite. It smelled too good. And my god it was wonderful-- the mix of tastes, textures and sloppiness. My friend said "I'm going to eat this in my office... and shut the door." Pleasure needs privacy sometimes. Adding to the love: Ike personally delivered our sandwiches, and even complimented me on my order-- suggesting I add sriracha sauce next time for an extra kick. Friendly service! The half size is ideal and the green apple caramel lollipop is a perfect lunch-cap. Ike's, I'll be back. And adding sriracha, worry not.

My friend and colleague, Max, took me to lunch here not too long ago. when he suggested the place... I said "Ike's? ?What's that?". He nearly choked on his morning pastry. ?"You like sandwiches?" was his reply (after he stopped turning blue) "Love 'em." ?Okay. ?He done brought it. We walked over to Ike's on a sunny Thursday afternoon, later, to avoid the purported crowds of ravenous sammich hunters and we still encountered a line. ?At 1:45pm. ?No matter, we were committed. ?The guy taking our order was hilarious and charming and good looking and funny. ?Always a plus. ?I'm a vegetarian, so I was a tiny bit apprehensive of getting scoffed at or not having many options, but the menu offers a lot of good veggie options. ?I got the fake meatball sammich. ?Excellent choice. The sauce was great, the texture of the TVP meatballs was reminiscent of real meat. ?The hot sauce I had them dump on there made my mouth sweat and gave rise to vaguely naughty thoughts. ?(sorry, hot spicy food always gets my blood up). :) We got some chips, comes with every sammich, and some bottle of root beer. ?We sat out in the sun, ate our carb-y deliciousness and had a nice chat. ?I want to come back once the rains are over so I can get some more of that vegelicious sammich nonsense.

I got the Spiffy Tiffy. Partly because it reminds me of my middle school years (an old nickname), partly because the ingredients sounded ahmayzing, and partly because it was the first sandwich on the menu. That's usually on purpose, right? Anyways, I was skeptical after hearing so much about how great Ike's is because, really, it's just a sandwich folks. And I'm not huge sandwich person. But ohhhh man were my tastebuds gettin down to this sandwich. They didn't skimp at all on the fillings (especially the avocado) and the flavors were balanced and harmonious. 5 stars for surprising my tastebuds in a positive way.

I've been working in corporate jobs since graduating college, and as many of my colleagues and fellow 9-to-5ers can attest, it's tough finding a good sandwich! I've been to a fair share of delis in the Bay Area, constantly on the search for a sandwich that was more than just a barrier to my stomach eating itself during the day. I believe my search for the best sandwich ended just a few weeks ago when my girlfriend brought me to Ike's. Now being located in an Engineering building in Stanford is an obvious barrier to entry for us non-students, but if you work or go to school here (or are fortunate enough to have access to the other two locations in the Bay), it's a spot you have to try. Having been there twice, I've had the opportunity to try the Spiffy Tiffy and the Superman. The Spiffy Tiffy was very Mediterranean - pesto, mushrooms, provolone on chicken, it was light yet packed with flavor for a sandwich of its size (yes, the full size is BIG!) I viewed it as an ideal mid-summer picnic all rolled into a sandwich. Delicious! The Superman on the other hand, was an angioplasty in a bag. I talked myself into ordering it thinking, "Hey, I'm really hungry. This is a late late lunch. And it could be worse, the Super Challenge is supposedly three bouts of madness in between bread, the Superman sandwich itself can't be that bad." I painfully underestimated the Superman. When the cashier handed me the bag with my sandwich in it, I thought there was some mistake, that I got a sandwich for free. Nope, it was just the Superman cut in half - basically each half was larger than one of the normal full-sized sandwiches. The sandwich itself had to weigh at least 5 pounds as it was stuffed to the brim with deli meat, veggies, and Ike's delicious spread. Despite my initial surprise, I was able to enjoy the sandwich - the first 15 bites or so were delicious, and I was still feeling quite confident in my ability to finish both halves. Once again, my eyes were certainly bigger than my stomach. I made it a third of the way through the second half when my appetite slammed into a brick wall. I was Thanksgiving-full but worse, I didn't have much for sides to help my stomach expand like I would with Thanksgiving turkey, it was mostly dense deli meat! With my tail between my legs (and to my girlfriend's chagrin), I took the walk of shame back to our car, to-go bag in hand. Despite the ensuing meat sweats and lethargic slouching for the rest of my day, I still have nothing bad to say about Ike's. It is on the pricier-end for deli sandwiches, but I do feel the quality is worth it. The huge lunch lines go to show I'm not the only one that feels that way either. Just make sure to ask about the sandwiches before you order since it's not a sign of weakness to get half a sandwich, or at least I keep telling myself that...

I love these sandwiches! ?I had only been to the SF store, so the next time I was at Stanford for a doc's appt, I had to find this new-ish location. ?Geez, it's hard to find! ?I felt so stupid on campus, as none of the buildings is labeled (pretty much) and there is crazy construction nearly everywhere. ?Not even the restaurants have signs outside! ?It's in an Engr building of all things, and there is no sign outside or anywhere. ?I only found it because I saw a line and figured that had to be it, and it was. ?Their menu board only lists a small fraction of their offerings, and being a college campus, it's heavy on the vegan listings but they do have everything you can think of. ?I'm also surprised they offer half or full sizes. ?The full is just a normal-sized sandwich. ?I always get the turkey/cranberry on dutch crunch (going home for thanksgiving) and it's food-orgasmic. ?$10 may be pricey for some students, but it's definitely worth trying or splurging on sometimes.

The sandwich was great, but it was too difficult to find parking. The wait was long, so the cost of parking is nearly 1/3 of price of the sandwich. Unless your job enables you to take a 2+ hour lunch break, I guess after all this place is only intended to serve people at Stanford?

In a house with 7 people, when more than one person can agree that any type of restaurant is awesome, it probably is. I've been living in Palo Alto for a short time and I have heard about this place multiple times. Intrigued, I dragged a resident from SHC to try it out with me post call. The Pro's: --I'm vegetarian and they have a ton of options. --The Dana Scully and it was awesome. The eggplant and french dressing were a great combo. It's one of the best post-call meals I've had in a while. --The sandwiches are worth the price. I got a half-sandwich and was more than satisfied The Con's: --The line is super long. Be prepared to wait or hope you spot a familiar face ahead of you. --When I was there they were out of fruits and some of their veggies. I guess the delivery didn't make it --The cashier was new and definitely overcharged us. Overall, I'd ?definitely go back but double check the bill.

Sandwiches don't get much better than this! Hyped up like no other restaurant I have been to, Ike's has the goods to back it up! With a variety of meat, vegetarian and vegan sandwiches (over 60 were listed last time I went), Ike's has a something for everyone. Typical italian and american sandwiches are delicious, as are the one with more extravagant ingredients (wasabi mayo, mozzarella sticks, coleslaw, etc.). The dirty sauce they smother over all of their sandwiches in addition to heating them up makes all of the flavors blend together in beautiful sandwich harmony. Pro Tip: Avoid the line. The Stanford location takes orders on the phone and it can shorten your wait time by an hour or so during busy hours (11AM - 2PM). If you have the chance to call ahead, definitely do so.

I absolutely love Ike's. I try to eat at the SF one whenever I am in the area. I was thrilled to find this place so close to home. The best part is that they have halal options. I have tried all the halal options and actually like all. I really can't pick a favorite.

After hearing that Ike's was less than a 10 minute walk from my office on the Stanford campus, I had to check it out. I made the smart move and parked in the structure on Via Ortega so I could be that much closer. I knew it was in the newest engineering building, but I didn't know which part to find it in. It would be helpful if they put out a sandwich board (no pun intended) out front for people to find the place during off-peak times. I went around 3:30, no line at all. I don't know what i was expecting, but I surely wasn't expecting two small counters that were right in front of the kitchen. There were no signs to show me that this was the place so I walked forward to the register. Luckily the girl working there took pity on my puzzled face and offered me a menu. Whoa - that didn't help - there's way too many sandwiches to choose from! So after perusing for several minutes & giving up, I asked the girl what she recommended. She said that the menage a trois was the most popular - so I ordered it. The pricing is confusing on the menu - it didn't say that the prices were for 1/2 sandwiches. So when I asked for a full size, she rang up $12.95 instead of $6.95. I was like - are you serious? $12.95 for a sandwich?!? So I went with a half menage a trois on dutch crunch for $6.95 and a drink. Apparently sandwiches come with either a bag of chips or fruit. The drink coolers were almost empty so the selection was disappointing. Not thrilled with my "chocolate" iced tea but I was thirsty. Normally, the cheap-o in me would give a thumbs down for $9 for a sandwich meal deal.... however... When I sat down and ate my sandwich, it totally rocked my socks. No joke. The amalgamation of the halal chicken (reminded me of tender, shredded rotisserie chicken), smoked gouda, honey, honey mustard and the mind-blowing "dirty sauce" put me in sammie heaven. The dirty sauce reminds me of the garlic sauce they use at Mr. Pickles sandwich shop - which I really like as well. So I'm putting this place in my once in a while super treat file. I do want to try other sandwiches, but I don't think I can afford it all the time (money and waistline-wise). PS: Ike - could you include some chips that aren't fried in peanut oil? I'm not allergic but a lot of people are.

If you have to decide between sandwiches named after Giants pitchers, I'd go with the Matt Cain over the Tim Lincecum. The Cain just feels like a manlier, dirtier sandwich -- roast beef, turkey, salami, godfather sauce, and provolone. The Lincecum is clean and decent: turkey, bacon, ham, avocado, and havarti. I had both of these on gluten-free bread, which wasn't bad! I've been to the other locations (Redwood City, the old Castro location), and I find that the quality has been consistent. So far, I still think the Menage-a-Trois is the best, and it's not just because it's fun to make the same jokes everyone has made. It's just a delicious sandwich. The best part about the Stanford location is that dinner and weekends haven't been terribly busy. This is important especially if you're coming here just to eat at Ike's, because most parking at Stanford becomes free after 4pm. Once inside, there's plenty of seating, and the staff is very attentive in bringing out your food. My only complaint is that they named a sandwich after Ted Leland, the evil AD who almost ruined our entire football program. I came here twice in three days. 'Nuff said.

***Best Sandwich I've Ever Had*** I hate waiting - whether it be a line for the latest iPhone, a movie premier, or the latest "it" breakfast spot in SF. Yet, I found myself compelled to wait in line for 20 minutes to place an order at Ikes and proceeded to wait another 15 minutes for my order, only to be absolutely blown away. I'm not sure if it was the combination of hunger and a long wait that colored my palate or if their sandwiches are just that good. The 5 page long menu kept me occupied while I was waiting in line. Being a vegetarian, I loved their huge vegetarian menu and given that they had a number of vegan options I actually opted for the vegan [insert your favorite Sesame Street character] (Elmo in my case) which consisted of cucumber, avocado, lettuce, tomato, pesto, and soy cheese. It was lightly toasted and dellllicious. Although sandwich prices range from $5-$10 (depending on what you get and the size), they're not your regular 'ol subway sandwiches, these are *filling*. I'd recommend just starting out with a half size. There's plenty of seating in the beautiful Huang Engineering Center and super nice employees. The one "con" for me was that most of their vegetarian and vegan sandwiches had imitation meat in them. I'm not a fan of imitation meat (that stuff freaks me out!), but if you are, you'll be extremely happy with their vast array of selections. Tips: *Long lines so just call ?(650.322.1766) or email (nachoboy_5@yahoo.com) your order ahead of time! ?Just know what kind of sandwich you want, the size (whole or half), what kind of bread, and any additional toppings and what time you'd like it ready by. When you arrive you can skip the line and go right to the front and pick up your sandwich! That simple! *Link to full menu: http://ilikeikesplace.co… Bottom line, any place with a sandwich called "Vegan Tom Brady" moves to the top of my list automatically, mmm.

If I was still a student on campus (and in California...), Ike's Place would probably become one of my food place regulars... if I could get through the HUGE line and long wait for food. ?The food is pretty dang good and pretty unique with all the vegan, vegetarian, and meat options, so if you go there early - say, around 11 - then the whole package works out. Food: I had the Chelsea Clinton and it was scrumptious and enough to keep my stomach happy. ?Napkins definitely needed. ?Also, you have the option of fruit or a bag of chips. ?I'm a big fan of places that offer healthier options at no extra charge. Service: It was decent given the sheer amount of people that started to line up right after I ordered. ?Had to wait for a solid 15 minutes at the least for my sandwich which was disappointing. ? Ambiance: Huang Engineering Center is beautiful in its own right and there are plenty of places to eat inside and outside - just don't expect to eat at a table if you're coming in at noon. Pricing: A little bit pricier than what I would pay as a student. I'd go and give it a whirl if only to say you've eaten a sandwich called Chelsea Clinton.

Way more convenient than trying to find the always-moving Ike's in the City! Followed the detailed directions of yelper Megan L. (thanks, Megan!) and found the cafeteria without a hitch. I called our order in thinking that it would be busy at ?close to noon on a Saturday morning. Walked in around 11:20 to pick up the order I called in 10 minutes prior and was instantly handed my sandwiches. No lines, no fuss, no nothing! Now that is an experience in itself as I have waited over an hour for Ike's in the city. Now...on to the sandwiches! Love Triangle-a vegetarian's dream come true! Honey mustard, bbq sauce, different kinds of cheeses...nom nom nom!! I will be back for more! Also had ?a sandwich with red pesto (can't remember the name) which was also heaven-in-my-mouth. Ike's just never fails to please me and I like the fact that I can now have Ike's without a) having to travel all the way to the city b) having to wait in an insane long line c) having to go on a wild goose chase to find out what kitchen in The Castro Ike's cooking at. : ) p.s. always order your sandwiches on Dutch Crunch-you won't regret it. Promise!

I am not one of the fortunate ones who have had Ike's in their lives prior to the one at Stanford. ?So, today I popped my Ike's Place cherry and tried their sandwiches for the first time. ?My Tony Soprano was delicious. ?I love that the sandwich was served warm. ?I am definitely a fan. I don't mind that they only serve half sandwiches with a bag of fruit or chips. ?Frankly, I don't need to go into a food coma at my desk anyways. ?But I would like the option of getting a full sized sandwich if I so wished. ?

My first time at Ike's, after hearing so much about the Dirty sauce and their SF crowd problems. ?This location doesn't have the line, so i'm glad about that. ?However, if you're not a Stanford student, you would have to park at their parking structure and pay $0.75 per half hour. The sandwich itself was good, Dirty sauce was good and savory. ?I got the Pizzle and overall it's a good sandwich, though if you're a big eater, the full sandwich size won't exactly fill you up. ?I'd definitely recommend to try this place once, though not sure if I'm willing to make the drive just to get another fix.

OH....MY....GOD! This seriously has to be the best sandwich place in the bay area. These things are HUUUUUUGE! They do not skimp on any of the ingredients on any of the sandwiches. I heard about the wait one has to go through if you go during their busy hours, so I went right when they opened. Only waited about 10-15 min for my sandwich, which is reasonable, considering I split the monstruous Doomsday sandwich with my buddy. Wanted to go big the first time I went there. HOLY S#@*! This sandwich was MASSIVE but so good. It had like every meat available PLUS they added jalapeno poppers. One of their Superman sandwiches is good for two people (minimum). Trust me. Definitely coming here more often. If waiting is not your thing then don't come here because this place gets seriously packed. The staff does their best, but the shear volume of people that comes to Ike's is mind-boggling. But seriously, it's worth the wait.

If I were to compare this to Little Luca's you're definitely getting slightly better quality over quantity. Folks, I kid you NOT I could have had a second sandwich considering how tiny these things are. I don't really give two shits that they're named after Giants players. All I care about is do they make a good sammich....and you know what...they do...albeit on the small (and pricey) side. I went with their Say Hey and that dirty sauce (much like The Dude's carpet in The Big Lebowski) really tied the sandwich together. The interplay of pastrami, lightly toasted bread, and that damn dirty sauce compliment each other quite well. I just wish I could've been bigger. Anyways, I'm guessing Stanford engineering students must be going ape shit over this place.

Ike's near my work? How lucky am I? I've never been to the SF or RC locations but I've heard good things from everyone who has. Thanks to Randell's C.'s review of the RC Ike's. I wouldn't have known about this location if it weren't for him! After reading the reviews, I decided to go there a little before 11am to order my sandwich. Good idea! No wait in line and it took about 10 minutes to get my sandwich. My lunch-mate and I split the full-size Super Luigi: a sandwich stuffed with meatballs and deep-fried jalapenos! Oh my! Too bad I didn't take a picture of it. =( Now if I could eat this everyday I would. I tend to favor foods that tip you close to the heart-attack scale. This is a new location so it will be a while until they work out all the kinks and get into the groove of things. ETA: Now that my husband knows Ike's is here, he's asked me to bring a sandwich home for him everyday. Oh boy!

I am worried about writing this review for fear of ruining my chances of getting an Ike's sandwich without a wait, BUT the truth must be told!! Today, Sunday, I went to Stanford, parked FOR FREE (haha, Sunday FTW), found Ikes in about one minute by walking INTO the quad area and then towards the area with all of the tables, noticed there was NO LINE (at around 1:00, no less), ordered a WHOLE sandwich from one of the friendly dudes behind the counter, and was eating in about 10 minutes. Perfect. Delicious. Easy. Maybe its because I went on a Sunday, and my expectation (as it always is) of having to go onto Stanford campus would be that I would have to wade my way through a sea of douchy bicyclists and get lost before having to pay for looking at a tree for too long, but this trip was overwhelmingly easy (and waay more convenient than the much more awkwardly located Redwood Shores location). I wouldn't doubt that these sandwiches are more expensive, but what do you expect? It is Palo Alto, after all. But whatever, haters are gonna hate, and I'm gonna get my grub on regardless.

Came in on a Monday afternoon and I was surprised that it was empty. Maybe cause it was summer. First time at Stanford and it was an interesting campus. Came here to order a couple of sandwiches before my trip down to socal and damn the cashier was pretty. Maybe I should've left a tip for her number. Ordered some manage a trois' and my kryptonite.

Today was my first time at Ike's and boy was I excited. We tried to call in our order out of fear of "the hour long line" but couldn't get through. So we just went for it & drove to Ike's at Stanford. Sometimes when you have such high expectations from all the hype the product (in this instance a sandwich) what you get isn't all it's cracked up to be. Well not today! ? I was thoroughly impressed with my Ike's experience from parking and ordering & right down to the very last bite. I ordered the Bill Walsh (great coach makes a great sandwich) on dutch crunch & added bacon - no pickles, no onions. I opted for a half sandwich cause the full size was so big (yeah that's was she said). It was just the right amount of food including some Dirty chips. Since the bread was so fresh & the portions on the inside so tasty & not overpowering - I could have easily taken a full size down in one sitting. The Dirty Sauce is something from another planet & I'm sure glad I was able to experience it. As for the wait - we got there at 11:30 and since there were only a few people a head of us - we probably waited a total of 10 minutes from ordering to receiving my sandwich. Not bad, not bad at all! There's an app for that! Something I didn't know am happy I know for future trips to Ike's (where I might not be so fortunate to encounter such a short line) they have an Ike's App. Finally no more calling & calling just to get a full voicemail. Now you can order a sandwich from your iPhone or iPad from any of the locations & customize it just like you would at the counter or over the phone. Genius Ike, genius!

This newly-opened eatery has the best sandwiches on the Stanford campus, without question. The staff are very friendly, and the price for a half sandwich (which is more than enough to eat) is surprisingly reasonable (especially compared to the on-campus competition). A thirty-minute wait to order (and just over ten minutes waiting for the sandwich) at lunch time is more than I can usually spare, though. I'm looking forward to eating here more often, once their operations are more streamlined and they have more staff (which will hopefully decrease the wait time). Still, even with the wait, the quality of the food and the friendliness of the staff earn them a well-deserved good rating from me!

My boyfriend and I were so excited to try Ike's Place once it hit campus, and I am pretty much still dreaming of that sandwich. ?Having never been to any of their other locations, though, I can't compare to other Ike's. Other reviewers are right to say that the line is long. ?Don't expect to be in and out quickly at lunch time. ?But we came at about 2 pm, and the line was not too bad at that point. ?The location can actually be difficult to find as well, especially if you don't know the campus. I ordered the "We're Just Friends" on Dutch Crunch. ?It actually came out fairly quickly once we ordered. The sandwich had the perfect amount of meat and sauce, and the pepperjack cheese went sooo well with it. ?But my favorite part was the bread. ?So tasty! ?I could probably just have ordered that and been happy. All orders come with chips or fruit, and they have a bunch of sodas you can add as well. ?The "Leninade" is actually pretty tasty.

A couple weeks ago I was trying to be a weekday vegetarian, where you are a vegetarian during weekdays and return to your carnivorous self during the weekend. Thank goodness for Ike's! I ordered a vegetarian Captain Corey. Having only tried their meat options in the past, I fully expected Captain Corey to be a lesser, albeit still pretty good, version of their meat sandwiches. Boy was I surprised! The "chicken" was chewy and crunchy. The orange glaze, dirty sauce and avocado, together with the "chicken" gave the sandwich a really hearty taste. And then there were the chips and the lollipop! For a few hours, I thought that I might be able to convert to a full-time vegetarian, but then... well that's a different review. Parking & finding this place can be a hassle on weekdays, but good news: Ike's is now open on Sundays (when parking is free and few students are in this part of campus)!

I have to say this is the worst sandwich I have had in quite a while. I ordered the very popular Menage-a-Trois as recommended by many people here. I can't understand the hype - it's simply BBQ sauce, the least expensive lettuce and tomato with very mediocre cheese. Any big franchise sandwich shop can easily beat this at only half of the price. ?The key-lime soda I had has all kinds of artificial stuff with absolutely zero natural ingredient (I'm giving this rating only for the food though). It also takes quite a while to get the food, with only a handful of customers before me. Maybe it's just bad luck for me, but I really can't see why it got so many five star ratings...and please stop hyping the "dirty sauce", it's no better than regular BBQ sauce.

I just ate the second most delicious sandwich i've ever had in my life! (right after the one at hannah's bretzels in chicago) some advice for getting your sandwich in a timely manner during lunch hours: - if you call in, do so as soon as ike's opens. I called in at 11:30 today expecting a half hour pick up time, but the guy who answered the phone told me that i wouldn't be able to get my sandwich until 2:15 PM... yikes - if you go, get there before 11:30 to beat the line. the earlier the better! I ordered the [name of the girl i'm dating] with the dutch crunch bread. this sandwich is bomb. chicken, honey mustard, avocado, pepper jack cheese... the ingredients sound standard, but the dutch crunch bread and dirty sauce take it over the top. if that's not enough for you, you can also ask for fried chicken instead of the regular kind, which is what my boyfriend did with his menage a trois, a BEAST of a sandwich that was literally dripping bbq sauce. overall, i'd say the prices are a bit high for a sandwich shop/campus eatery, but is it worth it? hell yes.

While the Spiffy Tiffy on dutch crunch was one of the THE most delicious sandwiches I have ever had in my life, the inconvenience of getting here and the high prices kind of hinder me giving this orgasmic sandwich experience a full 5 stars. First of all, this place is IMPOSSIBLE to find. ?It's located on Stanford campus, and unless you're a student and walking around the campus already, the hassle of finding parking, paying for parking, and walking all the way into campus really deters me from wanting to come back. Also, $10 for a sandwich seems a little steep even for the level of deliciousness. Overall, fantastic in terms of taste, very poor in terms of location and accessibility, and fair in terms of price. ?But definitely worth going to their other locations given that they are easier to access (and that will be my plan to satisfy future Ike's cravings).

I like Ike's. I got the Menage a Trois and was very, very satisfied. The dirty sauce is to die for. It looks like being a new place, this Ike's has some process issues with managing orders and the line flow. So expect a wait (we came during peak hours and waited in line for about 20 and waited about 15 for the order.) I'm also not cool enough to say whether this is better than the Ike's in the city, because I've only been there once, more than a year ago. So I won't make that comparison. But what I will say is that Ace of Sandwiches has major competition now!! I find the bread to be much more delicious at Ike's, and of course the dirty sauce makes every sandwich. Watch out Ace! Only problem is if you don't work on campus, it is a little bit of a chore to get to this place, because it's smack dab in the middle of campus. Not only that, but don't even try to map '475 Via Ortega' on the phone. It puts you in the middle of a bunch of portables about half a mile away from where it actually is. Just look for the engineering building. There is also a good parking structure around the corner from the place, which takes coins and is not usually full in my experience.

Sorry Coupa Cafe, but I think I found my new favorite place to get lunch on campus! I've never been to any of the other Ike's locations though, so unfortunately I can't make a comparison to them. ?Oh, and I was really happy to see that they have gluten-free bread! It's really nice to see that people with Celiac disease can try their sandwiches too. I ordered the Menage A Trois with halal chicken, honey, bbq sauce, and honey mustard on dutch crunch. ?Mmmmm, tasty. It was the messiest sandwich I've ever eaten, but it was soo good that I didn't care I was dripping everywhere. I can't wait to go back! ? I have to admit though, the wait was insane, which is why I took off a star. ?I waited a total of 50 min from when I got in line to when I got my sandwich. ?I sure hope it dies down a little as the school year goes on. ?For now, I plan on going to Ike's at odd hours, maybe before 11 AM or after 2 PM just to avoid the crowd. ?I'm really happy it's on campus though, especially since it's only a 2 min walk from my building.

I came here for lunch a couple months ago with a friend on a weekday. Boy did I underestimate the wait! It was so incredibly packed to the point that it was actually faster to call and place our order over the phone than wait in line. We both got the Menage a Trois based on another friend's recommendation. YUM! The dirty sauce is especially delicious. My only gripe about the sandwich is that the sauce makes the bread soggy, so eat quickly! I will be back to try the other sandwiches. -L.

yay for Ikes... but not this location. I had the SF giants... I don't really like the mushrooms in the sandwiches because there's so much sauce that they put with it that i dont really taste the meat. The sauce overwhelms it all and starts dripping everywhere! For some reason, though... my sandwich just didn't taste as good when I had to wait an hour for it. Not to mention, one of my sandwiches was lost because it didn't have the name on it! My friend had to ask what was taking so long... wow. The sandwich is definitely not worth the wait... I can't wait until they bring it to SJ. Also, service is just whatever. Not as friendly here as other Ike's. Parking is expensive... so bring lots of coins!!

This Stanford campus eatery makes one hell of a sandwich. I had the Fred Savage (tuna melt) with all the fixins this afternoon. It was lovely. They do half-sandwiches which is nice and all orders come with a bag of chips or a piece of fruit. Good selection of "better" sodas, too Line was astronomical tho :-(

I've said this before and I won't stop reiterating.. YOU MUST CALL AHEAD FOR YOUR SANDWICH!!!!!!!!!!!! You can make an order for pick up ANY time they're open that day! It allows you to skip the RIDICULOUS line and get your sandwich, NO WAIT!! We got.. 111. Menage a Trois (Halal Chicken, Real Honey, Honey Mustard, BBQ Sauce, Pepper Jack, Swiss, Smoked Gouda) - If you like honey mustard or sandwiches on the sweeter side, you will love this. The chicken was lightly breaded and the sandwich was so well put together that every bite seemed to have perfect proportions of everything. The sauce has a slight sweet tang ?- yum. 132. Change (Thinly Sliced RibEye Steak, Beer Battered Onion Rings, BBQ, Smoked Gouda) - A GREAT sandwich to pair with the Menage a Trois - that one was sweet, and this one is more savory with a BBQ sauce tang. Weird b/c I usually don't like BBQ sauce.. yet I loved this sandwich. The meat was wonderful, onion rings even MORE wonderful, and to top it off with my favorite cheese... can't go wrong there!

The sandwiches my girlfriend and I were good but to say it's a 5 star sandwich is a bit much. I ordered the "Say Hey" sandwich which consists of pastrami, bacon, swiss and choice of produce (lettuce, tomatoes, peppers etc). First off, for 8 bucks (a large), there wasn't much pastrami inside. It became more apparent the more I ate my sandwich b/c the produce should not be overpowering the meat (peppers etc). The bacon bits were definitely not cooked fresh and overall the experience was just average. I did go on a weekend and the lines were not too crazy. There were only 2 people in front of me. It did begin getting more packed after I ordered. I just couldn't imagine waiting a long time during the week for a sandwich. Also the people in the back work a bit slow but whatever. Try Mr.Pickles in Los Gatos if you want a bomb "home style" different sandwich.

If I could get my sandwich faster then I would give Ike's five stars. The service is what needs to improve in this place such as a faster system to get orders out . You can try calling ahead of time so you can get your hands into one of their delicious sandwiches as soon as possible. This place is super good though, I love the food so much but I know it's not healthy especially with that dirty sauce, oh but it's so goooooood! The day I have to leave Stanford is going to be a sad one since I'm sure I will ?no longer have an Ike's close by. I always go for the Name of the Girl I'm Dating or the We're just friends on Dutch Crunch.

Ok, people, for those complaining about a lack of parking, let me clarify - this ain't for people off campus. It's for the students, faculty and staff of Stanford. I know this may be cocky, or whatever, but it's a freaking campus eatery. There shouldn't be a parking lot immediately outside. Grow up and go to Redwood Shores if you want a parking lot. For those who actually aren't complaining about this - the food here is great. They do serve full size sandwiches. ?I ordered the Hot Momma Huba and it was delicious - perfect combo of spice and cheese and chicken and just yum. So good. I've heard it's a nightmare at lunch, but an early dinner at 4:30? ?No biggie at all. The staff here is friendly, if slow, but you can't rush a delicious sandwich. ?I do wish they had more signage, a larger selection of drinks and fruit, and a clearer menu, but in general? Delish.

So. Delicious. Every single sandwich. And don't even get me started on the Kryptonite! If I have friends on campus, this is the go-to place. The most important thing to remember is that it gets really busy around lunch, so you have to go at slightly off times to avoid the long lines. There are ways to get around it, namely ordering via their app. or, for Stanford students, getting that one check-into-classes-and-get-points app. and using the cut-in-front-of-everyone coupon while pissing everyone else in line off. Recently, they took off the chips/fruit from the sandwich. The reason was that they lowered the prices across the board. I couldn't really tell... The menu also shrunk noticeably. They also never have water available, so make sure you bring your own water bottle or plan on buying a drink! Otherwise, be prepared to trek all the way downstairs and across the hall to the nearest water fountain.

++ Change on dutch crunch is AMAZING! + Ike's Dirty Secret Sauce + Friendly workers - Location kind of sucks. Not a lot of parking and remember to bring a lot of change because those meters are god damn expensive. - Expect a wait. I always order by phone now..its a little faster.

I had Ike's Place for the first time yesterday and it was pretty good. The Menage a Trois was very flavorful with the sauces and I liked the three different cheese it contains. The bag of chips were very tasty as well and the caramel apple lollipop in the end is always nice. The only negatives I take away from the experience is the wait and somewhat the price. I went around 6:15pm and probably waited a combined 30-35 min. to order and get my sandwich. Although we're talking about great quality gourmet sandwiches, paying $12+ to fill me up may be a bit much. I'll still definitely will be back and trying out all the other kinds.

3.5 stars for Ike's, and rounding up to four since when we went, Ike himself was--literally--running around delivering orders. ? The lines were about 20 minutes even at 4 pm--could it live up to the hype? The chips were good (though I'd rather my order be cheaper and chipless; 7 bucks is pretty steep for a half-sandwich) and just made me hungrier for the sandwich itself! ?I chose the SF Giants; eating buddy had a bacon-pastrami-swiss. ?(Hey, we were dieting.) ?The SF Giants sandwich was really good, and the perfect amount of toasted-ness. ?The pastrami was solid as well. ?There's so much variety--something for everyone. ?Next time I'd try one of the vegetarian or vegan options. I'm minusing a star for the price (I'm sorry, Ike, but $17 for a sandwich and a half breaks the bank), and another half star because when I requested no mayo (I hate it), the guy behind the counter assured me that I'd love the (mayo-based) dirty sauce, and that if I didn't, they'd make me another sandwich. ?When the sandwich came I really didn't like the sauce, but I also didn't want to wait another half hour for a new sandwich, so I ate it, wishing the whole time it didn't have that gross mayo taste. ?Advice--if you hate mayonnaise, trust your gut on that one. ;) ?The sandwiches with avocado are creamy enough already! ? That said, though, I like a man who stands behind his food, and I appreciated the gesture. ?Really solid sandwiches--next time I feel like splurging, I'll be back!

Soooooo, Here i am writing a review on this monster of a sandwich sitting in front of me. I talking about the one and only KRYPTONITE ! I will start by saying it will be feeding 4 people ( yes its that big). There is Everything you could ever want at HAppy Hour on this thing, chillie poppers, mozzarella sticks & countless cold cuts slices. But lets not stop there, we come to the bread and the sauce.. The Dirty sauce is baked into the bread ?DIZAMN it is good. It is kind of a cross between mayo and salad dressing. I'm only giving 4 stars because my regular sandwich The King Coppa is not available at Stanford . Some deal they do not have real meatballs at that location. If you have a chance Try the Damon Bruce. Good Eats!

MEGA BIG sandwiches that are MEGA TASTY. Pick from the meat OR the veggie menu -- you really won't go wrong. The wait is quite a bit longer than your typical sandwich shop, but if you're just hanging out on campus, it's not a big deal. Bring some work with you and/or bring some friends, and snack on the chips or fruit that comes with every sandwich. Don't live on campus? There's a parking structure near the Engineering Center which has free visitors parking after 4pm on weekdays ?...So if you're like me, you only get Ike's for dinner ;-) P.S. I've tried the Kryptonite (a variety of meats, plus onion rings, stuffed jalepenos, etc.). I kept it in a tupperware and it fed me for nearly 3 days. For all three meals. ? No regrets.

Ike's is definitely one of my favorite places in the Bay Area. There should be an Ike's in So-cal! I have tried Change, Lincecum, Menage a Trois, Spiffy Tiffy, Forty-Niners. My favorites are Menage a Trois and Spiffy Tiffy. ?The Menage a Trois contains 3 types of meat and cheese. The honey mustard with bbq sauce makes it sweet for the ultimate sandwich. The Spiffy Tiffy can be a little heavy due to the halal chicken in pesto but with a kick of avocado the sandwich becomes too hard to resist or as Adam Richman would say "avocado is food's kryptonite." What makes Ike's so special is that each sandwich comes with the dirty sauce (an garlic aioli) and with each bite you can taste the ingredients of your sandwich. Also the Dutch Crunch is crunchy yet soft for a perfect couple to the party in the oral cavity. No more free chips with each sandwich purchase but supposedly the sandwich prices are $1 cheaper. If you sign up to be on the email list you receive coupons for BOGO Free sandwiches on your birthday. Now that's a deal! Stop reading about Ike's and GO!

Amazing sandwich, but pricey (half a sandwich is cheaper). Had the Change Sandwich. How can you go wrong with steak, battered ONION RINGS, bbq sauce, and jack cheese? The sandwich was big, meaty, and messy--just the way I like it. Napkins required. Each sandwich comes with a bag of chips and a caramel green apple lollipop.The staff, after seeing that we were sharing the sandwich, came back 2 mins later with another lollipop and said, "You can share the sandwich, but you can't share dessert!" That made me happy. ? My friend told me he once waited 2 hours for a sandwich. We went at around 2:30 and got our food in about 30 mins.

There is no doubt in my mind that Ike's is a Stanford institution, sort of like their Linear Accelerator building or their famous Memorial church. ?Maybe not on that grand of a scale, but it is still a place to go when on the amazing campus. ?I see why the engineers from Stanford are so successful... they get to eat Ike's for lunch. My friends and I wandered around the Stanford campus until finally getting to our destination: Ike's. ?They open at 10AM, and you can believe we were ready to eat disgustingly fatty sandwiches at 10AM on a Sunday. ?It is kind of a hidden spot, and most doors are locked on the weekends, so we had to do some scavenging to actually get in. Most of the flavors just kind of melted together, but the sandwiches are definitely stick-to-your-ribs delicious. ?Every order comes with a bag of chips, so you are not going to be at a lack of calories at Ike's. The Menage A Trois was a nice rich, BBQ style chicken sandwich with an abundance of cheese. ?It is a great sugar and fat heavy poultry sandwich. ?The Change is a bit on the rich side with gouda, onion rings, rib eye, and BBQ sauce. ?The King Koopa had some hearty meatballs, jalapeno poppers, and mozzarella sticks; it was a great greasy mess. ?There was also one with corned beef and the Godfather sauce; it was simple, but fatty and awesome. Sure, the ingredients are just greasy, fried, and messy, but in combination with the bread, they work. ?The breads are thick, crusty, and dense. ?What more do you need to support your artery-clogging sandwich interiors? Ike's is definitely a place to check out if you are in the Palo Alto area, and although the sandwiches tango on the fine line between genius and ridiculous, they definitely do the job.

Pros: - Sandwiches and chips tastes great. - Many sandwiches to choose from. - Also serves Halal meat. - Vegans can eat here :) Cons: - Location is confusing to find and hard for the public (people who don't attend Stanford University) to get to.. - 40+ minutes wait in line to ORDER - 20+ wait to get sandwiches... - The customer service was "just not there".. - I got extras in my sandwich which i was charged for but didn't get it in my sandwich.. - Prior to coming in, i have read other yelpers review about this place and saw how long the wait is so i wanted to call in and order but NO ONE answered the phone?!... and I attempted to call 3 times.. Sorry Ike's, I just don't have enough time to wait an hour plus for your sandwiches.. i understand that it gets jammed packed busy, but maybe opening more locations would really help? For now.. i won't be back or eat at Ike's until a bigger and new location opens..

I just don't see what all the hype is about. We got to skip the line because we ordered a bunch of sandwiches in advance for an event, but I was expecting a lot more from Ike's than I actually got. I was expecting a mind-blowing explosion in my mouth, but what I had for lunch was really just a sandwich. Nothing special, and definitely nothing worth a half hour wait.

The only thing that sucks about this place is where it's at, but I bet Stanford students would disagree with me. Getting there from just about anywhere stinks. You have to park in the engineering parking structure, walk through the Yang building, then finally into the Huang Engineering Center. Also, there was a dogpile of undergrads in there who were staring at my wife's pregnant belly with a look of "whoa. Who did that to you?" I suppose when I was 19, I was no different. The Menage a Trois was easily the best sandwich I've had thus far in the Bay. This is after 10 months of searching and a really bad experience with a reuben that purported to be "world famous". My ass. So, take Ike's and plunk it into a more geographically accessible location and I'd be there at least once a week. ?This is my go-to place for sandwiches, that is, when I'm near the Stanford campus which is about once a month. Oh...we went on an off-hour because this place is CRAZY BUSY. ?If you go, be warned.

Ikes is pretty damn good. I heard a lot of good things about it so I decided to check it out with my coworkers. This place is actually based within Standford University. Really nice area! There are tables outside where you can eat or grass area where you can have a mini-picnic. Usually the weather is nice in Palo Alto so sitting outside would be ideal while eating you BOMB ASS sandwich! Lunchtime is the busiest time! If you order to go, expect to get it about an hour later. Your best bet is to stand in line and order - you'll probably have to wait 20 minutes max. But its all worth it. I had the Nacho boy sandwich with dutch crunch bread. That has roastbeef, avocado, mushrooms swiss and the dirty sauce! You get free chips too. They serve fresh fruit but be sure to be there early because they run out fast. This place is really good! :)

The rumors are true - Ike's is hands-down one of the best sandwich shops around! They have a HUGE menu (100+ choices including vegan and vegetarian options), bake their bread fresh after you order (dutch crunch bread is the way to go!), and focus on special ingredients for their sandwiches. Don't go to Ike's and waste your visit on a simple sandwich (deli meat, wheat bread roll, lettuce tomatos what not...) - take advantage of their meatballs, mozzarella cheese sticks, jalapeno poppers, shredded chicken breast (LOVE this) etc! Menage a trios - chicken, honey, honey mustard, bbq sauce, and 3 types of cheese. It gets a bit sticky and messy, and the chicken tastes SWEET, but the flavor comes together very well - this is one hell of a good sandwich! The cashier suggested to NOT ADD veggies to this sandwich because the filling is soft and gooey, and lettuce would add a strange crisp to it. I took his advice and didn't miss the veggies one bit ;) Super Mario - meatballs, marina sauce, mozzarella cheesesticks. Again, I'd recommend not to add veggies to this sandwich. I liked this one a lot too, but I prefer ménage a trios. The meatballs here are yum yum, but the cheesesticks have solidified cheese inside, making it a bit strange to bite into one and have a mouthful of chewy tough cheese :-/ I'd rather the cheese be melty

Ike's has THE BEST sandwiches around. I've been traveling across the bay to Ike's in sf for awhile now, and when I first heard about Ike's opening up in Stanford I was extremely excited. I've been working at SLAC during my summers, so I often like to take an extended lunch break and head over to fulfill my cravings since the first week they opened. Every sandwich is delicious, fresh, and made exactly the way you want it. They have plenty of choices for drinks and chips on the side, and always give you a caramel apple lollipop with every order. Although the menu provided here is not as large as the sf location, so far I've been able to order all the items I could from the sf location if you know what your looking for. Big plus is the line is always pretty short, longest I've ever waited from the end of the line til I got my sandwich was half an hour, and that's considering the line almost going out the door and making every order fresh.

Super awesome place!!! I can't believe they have over 200 sandwiches to choose from! ?We were told that the list on their menu is only a fraction of the sandwiches they make! We came here on a Saturday, so luckily it wasn't crowded as I hear it is on the weekdays. ?We didn't have to wait in line, but it was about a 10 min wait for the food, which wasn't bad at all. ?I tried the Spiffy Tiffy and Al Bundy sandwiches. ?My fave was the Al Bundy, which consisted of salami with French dressing. ?OMG it was amazing! ?The Spiffy Tiffy was good as well, which had Halal chicken breast with pesto and stuff. The sandwiches even come with a free bag of chips or fruit. ?The funky fusion was the best flavor, which was like a mix of BBQ and vinegar or something like that. ? Oh, and the guy taking our order was super nice and helpful as well. ?He explained to us how their place works and recommendations for us. ? This place is probably one of the best, if not the best sandwich place i've ever been to. ?Absolutely LOVVVEEE ITTT!!! =D

SO GOOD! ? If you haven't been here yet, you have to make the trip over. ?Yes, the wait will be quite long if you are going during rush hours of lunch, but it is more than worth it. ?The prices a bit steep, but you will know why after having one of their signature sandwiches. ?It was my first experience here, but I tried the Minaj da Trio (last meat order on the menu) and it was definitely worth every penny! ?The sandwich is large and very tasty as they are generous with the meat and the sauces are all very delicious. ?I would suggest ordering the Dutch Crunch bread with any order as it adds an extra kick to the flavors as well

Menage a trois- Super delicious and oh so satisfying. You definitely will be a happy camper to eat this all to yourself. Hot Momma Huda- Good for those hot wing lovers, and was a bit messy drip drip dripping sauce all over the place! I was smart and called in my order, avoiding a long line and lessening my hunger time! I'm not very pleasant when hungry, so this was huge benefit for me and anyone around me. The sandwiches are quite pricey, and they were small(er) here compared to the one's I've had from the SF location. Get the dirty chips! The Funky Fusion flavor is the best! This location is on the Stanford campus. Park at parking lot 2 and pay at the meter/ticket machine. If you call in, you'll be in and out within 30-40 minutes. I ended up putting almost a hour in the machine, so the person who parked right after me got lucky ;)

This Ike's is in Stanford's engineering library, so unless you come with a friend who's a Stanford student (which I did), it may be hard to find. I ordered a Menage a Trois sandwich along with a sugar Pepsi (they have good drink selections). The sandwich was pretty tasty (lots of complex flavors with the multiple sauces), but unfortunately a bit too messy and sticky as they drenched the whole thing in honey. They need to improve their ordering method, as they only have one stapled menu print-out to display to everyone. A chalk-board or multiple laminated menus would be helpful. I'll be back for more though the next time I head up to the Bay Area. Their huge menu all looks tasty!

When I first heard about Ike's Place at San Francisco, i really wanted to jump on my car and drive up to the city and take a bite of that delicious sandwich that so many talked about. But San Francisco? One hour drive plus time to look for parking, plus waiting in line.... oooh...that can mean 3 hours before I can take the first bite of my sandwich. That is a bit too much...but when I found out that they actually have a store at Stanford, I really jumped in my car and went to get the sandwich....and the verdict is.... Well, Ike's sandwich is good, but I can't say that it serves GREAT sandwiches yet. I traveled a lot and have tried many different sandwiches, the best one is in Paris (sorry, there is just no comparison).... This place is small, and they don't even have the menu available. It seems like an inefficient operation. It would make things easier if they have a big board on the wall, and just have the menu posts there. People can actually figure it out what to order while waiting. But no, they prefer customers to spend time during ordering, and that makes the line even LONGER. Well, we are here to talk about FOOD. It is a cafeteria setting after all, don't expect more, just good food is good enough reason to be here. Now, go back to my point about the FOOD. I think it is good, I like the dutch crunch bread (not so healthy though). I would try to order something else next time, and see if it can wow me. For now, it is just good, not super good. ?I would try it again, and I would try the Ike's Place at SF too, just to see what the hype is all about. Happy eats!

I have been wanting to try Ike's for awhile so finally came here with my bf this past Sunday for lunch. We got there around 12:15 and did not eat our sandwich until about 1:40pm....why you ask? A very long line and then an additional wait to get the sandwich. I normally would never wait that long for lunch or sandwich but figured since we drove out and paid the bridge toll, that we had to! When we finally got our sandwiches they were quite delicious. I had the full Matt Cain with a mozzarella stick addition. The sandwich was pretty good, lots of flavor and the Godfather sauce was tasty. Also liked the dutch crunch. My bf enjoyed his Tony Soprano as well. I would definitely come to Ike's again (maybe a different location in the Bay Area) but wouldn't wait that long again for a sandwich here. Also learned you can phone in your order as well and skip the line, however it may be a hour+ before you can come pick it up.

Love this Ike's even more than the one in San Francisco, because I don't have to call in ahead of time so I can have my sandwich 3 hours later. That being said, the wait is still bad, just not THAT bad. I waited for about 20 minutes at lunchtime. As for their sandwiches, they're as good as the original. Spiffy Tiffy = Excellent. Ike's could easily become my favorite Stanford eatery.

Ike's is possibly my favorite sandwich place to date, even with that hefty price tag (and I'm cheap, so that's saying something). Fortunately the sandwiches are so dense and loaded with delicious-ness that half a sandwich is filling enough (although it's so good that I usually get a full one). I had the Menage a Trois and quite frankly, that's all I think I'm ever going to order from Ike's. It was amazing. It has three different types of sauces so it's pretty gross looking by the time you find a seat and unwrap it, but if you can get over the lack of aesthetic appeal, you are in for a treat. The combination of the three different sauces gives it a unique and good flavor that makes you just want to keep on eating without stopping to take a breath. Be warned though, if you're not in the mood for a some messy grub, order something else. My friends have tried a lot of the other sandwiches, and when I tried a bite of their's, they were good, but I felt a little sorry for them--in comparison to the Menage a Trois, they all seemed like boring old sandwiches. Albeit, they are some of the best boring old sandwiches I've had (with funky combinations, hilarious names, and lots of vegetarian/vegan friendly options), but the Menage a Trois is the sandwich taken to a whole other level. TRY IT. It's so good that I deemed it worthy of my first yelp review! ;)

Finally made it here after working in Palo Alto for a few months now. I had been wary of lunch-time crowds, so I came here around 3pm on a Thursday. There was hardly anyone else around, maybe 5 other tables were occupied on the whole floor. I was able to get my order within 15 minutes. Ordered the Matt Cain, and the sandwich was everything I dreamed it would be. I had a tough time deciding, because just about all of the sandwiches sound good, but something about all that meat in between two pieces of Dutch Crunch was calling my name. Sure, it's a bit pricey for a sandwich. But you're not going to find this quality everywhere, and some of Ike's creations are pretty imaginative. Maybe I'll try the Kryptonite one day. A cool bonus to my experience--Ike was actually there making sandwiches, and he and the other employees were really friendly. I'll definitely be making a return sometime soon.

7 bucks for a half-sandwich? ?Boo. ?A half-sandwich is not a satisfying experience like... (trying to avoid making sexual remark)... any american remake of a Japanese horror movie... (whew disaster avoided). ?I need a full sandwich to be satisfied. ?That means shelling out close to $15 for lunch. ?Also, it only came with my choice of dirty chips or fruit. ?No thank you! I must admit however that it is a tasty sandwich. ?I got one of the specials with pastrami. ?The pastrami I got was nice a salty with a lot of beefy flavor. ?It went well with the secret sauce. ?But, the highlight was the bread. ?Soft, sweet, crispy dutch-crunch. ?Very light and very tasty. ?Delicious. ?Not $15 delicious, but delicious. So, how about ambiance? ?Well, Ike's looks like a lunch counter at a school cafeteria. ?It sits in front of a beautiful sunny courtyard. ?But, silly Stanford refuses to put adequate seating in the courtyard making it the functional equivalent of Megan fox; nice to look at, but utterly useless. Finally, service... The line is huge, but moves quickly and I got my sandwich soon after I ordered it. ?The service was no frills, but fast. In summary, I would go here again if I wanted to spend $15 bucks on takeout. ?So, that is like never. ?But, if peer-pressured, I guess I would. ?I mean there was that time at summer camp...

Awesome awesome 5 star sandwiches, but too bad about the wait (minus 1 star for the hour long wait)... Since this location is on the Stanford campus, many students stop here for lunch, causing a long one hour wait to order and receive the sandwich. ?Next time I will return to Ike's place in San Francisco instead. ?You also have to pay for parking, which is not cool just to get some lunch. ?The building was also kind of hard to find since I'm not a Stanford student. I ordered a large Say Hey sandwich (pastrami, swiss, and bacon) with avocado and shared it with my boy toy. ?Their dirty sauce and the crispy dutch crunch bread makes the sandwich heavenly because the sauce melts into the warm, crispy bread. ?The avocado mixed with the dirty sauce makes the sandwich really rich and creamy. ?The sandwich also comes with either a piece of fruit or a bag of "dirty chips". I came on the Friday before Halloween, and most the workers were dressed up. ?They were quite a fun and friendly group of people. ? Aside from the long wait and crappy location, sandwiches at Ike's Place is one of my faves!

I love Ike's! I've been to the one in SF and Redwood City....however the Stanford location is the worst because of slow service!!! ?Took way too damn long to wait in line just to order.

I've been to Ike's a few times and have tried a handful of sandwiches (both at the old SF location and Stanford's). I have yet to get a sandwich I did not enjoy--even the vegan one was awesome. ?They have a huge menu with a variety of sandwich meats, breads (including a gluten free option), cheeses, and add-ons such as jalapeno poppers, fried mozzarella sticks, onion rings...you get the point. ? For me, bread can make or break a sandwich and I love their breads here! ?I need to find out where they get their breads from because the french is like no other I have had. I really like that they have vegetarian and vegan options for those who so chooses. ?I think its safe to say that most of the sandwiches will sit heavy in your stomach..they're not exactly "healthy" sandwiches. Yes, the lines are long but it is definitely worth visiting once in awhile and yes it is a bit more expensive than Togos or Subway but you get what you pay for. ?The quality, taste, and options are worth a couple extra bucks. I am quite confused about yelpers' low ratings because the lines are long. ?DUH, of course the lines are long, its a great place. ?Many great restaurants have long lines even with a reservation. Just brace yourself for the long wait before coming.

I'm glad I gave Ike's another chance. I had one of their sandwiches at a catered event (yes, it was free, so why am I complaining..), and it was definitely just dead and dying lettuce scraps along with some mayo and ketchup smeared on it halfheartedly. Apparently their vegetarian/vegan sandwiches may suck. A lot. I got the Change sandwich today fresh from the actual joint and it was pretty damn tasty, if probably $4 more than what I'd ideally pay for a sandwich. Even though I ate it two hours after its creation, still really solid in its dutch crunch shell. Thin slices of rib-eye, beer-battered onion rings (soft batter is so good!), BBQ sauce, lettuce, pickles, and big chunks of smoke gouda. The bag of chips that come with is nice, as well as the caramel apple lollipop in the bag. Call in your order beforehand and dodge the line!

The "Pizzle." ? It is the perfect sandwich. ?It is the sandwich by which all other sandwiches will be judged since the day that I ate at Ike's Place. Seriously, if you want a GREAT sandwich, then one of Ike's 100+ choices is sure to make you happy! ?You can wash it down with a glass bottle of Cheerwine soda (sort of like a Cherry Dr. Pepper) -- which I haven't even seen since I was a kid. ?Of course, there are plenty of other selections as well. ? If you are visiting Stanford and would like to get to Ike's Place, you will need to exit out of the northwest stone entrance in the courtyard of the Main Quad (to the right when facing the Memorial Church). ?Keep walking past Moore Hall on your left and the Physics building on your right. ?You will see the Huang School of Engineering Center (a new building) and Ike's is located on the main level of the building (don't go downstairs). ? The dining room is often filled (from the long lines at Ike's), but you can find any place to eat outside. ?Just bundle up for those cool Stanford days and nights (even in the summer). Enjoy!!!

I love the spiffy tiffy. It's simply the greatest. Overall, the environment is great. Yes, the line is usually very long (my record wait time is 1 hour during lunch hours in the beginning of last school year), but there's always a place to sit if you want to eat there. The sandwiches do cost a bit. As a college student, I just can't afford to eat there frequently.

On a late Wednesday afternoon, my friend and I decided to venture to Stanford for Ike's. Since we relied on technology, we got a bit lost trying to find a visitor parking area that was close to the location. We were both too stubborn and self-reliant to ask anyone else and believed that we would eventually find it. ?About 10 minutes later, we parked in the parking garage that is directly west of the Huang Engineering Center, fed the meter (75 cents/30 min & located on the street level), and walked to Ike's. I already planned on getting the Matt Cain (on Dutch Crunch), not because I'm in love with him, but because it sounded quite delicious as well. We waited about 20 minutes for our food. They were busy, so as much as we were starving, we sucked it up and gossiped for as long as we could. When they called out my name I turned my head like a meerkat in the Kalahari Desert. We got our food, took some photos to make our friends jealous, and devoured the first half of our sandwiches. My friend and I shared a bag of jalapeno potato chips and an orange cream soda as well. They also give you a caramel apple lollipop, but we decided to just gave it back. TIP: The guy at the register mentioned that if you get the Matt Cain, from now until the end of the year, a bag of chips is free and a soda/water is $1. Thanks for informing us! I like how this place offers Halal meat. It is really hard finding sandwich delis that sell Halal meat, especially within the San Jose area. Ike's was quite appetizing, but I don't know if would make the 30-40 minute drive to eat here. I would rather go to Antipasto's in East San Jose or Top Deck in Santa Clara if it was still open.

So many sandwiches, so little time. Lot's of variety in your sandwich choice, and no shortage of kooky names. I wish I could have tried more sandwiches in my time there, but I was quite pleased with the ones I did get to try. There was no lack of carnivore happiness here when I dined, my friends and I ordered several meaty sandwiches, all with different sandwich personalities--let me stress this variety again. The King Koopa was a testament to this place's creativity; meatballs, jalapeno poppers, mozerella sticks?? This sounds like something I'd make when I was a kid on a Saturday afternoon. It was really messy, but really satisfying when you bit into the correct part that had everything... which was hard to do. Go to Ike's. Then make a schedule to try everything on the menu! :D

This is one of my favorite sandwich places ever and one of the few places that I liked off the show man vs food. ?This sandwich is all kind of goodness as they have their own secret sauce and they grill the whole sandwich. ?Also there are tons of items on the menu so you definitely will find something you want to eat. The only problem I have with IKE's is the wait...they need to do something about their process so they lose a star for that. ? Also the ordering process is not that obvious and some people are kind of confused wondering what is going on

Just NOT nearly as good as the SF location, not even as good as Redwood Shores! ?Not all Ike's are created equal! I ordered the Tony Soprano on wheat. ?Actually, my friend ordered for me while I stalked people until someone pulled out of a parking space! ?She stood in line for awhile, but said it only took 15 minutes for our sandos to come out. ? Back to the Fat Tony, it was good, but NOT worth the parking and the wait. ?I'm pretty sure there was none of the promised Italian dressing on my sandwich, and they were very skimpy with the dirty sauce. ?The service was really good. ?The server walked all the way across the floor to bring us our food, with a smile on his face, and then talked to us about how he created the Sunken Diamond (which my friend had ordered) and it won an award of some kind. ?Since that was a veggie sandwich, I just wasn't that interested in what he was saying, but nice guy. ?

This place is a great place to get a really good sandwich. ?I only took off one star because, well the location is less than ideal and some of the sandwiches are a little pricey for what they are. ? Too bad they didn't put this place on the other side of campus. Perhaps the grad lounge would have been perfect since there's ample parking on that side of campus and it's closer to all the dorms. ?Just sayin'

IKE's sandwiches are the BEST around! Iv'e been to both location in SF and at Stanford University are both have CRAZY long waits! To avoid this you have to call in your order ahead of time.

I always order the same thing which is the ike's kryptonite sandwich for $20.Its about 4lbs and has everything from onion rings and cheese sticks to their yummy garlic bread!

A bit hard to find in the Huang Engineering Center (the building is not in the same quad area as the other engineering buildings), but the sandwiches are the real deal, just like Ike's Place in SF. The only real difference I saw was that the lines are shorter, they don't give you a complimentary bag of Dirty Chips (thus, the sandwich prices are appropriately lower), and there is seating! I got my usual Pizzle and it did not disappoint. The dutch crunch bread is still deliciously crackly. One other thing, you can get a half sandwich, but why would anyone only want HALF a Pizzle?! Next time I'm around Stanford, I'll be back!

I feel slightly badly stomping on Ike's, but quite honestly, I can't say that I've ever eaten somewhere else before where at the end I felt like the establishment owed me money for having endured them. Let's begin with a simple question: why do people love Ike's? Is it the overpriced food? The hipster atmosphere? The wide selection of strangely named and preposterously greasy wads injected into pathetically small rolls? Perhaps it's the long lines and equally long wait times (don't be fooled into thinking you're out of the woods just because they took your order, rookie). Maybe all of the fans are masochists, people who'd rather spend their entire lunch hour waiting to eat, standing up queued in a line that makes airport security at Heathrow look like a model in human efficiency. I just don't understand the allure. The staff are friendly, but in obviously no rush whatsoever to serve their customers. The food is hit or miss. It's grimy to the point that I fear my insides will turn transparent as I try to digest what would probably serve perfectly well fuelling a diesel locomotive. I know just enough about food to know that making it taste good is pretty easy if you're willing to make it really unhealthy, and I suspect that's precisely Ike's strategy. My advice: try it out on somebody else's dime and time. Wouldn't you rather not sacrifice a precious waking hour and your hard-earned money to their remarkable inefficiency?

Extreamly great sandwich. Location kinda sucks. It took me about 1/2 an hour of walking all around Standford's campus to find this place, there are no signs and nothing marked on any maps on campus. When I finally got there I noticed that the line was really long, I see this as a good thing, the longer the line the better the food in most cases. I finally get to the register and place an order for a Matt Cain, it took about another 10 minutes to get my sandwich but it was worth the wait, first it was huge, all warm and gooey cheesyness, piled high with two kinds of meats on fresh dutch crunch bread. It was pure awesomeness and I was pretty full the rest of the day, way too much food. My only other problem with place is they lack fountain drinks, though root beer in a bottle is great I ran out of soda halfway through my sandwich.

I love sandwiches and this place is just as good as little lucca's, which is my go to place before they opened ike's.

I have had quite a few of the sandwiches here so far, and I have greatly enjoyed each one I have tried. My favorites would have to be: Ted Leland - chicken, cheddar, BBQ sauce If I Were Cute - chicken, bacon, Ranch, cheddar, pesto, mozarella sticks Menage a Trois - chicken, honey, honey mustard, BBQ sauce, pepper jack, swiss, cheddar There is usually a (not very) long line that moves VERY SLOWLY. I've waited upwards of 45 minutes to order, in addition to the 15-20m to get my food. It is essential to place an order before you get there. This can be done over the phone, or via an iPhone app, but sometimes it's even hard to get your phone order in for a decent time. I eat here on average twice a week. I love it!

I haven't had a bad sandwich here yet... YES, there is a line, but take a seat and eat your chips & fruit and any company you may have. For the price you pay, I think a full size sandwich is worth it (especially if you have someone to share with). Some sandwiches I enjoy: 1/2. Spiffy Tiffy Halal Chicken Breast, Mushrooms, Avocado, Pesto, Provolone, Pepper Jack 9. [Name of the Girl I'm Dating] Halal Chicken, Honey Mustard, Avocado, Pepper Jack 30. Backstabber Halal Chicken, Marinated Artichoke Hearts, Caesar Dressing, Provolone #55. Lincecum Ham, Turkey, Bacon, Avocado, Havarti 89. SF Giants Turkey, Bacon, Mushrooms, Avocado, Swiss Fun story about the Lincecum & SF Giants sandwich, the people at Ike's said that the SF Giants sandwich used to be called the Lincecum, and they made a card with the ingredients and gave it to Lincecum to sign - he returned the card with some changes (added Ham, took out Mushrooms, etc) So thus, this new sandwich was called 'Lincecum' and the old 'Lincecum sandwich' was renamed SF Giants.

Wish I could have gave this Ike's 5 stars but sadly I cannot. The Ikes' on 555 twin dolphin drive is WAY better. First the roast beef on my sandwich was cut to thick, also I made sure I told them extra Ike's sauce and no pickles, I even said extra sauce twice. When I got my sandwich there wasn't enough sauce and it was loaded with pickles, I hate pickles. On the plus side the wait isn't as bad as the one on dolphin drive, and its the same friendly upbeat staff.

At first I was a little hesitant about going to Ike's because of all the hype. But I have to admit, I WAS WRONG! Yes the line to order is long and Yes the wait to get your sandwich sucks but when your sandwich finally comes out, you'll quickly realize the wait was worth it. ? As for the price, the average 1/2 sandwich ( which is about the size of a whole sandwich @ other places) costs around $6-7 and includes a bag of chips or piece for fruit. ?Not bad for an awesome lunch!

Luckily I work @ Stanford so that I can truly enjoy this on a weekly basis! I am a true Giants Fan and I'm in love with the SF Giants sandwich and haven't tried any others! My husband on the other hand is an over achiever and ordered KRYPTONITE on his first Ike's sandwich! This 6 lb. sandwich came in two long sandwiches and he was in heaven. I compared it to eating a baby -LOL.. My second son was 6 lbs! Yesterday I ordered Ike's for my boss's farewell party and it was a hit for sure! Most of the people ordered the #2 Hollywood SF Cheesesteak which I may try.. The only downside is you have to prepare yourself and not to over indulge or you'll gain some serious weight if you eat this on a regular basis. The dirty sauce, bread, and quality ingredients make every bite worth the price you pay! The line is long, so go right when they open to avoid the wait. Thanks Ike's for bringing something Phenomenal & Phunky to Stanford!!

Compared to the other Ike's locations, this one has the worst parking situation and highest degree of difficulty to get to b/c it's in the middle of the Stanford campus. ?However, it makes up for it b/c of the ample outdoor seating whether it be at the tables or any of the various sculptures, fountains, grassy hills, or amphitheaters nearby. ?This was my first Spiffy Tiffy and, like all the others, was damn good. ?Do have to say that the sandwiches are bigger at the one in SF and better put together there and in RC as well (even though RC is not an official "Ike's Place"). ?I mean that the ingredients were not evenly distributed - ex: my avocado was all on one side of the sandwich. ?But w/e, Ike's can do no wrong in my book.

If there's one thing I can't stand, it's waiting in unnecessarily long lines. Upon a first glance, this would rule out Ike's for a lunch time restaurant choice - there are usually decently long lines, and all they make are sandwiches. However, these are the best sandwiches I've ever had-- and I consider myself to be a huge sandwich aficionado. What makes them so good? They're all different. Don't go to Ike's if you're craving a plain turkey sandwich on wheat. Ike's goes the extra mile, in terms of creativity, fresh ingredients, and killer combinations that only get better over time. For a while, I tried to order a different kind of sandwich every time I visited (or I'd go with a friend and we'd each order a sandwich and split them both - great tip for trying new things here!), but now I have my list of favorites. Their sauces are unparalleled - especially the Godfather sauce found in my favorite sandwich, the Matt Cain, and the dirty sauce, a garlic aioli, that Ike puts on just about everything else. Take my word for it. Grab a $10 as soon as you possibly can and get to Ike's in the new Engineering quad. You won't regret it-- the wait makes it even more worth it.

Sometimes I think this location might be some sort of social experiment. ?They serve excellent sandwiches, and they're trying to see exactly how much time they can force people to wait for them. ? True, the sandwiches are fantastic. ?I've tried three or four of them and they're always very good. ? BUT - the amount of time they make you wait for your food is insultingly long. ?You have to be prepared to spend at least an hour waiting for your food, even after they've taken your order. ?To their credit, they improved the ordering process, so you don't need to stand in line for half an hour to order. ?They did not improve the rate at which they can make sandwiches, though. ?This means that instead of waiting in line, you can wait at a table. ?And they've already taken your money, giving you little option to bail if you have an appointment, or a flight to catch, or weren't planning on spending two hours on lunch. ? I've been to the location in SF, and while it's slow, there's at least some efficiency to it. ?You wait in line for a while, but you know that once you order they're going to start making your sandwich. ?At the Stanford location, they still have to start making the sandwiches of all the people who ordered before you, and they might not even start making your food for 45 minutes. ?They need to either build capacity in their kitchen, or have some respect for their customers and stop taking more orders than they can fill in a reasonable amount of time.

Sandwiches are serious yum! ?Love the sandwiches. ?The location has plenty of seating and despite the crazy amounts of customers during peak lunchtime, the people that work there seem to stay calm and cool and helpful. ?Like other reviews, only come when you have some time on your hands as the wait can be lengthy when the line is long. ? I've had the Nacho Boy and the Spiffy Tiffy which I thought were both delicious. ?Half a sandwich fills me but it's always tempting to get the full one cuz they are so good. ? I wish they had a better system of getting the sandwiches to you though. ?When the place is full, it gets quite loud and it's hard to hear to guy/girl yell out your name. ?Perhaps a number system with a digital display? ?Yeah, either way, I'll be back.

So the girls at work kept raving about Ike's Place and how good their sandwiches were. I kept asking, "well what's so good about it?" but they kept saying you just have to try it. So today my co-worker very nicely offered to go get us sandwiches from Ike's Place. I ordered the Hot Mama 1/2 sandwich: chicken, buffalo wing sauce, ranch, lettuce, tomatoes, and pickles. Upon my first bite the first thing that came out of my mouth was "OH MY GOD" This is one of the best sandwiches I have tasted (EVER!). I do have to say that this sandwich is super messy and must be eaten very fast so that the bread won't get soggy with all the yummy buffalo wing sauce yum! The sandwich comes with your choice of chips and a caramel apple lollipop :) I can't wait to try some of the other sandwiches (although I am the type that finds one good thing and sticks to it) but I think I could be adventures at this place :) Will definitely be coming back and bringing my family here! Highly recommend it!

Stanfurd Ike's on Sunday is a strange experience. You're standing in line with a handful of hungover frat guys in the otherwise completely deserted halls of what may be the most extravagant academic facility in the U.S., Stanfurd's new engineering bulding. Guess it should come as no surprise that no ordinary cafe would do for a facility like this - hence, Ike's. I doubt my alma mater Cal could ever swing something like this, but this is Stanfurd and Stanfurd is special. Anyway, Ike's @ Furd is just as good as the now-defunct SF mother ship. Make a Sunday pilgrimage now before word gets out and it gets mobbed. (I wouldn't dare come here during the week.) Only 4 stars because, well...Stanfurd.

I am addicted to Ike's Place! Every single item on their menu is loaded with flavor and they've created all best combinations possible. I'm a sandwich lover so I've brought a bunch of my friends out. My meat lovers and vegans have all been super happy with their food because there are so many options! I always have a hard time actually choosing one over the other, so I'll definitely be going back to try the other ones & the boys behind the counter were so sweet!

Some friends and I decided to venture across the bay to try some of Ike's hefty sandwiches. My friend's coworker had recently tried a sandwich from this place and had nothing but raving reviews so we were all pretty excited. We all took a look at the menu to get an idea of what we wanted before we left, but there are just too many options to select from! Ike's Place has a variety of meat and cheese selections and the combos they put in their sandwich are amazing! They offer you a handful of choices of bread as well as some free extra stuff you can put in your sandwich. I ended up ordering the whole size Spiffy Tiffy on the french roll and it had pesto, halal chicken, provolone, pepper jack, mushrooms, and avocado. This sandwich was HUGE and I wanted some variety so I swapped halves with my friend who ordered the Menage a Trois which had halal chicken, real honey, honey mustard, bbq, pepper jack, swiss, and cheddar. Both sandwiches were super yummy!! I liked the Menage a Trois more because you can taste the real honey and I think that really made the sandwich, even though it was all drippy and sticky to eat. The Spiffy Tiffy is really good too because it had mushrooms and avocado (my faves!) but I thought the pesto was a little over powering so I got a little tired of eating it after a while. My friend liked that one more though because it was easier to eat. The only complaints that I have are that the sandwiches are a little pricey (though definitely worth it) so I wouldn't frequently make trips to eat here, and they don't have any meal combos that includes a side and drink. However, they do offer chips and soda at a reasonable price, but beware of the peach soda that they have because a lot of people complained that it tasted like medicine... The menu varies between the two locations so I will definitely hit up the SF one next time! Their menus are so elaborate that I'm positive everyone will find a sandwich that appeals to their tastes!

Been here twice and each time it has taken over 45 minutes to get a sandwich. And the second time, I showed up when there wasn't a long line. As a "deli" style restaurant for lunch, this is not good. On top of that, during my last visit my friends were yelled at and literally man-handled for giving their order to the wrong guy behind the counter. Sorry, we didn't realize the guy wandering around with some post-its was the official order taker. Oh yeah, and when we asked for a menu we were told, "Sorry we only have a few and they're all being used." We were at the front of the line and waiting to order. WTF? From what I have eaten, the food here is AMAZING, especially for a vegetarian. Just as tasty as the SF location. But be prepared for a less-than-attentive staff and a LOOOONG wait for your food. I don't have enough time most days to take a 2 hour lunch.

2.5 stars. ?Ike's is the flavor of the quarter on campus right now, but it won't stay that way unless certain things change. WAIT: This was my second time to eat here. ?I waited in line for 15 minutes to order and then waited more than another 40 minutes to get my food. ?It was only about 10 minutes faster the first time, so this is not an anomaly. ATTITUDE: I overheard the conversation of a guy who went up to the counter and asked for a refund b/c he had waited more than 40 minutes for his sandwich and it wasn't out yet. ?Reasonable request. ?The employee said, "Try Subway. They're right down the street and they're faster." PRICE: $14 for a menage a trois, a bag of chips, and a can of Pepsi. ?This is pricey. FOOD: I ordered a menage a trois (BBQ chicken), which was pretty good but certainly not exceptional. ?Unfortunately, they were already out of dutch crunch at 12:15 PM, so I had to settle for french roll. ? Bottom line: Go there for something new to get out of your boring campus eatery routine, but don't plan anything else the rest of the day unless you eat at an off-peak hour. ?Make it a social event. ?Also, order something with bacon. ?After waiting for so long, you will deserve it.

I fail to understand how this place has such a low rating. Make no mistake: Ike's is a Bay Area staple, whether we're talking about its location at Stanford or in San Francisco. Ike's has a vast variety of different sandwiches, so the chance that you'll find something up your alley is pretty high. My personal favorites are the Change (ribeye steak, onion rings, BBQ sauce) and the Menaage a Trois (honey, honey mustard, BBQ sauce, chicken breast which I usually sub for fried chicken for free, smoked gouda). The dirty sauce here is to die for. If you're concerned with the long lines, just don't come during conventional meal times. Coming around 11am or 4pm are pretty safe times in general.

Had lunch here today (3/12) with the wife. The sandwiches were ok, but a bit too much sauce for my taste. The service staff was very friendly but the cooks/sandwich makers were VERY SLOW! It took over an hour to get 2 sandwiches from them. I think I will go again but will ask for light sauce and form to rush it. We'll see if that works.

Great sandwiches, but lines can get crazy long at lunch time. Pick up times are weird too; we called in around 12 to see if we could order by phone and walk over from the Education building, but the next pick up window wasn't until 2:30. I had the [Name of Girl I'm Dating], which is halal chicken, honey mustard, avocado, and pepper jack, on their famous Dutch Crunch bread. I opted for half a sandwich so I could indulge on some chips too, but really, the sandwich would be enough.

Called in to place an order for 2 sandwiches at 5PM and the guy informed me that they won't be ready till 6PM since it's over the phone. Like seriously??

I bring all my friends here and chow down on there delicious sandwiches pure heaven in your month experience.

bottom line: good things come in small packages i've tried quite a few of their sandwiches here and most of them have been hits that i'd definitely order again. ?some of my favorites are the spiffy tiffy and menage a trois. ?my main beef with this place is that the ordering/pick-up system seems hugely inefficient and the sandwiches are quite small for the premium price you pay. ?that being said, the taste is unparalleled and i find myself coming back for more. p.s. make sure to specifically request the free fixings if they're to your liking (pepppers, pickles, etc) as they're not included by default.

I had my first ever bite of a Spiffy Tiffy today, and my head nearly exploded--this sandwich was one hell of a beautiful marriage between mushrooms, avocado, pepper jack, provolone, halal chicken and pesto. However, in the words of the chairman, "Allez Cuisine!!!" I added a secret ingredient: bacon; the world stopped for a few minutes when I took that first bite. Texture/taste: The shredded threads of chicken contrasted wonderfully against the crisp lettuce while avocado and dirty sauce and the awesome dutch crunch roll balanced out and really tied all these disparate elements together. I'm a sucker for heat, and next time I'm adding some Dave's hot sauce or banana peppers. Ingredient ratio/Size: - The ratio of meat:veg:sauce, as well as that of toppings:bread was perfect. I hate sandwiches where I can't taste an ingredient (esp. meat) because it's overwhelmed by all the other stuff that's there. Seriously guys--a Twinkie is no good without its cream filling, and Ike's did not disappoint in this department. - I ordered a full sandwich, and for a hungry man, it's the perfect 1,200 kcal lunch. It's going to fill you up, but doesn't put you in a food coma once 2PM rolls around. Although, I might've just been perky from the Philz that I enjoyed with with my sammie. Bad testing, need to repeat. Ike's is one of the few lunch places where the world around you can melt away for a few minutes. Just imagine: a black cavern, you and the sandwich. You devour it. All that's left is you and the cave. Now, wake up! Why only 4 stars? It takes like 45 minutes to get a damn sandwich. Next time I'm timing my visit to not intersect with the lunch crowd, sheesh.

You haven't experienced a true sandwich until you experience Ike's Place!! ?Large Matt Cain with jalapeno poppers is unbeatable (mmmmm Godfather sauce). ?Shame on people for downgrading their reviews due to a long line and ingredients running out. ?To me, those are indicators of a place that serves something yummy that people are willing to wait for. ?And, if you don't want to wait, CALL IT IN! ?Overall, although a bit pricey, Ike's Place delivers. Minus one star for axing the free fruit/chips!

This is for the service...I haven't tried the sandwiches yet because I can't seem to get one. ?I just stopped by at 10:45am (because everyone says to go early or the wait is crazy) and the guy said the wait time is 30 minutes for sandwiches. ?That's my whole lunch hour so I go back to my desk to call in a sandwich (11:00am) and the guy says the earliest time for a phone pickup is 1:30pm. ?I know this location is fairly new (opened last summer) but they should have it together by now.

First experience with Ike's sandwiches was at this location. For me, I know a place is worth trying out or eating at multiple of times when I can't decide what to choose on the menu. Everything sounds delicious and I decided to try the "Name of the Girl I'm Dating," which had halal chicken breast, honey mustard, avocado, and pepper jack. I really enjoyed the freshness of the ingredients and condiments. The location is probably not as accessible or easily found, but it's worth the wait and try. I recommend going in a bit earlier than lunch time to avoid the long line. Service was very friendly, too. :D

Great sandwiches, terrible logistics. Ike's is the victim of its own success, they just can't handle the volume efficiently. I always order by phone (I go to the Redwood Shores location), I arrive at the time they tell me, and.... I still have to wait over 30 minutes in line. Not everyone can afford to waste time like that. 3 stars, since I grade the overall experience, not just the food.

I'm wavering between a 3 and 4 star for this review. Plus(+) 1) Quality and quantity of the vegetarian/ vegan options. You won't find this anywhere else. 2) Friendly staff - They are always super nice and bring your sandwich to you. 3) Free bag of dirty chips or fruit - yummy Minus(-) 1) They are sooooo slow. I think the staff is slow on purpose at times to keep the lines long and give the illusion of popularity. I see them write down the sandwiches on the sticky and then repeat the effort in telling the sandwich makers what to do instead of just handing the sticky note over. 2) Too oily. I don't like sandwiches with a lot of condiments and these sandwiches are just dripping with sauce. I feel semi gross every time I eat at Ike's. Ike's got bumped to 4 stars because it's one of the better sandwich places on campus.

Yelpsop's Fables "The fox and the grapes" One day the fox decided that he wanted to order a Ménage à Trois half sandwich with added bacon on whole wheat bread with chips on the side. He came to Ike's at around 11:45 AM on a Thursday and was surprised to find 25 people in line ahead of him. "My," thought the fox, "what a long line! And I came early, too!" Frustrated, the fox waited. And waited. And waited. Then, when he finally arrived at the front of the line, he ordered his sexual-innuendo themed sandwich, paid his $8, gave his name ("Fox") to the man at the cash register, and sat down to wait some more. After what seemed like an eternity (which is seven times longer in fox years, you know), the fox got angry and left without getting his sandwich. "I'll bet that the dirty sauce tastes sour, anyway," he fumed. Angrily, he decided to write a 2-star review on Yelp that would lower Ike's statistics. And that's that. Meanwhile, the hare (who was taking a break from his epic "Race to 500" with tortoise Dan) observed all of this from the quiet vantage point of a barstool-type raised chair and circular table. He sat quietly licking his caramel and green apple lollipop and wiping the last bits of Ménage à Trois BBQ honey mustard from his lips, fingers, and face. The hare, you see, had arrived shortly after 11 AM, waited only 5 minutes to order, and then got his sandwich, warm, toasty, fresh, and delicious, after a wait of perhaps 5 minutes more. Thus, while the line grew exponentially in size, the food supply increased only geometrically, just as Malthus would have predicted. But because he had rushed to get here early, before the curve began to skyrocket into the sandwich making stratosphere, the hare was able to eat in peace and even read about "instinct" and "natural selection" from Charles Darwin's "Origin of Species," which he just happened to have with him at the time. More than 5-star satisfied with his excellent meal, the hare left Ike's shortly before noon, while the line reached 30 deep in the background. Moral: Something as good as a sandwich from Ike's is worth waiting for. But don't be like the fox and complain and whine and blame Ike for your failure to plan ahead. This is not Subway or Quiznos, they make things to order with love, care, and quality ingredients, and you can't rush or outsource that. So, next time, be like the hare and come early having studied the menu ahead of time and knowing what it is you want to order. The fox can have his sour grapes and be be done with it. But the hare will be full of dirty sauce and halal chicken as he hops happily away to his next Yelping destination. The end.

Praise the lord! Ike's Place in the south bay is the most glorious idea ever! Almost a year has passed, since the first day my friend introduced me to this wonderful sandwich business, originated in San Francisco. To this day, I still hold Ike's sandwiches as the best store-made sandwich I've bitten. If you haven't tried it yet, now is the time to get yourself over there ASAP! What could be better than a good sammy, dirty chips, old-fashioned soda/juices with a caramel apple candy for dessert? :) The menu here is definitely smaller than the one in their SF store; however, I am still impressed by their larger selection, including many of their appealing vegan selections. Since I'm vegetarian, it's fairly difficult to find a veggie sandwich that blows my mind. Ike's, however, does. I came here for lunch with some friends from lab; since we ordered sandwiches ahead a time, we didn't have to endure the ridiculous but understandably long line. I got the vegan strawberry girl. Like all of their sandwiches, half is enough to keep my chugging for the rest of the day--portions are big! It was juicy, flavorful and extremely unique, sourdough beard was the perfect balance to the slightly sweet strawberries. Everyone in our group enjoyed their sandwiches, including the guys who had their vegan chicken sandwiches. I definitely plan on returning, if ambitious enough, to try every item on their menu.

New Ike's on Stanford campus that serves many of Ike's sammies in half servings, I guess to fit student budgets. Had a Matt Cain (Roast Beef, Turkey, Salami, God Father Sauce, Provolone ) and Herbert Hoover (Ham, Mozzarella Sticks, Bacon, American) combo. Everyone was pretty happy. You get chips with each sandwich and can choose from a variety of kookie sodas which is down my alley. Recognized the manager from RWC. I Think Ike was slinging sandwiches in back! The lines area already pretyt long and it seems liek ABC 7 was there to report the news. The building is still pretty new and not completely built out yet so there's not much ambiance to speak of. You can go sit outside on the patio area or at plenty of the lounge style seating on the new furniture inside. Im definitely glad to have Ike's closer to me now as I don't work in the building nextdoor to the RWC locale anymore. Cant wait for them to add more selection to the menu too! Note: their new phone line is not up yet so I put up the SF one

I like how there's actually places to sit and enjoy your meal, due to the fact that it is inside Stanford's Engineering bldg. The menu is a bit different here, meaning the same sandwiches as the original Ike's, but different names. I ordered a sandwich similar to the Eli Manning on dutch crutch and man always does the tummy good by hitting the spot! ?Parking sucks, but if you're lucky you can score a pretty nice spot which is literally right in front of the building.

I went here two days in a row in early April. My friend tried calling in the order numerous times, but they did not pick up! She even tried calling trying the SF location but they also did not pick up. THURSDAY: I came around 1:25 and there were about 3 people in line. It still took us about 5-10 minutes to get to the cashier. I ordered the "Going Home For Thanksgiving" only to find out they already ran out of cranberry sauce. They offered a strawberry preserve instead. I also asked if I could have the dirty sauce on the side, but they said that can't be done because it's baked into the bread. I wasn't sure so my friend ordered. She ordered a sandwich that had jalapeno poppers. She asked if they could be on the side, and they said no. My friend was able to get the jalapeno poppers on the side a long time ago at SF. Ike said that he's going to try to put side orders of jalapeno poppers and mozzarella sticks ?on the menu in the future. I did end up getting the Going Home For Thanksgiving with strawberry preserve. It was interesting.. I mean still decent but I missed the cranberry sauce. My friend enjoyed her sandwich too! FRIDAY: I met up with my friend (a different one) here. It was her first time. I looked up the menu again to see if any other sandwiches would interest me but I think my heart was set on Going Home For Thanksgiving... again. We got to Ike's around 2:20. There was a line of 10 people and we waited 15 minutes to order. I ordered the Going Home For Thanksgiving again only to find out they ran out of cranberry sauce again!! I couldn't think of any other sandwiches so I just got it with the strawberry preserve. We waited another 20 minutes to get our sandwiches. By this time it was close to 3, my friend had a meeting at 3:15 on campus, so she honestly had to eat & run. I had to save my sandwich till I got home because my parking expired since I only put an hour in. Make more cranberry sauce please :( Here are some tips: You will have to pay for parking, it can be paid via credit card in the structures. Unless you come after 5, but I'm not sure if they will have all the ingredients then. Parking structure 1 - has visitor spots only on 1 side of the 1st floor. Don't go up if you don't have a permit. Parking structure 2 - more visitor spots than PS1 & closer to Ike's as well. They only have one menu that can be passed around, so know what you want before you get here. If possible call in! They have a cashier dedicated to them. I guess no matter what time of the day, there will be a wait since technically there are only 2 cashiers.

really small store front inside the brand new engineering building. ?no signage yet. ?easiest to park at the structure at via ortega and panama (only 1st floor visitor parking), then walk across the street. ?then, if you pass coupa cafe, it's directly across on the other wing of the building opposite side. ?the menu is pretty complete 111 menage a trois, either half or full size, get fruit or chips with it flavors were there, but the dutch crutch wasn't toasted enough. it'll be improving i'm sure, but by then the lines will be very long signs up, lunch line starts building at 11 AM this time had the 1/2 spiffy tiffy -- still so yummy love the wet sandwiches but wonder the calories!

So i sent my husband to go get these sandwiches (pre-ordered) at stanford campus. He complained about how it was in the middle of Palo Alto and he had to go through lunch traffic (down town PA). ?We couldn't even find the address on GPS. ?Then he tells me that the people that made the sandwich were treating the sandwiches mean....who says that. ?Anyways i was nervous that the sandwiches wouldn't be up to his par of Little Luca's but i got to say.....That was AWESOME! ?I got the Elvis Kieth. ?I wasn't really hungry but i got a small taste and in three minutes half my sandwich was gone. ?Nice treat for the drive. I know ill be able to persuade him again to go there.

The best way to describe Ikes is like a yuppified version of that greasy corner sandwich shop you used to know and love. On the plus side, sandwiches are very flavorful and drenched with delicious unhealthy sauces. They also offer a wide variety of veggie "meats" which, as a vegetarian, is great. Unfortunately, the service makes actually going to Ike's a major chore. A few of my top complaints are listed below: 1) High price. A full sandwich costs on the order of $10 or more with no drink or chips 2) Skimps on the (fake) meat. Fake meat is dirt cheap, and at $10 for a sandwich and no table service, I'd like the meat to be falling out the sides. Instead, there's often barely enough to taste. 3) No menus in store. Since all the sandwiches have random names, you really have to pick out what you want to order online or on your iPhone before you go. 4) Online menu prices and promotions don't always match up with in-store price. So if you decide what to order on your iphone when standing in line for Ikes, you can't always be sure what you're going to pay. 5) Nickel and diming on sauces. It's $1 to add BBQ sauce to a sandwich, and even more to add pesto, on top of the $10+ you're already paying for the sandwich. 6) Long waits, both in line and waiting for your sandwich. The line always moves very slowly, and a lot of the time only one of the cash registers is open. Also, the cashiers always take a very long time, even if the line's winding out the door. After you order, it always takes tens of minutes to get your sandwich. (On a very busy day, it once took 2 hours to get my sandwich after an hour wait in line).

Came here on a Saturday in June while there were graduation ceremonies happening at Stanford campus. Ike's is a little hard to find. You have to park and then walk in the campus to the engineering building. There are no signs - the tables outside with umbrellas was my sign that made me think to head a certain direction. Long lines and no menu to look at while waiting. I would highly recommend to order in advance. They do have an iPhone app which is cool. I had the John Elway sandwich - pretty good. The dutch crunch bread is very tasty. I like how they give you a green apple/caramel sucker too. Quality sandwich but I wouldnt go out of my way to come back.

I came to the Stanford spot three times ?three days in the row. ?I look forward to burning off all those extra calories and Ill have a smile on my face because I know it was well worth it. But I will say it is on the pricey side but I quickly forget each time when I take that first big bite.

After hearing a bunch of my friends rave about this place, I finally got to try Ike's sandwiches today at Stanford. There are so many bad reviews about this location because of various reasons....but because I've never been to the Redwood city location, I think this place deserves better than the 2-3 stars that it's been getting. Pros: +THE SANDWICHES: definitely amazing and one of the best sandwiches that I've ever had. My friend and I shared the MENAGE A TROIS and the SPIFFY TIFFY. Honestly I liked the spiffy tiffy a bit more, because it just tasted more unique. Reminded me a bit of a salad....with the spinachy taste from the sauce. maybe because i'm not the hugest fan of bbq, so the menage was just aite. I mean it was SUPER DELICIOUS still, but I think I would try other ones next time. Downside is they ran out of dutch crunch bread! And because I got it to go...it wasn't as hot as it could be to make it taste like heaven. +CHOICE OF SIDES: ok ppl said that they only serve half sandwiches with the choice of chips/fruits on the side. I dont think it's not a good idea. I would rather have variety. But today they actually DO SERVE FULL SIZE sandwiches for $10+, along with chips/fruits on the side plus a caramel apple pop. i thought it was interesting. I also think the chips are super tasty. THe fusion one all the way man!! +Now with the option of ordering half or full size, and dude the full size IS huge. I felt my stomach exploding after eating an entire full size sandwich O__o +SIT DOWN AREA: heard the redwood city location doesn't have seating. This place does, and it's comfortable Cons: +Parking: yes parking is metered parking in the garages, but it's not THAT bad. I paid 50 cents for 20min. Just ordered and got it to go. Definitely good for Stanford students +Super hard to find. THere are no signs outside the building. It's not located too fat into the campus, but it's in a random octagon building that doesn't even SAY Ike's on it, so you have to ask around to find it. Overall, it IS pretty pricey for just sandwiches. But then again, Ike's isn't just any regular sandwich. Something about the "dirty sauce" just makes it so amazing. Definitely not something I'd eat too regularly though, as I feel like I gained so many pounds after consuming it all!

Very excited that Ike's has come to campus. ?Came before the lunch rush and walked right up. ?The staff was great and had some good suggestions. ?Ike was out introducing himself. ?I had the Ménage à trois -- delicious. ?Took the reco on the Dirty Chips "Funky Fusion" - a great combo. ?I hear what the other reviewers are saying on the 1/2 and pricing, especially if you are looking for a deal. ?BUT... the 1/2 sandwich was the perfect amount of food and I was completely satisfied with my experience. ?Good wishes to Ike's new location!

Best sandwich I've ever had. Was out visiting my buddy at Stanford, and he was raving about this spot, so we had to go. I got the Spiffy Tiffy, and it came with chips and soda. Ran me about $10, but damn was it good. If you're in Stanford, definitely stop by this place!

Great sandwiches. A bit expensive. I normally go in around 6:30. I've never seen the huge lines, but I did get annoyed at the guy working the counter when he decided he'd rather flirt with a female customer than take orders.

Only the Chicken is Halal here. ?As stated on the website and menus. We tried the "Hot Mamma Huda" and the "Spiffy Tiffy." ?Both were pretty good, but I liked the Huda better, because it had a little kick (because of the Frank's Buffalo sauce). You also get your choice of chips or a piece of fruit. ?They also give a nice caramel apple lollipop with every sandwich! ?Friendly service. ?The stanford location was a little hard to find, because it is inside one of the engineering buildings, but there is plenty of seating inside.

Ike's, I am giving you five stars despite the fact that I sat on hold for ten minutes only to be hung up on accidentally (it's cool, I'm patient), called back and was placed on hold again, ordered, battled for visitor parking in Parking Structure 2, lost and settled for parking in Parking Structure 1, walked .4 miles each way in the heat (this was actually good as it hopefully burned some calories before eating my amazing sandwich), and finally arrived covered in sweat and 20 minutes late to pick up my sandwiches. I ordered a CA BLT (I call them BLAT's) with jalapeno poppers on it instead of cheese. My boyfriend always gets the Rum Rum with double meat, and they've never batted an eyelash when we ask. This is key. Most places flip out a little if you try to customize your order to this extent. At the end of the day, it was worth everything I went through just to open the wrapper and have the extra bacon that didn't quite make it into the sandwich fly around like delicious confetti. I love that they are ridiculously generous with the meat and sauce on their sandwiches. Every time I eat one of their sandwiches it's like sinning for the first time.

I wish I had gone to Stanford. ?But not for school... who cares about academics when there's a delicious sandwich shop right on campus? ?Just kidding... dang, I hate being Asian... Anyway, regardless of your academic record, go to Ike's... they don't judge based on your GPA, SAT, ACT... whatever. ?All they care about is your name and your sandwich. ?And when I mean your sandwich, it could quite literally be your sandwich. ?They have unique names for their sandwiches such as the "We're JUST Friends," "Fat Bastard," and even the names of players from that baseball team around there.. I forget who they are. The names are just the beginning. ?As with any good sandwich, you've gotta have the right bread. ?When you bite a sandwich and you get that Cruuncchhhhhh sound, you've know you got a winner. ?Some of their best are the Dutch Crunch and SF Sourdough. ?Then you get to the combinations of meats, veggies, and sauces. ?The "We're JUST Friends" came with a halal chicken, avocado, and orange glaze sauce. ?Pepper jack cheese added a kick to the sweet and savory combination. ?And top it all off with a free caramel apple pop! I think I just drooled on myself a little bit. ?I want more...

Today was my first time trying a Ike's sandwich. I ordered the Change. It was a thin sliced rib eye steak with beer battered onion rings, smoked gouda and BBQ sauce. I posted a picture of it. It wasn't overly stuffed with meat and flavors weren't "OMG!" good... Maybe I ordered the wrong thing. I'll order a different sandwich this week and reassess.

The only sandwich I ever get from Ike's is the Menage a Trois. ?Having been to Ike's in San Carlos, I thought I would give their new location at Stanford a shot. ?Even though I arrived at 11, the wait was still about half an hour. ?They recently increased the prices so that a half sandwich ends up costing around $8 with tax. ?You get a bag of chips with your meal, but I'd rather just get the sandwich on its own. ?Service is friendly, but somehow, the sandwich didn't taste as good as the ones I've had at Ike's in San Carlos. ?I think it was because the bread wasn't toasted as much as I remembered. ?The sandwich is also very messy to eat. ?All sandwiches come with an insanely sweet caramel apple lollipop as well. ?Overall, worth trying once if you have the time to wait in line.

This is one of the most AMAZING places I have ever eaten. I am a sandwich connoisseur and it takes a legendary sandwich to really hook me. Well let me be the first to say Ikes Place was that place for me. I have been to all three Ikes Place locations and on days where making it all the way to SF to purchase a epic sandwich is just not in the cards, I head over to the Stanford Location (which has the most seating anyways) I live in South San Jose and would travel the close to 30 miles to eat an Ikes Place sandwich! ?Ikes place = epic and awesome nom, nom, nom's ?PRO TIP: If you are awesome enough I challenge you to attempt the Trials of Superman....

Halal never tasted so dirty. While their pulled chicken is soft and juicy, Ike's "dirty sauce" is what makes the sandwiches. Go with the Dutch Crunch bread for a nice contrast of textures. The caramel apple candy included with every order will def get you sprung.

Delicious! They also have a sweet deal at this location. From 3pm until close they throw in a free chips and canned soda (or bottled water) when you order a full sandwich.

I've tried the SF location before, and they're both equally just as delicious as each other. I can't get enough of Ike's! My friend and I went here on a Monday, because we were in the area. We parked at a parking structure (75 cents per half hour, I believe!) and tried to navigate our way through the Stanford campus. We got lost, but we weren't mad about it, because we were enjoying Stanford's beaaaaautiful campus! We explored while trying to find our way to Ike's. We finally found it, and the line wasn't too bad when we got there. I ordered the Matt Cain (roast beef, turkey, salami, provolone, godfather sauce) like I did at the SF location, just to compare. At this location, they don't give you a bag of chips, since the sandwiches are a dollar cheaper than the SF location. The wait was about 15 minutes, and we sat the tables. The seating area is soooo nice! But of course, it's Stanford--so that's expected. The sandwich was delicious!! The cheese and sauce went so well together and melted in my mouth. I saved the other half for later in the day, but I was so tempted to eat it all right there. My friend ordered the SF Giants, and I took a bite out of it--It was delicious, too!! Ike's is my favorite :)

I ordered THE CATCH, a savory meatball sub which was as sloppy as they come, but Ike's version adds lettuce, pickles an tomatoes, making it a very balanced sandwich!

I just learned about Ike's on-campus recently and now I am hooked. Since I work nearby, my co-workers and I call in on Thursday night for a big order for Friday lunch. They are always so accommodating and easy to work with. We arrive to pick up our sandwiches and our box is ready and waiting. Make sure you call ahead because the lines can get get quite long (on a Friday especially). Also, only a couple times we have been there, we are missing one sandwich OR one sandwich is incorrect but they jump on it immediately and get the correct sandwich out within 5 minutes. "Nacho Boy" was a big help the other day when our order was not quite complete. Super easy to work with and never questioned a thing - GREAT customer service!

My favorite sandwich place!!! My brother brought me to the Redwood City location first then when this place opened up, we have been going regularly every week, either on Saturday or Sunday at 10am. I like to avoid the long line and get my sandwich. My favorite and only sandwich I eat here is the Herbert Hoover with extra, extra, extra dirty sauce. I usually order 3 and eat 1 1/2 there, then save the rest for later that day! If you love sandwiches as much as I do, you should go here and at least try their delicious sandwiches!!

After spending some time at Stanford mall. My buddy and I decided to try Ikes place Stanford. This place is very hard to find if you aren't familar with Stanford. My friend and I walked around about for 15-30 minutes till we asked one of the workers where Ikes was. Once we found it we were happy. This location is better then other ikes, because you can sit down and there are couches. I got the Menage a trois which was reallly good. Ikes can be expensive but I think it's worth it.

These sandwiches are great. They have a ton of flavor, the ingredients are good, the bread is good, and different sauces that make for a wide variety of sandwiches to choose from. We come here everytime we're nearby, and we almost always get a Jamie Sirewich (our favorite) on Dutch Crunch, and then we try one new one. The Matt Cain, and Mark Cuban are favorites too. ?There's usually a fairly long line during lunch, so if you want to shorten your wait, call in your order, then come in and pick it up.

Their sandwiches and bread are tasty, but I'm not willing to stand in line for an hour just to get one. As a busy college student, I don't have that kind of time. However, it isn't busy during non-peak hours, like after 3 or 4. Even though the sandwiches are good, I do prefer Mr. Pickles Sandwich Shop. For me, the battle of the San Francisco Sandwich goes to Mr. Pickles, and Ike's cannot compare. However, to satisfy a sandwich craving that's a lot better than Subway, Ike's is a great lunch spot. The people there are so nice, though, and I love the atmosphere! My 3. 5 stars get rounded to a 4!

I love Ike's! Ive been to other locations before but this was my first time to the stanford location. Today I had the SF Giants sandwich in celebration of them being our 2010 WORLD SERIES CHAMPIONS!!!! It was great! But as far as the location...I wouldnt come here again if I wasnt already on the campus cuz its hard get to.

Went here on a late ?Sunday morning with some friends for the first time and have to admit that they are pretty tasty. I got a whole sandwich but should have stuck to a half as it was too much when you include the chips and drink. Price is fair for this kind of food (read: good).

I finally went to Ike's in Palo Alto after hearing about how awesome it was for years. I was intimidated to go to the one in the Castro because I was warned of insanely long lines. Anyways one Saturday we make the trek. Vegetarian and vegan options galore. Coolest names and a plethora of ingredients. I got the Jessica Rabbit, which includes vegan breaded chicken, stuffed jalapeno poppers, franks red hot, and ranch. Ummm can it get an y better. Now I just need to try ALL the others. I even watched Man vs Food the other day just to see people eating Ike's. A yummy obsession.

The only reason I eat here is the halal chicken. I tried four sandwiches before I found one that I liked. Spiffy Tiffy is extremely salty. It was the first one I tried, a complete waste of seven dollars. I don't get the obsession with this place. The sandwiches are OK, they are certainly not the life changing experience people claim they are. The service is what gets on my nerves. It is so slow. Even when there is a long line none of the people there bother to speed up. They take more than the time necessary to finish a task. They don't care at all if the customers end up waiting for hours. I only go there when there's no crowd. I always get the same thing: half a pizzle on sourdough with no bacon but all the veggies. It's a decent sandwich, but not worth waiting hours for.

Please don't get me wrong I love Ike's!!! The redwood shores location and what used to be the SF location are awesome!!! This location though is meant only for STANFORD STUDENTS. If you're not a stanford student do not go here. It is very hard to find and you have to pay for parking. They do not have a phone to take phone orders and that will mean it will take forever to order your sandwich!!! If you have never tried Ike's and would like to get a real experience drive a little further north to the Redwood Shores location. It really turns out to be a shorter amount of time to reach there because this Ike's is a 15-20 min drive after you exit anyway.

I stopped in at about 6pm on a Thursday... 5 minutes in line, 5 minutes for sandwich. Not the common experience I take it. Sandwich was awesome! Can't remember the name but for once something actually lived up to the hype. Minus 1 star because A: super hard to find B: super expensive and C: really annoying environment. As I sat waiting for my sandwich I was forced to listen to several of Stanford's finest (all male) tell each other to "pull the tampon out your vagina"... Not cool. Staff however was super cool.

The menu includes one page of vegetarian and one page of vegan sandwiches, so right from the start, this place looks good. ?The list of sandwiches is extensive, and (at least for the vegetarian and vegan menus) these are combinations you might not find anywhere else. However, this is not a typical restaurant, so beware: 1) You'll need to be patient. ?I visited on MLK day (no classes) and I still spent about 40 minutes waiting (on line to place the order, then for the order to be completed). ?I was also the only person over 30 in the building during that time ;-) 2) There is no posted menu. ?There are a couple of menus that float down the line (sometimes with pages missing). ?The menu is extensive, so try to check out their web site before you come so that you'll have some idea of what's offered. ?There's also an iPhone app (should you be so inclined) with a full menu. 3) If you're on campus, great. ?If not, getting here by car can be a challenge. ?If you're in downtown Palo Alto, consider walking (Google Maps says 1/2 hour), biking, or taking the free Marguerite Shuttle. ?If you must drive and you're not familiar with the campus, check out the Stanford web site for information on parking. Now go to Ike's and enjoy that sandwich!

Maybe he was new? Not quite sure, but it didn't make sense why we waited for about 45+ minutes!! I learned that the best thing to do is order in advance, I believe they have their menu on their website.

They get one star because their sandwiches are delicious, but I have never seen a less efficient, more mind numbingly slow and incompetent group of people in my life. ?This is no joke, they have screwed up more than half of my orders here (currently 3/6), there seems to be more employees running around than customers every time I come here, but they can never seem to make a sandwich in less than 30 minutes, regardless of selection or number of people waiting. Last time I had to wait for the cashier to finish talking to her friend on the phone before I could order and today a guy just standing around sneezed in the middle of the kitchen all over the food prep area. ?The food here is really good, but I just feel like I'm walking into a Real World or Jersey Shore volunteering event every time I come here, I just can't take this insanity any more.

Long wait, but supposedly not as long at the SF location. Many sandwich choices to choose from, which made it so hard to decide. I ended up getting a Sm. Tony Soprano and Sm. Lincecum. Not really a fan of the Soprano. The Italian dressing made it a little messy. I did enjoy the Lincecum. The avocado, bacon, and turkey tasted great. Overall, I would say that I would go back, but there are so many places that I want to try. If I do I will call in my order 2-3 hours before I want to eat.

Dear Yelp: this is a 5 star place that's been victim to 1. a bunch of bad reviews the two weeks when it was still working things out, and 2. people who expect to come here and get in and out in 15 minutes. ? The sandwiches at Ikes are unparalleled--they're the best in the Bay Area. ?The Stanford branch is, in my opinion, better than the old SF location--great location, tons of seating, and relatively shorter lines. ?That being said, if you don't want to wait in line half an hour, then don't go during peak hours (11:30-1:30 M-F). ?Either way, the wait and slightly higher price ($9-10/sandwich) is absolutely worth it. ?Ike's will not disappoint.

The sandwiches are terrific -- but definitely small (unless you sport around 9-10 bucks for the full). ?Really flavorful and creative. ? But this is a campus of busy folks, and Ike's is so slow and full of attitude that it's not worth it. Seriously? ?45 minutes for a sandwich? ?I say this after multiple visits, and others have noted the same in reviews. ?Do not go here during the lunch hour unless you want to eat a bag of chips and wait almost an hour for your next course (which will be delicious, but tinged with frustration). Also, the staff are not very friendly. ?We waited so long that we had to ask for our sandwiches to be put in a bag to go. ?This simple task took another ten minutes to accomplish. ?Outrageous. ?And not even a hint of apology.

As of 9/14/2010... I can't even believe this. I decided to return to Ike's because other reviewers had so vehemently stated that the half-sandwich thing was temporary, and sure enough, the online menu now states that both half and full sandwiches are available! Overjoyed, I decided I could start going back to Ike's Stanford. Despite the online menu CLEARLY stating that the Stanford location now serves both half and full sandwiches (this is not ambiguous whatsoever, it is the only location with a menu that lists two prices), only half sandwiches are being served still. I got worried when I noticed everyone eating half sandwiches but I thought meh, they'll honor their own fucking menu if I mention it won't they? When I inquired about full sandwiches, I was told that maybe it was a typo, and that the only sandwiches they are serving is the half sandwich. I was told perhaps that I had looked at the SF menu by mistake. So feeling like an asshole, I thought for sure I was mistaken. ?I doubled checked and sure enough, they are advertising BOTH half and full sandwiches are Stanford and this is the ONLY location where they are doing so. I did go back and tell them their online menu says they do have full sandwiches available, but was met with no offer to be made a full sandwich. Instead they started telling me about how they're going to start selling stew and coffee at some point. What? Do I give a half a fuck? No. So I left. And I won't be back until Ike's gets their story straight.

~10$. ?You do get a bag of "dirty chips" or a piece of fruit with your order. Read the rant below only if you want to be amused at my confusion and disapproval of this establishment. The place is open from 10-5 so if you go before the lunch rush at 11, at least you don't have to wait. ?When you get there, the place is pretty much a hole in the wall with registers in the front. ?The cashier who isn't that attractive tries to flirt with or seduce you before taking your order. ?They take care to write all their ingredients and double check you want all the vegetables (lettuce, tomatoes, onions, pickles, peppers), but they somehow neglect to tell you they put mayonnaise? or some whatever sauce I don't know. ?Their sandwiches on their menu aren't numbered in numerical order so I'm not sure why they even bothered numbering it. ?You order by the codename of the sandwich (e.g. the girl i'm dating or something frivolous like that), from the ghetto menu of stapled polyethylene sheet protectors. ?That aside after your order they ask for your name .. wtf? ?just give a fake one. ?When your sandwich is done they have this server run out frantically yelling out names and giving out sandwiches... at least bytes has a more organized system that preserves customer anonymity... though i have nothing nice to say about bytes either. ?The sandwich was excessively salty. ?Other than that, if you're willing to wait in line, like mayo, don't mind giving out your name, and like salty stuff (and increasing your blood pressure and risk of getting a heart attack), go ahead and eat at this place. ?Good thing I didn't wait the last time I saw the massive line. ?You'll probably get your sandwich 30 minutes later during peak hours. ?The only points this has on subway is the variety of ingredients and the bread. ?Not sure why anyone would want to recommend a place with such sloppy service and low quality descriptions of their menu items. ?At least at subway you can see them do things so you can, for example, prevent them from cutting your sandwich in half. ?The taste of the food does not redeem this place. the employee was barking at us to back up so he'd have room to run by as he frantically delivers sandwiches. ?they definitely need to work on some form of line/crowd control. ?i don't recall reading any warning like that in the sandwich section. ?perhaps they should reprint that warning on every page. ?i still don't understand the back3back on their menu. ?maybe they have problems with numbers? ?or they redefine them whimsically. ?~10$. ?You do get a bag of "dirty chips" or a piece of fruit with your order. if you're going somewhere on campus for lunch, try 'tootsie's at the sanford barn over' on welsh and quarry. ?half the crowd is in scrubs (curiously many of them drink diet coke) since it's right next to the medschool and hospital. ?you see what you get and you get what you see. no more and no less. the one cashier/waiter is impolite, but at least the rest are polite. ?it's got ok ratings on yelp : http://www.yelp.com/biz/… . ?slightly cheaper than ike something but you get salad or some kind of chips with your order. ?you get a number, and you get a seat. ?a lot more organized and a lot faster during lunch rush hours. ?seating is a problem though, but most people eat and go so you'll usually get a seat before your order's done.

Yummy! If you don't want to wait, get to Ike's by 11ish on a Saturday. I had a Bill Walsh with everything on it - really, really good. Is it good enough to drive half and hour and wait for another 30-60 minutes for them? Probably not, but if you're nearby and can phone or use their app to order I think it'd be worth it. I was surprised that my sandwich wasn't humongous - a half was just fine for me, but if I was really hungry, a whole wouldn't have been a problem. Perhaps it was just the particular one I ordered? ?If you like their cold sandwiches, check out the Ike's cold vending machine around the corner near the restrooms. Definitely a great sandwich if you're nearby and not in a hurry.

Fantastic sandwiches and service in a convenient location in the Engineering Quad. ?The staff have always been friendly (perhaps its because respect tends to be symbiotic) and more than willing to accommodate any request. ?For less than $10, one can consume an enormous sandwich from their giant menu of options - in the bay area, any lunch found for less than $10 coupled with great service and an obsessive appreciation for quality ingredients is a steal in my book. ?Be sure to order ahead via telephone or arrive before 11:30am - better yet, use their iPhone app to place your order and select a pickup time.

What kind of a restaurant won't give a young child a cup of water on a hot day after spending $18 on sandwiches????? ? I'm not sure if it's required, but I've never seen a restaurant that doesn't at least have a little paper dixie cup on hand. ?Even the almighty Whole Foods does, and Trader Joes offers water infused with watermelon rinds. ?If this building is trying to be so darn environmental, then why do they allow vendors to sell plastic bottled water that's been trucked in from a factory in like Petaluma or some other far place? At least the building generates about 3% of its electricity (that's on a sunny Sunday)! The sandwiches are really tasty, but nutritionally, a bit too bready for the amount of other stuff in them. ?I'm not vegan, buy I usually enjoy the vegan sandwiches as I have an aversion to anything that reminds me of luncheon meat. ? Every sandwich I've had seems to be served on a huge roll that's been squished down instead of on ?a normal piece of bread. ? I'm happy the chips are extra, as like the bread, they are devoid of nutrition, and I always wound up taking them home and serving them to guests. ?The lollipop is a cute touch - I now have a collection of them to donate to the food bank.

absolute best sandwich I have ever had! ?first day I tried the hot mama huda - it was so good! ?the next day I went back and tried an unoriginal chicken with whole wheat, american cheese, all the vege's, and honey mustard - it was awesome. ?long lines, but so worth the wait. ?about a 5-10 minute walk from my office. ?did I mention this place has the BEST sandwiches in the WORLD! :)
