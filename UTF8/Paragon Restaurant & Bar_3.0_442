I keep meaning to write a review for my special go-to work eatery. ?I keep forgetting. ?Well not today folks!! ?Today I shout out to the world that the crap reviews for Paragon are bogus. ?Wanna know why? ?One word. ?Well, no---two. ?Mushroom cigars. ?These things are pure crack and writing about them is making me feen. ?Damnit. The food is always consistently good. ?The ambiance is a page out of the book of "How Ali Wants to Design Her Future House That She'll Never Be Able To Afford". ?The service is the reason why it gets a 4 and not a 5 star. ?I get that they're all jaded and affected and whatnot, you know---with having to work so close to AT&T Park and for having to you know---serve tables, but every time I've been there it's like they really just don't give a shit. ?Bummer, cause everything else is spot on. ? My advice? ?Just put on a happy face, ignore the wait-staff, and enjoy their super delish food while admiring their decor.

Oh, Paragon. It's just a total hit-or-miss when it comes to this restaurant. They edited their menu recently and removed the only entree that I thought was good. To be short, this is a restaurant you go to out of convenience. It's spacious, easy to snag a reservation if you have a larger party, and close by to my office. The wait staff here has been satisfactory (I've gotten mixed up bills and orders before, but nothing that wasn't quickly resolved). But the food is just underwhelming for the price it's at. Some people I've dined with here like the grilled cheese, but it's not comparable to what you can get at the American Grilled Cheese Kitchen down the street. Takeaway points: Come here for a beer and some sides and you can't go wrong. If you want dessert, definitely go for the bread pudding because it's surprisingly delicious!

This place is gross. They have a 70 out of 100 score from the health department. ?Restaurants are required to post that information but I dare you to find where they've hidden theirs. ?They've found a good hiding spot where most patrons wont notice. I walk past this place every day and feel bad for the unknowing customers eating here. ?If they only knew! Yuck! I was in food service back in the day and know that it doesnt take much to get a score in the 90's. ?70 is unacceptable. ?Probably coming in for drinks is OK but I wouldn't risk eating anything from this place. ? Top it off our servers here were bad and rude. That's saying a lot because my friends and I are pretty easy to please.

This place is always super crowded during baseball season, so decided to try it one night during off-season after reading some good reviews in the Northern California Craft Beer Guide. ?The micro beer selection is worthy of 4 stars and a stop on the way to/from a baseball game (if you can get to the bar). ?But the food for me was just "ok" and pulled it down to 3 stars overall. ?I am not a mushroom fan (sorry Ali L), so maybe that could pull down my rating, but I did like the nice selection of items to choose from Pot Roast, Pork Chops, strip steak, etc. ?Service was good for a midweek non-game night. ?I wish I would have come on Wednesday night as that is their BBQ night and that looked like it might be pretty good. ?I'll update my review after I come back on a Wed

Great first experience. ?Went on a Wednesday night. ?The place was poppin, great atmosphere. I had the pork chops with grits. ?OMG, delish! ?The pork chop was grilled to perfection with just enough fat on the outside to keep it moist. ?It had a sweet and spicy asian-flavored sauce. ?The place is kinda dark so i could not see well so i had to fully depend on my taste buds that night. ?The grits were creamy and cooked to perfection. My friend ordered the soup of the day and the pan fried sardines. ?She loved them! ?We had a great experience and the price was good! ?Dinner for 2 for under $40. ?It was a great night! ?Thank you Paragon.

Good beer selection, the fish of the day is normally solid. End up here a lot for work lunches. Service is normally solid, we've had a couple weird weeks but normally good. The interior space is very pretty with confusingly elaborate lightbulb sculptures masquerading as chandeliers. Amazing mac and cheese. Simply amazing.

We sent the salmon back; it was delicious, but half raw. They cooked it some more.The waitress was very apologetic. Otherwise, we enjoyed the meal and the date. Appetizers (mushroom cigars, calimari) were awesome. Risotto was on the salty side, but good. I wasn't sure how to approach artichoke leaves in a sauce with potatoes, so I ate them, but spit out the tough leaves. Unusual and tasty beers on tap. The decor is part rustic, part tech, and doesn't quite gel for me, but that's just me. I do like Paragon. 3.5 stars plus a half star for baseball proximity.

After posting my initial review, the manager of Paragon sent me a very polite and appreciated response, assuring me that my experience was not "the norm." So I took a group back for happy hour last Friday, and here's what happened. Another friend received a beer in a chipped glass after drinking about 1/4 of it. The waitress took it away, reappeared with another beer in a new glass... that was 3/4 of the way full. That's right - he didn't even get another full beer for his glass-ingestion. Now he had not had even half of the beer - it was about two inches down. We all just sort of stared at it, horrified. I mean, what kind of service is that?

A very depressing update to my previous 4 star rating of this place had to be made because: they stopped serving their Moscow Mules in copper mugs. As ridiculous as this sounds, copper mugs make a huge difference. Maybe some of it's mental, but this was a huge part of the reason we loved coming here for work happy hours, before Giants games, or on random weeknights. Sadly, their Moscow Mules without the copper mugs just aren't the same. We've also noticed that they change their happy hour menu periodically and as of present, they seem to have taken away some of our favorite items, specifically the BBQ Chicken Pizza. :'( Further depressing, service here is inconsistent. It's becoming harder and harder to find a server here who even pretends to enjoy working with people. However, you'll usually find that if you sit at the bar, the bartenders are much friendlier than the wait staff.

A date and I went here a few weeks ago. ?The establishment is really nice and the wait staff is excellent, however, the medium cooked grilled skirt steak I had that looked incredibly delicious, ended up being really bland.

Came here for a medical lecture and they had drinks and appetizers ready to go for us. I'll start with the place itself. I came on a Thursday evening and it was busy but not overcrowded. Lots of after work, business professionals in the room. They had nice booths, bar area with TVs , and little tables through out the room. We went to the back and had they had a private room for us. Didn't order any drinks so I stuck with a diet coke. In terms of food, we had mini grilled cheese sandwiches with a tomato soup to dip in. (For all the raving they got about these little guys I was sadly disappointed..too greasy and cold). Tuna tartar wasn't bad, their crostini was delicious, their sliders looked good but I don't eat pork, crab dip was average, cheese selection was nice, some type of fried cheese ball that we got was weird. Overall, I can only rate based on appetizers and it was medicore at best. As I was walking past some guests their plates did look delicious. The steak and potatoes looked divine. May have to come back and try their dinner plates.

came here for dinner with my coworker while we were on business. I loved the decor of this place and the service was very friendly. I had the macaroni and cheese and my coworker had the quinoa. The quinoa was a huge portion and his only complaint was that there was too much butter, but I thought it tasted great! The mac and cheese was definitely rich but paired great with a healthy salad :) Overall a great place to stop in after the dinner rush.

This place was okay. I'd order something different next time. I ordered the grilled cheese and it came with tomato soup, which was good to dip it in. I would probably go back because it is a cool place, but you get a better bang for your buck down at other restaurants around there. Next time, I'd like to try a fish dish. I will say service was good, although we went at 11:30 for lunch and were originally the only ones there.

This place gets a 3. The service was great, but as we got closer to first pitch for the Giants game, it got so crowded our seats at the bar became uncomfortable with people standing behind us. The food was pretty good. My burger was a bit salty, as were the fries. My friend's fish tacos looked pretty good. We also got a calamari appetizer - which was good, but also included half of the items being lemons and onions, which are NOT calamari The gentleman next to us had some mac and cheese that smelled AMAZING, if I come back here I will need to try Oh - and apparently the night before Brain Sabean and Bruce Bochy and the Giants coaches were all in there watching the Yankees game

I came here for a company event. We booked the semi-private room with Hor D'euvres and drinks! Here is what I tasted: Arancini Fried Saffron Risotto Balls: Not good. VERY BLAND! Mini Crab Cakes: really good, especially when they are still piping hot. There is a crispy first bite and the soft crabby goodness on the inside! Mushroom Cigars: Really good. This was very crispy and tasty. You get the mushroom taste, downside would be the fact that it didn't look appetizing. Tuna Tartare: fresh and was very refreshing from eating all that fried stuff. It sits on a chip and so you get a good balance of the raw tuna and the crunchiness of the chip Roasted Mushroom Bruschetta: This was sooo addicting! Make sure you order more than one tray! You can smell and taste truffle creme fraiche! 4 pepper crusted Skirt Steak: Not a fan of this dish. Mini Smoked Pulled Pork Sandwiches: YUMMY! Very juicy and the coleslaw inside the sandwich added an extra to this sandwich. Roasted Beet Salad: Refreshing, I LOVE beets and this was really good and light. Miniature Chip-wich: REALLY GOOD! Wish the ice cream wasn't melting, but harder than they served it. Strawberry Skewers: There was a black pepper balsamic glaze on it that would get stuck in your teeth. It was stickier than caramel!! Loved it till I had to use the toothpick to pick out the gooey glaze. Chocolate truffles: Can't complain. It tasted like truffles. Over all, service was really slow in giving us our drinks... some people didn't get drinks till past 10-15 mins! They knew there was going to be about 50 people, they should add more than just two servers that serves drinks and the food. I would recommend 2 drink servers and one food server. The two servers were really nice.

I used to go to Paragon for lunch all the time when I worked near there, but recently went for dinner for the first time in years. Was pleasantly surprised. The mushroom cigars are as good as ever, and the half-fried peppers were nice also. Their salads are great--whether you go beet or just your basic. They also do a nice, basic mac and cheese. I grabbed a few bites of my friend's quinoa which was really flavorful and salivated over what looked like killer roasted chicken on my other friend's plate. We were also able to snag outdoor seating which is clutch on a sunny late-afternoon.

Great place to come before a Giants day game especially if you can get there around 11:15 just after it opens because it really fills up around noon. One friend had the grilled cheese and said it was gooey creamy goodness. Can swap the tomato soup for soup of the day. The calamari was delicious and it comes with a tasty salsa verde. We also got some aioli to go with it. Mixed ?those two together for a great dip. Split a blue cheese burger with garlic fries. It was cooked perfectly. The only thing that was just so so was their Bloody Mary. However, my friend said ?the Moscow Mule was terrific. Next time I will go with wine or a martini (stirred not shaken at Paragon ). Service was excellent. Our server was really on top of everything. ?Perfect before the game stop for food and drinks. ?Very well designed interior with lots of windows and sidewalk seating.

Still stuck on the happy hour stuff and small plates but so far I've enjoyed what I've tried. ?A little crowded after the Giants game so we kept it simple, the mini BLTs with fried green tomatoes were a nice twist on an old classic, and the beet salad was nice but adding a different lettuce than the frisée might be a good idea, a salad consisting only of that kind of lettuce wasn't what I expected, a little too bitter.

After our brunch reservation was misplaced at Nova bar, we were forced to quickly find a spot near the ballpark to get our grub on (prior to heading to the Giants game at AT&T park). ? Paragon was the only place with a table available immediately - and that was probably the highlight of our meal. Given that our waiter was either still drunk or very hungover, the service was lacking and borderline unprofessional. ?When we asked what kind of coffee they served, he let us know that they had run out the night before and he was going to be serving us Folgers Coffee (for $3 a cup mind you). ?Although I appreciate the honesty (kind of?) it felt like a slap in the face. ?He also let us know they weren't usually open on Sundays, and were only open to accommodate the folks going to the game. ?Maybe that explains why he looked so miserable to be there? The food left much to be desired in taste and quality. ?The fish tacos (why you would order those here, I don't know) were bland bland bland. ?The garlic fries that accompanied my burger were the only memorable part of the meal. If their usual dining options ?are anything like what we experienced I doubt I'll be heading back here any time soon.

It was fun sitting at the outside table watching Giant fans walk to the stadium for the game. I had to grab a quick lunch that day, so I just got the tomato soup and the mac n cheese. I was sad they didn't have the jerk chicken wings available that day! So.... the tomato soup.. VERY authentic. It was sooo sour. If anyone has tried to make tomato soup, that's how it comes out. SOUR! The mac n cheese was pretty awesome. wish the pasta was cooked a little bit more. There was a hard layer of parmesan cheese on top covering the creamy, saucy pasta underneath. Tons of herbs and flavor! My boyfriend only got the local salad... nothing special to talk about.

We came here before and after a Giants game, and both times were solid. Before the game, we stopped in for drinks and a little something to eat. That ended up being tequila shots, beers, and an order of ribs. So about those ribs...get them! The sauce is great and you'll want more afterwards. The cole slaw with them, bleh, why would I eat that when I can eat pork ribs slathered in sauce? Okay, I'm sure it's good cole slaw (actually I don't like cole slaw in general). After the game, we finished with a beer and got plenty of laughs from all the drunks near the stadium. I learned that night that if you mix tequila shots, ribs, garlic fries and beers, you will feel sick. VERY sick. It was worth it!

When you first enter the space you are immediately confronted with an immense feeling of grandiose verticality, be it from the high vaulted ceilings and exposed rafters of the modern loft-style architecture, the overflowing amount of sunlight that radiates inward, the floating wall that opens out to outside/inside patio, the impeccably posh selection of heightened lighting, and all these elements warmed up with the dark woods & metal accents. ?It is just simply delicious, and I haven't even gotten around to the food yet. During my lunch hour, I enjoyed the Paragon Burger with bleu cheese, prepared medium-rare as I like, and lightly seasoned. Served with a side of crisp garlic fries and fresh aioli. ?It definitely wouldn't boast about the burger, it wasn't anything spectacular but it was definitely made more pleasurable when enjoyed in the midst of the wonderful space.. I'll just have to try something more signature to Paragon's menu next time before I can truly gauge. If my soon-expected return here is not for something else off the bistro-style menu, I would gladly opt for a drink at the bar next time. Let it be for a quiet pick-me-up alone after work (my office is a block away), or for dinner with friends & company. ?Either/or, I can already tell I will be returning.

We were sitting into a small table very close to next one when there were more than 3/4 tables of the whole restaurant empty. We asked for moving to another table. The first answer was they were fully booked. They still moved us to another table after 5 minutes. Until we left, whole two hours since we first sat down, there were still about 1/3 tables unseated. And every table adjacent to us was empty. Our server didn't come check us as often as other table. We thought they first didn't want to move us because they wanted to make most of the seated tables together for their serving convenience. Other than this little unhappiness, the food was actually good. The fried calamari was really tender. The portion was huge in every dish. We will still come back if we want to dine in SOMA, but definitely not our first choice.

I went to Paragon with two friends before the Giants game to grab a few drinks and it served its purpose quite well. I was debating whether to make this review three stars or four.... I went with four because: 1. The bartender was very nice 2. They have a great been selection on tap 3. Both the mac and cheese and the wings ?were good With there being so many bars right in that area I would probably try another one next time but that doesn't mean I wouldn't come back here. Worth a stop in to check it out.

I've been to Paragon before. It wasn't bad! The location is great for a pre-game drink or meal. HOWEVER. This Wednesday BBQ Promotion thing they have going on needs some serious work. I ordered the Pulled Pork sandwich (Carolina style) and it was barely edible. The meat was tasteless...the cole slaw on the sandwich was not crispy and had WAY too much mayo. The roll it was on appeared to have been toasted at one point, but was so soggy , that taking a bite into this sandwich was a complete mess. I couldn't even eat it, it was so bad. I felt bad when I payed the bill because I felt like I was getting ripped off having to have paid for that soggy and tasteless mess. Sorry Paragon. You have a decent beer selection, but I'll eat elsewhere in the future. Disappointing.

6 stars for last night! Redemption time. WOw. ?And what redemption at that! Service was stellar, from the hostess to the bartenders to our super cool waiter. Mushr0om cigars with porcini aoili - this is a MUST order. ?I've been to Paragon probably a dozen+ times over the past few years and not just on game days and (at least) one order of these ends up on our table. Wednesday nights apparently is BBQ night. ?GET THE RIBS. and do SHARE if you order appetizers! ?My friend and I both finished barely half because it's a huge plate with a very generous slab, collared greens with corned beef and baked beans (sweet, StLouie style) The GM took care of me and my friend last night for the past issues and as a result, I have deleted my past poor review so you won't even see it. ;) ? I do think the reviews are underrated for Paragon. ?I'm really happy I gave them another try. ?We will be returning and I will continue to send friends here. *** Other recommendations from past visits: Mac'nCheese - not typically into the hype of $6 mNc however, theirs is pretty delish. ?Split it. Blue burger - can't go wrong, especially with a Hefe outside when the sun is shining. Beet salad - perfect if you like beets, that is. Also the braised pot roast with garlic mash & veggies falls in the pretty damn yummy category.

I've gotten lunch here a few times for work and both times, everything was really good. I've always wanted to try quinoa so when I saw it on their menu, I knew I had to get it. And surprisingly, it was delicious. I could have used more mushrooms because I think there were only 2 scraps in there. But for $15, I probably would never get it if I had to pay for my lunch. It was pretty tiny for the price (about the size of a small soup) and I was still starving. So the next time, I decided to try the grilled chicken salad (no goat cheese, though) ($12) and the mushroom cigars ($8.50). Both these dishes were amazing. I enjoyed every bite of the salad, but again, for $12, it would be nice if there was more so I'd actually be full. The mushroom cigars were amazing but kinda of greasy. The porcini aioli, though was a great touch to the cigars.

Let's start with the positives: Outdoor seating, proximity to AT&T. Unfortunately, it goes way downhill from there. I ate here with my mom, brother and girlfriend before a weekend Giants game. The weather was perfect and we had a great table outside in the sun. Our waitress was terrible. She was slow, aloof, sloppy (spilled a beer all over the table and my mom's chair and didn't bother to clean it up) and wasn't even friendly. The food was underwhelming. My mom's burger, order medium, came out rare. My girlfriend's salad looked like it had slugs in it and she didn't eat more than half. The fist tacos were decent, but not very flavorful. I would definitely never eat here again, although getting a beer here when Momo's, Pedro's and Pete's are packed wouldn't be a bad call.

No happy hour? ?Really?! ?I mean you are right by the Giant's stadium and NO HAPPY HOUR? ?Who are you? ?Are you trying to come off as an upscale restaurant/bar...because you're not. My coworker, Jamie (shout-out to Jamie), is a HUGE fan of the place and hypes this place up like it's the best bar to go to after work (we work two blocks away). ?Needless to say that I was GREATLY disappointed when I found out that there was no happy hour. ?The drinks are not even that great. ?You would think they would make drinks like Bourban and Branch or the W Hotel for them to not have a happy hour menu. ?Um...no. ?It's overpriced, watered down, and mediocre. ? As far as the food, I've eaten here about 3 times already. ?I really tried to give the place a chance food wise since I despise their bar. ?The food is OK. ?I'll give the 2 star for the food. -Calamari is a bit too chewy. -The Mushroom cigars are pretty good, I can give them that. -Grilled cheese is ok. ?Then again the place is right by American Grilled Cheese Kitchen. -The fish tacos are probably one of the better main dishes I tried for lunch. ? All in all ---- *shurgs shoulders* meh.. ---Update, word on the street is after NOT HAVING A HAPPY HOUR MENU for the longest time, they started a happy hour menu. ?It's about time! ?They probably got a bunch of people asking about it. ?My review stays the same until I try the new Happy Hour Menu. ?Check back for an update in a week or two.---

Busy at work. 5 days before my birthday... and I have not scheduled a venue yet, unfortunately I have 34 friends who have agreed to spend my special day with me. The stress of last minute planning doesn't really phase me however, I whip out open table and run through the list emailing the Managers. 2 Restaurants get back to me and Paragon was the ultimate choice. They had a private room, preset large group menu, in the room the have a projector as well as a screen, adding to that... they are pretty affordable for a group dinner, about 60 bucks per person. The event staff is extremely helpful in getting me set up with appetizers as well as the menu. We ordered the rib/bbq group dinner and a bunch of the appetizers. Note to people choosing to eat here, get the mushroom cigars, it's a crowd pleaser. I'd have to say at my table the chicken was moist and tender, the ribs were a bit on the dry side, but the brisket was tender. Other tables didn't fare so well with some raw chicken and drinks that were mis-charged. But the service was impeccable and for a last minute gathering I thought it was fine. 4 Stars for Service 3.5 Stars for Appetizers 3 for the mishaps. I'd give it a 3.5 all around.

Nice, but came on a non-game night. Def felt laid back and nicer than a sports bar. Had the burger (good), tried the pork chops (good), and a veggie quinoa dish (OK). Services was attentive, but is was after 8pm so not too busy in the restaurant. Will probably be back if I find myself down in the area on a non-game night. The place is super close to AT&T and probably is a zoo before and after a game.

FOOD/DRINK: 1.) Mushroom Cigar = woah. These were actually pretty good. And they looked good too. Nice long cigar rolled up with dipping sauce stacked up like sticks ;P 2.) Russian Mule = O my. This drink is pretty good. Gon order this at other bars. If they have it. Came in a tin cup.. kinda unusual. *.) Big Dixx Beer = hahaha jk there was no such thing. Just a joke with drunken rowdy group... uh... hahah... SERVICE: Omg our waitress was awesome. (Even though our group was rowdy she was pretty cool with us) Annnnnd she showed us the awesome trick of opening a wine bottle with your shoe!!! lmao. (If you're reading this, sorry we were so drunk & rowdy!) ATMOSPHERE: Casual yet kinda upscale, it's nice it's clean. Half out door seating, like a whole wall facing the street opened up and they had tall tables and bar stools to sit on, with big television screens to watch the ball game that is JUST happening like one block behind them. So I guess that's what a lot of people do. Then there's wooden bench seating... So this is all more in the outdoor cocktail bar area... Then there's a bar itself... Then the inside of the restaurant which has a better look and feel of a classier restaurant haha. Anyway cool place to grab a beer and some appetizers, watch a game if you're into that

Eeeeee-yeck. ?The newly "rebranded" Paragon sucks like an Oreck vacuum. ? The space that used to be cool and inviting is now rustic and raw. ?The menu that used to be passable is now devoid of good choices. ?Bad, bad, bad, Paragon management. The tuna "burger" turned out to be chunks of less-than-sushi-grade tuna stuck together and barely cooked with some wasabi mayo on an altogether too squishy bun. ?Can you say "disgusting"? Perhaps Paragon has realized that the moeny to be made is really before the Giants games and "the hell with the rest," however why take a concept that was working and turn it on its head? If you want a beer before watching the G-Men, Paragon is it; if you want real food, go elsewhere.

Had a team building dinner here after a Giants game at AT&T park. ?3.5 stars rounded up! Had: * Duck fries (nice flavor, easy to eat, gone in seconds) * Mussels appetizer (yummy, touch of spice, mmm) * Artichoke appetizer (looooved this, my co-workers complained it's too hard to eat, so I ate it all by myself, yummy yummy, love artichokes!!) * Monk fish over corn, asparagus and artichokes (the fish didn't have a whole lot of flavor, but nicely cooked, light, refreshing vegetables) Two co-workers had the grilled cheese with tomato and avocado added - that looked yummy! With a small bowl of tomato soup and salad. I would try that the next time. Really nice ambiance, friendly service. Relaxed, relatively quiet place for us to chat without screaming to talk. I would come back here if I was in the area.

I went here with two people to have some drinks and apps. The drinks are very good. I had a grapefruit cosmo and tried the seasonal autumn drink (which was amazing). ? I like the dipping sauce that comes with the bread; it's spicy! The highlight was the BBQ pizza, which was pretty good. We also got the calamari, which came in a huge greasy portion that I would not order this again. The deviled eggs, were bland. The side of spinach was bleh... I thought it would be fully cooked and yummy, but was actually only partially cooked and too salad-y. There was a quinoa dish on the menu that I hope to try another time; it sounded good.

You know the places you always avoid, because the after-game crowd looks ridic...well, DON'T for Paragon. I'll let you in on some gamer knowledge...get seated inside, you won't wait more than one minute. If you want to sit in the "be seen, see all" patio spot, then you might as well give up! Lively place, with quality food. All of the ingredients look and tasted fresh. This menu is full of comfort food, which is perfectly fitting after winning a nice day game at the yard. Since I neglected the garlic fries at the yard, I thought I'd try the burger and garlic fries here. Boy, am I glad I did. This burger was seasoned to perfection, and juicy enough for me to almost eat the whole thing. Their fries were beyond delish, small, crispy fries with garlic, minus the gobs of oil most places serve them with. Others had the pulled pork sliders, although they were cold, their tangy flavoring and tender pulled pork were perfectly paired. Another favorite at the table was the Mac-n-Cheese. When I read rosemary, white cheddar, I was completely a skeptic, but when I tasted it, the rosemary was a compliment, not overbearing...which I was dreading! The grilled veggies were as one would hope, perfect grill marks, tasty, and not over cooked. Two servers kept trying to sell us the Peach Cobbler, but we decided for the Almond Brownie...which I am regretting only taking a few bites. Walnut brownie deserts are so common, lo and behold, Paragon goes and uses Almonds...they know their stuff. This desert would be regularly consumed if I lived in the city. Warm brownie, almonds, and ice cream...enough said!! Bless our little server, it was his first week, so he get a pass. As you'd expect with a very crowded place, service wasn't stellar, but it was decent. Crowd be damned, I'll be back again...

I am wavering betwixt 3 and 4 stars. Thusly because there are some standouts, but there are some very standard. Atmosphere is large and open, burly and cavernous but charming. Light fixtures are interesting - but fuck, here I am talking about LIGHT FIXTURES when there is food to review, see what I mean? 3 or 4... Our Hostess was friendly enough, server was very blah - but, the manager came over a few times and he was personable and fun. We ordered the mini corndogs and the mushroom appetizer - corndogs a toal miss, but this is from a person that eats corndogs soley for the corn batter. The mushroom dish - lovely. The most concentrated mushroom flavor wrapped in filo dough. Nice. Next for me was th ebeet salad - nothing that you haven't seen before, and missing the crunch component from a helpful toasted nut. Dinner; salmon over quinoa with chantrelles, also nothing out of the ordinary, but superbly tasty. Salmon had crisp outer and lovely texture, chantrelles wonderful flavor. Roasted Chicken with Mac. Ok, this mac & cheese, baked and served in its own ramekin - outrageous. Mac is mac - often bland, gooey greasy cheesy mass of calories and not a lot of flavor. This mac stood out as one of THE best. Bursting with taste, awesome creamy texture - all that you want in macaroni and cheese - and more than you ever thought it could be. Delectable. Their house burger is also well made, not a standout - but no complaints. Drinks are thoughtful, however - weak, to my taste. Dessert. Ok. I am a dessert whore. And most of all for crisps and crumbles. This crisp is missing one most important component, it's namesake, for God's sake. It was almost missing! Barely there! Naked! Cookie sandwich was a bit odd, with the "bread" made of what seemed unbaked cookie dough. Hard to eat, the ice cream becomes a burgler out the back window when the police arrive. Running everywhere. I would try Paragon again, for the hits were great hits, but the misses were, well... confusing.

The fact that I didn't have to pay for my lunch made this restaurant a lot more appealing. I guess free food tends to do that. The point is that if I was spending my own money, I wouldn't go back for the food. It's a nice place to meet a friend for a drink, if you're in the area, but I wouldn't trek more than say, 4 blocks, to do that. I love calamari. There is nothing that says delicious like a giant plate of fried tentacles. Here's what calamari needs: Salt and Lemon. Pretty simple. Here's what it doesn't need: caramelized onion, fried green bean, and potato. Perhaps Paragon didn't realize that the menu said "calamari" and not "home fries" but in any case, even if those ingredients had been left out, there's still more flavor in a saltine cracker than in that squid. Since I had been feeling a little under the weather, I got the squash soup special. It was yummy and just what I was looking for, but really, how hard is it to make squash soup taste good? The answer is it's freakishly easy. They basically do average so well that they charge a higher price for it.

Folks at Paragon: What are you thinking when you fired Pete? You fired him for giving people samples of his custom cocktails and an occasional heavy pour of your cheap wine? I get it, it's a business and alcohol is profit but here's the newsflash, it's a neighborhood bar. Every once in a while regulars get a free drink or refill. It happens. You are a corporate restaurant and bartenders like Pete are the only thing that gives you an identity outside all the other ballpark McRestaurants in this neighborhood. He can keep up with the game rush, be personable, keep people happy, and acknowledge EVERY customer who comes in. I'll continue to go there occasionally as I like Spencer's food and Matt is trying his hardest to run a tight ship but I have to question your decision firing Pete.

After bar hopping after the Giants victory parade, we eventually walked toward the ballpark and landed here for the majority of the night. It turned out to be the perfect choice. We got here at 4pm and the bar was packed with fans sporting orange and black. The sporadic "Let's go Giants" chants would fill the bar with cheer and made for the perfect atmosphere. We ended up spending over 5 hours here and had a blast. They ended up running out of Stellas but the Lagunitas Pilsner was a decent substitute. It seemed like they were unprepared because many of the drinks we tried to order weren't available. I'm not sure why they didn't stock up enough alcohol when they knew it was going to be a full house for the celebrations. While we mingled and celebrated, we also ordered the calamari and the mini corn dogs to munch on while we were putting our livers through the ringer. The corn dogs were not very good and it took over an hour for our group of friends to eat the minis. The calamari on the other hand were fantastic and we immediately devoured it. The batter it was coated in and the sauce it was served with was so good. I loved the spice in it. I would've liked for an extra side of the sauce and would probably ask for it on the side if we ever land in here again. I would've given them 4 stars but had to ding them for running out of Stellas and Stone and the average mini corn dogs. ?Perhaps the next time I visit, they'll be able to redeem themselves.

I love weekday lunches at Paragon. The pretty atmosphere matches both casual and elegant, so it's been a good place for lunch meetings, lunch dates, and coworker celebrations alike. I'm a fan of the variety in the menu here--heart attacks on a plate (ie the greasy grilled cheese sandwich and tomato soup) are balanced out with a number of healthy delights (the portobello mushroom quinoa special). A good one is ordering half a green salad (probably the best-tasting house salad I've ever had) and the mac and cheese--which I don't seem to like as much as everyone else, but it's pretty good. Different. Lighter. Worth a try. I'm also a fan of the prices. Everything at lunch in the $7-$15 range. Not bad for a place that's way nicer than your average downtown fast food joint (though I hate to break it to you, not nearly as fast). However, I wouldn't come here for dinner. Why? It's just too safe. Kind of boring. Much more exciting places to be for dinner. Also, unless you're right in South Beach, it may not be quite in walking distance from work--though there seems to be plenty of parking around during the day. Definitely not at night, the weekend, or a home game Wednesday during baseball season, though. For lunch son, for lunch! Paragon is the paragon of lunches in the area.

It's all in the name Paragon, a flawless diamond or pearl, beautiful without parallel. Which is almost a 5 star. A little flaw gives character and I like character. The wait staff is always on top of it... But I have not found one that carrys much character other than a pretty face. Sometimes a little too cool to be overly friendly. But nothing to complain about. The ambiance is relaxing and a great break from the office. The outdoor seating is small, but comfortable if you can manage to get a table. It is a great stop to the ball park. It gets busy during game days, but other than that I have only found it mostly half empty. The menu is short but sweet. I actually like the small selection do to studying the menu too long. I usually know exactly what I want when I go in. The peach cranberry tea is great for a hot day, I mean sunny, but fair out. I'd prefer this as a lunch spot as opposed to dinner.

I have been here about 4 times. Everything that I have had has been delicious. But my favorite is their grilled cheese sandwich with tomato soup. Service is good too. Just a block down from AT&T Park too. HELPFUL TIP: It is super dark in here, so ladies, don't worry if you don't have enough make-up or your mascara is running, it is so damn dark in here, it really doesn't matter!

Our evening here got off to a great start. ?At least, my evening here got off to a great start. ?I ordered the Hot Apple Cider, which was a mix of apple vodka with apple juice, topped with amaretto cream. Best hot apple cider I've had to date, hands down. ?My friend, on the other hand, was less than pleased with her Sassy Blonde. ?She described it as "over-peppery and way too spicy due to the jalapeno juice." As for the main course, my slightly over-salted roasted chicken with spinach and mac-n-cheese was good, but I echo the sentiment of my fellow Yelpers in that Paragon definitely overcharges if you take into consideration the quality of their food. ?My friend's seared ahi tuna with risotto and truffles was disappointingly bland. ?Looks like it just wasn't her night. I think I would have rated this place better if we had just stopped there and go to the Cirque du Soleil show early, but no...we had to get dessert. ?We got the chocolate torte, which was mediocre in taste and extremely dry (not a good sign when chocolate torte is supposed to be fudge-like). Food was 2.5 stars based on quality alone, 2 stars if price is factored in. ?Drinks were 4 stars. ? i somehow remember the Paragon in Berkeley being a lot better than this, so the SF location was a huge letdown. ?Too many restaurants in the vicinity to settle for this place. Fellow Yelpers, if you have a choice, go elsewhere.

My first time dining here was last year. This was my first date with the boy. There weren't too many patrons, but then again, it was a Monday night. I was still recovering from my birthday weekend, but the boy said that I had to try their mojitos. He said the magic word...*MOJITO*....and I caved. I ended up drinking two of those bad boys and they were deeee-licious. The food was quite tasty. For our appetizer, we either had the Spicy Crab Cake or the Calamari....or both...can't remember. I had the Grilled Hangar Steak, and he had the Roasted Chicken. The boy was raving about their Mac N' Cheese, which is why he ordered the chicken...it comes as a side. Once it came out, I had to see what all the fuss was about. One bite, and I was in love!! It was soooooo good. They bake their Mac N' Cheese, so the top is crispy, and it had just the right amount of cheeeesy goodness. I've been back a few times to grab some Mac N' Cheese and mojitos before the Giants games. This place gets pretty packed, but its definitely better than buying the expensive ballpark food. I've been meaning to try other items on the menu, but I keep coming back for the Mac N' Cheeeeeese! The only bad thing is that they're not open on Sunday's unless there's a Giants game. So if its not baseball season, you're out of luck.

Hit or miss with this place. But overall, A-OK. HIT 1. Garlic fries, mussels and calamari are really good when you're there for cocktails or just wanting some nibbles with friends 2. Pretty well made cocktails (they make a mean lemon drop and an equally mean apple martini, and decent wine selection) 3. Getting a table for lunch or dinner is not difficult except when there is a Giants game on 4. Service is consistent and reliable 5. Lunch menu is small but that's its beauty. Give the steak a shot and their fish entrees are nice. 6. Lunch salads are pretty good! 7. Love the outdoor seating on those clear SOMA days 8. Good for after work drinks with co-workers MISS 1. Of late, the times I've been there for lunch, the burger bordered on overly greasy as did the calamari... ugh! 2. Of late, the food arrived way too quickly (for a steak) and was laid out a bit haphazardly 2. Is definitely a bit pricey for the "OK" quality food 3. Place needs some serious sound insulation! Noise level here makes COCO 500's noise level sound quiet. Noise just bounces off the walls. Overall, its an A-OK place I visit once in a while for a change in my palette, since I work a couple of blocks from here. But they might want to work on the food and noise level lest Paragon become ParaGONE. Peace out, my peeps.

Been here twice, once for dinner and once for lunch. Drinks: average and unimaginative. ?I suggested some ingredients to see what the bartender could do and he, well, combined the two ingredients. Food: My salad was flavorless and the steak was well done and chewey. ?My entree was uninspiring. Dessert: The best part of the meal, but equivalent to a cookie bar I might get out of my own freezer. Service: Friendly, but very slow and not attentive. ?For a place that serves lunch to the local crowd, you'd think they'd try to shuffle you out in an hour or so. ?We would have ordered another round of drinks if she would have been a bit speedier. In summary: Jack Falstaff, Coco500, or Tres Agaves are much better choices within a few blocks of Paragon.

3.5 stars rounded up. I come here for lunches on business so I never deal with Giants games crowds and I never pay for it, otherwise I would think it was a bit overpriced. But so it's still 4 stars in my book. Food wise I really like this place! Mushroom cigars--SO GOOD. It's like a fried tube of thin dough with mushroom in the middle dipped in a delicious mushroom sauce. Sounds weird but somehow it just works. Shishito peppers--Love these. Always good. Mac and cheese--great! they make it with rosemary, white cheddar and parmesan breadcrumbs and it's quite good. Fried chicken sandwich--I haven't had this but my coworkers always get this and RAVE. Steak salad--awesome! Fresh, light veggies and lettuce, good portion of meat. Quinoa--good! Could use a little richer flavor, however the sauce thing they put right on the top (no idea what it is) is really good. Butternut squash soup--this was a soup of the day and it was only eh. Fish of the day--I've gotten this twice and both times it's been DELICIOUS and a really light but filling meal with some veggies and garnish. I really like this place, but I've never come to drink or to watch the game or to foot the bill, so I may have a different opinion. That being said, I think the food is actually really good!

For full disclosure, I'll have to tell you that I didn't have a full meal here. My friend and I did the SF Urban race and its starting and ending point was at Paragon. We were late in the morning so hadn't given it much thought, but at 4.5 hours later, when we're all huffing and puffing on our way back to the finish I noticed some wonderful things. 1. It's spacious with high ceilings and has open large windows which I think were open. This seems to be the general layout for restaurants in SOMA, I think, but seeing that I'm a NYer I need to appreciate these kinds of things when I see them anywhere. 2. Unfortunately I was still recuperating from a night I had a few days prior (see my review for Trad'r Sam) but my friend was well enough to order the mojito I siphoned a sip of. Strong! and legit. I hate it when I go somewhere and the bartenders take shortcuts with their mojitos! But not here-- they grind and crush the limes and mint leaves like men(!)-- and I like that. 3. I had the mushroom cigars and it was freaking delicious. Even though I had to pick that because it seemed to be one of the few things that didn't have to be slaughtered on the menu, I wish I stuck around longer and was able to sample some more of their food. Unfortunately we had plans to go eat sushi boat and had to get something to fend off the hunger until we got to Japan town. I regret it now, since the sushi boat kind of sucked. 4. The staff is serious eye-candy and super friendly. I think the best-looking boys in San Francisco work here. My friend and I were giggling about it all the way home-- I'll be back boys, wait for me!

I'm a big fan of Paragon during Giants season (pre-game drinks/grub, post-game desserts), but otherwise, I don't visit unless it's April-Oct. ?Prices are not cheap, especially for the cocktails- but the quality and selection of drinks and food are generally strong. ?They have an EXCELLENT mojito, and a great beer selection. ?I have been known to knock out a few patron silver margaritas here as well, but watch out as they will get you for $14 or so each! Food wise, my top selections for pre-game are mushroom cigar appetizers (kind of like a super-skinny lumpia with a ground mushroom filling and a great dipping sauce) and the grilled cheese sandwiches- which come with a great hot tomato soup for dipping and a nice mixed green salad. ?Go big and add bacon. ?I have sampled many other things off of the menu, and nothing has ever been bad, but nothing has ever grabbed me as a 'must have' either (beyond the grilled cheese). Post-game- the 'must have' is the chipwich ice-cream/cookie sandwich- one of the best I have had anywhere. ?It includes warm chocolate fudge dipping sauce. ?I have also had a great banana bread pudding, and a few other very yummy desserts- a solid selection. ?Espresso too :-) In summary, I give Paragon a solid 'Giant's season rating' of a 4-star option in the area, but otherwise I probably wouldn't eat here (not sure if I have ever eaten there?) outside of baseball season. ?I do indeed enjoy that outside seating, and that said, I have spent multiple thousands of dollars here with friends over the past 6-7 seasons, and I will surely return soon....

Went here with a friend from high school in town for work. ?We had drinks earlier across the street at....?? ?I don't remember. But I do remember Paragon's fantastic Mac & Cheese. ? At previous happy hour, we had some small bites, but I needed more base in my belly before I added to the martinis & wine there. ?So, I ordered the Mac & Cheese with our bottle of wine (also fantastic). Service wasn't memorable, and we were at the empty bar. ?Which is the bartenders bad, as both myself & my friend are former hospitality workers. ?I know my friend still tipped well, as Lehmen Bros were picking up the tab, but the tender could have done even better, I'm sure.

What do you get when you cross really high quality ingredients with apathetic line cooks and a menu that was created while in the throes of boredom? ?Not much. I have been coming to this place for a little over a year simply becuase it's a stone's throw from the office and they have outdoor seating. ?Honestly, NOTHING on the menu, which I have sampled almost in it's limited entirety, is worth getting excited about. ? They have great quality produce, fish, and meats, but they manage to make sure that none of it tastes good: ?Salads are either boring and flavorless or overrun by some kind of crappy dressing. ?The calamari is greasy and contains huge chunks of fried fennel, which is a downright ghastly, and the pulled pork tastes like it was doused in liquid smoke instead of... well, acutally smoked. ?The specials are thrown together, often missing some sort of critical component: a plate of fish with a veggie and no starch; or leftover pasta hodge-podge with a laddle full of melted butter. The patio is a nice place to sit and have a glass of wine, but other than that, this place is utterly blah.

if you're sitting down to lunch with three women of various ages, the lot of you set on quibbling about how you should be "watching your weight," it's nice to throw caution to the wind here and order the paragon burger (with blue cheese!) or the meatball sub. The sub comes with homemade barbecue chips, and any order of fries gets ketchup AND ranch in a cute dipping tray. Service can be sloooow, so bring folks you want to talk to.

So after reading the negative and positive reviews and combining them with my own experiences at paragon I've learned a couple things. It helps if you know someone who works there and it's a better for lunch meetings because it tends to close at weird times. My buddy used to work here. I went to paragon a handful of time to pick him up. Sometimes i got their early and he wasnt done with his shift. He'd say sit down at the bar and have a burger. That's what I'd do! Their burgers here are high-end burgers. I think they use rock salt when grounding their beef, which makes the beef very flavorful. It will come with fries and an aioli. I've only had one other thing here and it was a ribeye steak special with the fries and it was tasty enough, but expensive. I've also come here several times with my work and 3 of us ordered the burgers cause we love them so much and my boss got the fish. He knows more people there including some of the bartenders so he gets stiff drinks. It pays to be in the know here. Bottom line: you ain't from Frisco and looking for dinner by the ballpark, try another neighborhood. If you're friends of the restaurant and are feeling like an expensive, but good burger or some drinks then go in and sit down. Truth be told the burger is gonna be the same price as burgermeister or joe's cable car or any of those other dishonest burger joints. Great 15$ burger!

I WAS a ?HUGE fan of Paragon, frequenting here at least a few times a month, The food was fantastic, the drinks were excellent and the ambiance was exceptional. However after my last experience they have lost a loyal patron. The food is Ok. Sadly, no longer something I would rave about to my friends. My favorite dessert, the Chipwhich, which was once a sinful concotion of chocolate chip cookie, vanilla bean ice cream and WARM chocolate dipping sauce is now a SLOPPILY thrown together cookie and ice cream, with COLD chocolate dipping sauce. Fresh, hot fries are no longer, as the fries that we ordered came out totally cold. ? Overall, this is not the Paragon I onced loved.

My co-worker and I had to work late, on Thanksgiving none the less and we went to the Paragon since it was near where we worked. We didn't have reservations and the preset Thanksgiving meal was very good. The butternut squash puree had great flavor and the mashed potatoes were legitimate. Paragon even made Turkey sandwich kits to go. Whether it was because they had a lot of leftovers because they didn't have a large turnout or they were super thoughtful. Either way, they put a good twist on it but it was a lot of food. It was a little pricey for what you got but overall not a bad experience, especially in a bind.

Went here for quick bite, and I have to say, Paragon is just alright. ?The service wasn't perfect. It seems like it's one of those restaurants that's all about location! Fantastic Mac N Cheese, and Fantastic Pulled Pork Sliders.. I haven't tried anything else so it's hard to judge the rest of the menu. I heard the burger is really good, with the blue cheese. I'll probably go back because it's quick and easy, and good comfort food.

UPDATE 11/07/07 this place is mediocre with slow service, and not worth the visit during weekday lunch hours. ?2.5 stars ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~?~ "2/5 SERVICE: 25 minutes before our food came out. 3/5 AMBIANCE: ?i was here in the winter but it appears they have a nice patio for warm weather 3/5 FOOD: ? thumbs up on the grilled cheese and garlic fries 2/5 VALUE: ? below average. ?$30 for 2 people for lunch" so i heard that paragon has one of the best grilled cheese sandwiches EVER. ?and i think it could be true. ?2 kinds of cheese between thick (but not impossible to bite thru) piece of baguette style bread. ?and it's not greasy or soggy - the key to a good grilled cheese (besides the cheese of course). ?the tomato soup that came with it was more like a tomato puree - it was ok. ?my friend said his chicken sandwich was "rubbery." ?fries were stardard with hint of garlic, and crispy like mcd's. ?i'd go back for the grilled cheese but for now cannot vouch for anything else. ? oh did i mention it took over 25 minutes for cheese to grill?

Really pretty restaurant near AT&T park. Came here last night with some friends for happy hour (HH from 4:30 to 6:30pm M-F). We ordered a couple of small bites to share, a couple beers, and cocktails. I tried the pomagranate punch, which was on happy hour special for $5. It was okay. Didn't taste too packed with alcohol, but it wasn't too sweet either (i despise overly sweet drinks). It kinda tasted like a jolly rancher. But unfortunately, it was one of those drinks where I didn't want to drink fast enough so the ice melted and diluted it. Boo. There are plenty of other cocktails to try on the HH menu and wine and beer for $5 also. Onto the food we tried ($5 per dish): 1) Pulled Pork Quesadilla (Fontina cheese, chipotle aioli, pickled jalapenos) 2) Fried Mac-N-Cheese Balls (with roasted tomato sauce) 3) Jerk Chicken Skewers (w/ cucumber salad) 4) Buttermilk onion rings (w/ kansas city BBQ sauce) All the food selections were great! Each selection came with 4-5 pieces (with the exception of the onion rings, came with 6). The portions are small but like the menu says, they are just "snacks." Go with some friends and try everything! All so yummy. 2 stars for the drinks, 4 stars for the food.

Definitely get their mushroom cigars, calamari, and burger. The grilled cheese sandwich is good if you're mouth can take the hard country bread. And the quinoa is also very tasty. But without a doubt, order the bread pudding for dessert. It's not a wet bread, but a thick, warm dense dessert with yummy whiskey sauce, bananas and pralines. It is so good that my friend always requests the bread pudding from Paragon for his birthday instead of birthday cake!

Maybe I've gotten soft, but I really like Paragon as a place to get bites and drinks around South Park. There aren't that many options down here and I appreciate that Paragon is a reliable choice. I highly recommend the mushroom cigars, so tasty! The portions are respectable so that you would be pretty set if you ordered 3 apps for 2 people. If you feel like watching people come and go from the ball park and nearby offices, there's outdoor seating with heat lamps. Also, maybe it's because I work start-up hours, but I like that it's never too busy. The staff has always been friendly as well.

So like many people we went to the baseball game one day too late to see the home run and the game was totaly boring and empty. ?So we left and went to Paragon. ?I went out with one of the chefs for a short while and always wanted to come in and try the food. ? Of course we had hot dogs at the game so we weren't really hungry but we did have a sweet tooth. ?The chef did sent out two desserts for us, one a bread pudding which we basically attacked and devoured and the other a chocolate mouse. ?The mouse was OK, but the bread pudding was perfect, and the scotch in the caramel sauce was even better, gave it a great flavor without being too sweet. We also got some chocolate martinis which were OK and the service was a bit slow which made me wonder what it would be like on a busy night. ?But the food being served all around us looked great, and if we had any room left we would have ordered it. ?The meats looked great and the mac and cheese amazing. ?I'm definately coming back to try that.

The first time I ate at Paragon, I was with a gaggle of cute PR women who bought me lunch. ?Free food with cute chicks? ?Yah, I had some pretty fond memories of that lunch -- I had the burger, which was slightly oily, but nonetheless tasty, but, what I remember from that lunch was how awesome and delicious that the grilled cheese *looked* from across the table. ? Like a fine wine, memories have a way of aging nicely, so then, yesterday, when it was suggested that we go to lunch at Paragon, I was like, "OMG that place has the best grilled cheez evar" (cuz I was on IM, I had to use the lingo) -- unbeknownst to me, my longing for the grilled cheese across the table had matured into a concrete memory of its tasty deliciousness. Unfortunately, the reality of Paragon's grilled cheese could not compete with a matured memory of something that I never actually tasted. ?I mean.. yes, the grilled cheese is decent -- thick (but not too thick) slices of bread surrounding a melty multi-cheese blend of cheddar and something else, accompanied with a tomato soup and salad. The sandwich was toasty and pretty good, but the tomato soup was really not great. ?Maybe December isn't the right month for tomatoes or something, but it was sour and not great. ?It was slightly disappointing, but even judged not in the shadow of my concocted memory, it was still substandard. So, Paragon.. ?now my memory of you is balanced with these two experiences, perhaps reality is somewhere in the middle.

You can also make reservations. It's a fan place to go with friends or on a date. I work very close to the restaurant, so we often end up going after work.

5 stars for the Mushroom Cigars starters and the grilled cheese and tomato bisque soup. I tried bacon twice on the grilled cheese- although good, I was never able to finish it. =(. Soup is not bad. The mushroom cigars are delicious and will attempt to make it myself in the near future. I bet it would cost less than $10. Kind of pricey but definitely a 'hip' place (do ppl even use that word anymore?) for happy hour and business lunches/dinners. -update- My coworker and I decided we wanted some grilled cheese for lunch today so we called in to order it. We arrived 20 mins later and was informed that there were some miscommunications... and our orders were not ready. ?The bartender (the person you pay your to-go orders) and Trevor, one of the servers, were really apologetic. We decided to lunch in instead since we still had to wait for our food. The service were great- and Trevor was really helpful. We weren't that upset about the situation but that might be because Trevor was extremely easy on the eyes... and very charming to boot. *wink wink* Anyway, Trevor's hot, our food was good, we had great service. They were generous with our bill due to messing up our orders and we left really happy. Definitely will come back for the food and service again. =]

Some people here have been really hard on this restaurant, and I'm not sure why. My wife and I came in for dinner on 12/17/11 before seeing Cirque Du Soleil. I chose the restaurant based upon it's location: it only takes 5 minutes to walk to AT&T Park from there. Our server was pleasant, informed us of the specials, and brought the drinks out quickly. The beer selection is very good, but expensive. I'm not a wine drinker, so I can't comment on the wine list. I ordered a skirt steak served on a bed of beans and spinach. When the server asked me how I would like my steak done, I said I would like it "on the low side" of medium, and I watched with pleasure as he made a detailed note of it on our order slip. The steak was done perfectly. My wife ordered the butternut squash soup, which was a special that night. I tasted it, and it was excellent. We were pressed for time because of the show, so we skipped dessert. My only feedback is the TV's in the bar. The decor, ambiance, and menu presentation say "trendy" but a football game on a big-screen says "sports bar." It kind of makes me wonder what this restaurant wants to be. Is it a bar with a restaurant, or a restaurant with a bar? Overall it was an excellent dining experience, if a bit pricey.

I've been here a couple of times now, both times with my Dad who's a regular and really enjoys eating here. The atmosphere and decor are all nice & chic (did I just call something chic?!) - what you would expect from a place with $15-$25 main dishes. I've heard bad things about the service here but never witnessed it directly so I'm going to chalk that off as hearsay and say they do a pretty fine job in this department as well. That leaves the food! You're definitely not going to get any super value meals at Paragon but if you're dining in the $15-$20 per entree realm they're food is ?worth what you pay. I had a red clam chowder last time that was great - a nice change from the standard SF chowder, and for my entree I ordered the hanger steak. I ordered it medium rare and, guess what?! I got it medium rare! Major points for not cooking it medium and calling it medium rare. Other notes: Great wine list, and all the deserts to date have been scrumdiddlyumtious. If you're looking for a nice meal by the ball park (or after a quick pint at O'Neills) then Paragons definitely worth a try.

All I can do is give more props to the staff at Paragon. Pete, Chris and Matt make good drinks at the bar. The kitchen tend to amaze me when I order something different. I will have to ask them to leave ham out the potatoe salad! I'm sorry but thats just nasty. Any meat in a potatoe salad is nasty to me. But keep the grilled cheese and fresh chips and onion dip coming and please another long beach please! ?And for dinner I'll go ahead and have the Roasted Chicken with the Mac-n-Cheese and martini hanger or goose will do. Thanks guys

Alright, if it were up to me, I would give this place three stars. I really do like the food (mushroom cigars, roast-beef sandwich, mussels are so good), but the service is complete crap. I called for a friend's birthday to see if we could sit outside (it was 70 in the sun) the guy on the phone was completely unhelpful and when we got there, we had to twist his arm to get us all to fit outside. All we're asking is for a little creativity and this guy had none whatsoever. It took the food 45 minutes to get there, so the birthday girl (who has an hour lunch break) had to wolf down her food in order to make it back) and the butter lettuce salad is $9 for a head of lettuce with a few almonds sprinkled on top. Seriously probably cost 99 cents to make. The clincher and the move that garnered the 1 star is the HORRIFIC (ie I've never seen anybody so ill in my entire life) food poisoning that my boyfriend got after eating a Paragon burger. Literally he spent the whole night throwing up every 20 minutes. So it's Russian roulette with Paragon. Good food, bad service and you might just barf all night if you're not lucky.

I tooolldd you all I would update you when I tried the grilled cheese. Well, I did and well, IT WAS AMAZING..talk about an orgasm in my mouth. ?And to think, I got all those lovely flavors from a simple grilled cheese with tomato soup! MMMMmmmmm, the bread is perfect, crispy and buttery enough to let the middle be perfectly soft and scrumptious. I ordered mine with turkey, you can choose ham or bacon as well. The soup is so fresh and thick, more of a dipping sauce than a soup but not quite as thick as an actual dipping sauce. ?The soup is also full of flavor. ?Comes with a salad and my server experience was on point today :0) lucky you paragon, 5 stars!

Paragon is one of our local bars and while I don't really drink, it's always been a good place to grab dinner. ?Their pork sliders are fantastic, and the BBQ chicken pizza was a bit too spicy for my wife's liking. ?

This place is very underrated. ?The food is great - try the roast chicken with mac and cheese or the halibut. ?The fish special is typically very well done and healthy - not too many heavy sauces or oils. The atmosphere is great - even before a game this place holds it together well. ?When its warm outside you can sit outside at night. ?The service sometimes leaves a little to be desired but all in all this is a gem in South Beach.

Consistently, blah. The tuna tartar is practically flavorless, the asparagus soup is extremely watery, and the crab "cakes" (this is misleading, it is really one small cake on a bed of lettuce) was overcooked and bland. Even the oysters, usually a sure thing when dining on the Embarcadero, lacked punch and the juice in the shells appeared dirty, which was both an aesthetic and appetite turn off. Blah blah double blah. And yet, we must appreciate Paragon for what it is - a good place to escape the pregame Momo's crowds and grab a drink, app, and SEATS! Yay for seating, boo for blah. 2.5.

It has the convenience of being a block away from AT&T park going for it...and that's pretty much it. Menu is pretty much standard American food...garlic fries, calamari, salads, mac & cheese, salmon, chicken & steak. The food is pretty mediocre, the prices kinda high for the complexity of the food (or lack of). Service was OK, good place to go before a giants game and that's pretty much the only time I would suggest.

We also had our company holiday party here - perfect little private room - very attentive staff - and tasty wine and beer selections!

The food was okay. ?A decent enough place if you want to go somewhere nice to eat (as in nice decor/more upscale) in Soma for lunch, though why you would pick this over something like South Park Cafe I have no idea. ?Be on your guard when you order because they really push the mushroom cigars on you. ?Do not be irritated if they act like they didn't hear you the first time and mention it again (like asking before you order then asking again after you order). ?Apparently some people do not know their own minds and need to be reminded. They do have a nice patio and often on warm days it's packed at happy hour.

I've worked in this neighborhood for six months now, and am only just getting there for lunch. ?I figured it was a scaled down version of Momo's just across the street, and so never ventured further than necessary. ?The prices were similar, though without the white tablecloths. There was hardly anyone in there as we sat through the lunch "rush" and that was surprising. ?Maybe folks didn't want to come out in the heat. ?I know that it appears to be super crowded at times when I've walked by on a nice day. ?But, this day, more than half of the tables were empty. I looked at the Caesar, which can come with either grilled chicken or salmon, but also eyed the Hangar Steak salad. ?I thought, hey, maybe I can get two salads in one...so I did - they prepared the Caesar with the hangar steak. ?Yummo. ?However, they included the reduction sauce on my meat, and I wasn't totally thrilled. ?Had I known a sauce would have been thrown atop, I would have nixed it. ?But the meat was tender, medium rare, and totally tasty. Not a spectacular lunch, but good enough. ?And it was certainly good to hang with an old colleague and play catch up.

Came to Paragon for dinner. ?First time here. ?Sat at the bar. ?No trouble getting a seat considering I arrived at 6pm. Ordered a Fat Tire (on tap), a wedge salad and the roasted chicken. ?Luckily the chef whipped up some thousand island dressing since I don't like blue cheese. ?Onion straws were good but tasted like they were from a can. ?Iceberg wasn't the best I've ever had. ?Kind of the middle of the head; not a lot of green. ?Kind of disappointing. While waiting for dinner, bartenders buddies came in and things got boisterous while they all did shots. ?Even the bartender got in the mix. ?All dropped F bombs, including bartender and GM, who came over to see what the ruckus was. ?No issues with the F bomb, but not typical in a classy restaurant - which is what I thought this was. Anyway... Chicken came. ?Side of spinach and mac and cheese. ?Chicken was fried first and finished in the oven. ?Tasty but not the best cut of chicken. ?Fairly fatty. ?Spinach was very good, with just the right amount of garlic. ?Mac and Cheese was phenomenal. ?Worth going back just for that Mac and Cheese. Flagged the barkeep down and asked for my check. ?Left 15% tip, grabbed my jacket and moved along. I'd go back, but the service needs work.

Let me start by saying that I love the Paragon in downtown San Jose for midweek drinks. Best cocktails around and a lovely bar. But we are talking about the San Francisco Paragon here. And you'd expect it to be the city version of the suburb cousin. It seems to be quite the opposite. The Paragon in SF, when I walked in, reminded me more of Gorden Bierch than a nice hotel restaurant (but I guess it is attached to an apartment building and not a hotel). However, the grilled cheese and tomato soup that I ordered lived up to the Yelp hype and were delicious. Thus the four stars despite my initial disappointment. I feel I must go back after work some day and try the cocktails to make a fair comparison.

I appreciate a good healthy meal at a restaurant. ?Afterwards I feel full, content and not feeling like I need to run to the gym and work off the calories. ?And bonus points if the restaurant serves fresh fish that is well prepared. I had an excellent healthy seafood lunch at Paragon. ?I split the fish of the day and fish tacos with a friend. ?The fish of the day was grilled over a bed of couscous. ?Portion size reasonable for the cost. And the fish tacos were the best I've had yet in SF. ?Instead of frying the fish they grilled it, and it included an assortment of flavorful toppings. ?Overall an excellent meal and it felt good to eat well and not do to much damage to the pocket book.

My boyfriend and I decided to try this plate because his dad had mentioned this was one of his favorite restaurants and it was on my boyfriend's restaurants to try so we gave it a go. We left the Giants game after the 7th inning to avoid the big crowd and came straight here. ?Its down the street from At&t park on the same street as Momo's that's oh so popular. We were seated right away. ?Dimly lit restaurant/lounge spot. ?Nice decor and cool big mirror by the bar but whats up with the janky TV's? ?You know since you're by At&t park you'll have people watch the Giants game here. ?Step you're TV game up. I thought the food was going to be a lot more expensive based on location and decor but it wasn't bad. OMG I was soo excited to get the grilled cheese with tomato soup! ?Did it meet my expectations?? YES! ?I love slicing up the sandwiches and then soaking it into the tomato soup. ?It also came with a huge salad that did nothing for the plate. ?I think it took away from the meal personally. ?Their were dark greens with a balsamic dressing that tasted like nothing. I wasn't too thrilled with the calamari as our appetizer. ?It had A LOT of stuff including fried onions, asparagus, and some other vegetables which is cool but it was just too salty. My boyfriend got the oysters and a cesar salad for his meal and he said it was just okay. I would say this place is decent for food. ?May be better for just drinks and lounging. I wouldn't mind coming back for that grilled cheese with tomato soup though! ?More restaurants should have that on their menu!

***Update*** Went this past Sunday and had the Grilled Cheese Sandwich...added bacon.. INSANEEEEEEE! I love the bread they use, perfect amount of cheeese, and boy oh boy, I think I died and went to heaven.*** ************* I'm rating this place a 4 for it's BAR SCENE/FOOD/DRINKS. Not on the restaurant so relax. Come here after games at the ballpark - it never dissapoints. The servers have always been excellent and if you live upstairs in The Towers at 88 King, you even get 10% off your tab.Grab a table in the bar or outside and order drinks, apps, sandwiches, etc. Crowd favorites include: the Mussels, Burger - a pretty darn juicy patty and don't forget to add the cheddar and bacon, garlic fries, mac n cheese and grilled cheese. The crab cake is forgetable and a waste of calories though. ? This spot kicks Momo's when it comes to Bar Food. Momo's doesn't even offer a Bar Menu seperate from the Dining Menu (not okay!). Go to Momo's before games for drinks and come to Paragon after for a cooked to order burger and drinks . This place is closed Sundays.The boys aren't bad looking here either =P

I was actually pretty impressed with Paragon. ? I needed a place for a 10 person dinner party on Fleet Week Saturday. ?We had people coming from all over the Bay Area, and I was worried about the post-Blue Angels traffic/cab nightmare situation. ?Turns out Paragon was a snap for everyone to find and there was actually parking to be found nearby. ? They had really tasty comfort food. ?Nothing too fancy, I had the chicken with Macaroni and Cheese. ?The chicken was perfectly cooked and the mac and cheese rocked. ?The only thing I didn't like was the cheesecake. ?It just had WAY too much orange zest. ?It was almost bitter. ?But the bread pudding was delicious to make up for it. ? Our server was also very sweet and put up with the 10 of us who had been on a booze cruise all day long. ?I was impressed with her unflappability and I thank her for putting up with the drunker members of the crew.

Knew better than to stroll into a 3 star Yelp reviewed location and expect more than a 3 star experience....but there was a parking spot next to it and I was super hungry. ?The salad was the best part of the meal but you cant go wrong with blue cheese dressing and blue cheese crumbles. ?Also got the soup of the day, a vegetable beef something or other that sounded great. ?Way too much thyme....to the point where it was unappetizing. Ordered the pot roast figuring it was the safest thing on the menu. ?It was dry. ?The potatoes were too pureed. The two two measly mini carrots just made the plate look pretty. Service was okay. ?Home girl took the half eaten soup away with out asking if it was done. ?Then she came back after the entree, seeing a half glass of wine and half a pot roast, she grabbed my pate from in front of me, no question as to if I was done with my meal. ? I wasn't done. ?There were people trickling in, must have needed the seats for someone else.

Paragon will always have a special place in my heart as the pre-boozing and eating spot before the Giant's game.... I have been coming to this neighborhood bar for at least 7 years and they have always made stiff drinks and pretty decent appettizers and sandwhiches... The ambiance is loud and full of excited Giants fans.... I hear the place is pretty "dead" in the off season... As far as food goes, I usually get the steamed mussels in white wine broth and the Paragon burger with fries... The mussels are some of the best I've had in the city, and that surprises me considering all the highend establishments that I've had them at in the city..., overall everything served is fairly good and priced reasonably by city standards.... If you're ever in town to see a game, stop by and take a load off..., you won't be disappointed.... Go Giants!!!!!!!

Close to the ball park! I wandered in and ate a delicious meal after a game. I would probably go back for more grilled cheese. My pal George made fun at my drink because he said it was for girls.

Tasty lunch grub but the service is uneven. Lunch the other day took 90 minutes and it wasn't any particular single event -- entrees (which was all we ordered) took almost 60 minutes (w/ an apology). Then a free dessert was brought out to us - nice gesture but smarter would have been to ask if we wanted free dessert given that we were already running late. Then it took 15 minutes after i gave my credit card to bring back a bill (and restaurant was almost empty by this time). It literally took me standing up, putting on my jacket and moving to the hostess table to prompt action. c'mon Paragon get with the program - i see several service complaints in earlier reviews as well.

The word "paragon" means "a model of excellence or perfection of a kind; a peerless example." ?False advertising, anyone? I went to Paragon last night before the Giants game. ?I hadn't been there since 2005, and I doubt I'll go again before 2011. ?Once every 3 years is enough for me. Paragon features traditional American food with a pretentious, organic twist. ?Unfortunately, giving the dishes long, fancy names, much like charging high prices, doesn't add flavor or originality. ? I had an iceberg wedge salad, which was served with crispy fried onions on the side. ?The onions were pretty good, but the bleu cheese dressing was too sweet and too fatty. ?I also ordered grilled salmon on a bed of Yukon potatoes. ?My salmon was a bit overcooked, and the potatoes were as bland as they could be. ?The few strands of shaved asparagus that adorned my salmon seemed to look better than they tasted. ?I had to add salt to my entree for flavor, something I do very rarely. The restaurant itself is very cramped, with tables placed way to close to one another. ?We were seated in the back of the restaurant, and I didn't have a great time navigating my way to the exit. ?I almost bumped into two people who were quietly enjoying their meal. ?Also, because the tables are so close together, it was easy to eavesdrop on the conversations people were having. ?For example, I heard our waitress explain the specials to the couple at the adjacent table. ?Obviously, we did not look like the people who could afford the specials, because she didn't bother telling us about them. Paragon food is healthier than ballpark food, but just as overpriced. ?It's a decent pre-game meal, although it'll cost ya.

With the different locations around The Bay Area, Paragon S.F. is my favorite spot when I want to get something good and filling.The menu reminds me of In-N-Out. It's the same menu with the same simple dish but each and every-time it leaves me satisfied! ? Though it doesn't have the most AMAZING interior it's still modern and when it's not super busy it's quiet and personal. Great place with a group of friends (celebrated my birthday there) Sweet place for a date (she was impressed) Awesome place to eat and drink before the Giants game.(Giants still suck) What I recommend here for first timers are the following: Side of Mac-N-Cheese. I swear this is the BEST Mac-N-Cheese I've ever had. They serve it in a porcelain cup and it's piping HOT. Cheesy Gooey Goodness and just Purrrrrrr-Fect. (Going to the game? Get this to go and bring it in, it'll save you a couple of bucks for a beer.) I would then pair it with their Mojito. Mojito's here are comparable to the ones I make. I let me tell you, I make a mighty fine and awesome Mojito!! Calamari are good sized not the the itty bitty reject ones. For the entree dishes you could pick anyone of them and your sure to be filled and have some for left-overs. As for the service, I think the wait staff here are pretty attentive. During the baseball season when it gets packed it gets a little hectic but they're not forgetful.

Appetizers and drinks only please! This review is solely based on their appetizers and happy hour specials. During a trip to San Francisco, I stopped here not once, but TWICE during my trip. Drink specials are tasty and definitely at a good price considering the area we were in, but the star of the show were the appetizers. Was it the enormous serving of fries? No, but close. The crispy and tender calamari? Tasty, but that wasn't it. Was it the mushroom cigars with the porcini aioli sauce? DING DING DING! This, folks, is the reason why we came back. Looking like a super long taquito, this little bad boy is chock full of flavors ranging from diced mushroom, garlic, onion, parmesan cheese and served with an aioli sauce that cannot be beat. With it's flaky crust which is a marriage of the flakiness of a fresh pastry and the crispiness of a hot wonton. If I could eat this all day, I would. So after such a schpeal about it's delectable ?greatness, why the three stars? Service. There were only two or three other small groups in there, and the staff walked by us so many times that I could count them instead of sheep to go to sleep. So as much as I can say about this, I'll stick with appetizers and drinks here and pass on the food, because if I had that same type of service during a dinner with friends, I would not want to invest my time for anything more than just a few drinks and some mushroom cigars with some friends.

High ceilings and industrial cement columns give the restaurant a real SOMA feel and the playing of jazzy music makes the room lively. Enormous red lamp shades as chandeliers shine dim lights onto servers who are pacing around with trays of classic cocktails. ?On a sunny afternoon, the patio seating is full and loud with laughter. Our menu: Delicious! A colorful martini glass of tuna tartare was tasteful with thin crispy taro chips and fried calamari, fennel, and string beans was almost a meal itself. Onto our main dish-- fresh beet salad with vineagrette and a tender pot roast with creamy, buttery white mashed potatos, set into a dark, meat flavored sauce was a satisfying dinner. Luckily, my fiance and I shared the plate of salad and pot roast because with two appetizers that were a "must try", we barely had any room left in our stomachs to finish the last crumb of our pot roast, being that it was all you wanted to finish. I'd definitely suggest eating here again!

I had the panzanella salad with grilled salmon on top. ?It was the best salad I've had in the Townsend Street area in MONTHS. ?Maybe EVER. ?(Arugula, asparagus, cherry tomatoes, fresh chunks of crusty bread, a healthy portion of well-seasoned salmon, and a lemony vinaigrette...) Plus, only $12.50 for an entree salad with grilled salmon? ?Unbelievable, dude. ?I will never go to Momo's again.

Nice atmosphere! Awesome patio! Great drink options! and it's also near AT&T park. We came for drinks and appetizers. My co-worker swear ?their grilled-cheese is the best. We also ordered fries, calamari and chicken wings. It was all very tasty. Our server was in a bad mood and wasn't very attentive, but the gal who brought the food was super friendly. Definitely come by for happy hour or before/after a game!

I have been here after a ball game and somehow found a seat outside - it's a fun atmosphere, the beer specials are good, and the burgers are better and cheaper than what you'd find at AT&T Park. I've also been here for lunch with coworkers and everyone was pleased with their meals. ?The fish tacos are particularly good, though it's a pain in the ass having to make the tacos one by one by piling on ingredients at the table. Randy Johnson eats here periodically apparently, though I've never seen him. ?If it's good enough for a 5 time Cy Young winner, it's good enough for me.

Came here for happy hour last friday. Sat outside and it was kinda cold.. burrr... ordered the calamari and the margarita. calamari had a spicy sauce on top. that was yummy. but the calamari themselves needs more flavor. my margarita was super strong and i was pretty tipsy after. lol. i'm a lightweight, what can i say... one star off for the amount of time we had to wait before they took our order and served us and forgetting our silverware. lol. will be back here again to try some other things since it's in my hood.

I specifically come to Paragon because their Moscow Mule (Russian Standard Vodka + Ginger Beer) is so damn good! Have a Moscow Mule, split a few BBQ Chicken Pizzas among friends and then head off to a Giant's game! ...then thank me later :) Minus one star for inconsistent service and a lack of happy hour on game days. Sure, I understand you'll have patrons no matter what on game days but...c'mon, lighten up...Yelpers will appreciate it!

Amber wood, dark walls, booths and a good sized bar area that includes outdoor seating. ?It's a great place to go to for lunch , happy hour during baseball season ,or if you're down by SBC Park for just the hell of it. ? The regular dinner menu doesn't offer anything memorable, in fact it's likely to be overpriced for what you're getting. ?Stick to sitting at the bar and check out the cute bartenders, both guys and girls. The drinks are stiff and their mac&cheese, calamari, and mushroom cigars are delicious.

I mean to offer three stars with the highest of compliments! ?I am being this kind only because I am reminiscent of past service. ?I would have given 4 stars, except, in all of the years that I have come here, I have never eaten inside this place and the service has deteriorated in tha last few years to the point where I am waiting for new management to take it over. ? It usually starts with a long walk to Mission Bay with the pug Buddha, we circle behind the ball park and walk up 2nd street. ?Except this time around, there is a full fledge concert going on at the ball park. ?We saw RV's that came all the way from Modesto to catch this historic event. ? It's Kenny Chesney with LeAnn Rimes and every single redneck they can get to congregate in one place. ?I have to admit people watching is even more fun when rednecks or one of my family's get together are involved. ?Either crowd drawing is sure to push the limits one can handle in one afternoon while drinking mojitos. This time we thought we could test our limits by of people watching concert revelers and have a few drinks perched on the Paragon Patio. ?Thank goodness for the gift of music, alcohol and people. So we sit, wait for our waitress and she quickly takes our drink order. ?No problem. ? ?Our drinks show up, we place our order; it all goes down hill from here on. ?First we ordered a dozen oysters and the mushroom Cigars (a must have at this place). ?the oyster come out first, the cigars follow a good while later. ?Our waitress when placing the dish down did not accurately calculate the force x mass plus inertia formula properly or she simply had a lapse in judgment when she slams the plate and one of the cigars rolls off the heap and onto the not so clean table. ?Nonchalantly we say will feed it to the dog. ?Buddha is happy. Then we order a second round of drinks and that was the last we saw of our waitress. ?Our entrees showed up with the help of now a male waiter and debating whether ?choke on or burger with nothing to wash them down or to let our burgers get cold , we opted for the later as we waited for drinks. ?Needless to say, our waitress went on break and neglected to complete our service. I remember the days, when we would frequent this place on a sunny afternoon or early evening and sometime weather extreme temperatures outside (with the dog ) just so that little Buddha can have a decent dining experience with us and Paragon would bend over backwards to accommodate our experience. ? No longer does the dog even get a dog bowl, nor do the heat lamps turn on if they decide to close their massive garage door and trap the warmth inside. ?What has happened to what was once this great neighborhood fun spot?

Good appetizers here. This place is in my neighborhood so I come here every now and then. I've never had a "full-on" dinner here (i.e. ordering entrees), I always just order a few appetizers which we share along with some drinks. Even though we're just munching, we end up leaving full, and the bill is never that bad.. about 30 bucks a person for splitting a few plates and a drink or two. I like the tuna tartare and spicy calamari appetizer. I rather like the atmosphere too, the lighting is a bit on the darkside, but that's the way I like it.

Enjoyed this place, but the waitress was all 'tude. ?Came here when I first moved here, with my friend who also had recently moved to the city. ?We came for dinner. ?The place itself is really nice, I like the restaurant itself. So... ?we ordered a bunch of appetizers (or pupus). ?We had the tuna tartare, crab cakes, garlic fries, and mac'n'cheese. ?The garlic fries were delicious, as well as the mac'n'cheese. ?Hell, it was all pretty good! ?We ordered frou frou martinis (I had the ruby red cosmo), which were delicious. ?For dessert we shared the Paragon chipwich. ?Yum. ?Basically, gourmet ice cream sandwiches. ? Okay, so the food is good, nothing crazy, but good. ?The service was eh. ?Our waitress was cold, unfriendly, and I think pissed because we were little girls who can't throw down a huge meal and have multiple bottles of wine. Oh, and yes, things are overpriced here. ?Street parking was relatively easy. ?So really I'd give it 3.5 stars.

So this review should be about 3,5 stars. We have been to Paragon several times. When there isn't a baseball game, the place is usually empty. I wonder how it stays in business. However, it can be an enjoyable experience. The room looks impressive. The food is solid. The service is good. The prices are a little high for what you get. We went to dinner here last weekend. We ordered several different appetizers and drinks. I would suggest the mussels and the mac and cheese. Both were very good. We liked our waitress. Overall, we would still go back.

Stay away from this place. Food was okay, but the service left such a bad taste in my mouth that I couldn't enjoy it. The place really needs to get new staff. We waited 15 minute to have our order taken and when it did come we didn't have any silverware to use. When I notified our waitress, she just turned around and continued to clear tables. WTF right? I eventually had to take matters into my own hands and get it myself. Save your money for another place to eat because Paragon just isn't worth it.

For a pre-game beverage and snack, Paragon is tough to beat. ?Paragon has a great selection of ice cold draft beer. ?I didn't try the martinis but as soon as I saw one, i was tempted to make make the switch. ? With the drinks, we enjoyed the perfect compliment of saturated fats including some Pork Rinds (with a squeeze of lime and dipped in a vinegar based hot sauce which was not all that hot); Duck Fries.. french fries in a gooey mess of pulled pork like duck meat smothered with cheese and floating in duck fat/grease; and Calamari which included other misc vegs (onions and beans) and a chipotle sauce. Give Paragon a try if you are a serious fan of BEER, liquor, and bar food, and are looking for a pre-Giants game place to get it going. ?After getting in the zone, make it down the block and watch the Giants kick ass. I never had the lunch or real food at Paragon but for what I had, it was great.

I've had a mixed experience with the Paragon. One day my office ordered dinner takeout from there, and I enjoyed the pot roast (though a coworker was disappointed with the sea bass). More recently I went for an after-work drink and dinner with another coworker. The drink I got (basil lemonade) was delicious, but the food we ordered was quite unsatisfactory. The corn dogs were as plain as can be, and their famous grilled cheese was make with thick, stiff white bread, making it very hard to taste the cheese within.

I have been here a number of times... ?I would be inclined to rate this restaurant a 4 star, cause their food is tasty with a bit of uniqueness. ?Unfortunately my experience today knocks them own a star... ?truly I'd normally knock off 2 stars but I can't really bring myself to rate them a 2 star place given I truly like the place. So, we came here for lunch before the Giant's game - home opener, they were MOBBED. ?Our waiter sincerely tried, but there were some things that cannot go unnoticed. ?Our food took 45 minutes to arrive. ?The table next to us (who arrived 1/2 hour later than we did) got their food before us. ?When I politely inquired about the status of our entree, our waiter looked embarrassed, ran off, then brought us our meals -- clearly they'd been sitting under the heat lamp for a while, cause the fries tasted stale. ? Pete was drinking mojitos.... the first two were stellar but the third was clearly wrong. ?It wasn't even sweet, and tasted like straight rum with some mint thrown in the glass. ?He politely asked if they could re-do the drink cause clearly soda water and syrup were missing. ?Moments later someone else returned with the same drink stating that they'd added the soda water..... but it still wasn't very sweet. ?Pete then asked for some sugar. ?The waiter brought him two packs of sugar and it helped but I think that after all of the attempts to "doctor" the drink Pete simply lost interest. Needless to say, we were a bit perturbed by our experience there. ? So, we were running a bit late (given the delay in our food arrival) so we got the check. ?You'd think that they'd comp one of his mojitos given he barely drank 1/4 of the last drink, but NO.... ?we were charged for every little thing. ? I have to give them a bit of the benefit of the doubt, given it was opening day and they were bogged down. ?BUT, the reality is our waiter was pretty decent. ?It's just the little things that he could have done to save our experience that just weren't done that makes me feel okay with deducting stars.

Good, but rather underwhelming in this neighborhood. I went here for dinner just prior to a Giants game and this place was spilling over with patrons. I figured I was in for a treat with that kind of crowd waiting to get in. Never get your hopes up too high. We had a reservation so there was no waiting for a table. The service was a tad slow but I'll assume that's because every table was being used. Our servers were all very friendly. I ordered the pork rinds "app" which I believe they called "bites", thinking that a proper restaurant's take on this snack would be interesting. It was not. The food that was delivered to our table was, based on my experience, most likely from a $2 bag of pork rinds purchased at the local 7-11. To be fair, I don't really know if there's such a thing as a "quality" or "good" pork rind and they had the courtesy to remove them from the plastic bag and put them in a decorative fry-tin. Continuing on the pork rinds rant: they serve it with their "homemade hot sauce" (paraphrased) which as near as I could tell was nothing more than chili oil. Sorry, but the pork rind fiasco left a bad taste in my mouth.... pun... somewhat intended. My entree was a sweet pea ravioli which was good, but not great. And perhaps I'm prejudiced, but I just think when you're in South Beach and paying $20~ a plate for dinner, the food should be closer to great. I went 3 stars instead of 2 because the atmosphere was really good there, as attested to by the numerous baseball fans jammed around the bar. And I also tried a slice of my sister's BBQ chicken pizza which was pretty decent. I really don't feel compelled to say "eat here", but it's not like it should be avoided either. So really... I dunno. PS. Did I overuse the quotation marks in this review or what? Yeesh!

My friends and I have mixed reviews about Paragon. It's kind of a love-hate relationship. I enjoy the food there, some of them don't. Too bad for them cause they're missing out of the best grilled cheese sandwich. I go there mostly for lunch. I used to stick to the chicken sandwich until I discovered the grilled cheese sandwich. I know it's carb central but man! is it good. Grilled cheese sandwich with a side of tomato soup and a salad for around $10. This is no ordinary grilled cheese slapped between two slices of Wonderbread. No sir, this is gourmet cheese between...well, I don't know what kind of bread it is but let's just say it's good. It's kind of like an over-sized baguette I guess. Definitely one of my favorite lunches. Parking is convenient, the staff is friendly and the food is good (at least at lunchtime).

Came to Paragon Restaurant for a typical Friday night out. This restaurant is located near AT&T Park, and it was the opening of the Giant's game, so the street was packed with loud, screaming, baseball fans. (Just how I like a Friday night to be! :0)) Paragon introduces new American cooking which is somewhat familiar, simple, comfort food type, yet new. I tried the deviled eggs with sweet pickle relish. It was good, but just like a typical deviled egg. My friends that night ordered the duck fries with yukon potatoes, duck confit, and ?fontina cheese. Those were gone in seconds. I am on a low carb diet, so I didn't try any, but how fast that plate had gone empty tells it all. The meatballs w/ gravy was eaten fairly quickly as well. Maybe because 4 hungry drunken guys were waiting to eat anything that was placed in front of them. My piece of meatball rolled off the table right in front of me...going, going, going, HOME RUN! My favorite was my main dish, which was the fresh fish of the day. They had the bass that night. It was medium in texture, moist, flaky, and mild in flavor. It was lean and healthy with a side of sauteed spinach. Oh, to top of the meal, I had a shot of chilled Grey Goose! My vodka is a good compliment to possibly anything! :0)

Nice area near the ballpark. For the food, my burger was dry and over cooked. Oysters didn't taste too fresh and the service was mediocre. Maybe I went on a bad day.

I met Michael to discuss vague plans of traveling to Argentina... perhaps that might have primed me to set the bar a little high based on Argentine food standards. Paragon turned out only to be an ok dining experience. The food is pretty solid, pretty standard... the service is pretty good, the space is pretty nice, but nothing about it impress me in any real way. I had the pot roast... it's pretty good, exactly as a pot roast should taste. No surprises. Neither here nor there. Nice place to have a solid meal, but nothing more.

The Giants are back in season and I scored some great tickets to take a client to the game, the big decision was were to go for dinner being an evening game. I decided on Paragon after reading the many reviews about restaurants around AT&T Park and was not let down at all. First, we got there real early which helped and our server was very attentive to our needs through the meal and helped us with our selections which I found above par! We started with fresh oysters and a wonderful fresh dipping sauce. Yum! I had the salmon and my client had the hanger steak and both of our entrees were cooked to perfection and arrived right on time. We both got refills of our favorite local brews on tap. Dessert held some interesting choices as my client had never experienced a Irish Coffee which he enjoyed very much. So there you have it, great food, great service and great location near AT&T park!

Nothing like a bad experience to inspire one to finally create a Yelp account. Went here for lunch for the first time today. ?I can't complain about the food because we didn't stay long enough. ?I was looking forward to trying the grilled cheese with tomato soup, but frankly, we were driven out by the service. It's *terrible*. Lunch service should be fast. Most people going in for lunch are there during work hours. ?Instead, we stood waiting to get seated for five minutes. ?Four minutes in, someone actually acknowledged us by saying "I'll be with you in a second". ?We didn't even get seated. ?We said table for two, she handed us two menus and told us to find a seat in the lounge. We were served warm water in a jug. ?We waited at least another five minutes going through our menus. ?When a waitress came up to us with a pad, she asked us if we had a drink order. ?My companion said water was good for both of us, and that we were ready to order. ?She then walked away and went to another table. ?We sat there stunned with confused looks on our faces. ?We waited another five minutes with no one coming to take our food order, so we left. Was the place busy? ?No more than any other establishment at 12:00 on a Tuesday. ?Was it understaffed? ?I can't tell, but if it was, that's the fault of the management. ?There seemed to be at least three to four servers that I could see. We were late getting back from lunch due to such shoddy service. ?Save your time and money, find a more polite group of servers to go to.

We went on a Friday night and had a nice, while not spectacular time. The server, while semi-clueless, was charming and seemed to be in training or over-extended or something. For example, we had to ask for bread, and then it didn't arrive until the meal. But he was very friendly, and had a great attitude, so we were only slightly annoyed. The food was a solid four stars. I had the special: Opa. My boyfriend had the pot roast. He out-ordered me...his was better. My Opa was good, but the ratios seemed wrong...too much fish compared to everything else. Also, the restaurant could have been five degrees warmer. Upon walking in, I immediately asked the host for the warmest table he had. Which, unfortunately, led to us being seated near some group with a loud, hyper-sugared child. I'd go back if we were in the area, and if we were hungry, and if it was summer.

Standard, new American fare - upscale sports bar dining. Maybe it's more energetic around baseball season, but for a rainy Dec evening, it was just so-so. Food was pretty average: Duck fries - probably the most interesting of all the bites, but with the way they did it, the duck & fries just didn't come together. I wish the fries had more flavor Side dish - sweet potato & apple hash - this sounded interesting, but was pretty average Rigatoni - pretty standard rigatoni too I heard the pot roast was definitely worth trying. The interior is very pretty, with curtains that section off parts of the restaurant. It's close to AT&T park too, so I can see why Giants fans would like coming here.

I love this place. I work in SOMA, and this has been a happy hour staple for years now. It is one of the few places with outdoor seating, and has an upcale but upretentious atmosphere. I can relax here. They have an excellent selection of beers on tap and a modest but perfectly adequate wine list. I just realized I've never had a cocktail here, but I bet those are tasty. Their bar staff can be curt at times, but know their stuff. The food is a step above your average bar food in concept and quality. Featuring things like fries wth duck confit and fontina, steamed mussels with chorizo, wedge salads, quality mac-n-cheese, and pulled pork sliders on the bar menu. Lunch is solid, too, but don't spend too much money or you'll feel it wasn't worth it. It's never occured to me to eat dinner here, because it's a bar, and bars, with few exceptions, can be trusted for lunch and snacks, but not dinner.

Drinks are very good! Grilled cheese is excellent! Pass on the Burgers- out is season tomatoes, over cooked meat, meat quality questionable. Two stars- service is not timely! Nice but not service.

Had lunch here for the first time, yesterday. The lunch menu is small, and I struggled to find something that sounded good. ?We ordered the mushroom cigars and the mac n cheese for appetizers. The mac was super bland. I needed to ask for tabasco to make it worth the calories and fat. ?Cigars were tasty, hard to go wrong with anything fried with mushrooms! I had the grilled cheese and tomato soup. The soup was more like a tomato puree, it was tasty, tho. The grilled cheese was flavorless, again with the tobasco and it was okay. ?Hubby had a a great burger with tons of blue cheese and some garlic fries. His meal was very good. Brother had the fish tacos, thought they were "meh" (you have to assemble them yourself), stepmom had the quinoa which she liked but felt the glob of butter on top was unnecessary and took away from it being one of the only healthy options on the menu. Dad had the chicken/spinach salad and liked it a lot. Dad and brother seemed to enjoy the beer selections and they liked that the football games were on. This isn't a good place for kids - not much for them to choose from and it's a more adult vibe. My niece and nephew (12 and 8) didn't have much to choose from on the menu, the mac n cheese isn't kid mac, and neither is the grilled cheese. I'd come back for appetizers and a salad, or I'd like to try dinner. The decor is awesome - lots of reclaimed barn wood and fun chandeliers. It's fine for bar fare, not fine dining. Service was good. Weird thing was the line to get in when they opened - it was a game day so line was LONG. We had a reservation, but had to wait in line for over 20 minutes just to tell someone that. Seems like they should have asked the bouncer (yes, you read that right) at the door to say if you have a reservation, please enter to the left or something.

The harsh reality is that a restaurant that can't even cook a slab of fish right (which was the most expensive item on the menu) shouldn't be in business. But you don't have to take my word for it. ?Just look at all the empty seats and ask yourself why nobody eats here.

I expected so much more from this place. ?I came here for after work drinks and dinner and wasn't impressed. ?The bar area is large, but ill-equipped for a place to catch a game. ?There were maybe a few small ?LCD TVs (small enough that I had to squint) perched high up to watch the games. ?Although the selection of spirits was plentiful (they have a wide vodka selection), all the drinks were also overpriced. ?The bar staff was nice and attentive though. When my buddies came to meet me, we order some appetizers/dishes. ?I only really enjoyed the mini burgers/sliders. ?Other than that, everything else was either a little bland or a little too oily. ?I would much rather go to 21st Amendment two blocks away where I would get better food and service for a much lighter impact on my wallet. Overall, this place is just alright. ?Not good, not bad, just alright.

In my neighborhood there are a lot of spendy place that are a NOT good bang for your buck. Paragon, unfortunately, is yet another spendy mediocre restaurant. Definitely better than MoMos, on par with Acme ChopHouse. I'll go here to eat by myself at the bar when I'm home late and too tired to cook. The pot roast is respectable and hits the spot when you're tired. The bar is not a pick up scene and I don't feel self-conscious eating here alone. Not much more to say.

I've been twice now--one lunch & one dinner, so I have perspective. Dinner a while back w/bf and fam = fish = standard fare, nothing special. ?Slow service. ?Nice atmosphere was saving grace that night. Lunch today w/7 co-workers = quinoa = BORING. ?$15 for a lunch plate, but I would have been happier with a $6-8 lunch entree from any variety of chinese or thai restaurants. ?(Luckily the bill was on the boss.) ?The flavor was just so mushroomy and I didn't taste the truffle oil. ?Shroom, shroom, shroom--I only ate about half b/c I was simply bored. ?The good part was an appetizer we shared: ?crispy calamari ($8.50), because it wasn't just calamari, but it had something I've never tasted before: ?deep fried fennel! ?Pretty cool. ?That's actually the only reason they're getting 3 stars. ?Service was incredibly slow. ?To top it off, everyone received their food about 5 minutes before I did, which is always awkward. It was pretty cold inside on both occasions--so bring a sweater, girls!

It's hard to do a typical review of Paragon because I went here for my husband's company party, and they rented the entire restaurant. I can say that their food was all delicious. We enjoyed bell pepper & chicken skewers, mouthwatering mini-burgers, spicy crab cakes, grilled steak skewers, mushroom cigars, and rich mini-cupcakes. Every bite was amazing. With the tab on the company, the bar was flowing well. The bartenders were a lot of fun and good at keeping your glass full. The atmosphere was also cool; love the loft-feel and the giant mirror over the bar. I'd like to go back and enjoy a full meal!

Went here and partook in their bar menu. Personally it was more of a quick come and go to catch a friend than to see out this place, but overall I was pleasantly pleased with everything. The place was a bit crowded, especially since it was during the week. We were able to find a spot in the area where the patio is and after some maneuvering, we were able to be seated. That night I was graving the need for a decent burger and a glass of wine. For me there is something about having a glass of wine with a well done burger that makes me satisfied. Both my burger and my glass of wine satisfied my craving. I favored my wine more than my burger, but overall it was ok. I would say the services was lagging a bit but it didn't bother me too much. I wouldn't mind coming back and trying some of their other entrees.

The garlic fries were good, not too garlicky. Friends had mussels, calamaris, and halibuts. Those were good too. I had their cheese burger in med. well, but it came out to be still very red.

I don't mind coming here for a business lunch, but I won't recommend it to people who like quality food. Paragon has recently remodeled and is in a classy setting -- which means for the same hamburger it will charge double. The appetizers are nice, especially the GARLIC FRIES and the deep fried portabella mushroom roll. ?(Yum!) ?Main dishes are alright -- no surprises, no disappointments. The restaurant is clean and quiet, making it a nice place for small groups or business talking.

For the price you pay, Paragon should be a lot better. ?First of all, they only have 2 real appetizers, something called a mushroom cigar, which is pretty good, and fried calamari. ?Similar to my review of 21st Amendment, Paragon puts more fried veggies in their calamari than actual calamari. ?The calamari is also pretty greasy and they put some uber-fattening aioli crap on top. ?Today, my hamburger sucked. ?It was overcooked and much smaller than the bun it was on. ?The sliced tomato was green and had a piece of the core in it. ?I hate that. ?The roast beef sandwich I had last time was very over cooked and something was funny about the Thyme - jus. ?My co-worker ordered the roast beef sandwich today and it was also over-cooked. ?The fries, however, are usually pretty good. ?The service is always slow no matter how busy the place is. ?Disappointing to say the least. Update: ?The grilled cheese sandwich is really good!

The Paragon seems to be a sore spot with fellow Yelpers; every other review I read was negative, therefore it is my duty to give it a good review as it is, at present, my favorite neighborhood restaurant. It's around the corner from my place so it is a great place to go for a good nosh when I'm not cooking and I have never had bad meal or drink. ?For starters, you must go there when the cute and very Irish bartender Ken Casey is slinging drinks, he'll hook you up, and order the classic cocktails, not the weird girlie crap, like that Jalapeno-peach thing that will burn another hole in your ass. Foodwise, the pot roast is the best this side of my grandma's. Executive Chef Spencer O'Mera (another fetching Irish dude) slow cooks it the old-fashioned way and serves it with a side of tender cooked baby carrots and haricot verts and very silky, yet filling mashed potatoes. Spencer is quite adept at cooking red meat in general and is very engaging; he always hangs around after his shift to have a drink at the bar with the regulars. Other favorites of mine are their Caesar salad (not like Zuni's but not bad) the Calamari (sexy-spicy) and the Chip-Wich, a clever chocolate-chip cookie ice cream sandwich made with fragrant house made vanilla bean ice cream. The service staff is accommodating and nice, the women servers may not smile much, but they get the job done. ?The bartenders are among the coolest in the City, very nice and chatty but will not hesitate to throw out drunk yuppies who get disruptive. ?I've met some interesting folks there, from the two inebriated married guys who insisted on buying my dinner because they thought I was beautiful to the equally generous millionaire British philanthropist who has a comet named after him (it's true; I Googled him). ?What a gentleman! Give Paragon another try, it's a cool place. ?Just stay away during baseball season!

Paragon used to be one of my favorite places to go for many reasons: you could always get a reservation on Open Table, it's large and spacious, good for groups, and is reasonably priced (about $20/entree). It's a block from the ballpark so it's great for a drink and fried calamari before the game but other than that, not an area I frequent. My friend and I were going to the Cirque Du Soleil show, so I thought Paragon would be a great selection pre-show and close to our destination. I was happy to see that most of my favorites were still on the menu. We started off with half a dozen oysters and tuna tartare. The tuna had good acid from the lime and spice from the jalapeno. We opted for something lighter so did not have the fried calamari but that is one of their specialties. Not only is it a large platter of rings and tentacles but it comes with fried vegetables and lemons which adds a nice twist. Hands down, best caesar salad in SF! Small and light crispy croutons, perfectly dressed, and topped with fresh anchovies - yumms. ?We shared the papardelle with lamb and the rib eye steak. Both were really good but we would have preferred the fries on the side as the were a bit soggy when they arrived underneath the steak. I remember service being fairly good before but I was a little disappointed this time. Two major mistakes they made: 1) I had to remind the waitress about our wine after our appetizers 2) our entrees came while we were still working on the salad - big no-no! I would definitely want to go back to Paragon but might write a small note to the GM about the service before I do.

OMG. ?i really wanted to love this place. ?i really did. i was so happy to go out for dinner and drinks after a long week. ?my friend and i made it out here because it's close to our place. ?mind you it was about 8:40ish when we arrived. so we decided to start off with a couple of bellinis, a wedge salad and the calamari. ?the bellini was ok, but my friend's glass was chipped so we had to get that fixed. ?new bellini and i got a mojito. ?the wedge salad was good. ?the calamari was in dire need of some salt. ?i'm not a fan of sauce drizzled on calamari either, but that's a personal preference. our waiter comes back after about 20 minutes to take our order. ?my friend got the polenta and i got the salmon. ?it took a good 35 minutes or more to get our food. ?(it may have been because the chef was walking around saying hello to his peoples, rather than handling his line though) ?the polenta was cold. ?my salmon was crazy dry. ?no type of sauce provided. ? after about another 20 minutes we ordered the chipwich. ?a basic ice cream sandwich with a chocolate dipping sauce. ?like really...how long does it take to stick two ice cream sandwich bars in a freaking bowl. ?my friend got up to cancel the dessert and get the check. so after we cancel the chipwich it arrives with our check. ?our waiter apologizes for the wait and comps dessert and drinks. ?my receipt read 10:24pm. ? really?!? ?yes it was great they took care of the drinks and dessert, but crappy service and not so hot food really didn't make up for it. ?hence....my sad one star. ? i tried to love paragon....it just didn't want my love.

The fried calamari/green beans were soooo deliciously spicy. The beer was a bit expensive, but that's to be expected so close to the ball park on a Friday night. It was a game night when I went, so I'm not sure if it always gets as annoyingly crowded with rowdy people normally--would venture to say no, but not sure.

Oh my god, that was good! I went to Paragon once or twice before, many years ago, and wasn't too impressed. This time, however, I was completely satisfied! Not many vegetarian entree options (just 2 that I noticed), but since I was in the mood for grilled cheese and tomato soup anyway, that was fine with me. The grilled cheese came on thick slices of yummy bread, and contained 2 kinds of cheese, not sure what kinds exactly ?- one white and one yellow - but delicious. The cup of tomato soup was smaller than I had hoped (I had expected a full bowl) but fresh and flavorful. Perfect for dipping! This dish also came with fresh greens tossed with oil and salt/pepper, which I mixed with the other dish that I ordered, the beet salad. This came with red and golden beets, pomegranate seeds and fresh basil. Totally tantalizing for my taste buds! My honey had the roasted chicken, which came with sauteed spinach with garlic and mac n cheese. He loved his meal as well, and even let me have half of his scrumptious mac n cheese - which was perfectly browned on top, and actually cheesy instead of just creamy (always a bummer at many other restaurants) in an individual tall ramekan. I love that both of our meals were complete unto themselves - my grilled cheese/soup/salad greens combo, and his chicken/sauteed spinach/mac n cheese combo. I wish that more restaurants would do this. The service was friendly and efficient, we were greeted and seated quickly, our questions answered sufficiently, our water and ice tea/more ice/more lemon always refilled quickly, and the server checking with us to make sure we were satisfied with our meals. The ambiance was warm and friendly, and not too loud. A 5 star meal, which was the perfect preview for our date for Cirque du Soleil later that night. :)

Went in to check out the remodel... Looks more like a New York or Chicago gastropub now. Tile walls, wood wherever you can fit it, chalkboards, and creative lighting fixtures. Not sure if I'm in love with it yet because the old style felt more comfortable and neighborhoody, but I'm sure the new style will grow on me BECAUSE the food is so good!! The duck fries are so worth the calories, the mushroom cigars will keep you going back, the salads are fantastically fresh, and the grilled cheese will rock your world. Their wine list was also fairly impressive and extensive. ?Didn't ask for a cocktail list but I will next time... that's what this neighborhood is lacking... Looking forward to going back near a Giants game to see how it all holds up. ?So far, so delicious!

Embarked on a Paragon adventure last night with friends and were rewarded with tasty well priced food. The pork loin is to die for, as are the drinks. The Mojito was a sledgehammer of alchy-that made my teeth ache. We all were well and truly lit by the time we exited-isn't that the end game of any successful night out with friends? Most disappointing was the service...we went through THREE wait staff. Our first waiter just up and left us! Also the crowd is a mix of ball park plebes and (shiver) some strange guy who thought his handle bar moustache was all the rage. ?Most of my dinner I kept sneaking furtive glances and was heartily reminded of Daniel Day Lewis in "Gangs of New York"...Some simpering non-locals all made up the strange crowd. Highlight of the eve was meeting Spencer the exec chef who was quite yummy! (slurp-slurp)

I don't understand this place at all. It's got a kick-ass location right next to the Ballpark, a sunny, outdoor seating area, yet the opening hours are as random as flyballs landing in the water. Let me give you an example... 4pm, sunny Sunday, about 40 people scattered throughout the place. We order a round of margaritas and are told that they were not only our first, but our last, as the place was closing. Not only were we ready to settle and while the afternoon away, the other 38 guests found there tables abruptly cleared and promptly shooed onwards. This also happened on a Friday night around 10pm, too. Why? Which leads me to theorise that Paragon doesn't really need the business. Which might explain the average food and service and random opening hours policy. But turning away the ever-expanding South Beach population makes no sense to me at all. Lift your game, Paragon!

I have eaten and "drunk" at paragon no less than 100 times over the years. ?Since we are Giants season ticket holders, I visit this place before most every game (and after most as well). ?Best mojitos, best bloody marys, great service and bartenders. Outdoor is fun if its nice. ?Decor is beautiful, industrial modern. ? The main menu is good, but i typically get light fare before or after an event. ?As others have mentioned, the grilled cheese and tomato soup rule. ?Burgers are good.

Great location near the ball park, but an average restaurant and not so great food. Starters: Calamari. ?No flavor/bland. ?Enough said. Entree: Chicken with mac and cheese. ?The mac and cheese definitely felt on the heavier side. ?It was good, but not for long (although I did end up eating it all). ?The chicken was ok, but not that enjoyable. ?It had a light taste to it, but that's all I can say about it. Dessert: It was like a cookie sandwich ice cream. ?There was a wrapper. ?Did they just buy this from a store? ?I couldn't tell. Service: Ok. ?She didn't know the specials and had to rely on her piece of paper which she didn't have when she got to our table. Overall experience: good company but less than ordinary food. 2.5 stars from me.

Food is good. We tend to go there and experience sub-standard service, but i've been assured multiple times that the service is generally pretty good. Usually dead, lame crowd, but great for a quiet, upscale bite. Random note: we took half the company here for lunch to announce that we'd laid off the other half. The high quality of the lunch experience definitely dampened the blow, although it was still a very awkward lunch.

This spot has been a SOMA staple around the South Park/Ball Park area for me for a while. When I worked in the area several years ago, Paragon was a regular "business lunch" location and as they also have a nice semi-private dining area in the back did a few small events/dinners there as well. You may ask why I've not reviewed Paragon before if it's such a regular spot. Frankly hadn't really thought of it until having gone there last night with a posse of social-media-saturated pals ... and of course as a result realized I"d never spoken up ... so... As you can see by my star rating, I'm a fan of the place. It's not necessarily due to superlative food or service, but more that other factors - such as great location and nice atmosphere - play in heavily. Also, I cannot recall a time I did not enjoy the company in which I spent my time at Paragon - which may not be a function of the place, per se, but it certainly gives the spot a warm corner booth in my heart. With that, I'll break down my overall rating in more detail: Service: 2/3 As a rule, it's rather spotty service here. Took forever to get our drinks and the server didn't pass by often enough to even catch her eye as folks arrived for our medium-sized (about 8 folks in all) group. We had the foresight to bulk order food & drinks as she passed us. To be fair, the bar area was pretty packed and she seemed to be the only server handing a sizable number of tables, which certainly impacts ability to deliver stuff to tables and the like. And when she was at our table she was lovely, friendly and had some good menu recommendations. Also when it came to sorting out the bill, she handled it quickly (of course one of our posse had done an incredible job of sorting it out and all!) Food: 3/3.5 The food's nothing to write home about, but it's not bad. I'd call the fare at Paragon a good solid choice where you know you'll get a reliably good meal with some regular items on the menu that are great. I started with the heirloom tomato salad, which included arugula (yum!), goat chese (yum) and watermelon. Now normally all would be good with this, but it's a bit late in tomato season, really, and certainly long past crisp watermelon days. The result was a mediocre (saved by arugula) salad for me. ?Then I went to my old stand-by. The burger. Medium rare (on the rare side) with swiss. Comes with garlic fries. Need I say more? :) Atmosphere: 4 I like a boisterous spot, and Paragon generally delivers on this. On this particular night there was a large, private group filling the inside bar area. ?My particular posse sat at the long bench table just inside the roll up door to the patio. It was a bit chilly and could make do with a bit more heat lampage ... but overall quite nice. The company in which I was there: This was, of course, the best of the entire evening. This was a group of women - almost all of whom I know almost exclusively on-line. And of those, some of them are very very new friends. So this was a gathering of that very wonderful social media sort where people who know each other digitally get a chance to augment the virtual reality with some good, old-fashioned, in person pal time. It was lovely.

If you're going to Paragon for a meal it is delicious but pricey! I have never been let down by their food. Some of the waitresses can be a tad bit bitchy so the service has never been great but they have the best mac and cheese I think i've ever had, which is a pretty bold statement. If you're going to Paragon for drinks after work DO NOT open a tab or they will put other peoples appetizers and drinks on it. They are REEEEAALLLY bad about figuring out what you ordered and it's not worth the drama of figuring it out. I and many others have had this happen on numerous occasions and we have learned our lesson the hard way many, many a time. By now they owe me at least a free dinner for two but it'll never happen... partially my bad for getting too drunk there and not paying attention but don't say I didn't warn you.

This review is based only on their happy hour. All I can say is if you love bloody marys, then you will love Paragon's Bloody Martini's. Our bartender Pete was super friendly, made stiff drinks (yay) and turned me on to the Bloody Martini. It is not on the menu anymore, but they still make them (so it's kind of on the down low) haha. What makes these sooooo incredibly tasty is they are a little spicy and the salt on the rim includes some different spices as well. They garnish it off with an olive and jalapeno as well :) SO GOOD!

The food here takes a long while when there's the slightest crowd, but it's well worth it when you finally get it. Before games it's nice to grab a drink, fries and or their mac'n'cheese which was really good the past couple of times I had it. The place isn't very casual and it seems like you're expected to be on your best behavior there for dinner. Definitly worth going trying, but it wouldn't be my first option with Bacar & Tres Agaves nearby.

If you live super close to Paragon like I do, it's great to go and grab dinner. We went on a night that was super empty so we got really fast service. Our server was really nice--maybe because she wasn't stressed. The food was really rich. We had the calamari which was soo good because there were green beans and onions (?) in it too. WARNING: The calamari comes with a creamy spicy sauce all over it. Delicious but if I had known I would have gotten it on the side. ?We also got the chicken with mac and cheese (so bomb but really heavy--the chicken was practically fried and the mac and cheese was so creamy I could only have a couple of bites) and the vegetable pot pie (tasty--like french onion soup with vegetables and a little pastry). If you can't get in anywhere else it's not bad!

We heard from the training group before us that this was the place to be. ?So we went to check out their favorite spot. Eh. The drinks were really good. ?I had the Earl Grey Long Island and my buddies had the Mojitos. ?We all split a wedge salad, mac and cheese, grilled cheese and some garlic fries (yes, I know. ?carb city.). ?Don't get me wrong the food was really, really good and the drinks were good too, but the place is small, has a very limited menu and our waiter started out the night kind of ignoring us. ?I might go back again for the grilled cheese but I'm not going to plan my week around it.

I went here for a late b-day dinner. Given it was a Tuesday evening so of course it wasn't that crowded, but I must say all the wait staff and host were very attentive! ?=) ? I also truely did enjoy the food. We had the spicy crab cake to begin with and then I had the Mahi Mahi. ?We ended with the apple pear crisp which was a delcious ending. ? True the ambiance might be a little lacking and unimaginative but it is a nice place to spend a relaxing evening.

Thanks to some of my new coworkers I got to try out this delicious place on the first day at my new job. It's just a few steps from our door, so I know I will be going back again. The menu had a lot of delicious options: grilled cheese, BBQ chicken sandwich, a variety of salads, fish tacos, macaroni and cheese, etc. I guess you would call it American food. At the recommendation of my fellow diners, I went with the grilled cheese. It came with tomato soup and a garden salad. It was delicious. The combo was perfect. The sandwich was cheesy and buttery; the salad was light and refreshing; and the soup was thick with a ton of flavor. My mouth is watering just thinking about it. I can't wait to go back to this place. Maybe I'll try something new, or maybe I'll just have the grilled cheese again.

Love the Paragon, great people, great food and drinks, and perfect location! ?They have a nice patio that opens up when it's nice out, and a tv in the bar. ?During big events, they'll have extra tvs. ?I watched game 5 of the World Series there, it was a blast! The bartenders and staff are great! ? I love their grilled cheese and tomato soup, and they have great macaroni and cheese. They've got several good brews on tap, including a nice organic one. ?They also have a local maybec wine, which I personally love! ? I haven't had any happy hour eats, but the menu looks great, and I'll definitely try it soon. Absolutely worth a visit, whether just for a drink after work or before a game, or for a full dinner. ?They also have banquet rooms, would be a good place for that!

Visited 4/20 ?I agree with Juli F. - get the mushroom cigars, basically taquitos with a nice garlic aioli. Everything else was pretty standard fare - my burger with way too many fries, and her meatball sandwich, which would probably be upstaged by Quizno's. Fabulous drinks prepared by the fabulous Spencer behind the bar.

Best grilled cheese sandwich! (which i am craving for right now) it comes with a salad and a tomato soup and is enough for two people to share for lunch. you might wonder why would you order grilled cheese sandwich at paragon but it is one of the best. layers of melted cheddar between 2 slices of slightly toasted bread with just the right amount of crunchiness.. yummmmmm garlic fries. skinny & crispy. Caesar salad with fried calamari.. i wasn't feeling this one so much... maybe if they were separated, it'd be good. and finally to complete the meal, mango ginger soda :)

Restaurant was nice and somewhat sophisticated for a bar. Food had nice presentation. We had the Hanger Steak and Paragon Burger. Hanger steak was cooked to order, very juicy but lacked in the flavor section. The "Port wine reduction" sauce wasn't reduced by much and did not enhance the flavor. The Paragon burger had good seasoning but was kind of dry for med-rare burger, it was actually more like med-well... Nice spot for a quick bite, but don't be fooled by their "Sophisticated" Menu, its still only worth 3 stars.

Stopped by before Giants game for beer and grub. ? Service was decent. Though our server offered to grab some chairs for late comers who joined our table but then never followed through on actually getting them, one of our friends was standing for half an hour while waiting for us to finish our meals. Beer selection is great, 8 or so beer on tap and all worthwhile brews. They serve mainstream local micro-brews, but seem to prefer unusual brews from those breweries. ? Mushroom Cigars were excellent, the aioli they are served with is fluffy and light tasting, and the mushroom cigars are both inventive, fun, and bursting with flavor. Duck fries sounded awesome, but were definitely the letdown, and turning point of the meal. ?The gravy they were swrved with tasted like insta-gravy from a pouch. ?The duck confit was not as tender as I would expect and there was not enough of it to really enjoy with the fries. For our meal my friend and I ordered blue cheese burgers. ?The fries were good, and included with the burger, always nice. ?The blue cheese they used though was too strong and there wasn;t enough of it. ?While I love a great bleu, on a burger, I'd rather a creamier, milder blue cheese. Because it was so strong it seemed like every other bite would be overwhelmed with blue cheese taste and then the next would have almost nothing. ? Overall ok meal, but I would try other restaurants in the area

I went to Paragon last night and the food and service was excellent. Our server Erin was very helpful and friendly and made menu suggestions based on my Gluten allergy. I had the Basil Lemonade and my boyfriend had the Mojito, both very good. For Dinner I had the pot roast it was served with mashed potatoes and a few veggies, the portions were really generous and it was cooked perfectly. My other half got the sausage entree. This dish was served on cabbage with a mustard sauce, I wouldn't have normally ordered that item but I tried it and it was actually a very elegant recipe with a nice presentation. We had the lemon sorbet for dessert and it was really tart which was a nice balance to our sweet drinks. The atmosphere was lively and bright but not too crowded for a Thursday Night. I'll definitely come here again.

I went here last night with 2 of my friends and thought it was pretty decent. It's convenient for me because I live on 2nd and Townsend but had never been here before - finally decided to give it a try because I had no food in my apartment. I got the grilled cheese sandwich with tomatoes and avocado in it along with a side of mac n cheese. The mac n cheese was good, but not great. It tasted a little bit hard and wasn't as cheesy and melt-in-your-mouth status as I would have liked it to be. However, the bread crumbs on top were pretty tasty. The grilled cheese sandwich meal also came with tomato soup and a side salad - all for only $9.50. I think it it's an amazing deal for the price you pay for it. However, the soup was a little cold and the bread that the sandwich came on was super thick, making it a little bit hard to eat. Our service was excellent - the waitress was beyond nice, and she was super quick with our requests. (heating the soup up more, bringing extra plates, water, etc.) Would I go back again? Mmmm... probably not, but it's right next door to me and if I felt like getting a quick bite, it's a great spot. Heard happy hour is really great here too - bar menu looks good. Till next time, Paragon!

I always used to here before starting my shift at AT&T park(where I do/did food service). It's really good food. It's a bit different than the crowd I am used to. This is definitely the type of place my b/f would take me to, since he'd never be down going to the Castro, SoMa, and both of us hate the TL. I always have the duck confit. I gotta say, when the Giants were in the playoffs, this was my meal. I wanted to try some of their drinks(namely mojitos/tropical drinks). But I couldn't due to my work shift. The service is friendly, the atmosphere is part tourist/part the ultra modern edge of SoMa. You get a lot of sports fans here. I can't wait to eat here again, once spring comes around.

I've been here twice and both times, very mediocre food at best. ?The only pluses are that Its a nicely designed space, and located close to some of the venues in the south beach area such as AT&T park. ?The waitress was also polite and the service was good. The food however is something else... ?The chicken skewer dish I tried was overdone, dry, leathery, and boring, the rice that accompanied it seemed to have some residual liquid in it (ew), and the creme brulee was pasty and unpalatable.. ok, the salad was the only saving grace. ?These are really really basic dishes, and nothing out of the ordinary and one has to really make an effort or be exceptionally uncaring about quality to screw it up. I would say that there are better choices in this area if you are open to a different genre of food. ?If you are on a date or taking out important business associates avoid at all costs as you are likely to disappoint.

Two words: Cockroach Salad. Paragon's food isn't that great to begin with, but having an extra guest at the table really made me feel ill. Worse, it was under that last bit of salad leaf, hiding for it's life. Yes, it was still alive. At least, it wasn't *my* salad. It was the new employee (who we were buying lunch for) that got it. Hadn't been here in about a year, and it's going to be a lot longer before I go back. Noise level was pretty high as well, had trouble hearing our waitress.

I'm so frustrated with this place! I should have waited to review because I'm still so heated after going to lunch. I only have an hour for lunch so you think businesses close by would think to get people in & out for lunch time. Not the case here. Okay, so yes the place is nice, it has some nice outdoor seating, and the food wasn't bad. BUT, the service stank. It's unbelievably slow. So if you are here to chat it up with good friends, then this isn't a bad place. The people are friendly. However, I asked for my check when I got my food (mind you it took almost half an hour to get my food) and then it took another 10 minutes to finally get a check that wasn't even my bill! The lady got me my check a few minutes after that. But the damage was done. I don't think I would ever go back because I was so fed up with waiting. If you want food that's just as good, but quicker and cheaper, ?I recommend primo patio a block or so down. They have the same flavors. My boyfriend and I had the hamhock and white bean soup, chicken skewers, and fish tacos at Paragon. The soup was so so. The chicken skewers tasted just like Primo's, it just has a better presentation at Paragon. The fish tacos weren't bad really. I really liked the lime cilantro sour cream that came on the side. Again if you aren't on a schedule this place is fine, but expect to wait.

I find it on the bit expensive side though, (keep in mind I'm a broke college student), probably because its proximity to the ball park. ?

Paragon is a great place to enjoy a drink and decent food on a beautiful San Francisco day, but it's not a restaurant worth going out of your way for. ?The food is consistently good -- they have a solid burger, a tasty grilled cheese sandwich with tomato soup & green salad, a very good grilled salmon caesar salad, and I find their fish preparations are often much better than one would expect, with flavorful sauces that don't overpower the fish. ?But they are so slow! ?Even when the place isn't crowded, they take forever to get the food out. ?I have never had a lunch here take less than 90 minutes or a dinner less than 2 hours. ? Better thought of as a nice bar with better-than-average food.

At the behest of a friend with whom I was seeing a ball game, I begrudgingly decided to eat here again. ?Despite all the negative reviews and the management's alleged show of concern, the service has not improved and in fact has gotten worse. ? We were here at around 3pm and had a lot of time to kill before a Giants 7pm evening game. ?Not surprisingly it took at least 5 minutes before we were even acknowledged by the hostess, another 10 minutes before we were given menus, another 10 before our order was taken, another 30 for the food to come out, and no silverware on the table. ?Then the snotty manager comes over to say, "Sorry for the wait, we're slammed, it's a game day." ?Seriously, dickhead? ?Four hours before the game with only 6 tables occupied in the entire place?

GARBAGE!!!! This place sucks. ?The restaurant was completely empty and instead of sitting us at a wood table with real chairs and a white table cloth, they put 4 of us at a table for 2 in plastic seats next to the gears of the glass roll up door that act as a window. ?We were freezing the entire time. ?When asked if we could sit at a more formal table they said that they where reserved. ?(When we left many where still empty.) When I went to the restroom there was 2" of water on the floor and no one seemed to be doing anything about it (except tip-toeing thru it). When our meal came we asked for salt and pepper. This took so long to come that when it did, we had to send the mac and cheese back to get re heated. The only reason to go here is for a good laugh at a pathetic excuse for a restaurant in a town known for great dining.

What's great about Paragon is that it's close. ?Service here is below average, but people come for the drinks not the total package. ?The food is good, but better if you're there after work for a glass of vino or a vodka-tonic. ?I think this place stays in business because there are a lot of startups with office space nearby, plenty of people living in the new SOMA condo buildings and not too many after work spots that aren't stadium-focused sports bars. ?District is down the street and much better on the net, but Paragon is easy and never too crowded. ?

Sort of an overpriced sports bar located near AT&T Park. The waitress was a flirt, but it took her ten minutes to serve us a beer. Granted, when she was around, she was fawning, but how long does it take to pour? Needless to say, we were late to the game, and none too happy about it.

We came here after a recent Giants game for some cocktails and appetizers and came away very satisfied. First off, our server was extremely attentive, even as the place got more and more packed and she had to fight her way through the crowd to get to our table. The food was delicious - we had some steamed mussels that were some of the best I've ever eaten and a salad (I forget what kind) that was great as well. They also have some kind of spicy Thai mojito that is perfect for people like me who drink mojitos all the time and want something new. I don't know if I would make a special trip to this part of town just to go to Paragon, but I would definitely come here after a Giants game again.

Made reservation for 6:00 through http://www.opentable.com for a Friday night before heading to the Giants game. We arrived a couple of minutes before six & were seated right away. The place was super busy ,due to the choice weather,Friday night & the game only an hour away,but the serivce was very attentive. The four of us shared the following. Calimari & Mushroom Cigars as appitizers. The calimari was OK,a little under done(not quite crispy enough),but the deep fried onion & bell pepper mixed in it were excellent . The mushroom appitizer consisted of a mushroom paste rolled in philo dough & were desent,but more of a novelty. The roasted chicken was seasoned nicely with the skin intact,served over a bed of spinach & super juicy , the best entree of the night. It was searved with mac & cheese.Three or four types of cheese,tasty but a little too rich for my liking. The rest of us had the cheese burges with blue cheese & they were excellent,cooked with just a pink center,perfect. A couple of adult bevrages all around,good sized tip $200.00 total. Off to watch the Giants woop on the Cardinals.

Now I have to admit, I only go to this restaurant out of convenience, since it's near my school but it's actually pretty good. ?The house wine is decent, though everything else on the wine list is overpriced (uhh... Estancia for $11? ?Mondavi for $13?). ?The appetizers are actually really nice here. ?I've had the tuna, crab cakes, and grilled cheese with tomato soup. ?SO GOOD. ?I love the salads these dishes come with. ?Everything is crisp and fresh. ?Plus, the cute bartenders and servers don't hurt.

The best pot roast I've ever had. ?It is a strong contender against my mom's! ?GREAT BBQ night on Wednesday or Thursday (can't remember) - but everything was smoked and grilled to perfection! ?Real BBQ! ?The ribs I had just fell off the bone. ?The staff is a lil' stand-offish every time I've been there-hence the 4 star rating. ?The servers have known nothing about their wine selection, and when picking a bottle or glass I felt like I was shooting in the dark. ?No one is super friendly. ?My biggest bone to pick was how the servers threw around menus. ?I always get seated against the wood paneling, and every time a menu was thrown under their work station I would hear it and feel it vibrate. ?SO ANNOYING! ?The location is awesome and I have never had a problem finding parking...even on game nights.

My sister took me here for my birthday after seeing 'Totem'. It was a nice place, very soothing and relaxing. We ordered crispy pig ears and their mushroom cigars. Both were absolutely delicious, and I could have simply eaten those as my meal. We followed it by the grilled cheese and soup, which was SOOO tasty. (Don't bother getting the bacon on it, because it'll be mushy and won't add much flavor to the sandwich.) The soup was a improved spaghetti-o sauce and was perfect for dipping the grilled cheese in. The side salad was over-dressed and was completely unnecessary. Drinks were good, and the server was nice. It was a little hard to get her attention at times, but overall it was good service. My only complaint is/was dessert. I ordered the lemon cheesecake. It came and was...disappointing to say the least. It was lumpy and flavorless. The crust was over-seasoned, the fruit was bland. I've made better cheesecakes. I've bought better frozen cheesecakes from Costco. I ate a couple of bites, and then once we got the waitresses attention and asked for the check, I let her know what was wrong with it. She offered another dessert, but I declined. Overall, it was a bit pricey to really go on a regular basis and I wouldn't order dessert again. It's a nice 'special occasion' place to go and eat at. I'm glad I got the experience, and can I now say that I've eaten pigs' ears and I found something with mushrooms in it that I enjoy. :)

I like the look of this restaurant and the resident building it's attached to. The food is delicious...let me say it again...delicious. I have had the burger with garlic fries which was a pretty decent size for a burger and fries. Wait wait wait...back it up. Every time I've come here, I have had their mushroom "cigars." OMG! MUSHROOM cigars and they taste like my mom's lumpia...yes, I'm Filipino, and yes I love lumpia. But you can't make lumpia without meat. Well, you can, but it's not that great..that make-you-want-to-get-eight-more-servings great. So, these "cigars" taste so good and you just cannot believe that they are just mushrooms. Moving on, I've also had their grilled cheese and it was the best (I was about to write "one of the best") grilled cheese sandwiches I have ever had. Crunchy and soft and melty in all the right places. The tomato soup or sauce was good to dip it in too. The salad was salad. MmMmmm... The service wasn't bad, but I felt weird about the servers a few times. My bill got mixed up with another tables bill and things like that, but whatev. The food was great and it's in a nice place.

We recently spent a not-so-happy happy hour at Paragon with some co-workers. The service was slow and their mojitos tasted more like watered down soda water than anything else. I guess we should have been warned when the waitress showed up fifteen minutes after we sat down with drinks for the party that was sitting at our table before us; turns out those guys were smarter than we were.

a grilled cheese sandwich with ham, served with tomato soup and salad was just what my poor empty stomach needed to help settle all those champagne bubbles i had been slurping up down the street. since it was the warmest weekend in 2008, we opted to dine on the patio and enjoy the liveliness of the street scene. the location is great if you're on your way to the game, or if you'd prefer to have a decent cocktail and sit and watch the game at the bar. the menu is casual and contemporary, and they have a large private dining room which can accomodate a group event.

We brought some clients here for lunch. Boring. The calamari and mushroom "cigars" were the appetizer choice for the rest of the table. I try not to turn my nose up, oh well. The special is "tacos" for lunch and almost the entire table ordered, and then I decided to be a wild man and thought I'd order the Veal Meatball Sandwich, which was a trio of melted cheese veal and yummy carnivoristic pleasantries, and comes with some some ridged spicy blase "chips." All in all, if we would have been having cocktails and spending less time "yapping" and doing sales stuff (It was a business lunch by the way) we may have discovered or suggested some more creative dishes.

well, another establishment to check off the list of "places never to go back to". let me say this: 1) i've been in the industry for some years and have a solid understanding of closing procedures for restaurants and the "dead" season. 2) i'm a student, so i know when you have more pressing engagements, especially during finals, than sitting at work to serve a two-top. 3) i may very well be a food service snob (but there ain't nothin wrong with that). 4) two stars is for an inventive persimmon salad and a slightly charred mac n' cheese. now let me say this: is there a quality food service establishment in this city that actually gives a shit about those who patronize it and make it profitable? ok. yer dead on a monday night in december. i get it. no excuse. someone walks in before you are closed...what do you do? you SERVE them! you have your menu open to them, your chefs and cooks available to give them an experience of your fare, and you do not, DO NOT, hurry them or deny them any aspect of what a paying customer deserves. this is a capitalist society, you know this. well, aside from the salad i already gave you a star for, in a fairly empty (but not closed or, for that matter, dead) restaurant, a drink order is wrong, entrees were thrust on the table before the enjoyable salad could be cleared or even digested, food was cooked poorly (probably rushed by a line cook working the closing shift) and, this is the big one: dessert wasn't even offered! a server feigning apology regretted to tell us dessert wasn't available because "the dessert chef had saran-wrapped and closed the whole area."...her words, not mine. are you KIDDING ME?! it's just wrong, unprofessional, and pathetic. so...a challenge to the service industry workers of san francisco. the cooks, the servers, the hosts, the managers, the bussers, the expos, the OWNERS... GET OVER YOURSELF! you are not of the upper echelon of the social hierarchy because you serve, cook, prepare, or have anything to do with the service of food and beverages. come back to earth and give your ever-important time to those individuals willing to PAY you a pretty penny for that which you are employed. i was just looking for some dessert, and now i'm never going back. and i've issued a challenge...thanks paragon. for nothin.

I had the roast chicken with macaroni and cheese and it was fantastic. The chicken was juicy and crispy and the mac and cheese was perfect. I also ordered a mojito which was mediocre. The key to getting all that minty goodness from a mojito is to muddle the mint, which was not done. I would come back for the chicken but would skip the mojito next time.

Special Thanksgiving dinner. Special menu. They even called to confirm reservation. Special day. Experience: It took 15 minutes after being seated to have order taken and 1 hour and 20 minutes to be served. Our waiter avoided eye contact with us during this period. When we announced that we had waited long enough and would be leaving, dinners and a free bottle of wine arrived. Insufficient for poor service and substandard food. A plus was salmon option. Unfortunately it was overlooked and on a bed of undercooked barley. Turkey dinners ok. Just ok. Stuffing was over-saged bread chunks. Part of the special dinner was a take home package containing the fixings for a turkey sandwich. They substituted ham for the turkey. Won't be returning for any occasion, special or not.

I work near this place and have stopped in for a burger in the past but have yet to make it a staple part of my SOMA routine. That is, until I planned to meet a friend there for a quick dinner and to watch Obama's speech at the Democratic Convention the other week. I was the first to arrive and asked the bartender what was playing on one of the two TVs. It was a commercial break from a college football game, but he wasn't sure who was playing (there was another football game on the other TV). I asked if he would mind putting Obama on with closed captions. His response was to smirk, look at me and say, "If you want to watch the convention, go home. This is a bar; we don't discuss politics or religion here." At first I thought his brazen rudeness was a joke, but he was totally serious. That's my last time at Paragon. It's not politics, it's history.

sometimes working in outside sales is a grind. multiple appointments in the same area that are back to back to back often means lunch at 2pm or later. so Paragon was open and close to my last appointment. my co worker and i ordered burgers and beers and this so hit the spot. the beef was nicely seasoned and served on a fresh bun. side order of shoestring fries with a touch of garlic and parsley were served at the proper fresh out of the fryer. beer was super cold and the perfect way to chase down the burger and fries.

Met-up with new friends for late Happy-Hours. The place is pretty decent and the crowd was moderate in size. When we got there, around 6:30pm, HHs had just ended and we were presented with the aperitif list. The list is quite extensive and the house wine is really good and cheap in price. The menu is a totally different story...There doesn't seem to be a large selection, and everything seems quite greasy. Nothing extraordinary in the food presentation, but it was good. Our server was very nice and checked-up on us constantly. We had a great time and would highly recommend this place for people that wanna meet-up with friends after a long day at work, grab a drink at the bar, or just chill. Its close to the ballpark and a perfect place before, during, or after the ball game. There are plasmas all over the place with different games on, to satisfy every guest. Outside seating is awesome during the summer months...Enjoy!!!

Wow. Talk about sloooooow service. Our group of four for lunch had to seek out a bus boy for help because we stood at the front waiting to be helped and no one acknowleded us! We then proceeded to seat ourselves outside and still...no one came by with menus...so I decided I had to get them myself if we ever wanted to order lunch. In short, the service was slow, unapologetic and the food was just ok. It actaully seemed overpriced after what we had to go through. Not worth it unless you have tons of time to kill and want to be left alone to fend for yourself.

Pretty good food, close to the ballpark with a fun vibe! It's reasonably priced and pretty easy to get a reservation (on non-game peak times of course). If you like grilled cheese get it here (and maybe add a tomato!) it comes with a cup of tomato soup and mixed greens... so good! The maple espresso mouse with peanut brittle is an amazing dessert!

I went here to watch the Lakers game 3. We sat in the bar section and ordered appetizers and a beer. First, the service is prompt and friendly. The joint is typical hip SF with mostly an after-work happy hour crowd. The food is decent (pizza, salad, and skinny fries). The reason we went here is because it was convenient. However, I would not go back just to watch a game. The TVs are too small and they don't turn up the volume. This is a good place for a drink, but I wouldn't go there to watch a game.

Learned 2 things: 1. bartenders dont like when u ask for an "overpriced mojito" (or I guess any drink for that matter). 2. Avoid the area when there is a stadium event. Back to the review... Went there @545pm. Place was pretty nice, remided me as much of a NYC style bar/restaurant as we've seen so far. Very crowded b4 game. Would have loved to get a table outside, but very few, and the queue of paunchy M&F baseball fans was ready to pounce on the next one that came avail. Ordered mojito from the now angry bartender (bet he's never heard that one b4) and kept any eye on how he was making it as not add a jigger of visine, he was slamming the glassware pretty hard, so maybe if lucky a shard of glass would break off and be ingested by me. Mojitos were not as bad as other(s) have written. They are fairly large, and $8, which isn't out of line -imho. We finally got a inside table and ordered some tapas style stuff. Sauted spinach, calamari, mac and chz, mussels (we actually wanted oysters, but in my mojito-induced-buzz obnoxiousness, may have said mussels, they were decent too). Food came in an expected amt of time considering it was dinner time and there was a game. It was tasty, and well presented. Waitress was friendly and told us some pretty enteraining stories of her apt and living in the tenderloin. We would go back, just not when its as busy.

I hate to be another echo here, but spendy and the food is indeed mediocre. ?Seriously oversalted at times, bland at others, just somehow lacking in verve. ?The dearth of decent restaurants in this area allow for its continued existence but I wish it didn't so someone new and better could move on in. ?On the nights I've been here, I've witnessed some seriously egregious cougar attacks. ?Trust me, making yourself look bigger by spreading your jacket out doesn't help you at all--just makes a mauling all the more inevitable. ?just pay your tab quickly and head out the door.

This place is under rated. I have never had a bad experience here and the service has always been good. The calamari and fries are the best for starters and I usually get the hanger steak. My friend swears by the pot roast and will order nothing else. ?All the drinks are pretty good and I always end up wanting to try them all.

Only had drinks here. So I can only speak of the drinks and the bartenders. I was with a friend very particular with her drinks. Not so much into beer nor taking shots. Mind you we were attending the Giants game and wanted to get a few drinks before we went inside AT&T park. I had a few beers and one of the bartenders mad her a basil cucumber mojito which was actually very refreshing. The other bartender came up her own drink which had ginger beer, basil and cucumber and some other hard liquor. It was good, but just to know that those 2 bartenders came up with there own drink for my friend to try was impressive. Some people still go the extra mile. Thanks for the drinks.

I had only been to Paragon restaurant for dinner, but I recently went there for lunch with co-workers and was pleased. ?My meal was quite tasty, everyone seeme happy with what they ordered.

Our service was fair but could have been better, It was a sunny beautiful day and not crowded at all & the waiter took his precious time to serve my colleagues meal to her.

Many people refer to this place as expensive but given the decor and the location (one block from the ball park in the middle of a rather major business area) I think it is rather well priced. ?Entrees range from $15-$20 and everything is delicious. ?My Father introduced me to this restaurant when he worked on Townsend during the dot-com boom and claimed they have the best hamburger in the city. ?Not being burger fan I can't say if he was right but they do have the BEST GARLIC FRIES in San Francisco. ?The Backed mac and cheese is always delicious, french onion soup always hot, salads always fresh. ?They have managed to take alot of comfort food and make them a little more up-scale, with out making them to she-she. ?So if you are in the mood for a small splurge, treat yourself to a nice long meal there.

Paragon is more a comfortable setting where you hear one another with a drink than a great place to dine. Their appetizers are good, but their other dishes, including desserts fall short for the price point; though better than MoMo's.

Came here on high recommendations from a friend after a Giants game hoping to catch drinks and dinner. ?Since we got there at 4, entrees were not being served, so decided on a few beers on draft, cocktails and appetizers. ?We looked up at the board with the list of beers and said, "Oh, yes PLEASE!" ?Nice selection. ?Also had a ruby red cosmo which was okay. Had the calamari appetizer which also had some deep fried string beans and onion with an aioli sauce drizzled all about. Not too greasy and had decent texture. ?The mussel appetizer was quite flavorful, almost a curry-ish essence to it and chopped chorizo with a nice spice to the sauce, but the portion and mussel sizes were on the small size. Why a three star rating? Maybe because I was told it was fantastic and to me, didn't live up to the huge hype, maybe the cosmo was just ok, but probably cuz I wanted dinner and they should've moved up the time because a crowd was coming from a Giants game - people gotta learn to flex for the crowd, sheesh. If I go back and have a meal, I'll update this restaurant. ?Paragon - I wanted a meal, get it?

The food is still good for lunch, however there is something fundamentally wrong here. I've ordered takeout many many times, and there always is something wrong with the order, however, this time took the cake. They said 30 minutes (for 4 sandwiches) over the phone when i placed the order. After arriving on time, I continued to wait for another 30 minutes as first they forgot one of the sandwiches, then when they were supposedly ready, they misplaced the other 2 sandwiches. Meanwhile, three guys placed an order to-go at the counter, and literally got their meals at the same time as me...

Made a reservation on http://opentable.com, and they seemed confused when we got there -- and didn't know where to sit our table of 4 amongst all the empty tables. Then, we had service issues...the order was completely wrong for one of our people - (and twice!!). The server didn't charge us, but it just was super awkward because of it. However, the my food was pretty good. I started with the soup special which was an asparagus soup (it wasn't good), and I had the cod plate for dinner (which was super!). Also, the mushroom cigars are fricking fantastic, but you must like mushrooms to enjoy these. Someone at our table got fries with their meal and they were really perfect. So, overall...the 3 stars isn't because of the service mishaps, but just because this restaurant doesn't offer anything unique or interesting. It is a regular american bistro (but the food is better than MoMos...so go here if you are choosing something on the intersection of 2nd and King/Townsend. They are definitely 3.5 stars.

Most of the food here is mediocre, but their fish special is always good if you go for a business lunch and their grilled cheese is pretty good as well. The only thing with the grilled cheese is it costs $4 to add meat which I think is a little ridiculous. I mean, $4? Really?

2.5 stars Paragon offers the standard fare of American-Californian type dishes that you would find at most middle-end restaurants: calamari, some sort of tuna appetizer (seared or tartare), steak, burgers, roasted chicken, grilled fish, etc. I came here last Friday with a group of out-of-towners, and although the place was not packed at all service was very slow. ?We kept asking for more water and more bread, but it took about 3 times of asking before we received anything. ?Waiting for our entrees took a long while too, and it's very confounding to me because the restaurant was not extremely crowded. ?To top it off, my friend's pot roast dish was supposedly too charred to make it out of the kitchen, and the manager himself came over and graciously apologized. ?My friend decided to not have the dish at all, and the manager was very nice and even took her boyfriend's dish off the bill. ?What's ironic was that I actually thought that my hanger steak was a bit charred. ?I ended up cutting away all the ends of my steak so I could eat just the middle. ?In general, I felt that all of the appetizers we ordered to share and the entree I ordered were bland and lacked flavor. ?Food was just okay. The ambiance of the restaurant is cozy and romantic, service was nice but too slow. ?I don't think I'll be back here for another meal, but I wouldn't mind having a few drinks at the bar.

in the on-going quest for a new happy hour spot to add to the list, we searched out paragon. $5 cocktails, and some small plates, sounded good! we ventured in at about 4:20 as their website stated that happy hour started at 4, and paying full price didn't sound as fun as paying $5. we sat down and the server said we were 'about 7 minutes early' for the special. umm ok. i suggested they alter the time on their website, as it stated different hours, and she sorta shrugged and walked away. after a patient 7 minutes, we ordered the first round: the ginger snap, and juan collins. the menu emphasized the ginger and cilantro syrups respectively, so we were hopeful for a unique cocktail. the juan was a plain, and somewhat crappy margarita. i detected nothing cilantro-esque about it. the ginger snap had a ridiculously overpowering cinnamon sugar rim, and neither of us could taste any ginger at all. strike one. in the meantime we ordered some snackies. mac-n-cheese (regular, not the fried), and pulled pork quesadilla. as we were two of about eight people in the whole restaurant, i feel that waiting 20 minutes for two small plates was somewhat baffling. the quesadilla was made with a corn tortilla, which was too firm to be a palate pleaser. According to the menu, it came with chipotle aioli, but we received a dill (wtf?) sour cream. Fail. The mac-n-cheese was actually quite good. No complaints there. We continued our sashay down the cocktail list, each one being worse than the last. I watched the bartender's lost puppy dog face and realized when she muddled the ice and not the mint on a drink that we may have been a bit hopeful in our HH selection. The final cocktail was literally the worst I have ever had. By this time, we had tried all 6 on the HH menu, and not a winner in the bunch. When our server asked how everything was, I told her how awful it really was, and offered to let her take it away 75% full. She clearly felt bad, and took it off the bill, which was nice of her. All in all, this place can split the one star between our server, whose humor in the face of my disappointment was pleasant and unexpected, and their mac-n-cheese, which was the only decent item we ordered. Oh, and while I understand that proximity to the ball park means you need to have Bud Light on the menu, PBR in a can should never cost $4. Are you people f*in crazy?

I'm a fan only cause this is steps to my favorite ballpark. ?I like sitting in their outside seating right before a Giants game and having a few of their great cocktails. Wheither it's a grapefruit cosmo or a martini, I'm happy.... always happy when I leave. I love the crispy calamari and the caesar salad. The only minus is during game time I have to be here at least 2 hours in advance in order to get any kind of seat. ?But it's on the corner and I get to see all my other Giants fans come spilling past the restaurant headed ?to the ballpark. ?The other times of the year it's just a gathering place for my friends and I to meet and hang out.

This bar-slash-restaurant is an obvious reflection of its location. Steps away from SBC Park, it capitalizes on walk-in patrons from several residential developments around it and baseball fans during baseball season by serving solid American fare but at highly-inflated prices. ?Though I had a satisfying meal, the high bill for less-than-innovative cuisine put a dent in the experience.

I've never been to this place before and I went there for lunch with my boss. ?I would say the food was OK; although, you have to be really bad to mess up pasta. ?The waitress was not bad to look at, but you need more than that to have good service. ?It took a while to take our initial order in, then when we're about to finish our food, the check came without being asked for or given the dessert menu. ? ?My boss asked for the dessert menu and they took the check back, but the dessert was not worth the effort, but I did finish mine because I was thought as a child to never leave food on my plate. ?I don't think I'm going back to this place, unless invited by another boss. ?I know I should go there more than once to have a better perspective, but if you want to be successful, it should be done right the first time.

i first went to the san jose location a couple of years ago. luckily, my date did all the ordering, not to mention taking care of the bill as well. so, i don't quite remember how much we spent. i think it was a pretty good amount as we left happily intoxicated. had i written a review after that first visit, i would have probably given them 4 stars. last week, i went to the soma location. as i looked at the menu, i had this sense of deja vu, like i'd seen it before. i remembered that at my previous visit, there wasn't much on the entree menu that looked particularly mouth watering. in other words, i didn't want to order anything off of it. however, the appetizers and sides were a bit more appetizing. i had a drink and ordered the ahi tuna tar tare (it came with taro chips, yum!). we also had mac & cheese and a side of spinach. the sides were good. my sister had raved about their mac & cheese, but i'd had better. unfortunately for them, the same sister makes the best mac & cheese ever. if it weren't for their drinks, i think i'd give the place one star. drinks always make me happy for some reason...

want to wait over an hour for a few sandwiches and then get a pretty nasty grilled cheese? if so, then this is the place for you! the grilled cheese comes with tomato soup - this soup has to be the most disgusting/basic tomato soup west of the mississippi. i just had my first bite of the 'side salad' - absolutely disgusting. this place is not good. As a matter of fact, it's quite terrible.

Last night sealed the two star deal. The TV's in the bar are pretty horrific. Especially when one is trying to watch the BCS championship. In fact, our server said more than a few people left after seeing the bar set up. ? We did as well, following one round. Now, normally this wouldn't be an issue, except this IS a bar next to the Ballpark. So you'd think sports (aka top notch TVs) would be a priority. It doesn't mean you can't be an upscale establishment either. But since I've never been a fan of their food, this place doesn't fit the bill for either occasion. My advice... invest in much better LCD's and you might not be empty on game nights.

This SOMA eatery is all about presentation - and they have enough quality to back it up. I've never seen a head of lettuce look so good. Definitely try the mushroom cigars for an appetizer. They're crunchy on the outside as well as soft and savory on the inside. It is a bit overpriced, and that's probably because its in the realm of AT&T Park and then MoMo's down the street. However, its a great place to go with co-workers for a special lunch.

like all restaurants - timing makes for a better experience. go when the giants are playing in town and it affects service and ambiance. i went on a warm quiet non-game day and had a surprisingly good experience. my friend and i dined alfresco with dog and enjoyed pulled pork and other meats on a bun. interestingly enough i thought our server was a little too attentive. we whiled the rest of the evening away on the fries and drinks. comfort food seems the right way to go. home game days have paragon and the other place down the street packed to standing room only (heck the street itself is packed). give yourself some time when you order differently but expect to get exactly what you asked for.

Dinner last night was both memorable and enjoyable...a hard combination to get just right, but Paragon did it. ?We were, however, a large party of 12 in the little private dining area so maybe we got some special attention, but that made it even better. I had the wedge salad, which is hard to mess up so all I can say is that it was a good wedge of crunchy water...I mean iceburg lettuce, hahahahah...cucumbers, blue cheese and Ranch. I thought wedge salad was supposed to have bacon, but I had a martini or two before it arrived so maybe it was me. Hanger steak with asparagus was an excellent choice for my entree and the meat was cooked perfectly. ?Being in the business I know Hanger is not expensive to buy and easy to mess up! The price was a little high ($22), but at least it was deliciously tender, cooked properly and a nice cut of Hanger. Plus, they shaved my asparagus to make sure the bottoms were just as tender as the tops. This attention to detail is a sign of caring about the food's texture as well as the flavor so hands up in the air for the cook with the peeler shaving the asparagus! ?Tedious, I'm sure, but so well worth it...thank you to the Legumier! ?The entree paired well with the Flat Tire on draught. Finally, the interpretation on the banana split was rockin'! ?Thank you for a well thought out, deconstructed plate of gingerbread cookie, ice cream, bananas and chocolate sauce. ?Coffee with Frangelico neat...stick a fork in me 'cause I was done! Paragon I did read some of your one star reviews on my way to the restaurant, but they mostly seemed to be ball game related and that's really just not fair. ?I tried my friend's French fries, which could have been a little better I think...however he devoured his burger and it looked delicious. ?Several others compliments on the two different pasta dishes and said they were very good as well. ? Four stars because it's nice to see attention to detail in every aspect of a meal and I did...food, beverage, service and ambiance. ?Kudos to you all.

The only reason this place is getting 2 stars is because of the beer selection. the rest of this review would pretty much be a complain fest... The place was empty and yet we waited way too long for our food. The food wasn't great, I had the grilled cheese and the best part was the bread. The salad was over dressed and the soup was fine.

Well, my wife talked me in to going downstairs tonight to Paragon, which is located in our building. I was reluctant but she wanted to have the Ahi app that they serve. When we told our server what my wife wanted we were told that they no longer had the Ahi app on the menu. It has been on the menu for years and has been a favorite to many. We were told they still had the mushroom logs, which tastes like a turd rolled in cooked burnt dough. My wife decided we would leave and go elsewhere. Had it not been for the fact that the employees always make us feel like they are always doing us a favor for being located there we would have probably stayed but our decision to go elsewhere was a much better decision.

It's comfort food with a fancy twist and it's amazing. So why not 5 stars? ?The menu is pretty small (hence why I've eaten 3/4ths of the dishes), but it changes seasonally! I have a friend with severe food allergies and Spencer (the head chef) always comes out and helps design a special dish just for her!

Went for dinner last night right and picked this Paragon primarily because of its location, a block away from the ballpark. ?Great choice. ?Ambience was great, low lights, candles, and although it was a full restaurant, it wasn't packed like sardines like Momo's and we could actually have a conversation across the table without having to scream. ? ?Food was delicious, especially the pulled pork sliders. ?Highly recommended. We also had the hamburger and an ice berg salad, which were good too but didn't stand out or anything. Prices are reasonable, and given the area, they could probably charge more. ?Service was good, I wasn't feeling well and the server had no problem with refilling my hot water & honey all evening. ?

We have been ordering food from Paragon for our office neighborhood for over a year, the quality has been good, never great. ?Went in to dine last week and had what was probably the worst meal I've had in San Francisco for a long time. ? We received no bread and olive oil, the GM was wearing a dirty blouse with food stains on it and didn't know the fish of the day. ? I ordered it and it was clearly an old piece of fish fried in old oil...it sat on a bed of "hash" which had fatty pieces of ham and was half cold and half warm. ? My companion had the fish tacos and although she said she liked it, I thought the dish looked anemic with no color or zest and an unappetizing pile of fish next to the other ingredients. ?My other companion had the Cobb Salad which was way too big and not really that flavorful. ? I think that because there are few restaurants in this neighborhood and because it is close to the ballpark, they don't try very hard to make the food appealing.

I feel mixed about rating this restaurant. Went for lunch the other week and got the grilled cheese (with bacon), salad, and cup of tomato soup. This was an incredible deal and delicious!!!! The bacon put it over the top - maybe go without it the next time. I felt so good about my experience that I returned later in the week for dinner. Awful!!!! ?The portions were small, the food - for the price - was just not worth it. We had the chips (a bit too greasy) and the onion dip was really too strong. A bbq chicken pizza for an appetizer - rather bland. I had their special catch of the day - Monk fish - it was good, but the spinach it was on was too salty. The side of polenta was lukewarm and super runny and just not flavorful. My friend had the pan-seared sea bass.... a rather small piece on an even smaller amount of veges. My other friend had the steak. ?This was delicious and seemed appropriate for the cost. However the potato gratin was a bit too cheesy and skimpy on the potatoes. We had the pumpkin cheesecake for dessert. Yuck! Gingerbread crust was as thick as the pumpkin. Way too dense. and the cheesecake just couldn't compete with the crust. :( I saw that they offered the grilled cheese on the dinner menu - don't know if it comes like the lunch menu.... I think that is what I will stick to next time. Lunch - a definite yes Dinner - a definite no

Went to Paragon last night and didn't realize they had introduced a BBQ Wednesday nights and a happy hour now! The happy hour is a wonderful addition (was wondering for years why there was never one to begin with). All the drinks were tasty and my boyfriend was loving the expanded beer selection. We had the BBQ dinner, and it was phenomenal! ? We had the brisket and bbq ribs which were served to us promptly despite the restaurant being busy. ?We left feeling full and absolutely satisfied. The service by a blonde waitress in the cocktail area was friendly and she really knew the menu and was able gave us really good suggestions when she informed us that the pull pork wasn't available. ? We will definitely be back in order to get the pull pork sandwich and for the great atmosphere and service!

I just ate here for lunch, and as much as I want to like this place, I was more than a little miffed at the indifferent service. What is wrong with this city. It was 2:00pm and the waiters ignored my wife and I for a solid 5-10 despite the fact that the place was empty. Finally a bus boy came and flagged down one of the "servers." Pleasant enough when they showed up but then ignored again throughout the whole meal. I ordered a salad, did the server ask if I wanted pepper, of course not. ?To add insult to injury I could see what I think was the manager yammering away about the menu in the corner. How about keeping an eye on the indifferent wait staff with the lousy service? ?Although the food was pretty good I don't think I will be coming back again soon (not that I think the wait staff will care).

It's been good to me. Nice food, good wine. Organic, local and seasonal. I love the toasted cheese sandwich and tomato soup. I generally go for lunch and i try to avoid ballgame days when it gets crowded and the service suffers.

A group of friends and I were recently looking for a place to host a memorial get together for a recently lost friend . Even though we were on EXTREMELY short notice, Bevan (the GM) and the staff at Paragon went above and beyond to make the necessary arrangements for our group. In addition to amazing service, we were given the private back room which was a perfect size and ambiance for our 30-ish standing crowd. The food was delicious (try the mushroom cigars, you won't be disappointed!) and the wine selection was just right. All in all, the kind folks at Paragon provided us with everything we needed to turn a somber evening into a true celebration with good friends. One of the friendliest staffs in town, highly recommended.

Updating my review simply because Bevan, the manager, was nice enough to message me her apologies for her staffs misstep. I really dont mind waiting for food, I just didn't like the guys attitude. However, I understand everybody has a bad day/night, and he probably was getting attitude from other parties. Anyway, I like businesses that acknowledge customer issues. The key is for them to figure out who are the whiners who just complain about everything and just Can't be satisfied. I say screw this group and let em eat elsewhere. I'm rambling. I'll try this place again, but I won't take Bevans kind offer to call her ahead and let her know I'm coming. I'm paranoid about people doing crap to my food! I know she wouldn't, but the fellas in back sure would.

i think i've only eaten here when the company was footing the bill. that means it's one of those places i wouldn't normally go, but enjoy the opportunity when it comes around. i do wish they'd offer their grilled cheese sandwich on the dinner menu, but the macaroni and cheese comes close to making up for its absence. their menu sounds quite fancy, but the presentation is quite lacking when it comes to meeting the price points. but the bar is a winner every time. then again, almost every bar is a valid winner..

came here for happy hour and ended up staying for dinner, kinda. ?i tired their smores martini and it was yummy. ?time for dinner rolled around and i just got the calamari appetizer, which was definitely filling enough for dinner, although i might've tried something more dinner-like if we had moved to a real table.

I keep wanting to drag my little mouse over the 4th star but for some reason something is stopping me. ?What could it be? ?The food was terrific (I would definitely recommend the chicken with mac and cheese) and the drinks... very strong and very yummy.... But... there is something holding me back.. what could it be? ?Oh wait.. I know.. the service. ?Now, granted I think there was only one girl who was working the dinning room but come on people on game days let's try to staff the appropriate number of people. ?I did not go to the game and was simply trying to go to dinner with my sister, her husband, and my roomy. ?Maybe game day is not the best day to head to this very convenient restaurant but the game had been over for at least 3 hours and the crowd was obviously dying down or at least looked like they were about ready to stumble out of there. ?Not the point however. ?I do like this place and I will go back but as I guess it is with any restaurant around the ball park you have to be prepared for game days even when you are happening by many hours after the game has finished. ?So, go.. enjoy the stiff drinks and the good food but of course like any ball park restaurant be prepared for those crazy game days.!!!

i definitely like it here better than Momos for pre/post giants game drinks. i've never eaten here but from what i hear the food is not anything to get excited about... still, i like all those rowdy giants fans and the atmosphere is nice and dark. they even have a little patio in front for those summer nights.(wait, scratch that. this is san francisco and we dont have warm summer nights) a lot of the allure for me too is that they have a great selection of gins.(anyplace that has hendricks gin scores high in my book)

Lackluster at best. I went here for lunch with my boss and co-workers. I had the fish tacos and a side of plantains. The plantains were the worst I ever had. They tasted like deep fried stale potato chips. The fish for the tacos was bland, bland, bland. My coworkers complained of their food being very bland as well. I tried their garlic fries and the have better ones at the baseball games. Also the waitress was just bleh. The only thing that saved the whole lunch was the bread pudding. AMAZING! The best bread pudding ever. That's the only reason why I gave this place 2 stars instead of 1. Alas, I wouldn't go back again.

overall an unremarkable, overpriced neighborhood restaurant. ?still, used to come here regularly since it is conveniently close to home, but after a run-in with bartender Dan, we won't be coming back. ?my only comment is that bartenders should treat their customers with respect. ?there is no excuse for rude behavior, especially at a bar which is almost always, including on the night in question, half-empty. ?we won't be back.

I had a pretty yummy meal here on Saturday night. It was 5 of us out enjoying a night of dinner and dancing. I had a friend visiting from LA and another friend suggested we go there. We showed up way after our reservation was set for but the hostess was awesome- granted it was an extremely slow night either wise i am sure they would have knocked us off and made us wait. I had a mojito, which is one of my favorite drinks ever in life- ever and they made a pretty damn good one. The food is nothing out of this world but I ordered the roast chicken dinner which came with spinach and a fancy shmancy mac and cheese which was pretty damn yummy. Our dessert was so good too, it was an ice cream sandwhich with a side of fudge for dipping...I LOVE CHOCOLATE...I'm crazy for anything with it. Overall the dinner was a pretty good experience and tasty. A little over priced for my taste- it was $64 for 2 which was our portion of the bill and we didn't have appetizers or too many cocktails. I liked it and the area is relatively nice. I reccomend this spot for a pre baseball dinner date...

I came here with friends and we were really hungry. We were greeted with a nice welcome smile and got seated right away. For starters we had mushroom cigars with porcini aioli and crispy calamari. I love cigars but those mushroom cigars were just mouthwateringly delicious. I am really impressed by that finger-food that left me a big impression and desire for more. Good appetiser makes me always ready for a main course. For entree I had roasted chicken sautéed spinach, mac- n- cheese. I thought it was kind of unusual mix of food (mac-n-cheese is for kids I think) but I wanted to try their roasted chicken. It tasted good and watering it down with white wine made me feel like I'm a king, lol. After we left the restaurant I had a good taste in my mouth about their food, staff and nice cozy little eatery. If you ever happen to be around that block I recommend you to come in and try it out. For sure.

Agreed, three stars. Slightly snide service -- in spite of a reservation they said they weren't sure they had room for us (how's that again?). I had the grilled cheese (on big ol' slabs of bread with painfully hard crunchy crust, not what I envisioned, though not bad) -- ?I don't recommend adding turkey, because they just took cold turkey and slapped it into the hot sandwich, leaving the whole thing tepid. The tomato soup was fresh-tasting and comforting. I might go back, but not for a workday lunch, because it took forever to get waiter's attention.

Probably the worst service I have had in a restaurant but the food was good, not great, but good. ? Had lunch at Paragon and the restaurant was not crowded. ?People who arrived after us were served and finished before we received our order. ?It appeared what others ordered were comparable to our meals..two salads and a soup. ?It was impossible to flag down our waiter. ? When our order arrived, they failed to bring a soup spoon. ?It's a little difficult to eat soup with a fork. ?At that time, I asked for an iced tea with no lemon. ?They finally brought the soup spoon when we were finished eating the salads at which time the soup was cold. ?In addition, at the end of the meal, I told the waiter I was not interested in the iced tea. ?Shortly thereafter, they brought the iced tea. ?I told the waiter who delivered the tea that I had cancelled the order but he indicated I could keep it on the ?house. ?Unfortunately, it had a lemon in it when I had specifically requested no lemon. ?I did not take the tea. ?The waiter ?returned with our check. ?At that time, I told him we were interested in ordering a dessert. ?He never asked if we were interested in dessert. ?Dessert took another 20 minutes to arrive. ?It is obviously not a place to go on your lunch hour. ?All in all we were there for for about 2 hours just for soup and salad.

This past sunday I saw something that looked very good at the Paragon. I asked the young cook what it was that he had made, he replied " It's called a Guwapo Bandido."
