What I ordered: - Belgian Chocolate Shake (A+) - Turkey Club (A-) - Chicken Waffles (B+) - Seasonal Creme Brulee (A+) It pains me to say this but even though Chapman is a rival to my alma mater and across the street from Bruxie I'd go here everyday if I could. I only wish I had three stomachs to try everything on the menu. The staff had told me their chicken and waffles were the most popular item but not considered the best thing on the menu I ordered it anyways...I should have listened. Most people would agree that passing up C&W is a very hard thing to do. 蔠hile it was still good, there are much better things to fill up on. Like the Belgian Chocolate Shake, I wish my blood was made up of this stuff. It's not overpoweringly sweet but OH SO GOOD. Hands down the best chocolate shake i've ever had, and I've actually been to Belgium. I wasn't in the mood for Turkey but that didn't stop me from devouring half my sister's Turkey Club. After eating 1 and a half waffle sandwiches I was pretty stuffed but when I took a bite of their Seasonal Creme Brulee dessert, I would have eaten that until my stomach exploded and it would have been well worth it. They need to start a food truck and park it permanently outside my house.

This place is definitely overhyped. 蔍 spent way too much for 2 waffles haha. The Liege waffle was definitely too dry but they definitely didn't skimp on the quality of the chocolate. 蔄lso, the pearl sugar wasn't what I thought it was. 蔜hey're hard balls of sugar that don't melt into the batter like the waffles that I had once upon a time in Portland, OR =( The chicken and waffle waffle was good but it wasn't amazing. 蔜he slaw and sauce was good but the eggo-like waffle didn't impress.

When I first heard about this place, I was a bit skeptical. 蔠affles? 蔒ade into a Burger? 蔠ho's been drinking the crazy juice? .... well the answer to that question is ME! 蔅ecause I must have been absolutely insane not to have come here sooner. �Bruxie certainly did things right by perfecting their waffle recipe. 蔆risp on the outside and soft on the inside. 蔅y some miracle, the waffles also never seem to get soggy even when stuffed chock full of goodies. My faves so far: *Bruxie burger *Creme brulee waffle A must try.

Tried Bruxie a few weeks ago after seeing it so many times on Instagram. 蔍 had been wanting to try it out and finally got a chance to when I was visiting a place nearby in Fullerton. �I got there and the line was a bit long but it went pretty fast. 蔍 went with the Buttermilk Fried Chicken and Waffle. 蔍t comes doused with chili honey and cole slaw. 蔍t had some good flavor but my big complaint was that it was a bit dry, which made it hard to eat. 蔒aybe they just didn't put enough chili honey sauce into it. 蔍 really don't know. 蔍 just left the place a bit unimpressed and wondering what all the hype is about. 蔍t is good but I don't know if it lives up to the hype.

I have been waiting to come here for some time. Finally took the time to come last weekend. I knew this was going to be a good experience because there was a size-able line of people waiting to order. First off, parking can be kind of tricky. I had to circle 3 times before I found a curbside spot. There is a lot behind Bruxie, but I don't think it's open to visitor parking. OK, the food- I ordered the roasted mushroom and goat cheese waffle. For dessert, nutella and banana waffle. I never had goat cheese before and it was DELISH! The mushrooms were tender and I loved the arugula. The nutella and banana waffle was good, but I think I like it better as a crepe. My son had the chicken and waffle- plain. He didn't care for it, but he's weird so don't let that stop you from trying it out. It looked good to me. I don't really care for the sitting. There are about 10 tables/chairs. I appreciate the heat lamps. But I think I'll visit next time during the day time. The staff is really nice. The girl that was cleaning the tables came over to ask how we were doing. I really look forward to trying this place again.

I was immediately intrigued when someone told me about sandwiches in waffle form. I mean.. I've had chicken and waffles and loved it, but chicken IN waffles? Now that's something to talk about. Ok, so maybe I didn't order the chicken.. only because everything else made me change my mind! If you wanna try everything on the menu, I suggest that you come with a partner in crime. You can order 2 different items(or more if you're hungry), have them cut the order in halves for you and SWAP! It'll give you that elementary school feeling of trading lunches with your friend :) Waffle fries are a MUST! Savory favorite: Green eggs and ham. Not only are the eggs actually green, it's quite delicious! Sweet favorite: Creme brulee (be careful! it gets very messy) After you place your order, you can find a seat and they will call out your name and bring your food to your table. They have plenty of outside seating, and if you come on a chilly night they turn on the heat lamps for you! Another plus is they have complimentary waters. Only 2 issues with this place: you have to hunt for parking and there are no restrooms. You have to go to Chapman University diagonal from Bruxie. Bonus: If you have already ordered something, you can skip the line and order first! I was a bit confused when the owner/manager approached me to tell me this news. Since there were so many hungry people in line before me, I very hesitantly went up to the front to order and the workers were so nice about it! And the order comes out so fast, it made me feel less bad for cutting so many patient guests.

I was in the area; so I decided to try this much-talked-about eatery. 蔛ometimes Yelp reviews can be inflated and this would apply to Bruxie. 蔍 had their Turkey Waffle sandwich and thought that is was just "okay". 蔜his is not a bad fast food place; but overall I think that it is over-hyped. 蔍 failed to see how this place is significantly better than Jack-in-the-Box.

I'm not sure how to say this. Umm... I wasn't a fan. Let me start with the good. Service was ah-mahz-ing. They had a greeter who talked to everyone in line. The people bringing out the food were super nice and they actually brought my custard out after the waffle, so that we could eat and then have dessert without it melting. Plus, they said if we wanted something, we could order from the "servers" without having to wait in line again. So, I ordered the chicken and waffles and the custard, and wasn't a fan of either. I thought the chicken and waffles had the same texture, like no crunch- just soft the whole way through. And I thought the honey was a little too overpowering. Maybe I should have splurged and got the maple syrup but I wanted to order it just the way it was. I also didn't like the custard, but apparently I don't like custard in general, so it wasn't Bruxie's doing. My husband said it was really good custard (he also shared my sentiment of the waffle though). In closing, I'll definitely visit again and try something else, but not the chicken.

After reading Scott E.'s review of Bruxie in Brea, I have been dying to do the Bruxie, but my husband thought it sounded repulsive. 蔋owever, since we were in the area and our other plans fell through, I was able to convince him to give it a go. 蔄nd guess what? 蔔ow HE is doing the Bruxie! 蔋e chose the pastrami, and I the green eggs and ham (as the search for this dish has been haunting me since childhood). 蔠ow! 蔍t was even more wonderful than I imagined -- fried egg, ham, cheese and pesto--and the waffle that embraced it all was done perfectly, not too thin, not too thick, crisp, and not sweet. �We also had some tasty waffle fries, and for dessert, tried the Liege waffle with carmelized pearl sugar and a side of Nutella. 蔉or such simple ingredients, the Liege was surprisingly good! 蔙eminded me of a fresh donut minus all the grease and guilt. 蔍 also had my eye on the seasonal strawberry drink options, but really needed my coffee to shift into gear. 蔄nd that too was a hit --Peets coffee. 蔛o good, i drank it black for awhile! 蔒y husband had a diet cola, and didn't even notice that it was not a name brand. 蔜he only negative thing we can say is now that we have done the Bruxie, how can we do without in our Bruxie less home town? 蔛o we are already plotting a scheme to try the one in Brea since it is a smidge closer to home.

Chicken and Waffle sammich. That & homemade soda are all you really need to know. 3.5 stars rounded to 4 for this neat little shack style restaurant on a corner in old orange. Nothing mind blowing, but it's decent stuff. The chicken and waffle sammich... It's good, I like the sauce on it, those herbs do *not* need to be there. The slaw also did not need to be there, it was like flavorless filler. I would still go back for another though. The chicken was crispy, and flavorful, it was fairly moist inside. The sweet sauce (chili honey sauce) drizzled on it was good, I actually wish I had more of that on the side for sammich dunking purposes. I just noticed you can get maple syrup for an extra $1. Note to self: get the syrup. They had some BBQ waffle creation on the menu when I was here, the carolina pulled pork, I was tempted, but i feel glad that i stuck to chicken and waffle. I also got a homemade root beer. That was nice, good flavor a bit expensive and small in size, but whatcha gonna do? I'd go back if i'm already in the area and the line isn't too long. Kinda glad I was able to cross them off my "must try" list though.

Bruxie is located in a college town. 蔍t's a small stand with outdoor seating only. 蔎ust a warning don't plan on guzzling that soda since they don't have any public restrooms. �The service was quick and friendly. 蔣ou order your food and find a place to sit down. They take down your name and they have food runners bring your food to you. 蔛o don't be staring at some cute girl or guy because you might not hear them call your name. 蔍 had to run around the corner and flag the runner down. 蔍n the future I would suggest they do it Carl's Jr style iwth the numbers and holders. Whatever you do, do not order their latte. 蔅legh! 蔅ut what do you expect from a waffle joint. 蔍 ordered the chicken and waffle. 蔍 think it came out to be $7. 蔒y sixth sense told me I should splurge and pay a buck extra to get syrup. 蔊ood thing I did! 蔜he waffle was great, it was the right amount of crispy and was so fresh. 蔕n the other hand, the chicken basted with honey was bland. 蔍 would have liked a lot more seasoning in my chicken. 蔍'm from the South where we eat fried chicken and waffles day, night or just to be snacking. 蔛o I have high expectations when it comes to chicken wtih my waffles. 蔜hat's why I'm glad I paid extra for the syrup. 蔜he syrup comes in a cute little Bruxie jar. 蔍 poured that all over my chicken and licked it off my fingers. 蔜he syrup was just the right amount of sweet. Will I come here again....if I'm in the area. 蔅ut since I drove all the way from LA I probably won't jump at the chance of returning anytime soon. 蔍'd rather go to Roscoe's.

Have been wanting to try the waffle sandwich at Bruxie for a long time and wasn't disappointed. 蔜here is something really satisfying about fried chicken wrapped in a waffle. Spring for the add-on of pure Vermont Maple Syrup ($1.00) - which is enough to share with friends. 蔍t comes in its own cute little bottle and adds the finishing touch to this comfort food creation. 蔖air it 蕎ith one of Bruxie's old fashioned pure cane sugar sodas, grab an outdoor table with an umbrella and you'll feel Ike all is right with the world.

The line to this place is ridiculous! That's what I'm sayin' and everyone else! But I guess it makes sense since this Bruxie is located in a college town and the aroma seeping from this place smells so yummy. Speaking of college town, this Bruxie is located on a cute street of house-restaurants/stores. Super cute and super neat. Next time, I want to go walk around and see what this little downtown Orange area has to offer. After all, there were too many picturesque moments I saw that I know want to take up when I'm free. As for food I tasted the following: Roasted mushroom and goat cheese: basil, arugula, and balsamic reduction $7.95: I'm not use to savory waffles. I mean, I have had Roscoe's Chicken and Waffles before, but I had my waffles with syrup. I liked this waffle but didn't love it. I think it's because it was savory. I like my waffles simple or sweet. Next time, I should just get a plain one and/or the lemon berry one. 3 stars. Date shake $4.95: I'm kinda obsessed with date shakes. Like, I think of em, want em, look for em, gotta have em, and go get em. Well, this does go for anything I crave for. Unfortunately, this date shake didn't live up to the date in me. Did it have a lot of date pieces to munch on? Yes. Was it filled up with all this sugar? Yes and that's no bueno. Plus it came with whip cream on top, which I didn't know about. I like my date shakes simple: date and shake it. No whip cream please! 3 stars. Next time I come, I'm gonna stick to something sweet or plain :)

The seasonal creme brulee is my FAVORITE. I'm craving it right now as I type... maybe I'll get myself some after I type this. It's simple, but taste so amazing. haha, as for the irish nachos don't get it. I was overwhelmed by the cheese and I made my boyfriend eat the rest. I like their strawberry lemonade! But other days taste sour. They need to be more consistent to making it. I recommend the pure cane sodas if you want soda with replaced sugar! I love coming here, the workers are really nice :)) I'm not a fan of the parking on the street though.

Located in Downtown Orange First time I came here was at night when my boyfriend and I decided to do a lil trip from SD to Orange for Bruxie. We found parking easily but it bothered me how there was no public restrooms. We ordered the Strawberry Creme Brulee, the Bacon, Egg, & Cheddar, & a Purple Haze Float. I would definitely recommend both! The second time I came with a friend for lunch, we shared the Straw. Creme Brulee & the Bruxie Burger. YUM! can't wait to come back and try more on the menu

Totally lives up to the hype. #1 Area is soo cute. #2 As soon as you get in line the staff will gladly hand you a menu and go over the specials. Also ask questions they're happy to answer as well as make suggestions with a smile!! #3 Line moves fast Okay so the business. We got there at 9:10am Sunday morning. Already a line, but happy to wait. We chose chicken and waffle, and hash and egg special, we shared the creme brulee with seasonal fruit. Drinks: espresso and Lemonade. Lemonade was tart but sweet, Espresso strong and smooth. Perfect!! We both loved loved loved our waffles. Its been said in other reviews so I wont describe anything other then there is nothing that I would change other then I would request the chili honey on the side for the chicken and waffle as it did make the waffle a bit soggy towards the end. Obviously that's just my personal preference. Now the creme brulee. Honestly how do they make it with the sugar crunch but the custardy filling and berry's all together but tasting separate without the waffle becoming a mess? I don't know how they do it. But it was certainly comparable to any hi end pastry you can get. It was just deli-sh. I can not wait to go back and try so many more things on the menu!!!!!!

Tried bruxies for the first time and it was delish! Pros: Fried chicken waffle sandwich was awesome. Chicken was tasty, tender and juicy. The waffle was yummy too, not too thick or thin...just perfect. The slaw and drizzle of maple syrup gives it a compliment. Strawberry lemonade was fresh and tasty! Custard soft serve sample was good! But just good in sample size lol. I wouldn't have been able to finish a cup. It's really rich, so too much of it would be overwhelming. Ask for a sample before buying! Creme br瀕巈 waffle dessert was wowzers! Super delish and yummilicious! Cons: Fries are yummy too! Just wayyyyy overpriced for the small amount. $2.95 for waffle fries and it's literally a handful of fries? Waffle cut, so it's like 6 to 8 pieces? If that! Pastrami waffle sandwich was not too great for my taste buds. It was oily and left a real fatty, kinda like slime after taste. Bleh! Definitely won't get that again. Parking is a pain!!!!! Make sure you don't park by neighborhoods with signs that say "permit parking only" if you get caught there, you'll be sure to get a ticket. And that'd end up to be one expensive waffle sandwich meal if you do! Lines are loooooooong and seating is limited. If you get there and the line is long, have someone stand in line and go look for a table!

Took my two finicky daughters (6 & 12) to Bruxie after a basketball game yesterday. I've seen some pretty mixed reviews of this place but I was in the mood for something different and knowing that both of my girls are big waffle fans I figured we couldn't go wrong. Waffles at a place with a cute Hello Kitty kind of name on a great summer evening. We lucked out as I was able to park right across the street and there was only a few people in line when we arrived. The line was 20+ deep by the time we left. While in line one of the staff there asked us if we'd been here before. I told him no and asked him what was good to eat. He told me that the Chicken& Waffle and the burger were the most popular but he was burned out on them and preferred the pastrami or the cheesy Bruxies. Cool I like pastrami. So by the time we go to the window we kind of had it figured out. Food & Drinks: I ordered the Hot Pastrami Bruxie #6 Got the Buttermilk Fried Chicken & 蔠affle #12 Got the Bacon Egg & Cheddar One order of Waffle Cut Fries to share 3-16oz Strawberry Lemonades The Pastrami ($7.95) was very good , I liked the spicy mustard and the sandwich thin sliced pickles, could have skipped the slaw and added more cheese or pastrami IMO but the waffle add a nice touch with its crunchy buttermilk taste and the way it held the whole deal together despite the slaw making it a little too wet. It would have been 5 stars without the slaw, and more cheese. �4 star **** Chicken & Waffle ($6.95) 蕄robably not a good choice for a 6 year old, but hey she picked it. She only liked the waffle (should have asked for no slaw) and didn't care for the chicken. I tried a couple of bites of the whole deal and a bite of chicken only. I agree this is a crap sammy. The kid has taste. The chickens coating has a bad taste and the slaw sucks. Go to Rosco's for the real deal. And $1 to add syrup WTF? �� star* Bacon, Egg & Cheddar hey what can I say, any time my 12 year old eats the whole thing it must be good. She saved dad 1 tiny bite and I liked it too. 蔄nd $1 to add syrup WTF? �� star**** �syrup cost reduction 1 star) Waffle cut fries were pretty good but $2.95 �3 star *** 蕂verpriced! Strawberry lemonade was sweet tart and refreshing $2.95 � star *** 蕂verpriced! Service was pretty good and quick too, but they were in a hurry to take away almost empty plates, kind if felt like they wanted to make room for new customers ASAP. Also skimpy on napkins. This place has a license to print money at this location hope the greed doesn't ruin the business for them. I'd eat the pastrami again but wouldn't go out of my way or wait in a line 20 deep.

During my recent trip to Socal, I wanted my first meal to be memorable. After looking at possible restaurants for dinner, Bruxie's seemed to be the best fit. Waffles for dinner? Goood laaawd it was delicious! It was somewhat difficult finding parking since some of the streets were blocked off, but once you find parking everything will be so worth it! I totally didn't expect Bruxie's to be outdoors, but it definitely brought a fun, laid back type of atmosphere to the restaurant. The line was long, and when the lines are long, you know the food must be good! The employees are suuuper friendly, too! I ordered the Bruxie cheeseburger while my boyfriend got the chicken and waffle sandwich. My biggest complaint would be the wait time for our food. My boyfriend received his fries 20 minutes after we ordered and after I complained twice. The Bruxie cheeseburger sandwich - Absolutely delicious! The buttermilk waffles definitely brought the whole sandwich together. One of the Bruxie employees suggested that I get the patty medium well which definitely brought out the flavor in the sandwich. Waffle fries: These were fried to perfection! My boyfriend and I received an extra order because his fries arrived late. The Bruxie chicken and waffle sandwich - It wasn't my favorite, but it was still, very very good! The syrup they included was also very good. I'm not sure if it's made in house, but it complemented the sandwich perfectly. Strawberry Milkshake - You could definitely taste the real strawberries which is how a milkshake is supposed to be! It was a little thick, so I don't recommend getting it if you're going to have a large meal. Strawberry Lemonade - It wasn't my favorite. It was way to tart and didn't have the sweet factor I was looking for. This totally lived up to its hype and I was fully satisfied! I would say this is a "must" for people who plan to visit SoCal soon. No complaints except for the order the food arrives and the lack of bathrooms! No bathrooms and sinks? Gross.

I haven't had chicken and waffles since Atlanta two years ago, so I wasn't sure what mindset I should go into Bruxie with. First of all, I was expecting Bruxie to be an indoor restaurant...not sure why. Instead, it was more like The Hat. The service was exceptional, the people working there were really friendly and helpful, and I didn't have much trouble with parking and waiting for food. The chicken was okay. Not dry, but not as juicy and flavorful as I'd hoped. The waffle was good, it was a bit on the sweet side to offset the chicken's saltiness. There was a bit of spicy (chili?) sauce along with bits of cabbage inside, so it wasn't just a chicken and waffle. Overall, not suuuuuper exciting after all that I heard about Bruxie. I actually really liked Christine W.'s albacore tuna melt! It's on the special rotating menu, and it was quite delicious. Maybe I've been in a tuna craving mood...

Wow. Bruxie blew my mind. I can't wait to go back, even despite the sucky parking and 30 minute wait. I had the fried chicken sandwich ($6.95) with the syrup (which is $1 extra, comes in a cute little glass bottle, and is real maple syrup) and the chocolate covered banana milkshake ( $4.95). The sandwich had sweet chili sauce and coleslaw on it, which both worked surprisingly well with the maple syrup. I scarfed it down and would order it again without hesitation. The shake was very banana and thick, with chocolate fudgy goodness coating the bottom half of cup. It was VERY sweet and I couldn't finish the whole thing. Not sure I'd order it again, especially with all the other delicious drinks they offer like fresh strawberry lemonade and old-fashioned sodas in cool flavors, like black cherry. Parking is pretty terrible but we got lucky and snagged a good spot. You have to wait in a line out front (there's no indoor seating) but they hand out menus and someone comes and takes your order while you're waiting. They give you a paper with your order, which you then give to the cashier at the window when you get to the front of the line. They take your name and bring you your food when it's finished. With the line and the wait for the food I think it was about 30 minutes, but it was sooo worth it when I took the first bite of that sandwich. The tables were clean, they have free water outside along with all the napkins and plastic silverware, and the service was good. We were asked if everything was ok and our trash was taken away even thoough it's an order-at-the-counter place. I was impressed and I'll definitely be going back as often as I can.

Yelp, you have lead me to a great tasting spot. The best place in old town Orange to grad a waffle burger or a pulled pork all the flavors were there the slaw in the pulled pork was amazing and the bbq sauce amazing!!!! There strawberry cheese cake was mouth watering and on that hot summer day there custard simply divine. 5 stars all the way around . 1. Great friendly service. 2 Amazing Food. 3. A shower of mist to cool you down while in line in the summer :) 4. Definitely worth the wait in line, no worries there on it quick service high quality food!!!!

Amazing waffle sandwiches!! I love this place. The first time I came here, i got the smoked salmon sandwich which is so good! I recently had the green eggs and ham sandwich (suggested by the waitress), and this was also very tasty. I recommended the smoked salmon to my friend, and I know he won't admit it to me but I don't think he liked it as much as my green eggs and ham haha - said that the smoked salmon tasted like salmon bagel. I also got to try the fried chicken and waffle as well and that was pretty good. They also have dessert/sweet waffles and I will definitely come here again to try these! The only downside is that parking is limited and we kinda parked in a shady, tow-away area lol but were able to keep an eye on our car. Also, if you have a big appetite, don't expect to be full from just one sandwich. There's also limited seating, but luckily it wasn't too busy when we went. It's located in Downtown Orange and has a college town vibe too (near Chapman), so there's a lot of cute little shops to explore before/after Bruxies!

I had a thought that their waffles would be sweet, but it's fluffy and so savory. Honestly the burger was one of the best i've ever ate. It was very juicy, and well seasoned. The service staff was very friendly and helpful. The only thing that i wish they had was garlic fries.

VERDICT: Savory combination of fillings QUALIFIER: Even their sweet "desert" sandwiches are contained in the "Bold Fold" waffle wraps FOOD: Their seasonal rotation of special waffles and fillings are delightful, but our main staples are and will forever be the prosciutto, the mushroom, and the creme brule. The sodas are sweetened with real sugar instead of syrup, which gives them a very refreshing cleanse, rather than a mucusy aftertaste. Orange flavor is our favorite. �SERVICE: The outside venue exposes all the server running around zipping back and forth from table to service window. The wait is very short. While inside the cramp kitchen space, food preparers sprawl on top of one another to pile on freshly cooked meats, well proportioned sauces, and delicately laid veggies into every single perfected combination of breakfast staple bun.

Well, I finally decided to try this place after all the hype we kept hearing about it. 蔄nd since we were in the area, we decided to go for it. �Well, this place was pretty much like most over-hyped places: 蔯rowded, long lines, good food, small portions, and big prices! 蔍t's located in (I assume) a cutesy, historical part of Downtown Orange. 蔛o of course, the parking is horrible! .....especially if you're there on the weekend! 蔜hey do have a small parking lot which can probably hold about 3 cars!!! �We got the chicken and waffle and it was pretty good. 蔔ot really a fried chicken with crispy skin, but more like a chicken strip. 蔄lso got the waffle burger. � patties in a waffle. 蔖retty good but not worth $7!! 蔄lso got some nutella and banana, a root beer cane drink, and a strawberry shake. 蔛hake was $5!! �Again, the food wasn't bad, but for the price, I don't think I'll be back here again unless maybe I'm in the area.

Friendly staff and yummy food. Our plan was to hit up Roscoe's but I just didn't have it in me to make the drive. I turned to Yelp for an acceptable alternative and was not disappointed. Bruxie is a busy place at lunch time, with a line that wraps around the block. I waited patiently and it was worth it. I ordered the classic Chicken and Waffle Sandwich. The chicken was perfectly cooked and super moist. The chipotle honey didn't overpower the meal but added just the right amount of spicy to sweet ratio that is so hard to accomplish. Next time, I'll probably opt out of the cole slaw as I am a chicken and waffle purist but as far as cole slaws go, it was delish. I came back after my meal to pick up another sandwich to go for my boyfriend and found no line! Overall, a great and easy alternative to Roscoe's with nearly the same cult following.

I came here on a whim. And I am elated I did. It's a bit out of the way for most people, but the food here is amazing! One of the most popular waffles served are the Buttermilk Fried Chicken Waffles with Sweet Chili Sauce, coleslaw (and a side of Maple Syrup for an extra buck if you really want it). I had never tried the whole fried chicken and waffles thing, so i don't have anything to compare it to, but the chicken was perfectly cooked, (crispy on the outside, yet tender and juicy on the inside). The waffles were light, yet hearty and flavorful. The coleslaw actually adds a nice touch. And the sweet chili sauce is the perfect topping for this sweet and savory meal. Even if fried chicken and waffles aren't your thing, they have a large variety of other tasty waffle offerings to satisfy your sweet tooth.

I'm definitely a huge fan of Bruxie. This location is pretty small and is located on the corner of Glassel St. and Palm Ave. We arrived at this place at about 8:00PM on a Friday night, and was greeted with a LOOONNGGG line. However, the staff was all very friendly and the line moved through very quickly. I shared with the girlfriend a Turkey Club, Creme Brulee, and the Irish Nachos. The Turkey Club was good, but the highlight was the Creme Brulee. Definitely highly recommended! Seating was on outdoor benches and high tables. They have heat lamps surrounding the tables, for when it gets cold. It's a seat yourself situation. When your order is ready, the staff will call out your name and bring your order to your seat. One big complaint was how dark the outdoor seating area was. They really need to invest on some outdoor lights! The food overall was delicious, and its amazing how they were able to make something so simple, so darn delicious. I can honestly say it's one of the go to places to try out when you're in the OC area.

I was very spetical going into my sandwich experience. 蔅ut it surprised.... I ordered the Chicken and Waffle sandwich w/ syrup. �When in doubt order the first thing on the menu - it is the item the restaurant is the most proud of). The Chicken and Waffle contained the best flattened fried chicken breast I have ever had. 蔜he chicken had amazing spice and texture. 蔜he syrup adds a lit extra flavor, I recommend. 蔜he waffles are sweet and savory and the whole sandwhich somes together flawlessly. �The only complaint is that the slaw falls right off the sandwhich and it sort of pointless even though a little crunch in a sandwich is nice). I cannot wait to try another one of Bruxie's sandwiches!

Seriously. 蔍 love this place. 蔠e have to get at least 3 different sandwiches because the variety and deliciousness is that awesome. 蔛weet and crispy waffles make for amazing sweet and fruity desserts, but are every bit as amazing when stuffed with meat. 蔒y personal favorite is the pastrami, but they have daily specials that are almost without exception so very worth it. 蔍 can't wait until there's a new one down in SD, but I go here every time I go even remotely near it. 蔜he only downside I can think of is it commonly has lines around the block and parking is hard to find.

LOVE THE WAFFLE. But why I missed 1 star. NO PARKING AND YOU HAVE TO FIGHT FOR AND CLEAN YOUR OWN TABLE. Which i hate--the table I meant. I don't mind the walk from parking far away! We got bored with our routine lunch spots around Westminster and Huntington Beach. 蔠e decided to check this place out, since I mentioned it last year. 蔅ack then, my BFF talked me out of it by mentioning that there might not be any tables, no parking, and the line will be longer than the block. When we found the place, we were lucky to be behind just three groups. 蔍t was a hot day, but they had those mist-ers going so it wasn't bad. 蔍t took us about 10 minutes to reach the order counter. I had the waffle with green eggs and ham, very tasty and fresh pesto sauce.

Yay for Bruxie! Waffle chicken sandwich so good you'll beat your boyfriend for his . I seriously love this place . The waffle was crisp, fluffy and never got soggy after putting pure syrup all over 蔵t. The butter milk chicken was surely 蔮rine because it was moist and flavorful. 蔍ts a different concept to what I'm use to but it works because its sweet, savory, salty , crisp, and the smells are intoxicatingly delicious. The only thing is the parking can be difficult because its in a residential area and the line is long (for good reasons). 蔜he staff is friendly and gets your food out fast and 蕇teaming HOT.

***The waffle sundae at Bruxie was sweet, reasonably priced and a generous portion, but it would not be my favorite dessert (especially since their frozen custard was disappointing); still, I would probably come back to give their waffle and fried chicken sandwich a try*** Bruxie is a savory and sweet waffle stand in Orange. 蔜he stand, which features both savory and sweet concoctions as well as outdoor seating (almost picnic table style), reminded me of Dairy Queen locations I knew growing up. 蔠e went for dessert and I tried one of their waffle sundaes (topped with frozen custard). The waffle sundae featured a liege waffle topped with frozen custard, chocolate, caramel, whipped cream, and roasted peanuts. 蔜he sundae was big. 蔜here was also a lot of stuff on it even though none of it was really great. The whipped cream, chocolate and caramel were all standard stuff. 蔜he waffle was okay though I prefer a softer waffle to this one; this one had more of a crispy outside. 蔍 was also disappointed with the frozen custard. 蔍 think you are always going to lose something with soft serve instead of hand scooped, but I've had frozen custard soft serve that had more of a custard flavor. 蔜he frozen custard at Bruxie did not remind me of frozen custard at all. Service was quick and fine. Prices were reasonable. 蔣ou get a fairly big dessert for around $6 (more than enough for 2). I was not a huge fan of Bruxie's waffle sundae. 蔜he frozen custard was disappointing so I think you might be better off opting for one of their sweet, non-soft serve waffle creations instead. 蔍 am not sure if I would like any of their sweet waffles, but I might come back to give the waffle and fried chicken sandwich a try. We walked to this Bruxie so I am not sure if they have their own parking lot. 蔉ree street parking is available.

I've been wanting to take my boyfriend here for the longest time because he doesn't believe me when I say this place is on my top 5 list of favorite places to eat at. Parking is a hassle, mainly because people will sit down and eat and not really order to-go. I remember parking about a mile away and got a parking ticket for that, SO 蔄 BIG SCREW YOU TO THE CITY OF ORANGE. If we need parking permits to park on public property, maybe have some signs or something? Residents from other cities might end up having to pay $60 for a stupid ticket. Asides from my anger and resentment over that, the food here will add a BIG smile to your face. Prices are reasonable and I will probably be going tomorrow because writing this review makes me hungry for Bruxie's.

My first trip to Bruxie did not go well. 蔍 had ordered a 'Green Eggs and Ham' and was told that they were out of pesto and whether mayo would be okay. 蔔ot wanting to make a fuss with a long line behind me, I said sure. 蔛omehow, what got delivered was the 'Bacon, Egg and Cheddar' but still charged the higher 'Green Eggs and Ham' price. 蔅y the time I realized the error, the line had grown ridiculous and I didn't want to deal with it for 50 cents. However, the delicious, peppery waffle-cut fries, amazing buttermilk waffles (light, crisp, and very importantly NOT sweet), and the black cherry soda drew me back for a second shot. 蔜his time, to avoid the ham vs bacon debacle altogether, I went with the 'Hot Pastrami Bruxie'. 蔛uper thin slices, a bit on the salty side, but otherwise delicious. 蔜he slaw and the picles provide really good, contrasting flavors that cut through the richness of the pastrami and gruyere. The location is small with limited outdoor seating and it gets crowded fast, even at off-peak hours. 蔜he layout really isn't great for handling larger numbers of customers. 蔜he staff is also highly dependent on who you get. 蔒y first visit, the orderer and server were both pretty meh. 蔜he second trip, both were very friendly. 蔖rices are very fair. If my generally mediocre first experience turns out to be the exception rather than the rule, I'll bump up Bruxie a star. 蔋owever, the food has been very good every time. 蔈ven when they got my order wrong, it was still delicious.

I get the hype.................but I don't. My boyfriend brought me here for a post Farmer's Market lunch. He was super excited because he had been talking about Bruxie for weeks, craving the thick and generous waffle goodness he remembered savoring a year prior. We ordered & then began creeping and peeping the tables to see who was about to leave. 蔍f you're here on a Sunday or on any other peak hour or day, wiggle room is gonna be tight. Our food arrived and the expression on both our faces went from excited to disappointed. There were waffles, but where was the filling to actually qualify it as a sandwich? We opened "the bold fold" to inspect. Okay, there was stuff, but not nearly enough. Took a bite. Eh. I looked over at my boyfriend who was chewing slowly. "Is it good?," I asked. He shook his head "no". The lady sitting next to us only ate a 1/4 of her sandwich. One of the workers passed by to collect trash and asked her what was wrong. She told him that her burger was not tasty. He walked away for a few minutes, but returned and let her know that the manager said she could have any sandwich on the house to take home. �So....I don't know. Our food was not so exciting, but the customer service was good. In conclusion, I'm not sure how I feel. I'm giving Bruxie 3 stars, but that's being generous. At least the neighborhood around it is cute and pleasant to stroll through.

A foodie friend of mine recommended-- no, insisted-- that I eat at Bruxie. I had always passed it driving to work, seeing all these too-cool, hipster, college kids lined up outside, and I wondered, "what is this, and why are there so many people lined up for sandwiches?" I understood the craze once I bit into their mushroom waffle sandwich. The waffle itself is surprisingly light and crispy, and not sweet, like you'd expect from a waffle, so it's paired well with the savory insides. The waffle is buttery and delicious. I usually eat pretty slowly, and I nearly swallowed this thing whole, it was so good. Now, I have to resist the urge to stop by and grab a sandwich while on my way to work. Anytime a friend comes to town to visit, I take them there. No questions asked, this is what I show off to friends when they wonder "what's good to eat out here?" And they usually leave full-bellied, amazed, and quite jealous because they don't have a Bruxie in their town/state. It's my mission this year to try each sandwich once. :) So far, my favorites have been the Bruxie burger, the smoked salmon with dill cream cheese, and the tuna sandwich. The fried chicken sandwich comes with a sweet/spicy sauce that is unbelievably good. They also make their own sodas and milkshakes. If you're in a rush, it's not recommended that you stop here. The line is usually pretty long, but you may get lucky and find a short line. Just keep in mind that it's not fast food.

I've been wanting to try this place for a while so I was ecstatic that my friend suggested it as our lunch spot (I guess I could've gone anytime by myself but I'm too lazy to drive out to Orange just for a meal unless there's a specific reason). We shared the buttermilk fried chicken & waffle ($6.95), Bruxie burger ($6.95), waffle fries ($2.50 as combo or $2.95 by itself), and split a mocha shake ($5.25). 蔐ike some fellow Yelpers have mentioned, the waffle is not one of those honking ones that you see at other restaurants smothered in fruit syrup and whipped cream. 蔍t's relatively smaller and thinner, yet fluffy and worked great in place of sandwich bread. Their signature buttermilk fried chicken & waffle was pretty good. 蔔ot too sweet, just enough tartness from the cole slaw and a mild kick from the chili honey. 蔜he Bruxie burger was just okay (tasted like a regular burger). 蔠e had to split the shake because it's pretty big, especially if ordering other food items (they kindly split it for us). The food and service were great, but there are a few minor things to consider if coming here: *There always seems to be a line (come early or off-hours) *It's a small stand with limited outdoor seating (come early or off-hours) *No restroom (can probably use Chapman U's if open) *A combo (sandwich + fries + soda) can easily total $15 *It's heavy food (I got heartburn, but I'd still eat it again)

I had heard so much about this place that now that I am working in the Circle, I had to check it out. 蔝nfortunately for me, it did not live up to the hype. 蔍 am not a fan of standing in line in front of a shack, getting H20 from a general population cooler and due to no seating (even after 1 pm), standing at a dirty spot and eating my food. 蔐uckily I did not have to go the bathroom - because there isn't one. 蔍 wonder where the staff goes or where they wash their hands? Don't get me wrong. 蔍 like creativity with cuisine and I believe Bruxie has a unique concept. 蔍n addition, the servers are super friendly and will take your order beforehand. 蔋owever, why don't they put the order in with the preparer vs simply giving you your ticket and you still wait in line and give the cashier the ticket when you pay? I ordered the pastrami and gruyere cheese sandwich (pic), and by the looks of the pic Bruxie is sticking its tongue at me saying, "SUCKA" ;P for coming here and paying $7.95 (the pickles look like a tongue sticking out-lol). �The sandwich was nothing special. 蔣es, it has Boars Head meat. 蔋owever, there was not much meat and there was grease drippinng out of the sandwich. 蔍 was not impressed at all. My rating is 2.5 stars, because "like a sucka", I will come back and try their signature burger. 蔍 also heard that the pulled pork is good. 蔅ruxie, unlike a bad date, I will give you a second chance.

Waffles sandwiches?! Why didn't anyone think about this sooner? Definitely interesting... I tried their buttermilk fried chicken & waffle. The honey waffle complimented the fried chicken very well. The waffle was very crispy and full of flavor. But the cole slaw made it a little soggy, so you better think twice about waiting for your friends order to finish... They have a wide variety of waffle sandwiches, but pay close attention to their weekly specials. They don't last long. Order your sandwich with a side of their awesome waffle fries! They were very light and Must come back for their Liege waffles and sundaes!

FInally got a chance to get to the original Bruxie! I've already reviewed the one in Brea, so I'll stick to what I saw/ate/experienced at THIS location. �FOOD - Delicious. 蔇id you expect anything less? 蔒y choice was the simple Cheesy Bruxie (Tillamook and Gruyere cheese) where you can add on avocado, bacon, ham, etc (for a small fee). 蔍 also ordered the waffle fries. 蔍 was happy with everything I ordered. 蔒y friends got the Angus Burger (she loved it) and the other got the Turkey Club (she said it was a little soggy...but she polished it off quickly). 蔄ll were happy. 蔕h, and who could forget the seasonal strawberry lemonade they have? �SERVICE - Prompt... for how busy it was. 蔜he line was down the street. 蔠e waited about 5-10 minutes to order. 蔔ot too bad. 蔜hey took orders quickly and got the food out ASAP. 蔍f you looked inside, you saw tons of people in that small little space working frantically. 蔜hey're definitely earning their paychecks here. 蔈veryone was friendly and helpful. �PRICE - This is where I take off a star. 蔜his place can get a tad bit pricey. 蔉or my sandwich alone, it was $4.95. That didn't include any add-ons. 蔜he fries are $2.50 alone. 蔄dd on a $2.50 soda/other drink, and that'll put you over the $10 with tax. 蔄nd if you want a dessert waffle, to share, you'll be at around $15. �Not somewhere I'd travel to regularly, but I do love the idea of this place. 蔄nd with SO MANY options around (and for cheaper prices)... service makes a huge difference. 蔜hey're spot on in this category - and I'm sure that's why so many people come back.

I guess this Bruxie is cool because it's the OG Bruxie (I had only been the Brea Bruxie prior to this). Food-wise, it tastes the same as the other Bruxie. My fave is definitely the roasted mushrooms, arugula, balsamic vinaigrette and goat cheese waffle sandwich. So good. And you have to top it with a generous helping of Sriracha Rooster Hot Sauce. It comes down to a little less than $9 with tax. Again, so good. The downside is it's pretty light, so you do get hungry soon afterwards. The cool thing about this location is it's located in DT Orange. It's right across the street from Chapman University and down the street from the Orange Circle and Haven Gastropub, etc. So it's not super lively because Orange is pretty dead and night and Bruxie closes relatively early (there are also people's homes nearby), but you get your fair share of customers (mostly college students). For cool summer nights like these, this Bruxie is nice to eat at. Note that it is all completely outdoors, so it must be weather permitting. I just prefer the Brea location more because it's 1/2 indoors, 1/2 outdoors and overall just a nicer, newer restaurant. But again, that's what you get for being OG.

Yeah, yeah... so the chicken and waffle sandwich is good and all, but I am here to let you all know that the Wisconsin Frozen Custard here is the real deal. Excellent creamy, fatty goodness. Worth every penny. $2.75 for a small, which was a very generous portion big enough to share. They have floats and shakes, too. Crispy, tasty waffles, excellent, helpful service. Radical. Next time I'm getting the green eggs and ham. I think I would like them here. As for the parking, I was able to grab a spot in the lot on a weekday morning without a problem. I could see how it could get crazy on a weekend, especially when there is a game at the nearby stadium.

DAMN they have LIEGE waffles here!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! To fulfill my liege fix, I have to stalk a food truck and that can get annoying... I came here with a friend around 9 pm, no line, which was great. We ordered the Liege Sundae....and my life changed... I found my new liege waffle spot. Liege waffles are amazing and hard to find! they have caramelized sugar in the batter, making the waffle a little more firm and just delicious! the flavor surpasses all other waffles by miles. The liege waffle is topped with ice cream, whipped cream, chocolate sauce, caramel sauce andddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddd?d candied pecans! YEP! makes all the difference. Prices are very reasonable and the service is great. Outdoor seating only. LOVE.

Bruxie is one of the best things ever created. Excellent service. All the workers are very friendly. Food is delicious and well cooked. I always get the chicken and waffles and it never fails to satisfy me. Nice environment. They even have cool most blowing for those hot days. Anyway fuck yeah. If you're visiting California, you can't turn this place down.

I had the good fortune of having lunch here on a Saturday with my family. It was crowded and the line was crazy long but it went really quick. We shared both savory and sweet items. Fried chicken & waffle - It's a perfectly fried moist chicken breast sandwiched between two crispy waffle halves, served with coleslaw and a sweet chili thai type of sauce on the side. GOT DANG it was good! I ate the whole dang thing and I didn't even feel bad doing it. Next time, I'm going to order it with the maple syrup, not the sauce. S'mores waffle - Think of a melty, chocolatey, marshmallowy, crispy waffle sandwich. Ahhhhh sweet chocolate goodness! I'll be honest - I was seriously planning to swipe the entire thing from my sister to eat it all myself, but we were in public so I didn't want to embarrass myself. Chocolate liege - It's a belgian waffle filled with chunks of chocolate in the batter, sprinkled with more of the choc-chunks on top, drizzled with chocolate sauce and spritzed with whipped cream. The chocolate chips got a little carmelized during the cooking process, which tasted AWESOME. Even though the size of it was slightly disappointing, it was mmm-mmmm good! Nutella and banana waffle - Not a fan of bananas but the nutella was delish. I heard they change their menu frequently and I am looking forward to going back and experiencing more of their heavenly waffles!

One of my favorite places to go to when I'm only 65% hungry. It's a small joint located in a neighborhood corner near downtown Fullerton, adjacent to Chapman University. Good date spot? Yes. My date and I spent a Valentine's Day here one year as he introduced me to this place. A casual hangout where we can just be ourselves and not get all dressed up, the heated lamps and fire stoves kept us warm as we hungout there for hours. The only downside is that they close at 10PM, so this is not a place to go to for late night drunk munchies. The 5 items you must try: 1.The Smoked Salmon Waffle Sandwich: the waffle is always cooked to the perfect crunch, the salmon was fresh, if you're into cream cheese you'd love this, and there are also chopped green scallions to top it off 2.Chicken Waffle Sandwich: perfect combination of saltiness from the chicken and waffle dipped in a sweet honey sauce; it's like eating pretzels dipped in chocolate, but in a meal form 3.Side of criss-cut fries: a bit on the salty side and the portion size was too small for a fry-lover like me, but so tasty I sometimes have to get 2 orders 4.Hot Chocolate: personally not a fan of dark chocolate, but it added a nice contrast to all the sweet tastes, and a normal sweetened hot chocolate might have just tipped the meter of sweetness, making this drink a savory addition to the meal 5.Creme Br瀕巈 Waffle Sandwich: no matter how full you are, you must get this!!! fresh strawberries and custard with a coat of burnt caramel sugar fill the inside of the unsweetened belgian waffle. perfection

Bruxie never disappoints! Always a go to place and I recommend it to all my friends. The staff is always helpful and courteous and the food is fantastic. I personally love the tuna melt and salmon dill folds. Their pure sugar cane sodas are bomb. I don't drink soda but I'll drink those! Gotta try it at least once! The new Brea location is just as good if not better!

This place is amazing. It's always busy, the lines are long most of the time, you will have trouble finding a place to sit, and you will have an amazing time. I love going here and you may see me standing in a line here on a sunday morning. I love eating the roasted mushroom bruxie. I came here today on my day off for lunch and I had a great time. The strawberry lemonade really is delicious. I would recommend taking anyone here, as they have food for everyone. The staff is courteous and friendly. They zoom around the place and there is even free water outside for you to help yourself to on a hot day. The waffles are very delicious and I would recommend it to anyone.

I work extremely close to this place and have never gone here til my friend advertised this place to me, and I am glad she did! Waffles with food in the middle. When first I read the menu, I thought "Hmm...Chicken and Waffles? Roscoe's? Ooo different items to try with waffles. Interesting..." My friends and I came here after The Color Run. There was a really long line, but I have to admit, it was worth the wait. I had 3 other friends with me, and it was our first time here. So, we all decided to each order something different to try a bit of everything. We had the: Smoked Salmon & Dill Cream Cheese $7.95 -Ever had a Philadelphia Sushi Roll? Well this definitely tasted like it. They didn't put enough smoked salmon in it. Great for a snack, but not for lunch. Turkey Club $8.95 -Not bad. Can't go wrong with this one. Carolina BBQ Pulled Pork with Slow-Roasted Pork, Cheddar Cheese, Cider Slaw and our own Bruxie BBQ Sauce (SPECIAL so it's a limited time item!!) $8.95 -I know why it's a specialty!! They do not skimp out on the pulled pork and sauce. Definitely a must have. Hot Pastrami Bruxie $7.95 -WOW Super yummy! I usually dislike pastrami. Actually, I hated pastrami. I like to try something at least twice before I rule it out completely...so, I tried it here. The pastrami was not too salty and super juicy! A lot of meat stuffed in middle of the waffle. (mm...craving this right now...) This place is worth standing in line for. People who work here go to you and ask if you have any questions about the menu. Friendly and they reassure that it's worth the wait. After you order, the food comes out quicker than you know it! Try everything on the menu!! You will not be sorry.

Waffle sandwich? Genius! Another great place to go if you want to avoid buying overpriced Disneyland food. Ordered the chicken and waffle sandwich, the prosciutto, the cheese, and the lemon creme and berries. Chicken sandwich was overhyped in my opinion. I liked the prosciutto waaaay better. The cheese was nothing to rave about..just ordered it for my kids cause they love anything with cheese. The lemon n berry dessert was yummy, but too tart for my taste. Really wish I tried the crembrulee! Guess that'll have to wait til next time.. PS they use peanut oil for their fries and chicken so people with allergies beware!

Better than ROSCOE'S? 蔄fter hearing from my friends from work and reading the many fellow Yelpers raving that the chicken and waffles are better, I had to let my taste buds see for itself. 蔍 was around The Outlets @ Orange and had the munchies. 蔠e got there around 4 p.m. and found curb parking easily and there was shockingly no line and ordered and got our food instantly. 蔍 was bummed that they were out of the Irish nachos but we ordered the Chicken & Waffle, waffle fries, and a strawberry lemonade. The Chicken & Waffle was good, but I believe it's not comparible to Roscoe's since it's not an entree and more in the league of a hipper Chick-fil-A with a lil more swag. The waffle was light and toasty. 蔜he chicken was smaller than I anticipated but nevertheless the inside was moist and the outside was crispy. The waffle fries were PERFECTION..cooked in peanut oil, crunchy and were cut in generous sizes. I washed it down with the strawberry lemonade. �It was a bit sweet (my girl added a little water) but it quenched my thirst. My first experience was worth it, for the friendly customer service was top notch and I was impressed with the overall quality of the food. 蔍 dig the Waffle Inspired Shop and will definitely return to conquer more items on the menu.

First Trip to Bruxie seems great!! 蔈rrr, but not perfect. (I mean it's not 100% awesome for the food as i would expect, i will say 85%) I sorry to say that maybe I think i just over expect. I still give u guys Five Stars cuz that's not u guys' fault. It's my first time for Bruxie on this Tuesday. I went there in the afternoon. There were only couple people wait in lane not as many as i thought. People who works there are really nice. A handsome guy gave me several advises on the food i would go for. By taking hes advisement, I got Fried Chicken & Waffle, Seasonal Creme Brulee. I should never take it for TOGO. The food lost huge "tasty" on the way back to Rowland Heights, specially for the Waffle. Again, NEVER TOGO is a very important Tips to share with you people who wants to try Bruxie. I plan to try dine in next week. see you guys later, Bruxie OC

Waffles instead of bread?? Who thinks of this stuff?? Geniuses... Food: 1) Chicken and Waffles: The fried chicken was well flavored and not excessively greasy. The waffle was crispy on the outside and pretty soft and chewy on the inside. Overall, pretty well made. 2) Cheeseburger waffle sandwich: Not a fan. The patty was pretty good but it just tasted funny with a waffle. The spread was tasty though, but otherwise, I wasn't a huge fan of the flavor combo. Service: Very nice. They even made an effort to walk around and ask everyone how their meal is going even though they were super slammed and so busy! Bravo! Ambiance: Order and sit outside. The stools and tables are pretty clean. They put up a nice wall of mist which is nice on a hot day. I like how they decorated the outside of the restaurant like a waffle. Overall: I'm glad I tried it, but I probably won't go back. Not really my style of food, but I love the idea! Worth a try if you are into exploring food! Downside: Parking is pretty awful there, especially if you go during lunch time!

The 4-star rating is for the good service and good food, but let's start off with the negatives.

Other than that, this place is great. 蔄long with the friendly service, the food is really good. 蔒y personal favorites are the waffle sandwiches with salmon and some other egg one with pesto. 蔜he fries are great, too. �The tea is also good.

This place is always packed, so naturally I had to come check it out. I went around 9:30pm on a Thursday, which was perfect because hardly anyone was there. The guy who took my order was friendly and tried to make small talk. I ordered the Fried Chicken and Waffle. Sadly, I was not impressed. The waffle was good, but the chicken had a weird flavor to it. Kinda tasted like it had some Mary Jane in it and was not at all crispy. I wasn't crazy about the syrup and ended up using good ol' Aunt Jemima (to go order). However, there is light at the end of the tunnel. My boyfriend ordered the Bruxie Burger and that was http://bomb.com. The meat was tender and juicy. The waffle complemented the burger well. We also ordered the criss cut fries, which were equally dericious. Not greasy at all.

Insane....absolutely insane!! How and WHY did it take this long for someone to come up with the idea of replacing a bun with a waffle?? This place drives me wild... -1st of all...im confused...is this breakfast or is this lunch...or is this dinner food? -2nd of all...I got a crispy waffle as a bun! this is outrageous! -3rd of all...so unhealthy...but yet so delicious! Parking may be a hassle around the area for it is a stand at a corner & there is only outdoor seating for this location -_____- I ordered the: -buttermilk chicken and waffle -irish nachos Delicious! The first few bites are the best because of the freshness and crispness. Warning! You must eat what you order AT THE RESTAURANT...getting orders to-go is a NO NO! WHY?

Love this place! I've been going here since they've opened and to the Brea store also. I've had almost all their sandwiches/waffles (sandwaffles? waffiches?) and the only one that's disappointed me, well not really me but my friends because they're the ones that ordered it, was the salmon waffle. Other than that everything about Bruxie's is great. They have the nicest service, and despite them not having much parking or that much seats. It's not really too much of a hassle to just park at a public parking area down the street and order them to go and just eat at your car now is it? My recommendations are the chicken waffle, the waffle burger, and if you can the irish nachos! Their prosciutto and gruyere are also great and keep an eye on their daily specials. There's a reason why they're specials!

When my friend suggested that we eat here, I must admit I was fairly skeptical. I mean, I've done the chicken and waffles thing several times now and I haven't been the hugest fan. Mostly because I'm not a fan of the savory-sweet marriage in your mouth. I prefer my savory and my sweet separate but equal. But onto Bruxie. I drove past the place and there was a long line. Good sign. I checked out the menu and partly because of how hungry I was but mostly because of the menu, my mouth was watering. Another good sign. We decided on the Pastrami Bruxie and the Buttermilk Fried Chicken and Waffles. The pastrami comes with Boar's Head pastrami, house cole slaw, spicy brown mustard and pickles. It was surprisingly good. The meat was moist and paired perfectly with the heat of the mustard. I do wish the waffle was a bit more crispy but I enjoy my carbs toasted, perhaps more toasted than the next person. The Buttermilk Fried Chicken is hands-down their most popular waffle sandwich. So this is where my UNpreference for sweet-savory comes in. The chicken has some sort of honey on top which just threw me off a little but I guess that's the "maple syrup" that ties the waffle and the chicken together. Chicken was perfectly fried and very moist. However I felt it was missing some heat so I added Cholula and all was right in the world again. Finally, we had the creme br瀕巈 Bruxie too. I think it might be a little of a misnomer in terms of no sugar was torched in the making of this Bruxie but it was nonetheless delicious. All in all, get ready to be messy. The juices drip all over your hands but as Carl's Jr. used to say, "If it doesn't get all over the place, it doesn't belong in your face." So grab some instant hand sanitizer (they have some for you) and dig in. You'll be pleasantly surprised and you'll probably be back for more. I know I will be.

OMGGGGGGGGGGGG ITS SOOOOO GOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOD!!!!! Had the buttermilk chicken and waffle with chili honey, waffle fries and for dessert, liege waffles. Chicken was crunchy goood and waffle was delicious and when you can taste the chili honey even better!

Dude, it's just chicken and waffles, how good can it be? 蔜hat's what I though before I tried it. One of the first things that puts this sandwich over the top for me is the way the chicken is moist, juicy and flavorful all the way through. 蔍'm not sure if it's sage, savory, thyme, or what, but the spices they use on their chicken are bomb. 蔍t's also light and crispy on the outside, but not overly salty (which is a bit of a turn-off for me). 蔜he waffle is light and crispy, but still tender on the inside, which is a perfect domestic partner with the fried chicken. 蔠hen you order the chicken and waffles (because you HAVE to try it at least once) make sure you add the Vermont maple syrup. 蔠e forgot, but asked for it after the fact, and it came in this airplane alcohol sized bottle that you can keep if you so choose. We went here during a visit to Disneyland. 蔍t's about a 10-15 minute drive from the park, but sooo worth it. 蔣ou will pay LESS than what you would in the park for a meal, AND the food is 100X better!! 蔇on't worry, your parking pass allows you to re-enter without having to pay the ridiculous $15 again. OH, and I almost forgot! 蔍 went on my birthday (and was wearing my "happy birthday" pin from Dland), and the guy taking my order saw it and gave me a small serving of their frozen custard gratis! 蔜otally made my day, thanks Bruxie!!

I really like this place. It is right in the area of Chapman University. It is a little stand that had outside seating. It was hot outside but they had misters. The only reason that it received four stars instead of five is due to the service at the ordering area. I had to repeat my order three times, and they still got it wrong. I ordered two of the buttermilk combos with syrup, not too difficult, yet I only received one. Once it was cleared up, they gave me a brand new one along with a new one for the missing one. The rest of the service was impeccable. The food was great, not greasy at all. The slaw in the sandwich was great, and the chicken was moist. The waffle was light and fluffy. The waffle fries were delicious. I will definitely be returning

No one who lives in orange actually goes to Bruxie. There is way too much hype about this place! Waffle sandwiches are a great concept, but Bruxie is WAY overpriced and you have to stand in line way too long to get your food. If you want some good food, skip Bruxie and go to Rutas!

I knew it was a sign when I got a parking spot right in front. I drove here with the intention of getting a sampler to go home and try with the family. After quizzing the young counter girl, I decided to start with the famous fried chicken waffle. Then I added the special of the month, the pulled pork waffle. I took the customary pictures upon arrival, but suddenly there were two empty baskets at my table. OMG I ate both of them! The chicken was my favorite with it's crispy, tender chicken breast drizzed with both a sweet honey Thai inspired syrup and maple syrup. The waffle is very light and crispy, yet substantial enough to hold its innards! (Bet you won't be able to hold yours!) Tips: Only eat one waffle to save room for the decadent frozen custard shakes. Ask for the waffle you take home to be deconstructed...if it makes it!

Found out about this place through a couple of my buddies that kept on raving about this place. 蔄fter hearing about this and reading some of the reviews here i decided to try it out despite the fact that i live about 40mins away. Location: The location of this place is kinda easy to find...parking however can be a pain in the ass. 蔐uckily for me, i came on a rare Saturday morning when it wasnt busy and i was able to get one of the 6 parking spots available in the lot. 蔒y friend on the other hand had to park on the street. Food: I ordered the Bacon, Egg & Cheddar Waffle Sandwhich and the Nutella and Bananas. 蔄ll i have to say in regards to the food is WOW...despite getting a vaguely simple Bacon, Egg & Cheddar i was actually surprised by how good this was and how the sweet waffle complimented the saltiness of the bacon. The Nutella and Bananas was amazingly delicious and by the time i was finished with it, i was tempted to get another one...lol...this is def a must try if you like Nutella. I will def be back to try more stuff on their menu including the Buttermilk Fried Chicken and Waffle. 蔍m just a little disappointed that i didnt try this place earlier when i was living in Orange County...but then again id prob gain 100lbs coming here that often...lol

[2nd update from my 06/05/11] Review Okay, so I gave Bruxie 4.5 stars before because of their 100% peanut oil which my brothers' are allergic to. I took him today and I asked which ones are cooked in Peanut Oil, the employee had told me it was just their fries and chicken, so WHEW! I was so excited that my brother would have no problem ordering anything on the menu except their chicken and waffle or anyone of them that had fries in their sandwiches, but that would be easy to fix! �p I also noticed that they had added the Green Eggs and Ham on their regular menu now, it wasn't before. My brothers and cousin loved bruxie, they wish there was one in Oxnard, haha! They especially enjoyed the Strawberries Creme Brulee which is my personal fav. I get it every time :)

What can I say about Bruxie that no one else has? Not much. 蔍ts amazing! 蔉ind the nearest location and go. Don't think about it...just go! 蔒y favorite so far was the patty melt, the pulled pork is a close second. 蔕h and the shakes? OMG the strawberry is so so so good. Parking at the Orange location sucks, there are only 3 parking spots. But there is plenty of street parking.

From the perspective of someone who had to drive from Los Angeles...totally not worth it! And, I've come up with a theory. Places that are located near University campuses have deceiving reviews! Don't get me wrong, it's good, but it's not great! I really like that it wasn't overbearing. The waffle was light and fluffy and wasn't sweet at all. Ended up getting the chicken and waffles which was pretty bomb being complimented with the juicy chicken. The mushroom and goat cheese bruxie was way yummier though! The flavors complimented each other but everyone pairs mushroom, goat cheese, and arugula. The waffle fries were good, but I was also dying of starvation, freakin' dirt would've tasted good too! Not worth the drive, but if you open one in LA, I'll probably go again.

My friend and I decided to try the burger waffle since we'd figure the fried chicken and waffles was something we rather get at roscoes. Anyways, we ordered that, a strawberry shake, and waffle fries. Service wasn't bad but finding seating was terrible! Luckily, we found two seats on the right side of the place. Food came out pretty quick. Shake was eh...Sonics is better...it was more milk based barely tasted the strawberries. The waffle fries were pretty good, at you can't really mess up there. And the burger was ordinary... Overall, I think it's pretty overrated.

WACK! WACK! WACK! WAAACCCKKK! This place was definitely not what I was expecting! I'm guessing all these good reviews are from local students who eat here daily. My friend and I drove all the way from LA to eat here, expecting something amazing and full of flavor for only a few bucks...totally NOT worth the drive! We ordered the mushroom and goat cheese bruxie and the popular buttermilk chicken and waffle. Seriously, don't be fooled by the pictures, it looks good, but it definitely doesn't taste as good as it looks. The waffle alone was pretty good, fluffy and not too sweet, but the chicken didn't really have much flavor. It was a skinny piece of battered chicken breast slapped in between a waffle with some sweet and oily sauce on top. I was extremely hungry, so I ate it. However, that was only after I drenched it with hot sauce to actually give it some flavor. The mushroom and goat cheese bruxie was pretty good actually. Not too many complaints about that one. It had the perfect amount of ingredients and lots of flavor. I was really expecting more from this place because of the great reviews, but never again would I take the time to drive to Orange for one of this sandwiches. Maybe the sweet sandwiches are better, but i'd stay away from the savory ones if I were you. Oh, and the prices, not as cheap as I thought. It was your typical $7 sandwich.

Ok so I am a hater. I hate this hipster trendy jackwagon depot now that I have been here. It is extremely disappointing to me, no it is dead to me. I drive past and all I can think is look at all of these lemmings. PRO TIP: Park on the street, they have like 8 slots in their parking lot So lets see the food was ok. I got a chicken waffle sandwich and ended up very lucky that I am a well prepared for anything kind of dad. Well, the chicken waffle sandwich comes with a honey to drizzle over it and its infused with some flavors to change things up a bit. This is a good thing. The bad thing is that they dont have a bathroom or sink to wash up afterwards at. WTF!!! you expect ppl eating honey based grub with their hands to use paper napkins to clean up??? Are you a bunch of frigging idiots? PRO TIP #2: Bring a bunch of baby wipes or wet naps. Otherwise anticipate you will be covered in sticky honey sauce! Seating is all outdoor picnic table or wall bar style. You may want to use your wet naps on your seat and the table as well! they were sticky as can be for me. My friend who I met for lunch here got a salad and it was very expensive and didnt give her very much food (lettuce even) for the amount she paid. My food was average. I didnt think it was all that, let alone worth the cost that they charged. Its a very disappointing situation to be honest. PRO TIP #3: If you must endure a meal here, use the restroom before you come here! I think its primary reason for having been made such a trendy place is two-fold. Location and location. Its right next to Chapman University and its on the edge of the Orange Circle! So yeah if you are a hipster, like paying too much for too little, and being expected to be an animal, bring your bootie over here. If you are a little bit more intelligent, I doubt you will like this place that much...

Service was great. Very friendly. Parking is hard to find though. And if you don't come during odd eating hours (10:30, 3pm, etc) it'll be hard to find a seat. I had the chicken and waffle sandwich with a side of crisscut fries. It was pretty good. I'm not going to say that this place was jaw-dropping amazing, but it wasn't bad. The waffles themselves were really good. One of the best waffles I've ever had. But the chicken was a bit dry. I was expecting something along the lines of Roscoe's Chicken and Waffles in waffle sandwich-form, but I was mistaken. No sweet, succulent chicken breast here. Nope. The sweet syrup on the inside of the sandwich was honey, I believe, which they put very little of. I came here with a Roscoe's bias, which was a bad thing to do. I guess I was used to the chicken-waffle-maple syrup combination. The crisscut fries were alright too. All in all, I guess if I really wanted waffles, I'll stop by. But if I'm craving chicken and waffles, I'll head over to Roscoe's instead.

Food: Delicious Parking: Horrible Price: Meh Service: Good The bruxie burger is delicious but the fries are really amazing. Mushroom with goat cheese is delicious but don't get the sun-dried tomatoes. Bad decision and it doesn't really go with the rest of the sandwich. After a while, I found myself getting a bit of taste fatigue because of the goat cheese though :\ Smoked salmon was delicious :) Strawberry lemonade is good but not show stopping. Parking is awful. Neighborhood parking isn't an option because it requires a permit... though there are certain streets you CAN park on. Read your signs! No bathrooms. Price is a bit steep for what you're getting, but meh, I think it's worth it. Outside seating only! Overall 4/5. Don't go on a cold day unless you want to eat in your car.

Yum Yum Yum! Is all i got to say! I would come here more often if i lived near by! Things i tried: Chicken and Waffle: Delicious! It's better than Roscoes! The meat is tender and flavorful and the waffle was so fresh. Angus Burger: This one was okay but not bad. The meat however, was delicious! Cooked to perfection with a delicious flavor. Belgian Fries: This was okay, nothing really stood out from it. Cute outdoor atmosphere. Great for a date. Great service. Great food. Price is relatively cheap. I would totally come back and try other items on the menu.

Move over Bobby Flay. I think we found a new contender for a Throwdown--Best Waffle Sandwiches! Now I have to warn you, Bruxie is fierce. And you know that they're going to bring their A-game because there's always a line. My cousin and I visited Bruxie on a gloomy Saturday morning and despite the light rain, there was a line circling the parking lot! Definitely has to be legit if customers are willing to eat outside with crying clouds. 蔛eating under the canopy is limited, but the food is totally worth every bite as sweet and savory dishes were 蔱pic. We salivated over the Weekend Specials, and had to order one of each- Hash & Egg, and Shortrib. 蔅oth were fantastic and the crispy yet fluffy waffle went perfectly with the robust flavors of the proteins. 蔝pon finishing our waffle sandwiches our stomachs were full, but one look at a neighbors dessert creation and we went straight back in line. 蔜he Strawberry Cheesecake and the Smore Waffles were devine. The Smore was rich and decadent as the dark chocolate melted into the graham crackers and toasted marshmellow. 蔇efinitely a crowd pleaser. And the cheesecake... oh the cheesecake. Light, cold, hot... if you want a tease this will make your tongue twist. Many menu items rotate so be sure to try them out before the season changes!

After getting yelled at for being negative (you married guys will understand), I went back and gave it another try. Still not convinced it's as good as the reviews (or what the ball and chain says). Staff is great but I did not finish my chicken and waffle (yes, with maple syrup). �The waffle was mushy and the chicken bland. Plus it had a weird after taste that made me dread not being near a commode. No eruptions, but it did taste funny.

Finally got to try this place after hearing all the hype. Their parking lot is non existent, but luckily Bruxie is nestled in a residential area so we parked on a street nearby. Came on a Saturday afternoon and there was a line, but the wait wasn't too long. Ordered the Buttermilk Fried Chicken & Waffle, Bruxie Burger and Prosciutto & Gruyere (cause we fancy). Buttermilk Fried Chicken & Waffle is like a modern version chicken and waffles, they also add a bit of honey to the chicken to make it a little sweet, which I don't mind. The Bruxie burger was yummy, the meat was nice and tender but I don't think the waffles were thick enough to hold the patty, but still good! The Prosciutto & Gruyere was super slim and tiny compared to the other two, but surprisingly delicious! It was a different taste from the other too but still savory and good. I would definitely come back here to try the other things on their menu like some of the sweet waffles and frozen custard!

I was skeptical at first because I have never had chicken and waffles before. I didn't really know what to expect, so I just ordered the Fried Chicken and Waffle sandwich. They had a lot of stuff on the menu: savory and sweet dishes. All of the items sounded gourmet and delicious. I think the prices are relatively cheap and fair. The sandwich was AMAZING. The first thing I noticed was, "This chicken is crazy white." Probably the leanest, juiciest, and cleanest fried chicken I have ever eaten. The sauce they serve with it is pretty good. It's like sweet and sour chili sauce but is not as viscous, thus the sauce spreads easy on the fried chicken.

Anytime is a good time for waffles, especially at Bruxie! My coworker introduced me to this heaven on earth eatery a few months ago. I ordered the chicken & waffle and got the strawberry lemonade. It was so good! The second time we went here, I ordered the smoked salmon and dill cream cheese. Yummy! Both are really good and tasty! Their strawberry lemonade is so thirst quenching, perfect for a summer day or evening, actually anytime! Those students at Chapman are so lucky to have such an amazing place to eat. The meal is enough to fill you up. I love that the Orange location is outdoors and it is so cute...reminds me of the Fenton's in the Disney movie "Up". It's small and cute. Love that they spray mist during the warm days so that their customers stay cool. This place gets pretty busy during the weekend, especially during lunch time, so make sure to come early. It also helps to order together. Very friendly staff and crowd that come here. Very chill place to hang out. I am so glad they are opening a location in RSM!

The chicken and walfle here tastes better than Roscoe's in my opinion. Adding maple syrup to the sandwich is a must! I also tried the pulled pork; tastes okay. Nicely located near the Orange Circle and Chapman University. There's only outside sitting, which is nice provided that it's in Southern California.

This place is delicious! Who would have thought to make a sandwich using waffles? This was one of my destination eating places during my LA trip. I'm glad I tried it. The chicken and waffles sandwich was good. It looked bigger than one serving but I surprisingly finished the whole thing, probably because it was delicious! My friend had the burger and she liked it. The crisscut fries are good too, but you might not have room for it after eating the sandwich. Also, the workers were super friendly! I appreciated that. I want to try a dessert one next time.

Close to the Orange Circle. You cannot miss this old fashioned style joint as it is right at the intersection of Palm and Glassell. It is a walk up order establishment with very limited seating. They do however bring the food to you. Now for the food... this is such a great idea and the quality of their food is EXCELLENTE. The chicken was tender, tasty, and not oily at all. The fried chicken and waffles is a must try. We also had the waffle fries, creme brulee and strawberry lemonade. Everything was on point. The only set back was the portions were too small. I could have easily ate two of the fried chicken waffles by myself. If the portions were bigger, I would come here every day. It was THAT good.

Some good waffle sandwiches, basically. Very good in my opinion and the waffles are nice and crisp. I ordered the patty melt and the fried chicken. Found a seat and my order came out in about 10 minutes. Nothing really bad to say about this place, except for their outside seating only. But other then that, good food, service was good they bring the food out to you after you order. I'll come back on sunny days forsure! Btw their desserts and shakes are to dieeeeeee for!!!

This place is amazing! The servers are always so enthusiastic and kind. I recommend the chicken sandwich (the syrup is not necessary), the proscuitto & gruyere, and the smoked salmon! The lemonade is always delicious. Get their waffle fries! Best waffle fries I've had, even better than Chikfila's. Docked one star for outdoor/sparse seating and the price: a waffle, fries, and a lemonade rack up to around $15. For a waffle, I feel it could be priced a little more justly.

There's not much more I can say than go. Go now. Don't hesitate, don't think, just go. Moments after I finished my meal I sent texts with pictures and addresses of all Bruxie locations to all my closest friends instructing them to go immediately. It's that good. It's that great. It's mother-effing phenomenal. One tip: Every time I've gone to the Orange location it's been at peak lunch hours and I've waited in line. Avoid the peak hours and avoid the wait. If you're looking for a new apartment, I suggest getting one as close as possible to this place. It's so amazing.

I was curious about all the hype of this place & not sure what I thought of the whole "waffle sandwich" concept. But I was seriously impressed. Me & my husband split the grilled cheese with avocado. It wasn't too bad price wise, but if you were getting your own, it could get a bit pricey. It was about $9 for the waffle sandwich with a basket of fries & we didn't get drinks. They're sweet waffles looked super good. They're sodas were hand crafted & looked amazing as well. The line was really long but now I see why. It went pretty quickly & they have people who talk to you in line to answer any questions you have about the menu or whats good to get. Bruxie now is my favorite place to get a grilled cheese, besides In n Out. I will definitely be back !

So good! 蔄t first I was a little hesitant as my friends are describing different types of sandwiches folded inside a waffle but I am so glad they insisted. I had the pastrami which had Gruyere, cider slaw, brown mustard and pickles. 蔜he pastrami was sliced thin and it was delicious! 蔕ne friend had the Green Eggs and Ham which was an egg, ham, cheddar, may and arugula pesto. 蔛ounds a little off with the pesto but it was very yummy. 蔜he other friend had the Monday special which was Patty Melt - beef patty with Gruyere cheese, caramelized onions, 蔭nd Bruxie's "secret sauce." 蔠e all kind of shared so we all got a taste of everything and there were no complaints. My friends come to Bruxie's often but had never tried the Irish Nachos (crispy waffles fries, homemade cheese sauce, Applewood smoked bacon, sour cream and chives). 蔛o we added that to our order and we were so glad we did. One friend had a root beer float (which I have a feeling he gets a lot). 蔜he shakes looked amazing but I didn't want to fill up on a shake when I could be eating everything else. If I lived closer to a Bruxie location I would frequent it often as my friends do. 蔍 would order everything again but I feel that I owe it to myself to work through the menu first.

Like every other good restaurant the line is long during lunch and dinner time. I have tried the fried chicken and waffle, the breakfast waffle, the pastrami and waffle, and the creme brulee waffle. My favorite has to be the fried chicken and waffle because it comes with syrup. The french fries are also tasty.

My only complaints is their limited outdoor seating and the fact that their milkshakes are so expensive! $5.95 for a mint chocolate shake that tasted good but I wouldn't order it again at that price!

Cool, hip little joint right next to the Orange circle. Parking is tough, but the atmosphere, food, and staff here is very cool. They are also dog-friendly, which is a huge plus in my book. This place is sentimental for me because it's where I met my significant other. We split a root beer float & some fries here. Unfortunately, their corporate(?) customer service is awful. I was trying to arrange something special for an anniversary here. First time I contacted them, no response. Second time I contacted them, I got a response, but after I replied back, no response. Horrible customer service. Wont be returning. Ever. **Update Jun 26**: Office Manager e-mailed me after reading my Yelp review(since she still had my e-mail address from my contact attempts) and apologized. My messages had gotten lost in the shuffle. Boo, but I understand, it happens. She sent me generous gift cards. It was a nice, genuine gesture and I applaud them for their customer service. Mistakes happen - it's what the company does afterwards to mend it that really counts. So here you go, from 1 star to 5 stars :) And no, they did not ask me to update my review lol.

i was disappointed that there is actually nothing unique or extraordinary about the waffle. after hearing all the hype i was expecting a thick buttery sweet delicious belgian waffle or something. but eh, it was just a plain light waffle- like leggo my eggo. however, i thought the sandwiches were okay. 蕋he fried chicken was crispy and juicy but kinda light and bland even with the sauces. the bruxie burger beef was juicy, but bland so i had to dump ketchup on it. my favorites are the roasted mushroom & goat cheese with the sundried tomatoes and the strawberry creme brulee.

Minus one-star because they make fries in peanut oil - which I'm allergic to :( According to the website, its name comes from a combination of French and Flemish for "Belgium" and apparently "Belgie" is a slang term for waffle. It was created by two life-long friends who went to Belgium for a business trip and were fascinated with the Belgian waffles. They decided to bring this awesomeness back to the US and began pairing a variety of sweet and savory combinations. And what a tr弒 bon lunch it was! The four of us shared five savory waffles: the prosciutto (2), cheesy with veggie add-ons, fried chicken, and mushrooms with goat cheese. What bummed me was that all fried items were cooked with peanut oil, which I'm really allergic to so I couldn't eat the mouthwatering-looking waffle fries or the fried chicken. What a tease! BUT the staff were really cautious about making sure my waffle was cooked separately. My first thought as I took my bite: Oh...my...gosh - how delicious!! I was afraid that the waffles were going to be really filling like the ones I remember from Brussels, but quite the contrary, they were crispy, full of flavor and light!! I was happy as a clam, but let me warn you, they can be addictive! I couldn't leave without trying the sweets (don't judge me!) So, we got the Nutella & banana, and cr弇e br瀕巈 with a cup of double espresso. I'm a big sucker for Nutella - I'd try almost anything that has Nutella in it. It was such a satisfying meal, and I feel like I've finally fulfilled that incredible waffle craving that I've been looking to fill for a while! I think my two favorites were the prosciutto and Nutella & banana. Too bad that they don't have a stand in LA - I'm sure they'd make a killing if they were to open one ;) Thanks, Bruxi� for bringing a piece of Belgian culture into the U.S.! So, when are you coming to LA? * wink *

Oh Bruxie, we meet again! Waffles goes with anything and everything. Entree? Add some chicken Sandwich? Add some pastrami Dessert? Add some ice cream Waffle cut fries are awesome. No, really. There's something about them being waffle cut that makes it extra special. With the addition of some bacon and sour cream, it disguises itself as Irish Nachos. Loved it! Fresh strawberry lemonade completes a meal here. Best of all, service is great. Everyone's so friendly, attentive and quick to bus tables. Parking is not too hard to find but remember that they have a 30mins limit so better polish up your dine and dash skill!

I was kind of iffy about this place.... Saw a lot of review here n there but mehh you just got to try the place for yourself right? �First of all parking is way to small you have better luck finding parking in the streets. This place has some class its like a high class fancy fast food joint LOL. 蔜o be honest it had a nice little vibe to it with its tacky little style it had going with it. As we get there no line what so ever but then suddenly after we order DAMN hueMONGO line just appeared so I was like this place must be good.. Uhhh man service here was sure friendly I was a bit overwhelmed by how kind these people are!! Kinda freaked me out a bit... Well the hommie got the buttermilk fried chicken, his lady got the bruxie burger and I had the salmon one. Ugh...So I wasn't so pleased with my meal haha... I was giving it too much hope I guess but the hommie gave me a 3rd of his and I gave him a some of mine to trade... Let me tell you some thing peps if you want to get your socks rocked just get the BUTTERMILK FRIED CHICKEN AND WAFFLE!! With extra maple syrup of course ") After the first bite felt like all my teeth was doing the rain dance making my mouth water down like a water fall...... Just eating a 3rd of that buttermilk fried chicken and waffle made me in love with the place. Oh well I still need to try the sweets here looks very tastey.... BUT yess... I SOO AM A FAN!!

http://Bomb.com haha =) 蔜here is not other place like Bruxie that I know of and I cant stop coming here to eat everytime I am in old town orange. 蔍 have had the pastrami (a bit salty but I love it), friend chicken with honey (another must have) and the turkey club (my go to if I am trying to be a tad bit healthy). 蔈verything is a la carte so you have to order fries and you might as well just make them Irish nachos. 蔍 have yet to try any of their shakes or desserts not because they dont sound great but because I dont want to have to be rolled all the way home. 蔄ll of the employees are super nice and they will even talk with you while you are in line to give recommendations.

Ordered the smoked salmon and fried chicken waffles and sat in the nice little seating area. The waffle was amazing, crisp and light but a bit disappointed by the sandwich as a whole. The fried chicken was moist and crispy and complimented the waffles very well. The smoked salmon sandwich was a little plain but the cucumber crunch in the sandwich was quite refreshing. I'd tell them to go light on the cream cheese, it was a little much for my liking. I'll think about coming back but I'm not impressed. WARNING: no bathrooms there!

After hearing all the hype, needed to check this place out. So here's the step-by-step experience: PARKING: They have a handful of spots behind the stand. Like literally a handful. As in 5-6. So your best bet is to find some street parking nearby. SERVICE: Excellent. My buddy and I got in line with about 15 people ahead of us, apparently a light day. Some workers immediately came up to us, began some small talk, gave us menus and their personal suggestions. Very friendly, very helpful. Well done, good sir. SEATING: Again, limited, like their parking. They really should just get rid of the "parking" and build another seating area, but I guess it's probably for the employees? Anyway, they have some 2-4 person tables along the sides of the stand and also next to the parking lot. If you have a friend, better have one scouting for seats because with 15 people ahead of you, there's definitely not gonna be enough for everyone... FOOD: After reading through some reviews, we decided to split a pastrami and prosciutto. Both were delicious in their own special way. The prosciutto was pretty savory, but with like 2 slices tucked inside, I felt slightly gypped. I wish they hadn't been so stingy with portions, but still good nonetheless. The pastrami with thin sliced pickles was excellent, packed with flavor and juicy/greasy tastiness. And wrapped in a crispy waffle, it was pretty amazing. I'm definitely gonna have to come back and try some of their dessert waffles. We also got the waffle fries, crisp, golden, awesomeness. THE BILL: Price was reasonable. You'll spend about $10/person.

Very simple concept. Wasn't exactly sold on it, but after trying it, they've won me over, just from the menu choices, the fantastic personable staff, and charm of the place. �So far - Bruxie burger; just okay, nothing wrong with it, but on a universal scale of burger awesomeness it's just okay. but I had a bit of my friend's Turkey/Avocado/Bacon sandwich and that was delicious. Pastrami sandwich was alright.... The banana/chocolate shake is incredible, and the presentation makes it a work of art. I look forward to trying the other menu items on future visits! I do want to try the Chicken one that everyone is raving about, and for sweet sandwiches the Nutella/Banana one and Creme Brulee sounds great, too. �Prices are a moderate for this kind of food, but not outlandish, just don't go expecting budget eats at fast food prices. Seems a lot of people are complaining about parking..... It's on a corner with very limited parking....The surrounding area is cozy and intimate like a small town, something you'll be hard-pressed to find in the generally sterile and uninspired layout of modern Orange County, so you may need to park a couple blocks away in a designated public parking lot or on a street that doesn't require a permit.....just use some common sense and walk the couple/few small city blocks there and enjoy the stores and atmosphere of the Orange Circle, because it doesn't exist anywhere else around here. Or don't.

Everytime I go by this place there is a long line, but today there wasn't so I finally stopped to try it. 蔔ow I know why there are so many people in line all the time. 蔜he waffle sandwiches are so good! 蔍 had a pulled pork sandwich which I thought might be dry or have too much pork on it but it was not like that at all. 蔜he waffle is light and airy and the pork was very flavorful. 蔣ou have to eat outside and there are no restrooms but that's ok because it's worth it.

One of my new favorite places to frequent on a Friday night! Bruxie reminds me of an old time ice cream shack, but instead, they serve waffles and homemade custard. The line can get pretty long, but it moves fast. They even bring the waffles to your table, so you don't have to wait by the window for your food. I tried the Fried Chicken waffle with chili honey and coleslaw. It reminded me of Roscoe's Chicken and Waffles, but I actually liked this one better. I would recommend getting the maple syrup to go along with it. I also tried the smore's waffle (as amazing as it sounds), but I wish it was warmer. I think it would be better to order the dessert waffles after you eat to avoid having it get cold. Everyone (and I mean, everyone) had a milkshake or root beer float. I tried the mint chocolate chip shake and it had a layer of dark chocolate on the bottom. I honestly thought the ice cream was the best part of the experience, even over the waffles. We were asked a few times how everything tasted, which is pretty rare for a "shack" style restaurant. I was definitely impressed with the service. I can definitely see this fitting into my "summer friday" routine.

I love this place. The atmosphere is fun, the staff is friendly, and the food is delicious. The first time around I got the monte Carlo. It was good but the second time I had the smoked salmon sandwich (amazing). If you like bagels with locks you will love this one. It's so refreshing and the smoked salmon was really fresh. Both times my food came out quickly and hot. I can't wait to go back and try the s'mores dessert waffle!

Only reason why I rate this place 4 Stars was because everyone I came with seem to really love this place. Personally i was un impress. Maybe its because of all the great reviews that I read or all the hype that my friends made I simply found the waffle meh! Food: I had the chicken and waffle with maple syrup! The waffle was just ok for me however the chicken had great taste and I did pay an extra $1 for the syrup which came in this cool little small bottle. The nice thing about having the syrup on the side is you can add as much or as little as you like and then take the bottle home as a souvenir. I also tried there strawberry lemonade which was delish. Location: As every other review says parking sucks, however the building itself is quaint, 蔭nd the outside seating is nice. A very dog friendly place to go! They even have treats for them. There are no bathrooms because of the history of the building however they do provide you with hand sanitizer which i though was nice! Even though i did not enjoy it as much as others i am willing to give it another try maybe try something else. I hear amazing things about there sweat waffles. Till next time for now ill keep it as 4 stars .

Nothing better than a great sandwich. Well, unless the bread is made of waffle. I have taken tons of people to try the amazing food at Bruxie. The staple is the fried chicken Bruxie, but I have to admit that I am partial to the smoke salmon Bruxie. If you're already busting your calorie limit for the day, might as well go the whole nine yards and have the frozen custard. Better than yogurt, not as bad (I like to think) as full-fledged ice cream. The addition of caramel on top makes it phenomenal. If you want to do a dessert Bruxie, try the caramel br瀕巈 Bruxie and add nutella. Bottom line is that you can't go wrong here!

This place is just all hype in my opinion...Yeah, it's good but not THAT good. Pretty pricey for a waffle sandwich if you ask me! I had the fried chicken and slaw sandwich and it was tasty, but I wouldn't make that far of a trip just for a "gourmet waffle sandwich" for that price. I asked them to cut mine in half and the girl said she'd tell them, but she didn't. No big deal though, I just prefer eating small bites first. The parking is crazy so I recommend you park somewhere else and walk there. Avoid the traffic at all costs!

WOW, just WOW! Waffles goes with anything. I'd have waffles for breakfast, lunch, and dinner if I could. Bruxie gives waffles as nice twist and creates flavorful offerings. I tried the the hot pastrami. The meat is not as much as you would see in a regular pastrami sandwich but it's very flavorful and combined with the waffle, it's rather filling. The service is top-notch. If it's your first time here, they will make sure that you understand what's going on and even make recommendations. Wish parking was as good as unfortunately, most of the street parking has a thirty minutes limit.

To be fair, I'd give this place a solid 3.5, maybe 3.75. Where it amazes, is the service. They always have someone standing out front to answer questions about the menu. Because there's always someone that thinks people line up to buy something slapped between 2 Eggo waffles, or worse, Krusteaz waffles. The horror of Krusteaz waffles...Ok now that I've stopped quivering. The employees are also ready to offer up suggestions. I just went for the Grilled Cheese deal and the employee recommended avocado which turned out to be really good. And, I didn't feel so bad about eating a grilled cheese waffle because the avocado balanced it out. *You can call me later for other diet tips. Like how a strawberry margarita helps you meet your daily servings of fruits* There's always a line but it usually moves pretty fast unless there's someone that you have to explain the whole concept to. Where it falls short a little for me is with the burger and the short rib sammie. The burger had no flavor and the short rib had flavor but was not as tender as I'm used to. I've never had any of the sweet treats but I don't know how hard it could be to botch sweets on a waffle. I've heard the chicken and waffle is respectable but I'm not even gonna go there. I'm sensitive about my chicken and waffles and usually leave it up to the crew at Roscoe's, unless I have leftover Popeye's and some Eggos.

For those that don't know Bruxie, they specialize in waffle sandwiches. I had their smoked salmon one, and it consisted of smoked salmon (of course), cream cheese, and cucumbers. It was utterly amazing. I am wondering if there is one San Diego.

The place where WAFFLES replace the Sliced Bread. Located just north of the traffic circle in Old Town Orange, Bruxie is across the corner from Chapman University. �So as you imagine this place gets pretty busy during lunch. 蔐uckily or Unluckily the prices of the waffle meals are a little pricey for an average college student to eat at everyday. �I have visited both this location and Brea, but still consider this one better. 蔛omething about the waffles here are crispier on the outside and light in the middle. 蔜he Waffle Sandwiches are broken down into 2 groups Savory and Sweet. �The best from the Savory Waffles: 1. 蔅uttermilk Fried Chicken - Can't go wrong 2. 蔅ruxie Burger - Kids and Adults love the flavor of the patty 3. 蔙oasted Mushroom & Goat Cheese - for that health conscious one in the group 4. 蔋ot Pastrami - Not as good as the Hat but still good The best from the Sweet Waffles: 1. 蔛easonal Creme Brulee - Yummy, for that cream and fresh fruits 2. 蔛'Mores - reminds you of breakfast at the campfire. Best of their Daily Specials: 1. 蔅raised Beef Short Ribs - Fall right apart and have that savory flavor...oh so good The Best is saved for last: Their soft serve FROZEN CUSTARD is far the most anticipated item, each time I visit. 蔍t is like eating frozen whipped cream, and smooth (no ice crystals). �Ice Cream doesn't even compare. �It is so rich that you might not be able to finish it. The food is probably 4 stars, but that custard tosses it into the 5 star arena. Parking is sometimes hard to find during lunch, as it is mostly street parking. 蔜ry and get there before 11:30 to beat the lunch crowd.

WAFFLE SANDWICH HEAVEN! This place has an amazing, and I am kicking myself for passing this place off too much. This place has an amazing variety of waffle sandwichs that are perfect for breakfast, lunch, dinner, or a special snack. So far I have had the pulled pork, egg/cheese (not sure exactly the name), and the turkey club. All are so good! Everything tastes fresh, the combos are perfect, and I never feel too full. Waiting for a table can be a hassle, but don't worry, people generally eat and leave. This is not a sit and chill place, you eat and leave. The food is also quick to come out which is a big plus. I am sad it took me so long to finally try this funky little stand, but I am o so glad I finally did!

I love Bruxie! Although the line can be long at times, it goes by relatively fast and you get your food fairly quickly as well. I always order the fried chicken and waffle and it's absolutely amazing! I'm a sucker for fried chicken, and the combination of chicken, cole slaw, and a delicious waffle is perfect! Best thing is, I didn't feel nasty after eating it which typically occurs after eating something so savory and delicious.

I've been to the Brea location a few times now, but I haven't been to the original in Orange and thought it was time. This place is exclusively outdoor seating only and it's fairly limited. They do have a parking lot in the back with about... 4-5 spots but it's pretty small and parking on a busy night here is just not possible. There is plenty of street parking and lot parking a block or two away... so get ready to walk. I ordered their proscuitto and gruyere - which was good but very, very light. My friend ordered the pastrami which was good, but also gets a bit heavy and greasy towards the end of the sandwich. For dessert, my friend and I shared their seasonal cheesecake and banana/nutella waffles. Keep in mind that these waffles are not served hot... so they are cold desserts. I felt that the desserts were a bit cloyingly sweet because of the sauce they put in these waffles. I personally think that their creme brulee one is much better! Overall, definitely would recommend coming here if you're in the area and have never tried it! Esp on a cool summer evening :)

I can't really say much about Bruxie that hasn't been said before, but it really is remarkable how great business has been since they opened a couple years ago. I used to pass by the old Dairy Treet that used to be there and it was DEAD. Bruxie, on the other hand, is always crowded! Come at peak lunch or dinner times and expect a line of at least 8-10 people. The best times to come are around the middle of the day, like 2-4 pm, because I've had moments where there's no line at all and that's pretty amazing. Because it's so close to school, I've stopped by several times and tried a lot of different items on the menu. My absolute favorite entree waffle is the Turkey Club Waffle, which comes with turkey, avocado, bacon and pesto aioli. For $8.95, it's pushing the limit of whether it's worth the price, but it tastes SO YUMMY and fills you up, so no complaints there. I used to be a fan of the Buttermilk Chicken & Waffle, but got over it and realized it's really nothing too special besides fried chicken on a waffle. Once, I tried the Smoked Salmon & Dill Cream Cheese Waffle, which was pretty...exotic tasting. I'm not a big fan of cream cheese but I didn't really taste too much of it, which was nice. I guess it's a good choice if you're feeling adventurous and want to try something new. The Bruxie Burger is also pretty good if you're craving that. Their dessert waffles are also really good - my favorite is the Nutella & Bananas. It's exactly what it says it is, and nothing more, but it's great if you're craving something sweet. My absolute FAVORITEEE thing on the menu is the IRISH NACHOS. Waffle fries with nacho cheese, bacon, sour cream & chives = soooo good and my total guilty pleasure! The only bad thing is for some reason the Old Town Orange location refuses to put this on their regular menu so it's still considered a "special" - aka not available everyday. I've gone 2 or 3 times and asked for the Irish nachos and was told they weren't serving them that day - major bummer!! So check the specials before you go if you want the Irish nachos. Another plus about Bruxie is the great customer service - the workers are always super happy, friendly & helpful (In N Out status happy), but their enthusiasm is real and genuine. The outdoor dining area is improving every time I walk past it - they're adding more tables & seats, outdoor heaters, tents, etc. It's pretty crazy! If you're from outside the area and trying to find parking though, good luck - street parking around Old Town Orange is always a hassle and this is no exception. The only negative about Bruxie is the prices - $8-10 for a waffle is a bit ridiculous, especially since it doesn't come with fries or a drink (it costs another $2.50 to add fries!) It's worth a try though, just so you can see what all the hype is about!

So I have to make somewhat of an embarrassing confession...I attend school cady-corner from this waffle joint and I have boycotted trying this place ever since it opened a couple years ago. 蔕ver the past few years, I have seen it transform into a million different restaurants that all FAILED...but not BRUXIE!!! Bruxie proved that this little corner location is not a jinx and can be SUPER profitable. 蔍 boycotted this place mainly because I am "chang" (cheap) and I had the crazy idea that I didn't want to pay $7-10 for A WAFFLE, WTF (WHAT THE WAFFLE)!!! But boy, was i wrong about that one! 蔅ruxie is worth every wakin waffln penny! From the friendly customer service, quick turnover of orders to ready-to-eat meals, to the deliciousness of the waffle. 蔠TF!!!! Granted I have only tried the Turkey Club and the Criss Cross Fries Nachos...I haven't been dissapointed yet. 蔛ome of my friends who usually get the fried chicken tried my turkey club and almost died! 蔜hey said they are definitely ordering the turkey club the next time. �Tips: -be prepared for a line (i rarely pass by bruxie when there is NO line) - menu specials change all the time, sometimes they run out -parking can be tough if you are not from around the area, it is in a residential area so make sure you don't park in an area that you need a street parking permit -seating is outdoors so be cognitive of the weather, wouldn't want to come when it's raining = SOGGY WAFFLES, eww!

I am still a frequent of this establishment. 蔍 take any friend and family member I can when they are in town for a visit. 蔍 think I have been just about every single weekend since my original post back in September '11. �I had the opportunity to meet the owner just a few weekends ago, and congratulated him on his success. 蔍n a few years time I would like to get back in contact with him about trying to open a location up in Portland, OR. 蔜his type of shop is perfect for a quirky foodie town like Portland. 蔛ince I started going, my 2 favorite specials that I got whenever I had the chance the Hot Pastrami, and the Turkey Club, were added permanently to the menu. If you get the chance go and get the Seasonal Shake, California Strawberry. 蔄rguably the best strawberry shake I have had, never plugs the straw, yet has tons of chunks of strawberry blended in. 蔉resh and delicious! I am very sad to be leaving the area in a few weeks time, and will likely get waffle patterned rash-like breakouts during the withdrawal period. 蔍 will definitely go here every single time I visit Southern California, this place is just as awesome of an attraction as Disneyland and Stone Brewery in my book.

Finger lickin' good!! I live for waffles so I've been dying to try out Bruxie ever since I heard about it. 蔍 already knew I wanted to order to Prosciutto & Gruyere Sandwich ($7.95) and it did not disappoint! 蔜he creaminess of the cheese matched perfectly with the saltiness of the ham... and that is how you make perfection. The size of the sandwich is alright but it definitely wouldn't be filling if your were starving. I also tried the Ogura Sandwich ($4.95) for dessert and it was delicious as well. It's a sweet bruxie with red bean and sweet cream. 蔍t's very reminiscent of those Korean Red Bean Buns but a little better in my opinion because of the sweet cream. The seating here is adorable but all of it is outside. 蔛o I wouldn't come here if the weather is bad unless you're willing to take it to-go. 蔅ruxie is a great date spot and there are cute vintage shops and bars just a block away!

I've heard raving reviews about their fried chicken and waffles, but their Saturday special with the pulled pork, coleslaw and homemade BBQ sauce got me. I'm glad I did, because the pulled pork was extremely tender. It had a few fat pieces in there I had to pull aside but that's where the flavor is right? I split a side of waffle fries with a friend too. The staff was great, and they were knowledgeable about all the different waffles. Sitting on those leather stools was hot though.

Waffle sandwich - excellent concept! 蔒y wife and I stopped at Bruxie yesterday on our way to a concert to have some dinner. 蔜heir fantastic, energetic, friendly staff were very helpful. 蔭 young lady approached me while I stood in line and asked if it was my first time at Bruxie. 蔠hen I told her that yes it was my first time there she pulled a menu out of her pocket, went over some of their selections, and made some recommendations. 蔛he was very sweet and helpful. 蔒y wife ordered the angus hamburger and I ordered the fried chicken waffle that had been recommended. 蔠e split both items along with some waffle fries and strawberry lemonaid. 蔜he hamburger could have been elevated from very good to excellent if only they had seasoned the meat a bit. 蔍ts amazing what a little salt and pepper can do. 蔄lso, while the coleslaw on the friend chicken sandwich added a nice texture, it was a little bland. 蔄 little vinegar to give it some tang, and again, some salt and pepper, would have elevated it immensely. 蔜he fries and lemonaid were both topnotch, and the service was absolutely outstanding! �This is definitely a place worth checking out. 蔍t was quite busy when we arrived and only got busier while we ate. 蔍t certainly does seem to be a popular place to eat. 蔍'm certainly looking forward to trying some of their other menu items.

I really love this place. I haven't had anything here that hasn't fully satisfied my taste buds. My favorite items on the menu so far would be the Bruxie Burger and the Lemon Cream and Berries. The lemon cream and berries is so insanely good. It's a nice custardy zing to it with the sweet fresh berries rounding it out. A very well balanced dessert. I still need to try the fried chicken waffle and the turkey sandwich waffle...I hear the turkey sandwich is really good.

DAT WAFFLE FRY but minus a million stars for lack of restroom, wetnaps, or anything -- i just felt nasty after eating their chicken + waffle sandwich which comes drizzled with a chili honey sauce. the chicken was amazing -- it was white meat but it was super moist. impressive. protip: toss some cholula on it -- amazing. like other posters have recommended, park on the street. i spent something like $15 for the sandwich, waffle fries, side of maple syrup, and a strawberry lemonade.

So goood! I tried their Smoked Salmon and Dill crean cheese as well as one of their specials which was the Albacore tuna waffle sandwiches. Both were made to perfection. The crust was perfectly crisp which complimented well with the filling on the inside. The smoked salmon and dill cream cheese waffle sandwich was very light and refreshing. A perfectly balance of savory and sweet. The albacore tuna waffle sandwich was very hearty. The albacore tuna was very fresh, light, and not overwhelming at all. Both were delicious. I'm going to make it my mission of trying everything on the menu. Their strawberry lemonade was delicious! It was freshly made and very refreshing. There was a good balance between sweetness and tartness. The only reason I gave it 4 stars rather than 5 is that parking is sometimes very hard to find during peak hours!

Oh man...love, love, love this place. 蔍f I lived closer, I'd go more often. 蔕nly thing is parking is a little difficult (but not impossible). 蔄lso, no restrooms available. 蔋ad to use the college bathrooms nearby. 蔋ere for the food! Good customer service, great food, and though simple seating, it worked! 蔠hat makes this place significant was it's combination of creativity and deliciousness into a meal. 蔜hey serve all types of meals with...waffles! 蔒y girlfriend had a tuna melt waffle. 蔍 had a grilled cheese waffle (which was eh but worked). 蔊ot some waffle fries. 蔄nd, topped it off with a waffle smore!

The creator of Bruxie is a genius and my personal food hero. Prosciutto & Gruyere = YUMMY Waffle Fries = YUMMY Root Beer = YUMMY Strawberry Creme Brulee = YUMMY Strawberry Dream Float = YUMMY After all that, Cindy = FATTY. I ate the strawberry creme brulee while driving back to San Diego. I scarfed that baby down even though I was pretty damn full. Needless to say, there was powdered sugar everywhere. Since it's doing so well, I can only hope Bruxie will keep expanding and a location will open up in San Diego. That would be a dream!

BRUXIE!!! I'm super late on the bruxie bandwagon but I'm happy I finally made the drive. I was a little skeptical when I found out Bruxie had the #2 yelp spot for the entire US (2011) I mean.. how good can waffles be? buttermilk fried chicken and waffle: 4 stars! chicken was SO tender! really greasy though. and the honey is definitely a nice touch. Hot pastrami bruxie: 4 1/2 stars! My favorite out of all the ones I tried. The pastrami was so yummy and the pickles added perfect flavor. Seasonal creme brulee bruxie: 4 stars! wow, the brunt raw sugar and strawberries were perrrfection. Comes with a vanilla creme inside and I would have liked a LITTLE more cause it was so good. Stawrberry lemonade: 4 stars! The people who worked there were super nice and made sure to give their honest opinions on what was their favorite, etc. The only thing I wasnt too big on was the location. Maybe because it's so far from where I live.. maybe because there is no inside seating. Maybe because the tables and sitting in a parking lot is unattractive to me?

I just love this place. I always get the savory waffle with arugula, Balsamic reduction mushrooms, and goat cheese then add a piece of fried chicken breast to it.

The food was different and pretty good. however, the parking there is pure crap and over zealous parking enforcement officers are lurking behind every corner waiting to jump out and give you some kind of bullshit ticket....

So I finally gave into temptation and drove all the way out to Orange just to get a piece of the action. They had a bigger menu than the one they had online, which isn't a bad thing. I got to try the Turkey Club (turkey, avocado, tomato, lettuce, pesto aioli and chunks of honey bacon.) It was absolutely delicious! The thing that surprised me the most was how fast the food came out considering the long line they had. Got my food fresh and hot and the waffle fries still steaming hot from the fryer. Can't seem to give Bruxie's a 5 star cause it didn't have too much of a "wow" factor for me. But most definitely a good eat if your'e looking for something simple and fresh. The combo costs around $11.25 for a drink with fries, which kind of burned a whole in my wallet, but I will be back some time in the near future.

Overall great food, but not AMAZING food. I had high hopes and I was not blown away. We had: -Green eggs and ham - My favorite there. Nice and meaty, yet not too heavy. -Pastrami - Good, but not great. I think the pastrami would have been better in just a plain old sandwich. Waffles did not help it. -Chicken and waffles - Very good, but not impressed. Roscoe's I think is better. -Strawberry and banana waffle - Very tasty, but again, not amazed. Overall it is very good, just don't expect your socks to get knocked off. Also, be prepared for sitting outside! If it's cold, bring a jacket because they have no indoor seating. Also, they have no bathroom, so make sure you take a leak before coming here.

I love Bruxie's waffle- light, crispy, and fluffy. I am in love with their creme brulee waffle =) Parking may be a hassle.. but imo, i think it's totally worth the time to look for one. On the day I went, I was visiting Chapman and had a permit to park there. (Bruxie is only a few blocks from Chapman. About a 5-8min walk.) The waffles were superb and exceeded my expectation. Service is friendly and efficient. I had my order to-go and waited on the side tables while the staff bought me my food. Fried chicken waffle- big juicy piece of chicken sandwiched between two light crispy waffle. Chicken was not dry at all and nicely seasoned! The portion is huge! Creme brulee waffle- my favorite! smooth velvety creaminess.. not overly sweet. same light fluffy waffle. Strawberry float- ...not too great. way too sweet and was artificial strawberry tasting. Overall, great concept and delicious food. I will be coming again soon and often!

Amazing sandwiches!!!!!! I came here on a tuesday afternoon. The line went quick, 蔭nd the waitresses and waiters there were going thru the line asking everyone if they knew what they wanted and if theyve been here before, alot of help when choosing from a place where everything taste good. Limited seating, but it seemed like because of the fast service ppl would finish faster and there were always tables open. I got the pulled pork sandwhich, creme brulee sandwhich, and strawberry soda. Delicious...simply delicious!!

Oh why are you so tasty? WHY WHY WHY? The concept is so simple but it just tastes so damn good that I've become a fan without really wanting to become one. Initially, I thought this place was WAY overhyped and just a $1 too expensive but now I don't even care because I love it so much. I even got used to the HORRENDOUS wait and the SERIOUS lack of available seating and NO PARKING in sight anywhere. The boyfriend and I've tried a variety of things here and my favorite is the Fried Chicken Waffle Sandwich. Yes it is ridiculous to charge $1 for maple syrup but it makes a HUGE difference so just do it. Your tastebuds will be thanking you. I really like the cole slaw on the chicken too. Yummy Green Eggs and Ham is also quite tasty. Their pesto is amazing. My boyfriend said the pastrami is good too and so is the waffles with Nutella and bananas. We also tried the Strawberry Cheesecake waffles and it 蕎as quite delicious. But it definitely doesn't live up to a real cheesecake with strawberry topping. There are still a lot of things on the menu that I'm dying to try so I will definitely be back! I love you Bruxie! 5/5

My ex, Vinh H, actually took me here last year I think, so it's been a while! 蔖lease keep this in mind when you're reading my review. 蔒y enthusiasm regarding this business has inevitably declined. 蔍t was decent and affordable given the sizes and taste. 蔍t did leave me feeling super heavy though, but the flavor was so good that it was worth it! 蔠hat I recall above all was how packed this place was and how happy the workers looked! 蔜hey were fast-paced, but also very relaxed and easy to laugh with. Gooooooods: We tried their Carolina Pulled Pork, Buttermilk Fried Chicken, waffle frieds, and date shake. 蔜here's nothing I can really complain about. 蔈verything tasted good, but I wasn't as impressed as my ex that's for sure! 蔍 would have appreciated it if the waffle fries were seasoned more, the date shake were less sweet, and the Buttermilk Fried Chicken less dry. 蔕f course, I think it's because I've become a much pickier taster now that I've been cooking religiously and find ways to twist recipes!

What a truly great concept. Came here on a Saturday night and the line was intermittently long and short at times. We were caught in the long part but had no troubles finding a table for the 4 of us. I was a newbie so I had the burger. I was debating between that and the hot pastrami. Maybe next time. I was not disappointed with the burger. It was cooked to perfection and the waffle instead of bun was amazing. the best part of the meal was probably the dessert. We had the creme brulee which was a strawberry that day (rotating). Can't wait to come back! TIP: No bathroom here so go before you come!

4 stars = means i recommend this place. my friend and i ordered a sweet and savory bruxie. one was the "seasonal" creme brulee - which was strawberry. love strawberries. and the other was savory. bacon and cheddar. i am a breakfast girl forever. i found this place on yelp and love exploring new places to eat that are delicious and not too expensive. if they're healthy that's great too. we loved the new idea of making a waffle sandwich. i used the agave as dipping sauce for the sweet bruxie, which was a great addition. with a side of peet's coffee, not bad at all! great, cute little restaurant. lots of patrons, but no wait at all. so overall, a tasty stop. 4 stars. next time i will try their cane soda :)

Love the combinations, good. Not addicted to it, like most others seem to be. But I do think that they have a winning idea with using the light buttery waffles for the sandwiches instead of bread. Got the turkey club, prosciutto and gruyere, and buttermilk fried chicken and waffles. Not a big fan of the chicken and waffles because it tasted like a chicken strip in a waffle, the club was good, but my favorite was the prosciutto and gruyere. The combination is fantastic and it has taste that stands out from the ordinary sandwich and somehow, it tastes better on a sweet waffle.

gourmet waffle sandwiches! line does get long, so plan ahead of time! this location does not have a restroom, so either hold it or walk across the street. i appreciate the fact that they just don't have ketchup as a condiment and that the waffles are made just right. workers are extremely friendly and helpful. for savory, i usually get the green eggs & ham (grilled ham, tillamook cheddar, jumbo egg, mayo, & arugula pesto) or roasted mushroom & goat cheese with sun dried tomatoes (goat cheese, fresh basil, arugula, & balsamic reduction). add the waffle cut fries! dip it in sriracha or apple cider vinegar. for dessert, i usually get the nutella & bananas (with sweet cream) or PB & J. i know the brea location has indoor seating and more spacious, so check that out as well. will definitely come back again and try other things on the menu! check out the picture i posted.

Why Why Why is there nothing similar to Bruxie in Norcal!!? :( I'm not usually a fan of sandwiches and I usually like to pick at my chicken and waffles but boy did Bruxie nail this right! I ordered the classic (Buttermilk fried chicken and waffle). They charge $1 for a side of maple syrup but instead of charging me, they just put mine on the side (I love to dip everything I eat in some kind of condiment). There was also cider slaw in the sandwich that added a nice crunch. The sandwich was close to perfect. The waffle isn't your usual thick, dense waffle. Their waffle is thin, crisp, and airy! The chicken is crispy, tasty and surprisingly, not dry!! I dip mine in the syrup, sprinkle some Mexican hot sauce and I get chicken and waffle heaven!! I added a side of waffle fries to my meal for an extra $2. They gave me enough for 2 - 3 people. The fries were crispy and weren't drenched in oil! I really wish I wasn't too full to try the dessert! Definitely looking forward to coming there again when there's better weather. The restaurant is almost like a casual drive through. You order at their window and find a seat outside. The staff brings your food to you, big plus! I went on a horrifically windy day so our waters were blown off our table. It'd be a wonderful place to enjoy the weather on a sunny day!

I was so skeptical about this place. Like waffles (I don't even like them for breakfast), with various stuffings? But caved in and came, and I'm glad I did. My friend and I got 2 sandwiches: pulled pork, and creme brulee (strawberry) plus a strawberry lemonade. I attacked the pull pork one first, and took a bit of the pork itself. SO GOOD. The pork was flavorful, but wasn't covered in BBQ sauce. They gave a little bowl of this spicy/smokey sauce to add 蕂n to it which, it didn't really make a difference but that was just me. The slaw in the sandwich was good, I wish they gave me more (I really like coleslaw). I was amazed at how the waffle complimented all of this, it was light and crunchy and AMAZING it's hard to explain. It went perfectly with the pork, and I loved it. This was all washed down with a very fresh, delicious lemonade. A little too sweet for my taste, but the freshness of it 蕂utweighed that fact. I loved the little bits of strawberry in it. Okay, the creme brulee sandwich. The creme was pretty standard but I loved the little bits of raw sugar throughout the sandwich. I wished they added more strawberries through, there was so much creme with not that many strawberries to eat it with :(. But damn, that burnt sugar really got me. GO HERE. NOW. IT'S GOOD.

I've had the burger, chicken, and green eggs and ham before this visit. Burger is probably my favorite... The syrup in the chicken is overwhelming unless you add sriracha or hot sauce of some sort. Green eggs and ham doesn't leave a lasting impression - although I am now inspired to add pesto to eggs all the time... I had the pulled pork special today... Tender pulled pork with coleslaw! The pork was really good... I couldn't taste the coleslaw too much... It would have been nice to have more coleslaw to have a contrasting flavor to cut the tangyness of the sauce an the cheese. The waffle was perfect as usual... Crispy just enough for a nice texture but not too crispy where it cuts the roof of your mouth. Fries are mediocre... They could definitely use some seasoning Bruxie's is a place I like to take friends who are visiting the OC... it's different and unique and pretty tasty. A little more than I would like to pay for a waffle though..

Bruxie was so good, it took me back here immediately after I dropped off my friends. 蔍nstead of taking me home, it lead me back to Bruxie! (touch screen error :-( 蔴aha! I wanted to come here forever! I wanted to see what all the hype was! Was it worth the hype?? Yes, depends on what you ordered and who you are with. It's a small place where you ordered (and let me tell you, that line was ridiculous long!!) to eat there, very limited outdoors sitting. It's on the same street as Chapman University along with all the residential houses besides it. So after about 15 minutes studying the menu and looking around what people are having, we decided to order the Buttermilk 蔲ried chicken and Waffle- Delicious! The pastrami! - Way too greasy and the mix of the waffle and the pastrami is not a good mix. For dessert, we shared the Creme Brule- which I thought was the best. Classic Vanilla Cr巑e with Burnt Raw Sugar and Strawberries. The Burnt raw sugar made it amazing! Give it a try! I think everyone should try Bruxie at least once in their lifetime! :-)

Thank goodness AMC wasnt playing the movie I wanted to see in the Marina. 蔠e ventured to The Block in Orange and had an hour to kill plus we needed some dinner. 蔍 remembered in the back recesses of my old brain that there was a place in Orange that was doing sandwiches on waffles. 蔞OILA! 蔍t is right outside the Orange Circle and we were there! 蔠hat luck! We cruised through the circle and thankfully GPS was working with us this evening we ended up parking, ordering and enjoying our suprise meal in no time! The waffle is not sweet. 蔜hey serve burgers, pulled pork, pastrami, all sorts of things for the SAVORY side of things. 蔜hey have SWEET waffle dishes but I reserve those for breakfast. 蔠e have been there 2 times now. 蔠e have shared the Bruxie burger, the Hot Pastrami Bruxie, the buttermilk fried chicken -n- waffle and the pulled pork. 蔜hey were all amazing! 蔍 really loved my Pastrami. 蔜he kids got the Irish Nacho's last time we went. 蔜hey are waffle fries (nice and light, not greasy) covered with sour cream, chives, and applewood bacon bits.

My husband and I had left Haven just down the street after a less-than thrilling meal. We were looking for another restaurant to partake in when we walked past Bruxie. The vibe was more happening than the bars we had just walked past. We stopped the second I saw 蕋he word "waffles". As we approached, we were actually greeted by a smiling young employee who eagerly offered us paper menus. His smile eased us up and within a few glances at the menu I was excited. We ordered the buttermilk fried chicken waffle with chili oil and the smores' waffle. I also loved the choices of vintage sodas and milk shakes. Our order was up quickly and was piping hot. We carried it around back and plopped down on a picnic table. Man, I dove right into those tasty waffles. The chicken waffle was superb. Best version of "chicken-n-waffles" I have ever had. The chicken was perfectly crisp, juicy, and tender. The breading did not slid off, or become a crumbly mess. The chili oil added the right amount of tang and spice. The smores' waffle was also incredible. The melting chocolate oozed with marshmallow fluff in between the crunchy waffles....it was heaven. A ton of napkins later, I was finally full and satisfied. I may not come back to Orange for the restaurants, but I will certainly make it a mission to come back to Bruxie. I have such respect for small businesses that set high standards, deliver a superb product, and do it with world class service. We couldn't have had a better experience.

Wow, I have never felt so passionate about waffle sandwiches until I tried Bruxie! They are decadent flavor explosions folded between extra large, thin, tender, lightly toasted waffles.... with innovative Savory, Sweet, Belgium & Specials waffle sandwich menus and a Dairy Treats (ice cream and sundaes) menu...it was beyond difficult to decide what to order. But we went for lunch on St. Patrick's day so we got the St. Patrick's day specials. The Guinness Braised Short Ribs waffle sandwich with Dubliner cheese, 2 cheesy waffle fries in the middle, caramelized onions, and horseradish was probably the best sandwich I've ever had (I don't eat sandwiches that often but this was still monumental). The short ribs were tender, salty, extremely juicy, and extremely flavorful. The Dubliner cheese was sharp and tangy with the onions, and I don't know what kind of horseradish it was that came with this, but it was creamy and bomb. I am still dreaming about this sandwich. The Classic Reuben Bruxie was comparable with a regular really good Reuben sandwich, but I am a huge fan of waffles so the perfectly cooked waffle casing makes it that much better. The Bacon, Egg, & Cheddar waffle sandwich was made even more delicious by pure Vermont maple syrup. Irish Nachos were waffle cut fries (like crisscut fries) with real cheese sauce on top, scallions, and bacon bits. They weren't super crispy but I highly appreciated the real cheese sauce. Ate half the box. Was saddened that we underestimated the filling power of the savory sandwiches and therefore we didn't get to try the sweet ones...PB&J, Lemon Meringue Pie, seasonal fruit Creme Brulee, Nutella and Bananas, S'mores...and the Frozen Custard Ice Cream. I'll come back for you all on...my next yearly SoCal visit There is no inside seating, only a few tables outside...be prepared to probably take your food somewhere else. That is only thing Bruxie's is lacking. Other than that it is like heaven to me.

Bruxie! I like this place. It's cute. The food is totally eye appealing, but for taste. It's not "bam! party in my mouth" like most of my friends would say. still good though. 蔄NYWAY, this place gets super packed during lunch hours, so try to avoid that if you're in a hurry, or if you just want to try this place out and don't want to wait. So far, I've tried Buttermilk Fried Chicken & Waffle - it was alright. lol. GOOD, but alright :) Soft Serve Frozen Custard � they give you a good portion. it's DELISH Seasonal Creme Brulee - DOPE. i love sweets, and this is just perfect Waffle Cut Fries - ME GUSTA Strawberry lemonade - nothing magical, but still good So yes, overall. everything is good here, but I wouldn't go out of my way to eat here. Parking is super limited too, so I usually just park wherever close by in the neighborhood and walk over. :)

I love this place! I've tried most of them and my favorite BY FAR is the bacon egg and cheddar waffle it's absolutely PERFECT you can't go wrong with one of those. Chicken waffle: Not bad. A bit crisp on the outside and tender on the inside. I can get sick of it kind of easily though since it's just the fried chicken inside of a waffle. Salmon and Dill: YUM! They can add a little too much cream cheese sometimes but you can easily wipe it off to your liking. Bruxie Burger: .. Who knew a hamburger would taste so delicious inside the folds of a waffle... Banana Nutella: Honestly, the nutella and banana mix tastes good with ANYTHING. Strawberry Cheesecake: .. I need to share this with someone. It's delicious but an entire waffle of strawberry cheesecake is way too much for me since it's pretty rich. GOOD THOUGH! Irish Nachos: Good and beautifully presented. They get cold/less crunchy kind of fast though because all of the sauce. Everything here just seems to taste so good! Even the soda seems to tastes better.... Service is always good too! I'm only giving it 4 stars because I hate the parking and location of this place *sigh* can it migrate somewhere more convenient. And it'd be nice if they had more seatings because this place gets crowded pretty quickly.

If you are looking for some new ways of eating your Waffles, there is not a better place than Bruxie! I guarantee you my stamp of approval or your money back! :) What made this place such a hit were truly the waffles themselves. 蔍ts perfectly CRISPED, SOFT and THIN. 蔍t's not like your typical chewy, thick breakfast ones. 蔍t has a nice crunchity crunch. 蔄s a huge fan of waffles, I really appreciate their innovative and creative sandwich style and fillings that comes with it. The main part of the menu has two sections: the Savories and the Sweets. 蔆ame here on a late Friday afternoon, wasn't too hungry, but we shared a Strawberry Creme Brulee. 蔜he filling had a perfect balance of sugar, fruit, and cream. 蔜otally recommend this. We also ordered a side of Waffle fries that came out pretty crispy. 蔍f you don't feel like ordering a beverage, they have two large Iced Water dispensers for your FREE water cups. This is the Orange Old Town location so expect a little bit of character when dining here. 蔕utdoors seating only. 蔉riendly and prompt service. Next time: Chicken and Waffles!

If I wasn't feeling sick from all the fast food/ oily food/ super bad for you food that I eat all the time, I think I'd be here more often. Lol. The Bruxie Burger always gets me. I can't get enough of it. The patty is very moist and the waffle is that perfect touch you need. The Carolina Pulled Pork is pretty amazing too. They put too much meat in it for my taste, but I still ate all of it so I guess it wasn't too much of a bother. I wasn't a fan of the Irish Nachos. I wish they used shredded cheese instead of the cheese sauce. The cheese sauce just makes the fries soggy and unappealing. You really just need to drop by a Bruxie and try anything. You can't be disappointed. This location is smaller than their newer location in Brea. Well not necessarily smaller but less seating. And it's all outdoors. So if it's cold and raining outside and you still want your waffle fix, bundle up! Minus 1 star because it's outside. I get cold easily and like to eat my warm waffle in a warm place.

Call me a simpleton, but I like my waffle sandwiches without the fancy fixings. Bacon, egg, and cheddar is my pleasure, and Bruxie does it right. It's really the ultimate breakfast sandwich, and I can't find anything wrong with it. Hype usually has a losing record, but it's hard to exaggerate when it comes to Bruxie. Eat here now.

I finally made my way to Bruxie on a late Tuesday night a few weeks back. No line, good parking, and empty tables, yay! We snagged a high table near a cool-looking fire pit thing The food was good, but not out of this world. So many people rave about Bruxie, and thus I was expecting great food. My gruyere and prosciutto waffle with chives was tasty, but it was fairly simple and something I could make at home. The waffles fries were not as tasty as Chick-Fil-A's fries unfortunately. The sodas were nice. My fiance especially loved the old-fashioned root bear. My biggest problem is that is the portions are pretty small for the price. Maybe my expectations were too high. I'd come back sometime though.

One of my fave places to go! 蔛ometimes there is a long wait, and sometimes they are out of tables, but this never stops me. 蔍 usually go with at least one other person, and we get about 3 sandwiches. 蔜his way we can try more of them. 蔈very one I've tried has been delicious. 蔜he green eggs and ham sandwich is super yummy. 蔍 even like their fried chicken sandwich more than Roscoe's fried chicken and waffle (but I still am down for Roscoe's stops when I need a larger portion of chicken n waffles). 蔔o complaints at all. 蔍 still have to try the Irish Nachos, but they don't have this on the weekends....the Brea location does, though!

I finally got to do the Bruxie experience. Now that I've moved in Orange County, I had no excuse to not stop by. I figured I was in the mood for something really sweet and I'm glad I got to try this out. Despite the semi-long line and the 45 degree weather on this random January Saturday morning visit, I'm glad that I got my Bruxie fix. The owner/chef was pretty cool and engaged with customers who were in line so the line went by even faster. Again, my goal for this visit was something sweet so I went with their seasonal creme brulee. I also splurged a little bit more by adding some nice cold custard to the waffle dessert. And the experience was definitely a positive one. Despite the no bathroom availability and the only seating is outdoors, I'll definitely be coming back for more. Maybe next time, I'll go for something salty.

Holy Moly! Good waffles are definitely hard to come by these days and this place offers one of the best I've had in a while. �Bruxie is best known for their gourmet waffle sandwiches that come in savory and sweet options. 蔍've always associated waffles with sweet and so I played it safe with the Seasonal Creme Brulee, which is a classic vanilla creeme with brunt raw sugar and season fresh fruit (I got strawberries). 蔍t was delicious! The waffles were very fluff, moist inside and crispy outside. �I will tell you this, I was very, very wrong about the savory selection. 蔒y friends ordered some off of the savory menu and it was delicious. 蔍 almost forgot that it were 2 pieces of waffles on the outside. 蔜hey really know how to make their sandwiches. They often have specials, which i would suggest trying. 蔜he savory sandwiches my friends ordered were not on the traditional menu. 蔠e also got the waffle fries, which I thought was great. The only thing I dislike about this place is the inability to accommodate diners. 蔣ou stand in line, order your food, and stand outside waiting for the first seat to open. 蔖eople can be vulchers so be careful of the stink eye. Waffles range $5 - $8.

This place is awesome. We parked a block away and walked, the street Bruxie is on is filled with quaint little homes, so the walk was very nice. We ordered: Liege Waffle with Belgian Chocolate Ogura Bruxie Green Eggs and Ham (Special) Iced Caramel Latte Orange Juice I had an accident not too long before my visit, so eating was difficult. But the little that I was able to chew was perfection. I love waffles, and Bruxie knows how to make them. The red bean in the Ogura was well balanced by the sweet cream, so the texture wasn't overly tacky or 蕆ough. The chocolate on the Liege Waffle wasn't overly sweet, which was a relief since I don't like sweet chocolate. The coffee was coffee, it wasn't anything special. After munching on waffles, try walking the food off by visiting Old Town Orange. You literally feel like you're living in a movie while walking through the streets.

U ever go to sleep early just so tomorrow would come earlier and u can start eating again? That's the real reason i'm not a night owl! Bruxie was on my bookmarks forever and i had planned a date night for Mortons in anaheim and i knew that Bruxie would be a great place to start off our date (and eating!) early--- if we're gonna make the drive to the OC- why not knock off a couple of other places on the bookmarks RIGHT? I scanned yelp reviews to refresh my memory and we were gonna have sweets later (ofcourse) so i picked the most yelped about savory item - THE FRIED CHICKEN AND WAFFLES sammie with extra maple syrup added. (7.95) http://www.yelp.com/biz_�We really enjoyed this one. The waffle itself was super soft but with enough crunch on the edges. The chicken was moist and very flavorful. I LOVED how there was slaw in the sammie to add another delicious layer. 蔇ude ofcourse added hot sauce, which they provide on the condiments table. Added WAFFLE FRIES 蔲or $2.25 The WAFFLE FRIES were my fave fries i've had in awhile. seasoned really good- maybe a little on the salty side after having a whole batch. Loved dipping it in the maple sauce. We were orignally gonna just split one sammie cuz we had other places to hit, but while i was on the phone asking my friend what she wanted- Dude sneaked in an order of GRAPE SODA and GRILLED CHEESE WITH BACON. which was a good call, cuz the soda was delicious and although i probably wouldn't order the grilled cheese again- it made for a yummy extra snack. Next time, i'm for sure ordering their SWEET items or SECRET menu items. Very small location, no indoor seating, street parking, NO RESTROOM. line moves fairly quick. this is the OG location but there is another one in brea.

mmmm, I absolutely love waffles. and Bruxie helps satisfy my cravings! My favorite savory waffle would be the "green eggs & ham". It's a waffle sandwich with eggs, ham, cheese, and pesto sauce. So good! I've also tried the Nutella & Banana waffle, the PB&J waffle, and the seasonal Strawberry Cheesecake waffle :) They're all deliciousss. I will be back to try the creme brulee one sometime! p.s. The black cherry soda is BOMB. You must get it with your waffle sandwich :) It's also seasonal, and so try it before it's gone for the year.

LOVE, LOVE, LOVE! It's been my new favorite after being introduced to my friend at CU. They have a good selection on different kinds of waffles, savory or sweet, and have daily specials which I recommend everyone to try. The location is right across the street from Chapman University, so the parking there is terrible. Be prepared to touch up some of your parallel parking skills. The one bad thing about Bruxie besides their parking and NO BATHROOMS, yes NO BATHROOMS, is the price. It is a little pricey for how much food you actually get because I would definitely be able to have two waffles until I really feel full. The seating is all outdoors but during rush hour, there is almost always not enough space to sit and I find myself hovering next to the table that seems to be almost finished with their food. Besides that, I love coming here for lunch and a quick snack. The lines do get pretty long though, but generally they go pretty fast.

Waffle sandwiches? The OC definitely look a page from the Roscoe's Chicken n Waffles playbook and it surprisingly paid off. You wouldn't think it, but its actually pretty decent. I got the chicken waffle sandwich as well as the bruxie burger, and both were extremely delicious. They're both a little bit on the pricier side, but considering the novelty, actually tasted delectable. The only drawback to this place is the long line. Also, they don't do phone orders, which is a very strange restriction. I needed to get an order to go, and had to queue up like everyone else eating there, resulting in a 15-20 minute wait. Definitely not fast food, but worth it nonetheless.

Maybe I came here w/ expectations that were too high, but I just didn't like the food. The fried chicken was lacking in flavor, and though the syrup on the waffle had a really interesting taste, I definitely did not experience fireworks when I ate it. Everything was a little bland to me. The lemonade was tasty though, and the service was really good. All in all, food = 2, service/lemonade = 3.

Pretty good! At first chicken waffle sandwich got me thinking Roscoe's but this is a whole other beast! Belgian waffles and gourmet filling. I got the wild mushroom and arugula with goat cheese and a balsamic reduction because I couldnt get over the Roscoes type thinking. It was REALLY good and even though it didn't have meat it was quite filling. A little on the salty side though. The frozen custard is pretty good, a little to "eggy" for me, but I love the thick consistency. Its a little over hyped but its worth checking out.

I had some last week and I don't know why I went back. My experience at Brea was good but very unfulfilling. My friend from Riverside was in the area and I suggested we get some at the original location since I thought maybe it will be better this time, since it is from the original location and all. I had the fried chicken with extra syrup this time around and my friend had the Bruxie burger. The chicken was the same, the extra syrup wasn't as awesome as I imagined it to be (too mapley in my opinion). I had a bite of my friend's burger and I have to admit that was pretty good. My friend had the chocolate milkshake and I have to say that was very tasty and thick. Bottom line, my experience was very underwhelming. The waffle was still a bit too crispy for as the Brea location. Rating breakdown: Chicken Sammie: 2.5 Bruxie Burger: 3.5 Milkshake: 4

Game over- I am a waffles gal. I stopped in after a hike earlier this evening around 7 pm and it was packed. The first thing came to mind when I walked up to the stand, I thought it was a pretty nifty little place on the corner of a residential area. It was my first time here so i asked the staff about the menu and she recommended the fried chicken and waffles (of course). Dang, it was BOMB. The fried chicken and waffles were a perfect crunch, just the way I like them. Since it's just right up the alley, I'll definitely be back for brunch or lunch only though.

Chicken and waffle sandwich? Is there such a thing? One order of chicken and waffle sandwich with a side of slaw for $6.95 pretty sweet deal if you ask me. You order and they'll bring your order to you. The waffle was light and crispy on the outside, soft on the inside. The chicken was a perfect size and really tender. The maple syrup is amazing. Sucks that they charge $1 for a tiny side if you want extra..but overall great experience here and will be returning soon.

Ordered the fried chicken waffle + some asian waffle with red bean and sweat cream. I was somewhat puzzled by the concept of waffle sandwiches...how can this work? I thought this would be one of those frequent yelp opportunities to bash all the hype and say how mundane and boring the food is. I was wrong. The food was delicious, their menu is very diverse and their prices were not too bad (~6-10). I personally loved the fried chicken waffle because of their integration of a buffalo sweet syrup into the sandwich. It worked. The chicken also had a great balance of breading to chicken. It was not at all hard to eat. The dessert waffle I ordered was also delicious- I'm sure all of them are.

Bruxie is my dream food stand. Waffles really are a great vehicle for all foods, savory and sweet. The waffles are designed folded in half and sandwich-like so are made to easily share. Of course, I had to have the buttermilk fried chicken sandwich which was lightly battered, moist, and well seasoned. The extra $1 for syrup wasn't necessary. The other savory sandwiches like the burger and reuben seemed heavy for a hot day. Only one savory was necessary since so many of the desserts sounded amazing. We ordered the creme br瀕巈 with vanilla cream, burnt sugar, and berries. The special lemon meringue was my favorite with meringue, lemon curd, and bits of pie crust. For the desserts, every one of the components would have been amazing on their own but together was perfection. These people know what they're doing. Prices were good for the sizes and quality ingredients. 蔜here aren't very many desserts I don't enjoy but the taste combinations just worked and really blew me away. The desserts are sa-weeeeet (as they should be) so not for those who complain about sweetness levels. 蔍'm tired of being disappointed by experimental, trendy food so this was a real treat. It was worth the 15 minute wait during the lunch rush... they have a good system going too with ordering and service. Wish I could come all the time especially for the desserts.

This place really is a simple idea. Lets take sandwiches and exchange the bread for waffles. I only wish i thought of it first. The place is outside and while we found a place to sit pretty easy it looks like it would be really difficult on a busy day. I had a ham and cheese waffle sandwich with avocado and a strawberry lemonade. it was DELICIOUS! my friend had the burger and my other friend had the chicken sandwich. I enjoyed my bite of his chicken sandwich however, i wasnt a huge fan of the sauce that accompanied it. it was like a sweet chipotle almost. He wasnt too fond of it either. Other than that it was absolutely delicious. The fries arent anything special. The prices are reasonable as well. range from $5-8 for sandwiches. Servers were very nice. It didnt feel like we waited in line too long. No bathrooms so youll have to walk to find one.

Biggest OC Hype of 2011! Don't let people build it up too much for you. It's super yummy, but not omg-where-have-you-been kind of good. MUST ORDER: Green Eggs & Ham (it's usually off menu, but they can still make it) and Seasonal Creme Brulee! Don't miss out on the awesome soda (made with REAL SUGAR). Portion size is just perfect (this ain't the healthiest place to eat). I will usually share a savory & sweet waffle with a friend and get the best of both worlds. I prefer this original location over the new one. It's just a small walk-up window and outdoor seating, but I like the small neighborhood gem feel to it. Thanks Marilyn & Jon for draggin' me here :)

They have a really good concept here. waffles that you eat with your hand? AMAZING BUT Bruxie needs to change things up a bit. their food is really bland. even the syrup for the waffle. The chicken wasn't seasoned at all. Waffle fries weren't really great. Hopefully they change things soon. until then i wont be back.

YUM. I have to say: I'm very jealous of the students at Chapman because Bruxie is conveniently across the street from the school. Located at the corner of Glassell and West Palm, Bruxie is a must try and lives up to all the hype. Yeah, I was a bit skeptical about the whole waffle sandwich concept when I first heard of it, but with over 2000 reviews on Yelp and still maintaining 4-5 stars, I had to go see what it's all about. Stopped by at around 2 and there were maybe 4-5 people in front of me. I didn't have to wait long though to order and get my food. Total wait time: less than 10 minutes. There were a few first timers, including me, that took a while to decide what to order. But the process went by smoothly as the workers were all super friendly and very informative. I ordered: - Bruxie Burger (first bite into the crisp, warm waffle: yum! delicious and filling) - Ogura Bruxie (not super sweet, perfect amount of red bean and cream) Total came down to be about $12. I was talking to one of the workers while waiting for my Ogura Bruxie, and he recommended that next time I try the Nutella and Banana, except substitute the bananas for strawberries. "It's delicious. No doubt about it." Will do! Until next time, Bruxie! :) Side comment (5/27/2012) I had the chance to try their Smoked Salmon and Dill Cream Cheese Waffle and Chicken and Waffle. Out of the three, I tried, I say: if it's your first time here, please order the Bruxie Burger! I feel like if I had ordered anything else the first time I tried Bruxie, I wouldn't have liked it as much. With that said, I still give Bruxie five stars because it's delicious!

Did I go on an off-day? I was really excited to try Bruxie because of the crazy hype it was getting. 蔍've never been so confused about food hype. 蔍t wasn't bad, just not amazing like the people here would say. THE GIST: Friendly, energetic service / Tasty waffle, flavorless chicken / Tiny portion on fries SERVICE AND SETTING I went here on a Saturday night, barely beating the crowd. 蔍t reminds me of a Fosters Freeze, being a small little free standing kitchen with only outdoor seating. 蔅e careful, the parking situation around here is terrible and the line went from short to really long in a matter of seconds. Service reminded me somewhat of Chick-fil-a, where employees are bright and happy and actually ask you how your meal was unlike other fast foods like McDonald's. 蔕ur food came out relatively quick. FOOD AND VALUE Fried chicken waffle: I wanted to get the typical experience, so I opted for the first thing I saw on the menu. 蔜he waffle part is good, with perfect texture to build a sandwich with and some light syrup giving it sweet flavor. 蔜he chicken looked delicious, but I could not taste it at all. 蔍t was moist, though. Fries: Beware the tiny portion. 蔍t's about 3$ for what amounts to be a Kid's Meal sized amount of fries at any other fast food. 蔜he fries themselves were pretty good and the peanut oil definitely goes through, but I feel like Chick-fil-a has better. With a soda, it came out to about $13. 蔊iven the portion sizes, I feel it was overpriced. CONCLUSION The food was good, not amazing. 蔍 wanted to really like this place, but for now I can only say I'll return only if invited. 蔉or sure I won't order the fries next time!

The problem I have with Bruxie is that it's a hipster magnet for all the Chapman cool kids. Well no. Let me also touch on another reason why I just don't really like it here. The price. The stuff you find here is about a good 3-4 bucks way too much for what exactly you're getting. While waffles make for some great chicken or sandwich wrapping, it's just not very expensive to make. Nor is it something that is very complicated to make either. You just need a waffle iron and some dirt cheap batter with extra buttermilk. What? Did you expect it to be some miracle mix? No. It's simple. But it's also pretty damn expensive if you're coming here. I seem to find myself at Bruxie enough when I'm over picking up beer from the bruery. Which just makes me wonder why I bother going to that side of Chapman. I guess their strawberry lemonade is alright. But again, not worth the price they are charging.. Which is around $3 something or so. I pretty much hate myself whenever I go near this place and think to myself "You know, maybe I have this place all wrong", then drop way too much money for way too little food. Whatever. I guess it's one of those places you just need to go once just so you learn not to touch the hot stove again. But don't be like me where you get waaaay too drunk at the Bruery on their tasting flights and then stumble here and get a waffle sandwich. While good, it's way to pricey for what you're getting.

i love waffles like Leslie Knope loves waffles. The food that my group had here was disappointing, though. 蕎e ordered a bruxie burger, pastrami bruxie, fried chicken bruxie, and some kind of strawberry waffle dessert I don't remember very well. �The waffles we were served were all overcooked and crunchy. 蔜he fillings themselves 蕎ere moslty okay, but nothing blew me away. 蔍f the waffles had been perfect I'd probably have given this place 3.5 stars. Our favorite dish was the dessert. 蔠ish I remembered more about it so I could describe it better. �Fried chicken was alright, nice and moist . �The burger patty was solid. 蔄s stated previously, the waffles were really crunchy. 蔅ecause of this, they didn't really have any flavor or add anything to our chicken / beef. The pastrami was meh. 蔇efinitely order something else here because while they do the chicken and burgers well enough, the pastrami was definitely not on the same level. �2 stars because of our overcooked waffles. 蔍 plan on giving these guys a second shot, but am in no hurry to do so.

Bruxie is one of those local favorites you hear buzzed about but don't really appreciate until you try it for yourself. 蔅eing located down in OC kept me from actually checking out the location in Orange for a while, but after going I can see why the locals line up around the block to get a taste of their waffle sandwiches. Tucked away in a small Orange neighborhood block, the parking lot is a bit short on space so you may have to find a spot on the street. 蔄ll the seating is open air, as well as the front counter for ordering, with their menu on display above. 蔅ruxie's menu offers a combination of sweet and savory waffle sandwiches. �Similar to the waffles of Roscoe, they are thinner, yet still chewy with a hint of crispness. 蔠hile the meat or sweet fillings are tucked away in the folded wallet, 'sandwich' is a bit of an exaggeration and for some, its much easier to eat with a fork & knife. Fried chicken & waffle sandwich - A juicy filet of buttermilk deep fried white meat is seasoned with herbs and honey, garnished with fresh cole slaw. 蔍 could easily eat this every time I come. Guiness short rib waffle sandwich - Guiness braised chunks of short rib are served with waffle fries in the sandwich itself. 蔜he beef cuts were tender and easily fell apart with the touch of a fork. While I am biased towards the savory, the Belgian style waffles are probably still best experienced paired with fruit and maybe the best choice for first time goers. 蔛till those looking for a complete lunch shouldn't hesitate to try their buttermilk fried chicken and others.

Mmm waffle sandwiches. Looking for a quick bite but want a change from the drive-thru routine? You can't go wrong with Bruxie. If you like cheeseburgers, try their Bruxie Burger. Feeling fishy? Their Smoked Salmon & Dill Cream Cheese is delicious. They have a variety of condiments including hot sauces (my favorite!) Employees are on their A game when it comes to customer service. On our first visit, my boyfriend and I were greeted by a happy worker. He took the time to give us the Bruxie rundown and answer our questions. The atmosphere is relaxed; outdoor seating with heat lamps for chilly nights. Parking is scarce so be prepared to look for a spot. Give it try. The quality and price won't disappoint!

I've been here twice now and both times were delicious. It's a small hut that you order from and they have a small patio area where you can eat the food. It's on Glassell over by Chapman. There is generally a line, but it moves quickly. The staff there is always very friendly Unfortunately due to building restrictions, there isn't a restroom and the dining area is somewhat small, but most people are respectful of that and leave once they're done eating. Both times I went with the gf and we got two savory sandwiches, an order of fries, a sweet sandwich, and two drinks. Admittedly that's probably more food than what's needed. I think we could have split a savory and have been fine. Prices are generally $6-8 a sandwich. I've now tried: Fries: Very good waffle fries Sweet: Ogura Bruxie -Good, gf liked it a lot, but I'm not the biggest fan of red bean Nutella & Bananas -Also incredible, the Nutella, sweet cream, and layer of banana go great with the waffle Smore Bruxie -Rather tasty as well Savory: Buttermilk Fried Chicken & Waffles -Good, the honey/chili sauce that goes on it is quite tasty Prosciutto & Gruyere -Amazing, like a delicious grilled cheese with a bit of prosciutto to add to it Smoked Salmon & Dill Cream Cheese -Good, tasty Reuben (Seasonal) -Very good, but extremely hearty/filling, a bit oily though Lobster roll (Promotional) -They had this one for the Super Bowl (they also had a NY steak sandwich). It was enjoyable. Lots of lobster, could have used a bit more sauce though. Worth noting that it was twice as expensive. �The food really is quite delicious, with so many good things on the menu I encourage you to go with at least one other person so that you can share and get a taste of everytying.

My boyfriend just took me here this morning. We've driven past this place plenty of times and the line is always wrapped around the block. I've heard many of my friends talk about Bruxie so I was excited to finally get to go. On the way there, I looked up the menu online and was pleased to find it both affordable and with many varieties. The place itself is tiny and very busy. We got there around noon so the crowd wasn't bad. Bad enough to have to scout for a table, but without a long wait for the food. I got the smoked salmon waffle sandwich ($7.95) [Michel Cordon Bleu smoked salmon with herb cream cheese, cucumbers, and chives] and a decaf vanilla latte ($2.95) to drink. I had never had a waffle sandwich before and it was delightful! It was light and fluffy, yet dense enough to stay crispy the whole time and function as a sandwich. The salmon and cream cheese was amazing and hit the spot, even for my first meal. It was... The best texture, if you're into smoked salmon. The coffee was delicious as well. I can't say anything too special about it... Coffee is coffee. Overall, it was a fantastic date. Make sure you go when things aren't packed because it's quite nice to sit at an outdoor booth and take in the fresh air!

Delicious, delicious joint. Never in my life would I have thought I could find happiness sandwiched between a folded waffle. I've been to Bruxie's a couple times (I don't get to go much since I don't live very close by), but every time I've been there, it's been a delicious treat. My first time there, I had the chicken and waffle sandwich, and for my first chicken and waffle experience, I will say that it was yummy. The coleslaw definitely makes the sandwich, I just wish they would've put a little more attention to making the actual chicken yummy (I found it to be a little dry and thin). I also got to taste the smoked salmon one, and it'll probably be the next one that I order when I go there again. The second time I went, I went for dessert and got the Lemon Cream & Berries, and I gotta say, waffles make a delicious dessert. The lemon cream was tart enough to taste the lemon and the texture was light and creamy, and the berries were the perfect compliment against the light and flakey waffle. My one issue with this place is that it is so small, but it's in Old Town Orange, so I get why it's tiny. It's never fun looking for parking here, and it's a very popular joint since it's right next to Chapman and a huge staple for all the college kids and visitors. I also feel like a hawk when I'm searching for seating because it's pretty limited. Although my journeys to Bruxie are few, they are always worth it and I always leave satisfied and happy.

I have this place bookmarked for a long time and was trying to make my way down there from LA and finally got to try it over the weekend. when scrolling through the menu...i literally wanted to order one of everything.... I got the chicken and waffle b/c its an original and needed to try it as my first time......a nice thick piece of fried chicken glazed w/ syrup (good sweet+savoy mixture)...i wished the waffle was a bit thicker and more fluffy....still good, but expected a tad more... creme brulee w/ strawberries...luv it!!! frozen custard..interesting, thick and creamy..the creme brulee was better...this was not a healthy meal.. the service is what really gave this place the 5th star....its rare for fast food joints to have servers come around to give service. I asked for lemons w/ my ice tea and they didnt have lemons but gave me a shot of lemonade to mix in my ice tea....we ordered the frozen custard and they told us we can finish our meal and they will bring it out when we're ready...very compromising... they need to open more locations closer to LA.

Idea is very simple, replace the bread with waffles right? 蔠hat is so original and so great about it?? But dont think that way. 蔍 dont come here because its "Waffle sandwiches" 蔍 eat here because the sandwiches actually taste great, and in my opinion Bruxies can beat almost any sandwich joint. There is a tendency for long lines, dire need of more tables, 蔭nd awkward moments when you run up to the next unoccupied table and come face to face with 2 other strangers who had the same idea. 蔜hen there is a stare off to see who breaks and gives up the seat in a nice and polite manner "oh no you take it, sure thanks!" Very hipsterish ? �new era, new word" I have had their chicken waffle sandwich, green eggs and ham, pastrami, and turkey club. 蔜hey were all good!!! 蔮ut my favorite is the turkey club!! 蔊reat ingredients and you taste the quality! Bruxies is one of my favorite places for desserts too, their "Seasonal Crem Brulee" is off the frigin charts!!!!!! 蕎arm waffle, strawberries, bannanas, crem brulee?? 蔄MAZING!!!!

I never knew that a waffle could be so good. 蔅ruxie now calls a sweet corner 2 blocks north of the circle in Orange home. 蔍t had been the home to Sweet Treets for 64 years (a institution of a burger stand in Orange). 蔍 hope Bruxie is here for the next 64 years. We came at about 11AM on a Saturday, and there was already a line, which only got longer. 蔠e were immediately greeted by a staff member who welcomed us and handed us menus. 蔛taff was also writing down orders of those in line to facilitate the checking out process. 蔅ecause this is a food stand, folks are lined up along the sidewalk. 蔜here are about 12-15 tables around the restaurant (outside) with some patio heaters). 蔜here are no bathrooms. We ordered two sandwiches, which we split. 蔉irst, the green eggs and ham - a crispy waffle topped with cheddar cheese, arugula pesto, two perfectly fried eggs and grilled bacon. 蔋OLY MOSES - this is the best breakfast sandwich ever. 蔉irst of all, the waffles are the best that I have ever had. 蔜hey are not too sweet, they are not too greasy, they are super fresh, and they are perfectly crisp. 蔜he contents of this sandwich had sweet (cheese/egg), salty (ham) and fresh (pesto), which melded together in a flavor explosion. Second, the chicken and waffles with maple syrup. 蔄nother perfect waffle topped with a half of a chicken breast that is fried to perfection is a slightly spicy batter with a little tangy slaw and the sweet hit of maple (which is an addition that is not to be missed - they give you enough for 2-3 sandwiches, though). 蔍 could not believe how moist this fried chicken breast was or how perfectly crisp the waffle was. I am just thankful that I don't live closer. 蔍 would go here WAY to much and I would weigh twice what I do now. 蔜he sandwiches are HUGE, the flavors are ENORMOUS, the staff is so INVITING - I don't know where you could go wrong here. Seriously...I'll be back.

Despite the hype, Bruxie wasn't a priority on my list of restaurants to try; the thought of savory (chicken) and sweet (waffle) didn't appeal to me (after all, I did not like McDonald's McGriddles). I'm SO glad I was introduced to Bruxie -- and glad I chose to go with the Buttermilk Fried Chicken & Waffle on my first visit. The delicately crispy exterior and hot, tender interior of the waffle was... perfect. Then, paired with the chicken, chili honey, and cider slaw... surprisingly delicious! The Lemon Cream & Berries, too, was a delightful treat! I'm now a fan -- and SO eager to try many more of their menu items! The only part of the dining experience I didn't care for, was seating. Next time, I'll check out the Brea location, with inside seating and table service.

The line was insanely long since I came on a Saturday. This meant that finding a seat would be difficult, so get a friend to find a table while you wait in line. �The workers there are super friendly and helpful. �Try their pink lemonade; it's a bit sour and sweet at the same time. Every time I've been here, I've parallel parked along the street across from it, so I think you won't get a ticket for parking there.

I was told to go to this place with my cousin, and I blatantly had no disregard for a waffle sandwich. Wait why Harry? Why would you not go? Psh, I finally caved and finally took me and my happy little butt to Bruxie, and boy, humble pie for breakfast, lunch, and dinner. Wait what? I was proven wrong and as my friend and I drove to this location, I yelled out, "Oh S**t!" Why? Because as all small shops near a college campus, except for a few places namely UCI, doesn't have street parking, or a parking lot. When we got to the location there was a driveway and we saw a spot and quickly took it. +500 stars for a parking lot next to campus....-500 for only really having 3 spots. Anyways as we get off the car I see a lot of smoke but I was confused, it wasn't smoke, it was mist to keep the patrons cool. Good idea on a warm day. We walked to the line, and decided what to have, and it is a order, pay then sit down and wait for food. The employees came by a few times to ask what we were getting, and if we had any questions regarding orders. Wait whats going on? This isn't your average place to get food. Especially with the helpful employees. We order a fried chicken waffle sandwich, smoked salmon with Dill cream cheese and cucumbers waffle sandwich, and waffle fries. We were to sit down and water, ketchup, and agave syrup is get it yourself, and then the food comes out, and they call our names and brings it to us. I looked at mine, and I was skeptical because a fried filet of a chicken breast is and always is dry, no matter what. But it was different. I folded the waffle with the chicken inside and took a bite. Oh my gosh, I was so happy after the first bite, then the next bite and it was bloody amazing. YES I am aware I am over-hyphing it, but I want to go back and get another now. My friend finished her waffle sandwich and said it was different, using a waffle instead but its delicious. The waffle fries was dropped off by one of the employees and it was good. Granted I only had waffle fries once at Crossroads at UCB, but this was amazing, warm, and not too salty. Simply delicious. After we finished everything one of the employees came by and picked up our trash, wait why? We already paid for the food, should we take the trash and throw it away? Regardless, I've never been treated so well for how the restaurant operates on a pay then eat basis. I therefore, give you, Bruxie at 292 N. Glassell St. in Orange, CA, my 5 stars, you deserve it! I am aware I did not try their strawberry lemonade, nor their soda, and will do so when I stop by next time.

Waffles as Sandwiches, pretty sure I was sold at the waffle part. �Actually when I first saw signs for Bruxie about two years ago, I thought it was crazy, but in a effort to find new things in Orange, I decided to try it. 蔜he goat cheese and sun dried tomato pretty much 蔾nocked my socks off, and I have been hooked ever since. 蔍've tried sweet and savory, and haven't found a single one I don't like. �The natural sugar sodas and compost-able everything makes me even happier. 蔍t's really nice to see more places going green and leaving out chemicals. �The line can be absurd at rush times, but well worth the wait and once you have ordered they are super quick. 蔅est idea is to have one person in line and another to stalk for a table, or get it to go and go enjoy your delicious meal elsewhere, I have sat in the sun at Hart Park a few times. 蔖arking around Bruxie is also awful, but if you don't expect that in Old Town then you are being silly. �My only critic is that they use peanut oil, which is better for trans fats, but make is hard for people with an allergy to enjoy. 蔒y sister has had to listen to me rant for two years, but has never gotten to try them!

I've heard so much about Bruxie...read reviews, was told stories from amazing waffle sandwiches to delicious desserts... ...and last night I came to actually try it. Gross. And to be fair, we did not try the desserts, so maybe those would fair differently. 蔄nyways... I went with my girlfriend, on a whim, since we both wanted to try it. 蔛he got the Fried Chicken and waffle sandwich, I got the Short Ribs waffle sandwich, and we split a lemonade. 蔉ood came out quickly and LOOKED amazing. 蔋owever, we were both very disappointed in both the quality and taste of the food. 蔋er chicken was a bit dry and had random spots of flavor, where other parts were bland. 蔒y short ribs were very bland and overly greasy...not the type of good greasy from deliciously deep fried food, but the kind of greasy you'd expect from cheap shitty food served off a food cart outside of a club in Hollywood. 蔜he waffles had absolutely no taste, it was almost like eating the meat wrapped in soft ricecakes...soggy, gross ricecakes. 蔜he lemonade was...so-so. 蔔ot bad, definitely not amazing. 蔄t $3 a pop, I'd rather drink Country Time Lemonade drink mix... Service was quick, friendly, and informative...probably the only thing going to Bruxie. 蔕h and THEY DEEP FRY IN PEANUT OIL. 蔎ust a friendly warning to any of you allergic to peanuts. If you want REAL chicken and waffles, go to Roscoes in Long Beach or LA. 蔜hey actually have AMAZING chicken and waffles for about the same price you'd pay here at Bruxie. http://www.yelp.com/biz/�For a delicious short rib sandwich, go to Tavern on 2 in Belmont Shore, probably some of the best short ribs I've ever had...just make sure to either go light on the horseradish or have it come out on the side. 蔜hey tend to really pack on the horseradish...http://www.yelp.com/biz/tavern-on-2-?long-beach Bruxie, I wanted to like you, I really did. 蔍 heard nothing but good things about you, but last night's meal was a complete disappointment. 蔍 usually don't throw food away (I hate wasting it), but I couldn't even finish my sandwich...it was disgusting. 蔅ruxie's food, in my opinion, is the equivalent to gas station food...just 5x more expensive, but just as gross. Would I ever come back? 蔔ope, not even for free food. 蔄nd after 1000+ positive reviews, I guess I'm the only person who feels this way. I want my wasted $20 and 30 min of my life back.

This place is good...IF you like your hands soaked in oil after eating their waffle sandwiches. I had the pastrami sandwich. The meat was OK. Could have been a little more generous on the serving size I thought. The problem though is their waffles. I mean it smells good. That must be because they use tons of butter or something. But the amount of oil that soaked my hands while eating it. I think I clogged an artery or two. I could barely finish my sandwich, and I felt like barfing afterwards. I also had the waffle fries which seemed overcooked to me. They were too hard and crunchy for me. Lastly, don't get me started on the parking. It's a nightmare because there's only street parking or some lots that are a mile away. The lines are long but they seem to go by pretty fast. There's not much seating either. I stood there hovering over other guests waiting for them to depart so I could snatch their table. I don't like doing that. Overall, I won't be returning any time soon unless they stop soaking or deep frying their waffles! It's going to take me weeks to burn the calories I ingested there I think...

Yumm.. I really like this place. Aside from the weird area it was in, I had a very pleasant experience at Bruxie. Its my first time here and second time in the area. I'm not too fond of the area because is funky and parking is limited. I'm hoping that my experience for the area gets better after I visit it a couple more times. Anyways my sister took me here for lunch and we ordered the green eggs and ham sandwich and for me and for herself strawberry dessert and strawberry soda. The green eggs and ham sandwich was very flavorful. The waffles, eggs, ham, and pesto sauce were and interesting mix. The soda was good too. $1 refills wheee. Look forward to going back again.

Maaaaybe, just maybe, my impression of Bruxie is biased because I had awful food down the street the night before. Or mayyybe, I am actually unbiased, and the hype is real! Whatever the case, Bruxie serves up some darn good waffle sandwiches! My friend and I decided to stop by Bruxie's for breakfast on a beautiful sunny morning. There was parking right across the street, and since they were just opening for the day, there was hardly a line! While we were looking at the menu, one of their workers started talking to us, and I guess they just have someone out in the front to talk to people! Definite plus for friendly, personal service! We ended up ordering a turkey club ($9), the braised beef short ribs ($10), and a chocolate banana shake off the seasonal menu. When I tried a bit of both sandwiches, I couldn't help but pat myself on the back for making an excellent choice. :) The turkey club was so flavorful and fresh, and the waffle was delightfully crunchy and chewy! Yuummm! The short ribs were also good, super tender and tasty. But I prefer the turkey club because it was lighter. The shake was delicious too! Thick, creamy, chocolately, and banana-y - perfect! My one complaint would be that the waffles are WAY too greasy. I felt like fingerpainting with all that oil covering my hands. Blegh. If they can somehow make it less greasy but still this yummy, I would be there all the time! ...maybe it's a good thing they haven't gotten there yet.

Bruxie: So I'm late in trying Bruxie in the same way that I'm late in converting over to "Timeline" for Facebook. 蔣es, I know that everyone has already been to Bruxie, has already got a really cool picture inside of picture for their timeline, and has beaten me in all aspects of being cool. �Story of my life. But I finally pulled the trigger, trying Bruxie AND switching over to Timeline, all in the same week! 蔠hat a shock to my system that was. 蔅eing cool really takes a toll, even at the low level of coolness I inhabit. We happened to pick a delightful day to head out to Orange, and with the sun shining and people out enjoying it, it was a great day to people watch via Bruxie's moderately spacious outdoor seating area. �Our food came out fast despite it being crowded. 蔠e shared the Buttermilk Fried Chicken and the Prosciutto with Gruyere . 蔍 wish I would have ordered the fried chicken to myself, because it was seriously astonishingly good. 蔕ur "server" gave us the recommendation of throwing some sriracha 蕂n top to balance out the sweetness of the breading, and what a fantastic idea that was. 蔜he chicken was perfectly cooked, the waffle crispy and more airy than I had expected, and the overall taste balance being something like savory, spicy, sweet, STUPENDOUS! �Maybe it was because the fried chicken was so amazing, but the prosciutto was a miss for me. 蔍t just didn't balance out with the waffle, and kind of just got lost in the whole exchange with the mustard and waffle like one was in the middle of a Tyson � Pacquiao slap-boxing match. So I get it; Bruxie has a nitch, and they execute it well. 蔍'd like to try out their deserts, and a lot more of their menu, though with their signature dish being so amazing, it'll be hard for me not to order it in the future. 4 Stars.

When I first ate here, it didn't seem all that fantastic and I was whatevers but after the last couple of visits, I've become such a fanatic! I was just here only a few days ago and I customized my own waffle sandwich! I ordered the turkey club and replaced the turkey with fried chicken...Oh the powers above, let me tell you it was OUT OF THIS WORLD HANDS DOWN BOMBTASTIC!!!!! Every bite I took made me love it even more. I was incredibly blown away. The lusciousiousness. The crisp. The blasting flavors. The meaty juices. I was the happiest customer. Even the guy who brought my order to me complimented on how awesome the sandwich looked. After I ate it, I had to go tell the him how AMAZING it was. I was just beyond happy I needed him to know that it was the reason! This place is a walk up counter with outside seating and heat lamps. I love how friendly and helpful everyone is here. The staff has great customer service!! GREATEST Service. Wish restaurants would take after them! The fact they let you customise everything and anything is just so cool! I love it here and hope that everyone can share that same feeling. MUST FREQUENT this place! I am feening right now as I write this review. Mouthwatering kind of feening.

Bruxie blew up and before I knew it, I was ready to jump on the bandwagon. I've been telling the boy to come with me for months, but alas, (what is it..a year since Bruxie has graced us) I finally got the chance to try it. You would think the hype would have died down a little..just a tad...but the line grew longer as the night came. Luckily, we were able to snag seats and a Bruxie regular gave us the low down on what's good. My friend and her husband has tried nearly everything on the menu! That's dedication. We ordered up quite a storm. Here's the line up: Lemon Lime (Pure Cane) Soda, Wild Grape Soda, Cream Soda - SO GOOD The wild grape was awesome. Prosciutto & Gruyere - How can you even go wrong with prosciutto? This was good, but I think we had our fill of prosciutto earlier in the week that we couldn't appreciate it in fullness. Hot Pastrami with Pickles on the side - The bf LOVES pastrami so he was in absolute heaven. Smoke Salmon with cucumbers and dill cream cheese - Holy shat! This ...I can't even begin to express my newfound love...I drool. This one is probably my favorite of the bunch. We even got dessert...not one, but two. Might as well go the extra mile so we don't have to wait in line. Ogura Waffle - red bean with sweet cream. We love red beans so this was something we wanted to try when we saw it on the menu. The cream was sweet and had a hint of citrus. At first we thought they used lemon cream, but we couldn't place our finger on it. It was good either way and it was demolished. Strawberry Creme Brulee - WOW you get a taste of carmelized sugar, creamy creme brulee and sweet strawberries all in ONE bite. Again..inhaled in seconds. We are definitely coming back for more. Some items are seasonal so I'm excited to see what they will come up with for summer.

Waffle sandwiches...seriously, why didn't I think of that? After hearing about this place from everyone and their mom, I finally got the chance to try after brunch at Filling Station. The line seemed really long but my friend assured me that it goes by pretty quick which it did. The lines gives you time to narrow down what you want...there's so many yummy sounding items on the menu not to mention the specials they have for the day. We decided to go with their special savory sandwich of the day which was the carolina pulled pork sandwich with cheddar, cabbage and their homemade bbq sauce. The lady who was describing it to another person in line really did a good job of selling it so we had to. Thankfully, she wasn't kidding and it was pretty yummy. For some reason, it kind of reminded me of tuna. I think it was the herbs that were used and the cheese. I was seeing pulled pork but tasting tuna melt. Very strange but still yummy. I thought the waffle would be really filling but it's pretty thin and does a good job of not overpowering the insides. For sweets, we got the ogura bruxie and nutella w/ strawberries. The ogura has a red bean and sweet cream filling which I loved! It wasn't too sweet. If you love red beans like me, get this! Definitely for people who like Asian desserts. The nutella w/ strawberries was good too. You can't really go wrong with those ingredients though. The prices were pretty reasonable. For the three items and a tea, my total was a little over 20 bucks. This is definitely the place to go to if you're craving waffles. I'll be back their other savory creations and the liege waffle w/ nutella. So simple but it looks damn good!

There is a reason why people recommend Bruxie...because it's good! Came here a few times, and always got different things Chicken waffle: Juicy and tender. Very tasty. My bf's favorite at Bruxie Wild mushrom and arugla: I loved this one. It was light and fresh. Salmon: Probably won't get this one again because it had too much cream cheese and i'm not a fan of dill. Sun dried tomato: Good to try once, but probably wouldn't get it again. The actual sun dried tomatoes in it were not that good. It seemed like it came from out of the can. Hamburger waffle: My boyfriend did not like this one. Not that it was bad or anything, but nothing about it was spectacular. If you want some meat, definitely get the chicken waffle instead. Lemon and berries: I think this was the only dessert one i've tried. It was very delicious. Not too sweet which was the best part. Strawberry milkshake: good, but nothing special. Just be ready to wait in line if you go during peak hours. And parking is very limited.

WHY WHY WHY DID I HAVE TO HAVE A CANKER SORE THAT DAY?! We ordered at the counter and I love the customer service :) I got the tuna melt which is always my go-to deli sandwich and my boyfriend got the tri-tip. On top of that, I had to order the date shake and compare it to the crystal date shake of Coachella Valley. I heard this place gets packed at certain times so be prepared for a wait. Tri Tip- juicy and satisfying. Come's with a dip that goes great with their waffle fries 蕋oo :) I love the variety of the sauce bar so don't forget to customize your waffle sandwich with them! Tuna Melt- pretty standard tunamelt... except it's in a waffle! I LOVE WAFFLES AHNOMONOMNOM. i had to painfully bite into these sandwiches with that stupid busted lip of a sore. Date shake- booo. It was too sweet believe it or not. I was spoiled though. I lived in the area where 98% of their dates were exported... THAT GOOD. Anyways. Anything to do with waffles is a winner in my heart

EHHHHHH. I was really disappointed by this place but that might just be because i went into it with such high expectations. I decided to stop here for my pre disneyland breakfast since it was cheap & looked great on yelp. I ordered the bruxie cheeseburger & my friend ordered their chicken & waffle. We split and switched so that we got to try each other's. The bruxie cheeseburger was ok. It comes with 2 small patties with cheese, mayo, lettuce, tomato, & pickle in between a large waffle folded in half. The patties themselves were kind of bland and tbh, the only thing that really made this place decent was their ingenious use of a waffle as a bun. The waffle itself is great: fluffy on the inside, crispy on the outside & it was thick so it was able to hold together really well. My friend's chicken n' waffle was just ok. The chicken was basically flavorless beside the taste of salt, although it was better when eaten with the tiny side of coleslaw & vinegar honey. We both agreed that my bruxie burger was better. Plus, we had just had roscoe's the night before, so it was just an unfair comparison for bruxie in terms of the chicken n waffle. Overall, bruxie's waffles are great but the chicken & cheeseburger inside was pretty bland. I would recommend getting some of their other creations and eat it right away while it's still warm.

Get outta here.. waffle sandwiches?! Why has no one thought of this awesome creation until now?? Let me just say, these are no ordinary waffles. They are so crispy and it's not like your regular Eggo. The batter they use goes perfect with both the savory and dessert waffle sandwiches. Let's start with the savory. First time I came here, I shared the Br焫ie Burger with my boyfriend. Pretty much your average burger but with waffles as your buns. The meat was juicy, it was good, nothing to complain about. You should also order the waffle fries while your at it. They were also very good. The Buttermilk Chicken sandwich, however, is something else. The chicken is so moist on the inside and crispy on the outside. I'm not usually a coleslaw person, but the slaw here is different. It has like a vinegary taste to it, it was really good. For dessert I had to get the nutella and banana waffle. You can never go wrong with nutella. They add this sweet cream which isn't too overpowering and it surprisingly balances out everything. 蔕verall this place definitely deserves the 5 stars. The chef/owner is very nice too, he sometimes comes out to greet people and answer questions about the place. P.S. You sit and eat outside.

Loved the classic Liege waffle. 蔍've had true Liege waffles and their texture was spot on, but the sugar pearls inside should have been more caramelized compared to the ones I tried in Europe.

Roasted mushroom with goat cheese-yummy!!! Lots of fresh arugula. The waffle was crispy and light. So delicious! I liked this one better than the smoked salmon one. Nutella and Banana-yummy!!! Really great dessert. I think this is better than a nutella and banana crepe! The secret is definitely in their waffle mix. Parking-easy! Scored a spot right across the street. I went around 5:30pm on a Friday night. Nom nom nom. I am definitely a fan!!

Bruxie is a little on the pricey side, but they have high quality ingredients which they turn into high quality food. The buttermilk waffle is one of the best waffles I have had It's nice and crunchy on the outside, while still being sweet and fluffy on the inside. Unlike most buttermilk pancakes, you really can taste the flavorful sweet difference in the Bruxie waffle. Chicken and Waffle- I know everyone likes the chicken and waffle combination, but to be honest, I was underwhelmed by the 蔭ccompanying sauce. It reminded me a little of the McD's schezwan nugget sauce that came out with mulan. . . It might be my personal preference of balancing out the sweet with sour/salty/spicey, but I prefered tapatio over the honey sauce they gave. Irish Waffle Fries- Ok, so . . . waffle fries, are not waffles cut into fries. They are unseasoned crisscut fries. These are topped with a grainy cheese spread, and topped like a loaded baked potato with sour cream, bacon, and green onions. Really good, but gets to be a little too much after the fourth bite, so make sure you share. Belgian Hot Chocolate- belgian hot chocolate isn't as sweet as say carnation. But it's very good, very rich, and nice and warm if you are stuck eating your waffle outside. Personally, I like being cold, and eating toasty. But if you don't, their limited patio area has a plastic wind blocker you can pull down, or you can stand by the heat lamps in their standing eating area. While I'd like to see more seats, Bruxie's is a very solid joint, with excellent food.

Came here last Saturday night around 5:30 and there was not a line. But when we drove back by an hour later the line curved all the way down the street, had to be about 30+ people waiting in line! This place is amazing. I got 2 of the sweet waffles; smores and the Cr弇e br瀕巈 with seasonal fruit and I just about died. The Cr弇e br瀕巈 was seriously to die for. I shared it with my husband and everything in me wanted to snatch it back from him. He ate his savory one first (pastrami, which he said was the best pastrami "burger" he has ever had in his life and it was on a waffle!!!) and I had to sit there and look at the beautiful Cr弇e br瀕巈 waiting to be eaten. He did give me a bite of it though :-) I wanted more more more. 1/2 of 2 was not enough. I could have sat there and eaten till I burst like on Thanksgiving! We live about an hour away and this trip was well worth it. I would come back over and over just for these waffles. I want to try all the sweet ones because they all sound amazing. While the smores was good, I wish it was filled to the brim pouring out of the sides. The waffles were perfection. You would be missing out on something wonderful if you never came here!

Pretty damn good. Bf got the chicken and waffles and I got their Turkey waffle dish thing... SO GOOD! With the chicken waffles, get the extra syrup and take it home when you make those waffles/pancakes yourself once in a while. Def. worth it.

Prefer the Brea location over this location. 蔜hey have only outdoor seating and the lines were long. 蔕nly 30 minutes street parking around the area. 蔅e careful where you park as certain streets only allow residents to park. 蔍 ordered quite a few items: 1. Buttermilk Fried Chicken & Waffle--Ok/Pretty good 2. Carolina BBQ Pulled Pork-ok/Pretty good 3. Prosciutto & Gruyere--tasty (very little fillings) 4. Creme Brulee with Strawberries--pretty good 5.

My brother *RAVED* about this place and he rarely does things like that, so we had to go. I was intrigued, waffle sandwiches? The yelpers seem to really like it, what the heck! It being my first time, the gentleman taking our order was really helpful. He was clearly excited for me and even gave me a high five to commemorate the occasion. After asking a few questions, he recommended a few options for my savory mood: the chicken and waffles, the burger, or the turkey avocado. I opted for the turkey avocado. By brother got his "usual," the Bacon, Egg and Cheddar (BEC) and we split a cr弇e brulee (CB). First of all, I have to preface this with the fact that we took it to go. That being said, by the time we finally ate it, my sandwich was soft and tasted really greasy. The turkey was really good and the avocado was also really fresh and ripe, but the combo really didn't do it for me. I had a bite of the BEC, which was good and a bit of the CB. I guess the savory sandwiches aren't quite for me. But if I decide to go again, I'm going for the BEC.

It was a Sunday afternoon, and there was a line about 10 people in front of us. We lucked out on parking and parked right next to the place. Was a little skeptical about the hype of this place, but overall was quite pleased with my Bruxie's cherry poppin' experience. Staff was friendly and helpful. The atmosphere reminded me of Pink's as you line up and order in front of their stand. Then you scavenge around to find a seat.... We got sucked into trying their "seasonal grape soda" that they said was their last day of serving. . . it wasn't anything special... I ordered the smoke salmon & boyfriend ordered the chicken and waffles. smoked salmon was SO FRESH & DELICIOUS. the waffle was very light and not heavily floured. I had a bite of the chicken and waffles and it was actually really good too. Price is a little high, but worth having. i need to come back to try their creme brulee. . . until next time Bruxie! :)

Finally tried this place out after hearing all the hype. 蔝nfortunately it doesn't live up to it. 蔍t's OK. 蔜hat's it, just OK. �The waffle gimmick is cool but unfortunately their food is a little bland for my tastes. 蔍 really wanted to like the place. 蔅ooooo! Went right before the dinner rush so we didn't have to wait for anyone ahead. 蔜here was a bit of a wait for the food to come out, which is understandable. 蔍 had the chicken and waffles sandwich. 蔍 was hoping to taste a bold fried chicken flavor which would be kicked up by the sweetness of the waffle and syrup. 蔍nstead, the chicken had little flavor, although it wasn't greasy. 蔜he syrup was actually good... i used to to dip my fries in it (by the way, the fries are good but again, not a lot of flavor.

Came here with my wife at 8:30pm (Sunday) and there is a line about ~15 people. 蔠e are thinking, this must be good, and we were not disappointed. Chicken and Waffle: Delicious. 蔜he chicken is soft and moist, and with a light source and the crispy waffle, you can't get better than this. Bruxie Burger: The Angus burger is juicy and perfectly cooked. The buns are replaced with the same crispy waffles. All the staffs are very attentive and since this is our first time here, they give very good advices and explain things clearly. The only negative point is the price. 蔅oth the Chicken Waffle and Bruxie Burger are $7 without any fries or drinks. 蔄dding a fries ($2.5) and a soda ($2.5 no refill), it becomes steep for an outdoor join.

Just because it's different, doesn't mean its good. I give it 5 stars for originality, because I like the concept, but I was not impressed with the execution.

Ridiculously good waffles. 蔍t's best to come with friends and share a bunch of waffles so you don't get sick of one. BUTTERMILK FRIED CHICKEN The fried chicken is tender and amazing. This was one of my favorites although I couldn't eat the whole thing. CAROLINA PULLED PORK Amazing flavor. The meat is flavored well and so tender. One of my faves to get here. It's a specialty item so it is not served everyday. GREEN EGGS AND HAM Great light sandwich. The waffle and the ingredients on this one are light so you can eat the whole thing easily. TURKEY CLUB My friends loved this one and thought it was the best. I disagree, but it is still very very good. The turkey is slightly smoked and the waffle paired with it is just delicious. SHORT RIBS This is not on the menu everyday. It's a specialty item. Surprisingly it was not my favorite. The flavor of the meat could be better. It was kind of bland for me, and was quite thick. CREME BRULEE This is a sweet waffle. Couldn't go without a sweet one at the end. Very light and delicious. Loved the strawberries too. 蔍 would get this again. DULCE DE LECHE SHAKE Dear god so sweeet. My cousin got it and liked it, but with too many waffles wolfed down, i need something less heavy on the cream and sugar. ICED TEA Refreshing and very good. I recommend this since you are likely inhaling some thick waffles.

Nearly 15 months have passed since Bruxie's grand opening and my initial review in November 2010. 蔛ince then, Bruxie has improved their food, expanded their menu, developed the dining area, opened a second location in downtown Brea and was even listed as one Yelp's most popular restaurants of 2011. 蔣up, the little waffle shack by Chapman University has done pretty well for itself. �RECOMMENDATIONS (ranked from most favorite to least favorite) Bruxie Burger - Angus beef patty with cheddar cheese, sliced tomatoes, pickles, mayo and crispy lettuce. 蔣eah, it's basically just a cheeseburger... but it's a cheeseburger in a waffle. 蔄nd it works! Bacon, Egg & Cheddar - Tilamook cheddar, mayo, applewood smoked bacon. 蔍t's everything you could want in a breakfast, once again, in a waffle! 蔖ure genius! �蔄dd ketchup or hot sauce to your liking. �Buttermilk Fried Chicken & Waffle - Served with chili honey and cole slaw. 蔍 remember when they first served this, the piece of chicken was rather dinky. 蔔ot anymore. 蔔ow it's bigger, juicer and a must try. 蔋owever, I still think its ridiculous to charge $1 for maple syrup. Hot Pastrami (seasonal favorite) - Boar's head pastrami, Gruyere cheese, spicy brown mustard, cider slaw and half sour pickles. 蔍 wasn't sure if this would work, but it did. 蔒ustard was a little strong though and I prefer mine without pickles. PASS ON THESE (in no particular order): Pulled Pork (daily special) - Interesting idea, but the the pork is super bland. 蔍t could be great with BBQ sauce, but then it probably wouldn't work with the waffle at all. Lobster Salad (seasonal favorite) - Had this as a 4th of July special served with fries for $17.76. 蔍 love lobster but this was way too expensive and the lobster had absolutely no flavor. 蔋uge miss. Smoked Salmon & Dill Cream Cheese - Herb cream cheese, cucumbers and chives. 蔐oved the idea, but it just doesn't work on a waffle. SIDES Waffle Fries - Who doesn't love fries? 蔄dd them to your combo to save money. Irish Nachos (seasonal favorite) - Waffle fries, cheese sauce, sour cream, bacon and chives. 蔖retty good, but the cheese sauce could be better. DESSERT Seasonal Cr弇e Br瀕巈 - Classic vanilla creme with burnt raw sugar and seasonal fresh fruit (strawberries or bananas). 蔜he only sweet waffle I recommend. Frozen Custard - Soft serve Wisconsin frozen custard. 蔍t's a rich fresh ice cream enhanced with egg yolks. 蔍t's thicker, creamier and probably a lot more calories than regular ice cream. 蔣um! CONCLUSION The truth is that Bruxie is probably the most hyped restaurant ever. 蔋owever, the hype wouldn't exist without a solid product. 蔄 lot of their sandwiches are hits, but a lot are misses too. 蔣ou just have to find the Bruxie for you.

So I admit that I am a bit of an addict. In a good way, of course. I've tried everything on the menu, and most of them multiple times. 蔄nd usually when I come here, I also bring a horde of people like myself who order around 3 of these at a time. While everything is great, here is some of the AWESOME dessert waffles: (prepare yourself!!!) Nutella & Bananas Creme Brulee (THIS IS THE MOUTH HEAVEN!!!) Smores Ogura (get this with the ice cream on top! technically its custard because of the fat content due to the heavy cream - YOU KNOW WHAT THAT MEANS!!!) Here are some of the awesome entree waffles: Club (BEAST of a sandwich) Braised Beef Short Ribs These other waffles earn an honorable mention: Chicken (awesome sauce!) Burger (of high quality but standard components) Green Eggs & Ham (hangover helper anyone? make sure to add BACON!!!) I will admit that I have shied thus far from the other ones. 蔜he waffle fries are fairly standard (wish they gave you more), but the soda is definitely standout. 蔛omething artisan about it, and I will NEVER say that about a soda. 蔜hat says something to me. There is never really a short line nor readily available seating, but somehow by the time you finish ordering a seat has appeared. 蔒agical, just like that crispy folded part of the waffle. 蔛ounds like gibberish only until you've tried that specific part... 蔢D Try this place - it won't disappoint.

First time here around lunch time and there was a line around the corner... luckily it's not like Disneyland's lines yet =) 蔜hey have staff members welcoming the customers and helping them with choices to make the line go quicker. http://www.yelp.com/biz_�- From the seasonal specials menu, we got the Carolina BBQ Pulled Pork http://www.yelp.com/biz_�- $8.95. It was worth every penny and very mouth-gasmic! The flavors were so excellent that it didn't need the extra BBQ they offered on the side. The meat was succulent and cooked to perfection... no bit of dryness there. It's a must-try! http://www.yelp.com/biz_�- Valentine's Specials Feb 11-14th... From this we got the Chocolate Dipped Strawberry Shake http://www.yelp.com/biz_�- $6.95... a bit on the expensive side for a shake... but ZOMG! It knocked out Del Taco's Strawberry Shake down a notch and became our #2 favorite... it was sooo good... and to have the chocolate on the sides was a wonderful idea. Kudos to the mastermind behind the idea! With that in mind, it was a wonderful visit overall. 蔊otta come back to try their date shake to see if it's as good as the one out in Palm Springs.

What the heck! Do not come here if you are on a diet...of any kind! They have both excellent savory and sweet waffles. They even have the ever dangerous waffle fries and milkshakes - a glutton's dream. The people who work there are super friendly and helpful - seemingly a good sense of humor despite the cold (it was cold the night we went). I got a Bruxie's Cheese with avocado - soo good, it wasn't an overwhelming waffle and the amount of cheese was perfect. My friends got the burger with bacon, and they looked awesome...albeit a bit messy. I would make this a 3rd or 4th date kind of place :) They don't have indoor seating, but they have one area that is tented in and an area with several heat lamps (though several of them were broke) - so it can be a bit chilly at night, but it still doesn't matter...still awesome.

I was lucky that when I was here there was absolutely NO LINE.. Bruxie, you are exactly what I thought you would be delicious, tasty and perfect. I still think about you.. even if I am 100 miles away. Yes do get the dessert, and the original buttermilk chicken and waffle.

Bruxie is AMAZING and DELICIOUS! What isn't there to love about waffle sandwiches?! Especially the way these waffles were cooked. I came here with a group of friends when I was visiting SoCal and we started by sharing two waffles, a savory and sweet one, and finished by getting one last savory wafflewich. The waffles for each of the dishes had a golden hue and a slight crunch when eaten, but were still fluffy in the center. 蔄nd for those who are like me and enjoy a slight crunch in your food, this is perfect. The first savory wafflewich we got was prosciutto and gruyere with some sort of Dijon mustard. This was by far my favorite item we got. 蔍t was super simple, which made it even more scrumptious. The prosciutto was tender and there was enough on the wafflewich that we were able to get more than just waffle in every bit and the gruyere complimented the prosciutto beautifully. 蔜he gruyere was melted to perfection, which means that it wasn't chewy or stringy. 蔜he mustard was the perfect condiment to go with this sandwich because it really cut the saltiness from the prosciutto and enhanced the over all flavor. The sweet wafflewich we decided to get was creme br瀕巈 with seasonal fruit, which were strawberries. The creme br瀕巈 was wonderful. It was creamy and the burnt sugar added a nice crunch. 蔍'm telling you, I love it when I get a nice proper crunch in my food. :) I also feel like we got lucky with the in season fruit used because I can't think of any other fruit that I would rather have with this waffle than strawberries. 蔍t made this wafflewich quiet refreshing. Right as we were leaving I noticed a sign that we neglected to read when we got there with specials listed. 蔄nd the one special that caught my attention was the green eggs and ham waffle sandwich. 蔛hout out to all you Suessian fans who like to eat green eggs and ham! This waffle was complied of ham, cheddar cheese, arugula, an egg with pesto, and some mayonnaise. 蔄 couple of my friends and I shared this wafflewich and it was soooo worth it. 蔉or this wafflewich make sure you have enough napkins handy because it does drip or just eat it quickly enough so none of the flavor gets away. 蔍f you like savory with a lot of flavor, this would be a great choice if it's available. 蔍 would also recommend getting a drink with this wafflewich. All of the seating is outside, but they have a couple of different eating area options. 蔜hey have picnic benches close to the condiments bar, tall chairs with tables across the lot in a little fenced area next to standing heaters, and a standing bar area. In the price arena, wafflewiches cost between $5 and $8 dollars. 蔜he savory ones are closer to the $8 dollar range and the sweet ones are closer to the $5 range. 蔇rinks are between $2 and $4 dollars. Service was great. 蔜he employees were very friendly and helpful and we asked if they could cut our waffle into fourths and they did it easy peasy! I'm not sure if they do this all the time, but since we ate there they brought our waffles to where we were sitting when they were ready. I really enjoyed Bruxie and I can't wait to visit SoCal so I can get another wafflewich!!!

I'm vegetarian and I LOVED the wild mushroom & goat cheese bruxie sandwich with arugula, sundried tomatoes & balsamic reduction! Would come back again for sure, but it's just so small, so finding seats will be difficult. The staff is super friendly and awesome. Warning: The strawberry lemonade is RIDICULOUSLY sweet...not in a good way. I gagged the first time I had it. Now when I go with friends, we order one & split it amongst the 3 of us, diluting it in our water cups. Haven't tried their desserts, but would like to! (:

For the past year, or so it it seems, every single day one of my yelp friends is writing a review on Bruxie. Some love it and others think it's so-so. Bruxie! Bruxie! Bruxie! I see it over and over, the name pelting me mercilessly like rocks thrown by the neighborhood bully. Has everyone on planet earth eaten here except me? I was tired of feeling left out so made a special trip to see what all the hype and hoopla was about. I walked up to the ordering window feeling like this place really had to prove itself - I wasn't going to go easy on them. I decided to try both savory and sweet so I ordered a seasonal special Pastrami Bruxie and also a S'mores Bruxie. The handful of tables were taken so I stood at the counter at the side of the building. That was my preference anyway as I was alone and wanted to people watch while I ate. In less than 5 minutes my name was called and a friendly young fellow delivered my food. First of all, I have to say that seeing a waffle just makes me smile. Whoever thought of making sandwiches using waffles was brilliant enough to know that happiness is a contained in a waffle. The federal deficit could be eliminated in one year if they printed tax forms on waffles - we would all pay more than our share of taxes with a smile. Okay, I know I've gone too far. The Pastrami Bruxie consisted of Boar's Head pastrami, gruyere, spicy brown mustard, cider slaw and sliced pickle. The pastrami was tender and tasty - all the flavors blended perfectly (even the slaw, which I'm no fan of). Of course the waffle was masterfully done; firm so it wouldn't fall apart yet soft in the mouth with a crunch on the outside. How do they consistently make perfect waffles? I must admit it was a great sandwich. The S'mores Bruxie had melted chocolate and marshmallow with bits of graham cracker wrapped in a waffle. Rich and sweet and wonderful. The waffle had powdered sugar sprinkled on top which I managed to get all over my face, black trousers, and the counter. A young woman came to clean the counter when I was at my messiest and she just looked at me and laughed. I also got a vanilla cream soda which was good but nothing special. I tried hard to come up with negatives to keep this from getting high marks but there really wasn't anything except maybe the parking. You pretty much have to park in a public lot, the closest being two or three blocks away but I actually welcomed the walk after putting away all that waffley goodness. Bruxie, I know you were hurting for reviews so here's a 5-star one from me.

So I've been hearing about this place for ages. I even recommended it to someone as a first date location before I had even been! Finally I made my way over on my birthday and tried it for myself. Between my husband and myself I tried: Fried Chicken Creme Brulee Pastrami Waffle Fries It was ALL SO DELICIOUS! I can't wait until I can get back here and try out all of the other flavors. The wait: We came around lunchtime on a Sunday and the wait wasn't too long at all. We waited in line about 10-15 mins and once you placed your order, the wait to receive the food wasn't long at all. I was pleasantly surprised and impressed. ALSO: I think this place actually works really well for groups. You don't have to worry about splitting a check and everyone can share and try each other's waffles. There is plenty of room to stand around and chat. My group and I commandeered the bar area and it worked out great.

Soooo amazing! Our friends brought us here for the first time and it was just wonderful. How awesome is it to have a waffle with either savory or sweet goodness stuffed inside?!! We got the hot pastrami and the pulled pork special. I was lickin' my fingers every other bite. The line was kinda long for Saturday lunch but it went by surprisingly fast! We didn't have to wait much longer afterwards for our food. And they bring it to your table too. The price is about $8-$9 for savory ones and probably about $5-7 for sweet ones. I'm a fan!!

Originally i heard about this place from a friend's sister who had visited it often. The 蔯uriosity was there, but not enough to make the drive. Recently i had a photo shoot in Old Towne and my model suggested we have dinner at Bruxie, so i said sure considering it was less than a block away. There are a few spots behind the fast food joint you can park in, but people usually park in the street - there are no timers which was great. Upon arrival we were greeted by a server. Though, it was technically a order and go type place, they had someone bring your food out to you. I ordered the Bruxie Burger - and though it was plain, it still was cooked perfectly. I also ordered the waffle fries, which were the best in my opinion. At one point i did say to myself "Am i really eating a waffle filled with meat?" My only note is they should shade more of their outdoor seating as the sun can be a hassle, especially in hot weather. The food may look odd in pictures and sound even weirder when told about it, but in my opinion tasting is believing and i suggest you do just that with Bruxie.

Kind of not sure what the fuss is about....I mean, it's not bad, but it didn't wow me at all or whatsoever. �I had the mushroom goat cheese. 蔍 just kinda felt like there's nothing that's tying all the ingredients together, it's just mushroom and goat cheese, caught between 2 half slices of waffles...(once again, I demonstrate my ability to state the obvious....) �And it's not that cheap either, for about $8. 蔍 mean, why should I pay $8 for 2 halves of waffles with some cheese + mushroom on it? 蔕r fried chicken for that matter. 蔍 don't know, just not sold at all, cuz I was expecting something REALLY good, given all the 5-star reviews that I've been reading here. �Yes, it's an interesting concept, using waffle in place of bread to make a sandwich. 蔅ut just because it's interesting, it doesn't automatically make it good. 蔒aybe I just ordered the wrong item? �And one more thing about the Orange location. 蔉inding parking is horrendous. 蔜heir parking lot only holds like 4 cars, and very little available street parking. 蔍 had to park at a small parking lot 2 blocks away for a tiny sandwich that I finished in less than 10 min. 蔔ot worth the inconvenience in my opinion. �It's not them, it's me, and I'm just not a fan.

It was good but it didn't knock my socks off. 蔜he waffle was slightly crispy on the outside and fluffy on the inside. 蔅ased on some reviews, I thought 1 waffle wasn't going to be filling but I was stuffed. 蔜here's limited outdoor seating.

I'm a waffle lover and this place is GENIUS! Last summer I came here once almost every week (embarrassing but that good!) For your first visit (trust me, you will be back for more) I would recommend ordering the (savory) Bruxie Burger and (sweet) Liege Waffle with Nutella (can never go wrong with nutella). The only downside I would say are their drinks (meh, not a big fan). Note: depending on the time and day, there will be a long line BUT It's worth the wait! Also, if you can't make it out in Orange go to the one in Brea (also good and bigger location!)

OK, so I didn't want to order the chicken waffles this time because I wanted to avoid the sticky fingers plus I thought the prosciutto and gruyere was better....and once again it didn't disappoint. It taste really damn good when you throw some siracha on it, but sadly I feel like you would have to order more than one sandwich, I would not recommend coming here on an empty stomach on a budget because a waffle sandwich is about 8 bux. parking sucks restrooms are across the street at Chapman U.

We stopped Bruxie to meet up with my cousin that was in the area. 蔅ruxie takes a nice twist on your ordinary sandwich by switching up bread for waffles. It is nestled at the end of a strip of shops in Old Towne Orange and across the street from Chapman college. 蔜he line wasn't as long as it can get, but it's probably given the fact that we arrived at 6pm instead of 7pm. Parking in the area can be tricky on weekends because the parking lot is so small you have to find street parking. 蔄lso, there is limited outdoor seating, but we were lucky enough to grab a table during our visit. 蔄fter you order at the stand your order will be brought to your table. Buttermilk Fried Chicken & Waffle My friend, Steven,chose the Buttermilk Fried Chicken & Waffle. 蔋e said he enjoyed his waffle, but it wasn't as great as everyone says it is in my opinion. I felt that it was missing something. 蔖ossibly because I was too frugal to spring for the extra syrup? Who knows. Bruxie Burger Burger in a waffle. 蔙eplace buns with waffle. Pretty self explanatory. Prosciutto and Gruyere I got the prosciutto and Gruyere and I liked it a lot. 蔜he waffle was very crunchy and the Gruyere set off the saltiness of the prosciutto very nicely. �Waffle Fries Very good, but on the salty side. 蔍 wish they offered other condiments for dipping besides ketchup and sriracha. Green Eggs & Ham My Cousin Jenny got this waffle. I would say that this is my favorite waffle out of all the savory waffles. 蔍t can definitely be enjoyed any time of the day and the pesto sauce used to make the eggs green, definitely adds a lot of great flavor. Strawberry Creme Brulee Waffle Lastly, we all shared the strawberry creme brulee waffle. 蔜his waffle was so creamy and delicious that you must get yourself to Bruxie ASAP to try this. 蔜he creamy creme brulee filling won't disappoint.

First time I came, I ordered the smoked salmon -- which was just okay. 蔇idn't know if I particularly liked it on a waffle. 蔜he second time, I got the pastrami which was YUM since I love pastrami! 蔜he more chances I give this place, the more and more I liked it! �This past weekend, I got the Turkey Club -- recommended by one of the staff -- which is not posted on their menu but apart of their daily sandwich choices. 蔍'm never too fond of just a turkey club when I go out to eat, but I don't know what it is about this sandwich that makes me wanting more. 蔍t is just done VERY well .. with the bacon and avacado, everything just went perfectly together. 蔒y bf got the bbq pulled pork which was good for him, and just okay for me since I'm not a big bbq fan haha. 蔋e did say that he would probably order the pastrami over the bbq pork next time. 蔉or dessert, we stuck with our usual creme brulee waffle which is a must try if you haven't already! �We went on a Saturday late afternoon around 2pm, thinking the line wouldn't be bad but boy were we wrong. 蔠aited about 20 minutes and it was very hard to find a seat. 蔔ext time, I think we'll skip visiting Bruxie on a weekend.

Finally got to try Bruxie on NYE and I was so ecstatic! This place have been bookmarked for quite some time. So I ordered the Seared Salmon with Cream Cheese and made it a combo with the waffle fries for $10.99, drinks not included in a combo. It's different but pretty good. I shared half with my boyfriend because we both had previously ate dinner already. The waffle fries tasted like, well regular waffle fries. My friend ordered the S'mores waffle and it was pretty good, despite my "meh" attitude of chocolate. Seating are all outside but the staff are nice enough to bring your order out to you while calling your name. This place is worth coming to, though it is not cheap. I want to go back and try the banana and Nutella waffle.

I'll give this place a 3.5 I first came to this place maybe a year ago? The place is a little hut where you can order food & sit outside & eat. It's located in orange near the orange circle so yes this place is small. But over the year they upgraded a lot. Their place is much nicer than before. I usually come here for the Strawberry creme brule waffle. It's delicious!! I think it's kinda expensive $6 & it's not that big either. I also tried one other item on the menu. It was on the "specials" menu, i believe it was krn bbq waffle? I did not enjoy that at all. i think it had cottage cheese or some bitter sauce in it, totally ruined my meal. Anyways, Maybe i'll try the chicken waffle combo one day, that's what everyone talks about! Oh yeah & the employees are very friendly & interactive!

The waffles were crispy and light. 蔛eems like you are eating an airy-crispy sandwich. Decent priced. I want to come back and try their dessert waffles and sides. Good Coffee - Peet's coffee.

I love the Bruxie Burger...pretty and pink please! I love the strawberry creme br瀕巈. I love the seasonal strawberry soda. I totally dig their waffle fries. I wasn't a big fan of the chicken and waffles or the strawberry lemonade but maybe that's because I like my chicken deep fried and my lemonade more tart.

One review in the sea of reviews for this place. I will make it quick then. No parking, Limited seating. Heater did not heat enough on cold day. Reminded me of San Francisco. Staff were great; nice and helpful. Chicken and waffle: Chicken was good, sauce a little sweet for my taste. Waffle was nothing special. I would have liked a more Belgian style waffle. Burger: Just replace bun with waffle. Just a novelty. Waffle with lemon and berries: Sweet dish and worked very well. My favorite part. Shake: Very good. Price: This place is an indulgence. $30 for 2 people. A little steep for regular lunch.

I love waffles. And I love putting other stuff I love in waffles. It's a love fest at Bruxie and it certainly found its way into my heart. DK was visiting and what better excuse to go to a place I've been dying to try? Called ahead on December 26 to make sure it was open. The girl who answered the phone was super nice. I found out that was the case for all the staff there. You can park on Glassell, but make sure to read the signs. Some are 30 minutes, some are 2 hours and some are permit-parking only due to Chapman U being right there. If I went to college there, I would probably eat at Bruxie at least 2x a week. The line was about 10 deep, not that bad at all for lunchtime. As we stood in line, a guy asked us if we were newbies and needed any help. We asked him for recommendations and he said everything was good. That was no help. Then some guy took our order while we were in line and handed us the order sheet to give to the cashier. Super efficient! We got: Roasted Mushroom & Goat Cheese with Fresh Basil, Arugula and Balsamic Reduction for 7.95 Buttermilk Fried Chicken & Waffle with Chili Honey and Cole Slaw for 6.95 and you can add 100% Pure Maple Syrup for 1.00. The guy told us that people like it, but he didn't think it needed it. So we went sans syrup. Then got a couple of pure cane colas. Yum. It's all outdoor seating. We managed to sit at a table (only a few there, and then some high-tops in the parking lot with heat lamps (not needed when it was like 75 in December in LA) and some counter space where you can stand and eat. Most people ate fairly quickly and left, so people usually don't loiter. They brought us our drinks and our food. We got asked if everything was okay and if we needed anything, separately. Both sandwiches were great. We just cut them down the middle and shared. The chicken was fried to perfection, and didn't feel heavy. The roasted mushrooms was like a salad within the waffle.

Good, not great, but am willing to try more menu items. Tried chicken/waffles and grilled cheese (added ham). First off, the waffles are excellent, perfectly light and crispy not greasy at all as others mentioned. Not sure how it comes if dine-in, but to-go was just the waffles, small cup of slaw & a dipping sauce (Thai sweet/hot?). Was good, but something to tie it all together was missing (gravy? sauce? veggies?). 蔍 dunno. 蔜he grilled cheese with ham was excellent. My 8yo devoured it. I'd return to try more menu items.

1 big piece of buttermilk fried chicken sandwiched between a large folded waffle, topped with just a hint of lettuce to give you the (oh so false!) impression that your fatass is being slightly healthy while you consume this fried goodness. The chicken is tender and covered with a slightly sweet syrup, and the waffle is crispy and not too heavy. And as if that isn't heaven enough, top off your meal with a sweet dessert of strawberry creme brulee waffle. Two of those same crispy waffles, folded over a filling of vanilla cream, fresh strawberries, and syrup, and all topped with confectioner's sugar. Hangover, what hangover?? This place does get busy though, so expect long lines, difficulty parking (there's a small lot behind the shack that gets full fast), and a mad dash to claim a table!

This place was so amazing that we came here for brunch, came back for dinner, and were already hyped about future visits. We also got the strawberry shake (seasonal) and it was one of the best custard shakes I've ever had. Can't say or eat at Bruxie's without smiling! :)

My first impression of Bruxie are thoughts of an interesting twist to already good food. Mixing breakfast items with dinner entrees gave me some doubts, but it was a pleasant mix. The service is great. The lines are long on weekends, and don't mind the young high school crowd. I need to come back and sample the rest of the menu. I started at the top of the menu and enjoyed the Fried Chicken immensely. I just need to prepare for the sugar overload. (Outside seating ... takeout)

I actually thought Bruxie's was a restaurant until I got there and saw the long line that winded around the store. There isn't really parking and it's right across from Chapman University, so be prepared to park a little further and walk. I was super excited to try Bruxie's, since I had heard so many good reviews about it. When lining up, I could already smell the waffles - it smelled really good! I was a little put out by the prices, but hey ... if everybody liked it, it ought to be worth it, no? I ordered the Buttermilk Fried Chicken and Waffle with a side order of waffle fries. It was about $10 and the food came out fairly quickly. There are water cups and ketcup on the side, which was really great, but nowhere to sit. My friends and I wandered over to the University, which was pretty much dead on a Saturday afternoon and sat on the steps to eat (Gossip Girl status!). I was a little disappointed when I saw my food. Basically a piece of chicken between two waffles ... with some lettuce and a chipotle syrup to drizzle onto the chicken. It wasn't too heavy, but at the same time ... it really lacked something. The syrup was too sweet and sour for me and I just wished there was more ... substance, if that makes sense. It just wasn't worth the seven bucks. And the waffle fries - about six fries for $2.30. I prefer Chick-fil-A's or even Carl's Jr's fries. I did try the Bruxie Burger, which was a lot more filling and hearty than the chicken. Perhaps because it's basically a hamburger in between two waffles. But my roommate said ... why order it here when you can order it at McDonald's? - true! Another friend had the Smoked Salmon and Dill Cream Cheese, which she said was delicious. They also ordered some sort of fries with basically the baked potato condiments on top of it. That was pretty tasty - though I'm sure it was filled with calories! I was also able to try the frozen custard, which was a lot more delicious than I thought. Better than the simple soft serve ... very creamy, smooth, rich but still light! It was pretty great. I had a few sips of the Vanilla Creme Old Fashioned Pure Cane Sugar Soda which was way too sweet. Not a good choice to accompany the food unless you get a sweet sandwich. I heard that the Green Eggs and Ham is good and the Sweet waffle sandwiches looked really delicious! Perhaps I'll try that next time...

Finally a reason to make a food pilgrimage to the OC! My entire family absolutely loves this place! Food: It's like someone took the Roscoe's concept and went one step further. Basically, everything you order here will feature a nice steamy waffle as the carb source. I had already eaten dinner so decided to get a dessert waffle, the ogura bruxie (http://www.yelp.com/biz_�. The picture really does not do it justice. This concoction is basically a smattering of delicious red bean with cream in a crisp, warm waffle. What could be better than that? Anyway, I need to come back because they also have a huge menu (http://www.yelp.com/biz_� http://www.yelp.com/biz_� of sweet and savory items, including a fried chicken sandwich, that I've been dying to try. Atmosphere: This place consists of an upscale shack complete with super swanky heated patio (http://www.yelp.com/biz_�. Apparently it gets super crowded during most times of the day due being conveniently located across the street from Chapman University and the sheer fact that it is famous. Be prepared to wait a bit unless you happen to go the day after Thanksgiving like I did. Service: Order at the window. Your food will be ready in a jiff. Synopsis: So good. This is a must if you're in Orange and want to scope out the culinary scene.

My husband, roommate and I have only been talking about coming here for the better part of 6 months. We finally did today. It was a beautiful day so the drive from south county to here was pretty enjoyable. Old Town Orange is really pretty and a great sight to see. Parking is pretty rough, but we found a spot and got in line. The line for food wrapped around the building. I had heard it was busy but hadn't really anticipated the line being so long. It was worth the way though. The customer service is great. Someone greeted us when we first got into line. We were handed a menu and given some time to look over it. After we had a chance to look at it the girl came back and asked if we had questions. She gave some great info and suggestions. The service at the window was great too. Then when we got our food, they forgot my husbands fries but they were super quick to get them out to him. My husband had their pulled pork special and we also ordered the S'Mores and banana/Nutella. I didn't have any of my husband's pulled pork but he devoured it. He said it was a good sandwich. Both of the sweet sandwiches were soooo good. Very satisfying.

Please keep in mind this is just a preliminary rating based on their sweet item. Since I did not have a chance to try any of their savory items, I will defer to update my review until I've had a chance to try. So, you're probably wondering why 2 stars when over 1,000 reviewers have rated this place an average of 4 stars. Quite simply because when I ordered my sweet waffle it was practically burnt. I ordered one of their original sweet waffles called "Chocolate Filled Liege" waffles. It's basically a waffle with caramelized pear sugar baked into the waffle and stuffed with Belgian chocolate. The problem was the waffle was burnt. In hindsight I should have pointed that out to them and had them remake me another, but unfortunately I ordered it to go and by the time I drove off in my car it was too late. I understand there's cases of imperfection, most definitely in my case, but it should be pointed out that when the main item on the menu is a waffle, I think there needs to be a better way to over see the quality of the food before it reaches the customer. It should have been obvious that the waffle was burnt and at at that point tossed in the trash. I'm pretty sure it doesn't take hat much time to remake a waffle, and personally I don't mind waiting an extra minute or two for one that isn't burnt.

Bruxie is something you MUST try for true foodies. Mmmmm holy greasy goodness! Sure, it's 100 degrees outside, but who cares? Sun stroke is for wusses. I'm here to eat my waffle sandwich! Nom nom nom... The play of sweet and savory is definitely clutch. The waffles were cooked perfectly and that crunch is on the money! 蔜hing is, it was so greasy that I had to use a napkin to soak up all the oil. 蔣es, yes, I know, it's fried chicken,but other fried chicken was not drenched in grease like this! �My brother got the bruxie burger and it was pretty delish. The burger was most and clearly home made. None of that crazy frozen patty. Everything else in it was pretty normal though. Lettuce, tomatoes, onions, cheese, pickles. The waffle was light but didn't get all soggy or anything holding all the ingredient. My friend ordered the Nutella and Banana waffle sandwich. So bomb!

Haha, I kinda wrestled with the idea of wasting my time on a place with 1800+ reviews. 蔜his is one of those reviews that's going to get lost, real fast. Anyway, 5 stars isn't going to shake things up, but here's the obvious: this place isn't overhyped. 蔵t's delicious, fast, and convenient. The line looks daunting. 蔅ut it moves quickly. 蔜hank God. 蔍 had about 30 people in front of me and got to the window in about 15 minutes. 蔛peedy! I got the seasonal creme br瀕巈. 蔋OLY MOTHER. 蔄mazing. Boyfriend got the Bruxie Burger and only wished he would have ordered a side of maple syrup. 蔍t's an extra cost, but necessary to give the burger an oomph. The vanilla cream soda was pretty damn tasty as well. 蔊ave our Bruxie food that old-fashioned, comfort food type feel. The mocha shake was just decent, so avoid it and get one of the sodas instead. I followed the tip that says to order the waffle "well done" if you're taking it to go; so it doesn't get soggy. 蔊REAT TIP. 蔍 took it over to a nearby park to enjoy because the availability of Bruxie seating is just... well you know how it is already. 蔜he consistency of the waffle was PERFECT. 蔎ust the right amount of fluff and crunch. 蔔ot burnt, not too hard, not even what you'd imagine "well done" to be. 蔍 was a little wary of getting something overcooked but I am SO GLAD I ordered well done and didn't have to deal with a soggy sandwich. Thanks Yelp!

Buttermilk fried chicken, sandwiched between two slices of crispy waffles--YUM! I came here with a few friends. Street parking was pretty limited, granted that Bruxie is located down the street from what I believe is a college. Other than the lack of parking, Bruxie was spectacular in terms of food. We tried the waffle fries, buttermilk fried chicken waffle, and the prosciutto and Gruyere waffle (http://www.yelp.com/biz_�. The waffle fries were not what I had envisioned. For some reason, I had expected pieces of fried waffles; what I got were Crisscut french fries. There wasn't anything special about them, so I will more than likely pass on those next time. On a lighter note though, the waffle sandwiches were delicious! The buttermilk fried chicken was surprisingly tender inside and crispy outside. The waffles were a nice contrast to the typical sandwich bun. The prosciutto and Gruyere waffle tasted fancy. I am personally not a fan of the saltiness of prosciutto, but it completed the Gruyere quite nicely. Bruxie is a tiny shack with only outdoor seating. We enjoyed our waffles as we people watched. Prices were reasonable and the staff was extremely friendly--I will surely be back.

Waffles that are light and airy and don't stuff you down after a couple of bites. Filled with things either savory or sweet. Buttermilk chicken. Prosciutto and gruyere cheese. graham crackers. nutella etc. I love their concept and they have some of the best waffles I've ever tasted. Line is usually long but it goes by quick. They'll even someone take your order while you are standing in line. Delicious food. Price is alright, wouldn't consider it the best bang for bucks, but definitely worth trying. again. and again. till you've tried their whole menu.

I had bookmarked this place a few months ago and forgot until I saw it listed as a top Yelp restaurant for 2011. I went yesterday and was pretty surprised to see a long line for a Sunday afternoon. The line moved fairly quickly, and I placed my order after 20 minutes or so. I took my parents as my treat, and being the hungry family we are, we ordered the Bruxie Burger with avocado and a side of fries, the Hot Pastrami Bruxie and the Carolina Pulled Pork. For dessert we got the creme br瀕巈 and ogura bruxie. Since it was sprinkling and seating seemed crowded, we ordered it to go and ate at home. Everything was absolutely delicious!! I wish we ate there though, because the waffles were a little soggy. My dad loved his pastrami sandwich and was actually full, surprising considering he usually complains about places never putting enough meat in sandwiches. The pulled pork was also jammed full of meat, and the sauce was delightfully tangy and spicy. The Bruxie wasn't too special, but still tasted amazing...you can really taste the buttermilk waffle! The desserts were yummy too, especially the creme bruelee. Overall, it was a great foodie experience. Service was pretty fast and servers were very friendly and polite. The atmosphere seemed fun and energetic, and although i cant say it compares to somewhere like Ike's, I'd definitely like to stay and eat there next time!!

Bruxie was my first experience with waffle sandwiches, + I'm glad we had 4 people in our group, cause we were able to try 6 sandwiches and also the Irish nachos (which are not on the menu, but are cheesy waffle fries with bacon, cheese, chives, + sour cream. OMG heaven) We HAD to order the chicken + waffles, which sounds ridiculous but then you take a bite. It will make your tastebuds go insane with deliciousness. 蔜he lox and chive cream cheese was my absolute favorite, but really, we didn't have anything that was not incredibly delicious. There's both sweet and savoury waffle sandwiches, depending on your mood. We tried the lemon cream and berry sandwich for dessert, which is probably the best dessert I've had in ages. 蔙eally outstandingly good. My mouth is watering a la Homer Simpson's just thinking about how good it was. The only gripe is that this place is all the way in Orange, + I live in South County. 蔄ctually, that shouldn't be a gripe, because I'm sure I'd be here daily if it was close to where I live, + I'd be a lap-band candidate after a month.

This was my first time going after hearing sooo many good things about this place. I came in with my family after an afternoon at the beach. We arrived around 7 pm. There was a short line. The restaurant was all outdoor. Parking was difficult since some parts you needed a permit to park....so be careful where you park. We had the Turkey Club, Chicken&Waffle, and the Smoked Salmon with Black Cherry Soda. For dessert, we had nutella and half banana&strawberry (have to ask for half strawberry&half banana;no extra charge). The turkey club was uhmazing! The waffle was so light and crisp. All the ingredients mixed perfectly. The black cherry soda was really good. Their sodas are locally crafted. You most definitely can taste the difference. I wasnt a big fan of the smoked salmon. The salmon was fresh but the sandwich was missing something. Next time I would trade that sandwich out for the mushroom, goat cheese & arugula sandwich. Overall, fresh yummy food for was a good price.

how i love thee, let me count the ways... I have only been here once, but it was all too amazing! maybe it was the bright carefree saturday or being around great friends, either way i was content inside and out so what to do if you cant decide, have awesome friends that will order other items on the menu and share! - Hash & Eggs (special for that day, it was their standard prosciutto & gruyere + hash & eggs and came with a dipping sauce that was a mix between salsa and aus jus) by far the favorite of the day, i only wish my stomach was larger so i could've ordered another - Nutella & Bananas - really cant go wrong with this winning combination, for those of 蕐ou who lack a sweet tooth you may want to avoid - Green Eggs & Ham (another special for the day, ham & eggs with a pesto sauce) delicious but still could not compare to that Hash & Egg + Parking is kind of awful, but there are other shops on the way, so it's not too bad + Tables must be trolled, felt bad for hovering around other people, but space is limited + Super friendly service, once you do find a table they will bring more bruxie goodies to you! thats right! you dont have to wait in line for a second time!

I like the concept. I really do. What to do when you have a craving of waffles AND chicken? Well you can either to go Roscoe's Chicken& Waffles (which is pretty damn good btw, especially their macaroni and gravy dip yum), OR you can go to Bruxie's. However, make sure to order the classic chicken waffle if you're craving something hot, as I made the mistake of ordering the smoked salmon waffle which is both cold AND dry. And the sauce that comes with the chicken is pretty good too. I don't know for certain 'cus I just stole a bite off of my friend's, but I definitely savored that one bite more than my entire portion of salmon waffle. I'll probably come back (for the chicken waffle!) if we happen to be the area but nothing to go out of the way for.

I love Bruxie! This is a quaint little restaurant/dive located in the quaint town of Old Town Orange. I love to come here on a Saturday afternoon, eat a delicious bruxie, and take a stroll. My favorites are the Strawberry Creme Brulee and the Green Eggs and Ham. The strawberry creme brule comes with a delicious home made custard and a "burnt sugar" sauce which adds a special flavor to the bruxie. The green eggs and ham is suprisingly flavorful. What makes it green is the pesto sauce. I know it sounds weird...eggs....pesto. But trust me, it works. I have also tried the fried chicken, which was ok but the slaw they top it with is a little too sweet for my taste. There is always a long line but don't be intimidated, it moves quickly! Only problem is the limited seating. 蔣ou have to creepily stalk people who look like they are ready to leave if you want to get a table.

Ever since I tried Bruxie at the new Brea location a few months back, I have not stopped thinking about these waffle sammiches with fluffy, buttery batter and fresh, savory ingredients. I was instantly in love! Like my last time at Bruxie, I had a hard time picking what I wanted to try. I had the Bruxie Burger, and ordered the chicken and waffle to-go for the sick bf. I also requested both waffle sammiches to be cut in half, to try the bf's chicken and waffle. :) For the more clumsy eaters, I would suggest your orders be cut in half as well... the sammiches hold together much better! I witnessed a waffle skeptic in my party quickly turn into a believer after finishing the Bruxie Burger. The ingredients of an ordinary burger (patty, tomaters, lettuce, mayo) meshed with a waffle bun just transforms it into something extraordinary and delicious! ... and Roscoe's ain't got nuddin' on Bruxie's Chicken & Waffles! A semi-thin chicken breast patty, lightly breaded and fried, on an airy waffle with the texture of a potato pancake, has never tasted more perfect combined. The chicken was so juicy and moist, considering it's chicken breast, and it's healthy without tasting like cardboard! I brought the sammiches back for the bf, and they were still really savory, although they had gotten cold, and we were too lazy to warm them up. The waffles got a tad soggy, but was still crispy for the most part. For such a low maintenance spot, the customer service exceeded my expectations by a long shot. From the moment we stepped in line, a staff member asked if we had any questions about the menu, and made herself available to answer them if we came across any. While we were eating, the bussers came by to clear our empty paper boats. They were very friendly, and happy to give us insider tips on ordering strategies. :) Although Bruxie looks 100% a hole-in-the-wall with all outdoor seating, nothing about the high-quality food or stellar service screams it. 蔒y goal is to try everything on the Bruxie menu. With the seasonal rotating specials, this may be a more difficult task to accomplish, but since this Bruxie is no farther than 10 minutes away from Disneyland, I can see myself frequenting this location much more often.

4.5 stars. An absolute must for anyone near Old Town Orange that wants a truly unique experience. There are awesome combinations of both rustic and comfort foods sandwiched between fresh golden crisped waffles. 蔔o wonder there is a line at least a half a block long. The wild mushroom and goat cheese waffle topped with arugula is just divine, and the buttermilk chicken breast waffle is moist, and large and in charge. Pure cane sodas and fresh hot crisscross fries complete the ensemble (but be careful you allergy prone litigious patrons...they do fry in peanut oil). 蔄nd how can you not be tempted by one of their very rich Wisconsin frozen custard based shakes? (There's quite a variety to choose from: Try the Purple Haze, Dulce de Leche, Date or other varietal) �Even though the line looks a little daunting at first glance, it moves relatively fast, and the crew is on top of it, turning orders in a mere minutes. 蔉ood is hot, delicious, unique, fun and satisfying. 蔒aybe a bit too much (if that's really a complaint). 蔍 found my custard based shake almost too rich by the end and I was hopelessly STUFFED after just one waffle sandwich and drink. Parking is a bit difficult in the neighborhood, and outdoor only seating is limited. 蔜hankfully on cold days they have a few propane heaters about to help take the chill out, but otherwise you're either standing or sitting in a parking lot. Staff is very friendly and deliver to wherever you happen to be standing. 蔄 selection of basic condiments are off to the side and could be a bit more accessible, especially since this place is crowded

On my latest foray to Los Angeles, my local Yelp Elite friend CherCharm C kindly took time out of her schedule to meet me at Disney. When we had to decide on a spot for lunch for a post of lunch, she mentioned that she had wanted to try Bruxie for awhile. "Gourmet waffles?", I said, wondering what they were but I've always learned to trust the instincts of my local Yelp friends. Well, they're not Yelp Elites for nothing! So, off we went, navigating using CherCharm's trusty iPhone. Luck was with us for parking as we eased into the last parking spot in the small lot at Bruxie. You order at the window and friendly runners deliver the food promptly Well, yes, they have transformed the humble Belgian waffle into a substantial meal. We went with the buttermilk fried chicken and one of their special, ham and green eggs. Both were tasty. The waffles are a good alternative to bread, being a little crunchy and not sweet like normal waffles. CherCharm had a cup of their fresh strawberry lemonade while I couldn't resist a milkshake, one of my indulgences while on holiday in the USA The outdoor seating was perfect for enjoying the Californian sunshine Thanks, CherCharm - I would never have found this place on my own!

I really am baffled by all the incredibly high ratings for this place. 蔍 wonder if I really am one of the very few people who just don't "get it" or if this is a case of mass hysteria over a crazy trend, plain and simple? �I will keep the review short and just say I have eaten here three times, tried all various types of what they have to offer (sweet, savory, you get the point) and dang, talk about GREASY, soggy waffles filled with other greasy, mushy junk. 蔄pparently everyone likes this texture except me. 蔍 felt like I should go work out for at least 35-45 minutes each time I ate here and twice I only ate half of what I got because the grease just overwhelmed me AND I didn't even enjoy it. �If you enjoy needing at least twelve napkins to clean all the grease off your hands and face after eating a meal and you enjoy soggy waffles folded over various types of food AND you like to feel that awful "blech" feeling after having eaten something that you know for a fact is not good for you in any way then you're in luck...Bruxie is the place for you! �X

It's really only OKAY... not filling at all, and kinda expensive for a college student on a college budget. 蔍 love Old Town Orange, and it's a great location, but Bruxie is more "eh" than amazing. 蔜heir dessert waffles are really yummy, but basic, and I could probably make it myself. 蔍t's fun to try and experience Bruxie, but not a staple for me. Although you could spend under $10 a person at Bruxie, you're still almost paying $10 for a waffle folded in half with some sweet condiments and fruit stuffed inside. Not quite worth the 10 bucks.

This was my second time at this super popular restaurant. Got there probably around 12:30 and the line was about 100 people long. I'm not even exaggerating. The good thing is that the line moves fairly quickly. This is definitely not your typical sandwich shop, since they make crispy, buttery, heavenly Belgian waffles instead of bread! What we tried was the Buttermilk fried chicken and waffle with maple syrup, Carolina BBQ pulled pork waffle-wich, and I finally got to try the waffle-cut fries that I've been wanting. The pulled pork was their special for the day. I couldn't decide whether to get that one or the pastrami with gruyere, but one of their staff members who was taking my order just wrote down the pulled pork wafflewich after telling her my conflict. The buttermilk fried chicken is thin enough to eat easily, but thick enough to have great texture. I sort of wish it were fried a little crispier, but the waffle is plenty crispy to compensate. Ordering the maple syrup with it what puts it over the top. Everything was just really flavorful and mouth-watering and stomach pleasing! The evil geniuses behind the Wafflewich shall be hearing from my stomach again soon enough. Next on my list of items to try is one of their sweet delights!

My coworkers were raving about this place. 蔍 thought, waffles & sandwiches combined, why not. �I ordered the Bacon, Egg and Cheese savory waffle sandwich it was delicious. 蔍 order maple syrup on the side, it didn't need a drop. Another coworker got the fried chicken waffle sandwich to which there was no complaints. 蔍'd highly suggest trying this at least once. 蔜he only downfall is lack of seating area, and parking. 蔄s half the parking lot is used for seating, make sure you come early or late if you're thinking of doing lunch. I definitely will be back.

So, it took me a while to visit this place, but I am so glad that I did!! I got the bbq pork special and it was pretty good. The flavors went really well together and best of all the waffle didn't fall apart! The best part of my visit was the custard waffle with seasonal strawberry. AMAZING!!! I will visit occasionally for a savory waffle, but I will definitely go back more often for the sweet ones!! Oh, and fresh strawberry lemonade!! mmmmmmmm

I had been wanting to try Bruxie for a long time. Orange County is getting better bit by bit at having unique and non-chain restaurants, but it's a slow journey. Being my first time here, I dove in both feet first. I ordered: - vanilla cream pure cane soda - buttermilk chicken waffle sandwich - strawberry creme brulee waffle The soda was absolutely delicious, but this could be because I haven't had a full-sugar soda in ages. Either way, I highly enjoyed such a rare treat. The buttermilk chicken waffle was my favorite. As people have said here before, you can get some pure maple syrup for an additional dollar, and while it wasn't necessary, I found the syrup useful for the extra pieces of waffle that were left over after I finished the chicken. The chicken was perfectly warm and crispy, not too heavily fried. The glaze was perfect with the sweet waffle. I know not everyone "gets" why waffle sandwiches would be such a big deal, but the perfect answer is this sandwich. It's light and fluffy enough to really taste the chicken, glaze and slaw, and adds just a little sweetness that tastes great on top of the chicken. This was my favorite part of the meal. The strawberry creme brulee waffle was great. I was worried there wouldnt be enough carmelized sugar, which is my favorite part of creme brulee, but it was definitely present. The strawberries tasted a little under ripe to me, but the mix of everything was great. Only gripe is all the cream made the waffle a little soggy. Plus, I was already so full from the chicken waffle, I think I may not have enjoyed this dessert waffle as much as I would have on an empty stomach. Atmosphere is fun, love the fire heaters outside, good friendly service and a fun place for friends. I knock off a star because - and I'll try to be as lady like as possible here - my tummy didn't so great later that night and the next day. Definitely think I over did it!

This is NOT Roscoe's type of chicken and waffles. Gimmick food near a college campus. 蔛ervice is friendly and super quick. Chicken had way too much sage. The $1.00 charge for Maple syrup is a rip off. 蔜he waffle fries were good. Overall not impressed.

I am completely obsessed with this place. 蔍've been here too many times to count, and every time walked away completely stuffed and satisfied. 蔆all me a fat kid because I always get one savory and one sweet for myself. 蔍 will never be able to choose one over the other. 蔣ou have to eat it on the spot or the waffle will get soggy. 蔅ut I'm sure if you took it to go it would be devoured by time you reach the car. 蔜here's always a line, no matter what time of day it is. 蔠ait is always worth it because the food and customer service is exceptional. 蔍've even turned friends and family into repeat customers.

Came here with my friends a few times. 蔐ines are sometimes really long and the parking was difficult to find. 蔜heir parking lot only fits around 3 cars? You'll usually have to park on the streets....

Love, love, love Bruxie. I've tried the fried chicken, smoked salmon, cheeseburger, lemon creme and berries, and the nutella and bananas. All were DELICIOUS! Although, 蔍 love salmon, I wouldn't order it again. It got kind of... how do I say this... tiring? Haha. But I'd definitely try it! The lemon creme and berries is to dieeee for. I love sweets, so this one definitely hit the spot! The fried chicken is glazed with this tangy honey that makes it realllly good and the cheeseburger one is HUGE. The nutella and bananas waffle has some kind of cream in it, which makes it bomb. Don't get too worried if there's a long line, it goes by quick and you get your food pretty fast too! Everyone says that the portions are too small, which is true, but I always order 2 sandwiches lol. Overall, try this place out! It's a cool concept and it tastes bomb :) The only thing I don't like about this place is the seating. They need more seats!

This was a decent novelty but the prices are high for what it is. 蔄ll beverages are over $2.50 I believe. 蔉ries are $2-2.50 so a meal is usually over $10 and not worth that. 蔍 had the fried chicken waffle. 蔍t was tasty but the chicken could have been more plentiful. 蔍'd go back once more, mainly to try frozen custard unless the pricing is more competitive.

This place is absolutely amazing!! I didn't think anything could go so well with waffles! My friend took me here for the first time a while ago after a day at the beach and since then I've been back a multiple times! The waffles are fresh and crisp and the food that fills and tops the waffles are amazing and delicious. The first time I came here I tried their pastrami waffle sandwich which was amazing! It's a definite must try and must get. If you can't decide on what to get off their enticing menu, you can never go wrong with the pastrami. The desserts are beyond delicious and always leave your taste buds wanting more! Their nutella and banana topped waffle is one of my faves especially since I'm a huge fan of nutella! I'm definitely on a mission to try everything off their menu! Their menu can give you hungry eyes since you always end up being hungry for more! Try it and I guarantee you'll be back!!

I seriously hate reviewing places with 10000 of reviews, but I just can't help myself with Bruxie. I mean, waffle as "buns"? freakin genius. I wasn't sure how I would like the savory/sweet combination, but I ended up just loving it! Neither one overpowers the other. You get the heartiness/meatiness of the burger patty and just a hint of the sweet, buttery waffle to top off the flavor explosion in your mouth. THIS kind of restaurant makes me feel proud to pull on some sweatpants and just enjoy my extra pound or two.

Bruxie's sorta reminds me of a Wienerschnitzel. A small stand when you line up and order and all outdoor patio seating. Of course gourmet waffles trumps hotdogs for me any day. =) Green eggs and ham. DELICIOUS to the hizzle! It was my first time here, so I'm glad I got to try something that was really tasty. Menu looks really delicious. Great variety of savory and sweet waffles. 蔒y friend and I shared the green eggs and ham and also the prosciutto and gruyere. We also ordered a side of waffle fries. Food came fast! Green eggs and ham: The eggs were cooked wonderfully and was just runny enough that it made each bite juicy but without making the waffle soggy. The waffle stayed crispy the entire time! The ham was also really good and wasn't too salty. The pesto sauce was also another tasty addition to the whole combination. Prosciutto and gruyere: I could taste the prosciutto as much as I tasted the gruyere. So the whole thing tasted like cheese. When I opened up the waffle, I noticed there wasn't much spread in it. Maybe the lack of spread affected the taste? 蔍t was light though, but overall in comparison to the green eggs and ham, not as tasty. Waffle was nice and crispy though. Waffle fries: Fried to perfection and not greasy. Yay! Seating is limited, so be on the lookout if you have a group larger than four. My friend and I found seating on the side of the building, but it gets pretty sunny mid-day. And there wasn't much shade. But the food was too delicious to notice much. Share your waffles (easy to cut in two!). So you can try more. =)

Chicken and waffles. I'm over the novelty of it since I've been a fan of Roscoe's since college. But this was different. It was chicken sandwiched in a waffle. While that didn't sound entirely appetizing to me, I ended up ordering it as recommended by Carol L. What I found myself with was a thin waffle sandwich with crispy chicken in the middle with a tasty chili honey sauce. It came with waffle cut fries lightly seasoned. We also ordered: - The prosciutto & gruyere - Green eggs and ham - Strawberry creme br瀕巈 - Bacon, egg and cheddar - Bruxie combo fries Everything was delicious. Perfectly thin waffle sandwiches. I'm definitely a fan.

I LOVE Bruxie! If you are a fan of waffles, you'll love this place. Everything is made on a waffle. The chicken & waffle is good, but its no Roscoe's. I prefer the dessert waffles over the sandwiches. They have a cheeseburger waffles, pulled pork, turkey club...but my ultimate favorite is the lemon-cream & berries! I am not even a fan of lemon but one bite & I was hooked. Also, the strawberry lemonade is delicious! If you go during the weekend, be prepared to wait for a table. Seating is outdoor and very limited. Service is great though. You can order, find a seat, & they will bring your food right out to you. Try not to get addicted.

Bruxie's waffle sandwiches are deeee-licious! It was my first time there, so I was kind of skeptical at how this was going to work. When I got home and opened the to-go box, turns out these waffle sandwiches are pretty huge and stuffed with goodness! The waffle itself is crispy (although probably not as crispy as it would've been if it wasn't sitting in the box and basking in its steam) and perfectly browned. It just adds that much more quality to the sandwich. Here's what we ordered: Classic reuben ($7.95) - It was stuffed with layers of meat, cheese, and sauerkraut in Bruxie's special sauce. Combine this with the crunch of the waffle and I was in heaven. The sauce didn't make the waffle soggy, so that's a good thing. Pastrami ($7.95) - This one was overflowing with shredded cabbage, quality tasting pastrami, and a slice of pickle. This one will really hit the spot for that special pastrami craving. Waffle fries ($2.95) - *shakes head* These are pretty big and super delicious, but I literally got like 6 pieces. Why so STINGY? I even took a picture of it to show how SAD looking it is! Overall, I had a good experience with Bruxie. Ordering was a cinch and wait time for our food was not bad at all, considering how many people there were tonight. I think their seasonal menu is an excellent idea to change things up a bit. The price is a little expensive for me though, so I won't be frequenting this joint.

Excellent waffle sandwiches! I thought the waffle was crispy and light as advertised. The best bet here is their signature buttermilk fried chicken and waffle sandwich, $6.95. The fried chicken was tasty, juicy, not too oily and lightly covered with a sweet honey dijon mustard sauce, layered over a perfectly baked, light waffle shell. Delicious! I passed on adding maple syrup to the sandwich for an additional $1.00. No syrup on my chicken! I never understood the appeal there. My second choice would be their smoked salmon & dill cream cheese waffle sandwich, $7.95. Thinly slice smoked salmon layered with herbal creme cheese, cucumbers and chives. I always enjoy this combination on a warm, toasted bagel and, in my opinion, it works just as nicely on a crispy waffle shell. The sweet, dessert sandwiches, however, were a huge disappointment. I ordered the Liege Waffle with Belgian chocolate and carmelized pearl sugar. The Beligain chocolate was cold, too thick and the waffle shell was rock hard and also cold. Their old fashioned pure cane sugar soda was not a big hit with me either. I tried the root beer and thought it was flat and not creamy or sweet enough. I guess I'm not opposed to the high fructose corn syrup you find in most soft drinks nowadays if it means more flavor, so add that baby in there! My suggestion is you stick with the savory and pass on the sweet.

My friend finally convinced me to break away from my Bagel Me addiction and try out Bruxie when I was last in the area. 蔍 didn't want to admit how much I enjoyed it so that she could rub it in my face that it took me so long to go. 蔠e went with a group - her getting the mushroom waffle, the hubby going for the bacon, egg and cheese, and I decided to try the creme brulee. �蔠e sampled each others creations and they were all delicious. 蔍 love the thinness of the waffle, so it's not overpowering but instead, the perfect vessel with which to enjoy their delicious fillings. 蔕h, and we had to get waffle cut fries, which were perfectly salted. 蔄nd their milkshakes? So delicious and decadent. 蔍 really should have shared it based on the size, but I couldn't bring myself to. So, that gives them the four stars. 蔜he fifth star comes for service. 蔍 watched as a table of 5 with two small children whose milkshake basically exploded all over their table, bench, and floor. 蔜he parents took charge of the kids, barely cleaning up anything, but the staff swept in instantly to clean up the mess. 蔋onestly, I was floored by how much they did. 蔛ome places would hand them some napkins and call it a day, but they were practically mopping the floor to get the mess resolved. 蔅ut this was standard - they kept the entire area in good condition, offering to clean up completed items from tables without people just leaving behind a mess, checking in on the waffle orders and how people were enjoying their food... not bad for a waffle stand. We came again shortly afterwards and saw the same service and exceptional food. 蔜hat cemented in my mind that it was time to give credit for this delicious eatery. 蔍 can't wait for my next visit when I can enjoy my Bagel Me and Bruxie waffles.

4.5 - I came back for round two at Bruxie not too long ago with a fairly large group of friends. We arrived around 5 pm on a Tuesday even and there was no line. This was a nice change of pace from the usually very crowded Bruxie. My fabulously foodie friend, Christina and I decided to each order a savory waffle and then share a sweet waffle. The special of the day was the turkey ruben waffle, so I decided to order that - it just sounded so good! Christina and I decided to split the creme brulee waffle since I had tried the smores, as well as the pb&j. We got lucky and landed the longer picnic table since there was about 8 of us. As everyone has mentioned, the seating can be tricky; you almost have to have perfect luck for it to work out correctly. That turkey ruben special was the bomb! The meat was incredibly tender, juicy, and flavorful...mmm! The swiss cheese was ooey-gooey good, and the Russian dressing/saurkruat combo was wonderful. My only gripe about this tasty waffle sandwich is that the sandwich got soggy super fast, so eating the second half was a bit interesting. Because the flavor was so good though, this did not really detract from the overall waffle sandwich experience. Oddly enough, what is keeping Bruxie from the 5 star in my book are the sweet waffles. I feel a bit ridiculous for liking a savory waffle better than a sweet one, considering that probably 99.9% of all waffles consumer are with syrup, for breakfast. The creme brulee waffle was just a bit off...I don't know how to explain it. The custard just wasn't as good as the waffle itself. I haven't found a sweet concoction from Bruxie that I'm wild about, so maybe next time I'll have to keep it old school and simple, and go for the nutella waffle. The savory waffles are crazy good - haven't found one I don't love. And the service is incredibly friendly.

Not all Bruxie Sandwiches are created equal. Some have more sustenance than others. Sometimes the waffles are light and fluffy (the way I like them) and sometimes they are crispy (me no likey.) I highly recommend Green Eggs and Ham (often found on the Specials board not on the regular menu). The Bruxie burger is great. Pulled Pork good. Smoked Salmon Dill is tasty but not a lot of food. Buttermilk Fried Chicken and waffle was literally fried chicken between two waffles and a little coleslaw- they could have been more creative with the filling. Roasted Mushroom and Goat cheese also tasty but not a lot of food; was still hungry after finishing. I did not enjoy the lemon cream and berries. When they say "Intense" lemon cream they mean it. Much too lemon/tart. I like real s'mores but found the Bruxie S'more sandwich to leave something to be desired- I think mostly because the waffle was too crispy- but then again graham crackers are crispy and I don't mind that...I can't explain but would not order again. I have also tried the Black Cow & "Old Towne" cream float- was too sweet for my liking. Would stick with good old fashioned rootbeer float. Even when the line is around the corner, it usually only takes about 30 minutes to order and get food. Worth it!

I LOVE BRUXIE. I'd love to be a regular here, though traveling here can be difficult as it's right by the Chapman campus, and at the edge of old towne Orange. Be prepared for parking disaster and perhaps walking very far. But it's worth it. It's an outdoor-only corner joint which can be bothersome for some, depending on the weather. They have small tables and seats around the place, with umbrellas and awnings. The food. So good. The prices may not be worth it if you're super hungry...one sandwich may not be enough to tame your stomach. My boyfriend got the hot pastrami, and I got the ham and egg. Mine was really good, and pretty light to eat. The pastrami one was more loaded, and it was amaaaazing...both our sandwiches are made hot with the waffle nice and crispy, which I love. I also got a chocolate mint shake, and he a purple haze (frozen custard + grape soda). The purple haze wasn't so great, but if you're a fan of grape I'd go for it. My chocolate mint shake was like drinking thick ice cream--WHICH IS AWESOME. It was heavenly, though toward the dregs of it, it was sweetness overload. Savin' this in my bookmarks for sure. Would love to try more things on their menu; they have got quite the variety, and lots of specials!

This place lives up to its hype. Waffles, meet reinvented. Their parking lot is tiny, so try to street park. I came from the 22 freeway and there was a roundabout on the way! I thought that was the coolest thing ever... I am so lame and need to get out more. Anyways, don't be intimidated by the line; it moves surprisingly fast! When you order, you tell them your name so that when your food comes out, the worker will call your name and bring your food over to your table. Nice! To the side of the store, there are forks, knives, napkins, Tabasco sauce, etc. Also, they have plastic cups and free ice water available for you to help yourself as much as you'd like! For the food, here's what we ordered: -CHOCOLATE SHAKE: Oh my goodness, this was AMAZING! Thick chocolate shake topped with FRESH whipped cream and chocolate shavings. One of the better shakes I've had in a while. -CAROLINA BBQ PULLED PORK: comes with Slow-Roasted Pork, Cheddar Cheese, Cider Slaw and their own Bruxie BBQ Sauce. This was a bit messy to eat, but the pork melted in my mouth. Literally. I inhaled this thing, nom nom. -NUTELLAS & BANANA: comes with sweet cream. My brother, who has the biggest sweet tooth ever, couldn't finish this because it was too sweet. Thick nutella, thick bananas, this was too much for me. -STRAWBERRY CREME BRULEE: comes with strawberries and classic vanilla creme with burnt raw sugar. This was SO GOOD, you really can't go wrong with strawberries and waffles. I felt like a million pounds after this meal, but Bruxie was so worth it!

YAAAAZ! This place is delicious. I won't blame them for not having a huge storefront with ample parking. Starting small is good. We did have to park down the street though. I visited this place twice in the same week, so that should tell you something. My friend, husband, aunt and I had the Green Eggs and Ham, Bacon Egg and Cheddar, Pastrami, Irish Nachos, the Turkey Ruben, their lemonade, coke and coffee (Peet's). All were good. The Pastami was greasy, a little too greasy, my husband couldn't finish it. They were out of the cheese sauce for the Irish Nachos and we ordered them anyway with just cheddar cheese, green onions, bacon and sour cream. My aunt was dissapointed because the cheese was just on top. They should have layered it. Nachos are supposed to be ooey-gooey-messy and these weren't...perhaps that's why they're called Irish? Overall a great place to enjoy again and again. Looking forward to going back!

NOMS. Seriously. Wow. The meat on the Bruxie Burger was sooo soft and delicious. A friend of mine went to the new one in Brea and said that the meat was much too salty, so I think I'll stick to the original location. I have no idea what they did to the waffle but it was so soft, crispy, and flaky. It also had this light butter flavor to it. SO. GOOD. The Creme Brulee waffle was just as delicious. I don't even know how to describe it, but definitely order it! I also love that this place has ice cold water on the side. You don't need to ask for water cups, just pick one up yourself. The staff members are so nice. My first time here, they gave me their suggestions, asked for my preferences, and were completely helpful. The line gets kind of long sometimes, but it's really not that bad of a wait. I think the worst part is the parking. This place is also really clean, which surprises me since it's an "outside" kind of restaurant. Add more seats and better parking and it'll earn its 5 stars. I also noticed that there were people complaining about how this place isn't like Roscoe's House of Chicken and Waffles. First of all, Bruxie doesn't advertise chicken and waffles. Their main focus is WAFFLES. Second of all, just because Bruxie and Roscoe's incorporate waffles into their entrees, doesn't mean that they are the same restaurant. Third of all, if you want chicken and waffles so bad, go to Roscoe's and stop complaining that Bruxie's chicken waffle sandwich isn't like the one at Roscoe's because it's clearly an entirely different restaurant. Long story short - 5 stars for food - 3 stars for having to try too hard to find a parking spot that won't cost me a ticket

So a few friends of mine recommended this place awhile back and I recently had a chance to try this place for myself. It is definitely something new and I must say that I will be coming back here if I was ever in the area again. The waffles were very crisp and light, and the prices were relatively reasonable. I tried out their albacore tuna melt, which was a special menu item and I LOVED it. If you're a fan of regular tuna melts in general, then I'd highly recommend this item to you guys. The only real draw back I found in this place was probably the parking, they had very few stalls and most likely you'd have to park on the streets.

I didn't want to review this place until I had tried a handful of their menu items, and now that I have... here we go! Bacon, Egg and Cheddar - This is neither really here nor there. 蔍t's about as good as a bacon/egg/cheddar sandwich can taste. 蔔ot spectacular by any means, but it's not bad either. Buttermilk Fried Chicken and Waffle - This was a close second for me (to the Salmon). 蔜he chicken wasn't dry and everything went pretty well together. 蔍 wouldn't say it's necessary to get the syrup (for $1 extra) for this, but it wouldn't hurt either. Smoked Salmon and Dill Cream Cheese - A very light, but tasty sandwich. 蔍t has just the right amount of salmon, cream cheese and cucumbers. 蔛ome capers might have sealed the deal for me (hint, hint). 蔜he bottom line though is that the waffles are key; they are well-made. Lemon Cream and Berries - A little too tarty for me and not really exciting. Strawberry Cr弇e Brulee (seasonal) - Really good. 蔍'm not a big dessert guy, but I enjoyed this. 蔍t's pretty sweet, but not over-the-top. The Orange soda was excellent. 蔜hey sell sodas that have real cane sugar, so that's probably why they charge $1 for refills, though I think that's still a bit high. 蔅ut the Orange tasted like orange cream and I like orange cream. Their seasonal strawberry shake was quite good, but it's not very thick if that's what you like. �Prices are a bit high considering the food isn't very filling, but they use good quality ingredients and all of the workers are extremely friendly.

This place is AMAZING. I'm so glad I got introduced to this place. 蔍'm always down for waffles, but the Bruxie is beyond your typical waffle. 蔛o light, airy, and crispy, it's hard to get tired of it. So far I've tried the pastrami & green eggs & ham. 蔅oth are delicious, but my favorite is the green eggs & ham, so much that I haven't tried anything on the regular menu yet (I've been sticking with the specials so far). 蔍n terms of dessert waffles, I've had the creme brulee and cheesecake. 蔅oth are a good amount of sweetness w/out being overly sweet (which I hate). 蔜hey also have great waffle fries, which you can add to your sandwich as a combo. Their beverages are great, too. 蔍t's hard to go wrong with any of their choices: sodas, strawberry lemonade, shakes. 蔍 think my favorite so far is either the orange or vanilla soda. 蔍 need to try one of their shakes though, they always look so awesome. Prices are good, running around $5 - $7 per waffle sandwich. 蔍t's definitely easy to order a lot and rack up the bill though. Be sure check this place out if you like waffles & delicious things! 蔍 can't wait to go back again & again.

Oh Bruxie, at last I finally had the chance to try you! We ordered the buttermilk fried chicken & waffle, roasted mushroom & goat cheese, and strawberry creme brulee. We all agreed that we liked the roasted mushroom & goat cheese more than the chicken & waffle sandwich. It was just more rich in flavor! I would definitely recommend it. The waffles are surprisingly very light and crispy but not too much. I always remember waffles being heavy and dense, but this was certainly not the case. Portions are good, but for some people, one is probably not filling enough. Creme brulee would have been better if it was not overburnt but still good. The outdoor patio is nice and all, but it gets slightly cold during the winter even with the fire-heater thingys. :(

Amazing gourmet waffles! �Their waffles are simply amazing. 蔆ooked golden brown, nice and crisp on the outside (though not overly so), and fluffy and moist on the inside. 蔄s for their menu, they have a huge selection of both salty and sweet foods that all revolve around that amazing waffle. �For example, think sandwiches except with the bread replaced by waffles. 蔜hink of the possibilities! 蔍 mean the only way they could make that combo is more amazing is by adding bacon...but wait...they do that in their Bacon, Egg, and Cheddar sandwich! �OMGs o upset at myself for getting too full and not being able to eat the waffle there on the spot....but that still ended up being a good thing as thirty minutes later at Stricklands Ice Cream, the Bruxie waffle and good ol'fashioned vanilla ice cream created an AMAZING dessert! �Next time I will be back to try out some of their main course waffles (and write a better review)!

GOURMET WAFFLE SANDWICH -- need I say more? This place (the one in Orange) is a wonderful quaint little shop located on the corner right by Chapam College. Their waffles are always perfectly cooked and they don't skimp on the fillings. 蔜he wait can get ridiculously long but it's definitely worth the wait--the staff is pretty quick in filling the orders as well. One downside to this place is that parking can be very tough. It's a very busy area especially with the college being on the same street but you can generally find parking on the street. I've tried: Buttermilk Fried Chicken & Waffle $6.95 - Hello delicious! I mean, c'mon...the name says it all. The chicken was really tender and matched perfectly with the waffles. Smoked Salmon & Dill Cream Cheese $7.95 - I am a big fan of smoked salmon and cream cheese bagels so the moment I saw this on the menu I knew I had to try it. It was a great combination--light and fluffy Roasted Mushroom & Goat Cheese $7.95 - I know that some people aren't a big fan of goat cheese since it can be a bit strong on the palate but when combined with the roasted mushrooms, it is a wonderful, savory treat! Cheesy Bruxie $4.95 - CHEESE! Need I say more? Cheese lovers will not be disappointed by this delicious cheese and waffle combination. This is one of the waffles I order most often Seasonal Cr巑e Brul巈 $6.50 - Just a simple cr巑e brul巈 but a tasty way to end a great meal Lemon Cream & Berries $6.50 - I enjoyed this a lot but one of my friends who also tried this didn't enjoy it as much. It can be a bit tart because of the lemon cream but Im a huge fan of tart so this number was good for me. Just a fair warning for those who aren't a big lemon fans. S'Mores $5.95 - Yummy! Who doesn't love s'mores? Bruxie's also has smoothies, shakes, and other frozen treats. The smoothies were good but nothing on the spectacular side in my opinion. This place is a must if you're in the area -- trust me when I say that you wont be disappointed

My husband and I came on Saturday night. I was afraid that there would be a crazy long line, but to my surprise there was no line whatsoever. When a line did form, it was only 2 or 3 people deep. We had a savory sandwich and sweet sandwich. I ordered the mushroom and goat cheese and he had the burger. I liked my mushroom, but the balsamic dressing was a little much. It soaked through the waffle :/ . The husband like his burger, although he wish he had more avocado. For dessert we ordered the Nutella & banana and the seasonal special (strawberry cheesecake). The strawberry cheesecake was delicious. The "cheesecake" was deconstructed, with the graham cracker, cream cheese and strawberry layered in between the waffles, instead of a slice of strawberry cheesecake stuffed between two waffles. The Nutella & banana was good but there was very little banana to speak of. Mostly just globs of Nutella. All in all a pretty good experience.

BRUXIE'S!! Finally, after having Bruxie's bookmarked for over a year we made our way there. I'm excited that Bruxie's will be opening a second one in Downtown Brea come Nov 8th. ;) --- We came armed with friends so we could sample more items. Here's the order, sorted by favorites first: 1) Prosciutto & Gruyere : Wow, so delicious & unique. It was so good I went back for a second order (and had to wait in line again, meh --10/15 min). 2) Buttermilk Fried Chicken: mm... we loved the chili honey .. no need to get the extra $1.00 syrup 3) Carolina BBQ Pulled Pork *special of the day: It tastes much better with the sauce, so don't miss out on that... otherwise, it tastes like any other pulled pork sandwich 4) Creme Brulee: Pretty good but didn't really taste too much like creme brulee in my opinion. 5) Lemon Cream & Berries : They weren't kidding about intense lemon curd flavor... it was a little too much for my liking. I think having just ONE sweet waffle is enough...savory ones seemed to work much better. Waffles come thin (not like the huge belgian waffles you get a diners) -- and are easy to eat.. very easy to eat more than 1 to get full. Getting a seat is hard ... people stalk any openings. We were lucky to fit 4 people into two seater tables. We DID notice that crowds died down around 3pm...so I guess that's the time to go (we were there at 2pm on a Sunday). We also picked up a grape soda .. but it wasn't memorable. It looked like how it should taste (artificial grape gum flavor) I love love waffles ... it's one of the main reasons I went to UCLA... I took one bite of their Belgian waffles at orientation and thought to myself, "OMG, I could have this everyday??? Where do I sign???!" �) The end.

YUM. I hate getting my hopes up and being disappointed, so I tried to keep them low for Bruxie. This worked out great, as Bruxie happily met my expectations for a good chicken and waffle sandwich. The waffle was light and crispy (even a little gooey in the center) and the chicken super tasty. My only qualm is that I would have preferred a more savory mix of flavors, since there is a very distinct sweetness in the sandwich -- we drowned this sweet note out with hot sauce, which we agreed was a condiment crucial to the experience. One other point that might need to be made.. My sister, who may possibly have the most robust/healthy system ever, had intense heartburn after this. She dares not return to Bruxie -- but I will be back.

Tried this last week and thoroughly enjoyed the portabella/goat cheese waffle sandwich. 蔍 would like to go back and try one of the dessert waffles in the future too. 蔒y friends liked their fried chicken and short rib waffle sandwiches too - substantial portions and great flavor. The only con is the seating - all of it is outdoors and if you can't get a small table by the cafe itself, you are sitting at 蕋ables on the side of parking lot and we happened to go on a SUPER windy day, so things were blowing off our table constantly. 蔜hey put down wind guards around the tables by the cafe, but you're out of luck if you're sitting further away. 蔛ince there aren't many tables, you need to get there well before noon to grab one (otherwise call it in and pick it up at their to-go window). 蔜here is another location off Birch Street in Brea where there is indoor seating and covered patio seating.

This place is a rip off. I get it, waffles and chicken. That was the only good one -- but the dessert ones are just not worth the almost $7. I can't believe I paid that much for a folded waffles with nutella and marshmallow in it. It should be cheaper or at least come with fruit or something. I could have made it at home, not that great. I'd rather go to Roscoe's.

No line at 9:15 am on weekday morning =) (i think they open at 9). Not sure if it's worth it for more than a 15 min line wait though. It's located in a cute part of Orange, caddy corner to Chapman University. Buttermilk chicken + waffle. The chicken is moist, probably brined and malleted down to a thin piece of breast that is awesomely deep fried and juicy. The 100% maple syrup is another dollar for a little salsa size cup, which I guess you could do without since the slaw inside is semi sweet, but I prefer it. Lemon cream + berries is definitely better than the seasonal (strawberry) creme brulee. There's seriously something magical about lemon curd/cream and raspberries.

2000+ reviews??! I guess I'm the only person in Southern California who hasn't been here already. At least I can pat myself on the bat because I wasn't led here by yelp. I just happened to pass by here on the way home from work and saw the big line and made a note to try this place. Lucky for me it was a slow day because there was no line at all, the only time I have ever seen no line here, maybe because I got off of work at an odd hour. Anyways onto the food. Chicken inside of a waffle doesn't seem all that exciting, but combination worked out surprisingly well. The honey chili sauce that comes with it really makes the whole thing work. I have to say though, $7 for a sandwich that didn't come close to filling me up isn't a particularly good value. That being said, I'll definitely be back again as there's so much on the menu that looks really good.

I've been going to this place since it's opened and tried almost all of their sandwiches. I'm never disappointed! Some of my favorites are the cheddar bacon, balsamic mushroom, and the pastrami sandwich. Another must-have would be their strawberry creme br瀕巈! It has become one of my all time favorite desserts..ever. The only sandwich I didn't enjoy as much was the chicken and waffle. The chicken they use is so large that it's a bit difficult to eat as a sandwich. Other than that, EVERYTHING is great! Another plus is their incredible customer service. They've earned themselves a very loyal customer!

Oh man! Why do you have to be so far from me!? :( Bruxie, you are so good and tasty! My friends and I decided to try Bruxie one Wednesday and it was so delicious! Bruxie is located in Old Town Orange and it was so nicely decorated for the holidays. Bruxie is located on the corner so it was pretty easy to find. Thankfully that night it wasn't busy and parking wasn't bad. Seating was great too! We were able to get a two tables for all of us to sit. 蔜he atmosphere is nice and even pretty romantic too. The servers were friendly and very helpful. Even in the freakin' cold weather Bruxie was warmed with huge fire heater things. Thankful there was many of us so all of us ordered different things and nibbled on each others foods! WHAT YOU MUST TRY: - Smoked Salmon & Dill Cream Cheese - OH MY GOSH! Nicely smoked and so fresh tasting with the cucumbers and cream cheese! - Prosciutto & Gruyere - So yummy and wasn't so salty as I thought it would be. - Nutella & Bananas - Strawberry shortcake - Bruxie Sundae - Rootbeer - made with real sugar cane - YUM! - Waffle Fries -- FROZEN CUSTARD & Waffle cone!!!! -- ohh man! I've been to Wisconsin where they are famous for the Frozen Custard and this was so close to the real thing! It was so good! :) Yeah there's a hype, and yes I'll even hype it up for you too! But hey! Its good. You should at least try it once..

Approaching this place, it was outdoor seating, long lines, but service was quick and someone passing out the menus helped speed the line up, so you would know exactly what you want to order when you get to the front. We all stuck to the buttermilk fried chicken and waffles. 5 orders came out and they called us by name and bringing it to our table. Sandwich was considered too small to share, but too big for me to finish alone. Waffle was super light and crispy. We added chulula for a kick! Tip: Either get a table before you order or have someone wait for a table while someone else orders. Star off for prices and no bathrooms (which was a huge issue for us people coming from a long car ride from San Francisco).

Yes the lines are long, sometimes there's no where to sit, and can't find parking but I still give them 5 stars because of the quality of food and friendly service. I always have the fried chicken and waffle sandwich with syrup on the side. You really can't go wrong there. The waffle fries aren't anything spectacular.. if you like waffle fries than you'll like them but IMO just tasted like the same ones at Chik-fil-A. But like I said, I go there for the fried chicken. :)

What better place to have a quick brunch in sunny California than Bruxie? The service is outstanding and seating is outside. You can enjoy the beautiful weather or bring your four legged friends. They have workers that bring out your food and check on you. There was an employee asking if people wanted treats for their pets, such friendly people. Bruxie is an experience no to miss. The green eggs and ham waffle sandwich has got to be my favorite. Pesto lovers need to try this. It's an egg and ham sandwich with cheddar cheese and pesto sauce. I crave for this wafflewich all the time. It's not on the menu so you just have to ask. I have also tried the strawberry creme br瀕巈 waffle sandwich, it was good but too sweet. I could only eat half of it. The waffle fries are ridiculously greasy and aren't that special. It's cooked in peanut oil so be careful if you're allergic. There's a pineapple hot sauce on the condiment counter that goes great with the fries. I come here every time I visit So. Cal.

The short of it: - amazing waffle sandwiches! - lines can be long esp. lunch time and weekends - outdoor seating only, street parking only (hard to find) - Favs: prosciutto and Gruyere, smoked salmon and dill cream cheese strawberry cheesecake waffle The long of it: I have been here twice and I love it each time! There's no other place like it and the waffles are amazing here. So light and fluffy! The sandwich combinations are unique and delicious! I'm determined to come back all the time and try all the waffle sandwiches. They also have daily waffle sandwich specials that change daily. I've heard they've had a braised short 蕆ib waffle sandwich on occasion (I'm crossing my fingers they will have this the next time I go). Bruxie is a stand alone, walk-up to the window kind of place. No indoor seating, only outdoor, but they do have heaters for the cold nights. I wish this place was open later because it would be perfect for late night food runs.

I've been wanting to try this place for a looong time, particularly because I'm a big fan of waffles and savory flavors! I was really surprised to find out this place is pretty much a shack stand of some sorts, with suuuuper limited parking nearby. The seating is definitely small and extremely informal - mostly benches and some high bar tables. Nonetheless, I think the laid-back atmosphere is kind of cool...it's nice to find an unpretentious place in the OC. The food is definitely pretty good. My boyfriend ordered the classic buttermilk chicken and waffle with maple syrup, while I opted for a simple spin on a breakfast classic - applewood smoked bacon, tillamook cheddar, and egg on a waffle. Our meals felt pretty light, which surprised me, considering I assumed that maple syrup and waffles PLUS some other foods would be a bit overwhelming. But their waffles are made fairly thin, with just the right amount of crisp and fluffiness, which I definitely appreciate! We also split a fresh chocolate milkshake, which was VERY strong and overwhelmingly sweet. I definitely would NOT recommend this for breakfast or even a brunch. As a result of the milkshake, we both felt pretty sick afterward...but other than that small mishap, I think it's safe to say that we'll be back! I also heard they just opened up a location in Brea, so yipee! Time for a waffle party!

Who knew waffles could make such amazing sandwiches!? This place definitely deserves 4 stars for taste, presentation, originality, and affordability. One day we decided to come here so we hopped in the car, made the 20 min drive from LB to Orange, ordered half the menu, killed it, and left the place in less than 30 minutes tops. Good thing I have a huge family so we each picked something from the menu so we each could try different sandwiches. Here is my list of favorites from top to bottom: 1 - turkey rueben (holiday seasonal) - my favorite !!! 2 - burger 3 - pastrami (holiday seasonal) 4 - proscuitto 5 - salmon and cucumber 6 - chicken (this was my least favorite because there was a weird after 蕋aste - like they fried chicken and fish together?) - we had three of these sandwiches and they all tasted the same so I wouldn't order this sandwich here. No one in my family liked the chicken sandwich. If you want chicken and waffles, better to get it a elsewhere.

The question is... why didn't I think of this restaurant concept myself? �The food quality is first rate. 蔜he waffles are crispy (when fresh, to go it might not hold up too well unless you get something unsaucy or oily) and are perfect as a sandwich. The Buttermilk Chicken was good but for the price I thought it could've used more chicken. 蔜here were two small pieces with coleslaw inside, not one large breaded breast. 蔍f you're hungry and hoping the chicken will fill you up, it won't. �Prosciutto and Gruyere was very good. 蔔ext time I go I'd really like to try the Prosciutto and Fig. �They have date shakes! 蔕h, so good. 蔉reshly made, thick and creamy with huge chunks of dates. �There is always a fair sized lunch line, whether it be on weekdays or the weekend. 蔍t's a mix of working people and college students. 蔜he line moves fast. 蔛eating is all outside and there are also some standing tables. �While one waffle foldover sandwich or dessert itself is not pricey, add in criss cut fries and a soda or shake and you're looking at $12-15, which is not exactly cheap for a quick lunch. �That said, I'll still be back, because the stuff is frickin' good!

I absolutely love this place! Yes, there is always a wait, but it's worth it for me. I love to go here for breakfast or brunch. I haven't tried much, but their waffle sandwiches are amazing! May sound strange, but it tastes out of this world. Being the bacon lover that I am, I had to try the Bacon, Egg & Cheddar with Tillamook Cheddar, Mayo and Applewood Smoked Bacon. You can add Maplewood Syrup for only $1.00 more. Hands down, so amazingly good! it just all melts in your mouth. Have to try it! I always pair it with a strawberry shake, which is always made with the freshest of strawberries. I still have to try all the other great things Bruxie has to offer. I've also heard Bruxie is coming to Brea!

Waffles! Waffles !Waffles! I went here for the second time finally after going here almost a year ago. I came here with my family who was visiting. They are huge fans of Waffle Window in Portland and I wanted to take them here so they can compare the two. We ordered a couple of different items to share such as: -Bruxie Burger: Probably my favorite item here at bruxie...the patty is so good and juicy. -Seasonal bruxie (roasted pork, stuffing, gravy, and cranberry sauce): Very good taste I wanted to make sure i tried this because it was the last day for it. It was pretty good...not spectacular. -Bacon, Egg, and Cheddar: I liked this one a lot! very very good! -Seasonal Creme Brulee: This was surprisingly very good...I am not a huge fan of Creme Brulee but the filling reminded me of the strawberry crossaints from Cream Pan. Very good! The one thing that sets the waffles from Bruxie apart from other waffles is that it is very light and crispy. Although items such as the Bruxie burger or chicken and waffles item sounds heavy...the light waffle offsets the heaviness of it. This time around I think I enjoyed Bruxie a bit more. Service is always very friendly and efficient. For the cold weather they even have a bunch of heat lamps set up. Can't wait to come back and try more items!

My cousin and I were lured into Bruxie because it was right in Downtown Orange, and we were already planning on browsing fun antique shops and thrift stores that are unique to that place. I have to say that Yelp was pretty dead-on on this review. I ordered their Roasted Mushroom & Goat Cheese Waffle Sandwich, and I inhaled that thing! I usually never finish whole sandwiches, but this was just delicious. It sounds unusual to have waffle as the bread but it just worked. It was something different and everyone should try it just once. Next time I want to try 蕋heir sweeter items, like their banana and chocolate waffle. It was a hot day so I also ordered the fresh squeezed strawberry lemonade, which was decent. I also liked the ambiance. It's an almost-pop-up type restaurant with standing room and seating. They were even nice enough to turn on spritzers for those waiting in line to help beat the heat! Super cool concept. Highly recommended if you're ever near Downtown Orange!

I'd been wanting to try this place for a while and I finally did today! I came for dessert at around 6pm and surprisingly there was no line! I'm very happy because I heard there is always a line. I tried the creme brulee waffle and the Belgian hot chocolate. The waffle was delicious! Light and fluffy, yet crispy and warm. I could order the waffle plain and it would still be delicious. I highly recommend this place for the waffles, but not the hot chocolate. I'll definitely be back to try a savory waffle!

i have NEVER had chicken and waffles before.... even though I've been to Roscos... i've never actually had both together (shocking i know). But when i heard about Bruxie i had to come and try it out. Its a very small stand up shop. Its mainly dine out, but they have seating for you to sit if you like. Its right across from Chapman University in Old town Orange. There's plenty of street parking so no worries there! While in line, my mouth was watering reading their selection of savory and sweet waffle sandwiches. I was debating between the mushroom and sun dried tomato waffle or the chicken and waffle. Since the chicken and waffle seems to be their FAVORITE, i went with that. Honestly, its amazing how crispy their waffle is, even with the chicken inside. Its crunchy and delicious and doesn't get soggy even with the fried chicken inside. The fried chicken is more like a piece of fried chicken steak. Very juicy and not dry at all. They give you a side of cole slaw and maple syrup to add to the sandwich as you please. I put the works in mine. 蔵t was really very scrumptious! i recommend this!!! I also got their strawberry lemonade which had more strawberry than lemonade. Its not tart at ALL. so if you like that kind of lemonade i recommend it. They have a GREAT selection on shakes too but I couldn't fit anything else in my stomach at that point. But i WILL come back and try their shakes. They had pumpkin, date, espresso, caramel, and the other usual shake flavors. They have a lot of seasonal flavors as well. I would honestly come back here to try their other waffles and desserts. the average price of the meal would be about $10-15. Not too bad for how great the food was! recap: 1) chicken and waffle sandwich 2) easy street parking 3) SHAKES!

My friend kept hyping this place up and couldn't believe that I had never come here before. She even claimed this place was better than Roscoe's. Before coming here, I still had my doubts. Roscoe's is pretty damn good and I find it hard to believe there would be better out there. I was initially surprised that it was a food stand, not that it influenced my decision, but you will see the importance of this comment later on. 2nd. I ordered the buttermilk fried chicken and waffle sandwich. The wait for the food was incredibly quick, less than 5 minutes (big surprise considering it's a waffle and fried chicken-though does this mean it's not made to order since so many people order it?-someone can answer me on this). 3rd. Drove home (Less than 10 minutes) and ate. Now here comes the taste test. My waffle was soggy and not light or airy. More resemblance to an eggo heated up in the microwave than freshly made. Definitely nothing compared to the light and air waffles of Roscoes. The flavor was off, weird, not like any other freshly made waffles I ever tasted. I even had to force myself to finish it by drowning it in the honey syrup sauce. The chicken was well seasoned and crisp, slightly juicy, not dry. Now I'll show the importance of the previous comment. After eating the chicken by itself, I realize that this place cannot be compared to Roscoe's. Roscoe's is solely a fried chicken and waffle restaurant. This place is a food stand and has one fried chicken item. And the rest are burgers or waffle infused items. The chicken is a different cut than the wings I usually eat at Roscoe's. This item is meant to be eaten as a sandwich. I usually eat the fried chicken and waffles separately at Roscoe's. Despite saying that, I still think I either got a defective sandwich or this place has gone downhill since they tried to open more locations. If their claim to fame is this sandwich, then it should have good, regardless. Maybe, not better or comparable to Roscoe's, but good in its own right. Might be back to try some of the other recommendations. The menu seemed to cater to my boyfriend's tastes but otherwise I won't be back.

I have been seeing advertisements about this place through my work place and I thought I give it a try given all the great reviews. 蔍t is located in a corner on the north part of Old Town Orange. 蔉inding a parking or seat could be a challenge. 蔍t is like an In-N-Out type of location without the drive through. �Back to the food review, I tried their famous buttermilk fried chicken & waffle and it was great. 蔜he fried chicken like everyone else is talking about is moist and crispy. 蔜he waffle is definitely different, less heavy, crunchy, and it does hold the fried chicken in place. 蔜he syrup makes it tasty, but I think I'll want to add that extra maple syrup next time to make it even better. I also tried their special menu item that they don't always carry, the braised beef short rib, and it was okay. 蔍t does overpower the waffle a bit and little on the dry side for me. 蔖eople are saying the pulled pork is excellent, but it was not offered at the time. 蔍 think I'll come back again another time to see if they have it. 蔜he guy who worked there said the flavor of the braised beef short rib is pretty much like the pulled pork. 蔍 still want to try it myself to see since beef and pork does have different flavors and texture. 蔠ait and see...

Fried chicken was lightly battered and super tasty. 蔠ith the addition of their sweet sauce, this bite instantly became one of my favorite dish of all time. 蔛urprisingly, it wasn't heavy at all! �I will return. 蔍 know you are 6 hours away from my home, but I will return. 蔍 have fallen in love. 蔣ou completed a part of me that I was missing.

Let's not beat around the bush. Bruxie is delicious and a novel idea. It's almost embarrassing that more places haven't thought of waffle sandwiches and monopolized upon it. Hats off to you, Bruxie! I've only sampled the fried chicken and prosciutto/brie waffles and they were both scrumptious. I subtract one star, though, because you really won't get full unless you eat two and that can get a bit pricey indeed. Also, they charge for a side maple syrup, which I think should already be ON the chicken!

I have dreams of the green eggs and ham waffle sandwich! The waffle nachos are amazing as well! The PB&J waffle is good but needs more jelly, a bit too dry. I wish there was more seating. Parking is always a pain in that area and there are limited spots in their lot. The staff is always helpful and will answer any questions you have about the food. Genius idea! Whoever is a hater of this place is a crazy person!

Something new. The moment I heard of a sandwich place that used buttermilk waffles as bread I had to try it out right away. When we got there, it was literally a hole in the wall corner store in the middle of chapman university. The lines wasn't that bad a little long but perfect to figure out what you wanted. So far I've had the Bruxie Burger and Chicken and waffle sandwich. Both are a must have. You wouldn't expect a salty and sweet combination. THE CUSTARD ICE CREAM IS WHAT REALLY GOT ME. I've had frozen custard before but nothing like this. The texture and way it looked like it was melting but still perfectly solid was best way to top off a meal with friends.

Great concept, yummy combination of flavors. The waffles themselves are fresh, light and delicious, so you could pretty much add anything inside and it would taste great. Tried the BBQ pulled pork waffle sandwich and the banana & nutella. The BBQ pork and its sauce was oh so good and the banana and nutella had a bit of yogurt with it that was delightful. The waffle fries were alright. And we got a date shake that was good, but I'd probably pass on that next time especially since it was $5! Goodness. Glad Orange has some good eats now! Notes: 1) The seating is outdoors with an awning. Booths can seat 4 comfortably, and there are a couple picnic tables with high tables with stools in the parking lot. 2) Watch carefully where you park - most of the parking near by is permit only. We got a fat $55 ticket.

I visited Bruxie after seeing an article about novel hamburgers in the L.A. Times (even though it is in the city of Orange behind the Orange curtain). It is very near a place I had a late morning appointment, so I thought it was serendipity. 蔣ou order at the window and your food is delivered to where you are seated. 蔜here is a line and there are a number of people waiting. 蔜he food is prepared fresh to order and is done quickly, despite the number of patrons. Their sodas are made with syrup and soda water and are delicious. I ordered the cheeseburger and fries, though there were many other things that looked great. The waffle fries are amazing. 蔜hey are clearly made with fresh potatoes. 蔜hey're cooked perfectly with just the right amount of salt. 蔜hey are truly perfect. The cheeseburger was also terrific. 蔜he waffle "bun" works surprisingly well and tastes great. 蔜he meat is cooked medium, but is moist and flavorful. 蔜he simple combination of ingredients works well. 蔜his is a great burger. 蔍 can't wait until my next appointment in this area, as I thought this lunch was awesome. 蔍 really look forward to trying another sandiwch. 蔍 don't think you can do this kind of food any better than it is done here. 蔛imply amazing.

I have heard about this place from so many people, and just recently got to finally try it! 蔜he line was pretty hefty around 2 pm but I can't imagine there never being a line! We ordered the pulled pork special and the buttermilk fried chicken. The pulled pork is amazing! 蔖erfect combination of textures and flavors. 蔔ot overly sauced or too smokey BBQ flavor (my ultimate fears when it comes to pulled pork -- I hate it when people mask the natural pork flavor). 蔒eat was insanely tender...it was soooo hard to share this! I wanted it all for myself! The buttermilk fried chicken -- meh. 蔜he flavors didn't meld as well as the pulled pork. 蔍 did, however, love the chili honey....but they seemed a bit stingy with it, as only about half of the chicken was sauced. The chicken piece was soft and juicy (even though it appeared to be breast meat!) but thinner than I expected. Wasn't a big fan of how the slaw tasted in combination with the fried chicken and waffle...maybe because I'm not used to it, but I felt the flavors didn't go too well together. AWESOME they serve Peet's coffee! �And they also have cane sugar sodas! Score! =)

Shoulda went here when it wasn't lent. I gave up meat for lent so it limited me in my selection. I had their strawberry milkshake and nutella with bananas bruxie. So delicious! The milkshake was so thick and creamy. It was also made with fresh strawberries which i love! The waffle so toasted on the outside, but soft on the inside. I was craving something sweet so this satisfied my craving. The cream sauce they added with it..i want to say it was like a sweet cream cheese or a sweet creme fraiche? At first I was skeptical about how that would pair with the nutella. I love nutella and messing that taste would be disastrous, but it complemented the nutella and bananas very well. I was very surprised. I am definitely coming back to try the fried chicken bruxie. Everyone was eating it and I was jealous. haha. My brother got to order it. He loved the chili maple syrup that goes with it. It's like chicken and waffles but smashed together in sandwich form. We came around late noonish/1pm - there was a line wrapping around the building. If you want to beat the crowd, try to come during non-peak hours - although the line was long, the wait wasn't too bad, but seating on the other hand is another story. Trying to snatch a table was a battle with the rest of the others waiting for a table. They offer a decent amount of tables considering their shop is a stand that you have to walk up to a window and order...but if you want to solidify a place to sit, have one person order, and another person search for a table/save a table or you could be standing for awhile

This place has awesome waffles! My coworkers and I come here sometimes and we would all get a creme brulee waffle to split. It's just so heavenly and indulgent that I think it should be shared. For the savory stuff, I like the pastrami the best. I heard that the breakfast menu has a good selection as well. I have yet to try it one of these days.

We ventured here on a weekday during the late afternoon. Parking was not a problem for us and there were no lines. Sweetness! As a newb, I had really high expectations for this 4-star eatery. + Buttermilk Fried Chicken & Waffle - I opted to add the extra maple syrup for the additional $1. The chicken was moist and crispy. The waffle was light and held up well. Absolutely delicious. The coleslaw isn't great alone, but the combination of the chicken, coleslaw, waffle, and maple was a winner, winner chicken dinner. Well...more like winner, winner chicken lunch! Remember to get the extra maple syrup though because they kind of skimp on it. - Braised Short Rib - This was a seasonal item so I'm not sure if it's still offered. Although good, the short rib was really heavy and overpowered the waffle. - Old Fashioned 'Pure Cane Sugar' Orange Soda - It lacks the strong orange flavor that I like. Is it bad to say that I prefer Sunkist over this? + Service - The guys and gals here are very nice, attentive, and informative. They came to ask us how our meal tasted and generously switched out our orange soda for a new one since the one we had was really bland. - Parking - I can understand how parking can be a bit difficult around here especially with Chapman University across the street and other businesses around. - Seating - Seating is very limited if you're going during the rush, but we didn't have that issue. There's approximately 8-10 bench tables. I would return to try their Prosciutto & Gruyere and the Roasted Mushroom & Goat Cheese. Both of those sound too good to pass up.

The bruxie burger is literally the best burger i've ever had...well, in the OC :) Seriously though, it tastes soooo good. I was expecting it to be all sweet and weird, but the burger was very good quality meat (i'm a little iffy about burger meat, haha) and the crisp waffle actually added to the meal. LOVED IT! The nutella & bananas waffle is a.ma.ZING! Lastly, the staff is really friendly.

A solid 3. When I pulled up to Bruxie, I had a lot of preconceptions and was so excited to finally be in town to try the infamous waffle sandwiches. But I'm not going to lie-I was a little disappointed with what I found. The greeter standing next to the ordering window walked me and my friends through nearly every option, until I finally decided on the Roasted Mushroom & Goat Cheese with tomatoes. Wayyy too much balsamic vinaigrette and not enough goat cheese. I couldn't really taste anything else. I guess that's what I get for trying to be on the healthy side. However, the waffles were just perfect for the sandwich, they were surprisingly light and fluffy and didn't weigh me down afterwards as I expected. However, I wasn't anticipating the total to come out to $9 for just the sandwich, definitely felt like it should land more around the $6-$7 range. It's also clear that no $$$ is not going towards the furnishings, Bruxie isn't really indoors, so if you come on a rainy day (like I did) don't expect to warm up. The lack of indoors also means you must cross the street to use a public restroom. And there's a teeeeensy parking lot next to the place, otherwise you may have to do a little bit of walking. Overall, the food wasn't amazing, and the set-up of the facility really brought Bruxie down from the 4 stars it's other dishes may have merited. If I'm back in the area, I will for sure come back to try something else of the menu, but to me Bruxie would not be worth a special trip.

This place definitely lives up to all the hype! Be prepared to wait in line though because this place is super popular!! A waffle sandwich...such a great idea!! I ordered the PROSCUITTO AND GRUYERE waffle. This was absolutely delicious. The mustard spread complimented the proscuitto and gruyere cheese perfectly. The waffle was crispy on the outside, but still fluffy in the middle. While it looks like not that much food, the portions are quite filling. I tried my friend's GREEN EGGS AND HAM waffle, which is a seasonal special. The pesto, fried egg, ham, and cheese were great with the waffle. Their STRAWBERRY LEMONADE is the real deal, not some artificial stuff. You can taste actual strawberry seeds in the lemonade. Definitely went well with the waffle sandwich. I also tried my friend's PUMPKIN MILKSHAKE. It literally tasted like pumpkin pie all blended together and served in a cup. This is perfect for the autumn!! I will definitely be coming back whenever I'm in the area! I'm somewhat glad I did not end up going to Chapman for law school, or else I would have gotten so fat from eating a lot of my meals here (since Chapman is just right down the street). Parking: Street parking.

I ate at Bruxie for the first time and I was not disappointed. I arrived early Saturday afternoon and after a short wait in line an order-taker wrote down my request. The place is really small( it's incredible how much work they can do in such small quarters) and only outdoor seating is available. My food was delivered within 15 minutes. I tried the roasted mushroom and goat cheese waffle; the waffle had a light texture to it and the mushrooms and cheese were fresh and tasty. 蔜his place is worth the trip and I can't wait to go back and eat another delicious waffle sandwich.

This review has been marinating and waiting to be written... that means that I had to try over 50% of their menu before I could fully write a proper review. 蔅asically everything is amazing and delicious. 蔍 have been here numerous times and I try to get something different every time or share with people so that I can try everything. 蔔othing has disappointed my tastebuds. 蔅ruxie is well-deserving of this 5 star review. 蔍 don't know what else I can say that the thousands haven't said before but I will try. - Buttermilk Fried Chicken and Waffle - Their #1 seller, is moist and not what you would expect. 蔉ried chicken is greasy. 蔜his is not! 蔍t is a lightly battered chicken breast that is not greasy at all. 蔜he batter itself is slightly sweet which is great with the maple syrup drizzled on top. 蔕nce I ordered an extra side of their maple syrup just so that I can dip the chicken into it. - Carolina BBQ Pulled Pork - I think this is my all time favorite. 蔜he pork is so flavorful and juicy. 蔜he crunchy cabbage inside goes well withe the soft meat. 蔜he sauce itself is heavenly. - Bruxie Burger - Their #2 seller. 蔜his one is not as creative in my opinion as some of their other sandwiches but it is still as delicious as a burger in a waffle can get. 蔜he hamburger meat is juicy and the waffle isn't too sweet and won't overpower the burger. - Short Rib - This one is decadent. 蔜he beef short rib meat is so tender and rich you will need to take a nap after this one. �- Hot Pastrami - The pastrami is well marbled and moist. 蔍 really like the cabbage and spicy mustard that go with the pastrami. 蔜he pickles are thinly sliced and provide a nice crunch. - Green Eggs and Ham - Delicious pesto aioli on this one. 蔜he eggs and ham inside this one make it a great breakfast choice. - Lemon Creme and Berries - Very lemony. 蔕nly order if you are ready for sour. 蔜his is delicious but definitely more sour than sweet. - Strawberry Cheesecake - My favorite dessert waffle. 蔜he "cheesecake" spread and sliced strawberries with graham crackers is the perfect combination for a dessert. 蔙ich so save some room for this dessert. - Creme Brulee - The caramelized sugar inside of this waffle completes the dessert. 蔛imilar to the Strawberry cheesecake because this too includes strawberry slices. Their shakes and sodas are also one of a kind. 蔜he shakes are super thick and soda flavors yummy. 蔍 liked their Frozen custard too. 蔍magine ice cream but better. Tons to love at Bruxie! 蔜ry their newer location in Downtown Brea! 蔒ore seating.

Bruxie, oh, Bruxie......how I love you since the first bite..... There was a long wait, but not a problem because it was only 10 mins. Service is great and waffles are fantabuloustic.... TO THE MAX!!!! Their waffles are very crispy on the outside, thin, and fluffy at the same time. The best I've ever had so far. The sauce isn't too sweet either, everything is in moderation. Fries doesn't have this oily taste and tasty too. I'll see you soon, Bruxie!!! Very very soon.....!

It's a permanent stand (can it be called a building?) with partially-covered outdoor patio seating and another section of tall table seating nearby with heat lamps. Really random, but delicious. You order at the window, find a seat, and they bring your waffle sandwiches to you after you've barely sat down from getting water in a cup. Three of us ordered 5 waffles: fried chicken, salmon with dill cream cheese, bruxie burger, pulled pork (daily special), and strawberry creme brulee. There wasn't one that we didn't like although the chicken was my favorite. My buddy loved the creme brulee waffle so much that she dissected it in an effort to learn how to recreate it at home. Good luck on that one. We parked near the circle on Chapman and walked there.

This food is AMAZING. FOOD HEAVEN. I have tried every dessert- the nutella and banana one is the best, followed by the S'mores one. Great vegetarian options, and great service. Though there is a long line, the service is fast. One time it lagged, but they compensated by giving us free yogurt. The people who work there are incredibly kind too. The only downside is the parking and the line--but the food makes it all worth it in the end! I would also check out the old town chapman a few blocks down which has many small shops and restaurants that are entertaining!

Although I love the waffle sandwiches from Bruxie, I don't think it deserved the #2 Yelp spot for the entire US for 2011. There are so many better restaurants! Love the fried chicken & smoked salmon. Seating is all outdoors and can be limited during the busy hours.

Holy Moley, holy moley!!! We moved down the street from Bruxie, which is dangerous, about 8 months before they opened when it was the small hut that served diner type food. The owner of Bruxie hit the mother load!!! Salmon and Dill Cream Cheese waffle, the Lemon Cream and berries waffle and my ultimate favorite, The Bruxie Hamburger waffle. My nephew loves their green eggs and ham waffle. We have converted every member of our family to Bruxie and Im starting to wonder if this why their visits to our home have increased....for the food. We have watched this place blossom and thrive since opening day when they did not anticipate the amount of customers and ran out of batter. They have repainted, added tables and chairs and water misters for those waits in line during summer. It's right in front of Chapman University so it is ALWAYS busy so just expect to wait in line but the staffers move you along quickly enough. Fresh water always out when we walk there with our dogs, creative specials and real sugar cane sodas. Go with a group, order several options and divide them up- its very difficult to choose a favorite. This is a place I would expect to see on a travel channel show.

If you like waffles, you'll love Bruxie! Store Front (photo)- http://www.yelp.com/biz_�A big mahalo to Jordan & Montica for a great first time @ Bruxie! After reading the numerous reviews, I had just one thing to say... "It's my turn, DAMN'IT!" 8) The outdoor seating is limited & fortunately for me, it wasn't overly packed. Outdoor Seating (photo) - http://www.yelp.com/biz_�I went with their Signature Buttermilk Fried Chicken & Waffles w/Syrup which was nice & tasty. 蔜he consistency of the waffle had a great texture, not over cooked or too sweet. 蔜he chicken was moist, nicely cooked and when combined with the sweetness of the Maple Syrup, made a great blend of sweet & salty. One waffle sandwich down and only about a dozen more choices to go! 'Not to mention their "Not on the regular menu specials!" Thanks for the info Jordan, I'll keep my eyes open for the "Pulled Pork & Waffle Sandwich," when I'm back in the area. ('Of course, the "Pulled Pork" was sold out by the time I arrived but that just means it's popular & they don't have it sitting in freeze-dried barrels out back.) Freshness is key here! The Waffle Fries were okay, nothing really out of the ordinary, crisscross cut fries... �'A tad too salty for my palate.) 'And going full circle back to the freshness, brings me to their AMAZING seasonal shake... - The "Chocolate Covered Banana Shake." WTH! 蔛imply, amazingly delicious. 蔍'm a big fan of anything with a mix of chocolate, banana, and/or peanut butter... �Add any two of the three and you have a winner! �Add all three, pure bliss!! 蔜o describe their shakes as thick would not even begin to paint this picture... 蔜here are bowls of hearty, firefighter chili looking at this thing going, "Damn! You thick!" 蔜here is definitely junk in this trunk!! ('And a bit more to mine as well after this.) I asked Montica about their "Chocolate Covered Banana Shake." 蔛he told me that Bruxie uses ripened bananas, no artificial syrups. �And their chocolate syrup is made in house as well with Belgian Chocolate. (sigh) Damn, that was a Great shake! (Yes, that is an uppercase G, that is not a typo.) The overall vibe here is laid back, local-kine casual. 蔔o one cares if you are wearing "slippahs" or Birkenstocks, drive a South OC "Soccer Mom" SUV or Schwinn... �My kind of place. 8) 'And lastly, the customer service was spot on! 蔞ery down to earth, helpful, informative, and friendly. 蔍 have to say that this is the closer for me... 蔍 don't care how great the food is at an establishment: junk customer service = junk overall experience = junk business Buttermilk Fried Chicken & Waffles w/Maple Syrup($7.87): 4 Stars Waffle Fries/Combo($$2.25): 3 Stars Chocolate Covered Banana Shake($4.95): 5 Stars Total w/tax: $16.24 The Spread (photo) - http://www.yelp.com/biz_�Unfortunately, Bruxie is not just down the street from me... �In fact it's in the Old Town Orange area but it is a trip I will definitely be making again!

What I appreciate most about this place is the lightness of the waffle. 蔍'd come back just to get the waffle itself with a side of maple syrup and call it i a meal. 蔊ot the following items and shared them among friends: 1. Butter Milk Fried Chicken and Waffle - I recommend ordering the extra side of maple syrup for $1. 2. Pulled Pork Waffle - This is one of their specials. 蔠e were told that they normaly sell out of the item by 3pm. 蔔ormally I'm not much of a pulled pork person but with the tenderness of the pork made it a hit. �3. Soft Served Frozen Custard - Smooth and not too sweet. 蔍f you have room in your stomach, do give it a try!

Mm mm mmm. Bruxie is amazing. Its located in old town orange right next to chapman university. I heard about this place the week it was opening but never had the chance to try it till a few weeks ago. Went here with a few old friends to have brunch. The staff was friendly and the food was delicious. I ordered the classic buttermilk fried chicken waffle. My friends got the salmon with dill waffle, the arugula with roasted mushroom and the Bruxie burger. We all enjoyed it very much. Would love to come back and try the banana with nutella. Woo hoo.

Love Bruxie and their outrageously unique waffle sandwiches! Heard about it through a friend when I was in so cal during spring break so I made it a priority to stop by before I left and I'm glad I did. This place is in a cute college town setting with lots of people during the weekend. The line at Bruxie was long, but well worth the wait. I believe the owner/manager was also at the front of the line to give his recommendations and the break-down for us "newbies" to the place. The bf and I ordered the salmon cream cheese w/cucumber waffle sandwich and the classic chicken and waffle sandwich with a side of yummy waffle fries. I wanted to taste their irish nachos, but apparently Bruxie doesn't have it daily. Boo! Other than that, I really enjoyed the food, atmosphere, and the prices aren't too shabby!

Warning -- the seasonal creme br瀕巈 with fresh strawberries can cause your mouth to instantaneously orgasm uncontrollably. I've never had a waffle sandwich before. Yes, I am a poor, deprived man. What an amazing introduction into waffle sandwiches! The creme br瀕巈 was absolutely delicious! Sweet, creamy - with the combination of crisp and bread-y waffles on top and under it - oh my. It is a small shop on a corner of two streets. What they're doing here is amazing. I envy the Chapman University students who are only a walking distance from this place. Seating is limited, of course. There are a few chairs and tables mounted to the ground, but mostly this place is a stand-and-eat type of a place. You order at the order window and your order is ready when your name is called. Around the building is a small counter where you can stand and put your food on. I tell you - on a chilly evening, a strawberry creme br瀕巈 and a chocolate shake was absolutely amazing. Go. Go for dessert tonight. You'll LOVE it. :0)

When I first heard of Chicken and waffles I was thinking "really"? So I had Roscoe's but Bruxie is even more bizarre. Located in a quaint neighborhood is an outdoor diner. you will have to find parking on the streets (don't worry it's not LA). I ordered the basic buttermilk fried waffles with chicken. What I got was pretty much a waffle sandwich with a fried chicken patty with coleslaw. Slap on some honey and you're ready to go. I also ordered a side of the bacon cheese waffle fries (or criss cross fries). I think everything cost me about $15. So it's not the cheapest meal out there. Overall, its a unique take on waffles and chicken. A definite recommendation!

Sorry yelpers, I have to break this 1500+ reviews of awesomeness for this place. I just don't get why everyone is so hype out about this so called Roscoe. First, the menu was interesting and creative, the seating was outside so we all got that sunny go-green atmosphere, there were runners calling out your name instead of waiters; however the first bite just literally killed it. -Tried the $7 buttermilk special. two small breaded chicken, sprinkled with coleslaw, smothered with sweet&sour sauce, with waffles. [good texture, but I got a tummy ache afterward] -Strawberry vanilla shake for $5, the shake itself was around 14oz and the rest whipped cream and a lot of strawberry syrup.[Too freaken sweet] I like the atmosphere but these sandwiches were like appetizers and plus I really didn't like their seats. They were filled with germs, so if your wearing leggings or shorts, be prepare to be itchy. Well, that's just me I guess. So bye, Bruxie, I'm going to stick to my simple chicken and waffles at Roscoe. (:

Yah Bruxie is the real deal. Yes I may live a measly two minute walk away from Bruxie, but tonight was my first night actually eating there. Ordered: Pumpkin Milkshake- Basically liquid pumpkin pie. Super thick, super delicious and was even better when poured all over my waffles! Liege Waffle- Typical Brussels waffle with powdered sugar and nutella. Waffle was light, crispy, and delicious, but I wish they were a little warmer. Creme Brulee Waffle- Strawberries, caramelized sugar and custard squeezed in between a waffle. Really delicious and a great medley of flavors. Overall I was happy with Bruxie. I still need to come back and try their savory waffle sandwiches because the fried chicken and also the pastrami sound real good. Will definitely be back.

Came here with a huge appetite after a long shopping day in Downtown LA. Three of my friends and myself looked at the menu and started salivating just by reading all the yummy selections they had to choose from. From the looks of the line, my friends and I thought we'd be waiting long for our food. But by the time the last person in our party ordered, two of our orders were already up. Can you say, quick service? I ordered the fried chicken waffle sandwich. It did not disappoint. The light batter the chicken was encrusted with was perfect. Not heavy at all. The waffle was light and fluffy. Inside a nice cold cole slaw with a spicy honey dressing accompanied the chicken. It was a nice combo. It was an exceptional meal to tame my hunger. To top off the meal, I washed it all down with a mint chocolate shake. It was awesome! Will be returning to Bruxie again on my next trip down to SoCal.

Delish! My sister and I came here and ordered the fried chicken waffle and the Carolina pulled pork bbq sandwich. We shared an iced tea. The fried chicken sandwich was awesome. Delicately fried and not greasy. It was perfectly accompanied with a chopped cole slaw on a crisp but soft waffle. So delicious. The Carolina pulled pork sandwich was delicious as well. Generous portion of meat, but not enough cole slaw. I wish the bbq sauce was a little less tangy and little more sweet. But overall, the meat was tender and overall the sandwich was good. I love the outdoor seating and the quaintness of this place. Can't wait to return!

Something is inside of my Waffle! Great idea to make Waffle Sandwiches. The food is EXCELLENT. Service is EXCELLENT. Seating is hard to find. Not because they dont have enough seats but there are so many ppl! and the line is ridiculous but if you wait about 5 mins there will be a seat for you because how long can it take to eat a waffle sandwich. Little bit pricey when you begin to order drinks (Unique flavors of smoothie, GREAT lemonade). About $7 for a waffle sandwich and 4~5 dollars for your drink if you order smoothies. 4 Stars because of the price. But I will visit again when I have the time to drive over here.

Gotta say that I was a bit grossed out by the smoked salmon waffle thing. It just didn't seem to pair well. The smores one was incredibly 蕇weet. Maybe a bit too much. But it is smores on a sweet waffle..so... I doubt I'd go back and spend the money here, but if you are in the area it's worth a try if you are craving something sweet and different.

Wanted to see what the hype was all about. It definitely lived up to my expectations. I ordered the chicken waffle sandwich with the chili honey on the side and ordered the side of the maple syrup. When I got my order, they had put everything on the side including the cole slaw. However this was perfect, because I found that I enjoyed the sandwich with the syrup alone. Didn't really care for the chili honey. The belgian chocolate shake has crack in it. I am convinced. It was very tasty. Didn't get a chance to sample the Irish Nachos, because they said they were out. Overall, I would definitely return.

I love waffles! I ordered two waffle sammiches: fried chicken and strawberry cheesecake and both did not disappoint. The Fried chicken one consisted of a warm fluffy waffle on both sides of a tender fried chicken steak. It had cole slaw and chili honey. Very delicious, flavorful, and tender! The Strawberry cheesecake had the same waffle sandwiching strawberries, cream cheese, graham cracker, and something else that I can't remember. But It really tasted kind of like strawberry cheesecake! Tasty! The place itself had a long line and must have been very convenient for Chapman University students as it's just across the street from some of the buildings. It's a small place with few places to sit but definitely worth all the inconvenience!

Went with the boyfriend on a random day. So...he's a super manly man, he likes beef. eating hot dogs in his car was our first date. Eating a burger at denny's was his idea of dish lish. So when I recommended gourmet waffles to him, he could have sworn that I was questioning his identity. Anyways. When we got there, I ordered this waffle with mushroom and spinach (forgot what it was called). It had balsamic vinegar and goat cheese, and oh myyyy it was sooo gooood!!! The mushrooms are not cut in weenie slices, they were giant whomping mushroom halves swimming in saucy saucy goodness! I looooove saucy foods, love it! The goat cheese was delicious!! ALL these flavors, SO many textures! Each bite was a layer after layer experience! yummyyy. The aftertaste was...amazing too HAHA. (like yknow how you'll drink coffee but get that sour aftertaste? bleck. Here? STILL GOOD! meal #2?) The waffle was STILL crunchy even though the sauce was soaking through the pores. MM. MM. The manfriend loved it too. :] He ordered....*drum roll* 蕋he....BRUXIE BURGER! And he loved it. Well...he said it was "so money", egyptian jargon for "so 'mazing" :]. Coming back.

I'd give Bruxie one star for the creative idea, another star for the cool ambiance and location, and a third star for the fun and fast staff. But why not two more? Well, let's start with the positives. Bruxie serves its sandwiches on waffles. These waffles have a very mild sweet taste, so you don't actually feel like you're having some weird breakfast-lunch combo that really isn't brunch. I had the turkey club sandwich with extra avocado, and it wasn't bad at all! My coworkers also seemed to enjoy their orders as well. Also, this place is in downtown Orange, so there's lots of pedestrian activity and young college kids waling around. Finally, the staff here are very fun, fast, and engaging, offering advice and great smiles. But, onto the downsides. Bruxie is expensive! If you order a sandwich for lunch, plus fries and a drink, you're definitely looking at something on the order of more than $10 to $12. Considering other sandwich-fries-drink combos can be found for $5-10, this is a bit steep if you visit every day. Moreover, this place gets packed, and while the staff work quickly, people eat slowly and socialize for a long time, so be prepared for a long lunch. Finally, because it's a historic structure, there's no public restroom! Plan ahead. Overall, Bruxie is worth a visit and I would come back to try other sandwiches or even sweet waffles, but for now I'm open to trying other restaurants in the area.

Been here many times and once to the Brea location. They make magnificent waffles and their frozen custard isn't to be missed!!! I prefer their sweets to their savory menu items any day. Beware of the salty sodium levels of their savory waffles, its too much. I've trieal retry much all of the sweet waffles they offer and can tell you which one trumps them all. *drumroll please* Hands down the best thing on the menu is their seasonal / strawberry creme brulee. Also, I can't say enough good things about the frozen custard. The soft serve is creamy and just the perfect amount of sweet. Those two are must haves!! Bruxie has good and friendly service and the lines go by fairly quickly. I also like it that they use environmentally friendly utensils.

DO NOT, and I REPEAT, DO NOT GET BRUXIE TO-GO! Get there before 10am on a weekend to avoid a long line / wait. 蔜he servers seem to be all college-aged but were really friendly and service was absolutely wonderful considering that there's only outdoor seating. 蔣ou order at the window and if you're lucky, there will be seating available. Don't get this to-go, since the waffle will get soggy with all of the sauces / grease / etc and ruin the overall experience of your bruxie.

Came here for my graduation dinner, yeahhhh like a boss :P Things that our group ordered: �Bacon, Egg & Cheddar - Nicole L. ordered this. It was Very simple BUT sometimes simplicity is quite delicious (in this case, indeed!) but definitely a little oily Proscuitto & Gruyere - I ordered this one and I loved it. You seriously can't go wrong with Proscuitto. Smoked Salmon - This is good but ...I personally can't eat too much salmon without feeling gross. So, if you really like salmon, maybe this is for you. Roasted Mushroom & Goat Cheese (had a basil and balsamic reduction) - I liked it but goat cheese is a little...goat cheesy haha Of course we ordered a side of waffle fries, which were DELISH. But I'm not picky about my deep fried carbs. The service was great, although it was more of a fast food model. There were "servers" walking around and asking to clear things/asking us how our food was. I have yet to try a sweet waffle but they looked really good!

Bruxie has been on my radar for a year and finally, my bf took me to try it before we hung out at Disneyland, which was about 10 minutes away. Brilliant idea and concept, easy to eat and really delicious, makes my heart melt when I finish my sandwich because I just want to eat another one. I've tried the buttermilk fried chicken & waffle ($6.95), smoked salmon & dill cream cheese ($7.95), lemon cream & berries ($6.50), and the creme brulee ($6.50). All were really delicious! I LOVE the fried chicken waffle. I love fried chicken, and the way they serve it to you, with the drizzle of chili honey and cole slaw on top, made it sooo much better. The first few bites of the smoked salmon waffle is thrilling to the taste buds, but after a while, it starts to become boring.. but dipping it in sriracha made everything better. :) It's so good! (typing this review is making my mouth water). I HIGHLY recommend giving the lemon cream and berries a try because it's to-die-for. I love the taste of a strong and sweet lemon flavor in desserts, so it's a must to have this dessert waffle. The fresh berries inside, strawberries, blueberries, and blackberries, made it more spectacular! BUT the downside is that there isn't a lot of fruit, but a very small handful of each kind. :(

Bruxies savory and sweet waffles are simply divine and unique. For lunch I usually get the chicken and waffle sandwich because its not too sweet for my taste and the chicken is fried to perfection. For dessert I usually get the creme bruelee waffle.

The food is worth it but, I don't always go here because of crappy customer service and I had a bad experience with the owner one time. As for the food, my personal favorites on the savory side is the hamburger and the Buttermilk Fried Chicken and Waffle. The employees tend to be pretty bi polar, sometimes they are overly nice and very friendly. While other times I've encountered them whispering and snickering at my friend and I like they are immature college kids (which is a likely possibility.) One incident I had here my friend and I were waiting for our food and smoking a cigarette on the PUBLIC sidewalk. He asked paying customers to walk away from the property where I had just spent over $25 on two Bruxies. If you can deal with the random, sometimes fantastic and sometimes bad customer service then I would highly suggest getting it, maybe to go......

I'm a sucker for chicken and waffles and as soon as I found out there was a Buttermilk Fried Chicken and Belgian Waffle sandwich, I knew I had to make room in my schedule for it. Driving there with only minutes to spare before they closed for the night, my gf and I shared the Buttermilk Fried Chicken & Waffle sandwich ($6.95). It was ready only minutes later and we sat down at one of their tables to enjoy this miraculous creation. I also added the 100% Maple Syrup for an $1 because it wouldn't be complete without slathering syrup on your sandwich. Crisp, pillowy waffle. Sweet, luscious syrup. Golden, scrumptious fried chicken. The mild heat of the chili oil. The crunch of the cool, refreshing slaw. IT. ALL. WORKED. I was truly impressed by all the textures and flavors. I wish I lived in Orange just for that sandwich. It had me contemplating attending college again and enrolling in Chapman University just to have the opportunity to eat at Bruxie everyday. Then I remembered all those late nights studying and stressing over exams and came to my senses. But Bruxie, I will be back the next time I'm in LA. You can count on that.

Consider yourself blessed if you are a Chapman student, Bruxie is literally a 5-minutes walk from campus. As for me, I have to drive around the block for a lil bit to find a parking spot that won't cost me a ticket. Since the wait line could get pretty long during dinner time, do come before or after "rush hour". I noticed that Bruxie has been progressively adding seating/dining area since they first opened this location. Staff has always been extremely friendly, helpful, knowledgeable, and hardworking. The only con is they don't have restroom for customers, which is not too catastrophic for me. Now unto the food, I have tried most of them and my faves are Wild Mushroom & Goat Cheese with Arugula drizzled with balsamic vinaigrette (keeping myself from salivating) and Creme Brulee. I can't wait for the second location to open in early November in Downtown Brea!

My mom absolutely loveed her smoked salmon one! But we asked for it to be fully cooked bc she likes it liked that. Waffle was crispy and yums! Ordered the famous buttermilk chicken too. Chicken was cooked to perfection but i didnt like it wasn't my taste but good service! Yum strawberry milkshake too(: i think people should give it a shot. I wish they didnt charge a dollar for syrup though):

I am a huge fan of sandwiches and an even bigger fan of waffles. Put those two together and what do you have? DELICIOUSNESS. I will definitely be coming back often to try every single item on their menu. This is a must try!! So far, the items that I've ordered have not disappointed. I tried the chicken and waffle and it was my first time ever trying the combination of the two together and I thoroughly enjoyed it. Bruxie gives you a big piece of juicy chicken served with chili honey and coleslaw, simply amazing. Green eggs and ham waffle is probably my favorite. They add a pesto to the sandwich which makes it "green". On the sweet side, I ordered the strawberry creme brulee and all I can say is....WOW, if you don't get this one you're a fool! All in all, Bruxie definitely lived up to it's name. If anyone is near Old Town Orange I suggest you go here for your next meal.

The smoked salmon is a must try. Its a little expensive, but its worth it if you like salmon and waffels. THe pink lemonade is really good here too. Too bad its not refillable. The bruxie burger is also really good. I would recomend it if you're craving a burger. 蔭nd the waffel fries are awesome too.

everyone here's raving about their buttermilk fried chicken & waffle, and I can see why. It tastes much better than it looks, and the sauce is basically the cherry on top. Not too heavy/greasy, and also, the waffle is light enough to work well w/everything on their menu. -bacon/egg one is good for breakfast - strawberry creme brulee reminded me of what's inside strawberry crepes, except it's better b/c i personally think crepes are too heavy/doughy for me -bruxie burger SUCKS! it was the worst choice i made there, seeing how there's so many better things on the menu. patty was tasteless. don't even remember if there was sauce, since i didn't taste it. just bleh. waffles are just interesting. would hate to eat the waffles by themselves, b/c it reminded me of toast w/butter. but it works amazingly well with all the other ingredients on their menu. wish i bought more to-go, so i could eat it later.

Dear God, Sweet Jesus, etc, etc... Bruxie is one of the coolest restaurants I've ever eaten at. Their food is so delicious and on point that I cannot stop recommending the place. When I find a place on Yelp that has been hyped up or is really trendy, I have high expectations. Months may pass before I actually go to the restaurant. All the while, in my mind a standard is forming of exactly how good the food will be. Such was the case with Bruxie. I finally went and all of my high expectations were exceeded. This place is amazing. I got the Buttermilk Fried Chicken sandwich. It was nothing short of amazing. First, the food itself comes out extremely quick. Less than a minute. The waffle itself, used as the bread of the sandwich, is perfect. Far better than even Roscoe's waffle. I used to think Roscoe's had the best waffle in the world. They have been dethroned, replaced with Bruxie. It is crispy, light, airy, and moist in the center. The fried chicken was seasoned well, cooked perfectly, topped with a little coleslaw for crunch, and chili honey. The balance of flavors was impeccable. The chicken was extremely juicy. When I poured Cholula on top, everything just got even better between the sweet honey, salty chicken, and spicy sauce. The waffle fries are even better than what you'll find at Chick-fil-A. These are even more crispy, with salt and pepper on top. I cannot wait to come back and try more of the menu items. And it is definitely not out of the realm of possibility for me to get two sandwiches the next time I come.

I've yet to try Roscoe's famous chicken & waffles, but I'm completely utterly happy with Bruxie. I tried the chicken + waffles, waffle fries, and strawberry lemonade my first visit here. 蔜he waffles are lightly sweetened, and the chicken was nicely fried. 蔜he chicken wasn't heavily greased or fried, so don't worry about having a heart attack. 蔍t was lightly drizzled with sweet chili honey, and I was glad it was light... I'm not a huge fan of honey, but this was just enough for a light sweet taste. 蔜he strawberry lemonade is so good! A tad sour but whatevs. I came back another time and tried the Bruxie Burger waffle and mint chocolate shake. 蔜he waffle burger was "meh"... wasn't too impressed. 蔜he shake, however, BOMB DOT COM! 蔍t was like Thrifty's mint choc. chip ice cream..... but shake form and chocolate covering the entire side of the cup. The staff there are really sweet and are very attentive. 蔠hen you're there at rush hour, waiting in a long line (sad face) on a hot sunny day, there may be someone giving each and every sweaty customer a cup of cold water.

This is like a good sandwich shop but they use waffles instead of regular bread. 蔍t's all outside seating. 蔎ust order at the window and they will bring the food out to you. Seating is limited so it's not a good place to eat with your buddies if you have more than six people in your party. �Parking lot is super tiny, maybe big enough for four cars. 蔙ecommend parking on one of the lots nearby or park on street. Most popular item on the menu is the chicken & waffle which is basically a fried chicken sandwich with slaw and honey chili. 蔜he honey chili gives it a nice kick. 蔍 recommend getting the pure maple syrup for $1 and pour some over the chicken. �Roasted mushroom & goat cheese was good as well but not as good as the chicken & waffle. For sweet waffle, we tried the Ogura Bruxie which has red beans and sweet cream. 蔜his was ok but the cream tasted a bit sour. 蔄lso shared some liege waffle with Belgian chocolate. 蔜he chocolate was good but the waffle was a bit too soft for my taste. The service here is pretty good. 蔈veryone is very friendly and helpful. 蔕ne employee regularly walked around and asked people how they liked the food and if they needed anything else. 蔍 thought this was pretty cool for a casual food stand. Only reason I can't give 5 stars is because I wasn't too impressed with the waffle. 蔉or a place that specializes in waffles I expected it to be better. 蔜he waffles weren't very crispy even though I ate them right on the spot. �They have their regular menu and special menu so it's good to check back every few days to see if there's something unique you like.

I have only been to Bruxie in Orange and I absolutely recommend it. 蔄lthough there are limited savory options for vegetarians, the roasted mushroom and goat cheese Bruxie makes up for it. 蔜he flavors are great and the textures play well with each other. On top of the great food, the service is friendly - casual but top notch. Just be aware to dress appropriately because all seating is outside and primarily street parking.

To start, the waffles are light & fluffy. Toasted just perfect, not too crunchy & not too soft. 蔠e tried the following: -Cheddar, egg & bacon - yummy. 蔜hey prepare it with mayo (because bacon, cheddar & egg don't have enough cholesterol). If you find mayo as disgusting as I do, be sure to ask for it without. Also, be sure to order the maple syrup with this, a must. -Lemon & Berries - the lemon taste is perfect, not too tart & not too sweet. The strawberries & blackberries make it even better. If you like lemon, this is a must have. -Buttermilk fried chicken - even better than I was expecting. It is a thin chicken breast, perfectly seasoned & only slightly fried. The coleslaw is cider based, not mayo based which really adds to the flavor. Go early to avoid parking issues, but even if you have to walk a bit it's worth it. 蔣es, they could use more seating but this is a new favorite for sure.

I have always wanted to go to this place because of all the hype and reviews, so guess what...I finally got to go. I must say it is good but not BOMB or DELISH. I think I went overboard on the ordering. Chicken waffle - Good but the waffle gets soggy quick which i dislike about it. Next time I would suggest not to get the syrup in the mix Mushroom salad waffle - Looks bomb but it was alright Strawberry Creme Dessert - Good but once again it gets soggy quick. The customer service is great tho. 蔠e was sitting at a table where the sun was beaming at us. 蔍t was getting hot and one of the guys that work there realized it and helped us out with that. 蔛uch great people.

SE Corner of Glassell and Palm While I am raising Bruxie a star I am still yet to be blown away by their food. From an operational and service standpoint they are a definite 5 stars. The staff is quite friendly and efficient offering friendly banter while still remaining expedient! Seating like parking is pretty limited. They have quite a bit of high tables and bar tables to stand and eat if there are no more regular tables. On this visit I opted for another one of their Seasonal Specials which was the Hot Pastrami for $6.95: http://www.yelp.com/biz_�which fared much better than the Short Rib Sandwich I had on my last visit. This sandwich comes with Grilled Pastrami, Gruyere Cheese, Citrus Slaw, Spicy Pickles, and Spicy Brown Mustard. While it was a bit on the greasy side (it's grilled Pastrami, so of course) this sandwich still had a nice balance of textures and flavors. The slightly crispy waffle "bun" did a great job of holding all the ingredients in so I didn't end up looking like a kindergartner! Be careful where you park. Some parking requires a sticker and other parking is only 30 minutes.

If your just looking at it, you wouldn't think it would blow you away (seriously.. it just looks like chicken and waffle). I want to go back already.. =\. The waffle fries were alright..

Whenever we make a trip to Disneyland, the group I'm with always insists on getting Roscoe's (you can never go wrong with Chicken and Waffles). Except this one trip where we brought my boyfriend along and he suggested Bruxie. THANK GOODNESS! :) I forgot all about Roscoe's and their soggy waffles! Yes, the lines can be long (can you blame them?) Yes, you have to search for parking in the neighborhood (but you probably need the walk anyway after ordering all those sandwiches) Yes, they only have outdoor seating (but the fresh air is better for you & people watching is more fun) Yes, there aren't public bathrooms (but you probably need the walk to search for one anyway after ordering all those sandwiches) (that's why I've had to subtract a star for my review) These are the sandwiches I've ordered: - Buttermilk Fried Chicken: tasty but part of the waffle can get soggy because of the coleslaw. made me think of Roscoes, haha, but their chicken was more delicious. mind you, it wasn't CRISPY-CRISPY chicken but it was juicy! - Bruxie Burger: I LOVE BURGERS and the fact that they put it in a waffle sandwich? GENIUS. - Bacon, Egg, and Cheddar: super heavy but the taste is delicious. The egg was cooked so you weren't left with a yolk-y mess. I have also tried the Cheesy Bruxie w/Tomato and Avocado (super light, felt healthy, but satisfying) and S'mores (very sweet, but tasty). The servers are all very helpful and fantastic! I love Bruxie so much that I hope the weather gets COLDER so people won't want to wait in the lines and I can buy more sandwiches (side note: they do have an area protected by plastic walls with heaters! i probably don't make sense but you should visit). Also, they have (free) water, an area for you to get extra napkins, a hand sanitizer dispenser, and paper towels--all very crucial items for your visit!

Chicken and waffle very good, but liked the Bruxie burger just a little more. Frozen custard 蔲or desert was amazing, perfect sweetness. Craved it for a few days after. Ask for a sample if you don't believe me ; ) Very nice staff! We put frozen custard on hold until done eating, and they asked us twice if we were ready for it, they remembered! They had a huge line too, made me feel special they would even follow up with us. Would've liked to try their Iced tea, but they ran out for 15 min when I ordered. It must be good if they had to brew more.

First of all, I totally was not looking to give out my first 5-star review to a ... "waffle" joint? 蔕h my... Random afternoon, some of my friends came into town, and were recommended Bruxie's to try out. 蔍 happen to come along.... and BOY WAS I AMAZED. Our party (all first timers) sampled three things: 1) 蔆lassic "Brussels Waffle" Off of first look, this was nothing special... It was a fluffy waffle, with some powdered sugar, and some syrup on the side... BOY WAS I WRONG! I bit into it and the waffle was firm (not mushy) yet soft, it melted in my mouth and the flavors all came together just right. �("Dang, this is the best gosh-darn waffle I've ever had" was the first thought through my head) Conclusion? 蔠ant something simple, light, and sweet? this is the item for you! 2) Bacon, Egg, and Cheddar My friend wanted something salty... salty? Bacon? cheese? on waffles??? Yeah.. i was 100% skeptical, but hey, go with it and try it out! To my surprise, this was actually delicious! I always knew there was this "chicken 'n' waffles" thing out there, but I have yet to try it, so the idea of something salty with waffles was already known. 蔜his thing was hella good! Conclusion? Lookin' for something salty, tasty, but not overbearing? 蔜ry the Bacon, Egg, and Cheddar! 3) Seasonal Creme Brulee This one was basically two waffles filled in the middle with creme brulee and strawberries. 蔍t was pretty awesome! 蔍'm usually not a fan of super sweet desserts (such as creme brulee), but this one definitely hit the spot. I'd say it'd be like a great after-dinner thing with a date, then continue to mosy around Old Town Orange. Conclusion? 蔛weet, light, and refreshing. Yes.... I realize I have yet to give a 5-star review for any location... Well, congrats to Bruxie's on being my first. Hope I inspire some of you to check this place out! Have a great day Yelp! (Note: I believe Bruxie's is coming to downtown Brea as well, so that'll be more exciting!)

This is where the best chicken and waffles are at. There's always a line, but it moves quickly so just be patient and wait... *Buttermilk fried chicken & waffle $6.95 the buttermilk fried chicken is drizzled with chili honey and packed with cole slaw all inside a crispy, non-greasy waffle. This alone is worth waiting in line...Add the waffle fries to your meal for $2.25. They use peanut oil which makes the food in general less greasy. *Frozen custard $2.95 (Small) It's like custard flavored frozen yogurt. It was pretty good, but even the small was too much for me alone. The small is probably enough to share with 2-3 people. I've never had frozen custard before but it reminded me of the custard at Beard Papas. Outdoor seating only- claim your table/bench on a first come first serve basis. Considering the casualty and informal setting, the service was spot on. As a first time customer, I felt really taken care of. They forgot to put in my frozen custard order so after talking to the waitress, she put in the order for me while I ate my chicken and waffles, without me having to wait in line again. Awesome!

this place is exactly as amazing as it sounds- i ordered the famous fried chicken waffle sandwich. the sweet chili honey was definitely a pleasant surprise. the waffle was airy and light, while the chicken was moist (and humongous). i also tried a bite of the pulled pork special- that was amazing as well. honestly i think anything tastes good with these waffles. for dessert, we got the lemon cream waffle which had marshmallow spread and lemon filling and we added berries for a dollar. it was a great combo- i loved it. but i definitely felt like exploding after. great service, fair prices, perfect for a quick comfort meal! just be prepared to feel really fat afterwards

We had been meaning to try Bruxie for the longest time (hope they open something in South County soon!), and decided Super Bowl Sunday lunch would be a good time. 蔠e were fortunate to come at a time when Chef Kelly was there and we were able to chat him up (my partner is in the food industry as well). 蔙eal nice guy. We ordered the standard Chicken & Waffle Sandwich with Spicy Chili sauce- soo great! 蔜he waffle that holds the sandwich is really done well- nice and crispy, not soggy or lifeless, and not sweet like you would normally expect a waffle to be. 蔠e also had a special that day, Pulled-Pork, with a great homemade BBQ sauce, really tangy, big chunks of pulled pork, delicious. 蔋omemade lemonade and iced tea for drinks. We were treated to the sundae- a caramelized pearl sugar waffle, topped with frozen soft-served custard and chocolate and peanuts and caramel and whipped cream. 蔄 normal waffle would have wilted under that, but this waffle that they make at Bruxie, that cruchy caramelized treat- WOW. This is no ordinary "stand". 蔍t's clear the emphasis is on the quality and taste of the food. 蔠e will be back!

Great place to eat. Its a place you have to at least try once. The waffles are light and crispy. Definitely not as thick as breakfast waffles. They created the texture of the waffle to taste fluffy and airy. Essentially it is a sandwich, using waffles as the bread. I have tried the salmon and classic fried chicken. Both were great and delicious. Salmon is your classic lox and cream cheese. Never thought it would taste well with a waffle but it did. It was a very light meal. A definite for anyone who doesn't want to eat heavy because believe me, some of the other ingredients they put in their sandwiches can have you in a food coma. Which is a good thing ;) Fried chicken is savory and cooked to perfection. They add a little bit of rosemary to the batter so you get that classic rosemary and chicken taste. You have the option of adding syrup to your meal. I highly recommend eating the chicken and waffle with the syrup. It creates a sweet and salty taste I love. The portions are a decent size. I usually just get one but I have gone with a parties who definitely ordered more than one sandwich each. With such great flavors I wouldn't blame them. Milkshakes are delicious as well. I tried the banana chocolate and the mint chocolate. Both excellent shakes. Fries are waffle shaped. Great classic waffle fries you cant go wrong. Crispy 蔭nd not too salty or oily. Just the way I like my fries. The place is outdoors. You order at the window and have a seat at tables around the restaurant. The food is brought to you. Service is fast and efficient. Warning: sometimes it get pretty packed so there might be instances where you might have to stand and eat because all the tables are taken. Overall this place is definitely worth the drive and money.

Food ====== Average Price $6.50 6.95 Buttermilk Chicken & Waffle - Please, just go to Roscoe's. 7.95 Smoked Salmon & Dill Cream Cheese - Even the corner donut shop does this better. Or maybe... it's just not meant for a waffle. 7.95 Prosciutto and Gruyere - Disappointment. Would've been better off with some Fresh & Easy prosciutto and gruyere and make your own dawn grilled cheese & ham wackness 6.50 Seasonal Creme Brulee - 4.95 Brussels Waffle - since the waffle is their essential ingredient in all their things, maybe the fault with how.... disappointing their sandwiches are is based on their waffle. It was good, but not, dream I want it, damn I have a craving for some waffles good. In fact, good is in honesty an overrating, just cause it was warm and hot and fresh and maybe that's rare, but not rare enough to give Bruxie a better rating than it deserves. 4.95 Dulce de Leche Shake or Something..... terrrrible; too sweet; got the same type of thing at Haagen Daaz for pretty much the same price, and Haagen Daaz is sooo much better. Avoid with a long stick! Location ======= Downtown Orange, so shit parking. The parking lot's always filled, so you're gonna end up parking on the street and lo and behold, it's on the corner of a 4-way stop sign, making things particularly slow sometimes. Decor ======= About 5 outdoor tables with awning over it. 3 are bench style, I think. Water and cups offered on the side Service ====== Unremarkable, but shifting towards the down side. Extra! ====== - Accepts cards (not Discover) - bathroom and two computers in the back - Sometimes if you ask for water at the counter, they charge 25 cents for the cup.

Not your normal roscoes chicken and waffles. Putting it together with coleslaw and their spicy honey syrup makes it an even better combo. I ask for extra on the side cuz i slober my food with sauce for more of a kick. Pair it with the strawberry lemonade.

BRUXIE, just mention the name and I drool. Sweet sweet memories of savoring every delightful bite consumed. Great twists on everyday eats and making them gourmet. I would recommend the chicken waffle (chili honey FTW!), creme br瀕巈 w/strawberries, and the frozen custard was creamy, smooth, and light. Located right next to Chapman University, timing is key for parking's sake, do go when students are on break!

I came back again because I didn't find anything I wanted to eat at the Orange International Street Fair. 蔍 thought I'd give it another try. 蔝nfortunately, 2nd time was not the charm, either. �The Buttermilk Fried Chicken & Waffle http://www.yelp.com/biz_�was better than last time in terms of flavor and wasn't as dry, but it was so greasy that I had to use a napkin to soak up all the oil. 蔣es, yes, I know, it's fried chicken,but other fried chicken was not drenched in grease like this! �My fiance had the Bruxie Burger http://www.yelp.com/biz_�and gave it 2 stars. 蔈nough said!

I really like the concept of this place! Who doesn't love waffles? My good friend took me here for breakfast when I was in town. We weren't that hungry so we shared the bacon, egg, and cheddar sammy and waffle fries. The sammy was soooo good! The cheese was melty and there was lots of bacon! The waffle was light and crunchy (btw the fries were average waffle fries). Yum yum! Sharing the sammy with my friend was a good idea, because it really filled me up. I can't wait to come back to try more of their menu! Eat it. Really Really Like it. Repeat.

Bruxie might be one of the sole reasons why I love SoCal. Their famous waffle sandwiches are to absolutely die for. This must become a weekly ritual for all SoCal residents. The prosciutto & byre (add avocado & sun dried tomato - for $1 each ) will absolutely change your life, forever. I seriously dream about that crunchy savory melted to perfection sandwich. Oh, How I miss you

Wow if I had penny for everytime someone asked me if I had been here or raved about it on FB, I would of had some loose change for once! Very 1st time I came here was during a weekday & it was busy, like a dummy, I parked right around the corner and got a $56 parking ticket. I tried their famous chicken waffle and it was good but my expectations were shattered. It took me a bit to like the sweet/sour thing going and the main saleing point of being in a waffle makes its so messy and greasy as it absorbs the sauce real quick. The 2nd time, I came back on a weekend & parked at Champan during the graduation we attended, I had the turkey sandwich & that was much better. Not enough to make me a believer though. Now, I really detest having to hawk around, look for a table, then wait for someone to completly butcher your name as they go around 2 times & wonder if they are calling your name to give your order. Overall, its a bit overhyped, I hate the fact that its a stand shop, it gets too busy & parking sucks. If I ever happen to be close by the Brea location, I'll try it but wont bother with this stand even though its really close to my house & the original shop.

I kind of feel like my review is going to be irrelevant since there are already 1300 that will most likely be similar to mine. Being a SF girl, I am NOT used to the heat. 蔜he day we decided to go to Bruxie it was freakin 97 degrees out! 蔍 was expecting to be eating indoors with the AC..then I see that its just a walk up window and you have to fight for seats. 蔜here was easy access to water and spray misters to cool down customers as we waited. 蔕ne of the chefs walked around handing out menus and discussed daily specials with patrons while another worker walked down the line taking orders to get the line moving faster. 4 of us squished into a table meant for 2. �I shared the famous chicken & waffle and the prosciutto & gruyere - with mustard on the side! 蔠e both agreed the proscuitto was our favorite even though the portion was on the skimp side compared to the chicken. 蔜he chili honey glaze that came with the fried chicken was almost sickingly sweet and made the what should have been crispy chicken a little soggy. The waffles were both good but they're made inconsistently. 蔜he waffle that came with the prosciutto was cooked almost perfectly! 蔜he waffle that came with the chicken was too crunchy. �Would definitely come back to Bruxie's if I'm ever in the area. 蔍 must try the pastrami and the Bruxie burger!!

Here's what is great about this little place: - fantastic staff. 蔉riendly, personable, didn't feel push. 蔈xtremely informative. - innovation. They have all kinds of sandwiches here, and you can't find most of these in many other stops. - waffles for buns. I'm not a huge waffle fan, but it sure looks fun. Here's what's NOT so great about Bruxie: - the wait. 蔠e lucked out. 蔠e went around 5 PM on a Friday night and barely waited. 蔅ut I've seen this place have a line wrapped around the joint. 蔜hat's just nuts. - no bathroom. Ok, it's OUTDOORS but because of historical building codes, there are no bathrooms??? 蔈W. 蔅ring your hand sanitizer or walk over to Chapman University's law school building (roughly a 2 minute walk) to get yourself clean enough to eat. - the price. 蔍'm sorry, but I cook, so I have an idea how much this stuff costs. 蔜here's no trick. 蔍t's not fancy presented, or even have superior ingredients. 蔍t's just FOOD. 蔍 just made me a green egg and ham sandwich with my Belgium waffle that will pay itself (waffle iron and all from Costco) within 4 sandwiches. 蔔o joke. 蔍'm sorry but an eight dollar sandwich should taste like an eight dollar sandwich. 蔜his tastes more like a $4.50 sandwich. Don't get me wrong � the food is just fine, and for a little place on the corner, you can't beat that kind of service (smile and everything). 蔅ut for me and my money, I think I'd rather eat at home or go somewhere I can literally never figure out how you made it.

Definitely the best waffle place I can find in Orange County. Their waffles are crispy, light and fluffy. Also, the concept is quite fun. The green eggs and ham is definitely one of my favorites! The Lemon Cream and Berries is good, but on my own was a bit too much (though I don't have a big sweet tooth). Their custard is really good as well. 蔍 can't wait to go back and try their waffle fries!

Finally! Yelp reviews are accurate for once!!! I hardly trust yelp reviews but this time was worth it at Bruxie. There's something so unique and interesting about this small friendly joint that serves crispy, fluffy savory and sweet waffles. I tried the famous buttermilk fried chicken and waffle. The combination of salty and sweet maple syrup was explosive and empowering. It's great! Also I had the smoked salmon and dill cream cheese waffle. First bite into gave a soft texture and compliments well with the semi crispy waffle. Next time I will try the fig and proscitto and Bruxie burger. I didn't get to try the shake cuz it was still too early for my taste buds to appreciate that kind of treat. Their Service was efficient and outstanding. There will be a next time :)

Food fads come and go real quick in this day and age, and during summer 2011 Bruxie was the hot spot to go for the newest concept of the year. A bruxie is a waffle that isn't as sweet as the ordinary waffles you may get at your breakfast joint. Bruxie waffles are more mild and can be perfectly served as either a dessert or as a savory item. Now knowing this, you know what Bruxie serves right? Waffle sandwiches!! The light airy texture of the waffle contrasting against whatever you get as a filling makes it a perfect snack for your daytime adventures into Old Towne Orange. I've tried plenty of these waffles but I've got to say that the chicken and waffles is the only one that resonates with the big fat tub of lard that lives in the depths of my soul! Served with a sweet chili honey and coleslaw, this thing hits the spot when you want fried chicken, but you want to say that you had a light lunch. You really can't go wrong there, especially if you pair whatever you're eating with an old fashioned float or egg cream! Now, as much as I love love love Bruxie's menu, I am not in love with the location. Old Towne Orange is not very traffic or parking friendly, so be prepared for that as you make your way to this iconic food trending location. And be sure to take a picture of whatever you're eating so that everyone will know how modern and sophisticated your food tastes are ;)

Mmmmm holy greasy goodness! Swang by on a weekday mid-afternoon without a line. Had to buy it for take-out so the waffles lost a part of their crisp during the 20 min drive but it was still delicious. Got one of the seasonals, green eggs and ham, that was wonderfully flavored in pesto. Ingenious combination. It does drip oil quite a bit but you'd have to expect that from ham, eggs, and pesto sauce! The buttermilk chicken was also savory and moist. I went light on the syrup and felt that was plenty. �Fun and novel. Will have to try the sweets next time.

Yum Yum Yummmmmmmmmm!!! Bruxie is amazing! Bruxie has gourmet waffles that are just something you have to try for yourself. They had a huge menu filled with all different types of waffles sandwiches. I went with my cousins, uncle, and sister so I got to try a bite of each of their sandwiches. I got one of their specials for the day which was short ribs with bleu cheese, which was tender and delicious. I also got to try the Bruxie Burger, the roasted mushroom and goat cheese (which was very light), the pastrami, and the fried chicken and waffle. Which were all delicious! To drink, I had the date shake, and for dessert I had the creme brulee waffle which was to die for!! If you like waffles, I guarantee you will love Bruxie!

I tried the Salmon something, it was really good. Who knew cucumbers and cream cheese tasted so swell together. I also tried their irish nachos which was not overdone with sour cream which I greatly appreciate. I wanna try their shakes.

Having attended Chapman, I knew about the parking situation in the area on the weekends, but not a holiday weekend. It's pretty packed considering the street fair going on as well as the parties and usual people hanging out in Old Towne Orange. So, after driving around looking for a parking spot, I finally make my over to Bruxie. I remember parking at that corner back when it when something else- just don't remember what that was. No long lines, quick service. Easy to find seating. Nothing like the some of the stories I've heard from others who had been here before. There are no indoor seating - all outdoors and not quite covered. I decided to try their seasonal pulled pork special as I wasn't in the mood for chicken and nothing else on the menu was calling out to me. My waffle sandwich - I guess I'm calling it as I don't know how else to describe it - wasn't bad. I would have liked a little more salt and for the accompanying sauce to be a little more spicy but overall, it was ok. I've tried it. It wasn't bad. I won't bend over backwards to return anytime soon but if I were in the area, I might stop in again to sample something else on their menu.

Very good and very tasty here! My girlfriend and I got the Yelp favorites - the buttermilk waffle chicken sandwich, waffle fries, orange soda pop, and the strawberry cream brulee (all of which were super good (5/5!) I would definitely recommend the strawberry cream brulee because it is like a crepe, but 100x better. The waffle fries are salted, which we did not like though. The area and place is super nice and in a nice area :)

Finally got to try this place after 09843485498 years! This place is an outdoor restaurant with HORRIBLE parking. I came during lunch hour on a really hot day. I was already cranky from the heat and just sitting outside trying to eat my food with the sprinklers that keep the people cool are spraying in my food is no bueno, BUT my ratings are never usually based on service, decor, and blah blah blah stuff like that. It's on the quality of the food, and this place is pretty damn good! My friend and I got the albacore tuna waffle sandwich, the pastrami waffle sandwich, the waffle fries, and the creme brulee waffle. The albacore tuna sandwich isnt that bad. The crisp veggie and the hot sauce makes it taste pretty good. I just wish the waffles on all of the sandwiches were more crunchy and crisp. My pastrami sandwich was actually pretty good. The pastrami was REALLY tender and juicy as one of the workers recommended. These two sandwiches are part of the seasonal menu too. The waffle fries were nothing special to me. Now here is the best part of my lunch; the creme brulee waffle! I am not a big fan of creme brulee. In fact, I HATE creme brulee.. It's a flavorless and unsatisfying dessert, but the custard, strawberries and 蔯innamon in this waffle is soo good. Its taste reminds me of the strawberry croissant at cream pan in Tustin. Also, their sodas are consist of real cane sugar instead of those sweeteners in regular sodas. I thought it wouldn't make a difference in the taste but it does, and that is a good thing. 蔍 also love my strawberry lemonade too. It had those little pulps in them and it's not too sweet like many strawberry lemonades. Overall, I like this place, but I'm not a sandwich nor a lunch person, so I don't know if the parking and the whole idea of sitting outside in the heat again is worth my time of coming back here. Maybe during winter, when it's much cooler.

Was craving something yummy for lunch and I ended up in a long line at Bruxie! 蔕f course I got the fried chicken sandwich and for my son, the cheese waffle. 蔍 was a little disappointed by my sandwiches this time. 蔜here was very little cole slaw in the fried chicken sandwich, it still tasted pretty good but I really wanted something amazing. 蔒y sons cheese waffle had literally one slice of cheese in it! 蔋e is only 1 so I'm sure he didn't really care, but if I'm paying $4.95 for this sandwich it better had cheese dripping out the sides! 蔕f course he didn't eat the whole thing and I took the rest home added more cheese and bacon and it was darn good after my modifications. 蔄ll in all still a good little lunch but 蕋he quality has gone down a little.

I had high hopes for this place. And although my party and I ordered a lot (in order to try a good selection of items) every bite was just "hmm" and "not sure if I love it". Wait, I take that back because the pumpkin shake was great and tasted exactly like a creamy, milky pumpkin pie in a cup. We had two fried chicken waffles, a burger waffle, strawberry cheesecake (which, unknowingly, comes in a waffle form too) and creme brulee (waffle again). I was waffled out by the end of our meal. I hate when I'm really eager to try a new spot and it's a let down. But not such a huge disappointment where I won't give it another shot (I would go back once more to try the bacon and egg waffle). Hehe, what can I say, I love food...

(Dined 10/29/11 SA): After listening to my friend endlessly rave about Bruxie and their gourmet waffle sandwiches, it finally was time that I investigated this place out. This was a particularly beautiful sunny warm day as earlier in the week not so great. Thus, it made the drive down to the City of Orange a nice one, to have lunch and hang out with a friend of mine. Thankfully, my friend was already waiting in line, because as I was walking up to Bruxie, there was a line at least 30-40 people deep! Yikes, what are they putting in these waffles!? Since my friend has tried nearly everything on the menu, I left the ordering to him. Man did he go to town! We ordered and split the Buttermilk Fried Chicken & Waffle ($6.95), Bruxie Burger ($6.95), Roasted Mushroom & Goat Cheese ($7.95), and Strawberry Cr弇e Brulee ($5.95). Each sandwich came with a side order of their waffle fries. Lastly, I also had a mint chocolate shake ($4.95) and he a lemonade ($2.25). I've never had a waffle sandwich/burger before, so this concept was an eye-opener for me. How come there aren't more establishments like this around (as of this writing, they are in the works opening a new location in Brea)? Everything tasted incredible and the serving size is healthy! The waffles were light and crispy, and all the various ingredients were fresh. My favorite was the Buttermilk Fried Chicken & Waffle. I don't know what they did to the chicken but please don't change a thing; it's perfect! The cr弇e brulee was equally tasty though it felt odd eating it in my hands instead of with a spoon. The shake was thick (but not so thick that it hurts when you take a swig from your straw) with plenty of chocolate. Mmmm! The service was good, as our order was taken quickly and correctly, our food was delivered in adequate time, and our empty trays were cleaned away quickly. Seating/tables are not plentiful so expect to wait a bit before a spot opens up. Parking is ample, either on the street (metered or timed in most spots) or one of the many public parking lots in and around the historic downtown area where Bruxie is located. On this particular day, everyone was out and about, so I parked several blocks away, but the scenery and weather made the walk worth it. Overall, I'm definitely a fan of this place, and I hope they open a location in Los Angeles county. The menu is relatively sparse with many unique items, but each sounded yummy! I feel there is value as noted by the prices I quoted above (total bill was around $35 [tip not required]). The atmosphere is pure casual and the local community definitely supports this place (right next to Chapman University). Although my friend paid this time, they do take my credit card of choice...AMEX!

So I finally drank the kool-aid and tried this place. Not that I'm not a fan of waffle sandwiches, (well I didn't know I was- as it turns out I am) it's just that the old Dairy Treet held some pretty good childhood memories for me.... but now that I've had a fig and prosciutto waffle sandwich, childhood memories be damned, bring on the waffle sammies! My husband had the burger, which was pretty tasty as well. Next time I'm gonna try the smoked salmon business they have going on. Oh also btdubs, the line isn't as bad as it looks ( because it looks like the Peter Pan ride at Disneyland)- it moves along pretty quickly & they're good about bringing your food out promptly as well. The misters help.

Bruxie is a place I wish wasn't so far far away from me because it's a delicious place with charm and appeal. It's not a very indoors place but they do have limited covered seating if just by chance it is raining. I had the fried chicken and waffle which included some cole slaw and honey. It was tasty with a very mild spice. The rest of the menu looks tasty and I eagerly anticipate coming back. Pros: 蔳ood food Cons: 蔍 got a little wet. Your results will vary. ;-)

So good my wife refuses to try any of the other restaurants nearby. Can't complain since Bruxie is just. that. good. We've tried pretty much everything on the menu. The Bruxie Burger is still my favorite, followed closely by the Cheese Bruxie with avocado. I think the only item I didn't like was the roasted mushrooms with goat cheese. For dessert, the Ogura Bruxie is the tits. Most times we order our food to-go and race home to eat it while it's still hot. But it's better to eat there while the waffles are still a crispy. The staff there is extremely friendly. In fact everyone seems happy to be there. I can't imagine why.

I don't know what this review will really contribute after 1000+ but my friends will probably see this, so this is for you guys, he he he. Came here a while back after a suggestion from a few friends and seeing how many friggin reviews this place got, we HAD to check it out. 蔆razy cuz I'd been to DT Orange before on a few occasions and never heard of this place...which is truly a wonder. When you first walk up to this joint or drive by looking for parking(it can be hectic), you just see a stand, kinda like an old school burger stand or something, but you see a super long line, so you know you prob wanna try it out. Waffle Samiches - hmmm, doesn't sound like the best or most tasty thing ever when you hear it, but if you've had chicken and waffles, then you'd know that waffles are practically a good combo with anything. I had the Prosciutto and Gruyere samich, which was very good, but definitely not as filling as the Fried Chicken one that the rest of my party had. 蔅ut add some fries and a milk shake and you'll have had more than enough. Service is very good; you order at the counter and they bring you your food and will come by pretty often to check on ya and see if you need anything else. 蔕nly thing that sucks is that there are only a few tables; mostly standing counter space to eat on. 蔍'm not the biggest fan of eating standing up. �Parking - Like I said, can get pretty hectic, you gotta find street parking, but beware because on some of the neighboring streets, you need a permit. 蔅ut at the end of the day, ees burry burry worth it!

I gave this place two tries and both times I came away unimpressed. 蔍 understand how this place is sort of fun in a quirky sort of way. 蔜he food, however, was not all that great. �I liked the chicken and waffles for the first couple of bites but I quickly grew tired of it. 蔍 also tried the pulled pork and waffle. 蔜his was also good for a bite or two before the whole thing became overwhelmingly soggy. 蔜he creme brulee with the waffle was a forced idea to go along with the rest of the waffle theme. 蔍t was not a good combination of flavors and ingredients.

WOW! 蔅elieve all the hype about this place! Bruxie is AH-MAZING! The service is efficient and friendly regardless to how busy it gets. 蔍nitially, the lines are a bit intimidating because they can get pretty long, but they make you feel that your business is important to them, and that your experience there is a good one. They will come outside and greet those that are standing in line, offer a menu to look at, ask if you have questions about items on the menu, and will even take your order before you get to the window. Here's how that part works: While you're in line, they'll write down what you want on a order slip that they will give to you. 蔜hey will also ask for your name. 蔋old on to that order slip because you will in turn, give that slip to the person at the order window. 蔜hey tell you how much, and you give them the money. That's when you try to figure out where to dine. it's outdoor seating/standing only and space is limited. When your order is ready, someone walks around with your order calling your name and you can't be shy to say, "here!" to make sure you get your delicious morsels of waffle goodness! I highly recommend the fried chicken and waffles with the maple syrup...OH EM GEE! 蔍 don't think my tastebuds have ever had that flavor before! 蔍t was absolutely scrumptious! The Irish nachos was a flavor blast of yummy goodness sprinkled with large bits of bacon on top of their "waffle" fries (criss cut). The chocolate banana shake is made with real bananas and get this, melted Belgian chocolate! 蔣UM! 蔜opped with whipped cream and sprinkled with nuts. �That alone was worth going! For dessert, we decided to go with a dish on their "seasonal fave" menu board that is not on the everyday menu....Strawberry cheesecake. �All I can say is WOW! 蔍 had no idea they could do that to a waffle! Cheesecake cream, sprinkled with graham crackers, layered with a strawberry puree nestled inside a folded waffle. All together now, mmmmmm....... �They're also big time JERKS! �...Soda jerks, that is! 蔐OL Apparently, they MAKE their own sodas there too! Quality food at reasonable prices....but they will add up. 蔈ach waffle dish will probably run between $6 - 8. 蔠affle fries are shy of $3 if you order them a la carte. The shakes are about $5.

I always feel like somebody's watching me...lol. This neighborhood that is. Kinda on the old eery side. So I think it's best to go during day and not when the sun goes down. When we arrived there was a small, but yet doable line. It gave us time to decide what we wanted to order. It gave me time to look at all the Yelp reviews to see what was good or not. =) I decided to get the Wild Mushroom while the hubby decided to stay on the safe side and get the Buttermilk Chicken. Along with waffle fries and their "Old Fashioned Sugar Cane" Coke. Oh and can't forget the Creme Br瀕巈 for dessert! I should've busted being a copy cat and staying on the safe side because I was only able to finish one piece of the Wild Mushroom, I think I even forced myself to finish it. All I can taste was the balsamic dressing which was drenched in it! I took a bite of the Buttermilk Chicken and debated if I should order another rather than eating all that my hubby had left lol but I didn't since the Creme Br瀕巈 was on its way! The Coke and waffle fries tasted as any regular Coke and waffle fries would. The Creme Br瀕巈 arrived and I couldn't wait to get my teeth into it! It was heaven on earth! So freakin' good! My advice is to get two of these suckers just in case you don't end up liking your Wild Mushroom HA! or don't like sharing yummy things lol We didn't end up getting seconds b/c it would be our reason to come back and it was sort of on the pricey side. I think almost $40 for 3 waffle orders, fries and a coke. I could've eaten all you can eat somewhere else, but of course it's for the experience. So go experience peeps! The Buttermilk Chicken and the Creme Br瀕巈 that is! Hmm, I think all the dessert waffles will do too! Yum!

I've been to this place several times, and it never disappoints. I'm huge fan of waffles in the first place, but Bruxie's waffles are sublime. They have an amazing flavor, yet remain light and fluffy. I'd recommend pretty much everything on the menu whether it's savory or sweet. I also suggest following them on Facebook so you can check out their specials! Last year I got clued in to their 4th of July special which was a flown in from Maine Lobster bruxie, and I was not disappointed. If you're looking for a negative, those who have bigger appetites might not be full after just a sandwich and fries.

Heard alot of buzz about this place after my friends checked them out. Apparently they are really big in OC and recently opened up a chain in Brea. This is opened up in downtown Brea which has plenty of parking in the structures. It's in a small plaza which is really nicely decorated and nice stroll on a date. It's located on the corner so you can't miss it. Fairly small shop and I was surprised by the garage door arrangement but I guess it is unique. Got the buttermilk chicken and waffle since it's everyone's favorite. It's definitely something new to try, but honestly... there's not much... It really seemed plain to me. I wouldn't go out of my way to eat here but if I was in the area, sure. We also had the Belgian hot chocolate which was not sweet to my taste but the server said that was how it is. I did drink till the bottom though, and realized all the sweet syrup was on the bottom, you might wanna stir it up before u drink.

If i were just reviewing the pulled pork sandwich, Bruxie would absolutely get 5 stars. BUT, i've tried a few other things off the menu & they aren't nearly as mind blowing. The Pulled Pork waffle sandwich is seasonal, but the owners should really re think that one because it is the best thing they have!! The bacon, egg, & cheddar: 3.5, the gruyere & proscuitto: 3.5, the smoked salmon & cream cheese : 4 stars. The fried chicken & waffle is a bit dry. It has great flavor, but needs a lot of honey to get it to slide down your throat. 3 stars. The pastrami: great quality meat, great flavoring, but it is SO incredibly salty. A sweet must follow this sandwich. 4 stars Make your meal a combo. I love the waffle fries w/ a vanilla cream soda (pure cane sugar) from here. If you still have room for dessert, I recommend trying the strawberry creme brulee or a soft serve frozen custard. YUMMY!

Bruxie is just Flat Out AMAZING! A must go for anyone at least once in their life. First time i went there i had no clue at all what this all was. Luckily one of the chefs stay outside to chat with people in line "me" and answering questions and giving opinions on whats good. I took a quick look at yelp to see what's hot and whats not.. So we decided on the original chicken and waffles and almost the whole menu of the seasonal burxies haha. I asked the chef if they still had their pumpkin shake and he was nice enough to look in the kitchen if they had the supplies to make it and they DID! So i got that and the Pumpkin Shake was AmAZING! 10/10 The first seasonal Bruxie we ordered was the Pulled Pork Bruxie.. Personally that was my favorite 10/10 Second was the Pastrami Bruxie.. This still was great! another 10/10 Third was the Green Eggs and Ham.. At first i was like really??? It doesnt seem

O-M-G!!! Never had waffles this good!!! So I've heard many good things from my friends...and it's basically a good 1hr and 15min drive from my house. I would have to say, I would drive to this place just to satisfy my craving...It's toooo goooood!!!! I went on a Saturday and the line was out the restaurant. Tables were hard to find but I'm glad we waited. We had the BBQ Pulled Pork special and the Lemon Meringue special. I enjoyed both but I have a sweet tooth or should I say a sour tooth tooo???? The Lemon Meringue was AWESOME!!!! I wanted more of it but I didn't want to wait in line again and we were saving our stomach for something else later in the afternoon....hmmm...just writing this review makes my mouth water :)

WAFFLES DONE RIGHT! I usually pick pancakes over waffles, but this place completely changed my mind about waffles. Their waffle is not too sweet, very crispy and the perfect complement to all the diff. ingredients in their sandwiches. CHICKEN & WAFFLE: MY FAVORITE. I LOVE THIS SANDWICH. I usually try to make things I order at restaurants at home, but I can honestly say I cannot replicate this masterpiece. Everything in this sandwich goes together so well - PERFECTLY seasoned, juicy chicken, crispy waffle, creamy coleslaw, with a side of Chili Honey! I usually pick beef over chicken, but this chicken is seasoned so well I prefer it over their beef and it tastes MUCH BETTER THAN ROSCOE'S CHICKEN. TURKEY CLUB (seasonal): 蕋urkey, Gruyere cheese, bacon, avocado, pesto (?) spread, tomato and lettuce. One of the workers highly recommended this waffle sandwich, so I split it with a friend. There's so much going on inside the waffle that you can't really taste the waffle, so it acts more like sliced bread (don't know if that explanation made sense). The sandwich was good though! Everything was fresh and crispy. BRUXIE BURGER: My friend got this. I took a bite of the beef and it was well-seasoned! I will probably get this sometime in the future. CREME BRULEE: Dessert waffle with Vanilla cream, burnt sugar and seasonal fruit. I got a mix of figs and strawberries. Both fruits were good, but I liked the strawberries more because its tartness contrasted well with the Vanilla cream. Burnt sugar was delicious, it was like finding little treasures inside my waffle =) There's a lot of seasonal sandwiches going on like the Turkey Club, Pastrami, Pulled Pork, and Short Ribs....I want to try them all! I wish this was diet food, because I would eat here 3-4 a week if I could. Only cons I can think of is the seating and parking is kind of hard. It's located in the middle of a college town, right next to Chapman University, and is busy all the time. The service is great for not being a restaurant and the food is delicious, so that's enough for me to come back!

Finally! I had a chance to try the much-buzzed-about Bruxie. They make 2 kinds of waffles: a crispy, light, airy and not sweet waffle for sandwiches (items under savory and sweet) and the other is a thick, dense, sugary waffle (under the Belgium originals). We had Saturday brunch at Bruxie. The lines can get long, so we arrived at 10am to avoid a potentially long line and ordered: ----- 01. Bacon, Egg and Cheddar ($6.50) - 4.5 stars Tillamook cheddar, mayo an applewood smoked bacon 02. Buttermilk Fried Chicken & Waffle ($6.95) - 3 stars Chili honey and cole slaw (add 100% pure maple syrup $1) 03. Liege Waffles ($3.95) - 3 stars 04. Strawberry Lemonade ($2.95) - 4 stars 05. Black Cherry Soda ($2.50) - 3 stars The best waffle was the "Bacon, Egg and Cheddar" since the flavors are dynamic. The chicken in the "Buttermilk Fried Chicken & Waffle" needed more flavor or seasoning. Personally, I like waffles w/some fruit. Next time, I'm coming back for the "seasonal fruit cr弇e brulee" waffle. Traditional Brussels-style waffle are delicious. The waffle batter made for the sandwiches are my fav. Cost for a party of 2 is about $25 for 2 waffle sandwiches, 1 belgium original, 2 drinks. ----- P.S. Bruxie is opening a 2nd location in downtown Brea in early November on the Birch Street Promenade. Thanks for the tidbit Bruxie's employee. Allergic to peanuts? The waffle fries and chicken in the "Buttermilk Fried Chicken & Waffle" cause they're fried in peanut oil.

Best Chicken and waffle place around! Tucked away at the end of old town Orange right across from Chapman University is this little gem known as Bruxies. If you've ever had 蔙osco's Chicken and Waffles you'll fall in love with Bruxies. (This is the "White" version of the soul food from Rosco's) Pros: *If you like waffles, this is the place to be. The waffles are freshly made, and they are thick and fluffy and if you choose the chicken, it too is fresh and scrumtious. Lemonade is freshly squeezed. Cons: *Lines during brunch on weekends or lunch on weekdays is brutal!

Note to self... Don't come to this Bruxie location if it is windy and cold! The seating is outdoor! The only thing covering you is a plastic curtain... UGGHHH... Other than that... YUM! I tried their famous buttermilk fried chicken and waffle and it was not what I was expecting... don't get me wrong... It was GOOD, but not what I thought it was going to taste like. The surprising thing was that it was sort of sweet. It had sweet and sour sauce? Ionno. But something about it was sweet and I was not expecting that... Maybe I should have asked for it on the side because it made my waffle soft in the end and got my hands all sticky. I do though have to comment that the chicken piece was huge! And that it was cooked perfectly with the right seasoning and batter... Also the waffle was light and fluffy... My favorite though was Lemon Cr弇e with Berries waffle!!! SOOO GOOD!!! I ate my dessert first! Hahaha... The lemon cr弇e was soo lemony which I loved and the berries were sweet!!! It was my favorite for sure over the buttermilk chicken. Waffle fries... YUM. Strawberry lemonade... YUM Will come back here on a hot sunny day and try the Prosciutto Waffle.

I heard a lot about this place, but when I was going to Chapman it wasn't there. One fine Sunday we decided to go there, but it was raining.. (I know it doesn't happen very often in So Cal) so the place was packed and the rain was getting in... when we were about to leave there was one free table *it was meant to be* the waffles were sooooooo great! unbelievably tasty inside, and the outside was crisp to perfection! the service was great as well. Bottom line: I wish Bruxie would have been there *for me* when I was going to Chapman. My life would have been sweeter!

I cannot write a totally thorough review because I have not tried that many things on the menu but I will say what I know. The chicken waffle, or burdwich and my bff and I call it, is AMAZING. That meal gets 5 stars with the rooster sauce (which you will have to add yourself). 蔍 could eat that burdwich every day. 蔍t's a fried piece of chicken breast with their sweet coleslaw inside a waffle. mmm I also had a waffle with berries once. 蔜hat was good but how could anyone mess that up right? 蔄nother time, my bff just got waffles with syrup and sugar and those were really good too. 蔅ruxie has mastered the waffle. �Okay, I did come here one time and get a salmon waffle. 蔈w. 蔍'm sorry but I did not like it at all. 蔒y bff got the usual burdwich and I just kept gazing longingly at his meal while I forced down the salmon. 蔖eople like the salmon, and I like salmon in other types of food. 蔅ut I don't know what it was about it in that greenish stuff with the waffle that just was not my bag. �On to the crowd, it can be packed. 蔖repare to wait in line sometimes. 蔖repare to eat standing up. 蔠ear comfortable shoes. 蔣ou will be eating outdoors by the way. 蔜here is no indoor seating. �Try this place. They have lots of other items on the menu that I have been meaning to try like the peanut butter and jelly.

Pretty cute, cool place to eat! They let you choose from sweet or savory items from their menu. I had the smoked salmon (without the cream cheese) and it was DELICIOUS. So delicious that I went back in line and ordered another one!! Moderate prices for great food. Employees are nice and happy to chat it up with you while you're in line to help you decide what to get. I`m disappointed that they didnt have many options for vegetarians though :(

Everything (good) you've heard about Bruxie is true! The first time I went, I got the buttermilk chicken and the prosciutto and gruyere. Both really good, but didn't blow me away. The second time, though. Omg, the second time...I got this egg hash chive something or other sandwich. It's on the seasonal menu and I hope it's there for a while. The first bite was interesting. I didn't know what to expect so the corned (beef, I'm assuming?) was a little strange at first, but once I chewed a bit more, let it sink it, took another bite, I was in love! So good! My friend go the creme brulee one, and we were worried it'd be too sweet. But alas! It is not. It's perfect. They somehow get the delicious burnt sugar taste of creme brulee into the sandwich (maybe because they use real creme brulee? who knows what magical things happen back there) so it contrasts the syrupy goodness so well. To top it off, the people are sooo friendly and helpful, and aren't annoying about it. I wish I didn't write this. Now I'm having mad cravings.

Bruxie is such a cute and delicious establishment. It's a great place to lunch because they have tables and chairs so you can dine outside. I made sure i ordered their buttermilk fried chicken and waffles! I love sweet and savory foods together and I've been dying to try this combination for a long time. Their chicken was tender and seasoned perfectly and their waffle itself had the perfect crunch/softness that paired amazingly with their chicken, maple syrup and cider slaw! I love that it's served in sandwich form, very easy to eat! They also have a good variety of waffle sandwiches, desserts, shakes and waffle fries. From now on, i make sure i eat where every time i visit SoCal.

I love the concept of this place -- sandwiches with waffles as the bread. And I can't say it enough -- the chicken & waffle sandwich is definitely worth the trip. Get the waffle fries, and don't forget to mix up some Sriracha ketchup for yourself too! Not much else to add here, with 1,500+ reviews already on the books. Just some advice -- tables are obviously in high demand, so it helps to have someone scout tables while you're waiting to order. Flying solo? There's a bar to the side for you.

Great place to grab a light meal or dessert or BOTH. 蔐ocated in a cutesy part of town in Orange, right by Chapman university. 蔍t's very casual and quite a fun place to go. �I was told about the Buttermilk Fried chicken waffles.... I didn't think it'd be all that special.. but in my first bite, my eyes were unveiled!!! The clouds rolled back.. .and my unbelief dissipated. 蔕MG that bite was just so amazing. �Another savory waffle sandwhich was the Seasonal Creme Bruee waffle... that was surprisingly tastey. 蔒y friends realy enjoyed the Cheesey Bruxie and the lemon cream and berries waffle as well. The workers were extremely friendly! I think we asked for samples of the ice cream/ vanila custard over 3 times... and they gave us plenty to top our waffles with!

1,000+ reviews say it all. I remember when this little spot was Dairy Treat. It was within walking distance of my high school and I ate here a few times. And although Dairy Treat was 'cute', it has NOTHING on Bruxie. After MONTHS AND MONTHS...and MONTHS of begging my bf finally gave in and we went on a Saturday at about 9:20ish pm. This seemed like the perfect time there were more than enough tables and absolutely no line/wait. Since we had already ate (like it matters lol) we decided to share a Bruxie burger and a creme brulee waffle as well as a black cherry soda. The burger was just okay. I expected a lot more, but the meat was just mediocre. I'd still probably get it again, though. :) We were heading over to the Picture Show at Mainplace so we decided we were gonna be slightly ghetto and sneak in the brulee and soda. ;) Even after about 45 minutes this bad boy was amaaaaazing. The vanilla cream was perfect. The strawberries were fresh. The waffle was buttery and delish. Definitely a favorite. :D So how much did I like Bruxie? I went back the next day. FORREAL. On this day I decided to have the fried chicken+waffle...minus the coleslaw. The chicken was scuhh-rumptious. Not greasy, just perfectly breaded with lots of flavor. This was my first chicken+waffles experience (No roscoes yet) and I really don't know if any other place can compete. On top of all that, I must add that the staff is super friendly and helpful. They make sure that you feel comfortable enough to ask any questions. They all seemed really happy too. Just a great environment. :) Bottom line: Believe the hype! :)

My mom and I came here last Saturday at 11:00am. I was super excited to try this place, as many of my yelper friends have eaten here and raved about the waffles and the frozen custard. Both sound great to me! We decided to split the Bacon, Egg & Cheddar savory waffle sandwich and the Brussels Waffle. The Brussels waffle was ordered by mistake, I really wanted the Liege Waffle. Oh well, just another reason to come back to snack on waffles. I also had a small soft serve frozen custard. Yummers! Wow! Wow! The frozen custard was my favorite, then savory waffle sandwich and last is Brussels Waffle. My favorite waffle is still located in Denver at Waffle Brothers. http://www.yelp.com/biz/�I may just have to place an order for delivery of there waffles. http://www.wafflebrother�They are that good!

Finally i got to try Bruxie! It's been in my bookmarks for ages! OC is at least 45 minute drive so it's a hassle, but worth it! The only gripe i can say is parking around the area is a bitch because it's around a university, but other then that, the food is definitely worth the drive & hype! You would think waffles .. Big deal .. But you are very wrong! These waffles are light, crispy, and melt in your mouth. Not the heavy stuff you find from ihop or denny's. Mixed in with their creations, and you got yourself a treat. I luckily came with a bunch of friends and we all ordered different things. On the menu we got 1) buttermilk fried chicken & waffle, 2) seasonal cr巑e brul巈 (strawberry) 3) green eggs and ham (Friday special) 4) pastrami (Friday special) 5) lemon meringue (seasonal special) 6) and waffle fries. 1) buttermilk fried chicken & waffle - delicious! The chicken was so moist, the coleslaw added a great sweetness to it, and the chili honey topped it off. I didn't get maple syrup, but i really don't think it was necessary. 2) seasonal cr巑e brul巈 (strawberry) - what a great desert .. You don't get the top layer of the brulee with the crystalized sugar, but you do get the innards of it all. Let it sit for awhile, and the waffle becomes mushy and gooey and it just melts in your mouth delicious! 3) green eggs and ham (Friday special) - i really enjoyed this one .. Eggs, ham, and green pesto .. So simple, but it was so delicious. I love pesto on anything and this was such a good brunch meal to eat. 4) pastrami (Friday special) - if you like pastrami sandwiches, why not try it in a waffle? I tried the pastrami and it was nice and soft. Salty a bit, but nothing overpowering. 5) lemon meringue (seasonal special) - I'm not a lemon meringue person, but my friend said it was spot on. It was too tangy for me, but if you like the pie, i don't see why you wouldn't like this. 6) and waffle fries - pass on this .. It's nothing special!

Okay, I HAVE to bump Bruxie up to 5 stars based on their customer service alone! I've gone back a few more times since my last review and each time the service has been outstanding. The workers pass out menus while you wait, take your order in line when it gets busy and they expedite the food EXTREMELY fast. However, my experience earlier needs some recognition. After I already waited in line, received my order & ate, I needed to get back in line to place a to-go for my cousin. One of the workers recognized me from earlier and asked what I needed. When I told her I just wanted to order a Chicken & Waffle sandwich to-go she exclaimed "Oh no, once you wait in line for Bruxie, we don't want you waiting again the same visit! Come with me & I'll take your order for you." I was like, "Whaaa?!" I was able to bypass the line of about 15 people! Seriously, she was so sweet and I love that it's their policy to "never wait in line twice". All you have to do is approach one of their workers & let them know you want to order again :) In addition, Bruxie has added some stand-up tables and have even installed water misters! To add to our awesome experience earlier, the Pastrami Waffle sandwich & Chocolate Covered Banana shake I ordered were DELISH! Well-deserved 5 stars, Bruxie :)

I want to like you - but you won't let me. 蔛o I won't like you. So my last review dealt with a gross sanitary issue - this does as well. 蔒y friend saw the huge line and asked about it - after I gave the rundown he wanted to check it out. 蔠e ordered and while waiting for our food, I happened to catch the runner rubbing his fingers all over the plastic forks he was about to put into an order (see posted picture). 蔜hen I watched the runner put the forks in the Irish nachos and delivery them to a table. 蔒y line stands from my previous review - I understand this goes on at many other places and we just don't see it because it's hidden in the back. 蔜hat being said, since there is no back, Bruxie needs to make a better effort with controlling these types of issues. 蔍'll bet if people stopped looking at the menu and just watched the food runners, they'd see the same thing that I saw. Aside from that, the food was good. 蔍 wouldn't rave about it or go out of my way for it, but it was good. 蔜he fried chicken had a good flavor and their waffle fries are always tasty. 蔍 really don't think I'll be back - it's just getting too nasty.

What the hell-icopter! Bruxie where have you been all my life?! I am a huge fan of this little but poppin' joint. 蔄mazing service. Really great set-up. The guy that went through the line taking our order while we waited to pay at the window was extremely nice and helpful. He helped us choose a chocolate covered banana shake and a strawberry cheesecake waffle dessert to go. Lets just say that if that shake was on a richter scale it'd be like a 7.9 (no disrespect Japan). It was soooo good. The best shake I've ever had maybe. The perfect combo of chocolate and banana. The strawberry cheesecake was delectable as well with real strawberries and an absolutely delish toasted waffle crust. Although I did not try the more daring meat items on the menu, I'd have to say that I prefer Bruxie over any Eggo wannabes you might find at a certain chicken and waffles place that will remain nameless... Well done Bruxie. Well done. And my apologies for not making this review shorter and sweeter much like your fine establishment.

I'm going to keep this short and sweet b/c you have 1000+ reviews to sift through! This place may have been overhyped for me, because I was not crazy impressed. Get the Buttermilk fried chicken and waffle. Waffle could have been a bit more crisp to give the sandwich better texture. The fried chicken was perfectly seasoned and the dab of honey on the chicken was a great touch. Skip the braised beef short rib. That sandwich was bland, bland, bland even with the fries and caramelized onion. It came with a dipping sauce that didn't have any flavor other than salty. Overall, this place was good if you're in the area, but I wouldn't make the trip from LA just to try it.

Randomly found this on YELP while looking for a snack nearby the wedding we just attended. Good thing I found it cause..YUM! Never had chicken and waffles and not sure if this is comparable to Roscoe's but I have to say, the play of sweet and savory is definitely clutch. The waffles were cooked perfectly and that crunch is on the money! Also tried the Creme brulee waffle and that literally opened my eyes wider as the taste strictly mimicked..what else..Creme Brulee! Super happy too! About 7$ each..line was long but went by pretty quick...and we were able to snag a table so great experience all together =)

Green eggs and ham waffle sandwich! I was like "NO WAY" I need this waffle pronto! I seriously wanted to try every waffle sandwich, like the creme brulee one and the fried chicken one but I couldn't stray away from the green eggs and ham. I mean come on! My childhood book stuck in between a light fluffy, somewhat greasy waffle. Who can say no to that right! Pesto sauce on eggs and ham, mmmmmmhhhhh so gooooooooddddd. I can't wait to go back and try their other waffles sandwiches. I also got the Belgian hot chocolate but honestly it just tasted like ordinary hot chocolate. So skip it but try everything else :)

Went around noon on a Saturday and the line was already out to the parking lot but the super friendly staff was there handing out menus and were very attentive to see if we had any questions. I ordered the Fried Chicken Waffle + the maple syrup for an additional $1 and the strawberry lemonade. Husband ordered the prosciutto and gruyere waffle and the mocha milkshake. Total came out to about $25 if my memory serves me correctly. We skipped on the fries thinking that it was enough food but the size of the food vs. the cost isn't so great as we soon found out once our food arrived. �The fried chicken fillet was all white breast meat and it was very moist. 蔍t had a honey glaze on it and some slaw. 蔍 realized that it was already flavorful enough that I really didn't need the maple syrup which made it too sweet. 蔜he prosciutto and gruyere cheese waffle was really very good also but very small and flat. 蔍 wished that they would add more meat and cheese in the "sandwich". The shake was absolutely the best! It was thick and creamy and not too sweet! 蔜he strawberry lemonade was a nice mix of sweet and sour. �Overall, we had a great experience at Bruxie (there's very limited seating but they do have counters where you can stand and eat) but if you're looking for a bang for your buck, this is NOT the place. 蔍 would rather consider it a gourmet waffle stand worth your money if you're in the mood to treat yourself to a very tasty treat!

Just ate here by my lonesome today, and I thought it was pretty good. 蔊ot the bruxie burger. 蔜he waffle was light, not burned, not too crunchy and melded well with my burger with cheddar, a thin sliced pickle, lettuce, and mayo. 蔍 enjoyed it. 蔍t did seem a little pricey though, because that little burger and a coke cost me $11 (+tax). 蔄nyhow, next time I'll ask for free water. 蔜he burger was $7 and the coke was $2.50. 蔍 guess I'm just stingy though. �They have dog biscuits at the counter, so if you have a well-behaved pup, he can sit with you in their outside seating. 蔜he thing that was nice was that it was a little drizzly today and they had their heat lamps on and a little plastic tent covering the seats. 蔖retty nice.

Minus one star for the price and how the sandwiches do not fill me up, everything else..... salls good in the neighborhood. I got the fried chicken waffle and it tasted really good and surprisingly not greasy. Warning- I don't know if it's just me but after I was done eating I guess the waffle scratched up the inside of my mouth a bit, but again, my mouth always gets scratched up even after eating captn crunch -.-

It's so good! 蔐ocation is great (Old Towne Orange) though parking can sometimes suck when it's crowded. �I'm a vegetarian so the choices are limited for me but when I did try the Roasted Mushroom & Goat Cheese, I was in heaven! 蔍 could see why it gets the hype. 蔜he waffle batter is really light so it gives great texture as I'm eating all the mushroom and arugula! 蔜he fries are great too :) The other one I've tried is the Seasonal Creme Brulee (Strawberry) and Buddha, that was heaven! 蔍 loved it definitely and the saddest part was when it was all gone! �(

I heard a couple of coworkers rave about it, so thought it would be worth a try. 蔐ooked at the online menu and thought it was overpriced and nothing we couldn't make on our own with our trusty waffle iron. 蔐ooked at the pictures on Yelp and our interest was piqued again. 蔠e braved the cold and rain and made it out there and it was worth it. The fried chicken sandwich was heavenly. 蔉lavor was nice, texture of the waffle just right. 蔜he sweetness of the spicy honey and slaw was wonderful. 蔜he creme brulee was just the right proportions of custard, caramelized sugar and strawberries. 蔜he workers were cool, friendly and vibe of the place was great. 蔠e actually spent the rest of the afternoon contemplating whether or not we wanted to go back the same day.

I've always wanted to dine here seeing it's always so crowded with people when I passed by it. My co-workers, fiance and I made it to dine here on a Friday. 蔛ince pastrami was on the special menu and I like a good pastrami so decided to get the pastrami instead of its regular fried chicken. 蔛everal people told me it's a bit dried since it's basically deep fried chicken breast and I'm usually not a chicken fan. Other items include: Smoked salmon & dill with cream cheese Strawberry cheesecake Waffle fries black cherry soda Verdict: Hot Pastrami was a bit too salty. Smoked salmon & dill with cream cheese would have been good if only they didn't skimp on the cream cheese, hence made it a bit bland. 蔄nother friend got the same thing but his smoked salmon & dill had way too much cream cheese. 蔛o, it can be inconsistent. Strawberry cheesecake was pretty tasty. 蔍t would have more heavenly if the strawberry were fresh! One of my co-workers ordered the Irish Nacho fries, which is waffle fries smothered with bacon and cheese. 蔜his was tasty!! 蔜he waffle fries were very tasty so made it very good! The best items in my opinion are the black cherry soda and the waffle fries!! You gotta try the soda at least once!! 蔕verall, the dessert waffle is pretty good but not sure about the sandwich idea. 蔍t's good to try it and be your own judge!

I've come to Bruxie twice. It's good. 蔅ut I don't see the hype. My first time, I ordered the Ogura, a sweet selection of waffle with Japanese red bean (azuki) and lemony sweet creme. 蔍t was good, but I didn't like the lemony-ness taking away from the taste of the red bean. 蔜he waffle was fluffy, soft, and slightly crispy on the outside. �So I came back, this time ordering a fried chicken and waffle. 蔋aving eaten at a lot of southern food, I didn't have high hopes for a good fried chicken. 蔍t was underseasoned, but with the butter and honey was good, and even better with dashes of hot sauce. �Seating (and the line) is very hit and miss. 蔜here's basically only one window to order from. 蔍 guess I've been lucky to not have to wait very long.

I've been to Bruxie on a few occasions, and I feel like they're getting better and better. The concept of this restaurant is so brilliant and delightful, I'd be surprised if they weren't planning on opening up another location somewhere closer to LA. The first time I came here I spent about $40 haha. I hope to try every waffle they have!! These are the few that I have tried: **** Buttermilk Fried Chicken - I wanted to LOVE this. But being a Long Beach girl... Roscoe's still does it better. There is something about the chicken that didn't 100% hit it for me. Still a great sandwich, but doesn't compare to Roscoe's with a side of mac. **** Bruxie Burger - This is my go-to waffle. I love a good burger. They make their's medium which is perfect. I always forget to ask for extra mayo. **** Hot Pastrami - This was great... I kept thinking how much my dad would love it. Definitely a dad-sandwich. **** Lemon Cream & Berries - By far the best dessert waffle. Even though I've never tried any of the other ones. Perfect combination of tartness, sweetness, and savoriness of the waffle. Obviously I've had the waffle fries, and can I just say, I am the ultimate french fry lover, and these are probably my favorite fries. It kills me that they are waffle fries, because let's face it, nothing beats good old fashioned french fires. But, I don't know... Bruxie's waffle fries are just perfect. I've also had one of their old fashioned colas, which was just okay for me. Their lemonade was also just okay for me- it was too sweet for my liking. The soft serve custard was really great and I'd get it again. Today, I finally tried their date shake, which I was ecstatic about because I'm in love with dates and it fills me with joy when I find new recipes I can use them in. But the shake was very, very thick and a little too sweet for me (topped with caramel). I was afraid it was going to be too intense and it was. I need to drink like a tablespoon at a time. Still workin on it. Other waffles to get excited about (at least I am): ** Roasted Mushroom & Goat Cheese ** Carolina BBQ Pulled Pork (special) ** Braised Beef Short Ribs - omfg I can't believe I STILL haven't had this (special) ** Green Eggs & Ham (special) ** Prosciutto Hash & Eggs Bruxie (special) ** S'Mores - aaggghhhh! Anyway, here is a list of additional reasons why Bruxie is thee best: 1) Casual food with quality ingredients - 蔎ust because you're outside eating with your hands, doesn't mean you should skimp on the quality of the food. Everything's always fresh and made to order. With a wide array of choices! But not too wide! 2) High end without pretentiousness or high prices - Prices are pretty affordable. Service is always great, and very efficient. The management has it all figured out and the employees execute it to a T. Also, the crowd that comes out are all just as excited as the employees to be there. Everyone is appreciative of the effort. 3) Atmosphere is perfect - I love that Bruxie is just a small shack with outdoor seating. It gives it almost like a street-food type of vibe. It is in the perfect little location in a cute little neighborhood (I always drive through that downtown area on Glassell) and it's across the street from Chapman which is a gorgeous campus. 4) Somewhat seasonal - I love that they have weekly and daily specials, making sandwiches according to what is available. I think it's important to mix it up and offer customers something different and special. 5) Business you can trust - I'm not from Orange, but when I'm there I definitely see it as one of those local businesses that I respect and trust. I also love that they serve Peets Coffee & Tea. Totally love it when quality businesses collaborate together. In conclusion, Bruxie is something you MUST try for true foodies. A part of me is dying waiting for them to open another location closer to Long Beach, possibly in LA. But another part of me is glad I have to drive all the way to Orange to enjoy so I won't EAT THERE EVERY DAY FOR THE REST OF MY LIFE. If I open up my own place one day, I'd imagine it'd be something a lot like Bruxie. Good food, good atmosphere, and good people!

This is one of my favorite places to grab a quick, delicious meal in the OC. I first came here because I was intrigued by this unique approach to the sandwich. I've never been a huge fan of sandwiches as they can get a little boring. But fold delicious ingredients into a waffle (and a very, very delicious waffle no less...crispy on the outside, light and fluffy on the inside...mmm mmm!) and that is irresistible. I have yet to order an item I dislike. The burger is yummy, as are the fried chicken, the pastrami, the short rib, the pulled pork, the prosciutto and gruyere, and even the, seemingly plain, cheesy bruxie is good (I get mine with bacon and avocado). And that is just their savory menu! They have sweet concoctions as well. The waffle fries are seasoned nicely and are crispy. Also they have specially crafted sodas and are one of 2 places in the OC where you can get frozen custard. Yay Bruxie!

Came here with a few buds on a recommendation. Parking is not the easiest so be prepared to walk like a block or two if you're used to parking right in front of places. The place is obviously very popular and when I came, the line was already around one corner. Thinking it was going to take forever, we asked someone line how long they've been there and they said it was only a 15 minute wait. so COOL. however its only a 15 minute wait to get to the order window. Not the case waiting for the food later. It didn't take too long but i'd say from the back of the line to when we got the food was about 30 mins. I got the bruxie burger and it was pretty delish. The burger was most and clearly home made. None of that crazy frozen patty. Everything else in it was pretty normal though. Lettuce, tomatoes, onions, cheese, pickles. The waffle was light but didn't get all soggy or anything holding all the ingredients. Along w/ the burger we had fries and I had myself their cola. The cola was good and pretty different compared normal coke or anything like that but it hit the spot. Fries were just criss cut fries but were tasty still If I still lived in socal 'd come back once a week to try all the sandwiches. Guess I just gotta visit more.

FRIED CHICKEN & WAFFLE --my first try--better than I expected --crispier waffle than Roscoe's--which I just tried Cole slaw???--sounds so uncomplementary a topping --yet it enhances flavors & textures --making this sandwich distinct from Roscoe's FROZEN CUSTARD --consistently/deliciously creamy-good ARCHITECTURE --previously a corner burger stand--serving chow mein --with parking-lot seating --that would not attract passersby --except for the long line of anticipatory chicken-waffle vultures Deja vu Pink's--but this place delivers the goods

Nice! 蔍t's hard to find something unique these days... or at least before everyone else catches on, and the new food becomes viral (boba, froyo, crawdads, cupcakes, taco trucks...). 蔍t was refreshing to go somewhere and try something new that I hadn't heard of yet nor had before. �They are officially called waffle sandwiches, where the waffle is the bread, but I like to compare this place more to like a crepe shop, with waffles instead of crepes. 蔜his seems to be a good analogy to me because the fillings you get at Bruxie are more crepe-like! 蔜hey have both savory and sweet waffle crepes. 蔛weet ones have 蔲illings like cinnamon sugar, lemon curd, nutella and bananas, and creme brulee. 蔜heir savory ones include fried chicken (of course), goat cheese mushroom arugula, and smoked salmon and dill. �Anyway, it's a great place to check out for something different! 蔙ecommend.

I seriously did not believe the hype until I went and tried this place. Bruxie is freaking BOMBBBBB. Located in Old Town Orange, on Glassell and Palm, you'll easily spot this small building due to the huge ass line of people waiting to order. 蔖arking is HORRIBLE in this area. 蔠hen I went with the best friend Katie N. and our other friend Rian A. for brunch one Sunday morning, we drove around for a good 20-30 minutes before we found a lot down the street and over some with an empty spot. 蔅ruxie is basically a stand with a few tables and a couple standing-only tables. When we got in line, there were a couple of servers walking up and down the line giving out menus so we could look at what we could order. There was also someone carrying a chalkboard with specials and suggestions written on it. They had a lotttt to choose from. The three of us seriously just stood there because we couldn't decide between savory or sweet meals. Lucky for us, there was a long line and so we had time to decide on what we wanted. We ultimately ended up ordering the following: Me: - Bruxie Burger_$6.95 - an angus beef patty with cheddar cheese, sliced tomatoes, pickles, mayo and crisp lettuce (I opted for no pickles) - old fashion pure cane sugar root beer soda_$2.50 Katie N.: - Buttermilk Fried Chicken & Waffle_$6.95 - what the title says with chili honey and cole slaw, but she asked for no cole slaw (she wishes she got the 100% pure maple syrup for an extra $1 though) Rian A.: - Smoked Salmon & Dill Cream Cheese_$7.95 - what the title says with herb cream cheese, cucumbers and chives - waffle fries_$2.95 We all got something different so we could try each others. Everything is fresh and made after you order. We managed to find a standing-only table so we could eat there and since it was a nice day out, we didn't mind. My meal was pretty big, not gonna lie (*insert "that's what she said" joke here*). I definitely loved it. The waffle was hot and crispy and blended amazingly well with the ketchup. While we ate, we people watched, enjoying the Sunday afternoon. Overall, my friends and I enjoyed our meals. Service is really good and the prices are pretty cheap. My only real beef with this place is that it's always busy and that there's nooooo parking in the area. Plus, they sortaaa skimped on the waffle fries, so that's a bummer, but I wouldn't mind coming back here to try something else off the menu. I think if I ate before coming here, I'd only get something off of the sweet part of the menu or get a dairy "treet."

Not sure what I can add that 1,400 reviewers already haven't -- other than I, too, am now a Bruxie Zombie. Yes, I am now one of the thousands of undead hordes lined up and shambling toward my fix of fried chicken breasts, Nutella and bananas, and even cheeseburgers nestled in a fluffy pillow of waffley goodness. Sure, it's 1,000 degrees outside, but who cares? Sun stroke is for wusses. I'm here to eat my waffle sandwich, goddammit, and I'll chew through your arm to get one. I've become one of the mindless minions who've succumbed to Bruxie's irresistible siren song, and I can't. Stop. Eating them. Doubt me? One bite and you, too, will join the legions of the damned -- just like me and countless other poor souls. And you won't even know it until it's too late. George Romero would be proud.

Good if you're looking to eat something different but I don't know, I feel like it didn't live up to the hype. I saw smoked salmon and I ordered it, cause well, I love smoked salmon. But something about the dill cream cheese just made it less enjoyable. Irish nachos were good, but they got kind of meh after a while as well. Maybe just not enough toppings or sauce or something. Their soda, though, with the sugar cane, 蕐um! Also, I like to sit when I eat. So I'll probably come back here if my friends are feeling like it? Otherwise if I've got a Bruxie craving, I'll head to the Birch location.

Oh Bruxie, you and me, we could have had something but alas, I'm pretty sure you're just a summer fling. The pros: Creme Brulee' waffle. Ooooh Emmmm Geeee! Don't get mad, but I'd kill you for one of those things. Like for reals, foodgasm. The mehs: It's in Orange. Parking sucks. Traffic sucks. Limited outdoor seating. I feel like it was really pricey for what it was. $7 or more for a waffle sammich. Given, it was amazing, but if you want an entree sammich, and a dessert sammich, and an ice tea, it's like $16, which for a lean-to ish waffle stand seems a little steep to me. 蔖lus, if you want fries or syrup, it's extra.

"Bruxie restaurant, best believe the hype is real!" - Eminem In all seriousness though, this place delivers. I'll just add my $.02 to the plethora of reviews for this spot already. Hash + egg waffle = A+ (big portion of the hash/meat/potatoes/nicely cooked egg in the middle. There was also a piece of melted cheese in between the crispy/airy/soft waffle) Salmon + cream cheese = B (nice smoked salmon slices and cream cheese that was infused with some type of herb. It didn't stand out too much but still complimented well with the waffle) Waffle fries = B+ (I was expecting something like Carls Jr waffle fries but this was much more crispy and well seasoned) Customer service = A+ (there were workers outside who were more than happy to answer questions/help out with the menu. It was also nice to put a name to their face since they told you who they were) Sriracha bottle/dispenser of Heinz ketchup definitely put Bruxie in a special place within my heart. I absolutely LOVE mixing ketchup + sriracha for the ultimate condiment for fried foods. It's so awesome that they offer sriracha! I will be here again with my gf when I feel like indulging and not giving a f*!k about my diet. :D

Don't be fooled by the hype...this place is LEGIT. I finally had a chance to knock this off my bookmark list over the weekend. Because it was my first time, I figured I'd get the most-mentioned flagship product, the buttermilk fried chicken and waffle sandwich. Holy crap is that thing delicious! The chicken was perfectly moist, and it's served with some sort of chili honey sauce and cole slaw. Such an unexpected combination comes together perfectly and you can't believe how good it is! I almost never eat breakfast, but I'm dreaming about that waffle sandwich 24 hours later...a sure sign of a 5-star place for me. I also went ahead and got their frozen custard...incredibly creamy soft-serve! The strawberry lemonade is incredibly refreshing, especially on a sunny SoCal day. The line outside this stand at 10:30am was intimidating. But the table turnover is pretty quick, and we had no trouble finding a place to sit/stand once we had ordered.

Damn you Bruxie, you've ruined it for me! 蔍 can never eat another fried chicken sandwich again and expect it to be as good as the succulent as the one I just had at your fine establishment. 蔒y lunch buddy and I split a prosciutto and gruyere as well as the fried chicken. 蔍 thought the prosciutto was good, though a little light on the fillings, nothing really to write home about, especially at almost $8 bucks. 蔍t had a little brown mustard and chives inside with it. 蔔ice combo as I am a fan of prosciutto and gruyere, but will make it at home next time! �蔜he chicken however, was definitely an experience to enjoy. 蔍t had all the elements I appreciate in a sandwich: 蔭 waffle that was just nicely crisp around the edges, and nicely fried chicken on the inside. 蔜he chili honey gave it just the right amount of sweet to go with the crisp. 蔜he server suggested sriracha sauce with it, which is just what the sandwich needed for that extra spicy kick to go with the sweet. 蔍 loved it! �It was definitely the wow out of the two. 蔍 had a lemonade as well that was pretty good, but I didn't pay that much attention to it compared to the sandwiches. �The area is really cute, great place on a sunny day. 蔖arking wasn't bad. 蔍'll return to take my best friend here when she's in town. 蔍t's a bit of a trek for me so would need to return when I have someone with me to partake in the other goodies on the menu. 蔜he prices are a little steep for what you get, but not terrible. 蔍 used to love the spicy chicken sandwich at Chik-Fil-A...and probably still do...but Bruxie has taken spicy fried chicken sandwiches 蕋o a new level for me! 蔒aybe a little apple to orange comparison, but you might find me putting honey and sriracha on all my fried chicken from now on.

Fighting off the Chapman students, I was able to finally get my pulled pork waffle and belgian chocolate shake. I waited in line for a $4 shake?! Yes, and I have to admit it was well worth it. The shake was one of the best I've had with all the thickness and creaminess. The chocolate flavor was so rich and gave me notes of satisfaction with each taste. I slurped it all down to the whipped cream and chocolate flakes. The waffle sandwich was not bad as well. The staff is also very friendly.

I've been here twice now and both times were delicious. It's a small hut that you order from and they have a small patio area where you can eat the food. It's on Glassell over by Chapman. There is generally a line, but it moves quickly. The staff there is always very friendly Unfortunately due to building restrictions, there isn't a restroom and the dining area is somewhat small, but most people are respectful of that and leave once they're done eating. Both times I went with the gf and we got two savory sandwiches, an order of fries, a sweet sandwich, and two drinks. Admittedly that's probably more food than what's needed. I think we could have split a savory and have been fine. Prices are generally $6-8 a sandwich. I've now tried: Fries: Very good waffle fries Savory: Buttermilk Fried Chicken & Waffles -Good, the honey/chili sauce that goes on it is quite tasty Prosciutto & Gruyere -Amazing, like a delicious grilled cheese with a bit of prosciutto to add to it Smoked Salmon & Dill Cream Cheese -Good, tasty Reuben (Seasonal) -Very good, but extremely hearty/filling, a bit oily though Lobster roll (Promotional) -They had this one for the Super Bowl (they also had a NY steak sandwich). It was enjoyable. Lots of lobster, could have used a bit more sauce though. Worth noting that it was twice as expensive. �Sweet: Ogura Bruxie -Good, gf liked it a lot, but I'm not the biggest fan of red bean Nutella & Bananas -Also incredible, the Nutella, sweet cream, and layer of banana go great with the waffle Smore Bruxie -Rather tasty as well The food really is quite delicious, with so many good things on the menu I encourage you to go with at least one other person so that you can share and get a taste of everytying.

I've heard of chicken and waffles but who knew you can make other varieties of sandwiches with different combinations of meat and even dessert!! 蔍've been here a couple of times and my ultimate sandwich that I think is pretty amazing is the carolina's pulled pork. 蔛ad that this is only a special so they only have it sometimes. 蔍f it was a regular on the menu, I'd definitely come back but the other times I've been here, it was not on the menu. 蔒y friend ordered the chicken one and I thought that this was just okay. 蔜he slaw didn't do it for me. 蔍t was kind of runny. 蔜he smoked salmon and dill cream one is pretty awesome as well. 蔊reat flavor combination of the salmon and dill cream!! 蔒ake sure you save room because the strawberry creme br瀕巈 is out of this world!! 蔍t is very sweet and I probably could've eaten the whole thing. 蔍'd come back just for dessert! 蔍t is pretty pricy but a definite try at least once!!

I honestly don't want to hype this place up for any first-timers like myself, but I can't help it... THIS PLACE IS EFFING DELICIOUS! My good friend, Tiffany W., and I happened to be in the area so we decided to pay Bruxie a well deserved visit. Parking was limited, but luckily, we were able to nab a spot in their tiny three-car-maximum parking lot. Tiff and I heavily rely on fellow Yelpers' Review Highlights, so we undoubtedly went with the Buttermilk Fried Chicken & Waffle and the Strawberry Creme Brulee. We split the waffles which I HIGHLY suggest you do because the two compliment each other extremely well. Make sure you eat the Buttermilk Fried Chicken first! The first bite of your sweet Strawberry Creme Brulee Waffle tastes even more heavenly after you finish your savory, not overly salty Buttermilk Fried Chicken & 蔠affle. I wish I tried some of their drinks, but don't worry Bruxie, I shall return!!

I had been waiting to try this place for months! The staff was definitely friendly and helpful. Especially for those of us who had never been here before. If you're not a gourmet cheese type of person, there isn't much for you here. With my lack of options, I decided to go with the safe choice and went for the burger. The meat was definitely of quality although lacked flavor. Be prepared to eat a pretty rare slab of meat if you order the burger. With everything piled on top of each other, you can see the oil pooling in the little squares of the waffle. After eating about 1/4 of the burger, the taste quickly got old and I lost all desire to finish the meal in front of me. Not only did the burger lack flavor but it could have simply used some sort of condiment which it lacked as well. The pickles are amazing though! The experience definitely didn't meet my anticipation expectations. It could very well be due to the fact that I had finally tried Bruxie's after months of waiting. Maybe I was expecting more, but then again, a place with this many reviews, I would have expected more anyway.

I was dying for some fried chicken so it was a tie between Bruxie or Roscoes. So we headed for Bruxie. Bruxie is actually a waffle stand. As we approached, a staff explained the menu to us and gave her recommendations. We went for the chicken and waffles and a rootbeer float for me. The fried chicken here is actually sandwiched between the waffles with some slaw and a good drizzle of chili honey. As promised the waffle was crispy and light, and while the flavor of the chicken wasn't what I was looking for, it was moist, crispy and flavorful. Even when it was dinner time there were still seats available,but parking could be a challenge.

After hearing so many positive review we split a salmon and basalmic mushroom. 蔣ou know whenever you go to a new place at least one item needs to be deleted from the menu and in this case it's the salmon. It was just too greasy, so much so that your could barely taste the lox. Yup, no fresh salmon here. The other sandwich we tried with basalmic mushrooms? Actually pretty good. Maybe better it they added a little more garlic and onion and again less grease. Last item we tried: Date shake. Not good. Love the concept but to add caramel, whipped cream, more cream, sugar, 蔴oney... it just takes away from the pure flavor or dates blended with whole milk. Best thing about this place is the sandwich concierge. He's a sweetheart.

I had been dying to try Bruxie!!! I was so excited!! I love the concept and think it's so out of the box. A great way to turn the gross chicken n waffles into gourmet. I opted for the salmon lox waffle and my sister had some crazy meat concoction. LOL No she ordered the "bacon cheeseburger" one. I thought the salmon lox was delicious, it had a wonderful fresh flavor. My sister loved her bacon burger too! I really want to go back to try one of their sweet desserts, but definitely need to go and share! My only issue is that I though they were a little overpriced, but they have found their niche, so people will pay.

This place is really a 4-star spot but it's very overpriced, and it's losing a star for that. If you go, try a shake, the shakes are really good. They're made with Wisconsin custard!! I recommend the strawberry, or the date shake when it's in season. I tried the Black Cow Float, and wasn't a fan. As for the waffles, they're pretty good, but 蕂verhyped. Not a bad place though, and worth stopping if you're in the area.

It was a novel idea with great promise but ended up being average... if that. Sandwiches were small and then you're charged extra for syrup amongst others? I had the buttermilk fried chicken and my chicken was dry and bland. What happened to all the flavor? Tasted like it came from the frozen section of costco. The waffle was a bit soggy and I missed the delicious crisp I've grown accustomed to in a waffle. If I'm ever back, it'll because a friend wanted to have a taste and I got dragged along. Sorry bruxie. :(

1-2 years ago, I loved the texture of the waffles. They were thick, soft inside, and crispy outside...Belgium. However, the recipe/cooking quality MIGHT HAVE changed. It was no longer the texture I fell in love with. The waffle was hard and overdone. The fried chicken was flat, no longer big and juicy as I remembered it. I'm hoping it was just bad timing and they overcooked my order. I will still give them 4/5 stars for their service and presumed quality of waffles and chicken.

Finally! 蔜his is how you should eat chicken and waffle... like a sandwich! 蔠hen I go to Roscoe's, you eat the chicken and waffle separately. 蔕r you try to eat it together, but the two flavors in your mouth does not blend together into one amazing flavor. Bruxie's Chicken and waffle unites the taste of chicken and the taste of waffle into one amazing flavor in your mouth! �The creme brulee waffle sandwich was really good too!

This was our first stop on our food adventure. I was glad there wasn't much of a line when we came here. I was expecting a sit down restaurant, but I liked sitting outside and people watching. Of course I had to have the chicken and waffles- what 蔭 perfect combo! I was still hungry, but it did it's job for the time being...one of the workers checked up on us and was really nice.

This place is A-Ok, it's more of a tasty waffle place than a dessert place. I found this joint, in attempts to replace Bloem 'n Sugar in SF. Although, they've got an array of treats to choose from and tend to have long lines, I don't think it's as sweet as I hoped it would be. Their staff can be a hit or miss. They take care of their customers in the line quite well by making certain they know what they're going to order. But sometimes, the people at the registers are too stressed out and don't seem as friendly. Nonetheless, it doesn't phase me that much as long as the order is taken down correctly. Parking can get difficult here since it's in a suburban-ish neighborhood though.

I went here about a month ago on black friday and I can't wait to go back! There wasn't a line and luckily I found parking in fairly quick. So what you do when you get there is order at the window and sit down and they'll bring the food to you. The people there were really nice and friendly. My friend and I both got the chicken and waffle sandwich! The sauce in the sandwich was kinda like asian zing (from buffalo wild wings) surprisingly but it complimented chicken. We also shared a creme br瀕巈 which was to die for! The best thing about this place is that their waffles aren't soggy, it's crispy but soft on the inside which is the 蔱pitome of the perfect fucking waffle! I DEFINITELY RECOMMEND THIS PLACE-- MUST TRY if you haven't already! :) oh and i live about 40 minutes from this place.. but the drive is worth it!

This place gets so many rave reviews that I couldn't stop myself from going back. Duke D. and I decided that we'd spent a day antique shopping in Old Towne Orange so lunch just had to be had at Bruxie since he'd never been there. I remembered the sandwiches just being good food regardless of the waffles, and I had yet to try a dessert there; off we went to see what the season's special was and to get some good eats. I highly encouraged the sodas because they are made with pure cane sugar. The one they had up as a special was grape which I was excited about since I love grape soda. It was pure deliciousness. Great, great soda. For some reason, I also really like how they use small ice cubes. Duke D. went with the buttermilk fried chicken sandwich upon my suggestion. He really enjoyed it. It is definitely a sandwich that one has to eat with knife and fork though lest there be a mess everywhere. The piece of chicken was huge and very moist on the inside. Who doesn't love a well-fried juicy piece of chicken breast on a crispy waffle? I decided to opt for the prosciutto and gruyere sandwich, and oh my my, it is now my favorite there from all that I've tasted before. The saltiness of the prosciutto and gruyere combined was fantastic and left a lingering tastiness in my mouth. At first I thought that was all there was - that it was simple and great with just a few ingredients. However, as I got closer to the center, I discovered chives and mustard seed. Wow. Great thinking there. My compliments to the chef for a mindblowing combo. I wouldn't have thought to add those to such a sandwich but they just really made it all the more epic. It will be my default sandwich now. Because my friend had always raved about their strawberry cr弇e br瀕巈, we decided to finish off our delectable meal with that. While it was good, I actually didn't find it as crazily awesome as the hype made it out to be. It was definitely full of good cr弇e br瀕巈 but I didn't feel like that dessert necessarily belonged in a waffle. The waffle ended up making it a heavier dessert than I would have preferred, and the strawberries were barely present. Good concept but not to my taste.

Friend of mine was craving waffles so I searched "waffles" on yelp and this gem popped up. 蔄fter a quick glance I saw chicken and waffles in the same sentence and I thought I'M SOLD, so we made the short drive over, not knowing what to expect. 蔄s we walked up, we were greeted by the friendliest middle aged lady who handed us a menu and chatted with us for a few minutes. 蔈verybody here is so nice! We had the strawberry creme brulee, chicken and waffles, and nutella banana. 蔍 don't have much of a sweet tooth, so I wasn't too into the 2 dessert waffles (though they were absolutely delicious), but I must say the chicken and waffles sandwich was awesome! 蔍t was the perfect combination of savory and a little bit of sweet in the maple syrup-like sauce they drizzled on the chicken. �On a second visit, I had the prosciutto and gruyere and the asian redbean waffle. 蔍 brought a different friend this time and he had the chicken and waffle on my recommendation. 蔜he prosciutto and gruyere waffle wasn't as good as the chicken waffle to be honest. 蔅ut the redbean waffle was PERFECT. 蔐ike I mentioned before I'm not much of a sweettooth so some of the dessert waffles were a bit too sweet for me, but this one was just right. On my third and fourth visits, I had the chicken waffle and redbean each time because as the old saying goes ...if it ain't broke why fix it. �For the record, my friend whom I brought the second time went back that night with his wife for dinner, then again the next day, and again a few days later. 蔍 guess he likes the place too.

After having this place bookmarked for a SUPER long time, I finally tried it out. Overall rating 3.5 but I just couldn't give them a 4 star rating... Don't get me wrong. The food is good but would I be craving for it? not really... I ordered the Chicken and Waffles. Luckily when we got there the line wasn't that long. It did get longer while we were waiting for our food. The thing I don't like about it is that this place is probably always busy and they don't have enough tables. It would have been better if it was a restaurant. The waffles were crispy and good. Chicken was tender but I wouldn't say it was the BEST chicken and waffles I ever had. They also charge you for syrup if you want some with your chicken and waffles which I thought was ridiculous... It was $1!! WTF?? serious? you REALLY need to charge $1 for syrup... Sorry Yelp, but I guess I had too high expectations for this place.

I had never heard of this place but my friends called me and said "hey, go with us to get waffles!", and I said "ok!" because who doesn't like a waffle? Yeah, it was a lot different than I expected... but in a fantastic way! A waffle sandwich totally perplexed me, but luckily one of the workers took pity on my bewildered face and gave me some of her personal recommendations from the menu. I liked that! I was still uncertain about the concept until my food came. First, nowhere near as messy as I had envisioned it. 蔍 think waffle just dethroned bread as best choice for a sandwich" bun. Not only was it tasty, it was sturdy enough to hold the toppings and not be a soggy mess. That had been my greatest fear and it was quickly put to rest. On the pro status worker's recommendation, I tried their seasonal sandwich, Green Eggs & Ham. It's a fried egg, cheese, ham, and a pesto sauce. Perfect ratio on the sauce. You get the flavor, but it doesn't overpower the whole sandwich. My friends and i also ventured into the "sweet" side of the menu to try the Creme Brulee/Strawberries and the Banana/Nutella/Sweet Cream. Both yummy, but I definitely prefer the nutella and bananas by virtue of that sweet cream. Anyway parking around there can be pretty annoying and all of their tables/stands our outside. But who cares? Go eat here!

I hope I'm not jumping the gun, but Bruxie definitely deserves my 5 stars! Came here on a whim when we missed the closing time for Anepalco's (chilaquiles!). It was close by and pretty easy to find. We parked a couple streets down (where the Perfect Circle Cupcakery is) and walked over. I love the area, it has such a hometown feel. The place itself is quite small but very adorable. I can see how you have to fight for seats at peak hours. They even had those water mists going to cool you off in the hot heat! Awesome (and thoughtful!) idea, but I hope the water's clean since it gets all up in your food while you're eating :P The servers here are suuper friendly and highly highly recommended the pulled pork sandwich, so we decided to go with the Carolina BBQ Pulled Pork ($7.95) and the Strawberry Creme Brulee (both seasonal items). Wow, so did not regret our choices! The minute they brought this out to our table, I was amazed. The strawberry creme brulee ($4.95) is a great portion for the price and it is dang delicious. It comes with a creamy custard with bits of caramelized sugar and sweet sweet strawberries. I'm a messy eater so the sweet cream kept squishing out when I took a bite, but it was so good I couldn't just leave it there! I scooped it all up and back in my mouth it went! Mmm, lip smacking delicious. The waffle itself is nice and crispy, providing a great crunch with every bite. Not soggy in the least! Nam didn't know what to expect with these waffle sandwiches, but he was very pleasantly surprised with the pulled pork. It was every bit as good as they made it out to be. It comes with some cole slaw sitting on a bed of a juicy flavorful pulled pork, along with a side of tangy sauce and pickle that adds the perfect crunch! We added some sriracha too which was such an excellent idea, I'm surprised I never thought of adding sriracha to BBQ before! Again, the waffle itself was perfect, not too soft or soggy, but just the right amount of crispness to make the whole thing come together. We walked away super happy and satisfied. I can't wait to come back and try the rest of the menu. I admit the sandwiches are a bit pricey (except the strawberry creme brulee :P) but they are so worth every bite. Yatta for Bruxie!

I came with too high expectations, it was only OK. I tried the roasted mushroom & goat cheese and smoked salmon one, and they were both alright. Smoked salmon was plain tasting, roasted mushroom was more flavorful but too salty, I wouldn't order them again. The dessert was definitely good though, I tried the seasonal favorite, I forget the name but it had strawberries in it. Next time I'd probably focus my attention on the desserts.

Bruxie lives up to any hype I have heard. In fact, my expectations were exceeded by the delicious waffle sandwiches and waffle fries. Going on a weekday, we found a long line that was moving at a good pace. This is an outdoor setting and we were lucky to get a table right after we ordered. The staff here was friendly, accommodating and pretty fast considering the constant arrival of customers. I tried the pastrami sandwich, a special listed near the front of the line. This was even better than what I sampled from the chicken sandwich my husband ordered, in my opinion. The waffle used in the sandwich is made on the spot, soft and not a sweet waffle and it goes perfectly with the meat. This is a very indulgent and satisfying meal. We tried the waffle fries, which are seasoned with salt and pepper. They are so good but the next time I visit, I am planning to stick to the sandwich only. Peet's Coffees and teas are served here. When we visited, they also had strawberry lemonade. Parking can be crowded and I believe some of the streets in the vicinity are permit only. A good option can be to park at Chapman University, which is across the street.

I can't believe I live so close to this place and I had never been until a month ago! After the first time, I went 3 times in one week. I just had too. I had to bring everyone close to me to try this place. Who would of thought that waffle sandwiches would be so freaking delicious! THE FOOD: The first time I came here I tried the Prosciutto and Gruyere and the Creme Brulee with fresh strawberries. I couldn't believe what my taste buds were experiencing. When I came back and brought my brothers and my boyfriend we ended up trying EVERYTHING (chicken and waffles, short rib sandwich, turkey club, nutella and bananas, etc) on the menu and there was not one single thing that was disappointing. Even the plain waffles with syrup are exceptional. It's like they sprinkle crack on the food before they serve it to you. They have daily specials they add which is a nice change up. I'm not a huge fan of soda but they make their sodas with real cane sugar and it makes a world of difference. It so good. THE SERVICE: The line can get pretty long but it's really not that bad and it's definitely worth the wait. They have misters for hot days and the staff walks down the line with menus and they take your order for you before you get to the window to speed up the process. The staff makes the experience that much more enjoyable. They are SO SO SO friendly, kind and upbeat. I love it. If you are with a group of 2 or more people I suggest that you have one person keep an eye out for open tables. That way someone can order the food and the other can go save your seat, if you don't want to stand and eat. Sooo...it's definitely not something you can eat everyday because of the calories content but it's a perfect treat! I will be back!!

After dress shopping with my girlfriend for her wedding, we decided to have lunch at Bruxie since we were in the area and I had it bookmarked for the longest time. After two appointments at the Bridal Boutiques we were drained and hungry (and I wasn't even the one trying on the dresses). I was so excited as we were in the car heading towards Old Town Orange, we were there on a weekday and parking was so hard to find. I circled the surrounding blocks one to two times but no luck, even the nearby parking lots were full; finally the third time around I was able to find one across the street from Bruxie. Without looking at the menu I already knew what I wanted to order because I was in a chicken kind of mood, my girlfriend on the other hand was just hungry in general and wasn't familiar with the menu and didn't know what to order, she ended getting two waffle sandwiches because she was in sweet and savory kind of mood- and this friend of mine is a size 2 kinda girl and she got two waffle sandwiches! I don't know where all those calories go :) We ordered: Buttermilk Fried Chicken and Waffle - $6.95 Prosciutto & Gruyere - $6.95 Fruit & Cream - $5.95 And I loved every bit of my sandwich! Each bite was so heavenly, the chicken was meaty and crispy, the chili honey and coleslaw that was topped over chicken gave it so much flavor and amazing texture; having it sandwiched between the waffles, oh goodness, words can't even describe how amazing the waffle batter taste like. If you haven't been to Bruxie, please take time out of your day to visit this food stand, it is definitely the mother-effin-business!

Have you ever thought that the employees of a restaurant had a lottery and decided to give the winner the best service and food ever? Have you ever felt that you were treated like part of the family restaurant? 蔍 felt that way about Bruxie today. 蔍 found a diamond in the rough! Ding ding ding. I went to Bruxie's today with my best friend since I've been hearing so much about their waffles. 蔅efore I went, I was thinking it was a Roscoe's knock off, but once I got there I couldn't have been more wrong. 蔉irst, the drive was a little slow going since it was in down town orange at noon. 蔐ots of cars and college students walking about. 蔜he people are pretty good looking...young students and college professors. �Anyhow, as I drove up, the first thing I noticed was that there was a line of people out to the sidewalk. 蔊ood sign for me since I didn't know what to expect. 蔍 found some parking behind the restaurant and as I walked to the window to look at the menu, I was greeted by some friendly food runners with a warm smile. 蔜hey seemed to be genuinely happy to be there. As I stood in line, I noticed one of the workers and decided to ask him what he recommended and what most people ordered. 蔞ery enthusiastically, he recommended the BBQ Pulled Pork and the Buttermilk Fried Chicken. 蔋e looked like he's had everything on the menu so I decided to go for it. 蔄s I waited in line, a smiling elderly lady chatted us up and asked us if it was our first time here. She went off on how much she loved the restaurant and told us she'd tried everything on the menu. 蔍 asked her if she worked there. I ordered the pulled pork sandwich and the fried chicken sandwich. 蔠hen I sat down, we waited about 15 minutes and one of the food runners asked us if we had received our food. 蔠hen we said no, the runner asked us if we wanted anything else. 蔍 guess they went over their time limit so she so generously gave us free fries and yogurt. The food was amazing! 蔜he waffles are very subtle and I couldn't really taste it but the pork was really tender and as i write this, my mouth is salivating. 蔣ou gotta go try it! 蔠hat was even more awesome is that the owner of the restaurant was actually standing in line helping customers. 蔋e went around asking all the patrons if everything was okay and to the best of my memory, that's the first time I've ever seen an owner do that. The passion, the service, and the quality of food is some of the best I've ever seen. 蔍f after reading this, you decide you want to go, hit me up! :)

we love this place. i found this place on yelp and the concept totally reminded me of roscoes so we made our way in...... this place is nothing like roscoes waffles! BUT bruxies waffles are certainly great and hold their own on the fluffy, light and crispy side and not too heavy at all. we opted for the cream cheese and salmon sandwich and wifey had the fried chicken waffle sandwich accompanied w/ their trademark crisscut fries.. we also tried one of their fresh ice cream milk shakes. be aware that this place gets packed. its across the street from chapman university and is only a block or 2 away from the orange circle. we love this place for their quick and awesome eats and for the nostalgia of old town city of orange.

At first I thought this place was going to be another mediocre waffle plus more place I wasn't too thrilled on trying it. But after reading more of the reviews and looking at the pictures I figured why not give it a try... OMG! wow, I'm so glad I tired it!! I take back all the second thoughts I had about this place...this place is amazing! It's a small little joint with very little seating so going there in big groups is a little of a gamble...you may get the benchs or you may not.. Now, down to the real deal! the food!! I got buttermilk fried chicken and waffle and it's amazing! You have a waffle with the honey chilli chicken sitting on a bed of coleslaw..it may sound a little odd but it's amazing! The chicken has all of the taste which is good because I thought the waffle was going to be a little sweet and would cancel out the taste of the chicken but it's the complete opposite. We also tired the Mint Chocolate Chip milkshake and that was amazing, you can tell they make it fresh just by the taste, and the chocolate the bottom was YUMMY! :D If your in the area and want to try something new..just try it! it won't hurt!

Who knew a waffle sandwich would become the next biggest CRAZE? Well Bruxie has proved it to be the next big thing with their chicken sandwich and burgers. Heck even their peanut butter and jelly is good. 蔇on't forget to add some egg to your sandwich to make it taste even better. The only complaint I hear is that the the price is steep and that one sandwich doesn't fill you up. My solution to that is to get the burger or chicken sandwich to fill you up. I've met the owners and they are some AWESOME dudes. Told me how they came up with the idea, name etc etc. COOL SPOT for a date and then walk around the Orange Circle after you eat.

I don't know whether to love Bruxie Chicken Sandwich or hate it-- here's why: After waiting in a very short line (less than 10 minutes-- they really got a good system going), I inhaled my meal in less than 5 minutes. 蔄s a result, I got the sugar-crotch. 蔠hat's the sugar-crotch, you may ask? 蔠ell, it's when you are really feelin' your meal because it's so freakin good and you let sweet stuff (in this case, maple syrup and the really delish sweet chile sauce) drip onto your crotch. 蔉or me, I didn't know I had a big glop of maple syrup on my jeans until I walked back to my car and got accosted by a Husky. �So anyways, I really don't know if I love it or hate it. 蔅ut it was sure delicious................................ and memorable. :(

Frozen Custard..Mmmmm! ------------- FYI The Belgian waffle-sandwich restaurant signed a lease to open their second shop in the location that formerly housed Fatburger on the corner of West Birch Street and Walnut Avenue in downtown Brea. They aim to open the Brea location by Nov. 8, 2011, the one-year anniversary of the Orange restaurant. http://blogs.ocweekly.co�###Olivia J.

This is actually closer to 3.5 but I am a fan so I chose 4 stars. I must say, their french fries (or waffles fries) are so damn good. 蔜he strawberry creme brulee was also very good. 蔍 had their chicken and waffles. 蔣ou must get the extra syrup - you'll regret it if you don't get it. 蔔ow, I thought this was going to taste like Roscoe's. 蔔ot even close, folks. 蔛o please do not get that in your head when ordering. 蔅ruxie's is good but you must eat everything together. 蔍f you eat it separately, for some reason, it doesn't taste that great. 蔒y husband ordered the Bruxie burger and he thought it was good. Three reasons why I am not giving them 5 stars: no parking, limited seating and long lines during peak time. 蔍f the food was supberb (don't get me wrong, it's good), none of these would matter.

Yummm! I can see why there's such a hype about this place. Their waffles' texture is slightly crispy and light. Definitely not your average Eggo waffles, my friends. The bf and I ordered the buttermilk chicken and their special of the day, pulled pork as well as the pumpkin shake. Loved the crunch of the buttermilk chicken. Simple, but delicious. The pulled pork was fabulously flavorful and juicy, but the sauces ended up drenching my waffle so it got quite soggy after a while. Pumpkin shake was just what you would imagine it'd be: pumpkin pie in a cup. Our final verdict: Everything was gooood.

Went to go try something new today. 蔍 never had chicken and waffles before, because I always thought that the waffles would taste like Eggo's waffles. 蔋ow I was wrong! My girlfriend and I were greeted by one of the works and asked if we've been here before. We said no and he helped us out with the menu and gave us great advice about what was good. 蔍 of course had the chicken and waffle and my girlfriend had the prosciutto and Gruyere waffle. 蔜hey were both amazing. 蔜he waffle was so good on its own. 蔍t was crispy and buttery on the outside and soft inside. 蔜hen our friendly server came by our table and gave us a complementary glass of strawberry lemonade! ��I am coming back to try their sweet menu!

A FIVE!! A FIVE!! Yes, Bruxie, you definitely deserve a five. 蔉rom location, food, and service, this place has got great written all over it. Located on a street that looks like it's full of history, Bruxie looks like a little sandwich shop, nestled on the corner of Glassell and Palm. 蔜he parking lot isn't huge, so your best bet is finding some street parking. Walking up, the menu is listed on the building. 蔛pecials of the day are written on a chalkboard on the sidewalk. 蔄s we waited in line, their friendly staff greeted us, and helped us with any questions that we had. 蔜hat's points right there. 蔍f I walk up to a busy place, having their staff come greet me is more incentive for me to stay and check it out instead of walking somewhere else with a shorter wait. My cousins and I ordered a variety of items, and, of course, tasted a little bit of it all. 蔍 had the special of the day, Braised Beef Short Rib. 蔛avory, tender meet held together by two sides of fluffy Belgian waffles. 蔜he sandwich seemed to just melt in my mouth with each bite I took. 蔍t was delicious. I also tried the following: Hot Pastrami Sandwich - Also the special of the day. 蔖astrami in a waffle? Who would have thought, but delicious nonetheless. Mushroom & Goat Cheese - If I hadn't seen the specials for the day, this was going to be my first choice. 蔍t tasted lovely. 蔞ery fresh, very light. 蔋owever, with each bite, you could taste each ingredient as it surrounded my taste buds. The Burger - A WAFFLE BURGER! 蔠ho could possibly go back to regular burgers after tasting this? 蔍 tell you, it's going to be hard to do so. The Liege Waffle - Good. 蔛erved with Nutella, which is always a plus. Fig Creme Brulee - To finish off our meal, this was definitely the perfect finish. 蔆armelized sugar and FRESH fig. 蔋ow did I know it was fresh? 蔅ecause I happen to be allergic to all fresh fruits (only mildly), and my tongue definitely started to tingle once I took a bite of this absolutely mouth-watering, tasty, delicious dessert. With so many options - Savory & Sweet - it's hard to pick just one! 蔍 definitely couldn't! 蔠hich is why I'll definitely be back soon for more!

Went to get lunch here with my cousins after a long hike up and down from Hollywood sign. The place itself is cute. It's a small food stand with outside seating and a tiny parking lot. They question you if you park too long or if you park too crappy though. I ordered a prosciutto and Gruyere sandwich and paired it with an egg creme float and a Liege Waffle Sundae. My cousins got two egg, bacon, and cheddar sandwiches and a seasonal creme brulee sweet sandwich respectively. I got my egg creme almost immediately. I tried it and it was not that good...it was plain soda water with a slight chocolate flavor (gets better when you mix it but still). The cashier helping me asked me if I liked it and offered to give me a different one (I got a Black Cow Float). He let me have both drinks instead of exchanging the egg creme which was very nice of him but I'm pretty sure part of that was because he probably wanted my number or something. Aside from his flirting, he was very nice. A good worker. From what I saw, the rest of the workers were very friendly too. We took the rest of the food too go and ate it in the car because we were in a hurry. My prosciutto sandwich was amazing although it took me a while to get used to the grainy mustard inside (it's quite tangy). My cousin's egg sandwich was very good but you can't really go wrong with a bacon, egg, and cheese combo. My other cousin's creme brulee sandwich was also very good. Definitely worth getting. After a while, I decided to eat my sundae. It was kind of messy to get it to go but it was very good. It didn't get crappy soggy like most waffles usually do. I enjoyed it while it lasted. I like this place a lot for their waffles. I don't typically like waffles from different places because they make it weird. These waffles were crunchy enough and soft inside. The quality of the ingredients from that place are also very good and the portions were decent. The prices are pretty reasonable as well. I would go back to this place again.

I honestly can not say anything bad about this place. If you are a chicken and waffles lover (like i am) you would love love love this place! The waffles were cooked to perfection, the chicken was nicely fried but still moist on the inside and the syrup that they had between the waffle and chicken had a little spicy kick to it. As many times as i've had chicken and waffles, this was my first time having it with syrup! Never knew it could taste so good. and with this being only �6.95........wow, Bruxie--I'm in love! now only if you'd open up a store in norcal.....

Finally! After months of listening to my friend Cammie D. rave about this place... the fam and I finally made the trek to the City of Orange to stuff our faces at Bruxie. I guess I am not as good of a Yelper as I thought I was. I should have Yelped Bruxie prior to my visit. Then, maybe, I would not have been surprised to see a food stand with limited seating. My bad... hahahaha. I tried the buttermilk fried chicken waffle with chili honey and cole slaw. It was very simple but delicious nonetheless. I wish they added more chili honey to enhance the flavor. The waffle itself is not sweet or overbearing at all. My two kids shared a S'mores waffle. You can never go wrong with s'mores when it comes to my 3- and 5- year old. They both ate their half as quickly as they could. Luke S. ordered the strawberry creme br瀕巈 蕎affle. He commented that this was GOOOOD. He was shocked that the waffle had caramelized raw sugar. The custard was okay... he wished that it was more vanilla flavored. The service was great! As we were standing in line, one of the employees came by to ask if it were our first time at Bruxie and if we had any questions. Another plus was the fast service. This place is busy... but we still got our order within 5 to 10 minutes. The only thing that bugged me was their lack of drink choices. 蔜hey offer sodas, hot tea, coffee, and some pricey strawberry lemonade. Maybe ice tea or non-soda fountain drink choices would be great. Other than that, everything was great... We will definitely be back to try the other waffle combos. Quick Tip: Apparently, the stand itself has been around for years. 蔇ue to the old piping, there aren't any restrooms.

Randomly came here today and it was actually my first time. I had no expectations since I heard mixed reviews. I heard this place could get reallly packed though, luckily I caught this place at a good time. �Anyways, very fast and good service! but no parking :( resorted to the meters i guess. I got the salmon and dill cream cheese waffle :) it was pretty good. Nothing unique that stood out to me though. Salmon was fresh though, i guess I could give it that one. My friend got the Apple bacon cheddar egg waffle sandwich. It was okay. It tastes better with ketchup and siracha though otherwise, it a little too oily for my taste. however my friend really enjoyed it, i guess she likes oily stuff. Sugar cane soda: way too sweet. the coke itself is already sweet but this just made it taste like im chugging sugar -_- NOW onto dessert: You must get the Creme Brulee dessert!! I normally hate creme brulee but this is something you just have to get even if you're not a dessert person. even if you're too full, it's worth gaining a pound from it. it's not too sweet either but just right amount of sweets!

We arrived on a Thursday morning as we headed back home from our Disney trip. It was on my list of things to do or eat before we left. It did not disappoint!!! My whole family LOVED it- and that's a hard thing to accomplish, there's always one in the bunch right?? Well we got their just as they were opening and I told the gentleman working there we were from out of town and we needed help....He was the kindest and sweetest person. We got the original waffles for my toddler, than Babe got the Bacon,egg and cheddar- Yum!! One daughter got the peanut butter and jelly- I think she was a little freaked about the whole concept, but she LOVED it! In the end by the time we were half way home we all wanted more and this will be the first stop heading back into town on our next Disney trip! ps. Someone mentioned below the grease....? I don't know how to explain that, but we had a car of 5 take out boxes from them and there was no grease, I remember wanting to check on that after we were done, and there was nothing......no grease anywhere. Side note, my toddler ate the whole full order of waffles! �Wish they were closer to home, but man, what a treat while we were out of town! *And their Pete's coffee was perfect!

I did not 蔱xpect it to be an outdoor restaurant. In my mind I thought of roscoes chicken and waffles haha so I kind of regret coming on a really cold day. Anyway the food was really good. I ordered the corn beef Reuben and my friend ordered the classic fried chicken and waffles. I couldn't really taste the waffle it honestly tasted like toast to me lol but it was still a really good sandwich. The fried chicken and waffles had honey that perfectly complimented the chicken. I'd definitely recommend either one. One of the guys there was also super chill and gave us recommendations on what to order. And for desert we ordered the strawberry creme br瀕巈 which was really good. I'm only docking a star because it didn't really WOW me, and I guess I had high expectations for it. I'll forsure go again though and maybe the second time around I'll change my mind.

I am a waffle connoisseur. That said this place has some goddamn awesome waffles. They are light, crispy, airy, 蔲ried clouds of deliciousness. A nice contrast to the usually heavy texture you might expect gourmet waffles to be. I got the famous Chicken and Waffles after much insistence. I usually don't like the combination, mostly because I had it at Roscoes and that place blows. But here, the chicken is breast meat, so it's not quite as moist as dark, but still very good. And comes with coleslaw which adds a nice tang and crunch and lightness to contrast with the heaviness of the chicken and waffle. Whereas, I think, you mostly eat the waffle and chicken separately, at Bruxie, it works very well together. I had some of my sister's egg, cheese and bacon waffle: good, but not hard to get right. And some of her Brussel waffle. Tastes like a churro but, lighter and better. A++ would do business again.

Came with a big group so I was lucky and got to taste a lot of diffferent things. Ordered: - Bruxie Burger -- was surprisengly good, was a little skeptical about a hamburger on a waffle but it definetly worked. - Fried chicken & waffle -- I added maple syrup to it. This was my favorite savory sandwich at Bruxie's! Everything worked together so perfectly and surprisengly didn't feel heavy even though you're basically eating fried chicken in between a waffle. - Waffle fries with cheese and bacon -- Good, not great. Obviously anything with bacon and cheese is good. But this isn't a stand out dish like the fried chicken and waffle. - Lemon cream & berries waffle -- SOOO GOOD! The perfect summer dessert!

I think the 1100+ reviews sums up this place. 蔍've been wanting to try this place for months and I finally had the pleasure of going yesterday for lunch. 蔝pon arrival, I saw a loooooong line and thought....great, it better be worth it. 蔍t was a hot day, but thankfully they had water mist to cool us off. 蔠hat makes this place extraordinary is that the workers are so friendly and attentive. 蔜hey would bring a tray off water and offer the customers while waiting in line. �I had the buttermilk waffle with fried chicken, extra maple paired with waffle fries. 蔍 was blown away at how good it was! 蔄fter my first bite I was already thinking of when I'm coming back and what to try next. �The only bad thing about this place is there is limited seating, but they have tables and a bar so you can stand. 蔜he customer service is just so excellent. 蔍 can't believe I waited so long to try this place. 蔍'm a super fan!

SO I have a confession. 蔍've long heard of Bruxie and wanted to come here but also I put off coming here because I'm not a fan of "sandwiches" (anything between two pieces of bread). But we were on our way out to a night on the town and this was suggested so we went. 蔅oy, we got there just in the nick of time (6:50). 蔠e found parking across the street, jaywalked our way over and were in line about 5 people deep. 蔛hortly after, the line ballooned to about 40 people deep. 蔠e definitely got lucky! We ordered the buttermilk fried chicken bruxie, the hot pastrami bruxie, a cheese bruxie, irish nachos and some cane syrup sodas. 蔍 also splurged and got a liege waffle with nutella. Everything was sooooo spot on delicious. 蔠ith no cheese or gravy, the fried chicken buxie was still so moist and delicious. 蔍 do have to say I would prefer more flavor to the "coleslaw" they put in it. 蔜he cabbage was flavorless and offered more of a textural variation than any flavor contibution. The irish nachos were good, covered in bacon and a very pleasant and not-heavy cheese sauce. �Hubby devoured his hot pastrami bruxie without offering me a bite, declaring it the best pastrami he's ever had in his life. 蔊eez, now I know why he hoovered it. The liege waffle was different, definitely a little denser and not as airly and fluffy as the waffles they use in their bruxies. Great food...just be warned, it's a little shack with a walk-up order window. 蔣ou have to be quick to snag a seat or eat a counter-height bar table. Some people are brutal, even refusing a mother's request to let her son eat his food at their table. 蔄nyway, you have been warned!

My girlfriends and I ordered the buttermilk fried chicken, pulled pork, and ham and egg with pesto (yummiest) waffle sandwiches. The fried chicken and pulled pork were kinda bland tasting. I also ordered a date shake because many yelp reviewers raved about it. I gotta tell ya, it tastes just like any vanilla shake. The flavor of dates is very light, so the vanilla flavor completely overpowers the dates. Besides slurping up a few pieces of dates, I would have thought I was drinking a vanilla shake if I didn't know what I was drinking. Overall, the savory waffle sandwiches were good but not great. I wouldn't go back for the food, but would suggest it to friends if they want to try something new. I think the waffle sandwich concept is cool just nothing to rave about. Warning: This place is tiny, so it's always packed. I think it has 5 or 6 tables at most? There's a small "bar" area where you can stand; it fits about 5-6 skinny to medium sized people. You will have to wait a long time to get a table, and all tables are outside. It's a super casual place, so no need to dress nice or cute. We stood and ate so maybe that's why my experience wasn't all that wonderful.

The egg, bacon and cheese waffle sandwich is soooooooo good. this place is just amazing to eat ate and even though that wait to order can be long sometimes(a lot of folks come eat here), they make up for it with the taste and the quick preparation of the food. i think its pretty awesome that they have special menus that change up week to week. wish they had more locations...

this is definitely one place you'll never get tired of! i've been to both locations and i prefer the bruxie in orange instead of the one in brea. parking is sometimes a hassle and there's limited seating BUT the reason i love this one is the simple fact that their customer service is amazing! everyone is SO friendly and genuine! the one at brea...yeah.....enough said haha :) anyways! back to the important stuff. FOOD! my favorite savory item is the bbq pulled pork but the only downside is that it's not part of the set menu... :( BUT! when in doubt! definitely try the roasted mushroom and goat cheese OR the fried chicken and waffle. you definitely can't go wrong with those options! oh and i do advise you to STAY AWAY from the bruxie burger. not a favorite at all... the best advice i could give you when it comes to bruxie: DO NOT LEAVE WITHOUT TRYING THE CREME BRULEE! even though it's a moment on the lips and forever on the hips you are SO NOT GOING TO REGRET IT!!! :)

Was finally able to try the famous Buttermilk Fried Chicken and Waffle (with chili honey and coleslaw) that so many reviews and people have recommended. I actually really liked it! At first, I was a bit iffy because chicken, coleslaw, and a honey-based sauce wrapped within a waffle?!? All the ingredients went very well together. The first thing that hit me was the honey sauce, slightly sweet yet with a hint of spice in it. The chicken still held its crunch even with all that sauce! The only thing I wished there was more of was the coleslaw (there wasn't as much as I thought there would be). I bumped it to five stars because I just came to realize that whenever I come here to eat, I eat it all! I have finished all the waffle sandwiches by myself (except the first time when I shared half because I had a cold). But me eating everything, feeling satisfied at the end of every meal here, says something about the place. I will definitely be back! :)

WOW. 蔍'm so mad that this place is so far from me because I would eat here every day. 蔔o matter what time in the day, no matter what you're craving (sweet, salty? Maybe both?) they have something here for you. 蔜hese waffles are good by themselves. 蔍 think they brush them with butter with a sprinkling of crack. 蔖arking is okay, there's street parking and walking is good for your health! The prices are really legit too not to mention the customer service which is ace. BTW the waffle sandos are pretty big so you're not losing anything if you just order the 'which. 蔍 came with my 2 other food buddies and we ordered the chicken and waffles sandwich (my favorite) the pastrami and then a dessert one- creme brulee. 蔠OW. 蔈verything was so amazing. SO. AMAZING. 蔍 can't wait to come back again to try the breakfast one and the smoked salmon one. 蔄ctually, I can't wait o come back again and order 5 sandos for myself. If you're contemplating on buying the house right across the street from Bruxies just so you can have a waffle sando everyday then you know the place is legit. 蔆ome. eat. enjoy. orgasm... then lust for it 24/7 until you come back again. this is what WILL happen.

Made a quick stop at Bruxie before heading off to Disneyland and definitely exceeded my already high expectations. First of all, judging by the Disney-esque long line, I mentally calculated that we would be there for about an hour just waiting for food. Wrong! Our food came out quickly and we devoured them just as quick! Mr. Dubs and I ordered the buttermilk waffle with fried chicken and waffle with egg, bacon and cheese. Both were delicious and hit the spot for me! I was surprised by the lightness of the waffle batter and couldn't have enough! I can't wait to go back for more. Just thinking about it is making me super hungry!

I told you, Bruxie. I told you that I would be back and indeed, less than 1 week later, I find myself waiting in line for the Green Eggs and Ham waffle sandwich. Man, I thought I should branch out and try other flavors, but thought well, this is a special... specials don't last forever, whereas the regular items will always be on the menu..might as well get what I really enjoyed. And once again, you did not disappoint, Bruxie. Nope, you ruled and I had waffles for dinner. Anyway, this time, my girl friends and I were just enjoying our savory waffle sandwiches when one of the runners came up to us and asked, "Have you guys tried our nutella and banana waffle?" All three of us looked confused and just shook our heads "No". He continued, "Would you like one?" Immediately, I said, "Of course!" So,major shoutout to the runner for giving it to us, and also to whoever actually ordered it and decided he/she didn't want it? So, this nutella and banana was pretty good-- slices of banana, nutella, and sweet cream sandwiched between the waffle and topped with powdered sugar. Yum. Definitely a fan of this Orange Circle joint, despite the lack of parking and lines.

Everything about Bruxie makes me happy. What I've tried so far: -Chicken and Waffle: I wish I hadn't had this to go. They put the sauces on the side to prevent the waffle from getting soggy (which is a good thing, no one wants a soggy waffle). But being a Bruxie newb, I didn't realize how essential all the toppings were to the sandwich. I need to give this another go. -Carolina BBQ Pulled Pork (seasonal): This was amazing! Seriously sold me on the first bite. Too bad it's not regularly on the menu!! -Hot Pastrami (seasonal): Very good and filling. Had just the right touch of spicy mustard and pickles. -Smoked Salmon and Dill Cream Cheese: This was okay, but I'd definitely prefer it as a breakfast item. Definitely less filling than everything else I've tried. -STRAWBERRY CHEESECAKE (seasonal): ohhh mahhh gooodness. as my teacher would say "star star star." You can't go wrong here. The waiter hyped this up by saying: "Have you ever seen 'The Sandlot"? There's a part in the movie where they are sitting in the park and the one kid decides to jump in the pool. You're going to feel as happy as that kid." And our strawberry cheesecake did not disappoint. The strawberries were fresh and sweet. The waffle beautifully crisp. The graham cracker crust topped it perfectly. I can't even do it justice. Why you can't go wrong: A perfectly crisp waffle. So many different menu options! They serve Peet's Coffee. Service is super quick and oh-so-friendly. Lots of refreshing drink choices including the strawberry lemonade and pure cane sugar sodas. Any downsides? (Well, no one is perfect). Parking in the lot is a little difficult, but there is plenty of street parking. No bathrooms. Sometimes the names come out kinda weird so pay attention (Danielle turned into Neil for some reason.) Definitely eat here, despite the limited seating. The food tastes that much better. I can't wait to try more and more of their menu. Hmm, frozen custard anyone?

Heard about this place from friends. Not really a big fan of chicken and waffles type of food, so I wouldn't exactly say that I was excited to try this place out. I've gone 3 times in the passed 2-3 weeks, so it must be pretty good right? Right! Tried a few things here so far... Bruxie Burger - I've got this twice now, both times medium rare. Being on a waffle is whatever seeing how I mentioned before that I'm no waffle-fan-#1. The burger itself is pretty damn good though. The patty and cheese are both good quality. My only gripe about the burger is that it should be MOAR filling. I'm pretty confident that I can put down 3 in a single sitting. At the same time though, at $6.95 a burger, I wouldn't get 3. Pastrami (seasonal) - It's pretty good, typical pastrami sandwich, minus a bun and add a waffle. Cheesy Bruxie - 2 kinds of cheese, wouldn't really recommend this one to anyone, seeing how it really doesn't come with that much cheese. For $4.95, I would have expected more. Good thing it was my cousin that bought it, and I only tried it, otherwise I would have been more bitter. Chicken and Waffle - my cousin got this, I tried it, but I said it earlier... I just don't understand the chicken and waffle thing. If anything, I thought the chicken was a bit dry. Turkey Reuben (seasonal) - This was pretty good. The slices of turkey was Boar's Head brand. I used to work in a cafe that sold sandwiches with Boar's Head meat. Pretty good sh*t. I believe it had gruyere cheese in it... and 蕇auerkraut. The sauerkraut totally caught me off guard. Not a big fan of sauerkraut. Still it was pretty good. If I were to get this next time, I would probably ask them to take off the sauerkraut, and maybe add some avocado. Waffle fries - These are just plain fries. Because they are waffle fries, I automatically assume that they are seasoned. So when the fries came plain jane... I was kind of disappointed. Frozen Custard - It's been a while since I've had this anywhere. Really creamy. If anything maybe a little tooooooooo creamy for my lactose intolerate self. Also, it's all outdoor seating, if you can find any seats, you can always stand at the counter and eat. First time I came here it was raining, since it's all outdoor, they just pull down a vinyl curtain, and turn on some heat lamps, thus taking away more than half the seating. Service is pretty good, very similar to Carl's Jr. Order, pay, sit down, they bring your food. Water is self service, and so are the condiments. As for the condiments, I can't help but wonder who uses the siracha. One more thing, their parking lot can only fit like 3 cars, and one of the spaces is for fake/real handicap people. I'd definitely come back, there are a few more things on the menu that I'd like to try like the Mushroom and Goat cheese. Chili Waffle fries... and I should probably try one of the deserts like the Nutella/Bananas w/ sweet cream.

My companions loved this place; I was much more ambivalent. 蔜he style and concept is nice. 蔜he food (I tried the Bruxie Burger, short ribs, and the bacon-cheese-egg w/ avocado replacing the bacon) is good, not great. I believe my problems was that I felt the concept had been done elsewhere better, and I just prefer buns with my burgers, not waffles. However, this place can be great in a pinch. 蔐unch with co-workers, quick lunch date, etc ... sure, try it. 蔜he seating is entirely outside and there might be some difficulty finding a place to seat at first, but that shouldn't last long. 蔎ust go with an open mind and an hungry stomach, and it shouldn't leave you the worse for wear. Do get the custard though; that was delicious.

NOT SO OVERRATED AFTER ALL After 3 visits, I had to finally give Bruxie a fair review. �First Visit: - Chicken and Waffle: Very delicious - Banana and Nutella: Too sweet, but pretty good - Belgian Hot Chocolate: Just like any ordinary hot chocolate Second Visit: - Chicken and Waffle: Shared with a friend and we agreed: YUM! - Lemon Cream and Berries: Shared with a friend and we agreed: MEH. - Waffle Fries - Yummy!! Third Visit: * This visit was a behind the scenes food tasting, meaning these weren't ready to be released to the public just yet. 蔍 was lucky enough to be with the right person to get some free food here from the owner himself! - Pastrami: Yummy! (http://media3.ct.yelpcdn� - Pulled Pork: Yummy! (http://media1.px.yelpcdn� - Banana Creme Pie: OMG DELICIOUS!! (http://media4.ct.yelpcdn� I wouldn't come here out of my way unless there was a deal or some sort of incentive for me to come back, but if I were hanging around the Orange Circle, I'd definitely come and pay them a visit! Tip: Order their Chicken & Waffle and their Waffle Fries! 蔣ou can't go wrong with that! Advice: Don't take your waffles to-go and wait 10-15 minutes to eat them. 蔜hey taste best when consumed while they are hot and fresh!

Yes! 蔆ome here. �This place is great. 蔍 think it's all outdoor seating but it's in downtown Orange and in a beautiful area. �The food is excellent. 蔍t may not be the best waffle I've ever eaten, but the waffle combinations are superior to other places with this concept. 蔠e had the nutella, sweet cream, and banana waffle which was awesome. 蔜here were a ton of sweet, and also savory waffles to try. 蔄lso, 蔜HIS PLACE HAD REAL CUSTARD. 蔋aving lived in Wisconsin for 2 years, I know custard when I taste it and this was it. 蔕k, it wasn't Culver's or some other midwestern heaven, but it's the closest thing I've found on the west coast. 蔜he taste had that eggy sweetness that ice cream does not have. 蔍t was also a sligtly yellowish color which is indicative of real custard. 蔒y only complaint is that the milkfat was rather low. 蔆ustard should coat your mouth in a fashion that it would be prudent to have your cholesterol checked soon after consumption. Food: 5 stars Value: 5 Atmosphere: 5

THIS PLACE IS AMAZING THAT I ATE 3! Here's what my friends and I tried: Buttermilk Fried Chicken & Waffle ($6.95), Roasted Mushroom & Goat Cheese with Sun dried tomato & chicken breast added, the special of the day (Tuesday) Pulled Pork, S'mores ($5.95), and the Seasonal Creme Brulee ($6.50). THE BEST ONES: Roasted Mushroom & Goat Cheese with Sun dried tomato & chicken breast added; FOR DESSERT: Seasonal Creme Brulee with strawberries Service was awesome! The staff was really friendly, gave tips, and funny. They even gave us some Frozen Custard for us to taste for free. CON: It's a little hut and only outdoor seating. Bad for rainy days. Prices arn't cheap but reasonable. I will definitely be back!

My favorites include Fried Chicken and Waffle, Pulled Pork, and also the Egg, Bacon & Cheese! I've had some of their sweeter waffles, but I'm more of a savory food lover. I always try to look out for their daily specials to try something new. One of my favorite specials are the Irish Nachos. They are perfect for sharing with 2-3 people. The employees are always very friendly, even though they are always busy. They also have several people walking around cleaning up tables and making sure your meal is satisfactory. I'm not much of a shake person, but everyone I go with loves them. Overall, I recommend this place to all my friends to try. I can't wait until the Brea location opens up since I live/work closer to that area.

This place is know for their "gourmet" waffle sandwiches and obviously by the reviews and ratings is a people's favorite. I just had it for the first time today and I LOVED it. We went around 2:30pish and there was still a line but it moved fairly quickly and in 15 minutes we were able to place our order in. They have little water mists cooling you off as you wait in line and people actually handing out menus and asking if you have any questions regarding the menu. So service is pretty great here too for a fast food style joint and expedited. Seating is outside and there aren't very many tables but there are some standing bar spaces. We ordered the signatured Buttermilk Fried Chicken and a Carolina BBQ Pulled Pork. The buttermilk fried chicken was fried to perfection in a nice coat of herbs and spices and not dry at all. Add to that some chile honey and cole slaw and that thin crispy waffle sandwich, and you have one awesome meal right there. This sandwich will run you $6.95 - and an extra $1.00 for maple syrup. At $8.95, the Carolina BBQ Pulled Pork is a seasonal item and was recommended by one of the staff there. This came with cheddar cheese, cider slaw, and a side of BBQ sauce. The meat was nice and juicy and the BBQ sauce had a nice kick to it. The only problem I had with this sandwich was that it got a bit soggy on the bottom from all the pork juices and sauce. BUT, it was still super delicious. �I was tempted to order the Strawberry Creme Brulee too but wanted to save room for dinner. This just means that I'll have to come back soon. :D

Oh goodness... To be honest, I was expecting a rubbery chewy waffle, without much flavor. I mean, looking at those prices, I was expecting lower quality insides. But I made a delicious choice. There was a chalkboard with the Proscuitto and Fig filling, IMMEDIATELY attracted, and ordered that one. the BF ordered the Bruxie Burger with waffle fries, friend ordered the strawberry creme brulee, the amigo ordered the Bruxie Cheese. Proscuitto and Fig: So good, beautiful complex flavor of salty and sweet tangy balsamic reduction. Incredible crunchy soft texture of the waffle with a bit of sweetness from both the waffle, balsamic reduction and fig. Beautiful flavor. Highly recommend. Not too salty proscuitto. Creme Brulee: It's okay, you get the gorgeous creme brulee syrup flavor, but the strawberries were sweet and fresh. Bruxie Burger: Perfectly cooked, absolutely fabulous beef flavor and comes with 2 generous patties. Waffle Fries: Perfectly cooked, soft and slightly seasoned. The quality of food is definetly there, quite the bargain. Worth the 20min wait in 90 degree weather.

Love it here, especially for desserts. Their strawberry creme br瀕巈 and s'mores are good but you HAVE to order their custard to put on top of the waffles, especially for the s'mores bc it cuts the richness of the chocolate. I got their mint chocolate milkshake. It's too runny for me. I like thicker creamier milkshakes but the flavor is still good, the fudgey goodness on the bottom of the cup makes it yummy.

Pros: Chicken and waffles, waffle fries, fast service, reasonable prices ($7-$9 for a waffle sandwich) Cons: Long lines Went here the other day to see what all the hype is about and I'm pretty impressed. 蔍 ended up getting the "Buttermilk Fried Chicken and Waffle" and the "Hash and Egg" sandwiches. 蔜he "Hash and Egg" was okay, but I was really impressed with the chicken and waffle sandwich. 蔜he chicken wasn't overcooked and was nice and tender. 蔅oth sandwiches are around $7 dollars. 蔜he waffles fries here are pretty good too. The only downside is the line can kinda suck. 蔆ame here about 9:30 am on a Saturday morning and the line took 10 minutes to get through. 蔄fter I ordered though, the food came out pretty quick.

Finally, no megagantic line, so we popped in for lunch. I don't get it. Low quality (cheap) waffles (but not a cheap price), salty meat, and they get really greasy with the savory ones. I could do better with Eggos and my own fixings. Definitely, NOT worth the wait, if there is a line or even if there isn't.

People hype this place up like it's some strip club where all the dances are free and not a single ugly girl is working (in the day even). Bruxie is an awesome, awesome, awesome place with a unique menu The waffle batter here so delicious, just thinking about it is causing my mouth to fill with saliva. The meat is delicious, the seasonal items are great and the service is very, very good. It's a small tiny place in Old Towne Orange 蕋hat's no bigger then a Wienerschnitzel stand with no restrooms, four parking spaces, and is often crowded because it's near the University - all this doesn't matter because the food is that good. This is one of those places that if you take a girl here and if she says it sucks, you tell her to take a bus home. Yep, It's that good.

I love this place! The food is delicious although a bit pricey. I have tried several different items on their menu and they have all tasted pretty good. And if you are not satisfied with the sandwich you ordered, the will gladly bring you a different sandwich of your choice and even let you keep the sandwich you already ordered. My favorite would have to be the smoked salmon and herb cream cheese waffle sandwich. I also like the pure cane sugar soda a lot. I normally do not drink soda but it's an exception here. All the items here seem delicious and mouth watering. They also have desert and frozen custard. The soda floats here like the purple haze seem pretty popular. The only thing I don't like about the place is that there is limited parking. However, you can park in the neighborhood next to Bruxie. The seating is outdoors. There are heated lamp posts to keep you warm though.

Alright I caved from all the pressure of the hype on this place and decided I HAD to try it. Got everybody's recommendation: the fried chicken in a waffle thingy. Also ordered the prosciutto & gruyere 蔵n a waffle thingy. First off, WTF I thought this was an actual restaurant. Man was I surprised when I showed up and it's just a little sandwich stand a la Tommy's Hamburger style. Seats? Fuhgeddaboudit! I did manage to swoop on a table but had to stand and eat. Kind of cool that they have servers bring out your food to you, but in a business sense, save money, cut the server so I don't pay like $8 bucks for a little waffle sandwich. First up: Fried chicken and waffles sandwich. Fried chicken: good. Waffles: good. So maybe fried chicken + waffle = really good? Yeah, I liked-ed it! Chicken was perfectly cooked and seasoned correctly. Next up: Prosciutto & Gruyere. One bite and I'm in love. What can I say, I'm a slut for ham & cheese. Overall, the food is definitely good but a bit on the pricey side for the portion you get. Skip the waffle fries, there's nothing life changing about them. Does it live up to the hype? Nope. But it's definitely some good food though. PROTIP: Don't park in the neighborhood. It's permits only. I found out the hard way. $54 parking ticket ;'( DAMN YOU CITY OR ORANGE!!!!

If you are anywhere NEAR orange county/irvine area please please please stop by Bruxie!! This place is the best place for lunch! It is a great mom/pop shop and it has kindness/quality woven into the FOOD. Bad thing about this place might be the seating, since it is only outdoor seating and more of a serve yourself kind of place. If you are trying to impress a girl on a lunch date, this is probably not the place for you. But if you are with friends and want a great/fulfilling lunch, then come to Bruxie!! What I ordered: 1. Buttermilk Fried Chicken and Waffle (Savory Waffle) [With chilli Honey and Cole slaw] -Let me tell you, this is a little piece of HEAVEN. This puts roscoes chicken and waffles to shame. The fried chicken is cooked to perfection! Not too greasy either and the waffle seriously soaks up all of the juices so every bite is literally a little piece of heaven. The chili honey pairs perfectly with the chicken. Sweet and salty is definitely my favorite kind explosion of flavor. I suggest getting the waffle fries as a combo. The waffle fries are just normal criss cut fries. Nothing too extraordinary about them. They taste average too, but definitely try the waffles! 2. Nutella and Bananas (Sweet Waffle) [With sweet cream] -You cannot come to Bruxie and not have a sweet waffle as well! Let me tell you, the portions are pretty big (to me of course) so my advice is to share the sweet waffle as a dessert with a friend or something. Eating both by yourself will definitely be a challenge. The waffle portion of this dish is the same waffle they use for the savory waffles as well so that is a plus. The nutella and banana pair sooooooo well together there are no words to explain how delicious it is! Nutella itself is not TOO sweet to the point where it is overpowering the waffle so you still get the full taste of the waffles, and at times where it does get a rather bit too sweet, the banana helps balance the flavor. Definitely my favorite!! 3. Creamside Float -This is seriously why I love this place. My friend and I got this creamside float on the house! When we first got there, we were only set on getting the savory waffle. The server recommended it to us of course. Then they saw that my friend and I killllllllllled that savory waffle in t-minus 10 seconds [hahaha] and saw us immediately waiting at the window line for seconds! Thats why we decided to get the sweet waffles. We both got our own FYI [hence we were sooo full]. They were so impressed by our love for their waffles they gave us the creamside float on the house for us to try. And we LOVEEEED it. I wish we got it earlier because we were so full we could not shove any more food down our throats. But definitely try this drink it is worth it! Their sodas are made with the purest sugar and nothing artificial. Overall, GREAT PLACE! MUST TRY!!

When I first heard of this place, there was so much hype and people raving about it. Finally decided to tackle it on my own. I went here twice, first time had the grilled mushroom and something (it was awhile ago) and it was decent. I remember my first bite and it had a bitter taste to it. Last week I came and decided to get the salmon and cream cheese with a side of fries.I believe the salmon was raw, like sushi raw, and dabbed with cream cheese. It was good, but I expected great. Fries were good though, very good. The service is always upbeat and polite! The only flaw is it's a long wait to order and receive your order. Limited seating, too. It's located in a nice environment though. Downtown and near a private college, Chapman. Like I said, too much hype. It's a cool idea, waffle sandwich, but only if the content was more tasty then sure!

HIGHLIGHT: chicken and waffles w/ honey dip I came here recently after hearing all the praise from my friends, and it was a very delicious experience. i tried the chicken and waffles and the pull pork waffle w/ a strawberry lemonade. the chicken and waffle was surprisingly good, i know most people think like roscoes or something, but its completely different. the chicken is fried to a golden brown perfection, nice and crunchy on the outside with tender white meat on the inside slapped in between a waffle, sprinkle of lettuce and a drizzle of honey...mmm the pulled pork was good, but didn't compare to the chicken for me. it was pulled pork slathered with bbq sauce and some coleslaw. yummy and flavorful, tasty!! the location of bruxie is just a little past old orange, which is so cute!! its an outdoor place with a little over 10 tables and definitely fills up quickly!! if youre in the area, come try it out!! definitely an interesting experience!! i can't wait to go back and try of the sweet waffles they have!

Love. Loved it so much, I came back a few hours later with my girlfriend!! This place is a staple to the restaurants in the Orange Circle! It is the Pinks of Orange County. Came here for the first time Sunday morning with boyfriend bear. Ordered their Summer Seasonal Specials: Pruscuitto Hash and Green Eggs and Ham. Oralgasm all the way. Both were equally amazing. We also ordered the Mint Chocolate Shake. Beware. Split this with someone. It is made with soft serve frozen custard and glazed with chocolate around the cup. Super rich and creamy. Second round that day, I ordered the Pulled Pork. It was ehhh. Not a pulled pork kind of gal. The second sandwich we ordered was their third Savory Special- Wild Mushroom. The is the PERFECT dish for vegetarians out there. So freaking delicious I freaking wanted to order a second but I was too freaking stuffed. The owner suggested to add sun-dried tomatoes to it in our next visit. Genius. We also ordered the banana split shake with that meal. Yes, I am fat. I know. Anywhoo, the owner, Kelly or Kelley, is really nice. He came out both times I visited that day and talked to all of the customers waiting in line. He explained the menu and offered great suggestions.

SWEET BABY JESUS. This has got to be the ultimate guilty pleasure...fried chicken & coleslaw in a waffle sandwich!!! I came here twice and tried the fried chicken waffle sandwich, the strawberry creme brulee waffle sandwich, waffle fries, and some of 蕋he Carolina pulled pork sandwich (which my bf ordered) so far. I definitely recommend the fried chicken sandwich for 1st timers, I believe it's their most popular sandwich and in my opinion, the best I've had so far. The sweet combination of maple syrup, coleslaw, and fried chicken is just too good to be true!! As for the strawberry creme brulee sandwich, I could care less about my figure...I'm a huge creme brulee fan and strawberry happens to be my favorite fruit, so you can just imagine how over the moon I was when I tried this. I think this was one of their limited edition desserts, so I'm not sure if they still have this, but it should stay on the menu (hint hint, Bruxie). Seating can be hard to find, especially when they're really busy, and the tables are usually filled. but Bruxie, I will always be a fan!!!

5 stars all the way. Even though the prices were a little high for what you could get at Roscoe's for cheaper, it's def. worth the drive and to try once.. or twice.. or multiple times. It's extremely busy during lunch hour, however they have umbrellas set up in the outdoor waiting area. The waitresses and waiters were very friendly and helpful with providing suggestions and recommendations for us chicken and waffle nubbs. I ordered the Buttermilk Fried Chicken and Waffles, Strawberry Creme Brulee, Waffle Fries, and the Strawberry Lemonade. Buttermilk Fried C&W: Very good and tender, perfectly oiled and buttered, 蔍'll leave it to the hundreds of other yelpers to explain how good it is. However, because of the price, I feel like I'd rather go to Roscoe's for chicken and waffles since theirs is more "legit" (I don't know how else to explain it) and they give you much much more. Strawberry Creme Brulee: This is def. worth the drive for. I'm not a big fan of sweet desserts but this really good. It wasn't too sweet and the strawberries were pretty fresh. It went surprisingly well with the waffles. Note: It's not on the actual menu, but be sure to order it :) Waffle Fries: Sooooooo good and definitely worth trying. I recommend getting the combo with the buttermilk fried c&w. Strawberry Lemonade: Really "natural" tasting and fresh. I forgot how much it is, but it's a pretty good thing to have after waiting in the sun/shade.

If you've read my reviews, you know I'm not a contrarian. 蔇isclaimer on hand, both the Mr. and I felt it was only okay. 蔜he prosciutto was nice, perhaps more appreciated if were made up at home in the kitchen for $2.00. 蔜he fried chicken waffle was nothing to rave about (perhaps I'm spoiled by Lola's chicken and waffles in Phoenix).

I am always skeptical when I see a place get 5 stars, but they have earned it! After seeing this place for the first time a few weeks back, my wife and I kept talking about needing to check it out... 蔮ut the long line deterred us. 蔠ell folk, don't let that line fool you. 蔍 first off must give props to the management for hiring enough employees to keep that line moving... 蔱verything from the girl handing out cups of water to those waiting in line, to the guy out there for the sole purpose of answering questions for customers in line, to the food runners bringing your orders out to your table... 蕋his all shows their dedication to customer service... Now, onto the other important part: the food! 蔜here were 6 of us, and since we had just had dinner, we came for the desert... 蕀y wife got some frozen custard in a waffle cone... 蕂f course it was great! 蔍 had ... well, I dunno how to say it, much less spell it, but it was some thick hunk of waffle with the caramelized pearl sugar and belgian chocolate. 蔞ery tasty! 蔇uh, how could that description not be tasty... �I also got a ice mocha latte... �oh my my... 蔵t is made with belgian chocolate... 蔭ll I can say is ... 蔰ayum it was good!! 蔒y wife (the coffee snob) tried to take it from me, and generally I would give it to her, but not this time ... 蔍 would go back just for that!

The wait time is random like a ride in CA Adventures. The first time I went, it was close to 45 minutes and the second, well there was no wait. Both times, my husband and I shared one savory and one sweet. Since he's allergic to peanuts, the first time, we decided to go with the Bruxie Burger and the Strawberry Creme Brulee. Wow, it was so good! I had to try the dessert first. The waffle was still crispy when I took my first bite. So GOOD! Same goes for the burger. It's not what I was expecting but it was definitely tasty! The second time there, we went with some friends and secretly treated them for our one year anniversary. For most of them, it was their first time. Everyone wanted more even though they were already full. This time, instead of the Strawberry Creme Brulee, we got the Strawberry Cheesecake. Definitely not as good as the creme brulee. There's something about that creme brulee that is so addicting. We will definitely be going back! Missing one star because of the random wait time and not too much seating/parking.

Look. It tasted good. Sure. But if I spend seven bucks on a waffle it had better fill me up. I had to go back out and buy food again because I got home and found one puny little waffle in my bag and was still starving. The chocolate milkshake was worth it though.

This is one of those places that you drive by and think it might be good once, but then finally try and realize it might have just changed your life. Waffles go with everything. 蔒ushrooms, salmon, cheese, short ribs.... You name it and it taste great wrapped in a light, fluffy, somewhat heavenly waffle. 蔍've eaten about a third of the offerings at Bruxie's and have loved everything. 蔖ersonally the wild mushroom with arugula and goat cheese is my fav, but im a strange dude. �Now for the ladies, and yes this is a sexist comment but i truly believe most girls want to eat nothing but sweets. 蔒y little lady has swayed me into believe that. 蔄ll she ever wants is some kind of desert and this is where Bruxie really hits the bullseye. 蔅erries and Creme, Creme Brulee, seasonal shakes, it has it all. 蔜hey are super sweet, and just really really good. 蔍f you haven't ordered a treat, stop putting it off. 蔍ts the best thing at Bruxie. As far as the actual location; its small, there isnt a whole lot of the way in seating and the lines gets to be pretty damn long. 蔅e prepared to wait a while for your food and to possibly have to eat it standing. In short, this place rocks and you should eat till you get really, really disgustingly fat. 蔍f your going to blow up, you might as well make it tasty and fun. 蔔ow stop reading and go get a waffle, you know this review has made you hungry.

This place is just simply amazing. Everything from the little stands character to the customer service, to the yummy food! The only down side is the limited seating available not to mention difficulty in finding parking on the premise. Although you can just park in the nearby neighborhood and walk over so that's not a biggy. They have daily changing specials and i so far have not been disappointed with any of them. My favs so far have definitely been the savory short rib waffle along with the creme brulee sweet waffle for dessert. But coming in a close second definitely has to be the green eggs and ham waffle with the super aromatic basil filled flavor with each bite.

since i was in the area on a saturday morning, which is rare, i was finally able to come and try their waffle sandwiches after reading so many good things about it. its a sandwich stand....dont expect to come here and sit for a long time sipping on coffee. they do have seating alongside the building and some in their little parking lot with outdoor patio heaters (thank God!). when we got here around 9:30AM, there was a pretty descent line of people ordering/waiting/eating. we were lucky enough to snatch up a table right next to one of the patio heaters since it was a pretty chilly but sunny morning. i went for one of their daily specials, the green eggs and ham with arugula pesto and a cup of coffee. he had the infamous fried chicken and waffle and a side of waffle fries. my sandwich was absolutely delicious! but i was slightly disappointed with the fried chicken and waffles which i had a bite of cuz it was just too sweet for me. he wasn't impressed by it either =( these sandwiches are best when eaten fresh and warm. i couldn't finish my entire meal so i saved half for later....cold soggy waffles is no bueno. good place, good food, good atmosphere. expect to pay approx $10 per person (with a drink).

My cousin was graduating from Chapman University and we thought that we'll eat here 1st, before attending his graduation. We already expected the line to be a little long, so were not surprised to see a bunch of people already waiting in line as we pulled up. 蔜he parking is very limited here, so it's basically just street parking. We ordered the Chicken and Waffle and also the Waffle with Eggs and Bacon. 蔍 gotta say the Chicken and Waffle was a hit! 蔜he Waffle was not soggy and had the right texture to it. 蔜he chicken was tender and soft, with a light breading to it. 蔣ou take one bite of this, and you'll want to continue eating it. 蔍t's just that good. The Waffle with Eggs and Bacon was pretty good, but just not as good as the Chicken and Waffle. 蔜he Waffle with Eggs and Bacon may be suitable if you are in the mood for breakfast food, though. They do charge $1 extra for maple syrup (what a money maker!). Overall, a must visit place when you are in the Old Town Orange area.

My last visit here, the biggest gripe was that the waffle sandwich didn't fill me up. Well this time I made sure go big. Ordered their seasonal BBQ pulled pork waffle sandwich. This monster didn't fit in their usual paper wrapper. They had place it on a tray. It was thick, there was no way they could fold this thing. The upper part of the waffle was almost standing straight up! http://media1.ct.yelpcdn�It was juicy pulled pork topped with cole slaw. I loved the sweetness of it. I filled the rest of my tummy space with an egg cream soda. Guess what I did after this meal? ZZZZZzzzzzzz.....

Sunday, August 21, 2011 I'm so glad I came here try this place out. You do have to park on the street and you may not find parking at all actually. I thought we would have to wait FOREVER because the line was pretty long but it moved by pretty quickly. I think I waited about 10-15 min tops. Prettayy goood I'd say. I guess since it's hot in the summer, they turned on the water misters. I don't particularly enjoy all that mist on my face. I took cover haha. We ordered the Bruxie Burger ($6.95) and the Carolina BBQ Pulled Pork ($8.95). I was really debating about the waffle fries (criss-cut fries) but it's something that I've already had before so didn't think I needed to get it. It all came out to $17.13 with tax. There aren't too many seats. There are counters and high tables where you can eat standing up. I thought that was a good idea and enjoyed the new experience. They have a couple of condiments on the side of the restaurant like siracha, ketchup, etc. If you don't feel like ordering a drink, they provide a water bin there as well :) For such an outside eatery, it was pretty cleanly. I was impressed. Silly clean freak me. Anyway, big thumbs up on that. The Bruxie Burger was pretty good. I like how they 蕋hinly cut the vegetables and tomatoes so it doesn't bulk up the waffle sandwich too much. The meat is cooked medium well. The waffle is crisp and crunchy. I think I'm personally not all that into burgers that much, but if you are, it's all yours! My favorite was the Carolina BBQ Pulled pork. I think this is a seasonal item but I'm super super glad I got it. They give you a side of BBQ and more if you ask for it. Everything went together, the crispiness of the waffle, the sweet BBQ flavor, the coleslaw, and the savory, tenderness of the pork. Quite the catch! The juices do soften the waffle though so you must pick up the waffles quickly before they soak and become a soggy mess! The service was stupendous! Every few minutes, you see a server walk and ask you if everything is ok and take your empty tray right when you're done with it. Very attentive! Such nice servers as well! We had quite the surprise at the end of our meal. We were cleaning up when one of the servers brought us a mint chocolate chip shake! I was take aback because I didn't order it. The server said there was extra so he just gave it to us! Wow! What a lucky day for us! :) 4 stars only. I would have given five if I had liked the bruxie burger a little more, if there wasn't so much mist (I swear it's on MAX), and the sogginess from the juices. However, it was an enjoyable experience and an upgrade from fast food. I will come back to try the Buttermilk Fried Chicken!

Solid 3-star joint. Tried the Chicken and Waffle Sandwich - with Maple Syrup. $1 for a little jello shot sized cup of maple syrup... really... that's a bit steep. Glad I got it though because it would have been too dry and tasteless without it. The Prosciutto and Gruyere sandwich was tasty but not a very big serving. The whole grain dijon made it legit. Waffle fries were good, nothing special but tasty. Lemonade was very sweet and very tart. It needed to be cut a bit with water. $1 for a refill. We went when it was drizzling so there was no line. Outdoor seating ONLY. The parking situation is kinda sucky too. Overall, very pricey for what it was and the amount of food you got. Not the best place to go if you are super hungry and broke...

ONE OF A KIND I will probably never eat at another restaurant and enjoy the experience that is Bruxie. Parking is tight and we were lucky to find a spot behind the building. Waiting in line was like waiting in line for a roller-coaster in that the anticipation was building. Short line for a roller-coaster though. It was a hot day but the cloud of mist kept everyone in line cool. Menu was detailed. I went with what I knew I would enjoy, the Bruxie Burger and Black Cow drink. Why didn't I get fries? Maybe because the burger was filling enough. Bruxie Burger was dank and the Black Cow was meh. I hope to have many more one of a kind experiences at Bruxie.

It's not on that NYC Katz status, but still good nonetheless. Pros: - FOOD is deelish - The owner and staff are very friendly and helpful.

This place is the cutest place ever! Everyone is friendly and the atmosphere is so laid back. The food is really tasty but can start getting super sweet afterwards, so try their homemade sodas! Oh, and seating is sort of limited, so let a friend occupy a table while you're in line. ALSO, parking around this place is hell unless you know how to parallel park. DON'T PARK IN THE NEIGHBORHOODS because you'll get a violation like me :(

I finally tried this place after talking about it for months with my friend Keycee D. 蔍t's located in Old Town Orange which has a bunch of little shops and some homes that were turned into local businesses. 蔜he parking could be somewhat of a problem since there are only a couple of places on the Bruxie lot and the rest is street parking. 蔠hen we were approaching Bruxie I saw the line and there were about 30 people in line, which kind of worried me but the line went by pretty fast. Looking at the seating they have about four cocktail tables and about six booths that could fit 4-5 people a piece. 蔜hey also have a table for those that like to eat and run. �They have printed menus that you can look at while in line but you also need to check the chalkboards for their seasonal and specials. 蔠hile in line one of the employees took our order so that we would be ready to pay at the counter. 蔒y sister and I decided to half both the Bruxie chicken sandwich and the "Green Eggs and Ham" while my nephew ordered the Bruxie with bananas, nutella and cream. 蔠e also ordered the root beer and wild grape soda. 蔄fter paying for our stuff which came out to about $26 we found a seat. 蔠hen your order is ready, the waiters bring your food out to you which was about five minutes. We got our sodas first which were awesome! 蔜he grape soda tasted like a tootsie lollipop made into a soda and the root beer tasted old fashioned. 蔣ou can get refills for $1.00. 蔜he first thing I tried was the chicken and waffle sandwich, the piece of chicken they give you is huge! 蔍t's friend to the perfect crispiness and the sauce they use is a sweet spicy sauce which gives the chicken the right amount of flavor. 蔜he green eggs and ham was tasty as well, it came with about two slices of ham and the eggs are green because they are mixed with some type of herb, I'm not sure if its basil but it's G-O-O-D! 蔒y nephew wasn't able to finish his waffle so I got to try the banana, nutella and cream waffle and it was delicious! 蔍t's something so simple but so tasty. 蔒y friend also let me try the strawberry creme brulee waffle and that thing is delicious goodness! 蔍 was almost tempted to buy one myself but I was at a satisfied full. 蔍 will definitely go here again, the food is awesome and the customer service is on point! *No bathrooms *Accepts credit cards

I absolutely adore Bruxie - I've visited more than five times in the year I've known about it. 蔄fter sampling several waffles my favorites are definitely Nutella and Banana & the Bacon, Egg and Cheddar with a side of maple syrup. 蔜he Nutella and Banana Bruxie has sweet cream with a little tartness to it I just love. 蔜he bacon in the Bacon Egg and Cheddar Bruxie is diced, so no finicky mess to deal with. 蔜he maple syrup gives it the perfect salty-sweet combo. 蔍 always look forward to coming to Bruxie as the college town scene and friendly staff make for a great time. P.S. Do not fear the great long line! It gives you time to decide what you want and it moves pretty fast. 蔖lus on hot days in the summer, there's water misters along the roof that spray down over the line to keep you cool!

So after writing 2 reviews in the last year, Bruxie has brought me back. First and foremost, I am a hater. Can't stand hype or Laker fans, but this place was really good, and I didn't even get to try the fries! I was also half loaded but Liv E. dragged me out of my inebriated shell to sober up and get some good grub. Once I saw green eggs and ham and flashed back to my favorite Theodore Giesel novel, I knew that's what I had to start with. I also ended up eating half of her pulled pork which was also amazing, along with half a portion of their cheese cake option, though I think next time I'd opt for the creme brulee (based solely on recommendations). Five stars for a unique idea that's well executed! I will be back!

I no longer have to be jealous of those people who "checked in" at Bruxie and post it on FB! 蔅ruxie, I finally came for you and I heart you! I tried their Buttermilk Fried Chicken and Waffle, their seasonal Pastrami Waffle, Waffle Fries, and Vanilla Milkshake. 蔍 ate it ALL and did not share. After seeing what I just wrote, kind of grossed me out 蔲or about...3 seconds but OH WELL! I was surprised on how moist and crispy the chicken was. I kind of wish I tried it with their maple syrup but 蔳otta stay "healthy." Instead, I drizzled a little bit of their Chulopa Sauce and it made the chicken taste just as good. 蔜he coleslaw in the Buttermilk Fried Chicken was right on point. Not too sweet and not too bland. 蔜he pastrami was meaty, juicy, and well seasoned. 蔍 highly recommend people to get this. 蔎ust thinking about the pastrami made my stomach grumble. The potato waffles were cooked to perfection as well. I love how they provide different condiments. They even serve organic agave! 蔍 have a feeling that I'll be visiting Bruxie's very soon. Meaning...tomorrow...

Specialty waffle sandwich stand in old town Orange. 蔜he line can be long, but the servers are gracious and help the time go by a little faster. 蔒y favorite is their Green Eggs and Ham that is supposedly a limited time special, but it's been on the chalkboard menu for months. 蔋opefully it doesn't go anywhere! 蔍t's broiled egg, arugula, ham, and pesto sandwiched between 2 golden brown waffles. �The chicken & waffles is a classic favorite here! 蔒ake no regrets, and order it with syrup! 蔆hicken-y and sweet tasting meal. 蔍t all goes down great with their fresh strawberry lemonade. 蔍t all makes for a perfect summer meal =) For dessert, I've tried the peanut butter & bannana, Lemon Cream & berries, and the Strawberry Cheesecake. 蔄LL AMAZING. 蔍 guess you can't get it wrong with these combinations. �Before you decide to come here, MAKE SURE YOU GO TO THE BATHROOM beforehand because there are none here. 蔍 learned this the hard way: My first time here, I was in dire need of a bathroom. 蔠e waited a long time to order, and they unfortunately forgot our order. 蔜hey were very apologetic and made it up with a free strawberry lemonade and a bruxie sandwich of our choice. 蔒y bladder was bruised from holding it, but I will never forget such customer service =)

i'd give this place a 5 star if only they have a public restroom!!!!! yeah, they tell you to go across the street, downstairs to some library building that's supposedly for Chapman university students only... i guess if you have to go, then you could do that? i just wanted to wash my hands so i just used the drinking water they provided... :p i've wanted to try this place FOREVER... FINALLY! first of all, i don't even like waffle, but their waffle is AMAZING - it's even still crunchy/crispy when it's cold, how did they do that? we tried their 'signature' fried chicken and their daily special - pulled pork which they marinated since the night before (or so they say), they are both very very yummy! (i think the pulled pork is even better than the fried chicken!) fries was so yummy too that i almost didn't want to share... to my surprise that it's not heavy or greasy at all... i had half of the pulled pork, and half of the fried chicken and almost the entire order of fries - but i still wanted more! i can't wait to go back and try other items on the menu, and the sweet ones - s'more!!!!

I'm definitely a fan. The concept is interesting enough -- waffle sandwiches? As if I didn't love brunch already!!! I've only been here once, but once is enough to know this place has some awesome food. 蔍 was a sucker for the Smoked Salmon & Dill Cream Cheese waffle sandwich. 蔄ll the ingredients compliment each other to full perfection. I got a taste of my boyfriend's Buttermilk Fried Chicken and Waffle sandwich, and have got to say I liked his just a little bit more than mine. It was so full of flavor and tenderness. 蔜he extra maple syrup is necessary!! It's not the same without the sweet coating. �There isn't much seating area, and when there is, it's all outside. 蔛treet parking is usually available, so there's no need to skip out on Bruxie! 蔍 went with my boyfriend here for a dinner date, but later realized it was more of a snack date. 蔠e decided to get more food as the night went on. 蔍 have to say these are not completely filling but gives you a nice content feel. There's nothing much to say about service other than it was a little slower than I expected, but there was a line so maybe I'm just being an impatient hungry hippo. Overall, Food: unique, tasty, on the smaller side

S'mores Waffle: B, probably go with plain chocolate next time. frozen custard: B-, Hmmm...not what I was expecting based on my previous encounters with FC.

Best fried chicken & waffle I've had so far. Bruxie is located near Old Town in Orange, sorta in a residential area that has been converted for business. 蔜he spot is modeled more like a take-out/fast food joint with some tables if you wanted to eat there. 蔠e got there around noon on New Year's and we had to wait for about 30 minutes in line. 蔔ot bad not bad. Bruxie is known for the gourmet waffles, offering in a variety of ways. 蔛andwiches are the way to go here and all the sandwiches are done with waffles acting as the vehicle for whatever you choose. 蔍'm a huge chicken & waffles guy so I went for the Buttermilk Fried Chicken & Waffle, while my friends went for the Bacon, Egg & Cheddar and the Holiday. When I first saw the Buttermilk Fried Chicken & Waffle, I was quite surprised since it is this huge piece of boneless fried chicken with a thin glaze of chili honey, topped with super crunchy slaw, and sandwiched between two toasty waffles. 蔍 couldn't even describe how exciting it was when I picked it up and took that first bite and it went above and beyond what I had anticipated and totally destroyed my expectations! �蔙ather than hot sauce for the fried chicken, the chili honey goes so well with the chicken. 蔛weet but at the same time just a tiny tiny bit of heat to make it interesting. 蔜he cole slaw is creamy and cooling, with the crunch from the slaw adding a whole different dimension in terms of texture! 蔜he waffle is great and really is perfect for holding the chicken and the cole slaw 蕋ogether. The components of a classic fried chicken & waffle in each bite of the sandwich makes it an absolutely joy to eat! As for the Bacon, Egg & Cheddar (BEC), it is a perfect breakfast sandwich. 蔖eppered eggs cooked sunny side up with thick slices of bacon and sharp cheddar with waffles is a complete and legit breakfast. 蔄gain, classic flavors all in one bite. 蔍 even heard someone ordered it with pesto and I am definitely trying it that way next time. As for the Holiday, it was actually featured in a local newspaper! 蔖ulled pork with cranberry sauce & stuffing. 蔠hat?? 蔣es that sounds amazingly good and it even comes with a side of jus that is heavily flavored with all the familiar herbs present at holiday dinners. 蔜here's a huge amount of tender pulled pork and it was easily the biggest sandwich out of the three and if you didn't get enough of holiday flavors, then go and get it before they stop serving it as a special! You can order any of the sandwiches as a combo with waffle fries so that is what we did. 蔜he fries come in a little baggie and nothing too crazy about them. 蔍t was sorta lukewarm when we got ours. 蔍t doesn't come with a drink but if you're a fan of sodas, definitely get their old fashioned sodas. 蔄ll their sodas are sweetened with natural cane sugar. 蔍t is sweet but it never tastes overly sweet for some reason! 蔄wesome. Since I don't know when I'll be back in this area, I wanted to get something sweet and went for the Liege Waffle with Caramelized Pearl Sugar. 蔍 don't really know how to explain the Liege waffle except that it looks like a regular Belgium waffle, super buttery, denser, and crunchy. 蔜he sugar provides the crunch factor and if the sugar is not enough, you can choose between Nutella or Strawberry for additional flavor! 蔍 went for Nutella since I'm a sucker for it and I didn't want to be bothered while eating. 蔜he only reason I stopped eating the waffle was cause my friend ordered a soft serve so I asked if I could scoop some to add it to my Liege Waffle. 蔅esides ordering the fried chicken sandwich, that was probably the best idea all day. 蔍ce cream + waffle + Nutella = heaven. I must find another reason to head out to Orange. 蔍 must!

Okay, so I don't know what took me so long to try this place. Bruxie is freakin' fabulous! Yes, I know everyone has said it already, the Fried Chicken Waffle Sandwich is delicious...but the menu item that really has me salivating is the Irish Nachos. I'm not sure if this is a permanent fixture on the menu since it was a special they had the night I went. I hope that they will continue to make these for a loooong time. Irish Nachos were basically waffle (of course!) fries topped with a mixture of melted gruyere and cheddar, bacon bits, sour cream, green onions. oh my freaking goodness! It tasted so good I know for sure it was clogging up my arteries. Please do yourself a favor and go order yourself up some Irish Nachos from Bruxie.

This place was my very first bookmark when i joined Yelp! I am happy to say that i finally popped my Bruxie cherry!! And i think im in nerd for this place too! I decided to take Teri G along for the ride, since she is always down for a good foodie adventure with me! Directly right down the street from Chapman University, this place is small with limited seating and parking. Luckly we found a parking spot half way down the street by some cute shops. Walking is always a good thing anyways!! Arrived at Bruxie and a semi long line, no problem since we didnt know what we wanted it gave us time to look over the menu and make our final final decision (which i changed three times before settling on something). The guy at the order window was nice, welcomed me to Bruxie and asked my name and if it was for here or to go. Decided on getting: Smoked Salmon and Dill Cream Cheese Waffle-Herb Cream Cheese, Cucumbers. Waffle Fries with Ranch Teri Ordered the special's of the day: Carolina BBQ pulled pork Waffle Irish Nachos With our luck we found a place to sit and enjoy our dinner. Our waitress called both our names at the sametime, which was great (hardly a 5minute wait). 蔠aitress was urber friendly and asked if she could get us anything else. Which we said no, she said if we needed her she would be around with to-go boxes later if we needed some. I highly recommend the Smoked Salmon and Dill Cream Chesse waffle. The salmon was sliced perfect and was piled high, the dill cream cheese really complemented the sandwich nicely, cucumbers gave it an added crunch. Tryed some of Teri's irish nachos, those were probally the best i have had in awhile!!! And it had BACON on top!!! Oh, Bruxie i think this is a start to something wonderful :D

I've been hearing about this place for months, with fairly mixed reviews about it. Finally got to try it yesterday! I was pleasantly surprised that it was more like a food stand rather than a restaurant - located in the cute old town Orange area. I loved the casual ambiance and the super friendly waiters there. I tried the buttermilk fried chicken and waffle - this was good, but lacked a bit in flavor, definitely needs a little more oomph in sauce or something. Thank goodness they had sriracha around, which improved the sandwich a bit! Spicy and sweet! Or you can add $1 for the syrup for a little more sweetness, which I think a lot of people do. Also tried their Nutella & Banana Waffle which was delish! Personally believe that nothing can go wrong with nutella in general though :] Would definitely come again, I want to try their prosciutto and gruyere too.

Bruxie. How it's pronounced, I'm not really sure. "Brew-xie?" Bruck-see?" I'm not really sure what to say because there are more than 1,400 reviews before me! Let's see... Why do I give this place a 5 star? Hmm... 5 star because... 1. Outdoor seating! I love outdoor seating, especially in the beautiful Orange County. It's next to a University campus full of rich kids so it's not bad to people watch either. The weather is usually pretty nice and comfortable. If it's too hot, they have some intense misters to cool you down. 2. Cheap for what you get! Who doesn't like cheap food? My friends and I usually get a sandwich each (my favorite so far is the Battered Fried Chicken), some Irish Fries, and an Arnold Palmer (which is made with pink lemonade). It's usually under $20. 3. Fresh! So fresh, so hot. One thing I like about busy places like this is that the food is made to order. I haven't been had a meal here that taste like it's been sitting around. One time, I was having lunch here and a beetle flew into my food. The owner saw this happen and gave me a new meal for free. Too bad I had only taken two bites! lol 4. Awesome customer service! They sure know how to keep their guests happy and sometimes even entertained! Quick Tips: 1. Even if the Irish Fries are not on the menu, they can still make it but they might have to use cheddar cheese instead of the cheese sauce they normally make it with. 2. I hear they have good breakfast choices on the weekends. Come early and try it out, they open at 9am. 3. Street parking only. I park in the 30 minute parking and stay for an hour or so with no ticket. lol Would I come again? Yes, over and over.

I didn't know it was possible to get any better but Bruxie never disappoints. If you're a fan of their Facebook page they let you know what's the special of the day and for the 4th of July they had a Lobster Roll special. My cousins and I made sure to come by for lunch for the 4th we are big fans of their daily specials (if you ever see the pastrami it's a must try!) we had to try their lobster roll. We get there around noon and there was a well established line. At the end of the line was their outdoor set up where they had a large pot to boil the lobsters before taking them inside to assemble. It was a warm/hot day so some patio umbrellas were set up to provide some shade and additional round tables were set up for a much needed extra seating. We ordered the special of the day which was the lobster roll, waffle fries and their special black cherry coke for $17.76. You might think that's a lit' steep, but the lobster waffle was lightly dressed w/ a mayo dressing and large bite size pieces of lobster meat both a good mix of claw and tail meat filled the waffle to the brim!! It was some serious lobster fix!! It was delicious! Thinking of it, is making my mouth water!! They sold out of the lobster waffle, selling 203 of them!! I wish I ate 2/203 of those! I know better for next time! I really hope they do this again soon. I will make sure to come by and wait as long as it takes to get a waffle-gasm! Ha! Also had their special Red, white and blueberry dessert it was I believe strawberry, raspeberry, blueberry cheesecake waffle. 蔣ummm! **TIP: I don't like ordering dessert with my meal it always gets the waffle soggy by the time I'm eating my entree, and even though it's good it's just not as good with a fresh crispy waffle. And I know going back to stand in that massive line is a major turn off, but know that the service here is exceptional. Do no hesitate to wave down one of the waiters and kindly ask them to order your dessert. They'll take your order, payment and give it all back and it's only a matter of the short wait for the dessert.

Bruxie, you really blew it today. My friends and I were at Chapman College Saturday and were looking forward to some delicious waffles. As always, there was a sizable line around 11:40 AM, but after 20 minutes of waiting with very little line movement, we were restless and ready to leave. We had to be back at Chapman at 12:30. One of the female staff was moving down the line "taking orders" on paper guest checks. She wrote ours down and gave it to us, #209284. Five minutes after that, a male staffer showed up asking us if we, "had any questions." Heck yeah! 蔒y question was, "What is the deal today?" The staffer responded that their computer systems went down again and things are verrrry slow, almost at a standstill. Oh, now you tell us. He was ready to move along to ask the next group if they "had any questions," when I questioned him further, asking whether manual orders could be taken, with cash, so we could get back by 12:30. He shifted uncomfortably and said that he'd hate to tell us to come back later, but we weren't going to get served before 12:30. REALLY! He added that this happened a couple months ago and they were hosed then too. Managers/owners -- please take note: figure out a workaround or word will get out that you can't handle your business. Put up a sign that reads "cash only" and write orders down on paper. Point people to ATM machines. Hand out numbers. Restaurants can still function well enough doing things manually. So can you. We'll be back after you figure out your business-continuity plan.

OK, OK, my boyfriend and I were very excited to come here after reading the reviews! I mean VERY! We already knew it was not a sit-down place, so we ordered to-go. Waffles range from $6-9. In a nut-shell, it got 4 stars because the WAFFLES ARE SOGGY WITH BUTTER and THEIR DRINKS COULD BE WAY BETTER! We ordered 3 sandwiches (I posted pics): Green Eggs & Ham, Mushroom & Goat Cheese and the Seasonal Creme Brulee sweet waffle. We also had the waffle fries (DELICIOUSLY FLAVORED) and my boyfriend ordered an Egg Creme Soda Float (ABSOLUTELY GROSS, I'M NOT KIDDING!) But I am here to review waffle sandwiches: �I'm sorry, but we are not health freaks but we are health concious and the waffle was leaving shiny fingers and oil spots on the cardboard trays they give. 蔠e tried to suck it all out with napkins. I understand that that waffle needs to bend in order to make the sandwich, but it is so saturated in butter! HOWEVER, the actual ingredients inside were fantastic! 蔜he mushrooms were to die for and the goat cheese a nice addition to a rich sandwich. 蔜he green eggs and ham includes a pesto topping which makes the egg green and it was very tasty. I highly recommend the Seasonal Creme Brulee sweet waffle because that vanilla creme was so delicious with the strawberries! Reminded me of dulce-de-leche! Overall, we MIGHT COME HERE AGAIN, but it will not be a food we crave because of the fatty-soggy waffles.

Met up with my friend Thu D. to see what the Bruxie hoopla has been all about. 蔜hursday evening and there was a pretty good sized crowd around. 蔉ortunately we sped through the line to order and the food came out just as quickly. I had the prosciutto and gruyere waffle which was pretty good. Bruxie's waffles has nice, fluffy yet crispy consistency. My friend had the chicken and waffle sans slaw which was also pretty good. The chicken was nice and moist and came with a side of syrup. In my opinion, the portion seems rather small - we ended up heading over to Haven for another meal - but otherwise, Bruxie would be a perfect choice for breakfast or lunch.

This place is really amazing. Yes, they usually have a line, but both times I've gone, I didn't have to wait more than maybe 15-20 minutes. I just went for the second time yesterday, and I tried the Seasonal Creme Brulee waffle with strawberries ($6.50). So good! The cream they use is nice, not too sweet, but not bland by any means. They use chunky, raw sugar and caramelize it, adding a great, crunchy texture and making the waffle taste more like the dessert it's named after. To top it all off, they use fresh strawberries, not some crappy syrup or too-sweet preserves. In addition to my waffle, I tried their seasonal strawberry shake ($4.95). You can tell that they use fresh ingredients, and the fact that they use custard in their shakes instead of ice cream makes them all the more tasty. From what I've experienced, Bruxie is well-deserving of all the hype they've gotten. Amazing food that is reasonably priced, what more can you ask for?

My first time at Bruxie was a loooong time coming. Everywhere I turned, people were telling me how amazing it is. And, I am happy to say, it wasn't over hyped. A unique twist on the waffle made this a great Sunday breakfast/brunch. I got the Bacon, Egg & Cheddar and it was a breakfast party in my mouth. A little heavy-handed on the bacon (I never though it was possible.), but super delicious. I appreciated the proper egg to waffle ratio - it exactly fit the whole of the waffle, so no bite was egg-less. �My husband got the Buttermilk Fried Chicken & Waffle and, it too, was delicious. The chicken was amazing just by itself, but perfectly complemented by the coleslaw and waffle. Honestly, before coming here, I thought this sounded gimmicky - some food you'd get at the fair (deep friend butter, kool-aid, Snickers, etc.) and then regret later when it reeked havoc on your stomach. I am pleased to say it's delicious and not overly sweet. Understand that this isn't the lightest meal you'll ever have, but it's certainly not in the realm of, say, a Twinkie and ding dong deep fried sandwich. The minus one star was the price - it was $17 for two breakfast sandwiches and a coffee, which to me is a little pricey.

Brought my family from San Jose and Indiana here last night and it was an instant hit!! In total we had eight Bruxie Burgers, four S'mores, four Waffle fries, three Chicken & Waffles, one Smoked Salmon, Irish Nachos and a frozen custard! Everyone loved everything that was ordered! They loved it so much that they went back today and brought more of our family from out of town (I was at school). We've got more family coming in from the Bay Area and quite a few flying in from Atlanta and they're all foaming at the mouth to try some Bruxie goodness! btw, I'm in charge of the meal itinerary for about 40 out-of-towners, so I don't know how I'm gonna top Bruxie. Maybe we'll just keep coming back!

WHAT. A. TREAT. Waffles, no matter who makes it, are amazing, but Bruxie took it to another level and made it into sandwiches! If the concept didn't make your mind explode, their food will! The first waffle sandwich I tried was the Smoke Salmon & Dill Cream Cheese with Herb Cream Cheese, Cucumbers, and Chives. Maybe I was hungry because it was past 1PM and I only had a homemade PB&J sandwich for breakfast, but WOW. That first bite turned my mind off and I was in foodtopia. I generally don't like smoke salmon, but this, this magnificent design of a sandwich was simply a work of perfection. 蔊ET IT, EAT IT, and INDULGE. The second waffle sandwich I tried was their seasonal selection: Carolina BBQ Pull Pork. I was hesitant when I first ordered this because my friends have been telling me to get the Fried Chicken & Waffle since it is their main item. But the manager/owner convinced me to get the pull pork because it is a seasonal selection and Fried Chicken will always be there. This succulent and sweet piece of meat sandwich was shoved into my mouth so fast my wife thought they'd forgotten my order. I am giving this review base on my To-Go orders ONLY. Think about what I would say if I had it on the spot! Hot, steamy, crispy... yumm..... GO AND GRAB YOURSELF A WAFFLE SANDWICH! TIP: ORDER SEASONAL MENU ITEMS BEFORE ANYTHING ELSE. All seasonal menu items are on the black board on top of the cashier.

After hearing about this place for over a year, I finally went and tried it. BOOM! It was really, really good. Place is a nice little shack with outside seating in Old Town Orange. It was a hot day, but the shade provided and the misters provided a nice cool place to eat outside. It was very picnic-like. Order your grub, find a table, wait for the serves to call out your name and get down with some waffles! Onto the food!!! Carolina Pulled Pork Waffle - sauce was tangy, vinegar cooked into the pork, juicy. Tasted really good. Not the best pulled pork ever, but it was better than the average BBQ joint in SoCal and the slaw & waffles with it was great. I'm one of those people that actually prefers the savory. I like it contrasting against the sweet(ish), buttery, crispiness of the meat. Just titillates 3/4 of your palatte all at once. Strawberry Cheesecake Waffle - another really good bite. The strawberries really dominate the flavor of this dish; fruit and reduction. However, those bites where you get the cheesecake, pie crust, and strawberries along with crispy waffle are heavenly. Drinks - sodas here aren't large factory made productions, but smaller local makers. Real sugar, more flavor, a little sweeter than the normal flavor or coke or sprite. I had the vanilla cream soda. My finace doesn't usually like it that much, but she did dig this one. Overall, very good joint. We were tempted to get back in line (because there wasn't one anymore) and order something else just to try it. We were able to resist because once we moved, we realized we were actually quite full. I am a waffle lover (aka not fond of pancakes) and I loved the waffles here. The batter was tasty on its own. It was crisp, not too thick, not too thin. It had a buttery flavor that was in the waffle, not like butter added on after the fact. I could eat those waffles all day on its own. I'll definitely be back.

I've had this place bookmarked for a while and today I dragged a very waffle loving coworker out for lunch. �We got there and can see the long line as we looked for parking. 蔊ot one fairly quick though. 蔜ook a look at the menu and the guy taking the order shared with us the daily special. 蔜hey had pulled pork on the menu and I was really thinking about getting it but stuck with my original pick of the Prosciuto & Gruyere. 蔒y friend got the Bacon, Egg and Cheddar and we both shared the Irish Nacho's which is special right now. Also got lucky in getting a table to sit at which we were happy about. 蔜he food came and before I looked up to say "wow these look great" my friend had already opened his maple syrup drizzled it on his waffle and was full on taking a bite. 蔕oo and Aaaaing with his mouth full LOL. 蔍 took a bit of mine and was thinking something is missing??? 蔠hat is it??? 蔍 couldnt figure it out until half way through it I finally got the bite I was first expecting, the mustard. 蔍t only made it to one side of the waffle and therefore the side I started on didnt get the full flavor combination. 蔔ext time I will have to open it up and spread it around. �The Irish nachos on the other had was off the hook yummy! 蔔ot drizzled with a lot of sauce but with a bit of sour cream, some kind of cheese sauce, bacon and chives. 蔍t was freaking good. 蔇ipped some in the maple syrup and that gave it another flavor dimension. �Not a big wow factor for my wafflewich but the Irish Nachos kicked it up to a 4 star.

Too much hype. While waiting in line, I had my heart set on the Buttermilk Fried Chicken & Waffle, but while scanning the area for my 'future order' the chicken looked a little dry. So I quickly changed my order to a burger with the intention that "you can't go wrong with a burger." I was RIGHT you can't go wrong with a burger, but it was lacking that "WOW" factor. The Bacon, Egg & Cheddar, again no "wow" factor. Unless we drenched it in syrup. Nutella & Bananas- delicious but, I could make it at home. On a side-note customer service here was AMAZING! Friendly, quick and on top of their game. I will be coming back, only because my boyfriend still wants to try it... hopefully I'll find that "WOW" factor that I am looking for. But for now I am sorry Bruxie, you're only getting three stars... till my next visit.

This place blew my mind!! Stood in line for a quick 20 minutes while drooling over the menu, thankfully the food was well worth the wait. My husband ordered the chicken waffle sandwich (with extra maple syrup) while I ordered myself the mushroom and goat cheese waffle (added the sun dried tomatoes too!) Seating was a difficult situation, especially with my 2 year old scrambling for her nutella and banana waffle, but we managed to snag a seat. �Overall we will definitely be back to dine at Bruxie again, this place totally changed our mind on what makes a sandwich good.

Not much needs to be said about Bruxie that hasn't been said in the other 1,000+ reviews. It's good and tasty. 蔠e came here after running the Disneyland 1/2 Marathon and I was expecting a long line and something heavy. �The line was maybe 5 deep so we didn't wait very long. �We order the buttermilk fried chicken and seasonal creme brulee with figs waffles. 蔅oth were surprisingly light or lighter than I expected and delicious. �I would love to come back and try something different but there is no way I driving all the way from Santa Monica. 蔒aybe after next year's Disneyland 1/2 Marathon.

I'd like to think that I discovered this place before all the hype, but not sure if that's really true or not. Used to live near here so it was a lot more convenient to go then. Unique concept - waffle sandwiches, and lots of different savory or sweet choices. I've had the short rib one and the fried chicken one, which were both tasty. The custard and the shakes are to die for! Downside is that it's pretty much a free standing shack - not an actual restaurant space. Be prepared to wait in a line to order your food and probably wait some more for a table. Mostly small tables that hold 2 - 6 people max or standing room. Can be hard to come with a group larger than 6 people. The staff is very friendly and helpful. Oh and there are no restrooms available, so you'll have to walk down a block to use other restaurant/stores' facilities.

Parking is pretty annoying and during busy hours, the food comes out kind of slow... there's also like less than ten tables so basically, coming here involves some kind of wait. I'd say that the waffles were GOOD but did not live up to its hype. The Pastrami sandwich and the smoked salmon ones are delicious! I thought the fried chicken waffle was good but a bit dry. Can't wait for the Brea location to open so I can try the sweet flavors. Hopefully, they will open my eyes to the gloriousness that is Bruxie!

Bruxie has been on my to-do list for a while now and I am happy to check this one off the 'ol list. Being late night I of course only tried the dessert waffles. The first one was the nutella and banana. This one was not as magical as I was expecting. I would have like to see a lot more nutella in the mix...oh well, just something I will ask for next time. The white cream that was inside of it also didn't go too well with it either. Next I tried the creme brulee. This one was top notch. It was just the perfect amount of sweetness with some fresh cut up strawberries inside. I can see myself getting this one again. Last, I was given a free cheese cake. i know right?! My first time there and the dude who is packing up the bags hooks it up with a freebie! So they may have made an extra one and it was close to closing...beside the point. That was really nice of him to do. This one was decent. I was expecting a little more sweetness to it that I didn't get. Don't get me wrong though, it was good with the fresh strawberries and cool cheese cake. In the end Bruxie is finally off of my list. Not the experience I was expecting, but nonetheless a much anticipated one. This is a place I will try again with other friends. Mainly because while waiting in line I was checking out some of the other savory waffles. I think Chubert needs to try one of those fried chicken waffles....

One of the few establishment I have bookmarked for far too long. One random day my yelp buddy and I decide to go, Surprisingly its her first time also. Bruxie is an outdoor restaurant and is located across from Chapman University. Why is this important? Well Chapman charges students for parking thus parking is scarce here during lunch rush hour. I luckily found parking on the street next to the restaurant. However you are required to have a residential parking permit also. Luckily Where I sat I can see if campus security or local law enforcement are approaching my car. I wanted to try the Fried Chicken and waffles here like everyone has mention about however we end up getting the two sandwiches that were "Seasonal" Albacore Tuna Waffle Sandwich: The waffle itself wasn't as crispy as I imagine. The tuna it self was at room temperature. I hope this is not the case in how they store their tuna. Pastrami Sandwich: Was the better of the two sandwiches. It was moist and tender. The seasoning of the pastrami complements the waffle. Creme Brulee Sandwich: Not the typical creme brulee taste you would expect. The custard/strawberries/and cinnamon made it a scrumptious dessert to have after downing them other sandwiches. Waffle Fries/Soda Pop: Waffle Fries was nothing too special however the soda pop is made of real cane sugar. You can really taste the difference compare to the usual soda pop you get from a bottle or fountain. This place overall was okay. I probably wont comeback because of the sub par food and horrible Hollywood/LA like parking.

Bruxie--tiny, cute, and quaint with only limited outdoor seating available. 蔐ucky for us, we came here on a Monday morning so seating was not a problem, nor was there a horrendous line of people trying to consume some of this deliciousness. �I ordered the Bacon, Egg & Cheddar waffle, and a small Belgian mocha. 蔍 loved the crispy crunchy texture for the waffles. 蔍 really enjoyed my waffle sandwich, I only wished that I would have requested that they hold the mayo. 蔍n all fairness, the guy taking my order did let me know in advance that there is a light layer of mayo--me being stubborn, I wanted to see what the sandwich taste like in its "original" form so I said okay to the mayo (I must note that I'm not the biggest fan of mayo). 蔜he Belgian mocha was good but a bit too strong for my taste, but I've always been a bit of a weak sauce when it comes to Mr. Pete's coffee. My friends ordered the Chicken & Waffles, and the Green Eggs and Ham Waffle sandwich. 蔍 didn't try their food but they said the Chicken & Waffles was good, and the Green Eggs & Ham was interesting--good interesting I'm assuming. �For a place that only has outdoor seating, and where you have to order your food at the counter, I was really surprised by the service that they offered. 蔜hey have a worker standing outside asking if you have any questions about the menu before walking up to place your order. 蔈veryone that worked here was super friendly and all had a sincere smile on their face--I find that hard to come across nowadays, and it really made my experience here more enjoyable. �Bruxie was definitely worth the hype. 蔍 even got commended by my friend for doing a good job on choosing a breakfast place!! �Bruxie, hopefully we'll meet again soon.

I'll start by saying, "YES, waffle sandwiches are delicious! 蔭nd NO! 蔜his place is NOTHING like Roscoe's!" Bruxie has got to be one of the most unique and well run establishments that I've been to in a while. 蔉rom my first taste, I was hooked (not that I'm trying to hype this place up, just see for yourself). From the moment you walk up you'll be greeted by enthused staff and the all too pleasing "bakery" smell that just reels you in. 蔜he savory waffles here are nice and crispy on the outside, soft/moist on the inside and ALWAYS warm. �Note: 蔠hile to go orders may be revived in the toaster oven, I highly suggest eating on the patio. Thus far I've had the pleasure of trying: Bruxie Burger (nice and beefy) Fried Chicken and Waffle (crispy, juicy goodness) Roasted Mushroom with Goad Cheese + Sun Dried Tomato (the tomatos make it POP!) Pulled Pork (excellent bbq sauce accompanies this) Short Rib (like grandmother's pot roast) Smore Waffle (eat it RIGHT when it comes out! 蔠ho said dessert 1st was a bad idea?)

I always ride my bike or drive by this place. Never got the chance to go but on friday during the old town orange street fair we walked down the block and came for a small meal. Ordered some dessert which was the Fruit of the month in a waffle with some burnt sugar and creme. PRETTY DELICIOUS i must say. the line looked long, but food came very quick and the server was very helpful with everything we needed. I wont be eating here all the time, but i will come back and visit and try their full meal waffle sandwiches.

Today was my third time here =) The second time, my boyfriend and I got the exact same things (SMOKED SALMON & DILL CREAM CHEESE and PROSCIUTTO & GRUYERE with a side of WAFFLE FRIES and iced tea) with an extra LEMON CREAM & BERRIES off of their sweet menu. I would have gotten more of the same this time too but I told myself as fabulous as those all are, I needed to try more of the Bruxie menu. I ordered the WILD MUSHROOM & ARUGULA with a side of WAFFLE FRIES and a DULCE DE LECHE shake. The wild mushroom & arugula was sooooo good! I never knew I could like a vegetarian sandwich so much... They really pack in the mushrooms (big, juicy pieces) and arugula. The goat cheese is perfectly melted and mixed with the balsamic reduction to make a creamy and tangy spread that is pronounced with every bite. Although stuffed, the sandwich tastes rather healthy and light. It will make you full though! I was starving and could only finish 3/4th of it. Soooo delicious, I'm going to have so much trouble choosing between this and the smoked salmon the next time I come. The fries this time were not as crispy as before and appeared to be thicker. Still very fresh though. The dulce de leche shake was toooo sweet for my liking and... EXPENSIVE. That's $4.95 I won't be spending again. It didn't go well with my meal at all... made me regret not getting the iced tea again (so refreshing!) or trying their strawberry lemonade, but thank god for the complimentary water station! The lemon cream & berries from last time was pretty good too but I think I'll stick to the savory items here or try the ogura waffle instead. mhmmm ashiun. Yaaaay Bruxie, thanks for a great 3rd date =) If it weren't for the distance, I'd totally go steady with you!

I write this from a ex-regular customer. Bruxie was much better when it first started. At least that is how I feel. First, let me say that Bruxie waffles taste good. It is the kind of food that you can have often; similar to any types of sandwiches. The food is light, so you won't be getting the food coma afterward. Second, the service is really good. They always have someone there to help and after a few times people will begin to remember you. However, those are the two good aspects. I think that Bruxie is extremely overpriced. $10 waffles that really doesn't look it should cost that much. Does it taste good enough to be $10? NOPE! it doesn't THAT good. Bruxie is also very inconsistent. Sometimes the waffle will be too wet, oily, or sometimes too crispy or too hard. Sometimes there might be too much mushroom, too much veggie, too much cream, and other times there will be little mushroom. Those two negatives has stopped me from going there. I have nothing against this place, but I really don't care to go. I personally prefer many other restaurants nearby that are consistent and has good value for price. The best thing about Bruxie is that it is convenient for me since i go to Chapman.

There's a party in my tummy! So yummy, so yummy!! lol. If you don't get it watch this: http://www.youtube.com/w� Anyways. Went here for a quick dinner with the bf. We've been meaning to go here and I'm glad we finally did. The waffles were delicious! Crispy, light, and buttery. The place is small, but its in such a cute area! There was a small line when we got there around 6:30, but I think that's normal. We ordered a buttermilk fried chicken and waffle and a smoked salmon & dill cream cheese from the savory side and a liege waffle from the sweet side. I also couldn't resist the strawberry shake, and the bf got a pure cane sugar cola. Since it was kinda busy we decide to just stand at the bar area on the side and we got our food and drinks within a few minutes (maybe 10 minutes?). �The food was more than enough for the two of us and we ate it all! The chicken and waffle had a good balance of sweet and buttery waffle and savory crispy chicken. My salmon and dill cream cheese was like a smoked salmon bagel but way better. As for dessert, the liege waffle was a nice finish to our meal with the nutella on the side. The cola isn't the same as coke, but its still good and the strawberry shake was super sweet, a little too sweet. Overall, I definitely would come back here, it's a unique place with good food. I want to try other waffle (savory and sweet). Until next time Bruxie.

I LOVE THIS PLACE!!! I've tried pretty much everything on the menu. It's amazing from sweet to savory. However, I recommend the chicken & waffle. It's so oddly delicious. All of the sweet waffles are genius. I haven't been disappointed by any of them yet. This is definitely one of my favorite places. It's a great atmosphere. The seating is outside right on Chapman campus (which is beautiful) and students walking to and fro. I love it.

After hearing several of my friends trying out this place - and loving it! - I finally got a chance to check it out for myself and I wasn't dissappointed!! What makes this place so good is the light, crispy texture of their waffles themselves. 蔄s a result, most of the ingredients you find on the menu just help to bring them to another level. However, I'm only giving it a 3 star because although the guyere & proscuitto & the buttermilk fried chicken were absolutely delicious, the "liege" was seriously under par. 蔄pparently the "pearl sugar" coating only served to take away frommthe light, crispy texture I mentioned earlier, leaving it a heavy, chewy brick. 蔛kip "The Liege" and try the rest.

TOTALLY LIVED UP TO THE HYPE ! I'm the last of everyone I know to have tried this place. And I learned that I've totally been missing out. It's located where Orange Street Fair is (but that's only once a year). I didn't realize it was in this area...which is a really cute, historic looking street. I thought parking would be bad, but it turned out that I got to park right in front ! amazing ! =) My friend & I ordered the Bruxie Burger and the ChickenWaffle, and split it. And the waffle fries. Bruxie Burger...the hamburger patty was soo juicy and good. The meat is cooked medium rare-medium? sooo bomb. The ChickenWaffle one was my favorite though. The syrup wasn't overpowering, and the chicken was really tender, and everything went really well together ! Waffle fries were good, nothing out of the ordinary. They were criss-cut. The people who work here are really friendly, and helpful too. They have tables outside, and they clean it up well for you. Must come back here.

I took my first bite, I said 'awe man'...Second bite 'awe man'...wifey interrupts me, asks 'what's wrong?' while I'm chewing 'awe man'...next bite 'awe man'...this is all I said while I devoured my Salmon with dill cream cheese waffle treat. *Green eggs (w/ pesto sauce) and ham* 蔳ave me burps with a hint of heartburn but very damn good. Not on the regular menu. Place for seating (if you get there early) don't worry it won't take you long to make your sandwich disappear. Waitress greets you in line and introduces their specials for the day. Asked if it was our first time and if we had any questions about the menu. Usually gives the special of the day. Waffle is crisp & not greasy! go early to get a seat won't take you more than 30 minutes to finish your meal unless you're hangin' out w/ friends. Don't recommend going during peak periods as parking nearby might be an issue but walking isn't so bad around Old Town Orange Update: I've been eating breakfast, lunch, snack, & dinner here often & can't seem to get sick of it.

I've been wanting to try this place for awhile and surprisingly, it exceeded expectations! 蔍 came on a Tuesday for lunch and there was no wait - I ordered and got my waffles all within 5 minutes. My friend and I decided to try one sweet and one savory to get a taste of everything. �The Buttermilk Fried Chicken & Waffle with chili honey and coleslaw ($6.95) was unexpectedly light and airy! 蔜he chicken was lightly battered and incredibly moist and juicy. 蔜he waffle held up the chicken well, but you have to eat it pretty quickly because it does get soggy after awhile due to the heat and moisture from the chicken. 蔜he coleslaw added a refreshing crunch to this otherwise heavy (but not heavy tasting) dish. Ogura Bruxie ($4.95) - I opted for this Asian waffle rendition because I'm a sucker for anything with red beans in it. 蔜his waffle is described as an Asian Original with red bean and sweet cream. 蔜oo much cream and not enough red bean... still tasty nonetheless, but I think I can recreate this at home. The staff here are really nice and informative. 蔜here is no indoor seating, but there is plenty of table seating outside. 蔍 love the vibe this place gives off - casual, relaxed... the perfect California getaway.

Wow! I didn't really think this was going to taste that good. My friend raved about this place but I wasn't feeling sure that I'd like chicken and waffles or any other kind of waffle sandwiches. 蔅oy was I wrong!!! 蔍 sampled a bit of my friends chicken and waffle and my other friends egg, bacon, and waffle sandwich. 蔒mmm.... I love the sweeter stuff so I decided to try the banana nutella waffle sandwich. 蔣um. Yum. YUM!!!! 蔍 want to go back to try out the other stuff on the menu!!! 蔇efinitely a must try place! Outdoor seating has limited tables though where you can sit down and eat, but they do have free standing tables ... seems like the crowd comes in swarms but if you don't mind the weather out, you would enjoy the outdoor eating atmosphere.

Every time I come here It looks like they keep improving the atmosphere, more seating/benches and they even have nice misters setup for the hot days of standing in line. This place never seizes to amaze my taste buds. Last time I had the pulled pork and orange sugarcane soda. This time I had the buttermilk fried chicken and waffles as well as the Bruxie burger and fries with a fresh strawberry shake. I also ordered a Lemon cream and berries for the road and that was amazing as well! Wish they had more locations closer to where I live.

Great concept for a restaurant, but you're basically paying $7 for a snack that doesn't completely fill you up. The lemon creme and seasonal berries was perfectly sweet and tart, and the Smoked Salmon & Dill was a great twist on a usual bagel classic because the crunchiness of the waffle balanced the creaminess of the salmon and 蔰ill cream. Don't forget to wash it all down with the Black Cherry soda! As for the Buttermilk and Chicken Waffle, it was nicely fried but a tad bit dry, so I came up with a solution: Eggo waffle + KFC chicken + KFC coleslaw= very cheap & satisfying alternative.

When my cousin and her husband suggested this place, I must admit I was skeptical at first. I've never been a big fan of sweet and savory (yuck, mcgriddle sandwiches) and when I eat chicken & waffles, I eat them separately. But, I was game to try anything and I was hungry. We got to Bruxie and the line wasn't too long. We found a table and ordered within 10 minutes of arriving... very lucky. The food came out quickly and I was pleasantly surprised! We ordered: two pulled bbq pork waffle sandwiches and two fried chicken waffle sandwiches. The fried chicken waffle sandwich was surprisingly juicy and not too overwhelming. I forgot to order the syrup, so that might have made the sandwich go from good to amazy. The pulled bbq pork sandwich had really tasty pork and a slightly sweet/spicy bbq sauce on the side. Mmmmm so good. The only downside is that this place is pretty pricey. Breakdown: 2 pulled pork sandwiches 2 chicken sandwiches 2 orders of waffle fries 1 strawberry lemonade 1 black cherry soda Total cost: $45

I wanted to check out what the hype was about Bruxie and it sure lived up to its hype! We checked out this place on a Saturday and parked in Old Town Orange and walked a block over to Bruxie. I really like the feel of the area. Once we arrived, we were greeted, asked us if we had any questions, and also given a menu. We ordered a black cow float, a smoked salmon & dill cream cheese waffle, a Bruxie hamburger, and also a lemon cream & berries waffle. Yep, we went all out! Since we don't usually head that way, figured to try what we could. The seating is a bit limited, but there are some tables where you can stand and eat. Also, there is no restroom for public use so make sure you don't wait till you get there. Every ingredient was so fresh and though the portions may not look big, don't be fooled! They sure fill you up! The lines never dwindled down while we were there, it just kept adding! The service is awesome! They are so attentive and kind. It's such a rarity since customer service has gone down these days at most places. Most definitely would love to come back here again! Can't wait until the new location opens up in Downtown Brea since it'll be closer to where I live!

Bruxie makes me seriously reconsider why I ever declined that acceptance to Chapman Law. Now, I am ashamed to admit that I've totally logged like three check-ins a week at this place before. How can you resist a little Peets Coffee with a crunch waffle smeared with fresh cream and jam. Yum! Since I have extensively sampled their menu, I must say that Bruxie is very consistent in quality and taste. I am in L-O-V-E with the fried chicken and waffles with the chili honey--tastes even better with that spicy Thai cock sauce. The arugula, balsamic reduction mushroom and goat cheese waffle isn't bad either. Definitely the best veggie treat out there. I also quite enjoyed the cheesy Bruxie (gueyere & cheddar) with added bacon and tomatoes. Anything off their menu topped with a real cane sugar cola is almost heaven. Can't wait to try the frozen custard, tomorrow. Fun factoid, the owner was super friendly, standing outside greeting people and answering questions. He said that he almost picked the SF Ferry Building as a location. And btw, I really really appreciate the compostable boxes, utensils, and cups. It's nice to see the trend gaining a stronghold in the land of raised trucks and blonde is blonder.

Green Eggs and Ham with Arugula Pesto, Mayo, and Cheese ($6.95) -One of their several specials for today and I opted for this over the pulled pork. -It's the breakfast burrito of the waffle world and just as Americanized. -By "Green Eggs," they mean "one jumbo egg" x "green arugula pesto." -There was a huge slice of ham in it (Canadian style?) and it was cut. -I would've opted for a little more pesto to balance the flavors out. -It was still phonetically dee-lish-oooos and I liked the overall texture. -I'm a sucker for breakfast, eggs, ham, and waffles. �-Whoa, this had all of them. Prosciutto & Gruyere with Whole Grain Mustard and Chives ($6.95) -The mustard didn't overpower the prosciutto and gruyere, however, a little did go a long way. -I would've wanted more prosciutto because it's a delicate tasting meat, but I'm a guy and obviously a carnivore. Lemon Cream & Berries with Intense Lemon Cream w/Seasonal Berries ($5.95) -Strawberries, Blackberries and Raspberries: 蔜riple Threat Check! -It's not as intense as you think it is, but it's pleasantly tart and the waffle provides a perfect counterpoint. -This tasty pastry felt more French than Belgian. �-Give me more. Strawberry Shake ($4.95) made with California Strawberries in Season -It was thick as an In-N-Out shake, but with real bits of fresh strawberries and went down as easy as Lance Armstrong cycling down a mountain with no brakes in a race against toddlers in trikes. �-It wasn't too sweet, left a very clean aftertaste, which led me to believe it was all natural and fresh. -It was quite possibly one of the best shakes I've ever had. Bruxie's service is marvelous. 蔍 went around 12:10pm today and I got to the front of the line of about 35 people in 15 minutes. 蔜he cheeky guy taking orders was partly responsible, as was the cheery cashier lady and all their cheesy melting waffle griddling cooks. �Order Taker Dude was knowledgeable about the menu and helpful in all respects like talking about what I got at The Bruery (a beer brewed with maple syrup and oak cubes, no less!), calling out and giving orders, and dishing out verbal (as opposed to monetary) tips. The creative owner behind all this (as told to me by Order Taker Dude) walked down the line and he joined in on many conversations too, getting menus for a few of the menu-less. 蔋e was probably taking a break from cooking, unless he just likes wearing a chef's uniform at all times. A few notes: �-They accept cards. -HOLD IT!! 蔔o bathrooms. -Plates, bags, forks, knives, and other utensils are all biodegradeable. -I parked for free (3 Hour Limit) on the West side of Orange near Chapman, but most street parking (if you can find it) should do. -The waffles can get a bit oily at times, but fortunately, it doesn't drip. -These waffle sandwiches disappear into my cavernous mouth way too fast. To end on a high note, Bruxie, you're winning me over one star at a time and I'm afraid Yelp might not be able to contain you the way your one waffle envelopes all these luscious ingredients.

If you dislike waffles, I'm forever grateful. I'd rather see the line here diminish, and never return. I tried the fried chicken, and burger. Both were a perfect medley, and made my palate titillate. The waffle has a perfect crunch, and the center is a bit chewy. Even after cooling down, it was just as tasty. They have a great batter here. It seems like the frozen custard isn't really a focus here. It's a treat you can find all over the East Coast, and there's hardly any here. It boggles my mind. It's better than frozen yogurt, and ice cream. Thank you for having this. It brings tears to my eyes. The service is amazing, and everyone here was more than willing to dote. It was almost a bit overbearing. They'll ask you, .392282 seconds before you're done, if they can clear your tray; then they'll ask some more. It's better to have, than not, I suppose. The neighborhood is quiet, quaint, and parking is easy to find. There also seems to be other things to explore, in the immediate area. It's a nice place to walk around, and check out. My gf said, "this is what I imagined every American town would resemble." I really hope you open one in LA. I'll be your best friend.

I was really excited to be eating here. And even more so because I went with a fellow foodie friend! I already looked at the menu ahead of time, though I already knew that I was getting the buttermilk fried chicken and waffles. I also got the strawberry creme brulee. The parking wasn't that bad. The lot was full, but the street also provided a lot of available spot. So this is how ordering works. You order in one window (they will also ask for your name) and you sit. When they are done with your order they will yell out your name and when you raise your hand, they will hand deliver your order to you. The venue was small, offering about 7 tables next to the order window, and then an additional stand only tables and a couple of benches on the other side of the lot. The service here was top notch; the waiters are attentive to your needs as a table unit. Now the piece that I have been waiting for, the chicken and waffles. I ordered an additional supplement of syrup and it did NOT go to waste. I went to town on that soft, light, and crispy waffle. The chicken was a nice savory component. There was also some flakes of what looked like cole slaw (more of an aesthetic than for taste). All the chicken used here is white meat, which made me sad (white meat in my opinion has less flavor than dark). They also lightly fried the chicken. When I eat fried chicken I want it SOAKED in oil and I have to know that it might kill me at any time - THAT is perfect fried chicken. It was overall a good-not-great waffle chicken combo. A fair savory waffle. What became the winner of this place and will keep me coming back when I'm in the area is the sweet crepe. They serve it in halves (perfect for a date wrap-up). The halves have powdered sugar topping the perfect combination of caramelized strawberries - sweet and soft to the touch), a creme/custard, along with little bits of torched sugar - like that of a creme brulee. It was sweet and had depth. I'm not going to overhype this selection; I will just highly suggest this be what you order and leave the judging to you. In the chicken order, the waffle was more of a container for the chicken, but it was definitely a KEY player in the creme one as it added texture and added to complexity, something missing in the savory waffle. I suggest going to roscoes for chicken and waffles. :X Too Long; Didn't Read Pros: Good service, good location, Good creme brulee waffle. Cons: Chicken and waffle combo was overhyped (don't let it overhype you). It's good, not great. The place isn't bigger.

I was DYING to find a place that serves Liege waffles and then I found Bruxie. Of course I got the Liege waffle but we also got a nutella and banana waffle with their seasonal strawberry milkshake. Liege waffle was a disappointment and it wasn't at all like the ones I've had before where it's crispy on the outside but doughy on the inside. It wasn't bad though, more just like a plain waffle with some sugar on the outside. The nutella and banana waffle was good but it wasn't anything special. Their milkshake was REALLY thick and had lots of tiny strawberry bits in it. This was probably the most memorable thing, and it was really good. Next time I want to try one of their famous waffle sandwiches. I'm sure it will change my mind about this place :)

Do you ever visit a place and think, "Darn! Why didn't I think of this???" This is that place! It's a cute, little stand you walk up to, order, then find a table to sit at or stand at. Then a very nice server brings your order and also brings anything else you need, such as water or condiments. My bf got the fried chicken and I got the prosciutto with gruyere. Both were yummy! The waffles were perfectly crispy and worked really well as the "bread." My sandwich had thin slices of salty, tender prosciutto, subtle hints of melted gruyere and strong, tangy bursts of mustard seeds. Delish! If you don't like mustard, stay away from this sandwich. My bf's chicken was perfectly crispy on the outside and tender and juicy on the inside. The coleslaw rounded the whole sandwich out very well. Added that creamy, crunchy touch. We also got the fries and shared. Actually we got one combo-which is a sandwich and fries. The fries were pretty good. Not particularly spectacular, but good no less. I gotta warn you-the sandwiches aren't big, but worth every penny. Now, I just have to try the sweet ones! ;)

I went back to Bruxie about a week ago and was compelled to return to write another review (even though the last one was also 5 stars.) Now hear this. Bruxie has some of THE BEST CUSTOMER SERVICE I've ever experienced at a restaurant or food joint. The employees are helpful, friendly, and are determined to make sure your experience is a pleasant and memorable one. They're enthusiastic about the history of Bruxie, ecstatic about their ingredients and weekly specials, and love hearing suggestions and pleas to open new locations. The owner can regularly be found making friendly conversation with those waiting in line and enjoying their food, and employees will often check on you and love joking and chatting. One example of their superb customer service that stood out to me (among others) came when I told them my brother was working down at Huntington Beach as a lifeguard, and I asked them if I could get him a BBQ pulled pork with everything on the side so it wouldn't get soggy. Not only did the man behind the counter comply, but he eagerly told me that what I was getting was called "deconstructed" and that the best way to get it to my brother would be to give the waffle a quick extra toast at home before dropping it off with him, and that everything we would need to put it back together would be in the take-out box. Once I got to my brother's tower, the ingredients in the box were arranged perfectly to help "reconstruct" the bruxie. He later told me it was absolutely delicious.

Favorites, in order: Savory: 1. Green Eggs and Hame 2. Chicken and Waffle (w/ Maple Syrup) 3. Pastrami / Braised Beef Short Rib 4. Carolina BBQ Sweet: 1. Lemon Meringue (I like the tart and smooth, personal preference) 2. Any Cheesecake 3. S'mores I think it's about time I wrote one of these. I got a tip from Olivia E. about going here a few months ago, and my brother and I went. Thought the idea of a chicken and waffle sandwich would be good. And it is really good. Slightly spicy, crispy, with a little bit of zing and a hit of sweet, juxtaposed with a texturally perfect waffle, the signature component to any Bruxie concoction. Glorious homemade sodas too. Brother got the Braised Beef Short Rib, and we were hooked for life. Seeing as how we live in Riverside, We decided to make it a once a month trip. The next month we did chicken and the carolina bbq. equally impressed, also impressed with the dessert waffle. The next time (2 weeks later) it was Pastrami. Do I like Green Eggs and Ham? Only the greatest concoction ever, Sam, I Am! Egg, Pesto, Ham, Waffle. Everything's texturally sound and flavorfully balanced. Bruxie has now become a once a week pilgrimage. I have only had half the menu. I want more.

Bruxie is the sorority girl who enrolls into your Critical Theory 100B: Language and Rhetoric class. You have such unjustified expectations, despite seeing the letters delta, delta delta, emblazoned on her chest. Maybe she defies all stereotypes. Maybe she is Denise Richards as a nuclear scientist. 蔄nd then you are horribly, horribly crushed when the professor is forced to explain the meaning of "catharsis" to her. Bruxie tastes exactly like what it purports to offer. It's offerings are unflinchingly honest. Buttermilk chicken and waffles? Yeup, it tastes exactly like waffles..and chicken. You want to spend $1 and add REAL maple syrup? Guess what, it tastes exactly like how you would imagine syrup drizzled over fried chicken and waffle would be like. The same cycle repeats again with all the other fillings: pastrami, wild mushrooms, a beef patty, eggs cheese and bacon etc. Guess what the waffle fries taste like? If you've been to late night at your school's dining hall, then you know what it tastes like.

Just a short update to this great food stand... I met my co-worker here for lunch recently and they had a special short rib sandwich on the menu that has been my favorite thing I've ever eaten here so far. If it's on the menu when you show up, try it! If it's not, ask them to make it a permanent menu item. Amazing!

CREME BRULEE?? My favorite! And in a waffle? Pure genius. Their waffle is nice and slightly fluffy, with a subtle crunch to the outside. Definitely no soggy waffles here...I saw creme brulee and of course had to order that one. We came here to meet some friends for dessert on a Wednesday afternoon and the wait wasn't long at all. Swapped half of my creme brulee for my friends seasonal special strawberry cheesecake, and unfortunately regretted it. The strawberry creme brulee was so much better. The vanilla creme and warm torched brown sugar was tastier than the cheesecake. The cheesecake wasn't warm and the cream cheese was kind of cold and tasted mehh...it was ok. $7 for a waffle sandwich isn't too steep...but it could be a little cheaper. Next time I get the chance, I'll probably try a savory waffle as well.

MmmmmMmmmm - I think that's all I need to say. A friend and I decided to take an extra long lunch and drive from MDR to Orange for lunch because we had heard great things about Bruxie. I had the mushroom/balsamic and my friend had the short rib special and a milk shake. Everything was extra delicious.. The only downsides were the lack of parking and competitive seating but we will still go back. A perfect lunch spot; if only we could get one on the West Side.

I am a huge fan of chicken and waffles. So when I heard of a waffle place in the OC, of course I had to come check it out! I have been here at least 3 times already. This place is located on neat little corner, with very limited outdoor seating area (not bad, considering this is SoCal. Not much rain, but the sun can be harsh sometimes). We went during a really hot day, but they had a mist-er going, and it felt nice to have a cool spray in your face while waiting in line. I ended up trying the chicken and waffle, the pulled pork special, and the sweet fig dessert. All of them were delicious! The chicken and waffle sandwich, isn't the best I had (I have been to a lot of places, but it was still a pretty good dish). The pulled pork is AMAZING. A tad spicy, very moist with a bit of coleslaw on top. I would totally grab 5 to go and have it on the way home (haha). I wasn't in the mood for sweets, but my mother was. She said it was delicious, not too sweet and the fig was a nice touch. The servers were extremely nice. For a to-go restaurant, the servers still helped with clearing the tables, getting water, etc. Overall, this place is best for a snack after walking around downtown.

I love Bruxie. I'm tempted to start going to Chapman just so that I can have an excuse to come here more often. I just wish it were a little bit cheaper. I have enjoyed every single thing I have ever ordered from Bruxie. Everything just happens to taste good when it's on a waffle I guess. Some of my favorites: Chicken and Waffle Carolina BBQ Pulled Pork Egg, Bacon, and Cheddar The custard is also pretty great. - The consistency is perfect, it doesn't melt too quickly, and it's not overly sweet. Their shakes might even be one of the best i've ever had. Also.. although it gets pretty crowded. - The service is always great. =)

Being a vegan, the only thing I was able to have at Bruxie was the waffle fries. Nonetheless, I wasn't disappointed at all! They were crisp, not too oily and well-seasoned. My fiance also ordered the fresh lemonade. He thought it was a tad too sweet for him but we tend to like rather tart lemonade so it could be an issue of personal taste. As many have mentioned, there's not much in the of seating here. There are a handful of bar tables (no chairs or shade) and a few picnic benches, one of which we were lucky to score when we got there. We came mid-afternoon on a weekend and there was a line (about 10-15 people deep) and the wait was about 10 minutes to just order. To be fair, once our order was taken, the fries did arrive rather quickly. The milkshakes here looked really delicious, but obviously I didn't try them. I hope they add vegan waffles to the menu someday!

I think this place is overrated. It's a neat idea having waffles to substitute 蔮read. I got the hamburger and it was alright. The chicken sandwich was better but I wouldn't go out of my way to pick it up. Maybe worth trying once since it's unusual. Get the chicken sandwich if u do! Maybe the other sandwiches are better?

I went to this place with a friend while on a road trip to the OC. I'm not a huge waffle fan, but I loved Nutella. I checked out the menu beforehand, and ordered the sweet Nutella waffle. I was expecting a soft waffle, but this one packed a crunch. Imagine warm Nutella with sliced bananas sandwiches between two fresh waffles. Yum! There was some sort of sweet cream in the waffle that I didn't adore, and if I were to go back I would have excluded. The service is great. Pretty fast being how much business they get. Plus they deliver the food to you, which is a plus! Overall still pretty good.. check it out.

So I obviously wanted to see what the big hype was al about. So I went to check it out. Grade A goodness! To my surprise, bruxie is pretty good. I'm not much of a sweets person, but having waffles as the bread of a sandwich wasn't a bad idea (I do love sandwiches though). Foods - Chicken waffle is a must try with syrup on the side. I'm not sure if they still have it, since it's a seasonal item, but the green eggs and ham is one of my favorite dishes there. Get dessert if you want to try it, waffles its bomb on its own. Don't get the fries, its whatever. Drinks - Got the lemonade there, was way to sweet. We still watered it down, but no use, it was still toooo sweet. Price - $5 to $20 if not with a sandwich and anything else you add to it. Service - Friendly staff of people, they can tell you honest recommendations and can help you out anyway possible. Atmosphere - whether you come night or afternoon, its always crowded. Wait it out and enjoy the environment, old towne orange is bomb to walk around. Conclusion - Go try it out. Its worth experience and again, travel around the area. Waffles :) Random - Might want to park in the neighborhood. Kind of small area for parking and seating is limited as well. WARNING: you wont be filled �maybe) :P

A friend introduced me to this place and it was absolutely wonderful. 蔍t's very close in proximity to Chapman University and you would have to park street side (which is sometimes very hard to find). 蔔onetheless, the menu is wonderful. I had the Brussels Waffle with Cinnamon and Powdered sugar this time and it certainly hit the spot. 蔈specially in the evening on a cool day. 蔜he hot chocolate was decent, but it was not amazing by far. 蔍f you're in the mood for some street food that will fill you up and leave you content, this is definitely the place to try out.

This is truly a gem in Orange County. I heard about this place so many times but never got to try it. Finally went there last weekend it is so worth the wait. 蔜his is the type of restaurants I look for on yelp. It is a nice small shop in old town Orange. The whole place made me feel like I was on in Hill Valley in 1955. The waffle sandwiches are very unique, you are not going to find it in many other places. I also topped it off with a shake which was super yummy. The service was awesome, they had someone in line to take order, so even though there was quite a line it went really fast. The only bummer was the lack of seating, but I am definitely going to be a regular here for awhile.

Soooo good! I can see why the lines start so early. 蔜his place has been on my radar for awhile, but never found an opportunity to get down to Orange and always feared the parking. A couple of weekends ago I got to go have breakfast here with my brother and my adorable niece, who I never realized lived so close to Bruxie. 蔒y niece was super excited for her waffle. We got there a little bit before 9 when they open and there was already a line forming. Me and my niece scored a table while my brother ordered. I had the fried chicken and waffle. In love! The chilli honey and creamy coleslaw perfectly complemented the chicken and waffle. Mmmm. My niece had the lemon cream and berries and ate every bit of it up. My brother had the green eggs and ham and the nutella and banana. I had a bit of the nutella and banana and loved it. the sweet cream helped cut the sweet thickness of the nutella. Cannot wait to go back and try more on the menu!

The waffles themselves were superbly made, that's all I gotta say, with the perfect amount of crisp and lightness. I had the berry and lemon cream one, which really hit the spot for me, but the salmon one I tried was a little on the salty side, though admittedly still delicious. 蔍'd definitely go back to try everything else on the menu. Not a fan of the long line though and the lack of space to sit, but I guess the customer service makes up for some of it, because the service was fast, they deliver the food to wherever you are (sitting or standing), and they gave me soy milk for my coffee, which not many places do, haha.

So after 6 months I came back! 蔍 finally tried the chicken and waffle which was good. 蔜he chicken was not over cooked, and still was tasty. 蔠e also got the Bruxie burger and the special that was on the menu which was the pastrami. 蔜he burger I would say was okay, I feel it was missing something to it. 蔄nd the pastrami was okay too, but I think its better just as a sandwich and not on a waffle. 蔍 shared this between my boyfriend and his friend. 蔠e also got a dessert waffle the creme brulee, which I liked a lot. The line was not that long, but the small seating area was full, and we waited for a seat. 蔠e tried to get a four seating table but non were available. 蔛o I had to shared a seat with my boyfriend (he is lucky, I'm small). 蔒y boyfriend and his friend went to break for a cigarette. 蔐eaving me to finish the last couple of bites on the creme brulee waffle, I did notice a couple waiting for the seat, but I wanted to finish before I left. 蔛orry I like to take my time eating. 蔍 finished and left. 蔍 could have been an mean and seat there waiting for them to come back, but I got up and walked to were they were. 蔜hey told me they were waiting, and I told them I knew. 蔍ts not like I gave the table to someone else. 蔅oth times, I have come here I experienced good service from the runners and the cashier. I like the food here and will like to come here again, but it gets a little pricey, so this maybe a once every couple of months kind of place. 蔍 haven't come on any other day except on a Sunday, so I don't know how long the lines are the other days, but I think Sunday near the end of the day is a good time to go, because both times the line was not very long.

Addicted. I've had Roscoes chicken and waffles, but the waffles here are much better. Slightly crispy and completely mouth watering. I've had their chicken, salmon and burger waffles. Burger was a little heavy but the chicken and salmon was light and perfect for lunch. The next time I go I want to try their feta cheese and tomato one.

We drove 30+ miles to try Bruxie, so it was extremely disappointing when we got there and realized that the "restaurant" was actually a corner store with only outdoor (and very limited) seating. It reminded me of The Hat (http://www.yelp.com/biz/�, but in a quaint neighborhood. Chapman University is located right across the street, so when you see it, try to find street parking. The first thing I did when I jumped out of the car was run to Bruxie and ask for a restroom (again, it was a very long drive on the 5 freeway)...and they directed me across the street. What kind of restaurant doesn't have its own restrooms and sends their customers to a nearby school to use their bathrooms?! We came back after washing up, and the line somehow got longer. It was a weekday, but the place was still pretty lively. I could only imagine what Bruxie would look like on a weekend. I saw an employee handing out menus to customers so that it would make ordering go by faster and easier since customers knew what they wanted to order by the time they got to the register. I never received one, but it was okay because the menu was quite visible regardless. We ordered a soda ($2.50), the Bruxie burger ($6.95), and the seasonal cr巑e brul巈 ($6.50) after a 5 minute wait in line. Luckily for us, a couple had just finished eating when we ordered, so we parked our butts at a nearby table and watched the cars and people stroll by as we waited for our food. Less than 10 minutes later, my ex's name was called. The employee standing at the pick-up window handed him the food, and my ex walked back to our table with almost a drool hanging out from the side of his mouth. I've been REALLY dying to try Roscoe's, but I figured Bruxie would be better given its bizarre menu twists. So when I bit into my sweet "gourmet waffle sandwich," I expected something amazingly out-of-the-ordinary good. What I got was a burnt waffle topped with powdered sugar that smelled slightly off. I understand that cr巑e brul巈 involves burnt sugar, but I don't understand the burnt waffle. The vanilla cr巑e was delicious though, and it wasn't too sweet or overpowering. The strawberries were perfect -- not too sour and not too sweet. My ex's Bruxie burger looked like a legit burger but instead of a burger bun, the patty, lettuce, tomatoes, pickles, etc. were on a waffle. He commented that it was nothing special, but it was filling enough so that he didn't want dinner a couple of hours later. The cup of soda was half filled with crushed ice, so it's safe to assume that it wouldn't have lasted us through the meal. It did however, but only because of the taste; we didn't enjoy the "old fashioned pure cane sugar" part. So to sum it all up, The good -- Appealing and extensive menu, the location of Bruxie in Old Town Orange The bad -- The price, the drive, and (don't kill me) mediocre food. Farewell, hyped-up Bruxie! I won't be back.

I have been here two times now. 蔍 am in love. �NEGATIVE: 蔖arking sucks and there is very limited seating available (also there are no public restrooms). �POSITIVE: 蔠here do I start? 蔜he staff is extremely friendly, helpful, polite, quick, and delightful. 蔜he food is inventive, delicious, and absolutely worth the line (which goes at a good pace). The waffle is light and delicate with a good light crunch on the outside. 蔍t's enough waffle to contain the food and provide a good flavor without overwhelming the food. 蔋owever, it's so delicate that it gets soggy easy. 蔈rgo, I don't suggest the Bruxie Burger.

AMAZING. If you would like a tasty snack/meal that is truly different then Bruxie is the place. The have one in Old Town Orange and Brea on Birch Street. Both are nice places to take a stroll around after you eat. Its not super cheap because you WILL want more. Their natural sodas and specialty milkshakes are so so good. SO you will have to get a savory bruxie with waffle fries and a soda then for dessert you will have to try a sweet bruxie and a milkshake. Bring plenty of cash, an appetite, and your friends because its so fun to pass around the Bruxies and try them all. I love this place so much! I bring all my out of town guests here as well and they are blown away. DO NOT go if you are on a diet.

I have been to Bruxie twice now, and I'm sure that I'll be there many more times (especially since I just noticed that they're opening up a location in downtown Brea!). This place is amazing! The first time I went, I had the Smoked Salmon and Dill Cream Cheese, and it was SO GOOD. My husband had the Bacon, Egg & Cheddar. The second time I had one of the seasonal sandwiches--the Green Eggs and Ham which was ham, egg & pesto. Yummy, but I still think about the Smoked Salmon and Dill Cream Cheese all the time. My husband had the Bruxie Burger and loved it. Definitely check out the waffle (of course) fries. Seating is limited, but people tend to eat and move on--both times we went we had no trouble finding seating after we had ordered. We went on Sunday mornings around 10:30 and the line was pretty short, but at about 11am the line starts to stretch down the block. I am dying to try to the Buttermilk Fried Chicken & Waffle with maple syrup and the Proscuitto & Gruyere...

Atmosphere - cute, old-fashioned. Fits in with old-town Orange :) A cute place to walk around after you eat to burn all those calories! Outdoor seating only, with limited seating areas. There's a couple tables specifically for standing. No public bathroom, either! There's hand sanitizer/paper towel dispenser available if needed. Food - Buttermilk Fried Chicken Waffle was delicious! My boyfriend ordered this, I was hesitant to at first because it sounds really heavy/oily.. but it didn't taste oily at ALL! The waffle was super light and had the right amount of crispiness, while the chicken was perfectly cooked. - Waffle fries were $2.00 with the chicken waffle. A nice addition to the meal. - Lemon Cream and Berries waffle was a nice mixture of sweet/sour, though I actually preferred the chicken waffle. Drink - Old-fashioned Cola for $1.99; $1 for refills. Comes out quick - right when you order it, almost! Service - very quick and tentative. I'd definitelyyy eat here again. Yum!

Thanks Yelp for your hot list feature! Very helpful when planning my list of places to try on vacay. #1 in the OC is Bruxie. A little food stand across the street from Chapman University in Orange. From reading it up, parking sounded like a challenge. Fortunately it was not on a sunny Monday morning. There are a few spots on the premises, but likely you will need to park on the street. Watch out for signs regarding parking rules for each street. Some require a parking permit. The menu consists of sweet & savory waffle sandwiches alongside soda, floats, shakes, sundaes and frozen custard! They also have some daily waffle sandwich specials which are very appetizing including one with short ribs. But that picture on the Yelp front page of the buttermilk fried chicken & waffle sandwich ($6.95) had me hooked on getting it. I paired with an old fashioned cane sugar vanilla cream soda ($1.95). Seating here is a little limited. Picnic table style. Your ambiance here is the neighborhood that it is in which is cute and bustling. The sandwich was ready fairly quickly. And I have to say that it deserves to be on the hot list! The fried chicken is crispy and tender and dressed with a honey chili sauce and coleslaw. The waffles work great as the bread in this sandwich. Has me wondering why no one came up with this good idea before. This seems like something that could become a food truck trend to me. The vanilla cream soda was refreshing and it washed down the sandwich real well. Though it had a little too much ice and not enough drink. If you are in the vicinity of Orange, Bruxie is well worth a visit. The concept of waffle sandwiches is a strong hook to draw you here.

Finally got to try Bruxie yesterday after seeing it on the front page of Yelp for weeks. I got a Buttermilk Fried Chicken & Waffle with Waffle Fries and my friend got a Bacon, Egg & Cheddar without the mayo. The chicken was on the dry side, but the Chili Honey and the Cole Slaw made up for that. The waffle itself had a light crunch on the outside. If it wasn't for the Chili Honey and the Cole Slaw, I would have rated my first Bruxie experience as pretty average. Seriously, that stuff is good. When some of my Cole Slaw started to fall out, I ran for a knife so I could stuff it all back in. The Waffle Fries were alright. Don't know if they're always like that, but I wish they had more of a crunch to them. I tried some of my friend's Bacon, Egg & Cheddar and well, I would have gotten it with the mayo. Personal preference, of course. 3.5 stars for what I had that night, rounded up to 4 stars because I want to try out the other sandwiches (specials!) and because I had good company. :]

Came here on a hot, sunny afternoon and there was a long line...but thankfully, there were mist sprayers shooting out from the awning and it helped haha..felt like we were in line at 6 flags or something..but it helped! Also, while we were waiting, one of the ladies brought water to us and all the other waiting line...how nice! I got the fried chicken and waffle- nice big piece of chicken lightly battered and flavorful. It had a hint of spiciness from the chili seasoning. they also have an option of adding maple syrup for $1...mayyyybe I'll try that next time. The waffle was good but it did get a lil soggy..I thoroughly enjoyed it tho my friend got the waffle burger and it came with not 1...but 2 patties! whoa...haha he said it tasted like a reg burger...guess nothing special I wanna come back and try their dessert. Seating is a bit difficult...there are only like 4 tables and then a couple of high tables under umbrellas w/o seating...I came around 130pm on a Monday and it was poppin!

I would come here all the time if I could. My sister, Marian B. is always there. It has never failed me. The waffle is light and crispy and works as the perfect base for the sweet or savory fillings. My faves are the smores with bacon (yea, add bacon to it. hooo man), short rib with egg (again.. you hafta do it), green eggs and ham, prosciutto and gruyere, and the mint chocolate milkshake. You cannot be disappointed by this place. It's almost always poppin there and for good reason too.

"This makes me want to buy a waffle maker!!!" -Marina 3 of us ordered the Buttermilk Fried Chicken & Waffles, Prosciutto & Gruyere, and the Albacore Tuna sandwich each cut into thirds so we could each have a piece! I kinda regret it now... I should have ordered all 3 sandwiches on my own!!! We also split the Irish Nachos as an appetizer and Strawberry Creme Br瀕巈 for dessert- both exceptionally delicious! This place brings out the Fatty-Phat-Fat out of me! Two thumbs way up! Will be back as soon as my arteries unclog! =) (This is actually 4.5 stars, portions are not as big as I would hope.)

This place has been way hyped up by friends and you know what, it lived up to the high expectations. And how'd I do it? Rolled up with my family and ordered just about the whole menu, BIZAH! Mostly winners and a few so so's but highlights: - Prosciutto and Gruyere: A must. Packed with layers of super soft melt in your mouth prosciutto, and the gruyere adds that earthy, nutty creaminess. It's the business. - Fried Chicken: Pretty nice piece of breaded chicken, but it just works so perfectly together with the cabbage cole slaw, drizzle of maple syrup & crunch of the waffle. I've been to a lot of fried chicken and waffle places and never really got the appeal. At Bruxie's, I get it. - Fig and Creme Brulee: The figs were like candied and soaked in their own syrupy jam like tastiness. Creme brulee had a perfect sweet custard-y flavor and with the crunchy waffle and powdered sugar, fugging goooood. The waffles are great, super airy with a delicate crunch. I've gotten that effect at home using baking soda and beating the egg whites like crazy. But I'd rather just come to Bruxie. Other notes: Waffle fries were perfectly cruncy. Beware, if you try to sample all the sweet ones you get a sugar, richness overload real quick. Skip the Salmon & Red Bean The shakes look good, but I feel like they were a miss.

Wow...reviews all over the map from my friends on this one. 蔄nd given the 700+ reviews already here, and the youth of the crowd waiting in line with me; it certainly is a trendy place to hang out at. �Here are the plusses: *Interesting sandwich choices both savory and sweet *Great service, owners were out front greeting and educating customers *Unique, non-mass market produced sodas *Love the wisconsin custard soft serve *Free wi-fi Here are the minuses: *Prices a bit high for just dessert or for a full combo lunch *$1.00 refill on those unique sodas *Popular at lunch with limited seating *Waffles as a wrap choice are inconsisent. 蔅read is still king *Sandwiches are not that filling *Fries are good but not unique and order was small with not-quite filling sandwich. �*Menu is limited So for now, my review is a three...but a strong three. 蔖eople will flock for the novelty, but, they will only come back for the quality. 蔜hat needs to be upgraded. �This concept also has limited potential to expand; either next to a college like the current location or maybe a tourist Downtown like HB. 蔍t will be fascinating to see where this business is in a year or two.

OVERALL RATING = 9 / 10 The EATS: ��[ NEW ] Prosciutto & Gruyere = 10 ��Buttermilk Fried Chicken & Waffle = 9 ��[ NEW ] Strawberry Cr弇e br瀕巈 = 9 ��Waffle French Fries = 8 ��Bruxie Burger = 7 ATMOSPHERE = 7 SERVICE = 8 APPEAL = 9 The Chicken - They nailed the fried chicken. It was perfectly breaded and crisp. The meat was tender and not dry at all. The only reason why this sandwich is not a perfect "10" is because of the waffle. It's not the best, moist, sweet, buttery, vanilla-y waffle I've ever had, but I suppose it served its purpose. Definitely a step above the average Leggo my Eggo waffle. But I kept thinking what if the waffle was as good as say.. the waffle from Plums cafe in Costa Mesa? That would be nuts. This is a must order for anyone's first visit. The Prosciutto/Gruyere - the cheesy-ness was great, but also has adequate amount of prosciutto so it wouldn't be missed. The chives and whole-grain mustard complemented well. The waffle was crispy on the outside with slight doughy-ness in the middle. It was perfect for this sandwich. Of the 3 non-dessert, waffle sandwiches I tried, this one and the Chicken were the best and I couldn't figure out which one I enjoyed more. I gave it the highest rating because of the originality; I believe I wouldn't be able to find a sandwich like this anywhere (at least in SoCal). The Creme brulee - I chose this over the Lemon berries b/c it's a seasonal item. I took it home to share w/ my wife. It got soggy cause the waffle soaked up some of the creamy custard. It was STILL awesome. The Burger - tasted like a good burger sandwiched between a waffle. Nothing special, but still good. Their menu is pretty intriguing. Looking forward to trying their Mushroom Arugula and Lemon Cream w /Berries.

Dude, this was heaven in a waffle. Fried chicken sandwich on an unsweetened waffle and waffle fries....YUM. I ordered the maple syrup on the side and the whole meal was amazing. Only semi-complaint is that there isn't a whole lot of sitting areas, but hell....I'd stand the whole time to eat a meal this good. Thanks to my sis and bro-in-law for introducing this place to me during my So. Cal. visit....yes, I will be going to this place every time I visit now! :)

Not that I need to review this place :) Loved the light and crispy waffle. It wasn't too heavy or bread-y as I thought it would be. The chicken of their chicken and waffles sandwich was crispy but not hard, nice and juicy. I wish they added a little more slaw. I was very glad they were light on the syrup drizzle. We also tried the bruxie burger. That was cooked med. rare and was very good too. I could have used a bit more lettuce/tomato also but it was still good. Nice slice of melted cheese. I think I liked the chicken better, but the burger is not bad. Over all not bad, but could use a bit more veggie haha... meat was good. waffles were good (though my friend noted he thought it was a little on the greasy side) The fries were ok. The lemonade was yummy (not too sugary, not too tangy). Keep in mind it's a small place with outdoor seating so there's usually a line, seating is hard to find, and parking is mainly on the street. But they are fairly quick considering they small kitchen. I want to go back and try their sweet waffles next time. This time I was just too full for it.

Um. This place is so legit! I wish there was one in SD! If you like/ love waffles, this is your heaven! Imagine going to a sandwich shop and instead of bread/ toast, your carb is replaced with a deliciously crispy, yet soft & chewy, waffle! We ordered the buttermilk fried chicken and waffle sandwich (the best seller). The chicken breast was crispy on the outside but so moist and soft on the inside. I love how they put a slightly sweet cole slaw into the waffle sandwich. We didn't order the maple syrup on it, and I'm glad we didn't - I think it would have been too sweet. We also got the irish nachos (waffle "fries") and they were generous with the cheese and bacon! We put a lil siracha (yes, they have siracha and it's not even an asian place nor do they serve asian foods!) on it and we were happy campers! The strawberry lemonade was delicious (and had very little seeds, which I appreciate). Next time, I want to go back and order the roasted mushroom & goat cheese sandwich & add sun-dried tomatoes. I also want to try the dulce de leche shake. Do you want to take me? I need an excuse to go back!! Service is EXTREMELY friendly! You can just tell that the workers love their job. At least 4 different people came up to our table to ask us if we needed anything and if we were enjoying our food. All tables (sitting or standing tables) are outside so you can enjoy the beautiful SoCal weather.

I had bookmarked this restaurant over a year ago and have driven past it several times with a wistful glance in its direction, as I'd always notice a line wrapping the building each and every time. 蔠ell, today my friend and I headed out with expectations of a potentially long wait ahead of us. First wonderful surprise of the day...No line! No wait! We walked right up, ordered, and within a few minutes, we were able to partake in heavenly, waffle bliss. Crispy fried chicken drizzled with an incredible syrup sandwiched between a hot waffle and studded with bites of slaw....DELICIOUS! Well worth the $6.95. I will be back again to try more.

Eh more like 3.5 stars in my book... For whatever reason, I really expected more from this place. After hearing rave reviews from my cousin about the waffle sandwiches here, I was really excited to try it out! The waffle part of my sandwich wasn't warm which disappointed me most, but overall it was just OK. For dessert I got a strawberry and nutella waffle which was good, but I've had crepes similar that tasted better. For me, I'd say the highlight of my meal was the strawberry shake that I had. The shake was actually one of the best I've ever had! 蔍 know this establishment is fairly small and all, but I found it really weird that they send customers across the street to the school to use the restroom .

The sound of waffle sandwhich creations excite my ears.. It was good but I wasn't impressed by the sandwiches unfortunately. The dulce de leche shake was AMAZING!! I can only imagine how tasty the others are too! yum! The fries were good.. waffle/criss-cut is my favorite fry shape and these were good but its a pretty small portion that comes with your sandwich. I had to order extra as a side considering the sandwich was pretty small. I think Chick Fila has just as good waffle fries. Outdoor bench style seating only. I did like that they had cups & water for free outside with all the condiments, untensils, napkins, etc. �The waffles themselves were not impressive to me.. There's a place in WeHo called "The Waffle" which uses large fluffy belgian waffles (two whole ones, not one folded in half like bruxies) and the ingredients are stacked inside! sooo tasty & at least 5x more food for about the same price.. and its a sit down restaurant with AC, waiter service, coffee, OJ, cocktails etc. I prefer that experience. But if you are in the Orange area in for a quick, not too filling bite this is much better than any fast food & the shakes are INCREDIBLE! :)

Waffle sandwiches, fries, n shakes..... What a brilliant concept! 蔍 lubs waffles! 蔇arn why didn't I think of this?! Waffles are the "bread" in these sandwiches. The waffles are light and crispy. 蔔ot as flavorful as Rosco's waffles, but still good. 蔍 recommend eating them right away instead of to go since they can get soggy. 蔜hey offer savory and sweet sandwiches, shakes, sundaes, floats, 蔯offees, waffle cut fries, frozen custard, and old fashioned sugar cane soda. 蔠affle sandwiches are around 6-8 bucks. - Buttermilk fried chicken with this spicy syrup and cole slaw: 蔛ounds weird but it was delicious and went well together. 蔍 heard it was their most popular item. - Braised short rib in gravy and blue cheese: 蔍 almost didn't order this because I'm not much of a blue cheese fan, but there was so little of it I could hardly taste it. 蔜hey were really generous with the amount of short rib too. 蔍t's not in the menu, but apparently if it's on the chalkboard they're serving it. 蔜he chef was the one who told me about it. 蔍 thought this was yummy. - Prusciutto and gruyere - light and tasty, pretty good combo - Waffle cut fries - crispy and yummy - Strawberry shake - �Delicious, 蔯reamy, fresh strawberries - Strawberry and creme waffle- 蔕h gawd, this was good. 蔍 don't know what kind of crack, I mean cream they use but it's so sweet and luscious with the fresh strawberries. Small joint located a few blocks north of downtown Orange. 蔜here tends to be a long line, but it moves quickly. 蔇uring our 10 minute wait, a couple of guys (I'm assuming are the chefs?) are talking to the customers and handing out menus. 蔎ust order at the window, pay, grab your number, and take a seat. 蔜hey'll bring call your name and bring the food to you. �There is seating but not a lot, maybe a few picnic tables plus some tables to stand at. I recommend just parking around DT Orange, saves you the trouble of looking and you can walk off everything you eat :-)

I'm not really sure how I feel about this place. I think I had big expectations because of all the wonderful reviews, but when I left I felt like it was good but definitely not great. They hubby and I went here on a Saturday morning when they first opened and the line was already pretty long. I ordered they strawberry cream waffle and my husband got the green eggs and ham (both off the seasonal menu). The seating is really limited so we were standing for awhile until we saw a family leave. Both of our waffles were good, my was really sweet, almost a desert. I think I like my husbands better, the pesto was really good. I like the novelty of this place, but it's nothing I would go out of my way for, if you're in the area and want a fairly quick bite, I would try it.

Maybe I got lucky for my first time, but I definitely will come back to this sweet spot again! There was no dreadful line when I came around 8pm on a Sunday to give it a try. Parked right in front and ordered the smoked salmon, burger, strawberry cheesecake, creme brulee, and nutella banana. I couldn't complain about any of the sandwiches! They were all very tasty. They got my order wrong and gave me a strawberry lemonade instead of a strawberry cheesecake. I told them right away and they gave me the drink for free and didn't charge me the difference on the strawberry cheesecake =D It was a great experience. Good food and awesome service.

Ah Dairy Treat, R.I.P. May you not know that the new place has more business in the past few months than you probably had in years. I got the fruit and cream waffles and it was too sweet for my taste. I think if I get the salmon, it'd probably be too salty for me. It's overpriced for waffles. My friend said he could spread Nutella on waffles at home for less and they probably would be better. I think Bruxie's is a lot of hype. Bruxie's is probably gonna be an occasional visit.

I came here for the first time because of a friend's suggestion. It was great! This place almost reminds me of a food truck because it is kind of a grab n' go place. Although this is not really a sit down restaurant,it does have some pretty decent seats around it with outdoors heater, which is really thoughtful of them. The staff were pretty friendly in explaining the types of waffle (I overheard when one of them was helping someone), and brought the food to us quickly after we sat down. Me and all my friends got the chicken and waffle sandwich, and we also got some waffle fries. This is not the typical chicken and waffle you would expect because the chicken is like a chicken fillet and it was drenched in some honey chili sauce with cole slaw. 蔜he chicken fillet was really soft, and I really enjoyed the waffle (so good). I got the maple syrup too just because me and my friend wanted to try it. It was a mistake. The honey chili sauce was so sweet that you can't really tell if you added syrup or not...so my advice is to NOT get the syrup. The waffle fries were excellent, nothing to complain about. Crispy and warm, yum. I really wish I had room for dessert though, but i was too full after the sandwich and couldn't fit in dessert :( Maybe next time... ps. Once you get seated, if you wanted to order more, you just have to tell the server and he/she will bring it to you so you don't have to go back in line again. What great service!

I can only eat about half since they are so filling. I like their shakes and lemonades but I don't like their sodas.

Simply put, Bruxie serves sandwiches in between two waffles instead of in between two slices of bread. It's an idea so good that someone will end up stealing it on them. One result of this approach - the Prosciutto & Gruyere waffle sandwich - is a stroke of genius. The Strawberry Creme Brulee waffle, a seasonal dessert, is also excellent. Problem is, I have learned through multiple subsequent visits that other items on the menu (Fried Chicken waffle, S'mores) do not hold up against my two initial favorites. Overall, some of the sandwiches and desserts are hit or miss, and the shakes (vanilla, green mint) are no better than fine. The prevailing drawback here is that portions are small relative to prices. You either need to order two sandwiches at $6 apiece, or alternatively, you need to be OK with leaving hungry.

I hope those Chapman U kids know how good they've got it, what with Bruxie right on the edge of their campus. After hearing all the buzz for months, we finally had occasion to drop by for a weeknight dinner. We stayed on the "savory" (as opposed to "sweet") side of the menu, and enjoyed a delicious burger, a mushroom/goat cheese sandwich, and an order of Irish nachos, which were the daily special. We were surprised by the lightness of the waffles (we imagined they would be more dense), and were delighted by the efficient and friendly service. It's easy to see that these people give a damn--they represent the passionate and creativity community that has, over the past several years, transformed the Orange Circle from a collection of dusty antique shops to a hip and fun hangout! Can't wait for a reason to return to Bruxie--next time we'll be sure to try something sweet!

The line at first seemed long, but them peeps working the kitchen crank stuff out quick! They ask for your first name and last initial at the register 蕎hich I though was cool because when my order is ready, they'd call out my Yelp name ^_^ Anyway Smoked salmon waffle sandwich -8$ Chicken waffle sandwich - 7$ "waffle" fries- $2.50 strawberry shake- $5 Smoked salmon... eh I think I woulda preferred this on a bagel Chicken waffle... lacking in flavor "Waffle" fries... just like the criss cut fries from Carl's Jr. disappointingly, they're made from potatoes and not waffles :( Eating this was like eating a bag of Lay's potato chips; some pieces were either on the bland side or the salty side. Strawberry shake... I prefer Jack in the Box's. In conclusion, the waffles were more of a texture thing. They were perfectly cooked with a crunchy exterior and a moist, fluffy interior, but the waffle itself contributed no flavor to the sandwich. I do enjoy the location. Bruxie is a good distance from the roundabout which cuts back on traffic, but it's still close enough for a brief stroll to burn some of the calories of that waffle sandwich and milkshake you consumed in about 5 minutes.

I have been to this place more times I can count by now.... It is so bad for me with all the time I have been spending in the gym, but shit, its sooooo good! All of the ones I've tried: Nutella/Banana w/ added strawberries -- always a yummy dessert and very filling. Bacon Egg & Cheese -- how can you go wrong? Always a good breakfast option. REAL bacon, and a perfectly cooked egg. Yes. Fried Chicken -- NO SLAW or HONEY SAUCE. I added mayo and the arugula Pesto to it which made it amazing! Burger - better than most restaurants! So flavorful and fresh! The sodas are all made with real fountain syrup and are very refreshing! I've had the regular, diet, cherry(?), and the cream soda. The berry one was my favorite (cant remember if its cherry or something else. but its good) Seating is limited, but people are usually in and out quickly. The staff is so friendly and helpful. Most people don't know that you can CHANGE ANYTHING on ANY sammich to make it ANY way you want it! If you dont want something on your sammich, ask for it to be taken off. If you see something from another sammy you want on yours, ask for it. They'll do it all. Loves it. Mind you, the lines are long, but quick. And the misters on hot days help bunches :) Cant wait for the new one to open!!

After enduring a hot, long 30 minute wait outside, I ordered my meal and hoped that this wait would be worth it. It was. we ordered the strawberry lemonade (delicious), buttermilk fried chicken, Bacon, Egg, and Cheddar, waffle fries, and the creme bule�dessert. The buttermilk fried chicken was good, and the spices on the chicken made it oh so much better. The waffle fries were decent, but I still think the ones at Chick-fil-A are better. The Bacon, Egg, and Cheddar was delicious, with the perfect amount of cheese and bacon along with crispy waffle.The creme bule�was AMAZING, this one is a must-order. The inside consists of melted yummyness (I can't even describe) along with strawberries. This was by far my favorite item on the menu there, and will go back just to order this again. Another thing I noticed was the fact that the to go boxes are eco-friendly, which makes me appreciate Bruxie even more. The service is friendly, for they pass out menus and waters while people are waiting under the hot sun. The staff also recommends the dishes that are their favorite and explain the menu to the people. After ordering with a staff member near the front, we place our order at the counter and surprisingly received our food quickly. The service is, without a doubt, 5 stars. In general, Bruxie is a fantastic place and worth the 25 minute drive down here for they have tasty food with impeccable service.

Seriously, Downtown Orange is the best! And now Bruxie??? Who would have thought waffles would make awesome sandwiches! Thank god Bruxie did. This is a little outdoor place at the end of downtown Orange and when we got there, they were doing some brisk business. I ordered the smoked salmon waffle and it was delicious. The waffle went perfectly with the salty taste of the salmon. My GF had the prosciutto and Gruyere waffle which was also very tasty. Like a high end ham and cheese sandwich. I highly recommend either. Now, the waffle is not sweet, so don't think it's going to be unless you order from the desert menu. Lots of options but I was too full to try another. That will be taken care of on my next trip here. Service was great, even though you order from a window. Lots of staff around to just make you feel comfortable and bring you your food. Now I really wish I lived in downtown Orange.

While I was visiting family in the area, they recommended this spot and I honestly had my reservations. However, this was one of my favorite places to eat during my trip out there and I wish we had something like this back home in Hawaii. I had the pull pork and it was to die for. For dessert, I had the creme brulee and it was the best thing I ever tasted. I highly recommend this place!

I'll always remember Donkey from the first Shrek movie saying "...and in the morning, I'm making WAFFLES!" It was the way he said waffles with such a toothy grin and such conviction that cracked me up. Anyway, I found myself thinking about this scene while waiting in line here on a Sunday morning around 11am. Anyway, we came by to check it out after seeing it on Yelp's hot list. The line to pay goes by at a reasonable pace, but it's the wait for the food that can test your patience, especially if you're starving and everyone else is enjoying their gourmet waffle sandwiches. I ordered one of their specials on the chalkboard, the green eggs and ham. My wife ordered the smoked salmon and dill cream cheese. Almost $17 for the 2, which is a bit on the high side, especially for a snack. Make no mistake, if you're hungry and have a normal appetite, I think these are snacks. I think I would need a 3-course waffle sandwich meal just to get full. Stomach issues aside (ok, call me a glutton), my green eggs and ham was tasty enough. The green part of the eggs is their pesto sauce. While it was good, I wish there was more of it to balance out the waffle. Come to think of it, I wish there was more of the eggs and ham too. My wife seemed to enjoy her waffle handheld -- I took a bite and nodded with approval. So there seems to be a balance struggle of flavors when eating these waffle sandwiches -- is the star what's inside the waffle or the waffle itself? I tend to think the waffle take center stage, with its crispy exterior shell and fluffy interior texture. Forget the fillings, I think I would've been happy with just a stack of waffles and a vat of maple syrup. 3.5 stars.

a thin slice of proscuitto, perfectly melted gruyere, just the right amount of whole grain mustard, and a sprinkling of chives, sandwiched by an aptly toasted crunchy, bready-textured buttery waffle. i was floating somewhere between cloud 9 and heaven but too elated to know where exactly. the banana nutella waffle with sweet cream was quite indulgent as well. i found it just a smidge too sweet but still amazingly delicious. washed it all down with a huge wild grape soda that will make you smack your lips. bruxie takes the waffle!

yes it is a waffle place that serves chicken and waffles sandwich!!! Yes it was tasty, and yes the sweet and savory was freaking lovely. But I wish I ordered more stuff to try out :( like the burger, or the sweet stuff, or adding gruyere cheese aahhh :( but I didn't wan to ruin the sweetness that came along as is in my lovely chicken and waffle sandwich. note : it is a little pricey, but it is yummy. Next time around I will order all of the above and take photos. I need to bring my camera around :( FAIL!

@bruxiewaffles! My oh my - gourmet waffle sandwiches! 蔛avory or Sweet? I am a fan! After watching Wicked @ the Segerstrom Center for the Arts (see last review), my friends and I headed here for a post Wicked meal. It was a rainy day and Bruxie only has outdoor seating. Luckily the rain didn't scare us away or we would of missed out in super yummy treats :) Since it was raining, there was no line when we came. I found out later that this is a rare occurence at Bruxie because usually there is a super line. When we got there, we were warmly greated by one of the guys working there. He asked if we had been there before and he told us to ask any questions we had on any of the food because he had tried out everything on the menu. The menu has an area for the savory (the meat/cheese type of waffle sandwiches) and the savory (the dessert type of waffle sandwiches). They also have belgium originals or more traditional type of waffles with sugar and syrup on top. The guy working there said the most popular item on the menu was the buttermilk fried chicken and waffle. He also said that one of the specials - Guinness Braised Short Ribs was a popular item and was usually one that would be out by noon but since it was raining, they still had some available. I ended up choosing the buttermilk fried chicken and waffles. I ordered it to go and so the syrup came separate. I was told that usually they put the syrup in the sandwich to give a full flavor. I was actually glad to have the syrup separate. It was my first time to have chicken and waffles anywhere and so I wasn't sure what to expect. I liked it a lot but the syrup for me was definitely more for the waffle than for the chicken. Hmm I still find it so unique to have any type of meat inside waffles but the chicken mixed well with the waffle. I am curious to try other stuff like the burger that they have :) My friends and I also tried dessert here. Ahh if anything, I would definitely recommend saving room for dessert. The dessert waffle sandwich is well worth a try. I got the special strawberry creme brulee! So sweet! So delicious! I liked the creme brulee that was spread in. The strawberries were ok but realy just an additional touch. It was really the creme brulee that made the sandwich. Lastly, I got a side of Belgian mocha, one of their speciality drinks. It was a nice hot drink for a rainy day. More chocolate flavor in it however than mocha. I actually hope that if I come here again that 蔵t will not be raining because it looks like they have some cool treats. They have a frozen custard dessert that sounds delicious. They also have shakes and floats that sound good too! I liked Bruxie a lot! My one wish is that they would do half waffle sandwiches. How awesome would it be if one could get a half savory waffle and a half sweet waffle.

Just came back from vegas and this was the last thing i ate with the boys and will be the first meal i yelp. The joint is nestled in a old town orange in front of Chap U. But the appearance and location is not why i give it a big whopping 5 stars. The Buttermilk Fried Chicken & Waffle, is just wow. Sooo good!, Sooo good.. roscoes aint got nuthin on this joint. if chicken and waffles is southern comfort food they must have meant the OC. The waffle?? a very balanced hybrid of light and fluffy with hearty goodness. while the chicken had a nice crunch on the outside repping being a clean, soft inside. the slaw that was layered between the waffle and chicken was 2die4. 蔭 sweet yet tangy sauce that covered the crunchy fresh cabbage was yum 蕏10. other memorable include: Sun-Dried Tomatoes & Goat: wow what a pairing. �& Bacon, Egg & Cheddar This joint actually gets a 4.7. why?? well a simple �no bathroom policy". yep and i had to go 3 is y'all know what i means =]

I heard it was the best item on the menu and it probably is. I didn't care for the fried chicken which is crazy because, I love me some chicken and waffles but Rosco's this ain't.

4.5 Stars I finally had a chance to try their chicken and waffles and all I have to say is that it's delicious. The waffle was cooked properly, buttery but not too overpowering and the chicken is real tasty. I like the hint of rosemary in there. I also tried the ogura waffles which is an azuki bean and cream filling. Nice and sweet with a little tang. I love these kinds of desert. I can't wait to try their other waffle creations. One thing to note though is that parking sucks, you might have to drive around the block just to find one, but I assure you the food is worth it. 5 stars for the Staff. Very friendly, quick and takes their time to explain each waffle to you. 4.5 stars for the food.

The concept of food trucks is nothing new. 蔊ood food on the go. 蔛omething you can hold in your hand and take with you. 蔔ow you take that same concept but put it in a more grounded location. 蔜hat's what you get with Bruxie. 蔜hey basically serve waffle sandwiches! 蔜hat's right waffle sandwiches. 蔍t might sound absurd at first, but its not. Now they have the basic sweet and savory waffle sandwiches, which is the perfect combination of everything. 蔜he waffles have the perfect amount of sweetness so that it doesn't overpower the savory items nor does it make the sweeter items too sweet. 蔍t just has that perfect amount of vanilla that it acts as an equalizer. 蔜hese waffles are crispy on the outside and light and fluffy on the inside. 蔖retty incredible for something so thin. �These savory items range from the basic breakfast egg, cheese, bacon, and mayo waffle to the burger waffle. 蔣es a burger waffle, and while that might sound crazy at first, it actually works for the reasons I mentioned above. 蔜hey also have seasonal specials. 蔜his gives the menu a lot of depth and range. 蔄lthough I have yet to try the more sweeter items on the menu, I surmise that they are pretty phenomenal. �If i had to suggest some items, I would say get the prosciutto and gruyere waffle sandwich and I would get the bacon, egg, and cheese waffle sandwich. They also serve what I think is the best drink ever. 蔜he creamiscle. 蕋his float is basically a concoction of orange soda and frozen cream. 蔍t is the best think I think I have ever had. 蔔ow I still have to try the black cow and other floats. �Parking can be a bit of an issue, but according to the site it has all been taken care of.

What a cute little gem! �I've been hearing a lot about this place and, after taking my first trip here for their delicious waffle sandwiches, it was certainly worth the hype. �Bruxie is located just across Chapman University, and is frequented by students there. 蔒y 蔲riend (who's currently a student at Chapman) was super cool enough to take me to this awesome little joint. �I think there was a small parking lot behind the building. 蔅ruxie only has outside seating, which is perfect for those who like to people watch. �We ordered the Smoked Salmon 蔭nd Dill Cream Cheese and the S'more waffles to share. 蔕rgasm in my mouth. 蔜he combination of the savory salmon and creamy cream cheese filling with the buttery yet light and slightly sweet, crunchy waffle was perfect. 蔒ost awesome. �The S'more sandwich was dessert heaven! 蔈verything you love about the gooey-ness of s'mores is on a waffle. 蔛ooo good. We ordered the frozen custard treat afterwards and it was DELICIOUS. 蔉rom what I was told, the custard was made from milk imported from Wisconsin. 蔜he custard was thick and creamy, yet light and not over-flavored with vanilla like most custards I've had. 蔜here' something about it..you could definitely taste the freshness of the milk! Who doesn't love waffles? 蔅etter yet, waffle sandwiches!? 蔊enius. 蔍 have yet to try everything and will be coming back whenever I'm in town. �Thank you, Bruxie.

How can you go wrong with anything wrapped in waffle? 蔅ruxie has proved itself to really excel in their namesake of having one of the best waffles I have ever eaten. Crispy on the outside and soft and fluffy on the inside. 蔉ew things in life are as nice as this. 蔜hen to make a sandwich out of it - pure genius. 蔄lso, waffles are much more manly than those sissy ass crepes, and go well in sweet and savory combinations. (I really hated the whole crepe craze - thank God it is moving to oblivion.) It was so difficult to contain my sense of pure ecstasy and limit myself to only a few. 蔍 seriously wanted to try each one. 蔜he green eggs and ham was a delicious combination of a over medium egg paired with ham and pesto sauce. 蔔ice and garlicky and seriously kick-ass over my previous favorite - the Egg McMuffin. Fried chicken was a straightforward crispy breaded chicken with a hint of sweet maple syrup, a wonderful homage to the chicken and waffles craze. Sun dried tomato with goat cheese had a nice amount of greens with the tangy contrast of sun dried tomatoes and goat cheese. The strawberry shake was a seasonal special and extremely thick as they use frozen custard, making it very rich. 蔜hey do blend in fresh strawberries, which presented a texture challenge for my mouth. 蔍'm going to have to try their mint chocolate chip next time. Although there was a line, it went pretty fast as they are very efficient at taking and filling orders. It is a bit of a hole-in-the-wall and there is very little seating. 蔍t is more of outdoor dining with little benches. 蔍 felt like I was eating lunch in elementary school again. 蔜here is also no bathroom, so bring hand sanitizer and take care of your business before coming here. Definitely a place I would come to again. 蔄nd definitely before it appears on Food Network, cuz once that happens - GAME OVER.

When I think of waffles, I think of Eggo waffles, hovering around a toaster, and maple syrup. Never did it occur to me that you could fold them in half and create a sandwich out of them. Bruxie had been on my list for a while so when I recently found myself in Old Town Orange in search of the perfect cupcake, I was pleased when my friend, Theresa Moretti, mentioned she had spotted a cute place for us to have dinner. Funny thing is, I knew exactly what she was talking about and my heart skipped a beat. We were a block away and there was no way I could pass this up. I was a bit taken aback when I noticed this was a small pop-up restaurant. You order at the window and take a seat outside but what sets this apart for other outdoor cafes is the impeccable customer service. They take your name at the window, tell you to grab a seat, and then bring your order as well as anything else you'll need. They also continue to check on you while you're there, have ample heating lamps, and shades. If you're worried about rain, don't be. The entire seating area is covered but it is limited and there are no restrooms so be forewarned. Rumors are that this place always has a line but we lucked out that afternoon and were first in line. I scanned the menu and decided to try the sun-dried tomato with goat cheese. At first glance I was a little surprised by the amount of sun-dried tomatoes in the waffle sandwich. I thought it would overwhelm the taste but in this case, it's really the goat cheese that steals the show however it pairs well with the balsamic, arugula, and basil. 蔖ackaged nicely in a slightly crispy waffle sandwich shell, this was a delicious treat and a hearty dinner. It didn't leave me full, yet I was pleasantly satisfied. As for the fries, I didn't really care of those. Theresa and I both agreed they were a little salty and not quite crispy. After a while they turned soft and unappealing so I ended up tossing most of them out. I don't know if I would order them again unless the recipe changed. What I do love is that they're fried in 100% peanut oil. Aside from fabulous waffle sandwiches, Bruxie is also known for creating some pretty original and unique drinks. I paired my sandwich with their old fashioned pure cane sugar vanilla cream soda which was refreshingly delicious. They also have a selection of shakes and floats and specialty hot drinks like Peets Coffee. If the sandwich isn't enough of a dessert for you, they also serve frozen custard and sundaes. One taste wasn't enough for me. I'll be back to try their other sandwiches.

Why, oh why do you have to be so far, Bruxie? I'd be at your doorstep everyday! Met a few of my friends here last Friday night because they really wanted to try this place. I was game and so was my bud Matthew M. Like a good yelper, I had to order a few things on the menu for my first impression. Here's what I had: Bacon, Egg, Cheddar Waffle: 5/5 Oh, Lord have mercy! I could not believe how fluffy soft my waffle was all while still maintaining a delicately crisp outer texture. It did feel awkward picking up a waffle like a sandwich, but I got over that real quick. I enjoyed the flawlessly crunchy bacon bits that were fused together with the melted cheddar and fried egg. Buttermilk Fried Chicken Waffle: 5/5 AAAMAZING!!! My taste buds were having a field day with the Chili Honey that was slathered on the fried chicken. Would you believe that I faintly recall cole slaw being in there! Waffle Fries: 4/5 Perfectly fried and lightly salted, just the way I like them! Vanilla Creme Soda: 5/5 I seldom drink soda, not because I don't like it but rather because I have no self control. I made an exception this time and had to try Bruxie's Pure Cane Sugar Soda! I utterly enjoyed the sweet, creamy taste of this natural soda pop! I have to stop writing this review because I am totally getting bummed out now! :-(

The girlfriend and I were finally able to cross Bruxie off our list. We ordered the special short rib and the fried chicken waffles. The fried chicken was alright, it was unevenly seasoned so some bites were dry some were overly flavored, and some were just right. I really liked the coleslaw, it gave the sandwich a really nice bite. The short rib was alright, i thought it had the potential to be outrageous, but that didn't happen. In all honesty, once you get over the waffle gimmick, it's just another mediocre sandwich. Slow eaters beware! If you eat too slowly, your waffle will get soggy and disgusting. Recommendation: Eat Quickly

~H e a v e n l y~ OMG This was SOOO good!! My boyfriend had a day off yesterday so we decided to try this place out. For some reason, we kept on mentioning this place but never got the chance to go. BUT, we were so GLAD we did. The place was located in ORANGE right by Chapman University. The only reason why I am not giving this place 5 stars was because of the limited parking and seating. The servers were nice, they checked up on customers to see if they were enjoying their heavenly food. I definitely RECOMMEND: Buttermilk Fried Chicken and Waffle (plus the syrup) Black Cherry Soda Wished we could have tried more...but was fixated on the limited calories I can intake Lol.

FINALLY came here for dinner last night after begging my bf to take me here for the past 5 months. With all the sweet and savory options to choose from, I decided to stick with the original concept which is Fried Chicken and Waffles. The buttermilk fried chicken was moist and the honey chili sauce added a nice touch of flavor. However, it did remind me of that sweet chili sauce asian people use. I would prefer my fried chicken to have more batter or crunch to it though :p But ultimately I would say it tasted just like what I expected it to taste like. Luckily I gave half of my fried chicken waffle to my bf and so I was able to try a dessert waffle. I'm really in love with the Lemon Curd with Berries waffle. My goodness....perfect dessert to cure a horrible day at work.

OMG! I'm in love with this place! I heard about this place from my friend and I have lived in Orange for quite sometime, but never got a chance to visit! I finally went today and the menu was amazing! There were very unusual combination of food, but I always like trying the different combinations! I had the Fig & Prosciutto waffle sandwich. I kept asking the guy at the window if I should get that sandwich because it sounded amazing! He promised that he would return that sandwich if I didn't like it. But, to my amazement, IT WAS AMAZING! The combo of figs and prosciutto went amazing together (the mix of sweet & salty was delcious). All the staff are really nice. The location is great also since it's so close to Chapman University!

I was excited to try this place, and I was actually really impressed with the quality of the ingredients and the service. It might be a bit small for other (my guy friends have repeatedly said so) but I think it's quite big and a good portion. My absolute favorites are: Breakfast Bruxie It usually comes with mayo, bacon, cheddar and egg, wrapped around a perfectly crispy and light waffle. I nix the mayo and sub the bacon with ham. It's like the best breakfast sammich you'll ever eat. Yum. ($5.95) Wild Mushroom(Seasonal) It comes with roasted wild mushrooms (i think it's really only creminis), arugula, balsamic glaze, and goat cheese. I thought this combination was nothing short of amazing. They can over do it a little with the goat cheese, but the mushrooms give the sandwich a rich earthiness, the goat cheese is creamy, and the peppery arugula cuts through the cheese. The balsamic is the perfect touch with a slight sweetness and acidity. Yum ($6.95) Bruxie Burger Typical burger ingredients. Add a fried egg. You're welcome. I'm not that big of a fan of dessert, but they still do it well here. Cons: DO NOT GET THE LEIGE WAFFLE. It's not the same. It's dense and completely a different experience. Pros: The staff is really nice, and they also gave me some tips of "off the menu" items that I shall try the next time. I love the concept, and I'm super glad Bruxie is here in OC!

Yes... I am a repeat offender. Yes, I recognize that I have a Bruxie addiction. Really enjoyed the Bruxie Burger. Good quality meat with crip romaine lettuce, tomatoes, cheddar cheese, light mayo, and cumcumbers! Who'dve thunk? Cucumbers make the burger really refreshing (especially since it's kind of heavy). Winner! Loved the Strawberry Creme Brulee Bruxie! It's very light, crispy, and airy waffle stuffed with fresh cut strawberries, so sweet, and filled with their awesome custard. Brulee'd in just the right places! The friendboy had the Green Eggs and Ham. Slice of ham, eggs, Arugula Pesto sauce, and a mild white cheese! Tasty! First time trying the waffle fries! Sprinkled with sea salt and cracked pepper. Very nice job and great choice of frying them in peanut oil. Added a lil more flavor to the fries. Always a huge fan! P.S. Met one of the owners yesterday. Really nice guy. As is everyone that works there.

An amazing place and innovation in modern food faire. With a delectable menu that will make your mouth water and maybe make you do the cartwheels while in line, Bruxie's gotta be the next big thing in the O.C. With long lines stretched to almost half a block at times, the feeling you get when you get to the counter is just thrilling. Take a glance at the menu and you will see a number of great delights. 蔒y food fantasy began when I locked eyes on the words printed, "Tomato Goat Cheese Waffle." Oh man, was that a good choice. Oh, and I ordered the Orange Creme Float just for fun, too. The Tomato and Goat Cheese was just amazing. Softly melted onto my scrumptuous waffle was the goat cheese that me me go, "ahhh." Secondly, the tomatoes were sweet and tasty. 蔠ashing it all down with my Orange Float made it a perfect afternoon. �I will see you again Bruxie! PROS: new menu, great flavors CONS: pricey (you'll be spending $10+ each time you're here), long lines

So...I finally popped my Bruxie cherry today and I gotta say...oh.my.gawd!! DELICIOUS!! Bruxie is amazing. The concept of waffle sandwiches is ingenious! IT CAN BE DONE =) The bf and I came here around 4pm. Luckily, there weren't any lines. We grabbed a table fast and waited anxiously for our orders. Buttermilk fried chicken and waffle: incredible! This sandwich was simply delightful! Initially, I was afraid that the waffle would be soggy from the oil dripping off the chicken but I was sooo wrong. The waffle was light, crisp and soft. As for the fried chicken, it was warm, juicy and tasted sooo good. The honey chili and the coleslaw complimented the chicken very well. Strawberry creme brulee: I absolutely recommend everyone to try this sweet, sweet treat! Fresh red strawberries with vanilla creme brulee and caramelized sugar was THE perfect finish to a pleasant afternoon. I walked away from Bruxie's very satisfied.

Awesome, clever, delicious. Brilliant even. �All quality meats & cheeses. The Hot Pastrami sandwich was no less than AMAZING, and I love that the waffle does not fall apart when you eat it (I hate sandwiches that fall apart.) 蔜he "Bold Fold" indeed! �My husband inhaled the Fig & Prosciutto. 蔋e would not let me have more than a nibble of a taste, but the small morsel packed a big wallop of flavor. Waffle fries were crisped perfections of goodness. �Sodas are "old fashioned" and listed as "cola, diet cola, lemon-lime" �no label soda at all.) 蔍 recommend the vanilla cream. �I am so impressed with this place, that I'm planning to take my father when he visits us. 蔍t's a 30 mile drive from Los Angeles, but totally worth the gimmick. �P.S. 蔜hey don't have bathrooms on site, but they can point you to the nearest bathroom to use, which is in the large white building (a university dorm, perhaps?) caddy-corner from Bruxie. �A very short, teeny-tiny walk and worth knowing if you plan on guzzling down their cane-sugar sodas!

When I think of Waffles, I think of Kellogg Eggo Waffles. I remember growing up when my parents would make us Eggo for breakfast every morning. I would always drench my Eggo with Aunt Jemima THICK and RICH syrup. I think I was so traumatized eating Eggo every day that I promise not to eat another waffle for the rest of my life. Today, I had to break my promise and go back on my words. Bruxie actually takes Waffles to another level. The best way to describe their waffles are soft and light on the inside and crispy on the outside. Here are my recommendations: *Buttermilk Fried Chicken & Waffles - The fried chicken was perfectly fried infused with Chili Honey and Cole Slaw. Roscoe Chicken step aside Bruxie is now the new King of Chicken and Waffles! *Prosciutto & Gruyere - Simple and Delicious! *Bruxie Burger (BB) - I was BLOWN away by the BB. The Angus Beef was juicy and ORGASMIC! *Waffle Fries - Anything FRIED in Peanut Oil is YUMMY in my book! They tend to get pretty busy so expect to wait 10-15 minutes for your order. The Excellent Service makes up for the long wait in line. If it is your first time, the workers do take the time to answer your questions and make recommendations. There is a limited amount of tables so you may have to eat in your car or standing up. Bruxie has resurrected my LOVE for waffles. You better Leggo my Eggo!

Super Delicious. Novel new concept. Fresh ingredients. Great Quality. We've visited twice now and tried: "Green Eggs & Ham" and "Smoked Salmon & Dill Cream Cheese" "Bacon, Egg & Cheddar" with a side of Maple Syrup "Irish Nachos" "Frozen Custard" Everything has been very tasty! 蔍 especially loved the pesto sauce to the Green Eggs & Ham waffle. �I love that they are environment friendly and use biodegradable plates, cups, and utensils. �It's a small location, with limited seating and parking (mostly street curbside). 蔔o indoor seating. 蔍t's on the corner of a busy intersection. 蔜ry to get there at an off-time to avoid long lines. 蔍t's also right smack by Chapman University so it tends to get packed with student traffic.

Met owner lady who is nice. She said they took the name from brussels airport (Brux) and belgium (ie). Really good customer service. Terrible parking, mostly just street. Fried chicken and waffles is ok, nothing spacial.(2.5/5), a bit spicy even the maple syrup. 蔍 won't be getting this again. �Green (pesto) eggs and ham was very good (5/5), great flavor combination. Waffle fries were pretty good. (3.5/5) Mint chocolate shake was ok (3/5), but strangely tasted better when it was frozen in the freezer. �Strawberry chocolate shake was good (4/5) but then tasted worse when it was frozen in the freezer. �The chocolate for both is a syrup added to the bottom. Kind of expensive but decent. (~$13 a person) Extremely crowded on a saturday at 1:30pm in the hot sun. 蔍 was told by another patron that friday nights are a better time to go.

Having this place bookmarked for years and finally got the chance to go here. It was worth the wait. 蔠e got there before a dinner rush so pretty much ordered, and the food came right out. I saw the special and it reminded me of my childhood. 蔇r. Seuss's Green Eggs and Ham. 蔛ounds weird but the taste was good. 蔖esto sauce with eggs and ham wrapped by a crispy waffle, and i had the strawberry lemonade to wash everything down. �I also got to sample my friend's order. 蔜he Lemon cream and berries. 蔛lightly tarty, and not too sweet made it just right. 蔛he thought that was the best one out of the three we ordered. �The last one was the bacon and egg waffle. 蔍t's pretty much a breakfast plate in a waffle sandwich. 蔜astes like how you would think it would be like.

Fried chicken in the waffle? A 蔿ightbulb went off when I found out about this place. What a genius idea, a waffle-wich! 蔍t's just like Polly's Pies infamous pie-shake: slices of pie blended with ice cream. 蔠ho would've thought? 蔍 found this charming place awhile ago after refusing to spend money on mediocre food at Disneyland. 蔍t's only 10 minutes away and definitely worth the trip for a meal with a great price. We got: Buttermilk fried chicken & waffle $6.95 5 stars for the waffles and 3 stars for the fried chicken. 蔜he waffles were not heavy with the right crisp and fluff. 蔜he fried chicken was nothing outstanding and they can definitely give some more oomph to the batter. 蔜he chili honey and shredded cabbage gave a refreshing sweetness and crunchiness. 蔄 tip: They will ask if you want maple syrup, which I assumed was free but they charge an extra $1. 蔔o biggie, get it on the side. It's delicious. 蔕verall, solid 4 stars for this savory combination we had to order another one after demolishing the first one. Bruxie Burger: $6.95 The burger surprised me the most. 蔍t comes with a beef patty topped with cheddar cheese, tomatoes, pickles, mayo, lettuce stuffed inside a waffle. 蔆an't get any better than that. 蔍 thought this sandwich would be too heavy but it left me craving for more. �.5 stars for the burger Black Cow float: $3.95 This was supposed to be a root beer float mixed with their own vanilla custard and chocolate syrup. It all sounded delicious but just didn't really mix too well. 蔍'll pass on this float. Definitely ask to sample their delicious custards! �Simple concept, great food.

You MUST go here. Absolutely MUST go here. Grab a friend and GO NOW. Can't find a friend who wants to go? Message me, I'll go with you! Don't be intimidated by the line, that thing moves faster than my grandma. Waiting in line is like waiting to get on a roller coaster. You can see it, smell it, and you get more excited the longer you stand there. They have a great system there. When you get in line, someone gives you a menu and goes over it with you. They answer questions, tell you the specials, and offer suggestions if you want them. We got lucky to meet the owner(?) or head chef(?) who told us, "if we have the ingredients, we can make WHATEVER you want." um, yes please. We used that to get a Banana Creme Br瀕巈 waffle....mmmm...yup, I said Banana Creme Br瀕巈. It was like heaven in your mouth. Even better was the Wild mushroom with Arugula and Goat Cheese waffle, holy amazingness. I could have had that as my last meal and been satisfied. The balsamic drizzle inside is PERFECT. Don't like mushrooms? You can get basically the same thing with sun dried tomatoes in it instead. That was delish too! On the okay side was the Smoke Salmon, Dill, Cucumber, and Cream cheese waffle. It was very light and refreshing, but you're eating a waffle sandwich, why do you want light and refreshing. I'm not going to lie though, I would get it again. And yes, you read correctly, I ordered and ate four different waffles (with a friend). That's the way to do it, go with someone and order four or five and share them all, that way you can try multiple. Next time, I am going to try the Fried Chicken one. I'm totally looking forward to it!!!

This is our new obsession. With it's close location to Chapman, we can't help but want to go there every time we are at school! The best things we've had so far are... Johnny's favorite - The Roasted Mushroom and Goat Cheese Sandwich: This "bold fold" combines roasted mushrooms, goat cheese, arugula, sundried tomatoes, and a balsamic vinegar reduction between a folded, savory waffle. My first bite into the crispy fold followed by the meaty texture of the mushrooms, the sweetness of the sundried tomatoes, and the tang of the goat cheese was one bite I will never forget. Nicole's favorite - The Tuna Salad Special: This waffle sandwich combines all the classics of a tuna sandwich, including fresh sliced tomatoes, lettuce, and melted cheese. It's the perfect sandwich on a nice hot day in Orange. We are basically working our way through the menu here and haven't had a bad experience yet. The staff is super friendly and efficient, which helps because that line can stretch on for ages! We love bruxie!

Came back recently with my friend Austin and us gluttons ordered four different waffle sandwiches..... Sun dried tomato and goat cheese -- really enjoyed this one. The goat cheese was a little too heavy -- I would've liked it better had there been a little more greens to counter the heaviness, but it was damn good. Roasted wild mushrooms and goat cheese -- loved the flavor of the mushrooms. The amount of goat cheese in this one worked really well. The flavors melded together perfectly. Buttermilk fried chicken -- I had this on my first visit here and they've actually perfected it so it is more Milanese style rather than a big hunking piece of chicken, They also toned down on the batter and eased up on the honey drizzle. Salmon, dill cream cheese and cucumbers -- my favorite! Totally loved this one. I think I'm going to stick with this from now on.

Went to Bruxie for dinner with a few friends. Parking is scarce, and at night if you're sitting at those tables on the other side of the driveway, you'll be eating in the dark. Worth it? I'd say so. I've never been a fan of waffles for breakfast, but waffles used in a combination of savory ingredients is an awesome idea. The crunch of the crisp waffles gives any sweet or savory filling an almost deep fried texture, without the oily mess you'd expect. Health nuts rejoice... kind of. I had the Bruxie burger which was pretty good. What made it special was mainly the awesome texture of the waffle rather than a soft bun. Finished it off with a sweet strawberry brulee which, in my mind, tasted like a captain crunch berry sandwich--which I loved! Despite sitting in the dark with my friends like loners their service is good. They come out to deliver the goods while you sit, and will even take an order if you're itching for seconds. Even if it's an overhyped/over-yelped place, I'd say to give the place a try even if just once.

The only reason why I knock off a star is because I don't like how it's an outdoor, wait in line, eat outside possibly standing up kind of eatery. It would be awesome if bruxie was an indoor restaurant where people can enjoy themselves without having to have outdoor conditions getting in the way. BUT..the food itself was one of the most interesting things I've ever eaten. And in a good way. I forget the names but I got the one with smoked salmon, cream cheese, and cucumber as a dinner waffle sandwich and the creme brulee with strawberries for the desert one. One sandwich is not enough. The size isn't that big and plus, how can you decide between a dinner and a dessert one? Gotta get both. My friend and I luckily found a seat since we were scoping out the ones who were about to finish but I can imagine that this place gets way busier. As we were finishing up, a long ass line formed out of nowhere. But overall, GREAT sandwiches. Especially the creme brulee one!!!!!

Very juicy piece of fried chicken on a airy, flaky waffle. Great combination, especially with the chili honey sauce. Next time I'll have to try the 100% maple syrup for a dollar more... but that make it an eight dollar sandwich with no sides. Minus one star for price, but you have to obey the laws of supply and demand! Also wish there was a bit more seating, but you can't help how busy this place is. Might have to try that custard ice cream too...

Bruxie is located on the corner of Palm and Glassel. It is right next to Chapman University. Parking can be very challenging, especially on a weekend. You cannot park on Palm because it is for local residents only. There are probably 3-4 spots in the actual Bruxie parking lot, and several spots along Glassel. The location is very well kept and clean. There is only limited outdoor seating available, and simliar to the parking, tables are hard to find on a busy weekend. I came here on a Saturday morning, and there were probably 10 people ahead of me in line. There was an employee with menus greeting us in line, asking us if we had any questions about the menu, and also informed us of their specialties. When you get to the ordering window, they ask for your first name and last initial. Server bring your food to you by saying your name. For my first time there, I tried the fried chicken and waffle sandwhich, which was absolutely delicious. Their fried chicken seasoning is amazing, the waffle is fluffly and crispy, and it's all topped off with honey. You have the option of adding maple syrup for $1. I also tried the strawberry creme brulee waffle sandwhich, which is a MUST if you go there. It's currently not permanently part of their menu, but i REALLY hope it does. They use fresh strawberries, with a sweet creme brulee sauce in a crispy, soft, fresh waffle sandwhich. I HIGHLY recommend you try it!!! Pros: Fast service, delicious food, outdoor atmosphere Cons: Parking, it's a little pricey (two fried chicken waffles, strawberry creme brulee sandwhich, and an iced tea costs roughly $23), limited seating, outdoors. Conclusion: Despite the cons, I will return here many, many times. Their food is THAT good!

Right next to Chapman University, I had the pleasant surprise of passing it on the way to the university - making the mental note to go back. 8:00 pm, and the place was still packed. Outdoor patio seating is available, with a cover over the area, but I took my order to go. Fried chicken and waffles. Decided to stick with the basics today. The servers were friendly and nice, and there is one outside the window to present you with the food or to serve you at your table. You get one waffle, cut in have, with a giant slab of fried chicken. The seasoning and texture is good, and the chicken wasn't too dry, though you get the slight harder texture because you're frying such a thin piece of chicken. It comes on it's own, and you can add the syrup and cole slaw 蕂n the waffle, I think. Well, I drizzled the slaw and syrup and it added so much to the meal. $6.95 for the sandwich, though I was still hungry after wards. The meal was a good, quick bite, more of a snack for me. There is something about the crispy sweet and savory combination that still gets me thinking about it. Definitely looking forward to my next time back.

Bruxie, after craving you for another month, we meet once again. This time I brought my boyfriend so I can steal a bite or three. Busy as always. Arrived around 11ish on a Saturday morning, was lucky enough to spot a lady coming out of her parking spot across the street so we snagged it. Bacon, egg, and cheddar- I'm always drawn to breakfast-y food. It was perfect. Cheese and bacon in every bite. No complaints from my end. Smoked salmon & dill cream cheese- The flavors are fresh and clean (and I LOVE anything with cream cheese). Def stole a couple more bites when my boyfriend went to go say hi to his friends in line :] Strawberry creme brulee- SO GOOD! The strawberries were fresh and in season so they were perfectly sweet. The creme was light.

I think I passed by this place and heard about it from many of my friend a couple of times. Finally on sunday afternoon, my wife and I decided to try out this place. The place is located in the heart of old town orange. A small shack at the corner of Glassell and Palm with a small parking lot surrounding the place. NO restroom posted around the small building with a semi long but fast moving line at the order counter. The place has a good number of tables to eat and some that require standing. It has a nice college atmosphere. I was torn between the salmon Dill and Prosciutto, and ended up with Prosciutto. My wife ordered the buttermilk chicken. I love my Prosciutto & Gruyere, but I am not too fond of my wife's buttermilk chicken. I felt that the chicken lack flavor and a bit too dry. The whole concept of Bruxie is folded waffle with whatever toppings you wanted in the fold. The waffle itself is flavorless but has a nice crisp and went well with the toppings. I give this a 3 star because I was not completely surprised with the flavor of the buttermilk chicken (supposed to be the favorite). I will definitely come back to try the sweet waffle and the their milk shake.

Bruxie does breakfast right. I fiinally made it out here for breakfast bliss- so unbelievably good. I got the Bacon, Egg and Cheddar waffle (includes a light spread of mayo) and added avocado into the mix. I almost died after the first bite... yes, it was THAT good. The egg was cooked to perfection, the cheddar was cheesy and let's face it people... EVERYTHING'S better with bacon not to mention the amazing addition of a ripe, California grown, avocado. �If you haven't been here yet... make it happen and be ready to have a life changing food experience paired with fantastic customer service and plenty of street parking.

I've been back here a couple of times and tried: the wild mushroom waffle: 蔞ery tasty when you are in the mood to eat something that doesn't feel so heavy... no chunk of shortribs, hunk of hamburger patty or slab of fried chicken here. the braised shortrib waffle: you always get me with shortribs... something about slow cooked beef that is heavenly. the chicken and waffle with syrup: 蕋his was one of my favorites here... its a shame that they want to charge you an extra buck just for some syrup. the seasonal strawberry shake: thick creamy goodness... nuff said! I feel like this place will get some occassional visits from me but like I said... it won't be an everyday occurence... parking is a beast around there with all the permit parking only streets and limited lot parking.

Genius happens....in a waffle Take the same usual breakfast fare or things like chicken, fruit and nutela, and they do some-kinda- wonderful in a waffle. It begs it's own vocabulary. It was Waffliscious. So unusual, easily transported and fun to eat. They serve Peet's coffee too so it completes the wafflexperience. My daughter had the iconic waffle straight up and it was light and fluffy and crispy as any other waffle you would get at a Sunday Brunch. For my wife, the eggs and bacon waffle was strong. For me, the nutella and banana was sweet, sugary goodness. Outside seating only, walk up window, so get your casual on and enjoy something really tasty and you'll find your own wafflanguage to express the yummy!!

3.75 Stars We kept hearing about this place from friends and FB, so we thought we'd go and see what the hype was all about. Yup, it was good. We got the Buttermilk Fried Chicken Waffle Sandwich, Strawberry Creme Brule Waffle Sandwich, and Waffle Fries to share between the 2 of us. All for about ~$17. They were all yummy! We went on a Sunday afternoon, and the line was long. They only have 1 cashier, but once you order your food, the wait is only about 10 minutes more. Few tables available, but they turn pretty fast. No public restrooms available. Service was great. They have a lot of employees readily available to run food and help you out. Plenty of street parking, but you might have to walk a bit. Be mindful of the "permit parking only" signs. We'll be back to try other waffle sandwiches. They all looked so yummy.

I've recently been hearing a lot about this place, so I decided to go check it out with a couple friends. Bruxies is in a nice area of Orange, def a cool location, and I would def recommend it for a Sunday chillout daytime date. Parking was fairly easy for me, but I could imagine parking far away when the area gets busy. A couple friends and I ordered the Bruxie Burger, Chicken + Waffle sandwich, prosciutto gruyere sandwich, and some fries. Presentation wise, its very fun and pleasing to the eyes. I do however think this place is overhyped. Don't get me wrong, the food is good, but I was just expecting something more then amazing because of the way people have been talking about it. I think our waffles were overdone, because they were a bit too crunchy, crunchy to the point where it scratches the roof of your mouth, lol. I give this place a 3 because I don't feel like there is anything super special about this place, but the prices are good and the environment is nice. FYI - go peepee before you go to Bruxies, as they dont have a bathroom.

I had Bruxie for the first time today, and let me tell you, it was AMAZING (: I ordered the seasonal favorite: bbq pulled pork and their strawberry lemonade. My friends all ordered their fried chicken and waffle sandwich along with 3 shakes: black kiss, chocolate banana and the dulce de leche. I've been to this area quite a few times, but it's been a good year since then &Bruxie was not around back then. Thank god it's there now ! Because their food is delicious and their service is fast and their workers are super friendly. The only downside is that the stuff here is a little on the pricey side, my boyfriend and I's order came out to ~$25, but the food's so delicious, that it's worth the money. And, there's no where else that serves waffle sandwiches! �So anyways, the first thing i noticed when i took my huge bite out of my sandwich was that the waffle wasn't sweet, weird. But it's yummy ! It's kinda frustrating that i can't explain how the waffle tastes, but it definitely is one of the best waffles i've ever had. If you've ever had an Umami burger, you can relate the umami taste to the waffles at Bruxie's. Unexplainable. But in a totally good way ! Their shakes here are also amazing and a definite must try ! They all cost ~$5 and the cups they serve the shakes in are a reasonable size. Overall, my experience here was fantastic and I totally recommend this to everyone ! It's great food for a decent price and a great place to bring friend to pig out ! (:

There are so many food places that do not deserve the hype that they get (*AHEM ROSCOES*), but Bruxie does! Now I'm not a big fan of waffles and I never thought waffles were great...until they met the buttermilk fried chicken. The waffles were the right amount of crispy and crunch and the buttermilk fried chicken was just perfection. This buttermilk fried chicken is something Paula Deen would approve of!! It wasn't too salty and came with nice coleslaw so that helped! I ate so fast that I had a huge stomachache but it was most definitely worth it. I also had the lemon creme and berry waffle and it was tangy and delicious! The wait was a bit much but it was worth it! and there are NO BATHROOMS!!! And finding parking at 6pm on a monday evening was not hard. There is limited seating so try to order while someone else tries to get a seat! Snoop Dogg and Kanye, stop going to Roscoe's and come to Bruxie. Yeah it'll be harder to say Bruxie than Roscoe's in your raps but its most definitely worth it.

Very excited about trying Bruxie but was more disappointed than anything. I drove 33 miles from the South-bay to OC to try the gourmet waffle sandwich. I got the seasonal pastrami waffle and red bean with sweet cream waffle.The sandwich got soggy real fast, there was not enough mustard to give the pastrami a kick, if they had used a spicy brown mustard I think it would have been better. The red bean and sweet cream was a joke, I was expecting real cream not sweetened cream cheese, that was a real let down. My friend got the chicken and waffles she said it was okay and she also got the sweet liege waffle with nutella. The liege waffle had pearl sugar in it which is suppose to caramelized when cooked but there were just bunch of lumpy sugar in the waffle. The worker came by and asked how was everything my friend pointed out the problem with the liege waffle and he said it is suppose to caramelize but it doesn't always come out the way it suppose to, then why the hell would you sell an inferior product knowing there is no consistency. The food to price ratio was horrible, think about this I got a sandwich waffle which is like a half sandwich since they fold the waffle in half to make it and a dessert waffle for $15.00 then if I gotten a soda and waffle fries add another $5.00 or $7 if I got a shake. (shakes are $5) So for basically $20 bucks I got a glorified waffle meal. Which was not that filling like a lot of people have commented on yelp. To me personally the only thing I would come back for if I was in the area is the frozen custard which was awesome and which is hard to find. Its one of those places where you have to try it once, more novelty that a staple. Lets just say even if I had liked the place a lot it would be a hard place for me to go often because of parking. Yes I went during busy lunch time but having to circle for 20 minutes looking for parking is no fun. Then I had to park in a public lot about 5 blocks away (no joke). There is some street parking in front of Bruxie which is only 30 minutes allowed if you could get one. Which is not enough time to enjoy your meal, the lines can get long sometimes (I give them credit for being fast with the food). Then good luck if you need to wash your hands before eating or if nature calls, there are no bathrooms at Bruxie, you need to drive to city hall for that unless you can sneak into a nearby restaurant or business. There was no wow factor for me, I can say now I have tried it and wont be going back anytime soon.

YUMMMMMOOOOOO! 蔍 had this place on my bookmark for awhile. I remember telling my sister about it and she was like, we gotta try this place! �蔛o FINALLY my sister and I come this friday evening, I already expected a line and yes there was. BUT it moves quite fast and they have a guy that asks you if you have any questions and chats with you a little, I like that. 蔛o we ordered a few things, the Salmon and dill cream cheese, the strawberry cream brulee, the nutella n bananas minus the bananas and with strawberries instead , some iced tea and small custard. 蔜he customer service here is on point. �蔛O we got home and I tasted everything BUT the nutella one, since I hate hate HATE nutella. My moms creme brulee was off the chain! 5 stars for that. It's seasonal so get that one while you can. My sister savored her's and made love to that thing. The iced tea is STRONG, like don't drink that shit at night, or you won't be able to sleep. The custard is delish , I added my own rainbow sprinkles to it at home and it was perfect. Now for my waffle the salmon and dill cream cheese one, I think with savory waffles they should not be folded, but topped onto a waffle, folding it, makes it soggy in the middle, half way through it im picking off the salmon and just eating that with the cucumber. I don't mind a semi sog soft sweet waffle, but not for my savory ones. 蔒aybe Ill sit there and eat it super fresh. �蔕verall, this place is the business and we will be back ASAP!!! Perfect for breakfast ,lunch dinner and dessert. Oh and im buying some gear too, they have cute shirts and hats.

This place is 10 minutes walking distance from my parents house... SWEET! Haha Now I have no excuse to not visit my parents :P Got the buttermilk chicken, it was delish! There's a hint of maple syrup that makes this sandwich perfect. Lemonade was good too, 2.50 with a 1.00 refill, not bad. Got the Nutella and bananas for dessert, they also put a sweet cream along with it thats a bit tart but complements everything. My friends got the burger waffle, loved in, my other friend had the green eggs and ham waffle, loved it, but the best waffle yet was the SMORE WAFFLE. Yum, please get this and you will not regret it. Not too long of a wait 8pm on a saturday night. minus one star for the price, yes the waffle is damn amazing but 20+ bucks seems like a lot to me for a sandwich and dessert waffle from a stand. Actually, maybe just the dessert waffles are overpriced as they run about the same price as an entree waffle. But this place is definitely worth a try if you're in the area!

Ohh, Bruxie...where do I begin?? Parking is definitely limited but you'll find street parking if you just circle around the block once, twice, maybe ten times (haha). Lots of street parking but be wary of permit only blocks & 1 hour parking spots. Came here with Jimmy D. & so glad I did!! We are little piglets!!! Ordered 3 sandwiches between the both of us because we couldn't narrow down our picks! Ha! No shame, I tell you. So we went with the Buttermilk Chicken, Smoked Salmon, & Prosciutto atop Gruyere (probably would've added a Bruxie Burger to that order had I not given up beef for Lent...next time!!!) Okay. Delicious. Okay -- yes, in that order. Buttermilk Chicken - Maybe I've been too spoiled with top-notch fried chicken (popeye's, roscoe's, popeye's, church's, popeye's) but I didn't think this was anything above ordinary. The waffle was AMAZING, though. It was light, crispy, airy & not overly greasy but the chicken was just mediocre. It wasn't as crispy as I had expected & the flavoring was not out of this world. After I added sriracha (yea, that's right, I just went THERE) to the sandwich, it made it soooo much better!!! A friend of ours usually has bacon & melted cheese added to this particular sandwich, gotta try that method next time! Prosciutto & Gruyere - Simply delightful!! Mine & Jimmy D.'s fave! We wanted seconds!! This sandwich was simple, light & full of flavor. 蔜he rich gruyere & tangy grained mustard paired with the prosciutto all sandwiched between the crispy waffle made for a divine union of flavors. Not much else I can say other than it's an absolute must-try for all you prosciutto lovers! You won't be disappointed, trust me. Smoked Salmon - By the time we got to this sandwich, the waffle wasn't as crispy anymore. Perhaps the dill cream cheese weighed it down & made it a bit more dense-like. Or maybe it was time that played a factor. Maybe it was both. Either way, this sandwich was just alright. 蔐ove smoked salmon but could there be such a thing as a little too smoked? Maybe. Also, I can hold my own when it comes to cream cheese but I think they overdid it with the dill on this one. But, hey, if you're a fan, this one's definitely for you. As far as food, I'd give Bruxie 3 stars. But service was sooo on point, they deserve 4! Leave it up to high school/college kids to make sure your time at the establishment is a good one. Kudos to the staff, you guys are awesome. Sidenote, had a bite of the strawberry creme brulee & it was delish!! Reminded me of a warm version of the strawberry croissants at Cream Pan. Yum Yum Yum!!!!

Finally got to try Bruxie waffle sandwich for the first time today. I had Fried chicken in waffle with cold slaw. yum. It was perfect for lunch and I also tried Strawberry creme brulee which was more like a dessert. Other than lack of sitting and parking areas, I have no complaints about the food there. It was scrumptious. I can't wait to try other things on their menu.

My friends have been raving about this place since day one and I finally made it out to experience it for myself and to see what the fuss was all about! Sure enough after I took that first bite of my Smoked Salmon I was hooked. (hooked for life) Their waffles are made to perfection, soft but not soggy, crispy but not so much that your struggling to take a bite. "IT'S PERFECT" The flavors and combination are just brilliant! Whoever opened up this chain must be a brilliant man! *bows* We also tried the Liege Waffle with Nutella and its LEGIT! definitely hit the spot! If your still a BRUXIE virgin you need to go asap! like right NOW at this very moment turn on that engine and GO =) ENJOY! .....Hopefully they remodel soon though so there's indoor seating. But I guess that's what also makes them unique.

This place is delicious! Bruxie didn't let me down. We got: -Smoked Salmon & Dill Cream Cheese Waffle -Buttermilk Fried Chicken & Waffle -Fruit & Cream Waffle and Vanilla Milkshake. �The chicken was crisp and tender. The salmon and cream cheese ratio was on point. The Fruit & Cream waffle was good, but it tasted something similar to Strawberry Jam toast. The waffle, of course, is cooked to perfection and is fresh and crisp at each bite. I highly recommend the Buttermilk Fried Chicken & Waffle and Vanilla Milkshake. The chicken was so juicy and crisp we couldn't stop raving about it after the meal. The vanilla shake is perfect- not too sweet nor bland. It's also located in close proximity to my parents house, so I'll be visiting often. 蔍 heart you Bruxie!

I came here for my first visit and it did not disappoint. 蔜he food here is delicious. 蔍, like fellow Yelpers, am not normally a fan of waffles, but I decided to try Bruxie because of all the great raves. 蔜he sandwiches here were so good and the waffle complemented the flavor and texture of the sandwiches very well. 蔜he waffle was nice, fluffy, and cooked perfectly. 蔍 ordered the braised short rib sandwich and the braised short ribs were tender with a really nice flavor. 蔜he caramelized onions were a nice addition. 蔒y friend ordered the prosciutto and gruyere sandwich and it was nice and light. 蔍t had the perfect balance of meat and cheese to waffle. To top it off, the employees here are really friendly, efficient, and helpful. 蔛ince there's usually a line, the employees ask if you have any questions while you're in line so when you approach the cashier they can just take your order asap. I can't wait for my next visit to Bruxie!

I don't drive to this area that often .. .but when i do ... i always eat at Bruxies! (Lol ... that was my food version of Dos Equis's commercial). Still don't know why there are still haters ... maybe because it's " just burgers " ... and not some foo foo place. 蔅ut hey, that's cool with me ... more food for me. I still enjoy biting into the Bruxie Burger ... the crisp waffle fries ... and their shakes. 蔄lso .. the Wild mushroom was good too. Oh, and I was able to try the Valentine Shake ... strawberries with a chocolate covered strawberry on top a mound of fresh whipped cream ... was so yummy!!! 蔄lso ... yes, also ... got to try the creame brulee. 蔜hat was okay .. only because i felt it was missing the usual thin crisp top layer of caramelized sugar. I'm still hoping they can open up a new location ... some where close to the Spectrum (heck ... even inside the Spectrum would be awesome!). Love the burgers ... and the shakes ... and fries. Only requests ... 1. Organic Ketchup please 2. Waffle Kosher Cheese Dog would be cool 3. a person taking order when the line is more than 15 ppl (like In n Out) 4. Waffle & gravy (ok ... this is a comfort food request)

More like 3.75 stars so far..... Located next to Chapman University, there are many students and family folk here. The line can get long but no matter, it's worth a try. Oh, and errmm....you may want to do extra cardio and weight-lifting before you come here....haha.... Chicken Waffle Sandwich: 蔜he fried chicken, honey, buttery waffle, and coleslaw tasted great all together. Definitely a must try. Though, I wish the waffle was a bit thicker as it was pretty much overshadowed by the big piece of salty fried chicken and delicious coleslaw for the most part. Liege with Nutella: 蔐OOKS great, SMELLS great but....this was sort of a miss for me. The waffle was very dry. The taste was sweet and the overall texture was simply on par, nothing special - I was missing the softness and "light crisp" that was proclaimed by the service team. I was just getting a bunch of super dry crumbs and powdered sugar. Is a Liege waffle supposed to be like this? I don't know....I don't really like it :T Sodas: 蔄pparently they serve "old-fashioned sodas." I actually did taste the difference in their soda (ahem, real sugar!). We got the orange and cola and it was really yummy and not that stupid syrupy soda taste. I would totally get 蕋he sodas again. Seating / facilities: 蔜here is not a lot of seating and it is all outside or partially outside. There are no bathrooms. There is no sink to wash your hands. There is not a lot of parking (street parking worked perfectly fine for us!). Sort of a bare-bones kind of place but the Bruxie sign is huge and hard to miss! Easy to find! I will come back here if I'm in the area again...the salmon sandwich sounds intriguing!!

Holy High Heaven, Mother of Earth! 蔅ruxie has changed my life! 蔄fter a long hike at Santiago Oaks, we were hungry. 蔐ike, we hiked a few hours without eating breakfast hungry. �Where to eat? 蔄-ha! 蔅ruxie was only 10 minutes away, so I had to drag my buddy there! 蔣es, parking can be a bit of a pain. 蔜ip: 蔒ake sure you pay attention to parking signs to see if you are allowed to park there! So we get there and to my surprise, I only waited 5 minutes to place my order, and another 15 to get my food. I followed suit and ordered the buttermilk friend chicken waffle with maple syrup and a few dashes of hot sauce. 蔍 wished this place existed during my clubbing days in LA 10 years ago, and no, I don't mean Roscoe's. 蔒y waffle was perfect, the chicken was evenly spiced, and adding maple syrup and hot sauce heightened the magnificent flavors of savor and sweet. 蔕n top of that, I washed mine down with the lemonade. 蔕h yeah, delicious. We both agreed that we'll be back.

Waffle sandwiches = GENIUS It's a gourmet outdoor shack. �) 蔣ou order at the window...they call out your name when your food is ready & you'll probably end up standing at one of their outdoor tables (I think they should convert that whole "parking lot" into sit down table areas...even patio furniture would be welcome). 蔜here's no restroom for you to use and parking is on the street basically. 蔇oesn't sound like fun? 蔠ell, the food and service far exceeds your expectations. �I love sandwiches...and love the idea of having crisp waffles as my "bread" instead. 蔔ot only are the waffles great but the filling inside their creations are great too. 蔍've been a couple of times & here's what I've tried: -Bruxie burger = yum!! �Has the standard burger fixings but the two burger patties inside the waffle are really, really tasty. 蔍t is cooked medium and is really juicy/tender. 蔍 like this one a lot and I don't usually eat burgers. -Green eggs & ham (special!) = creative but a bit salty for my taste buds. 蔍t has a giant egg cooked over-medium with pesto sauce on top; sliced ham and cheese. 蔠hen you first eat it, it's really good...savory and the flavors are great. 蔄fter it sits for a bit though, it gets saltier and saltier...I think it's the ham because when it gets cold it's less appetizing. 蔍t's pretty good but I need to limit saltiness. -Strawberry creme brulee waffle (special) = double yum! =) 蔍 am not a sweets person...I much prefer savory BUT I am a fan of creme brulee in general and this waffle does not disappoint. 蔜he custard and sugar are not overly sweet & adding fresh cut strawberries makes this really good. 蔍 wish this were a regular menu item but berries are seasonal so I will eat this while I can! -Fried chicken & waffle = my favorite!! �) 蔍t's a fried chicken breast (infused with rosemary and other seasonings) inside a waffle with fresh coleslaw and a honey glaze. 蔍t's DELICIOUS. 蔜he chicken is super tender and juicy...the chili honey glaze is sweet and compliments the chicken nicely...coleslaw gives some nice crunch. 蔍 love this sandwich! The ingredients for everything are fresh & you can definitely taste it in the food. 蔜hey also make giant milkshakes, have pure can sugar sodas, frozen custard, tons of dessert type waffles, and hot drinks like coffee, tea & hot chocolate. �There's almost always a line here...it's a great spring/summer time spot to grab lunch - I want to try the gruyere & prosciutto...I just somehow end up getting the fried chicken & waffle. �) 蔇efinitely returning whenever I get sandwich cravings. =)

Whoever thought of waffle sandwiches should be given a Nobel Prize. Their food is delicious and filling. At first I was expecting it to be a little cafe or something, but it's actually a small shack in downtown Orange with outdoor seating in the corner parking lot that it sits in. Seating is covered by umbrellas, an overhang connected to the shack, and heating lamps to accommodate for cold weather. You order, find a seat, and the servers will bring you your food when it's ready. It was a surprisingly efficient system. Braised short rib (seasonal) - this thing's huge. Tons of beef shoved into the waffle, topped with fries and ... cheese? Horseradish? I couldn't really tell because it tasted like two things at once. Either way, it was savory, filling, and my taste buds cried with joy. So did I. Hash and eggs (seasonal) - the flavor's so strong it'll punch you in the face. In a good way. Definitely awesome if you're in a breakfast-y mood. Particularly if you love hash. Lemon cream and berries - perfect for dessert when you're starting to get full. Just the right amount of flavor in the cream - not too sweet or strong - and the berries are fresh and ripe. I would definitely get this again. Strawberry creme brulee (seasonal) - if you like creme brulee, this is a huge step up from the usual custard in a dish. Fresh strawberries, custard, and burnt sugar bits mixed together in a fluffy waffle. DO IIITTT! Waffle fries - basically just criss-cut fries. Nothing spectacular about them, but still tasty. Creamsicle float - it's like drinking the popsicle and comes in a bigass cup. Loved it, but couldn't finish it considering I was dying by the end of the meal. I came on a Saturday afternoon around 1pm. Bad idea. It took 20 mins to get to the ordering window. We were lucky to find seats (had to take over the other half of a longer bench that was already partially occupied). However, people there are friendly, and the staff are even moreso. They'll give you menus, explain the specials, and answer any questions you may have while waiting in line. They'll also check on you while you're eating. If you can, avoid going during peak lunch hours during the weekend. I do, however, think the wait was worth it :D TL;DR - outdoor seating, awesome food, go.

I think "Meh. I've experienced better" pretty much sums it up. I had high expectations for the waffle part of the sandwich but it was actually quite bland. Seriously, order one, and break off a piece of just the waffle. Bread can make or break a sandwich, so if you're going to swap the bread out, the replacement better hold its own. Although it wasn't quite as much of a fail as Marked5's early attempts to make a rice bun, Bruxie's waffles lack any substantial flavor. The actual ingredients between the waffle weren't too shabby, but nothing spectacular. The fries were delicious, though. Overall: meh.

ONNOMNOM, best waffle sandwich joint I've ever tried! Bruxie is delicious, man! Came here for a lunch date with my friend V, who definitely approved of this place and must I say the topless guys too! The two of us shared the Bruxie Burger, Prosciutto&Gruyere, Waffle Fries, and Lemon Cream&Berries. By the time I finished the delcious prosciutto&Gruyere and fries, I was way to full for the other half the burger. The burger was only "aokay". The waffle fries were so good and so much better than chikfila's dry tasteless wfries. Because I am a slow eater, by the time I got to the lemon cream&berries, the waffle was a little soggy but still good! Do be advised that parking can be a little hard to find in the day. I'll definitely swing by this place whenever I can!D

I really really wanted to like this place. I read a review on LA Times and had to check it out. But it was 2.5 stars at best. My husband and I have been on a quest to find the real Belgian waffles since we were in Belgium 6 years ago. There are 2 types of Belgian waffles, Brussels style and li巊e style. 蔜he former has light, airy and crispy texture and made with batter. 蔜he latter is dense dough pressed on a hot waffle iron, which makes the sugar crystal chunks in it to caramelize in the most scrumptious way. �Unfortunately, bruxies failed to come even close to the real ones. 蔈ven the coffee bean and tea leaf, with their mass produced waffles, had it closer to the real thing when warmed up. Food and price is 2 stars, but the service was better. I guess the search continues on for the perfect waffles.

3.5+ stars, but I am rounding up. The food here is good nothing tremendously special, but worth trying for sure. The prosciutto and gruyere is probably the best thing on the menu. Salty and savory it is really delicious. I am also a fan of the dill and cream cheese with smoked salmon. It is refreshing and good, but I guess it's hard to go wrong with such a classic combination. The other things I have ordered are not very memorable and the worst is definitely the chicken and waffle which was greasy and oddly seasoned. The belgian hot chocolate is rich, the frozen custard is sub-par, the seasonal date shake was gross. Also, if you're coming in hungry you most likely won't get very full so it is expensive in that sense. Overall, it is a bit of a drive so unless my friends are driving me out there I would not make the drive out on my own, but do try it if you have the opportunity.

the description of 3 stars is perfect. it was A-OK. the concept of having a waffle as the breading of a sandwich is definitely not too new, but nothing that i would have imagined to market in a business. this place seems to have taken the idea, and really run with it and grabbed a great audience. however, my take is that there's a reason WHY the breads used for sandwiches are used for sandwiches. but we'll get into that. this is a casual place with a line outside, and seats outside with a first come, first serve concept. it's got a great audience and it's a good place to do your own thing and not feel like you have to get involved with those who are working. stand in line. order. fried chicken waffle sandwich and the prosciutto and gruyere sandwich. find a seat. and people... *don't reserve a seat if you're going to get in line AFTER. that's just selfish and unnecessary. you're going to find a seat because people are going to get up. that's just a simple note. * they yell your name and bring the order to you. hot sauce and ketchup and such are on a table at the side for self-serve. perfection. chicken: the fried chicken was HUGE and nice and juicy. not so conducive to hold and eat as a sandwich because the waffle is so thin and the chicken so thick and sticky with the maple syrup. we really enjoyed the sauce on the breading, however. the crispiness could have been a bit more crispy with more bite, but the chicken really was delicious with the maple combination. prosciutto: nice and thin, perfect to eat as a sandwich. the cheese was nice and sharp, melted on the waffle, with the dijon mustard giving it a nice kick with the saltiness of the prosciutto. i would get this again, over and over and over. but here we are, back to the concept of this place. the waffles are just trying to replace the bread. which is great and creative. but both my boyfriend and i had the rough patches you get after eating something that is sharp and rips the rook of your mouth. the rest of the day is trying to avoid eating anything that will make those parts hurt. that is not really a plus in my book. the sandwiches were A-OK. really. nothing horrendously bad. but you know, nothing worth giving more to. i can't say i'm a fan, bruxie, but i would probably go back to you, just cuz you're not a sit-down, time-consuming restaurant that requires a dress and stilettos.

Get the Prosciutto & Gruyere Waffle, you won't regret it! 蔍 came here with 6 friends or so and we all ordered something different so we could get some variety. While in line Exec Chef Phillipe came by and gave us the lo-down on his belgium waffles and what was popular. 蔋e was a really nice guy, I took a picture with him too. �All the workers there were really nice and they checked on us to make sure everything was good. 蔛uprising because this joint dosn't seem like the place to have that level of service, there is a stand up counter on one side of the place and 5-6 small tables on the other side outdoors which is first come first serve. So onto the food: Fried 蔆hicken- one of the most popular ones, it was good nice juicy and tender chicken. The breading had a little seasoning to it. 蔍'm not sure if I liked it with the syrup. 蔍 wish there were some more options for sauces, I'd give it 3/5. Proscuitto and Guyere- This was soooo good, it didn't look like much but when you bite into it, the cheese tastes soooo good. 蔍 only had a couple bites, but next time I'ma get the whole sandwich just for myself. Braised Short Rib Waffe (special)- This isn't normally on the menu, it was good, look like pulled pork kind of and had some cheese on it. 蔍t was relaly meaty and juicy. 4/5 Smoked Salmon & Dill Cream Cheese- 蔄lso really delicious, my friends really enjoyed this a lot and ended up getting more. 蔍 thought it was just okay though, I'm not a huuuge fan of salmon though. Bruxie Burger- kind of like a regular burger in a waffle, it was good but nothing mind blowing �.5/5 Waffle Fries- Really good, make sure you get a side Strawberry lemonade- A little too tangy, but still good One small thing to nitpick is the lack of a bathroom, there is some hand sanitizer, but if i'm eating wtih my hands, I generally would like to wash them. 蔜here is a sign on the building saying sorry about that, but because of the building design there is no way to have a restroom. Overall a great meal with great service and food. 蔜he wait was a little long maybe 20 minutes but it was well worth-it. 蔆an't wait to come again!

OMG. 蕋alk about DELICIOUS! So Trina D. mentioned this place to me not too long ago because she was bummed a friend was going and she couldn't go. (I'm pretty sure she worked it out so she could go....see her review) My friend and I headed down to Bruxie since it was on the way from my house to his office. 蔍t's a little stand right across the street from Chapman University. 蔠e were very lucky and got a parking spot right across the street. Luckily the line wasn't long, even though it was a Friday night, but man, it was busy. 蔖eople just kept coming. 蔜he two kids expediting the orders were *super* friendly, and the guy told us when he saw us back in line so that I could get my frozen custard, I could have ordered it at the same time as my sandwich and just told them that I would be back for it so I wouldn't have to stand in line again. 蔜hanks for the tip! So I got the chicken and waffles - obviously highly recommended - and something I would have probably ordered anyways. 蔕h man, drizzle that chili honey on and so good. 蔍 wish there was more coleslaw to go on my sandwich, but that's okay. 蔜he chicken, the waffles. 蔣um. 蔒y friend got the egg sandwich and he couldn't stop talking about it. To drink I got a Belgian mocha and he got a lemon-lime soda. 蔜hey don't serve the usual name brand beverages here. Instead they are all sodas made with real cane sugar. �After finishing up, we went back for my frozen custard. 蔋e opted for a Belgian hot chocolate. 蔜he custard was SOOOO good. 蕁ice and thick. 蔜asted like I was really eating custard...that was frozen. 蔜he hot chocolate tasted like a dark chocolate candy bar. 蔛o good. Definitely worth the outing, glad we stopped by. 蔠e'll probably stop by again.

Love this place. 蔠ill frequent when in town. The good: - Roasted Mushroom and Goat Cheese (so delicious!) - Corned beef and hash (beef is cooked well and chunky) - Brussels waffle is exquisitely light and fluffy The decent - Fried chicken and waffle (first visit was served chicken breast tenders and second visit was served more like chicken fried steak. 蔖referred the chicken breast tender pieces. I like it because it's less greasy than traditional breakfast places like Dinah's. 蔐earned from first visit to request mine without honey the second time.) The ugly - 蕇'mores which are way too sweet and unedible even for sugar freak kids!

Bruxie has invented a type of food combo that only a stoner can come up with. The owner had to be high as shit when he thought about this idea. He is also a pretty chill guy, he often stands outside in the line and gets a feel for what he thinks you might like. 蔞ery helpful if you ask me. There are two main categories for me at Bruxie, Dessert and "Savory." Let me give you a hint... get high and TRY THEM ALL!

ROFL MY WAFFLE. Get these: Prosciutto & Gruyere, Strawberry Creme Brulee. Also had: Braised Short Rib, Lemon Fruit Tart The Prosciutto is definitely legit. Strawberry Creme Brulee is reminiscent of a Cream Pan strawberry croissant, but in waffle form. YUM Braised Short Rib was too "meaty". Lemon Fruit Tart was pretty sour (and I like sour stuff), but was really good. Some maple syrup or something sweet in there and it would have been legit. I ate 2.5 bruxie's(?)/waffles and was not even full. $30 later. Sadness, but we got sorta lucky on a Tuesday night at 7PM with a parking spot nearby and barely any line. Pretty expensive, but next time, I'll try the Salmon!

Tried another new items on the specials boards, hot pastrami! I am a HUGE fan of pastrami, I will almost always order pastrami sandwich if it's on the menu, and I was so excited to finally see it on Bruxie's menu, but this is the first Bruxie waffle-wich that I honestly did not enjoy, at all. There was so much grease, it soaked through the waffles so bad that it wouldn't hold together, the messy wet slaw didn't help... I had to eat it with a fork, forget about the crunch that I always look forward to biting into a Bruxie waffle-wich... I get that pastrami is fatty, but this was just too much, half the meat was pure fat, it was quite disgusting to bite into a mouthful of dripping fat tissue. Needless to say, I couldn't finish it, and was left disappointed and unsatisfied from my usually fantastic Bruxie experience. Will stick to the regular menu next time.

Where. To. Begin. Now I finally understand what all this Bruxie fuss was all about. Waffle sandwich with fried chicken? I was thinking, what's so different about this place compared to typical joints that have been popping up all over the place with this chicken and waffles trend? Heck even IHOP has it. But oh whatever I'll try it anyways. AND I WAS SO GLAD I DID. We tried the fried chicken waffle sandwich, the mushroom and herb cream cheese sandwich, strawberry creme brulee sandwich, and the lemon cream and berries sandwich. All were absolutely amazing. The chicken waffle wasn't as heavy as I thought it would be. The lady who recommended it to us pointed out that they marinate the chicken for 24 hours before cooking it. The coleslaw that they serve with the sandwich is PERFECT with the meat. If you're feeling like a lighter meal, the mushroom and herb cream cheese waffle sandwich is the way to go. Now I know it sounds kind of gross, pairing up a waffle with creme cheese and mushrooms. But honestly, the waffle isn't your typical waffle. It's just like, a light bread with a fluffy and crinkly waffle texture. The mushrooms were so juicy and yummy, so deliciously combined with the herb cream cheese and arugula as well I didn't know what to expect when I saw that creme brulee could be fit into a waffle. But oh my goodness when I took that first bite, I asked myself how could I have not tried this before?! The strawberries and custard from the creme brulee--absolute perfection. Now I've never been a fan of lemon cream much, just because I was afraid of how tart it could get. But AH! This lemon cream had such a light tart to it, but still just enough of a lemon flavor. I don't know how they do it. But it was grand. Lastly, did I mention that they have the best service? Not only did the lovely woman give us the best recommendations, but the chef (I believe named Kelly?) was oh so welcoming! He even gave us complimentary frozen custard! The best. I'm definitely coming back again and will not stop raving about this place until the whole world has heard.

I've never been into waffles but hands down this place completely changed my mind. After my girlfriends and I went for a hike in LB we drove down to Bruxie for some waffles (defeats the purpose of working out right? Lol) This place beat my expectations and I cannot wait to introduce it to my sisters and BF! I had the lemon berry waffle and it was divine! The waffle wasn't heavy at all surprisingly, it was light and so tasty! Cannot wait to go back! Great vibe & love that it's cute & little. If you haven't tried Bruxies then you're missing out...plain and simple ;)

Stevenenen is the best because he often indulges me in my weekend breakfast food cravings, which is totally awesome because it is much more fun to good on a food hunt with someone rather than alone. 蔛o, recently, we ventured out to Orange to try out some waffle creations by Bruxie. 蔍t was a Saturday morning, and there was a small line of Chapman college kids trying to get their hangover-cure breakfast goodies. 蔛tevenenen and I couldn't decide on what we wanted, so we decided to go all out and order 3 sandwiches, fries, coffee, and root beer- and share it all �burp*. We had the breakfast sandwich, with eggs, bacon, and yumminess, with the maple syrup dip. We also had the hamburger waffle, and fried chicken waffle. �Surprisingly, the fried chicken sandwich was the least favorite- not a lot of flavor. 蔍 was a bit disappointed, because I was looking forward to that one the most. 蔜he breakfast sandwich was the clear winner, and I think about it a few times a week now- I must go back! 蔜he hamburger was surprisingly good- nice if you are looking for a heartier meal. Don't let the thought of a sweet waffle bun freak you out- the waffles are not overly sweet. 蔜he fries, though, are overly salty- at least the batch we had. 蔐ike waaay to salty. 蔜humbs up for the ice water dispensers on the side of the building. Go for the chill vibe, and one of the best breakfast 'wiches in OC.

DONT' PASS THIS PLACE UP JUST BECAUSE YOU CAN'T FIND PARKING!! 蔇o what we did...drive a block down Palm (the street to the right of the Bruxie stand), make a right on Olive, and then park in the Chapman College parking structure located on the right (free on the weekends) and walk the 2 minutes to the stand - you will be happy and stress free and enjoy your Bruxie that much more. 蔅esides, there's no public parking allowed on Palm, so there you go. As for Bruxie....yum yum yum!! We were excited to try this spot out, especially since my friends gave it good reviews. 蔠e waited in line for about half an hour and then less than 10 minutes after getting our order to go (by the way, I think this semi-ruined our experience...more on that later). 蔜he service here alone deserves 5 stars - everyone is so friendly and helpful and they genuinely look like they love their job. �What we tried: Corned Beef Reuben (seasonal special): delicious! 蔭t first i was afraid that it had too much sauerkraut but after a few more bites, we thought it was great. 蕋he corned beef (boar's head brand) is delicious Buttermilk Fried Chicken: the chicken itself was awesome. i didn't care for the chipotle honey sauce or the coleslaw. 蕋here was something in the coleslaw that tasted off to me, but if i get it next time, i just won't eat that part. Bacon, Egg, and Cheese: hands down, the BEST thing we had. 蔵 like the fact that they don't use crappy quality bacon - it's thick cut and sooo delicious. 蔍 forgot to ask for no mayo (the thought of mayo on my waffle freaked me out) but they don't use much and I honestly forgot it was on there. 蔍t was perfection. S'mores bruxie: get it, you won't regret it. 蕋hat's all i have to say about that. Strawberry Shake (seasonal): something about the wisconsin custard makes this shake thaaaaat much better than any other shake ever. get one! So, pretty glowing review eh? 蔄nd yet, I don't think we'll go out of our way again to get over there any time soon. 蔠e thought it was great but I think the fact that we took it to go and walked back to our car really affected the quality of the waffle. 蔍t was still good and tasty, but I think I was expecting a toasty crispiness to the waffle that got too soft from being in the bag too long (and it was only in there for a few minutes). 蔠e will be back, but when we have time to find a place to sit and enjoy it right then and there.

Went back and got the strawberry cheesecake. THAT THING IS BOMB! Graham cracker crumbs, fresh strawberries, strawberry jam, and sweetened cream cheese. Oh, and powdered sugar to top it all off. It wasn't too sweet because the strawberries balanced that out. Ate half, went home and put the rest in the freezer. Frozen strawberries... yummmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm

Second time at 蔅ruxie was as great as the first...maybe even better. 蔍 ordered the Tuna Albacore Melt, which was their seasonal special. 蔍t was so good...although I will honestly say that I do like the Buttermilk Fried Chicken one better. However, I ordered a sweet sandwich this time and it was heaven. 蔒y friend and I shared the Strawberry Cheesecake, and it was so yummy. 蔍t wasn't too sweet and I like the graham cracker crumbs and fresh strawberries in the sandwich. �What I love there is their customer service. 蔠hile my friend was carrying our order to my car, the paper bag ripped and all of our waffle fries fell to the ground. 蔍 told one of the servers, and he immediately gave us a new order of fries. 蔍n addition, while we were waiting in line in the hot sun, servers gave us cups of water to keep us hydrated.

Hot list on Yelp!! Waffle sandwiches!! One word was uttered, "Bruxie" and Giancarla E. was on top of that like white on rice! Small stand w/some table seating a limited parking, good to go on off peak hours! 蔛cored a nearby parking spot AND seating! 蔍'm sure that helped to give us a better experience lol. Had to have the chicken n waffle sandwich despite the 50/50 dis/like votes. 蔍'm definitely on the "like" side! 蔇elicious! 蔎uicy white chicken breast breaded perfectly atop of a nice crispy waffle w/the right amount of chipotle honey and very crunchy coleslaw that really went well w/the dish. 蔣ummm Giancarla had the first bite and already decided on lugging three of them home lol, so I was definitely excited to try it and it did not disappoint! 蔊ood portion too. 蔠affle was just waffle.. no special seasonings or anything, just a good waffle. �Tried one of the dense dessert waffle too, but I had a bite when it was cold so it wasn't the same. The smoked salmon, cucumber and cream cheese waffle was not bad, but the taste combo isn't anything that elevated to a new taste experience.. the diff tastes were fine together though. Had some strawberry lemonade too, too sweet for me. Did I mention they were playing non stop bob marley? 蔲reakin' score

I have been dying to come here! I heard about their seasonal strawberry creme brulee and once I heard about it I was determined to try it. It honestly met every high expectation I had. It's basically a waffle sandwich (where the waffle isn't really sweet but more airy and bread like) with creme brulee (that is actually torched onto the sandwich) and strawberries. Honestly, it was pure bliss. The creme brulee was gooey because of the warm waffles yet there was the crust that made the sandwich crunchy. I literally inhaled it within maybe 8 minutes. It came to around $6.50 with tax and it was worth every penny. I even asked one of the workers how long this particular item was going to be in season and she rest assured that it would be on the menu probably for the entire summer. I felt relieved because that meant I could enjoy it for that much longer and would not have to drive out there every other day to satisfy my future cravings, which would be highly likely. We went between meal times and on a Friday so we didn't have to wait long, actually we didn't have to wait at all. Seating consists of a few tables next to the building, maybe 6 tables under the tent and 2 in the parking lot. They also have a counter you could stand at. But SERIOUSLY....my friend said it the best "my tummy is really happy" and I couldn't agree more.

Delicious. Simple. And so much fun to eat! Bruxie is a unique concept that makes savory and sweet waffle sandwiches. One of my favorite childhood memories is getting a ice cream waffle sandwich every summer on the New Jersey Boardwalk growing up. It was the combination of a warm, crisp and just-sweet-enough waffle and sweet, cold ice cream that I just adored. After hearing about Bruxie, I had to try it out. What genius it is to combine sweet and salty, savory flavors - and Bruxie does it so well. Service is smiling and happy, lines are long but move fairly quickly. Tables are hard to come by, so we stood. I tried the buttermilk chicken waffle. This was absolutely delicious. The chicken was moist and flavored with a delicious chili oil, the waffle was crispy and complimented it perfectly. There really isn't much fuss that went into the sandwich -- just a perfectly crisp waffle, fried chicken, some heat from the chili and a little bit of coleslaw. We had the Irish Nachos as well, waffle fries, sour cream, cheese and bacon. They were delicous, but can you go wrong with those combination of ingredients? No. Although the cheese sauce was delicious, the texture was a little off, it wasn't as smooth and creamy as a cheese sauce should be. But I didn't put too much thought into it, after all there was bacon in front of me. My husband had the burger and enjoyed it immensely. For dessert, we had the Smores Waffle and the Lemon Cream. I loved the lemon, it was tart and sweet, and the berries were very fresh. My husband loved the Smores, but it actually didn't really do anything for me. I thought it was alltogether just too sweet, and wished the marshmallow would have had much more of that toasted flavor and texture. Also, there was a hair on top of the dessert waffle, so of course no one really wants to see that. Despite a few small things, Bruxie was very delicious and I would definitely try it again if I find myself in Orange County again, the waffle sandwich concept is very original and fun!

FAB-U-LOUS. This is honestly my favorite restaurant in Orange County. They take on a whole new twist to the concept of a waffle. The sandwiches are fairly large, so you could grab a soda and sandwich to be completely content in the stomach, but if you have the capacity, I would highly recommend a side of their magnificent waffle fries and a shake. I normally get the bacon, egg, and cheese sandwich because it sticks to the "breakfast" theme that I so enjoy, but the hamburger one and the seasonal ones always look interesting. Protip: ALWAYS take a peek at the seasonal menu!!! I found a few milkshakes on there that aren't on the menu, including mint chocolate and date shakes which were made to perfection. I am a mint fan, and was extremely pleased. The cup was huge and the chocolate was evenly and generously distributed. Their specialty sodas are on point as well [specifically the black cherry one] and they even serve "black cows" (root beer floats with chocolate). Steely Dan would be proud. TL;DR: Amazing waffle sandwiches, but even more amazing shakes. - pawl e.

The waffles here are really something. I had the fried chicken and waffle waffle, while my friend had the Green Eggs and Ham waffle (seasonal/special of the day). For dessert, we split a nutella and banana waffle and a lemon cream and berry waffle. First off, let me say that I was really surprised that the lunch we ordered was not super heavy. The waffles were all quite light and crispy, and not super sweet, even in the sweet waffles. I liked the fried chicken and the lemon cream and berry waffles the best. The fried chicken was seasoned nicely, and the coleslaw in the sandwich was good also. The lemon cream and berry together were really awesome as well. The place never got overly crowded, though I sure expected it to because of the great reviews it gets on Yelp. There were plenty of people there, but the service was quick, and there always seemed to be enough places for people to sit or stand and have lunch. Definitely worth trying.

Bruxie is a good place to eat for breakfast, brunch, lunch, or a mid-day snack. I tried the chicken and waffle and the salmon, dill, and cream cheese sandwich. The chicken and waffle sandwich, stuffed with cabbage, may sound like a crispy, oily, greasy heart attack. However, the lean chicken, fresh cabbage, and light sweet sauce makes this sandwich taste healthy. It really was a different take on what I imagine Chicken and Waffles to be. Because I think of the Roscoe's version, the syrup-y, oily, greasy, heavenly heart attack (which I love). But the Bruxie's gourmet sandwich is definitely not that, so I guess it just depends.. I really like the salmon, dill, and cream cheese sandwich though. It's perfect for a light meal. It tastes fresh. And I would definitely go back just for this sandwich. Most of my stars go out to it's customer service. This sandwich place is found on the corner of Glassell and Palm St. and is a not an indoor seated restaurant. Costumers line up along the sidewalk, order their food at a window, and find a seat or stand at high tables outside. Even with this restaurant set up, the workers are efficient when giving customers their food. The workers ask for the customers name at the register with no number given at all; when the food is ready, they find the customers themselves, making others feel more welcomed.

I tried Bruxie on a Sunday night because it's been the IT place of the moment, at least here on Yelp. I can see parking being a royal pain on Fridays or Saturdays but I guess they can't do much about that. The place is not what I expected. It's a small food stand with no more than like 10 tables? On the day I came, it was drizzling so make that 8 tables since there are a couple with no cover over it. I read a few other reviews here and I employed the same strategy of basically standing next to a table to "claim" it was yours. It worked but it was a bit awkward? I came with 3 other people so we decided to try four different waffles to split. Here are my ratings: Fried Chicken (3.5/5) - much better than the Haven version I have tried down the street Proscuitto + Gruyere (4/5) - reminded me of a grown up ham and cheese croissant! Wild Mushroom (seasonal) (3/5) - very odd combination... can only see mushroom lovers really being drawn to this Smoked Salmon (4/5) - I'm a sucker for smoked salmon I have a hearty appetite so even after eating a 1/4 of each of the above (which total 1 order), I found myself still quite hungry. Some red flags: - $1 syrup??? I'll bring my own packet next time - waffle fries? I'll stick to criss cut fries from Carls. I did notice they have a lot of neat looking drinks here. All in all, I think its a pretty neat concept and while I had a pretty above average experience here, me personally, I am not entirely sold on eating my food with waffles just yet. This place will probably only get more crowded as the days go by which will only increase my chances of NOT coming back =(

Definitely love @ first sight. 蔕ne of my professor's recommended it so Natalie T. and I decided we were gonna try it out. 蔇owntown Orange is such a cute and friendly area already but Bruxie just makes it even better in my eyes. 蔍 was semi-hesitant about everything being in a waffle but after eating such deliciousness I will probably be here once a week so don't be surprised if I weigh 500lbs the next time you see me. I ordered the Bruxie burger w/o mayo and the thing that I enjoyed the most was I didn't have that disgusting "OMG! I feel like a fat pig" feeling afterward and for dessert I had the lemon and berries waffle. 蔜he lemon and berries waffle was good but I have to admit that the seasonal creme brulee w/ strawberries waffle was hands down WAY better. P.S. The strawberry lemonade is good (kinda too sweet for me) but next time I am trying one of the shakes.

At 11:30 on a Thursday there was only a wait of about five people, which was great considering the hype surrounding the place. After looking through photos, the savory bruxies always looked chincy on the toppings ($8 for one slice of prosciutto and mustard is a rip off!), so I decided to indulge my sweet tooth by ordering the Lemon Cream and Berries and an extra thick Mint Chocolate Shake. The waffle itself was good, very light, crispy and not too sweet. The lemon cream is basically lemon curd folded with whipped cream, so no complaints there. I do wish there had been more berries or that they could create a berry compote that would cover the entire waffle so each bite has waffle, lemon cream and berries, but it was still good. The shake was thick and creamy but what put it over the top was the layer of hot fudge at the bottom. What would make the shake even better would be to incorporate shredded chocolate or chocolate chips OR to create a multi-layered fudgy mint extravaganza! 蔍 just missed the 蔭dded texture in the shake. Prices are a bit expensive seeing as would could get a cheesy bruxie with the works for what you pay for a shake, but I guess that the fact that custard is nowhere else to be found in the nearby area justifies it as an indulgence.

I finally got to try Bruxie located in Orange right next to Chapman University. It was raining on a Saturday afternoon and I was craving for some chicken and waffles. There is no parking. Side parking only for 30 minutes. If you get lucky you'll find a seat because it's a small area or else you'll be standing. I really wanted to try the Short rib, but unfortunately it's only for dinner. The Buttlermilk chicken and waffle is good. It's white chicken breast that was lightly battered with a hint of spice seasoning and it comes with coleslaw. However, they charge a $1 for maple syrup which is ridiculous. I mean who eats waffles without syrup? I also got Prosciutto & Gruyere which is delicious! Thin slices of meat with cheese that melts in your mouth. Lastly, the roasted wild mushrooms and goat cheese was too salty. The mushroom had too much seasoning and my friend said it might be the cheese, but I won't come back for that one. I washed my waffle down with a ice tea. I still prefer Roscoe if I wanted chicken in waffles, but this place does have a wide variety. 蔍'll be back for some short ribs next time!

On this wonderful, sunny Friday morning, after a visit to my chiropractor and being in a state of sickness for awhile, I've taken this place off my blacklist (because of the bf) and decided to see the buzz. It's a cute little walk-up with tables nestled around, also with shade and umbrellas that definitely protected us from the heat. I ordered the buttermilk fried chicken and the bf ordered the seasonal albacore tuna ... along with the nutella & bananas for dessert. I liked the albacore more so than my chicken. but LOVED LOVED LOVED the nutella & banana, cuz I'm in love with nutella. Definitely a must try and I will probably be back again.

I'm not sure I can ever really get my head (or mouth) around the idea of waffle sandwiches. But looking at Bruxie's purely as a purveyor of classic Belgium waffles expertly prepared, they are winners. Just slightly sweetened, crisp on the outside and slightly doughy on the inside. 蔠ash it down with a cup of freshly brewed Peets coffee: heaven. I couldn't imagine how making a sandwich out of it (which makes up the bulk of the menu) could possibly add to the experience.

I've been going back and forth over my rating of this place. 蔣es I enjoyed it, but was it so fabulous that I would wait another 45 min to eat it again? 蔕nce I decided it was a No... I went to 3 stars. On the up side: The custard was good... not so fabulous over other frozen yogurt but it was still good. 蔜he smore's tasted just like a gramcracker crust version with a softer bite to it... but everything else was just like it... and my favorite was the creme brulet. 蔜he sweet cream and strawberries with the crispy waffle makes for the best combination. 蔍 am curious to try the hamburger (not that curious, but I think that's what I would try if I went again) Down side (pretty much the whole reason I wouldn't return): 30 min wait, and the once you order... another 10-15 min wait. 蔄ll these people standing around, hovering over other people so they can take their 2 seat table and shove a whole family inside of it. 蔈mployees walking up and down the line asking if anyone needs help, and the only "suggestions" I heard from them was "yes that one is a great choice"... and then of course at the end they wanted my menu back... kinda tacky if you ask me. I can see the appeal of this place, but the whole feeling of it being inefficient and the wait just turns me off. 蔊et rid of half of the tables and make a larger standing area with some handicap friendly tables. 蔜he food was good, so if someone wanted to go I wouldn't be opposed to it, but I wouldn't offer it up. 蔕h lastly, the food wasn't expensive $6-$7 for most items, but standing in line to order for that price... they need to think more about the pick up sticks/pei wei atmosphere where the restaurant is inside... you order go sit down and they deliver. 蔍'm disappointed that I wasn't as excited about this place as the majority of the reviews seem to be.

I have to agree with Ryan M. about this place. 蔝nless you're a student at Chapman or live around this area, it's NOT worth circling the block 10 times before you find parking! 蔍 went here on a Saturday and didn't know what to expect of this place. 蔠hat I learned about Bruxie: 1. 蔔O PARKING!! 蔍t's NON-existent on a Saturday afternoon during lunch time. 蔜hey have a very small parking area in the back for only half a dozen cars. 蔜hen there is only street parking but even then most of them are by PERMIT ONLY. 蔛o? 蔠here the hell do you park!?!??!? �I was really pissed off at this point when I couldn't find parking after 15 minutes of driving around the block. �2. 蔋ave someone else wait in line while you find parking. 蔒y bf was waiting in line while I was finding a place to park because there were over 25 ppl in line. 蔜ook him 15+ 蕀in to order. �3. 蔍t's a To-Go place where you get your food and leave. 蔜here are park benches where you can eat your food but even that's all taken when it's busy time. 蔠e ended up standing and eating our food. 4. 蔕rdered the Burger and the Chicken Waffle with Strawberry Shake. �- Burger waffle. 蔎ust meat patty, cheese and tomato with one thinly sliced pickle. 蔅land. 蔔o flavor in the ground beef. 蔇Idn't quite taste yummy with the waffle. �-Chicken waffle. 蔍 would have liked the chicken on its own. 蔄gain, the savory with waffle just didn't do it for me. -Strawberry shake. 蔠AAAYYY too sweet! 蔠e both agreed that it's loaded with too much sugar. Conclusion: 蔠affle itself is really good. 蔖erhaps it'll be better to order the waffle with sweet fillings. 蔋owever, I didn't taste anything too special about their savory waffles. �It's just not worth having to find parking for over 15 minutes just to wait AGAIN in line for another 15 minutes and end up eating on a bar table standing up facing traffic. �Great for students in the area. 蔔ot worth the drive or time or energy spent just to go out of your way to eat here.

SERIOUSLY MY NEW FAVORITE PLACE. they hooked, lined, and sunk me with a seasonal goodie: HOT PASTRAMI in a waffle with marinated cabbage, cheez, crisp slices of cucumber and perfection. ($8) i don't even like waffles which boggles my mind on how i would even try this place, but the fried chicken lured me in. and what is even more amazing is that i didn't even try it... YET! the pictures fool you. really. the waffle looks all thick, dry, and crunchy... aka nastiness BUT! at bruxie the WAFFLE IS the perfect size, thickness, crunchiness, and has meatiness inside the waffle that complements the ACTUAL meat inside! you just need to try it. waffle that will captivate your tastebuds, eyes, tongue, and love life (because you won't need it anymore once you meet the waffletasticness) i was too full after it that i couldn't get to the dessert aka STRAWBERRY CREME BRULEE ahhhhh droool but i will get to you.. tomorrow... literally ;) craziest thing is i went here alone because no one was free. (lame) but SO WORTH being a PARTY OF ONE because it was so tasty and i had fun people-watching as well as checking out old town orange. SO CUTE! coming here with all mah frendz. (hope there are enough seats..i think its hard to come here with more than a party of four unless u take it to-go) making bets so i get bruxie on them. (HOLLER!) did i mention free street parking?

Believe the hype. 蔜his place is amazing! �I don't know what else to say that my friend Vivi T hasn't already mentioned, but I will try. First off...Bruxie has a small parking lot, so if you find parking in the street as you are driving up to the restaurant, just go ahead and park. 蔣ou will probably want to walk off all the fat that you just consumed anyhow. 蔒y friend and I had 3 sandwiches, bc we didn't know how to narrow our choices down and well they were calling us to order. 蔛o our order consisted of the buttermilk chicken, the prosciutto, and the salmon. 蔜o drink, we had an iced tea and a strawberry shake. We tired the buttermilk chicken first...it was ehhh. 蔔othing special. 蔠e were a little disappointed, bc we thought we'd hyped the place up so much that it didn't live up to our expectations. 蔜he waffle itself was good, but it wasn't enough to save the dull chicken. 蔔ext time we will try it with the bacon and eggs...mmmmm. Prosciutto...thank god we had this next, bc we would have been some bitter, hungry hippos. 蔜he taste of the mustard and prosciutto played around with our taste buds and woke up any sensation that fell asleep from the chicken before. 蔍'm positive that we would have ordered more if we had sat their long enough. �Salmon...this one seems like a healthy choice for those of you that do not want to indulge in the fat and grease. 蔊ranted our review on the salmon might be skewed due to us hoping that our last sandwich would live up to the previous one, but I think we have a general taste on this one. 蔜he cream cheese was a little heavy. 蔄t times, I found it hard to taste the salmon bc the taste of the cream cheese was overbearing. 蔋owever, I did find the salmon more flavorful than the buttermilk chicken. �Our beverages...I probably should have played it safe and ordered a soda. 蔅eing from the south...like Atlanta...not Southern California, I ordered the iced tea expecting it to be sweet. 蔍 forget a lot of the times that I have to distinguish that important factor when I order iced tea on the west side. 蔜his clearly was my fault. 蔍'm not sure how ice tea is suppose to taste like unsweetened, but I did not enjoy it. 蔍 didn't personally try the shake, but my friend said it was good enough. 蔍'm not sure it was something she would come back for, but it settled her craving. �Bruxie did leave me wanting more when I got home. 蔍 can't wait for my next visit so I can try something new. 蔝ntil next time my fellow yelpers.

I have been driving past Bruxie for the last 2 years going to or coming home from work. Today my girlfriend and I thought we'd see what that long line that stretches down the sidewalk is about. Frankly, I don't see why the line is that long unless everyone is eating something on a secret menu. My girlfriend got the bruxie burger and fries. First off, for how busy Bruxie is I thought their fries would be too hot to eat or at least warm. Yet they were cold. The seasoning they use on the fries is pretty tasty but such a dissapointment. The burger was nothing special. It feels like bruxie relies on itself too much being unique using waffles opposed to buns. 蔍 had the smoked salmon. Which was ok. The cream cheese spread they use was really good. The salmon was ok but sloppy. So all in all I'm willing to give bruxie another try but we won't be ordering the same thing again.

My wife and I were here on a Sunday, around 11AM. It seemed like we arrived just before everyone else, so the line wasn't so bad...maybe 6 customers deep. Seats and counters are kind of limited, so most likely you'll be standing while eating. We managed to find a seat next to the windows. After ordering, food was out in about 5-10 minutes. We had the Bruxie Hash and Eggs and the Smores. Loved both. Waffle was light, crispy and overloaded with filling.

Prosciutto gruyere was perfect, cheese was perfectly melted and the waffle is WOW! Soft, a little warm and just the perfect sandwich. I wish i wasn't on a diet or I would of gotten another one for dessert!! I wish this place wasn't so far or I would definitely come more often. Not only is the food good, but the service is exceptional.

If it weren't for the fact that it's format is like a fast food stand, I would have thought that this was a brilliant idea if it were served inside a sit down cafe. 蔅ut otherwise, it may seem a little pricey to pay a la carte prices like $5 for a shake for example. 蔍 guess Chapman students can afford it because it is not fast food prices strictly speaking... But aside from my cheapness, I thought the food was great. 蔍 love Belgian waffles to begin with and theirs are light and fluffy and ever so slightly crispy, not undercooked nor overcooked, perfect. 蔜hen to put a BS chick boob (boneless skinless chicken breast...) fried fillet inside blows me away and takes me to somewhere like Roscoe's or something. 蔜he combination of the two is just indescribably delicious. 蔅ut if you're really in mood for something savory, have the Proscuitto and Gruyere Waffle w/chives. 蔜hinner and more subtle, the taste is nevertheless satisfying. 蔍 was kidding earlier about the $5 shakes (sort of); 蕋hey're terrific too and they vary the flavors to come up with something different every now and then. 蔜he waffle fries are light and crisp, perfect to go along with the waffle theme... If savory isn't your bag, they also have sweet waffles too (e.g. PB&J waffle...) They have a demi-waitress that brings out the food to your table after you've ordered and paid at the walk up window. 蔏udos to her for telling some guy who was squatting a table just for the free WiFi to give it up for an elderly lady who had ordered her food. 蔜he guy wasn't eating anyway and was dressed in a hoodie like the uni-bomber or something; 蕎hat's wrong with the youth of today anyway? 蔜hey don't even seem to have any basic manners any more (*sigh*)... I'll admit that I didn't think much of the concept at first, but after trying it I found that it was actually pretty satisfying. 蔍 would come back, at least until the novelty wears off...

Bruxie hot on Yelp?! hells yeah! it's legit! We came here one Sunday morning on Old Towne Orange, driving by the downtown blvd. which reminds me of going through a cool east coast historical site, a good flow I might add. Then going into a neighborhood, the birds were tweeting, the sun was up like a Kellogg's Raisin Bran, you feel the presence of something good is waiting to happen, on the corner there it was Bruxie. Its outdoor seating only for a perfect early morning, it doesn't get better than that. Stood in line looking at the menu, there are interesting flavors, you would decide between savory or sweet gourmet waffle sandwiches or bonkers do both. While waiting in line there was just two people ahead, then behind us the line started forming to the masses! Then when it was time to order we got a warm welcome from the Bruxie dude "Welcome to Bruxie" Went with savory, I ordered the buttermilk chicken and waffle, I recommend coffing up an extra buck for the maple syrup, if you want to add sweetness to it. I can't leave out warm beverages in the morning so I got one of their specialty drinks that is the Belgian Mocha. The buttermilk chicken and waffle was at first plain, but then that's why the maple syrup comes in handy, so pour it on and add some life to it! Let me backup a little bit the waffles are freshly crisp, light, and not sweet. The chicken was freshly crisp, light and not salty. There was added cole slaw and honey into it as well. I see why it had a light touch to it and wrapping it all into one: the fried chicken, the belgium waffle with the addition of sweet maple syrup which shifted the balance of power, and hearing the crisp sounds as you bite into it, 蕋herefore it was a delicious sandwich! This place is worth coming back for waffles. I would love to tryout their Nutella, Bananas and waffles on my next visit. Bruxie talk of the town, spread the word!

My review will strictly be on what I ordered: Lemon Cream & Berries - Probably my favorite sweet waffle they have to offer. 蔐emon curd is perfectly sweet with just the right amount of tart. 蔜he fruits help to 'freshen' up the overall sweetness. Lemon Meringue Pie (add seasonal berries) - Very similar to the lemon cream & berries with the addition of marshmallow fluff & graham crackers. 蔜his is a great alternative to someone looking for that extra something instead of a plain lemon cream & berries. Liege Waffle Sundae - SO GOOD especially with the Wisconsin custard. (share this with a friend!) Mint Chocolate Shake - For those who love Andes, Thin Mints, etc, you will not be disappointed with this shake. Mushroom & Arugula Waffle - This was just ok. 蔍 was disappointed with this one I think because I tend to like the portabello mushrooms I cook at home with a balsamic reduction better. 蔜he goat cheese was just over the top for this because they spread on way too much so the ratio of cheese per bite was off. Turkey Club - Probably one of my favorite savory waffles. 蔛imple, straight to the point, & thankfully the bacon they use is thicker than your average diner bacon. Bruxie Burger - Surprisingly good considering the carb replacement is a waffle. 蔍 added avocado, which made a huge difference. 蔜he patty is very simple, but that's what a lot of people look for in a standard burger. Liege Waffle w/ Nutella - Pretty straight forward. 蔠e all know what Nutella tastes like, but the liege waffle is only good if they had JUST made it. Root Beer Float - Excellent if you love their custard. 蔍f you prefer a more traditional "ice cream" float then don't even consider getting this. OVERALL: This is definitely a more intimate, quick, & quaint location in comparison to Brea. 蔜he food is pretty much identical to the other location which is always a good sign of consistency and attention to their product. Like I always say, YOU WON'T KNOW UNLESS YOU TRY IT FOR YOURSELF!!

My tourist friend came to visit and I gave her choices to pick for dinner. 蔛he was staying at Anaheim Convention Center so we didn't want to go too far from her hotel. 蔛he picked Bruxie because it was hot right on yelp and she wanted waffle. 蔏udos to Nick H for recommending this place. I ordered chicken with waffle and she got something else I couldn't remember. 蔒y waffle was delicious but I wasn't too impressed with my fried chicken. The chicken wasn't greasy but it was missing something. � stars for the waffle itself and just 3 stars for the chicken. I went back there again to try its Hot Chocolate, Hamburger and Cheese Bruxie. 蔍 even ate in my car because the place was crowded. Hamburger: The hamburger was amazing. 蔖erfect combo of waffle with meat, very thin and long slice of pickle and tomato. � stars. �Cheese Bruxie: 蔮asically grilled cheese waffle. It was a tad greasy but anything with cheese was good for me. �.5 stars. Hot Chocolate: it was just hot chocolate. 蔔othing spectacular. 蔒y favorite hot chocolate is Leonidas in Pasadena. � stars. So why 4 stars? 蔅ecause I am kinda addicted to the waffle. 蔛o that makes me a fan. �Yay, I am a fan" = 4 stars. 蔇unno what spell they have on me but I want to go back there again =( 蔐ike really bad =( really really bad =( Maybe I will try something sweet next time. 蔠affle with ice cream ;) 4 stars!!

I LOVE BRUXIE! But 4 stars because I like the specials a lot more than their regular items and there's ALWAYS a line! Recommendations: S'mores: I LOVE S'MORES and put it in a waffle and it becomes infinitely more delicious! The chocolate is all melty and the marshmallow part is slightly toasted and delicious with a little hint of the cinnamoniness of a graham cracker. definitely one of my favorites! Lemon Cream & Berries: this thing is amazing, especially coming from me who thinks dessert isn't dessert unless it includes chocolate. This is an exception. The lemon cream is the perfect combination of sweet and tart and mixed with the tartness of the berries makes it soooooo goooddd! Prosciutto & Gruyere: All of my friends love this dish but I think it's just ok. I will say though the mix of the prosciutto and gruyere and the mustard is pretty good and delicious. I just can't handle too much of it because there's no change in texture and no crunch from veggies! Specials: I don't know how often they change these, but 蔍 will say that every single one of the special items that I have tried have all been AMAZING! I've had their carne asada waffle sandwich on Cinco de Mayo and I have to say it's probably one of the BEST THINGS I HAVE EVER EATEN! Also, they've been having pulled pork and I have to say it's really good. They also add their homemade horse radish sauce and it makes everything so much better! I always ask for extra. As for the other sandwiches, I've tried the burger and it's pretty good but doesn't come with sauce which is the only downfall because I love a good sauce. The Fried Chicken and Waffle is also pretty good. The cole slaw is really good and my friends like it with extra maple syrup but if I were you, I'd ask for it on the side if you really want more. Anyways, in conclusion, this place is a MUST TRY!

If I could give this place 10 stars I would. Hahahaha! Okay I think I'm in LOVE!!!!! First of all I LOVE waffles and when I heard about this place I had to go! I got the smoked salmon and dill cream cheese. Exquisite! Super light taste. I love sushi so I kinda like that raw texture of the smoked salmon :) but if you'd rather opt for something "cooked" I'd suggest the buttermilk fried chicken and waffle. Omg. it is so crunchy and lightly battered!!! and just really tasty. And for desert.... I ordered the strawberry creme br瀕巈 waffle. *silence* just smelling it was like a nose orgasm. Hahahaha I think I've found my new favorite dessert. BUT the only downfall is that this is a seasonal flavor. So y'all better get urs while they have it!!!! the place is small and it has outdoor seating to the side. 蔍 came when it was around 8pm and they had the heaters on so it wasnt that chilly.. pretty comfortable actually. 蔄ll the workers were very friendly and helpful with any questions i had.

This place is awesome!!!! It's really GOOOOD CHICKEN AND WAFFLE= MOUTH GASM Ham,Bacon, Egg waffle was awesome The Waffle burger is OK, I expected better but it was still pretty good Banana and Nutella was awesome Peanut butter and jelly was awesome The cost is about $7 if you just get the waffle with no combo or drink. It's $9 for the combo with fries. There are no restrooms, but WHO CARES when this place is this gooooood. Parking is limited but you can park on the side streets. I recommend for people to come here with a group of friends, get like everything on the menu and split it so you get to taste the entire menu :D

I didn't think it was possible to love this place more but I just did! Have you tried their specials: Braised short rib waffle & the banana creme brulee one? OHMYEFFINGOD amazing!!! If you're lucky enough to go there when they still have it, you must try it. The short ribs are braised overnight with tons of spices and red wine. They add horseradish, goat cheese and other flavors in it. It's complex and delicious! The service is amazing and there is no doubt why the lines wind around the corner. If you haven't tried them out before you HAVE TO. If you do, then you're like me and probably a repeat customer. I can go there and try something completely different than the last time. They have seasonal specials all the time and new sandwiches they test out. I love Bruxie!!! =)

Who thought of the whole waffle sandwich idea? 蔜hat person is a genius! Wait: about 20 minutes Food: (See Below) Chicken Waffle with syrup: Fried chicken inside a waffle topped with syrup. 蔍t was amazing! Braised Rib Waffle: It was loaded with a lot of meat and was very tender Strawberry Soda: It was home made but I didn't really care for it. 蔍 would not order again.

This place is awesome! I cant wait to come back here and try other menu items. Brian and I had a the fried chicken which was perfectly seasoned and moist and the waffle and the accompanying sauce was soooooo good, I am thinking about it right now. We also had the prosciutto and Gruyere which was good and had a hint of horseradish! All in all a perfect and reasonably priced lunch. The iced tea is hand pressed and is totally delicious! I miss OC especially Old Towne Orange =(

Ahhh Bruxie, I can't wait to come back and try you again. 蔍 showed up at just about 12:00 pm on a weekday and luckily the line wasn't very long. 蔍t only took about 5 minutes to get to the window. 蔍'm sure it had something to do with Chapman being on summer break. I completely wavered back and forth between going with the fried chicken and the daily special of the pulled pork. 蔄fter some guidance from the Bruxie employees, who were very helpful, I decided to go with the daily special. �The mix of the vinegary taste from the pulled pork, the crispness and creaminess of the slaw, and the sweetness of the waffle were perfect. 蔒y only regret is that I could only eat one and that I couldn't try more of their waffles that day! �On the savory side, I hear their short rib waffle sandwich is a must and on the sweet side the Liege waffle is a necessity. �I will definitely be back...

I went to Bruxie for the first time for lunch today. 蔍 work within walking distance and I had wanted to try the place ever since it opened. 蔍 was so impressed! 蔍t really does live up to its reputation. 蔍 got there shortly after noon and there wasn't much of a line, maybe about 5 people. 蔜he service is ultra friendly. �There are lots of cheerful people working there who are happy to answer questions and offer suggestions. We ordered and sat down at a booth. 蔕ur food came out within 5-10 minutes or so. 蔍 ordered the sundried tomato, arugula and goat cheese waffle with a side of fries. 蔜he waffle was DIVINE. 蔄 hearty amount of filling and a delicious crunchy waffle made for a perfect lunch. 蔜he fries were also great. An employee stopped by our table regularly and asked how everything was. 蔠e told him it was great and that we were about to hop back in line to order dessert. 蔋e told us he'd be happy to take our dessert order (nutella, custard and bananas) and put the order in for us. 蔜his was great news because the line had grown significantly since we arrived and it saved us having to wait in it again. 蔋e also brought us out some generously-sized samples of custard to try while we waited for our dessert to arrive. 蔣UM! �Our nutella and banana waffle was incredible. 蔍t's going to be tough to not be tempted to walk to Bruxie every day and order this! �My advice is: don't be intimidated if you see a line. 蔍t moves quickly and it's absolutely worth the wait!

My friend Clarissa suggested we try this place out. She had tried to come here once before but it was too crowded. With that said... get here before 11:30am! Lunch crowd starts then....and the line gets exceptionally long! The staff are very helpful & friendly. 蔣ou can tell they like working there. Which says a lot about the owners! I tried the prosciutto & gruyere waffle sandwhich thingie...& my friend Clarissa tried the smoked salmon & dill waffle. I only finished half before I got full.. it was tasty & light. Clarissa really liked hers... she finished it all. Lol This location has outdoor seating only. oh! And THREE parking spots! So find public parking near by. Also...make sure you ask the staff to turn on the fans....so you aren't accidentally sharing your food with "flying customers" I'm giving it 3 stars simply cuz I haven't tried enough from their menu yet!

Let me just surrender my heart, my soul and my unclogged arteries. 蔛ike! Bruxie is located in Old Towne Orange and if the town isn't quaint enough, Bruxie can top it off for you, along with Chapman University, as your scenery. 蔍 had a late lunch at a not so busy time, so there were plenty of seats and lots of servers at our disposal! �I had the Bruxie Burger and my friend and I split the Nutella and banana waffle sandwich. 蔕k, anything "Nutella" is a game changer, and Bruxie did it well! 蔜he bananas were ripe, so the sandwich wasn't too sweet, and the cream made it even more delicious! 蔜here's somethin' about their waffles that makes me want to meet Bruxie's owner (alive or dead!) just so that I can give him/her a handshake. 蔜hey're cooked perfectly and then some! 蔍 figured that the Bruxie Burger would be just like any other hamburger and I don't know why but this was probably one of the most delicious burgers I've had! 蔍'm not a burger person. 蔍t had to be the waffle. 蔎ust. The waffle. 蔍'm gonna stop there. The staff members were attentive and the man at the cash register was super friendly. -- The prices are very fair (sometimes I'm a cheapo and anything above $8 is a no-no). 蔛adly, there is no restroom "due to the historic nature" of Bruxie's building. 蔅ring your hand sanitizer before you eat! �Also, there are ample two-hour parking spots and there are three-hour parking lots if you go down Glassell St., along Maple Ave. After your meal, you can make a day out of it and walk around Chapman! 蔍t's nice and relaxing. I'm definitely coming back!

I'm so sad.. I bookmarked this place because of all the great reviews. I came here on a Saturday morning and was surprised at how it wasn't an actual restaurant but more of an outdoors dining with a limited space of seats because of the long line of people waiting to order. I thought the concept was cute and nifty, but we almost had to resort to eating in our car because there was no space. Excited by the ample amount of people waiting in line, I decided to order the chicken & waffle. I had the preconcieved notion that it would taste like Roscoes Chicken & Waffle (YUM), but was dissapointed when I learned that the waffle would be drizzled in a sweet syrup instead of gravy. So I take my first bite and I'm ecstatic. I take two or three more bites.. I'm slowing down. I'm starting to get bothered by the sweet syrup on my chicken. Sweet food does not do it for me. I'm starting to feel queasy from the greasiness.. I take a bite out of my boyfriend's Bruxie burger which is absolutely delicious - and this is coming from a girl who hates burgers.. Yup! Even Inn N' Out. Anyway, I don't know.. 蔍 really want to come back here because of all the great reviews. The feeling the food gave me was.. just no buena para ti.

Went here with a friend for a lunch date! Sad that there aren't too many seats! I guess it shoes how poppin' it can be. I ordered the bruxie burger and waffle fries and my friend ordered the smoked salmon. The burger was of course a typical burger, but I guess after this, I like burgers with waffles more, haha. Very filling. 蔜he Smoked Salmon was really good too, but it didn't seem too filling. The waffle friends were good too, but I wish it was in more quantity.

5 stars just for the Liege waffle alone...slightly sweet, crunchy with little bits of pearl sugar adding to the wonderful texture a Liege waffle should have! �I also ordered the special waffle sandwich with braised short rib, caramelized onions, balsamic reduction, and blue cheese sprinkles. 蔊reat combination of savory/tart/sweet flavors...the short rib was melt in your mouth ridiculous...the star of the show. 蔜he buttermilk fried chicken/waffle sandwich was also great, and the smoked salmon w/dill and cream cheese was similar to lox/bagel, but with a waffle crunch. The great service and friendly staff here made my visit even better. 蔕ne of the owners was greeting guests in line and explaining the specials, another guy was taking drink orders, and a different guy visited our table to ensure everything was ok. 蔄fter eating, I HAD to order another Liege waffle, and the drink guy recognized me and took my order so I didn't have to wait in their crazy line...that's right, VIP status at Bruxie!

A waffle sandwich? Such a great idea. A place that looks like a little stand that sells them - even better! A historical building that probably has lots of stories attached to it? Count me in. When Jen L. decided on this place, I said - why not? I'm down for trying new foods... The wait was not too long for us. It was at 6pm on a Tuesday. At around 7 it got a bit busy, but you didn't have to wait too long to order or for the food. Food: Chicken waffle with syrup - delicious. I chose this based on the yelp suggestions. It seemed like a good choice since most people love chicken and waffles (which I've actually never had before). The chili honey was delicious on the chicken and the syrup? YUM! �Lemon Cream and Berries - this was okay. It wasn't that amazing. The berries were just strawberries - I was expecting like strawberries, blueberries, blackberries, raspberries...ALL the different type of berries. The lemon cream was pretty good too, but it just wasn't as photographable. Everything else: They have pseudo waiters who bring you your food after you sit at the 9 tables they have. They have 7 tables in their little area and then 2 picnic benches. They also have heaters near most of the tables to keep warm since it is outside. They were really nice - the guy and girl - who kept on asking if we needed anything else. I heard that the manager told them to push the lemon meringue waffle and the waitress did. We did stay there for quite a bit of time, but the cashier recognized me when I ordered my dessert - that was pretty cool. Overall, the place had a creative idea and it worked. Waffle sandwiches? LOVE IT. I will totally go back and try more of the dessert waffles - the nutella ones sound amazing!

Waffle sandwiches! Where the hell has this been all my life??? I mean, I love chicken and waffles but making a sandwich out of waffles, that's obviously the next step of the evolution, right? It's very important to touch upon the amazingness of the waffles. They are light, fluffy and crispy with just the tiniest hint of vanilla sweetness. They're not too thick which makes them a great "slice of bread" for sandwich. The flavor is more complimentary than standalone and that's what I love about them. On to the actual sandwiches. I enjoyed the fried chicken sandwich. I appreciate that the flavors are not too overpowering and it's more of a tango of textures (crispy, soft, juicy) that appeals to me when I'm eating this bad boy. The chicken is not too salty and is very juicy. A solid sandwich. The short rib sandwich is really where its at. They have a limited amount because its slow-cooked the day before. Ridiculously tender and has a nice snap with the horseradish sauce and a nice pungent goat cheese to complete the flavor. A wonderful treat! Beyond the waffles, the custard here is bomb. I prefer custard to ice cream and gelato because its the creamiest of the group. Put in a milkshake or have it on its own and trust me, you'll be happy you did. Oh yeah, the fries are tasty too. Cheers!

Before coming here I skimmed some of the reviews and almost all of them are 4 stars+. I went here with my bestie and my bf for lunch. The line was a little bit long and parking was a bitch. I got the Lemon Cream & Berries, my bestie got the Smoked Salmon and my bf got the Chicken. The first several bites was heavenly and I start to get tired of it. I feel that the Smoked Salmon doesn't have enough cucumbers. I do like the chicken one :). The Lemon Cream is quite sweet so wash it down with water is best. I would love to come back but it's kind of a drive.

A Burger and a Waffle... Dang Good! Long story made short. This is at the old teriyaki place on the corner across from Chapman. They renovated it pretty nicely. Like good luck comes from a charm on a chain, I got lucky here.. real lucky with the delicious Waffle Burger and a side of sweet loving! Friendly service is the cherry on top of this sundae of an eatery! Waffles-5 Stars Stuff inside the Waffle (chicken or dried tomatos)-3 star. Belgian Hot Chocolate- 2.5 Stars Waffle Burger with Pickles and tomato--medium angus burger 4.5 Stars!!!! Cheesey Waffle..mmmm 4 Stars Date Shake 3.5 Stars When I saw the Belgian Hot Chocolate sign, I couldn't resist. It was a let down. Just average. The waffles are spectacular. My own preference is just get the waffles with some fruit or something. It is way cheaper and way yummier. No reason to ruin thier spectacular waffles with average other stuff. Try the Burger..mmmm Yay for Bruxie! Bruxie and Old Town Orange..another reason the OC is the best place to live!

Been back to Bruxie a couple of times since when I first went. Tried the Cheesy Bruxie with bacon and ham and the Roasted Mushroom. Both great! If there's one thing I have to note here, it's that service has gotten much faster and more efficient - they give you the drink first if you've ordered any, and food's out really just a few minutes after that.

AMAZING! another hidden gem i found here in at old town orange... love their waffles here! i got their roasted mushroom with goat cheese; amazing!! usually i don't like goat cheese, but you can barely taste it here. right when you take a bite, the ooeygooey cheese just melts in your mouth! perfect affair with the tender mushroom and the crunch of the arugula salad! for dessert i got to try their dulce de leche shake. i was a bit disappointed... it was very good, but wayyyy tooo sweet for my taste =( i only got to drink like 1/3 of it and had to toss the rest. =/ bummer. and for their liege waffle with belgium chocolate was good, but bit on the dry side.. you might wanna have a side of syrup or something or a large glass of milk. other than that, i'd definitely will be back here again to try everything on their menu!!

This place is great! I never had a waffle as good as Bruxie's! The Waffles are crispy on the outside and moist inside. I always get the wild mushroom and arugula cuz it's light but full of flavor! We also tried the burger, chicken and waffle, short rib, sun dried tomato, cremebule, and the strawberry cream. The short rib and burger is the meaty dishes that is just filling and delicious. I recommend it for men who are looking for more of the filling meal. If you want something lighter, wild mushroom~~~~~ and sun dried tomato is the way to go. Sun dried tomato is little bit too sweet for me though. I wish it was little bit more tomato-like. For the chicken and waffle... I just can't think of fried chicken being sweet.. It just doesn't make sense to me. Esp, cuz I dont like sweet dishes. The dessert dishes are great, but I prefer the savory dishes better. The wait is long and the seating is limited so it's for people who love finding small places to chow, but not for people who are looking for relaxed meal.

When I first heard of Bruxie, I initially thought it was just another gimmick to create some hype and buzz. 蔅ut after trying their Bruxie Burger with avocado and beacon, I have to admit that they have a pretty solid burger, even without the waffle. The patty was not only juicy, it was quite flavorful. This was an important element of the burger for me since a lot of other burger joints tend to focus on toping and sauces while delivering a bland meat patty. For those who are looking for a burger alternative, Bruxie also offers a Smoked Salmon & Dill Cream Sandwich. The crispy waffle really did put a different twist to the salmon lox. Also their milkshakes was really rich, the Chocolate Shake beats their Mint Chocolate Shake hands down. All in all, Bruxie's Gourmet Waffle Sandwiches has a lot more to offer than just the hype. http://lwehttam.wordpres�###Erin H.

Do not be afraid... or maybe on days when I feel like indulging in a waffle sandwich, be very afraid so I don't have to wait in line nearly as long. Oh Bruxie, despite the long line I had to wait in, I was thoroughly satisfied with my selection. After a morning at Chapman University, I finally found Bruxie and didn't hesitate to find parking and stand in line. I ordered the Buttermilk Fried Chicken & Waffle - no syrup necessary (http://www.yelp.com/user�. The waffle itself was cooked perfectly, obviously Bruxie knows what their customers need, a waffle that is easy to eat, but also one that doesn't fall apart because of what is inside. The chili honey sauce on the chicken was incredible, the perfect balance of sweet and spice were achieved; the coleslaw was a nice added bonus, but because it was so scarce, I felt like the sandwich would have been fine without it. Also, who doesn't love a root beer float? I didn't realize how gargantuan they were (http://www.yelp.com/user�, but it was DEFINITELY worth the $4, although, I would have preferred a little bit more ice cream to make it to the end of the float. I'll definitely be back to try some more savory items, but I think I'd rather enjoy their sweet options as crepes instead. A side note, whoever was in charge of the music selection for the Saturday I was out there, is incredible. No one, and I mean NO ONE, I know has ever heard of a particular band from NZ and I heard them playing there - I couldn't have been any happier enjoying my root beer float.

Expect a line and parking ain't so bad (especially compared to SF and LA) - walking is good for you anyway and people need to embrace it more. Only down-side is seating.

I was pretty close to giving this place 3 stars, but their customer service bumped it up one star. �First and foremost, if you plan to order the Chicken and Waffles selection and expecting a Roscoe's goodness in your mouth, think again and try something else. 蔜heir chicken is a lot leaner, and their special sauce they put in adds a strange taste that makes you think if you really like this or not. 蔍 also got to try the Egg, Cheese, and Bacon waffle and it was definitely a delight in my mouth. 蔅ruxie takes really great care of the fillings in each waffle, and the balance of the egg and bacon was Perfect. Also, a lot of the customers ordered their wide selection of cold drinks--tea, shakes, soda. �Like I mentioned earlier, the customer service here is amazing. 蔜here is probably a line going on most of the time here, and there's always at least one or two workers who will come out and ask how you are, willing to help you with an ordering selection, or FREE SAMPLES! ��Last but not least, be really careful with the parking. 蔣ou are not allowed to park on Palm Ave, which is only for residents. 蔈veryone usually parks in a block nearby, but somewhere residential for sure. �Come in here with an open mind though!

I came to this place because it was somehow on the main page of my yelp. With 4 stars and over 1000 reviews, this place lives up to its standards. When I arrived, the restaurant caught me off guard. Well, I wouldn't really call it a restaurant. The little building itself is the kitchen. and around it are tables and chairs. It's a nice setup. So you line up on the street to order, then when the food is ready, they shout your name and try to find you and deliver it to you. But they always walked to opposite way from me and my friends! As for the food, I ordered the smoked salmon one. It was pretty good! The waffle was amazing. As for the smoked salmon though, it wasn't all that special. Tasted just like the Kirkland one from Costco, which isn't a bad thing. The prices are reasonable too, which is very important for a cheapo like me. ;)

Everything is just so good- The only downside is that street parking is very limited and there is always a long line. (Prolly because it's located right across the street from Chapman University). But the staff is super friendly, helpful, and fast paced---i've never waited more than 10 mins for my food.

Is it too late for me to register at Chapman University?? These students are SO lucky! Its literally walking distance from campus! I love the concept and the food here!! I came back twice in on day! Who does that?? Their menu consists of savory or sweet side and I indulged in both. Can't I have one without the other. Did I mention that ALL the workers are extremely pleasant?? Well they are. So nice and so accommodating! Great service done right and its not a full-service restaurant. I had the chicken and waffle with extra honey for $1 and loved all the components in the sandwich (do you call it a sandwich?). The slaw could've used more umph power but the chicken stole the show. Yummy moist deep fried chicken drenched in the honey and a piece of the crispy waffle is goodness all in one bite! I was alternating from the chicken and waffle and the lemon and berry waffle. I'm telling you, sweet and savory together is like sriacha on anything that calls for hot sauce. 蔄nd they have sriacha here. Score! I thought the sweet treat was good. Not overbearingly sweet and the lemon cream wasn't heavy. The description said intense lemon flavor but I didn't get that. It was mild and light. The berries were fresh. Later on in the day I wanted a post-lunch snack and Bruxie fufilled my needs and then some. Again, I had to go with the sweet and savory theme and ordered waffle fries and a frozen custard. Now, have you tried McD's soft-serve and fries? Well, its the same concept but 100xs better! This is actual real food! The frozen custard was great. In between a froyo and soft-serve. The waffle fries were perfectly fried. I, of course seized the opportunity to use the sriacha and dipped the fries in it. Any time a restaurant carries sriacha I automatically like the place. On a different occasion I had the liege waffle sundae without the belgian chocolate and got nutella instead. Holy crap! The sundae was HUGE! The waffle was drenched in nutella then atop was vanilla ice cream and a huge mound of whipped cream topped with roasted peanuts and caramel sauce and shavings of chocolate (sorry no cherry on top. who eats that crap anyway?). Now this is what I call a sundae. It was absolutely divine. This is not cavity friendly by any means. In fact I think I got a cavity just by looking at it. It is very sweet so beware if you aren't into sweet sweet things.

Some places impress me, and then there's other places that REALLY IMPRESS me. Everything I tried here was so delicious from the waffle sandwiches, to the iced caramel latte, to the desserts. I was deliciously surprised at how flavorful the Roasted Mushroom & Goat Cheese Waffle Sandwich was, which was notably my favorite of all 3 I tried. Can't go wrong with Bacon, Egg & Cheddar for breakfast, and the Buttermilk Fried Chicken & Waffle is a classic. If I had more space in me I would've tried everything on the darn menu! I definitely recommend everybody to go out of their way to try this place. Yeah, it was THAT GOOD. Only drawback is waiting in line outside in the hot sun. Fortunately they have water misters cooling you down, plus they serve you your food while you wait in the shade. In the end I can definitely say, THIS HITS THE SPOT!

Glad that we went when it wasn't too crowded... heard that this corner spot in OT Orange can be crazy busy- lines wrapping around the corner status. 蔅ut we found parking quickly and had a 5 minute wait, so it was ALL good. I ordered the buttermilk chicken waffle sandwich cuz I something deep in my soul was compelling me to. 蔜he wifey ordered the prosciutto and gruyere waffle sandwich. 蔜he servers were hellla friendly and ready to give some suggestions... and they suggested that we also order a sweet sandwich. 蔇on't have to twist my arm to order dessert, so we ordered the strawberry creme brulee. The food came out pretty quickly (maybe too quickly, as I kinda burned my lip on hot chicken oil), but it was really tasty. 蔜he waffles are cooked perfectly- crispy on the outside and moist inside. 蔜he chicken had some syrup on it which I was not mad at. 蔍 think there was some kinda coleslaw on it, but to be honest, I don't remember, so either there was very little of it or it was not all that memorable. I was very surprised at how good the wifey's choice was... prosciutto and gruyere turned out to be a winner! 蔛omething about that combination on a tasty hot waffle worked.. 蔵t worked really well. 蔠e also shared a little order of fries. 蔜hey were of the waffle persuasion and well seasoned. The strawberry creme brulee was a highlight as well... SO GOOD and it even had bruleed sugar! 蔔ice nice touch. �The food just feels like it is made with love and intention. 蔄 very good food experience!

Amazing. �I've been hearing about this place from a LOT of people recently and had no idea it was so close. 蔍 recently had Roscoe's chicken and waffles and was slightly let down...it was good, but I didn't expect bone-in chicken with waffles. 蔜he chicken was juicy and good, but I bit into a bit of tendon and that just threw my entire appetite off. 蔋ate that. 蔅ut anyway, onto Bruxie: I tried the Bruxie burger and had a cane-sugar rootbeer with it - maybe it's the fact that it was the first meal I had for the day (besides a handful of peanuts at 2pm) but it was INCREDIBLE. 蔒y friends had the chicken sandwich, s'moore, and salmon sandwich, all looked great and I'm dying to go back and try those too. All outdoor seating, really friendly and helpful staff, and walking distance from the Orange Circle. 蔋eading back soon - check out the pictures for more info.

Found out that they have a little secret dessert menu!! Lemon meringue: Made with their lemon cream and their version of fluff. I really enjoy the lemon cream and berries bruxie, but I felt like the lemon meringue one was way too sweet. I got sick of the flavor after a few bites. Creme Brulee: My favorite sweet bruxie!!! It's toasted on the inside and is filled with a decadent cream. Its subtle sweetness was still able to satisfy my greedy sweet tooth. Scotch mallow: One of the owners explained that it wasn't an official sweet bruxie, just something that he kind of came up with. He said it was made with chocolate, caramel, and marshmallow fluff. I haven't tried it yet, but it sounds yummy.

I ordered a waffle with bananas, strawberries, and sweet cream. I'm not sure if the waffles are meant to be served hot or not, but mine tasted like they were sitting out for a couple hours, they were stingy on the strawberries, and I guess I was more or less looking for whipped cream- the sweet cram tasted like butter that had a bunch of sugar in it- which was slathered on a thin waffle. I still have this funky after taste in my mouth. Not what I was looking for at all. The staff was friendly and helpful though!

I get the hype. 蔅ruxie is a cute little food stand, serving up a novel (sort of) concept. 蔍t's got superstar service, and it really goes hand-in-hand with its locale (old towne - yes, with an "e" - Orange). �I've got to say that the Vanilla Cream soda is pretty friggin delicious. 蔍t's got that old-fashioned soda pop taste to it... flavored, but not overwhelmingly sweet. 蔍 would highly recommend ordering the soda with your waffles. Now, the waffle-wich is good. 蔍t's not "friggin delicious," but close to being "really good." 蔜he waffle itself is pretty delicious. 蔍t's got that perfect balance of crunchy-poof. 蔇efinitely my kind of waffle. 蔜he sandwich part of it, though, really depends on what you get. 蔖er yelpers' comments, I ordered myself a prosciutto and gruyere. 蔜hat one was good. 蔅ut, I also got to try the braised short ribs, and that fell flat. 蔍t was over-sauced, which made the delicious waffle go soggy in seconds. 蔅lech. 蔜he short ribs were super dry, and the sauce that is served alongside it was... inneresting. �I only tried two, and I guess I'd be down to go back and try some more. 蔝ntil there are a few other waffle-wiches that I enjoy, I'll have to stick with giving this place three stars.

I love this place! Even though i went around lunch time they were able to go through the line quickly and get us our food even quicker, awesome right? We found parking almost right away on the street, (got lucky i guess) but i can definitely can see parking being difficult there. Anyways we got in line right away, and saw people holding menu's, those are on the right of the ordering window in a little box. Once we figured out where to get those menus we were able to search up and down what we wanted. I thought i was going to get the fried chicken one, but the folding chalkboard menu caught my eye with the seasonal sandwiches. I ordered a "savory" braised pork shortrib bruxie, while my girlfriend ordered the spinach mozarella one...i forget what hers was called exactly. (also ordered a strawberry shake, off the seasonal menu). It took about 5minutes for our food to come out which was considerably fast considering how long the line was infront of us. Make sure you pay attention to them calling your name or use something unique, for me thats just my name in general. Besides that, my meat was pulled which made sense being in a sandwich, it was very delicious, still very moist considering it was pulled. they gave me a side of...gravy or something...instead of dipping it i definitely just smothered it all over my sandwich. It was packed pretty full to begin with so this just added another soggy aspect to it. But i don't regret it...it was really messy but it got where it was supposed to go...my stomach. It was so delicious. I grabbed a fork and knife...but didn't really use those at all. It got messy but...hey eating is an adventure...The other sandwich we got was just exactly as you would think, nothing out of the ordinary for that combo, it was just to the letter, it didn't miss a beat at all. The shake...mmmm...well what more can i say really.. it was fresh "california strawberries", and i love shakes/smoothies/blended drinks, so this was real good. Fresh with that homemade taste and appeal to it. 蔎ust thinking about it and getting small chunks of strawberry in each sip makes me want more... To say the least i WILL be back....

Had to come by here one morning after getting my pedicure done in Orange. A lot of my friends have checked in here so I wanted to find out what the hype was about. I came on a Sunday morning around 11 o'clock. It's right across the street from Chapman University. FYI, don't park down the side streets because you have to have a permit to park and you don't want to be getting a ticket 蕋rying Bruxie's out. The line was pretty long but it went very fast. They come by to give you menus so you can check out what you want before getting to the front of the line. The weather that day was pretty hot and they had misters spraying (like the ones at Magic Mountain), I thought that was pretty awesome. BTW...they don't have public bathrooms so don't drink too much all at once. :) I ordered the fried chicken and waffle sandwich with criss cut fries, 蔭 chocolate shake and a black cherry soda. My friend ordered a regular soda with the green eggs and ham waffle sandwich. Everything that was ordered was pretty good. I would definitely go back and try other things on the menu. :)

So good! Came here with Christine, and her friend, and omg, it was just AMAZING! I got the burger, and it was so good, I ate it up in like five minutes. It kind helped that it was cold by then. We got to go, so by the time, I got home, the burger wasn't that warm anymore. I would definitely come back here, and I want to try some of their other dishes!

Waffle+Delicious Savory Toppings+Human = LOOOooVEE Bruxie's has some amazing waffle burgers! I love the wild mushroom and the (New-Classic) Bruxie Burger. The soda is definitely something to write home about, Fresh Root Beer!! You guys are awesome!!. On a cold day they have great hot teas and on a warm day the strawberry shake is where it's at! Some people complain about the syrup quality...come'on! They don't even need syrup unless you're itching for some extra calories on your already intense diet ruining meal. This is a place to explore your inner-fat-guy...eat a meal you can't get at every drive-thru and enjoy an old school simple menu. You've gotta try it once even if its just for the novelty. Outdoor seating is limited so be prepared to stalk a table. Staff is nice and helpful (they'll bring you anything you need!). Wait isn't usually more than 10 minutes on a busy lunch day. Parking can be a bit of a bother, but welcome to the Circle. 蔍t's more expensive than your average drive-thru so keep that in mind if you're on a tight budget (here's looking at you college kids). 蔈njoy! �**A restaurant to say...Eff my diet, I wanna LIVE!** *Street parking when school is in and around lunch time is horrible. Be prepared to walk a bit, you'll need it after this meal*

Further explorations with waffle sandwiches...think "crepe stand", but with...waffles. So I have since been back three more times since my last review, and I am still a fan, but I am definitely losing my waffle mojo from too much of a good thing. 蔄nyway, I tried their strawberry creme brulee waffle (seasonal!!!) which was like HEAVEN...hands down the best waffle I've had here. 蔊et yours soooon! I've also had the Bruxie Burger, which is a giant burger in a waffle...it was delicious, greasy, guilty pleasure style, and I think I was digesting it for the next 5 days. 蔔ever again...but still worth it. Lastly I sampled the prosciutto/gruyere...this was decent but probably my least fave out of everything. 蔍 could do without the mustard, even though I'm a huge mustard fan. Summary: Fried chicken waffle and the strawberry creme brulee are the bee's knees!

I really didn't have high expectations going here despite the high ratings. Mostly because I'm vegetarian and the whole chicken and waffles thing doesn't really appeal to me. I was very surprised at how vegetarian friendly it was. I got the Green Eggs & Ham (minus the ham) and added avocado instead. It was delicious! It had the right amount of cheese and pesto sauce. I also tried their all natural cane sugar cola and it actually tasted pretty good. It did taste different than regular cola because it wasn't as sweet, which I liked. The service was wonderful. People would periodically come by and ask if we needed anything. The only have outdoor seating but there was plenty of seating available and the area was clean. I would definitely recommend it and would like to go back.

I honestly don't understand all the hype about Bruxie. I mean it's a hell of a lot better than the Dairy Treet that was there before, but I do not think it's that amazing. However, I do agree that it is innovative and something unique to experience in Orange. It definitely adds to the charm of Old Town Orange. I had the Gruyere and prosciutto with chives. Maybe I should try something else, because I wasn't all too crazy about the taste. Their cream soda drink was REALLY tasty though. I would definitely recommend people to go here and try out what they have solely based on the fact that I have not seen or eaten at a place quite like it. This rating is only based on one trip/taste, but I plan on going back and trying something else. At this point in time though, I do not understand everybody's obsession with it.

Stopped by this place on a trip to Disneyland. Really glad to find this place. Went on a Sunday afternoon after church so the wait in line was about 15 minutes and about 10 minutes for the food to come out. Had the classic 'buttermilk chicken and waffles' and the 'roasted mushroom and goat cheese waffle with sundried tomatoes' and combo'd it with the waffle fries. Definitely hit the spot after a night of drinking in LA. Next time I want to try the creme brulee waffle and the shakes that they have there.

I have so much love for Bruxie. I don't like sweets. I don't love "griddle" food (AKA pancakes/ waffles, etc.). But somehow? I simply adore Bruxie! The waffles have such a great texture and flavor, not sweet, but not bland. Nice crunch, but not hard at all. Bacon, Egg & Cheddar: delish! Simple, and yet, oh so good! Cheesy Bruxie + ham: Cheddar and Gruyere cheese wasn't enough for my piggy self, I just had to add in some ham and I'm so glad I did. Super tasty as well, though I love eggs so the bacon, egg 蔭nd cheddar is probably still my favorite. Green Eggs & Ham: a special on the board one day. I was hoping that the eggs and ham would have been gaudily dyed green, but alas, Bruxie is much too smart for that. They added delicious pesto for the "green" effect. A great sandwich, but it lead to some drawn out, pesto-y burps after the fact, that I wasn't a big fan of. Not Bruxie's fault though. A great gem? FROZEN CUSTARD!!!! Yes, it deserves all uppercase letters. Why have I never heard about the soft serve frozen custard until late in my Bruxie game? It is absolutely devine! Creamy, rich, oh so chilly after you've been standing in line, roasting in the sun for a bit. I have yet to try something that didn't leave me wanting more. I am anxiously awaiting the opening of the Brea location and desperately hoping that the quality of food/ service remains the same at both locations. *crosses fingers*

Bruxie. It truly is one of a kind. Many people compare Bruxie to Roscoe's, but in my opinion, it far exceeds Roscoe's because of its delightfully delicious chicken. :) The most popular item on the menu is the "Buttermilk Fried Chicken + Waffle" which is the one i always order. The chicken is cooked to perfection and then wrapped around in a huge crunchy, Belgian waffle. Some coldslaw is sprinkled inside this chicken + waffle sandwich. Be sure to ask for some maple syrup to drench it in !

Came to Bruxie for the first time on a wednesday around noon. The line was a bit long but it was nothing that really bothered me. I have no problem with waiting in line for great food. I once drove to Hollywood and waited two hours in line for a hot dog! Anyways, the wait wasn't long at all considering that it was during the lunch rush and that Bruxie is located right next to Chapman. One of the kind ladies working here gave me a menu while I was waiting in line, and I decided on the buttermilk fried chicken and waffle with a smores waffle for dessert. It was so good I actually came back again the next day with some different friends! My second time around I got the bacon, egg, and cheddar. The fried chicken and waffle was pretty good, but not the greatest. I loved how light and crispy the waffle was; It was perfect for a sandwich. My piece of chicken was a little on the dry side but the flavors were good. The only thing that confused me a little was the side of coleslaw. It wasn't really enough to add to my sandwich and not really enough to be a side dish either. It wasn't too memorable, but it definitely didn't take away from the meal. The smores waffle was delicious! I'm not too big on sweets though so I'm glad I came with my friend because I gave her half of it. It gets really messy though so grab some extra napkins before eating it. So far the bacon, egg, and cheddar waffle is my favorite. I got it on a recommendation of a friend and I was not disappointed. It sounds really breakfast-y but it actually made for a pretty satisfying meal. It may just be because I love breakfast foods though. The fried chicken and waffle seems to be one of the more popular choices, but this is the one that I'll be recommending to those new to Bruxie. And now for everything else. Seating is pretty scarce here. Luckily my friend was able to get a spot but I saw people standing around and waiting for seats the whole time I was there. The servers are nice and friendly. One of them brought me napkins without me asking. I'm guessing it was because I looked like a fool getting that smores waffle all over my hands. Lastly, parking can be a pain! Took me forever to find parking the first time so I ended up parking in one of the lots at Chapman. The second time around I found parking right across the street on my first go. Overall, I would say Bruxie was a great experience. I'm looking forward to trying more things on their menu!

Bruxie doesn't serve your typical Eggo. 蔜hey make gourmet waffle sandwiches and they make them damn good. �The bf and I came here on an early overcast Sunday morning. 蔜he cloudy day made our wait time minimal and easy to find a seat. 蔍t is outdoor seating only and I was happy to score a table next to a heat lamp. We both got the fried chicken waffle sandwich and split an order of fries. I liked the fried chicken. 蔍t has coleslaw on it. 蔜he slaw is more crunchy than liquidity which prevented the waffle from getting soggy. 蔍 am a sauce fan (meaning I don't like dry sandwiches/burgers), so I wish there was more honey on the sandwich. �We realized that the next time we go to Bruxie, we should each get a different sandwich and split them in half so we can try more of the menu.

Love the unique concept. 蔜he thin and crisp waffles taste delicious on their own. 蔍n general, the sandwiches are not overflowing with food and sauce, so all you're left with is the simple taste of several ingredients nestled inside a warm tasty waffle, taco-style. �蔍 usually don't get full off of just one sandwich so I end up either splitting a third savory waffle and/or ordering a sweet one (be sure to order all at once so you don't end up having to wait in another long line). 蔄nd yes, this all ends up costing more than expected if you wanted to finish leaving satisfied. �After several visits, my picks: Savory - Prosciutto and Gruyere Sweet � 蔆reme Br瀕巈 (now available anytime! �fist pump*) Not to be missed are the sodas and shakes. 蔛odas are old school with the flavored syrup mixed-in (Vanilla Cream and Black Cherry are yummy); the shakes are sweet and creamy. 蔄nd be adventurous with any of their specials because they're usually good (e.g. Green Eggs & Ham, Strawberry Cheesecake, Strawberry Lemonade, though the Date Shake wasn't my cup of tea). If you like dining al fresco in Old Town Orange (and can manage finding a table among the crowd), this is your one-stop joint for good food and dessert. My one con: Waffle fries are just OK.

Haven't dish out 5 star rating for awhile and finally found a worthy location. 蔠hile trying to meet up with friends in Chino hills, we decided to stop at Orange for breakfast first. 蔠e reached the location a bit pass 10 and the line wasn't too long. 蔿uckily we are able to get a seat right away. �I ordered the chick and waffle and my wife had her eye on the salmon. 蔉or the little one, they shared the strawberry cheesecake. 蔜he waffle at this place is nicely prepared. 蔜he waffle is very crispy but not overly burnt. 蔈ven for people like my wife who frown on the concept of maple syrup with fried chick, actually like my chicken and waffle combo. 蕋he chicken is made of breast and it is actually not too dry. 蔔ot sure if the syrup had helped. 蔄s for the smoked salmon, the cream cheese + cucumber had made the dish very refreshing. �The potion of the meal is a bit light, but for breakfast this is not too bad at all. 蕄rice is bit fair as well, I think each waffle is about 6-8 which are reasonable price.

finally went to the famed bruxie (at least through my friends) and it was everything it's been made out to be. 蕋he line is long but the wait isn't that long, but definitely have someone nab/hold you a seat while waiting! while you wait in line someone comes and takes your order, which made things go by a lot faster, you just pay at the window after your order is confirmed! so there's the regular menu and then there's specials. 蔭mong my friend's favorites: pastrami, fried chicken, and salmon. 蔭s a veggie, i got the mushroom one -- which was OK, too much balsamic (dripped through the waffle), would like to try the other savory one next time. �note: you can customize your order.) 蔅UT, ordered the creme brulee which was DIVINE... but you must have a sweet tooth bc that sucker is SWEET. also the wild grape soda was a little disappointing, but my friend said it the more he drank the more he liked it. WAFFLE FRIES, YES. definitely have to come back... the fresh waffles themselves are enticing. 蔵t'd be nice if they had maybe one more veggie option. 蔿ike the green eggs and ham sounded awesome!

OVERRATED. Any place that serves a waffle sandwich that isn't even close to being WARM is NOT okay with me. I've been here twice now and both times the sandwiches were closer to cold than warm. Forget about hot. I asked a server last time why it wasn't hot and he said 'We make the waffles in bulk before so we can keep up with the service. I'd be happy to reheat it for you.' Uh, NO THANKS. I'd prefer it HOT to start. Charge $0.50 for maple syrup and the little container was not even half full. Ridic. I'll try it one more time, but if I get another almost cold sandwich, I'm out for good.

The place itself is not too hard to find, it's on a corner with a big sign that says "BRUXIE" yeah not hard to miss hahaha The food is good not great because when you eat it, it's exactly what you think it is...food stuffed in the middle of a Belgian waffle. I had the buttermilk fried chicken waffle sandwich. The chicken itself is good, a bit of a cajun flavor so there's a hint of spice but not overbearing at all which actually adds another dimension of flavor to the sandwich The waffle is a typical crispy Belgian waffle but combined with the chicken which is a little soggy for being fried adds a layer of texture. BUT the liege waffle is out of this world, you don't even need to put anything on it. The liege waffle is a dough based waffle (as a opposed to a batter based Belgian waffle). The waffle is made with crystallized sugar which is only made in 3 factories around the world and 2 of them are in Belgium. You just have to try it. Next time I go here I'll definitely try something else but it's definitely worth it. -2 for lack of bathrooms, I don't care if it's part of the history of the building people need to go pee!

I've been here twice now so I figured I can now write a review. 蔍t's at a corner and you will need to find street parking, there's a small lot but chances are, the spots already taken. �First time I had the chicken & waffles. 蔊ood fried chicken and waffle was good. 蔍 liked the slaw but could have used a bit more. 蔍 don't feel like the chicken covered enough of the waffle though. 蔅ut crispy waffle as well. 蔜he seasonal strawberry shake, is the bomb!!! 蔛oo chunky and well worth it. 蔜his mealed cost me about $13. �Friend got the goat cheese & argula one which she liked but i thought it was ok, i'm not a goat cheese fan though. 蔜he lemon & creme waffle was delicious. 蔠hatever is in the lemon creme is soo good!!! 蔆ould use a few more berries but very good. �2nd time I went, I got the bbq special waffle which was excellent!! 蔊ood amount of meat on it and it has the slaw in there was well. 蔍 really liked this one. 蔄lso go the strawberry 蔛ister got the Prosciutto & Gruyere- Whole Grain Mustard and Chives, she really liked hers, she said over and over. 蔉or $2, you can add waffle fries which you can't go wrong! ��Chicken and waffles again for the kids. 蔔o spot for eating so really hard if you have young kids to eat here. 蔎ust be warned.

Simply the best waffles! Had the burger waffle which was fantastic, the fried chicken waffle which was wayyyyyyy better than Roscoe's, and the creme brulee waffle, which was so delicious I didn't need to add any of the agave syrup that is available. The waffles are super llight and crunchy and toasty, with hardly any of the heavy dough in the middle that plagues other waffles. The contents and toppings themselves aren't that mind-blowing, but they work well with the waffle without overpowering it. Really, it's all about the waffle. A must try!

Looks like Old Town Orange has a hipster invasion. This place has a good variety of savory and sweet items catering to waffles. 蔍 find that the wait and parking can hinder customers but the food is worth the trouble. 蔜he chicken and waffles sandwich is tasty and the frozen custard is indescribably creamy and decadent. �With such creative food, I'd expect to see it in the prices. 蔜o get the whole waffle, fries and shake experience is going to cost around $12. 蔔ot bad at all. If you're walking around Old Town on a hot day, stop by and grab a sweet treat at Bruxie. 蔊et a waffle sandwich just to say that you've tried it, but otherwise, save your appetite for a big dinner elsewhere.

YUMMY!! This place is awesome! I was here yesterday for the first time with my bf. I love to try a lot of stuff so I order the chicken and waffle, cheddar bacon and egg waffle a side order of waffle fries and creme brulee for desserts oh and a mint chocolate shake to wash it all down, my bf got the seasonal short rib waffle, pastrami waffle and brussel waffle for dessert plus a root beer. chicken and waffle came with little bit of cole slaw and honey syrup , i dont really like honey so i preferred the maple syrup. The chicken was so so, i was expecting it to be crispy and juicy when you bite into it but it taste like it was sitting in the kitchen for a while and for this reason it didnt get the full 5 stars cheddar bacon & egg was delish. breakfast is always yummy ! pastrami was really good. Full of flavor I like it more the "the hat's" pastrami. short ribs was so so, not much flavor the creme brulee was amazing, dont know how to describe it, you NEED to try this one for yourself. droolz! the brussel waffle is basically a reg. waffle with powdered sugar on there nothing special. mint choco shake was really good, one of the best mint and chip shake I've had. root beer is root beer lol.. will be returning to try the rest of the savory waffles while the bf tries all the dessert waffles lol..

Yes, it deserves all 5 stars ! ! ! ! ! You must try their Green Eggs & Ham ("a seasonal fave"). (It's actually the Pesto that adds the green, but since it's smothered over the ham... Dr. Seuss would be proud.) Also, their Prosciutto & Gruyere is so... goood.. my friend 蔯alled it "gourmet ham and cheese." 蔍t has good quality prosciutto which blends so lovingly with the sharp (you might even get cut) cheese. The waffle-bun (Great idea) is so ... unimposing to the overall sandwich experience! 蔔ot too thick or doughy, it has the perfect texture and slight crispiness that harmoniously brings together the tasty little meal. For a drink, I had their homemade strawberry lemonade- Yes. Not your average pink lemonade from In-N-Out, even though the color's quite similar. 蔜his one you can actually taste and see strawberry bits. Their Shakes are AMAZINGLY good! Try their Strawberry Shake. Not only is it pretty, the whipped cream is awesome and the shake itself tastes surprisingly naturally delicious! So yes, it is most definitely Worth the wait. 蔄nd to top it off, the chef (Philippe) walks around handing out menus and talking to people with his awesome Belgium accent. 蔛eriously, What else can you ask for?

My wife and I finally got a chance to drop by here for a late lunch today. There was a small manageable crowd and the line went fairly quickly. While in line we were asked if we needed any assistance with the menu. We decided to try a few and went with the Chicken and Waffle, a Pulled Pork, and Lemon Cream & Berries. My wife's Chicken and Waffle was cooked to perfection. The waffle was crispy as was the chicken and the chicken meat was moist and very tender. Could be a bit more spicy but still very good. The pulled pork was very well put together. The pork had the right amount barbeque flavor which allowed you to enjoy the pork without being overpowered by the sauce. Wife and I both enjoyed this one quite a lot. For desert we had the Lemon Cream & Berries and what a great way to end the meal. The mixture of tart and sweet was spot on and a perfect finish to are lunch. Is the food cheap? No but IMHO you get more than you pay for in terms of the quality of what you get. Yes it is waffles and some fillings that you order at a window and might have to stand to eat. But for us it was about what we were eating not where. Already planning another trip with the kids...

Bruxie is pretty much a food stand located just outside of the Orange Circle. It has about 5 tables where you can eat outside and parking is very limited. Fortunately, the staff is very helpful and friendly and the food is GOOD. I've had the prosciutto & gruyere, seasonal short ribs & fried chicken waffle sandwiches. The fillings for these sandwiches are pretty standard but good nonethless - though I must point out that the fried chicken had a very strong thyme flavor. What puts these sandwiches over the top although, is the bruxie waffle. I usually get turned off by the idea of mixing my savory foods with sweet foods but the bruxie waffle was not sweet at all. It just tasted like a nice textured, crispy, and surprisingly light (as far as waffles go..) sandwich bun. Good stuff, would definitely return again.

Nutella and banana was great. I love the sweet cream they put on it. Smoked salmon and dill was good but not anything mind blowing. Mushroom and goat cheese was excellent but its seasonal so hurry up and get yours. They serve nice coffee (peets) so that was nice. Liege waffle with belgian chocolate was an awesome sweet tooth craving fix. Waffle fries are french fries (not waffles) but are still bomb! Overall an awesome place to eat.

Bruxie is known for their fried chicken and waffles. Yes I know they've creatively combined the two to form a sandwich, and it's an impressively novel idea, but it's still just chicken and waffles. You're just eating with your hands instead of a fork. So don't get overly excited. Lucky for Bruxie, though, chicken and waffles is fucking good. They also have a bunch of other waffle sandwiches, two of which we tried. Fried chicken waffle - The waffle is buttery, crispy, and is drizzled with some kind of spicy and sweet honey sauce. Two thumbs way up. The fried chicken is nicely seasoned, and fried just right. One thumb up. Bruxie's real opportunity to shine here would've been with awesome cole slaw, but their slaw is really bland. No thumbs. Oh and, maple syrup will cost you an extra 50 cents, but these are 50 cents you'll definitely want to spend. Trust me. Use that syrup with every bite. Mushroom arugula and goat cheese waffle - This one was a bit too much for me. The arugula is fine, but I'm not the biggest fan of mushrooms in large quantities. They're also very, very, very liberal with the goat cheese. I took two bites and had to stop there. Bacon egg and cheese waffle - This one was exactly what I hoped it would be. So simple. So beautiful. Dip it in maple syrup, ketchup, or hot sauce. They all work. Go nuts. Lemon cream and berries waffle - This one was a light and fruity complement to the saltiness and richness of the other ones. The lemon cream was delicious, and not too lemony. The berries were fresh. And of course, the buttery, crispy waffle is the best part. Restaurants are finally starting to learn, just as I am - great service really can make or break a dining experience. The service here at Bruxie is amazing. They were helpful when we couldn't decide what to order. They were nice enough to bring our food out to our table for us. And they even improvised a berry and yogurt parfait for my lady friend who didn't want the waffle. So the food here earns four stars. The service earns the fifth.

There's so many reviews on this place, and they just opened up not too long ago! That means they're really popular & they must be doing something right. && Yes, they are doing something right indeed! Only wrong is that they're so far from me :( The Place: Anyway, for some reason I though this place would be indoors, but upon arrival I saw a huge line outside and yeup, it's outdoor! But it's ok, the weather was beautiful and the sun was shining. It's also hard to find parking, so expect a walk. The staff is extra friendly, and really helpful when deciding what to order. Also, they're a pet friendly place, and love all mutts and have a treat handy for them. The Food: Can you say DEEEEE-LISH?!? First of all, I'm a sucker for waffles, and to put it as a sandwich? OH HELL YEA! I ordered the fried chicken and waffle. It was really really good! I love the honey that's drizzled on it, as well, as the slaw. The buttermilk fried chicken and the waffle were really crunchy, and there was no hint of sogginess at all. That's a plus to me! Only thing I wish, because I'm fatty, is that I wish the sandwich was a tad bit bigger. I kind of wanted more. I guess it's ok so that I can come back then! My boyfriend ordered the bacon, egg & chedder sandwich and I believe it was better than the fried chicken. It was like an upgraded version of the McGriddle from McDonald's, only it's wayyyy wayyy better. The waffle was of course really crunchy, and the portion of the bacon & egg inside were just right. I also love how the bacon was crunchy and did not sog up inside the sandwich. I would definitely come back and order this instead. OVERALL: I LOVEEE THIS PLACE! I'm a fan for life! I wish I lived closer so that I can come everyday if I could. Even if it's an outdoor restaurant, it's still clean. They're not expensive at all either. For the price and for the quality of the food, this place gets a million thumbs up! I hope they open one up in LA very soon! Next time I go, I really want to try the sweets!

Went randomly (around 10PM) after a random event at one of Chapman's campuses and I have to say, i wasn't really impressed. Got the... waffle with powder sugar and Nutella (I forget the name of it though). Wasn't even a FULL waffle, just a partial - sort of like the center of one of the other waffles pictured. Nutella comes on the side in a little container. I don't know if I got a bad waffle - maybe I should've gone for a Belgian waffle? I do prefer lighter and crispier waffles - or what, but it was slightly cold (or at least room temp), VERY thick and VERY dense, hard to cut (bent my plastic utensils, but then again those things are pretty crappy anyways) and overall fairly unappetizing. Apparently their hot chocolate here is good, though I didn't get it. Not sure I'll return to give this place another chance... if I do, I will update.

Waffles are not just for breakfast and soul food. 蔜hey're also the vehicle for all sorts of savory and sweet sandwiches. We came for dessert so I ordered the LEMON & BERRIES. 蔜he not too sweet waffle (same batter for all waffles served) house a really good lemon curd and blackberries. 蔍t was kind of perfect...sweet, carb, crunch, and a perfect size. He ordered the DATE SHAKE. 蔍t was the first date shake we've ever had and felt the flavor wasn't super prevalent. 蔔evertheless, it gave the shake an opportunity to showcase the frozen custard base, which was delicious. �We'll be returning to try the savory sandwiches.

I'm not impressed with this place at all....I had huge expectations because I love chicken and waffle. Pretty sure when this place opened up they didn't expect the level of success they're seeing right now. Given the shear number of reviews I had to try it out because most of the time Yelp is pretty good. The food is just ok and not something I would come back for again. The 蔯rowd that packs this place is the same that make food trucks famous -younger, high-school/college-aged kids looking for cheap trendy places to eat. I don't mind these places at all but when I'm hungry I want my food immediately and I HATE places that dont have enough tables. Fighting for tables is annoying to say the least. I was 蔲irst to spot a table about to be done and just turned away for one second 蔭nd some fat douche and his fat girlfriend called dibbs on it and I was like WTF? They really need to have a line where you would stand in after ordering and someone would direct you to an open table. This whole table-stalking-waiting-for-folks-to-be-done is un-classy. Now if only Roscoes opens up a restaurant in Westminster or something. Dear Roscoes restaurant management: Asians love soul food too!

Everything on their savory menu sounded so delicious when I first came here. I tried the fried chicken, burger, salmon & dill cream cheese, grilled cheese, and short ribs, but there really wasn't much I would make the drive back for again. Out of those, I liked the burger and short rib waffles. The other ones were either too heavy or just okay/bland. For the grilled cheese, I realized at my last few bites that they forgot to add my ham! I think that would've made a huge difference to cut out the bland-ness (or more cheese!). I still have to try the prosciutto one! As for the sweet selection, I liked them all but since I'm not much of a dessert person, I can't see myself coming back just for it. The creme brulee waffle was amazing!! Overall, love the whole community feel of Bruxie and the friendly staff. And definitely one of the restaurants I would've never found were it not for Yelp. At the same time, I feel Yelp made me just have wayyy too high expectations for a simple waffle sandwich. Thanks for the great experience (:

If you don't like this place you don't have a soul. But seriously.. Everything is good. Creative combos of high quality ingredients in between a waffle fold. That sounds too good to be true. The service is lightning fast too. Even if there's a long, obnoxious, around the block line- I've braved it twice now and have yet to wait longer than ten or fifteen minutes. Seasonal shakes are top notch.. super sweet and decadent. Try the green eggs and ham if it's available. You won't be disappointed. Prices might be a little steep but the food and quality service makes that detail soon forgotten. This place is twelve notches above the rest of the OC crap. Go and try something new!

You can't really go wrong with a waffle and seeing as they serve waffle sandwiches, Bruxie goes all kinds of right. First things first, the establishment is right next to Chapman University and the parking lot only holds about three cars, so finding parking is not easy. 蔠e've been pretty fortunate the past couple of visits, but during busy times it can be downright frustrating. 蔍n addition, seating is at a premium so make sure to send a scout to claim a table for you! On to the good stuff. 蔜here are savory and sweet portions to the menu to fulfill all of your innermost waffle desires. 蔜here are also "pure cane sugar" sodas, milkshakes, and frozen custard desserts. 蔍 ordered the fried chicken waffle, which comes with chili honey. 蔍 added maple syrup on the side for $1. 蔍t was good for what it was. 蔜he fried chicken was moist and the waffle was a little crunchy. 蔍 think Roscoes has ruined me forever, though, because no other chicken and waffle will ever compare. 蔄las, I shall continue. 蔜he others in my party ordered the Bruxie Burger, Cheesy Bruxie, and the Bacon, Egg and Cheddar. 蔄ll were devoured, though my friend and I each had to surrender half of our sandwiches to the boys in the group because we were just too full. 蔆onsidering sandwiches run $5-8, they're a very good deal. �I also had a dulce de leche shake, which was thick and creamy, but almost too sugary for me. 蔉or someone with a Caramel Frappucinno habit like mine, that's saying a lot. 蔒y friend had the strawberry lemonade, which tasted very fresh and was the perfect balance between lemony tart and berry sweet. 蔍 think this is seasonal, so get it quick! �To finish everything off we ordered the banana nutella waffle and added peanut butter because, let's face it, peanut butter only makes things better. 蔜he result was warm, gooey, and demolished in about a minute, all markers of one fantabulous decadent dessert. During our visit, Bruxie staff were regularly walking around to check on us and were more than willing to place additional orders for us so we didn't have to wait in line again, which was very much appreciated. 蔠e'll definitely be back!

Who ever knew that something that tastes so heavenly, in its sweetly, sugary glazed form can also be equally, if not, more delicious in a savory, salty form? Ladies and Gentlemen. I present to you a truly inventive, young, ingenious concoction of what is called the BELGIAN WAFFLE SANDWICH! Don't fret. You're probably thinking, "What heck?!" Belgian waffle sandwiched with salty deliciousness?! Seriously dudes and dudettes. This is the real shizzle. I tried the Bruxie Burger and the trademark of Bruxie's, its waffle & fried chicken combo. The burger was good with its melted, oozing cheddar cheese, crisp lettuce, fresh tomatoes and slight layer of mayo; however, the succulent, moist crispness of the fried chicken hit the sweet spot. Pair it with some waffle crisp fries and you have yourself a perfect date. Since I wasn't satisfied with just the savory and needed something sweet (as always), I had to order myself a shake. I got the "date shake," which was a specialty drink that was blended with bits of dates in a consistently creamy, balanced milkshake that was 蕋opped with whip cream and a thick drizzled layer of caramel. oooo baby. You can be my date anytimeeee ;) I have to pay Bruxie another visit. There's so much more to try!!! Prosciutto & Gruyere is my next pick. Bruxie anyone?

Waffle sammies??!?! Ingenius!! Charlie C. and I got the burger and the chicken&waffle. The burger was sooooo gooooood!! The waffle was so light and was a beautiful vehicle to the the goodies inside. It wasn't heavy and dense like most other waffles I have tried. The chicken&waffle was not as good. The chicken was kind of dry. Lack of flavor. HOWEVER, the addition of maple syrup on it made it sooooo much better. The syrup costs $1 more which is whack but whatevs. The waffle fries are delish. Crisp and flavorful. Overall, it's pricey for what you get. But it was still delicious and something new to try! I will be back if I am craving a waffle :)

On the desperate search to fill my tummy before a long melancholy evening ahead of me, I decided to return to my old stomping grounds of Chapman U to satisfy my waffle curiosity. �I had NO IDEA this was that old burger/shake place, Dairy Treet or whatever!) Fried chicken and waffle with cole slaw and chili honey sauce + liege waffle with belgian chocolate + combo waffle fries + vanilla cream soda = just over $15. 蔊ot everything to go because 1) I didn't know how much food this was going to be since I just wanted to try stuff, and 2) I wanted to get some food over to my brother later on. Everything came out in a timely manner, and the service was very helpful and nice. 蔉ried chicken was folded in the waffle, but didn't seem too overwhelming for one person to devour. 蔍 just wish there was more cole slaw and chili honey sauce on the side. 蔍 was so enamored with the sauce that I made my own added concoction of sriracha and honey from their condiment counter. Chicken was tasty on its own, if not a bit dry. 蔠affle is nice, light and crispy. 蔇abbled in the waffle fries, which were delicious, and later on with my brother I got a bit of the liege waffle. 蔅elgian chocolate is the sex. I have to admit that I wasn't completely full afterward; I think I wanna come back here with more people to try more stuff. 蔔ot that I didn't like my meal, but there's so many menu items that sound amazing. 蔜hanks Bruxie for bringing this much-needed concept to the area!

Before eating here, I memorized the menu and looked the photos of the food porn. It exceeded my high expectations! As a group, we ordered the mushroom with goat cheese, breakfast with scrambled egg, fried chicken, and lemon cream with berries. You must eat it fresh and fast to enjoy the perfect texture of the light crispy waffles. Friendly staff was asking if anyone needed help with the menu and while dining, was visited again to make sure everything was good. I think they should close off the entire parking lot and make more tables and chairs. You have to park on the street anyway! It's worth the short walk. I can't wait to go back!

Well, first of all, I never really understood the hype for Chicken and Waffles. 蔛ure, they're okay, but nothing ZOMG TO DIE FOR and make trips out to LB or LA for it. 蔅ut when I had a chance to go to Bruxie, I didn't think much of it and I'm very glad I did. Parking wasn't too bad and the place gave me a home-y feel, despite it being outdoors. 蔍 got the Prosciutto & Gruyere but added lettuce and cucumbers, as well as an egg, as per the register guy's advise and it was SO. GOOD. 蔋alfway through, I forgot the bread holding my delicious lunch together was a waffle.. not sure if that's a good thing or a bad one, but I definitely look forward to checking out other menu items.

After going there for the first time, i wanted to take my fiance there to try it out since I kept raving about this place all the time. We finally made it a date to go at night. I ended up wanting to order something different from the last visit so i got the Roasted Mushroom and Goat Cheese and he got the Bacon Egg and Cheddar. He was skeptical about this place prior getting there, but boy did things change once he took a bite out of that waffle! HA! He LOVED it like how i loved every bit of this place! Then we shared the Lemon Creme and Berries since i know he loves lemon and I love berries so that worked out for the both of us! haha! He now wants to come here often when he wants another waffle craving. I converted him into the dark side! ;)

I wasn't expecting much, just some waffles in place of buns, but I wanted to see why this place had such high ratings. I must say I was impressed with the quality!! 蔒y bf and I ordered the Buttermilkd Chicken Waffle Sandwich and the Smore Waffle and enjoyed every last bit of it!!! The waffle was fluffy with a bit of a crisp and the chicken was juicy with the right amount of seasoning (beats the quality of roscoe's soggy waffles and oily chicken) Don't forget the syrup to dip the chicken sandwich in (although its a extra dollar, but I always have to have my dipping sauce with my meals). Speaking of prices, I would say it is a bit pricy for the size of the sandwich. The chicken sandwich with a side of syrup is nearly 9 bucks! But I guess that's the price of a gourmet waffle.

Gourmet waffle sandwiches you say? Oh you fancy huh! The people behind this concept are geniuses and I just want to thank them for being born! My sister Laura L. came here before me, and I was "mad" at her for not bringing me along because I have been wanting to try it since before it opened. 蔛he was nice enough to invite me to go with her and a friend on her second visit! Yes, she's obsessed! It's located in Old town Orange, which I simply adore, and what a perfect spot it is for a delicious meal! I was a bit concerned about it being outdoor seating only because I hate when pigeons try to get at my crumbs! However, I am happy to report that I did not see any of those disgusting birds around! The only problem is that they need MORE tables to accommodate the large crowds! It didn't look like it was slowing down at all, even after lunch rush. We ordered a few different sandwiches and split it in threes. The guy working their said to let him know next time we are sharing and he would cut the sandwiches for us! 蔋ow nice! We tried the burger, prosciutto, and fried chicken sandwiches. The burger was moist and went well with the light crisp waffle! The chicken was also juicy, and I didn't mind that the waffle got a little soggy from the coleslaw. The prosciutto and gruyere was also flavorful and the cheese was melted and oozing out of the sides a bit, which I loved! The show stealer's were the sweet waffles though! The s'mores one had an even amount of chocolate and marshmallow and was balanced well! The berries with sweet cream was my absolute favorite though! The strawberries were sweet, and not tart at all. Although I think it was because of the jelly, but it was still delicious! The waffle fries were seasoned very well and were just crispy enough on the outside but soft enough on the inside. I had to try their cola, which was also wonderful! I cannot wait to come back and try something new. 蔍 don't think this place will be slowing down soon, and it shouldn't!

Came here this past Saturday with my sissy, oh it was pretty good and filling. We ordered the chicken and waffle and the Bruxie Burger along with the liege waffle with nutella. The chicken was moist with a crispy thin coating, it came with a slaw (wished they had added more of it though). My sis's Bruxie burger was tasty and perfectly pink in the center. You gotta eat it fast though bc the meat juice will soak through the waffle and will get it all soggy. Oh and the liege waffle? ooooohhh my gooodness, super dense and super good! I think that was what really filled me up, and it went perfectly with my black coffee. will definitely be back if i'm in the area. all of the above plus a hot tea came to about 23 bucks if i remember correctly. not bad at all.

I had the proscuitto and gruyere with whole grain mustard, and my wife had the hash and eggs. Mine was -ok-, though it almost seemed as if it was a last minute after thought waffle sandwich, and was not anything special, though, it was still good. My wifes was very good, and the egg was perfectly cooked. The frozen custard was delicious, creamy, sweet, and a perfect dessert after the sandwiches. All in all, it was decent. I wish they did more with the waffle batter. Service was great. And the food was still quite good. The size of the sandwich isn't the biggest either. Next time though, I will definitely get the buttermilk fried chicken sandwich. This place is worth visiting, and I will be back...

On those days when you feel like splurging your calories on a sandwich... go to Bruxie! It's well worth it. Service: Excellent. The two ladies were friendly and quick on their feet. Location: I was surprised that it wasn't really a "restaurant" (more of a stand with semi-outdoor seating) but it worked out fine. The table rotations worked out well without having to wait too long. The only downside for me was that some of the tables are placed right beside the order window... which means that there are also people crowding that area. So it was a bit uncomfortable having people either eyeing your table until you're finished or just standing around you while you're eating. Other than that, everything else was great. And honestly, I guess it fits the mood of the place. But that's not much of a concern because the scrumptious sandwich steals your attention away anyways! :) Food: We ordered the buttermilk fried chicken waffle (must try it with the syrup!) and the lemon cream/berries dessert waffle. The chicken waffle was delicious. The lemon/berry waffle..... hmm..it wasn't necessarily that it tasted bad, but I'm not the biggest fan of tart-y or sour tasting cream. I guess it wasn't what I was expecting. Regardless, I could definitely see why people would like it, and I would recommend it to those who like that tart-y/sour taste in their cream filling. Can't wait to try the other dessert waffles on the menu though... the strawberry creme brulee waffle looks delicious! Get it while it lasts b/c it's seasonal! Tip for the business?: Wet-naps would be a great plus since eating waffles with your hands can get messy and greasy... and since there aren't any bathrooms to wash your hands after.

Driving back from an event at Chapman University, I see a long line of students huddled in a corner. 蔍 see the sign, "The Bruxie" and the "...waffle sandwich" tag line. 蔍mmediately, I'm intrigued. 蔆hallenge accepted. So I came here two days ago in the rain and cold. 蔜here was a line in spite of the weather. 蔍 nearly got run over trying to get here. Once I checked out the menu, I saw so many items to try that I couldn't help but feel overwhelmed. 蔄 common problem vexes me at these type of joints: do I go with sweet, sugary goodness or should I tackle the mountain of fried, salty, peppery deliciousness? 蔛o...I went with both. �Here's what I ordered (with friends): 1. Buttermilk Fried Chicken Waffle Sandwich (with a touch of maple syrup) 2. Seasonal Favorite: Beef Short Rib with Caramelized Onions, Blue Cheese, Gravy Waffle Sandwich (aka. The Best, Good, Main Reason To Go Here) 3. Pastrami/Reuben Waffle Sandwich 4. Brussels Style Waffle 5. Fries All washed down with a Coca-Cola and Peet's Hot Cocoa. �My review? Food: A I'd give this spot a B+ because like I said, I'm not a big fan of mixing sweet and salty foods together. 蔋owever, they're doing something right here. 蔄nd the Beef Short Rib Waffle Sandwich is sheer goodness. 蔜he meat fell off the waffle sandwich with such rhythm and grace, that it was purely seductive. 蔍t brought back memories of sitting in my mom's kitchen on a Saturday evening, with her pot roast and veggies and gravy. 蔍 was thrown back into time. �Service: A+ The partners and executive chef personally greeted us while we waited in line, in the rain. 蔜hey even promised us sun (which eventually did come out). 蔄nd thanked us sincerely for coming out. 蔕ur server was cheeky, sweet and efficient. 蔛he even gave us a small ice cream sample. 蔛o...in short, great service. 蔄nd yes, I can be bought. Ambiance: B Well, for what it is (a joint or stand) - it's not that bad. 蔍 like that they kept the color scheme simple, without sacrificing the integrity of the joint/stand feel. 蔍 recommend that you make one of your friends find a table the minute you get a parking spot and order their food for them. �Location: C I give it a C because I live in the Irvine area and it's too far for me...plus, you have to deal with the Old Town Orange circle. 蔒y recommendation - take Chapman off the 5 or 55, and then find Sycamore or another side street perpendicular to Glassell. That way you can avoid the circle and find street parking. �So yes, I'm a fan. 蔜his was the only meal I ate that day, after waddling back to my car, and ready to doze off for nap. 蔉or a minute, I debated signing up for Insanity. 蔐ol.

Bruxie was more of a 3 and 1/2 for me but I'll round up to be nice. :] We came here on the recommendation of a few friends. It wasn't what I expected at all (a stand type thing) but it wasn't a bad, just unexpected. I actually liked the super casualness of it all. I got the prosciutto & gruyere and it was yummy! I love prosciutto so this was a must try for me! The best part is definitely the waffle. It was light and crispy...sooo good! Don't expect those huge and heavy waffles you get at diners. My boyfriend got the smoked salmon & cream cheese and we both preferred the one I got much more! I would pass on the smoked salmon one. i think those ingredients (smoke salmon & cream cheese) should be reserved for bagels. 蔄lso, if you like SWEET than go for the strawberry lemonade. I had to dilute ours with water because it was sooo sweet. Overall, if I were in the Orange area, I would come again for a quick bite to eat but I wouldn't go out of my way to come here. It is definitely a novelty type thing to me.

both locations did not live up to the hype. i've tried at least 6 different sweet and savory options in addition to the shakes. i'd say nothing was worth any wait in line. is it worth trying? yes. is it something i'd go back to? probably not more than i've already been. the buttermilk fried chicken n waffle is not as heavy as it sounds. it was probably the best on the menu. i'd say try this and a sweet waffle of your choice. :)

I'm have to say when my friend said lets go get some waffle sandwiches/burgers i was a little skeptical. But whats life if you can't be open minded. So I ordered the Bruxie Burger and my first impression was, a burger with waffle as its buns this is going to be interesting. So I took my first bite and all of these delicious flavors just rush to my mouth. The meat was perfectly cooked med-rare. Also the strawberry milk shake was amazing, made with real strawberry and it was just perfect. If your in town, you should definitely check out Bruxie. What makes this place even better was the customer service. The owner would swing by and ask how the food was and even talked about how they came up with the idea of waffle sandwiches and burgers. I definitely recommend this place.

Never had a waffle sandwich that wasn't somehow related to dessert before hitting up Bruxie. In the heart of Orange, near Chapman University, lies this waffle stand. 蔉riends and I hit this place up a few weekends back since I'd heard such great things about it. The menu isn't large. There are sweet waffle sandwiches as well as savory ones. 蔜here were also some specials of the day (green eggs and ham was one of them). 蔍 chose to get the bacon, egg and cheese waffle sandwich with a side of syrup, as well as a latte. My friends got the goat cheese one and the same one I got, as well as the Liege (basically a belgian waffle with chocolate sauce). My sandwich was divine! I really liked how they pre-cut the waffle so you could easily manage eating the sandwich. 蔜he syrup was great too as it gave me just the right amount of sweetness. 蔈verything was delicious and reasonably priced. 蔜he Liege was tasty with a nice Belgian chocolate sauce flavor. We felt very full but headed over to the Perfect Circle cupcakery. Parking is a pain in this area as there is a lot of permit only streets. You might get lucky (as I did) to find 2 hour free parking just a couple steps from Bruxie.

My family and I absolutely love this place! Its our cheat meal almost every weekend :) I've brought co-workers, friends, and relatives here every chance I've had. Best mint chocolate chip shake and Bacon/Egg/cheddar waffle sandwiches; however I won't neglect the Bruxie Burger as well :) Desserts are off the chart. The Creme Brulee, Nutella/Bananas, or even Soft serve frozen custard are faves that everyone must try..... If you love an explosion of Asian flavors, try the Ogura Bruxie too.... Always try their seasonal items..... and ask them for any recommendations if your new to the place! Don't be afraid to venture into new things. It will have you coming back for MORE! TIP: Expect a long line (depending on what time you arrive). So be prepared for crowded parking as well since its an out door eatery located on the corner off Glassel in the Chapman Univ. District. ---- BUT ITS WELL WORTH THE WAIT!!

First off, let me say that I am a fan of anything that involves waffles. Normally, they have always been breakfast food for me, but I am completely willing to integrate them into lunch as well. I had a hard time deciding which sandwich to get - there are so many that sound delicious. In the end, I decided to try one of their seasonal offerings (figuring that it might not be there very long and I can always go back for an item on their regular menu). So, braised short rib on waffles it was! It was tasty, but the juice from the meat made the bottom waffle pretty soggy. I also got the seasonal strawberry shake. This was also really yummy, but I don't think I would pay $5 for it again. Service was nothing short of stellar. They hand you a menu as you wait in line and their staff/chefs talk with you about the menu items as you wait. Someone then takes your order when you get to the front of the line and then you pay at the window - very efficient and it keeps the line moving. They then bring your order to you when it is ready just a few minutes later. Everyone was super friendly and really helpful - they actually made waiting a fun experience!

Want a healthy chicken n waffle without all that greazzy feel to it?!?! Came here for brunch on a Saturday. It was pretty busy with a short wait to order. Bruxie is like a food stand kind of place (order at the window, grab your food, then grab one of the standing tables or benches...and GRUB!) Food of choice: - Buttermilk Fried Chicken n Waffle - Prosciutto and Gruyere - Waffle Fries Served sandwich style in which the waffle serves as the bread or wrap. The waffles were all fluffy and not greasy or too buttery. PERFECT! The Fried Chicken, not bad?!?! Not greasy and had some flavor! Prosciutto and Gruyere was ok, it was serve kinda cold to be honest, it would've probably tasted better if it was a little warmer. Waffle Fries....looked "plain jane", but amazingly good! I would have to say the additional flavor comes from the fact they use peanut oil versus traditional corn oil. I would come back and recommend. Not bad a for a quick brunch thats not too heavy.

Bruxie lived up to expectations. 蔠hen I drove by there was a fatty line but it moved fairly quickly. 蔠e ordered the wild mushroom with waffle fries and bbq pulled pork. Wild mushroom sandwich was soo delicious. 蔒elted goat cheese with juicy mushrooms and arugula make up this sandwich. 蔜he waffle itself was crisp and light. 蔛eriously delicious. 蔜he goat cheese was very strong and can be a bit overpowering but I loved it! Bbq pulled pork sandwich came with so much meat topped with yummy sauce and chopped cabbage. 蔍t was a perfect blend of sweet and salty all wrapped inside a waffle. Waffle fries were decent. 蔔othing crazy but it was still good. I give this place 4.5 stars. 蔍 can't wait to go back and try some of their famous sandwiches and sweets

I literally just ate there for lunch about 30 mins ago. It was so good that I had to review RIGHT NOW before the memory of it faded. It took me ten minutes (almost hitting a pedestrian...sorry guy!) to find parking. Luckily I didn't park that far away, but the inconvenient parking is what keeps this rating at a 4 star level. The line wasn't too bad, and it only took about 5 or less minutes to actually get the order. I got the seasonal wild mushroom. Arugula, goat cheese, mushrooms and balsamic. MMMMMM I ate every last bite and feel stuffed. It was amazing. I can't wait to try what else is on the menu. I also splurged an a mint chocolate shake. So wonderful on this seriously hot day!

I've been to Bruxie twice and it never disappoints. The first time I went, the waiter recommended me the Turkey Reuben. It was something that comes only once every two weeks, so I said why not try it while it's available. I can't remember off the top of my head what was inside the waffle sandwich, but it was delicious. I never had a waffle sandwich before and my first bite was memorable. The best part was biting into the crisp waffle. It was something new to my teeth. I went with a friend and she ordered the Strawberry Creme Brulee. We asked for an extra cup of strawberries and they gladly gave it to us free of charge. Now this particular dessert has to be one of the best they make. It's like creme brulee in a waffle sandwich with strawberries. What could possibly be wrong about that. That is a must try before you die. One thing I wouldn't recommend is there Cherry Kiss Float. I don't have much of a sweet tooth and I thought it was a little too sweet for me. It wasn't that bad the first couple of bites, but after a while I couldn't handle it. If you have a sweet tooth than that 蕀aybe something you might like, just not for me, Bruxie is a must go, put it on your bucket list.

I don't know about 4 stars for this place. I actually went here thinking it was a restaurant! But realized it was more of a fast food sit and go kinda joint. (They only have a few tables outside). I don't know if it was the wrong choice, but my waffle was mediocre. 蔊ot the burger waffle. Friend of mine had the waffle with salmon and said it tasted delish. But just beware..food gets pretty greasy! I tried a bit of my boyfriends deepfried chicken and coleslaw waffle. That was YUM. I guess chicken&waffles really do go hand in hand because it was definitely a great pairing. The crunchiness of the waffle and fried chicken, with the texture of cold coleslaw drizzled with warm syrup- yum..perfecto! The sugar sodas depend on what you get. Cherrycoke is great. Vanillabean tastes like pure sugar and strawberry lemonade is just downright sour! Its a great place to try! I still have a lot of the items to try down their menu such as their desert waffles. Will definitely be back..hopefully results will be a better tasting experience :)

Deliciousness in a light & crispy waffle! I love the fried chicken waffles. Must eat it with maple syrup, it tastes so much better! The salmon waffle is good, but it's small. The pulled pork is huge, and tastes delicioius. The strawberry creme brulee is to die for; one of my fav. The strawberry lemonades is really good, tastes real and very flavorful. Seating is crappy, so try to come during slower hours.

I have not tried any of their savory waffles/waffle sandwiches so I can only speak of their dessert waffles. I have had their "special" - the strawberry creme brulee waffle - and it was AMAZING. 蔜he creme brulee cream was delicious, and the strawberries were fresh. 蔜he waffle was cooked perfectly - it was just sweet enough, lightly crisped on the outside and fluffy on the inside. I've also had the banana nutella waffle which was still good, but not as good as their special.

My friend took me here tonight and boy was it good! It's a tiny little place on the corner of old town Orange, right across from Chapman University. This place can get really busy, but don't be discouraged because the line moves quickly and all the staff are very competent and helpful, everybody was so nice, customer service is #1 at Bruxie's. We ordered the following: Bacon, Egg & Cheddar Buttermilk Fried Chicken & Waffle w/100% pure maple syrup Bruxie Burger Waffle Fries S'mores Pure Cane Sugar Cola Peet's Vanilla Latte Soft Serve Frozen Custard Everything was excellent, the best thing we ate was the FROZEN CUSTARD, omg it was so smooth and creamy, I want to stick my head under the machine and just eat it all up. Once you've had the soft serve here you will never want to eat ice cream or yogurt anywhere else, it is insanely good. I know this place is suppose to be known for their waffle sandwiches, but the frozen custard takes top billing in my book. You need to try it!

I feel like this place is a bit too overrated, I bought the chicken sandwich and lets just say there were micro cuts in my mouth for two days. The waffle was a bit dry and it was hard to bite without the whole thing going into a crumble. The chicken didn't even seem to flow with the sandwich, I had to eat them both separately! And it was also really crowded, take it to go.

I say 3.5 stars. 3 stars for food and creativity and half for it's unique location and design. The food was good but nothing made me go "YUM!" it was more "it's good..." My friend and I split the Bruxie Burger with fries and the Strawberry Creme Brule. For the burger, although I think the waffle was really light, the actual burger was meh, I've had better. I don't think the the waffle had enough body to hold up against the beef and it needed more sauce... The side of fries, which is $1 off when you get it with a waffle, was also meh. It was a little bland and not very crunchy. As for the stawberry creme brule, it was pretty good, but really sweet. �I like the location though! We beat the lunch traffic and got there around 3 on a Thursday afternoon so parking wasn't an issue but there is limited seating.

I'd say Bruxie is definitely a place you have to try atleast once. Came here back when it was very new to the area so I'm not sure if the lines are still 10-15 minutes during the week. I, of course, had to try the chicken and waffle which was excellent the first couple of bites but eventually became just alright. I would actually recommend the breakfast sandwich instead. I also got the sugar cane soda which tasted like an even sweeter version of pepsi but still good, perhaps not worth the 3 bucks however. The dessert type sandwiches look absolutely amazing which might call for a couple more visits.

I really like the idea of a waffle sandwich/burger so I was pretty excited about trying what Bruxie had to offer. Their menu is very diverse, as they offer a variety of both savory and sweet waffle creations. We ended up trying the buttermilk chicken and the braised short ribs. Buttermilk chicken- you can get this with maple syrup for an extra dollar though I opted against it. I was personally kinda disappointed by how small the piece of chicken was. I also thought that their decision to put the coleslaw inside the waffle was questionable since it caused the waffle to get soggy. I did really like how the chicken had a really subtle sweet flavor though. Guinness braised short rib- they only offer this on certain days (not on the main menu) and they say they run out early in the day so keep that in mind. They give you a generous portion of the rib meat, which was very tender. However, I personally thought they just had too much going on here (the barbecue sauce and the horseradish and the blue cheese is just too much). Overall, I'd say Bruxie is a cool place to try, as it really is something innovative, but I doubt I'd ever come back here to eat again. I can see how parking could be an issue (though it wasn't for us) and the line does get pretty long during peak hours. I also think that the prices are a little steep for what you get.

This place is pure delicious-ness. 蔍've tried the Buttermilk Fried Chicken, the Pulled Pork, and the ever SO wonderful Green Eggs and Ham. 蔍 believe Green Eggs and Ham was a special, so I'm not certain if they have it anymore, but it was THE ABSOLUTE BEST..... 蔜his place is great to go in the morning, for lunch, or at night. 蔍t's located in a quaint little neighborhood (well, next to a major university), and everything is outdoors. 蔛eating is limited, but you can just stand casually with a friend and munch on that delicious waffle sandwich. 蔜he waffles are crunchy on the outside, soft and moist on the inside. 蔍 also love their "pure cane sugar" sodas. 蔍 don't care that they're expensive for the size, I still love it! 蔍 must try the sweets next.

Wow, Just oh my gosh wow. Aside from the line (which isn't even THAT bad) there is absolutely nothing wrong with this place. It ain't no Dame's Chicken & Waffles in Durham, NC, but I wouldn't want it to be either! I had the Waffle Burger and Mint Chocolate shake. I could have ended my trip to LA, I mean Orange, at that moment, but I'm glad I didn't - you guys have such good food! The waffle wasn't as "fluffy" as I would have expected (I am from The South) but more like the standard waffle one expects from a shack on the side of the road. The burger inside was ok, I think it was just more about the experience than the food for me. My friend had the three cheese waffle. I didn't get to taste it since she finished it so fast. I wish we had ordered another one, but I'm glad we didn't. I almost went into a sugar coma after this brunch! I suggest getting there early since the line forms to the right. But once you order the waiting isn't that bad. I love how they have the stand up or sit down tables, I'm certain there are fewer Calories consumed when you eat standing up. Can someone do me a favor though? Can you ask them to make a peanut butter, banana, bacon waffle and bring it to me? Thanks in advance.

Waffle sandwiches = fabulous concept! 蔍 never get tired of creative eats. We meandered along here from my friend's place. It has only outdoor seating with a very casual vibe. The server mixed up our orders so we got double the amount of food that we had ordered. Scoooore for my belly!!! Irish waffles nachos: 蔍 love the concept, but I think the waffle fries are a little too much starch for me. An average dish, but I would skip it and focus on the main dishes. �The fried chicken waffle sandwich was awesome. The chicken was slightly sweet and perfectly crisp. 蔜he waffle was excellent. My favorite of the night was the pulled pork waffle sandwich. The pulled pork was just so tender and richly flavored, and the waffle added a nice bite. Definitely..too rich for regular eating, but we made up for it by walking home.

Instead of going for another waffle sandwich, I decided to try their frozen custard. Extremely creamy and smooth! Tastes very homemade, and at a reasonable price ($2.95). Definitely give it a try if you're in the area on a hot day.

I really don't know who thought up the idea to mix waffles with other food item other than the traditional butter, syrup, and maybe some fruit... But that person is a genius! 蔠affles have always been the traditional breakfast food. The first time I ever heard of waffles being mixed with something else was waffles and fried chicken! Everyone knows that place, but I fell out of love with "the place that shall not be spoken of" because of the quality is not the same. I had the chicken and wafflewich.. I am not a fan of slaw so I just got some greens instead. I chicken was really great. I added a little syrup to my waffle because I really couldn't taste it. Oh man that was a great idea! Perfect combo of organic syrup, fried chicken and waffle :D I also had the Irish Nacho's... White sauce (I think it was ranch) FAN, Bacon FAN (dude its bacon). Green Onions FAN, �and the Cheese NOT A FAN.... I have no idea what cheese it was but I didn't like it, and I LOVE CHEESE.... Just not this cheese :D Overall Bruxie was good. Fast service too! I would totally come back if I am in the area. I like the Orange Circle area.

I don't understand all the four and five star reviews of this place. 蔍t's not bad, but I don't think it lives up to all the four and five star Yelp hype. �The food: �Let's face it, the offerings are gimmicky. 蔜here's nothing necessary wrong with that, but gimmicky doesn't necessarily equal great. 蔍 think a lot of you four and five star reviewers are confusing the two. �I tried the bacon, egg, and cheddar. 蔍t was OK, but it was not four or five stars worth of OK. 蔍 say OK because it tasted rather bland to me, and a liberal dose of hot sauce couldn't overcome the sort of mixed up flavor pairings. 蔆onclusion: 蔔ot worth the calories and fat. �My wife and kids each got the fried chicken. 蔍'm glad I didn't. 蔜he waffles don't have enough substance to them to hold up to the big, greasy fried chicken breast in the middle of the folded over waffle. 蔆onclusion: 蔔ot worth the calories and fat. �The service: The staff here is friendly and helpful. 蔋owever, I can read a menu, and I don't need it explained to me while I'm waiting to get in line and order as tables fill up. 蔍t's almost as if the woman wouldn't let me get in line to order until I heard her spiel until it's conclusion. The tables are few, so this was a real bummer. �Parking: Parking is an issue here. �Pricing: A bit pricey for what it is. 蔍t was almost $40.00 for four of us. 蔜hat's a little much for what is basically fast food you have to stand in a parking lot to eat when the tables are full.

I want to give it 5 stars but there are a couple things that hold me back. For starters, there's no bathroom. Second, the lines are ridiculously long on the weekends. Third, if the place is full, you've got no place to eat your food unless you don't mind walking back to your car and eating inside it while you blast your air conditioner. These are just a few things that irk me but I feel the unique menu more than makes up for it. I mean, who else is making waffle sandwiches? Bruxie has definitely found its niche in an ever evolving culinary/foodie world. People like to fawn over the Chicken Waffle sandwich and while I admit that it's good, I choose to be adventurous and order the other stuff. The braised beef sandwich is definitely not one to be passed on! Same as the pulled pork sandwich but both are seasonal items so depending on what day you go, you may or may not see it on the menu. Also, try sinking your teeth into the smoked salmon and cream cheese sandwich. Yeah, I know it's not original but let's be real here, this is about making waffle sandwiches FROM original sandwiches. So besides the food, the staff and service is pretty good here, too. One thing I can't stand is tables that don't get cleaned after more than three minutes or servers who don't know what they're doing. These guys are definitely on top of it and to be sure they are, the owner is always outside greeting other customers and also in the bullpen with the other servers calling out names for pick up or bringing food to tables. You don't see that very often from restaurant owners. All in all, Bruxie is one of those restaurants where the food is also an experience. If you haven't been, you're missing out. And if you don't like it, that's fine. That's one less person I have to stand behind in line! =D

I went to Bruxie for the first time this morning with a very lovely lady. We were driving around old towne looking for somewhere to have breakfast and decided to stop and give it a try. I've passed by the waffle stand seemingly countless times without giving it a second thought. I now hate myself a little bit for that. I got the bacon egg and cheddar sandwich (without the mayo. I can't stand mayo). I knew it would be good (I mean, how can you go wrong with bacon eggs and cheese?) but it was even better than I expected. The waffle was fluffy, but also crisp and bread-y enough to make the sandwich really work. I guess you can get it with maple syrup in it. I'll have to try that next time. My boo (she's tiny and blonde and super flyyy) got the lemon cream and berries sandwich after one of the employees suggested it. She seemed to be quite satisfied with it. She also got a coffee. While we were eating our meal, one of the ladies who works there came up and gave us a free soda. The food had already made me fall in love with this place, but this just put it over the top for me. It's the little things like that that make me want be become a regular at places like this. Yeah, it's a little pricey, (just under 15 dollars for the two sandwiches and the coffee) but there are plenty of places around here with more expensive sandwiches that aren't half as good. I will definitely be coming back here. The food exceeded my expectations, and let's face it, it's a great place to take a fine lookin' lady out to breakfast.

Smoked Salmon and The Chicken and Waffles are a must. The smoked salmon is basically a philadelphia roll wrapped in a waffle but somehow it works. Chicken and waffles is self explanatory. This location gets way too crowded though and lines are ridiculous at peak hours.

This unique concept is a 4 only because the location is so small that the wait is insane and there is NO parking and NOWHERE to sit. 蔋owever, the food is good, the staff is friendly, and overall I'm a big fan of places that take boring and traditional and make it fun and innovative. 蔍 think this place qualifies.

What a fabulous concept!! 蔠ent to Bruxie after dinner one night for dessert. 蔜here was a bit of a line, but it moved quickly. 蔈mployees worked the line answering questions, handing out menus and taking orders. 蔣ou get up to the window with order in hand, and they quickly get your order placed and paid for. **Tip** 蔍f it is a busy night, make sure that you have someone in your party nab a table before you get to the front of the line. 蔍 got the fresh fruit with lemon filling... holy cow, yummalicious!! 蔜he lemon filling isn't too overwhelming and is just perfect with the berries and waffle. 蔒y amigo got the bananas and nutella (seriously, how can you EVER go wrong with Nutella!!). 蔄gain, it was a perfect mix, with nothing that was overwhelming in terms of taste. 蔅eing the wuss that I am, I could only do 1/2 of my waffle, so I had to take the rest home. 蔄sk for a togo container, they are more than happy to comply. 蔔ot only did I love the food, but the customer service was fabulous!! 蔜here were plenty of employees who genuinely seemed to enjoy their jobs, and want to make our experience a positive one. 蔇efinitely will tell everyone I know about this place and will be back!

Absolutely delicious! Went on a weekday night, there was a long line but it moves pretty fast. Service was excellent, there's a guy standing near the line that hands out menus, answers questions and makes recommendations. Since the line was extra long, he also started taking our orders so that we'd just have to pay when we get up to the front, and that way our food didn't take forever to come out. The only downside was the seating situation, it's all patio seating and there are some tables that you can sit down and some that require you to stand and eat. We were able to find a table that a couple let us share with them, otherwise we would have been stuck standing to eat. Luckily it was a warm summer night and I didn't mind the patio seating, however on a cold night I'd rather not sit outside. We ordered a mint milkshake, which was amazing. Fresh strawberry lemonade, it was decent. Cinnamon waffles, which were perfect. They were soft, not too sweet, not at all dry. Also got the chicken and waffle sandwich, pretty good. My friend also got the smores waffle and he loved it. We shared the Irish nachos, which i think was a special for the days. It's waffle fries with cheese, sour cream, onions and bacon (we got no bacon). They were very tasty, especially because they have a bunch of different hot sauces you can add to your food! Would definitely go back here!

The waffles sandwiches here are great! Service is always wonderful, and although their items are somewhat on the pricey side, it's so worth it if you haven't tried this place yet! My favorites from this place are these items: Savory side: Salmon Dill & Cream Cheese = Yum! Prosciutto and Gruyere (w/ a side of Siracha) = Yum! Bruxie Burger = just like a buger, but instead of the bun, 蕐ou have the waffle. Delish! Sweet Side: Strawberry Creme Brulee = I LOVE it! Very tasty and just the right amount of sweetness. Their Cane Sodas are wonderful as well. I also tried their Hot Chocolate and Frozen Custard, and it was a bit too thick for my liking. Other than that, I am never disappointed when I come to Bruxie

I understand why the line is always so long! The fried chicken sandwich blew me away. The crisp waffle itself it perfect for sandwiches. The chicken was juicy with an excellent crust, plus it was not a greasy piece of fast food junk that fills you with bloating and regret. 蔜he chili powder spiked honey & coleslaw bring everything together. 蔍t's almost like eating Kentucky fried boxed meal. My wife had the smoked salmon sandwich with dill cream cheese and cucumber. 蔜his was a huge surprise, you wouldn't think you could get a good fish sandwich at a place like this. I'm bummed that this went in after I moved away from Old Town!

BRUXIE...... Cannot say enough about this place. 蔍'm yelping on it now but have been going to this place for awhile. 蔕n my 1st visit, somehow Kelly (one of the owners) picked up on our conversation about my upcoming bday event and he asked us who's bday it was and when. 蔠e shook hands and he sat and talked with us for about 15 minutes as we were all eating our Bruxie waffle wiches. 蔜hen all of a sudden he got up left us and came back with a Bruxie waffle in his hands....said it was for my bday, early gift. 蔋e gave us the Fruit and Cream waffle on the house. 蔍 was literally in heaven. 蔜he waffle was just perfect...light and airy with a crispy crunch. 蔅efore we left, he told us to come back on Friday on my bday for a treat. 蔅ecuz of my 1st experience with Kelly, I've been supporting Bruxie on a weekly basis. 蔣ou will love the food and the service...everyone is so nice and quick to serve. �DON'T GET ME WROING....FOOD IS AMAZING. 蔅etween all of us, I think I've tried everything but the PB & J...only becuz I'm allergic to peanut butter, not peanut oil. �I know...go figure!!!! �Say hello to Kelly, he's the coolest cat in Orange!

Hey Bruxie! Who in the hell do you think you are??? Ever since Bruxie has moved into Old Town Orange, it seems like it has been hogging all the business and leaving the other surrounding eateries scrounging for customers. So again, I ask you Bruxie, who in the hell do you think you are? Let me tell you all a little about Bruxie. This tiny place used to be a hole in the wall burger joint that went under a few months back. Now it's a bustling little joint that only has about eight tables, which are all out doors, two small windows where you place and pick up your orders and a line of patrons that is usually five or six people deep. Bruxie's menu is made up of breakfast sandwiches, savory sandwiches and dessert sandwiches. What makes Bruxie stand out is that they use waffles instead of bread on their Sammie's. That's right, waffles instead of bread. I have been here two times now and I have tried a bunch of different things. These are the things I have ordered: Bruxie Burger- Angus patty topped with cheese, tomatoes, pickles, lettuce and mayo. I also added sliced avocado to my burger Buttermilk Fried Chicken- Buttermilk fried chicken topped with chili honey and coleslaw. I also added sliced avocado to this Sammie Prosciutto & Gruyere- Prosciutto topped with Gruyere, chives and whole grain 蕀ustard PB&J- Loads of creamy PB and black berry preserves S'mores- Belgian chocolate, graham crackers and toasted marshmallows Waffle Fries Liege Waffle- Topped with butter, powdered cinnamon sugar and Nutella. Egg Nog shake made with Wisconsin frozen custard Both the Bruxie burger and the Buttermilk Fried chicken sandwich were phenomenal. The burger was juicy, flavorful and cooked to medium rare perfection. The buttermilk fried chicken was juicy, tender and because of the chili honey it was both sweet and spicy. The Prosciutto and Gruyere was flavorful but needed a whole lot more meat and cheese. Every bite contained much more waffle than prosciutto and Gruyere.Their waffle fries are a bit bland. They definitely need some more seasoning on them. The two dessert Sammie's were both fantastic, especially the PB&J. The Liege waffle was light, fluffy and really sweet. Next time I want to try a PB&J made with Liege waffles.Their egg nog shake was the best egg nog shake I have ever had in my life. Because they are so busy, and because they make the waffles fresh when they are ordered, it can take a few minutes to get your food. All the young college kids who work here (Chapman University is across the street) are really friendly. The prices here may be a tad high for some folks but I never complain about high prices if the food is great, and Bruxie's food is indeed great. Bruxie is definitely unique and a must try if you are in the area. I just think they need to be a little nicer to the older joints in the area and stop hogging all the business.

Wasn't too thrilled about the chicken..but the Waffle was sooooo yummy!!! I like that it wasn't thick and overly doughlike....I def would come back and try something else....maybe a waffle burger!!??? I hate that this location doesn't have a sit down, because on rainy or cold days, it's not gonna happen for me. Orange is a little far from south county, but worth the drive. I wish they would get a second location...but then I would probably overdose on waffles!

See what happens when your yelp friends finally write their yelp reviews. You read, UFC, compliment and then GO! Who would not get excited about a Fried Chicken and Waffle Sandwich. What a genius idea! Sadly though, the FC&WS fell short in the flavor department. Even with the added maple syrup, it was very bland. The cole slaw was bland and there was not enough of it to add anything to the sandwich. I could see the glistening of the syrup and could feel the stickiness but I didn't taste it much. The chicken was tender and juicy but there was a seasoning in the breading 蕋hat I did not like at all and actually made it not appealing to eat. Towards the end I left off the chicken and just ate the waffle. The Cheeseburger Waffle Sandwich was the one I expected the least from but stole the spotlight at this meal. Somehow the waffle as a "bun" worked. At first it was odd but it was really really good and I had no problem finishing my half. The meat was a juicy medium and the classic toppings (lettuce, tomato, pickle, mayo) worked. I would totally order this one again. The waffles themselves were very good. Made to order they were light, airy, crispy and had good buttermilk flavor. Their waffle fries were also really good and seasoned just right with salt and pepper. We didn't get any of their sweet waffles as we had dessert plans elsewhere but as you can see from the review below this one we should have had dessert here. Jars of nutella lined the shelves inside. And the PB&J waffle is now calling my name. According to the gal out front greeting everyone their Hot Chocolate is the talk of the town. They also have floats, shakes and frozen custard. If you like Root Beer then I would recommend skipping it from here. At first sip both Isabel and I were like umm this is gross. It was bad to the point of I wanted to ask to switch it for a coke but the cup is so big I felt bad wasting all that sodie. I took a peak at the menu and it said all sodas are pure cane sugar sodies so that may have had something to do with the odd taste of this root beer. Dining at this little road stand is outside only. Perfect for a hot summer day or sunny day in spring but not so good on a "finally its chilly" December night. Street parking was plentiful and there was not a meter in site. Being from El Lay we snagged the first free street spot we saw. We ended up parking a block away which was not bad but in turn arrive at our destination seeing their own parking lot! We thought, Man the city of Orange has it made with parking! No do you validate or leave your keys with the valet in this town. Actually, Leave those quarters at home! Excited to return for some sweet waffles and this talk of the town hot chocolate.

Food Taste: 5 Stars Food Portion: 5 Stars Service: 5 Stars Location: 5 Stars Cleanliness & Atmosphere: 4 Stars Price: 4 Stars Best thing ever happened in my life...was Bruxie! Now, I don't want to get anyone too hype for it and say it sucked just because of the high expectations. Just stop reading the reviews and just go eat here...nothing can possibly go wrong with this decision. Just a little warning...the lines can get long (30 minutes approx. maybe an hour during the peak lunch time), but once you order..it comes to you quick...possibly in 5-10 minutes during peak times. Service is great. One time the line was past the 2nd house from the restaurant and the waitress came by to pass out menus, and answer any questions you have and served water while waiting in line. Food comes out fast! My favorites are the seasonal pastrami sandwich and the strawberry creme brulee and are both must try. Chicken and waffle is really good but I like the pastrami sandwich way more. OH and strawberry lemonade...YuMMmMm. Enough said. Just go!

Quick eatery next to the Chapman campus. I got the prosciutto and gruyere and also tried the pulled pork the first time i came here. The prosciutto and gruyere is super bomb/flavorful, the waffels are super bomb and fluffy. The pulled pork was w.e but the service was nice as I came here with my gf who got the fried chicken at first but since everything fried is done so in peanut oil and shes allergic to peanuts, they apologized and gave us the pulled pork with a free salad. If youre not allergic to peanuts though the fried chicken is pretty bomb too. All and all if youre in the area try this place, its bomb and quick.

This was my first time coming to this place. i wanted to try something new so i just decided to go and by golly it was worth the drive :) evironment/surrounding: near chapman university so the surrounding is very peaceful. nothing to busy. kinda peaceful and calm. sitting wise was not that bad.. its more of a first come first server for the tables. so if you happen to arrive at a wrong time you either have an option of waiting for an open table. sitting in your car to eat or standing. food: it was worth the wait and price. got the beef rib and omg it was amazing just because it was the first and only waffle sandwich i ever got XD. it was so good i am willing to drive all the way there again to get another sandwich. i really want to try all other things they have. both my friends got the smore and dried tomato. the smores just tasted like melted chocolate and marshmallow whip on a waffle. the sun dried tomoato one tasted kinda nasty XD they have desserts too but only frozen custard and if you count sweets as one then yes they have that too service: 蕎as very friendly. no rush or anything. once you order you can sit or just wait around talking to your friends. once your order is made they just call out your name that you gave and they will bring it to you. overall i would say that this is well worth the drive for me. i would recommend this to all of my friends who are willing to drive there cause i mean its close to westfield main place. so eat then walk around in the mall

In a list of top 5 greatest inventions in mankind's history, waffle sandwiches should be #3, just barely beating out pogs and the Internet. You really can't go wrong with it. I mean, it's basically wrapping a waffle around ANYTHING YOU WANT. This practically sells itself. I usually get the Fried Chicken waffle sandwich and it doesn't disappoint, unlike me, which my father reminds me of repeatedly...but that's another story. They also seem to have a lot of different shakes and drinks. I see a lot of people get the orange creamsicle one. I've never gotten it because I'm too cheap but it looks delicious. Anyhoo, the food is great but the downside is the parking situation is terrible. There aren't a lot of seats either and there are no bathrooms. It is Orange Circle so I suppose these are a given. TL;DR - Waffle. Sandwiches.

I never knew waffle sandwiches came in so much variations. Whether sweet or savory, Bruxie hits the spot every time. Although I've been here a few times, I highly recommend the classic reuben sandwich as the combination of chewiness of the corned beef and the cheesiness of the cheese is perfect. The fries are not too bad, either. Whenever I am in the area, I always stop by Bruxie. How can I resist?

buttermilk fried chicken and waffle with real maple syrup s'mores waffle merely the thought of waffles induces my pancreas to secrete additional doses of insulin and preps the liver to store the excess carbs but alas, all that preparation should've been saved for another time. perhaps my high expectations of the crispy yet chewy interior with pockets designed to hold sauce compacted so well in place created an inevitable folly that yes, ideas created in the mind often don't meet those encountered in the physical realm. it pains to give 3 stars.

3.5 Stars. Decided to round up instead of down, because it's the nicer thing to do. I'm probably the only one in this world who thinks that Bruxie is overrated. My friends love it here, and it's good, but everytime I go, I lose a bit of my appetite just because the wait is so long. And I wonder if its really the food that is amazing or the trend or concept that people flock to. It's really not worth the wait and the drive for me (from the South Bay area), so I only come here when my friends are absolutely craving it. The food is good, but there's nothing so overwhelmingly yummy that I can't live without. I've tried the mushroom/arugula, green eggs and ham, pulled pork, and the bruxie burger. Although I've only tried a couple bites of the green eggs and ham (friend's), I think that it's the tastiest (green = pesto). Waffle fries are good. I guess the plus side is that although the wait to order is long, service is great and fast.

The gf and i were brought here by a friend a few days for the first time by a friend. Had the pb&j sammich on his recommendation and a mint chocolate shake. Both were excellent. Yummy gooey peanut butter and boysenberry jam in a crunchy yet soft delicious waffle. The shake was a mint chocolate shake - lots of fudgey goodness. I had never heard of this place or the whole waffle sandwich thing - great idea :) If I lived in the area I'd probably be by more.

I love waffles! So I just HAD to try this place. Service: Great! The servers were very friendly, helpful and quick. Location: Located in old town orange, so it can be pretty busy on the weekends. This place only has outdoor seating and depending on the turnover, might be a wait to get a table. Not an ideal place to eat if it's hot outside (like the day I went!) Waffle sandwiches: I have tried the Bruxie burger, chicken waffle and the smoked salmon with dill. The bruxie burger was just okay, I thought it was lacking flavor a bit. The chicken waffle was also okay, nothing extraordinary. The smoked salmon with dill was pretty good, despite not being a fan of smoked salmon. To be fair, when I tried the bruxie burger and the chicken waffle, we took it to go, since it was a hot day and we didn't feel like eating outdoors. Because of this, the food wasn't as warm; it probably would have tasted better nice and fresh. Dessert waffles: I was much more impressed with these!! I have tried the smores and the nutella & bananas. Both were delicious!! I wish I could have tried all of them; they must ALL be delicious! I look forward to going back for more :) The strawberry shake was also great! All in all, my experience at Bruxie was great. While I wasn't too impressed with sandwich waffles, the dessert waffles, shake and service really made up for it. I would definitely go back for more dessert waffles!

Let's kick off 2011, with a new set of reviews! Been holding out on the writing until we made things official. Bruxie is one of those new spots that just recently popped up about 7 weeks ago (you heard correctly). I've cooked something similar in college (not taking away any credit) but never did I think this type of food would be popular. I pretty much took 40 minutes out of my day to try this place in my roaming grounds of the Orange Circle. Unfortunately, unless you're local or Chapman bound it isn't worth while parading around the place to find parking during the lunch hour. So come around early morning or late afternoon for more convenience. Tried the following: -1 order of the Bruxie Short-rib Waffle Sandwich w/ Horseradish fries and a sauce on the side -1 order of the Bruxie Smores Sandwich containing bits of graham cracker, marshmallow and chocolate I've had the same feelings about these belgian waffle sandwiches as I do with crepes. It works fine for dessert but not so much for savory. Granted the rib was nicely moist. The horseradish potatoes, hardly tasted the flavor. The sauce on the side served as a nice ju but it would have ruined the 'airy-crispiness' of the waffle which is probably the main highlight of this place. The smores were perfect for this combination. In fact if any of my friends were generous enough to provide me seconds or thirds to this in the near future I would happily accept. The balance of the chocolate and marshmallow flavors with the hints of graham cracker, gave my tasting a nice finish. Customer service was friendly, but the prices were somewhat steep. Spending about $15.00 with tax and no tip. For these gourmet sandwiches, I'm kind of on the wayside as to whether or not it's worth it. Perhaps it's my own biased palate and the fact that it took so long to find parking on a nice winter day that made the experience bittersweet. Needless to say, 3 stars is all you'll get from me until I try the rest of the menu. Cheers.

I went with some friends on a rainy weekday so there wasn't a wait at all. FOOD: Fried Chicken Waffle without syrup - It was pretty good, but when I think of fried chicken, I think of spicy/cajun flavors. I would definite try it again, but with syrup. It wasn't very filling at all, I could have ate two of them in one sitting. Braised Rib Waffle - This tasted more wholesome, but it still wasn't very filling. The meat was tender, but it just didn't feel like it belonged with a waffle. Waffle Fries - Basic waffle fries, nothing special about them. Lemon Cream and Berries - A must try if you've never had it before. It was a good mixture of lemon cream and strawberries, light and creamy. SERVICE: They had a very attentive waitress who did a good job of checking up on us. If I go back, it'll be for the dessert waffles.

Waffles! Waffles! Waffles!!! I found this place after a fellow Yelper reviewed it! 蔍 was so glad to be in the area and able to try this place. �We ordered the nacho waffle fries (waffle fries, creamy cheese, sour cream and chives) to share. Heaven! I ordered the mushroom and goat cheese waffle sandwich (waffle, portobello mushrooms, goat cheese spread, arugula, and a balsamic reduction). SOOOOOOOO delicious!!! 蔜he hubby ordered the waffle burger (waffle, burger, lettuce, tomato, cheese, and mayo). I thought that the overall sandwich was going to be sweet because of the waffle, but it was acutally not sweet at all and complemented the sandwich perfectly. 蔍t felt lighter than eating it on sourdough or wheat bread. 蔔ow if they made a wheat based waffle then we would be going somewhere! They also offered different waffle sandwich desserts like PBJ, nutella/banana, and creme/berries. 蔜hey also have other desserts like creme brulee and ice cream sundaes.

DELICIOUS WAFFLE SANDWICH and GREAT SERVICE! I ordered the buttermilk fried chicken and like everyone else says it is very tasty. The waffle was slightly crispy on the outside but soft in the inside that absorbed the chili honey that was drizzled over the chicken. The chicken was fried to perfection: crisp and juicy and full of flavor from the herbs. The waffle fries was good but one can just get that at Chick-fil-A. I also loved the Bacon, Egg, and Cheddar that my friend ordered. Their homemade soda was average and sweet but not anything special. But what I like the most is that all the containers (trays, cups, etc.) are eco-friendly and biodegradable, making people like me not as guilty when ordering take-out. But besides the food, Bruxie has REALLY great service. The staffs are super friendly, passing out menus and water to people waiting in line under the hot sun. Also, the place really speeds up the service by writing your orders while in line and giving you the order form. You just pay at the counter and you get your order pretty quickly. However, I was most impressed when one employee offered to help carry my food back to my car, because I did order two bags full and had two drinks in my hand. Definitely will come back Bruxie to try their sweets!! TIPS: Ask for extra coleslaw if you order the chicken togo because they only fill up a small plastic cup full to be added on later. Make sure you read all those parking signs and their small fine prints, because parking can get pretty hectic around the residential/college area.

I enjoy waffles so the idea of using it as sandwich bread intrigued me. A group of us decided to give it a try. It was a Tuesday night and the people came in waves. All seating/standing tables are outside and limited. I had the Prosciutto and Gruyere waffle sandwich off of the savory menu and split a Nutella and Bananas (plus sweet creme) waffle off of the sweet menu. Both are classic combinations and the food didn't disappoint. The whole grain mustard was an excellent spread on the P&G so it wasn't too dry. The waffles were light enough so I could taste all the flavors and it was crisp enough to hold up to the wet ingredients. They also won bonus points with the black cherry soda special (One of my favorites as a child). I had bites of the other waffles the group ordered: Green Eggs and Ham (Ham, fried egg, cheese, and pesto) special and the Seasonal Creme Brulee. I would order either one the next time. You might find some trouble with parking because it's located in Old Towne Orange, but it's worth it!

I wasn't sure what to expect at first because I was like, "Does everything have a waffle? Can I get something without a waffle?" But after going there, I am totally hooked. The waffles are really light and they do a great job with all their different varieties. Great place to go breakfast, lunch, or dinner. If they were open late night, I would say late night too. Happy Eating!

Really really awesome. Had a pretty long wait to order, but the staff was out there to help us make our choice and answer any questions. Prices can add up quickly, but you can definitely get full pretty inexpensively. What we had: -Smoked salmon and dill cream cheese waffle -Bruxie burger -Waffle fries -Strawberry creme brulee waffle The waffles all had a lot of flavor and a flaky, crispy exterior. Only complaints are that the the inside of the waffles were a little undercooked, and there weren't quite enough fries to split an order between 2 people. The strawberry creme brulee waffle was really incredible and plenty to share when cut in half. It had little bits of caramelized sugar in the sauce--outstanding! I would recommend ordering a dessert waffle with the rest of your order and having them hold it until you're just about done with your entree. I have a feeling I'll be looking for excuses to go back soon again.

Came on a weekend for lunch to check out the place. It's a walk up "shack" just a few blocks off the Orange Circle. Basic concept is put things that would be normally be inside a sandwich/crepe inside a waffle instead. There was maybe a line 5-6 people deep when we got there. Food roundup: Prosciutto and gruyere: Moist and fluffly, not really crispy waffle, with melted cheese and cured meat inside, yum! I think there was a bit of 蕀ustard and chives for a fresh herb flavor, very nice. Fried chicken waffle: Big piece of moist chicken breast and coleslaw in between the waffle. The coleslaw had a nice textural and cooling contrast. I had to add a bit of hot sauce for some oomph. Chocolate shake: Very thick and delicious! I'm not a connoisseur but it was good, I can't have too much of this at one time, but the bf gobbled it up! Lowdown: They've got a very clever concept in the perfect area, near a college so you'll see lots of students getting a portable fix here. Wouldn't go too out of my way to come here, but still delicious and a nice different treat now and again!

If you can think of your favorite dish, Bruxie has created it and wrapped it up in a delicious gourmet waffle. Put it simply, I Love this joint. This small shack in the Orange Circle always seems to have a huge crowd of customers lining up around the block to get a taste of their newest creation which is definitely worth the wait. Ive tried their Bruxie Burger which always hits the spot for fellow burger lovers and myself. My new favorite is the Carolina BBQ pulled pork sandwich which is BBQ heaven for bbq lovers. As long as they have friendly staff and are open I will definitely continue to visit this place.

I expected way more from their infamous waffle fried chicken sandwich. Bookmarked this place early on when my bf and I started dating because he mentioned that he saw a huge line for this place down the street from his fave cupcakery about 7 months ago. I'm a fan of the Roscoe type Chicken and waffle joints, but I am not such a fan of eating the chicken on the waffle. I am more of a nibbler in rotation type of person, i.e., bite of chicken, bite of waffle, bite of chicken, bite of waffle... you get the jist. So, when I heard of this place, I was a little hesitant to try it but it worked out the other week to come and grab a bite. The service was great and the wait was not long at all... As for the sandwich.... the waffle was dry, airy and bland. If I had the waffle alone, I wouldn't be impressed at all. The chicken, was good (being that it was tender and all white meat) but bland as well. Honey chili (luckily we got it on the side) was okay... meh... and the coselaw was more of a shooter (small portion, and just plain). Waffle fries were the highlight, fresh and tasty. Maybe I am just a tough ass these days, but I wasn't impressed at all.... 2 stars for the sandwich. � stars for effort and originality. 4 stars for service. I changed it to 3 stars. the food wasn't bad, just not something I would get again or travel for in the future.

After reading so many fantastic reviews, I was SURE I was going to love Bruxie... I didn't. My boyfriend and I went for an earlier lunch and he ordered the Buttermilk Fried Chicken waffle with the waffle fries and i got the PB&J waffle because 1. I wasn't that hungry 2. PB&J is my favorite thing on the planet. Okay, so the chicken waffle was good.. but plain. 蔍 feel like it was lacking something in flavor. 蔍t needed to be sweeter, or spicier, or just something more than it was. 蔄lso, I felt that it wasn't that hot when it was given to us. 蔄lso, the waffle fries tasted just like the ones from Chick fila, nothing too special. �My waffle, the pb&j, was again good.. but not that great. 蔉irst of all, the waffle wasn't warm at all, it was room temperature, which I felt kind of ruined it. 蔜he strawberry jelly that was in it was good, but jelly usually is. 蔠hile I was eating it I was thinking to myself that it kind of tasted like something I could make at home, though i recognize that it wouldn't be QUITE as good at home, it would have been a lot cheaper than $6.00. �All in all, it was good, just not great. 蔍'm not really sure if I'll be back to give it a second chance though.

Just got back! After reading a friend's review(thanks, Amanda!)/having my boyfriend and his friends recommend it, I decided to give this place a shot! My boyfriend and I got the Green Eggs and Ham and the Albacore Tuna Melt--both seasonal favorites, with a side of fries. The GE&H was definitely the winner of the two. The cheese was melty, the ham was warm, and the pesto was a great compliment. The Belgian waffle is so crispy and not really sweet, which makes it perfect for bfast, lunch, or dinner. I'm curious about the other sandwiches and desserts. I hope to try them some day because they all sound pretty interesting! And their drinks! We both got water, but they have the options of fresh strawberry lemonade and all-canesugar sodas. The servers were so so nice! Constantly asking if we needed anything, or if anything flew away, they INSISTED on picking it up, even if you're already dodging for it. Super nice people! They all seem like they really want to get to know you. It's in a nice little area of Orange that seems really festive and cultural. There's even a cupcake shop down the street that was featured (and I think they won) Cupcake Wars on the Food Network! Need to check it out... Oh, and there aren't any bathrooms at Bruxie! Just FYI :)

Wow, what a concept!!!! Waffle sandwich?!! seriously people.. it works!!! excellent!! great!! awesome!!! certainly a highlight of our short weekend trip!! We were in LA area for a short time, just for a wedding weekend and we decided to sneak in a "culinary adventure" before we headed back to the bay area. I stumbled upon the raving reviews of Bruxie on Yelp and my bf, an avid sandwich-eater, jumped with joy full of excitements wanting to try the waffle sandwich at Bruxie. Just like others mentioned... parking was such a pain!!!! beyond ridiculous!! All the street parkings (streets behind Glassel St.) were marked as "permit only parking!" WTH!!! and there weren't empty lots because of graduations at Chapman U and seriously.. who want's to pay for parking that will cost you more than your meal at Bruxie?!! Don't tell on us, but after circling around for almost 30 minutes (yes, we were so eager to try Bruxie, we didn't give up!!) we decided to take our chance (risking $25-$30 parking ticket all for the sake of tasting Bruxie!) and parked at one of the streets behind Glassel. We ordered: Fried chicken Waffle Burger Waffle Waffle Fries Lemon Cream and Berry Waffle Special: dulche de leche shake I have no bad thing to say about all that we ate!! yes, we ate all those on the spot!! they were soooooooo goooooddd.. we were going to take some to go, but we decided to open the to go box and ate all of them!! My favorite was the fried chicken, it was crispy, juicy and had a bit of a spicy kick..yumm!! The bf loved the lemon cream with berry ..(he first was not too excited about it when I told him I wanted to order that!) I'm not usually a "shake" gal.. but this one is different!! yes, it's certainly special!! I loveeeee my shake!! Our total was about $30 .. but we were full and happy... even happier when we found no ticket on our windshield when we finished.. *wink! Tips: there was a line, long line, but it moves fast..so don't get discouraged! There were only a few tables to eat on site, but the turnovers are fast! The police does check for timer, so if you do park on the 30 minutes zone..make sure you really leave at a given time. And what we did re: parking.. is so not recommended..we got lucky.. beginner's luck!

Tried the Liege with nutella, the vanilla cream float, the Proscuitto, and a whole Buttermilk Fried Chicken waffle sandwich this time. 蔅ruxie still earns 5 stars from me. Liege was good, although I think I prefer the savory waffles from Bruxie -- Liege was a little -too- sweet for my tastebuds today. 蔉loat was AWESOME! Lovely taste to the soda, and the ice cream made it even better. The Proscuitto = DELISH; its flavors aren't as stark and strong as the Smoked Salmon's (maybe because of the gruyere vs. the dill cream cheese?), but it is just as fresh and has the same quality. 蔍 think these two sammies are tied for first in my heart. 蔠ith that said, I take back what I said initially about choosing the Buttermilk Fried Chicken over the Smoked Salmon. 蔜he chicken sammie was good but I got a little tired chewing on it haha. Also, I wish their waffle fries were bottomless.

Very different from what I think of chicken and waffles, but everything is worth a try. Located in Orange, this place is quite far from the hood, where chicken and waffles taste the best. I might be biased, having eaten awesome C&W in Atlanta, but this place isn't bad either. Totally different, Bruxie has its chicken and waffles in a sandwich form. No bones! That's a total plus. The plus side was that the waffle was great tasting and there was just enough seasoning on the chicken. I did find that the maple syrup was too sweet for my taste, even though I was pretty conservative in slathering it on my food. Also, I did miss having hot sauce on my fried chicken, which is due to being used to it. The portions were a little on the small side, but I guess I can't complain since it was like $6. What's cool about Bruxie though, is that you get that homey feeling. The staff is very welcoming and will ask you how your food tastes and even strike up a conversation with you in line. Their sodas are also pretty interesting. They make their own, so its all good with the cane sugary goodness. Definitely would come back, but watch out for that parking situation. It's definitely a pain.

Bookmarked this a long time ago and finally got to try it out! It's definitely crowded and "seating" is limited so find a table as soon as you can. While the line can be kind of long, the food comes out relatively quickly so you aren't waiting for long. I had the Bruxie Burger and the Smoked Salmon as well. The burger sounded odd on a waffle but it was actually very good. The smoked salmon was tasty as well but I think smoked salmon should really just be a finger sandwich that you have with your afternoon tea. I got tired of it after a couple of bites. The waffle itself is very good. The batter is light so it doesn't sit heavily in your stomach after you eat it. The outside is crisp and the inside is fluffy...mmmm...I could go for some now.. Next time I'll get a dessert waffle and see how those are :3

This was great! The line was long but we were able to snag a table! I brought my Valentine here to try the place out. 蔍 had the Bruxie burger and he had the egg, cheese & bacon (without mayo) but WITH syrup which he said was great! We tried the vanilla soda which was a little too sweet for me, I'm going to have to try root beer instead. 蔍 looked longingly at the shakes and sweet waffles but we have a big dinner planned tonight so I had to forgo. I will be back though! That s'mores is calling my name!

We heard about this place in a magazine and through friends. So when we had a day with no plans, we decided to drive up to Orange and check it out. 蔠e saw the menu online, turkey club, chicken salad, cheese burger, chicken and waffles. What I liked about the online menu, is that the items change daily, keeping the up with fresh, quality ingredients. So we waited in line, got a menu and debated about what to order. The Bruxie is in a parking lot, you wait on the street corner, move out of the way for cars, and eat in booths or on high bar tables in the parking lot. There are heaters, and a bar for condiments and utensils. the service is fast and friendly, and they give there food and drinks in earth-friendly materials. The chicken salad and turkey club were not on the menu, but were the specials. Did I mention they make homemade sodas, and milk shakes? So when we walked up to the window, I was told the chicken salad was not a sandwich, it was in fact a salad. But the guy suggested the mushroom. Everything but the chicken and avocado in a belgium waffle. Sold! �The tang of the perfectly sauteed mushrooms in a balsamic reduction, with the nutty arugula and creamy gruyere in a slightly sweet and crispy waffle was divine!!! My husband got the turkey club, fresh good high quality turkey, applewood smoked bacon, avocado, lettuce tomato. My one bite was perfect. Our friend got the cheeseburger, 蔣es, that too was in a belgium waffle, and our friend said his burger was great. Oh, if you're a diet coke person like my husband, I don't recommend it, but the cream soda, was good and nostalgic.

Belgian waffle, Brussells wafles, very good, nutella and powdered sugar in the right proportions, really hit the spot for my sweet tooth. just had a 蕇weet waffles - and they were light, perfectly golden, very delicious. 蔠alked down to the corner food stand that is Bruxie after having dinner at our daughter's and son in laws house in old town Orange. Very friendly, line wasn't too long - but it moves fast, they got the waffles out quickly. 蔐ots of space to stand and eat or sit and eat, or wander down the street to a park bench. My wife is from Liege Belgium and these waffles are her favorite now. I can't make them any where near as good as these, I've been fired as the waffle maker, off to Bruxie!

Awesome, smart little joint! Since my husband and I live walking distance to this place, we were getting anxious and excited as we started seeing the development process of Bruxie. I'm surprised I haven't already reviewed this place! But anyway, it is still poppin' some months later!! We've had the... (different visits, I promise!) Bacon, Egg, & Cheddar: Yummy! I love the sharp cheddar. And bacon is ALWAYS good. Procuitto & Gruyere: Good. Wish there was more procuitto, gruyere, chives, basically everything inside. But good anyway. Buttermilk Fried Chicken & Waffle: Yummy as well! Again, I wish there was more of the chili honey and cole slaw, but I'm a condiment person, maybe that's why. Bruxie Burger: Pretty good. My husband had this one and I just had a couple bites. Nothing out of this world, but good. Waffle Fries: Good. Not that special. Beef Short-Rib (special): Delicious. Can't exactly remember what was in it, but it was good! Old Fashioned 'Pure Cane Sugar' Soda (cola & lemon/lime): I couldn't really tell what was different about these... Seasonal California Strawberry Shake: Yummm! I love strawberries and there's a lot of fresh strawberries in this! Soft Serve Frozen Custard: Delightful! It's thick, creamy yumminess. Belgian Hot Chocolate: Rich and chocolatey. It was perfect on a chilly day. Since their opening, they've added tables, heating, and now a stand-up eating bar area. The people are friendly, the food is tasty, and all in all, it's a cool place to check out! It's one of those places where you go and then think to yourself, "why didn't I think of this!?" Smart! And like I said, STILL a happenin' place after months of being in business!! Definitely not good for a diet though. :P

It's times like these where I really wish I still lived within walking distance of the Circle... Because I think I'd pitch a tent at Bruxie until I tried their entire menu. FINALLY got around to trying it out today for some lunch. 蔍've been in love with the waffle concept since I visited the Waffle Window in Portland latst year. 蔍 tried the fried chicken and waffle first, and honestly, their waffles were DELISH. 蔜hey make a perfect sandwich! 蔜hey were sort of crispy, but also soft and sweet, and with the fried chicken (which was surprisingly higher quality chicken than I expected?), and the slaw and honey, I had no problems wolfing it down. �I decided I had to try the custard too, after some raves from some people we knew. 蔝m. 蔍 think 蔍 could live on that stuff. 蔍t's perfectly creamy...and the taste is amazing. The ONLY drawback is the seating sitch. 蔠e had a party of 5, and it made for tough times finding somewhere to enjoy all this deliciousness. 蔠e ultimately got a booth and squeezed our booties in there, but it would be more awesome if they set up a couple more lunch tables outside!

I went there Saturday with a friend. e decided to try the chicken and waffle sandwich. Yuck. Waffle soggy, 2 tiny pieces of cole slaw and okay chicken. I guess we made the wrong choice. It is NOT a Roscoes! Go there for your chicken and waffle. plus it's a dollar for a drink refill. I should have tried something else. The lines were long so something must be good but not my lunch.

What's all the hype about? Well, to each their own I guess. That's why we're all here writing our own reviews in the first place :) So I've been here twice now. I've been awarded to friendly customer service both times around. Good job to you Bruxie. Now the food. Maybe I was just so drawn in by the hype that I expected to be wowed. I was more like "It's alright". My first trip here I ordered the bacon, egg and cheddar. Plain and simple, no woo factor really. Second time around I went with the Smoked Salmon & Dill Cream Cheese. I couldn't imagine salmon, cream cheese, and waffles tasting good together but the combination actually worked out nicely. Still though, not enough to get excited for. I'm not saying Bruxie is bad, but I'm not saying it's great either. Waffle Sandwiches. It's an awesome concept, but they need a little more bark to go with their bite. Just saying.

You don't see these kinda shacks nowadays. �Loved how old school this place is. 蔇on't love that there's no place to sit. 蔊uess I can kick it old school and do it on top of my car. Had the infamous Fried chicken an waffle sandwich with maple syrup and waffle fries and adding on an old-fashion strawberry soda. Fried chicken sandwich was delicious! 蔄lthough the Cole Slaw was 蕇weet and sogging up my waffle. 蔅tw, the waffle is so light and fluffy! And buttery! The maple syrup was not overbearing at all which was a very nice condiment and a great break away from ketchup. �I LOVED dipping my waffle fries into the maple syrup. 蔍t was both a sweet and savory cross cut fry. A major plus is old-fashioned soda. 蔔obody keeps it old school like Bruxie.

Don't get me wrong--I still like Bruxie... But the at first "love" has become a mild "like," sadly. I have a few problems with the joint.. 1) The prices. I think Bruxie's prices are on the higher side for what they are serving you. I think you're paying for the "ambience," meaning, the eco-friendly plastic cups, the paper trays--all of which, may I mention, serve little purpose as Bruxie doesn't even have a recycle bin (last I checked, although this may have changed), and the presentation of the food... But the waffles themselves are on the plainer side, and I don't think you're getting as much as you should for your money. 2) Parking... All of the neighborhoods surrounding Bruxie are for those with permits. For the most part, that's okay, because the Orange Circle definitely offers other spots for parking, but if you're looking for a place you can get in&out of, Bruxie isn't it. 3) $1 soda refills... Really? Bruxie, I still like you, I just don't love you anymore..

Let's say #1 recommended is the Buttermilk Fried Chicken with extra Maple Syrup and a side of Waffle Fries. Bombdigity. The waffle had the consistency and crispiness of a Belgian waffle yet the moistness of a pancake once you took your first bite. The addition of a house slaw was a nice touch to tone down the saltiness of the fried chicken. The chicken itself is much more succulent than your typical chicken sandwich and it is smeared with a sweet house sauce that slightly resembles sweet and sour sauce from McDonalds. Dipped in the maple syrup, the sweetness definitely complimented the whole sandwich. I'm a big fan of Chick-fil-a's waffle fries, but this place took the cake. It was crispier and felt lighter at each bite. It was sprinkled with pepper and some sea salt i presume because it was quite a strong flavor. Definitely a great compliment to the entire ensemble. Simultaneously through these two parts of my meal, I wharfed down two cups of water. I was quiet for most of the meal. Other than that, a quiet moan when I bit into the sandwich. Side note: Seating is a bit difficult to find sometimes, depending what time you go. Parking is a bit difficult since it's a small corner shop plus with Chapman U literally across the street. They also can split your meal into two and service is on a first name basis. Also they have a doggie bowl there too so I'm assuming it's dog friendly!

Holy waffle burger! 蔠hen my buddy told me about this place called Bruxie with the concept of wrapping flavorful meat in waffles I was a bit curious with a side of pessimistic. But as always curiosity prevails so we ordered: Buttermilk Fried Chicken Waffle - Wow pretty good flavor combo. �Burger Waffle - This was thee best...soft patty..delicious texture and wow flavors!!! 蔍'll be back for two of these! Short Rib Waffle - Pretty darned flavorful but seemed to be missing something like a spread or something to bring another flavor besides salt. Waffle Fries - Prepared with care and cooked to perfection. 蔔o way to make this any better. Root Beer Float - Root Beer was nice with a decent bite to it. All in all this place was a pleasant surprise. 蔍 love going into something with no clue or reservation of how it's going to turn out. 蔜hen boom, such a great overall experience. Side note...the owner or head chef was great. 蔋e was there from the beginning to field questions, then during to ask how we were doing, then end to ask us what we thought. 蔄nyone that reads my reviews will know, I love it when an owner takes that much pride in their craft. 蔍t really shows in the product that Bruxie sends to the tables, then to your palate. GREAT!

I have a love/hate relationship with Bruxie. I love waffles and a gourmet waffle sandwich is about as perfect as it gets for me. However, I hate the fact that I didn't come up with this concept first. It's so simple, so obvious that we should have had this amazing food way before the last quarter of 2010. I have made a half dozen or so trips to Bruxie since it opened and I have tried nearly all of their offerings. While you will read plenty of reviews that tout the Bruxie burger of the buttermilk fried chicken & waffle creation I am here to tell you to not over look the special Bruxie of the day. They served up a braised short rib Bruxie last week that was obscenely good. Anytime you can score short ribs with bleu cheese for under $10 you have to get it. Wrap it in a waffle and you have something so itoxicatingly delicious that it should be banned for the euphoria it creates. Now don't get me wrong, I love all of the savory and sweet waffles that utilize the bold fold to create a unique treat. But, Bruxie will always be on a pedestal for me because they helped my beloved Orange County give the finger to the Travel Channel. Allow me the explain. I am one of those geeks who watches the Travel Channel with the remote in hand so I can hit the pause button when I see something amazing. I then launch Yelp on my iPhone and bookmark some decadent food in a remote place that I will probably never visit. One of my secret crushes is Samantha Brown who seems to have a new travel show every month. On one of her older shows she went to Brussels and ate these amazing street-side Belgium waffles filled with a pearled sugar. A few years later there was another Travel Channel show about extreme restaurants. One was this waffle shack in New England that was only accessible by skis. They served the same Belgium waffles with the caramelized pearl sugar. Now I was really ticked off because I don't ski yet I was being taunted by this waffle. Bruxie to the rescue with their Liege Waffle. This isn't the obvious dessert choice for most Bruxie customers and I won't tell you it's better than the Lemon Cream and Berries or the PB&J. The Liege Waffles is simple perfection where you get to appreciate the 蔵ngredients in their most basic form. You know how sometimes you get tired of the crazy things Ben & Jerry blend into their ice cream and you rediscover the perfection of a really good vanilla bean? That's why the Liege is amazing because it doesn't need a lot of frills to make it great.

This place is so delicious. I've been here 10+ times and the food is consistently good. Although I've tried many of their savory and sweet waffles, my favorite is the buttermilk fried chicken waffle. The way that the slaw and honey sauce compliments the fried chicken is magic. My favorite sweet waffle is the Liege with Belgian chocolate. Their waffles are always light, warm and airy. 蔍f you haven't been to Bruxie, give them a try.

I've had this place bookmarked for months and finally was able to get my grub on here! Cat T., her sister and I got there around noon on a Saturday and boy was it crowded! The line wasn't too long, but I could see we would have to fight for a table. We each ordered the fried chicken waffle with 2 orders of waffle fries and some sodas. We were disappointed the short rib was out! :( Must go back for that next time! Waffle was delightfully light and crispy on the outside. It wasn't heavy like typical belgian waffles. There was a good balance with the heavy fried chicken, cole slaw and honey. The chicken was a little dry for my taste. Also, some bites were a little too sweet for my taste, but overall, a good waffle sandwich. Waffle fries - really good! Salted to perfection in my opinion. Sodas made with sugar cane (got cola flavor) - it was different. Not sure if I like it because I'm a recovering Coke addict. What I didn't like about this place was staking out tables. We seriously had to hover around tables because people would snatch it from us if we weren't close enough to make our presence known that we were eyeing a particular table. I felt bad, but it had to be done. We couldn't eat the waffles standing and we certainly couldn't take it home. Oh the struggles we have to endure for good food! =p What I L-O-V-E-D about this place was the friendly service. EVERY single person I ran into there was super friendly and nice. Even though it's basically a food stand, they come around to ask how everything is and if we need anything else. THAT is impeccable service. I MUST come back for their short rib waffle AND dessert waffles. I missed out on the creme brulee that's a special this month!

Simple, savory & sweet! What more can you ask for? This little permanent stand is located on the corner of Pine and Glassell where it's full of college kids waitin' to get their hands on a waffle sandwich. They have their set menu of different savory and sweet waffle sandwiches, and then they have their ever-changing specials menu that is located on a chalk board plastered at the front. I overheard one of the staff members say that they only have a limited menu and changing specials due to the tiny space they occupy. This place sure is small! Be ready to eat standing up because there is a limited amount of tables available. It's also pretty packed here; you'll definitely see a line, but it goes by pretty quickly because they have an efficient ordering system. The one that I was able to try was today's special: Carolina BBQ pulled pork! It was deelish! I originally wanted the Buttermilk Fried Chicken, but after ordering it realized that they fry their products in 100% peanut oil, and I didn't want this meal to be my last! I also had their seasonal shake too: strawberry! Also super deelish since it's made with real muddled strawberries! Staff are also friendly and personable which makes the experience so much better!

Okay so... all the hype and reviews, I was excited to go. And yes it's a cool concept but I just don't dig the food as much as I wanted to. The chicken and waffles were disappointing, the chicken was good but the waffle was ok. Roscoes is better. The pastrami is ok, the burger is good but little meat. HIghlight **** Strawberry Creme Brulee****** OMG Orgasm in the mouth... lol but besides that everything else is just OK so far, not enough for me to come back unless I'm in the area.

Bruxie is located on the cafe/restaurant/goodies-filled street in old town Orange. It is a small, quaint stand with outdoor seating and windows to order from. The workers were insanely nice and pleasant. It also helped that the day I went was GORGEOUSly sunny and blue skies :). The wait for the food was long because there were a lot of people there. Finding seats took about 15-20 minutes, but we didn't mind because we were looking at all the cute dogs that were being taken out for walks and enjoying the nice, warm weather. My friends ordered the Bruxie Burger and the Butter Chicken Waffles. They were pretty darn good. Honestly, I think the Gypsy Den has better waffles (pancakes), but Bruxie's waffles are pretty good. I don't think they were cook thoroughly cuz they were more mushy on the inside. All-in-all, a great experience coming to Bruxie and will be back this weekend! (Then going to The Perfect Circle cupcake shop just down the street -- it was on Cupcake Wars on the Food Network!)

I'm so happy I finally got to try this place! I was a little leary about a waffle sandwich, but the waffle was cooked perfectly so it did have to same light softness of bread instead of tasting like microwavable eggos. I had the salmon and cream cheese sandwich ($7.95), and my friend had the reuben ($6.95). Both were really good, and the ingredients tasted fresh. The fries, however, were really salty. All the sandwiches are under $8. I can't wait to try the dessert sandwiches! The workers are also really friendly :) MAJOR TIP: I didn't know how small this place would be, so don't make the mistake of coming during lunch hour like I did. Nonetheless, service is fast, but parking is very tight and there aren't a lot of places to sit. Impressive, but I wish I had ordered the fried chicken or burger one like the manager suggested!

Where do I start??? I could just keep this short and say "Amazing!" but what fun would that be??? We ate here last Sunday morning and it was divine! We went overboard, of course as always, and got 3 waffles to split 2 ways. Let's start with the waffle, light and crunchy. It had shallow wells, where as I think of a Belgian waffle with deep wells for lots of whipped cream and syrup. I was wrong. Without degrading the quality and taste the waffle was very much an Egg-o but when you bite into it...a trillion times better. The first waffle we ate was the Fried Chicken sandwich. WOWZERS!!! The fried chicken was perfect; actually can it be better than perfect, if so, that's the word I'm looking for! The breading had a lot of oregano and pepper that added just the right amount of savory with a little kick. This divine chicken was topped with "cole slaw" which was more of just cabbage that added a very nice cool crunch to mediate the light spice of the fried chicken verses the sweet waffle. Of course we added the PURE MAPLE SYRUP. The owner told us it was "liquid gold". OMG...had to dip the rest of our waffles in the pure maple. Next I had the S'More Waffle. Chocolate, yup! Gram Cracker, YUP! FRESH MARSHMELLOW TOASTED TO PERFECTION...HECK YUP! I was just at a bonfire down in Newpers and had S'Mores, now I wish I had some Bruxie S'Mores...MORE S'Mores!!!! Finally we shared a Nutella and Banana Waffle. I love me some Nutella so this was a no brainer but the true surprise was the sweat cream. I would guess that they chopped up bananas are mixed them with this cream. It tasted like a banana cream pie on an awesome waffle with Nutella. Simple enough and simply amazing! Extra points are given on my review for Pete's coffee, great service (for a take out/outdoors eatery) and double bonus points for the chef/owner who was a super cool dude. He was walking around talking to his patrons, answering foodie questions and putting a smile behind an awesome product. If you are still contemplating eating here after this review, don't, you don't deserve an awesome meal and wont get how good this place is!

I'm on a mission to try every single item on the menu now. Heard about Bruxie through a friend from the OC, and now i'm mad that I do not live closer to here. Being from the LA area, it is about a 45 minute drive , but it's worth it! I try to fit in a meal before or after a Disneyland exercusion. It also helps that I have friends who live in Orange. I can make an excuse to "visit" them by forcing them to meet up with me here. Bruxie has many sweet and savory sandwhiches where the "bread" is replaced by a waffle. It is not too sweet and holds up well. It is not too dry or too soggy. They are also a bit thinner than your traditional Belgian waffle For my first experience, I bought both a bacon/egg/cheese and a strawberry creme brulee (side note, there is a seasonal menu posted above the order window that has menu items not shown on the website's menu). I thought they appeared small from the looks of what everyone else was eating, but i was wrong; they are very filling (keep that in mind). The Strawberry Creme Brulee blew my mind as the sandwich contained burnt sugar, vanilla creme and freshly cut strawberries (other places use a cop out with strawberry preserves). Dipping the bacon/egg/cheese waffle sandwich with syrup was like biting into an explosion of all of my favorite breakfast foods. It was like there was a party in mouth, and everyone at the party is getting it on. I definitely recommend this place if you're in the area. The prices are right. The lines can be long and there is very limited seating. I was almost expecting this to be a sit down restaurant (especially considering how the restaurants around downtown Orange are), but it is a corner stop. Staff is very friendly. Sodas are "home-made" with cane sugar (no corn syrup!), and milkshakes are made with custard, nom nom nom! I would also highly recommend asking about the ingredients on some of the sandwiches. Some of them have dressing (Mayo in the breakfast waffle or Slaw in the Fried Chicken) that aren't listed. Just double check in case you are sensitive to that sort of thing. Also, get the syrup for dip, it's worth it!

I really like this place, it is very homey. 蔍 tired the Bruxie Burger and I got a root beer float. 蔜he meet patty was really pink, I should have told them to cook it well done. 蔙aw hamburger meet = no good. The waffle was excellent aside from my raw patty, it was a very light and hearty waffle. Rootbeer float was good. I can't will be go back to try something worth paying for.

- Locale destination - A few blocks from Orange Circle. Right across street from the Chapman Univ. It's a stand - outside seating only. Packed with students who don't know anything about good foods. Expect a long waiting for the peak time - it won't worth it. The staff are friendly. - Gluttony expedition - Chicken waffle burger: Good quality chicken breast but it doesn't have a flavor at all... If you put a maple syrup (YOU HAVE TO ASK TO GET IT - otherwise they put only tiny amount of honey), yeah, it would be better than tasteless. But syrup doesn't help it in this case. I don't like it at all. They use good quality chicken and cooked well, but they totally killed it by not seasoning. I think they do need black chefs who know how to cook chicken right ;p Bruxie burger: They said patee would be medium but it was kinda pink. I'm scared of eating a raw burger.... Make sure to ask them to cook well!! Patee was a good quality but it doesn't have much flavor. They need to put some kind of sauce. Waffles are airy and a lot fluffier than ordinary ones. You taste butter, too. It makes a lighter burger than usual, though it doesn't mean better than usual ones. Ugh... I start hating a burger.. They got sweets - waffle with lemon creme & berries (My friend likes it), waffle pbj, frozen custard, sundaes, and floats! - Conqueror's deduction - They claim "Gourmet sandwich" - yeah, the prices are very much "Gourmet" but the outcome - not so much ;( $7 doesn't give you fries nor drink. $4.95 for shake?! Really?? They better put gold flakes in it, though gold tastes NOTHING ;p I can get changes at one of my Thai places with a lot better quality MEAL if I paid $5.... 蔍 really don't understand the hype at all. I'll be happier at Carl's Jr. for the less $ tag than this - I don't go those fast foods at all, FYI ;p Another overrated burger.... Nothing so special about the waffle burgers... Why? Why? What's wrong with well-cooked buns like "Bomburger" in HB????? Waffles don't go well with a burger, IMO.

After much awaited anticipation upon reading up on Bruxie in the AAA magazine (Westways) and then Yelping (of course), we found our way to Bruxie only to discover a ridiculously long line while driving by. We opted to eat elsewhere (found Two's Company after Yelping on my mobile while walking up and down Glassell St) and forgo the opportunity of waiting. After finishing at Two's Company, we decided to 'walk it off,' only to end up walking all the way back to Bruxie (which really isn't that far at all). Due to my sudden craving for a liege waffle, and also because I grew envious that my wife picked up dessert from The Perfect Circle, we ended up waiting in line for roughly half an hour on Sunday afternoon, well past the lunch hour, with about 20 or so people in front of us. Ridiculous. Then another 10-15 minutes for the liege waffle sundae and Belgian mocha. Was it worth it? I'm really not sure... I don't know if I'd wait 45 mins again for dessert. But I'm sure things would have been different if this were for a meal, because I'll scarf down almost anything when I'm hungry ;) Oh, one thing that my wife noticed, is one of the workers there, after pushing/compacting the trash down with his bare hands, proceeded to wait by the "pick up" window to grab peoples' food and hand it to them. We were hoping he would make use of the bottle of hand sanitizer by the window but no go. Sick! It didn't bother us too much because he didn't touch any of our food... hahaha! After getting the goods, we walked over to Chapman and found a bench to enjoy our desserts on. The liege waffle sundae, albeit aesthetically pleasing, was pretty overwhelming. It was definitely overloaded with whipped cream. Incredibly rich... too much in my opinion. Between my wife and I, we both felt like sick children suffering from I-ate-too-much-dessert-and-now-I-feel-disgusting syndrome. After a few bites, it got repetitive and I could barely taste the waffle. It just tasted like whipped cream, nuts, and ice cream. I don't think I would order this again. Next time I'm sticking with the original plan of trying *just* the liege waffle, among other things. We really enjoyed the Belgian mocha. It was really rich and perfect for a cold day. I wasn't anticipating such a long line. Even one of the workers there was a bit baffled: "It's been crazy like this for the past few days" - I'd venture to guess that most of the student-clientele there don't read Westways magazine. So unless it's the 'trendy' thing to do now, who knows. Seems this place has been around for a long-enough time to have already caused a Yelp-explosion. But that doesn't seem to be the case. Someone spilled the beans. Good for Bruxie at least! I do want to give them another try for the buttermilk chicken waffle, burger waffle, and the prosciutto waffle. But there is absolutely no way we're going back on a weekend and waiting 45 minutes for [essentially] fast food. I will be back. But I'm definitely not saying what day I plan on going back :P

Oh Bruxie. 蔜hank you for existing. I knew I would love this place. 蔇idn't think I'd love it this much. 蔎ust had it yesterday and I wish I lived a lot closer to Orange so I could go here more often. �Went with a friend who was sick so she didn't eat anything while she was there, but she was kind enough to offer to split half a buttermilk chicken and a pb&j waffle with me so I could try both, even though she didn't eat any of hers. 蔍 also ordered waffle fries and a Belgian mocha. Loved everything. 蔜oo much. 蔍 seriously had to eat slowly so as to not make her even more queasy and make myself look like a pig. 蔈ven though I felt like one as I stuffed waffle fry after waffle fry into my mouth. �Only complaint was that the bottom waffle on the buttermilk chicken waffle was a little soggy when we got it, but otherwise, the chicken was perfectly cooked and seasoned and oh so juicy. 蔜he slaw was great, just the right amount of sweetness. 蔜he waffle itself was just as described: light, crispy, not too sweet. The peanut butter and jelly (strawberry) waffle sandwich was perfect. 蔄gain, the waffle was light, crispy, not super sweet, and basically just the stuff dreams are made of. 蔉ull of win. �The fries were perfect, too. 蔔icely seasoned, very light, and didn't get soggy even though we were there for a while. 蔒mm... Can't wait to go here again. 蔙eally can't. 蔍 can see myself quickly becoming a regular. 蔝gh. 蔛o much for an "eating healthier" resolution.

Ah I finally get to review Bruxie. Any day can be made that much brighter with a waffle. How much more wonderful would it be filled with delicious sweet or savory yummies like bacon, fried chicken, or Nutella. Obviously rhetorical. We walked up to the adorable little window and placed our order. They have but a few tables which were all outside as there is no indoor dining area. Luckily, today was a beautiful, sunny but slightly chilly day. Ok. Ok,. Cuttin the bullsh!t. Here's what we got: fried chicken, bacon,egg and cheese, smores and fries, all waffle-ated of course. We even ordered their homemade cola. Oh and I got a frozen custard to go. The waffles are delicious on their own, light, unsweet, and crispy where they should be. My fried chicken was moist 蔭nd the batter was less greasy than other fried chicken I've had. It was a tad bit bland, but was made better with a drizzle of maple. 蔅acon, egg and cheese, well, can't go wrong with that. It's the ultimate breakfast sandwich. Waffle fries were deelish. Homemade cola sweetened with sugar cane? What? no HFCS? It was something in between coke and pepsi, but per my date who's a cola connoisseur, it was very good, but you can tell it's neither of the two. I wish I had room to try their slurry of specialty drinks but I wanted to save room for the custard, which, unfortunately had a very outspoken milk flavor to it, wasn't a huge fan but I ate most of it. �By the way, I liked how the owner would check on everyone, brought orders out, even if there technically is a pick up window. Overall, the biggest seller is the concept, and what can I say, I'm liking this concept. I'm ready for more waffle-ation. Bring it on.

After hearing all the reviews about it, I gave in and came here with my boyfriend while visiting the city for other non-related errands and we had already bookmarked this place on his GPS but never had the time to go. So we finally made time and came right before the rush hour. We ordered and our food came out within a few minutes. My boyfriend had the buttermilk fried chicken and I had the tuna melt. The tuna was really good and everything was not overpoweringly buttery or salty. It had just the right amount of cheese and veggies. We also shared a "dulce de leche" shake and it filled us up quick. I would come here again just to try out the other items on the menu but I do have to mention that it's a little pricey for a waffle sandwich and if you're a hungry man, one sandwich will probably not fill you up. Definitely worth the try though.

Located in Old Town, I was surprised to see a huge crowd of people spilling onto the sidewalk! I was expecting an actual establishment, but this was more like a food stand with outdoor seating. Parking: it's a pain in this area for sure and you'll have to circle around a few times to find street parking. The parking situation is even more compounded due to the fact that most of the streets surrounding main st are permit only. Food: The menu is just right, enough variation without being too overwhelming. All their options involve the famous Belgium waffles. I tried the prosciutto and Gruyere, which was really tasty in combination with the mustard and chives. The most popular one it seems like though is the fried chicken and waffles combination. The chicken was amazingly crispy and juicy! They also put a little bit of honey on their chicken, which is something I would prefer not to have cause I usually don't like my meats sweet and prefer them just savory. The waffles were the best part ... really airy and slightly crispy! I also sampled their custard, an egg based soft serve, which was so yummy! Super creamy! So, the patron filled sidewalk was definitely an indication of great food! A good find nestled in Old Town!

Okay, I like this place even better now since I've had the fried chicken waffle with cole slaw. Holy baby cheeses. 蔐ight, crispy waffle with fried, moist chicken with a chili spice, crunchy cole slaw and add maple syrup to the mix. It was savory with a little bit of sweet with some crunch. 蔍 just love textures and that was heavenly. Absolutely heavenly. Oh, and the root beer floats? 蔍'd say it was the best root beer float I've ever had.

If I were Maxim I would call this a hometown hottie! 蔒y hometown hottie, and yes I am in love. 蔋ipster food truck like exterior and concept, except Bruxie will stay put where I can see her at anytime. Savory and sweet menu with all the little frou frou extras like frozen custard and peets coffee. �I had the buttermilk fried chicken with waffle fries. 蔜he fried chicken was goooood. 蔙osemary and buttermilk, not greasy but juicy. 蔄nd I dont know what the hell people are talking about not liking the waffle. 蔍t has the perfect consistency, crunch and flavor- delicious on its own. 蔔o need to dress it with anything. 蔠affle fries are best Ive ever had. 蔖erfect crisp and unique savory seasoning, yum! Now on to the custard- out freaking standing. 蔍nstant flashback to living in upstate NY with my ex's Italian family eating nothing but pizza, lasagna, and desserts such as frozen custard. 蔇amn it was goooooood. And the staff was friendly and helpful and not in a kiss butt way. 蔛ervice was very refreshing and good. 蔜his is the way a small business should be, other old towne spots need to take note majorly! My new go to for fast comfort food.

Oozing an unassuming hip and retro vibe, the menu makes your mouth drool but makes your waistline want to run for the hills. 蔍 tried the arugula, mushroom and goat cheese waffle and it was a good combination of sweet and savory. 蔒y friend tried the chicken and waffles and that was good but I wasn't a fan of the coleslaw that came with it....I really believe coleslaw should be shredded. 蔍t was a quick, yummy bite that screamed all of the elements of comfort food, minus absentee shredded coleslaw :)

I had the lox sandwich. Salmon + cream cheese + dill = tasty Slices of cucumber = refreshing crunch Waffle = mine was over cooked - it was too crispy and hurt my mouth. The waffle fries are actually sort of like the Carl's Jr. criss-cut fries, with out the criss-cross pattern. 蔆hik-fil-A wins for waffle fries. Service was friendly, but in my opinion, the place is overpriced for what they offer. I'd prefer the homeyness of Roscoe's.

I've been nagging and bugging my boyfriend to accompany me to this awesome place. The fact that this place serves its sandwich fillings between a folded bed of waffles should be reason enough for a visit! It reminds me of a restaurant called Waffle Window I'd visited in Portland, OR during a recent trip. I was hungry....and there was a line! *SOB* But the owner was nice enough to come out and greet all of us and thank us for visiting his restaurant. He proved to be rather helpful in suggesting menu items to try. The Prosciutto & Gruyere Waffle sandwich: was out of this world. Prosciutto is good on practically anything...but between a fluffy, buttery waffle and gruyere cheese as a bonus? Oh my goodness, heavenly. Thank you, Bruxie, for inventing such a delicious combination. The criscross fries: are finger-lickin' delicious! I couldn't stop eating them and was sad when they were all gone :( The orange soda ice cream float: who woulda thought?! MUST TRY. Would have been even more perfect if I had this on a hot, summer day...or if this restaurant was indoors. Did I mention that we saw Howie Mandel walk by? (yes, the real one). But that's besides the point. I didn't really care for the Chicken and Waffles sandwich. Because this type of food is more hands on and the maple syrup is extra sticky, it proved to be a rather messy food to eat....and I didn't really think it was a good combination. The maple syrup overpowered the taste of the fried chicken. Note: they fry their foods in peanut oil. If you have peanut allergies, beware~ Next time, I will try their sweet waffles.

Finally tried Bruxie last night. Love the concept... taking an old, run down burger joint and giving it a makeover, fresh menu and packing in the excited locals! Every time I have gone by this place there is a line of people, even on a Wednesday night at 8pm. Waffles= good! I had the Buttermilk Fried Chicken waffle. Very tasty. The add-on combo of waffle fries is very small for an additional $2.00 and nothing special. I was definitely still hungry after my waffle so we split a Brussels waffle (butter, powdered and cinnamon sugar, maple syrup). The waffle was hot and delicious, tasted similar to a Churro. Maybe we were just really starving last night, but even after that we were both still hungry! The price and portions are definitely 'gourmet' but so it the quality and taste. Definitely a good place to grab a quick breakfast sandwich!

A friend of mine once suggested this place to me, and all I could think was "That does not sound appetizing. 蔍t sounds like a heart attack on a plate." 蔅oy, did I change my tune as soon as I took a bite out of Bruxie's crisp, yummy goodness. As other reviewers have stated, there was a line of people already waiting to order once I arrived. 蔖arking actually wasn't too bad for me, since the Orange Parking Enforcement has since re-zoned the area on Palm between Glassell and Olive as 30-minute parking. 蔕nce in line, a sweet lady brought me a menu, explained their best-sellers (since I was a newbie) and mentioned the specials. I was sad to find that they didn't have any more Irish nachos (at least the day I went), since so many people here talk about it, but I ended up ordering the buttermilk fried chicken and waffles (without the extra syrup) with a side of waffle fries and a mint chocolate shake to complete the meal. My food arrived quickly (less than 5 minutes), and for a bit I was standing around with no where to sit until this nice girl who had been next to me in line invited me to sit with her and her friend at a table. 蔜his place is pretty crowded and finding seating is a bit of a challenge if you go alone and can't have anyone scope out a seat for you ahead of time. Once I sat down, I readied myself and dug into the waffle fries. 蔛o yummy! 蔖refectly done and salted! 蔜hen came the chicken and waffle. 蔍 ate it like a sandwich since it didn't come with a fork/knife. 蔍t was sizeable and warm. 蔜he chicken well breaded and cooked well (not dried out). 蔜he waffle itself was amazing. 蔐ight, crisp, not at all oily and heart-attack inducing like I thought it would be. 蔜he shake was good, filling, and tasty. 蔔ext time, I plan on trying their cane-sugar sodas though! I totally changed my mind about this place and will definitely be back. 蔍 plan on trying the smoked salmon next time! :)

Bruxie!!! Where have you been all my life?! 蔜his place is great. 蔆ute little food stand located in the center of Orange where there's a bunch of cute little shops and boutiques that have maintained their original building structures...feels like you've stepped back into time! Unfortunately the parking is difficult, with all of the adjacent streets needing permits and the lot only fitting about 3-4 cars, but circle around a few times and you can usually find a spot. The lines get long, but the staff is great, they move quickly and are very helpful. 蔜here's a bunch of savory waffle sandwiches as well as the sweet. 蔍 got too excited and ordered like 3, but got so full after 1!! EVERYONE in line was ordering the fried chicken, so I got one of those, as well as the Bruxie burger, and the lemon and cream. 蔜hey also make their own sodas!! So good, I think they use cane sugar so the soda actually tastes fresher than normal sodas. They were alll delicious! My personal favorite is the fried chicken, the coleslaw on that thing is so yummy and the maple syrup adds a nice touch. 蔜he waffle fries are really crisp and good too. The burger was okayy.. tasted kinda funny on a waffle, but savory nonetheless, and yes, I highlyyy recommend the lemon and cream!!! The owner said its one of the popular ones and its got a delicious tangy and sweet contrast of flavors. My mouth is watering again... ahhhh.

Dang near anything you can order is great here. The staff is extremely helpful and EXCITED to talk about Bruxie's wonderful creations! You know how sometimes you might skimp on a soda to save money? DON'T DO THAT HERE. Their old fashioned cola is the best cola I've ever tasted. It has the right amount of pure cane sugar, burn and aftertaste. Someone give these guys some money to plant a Bruxie near every major University in the States. This place will blow up, it is delicious! Bruxie IPO? 蔖remature, but I'm just glad I don't live far away from this place. �FYI, THEIR OPENING ONE IN BREA!

All i can say is http://superyuminmytum.c� 蔍 heard about Bruxie through one of my friends check-in's on FB and i decided to click on the link. 蔄fter reading all the reviews I was dying to try it out. 蔛o since I was in the area yesterday I decided to make a pit stop before going to my superbowl party. 蔊ranted i knew I was about to go to an eating fesitivity, but thought who cares... Lets try this waffle contraption anyways. 蔠ell glad I did!! We ordered the creme brule waffle based on the reviews and it was pretty much on point! 蔐oved the sweet but not overly sweet taste and light crisp waffle. 蔍 definitely would come back and try possibly one of 蕋he shakes and the fried chicken waffle. �BTW, the owner was super nice while waiting in line he walked around said hi to everyon

Finally went yesterday after wanting to go since it opened. The line was long, but moved pretty quickly and employees were standing outside to talk to patrons, answer questions on the menu and give recommendations. Very nice touch! As for the food, it kind of like gourmet sandwiches. The waffle part is a bit of a gimmick, but the quality of the ingredients makes it worth it. My son had the buttermilk fried chicken waffle and raved about it. We sprung for the maple syrup and I know some people complain about having to spend $1.00 for it, but it's REAL maple syrup folks. My daughter, who is almost 4 and a little picky, got the Cheesy Bruxie and ate the entire thing. It's made with really good quality cheese, I stole a nibble and it's really good. I had the roasted mushroom with goat cheese and sprung for the sun-dried tomatoes. It was super tasty. The waffles aren't standard breakfast waffles. They make them lighter and fluffier in the inside and crispier on the outside. It was kind of like having a sandwich on toasted bread. They serve shakes that look ridiculously good, homemade lemonade that my kids loved and Peet's coffee. Did it change my life? No. Would I drive hours just to eat there? No. Will I share the experience with other friends and family when in the neighborhood? Yes. Definitely worth a try.

I had wanted to stop by Bruxie ever since since I saw this pop up on Yelp.. �Waffle sandwiches...I have been slabbing peanut butter between two eggos for as long as I could remember, in other words... sign me up. On a rare day off from the grind, I came here with my lady. 蔍 had the prosciutto and gruyere cheese, I thought...How could this not be great? 蔍 was soooo disappointed. 蔍t lacked many things, no punch, no big flavor. 蔍 thought it was rather bland. �My lady had the fried chicken and waffle. 蔜his was significantly better than mine! The chicken was cooked well, decent flavor, nothing to write home to mom about.. �We both shared the fries which I thought was a waste...they were just fries, simply put...just plain fries...I was hoping for a savory waffle fry-strip to some degree, but sadly no. If the waffle is supposed to be the star, which I would assume, honestly I didn't think it was any better than pouring my own waffle badder in a waffle maker at a hotel breakfast bar. Sub-Par at best. In ending, Bruxie was a miss. 蔍'll come back for the novelty, try a dessert waffle or two but I wont be buying a t-shirt any time soon.

Genius! This place seems to amaze me because I haven't been to a waffle place like this. It's really interesting and how they used the waffle instead of your regular sandwich and still be able to taste great. It's a small little place where they are people waiting for this place and there aren't that many seats but it's a nice place to kinda just chill. I went there with my bro and my friend and we tried 5 different kind of waffles combo. -Fried chicken and waffle: It was a bit disappointing but it was still quite delicious. I think it was disappointing because I find it dry after the delicious pull pork waffle. There was a nice little sauce that went with the fried chicken but it just didnt blow my mind. -Mushroom with goatcheese : this waffle was the one that really surprised me because I dislike goat cheese but the juicy mushroom and the goat cheese worked so well together that I had nothing to complain about. It was plain delish! :) - Smoked Salmon: This one was pretty good because the waffle was really crunchy still because there isn't really thing that is liquidy that makes it soggy. There is cucumber, cream cheese, smoked salmon and I think there was more but I dont remember. It wasn't my favorite one. - Burger Waffle: This one was a plain surprised to me because the patty and the cheese was so delicious. I didn't expect much from this one but Bruxie surprised me once again. The patty was cooked just right and I loved it. I think this one was worth trying -BBQ pulled pork sandwich : MMMMMMMMMM!!!! This one was the most delicious one outta the five...I think this was the reason why I wasn't impressed with the fried chicken and waffle because I ate this one right before I tried that one. The pulled pork was so juicy and there was plenty of nice bbq sauce inside...It was a really nice waffle. It's on the special menu but if you see it GET IT!!!!!!!!!!!

I don't know what to say besides: Yay! I'm a fan! I've been here twice and ordered the Prosciutto and Gruyere both times. So delicious! The waffles are made to perfection, soft with a nice crunch- not soggy or heavy! I've had bites of other sandwiches here but the Prosciutto &Gruyere is my fave. It's got a salty tang that hits the spot. For $6.95 I'm satisfied, but if you've got a pretty big appetite you might want to grab a side of waffle fries. The parking lot blows, but there's plenty of street parking. It's right across the street from Chapman University and the surrounding "downtown" area is ridiculously cute. The Strawberry Shake isn't bad either, if you can finish it before it melts- I couldn't and didn't care for the leftover sludge, sharing is caring- especially at $4.95 a pop!

Waffles Sandwich! I been wanting to try it for the longest time and I finally did. I got the Buttermilk fried chicken (comes with chili honey & cole slaw) savor waffle with maple syrup to dip. 蔄dd waffle fries to the combo for only .50cents! My boyfriend got the "seasonal special" braised short ribs (comes with caramelized onions & some kind of sauce). sounds good?? IT IS GOOD!! This place is definitely not a hype. It is amazing. They have two categories for their waffles: Savor & Sweet. Waffles are at the right consistency, leaving you wanting more after you're finished. Their prices aren't that bad. They keep the low prices to cover the parking ticket you might get from parking! There is not a lot of parking. You have to go around the block looking to park on side walks. The only complaint I have are the amount of seats they have. They need to get more seats. It gets crowded and you have to wait for seats. People are like animals attacking the tables when you're not even done eating yet asking can they have the table when you're done...standing there staring at you eat...til you're finished, but other then that It's located in Old Towne so you know- nice people, lovely neighborhood. Will come back soon!

I had this place twice and each time was exceptional. The thing that won me over was the waffle itself, considering the fact that it had an extra crispy feel to it. Cons: The wait is a little long and they need way more seating around the area. Their seasonal sweet waffle (mine had strawberries) was way too sweet for me, but I still had the mentality to finish it because of the waffle. Another slight con is parking, because you'd have to keep a lookout since there's no parking lot. Pros: Their savory items are pretty delicious, I had a cheese waffle and it had its similarities to a grilled cheese sandwich but still much better. Another pro is their mist contraption around the building, to keep customers cooled down from the crazy heat. �Overall (and so far), I've enjoyed Bruxie's, I have yet to try their better servings!

Loved everything we ordered: 1) Fruit & Cream Layered with Sweet Cream and Strawberries 2) Green Eggs and Ham (eggs, ham, pesto) 3) Buttermilk Fried Chicken & Waffle with Chili Honey and Cole Slaw and pure maple syrup dip 4)Bacon, Egg & Cheddar (Tillamook Cheddar, Mayo and Applewood Smoked Bacon) My favorite had to be the Green Eggs and Ham. 蔍 love pesto! �But everything was really delicious! The only reason for 4 stars.....it's only outside seating and there's only a few amount of sit-down tables. 蔜hey have tables and counters you can stand and eat at but only a few tables with chairs. 蔣ou pretty much have to eye someone's table like a hawk and swoop in as soon as they get up.

I was worried that Bruxie would not live up to their reputation. 蔋owever, after trying their Strawberry Creme Brulee Waffle, I will always remain a true fan of this creative and interesting food phenomenon. The first bite of my seasonal waffle transported me back to the deliciousness of the strawberry croissants sold at Cream Pan in Tustin. 蔋owever, this version was warm and coated with brown sugar goodness. 蔜he waffle was light and crispy but was falling apart as I was taking my last few bites. �I am definitely a fan and I can't wait to go back and try the other savory waffles!

Culinary creativity. The waffle sandwich itself is a unique idea, not a cheap experience by any means. Quality ingredients, flavor with depth, crisp light waffle complements the recipes well. I tried three, each were unique and delicious. The shakes are alright but not the main draw here. The owner personally came out to greet the long line of customers and answer their questions about the menu. Bruxie is a tiny place situated kitty-corner to Chapman U. with a private lot that's extremely small, so street parking is a must. There's also little seating. But all of these things are worth it.

If I was forced to pick my last breakfast on earth, it would be the Belgium waffle. 蔍t is one of my favorite breakfast meals! 蔛o I'm in the area, we drive by and notice a line outside a small booth with the headline 'Gourmet Waffle Sandwiches'. 蔍 would be a fool to not stop by and inquire what the hype is all about.

I made the trek all the way from San Gabriel to the OC with my gf for this and my oh my was it worth it. When we got there the line was fairly short which was quite lucky because the line became ridiculous once we sat down and got our food. Despite the line, the food still comes out fairly quickly and the waiters constantly do sweeps to pick up trash or see if you need anything. The crowd is fairly young and hipster-esque and is down the street from Chapman Law School. There is a limited number of seats in and around the parking lot so don't always count on finding a seat right away. We both got the buttermilk fried chicken and I got the pastrami which is a seasonal special. I wanted to try the smores but I decided on the pastrami instead. I had the buttermilk fried chicken first and as a bit of advice, spend the extra $1 for the syrup. It's amazing! It's almost like the fried chicken was meant to be eaten with the syrup. The 蕎affle was light and sweet and along with the fried chicken it was sweet and salty but the flavors were never too conflicting. The pastrami I had was a pleasant surprise. Unlike the simple taste of the buttermilk fried chicken, the pastrami is a smorgasbord of flavors which all blend together and somehow just works. The pastrami is salty and delicious and the juices soak into the waffle. Simply amazing. Despite the drive, I still hope to come back soon.

Bruxie definitely lives up to the hype. I'm usually not a big waffle fan, but these were delicious! I had no issue with parking or wait, but I came on a rainy day. There was a covered canopy so people could still sit outside. The price is quite reasonable. We got a chicken sandwich, smores, and a drink for under $15. The chicken sandwich was delicious, very comparable to Roscoes. The flavors work well together and make magic in our mouth. The smores were really good, but be ready for some sugar, its very sweet. If you aren't up for that much sugar, you're probably better off with a regular sandwich or waffles. My nephew who barely eats ate his entire order of waffles and half his sisters. That speaks for itself.

Bruxie, eh...A place that specializes in waffles? I am so there! I am really into waffles, maybe a little too much (see other reviews), so when I heard about Bruxie, naturally I was excited. I left feeling satisfied, but a little disappointed after all of the hype surrounding it. Closer to 3 1/2 stars, It is an interesting and unique take on what a dining experience should be. I think I just like waffles too much to really give Bruxie a higher rating than 3 stars. If it wasn't a little out of the way, tucked in a corner near the Orange Circle, with very little in the way of parking, I might say give it a try and see for your self.

I've been hearing people talk about how great Bruxie is and was finally able to check it out over the weekend. AMAZING!!! The whole experience was positive, including the "waiting in line" part. 蔜he line moved fairly quickly and gave me enough time to look over the menu, which EVERY ITEM looked so appealing. The service was great. It speaks volumes when you have patrons who have been coming regularly since Bruxie opened few months ago. If it's your first visit, It's good to share!! 蔠e shared the specials: Green Eggs and Ham and the Wild Mushroom and Arugula. Both were amazingly delicious. The house-made pesto on the Green Eggs and Ham was very fresh, which created an amazing kick to the sandwich. I loved how well cooked and marinated the Wild Mushrooms were, very tasty! I absolutely enjoyed the soft and crisp waffle texture (I think I can eat those plain and be very satisfied)!! The waffle fries were good and, to end the meal, we got the Nutella and Bananna desert.... yuuummm. Bruxie provides remarkably tasty gourmet, yet comfort-style food, and a wonderful experience. The prices are very affordable that you can come back and try everything on the menu and not break the bank!!

Been here twice and I just can't get enough! 蔜he 1st time, I had their salmon, which I didn't realize would be a cold sandwich, cuz I was hoping for a hot one! 蔜his last time, I got their specialty pulled pork and that was perfect! 蔍 also tried a freind's prosciutto & gruyere and original chicken & waffles and both were delish. If you only have time to try one, I recommend getting the chick & waffles and coming back to try the others!

What. The. Hell. I wasn't quite sure what to expect, but so many great yelp reviews gave me a hankering to try this place. I definitely did NOT expect something so amazing. I don't know who opened this up, but they are the secret genius of our shyly hidden, secretive child concoctions we are all a little ashamed and a little defiantly proud of at the same time. Who among us didn't have that light bulb go off in their head and sandwich some chicken nuggets between eggo waffles? Who didn't throw the crackers away from their lunchables and wolf down bologna eggos? Well this brave soul dared to make his childhood dream a reality, and has given me the courage to start MY spaghetti sandwich store. Or at least entertain the idea. Who's with me?? The waffles here are amazing, they're like deep-fried Belgian sandwiches. Apparently Belgium has amazing waffles, amazing chocolate, and fun words (Bruxie). Checkbox on next summer's vacation. I bet all the kids there eat belgian chocolate sandwiches in belgian waffles and sing belgian songs. I had the prosciutto gruyere (my favorite!), the wild mushroom with goat cheese (delicious if you like goat cheese, and i do...i do.) I also had the waffle fries fried in peanut oil, which all things should be fried in, and the hamburger waffle sandwich, and a 10 million calorie eggnog shake with whipped cream. Delicious. Don't judge me. I think afterward my body went into seal-mode, which means cranking up the heat, inducing a pleasant food-comaish feeling and the desire for warm blankets and soft beds. This is commonly known as the time when our bodies store up fat for the winter. I will be back after I wake up from my hibernation.

Seriously, waffles as sandwiches. Seriously. I didn't think waffles could get much better than paired with chicken at Roscoe's but boy was I wrong... Basically this place rockssss! Best concept ever. The waffle they created is not sweet nor savory and is crisp and airy, the perfect canvas for waffle sandwiches. I've tried the fried chicken, wild mushroom and goat cheese, egg and cheese, prosciutto and gruyere and they were ALL fabulous. Favorites probably are the egg and mushroom one, but I was happy eating them all, glutton much? Anyways the dessert ones are delicious as well. I have yet to try a housemade soda, but I'm sure I will not be disappointed!

Not that into it. 蔍 will have to try it one more time just for dessert, but the burger one and the fried chicken ones were both entirely too bland for my taste. 蔍 honestly would be shocked if they actually use anything other than salt for seasoning. They can really do better, without too much extra cost. 蔜he waffles were a bit soggy for my tastes, especially the bottom portion the burger sits on. I'm thinking this is something you have to sit and eat right then and there, but even then, flavor wouldn't magically appear out of thin air. I hope when I go back to try the dessert ones, I will be more pleasantly surprised. Wish I could give more than 2 stars, but truly, for the cost... nuh uh. 蔍 expect some quality... and taste.

I made up my mind long ago never to superficially *heart* anything (OMG so cute), but Bruxie has led me astray. 蔠ithout a shadow of a doubt, I have indeed succumbed to joining the masses by "heart-ing" this place, so much that I've been enticed into more than 2 visits within the past 2 weeks, and several secret ones that I will decline to tell you about to protect the innocent. 蔛ay whaa?! But anyway, the brooding naysayer in me wants to proclaim crap like, "I got a waffle maker at home and make the same thing every other Sunday", and/or "having to swim the butterfly upstream through a sea of faux-hawked, (incoming vocab *cringe*) hipsters, who look like they need to be force-fed a hundred of these sandwiches" isn't my idea of a good time. 蔋owever, let's be realistic. 蔜here isn't anything particularly magical about Bruxie and their use of more upscale ingredients and flavor combos sandwiched between the crispiest, yet softest version of a starch you would normally associate with Egg-o (don't lie). Bruxie is all about the fact that they do well to fulfill the purest, simplest and most natural food cravings you could ever have (nutella and bananas, folks?), and be okay with admitting to yourself that it's just FUNNER to indulge in these cravings AL FRESCO at Bruxie, rather than futz around with your confounded waffle maker at home alone with your 18 cats. Overall, I loved the smoked salmon one and the nutella & banana will indeed provoke your moneyshot glance. The buttermilk fried chicken waffle is just asking to be ordered WELL DONE, if only to preserve texture. This one definitely calls for a dash of Srichacha hot sauce, and you must do your due-diligence to wrangle the lone condiment bottle away from the college boy who has proclaimed it to be his new best friend for the hour. 蔋owever, the BEST ONE so far is the BRUSSELS WAFFLE which is absolutely positively plain. 蔋ere, the waffle really just shines. 蔣ou like crunch on the outside, soft on the inside? 蔣ou like that satisfying feeling of cracking through the top of a creme brulee? 蔣ou like[1] the smell of napalm in the morning? 蔣ou'll LOVE the Brussels waffle.

Went to Bruxie's today - accused the owner of making me fat but he says I look great. 蔏udos to him! So I had the Prosciutto & Gruyere, Lemon Cream & Berries, and my fiancee tried the Egg, Cheddar & Bacon. 蔠e topped it off with the Belgian Chocolate Shake and the Soft Serve Custard. I have to say the Prosciutto & Greuyere is giving the Egg Cheddar Bacon waffle a run for it's money in being my fav. 蔜he Belgian Choco shake was phenomenal. 蔛till need to try the Smoked Salmon!

What a great concept! Only if it were closer to me! But still a fun quick meal - I'd give it a 5 stars once it opens late night, come on Bruxie owners...do it for the people?! How awesome would that place be to grab a late night waffle sammie??? The chicken and waffle sammie was delish! The waffle is the best I've ever had, crispy, light and so yummy! Even the chicken, battered and fried was full of flavor. For dessert we had the Nutella one...can't go wrong with this one either! Go with a bunch of friends, buy different ones so all can feast on different flavors. A place that is both savory and sweet and everything in between! Keep in mind its more of a stand than a sit down diner. Its a walk up counter with minimal seating so be prepared. We went late so there wasn't a line, but from what other friends have experienced lines are usually the norm. But its very much worth the wait!

I read about Bruxie before it even opened and was looking for an excuse to venture over to Orange. 蔉inally the opportunity arose and I quickly took advantage of it! 蔠hile there were so many tempting options, I settled on the special braised short ribs with blue cheese. 蔕ne of the owners was standing outside and since my friend was lugging her sweet little Violet in her carseat, the owner quickly snagged one of the few tables for us. 蔠e chatted with her about how business had been and why they went with the waffle idea! 蔛he is super sweet! �Our food arrived, and everything I had been hoping for was met! 蔜he food was great! 蔍 mean really good! �I nibbled on my friends order and savored every bit of my own. 蔜he short ribs were tender with good flavor, the blue cheese was subtle and added a creamy texture the sandwich was looking for. 蔜here was a side juice that complimented the ribs and blue cheese, making every bite a perfect combination of flavors! Only word to the wise, Bruxie is right by a community college and junior high (or some type of school), so parking can be a bit tough and I would expect a line.

Bruxie.. Your concept must have been conceived on a late night filled with drunken debauchery fueled with hunger or a lazy day smoking the marijuana with the munchies to follow. Seriously who would think to make a waffle burger!? Someone blitzed I tell ya. You are a strange concept, you are, but you were delicious... sober. Bizarre, I know. A walk up savory and sweet waffle stand, Bruxie is the twist on crepe joints in France. They have a small menu of savory waffle sandwiches, including: fried chicken, prosciutto and gruyere, egg and bacon, smoked salmon and dill, burger, cheese, etc. Also to note, their sweet waffle sandwiches included: s'mores, fruit and cream, nutella and bananas, PB&J, etc. We tried the prosciutto and gruyere which was average (even though the prosciutto was 'flown in from Parma'). I had a few bites but couldn't really stand anymore. However, the egg and bacon sandwich was to-die-for. Maybe it's because I crave eggs and bacon at every meal of the day, but still, it was just delish. Next time, I want maple syrup on it. We didn't try the savory waffle desserts, however I am almost certain they are delicious (hello nutella is like bacon and makes everything better). I recommend stopping by Bruxie in the area, drunk or high or sober, I am sure you can find something that will please you. Will I go out of my way to stop by here? Probably not. P.S. They didn't have your normal diet coke, coke, sprite, etc soda choices. Their soda selections were from old fashioned pure cane sugar, maybe to honor the historic food stand? Not quite sure, but the diet cola was just gross.

As far as chicken and waffles goes, this place is different than the traditional ones i had. But this a good kind of different. They have other things on the menu, but i went with what they're known for, the c&w with maple syrup. It's filled with flavor, however, the portion could be bigger. I'm a growing boy that could easily finish 2 orders of the c&w. I did find the syrup a bit on the sweeter side, they can probably tone that down a bit. The soda, I think they said they make their own, tastes pretty much like store brand, nothing special there. But they do offer floats, so you should get that. The service was great, they have people talking to you while your in line, and introducing you to their menu. They have parking for like 5 cars, but there should be plenty of street parking. Seating is horrible, you might have to stand around for a bit before getting a seat. Or have a friend look for a seat while you stand in line to order.

Good food, great hangout, very upbeat and friendly staff, reasonable prices. Quick service. 蔛eating is sometimes iffy, it's all outdoors and there's no bathroom (otherwise I'd give it five stars.) Adjacent to Chapman, mix of locals and college students.

Took my foodie crew to check this place out. (hubby & son) We had actually driven by previously and seen the new addition to old town and knew we had to check it out. So, if it was up to my son it would of been 5 stars, he ate it up.... He had the Goat Cheese and Sun Dried Tomato one (very good), my hubby had the Prosciutto & Gruyere (also good), & I had the Fried Chicken & Waffle (pretty good) (also the most filling, if you're hungry), & an order of Waffle Fries. This came close to $30 with just 2 drinks. What was the problem?? STILL HUNGRY.... So we got the Angus Burger (since I wanted to try it anyway) (and it was good). So now we are at almost $40 with a refill.... The actual waffles are nice, light and airy, with a little crispiness. The food was good and admittedly different, a little edgy and kinda cool. One of the owners tries really hard to talk to customers. Definitely should be tried, but be ready to shell out some sit down cash... Why so pricey?? Waffle mix is extremely cheap.... especially when you own a Waffle Mix Manufacturing company, which they do. Unless they got majorly ripped off on the walk up stand lease, they are definitely rolling in the dough....

The parking sucks because a parking permit is required to park everywhere so you have to look for a public parking area/lot which is like a five minute walk away from Bruxie. 蔜here are not a lot of seating's and they have a little area where you can stand to eat. 蔄 big plus is there customer service because they were so nice with their recommendations and check ups. To keep it simple, come here during a nice day with some good company, have a good walk, and enjoy the food because damn...I want some bacon, egg, and cheddar waffle AND nutella and banana right now!

Oh Bruxie you were something I've been mouthwatering over visiting for months via FB. I finally got there & it was what I expected & wanted. Yummmy! �Let's just get it over with Mr. Bruxie. Get the cheese for this one whine. Yes there was one whine & it's all me & well my hubs too. So I'm sure it's happened to someone else so it's worth mentioning. I ordered the Saturday delisciousness special of braised shortribs & bleu cheese fries. I LOVE me some bleu cheese fries & of course shortribs. So I was super disapointed when my sammie arrived in it's happy boat without any bleu cheese fries. Upon invesitgation we found them (2) in the sammie. For $9.45 I'd like a handfull of fries with my sammie please. We were so lucky in my opininon all the way around. We pulled into a 30 min parking spot directly in front of Bruxie. The wait was short (12 min) in comparison to what I've seen it could've been & we were out in the allowed 30 min for the spot. The owner/manager came out big straw hat on & spoke to the line handing out menus & entertained us all graciously. While a youngin' passed out water to us if we were so inclined. The staff that took our order before paying was fast & thanked us for waiting. All of this little stuff goes a LONG way when you're waiting in line to order then eat standing too. Now I only ordered one thing expecting it be a calorie buster lunch of Mammoth proportion. The sammie size was big for a single portion & the shortribs were falling apart & so savory. The flavors just sang to my tastebuds. Just good all the way around. The differenct textures were wonderful too. The waffle was crispy on the outside with a squishy center that enveloped the braised short ribs & added texture from the waffle fry. My hubs is still a little fussy with me not ordering additional fries since he's a fry aficionado & there weren't any included with the sammie but next time I know order fries too. Can't wait to try something new next time. Thanks Bruxie for the best shortribs I've ever had & nice customer experience.

One star for really good Peet's coffee and frozen custard. One star for sturdy and compostable cutlery. And that's about it because the chicken and waffle sandwich was way too bland for my taste. The waffle was light and crispy but the piece of fried chicken breast was greasy (it made the waffle soggy) and absolutely tasteless. I'm going to Roscoe's for my chicken and waffles fix.

The concept sounded great. 蔛weet and savory in one, made me crave it. Spoiler alert: This was not the best waffle I've had, definitely have had better. I was passing by this joint and decided to finally try it out. Slight disappointment in the end. Parking: It can suck on a busy morning, be prepared to hunt for parking on neighborhood streets. Watch out for pedestrians. Atmosphere: You have to love the location in Orange. Cozy little spot across from Chapman University. Always looks and feels busy. Service: Due to the long line a person is out to take orders in the line and gives you a receipt. After the order is completed someone runs around calling your name...it can kind of be a cluster f"l"uck, but got to love the effort. No complaints in this department. (IF YOU DISLIKE LINES DO NOT COME TO COMPLAIN). Free doggie treats (loving it)...I wish I was a dog :D Food: Somewhat disappointed. I did not read any reviews before ordering and just ordered 1 item. Prosciutto and Gruyere. I thought it was conservative to say that it would be really hard to mess that up. I guess I was wrong. One word to describe the taste: bland. There were only two flavors: one of mustard and oil. My mouth was saturated in grease for quite some time after 1 waffle order. It was pretty bad. The waffle turned soggy, extremely greasy, bland in flavor, mustard was overpowering the flavors, prosciutto was not up to par, cheese had solidified before I was able to enjoy it in a melted state (tells me this thing was sitting too long). Definitely not what I wanted to start my day off. Overall: My expectations may have been too high for Bruxie. I dislike giving bad reviews to a highly recommended place, but I have to tell the truth. I am not saying to avoid the place, but just make sure to be prepared if the food is not as great as you expected. High volume of customers can affect the quality of food and service. That is just a given, unless the place is managed extremely well (warranting a 5 star review of course). There were a few holes at this establishment that can be corrected and I hope before I get there the next time to try the rest of the menu.

I had no idea this place had a cult following, but I can see why now. I had the wild mushroom, goat cheese and arugula and let me tell you, it is fantastic.

A lot has already been said about this place. Here is what I have to say about what I ordered: Chicken and waffe: chicken itself was nothing special. Not much flavor from the chicken. The honey sauce was mild, but the coleslaw was really good. I could eat that by itself. Pastrami: this was really good. The pastrami had this really good flavor to it, although they didn't make it themselves so I guess I have to give Boars Head credit for that one because that is what made the sandwich really good. Smore's: ok this was heavenly. Such chocolatey goodness. Not overly sweet at all, even with the marshmallow. This was the best thing I got and ate it all up. To be honest, I didn't find the actual waffle to be anything special. It just gave a good crunch to the sandwich and the dessert. I'd probably come back, but probably just for dessert. It's pretty pricey. I paid $16 for the chicken and waffle, smore's and iced tea. It's still a must try at least once.

Ohhh it's good... Really good :) While we were there we had already started planning our orders for the next visit! The parking isn't great and their choice of calling your order out by name had it's flaws. They gave us someone else's order with the same name. But neither of those are going to keep us away from trying this place again. When we got there it was pretty busy. But the staff was fast and they got the orders out quickly. We got two waffle sandwiches; fried chicken and nutella banana. Both of them were really great. The waffles are delicious replacements for traditional buns. They're light, crispy, soft, and chewy all in one bite. Prefect compliment to any of their sweet or savory dishes ;) The chicken waffle tasted so good we attempted to eat it slow and savor each bite but it was gone before we knew it. The meat was tender and extremely easy to bite through. Before coming here we already knew the best thing on a waffle was nutella and bruxie confirmed it with their nutella banana wafflewich (it might not be a word but it's fun to say!). Warm melting savory deliciousness!! We went with friends and it was a consensus on how much everyone loved it. A friend of ours tried the short ribs wafflewich special and it was superb. Employees were all very nice. We can't wait come back! It's been awhile since we gave a restaurant five stars! Thank god, we were starting to think we weren't going to find anymore :) We really liked bruxie's food. It's a uniquely delicious departure from the norm and we loved it. We highly recommend you trying it out.

This place offers a different spin on sandwiches. It's such a great concept to create a sandwich using a waffle. There were many reviews mentioning the chicken and waffle so I decided to try it out, one large waffle and a giant piece of chicken in the middle. The taste was a great mix. There was a hint of sweetness with every bite. 蔜o say that it was okay will not give the sandwich any justice. �The service was great and the line was pretty long when I got there, but it moved pretty quickly. Besides the friendly staff, there was a guy standing by the line answering any questions that we had. 蔍 found it funny that I wasn't the only person there for the first time. 蔜his place had to be good to have so many first timers there all at the same time. 蔍 believe the guy standing was the owner or the manager, and it was nice to see a higher up grinding it out with his fellow employees. 蔕verall, the service was great and the wait time wasn't horrible for as busy as it was. The dining area and parking is a different story. 蔜here is only outside seating at this place, and its first come first serve for all the tables. 蔐uckily I was able to snag a table after I ordered my food so I got to sit down and enjoy it on a table. 蔒ost people seem to get it to go and eat elsewhere. 蔍 even saw a couple eating their food on the bus stop bench across the street. 蔊ood luck on the parking. 蔜here were only two to three parking spots in the parking lot, and there was no chance I was going to be able to park in there. 蔜he surrounding streets have some limitations like permit parking only, so be careful and read the signs. 蔍t took me some time to find parking, but I believe it was all worth it. This place is a solid four star place. 蔍 enjoyed the different spin on the food and the great customer service. 蔍t is true that parking might be a pain, but I believe it's totally worth it. 蔍 will be coming back to this place the next time I'm in the neighborhood.

Went there on a Saturday summer afternoon. The weather was nice so downtown Orange was poppin' meaning parking was a pain in the ass. You may have drive around for a few minutes before you find a space. When we finally arrived there was a bit of a line but it moved quickly. I got the buttermilk chicken waffle sandwich with the strawberry shake and my brother got the salmon and cream cheese sandwich with an iced tea. We were both satisfied. The waffle is very light, almost feels like it will fall apart, but it maintains its integrity. My brother said his fish was very clean and fresh. My chicken could've used a little more seasoning, I think, but it was still good. The California strawberry shake was the highlight even though it was a bit sweet for my taste. (But I don't have a sweet tooth so my reaction is probably atypical.) A pleasant experience. Its popularity doesn't surprise me at all.

i don't know what's so great about bruxie--its just replacing bread with waffles! but it tastes so good! i love it. i've tried: strawberry creme brulee--thank you yelp for this suggestion. everyone needs to try this. the melted brown sugar and custard are absolutely amazing together. oh and there's the strawberries and fluffy waffle fried chicken waffle--crispy, tasty, good with maple syrup bacon, egg, cheese--typical breakfast sandwich. i can probably make this at home. i like it anyway smoked salmon--very good-quality salmon, the cream cheese spread is good too pastrami--oh my 蔳oodness. very very very meaty, pickly, yumyumyum. burger--the patty is thick and tasty. the vegetables are fresh. i thought the waffle was weird the first time i tried it since i was so used to the bun, but i still love it. strawberry cheesecake--meh, not my favorite. it just tasted like strawberries with cream cheese and graham cracker. I didn't get the smooth, creamy texture that cheesecake is supposed to have. waffle fries--perfect complement to the burger. crispy, salty goodness. shakes--i tried pumpkin--soo good! vanilla custard--very creamy and smooth--tastes great paired with the strawberry creme brulee strawberry lemonade--very fresh, tastes tart and sweet

Unique idea. Actually, many people probably had the Idea if a waffle sanwich place 蔮ut bruxie was smart enough to actually pursue and open it. Pros: the staff was really friendly so itwas an obvious plus. It was rainig and they were still outside greeting people and being nice. 100% maple syrup. That's all I have to say about that. Cons: the food. 蔍 was excited to try their specialty ( chicken and waffle) but it was a major disappointment. Chicken was thin, dried out on the inside, soggy on the outside, and worst of all bland and flavorless. It was sad to see that this is what they call "fried." I expect a fried chicken patty to be crispy out the outside. I can go on forever. Waffle- also flavorless and surprisingly airy. I dont know if i like that or not. Can't expect a waffle to be bursting with flavor but it had no trace of that delicious butter trail you'd find in a normal waffle. Coleslaw- chopped up cabbage, mayo, and lastly plain lazy. No effort into this thing. Syrup- made the entire thing taste like syrup. This isn't the syrups fault it's the bland chicken and coleslaw. it probably didn't help since it was what made the chicken soggy. Fries- fries. Overall- the best thing here was the Heinz ketchup, syrup(produced by someone else), and the conveniently thick napkins. Maybe I'll give t another shot if I'm in the area but for now? No thanks I think I'll save my ten bucks.

I wanted to hate it. I needed it to be an over-hyped fad. 蔉or starters, it is far from health food and secondly, it is always crowded and there are few seats. As you can see by my star rating, I loved it. We were lucky to snag a table (there are only a handful) and yes, you need to put up with the perils of outdoor sidewalk dining -- smokers, loud motorcycles that keep going by and dusting you with exhaust fumes. But the food! 蔍 only tried the hamburger waffle and the fried chicken on this visit. The fried chicken was superior though both were delish. 蔜he waffle is a waffle of insane greatness. Crispy and light yet holds up to the sandwich fillings. The burger was of good quality and the chicken was the perfect mix of sweet and spicy. I wanted a sweet waffle - but let's not get greedy here. 蔜he floats - creamsicle, egg cream and more -- were intriguing as well. 蔇rink refills are $1. 蔊o on an off-hour and prepare to be hooked.

I have tried the following and listed them from worst to best: Smoked Salmon & Dill Cream - This tasted horrible to me. 蔍t didn't taste cooked at all. 蔍 know this is smoked salmon, but it tasted raw. 蔈very bite made me want to puke. 蔜he cream that they spread inside has a taste that you get sick of quickly. 蔍 was starving but did not bother finishing it. Strawberry Cheesecake - This tasted okay. 蔍t was misleading because there was no cheesecake inside it. 蔍t tasted more like strawberry yogurt spread inside and topped with strawberries. Green Eggs and Ham - This tasted like a regular breakfast sandwich. 蔍t wasn't anything great but was the better of the two real food items that I tried. PB � J - It tasted like a regular PB & J sandwich. 蔔othing special, but you can't go wrong with PB & J. Strawberry Creme Brulee - This was my favorite. 蔍t was delicious! 蔍t had a custardy sweet taste with slices of strawberries. 蔒y only complaint is that there weren't as many strawberries in it as there was in the strawberry cheesecake waffle. Overall, this place is better for dessert than real food. 蔆ustomer service is great. 蔛eating is slightly hard to find. 蔅oth times that I went, we had to wait for someone to leave but found a table within 10 minutes. 蔍f you sit along the bushes, it is infested with flies that land all over your food. 蔕nce we ate and were ready to leave, there were already people hovering nearby ready to take our table. 蔍t made me feel rushed. 蔐astly, there are no restrooms which is ridiculous.

Bruxie is a gourmet waffle sandwich spot right next to Chapman University. It's a shack so you order at the window and seating is outdoors only. They mainly specialize in their savory waffle sandwiches and sweet dessert ones as well. They also have Belgium originals such as Brussels (your regular well-known "Belgian" waffle) and Liege (dense & filled with pearl sugar). I like that they brew Peet's Coffee & Tea here. They also have their specialty drinks (Belgian hot choc., mocha, caramel, vanilla lattes), shakes & floats, their soft serve frozen custard, and Belgian waffle sundaes. I had the: Liege Waffle ($2.95) - very disappointing since it was not a Liege waffle at all. The texture was totally off, like a crumbly cake donut. I think they're already pre-made because it didn't seem very fresh. I guess that's why it's so cheap. If you want to enjoy a REAL AUTHENTIC FRESHLY-MADE Liege waffle, try Waffles de Liege, a new Liege waffle truck! http://www.wafflesdelieg�Small Soft Serve Frozen Custard ($2.95) - I've never had frozen custard so I can't really compare this, but it wasn't anything special... just felt like I was eating soft serve that kind of tasted like condensed milk. Buttermilk Fried Chicken Waffle Sandwich ($6.95) - This was the best out of all those, which is why I guess you might want to stick with their specialty: waffle sandwiches. The fried chicken was pretty thin, but the chili honey flavor was good and so was the cole slaw. I think the texture of the waffle was what made it the best. It kind of melts in your mouth... guess that's why I finished mine so quick. I really like the concept of this place, but besides their waffle sandwiches, the other waffles just don't match up to what they should be. I'd still recommend people to try this place out just because it's unique. If I'm ever in the area again, I'd be interested in trying their Bruxie Burger, Smoked Salmon & Dill Cream Cheese Sandwich, and probably one of their sweet waffle sandwiches such as the Lemon Cream & Berries or the Ogura Bruxie (sweet red bean). P.S. While eating in front of Bruxie, I spotted a Google Maps car drive down each street of the intersection so if you're ever mapping Bruxie & you see a girl looking at the camera in shock, that's me :)

Okay, This is your classic example of okay food. I was disappointed because the Yelp reviews were raving. My girlfriend and I actually drove far out of our way to get here and this was a long anticipated journey only to find that the food was mediocre at best. I am not saying that the place was bad, just that with the high praise I expected much more than I got. The Good: �� Concept was creative and attractive. It sparked our curiosity enough for us to plan a trip out here. �� Honey chili sauce was pretty damned tasty. I think it saved this place from a 2 star rating. The Bad: �� Chicken had an odd flavor. It was dry and bland with a funny after taste. The girlfriend attributes this to the buttermilk recipe. Now I don't know sausage about no damned buttermilk so I guess I'll let this one go with a subjective "mehhh, not my style". �� Waffles were not moist and fluffy. When I eat waffles I want moist and fluffy, not dry and slightly crispy. So all in all it is an okay place to eat. I will never go here again.

Yelp finally did not let us down this time! 蔠e love this place! 蔉irst we ordered two. 蔠e liked them so much, we ordered two more. 蔣es, we had four in one sitting. � ) The waffle by itself isn't anything amazing, but it's just right as the ends of a sandwich. The Buttermilk Fried Chicken & Waffle is so freaking good! 蔙eminds us a little of Bakesale Betty's fried chicken sandwich in Oakland, but we must say the chicken here is much better... so moist and tender and the sauce they use is a nice match. Only thing is that they should really kick up the slaw a notch with some herbs or something. The Prosciutto & Gruyere is delightful...the waffle and sauce/spread compliment the saltiness of the meat and cheese really well! We also had the Bacon, Egg, and & Cheddar. 蔍t was also good. 蔜here is a good amount of bacon chunks, and the egg is cooked overeasy. Lastly, we had the Lemon Cream & Berries. 蔛oooo yummy. 蔜hey used blackberries this time. 蔍t would have been better is they put just a bit more berries in there. 蔄lso, be warned that the lemon cream makes the waffle soggy if you don't eat right away, so better not to take it to go. We will definitely be back!

I was reaffirmed for my love of Bruxies this weekend when I was lucky to catch the end of their limited seasonal menu of the "Date Shake" and the Wild Mushroom waffle. My favorite waffle at this joint is the Sun-Dried Tomato (served with arugula and goat cheese with a vinegrette) but on their seasonal menu that hangs on the order window I noticed they had a similar waffle with wild mushrooms... So when I approached the window I was troubled... I didn't have the stomach to eat both but I wasn't sure I could pick between my favorite waffle and something new that sounds good but could result in disaster... The cashier was kind and suggest that I get the Wild Mushroom and add the sun-dried tomato and that it was amazing. 蔔aturally, I bit. It was the most delicious concoction I've eaten there to-date. 蔄nd then I washed it down with an order of waffle fries (not to die for, and a super small serving) and a Date Shake (which was good, but it has to grow on you). I was not a fan of the PB&J waffle. 蔍t's too ... easy or something. I think my PB&J sandwiches taste better (but I am a master PB&J maker, it has everything to do with proportions and the perfectly toasted bread). I also had a taste of the Salmon and the Ham and Cheese. 蔜he Salmon was quite delicious. 蔍 would eat that one again. 蔜he Salmon was just perfectly smoked and tasty. 蔜he Ham & Cheese ain't my thang but if you're a breakfast lover I supposed it's pretty good. I will be back and I suggest adding the Wild Mushroom and Sun-Dried tomato waffle to the regular menu. 蔍t will be the biggest hit. Trust.

I met up with Grace C. and Shane D. after the OC Heart Walk 5K at Bruxie for brunch. 蔍 would just like to say that I absolutely love the Hot Pastrami sandwich made with grilled Boar's Head pastrami, citrus slaw, pickles, gruyere, and spicy brown mustard. 蔍 asked them to go easy on the mustard since I really despise the condiment, but found that the balance of flavors were all there, so in hindsight, the mustard made the sandwich better. 蔍 ate that sucker pretty fast and was perfectly satisfied. 蔜he strawberry lemonade was a perfect compliment to my meal. 蔒y friend Grace C., had ordered a small frozen custard along with her waffle sandwich. 蔍 love frozen custard and this one was soft and creamy. 蔅ruxie, I know you're opening another location in Brea, but please open one in S.

Bruxie could be another roach-coachin'-gourmet-truckin'-meal-on-wheels-?concept that's taking us by storm, but instead, they've chosen to set up shop right across Chapman University. 蔒aybe they should've considered the truck idea because parking can be a hassle. �Anyhow, we ordered their burger, chicken, and lemon waffles. 蔜ook a bite of the burger and it became a hit. 蔜he sharp cheddar cheese, cool crisp cucumber, thinly cut tomato and refreshed lettuce tucked inside the waffle with the pure angus patty definitely made this an instant classic. 蔠e actually ordered it with avocado and our server told us they ran out and he ran off. 蔛o do we get our dollar back? �I moved on and took a bite of the next waffle, and it's hot, crisp, tender, plump and juicy chicken, combined with the spice kick of the chili honey and added texture of the slaw easily made me forget about the burger and is now the new classic for me. Being full, I didn't want to try the third order, but after my gf raved about it, I was inclined to take a bite. 蔋oly &#*! 蔍t was like a religious experience. 蔜he custard was heavenly. 蔍t wasn't overly tangy or sweet and the berries complimented this bold fold. 蔜hey described the custard as an intense lemon cream and let me tell you, it was mind boggling. 蔈ach bite brought me closer to limbo as it was intense like the 5 dream stages of Inception. Upon finishing, our server brought us two cups of their soft serve ice cream to compensate for the avocado and possibly redeem a yelp star and boy oh boy did they redeem and earn that final star. 蔍t was smooth and creamy, had none of that icy taste and simply finished us on a high note. 蔔othing beats a cold treat on a hot Sunday afternoon. All in all, we spent about $20 for 3 waffles, so it could be on the pricey side, to mention they also charge $0.25 for filtered water, but it's a Venti cup like Starbucks, which is understandable. 蔛eating is extremely limited so you have to be quick to snag a table. �Bruxie is definitely my new tootsie and Adam should showcase this on Man vs Food as we finally have something different to brag about.

After reading a bunch of reviews I just had to try this place. Moved it to the top of my bookmarks ate here before heading to Disneyland. This place actually gets a 3.5 from me. It's good and needs a little work before making me a fan. It's a little spot where the eating area is outside. The concept of the food is unsweetened waffle filled with chicken, beef, eggs etc. It's basically eating a waffle sandwich. They use really high quality ingredients here for a good price. I ordered the Prosciutto & Gruyere and my friend got the Bacon, Egg & Cheddar. The prosciutto and greyere was okay. It got tiring to eat after awhile. It wasn't heated up enough to make it feel like it's melting in my mouth. The Bacon Egg and Cheddar was really good. It matched well with the waffles. The waffle itself had a light crisp in the beginning. If you didn't eat it quickly the waffle would get soggy. We also got the waffle fries. Those felt like they weren't cooked well enough. If it was a bit more cooked it woulda been a lot better. Since kinks they need to work on but I'm glad they brought something new to the table. Recommendation: Bacon, egg, and cheddar savory waffle.

Dear Bruxie, I really wanted to love you. 蔜ruly. 蔍've been building up our future romance and inevitable long-term relationship in my head for weeks now and finally it was time for us to meet. I knew exactly what I wanted... One Liege, One Wild Mushroom and Arugula, One Egg Bacon Cheese, One Fried Chicken Waffle, and then whatever my mum was ordering (I've got a big appetite, okay?!). �Sadly, the liege was out, the wild mushroom I had drooled over online was not on the menu, and there was no chicken. 蔄ck! My whole ordering plan gone awry. 蔕kay, instead I for the Brussels, Bacon/Egg/Cheese, and two Cappuccino's (they have Peet's, I could not not order a drink, and a nice strong capp sounded lovely with the sweet and savory waffles). The Brussel came out quick and was nice, very light and airy, and perfectly crisp. 蔍 had only ordered the cinnamon sugar option, but it ended up coming with all four: butter, powdered sugar, cinnamon sugar, and maple syrup - which was a happy surprise since it all went really well together. The Bacon/Egg/Cheese was hot and delicious. The salty bacon, melted cheese, and crispy waffle went oh so well together. 蔄 bit pricey for breakfast, but tasted good. Then the wait started... 蔜he couple two orders ahead of us got their coffee: "Cappuccino and Soy Latte" - bruxie boy behind the counter "Soy? are you sure, I ordered a non-fat." - couple "um... yeah, it's a non-fat" - bruxie boy "You sure?" - couple "Yes." - bruxie boy [couple walks away... then after a minute walks back up] "Yeah, it's soy." - couple "Oh. 蔛o did you want to order another one?" - bruxie boy "No, I just wanted to get the non-fat one I ordered." -couple There was a bustle behind the counter during which I heard the owner say "we don't have non-fat guys!" The boy before us got his latte... then finally 15 & 20 minutes after we got our waffles our two 'cappuccinos' came out, which were not actual capps. 蔔o 1/2 foam, just 16 ounces of hot milk. �Also, in between our two drinks, the couple (who never got their re-made drink), told them they'd come back tomorrow for the coffee since it had taken so long... then I watched as they had to go back another time to have one of the employees move their car that they had double parked behind them. Bruxie, I offer my past-barista services to you to train your staff! �I feel the hiccups are purely because they are new - they aren't as trained on the menu or the espresso machine, and unfortunately the crowd when I went was more than a bit disgruntled. The waffles were delicious, and I would definitely go back for them. 蔎ust not for the coffee drinks.

I wasn't in the mood for waffles, I wanted an egg sandwich...But low and behold - The Bacon, Egg and Cheese waffle was the answer to the quandry! It was a great twist on the breakfast classic. 蔜he traditional waffle with cinnamon sugar was really good too - perfect consistency on the waffle -light, sweet, and not too cakey.

I don't really understand all the hype with this place. I mean first off, the whole concept is kind of weird, a hamburger with a waffle as the bun? Weird. But anyway, I decided to try this place the first week that it opened. I got the fried chicken one, which came with fried chicken, coleslaw, some sweet sauce and of course the waffle. I'll admit, it wasn't bad. But definitely not worth waiting in line for. We fortunately didn't have to wait more than 5 minutes because we went around 11 am, but during lunch time, this place gets packed! The chicken was crispy and the meat was tender. There definitely wasn't enough sauce on it, it could have used more sweetness. The waffle itself was good except it literally tasted like butter. So the food was good, but not great, and not worth waiting in line for. And the food is extremely heavy, all I wanted to do after eating that massive fried chicken sandwich was take a nap and I felt groggy for the rest of the day.

As amazing as waffle sandwiches sound, they actually taste even better. You know how sometimes a concept sounds so amazing in your head that you hype it all up and there's pretty much no way around it - you're going to be let down. Kinda like senior prom or your 21st birthday or most New Years Eves. Well, imagine just the opposite for Bruxie. The waffles are perfect, crisp, fluffy, just airy enough, and not too heavy. A slight hint of vanilla but not nearly as sweet as waffles from Roscoe's. Seriously, these waffles are so perfect, you could put fried toads in between them and it would still be delicious. But, luckily you don't have to resort to fried toads, you get amazing options like fried chicken, hamburger, nutella, red bean, prosciutto & gruyere and more. Alas, they were out of fried chicken when I went, but the prosciutto & gruyere was quite tasty. The burger was the most surprising, because the actual meat of the burger was delicious too and the texture of the waffle with it made a delish lunch. I had a bit of the nutella and banana waffle too and... I mean what else is there to say, other than, I'm sorry, crepes. You just got your ass handed to you by some kickass waffles.

Went on a sunday morning at 10:00 and it was already packed, a line of 20 people is formed. I ordered 4 different ones for my first time and shared with few people. Had the 1) Buttermilk Chicken and waffles, 2) Lemon cream and berries, 3) cheddar , bacon and egg, 4) liege waffle with nutella. I must say they all did not disappoint. My favorite was the buttermilk and waffle, followed by lemon cream. The only reason i didn't give it at 5 star is the seating situation and the long lines. the food came out pretty quickly but I felt like I wasn't really at a place to relax and enjoy the food, more like just finishing the food.

Fried chicken - 蔄mazing, the super moist chicken in the honey sauce plus the coleslaw!! whoa, I was expecting this one to be my fave but then i tried the next one Gruyere and prosciutto - 蔕fficially my favorite at the moment. Just the right amount of salty and cheesy, then the chives kick in!! OH and of course the crunchy from the waffle, i should have ordered 2 of these Finally the Bruxie Burger - Definitely a awesome burger, the meat was nicely spiced and covered in melted cheese, somehow the pickles and this whole burger work really well with the waffle. I was definitely surprised by this one! Next time, Smores and lemon curd with berries!!!

I'm sure glad I decided to try Bruxie out instead of heading to my usually spot on my Food Cheat Days. 蔍 tried the Chicken Waffle and it was sooooo freaken delicious. The sweet chili sauce was very tasty on the sandwich. Their food is freshly made and packed with flavor. They also have Cola's with real regular sugar. None of this fructose corn syrup or artificial sweeteners crap. 蔍 enjoyed Bruxie so much that I came back the next day and tried some of the other items like the banana and nutella sandwich. YUM! 蔄lso, don't forget to try the Liege Waffle with chocolate. WOW! If you are in the area, I definitely recommend this place.

This is just for the dessert waffle sundae thing. �It was ... not great. 蔒aybe I had really high expectations because of all the hype and high reviews, but it was just a sundae with a waffle under it. The waffle was hard and tasted like a biscuit. 蔄nd not even a really good biscuit. 蔄 mediocre one. 蔍 liked the ice cream sundae part better than the waffle, but I could get that anywhere! Maybe I should try the non-dessert waffles. 蔅ut I wasn't impressed, bruxie. 蔛orry!

First time my friend told me about this place I was like "yeah waffle sandwiches, lets go to in-n-out" but he convinced me to make the pilgrimage and then to wait in the line as well. I AM GLAD he talked me into it. 蔊one there four times since and I realized I pretty much have gotten the same items. The waffle and lox was good but It could use more lox. 蔜he braised ribs sandwich is ridiculously good, chicken and waffle is marinated well (do not expect roscoes style, this is NOT southern style chicken) and my favorite is the strawberry creme brulee waffle. The Sodas are great, you don't taste the heavy carbonation you do with your everyday sodas. The owner and exec chef is out there greeting and helping customers pick items. 蔊reat service, great food, primo location.

I had a great time here today with the cousins. 蔆ousin M. had mentioned this place several weeks ago and really wanted to try it out. 蔍 did too, but was stuck on my diet so it took a while to coordinate. �I should've had the Fried Chicken Waffle but I opted for the healthier Smoked Salmon Waffle because I couldn't risk the extra calories...potentially sabotaging. �Yet Sir Kelly somehow convinced me to indulge and get two waffles, a savory and a sweet since I wanted to try the Nutella Banana with sweet cream. �Cousin W.'s order was slightly delayed - they thought it was an error because it was a duplicate to the previous order, Cousin M's Green Eggs and Ham and Strawberry Cheesecake. 蔛o, she brought over some Waffle Fries for him as a consolation. �And, the ever so charming, flirtatious Sir Kelly checked in to see how everyone's food were. 蔍 had mentioned how I wanted to try the arugula pesto with my Smoked Salmon Waffle since I'm lactose intolerant. �He kindly replaced my cream cheese with the arugula pesto! 蔍 was impressed and thrilled! �Apparently, they can whip anything up for you and you can be as creative as you want when I inquired about this "secret menu." 蔋e was telling me about some AP students that are frequent patrons, coming up with some pretty creative wafflles. 蔜here's a sauteed mushroom waffle that sounds really yummy, which Sir Kelly said he would make for me personally. 蔍 told him I wouldn't be back until another three months and asked if he would still remember me...we'll see in three months' time!

Um....... YUM!!!!!!! I tried Bruxie's for the first time yesterday and it was heavenly. You can always expect a crowd here but the line goes by quicker than you'd expect, which is good. I love that they spray mist in the afternoon time to help keep their customers cool and offer free ice cold water too. My savior! I tried their Seasonal Creme Brulee ($6.50) and everything was absolutely perfect. I can't even describe how delicious it was and how satisfied I was!! Their staff are all super friendly and so welcoming, I love it! I can't wait to come back and try out everything else on their menu. Yum yum yum.

The only reason why it lacks the full 5 stars is because of the location but besides that, the food here is a must try! I've been nagging my boyfriend to accompany me to Bruxie's for several weeks now and I can now finally write a positive review. We ordered: 1. Chicken Waffle: We had to try the infamous chicken waffle that so many yelpers have raved about. There's no need for maple syrup cuz the taste is sweet and savory already from the honey and chicken. Even though this is the #1 best-seller, it personally isn't a favorite of mine. 2. Cheeseburger Waffle: My friend ordered this one so I didn't actually taste it but from his words, he enjoyed it and said it tastes like a cheeseburger but an "up-scaled" cheeseburger. 3. Wild Mushroom Waffle: This here, was DELICIOUS and probably my favorite out of the three! The whole mushrooms were full of flavor and the melted goat cheese was just the right amount. The arugula adds a bitterness but the balsamic reduction balances it out. For the mushroom haters, I'm sure this sandwich will change your mind. The only thing I do have to mention is that the waffle gets soggy pretty quickly but it was so good I gobbled it up anyways. Service: Ok, based on reviews, everyone says service is friendly and yeah, they're friendly.. but they're seriously on crack haha. I rather enjoy my food without having to constantly be asked how I'm doing. Next time we'll be ordering from the sweet menu. Granted the savory menu was awesome but I think the sweet menu will have more to offer.

Bruxie is a great alternative to commercial fast food. They have a clean environment for a place that only has outdoor seating, a good variety of menu items, and a friendly staff. I have to say that while it's interesting to try a waffle sandwich, I think once you get past the novelty you'll realize that the hype is a little overrated. While the waffle sandwiches were delicious, none of the flavors really stand out. The food, particularly the roasted mushroom and the smoked salmon sandwiches, are not bland, they don't pack the kind of flavor that should punch you in the mouth with deliciousness. I do like the frozen custard though, and their fountain sodas are tasty. Definitely try Bruxie at least once, and maybe occasionally if you're in the Old Towne Orange area. Just don't buy into the hype.

I never thought I would enjoy a burger and a sandwich made with waffles. The burger is so juicy and full of flavor. 蔜he waffle is crisp and not buttery at all. 蔍n fact, it's such a clean taste that I can't quite describe. It's definitely become one of my regular spots.

Bruxie Order List (split between 2 people) 1 fried chicken waffle sandwich 1 Liege waffle with Nutella 1 waffle fry combo add-on 1 old-fashioned cane sugar regular soda Total was $16~ I don't know why but for some reason I was expecting Bruxie's fried chicken to be like Roscoe's fried chicken. Instead what I got was a less flavorful Chick-Fil-A chicken breast, but without the glorious breading. The Bruxie fried chicken waffle sandwich was OK, but not impressive. I had the chili honey on the side and together it was a confusing taste. The waffle fries were good, crispy on the edges and chewy in the middle. Needed a bit more salt though, and with all the other carbs I'd ordered the fries were overload. On waffles: Bruxie does pretty well with their waffles. Both the sandwich waffle and the Liege waffle (one of their sweet waffles) were fresh and soft and good. The Liege waffle is very dense (like a cake donut) and if you get Nutella the hazelnut tends to overpower it completely. I think if I were to order it I'd want a very small amount of syrup to dip it in instead. The Liege is already sweet and good on its own but the Nutella just makes it into Nutella spread on a cake donut instead of hey, there was a waffle somewhere there. The cane sugar soda: meh, I prefer Coke. Cane sugar imported from Mexico, glass bottle Coke is the way to go. Bruxie haiku Long lines but owner is nice Waffles good, fried chicken bland.

I've eaten here a couple of times now and I must say that this place is LEGIT. You can eat here for Breakfast, Brunch, Lunch, Dinner, Dessert, etc. It's always crowded but the wait time is pretty short. Just pure awesome. The Buttermilk Fried Chicken & Waffle and 蔅ruxie Burger are my favorites. If you haven't lost your Bruxie Virginity, YOU MUST IMMEDIATELY.

Uhm, what more can I say? Everyone has said it already...I love the food! The smoked salmon waffe sandwich is my fave! The waffles are so good, crunchy just the way i like it! YUMMMMM!! The service is great. 蔐ines are not as long as they used to be, thank goodness. The only drawback is the seating. There are never enough seats for the amounts of people that eat here. �I reccomend taking it "to-go", if you can. This is a "must-try" for everyone!

This is perfect on a sunny day (all outside seating). They do have a parking lot but it's VERY SMALL (like 3 cars only lot small), luckily there's plenty of street parking. There was a constant line but it moves fairly quickly and allows you to browse the menu. This place has an interesting concept, using waffles as bread. The sandwiches have a lot of flavor but they are slightly on the smaller side of what I expect a $7-$8 sandwich to be. I stuck to the savory (more filling), maybe if I come back I'll try something sweet. Nonetheless it's a place you have to try, just to experience it. Recommendations: Smoked Salmon & Dil Cream (if you love cream cheese, get it), Prosciutto & Gruyere (was missing something, maybe a little more sauce would have made it better: more honey dijon mustard with seeds?), Strawberry Shake (DELISH, creamy and just the right sweet).

So since this place is pretty new, I wanted to give some time before I visited. First of all, the concept is brilliant. Second of all, whoever bought this place and put it next to a college is a marketing genius. I am sure this place will do really well. The food is of course great. I had the fried chicken sandwich and it was very tasty. Love how it came with a side of syrup for a good touch :). Also try the cola, it is so real and legit!! If you come here, you will also never get bored with ordering the same thing because from time to time they feature new specials (last I went it was a wild mushroom and arugula sandwich). Last, the people that work here are super nice and helpful. The girl that was managing the orders was super inviting, and sweet. Only downfall about this place is that it is outdoor seating. They definitely try to make it comfortable with heaters....but overall not as fun to eat at in the winter.

When I get waffles, I expect to be able to taste them. This was not the case here, as the waffles were light, crispy, and essentially FLAVORLESS. I could eat everything here with regular bread and it would still taste the exact same! Since that defeats the entire purpose of the concept of waffle-wrapped food, which is this place's core gimmick, I've come to the conclusion that Bruxie is only worth a meh 3 stars. What we got: - Bruxie Burger: all the ingredients were extremely fresh--soft meat, thinly sliced pickles, melted cheese, basically your typical burger but with waffles as buns. While it lacked a bit of flavor, I thought this was a decent offering. - Buttermilk Fried Chicken and Waffle: sweet honey-drenched fried chicken with coleslaw. My partner enjoyed this, though he ended up eating the chicken and waffle separately so as to be able to taste the waffle. - Waffle Fries: fresh and hot! Definitely a must-buy here. Portions are nothing to rave about, but these were still pretty good for $2/order. Plus, they're seasoned liberally with pepper. Think Salt and Pepper Kettle Brand Chips but in waffle fries form. - Fruit and Cream Waffle: we went with strawberry preserves for the filling here. It tasted very artificial and totally not worth $5.95. Come on, $6 for something this tiny? Rip. Off. Our total came out to be over $25 for three waffles and two fries. I guess that's not THAT bad, but I still say it's overpriced for the portions given. Also, parking here can be a bitch depending on the time, but at least it's free street parking for 2 hours. That's enough time to eat and to wander around Old Towne Orange.

First off I'm not a fan of American BBQ at ALL. The sauce is just simply too sweet for me. But I'm willing to give restaurants a chance before I judge. Seasonal waffle BBQ pulled pork: * Delish! but waffle gets soggy fast * BBQ is light and not overpowering * Pork was tender and savory * Fresh home made pickles. YUMMY! It's perfect, not too salty with a crunch to it Bruxie Burger: * Patty - juicy, perfectly cooked to medium * Everything about this burger is good. It'll be perfect if there's more flavor to the patty because I think it's a little bit bland.

I was incredibly disappointed with this place. I ordered a small frozen custard, and a chocolate shake... I was told it would take 10 min... OK, they were a little busy, I'll let it slide. But nearly 30 min later there was still no sign of my custard or shake. I asked the boy at the counter... he asked the girl at the ice cream station... they lost my order. Thanks to the untrained staff and the overpriced food I lost $10 and almost 35 min of my life to something that costs maybe $2 to make and 13 seconds to serve. I was almost wishing that the old lady from the Dairy Treat was still working, even though she wasn't always the sunniest personality, she and her one worker go the food out on time. Not like the 5-6 teens scrambling around the kitchen area.

Based on the food I give Bruxie 4 stars. However, I deducted a star because of the booths. Yes the booths! The place that you should comfortably sit and eat your food, the booth! Most places I eat at have booths that you can freely slide from one side to the other. The booths at Bruxie have a metal divider in the middle of the booths that causes the inside person to have to crawl around it to sit. I didn't think I'd be crawling over a jungle gym every time I wanted ketchup or napkins. However, I added another star because of the service. Especially, the little Vietnamese girl. Thanks for being so helpful and cheerful, you're a rock star. �Ok back to the food... The food was delish (Are men suppose to use that word? I felt funny saying it out loud). I had the buttermilk chicken and waffle with the waffle fries. The maple syrup that they drizzled over the chicken really blended the whole taste. The buttermilk batter was fantastically crunchy and the chicken was moist. The waffle that encased the whole thing was crispy and sweet. When you bite into it you can feel your teeth go through the different layers from waffle to buttermilk batter to the chicken. Then all of it mixes together to create a surprisingly delish (there it is again, appropriate?) taste. After we got the Ogura waffle which is an Asian Red Bean paste that was spread between a waffle. Seriously, who thinks of these concoctions? 蔄nyway, it was awesome! A definite must try or must try again! The only other semi-negative thing I have to say is that for the price I think you should get a bit more food. Thus, only 4 stars. I felt the portion sizes where a bit small. If you're hungry go grab a $.99 chicken sandwich at Carl's before and I think you'll be good.

Umm. Yumm. Came here for breakfast with a friend the other day, as a Bruxie Virgin. As we waited in line at this little corner food-joint, she went over what was good and what wasn't. 蔍 could hardly pay attention at first as the cute waitress delivering Belgian waffle sandwiches had really caught my eye ;-) 3 stars off-the-bat for a cute waitress who is super nice. 蔆ue in the Waffle fries, and my Smoked Salmon and Cucumber dill Waffle. =*(** delicious. They have alot of other choices, including their specials, a nutella and banana waffle, a bacon and egg and cheese waffle.....and they have a lot of categories ranging from salty and filling, to sweet and decadent... something for everyone! Also featuring Pete's Coffee. Parking is hard, since its in Downtown, and the neighborhood doesn't allow non-permitted cars to park there. All seating is outside, so beware on freezing mornings!

I LOVE waffles, and I think that the menu is such an awesome idea.

The cheese inside my sandwich wasn't even melty : ( I don't know about you but cold sandwiches when theyr'e supposed to be hot or at least warm is NO BUENO.

If you are looking for a light and interesting meal, I think this is your place! Bruxie is a small little place right next to Chapman University. But you'd be amazed at how many people come to this little food stand! Parking can be a bit of a beezy around here; mainly because the place is right off the street. Bruxie is a window order joint. You place your order, pay, and wait for your food. There is outdoor seating in a covered area so if you just want to relax there you have the choice. I, for one, like to grab my food and wander around the Chapman area. It's a very nice place, especially if you want to walk, eat and chat! The best part about the place to me is that there is a waiter outside still who walks the food to you! To me, it shows they really care about their customers. The manager even comes out and makes sure everything was as great as you hoped it to be. I had the Smoked Salmon without the Dill Cream Cheese of course. It was very good. The waffle was very light and had a nice savory flavor to it. It complimented the salmon very well. My only problem with it was, I came to Bruxie starving, and shortly after I left I was still a bit starving. If you get the chance, grab a soft serve frozen custard! It's a good size where you can share it with another person and it's really smooth. Next time I go, I want to try the Buttermilk Fried Chicken and Waffle. It looks bomb!

Found this place on yelp so we came to try it out. We had to street park, but it wasnt a hassel. When we saw the line going down the street, we freaked out a little, but it moved pretty fast. the service here is really good. the waiters would come and hand us menus while we stood in line, they would answer our questions, and one waitresses even let us sample their black cherry soda. they took our order in line to speed up the process. finding a table here is tricky since it is an outdoor restaurant, but we did find a standing table. after ordering and paying for the food, it only took about 5 minutes for it to be ready. We ordered the fried chicken and waffle sandwich and the roasted mushroom and goat cheese sandwich. we got waffle fries and a strawberry shake. everything was amazing!!! i'm a slow eater though, so by the time i got to the second half of my sandwich, the waffle bread got soggy so it didnt taste as good, but i still ate it anyways. the strawberry shake was really good, but a seasonal drink only. this place has amazing food, with amazing service. A bit pricey but that's what you get for having a different take on the sandwich.

Bruxie: Gourmet Waffle Sandwiches -- Motto: The Bold Fold Went there last night (1 hr before close) with a few friends. Ended up ordering 4 times (because we wanted to try everything, wanted it hot, no line). Here's what we ordered: SAVORY MUST TRY / FAVES: �Prosciutto & Gruyere - if you love cheese... do it Bacon Egg & Cheddar - breakfast fireworks in my mouth, cooked to perfection! Bruxie Burger -- most filling Wild Mushroom & Arugula (off-menu -- special -- limited availability) - the mini portabellos were super delish Other Savory: Smoked Salmon & Dill Cream Cheese, Sun-Dried Tomatoes, Buttermilk Fried Chicken (size of chicken could be bigger) SWEETS: From the sweets (not a big sweet person) -- I can see the S'Mores being addictilicious to those who love chocolate or crave campfire memories. The flavors fused together really well. One way to enhance it? Order a custard and give yourself a healthy dollop with every bite. Haha, you'll thank me. Personal favorite was Lemon Cream & Berries. It was tarty and I loved the fresh berries. The Nutella & Bananas was good, but not one of my faves. Don't listen to the naysayers that talk about leggo my eggo. If you can't tell the difference, then you really shouldn't be writing reviews. These waffles truly are crispy and airy, but I'm also pretty sure they have lots of butter. So whereas I doubt that they'd be "healthy", each buttery bite has a rich quality. Bottom Line: the ingredients are quality and gourmet. the waffles are buttery and delightful (eat them hot!) Make sure you order the waffle fries (peanut oil + coming out hot = awesome). One more thing: they just opened Bruxies last week. you could tell they are working out the kinks. Expect lines and difficult parking at peek times.

I finally was able to visit this place and see what the hooplah was all about...Seriously what the waffle. The strawberry lemonade was too good. How dare they charge for a refill that is actual worth paying for. Ordered the fried chicken and waffle, (smh) shit was good too not tooo good but just good. Seriously who thinks about making a sandwich from a waffle and putting chicken in it...You have to be off your rocker to pull that kind of stunt. Also had the burger, yea I am a fattass, cry about it I actually split so I had half chicken and waffle and half bruxie burger. I will say that the burger was better but the chicken was good as well but the burger won by a leg. See what I did there...Back to that wack strawberry lemonade, man that ish was delicious. Better than bj's, no you sicko I am talking about the bj's the restaurant. I kind of went tolemonade school so I kind of know wtf I am talking about. Game recognize game, phi mee. What some people don't know is you have to put seeds in your strawberry lemonade or it aint strawberry lemonade, yea I am talking about you Rojo Robin. Oh in the waffle is like not soft and not crunchy. But perfect kind of like a toasted panini but not too toasted. No but for real tho, shit was crackin, it was a pleasant Sunday afternoon with the lows in the 70's. The main question you are thinking is...would I come back....you beat your gumdrops I would.

I had to update my review. I came here before and ordered a bruxie burger and cheesy bruxie which were complete crap. Boom, 1-star. 蔜he workers were very nice though. I don't know why, but I came here again. My girlfriend and I had the buttermilk fried chicken bruxie and smoked salmon cream cheese bruxie. CRAZY GOOD. I hate coleslaw, to the point of gagging. But the coleslaw in the fried chicken bruxie was freakin' incredible. The smoked salmon bruxie was also very good. Still a little bit pricey at about $8 a sandwich. The fries are bland enough to omit. These 2 sandwiches are definitely going to be my routine orders though. They need to take the awful, bland-tasting bruxie burger and cheesy bruxie off the menu. I almost did not come here again. Scary.

The two things I got were superb. 蔜he thing my BF got can be fixed and made superb in a heartbeat. 蔍 ordered the wild mushroom with gruyere as well as lemon cream strawberry bruxies. 蔅F got the chicken and waffles. 蔄t the risk of sounding like a glutton, I must disclose that we shared the sweet waffle. 蔍 only ordered two. 蔅ut I ate one and a half :)))) I was stunned at how light the batter was on the mushroom waffle....it was absolutely delectable...total crunch-munch! 蔅ut, those were not wild mushrooms....they were button or baby bellas. 蔄m I wrong? 蔔ot likely. 蔍 expect chanterelles or oysters when I read "wild." 蔅ut then again, that's maybe too much expectation for something that's ridiculously tasty as it is. 蔍 just prefer clearer descriptions. The lemon cream strawberry tasted like pink lemonade and was the best summer desert. 蔍 gotta make some of these at home now. The chicken and waffle one needs a zingier slaw. 蔍t was just a little too sweet, what with the honey added and the sweet batter on the chicken. 蔄 little lemon juice in the cabbage would have brightened the whole sandwich delightfully! Their free wi-fi didn't work, but you can easily log into Chapman's free one. 蔄lso, the setup is great in that it's outside, you don't have to tip and yet you get free service from the girl that brings the bruxies around.

After friends giving it so much praise I thought I get it a shot. Location is nice and quiet right next to Chapman University only downside is that there isn't any restrooms. Its a very hip place to eat, it seems like people from all walks of live are here to get some good grub. The prices are affordable. I got the chicken and waffles, people told me it was the best thing ever, I on the other hand thought it was ok but what really got me was the old fashion sodas and shakes which I thought was excellent. Location: 4 stars quiet/cool atmosphere but no restrooms and outdoor seating only Food: The chicken waffle is 蔭verage, a nice variation from the 蕌sually soul food version. The drinks are excellent I recommend the old fashion sodas and shakes. I will definitely have to check the other things on the menu but for now I give it a 3.5-4

I didn't think this place super special... I was expecting so much more. I got the fried chicken waffle sandwich. Chicken wasn't very crispy...almost soggy. Waffle was ok. It was very light and airy. Service was great. Everyone was friendly.

Definitely a hipster type of joint. 蔣ou know what I'm talking about. 蔣ou see 500 reviews for a place with almost 5 stars, get there and realize you've been had. It was basically 400 hipsters hyping up a place. Anywho, I'm a sucker for those 500 reviews type places, I have to see for myself. So I've tried the waffle burger, buttermilk chicken waffle and Belgian hot chocolate. 蔄ll of it is just...ok. 蔔othing to write home about really. I guess Roscoe's has ruined me for life for any other waffle food place. 蔜he staff is super friendly though, if you care about that. 蔜he location isn't very ideal if you're coming from South OC, you know you're driving far when you pass Disneyland. 蔖arking is a nightmare, you will struggle to find parking and when you finally get through the long line waiting to order, you realize you don't have anywhere to sit to eat. Ah well. Hunker down on the curb next to a bird and enjoy yo waffle. You earned it.

I don't know why, I suddenly had a craving for..Belgian. Found Bruxie on the Yelp homepage so I decided to give it a try. My cousin and I split a fried buttermilk chicken waffle sandwich and braised short rib waffle sandwich. They were both OKAY. I was starving after my study session so I expected no less than a food-gasm. Did I get one? No. The meat in both sandwiches could have used more flavor and I could have been a bit more full afterwards. You'd think I'd be less critical at the hungry state I was in.. I really wanted to like this place, I really did! The people are beyond nice and the location is really cute. I think I paid too much to still have a hunger headache, though ($10 for a combo, which is basically just an added side of waffle fries). I'd still come back to try their sweet waffles.. or atleast come back drunk/hungover to give the other savory items a chance. Don't let me down next time, Bruxie.

Bruxie, oh Bruxie. How I wish this location was bigger, had more seating, and not to mention, a restroom. 蔄side from those things, the food totally makes up for it. There are a lot of things that sounds amazing on the menu.. but i had to try their most talked about buttermilk fried chicken and waffle. The buttermilk fried chicken and waffle was delicious!! My boyfriend got the bruxie burger, which was pretty darn delish too, but I liked the fried chicken better. It was more flavorful in my opinion. I asked for a sample of the soft serve custard. And oh my, it was so rich and thick.. simply yummy! Too bad I was full, I would have definitely ordered one. Until next time.

The first time i went i ordered the buttermilk fried chicken. the chicken was just mediocre, even a little dry to my taste. The waffles were great though! The second time i came with 6 friends so we decided to get different things and try them all! we ended up ordering: -green ham -red bean and cream(Ogura bruxie) -buttermilk fried chicken -prosciutto and gruyere -lemon cream and berries I really enjoyed the green ham waffles! it's an interesting taste but a great blend of ingredients. I liked the ogura bruxie but my roommate thought it was too creamy. Parking all around the place is 30 minutes parking but there's plenty! The line moves pretty fast. They also have doggie treats if you ask them :)

I was intrigued with the idea of chicken and waffles ever since Roscoe's become known to the civilized world. 蔋owever, never got around to going there so when I heard that Bruxie had chicken in a waffle I just needed to try it. The whole chicken/waffle combination is really good. 蔍 can't say that there is anything particularly special about any one ingredient except the waffle. 蔍t is light and crispy which is different than the what I'm used to eating. 蔇on't get me wrong, the chicken is very good too but the waffle steals the show. 蔍'm neutral on the chili honey but 蕋hink that maybe a standard pour of the maple syrup would be better (they charge an extra $1.00). The last visit, I had the eggs, bacon and cheese waffle. 蔋mmm, I would say that the chicken is the best on limited sampling. All-in-all, a cool little spot that is convenient for my lunch hour and serves to quench my appetite for chick and waffles. ---------------- 5/15/11 Update Had the "Green Eggs and Ham" and "Strawberry Creme Brulee" 蔭nd those are now my favorite. 蔄bsolute masterpieces of taste. 蔍 especially loved Peets coffee with my strawberry creme brulee waffle. 蔍t was absolutely food porn experience this morning.

I had the best Belgium Waffles at a stand in Brussels and thought to myself I wish they had a place like this back home! Bruxie's is just as good as the authentic stuff! Bought a few and split it with two other people just to try a good variety... They were all good! Bacon egg an cheese, fried chicken and waffles, lemon cream and berries, and the strawberry 蔯reme br瀕巈... It was so good that we went back again the very next day. Oh and the service is great! We sat to enjoy our waffle sandwiches and the owner walked around and asked how everything was... When we finished we got back in the long line to get something to go and the owner saw us and said "oh you guys getting something to go... You shouldn't have to wait again... What do you guys want I'll put the order in for you" we gave him a card he went back put the order in and charged the card... A few minutes later he came back with our order... I don't think anything like that has ever happened to me... That's what I call excellent customer service!

Deliciously Simple & Satisfying! Whenever I'm in Orange County I make the trek over to Chapman area to walk around enjoy the scenery and have one of their delicious savory sandwiches. Sweet waffles can't be missed- Try whatever is on their specialty menu for the day and you won't be disappointed. Nothing is over $8 and that just makes it more satisfying. Wishing they would move to LA

Came here for dessert after going to Haven Gastropub and it was my first time trying it. Went here blindly without reading any Yelp reviews, but heard from a few people that Bruxie was good. Tried the Banana and Nutella one and it was alright. I didnt like the sweet cream that much and the waffle tasted like a french baguette. I was very disappointed by this..it was quite unexpected. My 15 year old cousin makes better waffles than Bruxie...I seriously kid you not! Will probably come back to try the smore waffle..but well see! Love the Christmas decor..plain and simple! Enjoy! :)

After logging into Yelp day after day, seeing how mad everyone is about this place, I HAD to go. We parked right across the street. As we drove off I yelled "I love you!" My boyfriend said, "I love you, too!" to which I replied, "I was talking to Bruxie." Verdict: BRUXIE IS THE SHIT. Make sure to dress warm now that it's getting colder, since there's only outdoor seating. I had the impression it was gonna be kind of sketch but it feels totally safe there. I'm a waffle lover and oh my goodness was this food amazing. I was really excited to try it. My boyfriend was skeptical at first because I think he was expecting the waffles to be very sweet, but they weren't. The waffles were super light, fluffy, airy... other synonyms for light... Very soft yet somehow had a tiny crunch. I had the Bruxie burger without tomatoes or pickles. I was kind of worried because it comes with a mayo spread and I do not like mayo. However, I figured that if it only came with mayo on it, it's that way for a reason. So I let it be, and I'm so glad I did. The two patties were juicy and had the most amazing flavor. Really good meat. Cooked perfectly. Crunchy lettuce and lots of melted cheese. There were big globs of it in different places and it had a really sharp, bold taste to it. Lovely! The boyfriend had the chicken and waffle sandwich thing. He said the chicken wasn't greasy and he really, really liked the sauce. He said he would have liked more sauce but the whole sandwich overall was amazing. We had the Brussells waffle as a sweet dessert and I'm not usually a person for sweet things, but this really hit the spot. It's a waffle cut into quarters with powdered sugar (you can get cinnamon sugar if you want, I don't like cinnamon) and maple syrup dipping sauce. All of their plastics are also compostable, which is awesome. Their cups, straws, and even the portion cup that the syrup came in were all recycled plastics. Props to them. The old fashioned cola tasted really good, like if Pepsi and Coke had a baby. I WILL BE COMING BACK. I won't be able to resist.

Bruxies was pretty good. The owner came to my fraternity's meetings and spoke to us about his business. Two days later I tried Bruxie's for the first time. I had the Bruxie's burger and it tasted really delicious. The meat and cheese were my favorite part. The idea of incorporating a waffle was pretty awesome. I am interested in going back to just try waffle by itself and maple syrup because the tastiness of the burger took away from the waffle. I wish there were more seating for large groups or even groups of 4. When I went with two of my other friends, we had to squeeze on a 2 person table because all the other tables were full. Considering how much business this place has, they should have more seating! The strawberry soda was yummy too :)

Went here about 3 weeks ago with my daughter and sister. Tried the Prosciutto & Gruyere and I must say it was tasty. My sister had the Wild mushroom and arugula, also tasty (a lot of arugula though). Daughter got the Bruxie burger and that also was good. We also had the Lemon Cream & Berries which was delightful, we all loved this one. Then the reason why I took 2 stars off... we got the strawberry creme brulee... WITH A LONG BLOND HAIR IN IT......... (we are all brunettes)... GAGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGG?GGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGG!!!! Not good at all and just thinking about it makes me want to VOMIT!

Who likes waffles?? �MEE! 蔒EE!!!!) 蔜alk about savory fluffy goodness, Bruxie's got some innovative creations when it comes to combining hot meaty goods with sweet crispy/fluffy waffles. 蔎ust writing up this review right now is making me DROOL. So what did i order?? 蔠ELL...i originally wanted to order their special "Braised short rib" waffle, but they told me that they only put that on the menu every once in a while...so if you see it on the chalkboard, ORDER IT~ Since I couldn't order the braised short rib, I decided to go with their Chicken & Waffles (i know, such a cliche). 蔅ut don't let it fool you!! 蔜hey put a fun twist on the Chicken & Waffles dish by adding in their OWN semi-spicy salsa! 蔛ure ain't Roscoe's but it's definitely UP there on my list of chicken & waffles. 蔜he chicken was crispy & moist (not dry inside). 蔇efinitely a must try. My friend ordered their special of the day, which was their corned beef waffle or pastrami waffle, one of the two hot deli meats. 蔄nd BOY-OH-BOY! 蔆an some one say...MMMMM....!!!! 蔍t was perfectly combined with melted Gruyere cheese. 蔒ade me wish I had ordered that ONTOP of my chicken & waffles. To finish off...I ordered the Creme Brulee waffle..and just like their menu states...it literally tastes as though they sandwiched actual creme brulee in the waffle. 蔍t even had the lightly burnt sugar that is usually ontop of creme brulee. 蔜his dish was also one of their specials that day. All in all, I want to come back AGAIN to try more of their other BOLD FOLDS! �This is one of the reasons why I'm so happy I live so close by. �)

I really don't get it. 蔜hey're just waffles. 蔍 think the people who rave about this place are looking through rose colored glasses and are mesmerized by the novelty of eating waffles with chicken and burgers. 蔜he portions are small--$7 gets you only one strip of chicken inside a folded waffle with some sauce and lettuce. 蔜he burger is also about the same size and price. 蔜he sweets are the same as what you would get at a crepe place. 蔍'd choose a crepe place over Bruxie any day.

I've read so much about Bruxie and have been dying to try it. 蔠e waked up and were kind of turned off by what looked like a long line. 蔠e were fooled, the line was quick. 蔅ut while we were in line I was impressed with owner, he was out greeting customers and asking if anyone had questions about the menu. Food - we had the fried chicken and lemon cream and berries waffles, both pretty good. We also had the date shake since it was one if the specials. The shake was also pretty good. I can't say that I love the food but I will be back to try other waffles.

Every time the husband and I would pass by Bruxie we would see a huge line and the place was always packed! We finally decided to stop by and investigate and we are sure glad we did! Bruxie is a small little place in Old Town Orange which has a very relaxed atmosphere with 蕂utdoor tables and chairs to sit or stand on. 蔜he staff is extremely friendly and kind. When we went the owner was actually outside handing out menus and helping new comers like us make their selections. Though the lines are long they are quick to take your order and pretty decent at getting your food out. Both my husband and I had dessert waffles. I had the creme brule and I have to say that I honestly have never had a waffle taste as heavenly as this one did. It was simple amazing! The strawberries were soft, sweet and fresh, the waffle was fluffy and so yummy....Everyone else around me, including my husband, seemed to be having a nirvana like experience as well. Highly recommended and I will for sure be visiting again.

After all the hype and hullabaloo, my boyfriend and I HAD to try out the waffles. The area is really cool, kind of reminds you of an Old English Town with pubs and restaurants lining the streets. My boyfriend ordered the Bruxie Burger while i got the Buttermilk Fried Chicken and Waffle and we both shared their 蕇ugarcane cola. It didnt take long at all for our orders to come, and the workers there were really upbeat and friendly too. From what i saw, my boyfriend really enjoyed his burger. He's usually not the type to really indulge in american food, so this one was quite the winner for him. As for mine, IT WAS ABSOLUTELY AMAZING. At first i was a bit hesitant on ordering because i've never eaten chicken with syrup, but i was totally hooked. It wasn't too sweet and the chicken wasn't dry, the only bad thing was the waffles got a little soggy at some parts. Slight downfall for Bruxie: NO BATHROOM!

It's a good try. If you're curious, go for it. It's good, but I wouldn't come eat this stuff all the time. It's oily and...just fatty. Green Eggs and Ham was my first try. Orgy in my mouth, but I'd eat this probably once in a full moon.

First time trying this local eatery. It always seems extremely packed and bustling during lunch hours, but thought I'd try it out. Its a small joint with very limited seating/parking area. So if you can walk, much better. 蔜here are probably about a dozen seating areas but the workers are all friendly and attentive. Basically, if you love waffles then this is a place to try. 蔜here are savory and sweet waffles. I tried the prosciutto and gruyere with chives. 蔖retty light, but the waffle is a bit buttery and crunchy. I will definitely try some of the other options like nutella and banana's or the well known bruxie burger and the fried chicken. I love, love, LOVE that they serve Peet's coffee here. They can make any drink iced. So close to work and friendly staff. The only thing is to avoid lunch hour esp. if you're short on time because the lines do tend to get long.

things i love: waffles, sweet and salty, sandwiches, cheap food, outdoor seating, friendly service Bruxie manages to hit all of those. win win win you order from a window and then grab a seat at one of the picnic style outdoor seats. food was up under ten minutes. we ordered the bacon egg and cheese as well as the fried chicken sandwich with syrup with a side of waffle fries. at first i thought the egg and cheese sounded boring compared to the other options and i almost didn't order it. however, the egg and cheese was basically the ultimate breakfast sandwich. definitely get this one. the fried chicken was good, but not on the same level. waffle fries were just okay, nothing mind blowing. another part of the Bruxie experience that wow'd me was the chef coming out from the kitchen up to our table, asking how things are, how we heard about them and thanking us for keeping them going. i love that stuff. get here early or grab a coffee across the street and be ready to wait in line.

I wish we had Bruxie in San Diego! I came here with my cousins before going out dancing for a birthday celebration. When we pulled up to Bruxie, I thought this is where we're having the birthday dinner? A waffle stand with outdoor seating? Then I took a bite into my cheesy bruxie with added avo and tomato and I was in heaven! I never knew a waffle sandwich could be so good. Naturally I had to try everyone else's non-meat flavors since I couldn't order 6 waffles. Other yummy flavors were the sun dried tomato and goat cheese, wild mushroom and arugula and s'mores. Skip on the fruits and cream waffle, the strawberry "preserves" tasted just like smuckers jam or somethin. Try the s'mores instead. Also, according to my cousins (I didn't taste it) the smoked salmon and dill cream cheese waffle was not very good... the salmon didn't taste right like smoked salmon should and tasted more on the raw side. The egg and cheese was just ok too. Overall, this place is awesome! Parking is limited, so you might have to find parking on the street and possibly wait a couple minutes in line. But the food makes up for it, eat it now!

Old town Orange has a lot of very nice places to eat, and Bruxie has definitely proven itself to be one of them. First off, I would like to thank the staff for warning as well as helping me and everybody out with the parking situation, which is a major bitch. One of the owners of Bruxie was standing at the corner outside of the establishment kindly advising approaching customers on where they could park if they wanted to avoid getting ticketed by the city. �This place can get packed during lunch time; their small lot will probably be full, and if you don't have a residential permit, you're gonna have to hunt down a parking space across the street, which is still in walking distance. The waffle sandwiches are not too pricey here, and they pack a lot of flavor together with a nice little crunch. 蔍 came here the other day for lunch with my brother and my girlfriend. 蔅rother had the fried chicken and waffle sandwich -- buttlermilk fried chicken and cole slaw between waffles. 蔍t was tasty and 蔴ad just enough sweetness, that there was no need for syrup. 蔜he only thing faulty in the design of this sandwich was that after a few minutes, the coleslaw would start to soak into the waffle, which made it a bit soggy. 蔜he girlfriend and I shared a smoked salmon and dill cream with added arugula. 蔊reat sandwich; I'll probably sub out my bagels from now on for waffles. 蔉or dessert we had a banana nutella waffle, which was just so-so. 蔉or the sweeter waffles, I think I would want a sweeter batter or something. 蔍t was a good waffle, but nothing spectacular. Bruxie makes great waffle sandwiches that are handheld, neatly assembled, and easy to devour. 蔅ut sometimes I just want to sit down with fork and knife and cut into an unbound, open faced waffle layered with excessive amounts sweet and/or savory toppings. 蔅ut I can't ask Bruxie make such a change to their battle plan, can I?

So, after reading so much about this place on Yelp, I figured I should check this wonderful little spot out. 蔐ocated in an area I'm quite familiar with since I used to work at a RadioShack nearby from time to time. 蔕riginally I was going to hit it up for breakfast, but I sorta kinda got behind in my day. ANYWAYS. 蔍 ended up heading down there, and was a little surprised that even before 12PM there was a line. 蔔o line will deter me!! 蔍 parked and looked at the menu. I was originally going to pick up the Bacon Egg & Cheese Bruxie, but being later in the day, I craved a more lunch-y option. 蔍 chose the Cheesey Bruxie (Tillamook & Gruyere Cheeses) and added Ham Tomato and Avocado. 蔅eing a Soda Jerk, I picked up a cane sugar cream soda too. 蔍 checked the place out, it seemed pretty quaint. 蔍 didn't end up staying as I had to pick up the slack in my day. 蔕nce I picked up my food I was on my way. So, let's start with the soda. 蔜asted REALLY good. 蔉or fountain soda, I thought this cream soda was pretty dang good. 蔍t had some nice sweet creamy flavor. 蔍'm going to try the root beer next time. 蔔ow, onto the main event, THE BRUXIE! Looks wise, I was...confused. 蔄 waffle? 蔅ut...with cheeses, avos, ham, and tomatoes? 蔜hat doesn't make sense! 蔛melled delicious, felt firm and crisp (no soggy waffles here!). 蔍 took a bite. 蔍t was quite good! 蔜he waffle first and foremost, is light and crisp, but its got a good flavor. 蔍t isn't sweet and compliments the rest of the ingredients IMO. 蔜he cheeses tasted amazing, and the avocado and tomatoes were nice and fresh. 蔜he ham was a great choice as well. 蔍t was quite delicious. 蔍 liked the entire Bruxie. Overall this place impressed me for a little stand. 蔍 think my only issue is that I ended up dropping $10 for a waffle sandwich and soda. 蔍 mean, I'll totally do it again because it's a very unique and delicious item...just a little bit of money. 蔛ince I started on the "Savory" side of the board, next time I'll try a "Sweet" one, maybe the Lemon Cream & Berries or Nutella and Bananas...

Went last night to try these wafflewiches I had been dreaming about the past few days. There was quite a crowd gathered around this lil stand on the corner. Took about 20 minutes to get my waffle, but that was okay. I have patience. Didn't stop the owner from walking around and handing out $5 giftcards as an apology for the wait. Very nice, good touch. I had the s'mores waffle. A little steep at $5.95 for essentially a waffle, mashmallows, a bit of graham cracker, and some chocolate. It was good, but not out of this world. I plan on returning later this week to peruse the antique malls and then finishing up the day by having a savory waffle. The waffle fries smell amazing!

I finally got to go to this place today and I was soooooooooo happy I finally went. Ordered their special- mushrooms with arugula and guyere cheese and it was AMAZING. Every bite was just perfect. The size was perfect so you are not overly full but it does leave you wanting more.The fries were fresh and seasoned perfectly. Was full so didnt order desert. Walked around Orange Circle, came back and ordered the frozen custard and the Nutella with Bananas. Both not too sweet and made just the way I like it. Cant wait to go back...maybe tomorrow?

Ive been seeing nothing but great reviews on YELP about this place, and today I had to finally try it. The good- The food here is amazing! It's different and unique. I highly recommend the creme br瀕巈! (they said it's seasonal so hurry and come before it's gone) Secondly, the customer service here is by far the best I have ever experienced hands down! One of their waiters saw me coming back for seconds, and not only did he give me a great recommendation (the creme br瀕巈) but he took my order right there without having me wait in line. If YELP had 6 stars, I'd still give then 7! The bad- Not a darn thing! Customer for life!

I was visiting a friend in the OC and she suggested that we try out this waffle place that was by her house. It was around lunch time when we got there and we had just beat the rush. On the menu they have a variety of waffle selections under savory and sweet sections. We got the chicken and waffle, sundried tomatoes waffles and date shake. Both of our waffles were delicious. The waffles were soft but lightly crunchy on the outside. All the waiters and waitresses were super nice and attentive. I will definitely try to drop by this place anytime I'm in the Oc from now on.

WHEEE! I absolutely love Bruxies. What a great variety of waffles to choose from! Not to mention that I love where this place is located. Gives it that Europe/New York feel. I was with my mom in Orange to pick up some furniture. One friend called and told us to try it out since we were in the area. My mom and I lala loved it! Reviews on the Chocolate waffle and the chicken waffle: Chocolate waffle will always be my favorite! I love how when you bite into the crispy waffle, a shot of chocolate squirts into your mouth. YUM. The waiter was nice enough to heat up the chocolate. The chicken sandwhich was.. Meh. But my mom liked it, since she really loves chicken! But yeah, for me chocolate over chicken. There are just a few things I disliked about it: There arent many tables there. So I suggest you dont bring many people with you. A lot of students go there, since its located near a school. So go 蔰uring the morning on weekdays, or go on weekend nights. Yipee for Bruxies! :')

I just can't get enough of this place! The service is spectacular considering it's a walk up window establishment. The food is always delicious. The short rib special last week was heavenly! Last weekend, the owner gave us each a sample of custard and it blew my mind. It is so rich and perfectly creamy, but not overly sweet. I also tried the liege and now I haven't stopped thinking if it and the custard all week. I WANT MORE!! My only complaint: I wish there were more seats and parking places, but I shouldn't complain since it's street food. It's all made to eat while walking or standing. I'm just lazy. :) VIVA LA BRUXIE!!

We went with the Sunday only specials: Prosciutto & Gruyere Savory Waffle Sandwich Green Eggs and Ham Iced tea Strawberry Shake Delicious, fresh tasting and it hit the spot for us. 蔜HANK YOU, YELP PEEPS for posting all the photos.

It's time for the Waffle-craze era just like the Tapioca era and the Froyo era. Whoever thought of making a savory waffle sandwich had a great idea and executed it well. Bruxie has both savory and dessert waffle sandwiches to your pleasing ranging in different prices. The prices can be steep but waffles in general are expensive (for some odd reason) so it's nothing new. If you think the combination of waffles and a burger patty doesn't work, then you need to get your butt over to Bruxie and try it out. *Prosciutto & gruyere waffle sandwich is currently my favorite at the moment. The items within the sandwich complement well with the waffle. *Burger waffle sandwich is good and yet interesting. Basically instead of the buns, the contents are wrapped over a waffle. No complaints here. *Fried chicken is probably my least favorite of the three I've tried. It's not bad but I feel like the sauce needs to change. *Waffle fries are crispy and salted perfectly. Dipped into ketchup is the perfect combination of flavor. The owner is super nice and helpful. He greets and makes small talk with his customers. It seems like he enjoys doing what he does which is what every owner should be like. I give Bruxie props for service.

Sweet Jesus this place is amazing! I ordered the Chicken and Waffles... Not what I expected. Chiken and Waffles. 1. Their waffles are light and crispy, not thick and mushy like most breakfast places. 2. Their chicken weren't too oily, or too dry. Just enough to keep you chewing without having to take a sip of water. 3. Chili Honey sauce is to die for. I almost always prefer honey over syrup whenever I order pancakes, french toast, etc., so this was perfect for me. The only disappointment was not asking for more. All in all a great place, I believe they only have 5 parking stalls on their lot, so street parking is usually the only option. Seating is very limited, but they have a bar where you can stand and eat.

Based up on the reviews here, and the fact that I work nearby and wanted to try something different and reasonablke, I swung by last week and tried Bruxie...WOW! 蔄WESOME! I ended up with the huge deep fried chicken breast, which was pounded to about 1/2 thickness and hung over the edges of the awesomely delicious and perfectly chewey waffle like something Fred Flintstone would eat (think brontosauraus burger big). The chile spiced syrup and slight crunch of the slaw was the perfect compliment to the entire meal - I practically inhaled it...and will be back to work my way through their menu during the upcoming months. YUMMY! Like a total Mouth-gasm!

Just the hype, an a-ok place. 蔊ot the chicken and waffle, didn't satisfy my craving @ all. 蔍 eat, so I need some real chicken (not just a fillet of breast) that I can eat pick up with my hand and dunk the succulent pieces of chicken into my gravy while I use the other hand to crab my fork to get a piece of the waffle. 蔍 still crave for some "real" chicken and waffle @ Roscos in Long Beach. Would not come back again.

When I heard that Bruxie was going to open, I was sold. 蔠affle sandwiches? 蔆ount me in! 蔛ince it's located near my work, I convinced a few co-workers to venture out on a cold, blistering day to indulge in waffle sandwiches. 蔄s most girls tend to do, three of us ordered 3 different sandwiches and split them in thirds so we could indulge in them all. 蔠e went with savory: **Chicken & Waffle: 蔏eep in mind that Bruxie is a waffle place that serves chicken, not like Roscoe's which is a chicken place that serves waffles. 蔍'll admit the chili-honey sauce threw off the taste a bit, but fresh out of the kitchen, the waffle had nice crunch and so did the chicken... not sure I'd get this one again though. **Smoked Salmon and Dill Waffle: My second "1/3" of a sandwich was my friend's smoked salmon waffle sandwich... the salmon was a great pairing to the crispy texture of the waffle... definitely would get this again. **Bruxie Burger: 蔍 got to this one last, and by that time, the waffle had cooled down and it was a little soggy from the veggies and burger patty. 蔇ecent flavor but not the best burger I've had. �The verdict: 蔆rispy and fluffy waffles paired with some decent sandwich fixin's - but don't let them sit too long or the waffles will get cold and then soften, losing that delicate flavor that waffles are known for. 蔄 bit pricey for some of the sandwiches ($6.95+) and because they are so airy and fluffy, they don't really fill you 蕌p. Tips: 蔣ou'll be fighting Chapman U. students in the line and Bruxie only has one window that you order from. 蔜here is some seating underneath the awnings, and a few scattered tables under some umbrellas, but this could easily be a "grab and go" establishment. 蔍 hope to try some of the sweet waffle options (Nutella and Banana waffle? 蔍'm so there!)

Fun place for an early lunch on Saturday morning. Don't let the long line discourage you. Orders are taken quickly. We had the buttermilk chicken and their special pulled pork. I'm hoping they'll make the pulled pork a regular on their menu...sooo tasty! Total of $21 for the two of us with a strawberry lemonade - a bargain for all the yummy food. Location is in old town Orange so be prepared for the traffic and hunt for parking space. Seating is limited, all outdoor and there's no public restroom.

Based on all the Yelp reviews I read, I decided to take my wife and two boys here for breakfast last Sunday. �I am a Chapman alum, so I was familiar with the Dairy Treat that was on this corner for many years. 蔍 was a regular consumer of the pastrami. Bruxie really cleaned the place up and brought in a friendly staff. 蔠e ordered the smores waffle for the boys, belgian waffles for my wife, and the bacon, egg, and cheese (minus the cheese) for me. 蔍 had seen pictures of the food and was expecting something substantial given the price (over $23 for three items and two drinks). I was kind of disappointed when the food came. 蔜he smores and the bacon and egg waffles were in little envelopes. 蔜hey were quite thin and it appeared my sandwich only had one egg. 蔄lso, the bacon was crumbled, so a lot of it fell out on the ground when I pulled the sanwich out. Taste wise, the food was good. 蔜he waffles are light and crisp. 蔄ll of the ingredients seemed to be pretty high quality. 蔋owever, the portions were pretty meager. I probably will not go back to Bruxie unless I am really craving waffles or I hear that it has become a better value. Finally, I would say this is not a good place for small active children. 蔍 had to keep pulling one of my boys out of the parking lot so he would not get hit by the cars that are going in and out. Overall, this is a good concept but the location and value leave much to be desired.

Been here about two times now and I love the food every time! I always get the Wild Roasted Mushroom since I'm trying to go vegetarian. The Belgian waffle is very soft and fluffy yet has that crunchy texture to it. The mushrooms aren't sliced thinly. They are rather plump and well marinated. The only problem I would have with this order is that they add way too much cheese in there. I would suggest if you get something with cheese, to ask them to put half the amount. Also, the srracha is a must! Thanks Bruxie for providing customers with srracha. For drinks, I got their fresh strawberry lemonade which is look the first few sips, but the drink starts to make your mouth dry. I suggest if you get the lemonade, you wait til the ice waters the drink down. It's super busy during the afternoon from noon to about 3pm so if you hate waiting or have no patience, I suggest you go there around 7-8pm because that's when its not TOO busy, but there is a line. I went around 7:30 and got my food right away. Probably only a 5 minute wait? As for tables, when it's busy, be prepared to stand in the sun and eat. It's super hard to find empty sit down tables. Be on the look out for people that look like they're about to finish up. Service is really whatever. It's not like its a sit down restaurant. So I wouldn't have to worry if others say the service sucks because you're going for the FOOD!

We got: 1 small soft-serve frozen custard ($3.95) 1 cheesy Bruxie w/ bacon ($5.95) Total: Around $9 Since this was my first time here, I got excited so went back and got: 1 sun-dried tomatoes & goat cheese ($6.95). Frozen custard was alright. A little too creamy for me. Cheesy Bruxie: Alright. Bacon was soft, cheese was stringy. Sun-dried tomatoes & goat cheese: I loved the cheese; it was creamy and herb made it taste really good. Sun-dried tomatoes was overpowering, which goes well with the arugula. Waffle was a bit soggy. Good service. One employee actually created conversation with us during the wait, which was only ten minutes even though there were so many people; she even walked by ten minutes later to make sure that we were enjoying our food. Parking was surprisingly not bad. There are plenty of spaces in the neighborhood. Despite the overwhelming number of fans, Bruxie is nothing more than average. It was a 2.5 but I rounded up since our friends' buttermilk chicken waffles looks really good; maybe I'm disappointed because we ordered the wrong items.

I must have driven by this place a million times but had never noticed it, somehow. 蔅ut when I saw it on Yelp, and saw how many great reviews it was getting, I had to try it. So, it's kind of a dumb gimmick, isn't it? 蔍 mean, there's a reason why, when we make a sandwich at home, we put it on bread, not waffles. 蔠affles don't make a good sandwich. 蔈specially not these waffles, which tasted like cardboard. 蔍 don't get it.

Came here yesterday for lunch, and by dinner time, I was still thinking about their chicken waffle sandwich. Don't let the pictures fool you, they taste more amazing than you would have imagined. Eating out, it's always great to find those creative spots that offer something unique and delicious. I came here with three other friends, and we all got the chicken waffle sandwich. The waffle was crisp and fluffy, with just enough bite and texture to it to make it hold everything together. The chicken was amazingly good. You would not expect it to taste light, but it did, no heavy oil flavor. It was crispy, light, and flavorful! It can't get much better than that, but it does! You add on the maple syrup and a touch of hot sauce, and it is just mind blowing. Talking about the chicken and waffle, I almost forgot to mention the coleslaw that's also in there. The coleslaw gives a perfect complement to the chicken and waffle; it's not heavy on the sauce but you can still taste it and enjoy every bite. I'm definitely stopping by this weekend again. I might even get two waffle sandwiches next time. But a few side notes for those going for the first time. Parking near Bruxie is pretty limited, so just find parking anywhere and take the short stroll. You really won't mind since you'll be able to see what else this plaza has to offer. Also, seating is very limited, so if you see an open table, small or large, jump on it.

My younger sister and I meant to take our mom to Bruxie for her birthday, but it never worked out. That was back in January. Neither of us had the heart to go there without her after we dropped the ball for so long. Lunch on Mother's Day was our redemption. We refused to let the long, long line deter us. We were getting our mother a waffle sandwich, dang it. The owner was greeting everyone in line and telling all the Mama bears "Happy Mother's Day!" in his sweet French accent. Well played, Sir! After standing in line for not long at all, considering how lengthy the wait looked, we ordered. Both my sister and I ordered the Sun Dried Tomatoes and Goat Cheese waffle, while Mother ordered a Lemon Cream and Berries waffle (hey, it was Mother's Day...she can have dessert for lunch). I had very high expectations of this establishment, and somehow those waffle sandwiches completely surpassed them. My savory waffle was delectable. The goat cheese was so creamy and flavorful without seeming overpowering. Mom's sweet waffle was amazingly sweet and refreshing. Did they just get back from the Farmer's Market with fresh berries and cream to make this waffle just for my mother? No? Well, it sure tasted like they did! What creativity, the owner was putting a funky twist on the magnifique French crepe, and his 'Bold Fold' worked out SO well!

Seriously, this is like Crack; not the taste, but the addiction factor. Their burger was a beast. Fries were scrumptious - Yeah I said it... SCRUMPTIOUS. Goal for 2011: try everything off of their menu at least twice. I cannot say anything bad about this place, besides how far it is from me. Gas has spiked to average $4.29 per gallon, and I'm coming 20 miles away, yet, I'd still make that trip - well worth every hefty penny!

Bruxie... this was good, i really wish i could get more "waffle" flavor out of the waffle itself... but to be fair I got the Salmon and dill so with those overpowering flavors I can't really complain about it... 蔜he root beer was good, the salmon was fresh, the dill cream cheese is a totally new favorite for me now... first time having that type of spread... seating is ultra limited... you're gonna end up sharing a table with someone or sitting in your car, i found a table for myself so I was lucky... the 10 other zombies around me tho were kinda lost... lol As I said, I had the Dill Cream cheese with smoked salmon (lox)... but maybe next time I will try the bruxie burger or Chicken sandwich, apparently the chicken is the biggest hit there... Very slow to get an order, first came my fries, then a drink, then about 8 minutes later my waffle... It's opening week so these things aren't deal breakers for me. �Beware of the parking nazi resident off of W Palm... 蔜his is permit parking only, I was just making a U-turn in the tract and she let me know of this in a not so friendly manner... She also puts out cones to block parking... Also before I left she was already out there with parking control pointing out all the illegally parked cars without permits... so FYI.. DONT PARK ON W PALM! 蔴aha... 蔭nd only like 4 spaces on the restaurant lot.. so good luck with that... Oh and one more thing, no to go bags, so if you're looking to bring something back to work, it isn't impossible but it's a task from what i saw from a man before me carrying 2 drinks and 2 chicken waffle sandwiches.. (those looked so dang good too! ughhhh!)

I could eat Bruxie everyday, and never get sick of it. I actually work around the corner, so every time I pass by it three times a week, I kind of have to shield my eyes, and turn off my senses, as to not be tempted to buy something. BRILLIANT idea. 蔜he waffles are light, fluffy, and decadent. 蔄nything that goes in between them, whether sweet or savory, turns out DELISH. When people say, "But they are so expensive." 蔍 say, "Do you want fresh, delicious food or not?" 蔍f you don't, I'm sure there's a McDonalds around the corner... have fun. One of the employees suggested I order the Buttermilk Fried Chicken and Waffle with a couple of changes in the sandwich itself. 蔋e suggests ordering it with gruyere cheese and barbecue sauce instead of the spicy sauce that comes with it. 蔍t is one of the tastiest meals I have ever had. The nutella and strawberry waffle is stuffed with just the right amount of filling... pure indulgence. 蔠hat really makes this dessert is the white cream they add to the center. 蔍t gives such a nice hint of sour contrast between the sweet velvety chocolate and the fresh slices of strawberries. �The Black Cow float is my weakness. 蔜hey generously rim the inside of the cup with melted belgium dark chocolate, then they pour their unique cream soda, and top it off with a velvety vanilla custard. 蔜his combination is unbelievable. 蔍 am a total sweet tooth, and this gets me every time. 蔍 suggest splitting it with someone to feel less guilty. Bruxie speaks for itself. 蔎ust go... Who cares if the line is a block long? 蔍t is worth the wait. 蔅e patient, order everything I have just discussed, and you will have the time of your life.

I hate waffles, OK hate is a strong word - most of the time they are too dense for me....but Bruxie made me fall in love with them!!!!!! First we tried the Bruxie burger- a hamburger patty with mayo, lettuce, tomato, pickle and cheese wrapped in a waffle. Amazing! The flavors just melted together so perfectly, I liked how the waffle was lighter than a bun, the waffle didn't overpower the deliciousness of its contents. Next we tried the wild mushroom, arugula and herbed goat cheese waffle- hands down this was my favorite. The mushrooms are cooked in some delicious sauce to give them a good texture and flavor. The arugula is nice and crisp and the goat cheese was so creamy - my taste buds almost went into a coma. Next time I will try the sweet waffle creations like the smores or lemon berry. I will definitely be back, too bad they aren't closer to where I work or might go there everyday for lunch.

I feel like a salmon going against the river by saying that Bruxie's isn't all that. Waffle sandwiches are indeed outside of the norm and test the boundaries of fat-ass-ery, but does it make me want to sacrifice my waistline? Does it make me want to give in and create some curvaceous thunder thighs? No. Let me start from the get-go. Bruxie's needs some better parking options. Foodies be warned, you WILL have to park somewhere and walk to Bruxies. So Bruxie's offers a wide selection of savory and sweet waffle items. I must say, some of the combinations are really interesting and they make me drool thinking about it, HOWEVER, eating it is somewhat different. I expected the waffle to be sort of like a belgian waffle--a soft, fluffy waffle, but I was given this crispy waffle. Was it delicious? Yes it was quite delicious but I sort of prefer bread. I feel as though the waffle is simply a gimmick and substitute for panini bread. And when I compare it to a panini or a regular sandwich, I would much prefer the bread option for TWO reasons: 1) bread is flavorful and has inconsistencies which are exciting and 2) bread can hold more food. and more food = more happy and more happy = happy jonathan. I applaud Bruxie's for their creative and delish creations, but it's not satisfying for my carb-loving heart.

My first reaction was a waffle instead of bread for a sandwich? But then again, I had never eaten at the former Dairy Treet because it looked sketchy to me. I was open to giving this new place a try after seeing the warmer colors and fresh overhang. I went in with caution as The Panther had a mixed review about Bruxie. But after ordering a sweet S'Mores Bruxie, I was pleasantly surprised. I came back weeks later to try their savory options and really enjoyed the selection. My personal favorites are the Bruxie Burger, Cheesy Bruxie with Bacon, and the Buttermilk Fried Chicken Bruxie. The only thing that is keeping me from giving it 5 stars is the speed of service. I respect that the staff try their best to keep things moving and food delivered to the appropriate guests but sometimes when it is super crowded, things can be a little backed up. But it has never taken more than 12 minutes to have your food arrive during a more crowded time. Will continue to come and eat here.

If you are looking for an interesting meal Bruxie is the place to go ! Don't just compare it to Roscoes because both places serve waffles. This place has it all (philly cheesesteak, egg, chicken, burger, etc.) all with waffles ! Could be a little pricey at times but most defenitely worth it. Good little date spot as well

Funny thing about this place. I saw it featured on Yelp a few weeks ago and thought it looked enticing so I decided to bookmark it. 蔛hortly after, my friends started talking about it and several people were checking in on FB so I had to see what the buzz is all about. It's located very close to one of my favorite areas in the OC, the roundabout on Chapman Ave. 蔍t's located in a nondescript neighborhood and resembles 1950s style hotdog and hamburger stands. 蔣ou order at the window and seat yourself outside. 蔜here were a lot of people when we came here on Saturday night but the turnover was quick. They serve a variety of breakfast/lunch/dessert waffles. 蔍 opted for the fried chicken waffle and vanilla cream soda with a side of waffle fries. 蔜he fried chicken waffle was decent, but nothing to write home about. 蔍t reminded me of Roscoe's in sandwich form but not quite as good. 蔄lso, you have to eat this fast b/c the waffle gets soggy very quickly. 蔍t really wasn't all that flavorful, even with the side of syrup I had to purchase for 50 cents. 蔜he waffle fries and vanilla cream soda were good but again, nothing especially amazing. 蔍 was expecting the chicken to taste a bit better but it wasn't all that memorable. �Overall, I wasn't that impressed with the food but it wasn't bad either. 蔜here are several other items on the menu that do look good, however. 蔍 would definitely go back to try a few more items. 蔜hey have a nutella waffle that I will be trying next time. 蔍 would eat a brick if it had nutella on it! 蔍 have a feeling I would like some of the other items more, but for now just 3 stars.

We split: Goat cheese and sun dried tomato sammich Cheesy bruxie with avocado and tomato Lemon and berry waffle All three were delicious! The waffles were super light. The sandwiches were filling but didn't leave us with a gross stuffed feeling...you know that feeling, right? I also had the Belgian hot chocolate. It was so yummy. Not crazy sweet, it was just right. I am definitely a fan!

For OC it's about par. When it comes to Chicken and Waffles.....this place can no way be compared with the Original Roscoe's Chicken and Waffles in South Central LA.(Normandie and Manchester) Bruxie's Chicken and Waffles couldn't hold a candle to Roscoe's Chicken Meat which is by far more superior. However all the other food is quite good. Love their home made sodas too. A lot of college kids here and the "UTES of AMERICA" dwell here. Parking can be terrible at times. Would go here again if in the area and maybe if we had outta town guests and took them to Old Town Orange. We had to give this place a go since we saw a review on it in the SO CAL Auto Club Magazine (Westways). So now we can say "Been there done it". Kinda miss the cheeseburgers, fries, and shakes that you could order here a couple years ago when it was a little Mom & Pop Burger joint serving the Chapman University Students across the street. Oh well..progress I guess.

Yelp was abuzz with the opening of Bruxie. Sandwiches with waffles as the bread? I'm in! I came on a weekend around lunch time. I expected a long line but there were only 5 groups of people ahead of me. Apparently those orders ahead of me were large because I didn't get my food until 40 minutes later. Ouch! Anyways onto the food. I ordered the fried chicken and waffles, the s'mores and the lemon berry and cream. The waffles on all three were very good. Nice crispiness to it and it tasted very light. Definitely not the heavy waffles that I usually eat. The fried chicken was pretty average. I expected something better. The chicken was pretty bland and the slaw wasn't very special. It was around 7 bucks. The other two waffle sammiches were better (around 6 bucks). The s'mores reminded me of the s'mores that I used to have when I was younger. Very tasty but how can you mess up chocolate and marshmallows? The lemon cream and berry was great. I expected the cream to be overpowering and too sweet but it definitely wasn't the case. It was lemony and had a nice amount of sweetness to it. Bottom line: very good waffles, good dessert waffles, pretty average chicken, prices are fair and there can be some long lines at certain times of the day. I'll definitely come back though. That lemon/berry crepe is a culinary masterpiece.

I order a Bruxie burger and thought its a normal burger. When the order came and i was shocking that there was waffle as bread but its still taste good. The service are fast enough for the standard. i Love the Nutella ,banana, and sweet cream on waffle, it taste so good. I love animals very much and its a friendly service for pets. there was a dog treat and dog water bowl.

I was on the area this past Saturday and decided to eat at this place and see what's it all about. Here is my take on this place: Decor - Very nice, It reminded me of the some the east coast eateries I've been too! Service - I didn't find any issues with it, it was what it was, get your order and move on the next customer. Food - I had ordered their cheese burger, and I must admit...It tasted plan, no flavor to it all. And for sure I would NOT order it again! that said, my wife had ordered the breakfast sandwich, which I tired a bit of it and I was very good! That said, if I'm ever in the area for some breakfast sandwich, I would stop by again for it. But I don't think I would go out of my way to go there again.

Chicken and waffle with a syrup dip? Uhm delicious. I like crave this place every other day. Parking is crap here. Permit parking everywhere i guess its because its in such close proximity to a university and they dont want students parking in their streets even though they have huge parking structures anyways. Thinh L. and i came here for lunch one day. a few days before my birthday. We also had the burger which was really good too. but im not sure if i liked the chicken more. because they were both so good. We had the rootbeer float and the strawberry float. both were so amazingly good i usually dont like floats. this is why i hate watching the rose parade. Just kidding. but this place makes me crave floats every week but i gotta watch my figure. We had the waffle fries and it was really savory as well. Maple syrup is an extra charge but really you dont need more than one. The service is real good. Just fin that parking spot and you are set.

I've never tried the fried chicken/waffle combo and never really understood the appeal. 蔍 figured Bruxie was the perfect place to sample this combination. I am glad I did! 蔍 split the chicken waffle with a friend who ordered the seasonal wild mushroom, sure that I would like that latter much better. 蔜o my surprise, I totally favored the chicken waffle. 蔜he addition of chili honey and coleslaw added a nice sweet/salty combination. �I love small, quaint food places and Bruxie definitely fits the description. 蔍n line they were handing out samples of custard, which was amazing. 蔜hey had heat lamps (which appeased my cold friends) and a outdoor tables and booth. �This has encouraged me to try other chicken n waffle delights, though Bruxie has set a high standard :)

I had the egg, cheese and bacon waffle with Maple Syrup and the nutella custard with bananas and added Strawberries. The waffle was amazing, I had forgotten all about it. It was crispy on the outside and chewy on the inside, just the way I like it. Adding the strawberries to the Nutella and bananas is a must... great stuff. All in all, I was very impressed, very content with the food and LOVED it! The only big bummer is the line, but the food comes out quick the moment you order so it didn't bother me! I can't wait to go back!

I never knew a waffle sandwich was such a wonderful creation until I came to this place with the boyfriend. 蔠e didn't have a place to sit because it was so crowded the first time I went, so we ended up parking our butts on the parking curb. 蔐uckily the store manager and chef came out and tried to find us a place to sit but we were so intoxicated with how good the food was, that we didn't mind parking it on the curb. 蔋e was so kind calling us "good sports" that he came out and gave us complimentary frozen yogurt. 蔍t was rich and creamy and really good! �My favorite savory is the prosciutto with gruyere cheese and the short rib with blue cheese waffle fries. 蔒y favorite sweet would be the lemon creme and berries. 蔜hey also have delicious pure cane sodas and awesome milkshakes. 蔍 can't believe the batter is super fluffy light! 蔍t's a good thing I don't live too close to this place, otherwise I would be here way too often. 蔍 can't eat a waffle any other way now. 蔍'm all about Bruxie's!

Anyone who has ever smashed 2 Eggos together for breakfast on their way to work/class can appreciate Bruxie. I have had awful luck trying to find a good waffle lately. Heck, it's hard to find *any* waffles at most breakfast joints these days. So it is a godsend to see a place dedicated to waffles. Yeah there's Roscoe's, but once you get over the novelty of it, they're just okay. Bruxies dominates anything and everything else. From their website and branding I expected to find a cafe or bistro type setting; it's more of a waffle stand than anything, prolly converted from an old timey burger joint. It's all outside seating with a walk-up counter, and seating can be tough, so claim what you can. Luckily the turn-around on your order is short, so you can get in and get out with little fuss. Bruxie's delicousness comes down to the waffle itself. It's crispy on the outside but not overly crunchy, and still soft and chewy on the inside. I would be happy with just that alone (and I was. The Brussels Waffle is simply butter, sugar, and optional Maple syrup; and it's perfect). We tried the Fried Chicken waffle, the Sun-Dried Tomatoes & Goat Cheese waffle, and the Waffle fries (which are essentially criss-cut fries). Then we (okay, just me. But I shared) went back and got the Apricot & Cream waffle and the aforementioned Brussels waffle. I was happy with em all. Okay, I would like a scosh more slaw on the chicken waffle, but the chicken was a generous piece, so who can complain. I'd go back and try the rest if my wallet could bear it. But if they were located any closer to me, I'd prolly go anyway.

Found this cute little place inside a AAA magazine review. It was great! The hubbs and I decided to try this place out since we were heading toward OC. Small place, but has outside patio seating. No bathrooms, so be prepared. The area itself is so quaint because it's close to Chapman University. It definitely has character. In terms of the food, it was pretty great. I had the green eggs and ham. Basically it was eggs with pesto. Pesto was DELICIOUS...nice herb and garlic taste that danced in my mouth. The waffle was warm and crisp. The hubbs got the chicken and waffle. It was good, but nothing compared to Roscoes...BUT a good substitute. NOT the best, but good enough. I wanted to try so many other things, but got full from my waffle sandwich. I also tried their cane sugar soda, which was wonderful, and tried their hot chocolate. It was good and pleasant! Service was wonderful. It seriously have a friendly/home feeling to the place. Everyone is so helpful and really great! Definitely want to come back!

Bruxie was a tremendous let down. 蔜he idea of a waffle sandwich is a good, albeit unoriginal one, I was making eggo sandwiches when i was nine, I expected a "gourmet" version to be delicious. After waiting for a few minutes in the line I promptly ordered the prosciutto and Gruyere sandwich. 蔍 paid the $6.50 and began the seemingly infinite wait for my food. Seriously, be prepared to wait for your food....it took forever, and like fools we went back and ordered some dessert and again....it took forever. 蔜he turn over is terrible. The sandwiches were good not great, my Gruyere was tasty and the prosciutto delicious. 蔜he mustard seed was a good accompaniment. 蔜he waffle was a bit soft somewhat blending in with the cheese/Gruyere and while not bad, i would have preferred more of a difference in texture. My friends had the burger one and said it was good but not great. 蔜hen we ordered the frozen custard and the nutella and banana. Frozen custard is the most boring "dessert" ive ever eaten. 蔍ts soft serve with no flavor at all...none...zero. 蔜he banana and nutella was another let down, the waffle was cold, soft, banana not very ripe, and the entire sandwich was filled with a very sour tasting cream. Bruxie has a good premise but the execution was a let down!

Why didn't I think of this! So I looked this place up and read all the great reviews. After a nice long hike on Saturday and antique shopping in orange we finally reached this place. Now mind you we were starving after the hike and the line is LONG here. There is no bathroom around so we had to walk to another place with a bathroom and then come back. Guess what the line was even LONGER!! OMG it is worth the wait though. The line is long but the staff there are very efficient. They first walked and handed everyone a menu so you can start to decide on what you want. Then they came back picked up the menu and wrote down your order on a ticket so when you get to the cashier you just pay. GOOD THINKING!!! My husband was bent on the Salmon with dill waffle sandwich and I couldn't choose between the wild mushroom and goat cheese and the buttermilk chicken waffle sandwich. So we decided to get all three. OMG delicious!!! All three and guess which one my husband liked the most???!!! The wild mushroom and goat cheese.... I gladly shared there was more than enough. I have to say all the sandwiches were absolutely fantastic. The waffles were crispy and soft not oily at all. The filling was all cooked to perfection so it is really up to what you feel like. You really cant go wrong. Their strawberry lemonade is sooo delicious!!!

The people are super friendly and are spot on when it comes to customer service!! :D I got the nutella&&bananas (minus the bananas, severely allergic to them) it came with this yummy cream and the strawberries were super fresh!! . Alexis got the salmon & dill cream cheese (YUCK)! she claims the waffle is too soggy for a savory filling! yeah right! :p . We got a strawberrry creme brulee waffle for my mom and frozen custard. And some intensely brewed iced tea (literally) . Everything was sooo yummy!! I can't wait to go back and try their grilled cheese with waffle fries!! I no longer have a wanting for crepes.

i was always a waffle over pancakes kind of gal so when i heard there was a place that seemed to share my love for waffles, my interest was picqued. Cute little spot on the corner with limited seating. 蔍 went on a rainy day so i was staring down patrons for their tables. 蔜he cashier was super nice and carried a whole conversation with me, but did not say a word to my guy friend. girls do have all the fun. i ordered the BRUXIE BURGER with waffle fries and my friend ordered the CHICKEN AND WAFFLE. 蔒y burger was so juicy and tender. I was blown away. The waffle was the right amount of crunchy and not too thick. 蔍 was able to finish my whole burger without the end getting soggy at all. 蔍 looked way happier eating mines than my friend did eating his. 蔍 wouldn't say the waffle fries are a must have. 蔜hey just taste like a healthier version of criss-cut fries. I am definitely going to go back to try their dessert waffles!!! I would definitely recommend others to go just because it's something different. 蔄 burger made with Eggo waffles would pale in comparison to Bruxie. so stop reading already and go try it:)

I will definitely come back here! The chicken and waffle is so delicious, especially with syrup on the side. 蔒y friend and I both got the chicken and waffle and shared criss cross fries. 蔜he sandwich itself is very filling, and I would not recommend trying to save it for left overs...the light texture of the waffle and crispness of 蕋he chicken are what make this sandwich so great. 蔍 would have wanted to try a shake or custard, but glad I didn't or else I would have been feeling the pain later. 蔜hey must be pretty good though because a lot of people were ordering them. My friend and I came here around 1pm on a Sunday afternoon, and there was a line. 蔜he line actually seemed to get longer closer towards 2pm. 蔕h well, waiting in line gave me enough time to run across the street to Chapman University to use the restroom. 蔣es, the down side is that they do not have restrooms on site. Next time I kind of want to try the burger (which is their second most popular), but if it's not as good as the chicken and waffle, I will be sad...

The difference between a good place to eat and a great place to eat? 蔍t all depends on the quality of the food, the service, and the desire to return left on your tongue yearning for more. 蔍 admit, when I first heard of this Belgian waffle sandwich, I was a bit of a skeptic. 蔍 said, how can a waffle be converted into something that is so everyday and ordinary? I was proven wrong. 蔜his isn't your everyday waffle. It's this euro-waffle mastered into fluffy-and-crispy at the same time with either savory or sweet fused perfection. 蔕ne bite and then another, and then another.. didn't take long before I was hooked. A group of us went in to get the best of it all by ordering different kinds. 蔠hat better way to really try out a menu then splitting many waffle sandwiches to try a little this, a little that? �The Prosciutto & Gruyere - Just the perfect amount of prosciutto coupled with the gruyere cheese gave it just the right bite. 蔐oved it. The Sun-Dried Tomatoes & Goat Cheese - wow, who knew arugula could be this good? 蔉lavors were harmonious together. Buttermilk Fried Chicken & Waffle - This is a must-try. 蔜heir number one seller. 蔇oes it kill your craving for Roscoes? 蔍t's different, but still delicious. Bruxie Burger - Juicy goodness, enough said. PB&J - well if you're just simple and have a pb&j craving, here you go. S'Mores - belgian chocolate coupled with graham cracker & toasted marshmallow yum. 蔍f you're thinking desserty, this isn't a bad one to try. Lemon Meringue - someone say secret menu? 蔵t had a surprising lemony kick upon first bite, but gets better afterwards. Softserve Frozen Custard - if you like plain vanilla custard but thick and creamy as heck, this will give you a mouthful of happiness. 蔍 wouldn't mind this on a hot day, OR cold (we're in Cali, it's never too cold for ice cream!) The service was above par. 蔉rom the guy who took our order, to the girl who brought our food, and to the co-founder Kelly for chatting it up with us and getting our feedback for the next potential hit item on their menu.. 蔄MAZING. 蔠hy don't all owners who open restaurants do this with their customers? 蔍n today's day and age, communicating with the customers and finding out what they really enjoy is pretty critical. 蔍 was thrilled they reached out and discussed their creations with us, afterall, we are the ones eating right? If you haven't been here before a couple things to note.. parking is minimal in the lot, but there is neighborhood parking just be sure NOT to park where it says permit only. 蔜his is located in cute Old Town Orange, one of the quaint areas of the OC. 蔖rices of waffle sandwiches range from the $5-$7 ballpark. 蔣ou order from a window and there is some seating outside and you can also order to-go. �Nothing a little toaster oven can't reheat once you get home.) 蔍 don't want to overhype it for you guys, so you should just go in and try it for yourself. 蔍'm not a waffle expert either, but it got me and that's why I'm giving it 5 stars.

The bf and I decided to try something different on Sunday, so we opted for Bruxie based on the reviews here. 蔠e were really glad we did! 蔜he line wasn't too horrible since it moved relatively quickly, and they kept a cooling mist going which which was nice on that July afternoon. 蔛eating is a little difficult to get, but if you're lucky, you'll find some like we did. The bf had the fried chicken & waffle which was pretty good. 蔜he chicken was really tasty, but a little dry without the syrup. 蔕verall, it's still a winner, though. 蔍 tried the roasted mushroom & goat cheese which was amazing! 蔛eriously. 蔜he flavors just went together flawlessly. 蔜hat alone is worth the wait all over again. For dessert, we had the lemon cream & berries which was also amazing. 蔜he cream had a lot of lemon flavor but was not overwhelming at all. 蔍t just went very well with the fresh berries. 蔄gain the waffles are perfectly made, light and do not outweigh what is inside them. 蔜heir strawberry lemonade was also very good. This is definitely a place worth trying out. �We did end up spending quite a bit, but it was worth it.

I have been trying to find a reason to venture out to the orange circle just so I can try out this place. 蔄las, an interview in Santa Ana was as close as I was going to get. 蔍've purposely scheduled my interview before lunch so I can be hungry and ready. You have to park on the street or the several public parking spots scattered throughout the circle. It may take some time specially during lunch hour. The line was long but it was moving. There are friendly workers that 蔭re there to help you while you are in line in case you have any questions. Seating is limited. I ordered the Smoked Salmon & the Prosciutto & gryuere waffle. Unfortunately, you can not do the half order of this with half order of that but you'll be glad you got whole ones though. I ate the whole smoked salmon one. I've been craving smoked salmon or lox for a while. 蔍 wish it could be a little more smokier but I love that the cucumbers were there. It makes it very refreshing. The Prosciutto one was ok, I ended up waiting to eat it when I got home so it was already cold and the waffle was soggy by that time.

Divide and conquer - that's what my friends and I did with their one of a kind menu. The waffles are perfection and complement each filling like it was meant to be. Waffle sandwiches. I don't even like waffles, but had to give this place was a try. And we've been back again...and again...and again. The creators are ingenious. The fried chicken and waffles kicks Roscoe's ass. There's a crunch in every bite from the sweet but not too sweet honeyed coleslaw and moist battered chicken. The prosciutto and Gruyere is gourmet ham-n-cheese. The waffle burger was delicious and satisfying down to the very last bite. And I would have their egg, bacon, and cheese waffle just about any time of day - it was that good. Need I go on? Everything on their menu is a must try! The place loses one star for not enough seating and because one of the servers said to my friend "yes, we messed up your order - but you're going to have to wait in line and order and pay again." 蔍 didn't think that was the correct way to handle that. Otherwise, this place is bomb!

The concept of Bruxie is great .... The location, not so great as well as seating, but hey, in most situations where a restaurant is popular as this, I'm not surprised so I'm not knocking them off for anything like that. I had a friend in town visiting so I took my guests and cousin here to give this a try. The line wasn't bad, I believe I waited about 10 minutes and fortunately made my cousin sit down immediately to grab us a seat. They had a special the day of which was wild mushroom waffle with goat cheese and a balsamic reduction in which I ordered. They also offer waffle fries, and not only do they offer savory waffles, but sweet ones and for breakfast as well. They also had shakes but I was too full already to give that a try, I did indeed see another patron order one and I wanted to just steal it out of his hands :(. My cousin went with the bacon, egg, and tilamook cheddar waffle, and friend went with the liege waffle with lpowdered sugar. WIld Mushroom with Goat cheese & Balsamic - I loved the texture of the waffle, it's a mixture in between an actual waffle itself and bread, soft and doughy, yet with a crisps. Unfortunately the wild mushrooms were basic button mushrooms and baby portobello's, I honestly was expecting an array so I was pretty disappointed. The goat cheese was delicious but the balsamic glaze was overly tart. Bacon, egg, & tillamook cheddar - My cousin enjoyed her waffle, although she said the egg was quite overcooked and chewy. She did enjoy the bacon and compliments of the tillamook cheddar that gave it a sharp taste. She just couldn't get over the fact that the egg was a bit rubbery, poor girl. Liege waffle - You can't really go wrong with a waffle drenched in syrup as well as powdered sugar. Her waffle came out a bit too crisp and so wasn't able to enjoy that soft and fluffy waffle as I did mine. Food did not take long to come out in which I really appreciate, the prices are more than affordable, I believe I paid 30 bucks for three waffles and two orders of fries to feed us all. Can't beat prices like that especially for a popular place as this. I will give this place a try on other items that they offer before I fully close them off at a 3, still having hope.

This place is seriously TOO overhyped and overpriced! It's a cool concept to smush sandwichs and waffles together and it's pretty good, but I feel I can just make it at home. I had the berry waffle with lemon curd and that was yummy. The waffle was warm and crispy on the outside and soft on the inside. The lemon curd was just sour enough to balance out the sweet berries. However, that one waffle did not fill me up. It was more of a snack. But $10 for a snack?? A bit splurgy. I tried my cousin's smores waffle and that was good too, but it was a bit burnt. I guess it was SUPPOSED to taste a tiny bit burnt like a real smore, but mehhh. I also tried his fried chicken waffle as well. It was alright. Nothing super special. Actually, it was kinda dry... Overall, I recommend this place just to try it, but I, myself, would not come back here again unless one of my friends wanted to come here.

Bruxie truly brings out a whole new level of Chicken and waffles. 蔕f course they are not limited to ONLY chicken and waffles with their assorted menu of smoked salmon or s'mores dessert waffles. I enjoyed my visit here even though I came when it was raining. 蔜here is no indoor seating because it is more of a grab and go sort of restaurant. 蔜here are tables and chairs but a limited amount so don't expect to have enough seats when coming in a large group. 蔍t's not your everyday Roscoe's Chicken and Waffles. 蔍t's a huge change, but a very good change with how tasty it is. The seating may be weird and limited, but the food is amazing. 蔍 ordered the buttermilk waffle and chicken which was what the employee recommended. 蔋e was really helpful with his recommendations and really helped out with my selection for the night. The waffle was light and had a nice crisp to the outer shell, but not overly crispy. 蔍nside the waffle was a tender golden piece of chicken a little bit of light coleslaw. 蔖ersonally I am not a fan of coleslaw, but it was so light that I actually enjoyed the presence of the coleslaw. 蔄fter the main course, I opted for a dessert s'more waffle. 蔜he chocolate and marshmallow was melted very nicely within the waffle and adding in the fluffy waffle, it made for one amazing dessert. Overall, worth a drive once in awhile and even more worth it if you're in the area often. 蔍f I lived closer, I would come and eat quite often.

I'm not usually a fan of waffles, but I was in the area and I had to just try it because my coworker raved about it. 蔍 had the fried chicken and waffle and my friend had the special of the day: proscuitto hash with egg and gruyere cheese. 蔕MG, I can't stop thinking about it and I'm pretty depressed that I moved back to the bay area. 蔊uess I'll have to make my way down to Orange or find an alternative up here. �If you go before 1130, there isn't usually a wait. 蔋owever, by the time we were finished with our meal, there was a long line and people were starting to eat standing up. 蔍 wish I had known about this place a lot sooner so I could try their sweet waffles.

This place popped up all of the sudden. 蔍t used to be some kind of a dilapidated teriyaki place, but now it's spruced up & teeming with Hipsters & college students. 蔍 spoke with Kelly, one of the owners, and he told me the building was built in 1939 and was originally a Dairy Queen type of deal. 蔋e suggested the burger and it was GREAT. 蔍'm a big proponent of using waffles as buns. I brought some friends back the following week, and they were blown away, also. 蔒y buddy Jeremy & I split the fried chicken & the cheesy with ham & tomatoes...this is gonna be in our rotation for sure.

When I heard they were tearing down Dairy Treet, a staple (but sadly a run down one) in the Orange Circle, I was skeptical. But the minute I tried this new "waffle" place I kept hearing about that replaced it, I was hooked. I don't think they have a bad waffle sandwich on the menu, whether it be sweet or savory. The waffle with cheese and avocado and Turkey Reuben (when they have it) are my personal favorites: just the right amount of filling without making you feel over stuffed. The waffle fries are also a great side to add to your meal. Not as salty as you would think they would be though so if you're wanting salt-filled McDonalds-like fries, I wouldn't order them. They're natural cane sodas are also really good. I was a die hard Coke fan for many years until I cut it out of my diet but the sodas they have here are actually much better and use real cane sugar (plus they have some fun flavors). During the summer they have all things strawberry which are FANTASTIC. The Strawberry Shake, Strawberry Dreams float or the Strawberry Creme Brulee. I will take D) all of the above. This place is packed quite often, even when the nearby college is out for the summer so be prepared for a wait. The staff is very friendly and will come around and make sure to answer any questions you might have about the menu though while you wait and let me say...it is well worth the wait. I definitely hope this place is around for a long time to come.

I always admire restaurateurs who take risks and create their own niche, instead of compete in an existing cutthroat space. And this place is 1 of those winners. My fiancee Jennifer told me about this spot, touting the whole "chicken and waffles" combination sandwich. The only exposure I had of that mix was Roscoe's Chicken & Waffles, but this place was nothing like it. Not as ghetto, lighter food, and of course, a closer drive. For the win. We came during dinner rush, and although there was a huge, cult-like line, the cashiers cranked the line out pretty quickly. Impressive. I ordered the mushroom waffle sandwich, Jen ordered the smoked salmon sandwich (or maybe it was the other way around...whatever), and my future brother-in-law ordered the Bruxie Burger. My fave is the Bruxie Burger - although a bit heavy - the waffle bun worked. For mine and Jen's sandwich...to be honest, I couldn't taste the waffle bun much - which makes the extra calories wasted - but it was delicious overall. It was light, and you can tell they use high-quality ingredients. Also - we ordered the California strawberry shake - a limited time offering, but really, really good. Real strawberry chunks, and I think they mix it with frozen yogurt. A good complement to the meal. The service was fast and the delivery people were very nice, although brief. I don't expect much since it's a quick-service place. They keep the place very clean too, for being a crowded spot. The only con I have about the place is that the parking is the worst thing ever. Be prepared to drive around for quite some time, or park far, far away and making the walk. There's also limited seating, but that doesn't bug me too much - they make it so you can take the food for a walk around Old Town Orange, or take it home. This place is nicely designed- and it looks like they built it with franchising in mind for the near future. It was a total coincidence later on that the creator of the menu used to be an executive at my restaurant development firm, Fransmart. That's kinda cool! I'd go here again if I was conveniently in the area. Jen craves it, but I think it's good enough to visit again without dreaming about it.

My sister and I made it here for breakfast two days in a row - we split two sandwiches, the prosciutto & guyere and the wild mushroom & goat cheese - and then, if that weren't enough at 9:30 in the morning, wolfed down really the latest crowning joy discovery of our dessert lives, liege waffles. Someday, perhaps at a more reasonable hour to eat this much (although I just heard in the Philippines their biggest meal is breakfast to power through the day ahead, so hey maybe they know what they're doing) milkshake and short rib waffle, you will also be mine. The waffles are just as light and tasty and buttery as advertised, and they also came with SO much cheese. Some part of my newly-lactose-intolerant self whimpered while the more aggressive fat-kid part pushed it down on the playground and gobbled it up - while I was driving, no less. The liege waffle could be a little sweeter and softer, it's a bit like a hockey puck - it's also come a little burned both times - and the cup of chocolate sauce they give you has the same consistency as those Yan-Yan chinese snacks (you know what I'm talking about... or you can google i s'pose), so I still prefer the giant Syrup (in LA) ones, but this'll do in the county of Orange. Oh, and their waffle fries are extra crispy and taste just like salt & pepper Kettle chips. I'm pretty jealous of the Chapman students - so much great food and interesting shops within walking distance. Long live Bruxie.

I am so in love with Bruxie! There was one week where I went three times in a row. I've tried a variety of their sandwiches but have not yet tried any of their sweet offerings. Their buttermilk fried chicken sandwich is by far the best chicken waffle sandwiches I have ever had. The sweet honey chili sauce is such a great complement to the slightly spicy chicken. HOLY COW their irish nachos are AMAZING. I don't know if it's a regular on the menu but it was written on the special's board on one of the days I went. Waffle fries with sour cream, cheese, BACON....like a baked potato nacho delight. It was so amazing. Their sodas are also a treat here. I don't usually drink any sodas but this place is an exception. Their sugar cane soda pops are so worth it. I've never had much trouble finding parking or a place to eat when I'm at Bruxie. PRETTY BOSS.

Every time I go here, I always order the same ones because they're so good I can't get over it! Special menu: Strawberry Creme Brulee. must eat it right when you get it because it will get soggy and it won't be so good.

Not bad! Ordered the chicken waffle sandwich but the waffle started to get soggy from the cole slaw and fell apart when I tried to eat it. Taste was predictable, fried chicken in a waffle. Fries were GOOD! This is the way everyone should be making fries! Nice crunch on the outside and seaming hot melt in your mouth potato on the inside. Perfectly seasoned. Lemon cream and berries were over the top fantastic. 蔔ot too sweet, perfect combination of cream, strawberries, and blackberries. They kept messing up our order so they brought a complementary smores waffle. 蔞ery sweet but good none the less. �Will be going back to try the rest of the menu.

We were pleasantly greeted by the chef himself, who handed us each a menu and explained that he's from Belgium and the waffles here are light, crispy and not sweet. Got the Buttermilk Fried Chicken and Waffle with the chili honey on the side (to mitigate getting a soggy waffle). Topped the meal off with the Nutella and Bananas Waffle for dessert. Pure goodness...you just can't go wrong with Nutella! Washed it down with hot jasmine green tea. 蔕verall, this is a nice casual place in Old Towne Orange for great food and fast, good service. For first timers, this place is a stand with outdoor seating only. No parking lot--only street parking. We came here on a Sunday and got lucky with a parking spot right across the street. Just want to set expectations. ;-)

i'm sitting here eating the fried chicken and waffle sandwich! We were in downtown Orange so we thought we would grab something to go. I've heard people say that it's amazing to here are my thoughts. Two menus - savory and sweet. Since it was for dinner, I decided against the sweet... The chicken and waffle sandwich is kind of like a Roscoe's sandwich. The waffle serves as the "bread" with the fried chicken in the middle. Then in the sandwich they add cole slaw and a spicy honey. The waffle is baked just right; the chicken is moist and tender. Overall, it's really good! It's not like eating Roscoe's but it's really good. I think I might try a different sandwich when I go down again. The one thing is that I brought it home so it was lukewarm. Probably it would have been better if I ate it right on the spot.

I will keep it short, but I came here for the first time last night and damn it was good. I had the chicken and waffle sandwich without syrup and just... wow. It was damn good. The chicken was very moist and tasty, and even though I was a bit taken back that the waffle wasn't sweet like I was used to it was a welcome departure. The lack of sweetness from the waffle complimented the chicken just perfectly, and the honey they served with the sandwich just worked beautifully. My vanilla cream soda was the perfect drink too! I will be back to sample more. The line wasn't too bad either! Yes there was a line, but it moved rather quickly!

My girlfriend and I came here last night for the first time. The buttermilk chicken is to die for!! you can get waffle fries (crisscut fries) for an additional $2 (so worth it!). The line seemed huge when we first got there, but the staff was very speedy and took our orders ahead of time while we were in line. The major challange at this restaurant is finding seating/tables. Its very crowded and seating is limited. Togo is preferred. We ordered the rootbeer they have there.....Loved the food, didn't really like the soda. It tasted like something between regular and diet (yuck!). If you've tried Roscoe's Chicken n Waffle, then you're gonna love this place!

Boyfriend was craving some chicken & waffles so we yelped good places for chicken & waffles and this place popped up! Score! It's closer than LB and it seems to have fantastic reviews. Hopped in the car to drive down to Orange. Passed by the store and was surprised at how much people were waiting outside. Didn't have a problem finding parking, even though it was a Sunday afternoon, although it was 2pm so maybe that's why. While we waited in line, this nice gentleman, gave us menus to look at and since it was our first time eating at Bruxie he told us a little about what makes Bruxie's waffles so special, they use all natural yeast. Yeast in waffles!? How very bread-like but I guess its what makes the waffles so light and fluffly! =] We ordered the chicken & waffles, prosciutto & gruyere (with cucumbers), waffle fries, root beer & chocolate shake. I wanted to mix vanilla and chocolate shake and the cashier told us that chocolate shake is just vanilla with chocolate syrup so having vanilla and chocolate is just less chocolate.. hahaha.. oh, sorry, I didn't know.. I'll just have the chocolate shake then. =P the chicken & waffles was the star. It was fantastic and I would come back and eat it again. The waffle fries were good but they give you so little for $2. =( The prosciutto & gruyere was alright. I wouldn't order it again. Root beer was great. It was lightly sweet. The chocolate shake is really sweet but it's really good. Although, I don't know, I can't really drink that much sweetness at times, so it became too much for me. All in all, it was a great sunday lunch and I would definitely come back again. =]

The waffles are not your typical breakfast type waffle. �Don't go expecting Roscoes quality taste cause this is a whole different, yet equally delicious beast. The sandwich creations are unique and fun, and they often put out new specials. The chicken and waffles are solid (but I'll take my Roscoe's any day). instead, I'd recommend trying their Salmon and Dill waffle sandwich with a cream cheese schmear. Couple that with their waffle fries and an old-fashioned soda and that's a quality meal. Just go early cause the line can get stupid.

It's hard to believe it's only been four months since Bruxie opened and that the core goodness (of the food) that led to it's meteoric rise hasn't waned one bit. We come here frequently, and more often than not the chicken and the cow are up on the block. That fried chicken, where to begin? It's always been crisp and hot, never once been greasy or soggy. It's treated with a drizzle of (mildly) spicy honey syrup that complements the battered chix and adds a kick. Slaw is applied for good measure, light on the mayonnaise, it adds a creamy aspect and the cabbage a cooling crunch. It takes chickn' n' waffles to a new level I tell ya' and won't leave you feeling sticky of heavy. The burger, another favorite of many myself included, is a great take on a classic. It's a well made traditional burger, but the use of the waffle, crisp and slightly sweet, gives it a whole new structure and texture. You'll just have to try it to see, but it's akin to the first time I had a burger on an english muffin, game changer! Those are your must haves, and once done you can effectively "pass go." The prosciutto and gruyere is a classic pairing and a lighter meal than the others. The wild mushroom is well done too. There has only been one that left me a little flat. The current and long running seasonal special of braised short rib, I thought, needs something. That something is acid. The parts are well done, short rib is tender and juicy, braised very well. The crisp potatoes were just that. The jus included on the side was well made. But in the end it all tasted very "brown." If it had a contrasting flavor (balsamic, red wine, or even carrot for the sweetness) it would just set that otherwise OK sandwich off. The Belgium fries are a must. Don't call 'em waffle fries or you'll stand corrected (literally). So are the cane sugar sodas. And lastly that brings us to the FROZEN CUSTARD. It was the first thing I had from Bruxie on a cold November evening. Dean, one of the co-owners was standing out front greeting customers and answering questions, as they still do to this day. We chatted briefly about the Midwest, Chicago food offerings, as well as frozen custard and then it came. The best way I can describe it is halfway between overrun ice cream & gelato. Not too creamy, not too rich, and with a slight hint of egg yolk. It's just awesome and should be tried. HINT: Parking can be a little challenging especially on saturday afternoons, but it's a great downtown scene overall so don't be afraid park a ways off and stroll up to Bruxie.

Waffle sandwiches! 蔊ENIUS! I heard of this place through a friend after we had gone to LA for Liege Waffles at Shaky Alibi in Los Angeles. 蔜he Liege waffle at Shaky Alibi is better than Bruxie's, but Shaky Alibi is far and their waffle is tiny and not worth the money or the long drive. But l love Bruxie's sandwiches! 蔜he chef was standing outside, greeting customers, and he helped me with my order. 蔍 asked him what he recommended for a vegetarian and he said the seasonal mushroom vs. the sundried tomato and goat cheese were basically the same, but he recommended the mushroom. �So I ordered their seasonal special the Wild Mushroom savory sandwich (wild mushrooms, goat cheese, arugula, reduced balsamic vinegar) and it was deRish! 蔜he sandwich ingredients alone make it a winner sandwich, 蔮ut the ingenious idea of using a folded waffle for the bread is so unique! 蔜he waffle isn't sweet and I think biting into a waffle is a lot easier and more delightful with a light crispiness and warm fluffiness all in one bite. 蔍 was surprised my sandwich stayed together and didn't get soggy -- maybe it was because I ate my sandwich too quickly before it had the chance to fall apart! �My friend got the Bruxie Burger and he liked his sandwich as well. I didn't love their Liege waffle mainly because it came out chewy and the sugar pearls were barely there (very little crunch). 蔜he Liege waffle at Shaky Alibi is crispier, with their speculoos spread definitely more suiting as compared to Bruxie's side of nutella. At first I was afraid of trying out this place on a rainy day since I read reviews about it being outdoor seating. 蔍t is all outdoor, but the benches closer to the kitchen are enclosed in those tents with vinyl windows and canvas walls. 蔜here are heat lamps so it wasn't a problem at all. 蔜here is a private lot, but there's only parking for about 2-3 cars. 蔣ou can easily find free 2 hour street parking, especially since Bruxie is about 2 blocks north of the more crowded center of Old Towne Orange roundabout. �Waffle sandwiches -- such an interesting concept and I think it works. 蔍'd give them 5 stars if I wasn't so disappointed with the Liege waffle.

First of all...yes, a restaurant that specializes in waffle sandwiches exists. Not only that, but Bruxie, located in the City of Orange, also has frozen custard, sundaes, floats, and shakes. With so many sweet and savory options, the difficult part was figuring out what to order from the extensive menu... Bruxie, which opened in late 2010, was a fun place to try, but I worry that it's the restaurant equivalent to Chumbawamba's "Tubthumping" - with each visit, does it become more and more forgettable? And how often can people consume these caloric nuclear bombs? (Then again, the students from nearby Chapman College - presumably, the restaurant's target audience - aren't worried about that.) Everything I had was mouth-watering, but it was also gimmicky, and I don't know how that will play into Bruxie's staying power. A waffle, after all, is still at its best with warm maple syrup melting through a thick layer of butter. But, damn, that fried chicken and waffle sandwich was amazing...worth trying at least once for us older, more health-conscious folks. For more, check out my blog at: http://www.phileatsla.com

I have been coming here since they opened. Their menu is unique and the food is very tasty, but lately it seems that they are pre-making the waffles and/or entrees so they do not arrive hot and fresh. We ordered the salmon and dill waffle (excellent) and the fried chicken waffle (their specialty and most popular). While I appreciate how fast their services is, this is the second time I've been here in a month and had the same issue with the food arriving barely warm. Their staff is excellent and their awesome attitude greatly appreciated.

Been wanting to try this place since it got great reviews by the LA Times. Needless to day, I was not disappointed. First, the Buttermilk Fried Chicken was a great marriage of chicken and waffles. The cole slaw in the sandwich played a muted role as did the honey dressing. The sandwich really came alive when we topped it with the maple syrup (50 cents more) and hot sauce. Second, the Smoked Salmon and Dill savory waffle was refreshing. The cucumber, dill, and cream cheese were good. This would be a great sandwich with afternoon tea. I read good reviews about the waffle fries, but thought they tasted okay with nothing to rave about. Lastly, dessert was the nutella and banana waffle which tasted good. Much better than the crepe version which is so passe. (Heck, what doesn't taste good with nutella on it?) Next time, I'd love to try the lemon creme and berry waffle. The waffles were thin, so I wasn't overstuffed after 3-half sandwiches. The owners were super friendly. I LOVED how they would come out and talk with customers. You can feel their pride in ownership which is very refreshing to see. I had a great experience at Bruxie. With nothing over $8, the experience is well worth the trip.

I can only give 4 stars beause this has been my only experience in a gourmet waflle shop so I have nothing to compare it to. Maybe one day a trip to the waffletruck in new york is in order. Came here with my friend from LAX to go to The Bruery Provisie store and was pleasantly surprised to find Peanut Butter and Jelly waffles, Chicken and Waffles, Steak Sammiches and waffles...lots and lots of waffles :) They are delicious...cheap...perfect after drinks food. I wish there were more of them and open 24 hours. The service is spectacular as well :)

Loved this spot! It was featured in the AAA magazine which I read over the weekend. I work close to here so decided to pop over for lunch. I was a bit worried that there would be a huge line or crowd... but it wasnt bad at all. I ordered the Bacon, egg and cheese and my friend ordered the Wild mushroom, arugala, goat cheese and balsamic reduction.... we shared 1/2 and 1/2. They were both super yummy. The waffle is not sweeted and is light and crispy. I enjoyed them both, but I think i preferred the mushroom one as the egg one just tasted like breakfast... I am going back in 2 days to try some others as well as a sweet one. Notes: Street parking... make sure to read the signs... small area of outdoor seating. + free WIFI. GO HERE!

So I finally got to try the waffles at Bruxie tonight with my sister and my friend. 蔠e've been hearing about it and I LOVE waffles. 蔍t was a little chilly tonight so it was so nice to see that they now have an awning and awning walls around the tables and chairs with the heat lamps. �We came at a good time around 5pm on a Sunday night (day after Christmas), so there wasn't many people there. 蔍'm assuming if you went at lunch time on a nice day it would be crazy crowded and parking would be horrible. 蔐uckily, I didn't have any problems parking or dealing with lines. 蔣AH! 蔄nyway, we ordered and it came in about 5-10 minutes. 蔉aster than I expected. 蔜he workers were all extremely friendly and helpful. �I ordered the sun dried tomato and goat cheese waffles. 蔍t was extremely flavorful with their basil flavored goat cheese and the added arugula. 蔜he waffles were just right...crispy on the outside and fluffy on the inside. �My sister got the buttermilk fried chicken and waffles with a side of maple syrup. 蔜he chicken was temperature hot when we first got it, but after it cooled down a bit, she was able to taste all the flavors. 蔍 got to take a couple of bites and it was a great combo of savory, sweet, crunch and soft. �My friend got the prosciutto and gruyere cheese waffles and that was very tasty with the saltiness of the prosciutto and the creaminess of the gruyere cheese. We then decided to share the lemon curd and berries waffle for dessert. 蔜hat was amazing. 蔐ove the tartness of the lemon curd with the combo of the berrries. 蔊reat with the texture of the waffles. My mouth still wanted to try more so I ordered the S'Mores waffles. 蔕MG! 蔍 love S'mores because i love the combo of toasted marshmallows, chocolate and graham crackers. 蔠hen I first took a bite, I was really impressed with the real toasted marshmallow flavor of the fluff. 蔕ne of the workers said that they make their own marshmallow fluff from scratch and then use a butane burner to toast it. 蔛o good. 蔜hen the combo of the gooey chocolate and the graham cracker crumbs in there was just perfect. 蔍 loved it!!!!!!!! 蔍 ate half and saved the rest for later. 蔠ell, later didn't last long because I ate the rest in like a half and hour. �Overall, this was a great experience. 蔍 hope to come back and try some more. 蔜his is definitely a great place I would recommend to others. 蔔ot a lot of seating, but I knew that coming there. 蔆ome for something casual and a fun experience trying new things.

Waffle Burgers~! 蔔eed I say more? 蔄n interesting place, even if it midly peaks one's interest. 蔜hey have savory and dessert-y. 蔠affle-cut fries~ 蔇id I mention the angus beef waffle burger w/ tomatoes, pickle, lettuce, all over a crispy crunchy, airy, light, not-at-all-doughy, awesomey waffle? 蔍 think the patty coulda been seasoned a bit better (salt n pepper) but it was quite good. My friend got the egg-cheese-bacon waffle and said it was good. 蔜hey also have sodas w/ real cane sugar. 蔆offee is also served here and it seems to be popular: I see many people get it. The staff is friendly and helpful. 蔖arking can get dicey. 蔛eating is limited. 蔐ines can get long during peak hours but it goes pretty efficiently. Are you still reading this? 蕐ou shoulda been out the door when i said WAFFLE BURGER!!!

Place is pretty boss. I went here a while back and was blown away on how good it was. The prices weren't too bad and it was pretty filling. I remember getting the chicken and waffles which were nice and tender, not dry. Big plus. My friend got the bruxie burger if I remember correctly and all I can say was holy smokes it was good when i jacked a bite. Would come back again. Only thing is that the place gets packed so parking can be a hassle. Be careful not to park residential or face a 60 dollar ticket.

we found the waffle place!! 蔵t's more like a stand but there are many tables outside. 蔭 lot of people order to go. the line is full of college students. 蔵t's cute that they are freshmen...you can totally tell!! �..haha...cuz they look 15!! basically, these sandwiches use waffle instead of bread for sandwiches. ordered: buttermilk fried chicken & waffle -- tasted like a normal chicken sandwich ��蕎ith some coleslaw pulled pork -- the special of the day! 蔰efinitely better than the chicken & ��蕎affle. 蔯ame with a light bbq sauce. 蕎e also added tapatio. it's too bad we were full after sharing two waffle sandwiches. 蔯uz i wanted to try a sweet waffle. �on the list for next time...bruxie burger and smores waffle.

Cute set up, it's just an old burger stand with a few tables. 蔖arking and seating is a little limited. 蔍 want to go back and try one of their dessert waffles, but the fried chicken waffle sandwhich I had was damn tastey. Great, kitschy sort of place to hang out and grab a quick bite. 蔅eware though, all the seating is outdoors and even though they have heat lamps, it still got a bit chilly!

Was super excited to try this place out...the idea of stuffed waffle sounds interesting...and I gotta say...its ooookaay...I will not be craving this in the middle of the night anytime soon. I had salmon waffle, but we also ordered fried chicken and lemon fruit one. Out of all 3 the fruit one was the best, but it is typical waffle... :( on the other hand, service was great...it is in a great location...seating was outside, and it rained...fml...but that doesn't happen too often in Ca. oh, hot chocolate was good!! not too sweet, not too hot, not too bitter...it was perfect...

Located right across the street from the Chapman University this place was so crowded when I was driving by and had to park across the street in the residential area. After waiting in line for about 20 minutes in the HOT burning sun ... ask me whether if the Fried Chicken Waffles was worth it? Yes! I think it was worth it. Probably not the sunburn ... but as far as uniqueness of the food goes, absolutely. Sodas are made from sugar cane so it will taste really different. If you are not too hung up by time and have the time and leisure to wait in line and possibly may not end up with a seat, and OK with eating your food while standing!~ then, this place is certainly worth a try. I probably won't be going there just for this.. but since I was in the area... it wasn't a bad choice at the time. Oh! make sure you get the $1extra 蕇yrup with your waffle.

I had heard nothing but good things about this place and decided one night that I needed to see what the deal was. My boyfriend got the Lemon Creme and Berries and I got the PB&J .. He liked his and I ABSOLUTELY LOVED mine! I got strawberry jam with mine and it was nothing less than perfect. The waffle was crispy and yet fluffy inside. We got the chocolate shake which I was not a fan of but my boyfriend said I was crazy and it was amazing .. maybe I just was too into my PB&J to notice the greatness. aLso we got the waffle fries which were good but its a super small order and not worth the money .. Then we returned a couple DAYS later and he tried the Smores and Liege waffles and I got the same (creature of habit) PB&J that I had the few days before .. I was just as happy and he was loving the Nutella topping for his Liege waffle. He and I were not too impressed witht he Smores waffle, thinking it was missing something. not sure what .. Both times we got the sodas and they are alright .. nothing too special but good .. Pricing is definitely high and the parking SUCKS!!!! but I will still stop by here once in a while for a delicious treat. The customer service was TOP NOTCH .. they call you by name when your order is ready and they bring it to you if you find a seat near the heaters. They also are not annoyed to explain what each waffle is or to give suggestions. Every single employee was friendly and they made sure you were satisfied with your order.

This place is amazing! I would go here everyday if it wasn't such a hassle to drive to this place and find parking. Everything is delicious! And I would know, I bought one of each waffle and took them home. I had a very scientific waffle sandwich tasting with my little sister, and we could find no faults in any of them. Maybe that there's never enough chili honey and coleslaw in the fried chicken waffle. But still so good!

Such a novel idea, a stand full of waffle sandwiches! 蔜he problem for me is that I'm not a huge fan of their waffles, the very base of the idea! 蔍t tastes of raw flour with an ample amount of sugar with the texture of a hard sponge that somehow soaked up every drop of grease off a counter placed next to a fryer. 蔣ou get a choice of either a savory waffle sandwich, in which case my sandwich of choice was the prosciutto and mustard because the salt from the pork and the tanginess of the mustard help cut the pure grease flavor from your palette; or a sweet waffle sandwich. 蔍 have endured through the berries with lemon custard the best because there's just too much sugar for me in the rest of their sweet options. 蔜he flavors are just too overwhelming and rich for me. 蔛ugar and fat sound tasty, I know, but there can definitely be too much of a good thing...

I can't speak to the savory waffles, I'm gonna try those on my next trip. My review is based solely on the sweet waffle (IT HAS FRICKEN SUGAR PEARLS COOKED INTO IT!!!!) and the soda. I got the waffle with nutella, I would have been happier if they'd covered the whole thing in nutella for me, but as it happens, it was a sort of tiny little plastic cup of nutella. Barely enough, but it was still delicous. if it hadn't been for the FRICKEN SUGAR PEARLS! i would have been disappointed. As for the soda, I'm a total soda freak. I love cane sugar sodas. I'm not sure who exactly makes their craft soda, but it's on tap, it's all sorts of organic goodness, and I love it. I believe I read it's made locally, but I'm not 100% sure. I'm going back for the prosciutto and gruyere.

I've driven by this place a couple times while visiting Chapman University and just this past time, stopped at a stop sign right before Bruxie's corner, I saw a glimpse of a couple words: waffle, the bold fold. WHAT?! I thought? Yelp perusing it is! My boyfriend and I came by on a Saturday night unsure of how crowded it would be, being right across from a University and in a downtown like area. The area around Chapman University is seriously DARLING, especially right now as it is decorated for Christmas. For those of you familiar with Redlands University in the Inland Empire, this area is just like Redlands U./Downtown Redlands. We pulled up and there were about 3 parking spaces in the back, so check to see if those are filled before finding street parking. We knew what we both wanted right away: The Buttermilk Waffle Sandwich. The girl "waiting" or bringing the food to each table from the cute little shack was super sweet and asked each table how they liked their food and even apologized for unsatisfied dishes, would bring them back and bring out a suggested dish equivalent to the last. SUCH great customer service and not expected for a small place like this. Our waffle sandwiches came out and the waffle squares were smaller than I had imagined (not a big deal, just a detail) and the sandwich was filled with a large piece of buttermilk fried chicken, and coleslaw like cabbage. The sandwich was such a great mix of flavors and the light fluffy waffle, crunchy chicken and crisp coleslaw made for a perfect warm dinner on a winter night. We also got the waffle fries which were super tastey, a little on the salty side, but we liked it! We then got the creamsicle float- orange soda with vanilla frozen yogurt - YUM, and a nutella banana waffle - explanatory - nutella makes anything amazing. Overall it was a good experience, we brought our dog which everyone was really friendly to, so don't hesitate to bring your cute canine friends. There is only outdoor seating so you can't go wrong. The only thing I would change is that the food was a tad overpriced for the idea of what we were eating. BUT I do say, that it was super creative, tastey, well presented and the customer service was awesome!

I tried the Smoked Salmon and Dill Cream Cheese Waffle sandwhich. 蔵t was flavorful. 蔴owever, i did expect the waffle would be served warm. i would go back because I did see some other items on the menu i really wanted to try, like the nutella and banana waffle. Service was excellent. 蔜his Bruxie is located in a very cute old townish area. 蔵 really liked the area. There was hardly anywhere to park, there were 3 spaces in the Bruxie lot and street parking. There were enough outdoor tables for the 11:30-ish lunch crowd.

The set-up of this place kind of reminded me of the Falafel Drive in at San Jose. 蔍 had the prosciutto and gruyere waffle sandwich, and my boyfriend had the chicken and waffles. The waffle itself is crisp and not oily which i really appreciated. 蔄nd surprisingly it pretty good with the chicken (it was my first time trying chicken and waffles). 蔜he chicken had a slight sweetness to it, which reminded me of maple syrup.

Came on a friday for lunch and expected a fat line. I was surprised to see that there were only 3 people ahead of us. I ordered the wild mushroom since it was on their seasonal menu and an order of irish nachos another item on the seasonal menu. My friend ordered a bruxie burger. We both came here with low expectations because we didn't want to be disappointed. However this place does live up to the hype sorta. Everything was delicious. My wild mushroom waffle was pretty well made. All the flavors melded very well and the waffle added a nice crunch. The Irish nachos were very filling and very heavy but worth the 6 bucks. My friend said her burger was pretty good as well. I say it SORTA lives up to the hype because even though it was a delicious and unique meal I wouldn't wait more then 15 min for this and I wouldnt drive out of my way to get it unless i was super craving it or someone else drove me. Parking can be a bitch but i got lucky and got a close spot in a 2 hour zone. Most of the area around Bruxie is 30 min max so becareful when parking. The staff was very friendly and helpful and gave a lot of good advice. There is minimal seating so be prepared so eat in your car or on the curb if you come at peak hours. This isn't a restaurant but more of a food stand. Overall this is a place that everyone should try at least once

Came here on a recommendation by a friend who was raving about their waffle burger. It was easy enough to find and since it was a holiday weekend, there was plenty of street parking. I ordered a Bruxie burger with the waffle fries, the seasonal shake (strawberry), and the chicken and waffle with maple syrup. Bruxie burger with waffle fries - a decent burger, well seasoned and juicy. The waffle bun was super light and airy. Perfect compliment to the heavier burger. The waffle fries were some of the best I have ever had. They were so light and airy I didn't feel like I was eating unhealthy at all! Chicken and Waffle - again excellent waffle but heavily seasoned chicken. It was too much seasoned with rosemary which I found to be too overwhelming. However the chicken was moist. The maple syrup was an additional $1 and came in a little condiment cup. There was nothing special about the syrup but I think you can't have chicken and waffles without syrup. Strawberry shake - delicious! There were fresh strawberries blended in. It wasn't super thick but think enough to be considered a good shake. I would definitely come back for the shake. i'd come back to try some of their dessert waffle items, and maybe their burger but not the chicken and waffle.

Super quick service this time! And SUPER DELICIOUS waffle sandwich! This time I got something off their seasonal menu: Green Eggs and Ham. It's my new favorite! Ham and cheese with eggs, mayo (very slight), and arugala pesto (don't think it made the flavor much different than basil pesto, but it was really delicious). I found it more filling than most of the waffle sandwiches I've had there. The quality of the ham is good too. It's not too thick or thin (maybe 2-3mm thick). One other nice thing is it's not one of their super pricey sandwiches (it's $6.95). I also saw that they have a Strawberries n Creme waffle... I'll have to try that next time :)

Found this place after YELPing for "WAFFLES" and remembered that quite a few friends have visited this place. Wait time: Came here on a busy Sunday where the line was approximately a 10-15 minute wait. �There was a tour of some sort at Chapman University so this brought a lot of customers) Menu: Read about some dishes that were highly recommended and I ended up ordering the Prosciutto & Gruyere while my boyfriend ordered the Bruxie burger. 蔕n both orders, we ordered the waffle fries. 蔄lso, on their seasonal menu was the BEST strawberry shake ever! 蔊reat waffle taste and fulfilled my expectations and cravings for waffles on a Sunday morning Parking: Limited, residential parking. 蔅e ready to circle the block a few times to find parking.

An ideal place for an indecisive foodie �such as myself) who loves a sweet & savory combination. 蔜he food was great as well as the customer service - sort of like an in n out vibe.

Finally had that chance to stop by for brunch! I was fortunate enough to beat the crowd, but be prepared to wait 15-20 minutes. You can't go wrong with the basics on the menu. The fried chicken waffle is their best item and definitely worth the try if it's your first time. The portions aren't too big, so I'd recommend getting the creme brulee as well. I also tried the roast beef special, but I don't share the same enthusiasm as with the fried chicken and waffle. The first few bites were good, but overall it was too greasy and heavy for me. The service was wonderful that day. Everyone was friendly and on top of their game.

Cute little place. Outdoor seating and awesome service. The staff was really nice. I had the smoked salmon with dill cream. The first few bites were delicious and then once you get through half the sandwich you start to notice how overwhelming the dill cream is, unless you're a cream cheese lover. Boyfriend had the fried chicken and waffle and that was just pure nom nom. I think I liked his better than mine. Waffle fries are perfect each one was crunchy and not overly salted. 蕁om nom

Boyfriend and I bikerode to this place..by the time we got there I was starving..wait was about 20-30 min. Not stoked. Upside to that though was that the owner personally came out and handed everyone menus and introduced himself to use and explained a little bit about the place. Kinda looks like one of those creepy buisness men from the movie Hostel..but nice. Ordered: 2 Chicken and waffles (one with syrup and one without) 1 Lemon Creme with berries to share for dessert Coke & Homemade Strawberry Lemonade Verdict: My goodness so delicious. The one without syrup didn't even need syrup because the chicken was so moist, tender and crunchy. The waffle completely complimented it very well. Lemon creme with berries..deliciousness in my tummy. We were pretty full by the time we got to it so even saved half to take it home and was even good cold later that night..yum. Coke-tasty. Strawberry Lemonade-Was selling quickly and got the new batch but it seemed like there wasn't enough strawberries or sugar put in because my mouth puckered at each sip. Simple fix, I just added a packed of raw sugar that they had available at the counter. You can bet I will be bike riding here more often here to try the rest of the menu. Deliciousness.

We went for breakfast and are ready to return for lunch! I ordered the egg, bacon and cheddar sandwich. It was absolutely delicious. It all just goes together perfectly. I think the reason this type of sandwich works is the waffles are light and airy, not heavy so it doesn't take away from the goodies inside. My sandwich was flavorful and filling. It does come with syrup but it doesn't really need it. My little one got the s'mores sandwich, I tried it and it was delicious. What a treat! I ended up eating half of his when he finished. It was my dessert... He enjoyed the egg, bacon and cheddar as well. He was making mmmm sounds with every bite. We love this place and can't wait to try the other sandwiches they offer. �Great concept and great food. The staff was friendly and the service perfect. Great experience - Highly recommend!!

Interesting concept. If I still lived in town, I'm sure I would visit here often! I did visit a couple times while visiting back home with my family over Thanksgiving. Out of the 5 different sandwiches I tried, I liked the Bruxie Burger the best. That along with the waffle cut fries was really good. To top it off, the chocolate shake was insanely good! The staff was really friendly each time we were there and very eager to please. I also like that they offer seasonal specials everyday. I'll definitely be back!

I love this place! I just had the bacon, egg, and cheddar bruxie! It was very good. The applewood bacon was very flavorful. I love the concept of the waffle sandwich. Also had the waffle fries. Waffle fries, how can you go wrong? We were lucky and found seating right away. However, I can see how seating can be difficult. What are there four tables? Portions were fair. I like this place and will definitely go back again!

Yum yum! What a great idea to have waffle gourmet sandwiches. I need to bring this back to Sacramento and try to do something with it! Ordered the special pastrami sandwich which had swiss cheese and coleslaw in it. I thought it was very good and the waffle, which wasn't too sweet, held up well and complimented the saltiness of the pastrami. Sweet and savory is a good mix. Had a bite of the bacon, egg and cheese waffle, dipped in maple syrup, and it was the perfect brunch sandwich. I always love me some waffle fries too and the fresh strawberry lemonade topped the meal off.

Theres a bit of a wait around lunch but its totally worth it! Who could pass up trying waffle sandwiches? Okay so, 蔵ts a small self seat joint so try to grab a free table when you see one! they have the workers call your name out and bring the food to you. I tried the seasonal mushroom arugula waffle sandwich, the unique flavors were so good together! My bf tried the Sundried tomato with goat cheese which was really good as well, but mine tasted better. hehe Waffle fries aren't anything to rave about, just like any other fries. now when your done YOU MUST end your meal with the strawberry creme brulee waffle sandwich!! You can't go without it :) nice friendly service. I will definitely be coming back here for lunch!

Best affordable waffles of anywhere, and this place sits in the backyard of Chapman University. 蔄s such, you get lots of co-eds that come through here. I would come here for dessert. 蔜he savory menu isn't really tailored to my taste. 蔜he burger patty in the waffle burger is good, but the combination isn't super flattering. 蔛ame thing goes for the chicken and waffle item. 蔍f you're expecting something like Roscoe's, this chicky/waffle combo is a continent apart. 蔜hey put slaw and de-boned fried chicken and wrap the waffle around it. 蔜he waffle is likely to split in half from the moisture, with the slaw spilling onto the plate. 蔍 can't exactly fancy the idea of pouring Cholula hot sauce in this "chicken waffle taco in a split shell" deal. 蔍 ended up eat the chicken and the waffle as separates. �Actually, the combination of burger, or chicken, salmon, or any other masks the brilliance of the waffle. 蔍t is fluffy, and when eaten by itself, the subtle but elegant aroma is just so pleasant as it gets a chance to stand out. 蔠hatever the batter they're using hits the spot. The "waffle fries" don't seem to be too different from what you can get from Chick-fil-A or Carl's Jr. 蔍n my opinion, they could use a bit of extra time in the fryer for added crispiness. �For desserts, I've tried the smores waffle and the Nutella waffle with hints of sugar cinnamon. 蔅oth are delightful in their own way. 蔛mores is warm and gooey chocolate marshmellow convenience sandwiched in the amazing waffles. 蔉or the Nutella, it comes in a plastic condiment cup, so that you can spread it on to your taste. This place is casual, and it's very much like a food stand, with all outdoor seating and a small parking lot. 蔍 give this place a "D" for health. 蔜he sandwich meal items are heavy. 蔅ut once in a while, you might feeling a craving and want to spoil yourself. �If I was in the area, I'd stop by just for the waffles by itself.

I LOVE WAFFLES. Even if I didn't, I love the creation this place offers for people that can think outside the box. Waffle as a bun or bread? No way. Food: I got the chicken and waffle and cheeseburger. For desert lemon custurd with berries. BEST interpretation of chicken and waffles I have every eaten. Inside the packed waffle was a ligt honey glazed chicken with light and tangy cole slaw. Angus beef was nice and juicy with lettuce tomato, season cucumber slices and mayo. The lemon and berries, lets just say I couldn't stop raving about it TRY IT! The hardest part about this place is parking and finding a seat. Ordering and seating is outdoors. First come first serve, theres always a line when I went there twice so expect delays. Wear some shades or bring an umbrella rain or shine I will come back every week if I can.

Went on a Thursday night. 蔔ot from the area so used Yelp to find it. 蔐ooked good on all the reviews. 蔄t first when we got there, my wife didn't like the look of it... however when we tuned into the parking lot and saw the big beautiful fire lamps at the tables, she had a change of heart. 蔍 ordered the Fried Chicken, cheese burger, cheese and tomato and goat cheese with mushrooms. 蔝nreal... even my kids liked it. 蕋he Goat Cheese and mushrooms was our favorite and I'm by no means a vegetarian. 蔜he service was awesome. 蔞ery friendly and helpful. 蔆ute location, downtown college area. 蔠e went back on Saturday for lunch, however the line as halfway down he block. 蔆ouldn't wait that long since I had 3 kids with me, but if I was on my own I sure would have. 蔍t's definelty worth the wait.

Another Yelp hype I was hoping to be completely and utterly amazing. Went around 7:30 for dinner. Drove around to try and find parking for a while, waited in line for about 15 minutes. Staff was great, really friendly and all that good stuff already said. I got the smoked salmon, friend got the buttermilk fried chicken and we shared an order of fries and a large custard. Salmon: good, light sandwich Chicken: tasty but definitely too heavy for me Waffles were great consistency, but a little colder than I would have expected Custard: if you love rich dairy, this is it, the most rich, thick, creamy custard I have ever had! Fries: not seasoned or anything special, just go to Carl's Jr. if you reaaaallllyy need criss-cut fries I would like to try a dessert waffle next time, but not sure when that will be. Not dying to drive out from Irvine.

I never thought that waffles could be served as a sandwich. And, boy, was that an innovative idea. When I think of waffles, they're usually sweet and can easily fill you up, but the waffles at Bruxie are actually light and crunchy. Plus, it doesn't overpower the filling or meats inside. I ordered the smoked salmon and dill cream cheese, and enjoyed every single bite of it. It already filled me up when I was halfway through the sandwich, which I'm guessing is because of the cream cheese. I also tried my cousin's wild mushroom and urugulla, and that, too, is deliiiiiiicious. I really hope that becomes a regular in their menu. Will definitely come back to try the other savories and the sweets. :)

A dessert waffle and two sandwiches as under $18. 蔅ruxie burger looked rare but it was good (better than a Western bacon burger from Carl's Jr.). 蔊ood hot chocolate but not the thick European kind you may have had in France or Italy. 蔒y liege waffle came with Nutella. 蔍'd have it again with chocolate. �I would go back. 蔖arking was a wait because there are only four spaces. 蔛picy coleslaw makes the fried chicken with waffle soggy but I loved the taste of spiced honey in my last bite. 蔍t wasn't dry! 蔜he waffle as bread is crisp, but not heavy. �The owner was there asking how we liked our meal. 蔋e said his partner is from Brussels. 蔜his is great for dinner. 蔣ou have to give the cashier your name before you order so that one of the workers can call it and walk it to your booth. 蔋e even asked if I needed help choosing from the menu but you get enough advice from other people discussing their orders as they wait in line.

Imagine buttery, fluffy, crispy waffles with juicy morsels of meats and cheeses in between the two collapsed sides. 蔅asically, this is what Bruxie is about. �I have eaten here 4 times with wife, family, and friends. 蔜hey do not disappoint! 蔍f you are in a mood for a gourmet foodie sandwich that is different from the norm, come to Bruxies. 蔍t will definitely be a nuanced experience of dining. 蔍 would give it a 4 and a half, but they do not have restrooms for patrons, which means you'll need to walk to another restaurant 2 blocks away and sneak into their restrooms by pretending to order from their menu such as 蔅each Pit BBQ (average food but clean bathrooms).

I was sad to see Dairy Treet go, but was excited to see it replaced with such a cute little eatery with an interesting theme. But, I've been here a handful of times now and each time I come away a bit disappointed for some reason. Maybe it's the inner sadness of the hipster Chapman undergrads rubbing off on me, who knows. I've had their burger waffle (ugh--like lead in my tummy), their s'mores waffle which was good but SUPER sweet, and my favorite and go-to, their Liege waffle which is way smaller than the others (like 1/4 of a full waffle). I think if I ever go back (which I probably will because the bf likes it and it's close by) that's what I'd get. The place is always bustling so expect to wait awhile... but there's nice seating outside if you can snag it.

I wasn't sure about a waffle sandwich. 蔍 like salty flavors, and waffles seems sweet, so I wasn't sure how the two would mesh.

what?! i didn't realize i hadn't reviewed this place yet since i've been a fan since my mouth made first contact with the buttermilk chicken waffle. so like the others, i recommend the buttermilk chicken. why? because this is the only one where all the flavors compliment each other without overpowering each other. i tried all the different ones: mushroom, salmon, prosciutto... etc. however, i find that the contents usually mask the waffle taste so i've stuck with the OG waffle sandwich. if you have the cash and stomach space to spare, definitely try some of their sweeter waffles. the lemon creme with berries are really good and so is the nutella (i mean, you can't really go wrong with nutella... EVER). oh, and a bonus: the workers here are quite friendly and they try to engage you in a friendly chat despite the busy atmosphere. �this is also good for: breakfast, brunch, lunch, dinner, late night, dessert.. 'cause well, it IS

Waffle burger? What is this madness! At first I was skeptical because I had imagine a waffle with some sort of food like burger or chicken weird, thinking that the sweetness of the waffle would overpower the food. Little did I know how wrong I was. I've been here twice so far, each trying different things. First time I had a waffle burger. It was good, the waffle was perfect and not sweet yet it was crispy, ingredients like tomatoes where fresh, and the patty wasn't overly cooked. I enjoyed it enough that I had to come back to try something different. The second time I had to give the hot item a try, the fried chicken and waffle. Being that this is my first time trying it I didn't know what to expect. The sauce they give you with it is similar to a "sweet chili sauce", it was good and complimented the perfect fried crispy chicken. The waffle fries are also good perfectly seasoned with salt. I do also love the pure sugar cane sodas! The price is only a bit steep depending on how you think about it, I mean after all it's just waffles. But it is very good and something different to try. I would definitely come back here again and try something different; dessert waffles perhaps?

This was my first time at Bruxie, and I loved it! I ordered the strawberry creme brulee waffle sandwich off of their special menu. 蔍t was amazing! 蔍 can't stop thinking about it since! 蔍t consists of strawberries and vanilla bean creme brulee. 蔕verall, it wasn't overpoweringly sweet. 蔵t was a perfect blend of the sweetness of the creme brulee and the citrus taste of the strawberries. My friends tried the bacon, egg, & cheddar waffle sandwich; the s'mores one; and the smoked salmon one. 蔜hey said they're all good! This waffle sandwich joint is located in the cutest part of Orange. 蔜here are a lot of antique stores and boutiques. 蔇riving around this area reminded me of Stars Hollows from Gilmore Girls. 蔍t just feels so homey walking around here. 蔍t's contrast from the rest of Orange County. The only problem is that parking and seating is a little hard to find. 蔣ou have to park on the streets, so hopefully you're good at parallel parking. 蔄nd there's only a handful of tables and chairs. 蔛o be ready to race to the next table that opens up. The best part: even though there was a line, I didn't have to wait that long to get my food!

At first we were suppose to go to Roscoe's Chicken and Waffle, but my brother and his friends took us here instead because they said that this place is better than Roscoe's. 蔍 can't be the judge of that because I have never tried Roscoe's, but I am a fan of this place. 蔜he chicken had the right sauce that went with the waffle and the vanilla milkshake was delicious!

I don't know what the hype was about this place, because when I tried the Chicken Waffle, I wasn't impressed. So I came back to give this establishment a second chance, and they blew me away with their waffle fries. I have yet to try more items on their menu, but I don't understand why it's $7 for a skimpy piece of chicken enclosed in a waffle, with barely any lettuce on it. Oh, and might I add that Maple Syrup is an extra $1. What exactly defines a "gourmet" waffle?

I love love... LOVE Bruxie's. I've only tried the fried buttermilk chicken and pulled pork waffle sandwiches and both are amazing. I believe the pulled pork is only available after a certain time. I usually go before 11am to beat the crowd and they seem to have the pulled pork cooked and ready by then. I would like to try other items off their menu, but there's only so much real estate in my stomach and both of the ones I've tried are too amazing to pass up whenever I visit.

I thought the combination was amazzingg. There was also a syrup that came with the chicken and waffle and that made the combination even better.

Interesting yet delicious sandwiches in a waffle instead of a bun or bread... One of my good friends heard about this place a few weeks ago so we decided to go up one day to check it out. 蔜oday was that day. 蔜his place is in Old Town Orange... bunch of shops and cafes up and down the street so nice place to spend a few hours... The problem is parking... not much available and mostly time limited to 1-2 hours between 8am - 6pm. 蔠e found a 1hr parking spot in front of Chapman University... if you're only here to check out Bruxie's, one hour is a decent amount of time. Bruxie is a small building with outdoor seating only. 蔜hey have 5 or 6 parking spots on their corner, but good luck snagging one of those. 蔣ou order at the order window, pay, and wait for them to call your name. 蔍f you're lucky enough, you'll have a table to sit and enjoy your meal... If I remember right, they have 5 tables that seat 4, 2 tables that seat 2, and 2 benches that seat 6-8 people. 蔜here are heaters there too so it should be pretty comfortable. �The line to order is about 12 minutes when it hits the stop sign. 蔠hile we were waiting in line, there was a guy named Dean who was walking around talking to people and asking them if they had any questions. 蔋e was dressed up as a chef so I'm not sure if he's the owner or the lead chef or whatever... but whatever he was, he was very friendly, personable, and very helpful. 蔠e asked him about the menu items and he described them to us and made recommendations. 蔊reat service right there! :) I ordered the Bruxie Burger and a Date Shake (seasonal item). 蔜he burger is typically cooked medium, but I asked if they could do it medium-well... 蔭fter about 12 minutes of waiting in line and placing my order... it was another 10 minutes before I got my meal. 蔔ot too bad... my shake came out a little earlier... So, the Bruxie Burger is a cheeseburger patty cut in half and placed into a waffle folded in half. 蔜here's cheese, lettuce, tomatoes, mayo and the waffle. 蔍 took my first bite and OMG, it did not disappoint! The patty was juicy, but not dripping and the waffle was so fluffy... I never thought of making a waffle sandwhich other than ham and cheese but this was amazing! 蔍 had a little bit of my friend's waffle fries (basically JITB criss-cut fries) and those were done very well too... We also shared a Creme-brulee Waffle with bananas... delicious! If parking wasn't a hassle, and it wasn't 2 hours away, I'd definitely come here more... It's a bit on the pricey side (~$5 / menu item) but definitely worth checking out...

This was easily the most disappointing Liege waffle I have ever tried. Maybe if I had never had one before and didn't know what it should taste like I might have enjoyed it. First off, half the waffle's pearl sugar was burnt, while the inside of the waffle was hardly lukewarm. It was also a little soggy, like they reheated it. The overall liege was very cake-like, instead of doughy how it should be...not ordering that again!! With that said, I am looking forward to trying other things from this place. I'm sure the savory and sweet waffle sandwiches are awesome, Bruxie just failed really horribly at making a decent Liege. :(

Ok -- I will admit, I will stand in a long line if I see one with the logic that it must be a long line for a reason. �I guess it depends on how much time I have to waste also).... Went to visit Chapman with my cuz, and saw this fabulous new place advertising the "Bold Fold." 蔍 decided I must see what the long line was all about. 蔍 ordered the special Wild Mushroom, Goat Cheese, and Arugula and also the Strawberry Creme Brulee. 蔋oly cow. 蔅oth were excellent (as fast food goes). 蔍 probably should not have consumed both so quickly, as my stomach was a bit angry with me, but I would certainly eat here again.

This place is ridiculously GOOD. The vibe/setting is the best - right in downtown Orange next to the college, makes it a really fun atmosphere. When I was here last, a lady manager was walking around making sure everyone was okay. She helped us every step of the way, and offered a free custard shake sample (which was delicious). I got the egg and bacon waffle, and then a strawberry custard one for dessert. I split the dessert one with my friend, but could barely eat all of it because the food is just so filling. The cane soda's they serve are also to die for - just so good. You have got to check this place out.

omg i cannot believe i haven't rated this place yet! But then again do i need to tell you how great it is after all that's been said?! why can't we have more waffle sandwich places rather than all these fastfood burger places?! If you haven't been here you are seriously missing out on life! one BIG advice though...DO NOT spoil someone's opinion of this place by buying someone a waffle sandwich to go, drive all the way home and have them eat it cold and soggy! these waffle sandwiches are best eaten right when they are made and brought out. Otherwise, they are no longer hot and crispy but rather soggy and disgusting. Trust me, i've tried one to go..after a 15 minute drive home. If you want someone to try it..take them here! I've tried most of these sandwiches and they are all very good but i have to say my favorite is the Waffle Hamburger. The meat just melts in your mouth..x]

I have to admit, I thought this is another over hyped place on Yelp. They proved me wrong. The concept is great. The food was good. THe wait was well worth it. The price was a little high. Parking sucks, you are not allowed to park on the street without permit. I highly recommand the chicken and waffle. When I first got the sandwich, I could not see anything special about it, but after I poured a little bit of the maple syrup mixture over the sandwich and bit into it, it was a perfect combination. The maple syrup had a hint of cayenne and vinegar which gives the fried chicken the moisture it needed and it became the perfect medium between waffle and chicken. I gave this place 4 stars because of the burger, it was ok, nothing special.

Bruxies... even the name is intriguing, but not as intriguing as having a Belgian waffle burger or a Belgian waffle sandwich. 蔣es, Belgian waffles are not only for the breakfast fans or those with a sweet tooth, but can be a substitute for sandwich breads or burger buns! This hip, cool stand is worth the wait (between 15 - 30 min)! 蔋ighly recommend their pulled pork with sauerkraut, burger, smoked salmon with cream cheese, and their lemon cream with fresh berries!

Um, yes. My partner-in-dining discovered this place by accident after seeing a show at Chapman U, and we've both been addicts ever since. The best waffle fries ever are here. I've managed to turn a waffle skeptic into a waffle-enjoyer (if not into a waffle-lover) thanks to this place. Tips: eat it right away for optimal flavor, as they don't really keep, even for the ten minutes or so it takes to get home. Anything with melty cheese on it is best; without, the waffle seems a bit plain if still tasty. The sugar-cane sodas are light-tasting and addictive, so beware: your first try will certainly not be your last.

I met up w/ a good friend after not seeing each other for 2 years. Little did we know that Bruxie's not a typical restaurant, but more like an open outdoor house. We got the Buttermilk Fried Chicken Waffle, Waffle Fries, and a Belgian Hot Chocolate! The chicken was cooked so well... and the chili syrup was an unexpected twist on the flavor! I thought the syrup would be too much but it didn't overwhelm my taste buds. Best waffle sandwich I've ever had! They have a lot more to offer than just the classic buttermilk fried chicken! I laughed when I saw Sriracha sauce as one of their condiments. FYI they're opening up another shop in La Brea. I wish I lived close! :/

It's a waffle place so I expect the waffles to be the standout. 蔋owever, 蔍 think the waffle is lacking in taste and quality and only can be characterized as a structural element for the sandwich. 蔍 will give them kudos as it had the crispy ends and bits-- that's impressive for a waffle that is pre-made. �Their fried chicken was pretty damn good though... one bite into this moist and steaming breast proved to be awesome. 蔜he light chili sauce reminded me of a sweet chilli dipping sauce you use with hainam 蔯hicken but it needed to have more sauce because it still wasn't enough for a flavorful bite. The gruyere and prosciutto wasn't savory enough. 蔠e had to add a sprinkle of salt to it. �We also tried the bacon, egg and cheddar waffle. 蔜hose three things go great together no matter what it's on so you can't go wrong. I will go again because waffles and its usage as a base for all these tasty ingredients intrigues me. 蔅ut only if I can find parking :)

At first I didn't understand the parking situation..only 3 cars can fit in their parking lot, so they should make more tables for people to sit. But after tasting their food, I didn't care at all for their parking lot situation. Parking may be an issue, but who cares now. I'd walk miles for this. It's a small menu and they do have seasonal specials, so I would go for that. Everything we ordered except for the Buttermilk Fried Chicken & Waffle, were seasonal items. 3 of us had the Creme Brulee & Strawberry, Wild Mushroom & Arugula (Arugula, Goat Cheese and Balsamic Reduction), Short Rib and Strawberry Shake. I don't eat meat at the time, but my friends said that the Chicken and the Short Rib were good. My Wild Mushrooms were great. Soft mushroom texture with a crunchy waffle was Scrumptious. I love shrooms, who doesnt... Strawberry shake was okay. The best was the dessert. The sweet custard and strawberry was great with the waffle, but tasted way better as you got to taste the crunchy creme brulee. I can just taste it right now and i'm salivating. It was soo good that my boyfriend ordered one to go while we were eating... I heard that the Bruxie burger is great as well as the Smoked Salmon & Dill Cream Cheese. This is what we will try next time.

I would give Bruxie a gajillion tumbs up if I could, but I couldn't so I'll do it spiritually. Not a clue about what to expect from this place because unlike all the other place I've been to, I chose to remain slightly bias-free about this place and didn't read the reviews (but it's shiny shimmering splendid 4 stars still caught my interest). So I thought I'd give it a try! Three words: waffle, waffle, CHICKEN! Out with the boring hamburger buns and loaf bread because waffles are taking over our burgers and sandwiches! I ordered the Waffle chicken-add-more-exotic-ingredients-here, the Ogura Bruxie, and the S'mores. Using waffles as the bun adds a nice touch to the chicken because not only is it hard to fit in your mouth, but having crispy and crispy together produces a slight tingle and add to it the soft core of the waffle. What do you get? A slight nostalgia of the days where you would wake up early enough to catch breakfast. What's nice about the waffles here are that you know they were made right then and there because they were warm, fresh, and ultimately crispy to the touch. Customer service was superb too. The manager himself delivers the food to you! Definitely recommends this place and the Ogura Bruxie as a must-try! Simply delish mix of Asian red beans and you guess it, waffle.

I really like how they had everything with waffles, it was different and yummy! I had the chicken and waffles one (the honey sauce makes it sooo good) and their cheesy bruxie �this one was only okay, I got it with ham too and it was just average). I wasn't really feeling the outdoor environment and it's a small place, maybe because it was a little chilly when I was there. 蔜he warming heaters outside are more for looks than for warmth.

After reading all the Yelp reviews, I couldn't help myself and had to try this place out! I love waffles and I love desserts! The first visit, I got a Chocolate Custard shake and Braised short rib waffle. The Chocolate shake was the most amazing shake I had ever tasted! My boyfriend kept stealing sips of it from me! The short rib was very tender and soft, although bland. My waffle was drenched in oil, and not crispy. I did not enjoy this, perhaps because I associate waffles with sweet, not savory. My boyfriend had the cheeseburger waffle which he loved! He said the waffle is lighter than a bun and tastier in texture! The second visit, I got a Chocolate Custard shake (I am thoroughly addicted to these!) and a Creme Brulee w/Caramelized Banana waffle. This time the waffle was not oily at all! It was soft and the ends were nice and crispy, so heavenly! The creme brulee was creamy and the bananas were delicious! Overall, a wonderful treat! I highly recommend getting a Chocolate shake if you are a Chocolate lover like me. It will blow your mind! Perhaps a secret ingredient in there somewhere?? I also recommend a sweet waffle rather than a savory, in my opinion.

Great place! Everything on the menu looks delicious but I've got to say, I prefer the savory waffles over the sweet ones. The Prosciutto and Gruyere was delicious. It was salty with a bite from the mustard and the crunchy texture of the waffle just enhanced it. The other two that I tired are the Fried Chicken with Spicy honey and the Bacon, Egg, and Cheese. Both were very good. The combination of the spicy honey on the salty fried chicken was great and the bacon on the Bacon, Egg and Cheese was addicting as all bacon can be. Needless to say, I was very satisfied. I highly recommend checking out the seasonal menu. I especially like the Seasonal California Strawberry Shake. One of the best shakes I've had!

YUMMMMMMMMM-O!!!! Finally able to try this place, its always packed and the lines are always wrapped around everytime I pass back....They did a great job redoing this place--before it was a crappy looking teriyaki place, but now its a delicious establishment... I ordered the Bruxie burger with the waffle fries and the chicken and waffles and they were both delicious!! I am not a waffle person and I expected the waffles to be sweet but it was perfect!!!!! The burger was very fulfilling and the fries were nicely crisp and cut...The chicken and waffle was very crunchy--add honey and the hot sauce to it and you will love it!!! Pricing isnt bad too...Roughly $6-7 for a sandwich or burger and a couple more dollars to add the fries... Much better than a fast food establishment.. I would definitely recommend everyone to try this place..I told all my friends they need to try it... They should open later so they can attract all the business after the bars close, but I guess since they have lines all the time business is good for them... Parking may be a little hard to find since all the street parking around there require a permit and it may take up to 15 minutes for your order, but lemme tell ya, it is worth the wait!!!

This is a nice new shiny gem in the heart of Old Town Orange. Before this place was a Bruxie I remember vividly it being a pretty horrid taco stand and no one would eat here. Glad that it has changed for the better. One of the 3 owners is in his chef whites and asks how you are and how the food is. He also runs the food out by name and gives you napkins and such at your table. Great customer service! I ordered the Bruxie Burger with Waffle fries. The burger melted in my mouth. It was cooked perfectly medium with lettuce, tomato, pickle on a sesame-- OH WAIT! A waffle!? Yes! A crispy, flaky, airy waffle. Waffle didn't have the sweetness I had imagined but it gave it a nice texture with the burger. I forgot to add mustard and some spice for some kick but that will do for now. It was pretty good. The waffle fries I loved! They were perfectly cooked, crispy and soft in the inside with salt and pepper to taste. I am a pepper monkey and loved that it had a bit of a peppery bite than salty. YUM! These two items were gone in mere seconds and I had room for more. Dessert?! Of course! Debated between the Lemon Cream with Berries and the Nutella. Went with the Nutella with Bananas and I was glad I did. Again, I had anticipated it to be super sweet but it wasn't. Another flaky, airy waffle with a nice spread of 蔔utella, sweet cream and sliced bananas. The sweetness of the Nutella complemented the sweet cream since the sweet cream strangely had a bit of a sour component to counteract the sweet. Its a brilliant idea! The place is really cute and quaint. They even have heaters and little pull down shade areas on the sides. Water is on the side of the building as well as condiments and utensils that are biodegradable! Love it!

As a Chapman student, this place always smells great when I pass by. 蔜he food though is a bit overrated. 蔍t's not amazing, but it's good. 蔋owever it is kind of pricey, and during peak lunch and dinner hours, it is extremely crowded. 蔍 can't even imagine how hard parking is for non-Chapman students who come here to eat. 蔍 personally swing by when its not so crowded since it is conveniently close for me. I love their waffle fries here, they are delicious. 蔜heir bacon,egg, and cheddar waffle is good, you can't go wrong with it. 蔜heir Smoked Salmon and Dill cream cheese waffle is good, but after a few bites you get sick of it. 蔜he cheesy bruxie is extremely oily and greasy, and it tasted mediocre. 蔣ou are better off getting a real burger at In and Out. The pure sugar cane coke tasted great, but it really isn't amazing when compared to regular coke. 蔜he custard is delicious, and even better with the waffle cone. 蔋owever, I do think the menu is a tad overpriced for the portions you get, and there is always trouble finding somewhere to sit if you plan on eating there. Overall, worth a try if you haven't tried it yet. 蔅ut is it worth waiting in line and standing while you eat because there is no where to sit, well that is debatable and up to you.

We went for the sun-dried tomato with goat cheese and prosciutto with gruyere sandwiches, which were amazing.

This is my third time eating here and I have not been disappointed. The waffles are crunchy and the ingredients are fresh. 蔜he sodas are made with real cane sugar (ie: so no brand names here) and refills for sodas are $1. �They fold their Bruxie to be like a waffle taco, but If you like to use a fork & knife, you'll need to ask. �The specials of the day are first come, first serve, and they usually run out. It is a quick & inexpensive place (nothing over $8), but your tab can easily add up if your eyes are bigger than your stomach. The parking can be a pain (don't park on Palm... you will get ticketed!!), it can get crowded, and chances are you will need to eat on the go since this place only has a handful of tables. My grade: B+/ A-

This place was fantastic! It's located just north of Orange Circle, far enough away from the parking problems, but not too far of a walk from the circle. We went Saturday morning around 10:30 and it was probably the best time we could've gone. We waited in line maybe 5 minutes and didn't have to wait for seating at all. By the time we were done eating, the line was at about a 30 minute wait and the wait for seating was probably even longer than that. My advice (obviously), come earlier for lunch. I have a big appetite so when I looked at the menu, I thought to myself, one waffle folded over with meat inside isn't going to cut it. I ended up ordering two from the Savory menu. The prosciutto and Gruyere was good in flavor but lacking in portion. 蔄 little more prosciutto would've went a long way for me. 蔒y second order was from the seasonal section: 蕎ild mushroom and arugula. 蔄gain, great on flavor but lacking in portion. 蔒aybe I'm asking too much. This place is a definite repeat either way. 蔍 want to see how creative they can get on their seasonal menu. 蔍 will be sure to show up around the same time as well.

I've heard so much about this place from all my friends down south and up north, and finally, we were able to check it out. It was especially convenient since my friends live in Tustin. The Waffle Fries were ok. They were unevenly seasoned and not too hot, but despite that, the fact that they use salt and pepper was great. I really love salt and pepper flavored potato chips. We got it as part of a combo meal. Mushroom spinach arugula goat cheese was good. Perfectly made waffle and all the ingredients blended well. Nothing was overpowering. The waffle was crisp and light. It served more as a way to link all the ingredients together rather than having its own flavor. The mushrooms were juicy, the goat cheese was creamy and the spinach/arugla salad with vinagrette was perfect. Prosciutto gruyere was near perfect. Not much filling but that worked for the better. There was enough of each ingredient where all the textures blended well. The strength of the prosciutto and creamy gruyere flavored the waffle perfectly. The waffle was not as good as the other waffle, which kind of sucked, but wow, this waffle ruined grilled cheese for me. The custard was perfectly creamy and had very buttery smooth texture. It wasn't to sweet, which I enjoyed. I also had a simple dessert waffle (the syrup/cinnamon/powdered sugar one). Simple, yet very good. The crazy thing about the food here is while its delicious, its also very well priced and not super heavy, except maybe the custard. My friends here recommended their salmon waffle n smores. I will definitely try these next time.

This is THE place that got me to fell in love with waffles. Before, i wasn't a waffle fan at all. To me, they're not much diff than eating cereal for breakfast, but after trying this place- i really started to like waffles. . Unfortunately, I'm a picky guy, so I usually don't bother eating waffles made from other places. Bruxie is the only place that i tried where their waffle taste so fluffy and nice. Even after refrigerating it and eating it the next day, it still taste pretty good. The waffle i recommend would be their fried chicken waffle. . despite being a very busy place. Their servers are all pretty great. They're trained well and generally very polite and courteous. 2 thumbs up! :)

I try to reserve the 5 star rating for only the best establishments. 蔈ven though you have to eat outside on McDonald's styled furniture, this place is top notch when it comes to food and service. I've only had two of the "sandwiches." 蔅elieve me, I'm going back for more. 蔍 started off with the smoked salmon/lox. 蔄MAZING. 蔄fter I had eaten half, I knew that I wanted to sample something else. 蔛o I took the other half and ate it while waiting in line. �The next thing that I had was the bacon, egg, and cheese.... on a waffle again. 蔖aired with the warm maple syrup (for 50 cents more), it was like breakfast in one bite. 蔄MAZING is the word that comes to mind. The waffles were soft, light, fluffy, and oh so tasty. 蔜he perfect balance of doughy and creamy/buttery. 蔔ot too overpowering. �So much better than any bun. 蔍 almost went back for the burger AND buttermilk fried chicken... 蕁ext time. 蔇EFINITELY next time.

As good as it gets for a waffle sandwich. Serious crisp to the waffle exterior. Insert joke about waffling here. Classic Combination. Fried Chicken and Waffle. Chicken= moist. Serious thought went into the chicken preparation, and although so many places don't know how to cook chicken to retain moisture, this place does. Sweet. Literally, had 蔋oney for sweetness. Did I just cheat on my non-existent diet? Yes. Was it worth it? Yes. Texture? Nice. Creativity? Yes that it's a lighter waffle instead of bread, but the combinations themselves are familiar- like peanut butter and jelly, chicken and waffles, eggs bacon and cheese... It feels like a food truck in a small hut a block away from Chapman University.

The first time I went there it was about 40 degrees outside and we waited in line for about 15 minutes before ordering... that's saying alot since the menu isn't very extensive. The place was packed, even though it was that cold, and my girlfriend and I had to stand against a counter facing Palm (luckily the space heater was on). What's the point? This place is legit. The fried chicken waffle sandwich was awesome. The chicken is breaded and fried to a nice crisp, but the meat stays moist. Make sure you get the sandwich with the side of maple syrup. I'm Asian so I had to get up on it with some Siracha. Overall this place is pretty freaking good. Only downside is parking is extremely limited, but it seems like most people walk there since its in a neighborhood, and it can get pretty crowded since its by Chapman U. But if the line is long then all those people can't be wrong right? Take it from me I think Bruxie's got it right.

Waffle sandwiches. Sounds weird, right? The only time I've heard of eating waffles with anything other than honey/maple syrup/fresh fruit/whipped cream was at Roscoe's and their popular fried chicken + waffle combo, which fell sort of flat for me. But I heard a lot of great things about this place, so I decided to check it out with a friend. The first time I came here, it was around brunch time. After parking my car (there's lots of free public parking around the area, if you're willing to walk a few blocks, because the street parking all around Bruxie are almost always filled up), we got in line and looked over the menu while we waited. Lines can get pretty long, so be sure to get here early! PRO TIP: Get someone to stake out a table while the others in the others wait in line to order. The staff were friendly and quick. My friend and I both decided to get one savory and one sweet waffle each and share. I got one listed under the seasonal favorite (Turkey Reuben) and Lemon Cream & Berries. It was my first time ever having a Reuben and it was GOOD. The ratio between turkey and sauerkraut was perfect; neither overwhelmed the other. The Lemon Cream & Berries was delicious as well. As a person who loves having a tangy, sour kick in her food, it was perfect for me. It was a bit too sour for my friend, though. But that's ok because it just means more for me! The menu also offers many different savory and sweet choices, from BBQ pulled pork to nutella + banana to red bean. There are also two to three different seasonal favorites that change daily; I've always ordered something from this part of the menu because it just sounds so delicious. The second time I came here, my friend ordered a float, the Creamside float, which tasted like a Tootsie Roll. So... if that's your sort of thing, but I wasn't too big of a fan. All in all, I will definitely be back in the future with more friends! Thanks, Bruxie, for the wonderful food!

I was going to write a thorough review, but HELLO! This place hasn't been open a month and there's already 53 reviews? I mean come on, obviously this place rules. Despite what Yuki down there said, their Bruxie Burger and waffle fries are GREAT. And they made my food with gloves. Their cream soda is a must. And I can't wait to come back here at night for some dessert waffles. It gets super crowded during the lunch hour when all the Chapman snobs take their lunch break, but it sure is a great addition to the neighborhood. Good prices, too. Complimentary cucumber water, too. Dog friendly, too. I LOVE YOU ALREADY BRUXIE. P.S. who poses in a bikini for their Yelp photos? This isn't Myspace!

Wtf, I could have sworn I wrote a review for this place. I've had the fried chicken waffle before and it was excellent. I'm usually a dark meat guy but the breast was moist and delicious. A tip, no need for extra syrup because their sauce is already sweet enough. The pastrami waffle is excellent too, but I guess that was a special item because it's not always on the menu. Their sugar cane soda is a great add on to any sandwich. To the people who deduct a star for no bathroom, it's a small food stand. Go pee in the bushes and enjoy their food.

Wow Bruxie, why are you in Orange and not Costa Mesa or Newport? I really love this concept; It's so refreshing to have something new and unique to try in Orange County. The waffles are special, light and airy. We went for breakfast. Hubby and I both ordered a breakfast sandwich with egg, bacon and cheddar and I ordered the little one a smore sandwich stuffed with Belgium chocolate, bananas and marshmallows. We all three loved these sandwiches. In fact our son liked mine more than his so he ended up eating half of it. The prices are fair for what you get. I know hubby could have eaten three of these things, no problem but he refrained from re-ordering. The owner was really friendly, came out to the patio and asked us how we liked it. I tried my hardest the next day to make this at home and although I looked all over the internet for a recipe to make a lighter, airy waffle, I couldn't come close to the yumminess of the Bruxie waffle.

LOVE the Irish Nachos! 蔍 mean, what could be wrong with crispy waffle fries covered in cheese sauce, sour cream, bacon, and chives?? 蔍 CRAVE the Lemon and Berries waffle, and also the Lemon Meringue waffle when they have it. 蔍 haven't found a savory sandwich that I love yet, but with the Nachos and Sweet offerings who needs a sandwich? 蔍 am perfectly content with my favorites and plan to eat them as often as I can! 蔐OVE YOU BRUXIE!!!

I have mixed feelings about the meal I had at Bruxie. 蔍 liked the service and the staff were very friendly and fast at expediting food orders. 蔜he thing I wasn't so sure about was the savory dish I ordered, which was the Smoked Salmon & Dill Cream Cheese Waffle Sandwich. 蔜he cucumbers didn't really fit into the sandwich and it really didn't add much to it. 蔍 think if the chives were replaced with red onions, it would bring more flavoring to the sandwich itself because it was kind of bland. 蔅ruxie should stick with the classic flavor pairings of smoked salmon, cream cheese, and red onions. 蔖otentially adding some arugula and maybe some bell peppers would give the sandwich more of a flavor profile. 蔠ith this meal, I had their fresh strawberry lemonade which was okay, it didn't impress me that much. 蔍t was on the sour side with some pulp present, so you could tell it was fresh, but it didn't really win me over. I also ordered a sweet dish which was the Seasonal Creme Brulee with fruit. 蔔ow this was an awesome waffle sandwich and I think the maple syrup with the powdered sugar really made the dish cohesive and well put together. Overall, I think some things could be improved to make their sandwiches more delectable (as far as the savory goes), but I haven't tried their other sandwiches yet so I cannot speak on behalf of it. 蔅ut with this meal, it left me with mixed feelings.

If I were giving my review based on my first experience with waffle sandwiches, I would give Bruxie two stars. I ordered the burger the first time, and it just pales in comparison to other burgers you can get in the adjacent Orange Circle. The burger wasn't cooked well, lacked any flavor, and the waffle was devoid of any sweetness or flavor. Beyond that, so much of the meat is outside of the waffle that by the time you finish the meat, you are left with an unfavorable 2:1 ratio of waffle to lettuce. Lame. But on my second visit, I opted for the unbeatable chicken and waffle combo: the buttermilk fried chicken sandwich. This sandwich quickly erased any idea that Bruxie was overhyped fare. The chicken is fried, and unlike the burger, is a perfect fit for the interior dimensions of the waffle. The coleslaw and honey are great complements as well, especially the honey, which is a great "sweetening agent" for the waffles, and its freely available next to the ketchup. The Cheesy Bruxie is also really good, and although I didn't add honey to that, ordering it with tomato, avocado, and bacon helped enhance the flavor of the waffle, especially considering the sweetness of the tomatoes and avocado in addition to the mild blend of gruyere and cheddar cheese. It's really good to try once (and twice), just remember that each person will spend an average of $6-10 dollars and parking will drive you insane. You can consult Chapman University's Public Safety webpage to find the three visitor lots the university has (paid parking), or park at the free public lot on Maple & Lemon street, behind the movie theater. It's a much more comforting proposition to walk to Bruxie as opposed to getting a parking ticket faster than you can say "waffle."

Delicious - if you have not already heard, which you probably have. The waffles are as light as air. We really thought this food was going to be a gut bomb, but it felt surprisingly good in my tummy. We tried the salmon, cucumber and dill cream cheese (per suggestion of my friend Sydney who is a die hard Bruxie fan) and the chicken and waffle. Could not decide which one we liked better. Both were divine. Staff is an absolute delight and seem to be very proud of their little Bruxie. Well, for good reason. I am proud just to live in the same town.

Food: Great quality waffles and creative selection. I have tried the Wild Mushroom, Prosciutto, and the Salmon and Dill waffles. All great tasting. Portion size isn't very filling, and you may need to order a side or possibly another waffle to fill you up. (Which may amount to at least $15). Atmosphere: The restaurant is small, with few seating, but is at a good location for foot traffic and if you want a quick bite to eat (gourmet style). Price: $$$. I think is a little much for the amount you are getting. Because of this, I would choose to go to this place less frequently than I would want to. Perhaps if the prices were a tad lower, it would be more affordable - even for the college kids at Chapman University. Overall - Great food, great staff, all friendly. I would definitely come back here. TIP: DON'T JUST PARK ANYWHERE. ORANGE CITY IS STRICT WITH PARKING VIOLATIONS ESPECIALLY NEAR THE UNIVERSITY. :)

Completely. Utterly. Amazing. I went here on Saturday for lunch and there was a crazy line already even though it had just finished raining and most of the seats are outside. Chicken and waffles: need I say more? Imagine a perfectly fried chicken breast, evenly cooked, with a perfect crust on the outside. Now dip it in a delicious honey and chili sauce. The sauce clings to the crevices like a new lover - complimenting the chicken, but not overwhelmingly so. It's also thick enough so the chicken retains its crisp exterior, but not so thick that it sticks to the roof of your mouth. Now place all of this in a freshly made buttermilk waffle still hot from the griddle and try to control your drooling. 100% maple syrup is available for an extra $1, but it's not necessary. Just trust your chef's instincts and eat it as it was intended to be. You'll need napkins, but doesn't every wonderful experience require one?

My friend took me to Bruxie and really talked it up. Usually, no place can live up to the hype. When I saw the crowd of people eating and waiting in line, I knew then I was in for a treat. While waiting in line, we were approached by a man in a white chef's jacket, who I found out is Dean the owner or manager of this fine waffle establishment. I commented on how well they were doing, and he mentioned that Jay Leno ribbed them for their "waffle sandwich" and that really helped spread the word. Jay hasn't been by as of yet, but Dean said his first sandwich is gratis. Dean's such a great guy, just good vibes all-around, and I love the fact that he's mingling with his customers and answering their questions. I decided to have the seasonal mushrooms with goat cheese.... OH MAN was this good! I couldn't believe how awesome it was. The balsamic with the dark greens really rounded out the flavor. The waffle wasn't too hard, it's weird to say but it was quite tender. It was like the sandwich made love to my mouth so so tenderly. And the waffle fries didn't disappoint! I will be coming back with friends! Also, wanted to mention that the seating is perfect for a beautiful day, the service is quick even though the line is long, and the owner Dean is just an all-around nice guy. Who wouldn't want to support this business!?! I can't wait to go back. It's on my short list of must-go places for out of town friends as of NOW! So if you're reading this Jay Leno, get over there already! I know I hyped it, but this is one of the few places that lives up to the hype.

Worth trying at least once but we won't go back here again. It's a perfect college hangout to grab food but I believe that's what makes it have the long lines. The staff is friendly but we haven't yet found one of their recommendations to be as good as we'd hoped. The portions are small for the price and not as tasty as we'd hoped. 蔜here are other joints that have better versions of each of their dishes. �BUT still worth the try and a fun place to stop by when you're there.

I FINALLY got around to trying Bruxie, after many months of saying, "wow, I'm only 5 minutes away, I should really go there" but then deciding that parking sucks in Old Towne and driving somewhere more convenient. Last night, I had similar thoughts - except I knew it was getting close to closing time (9pm). I wasn't sure they would still be open - or willing to serve - but I rushed over there and arrived with 8 minutes to spare. The place was bumpin! So I happily joined 蕋he line, and ordered the Sundried Tomato/Goat Cheeese, a Fried Chicken Waffle, and a Nutella Banana, to go. The owner was milling about chatting everyone up - it's obvious he cares a lot about this place. He is no novice in the restaurant industry either, which explains the fancy menu items (chili honey sauce? yum!) I accidentally took someone else's order (oops, our names are only one letter off), but luckily both the owner and myself realized as I was getting into my car. Now, I had to drive all the way back to Irvine with these delicious waffles tempting me in my passenger seat. When I finally got home, I ripped the bag open and devoured the tomato goat cheese. It was awesome - the arugula and basil flavor not too strong, and lots of goat cheese! My boyfriend raved about the Fried Chicken Waffle. Finally, I reheated the nutella-banana waffle and fell in love. You can't go wrong with Nutella and banana, everybody knows that, but the addition of sweet cream made it more unique. It didn't NEED the sweet cream, but I enjoyed it. One star off for the usually bad parking situation (Although I think Bruxie struck gold with this location) and not so piping hot waffles. Nothing a microwave can't fix though. Add one star back for awesome customer service. Although it "closes" at 9, the owner said if there are still people- they will keep serving. I don't know how long that goes for, but at 9:05 there was still a very long line. Very cool for making customers happy.

I've tried... their Reuben, Buttermilk Chicken, Berries and Cream, Strawberry Creme Brulee, and Cheese with Avocado waffles (all pretty good) as well as their Vanilla Cream 蔛oda (nothing special), Mint Chocolate Shake (excellent), and Waffle Fries (bland). All were good enough that I was glad I went and I'm a big fan of adding a crispy texture to any food so I lived the concept, until I realized... As cheap as $5-$6 can be for something you've never tried, waffle sandwiches are ridiculously easy to make at home if you have a waffle maker. That's when I realized I could come up with far more creative concoctions at home like a pork katsu waffle sandwich, or a bacon and sausages waffle sandwich, or or a umm... a pizza waffle, I don't know I'm just riffing here folks. The point is, it's a very simply concept and now that I've gone twice, I think I'm ready to go on my own. With that said, my recommendation is to try it once or a couple times, I enjoyed my experience and found the workers there to be very hospitable. Also swing by the ugly mug if you're in the area, a staple of old town Orange that closes very late.

After hearing so many glowing reviews about this place...I finally caved and had to try it. Luckily, my friend was visiting from SF as well and wanted to try this place too! We met there around 2PM and parked on Palm Ave (I'll come back to this at the end of my review). It was a short walk to Bruxie and we waited in line for a couple of minutes before ordering. Everything on the menu sounded delicious, but i settled on their special, short rib, and my friend got prosciutto and guyere. 蔜he total came out to about $15 for the 2 sandwiches I believe. We luckily found a table right after ordering and sat down and waited for our food. After about 5 minutes or less, our food was brought out to us (sweet!) and we began to chow down. My sandwich was GREAT. Not too heavy, but still filling and delicious. I didn't know what to expect from using a place that uses a waffle as sandwich bread, but now I must say it was amazing. My friend thoroughly enjoyed her sandwich as well and we were both content and happy that we decided to try this place. When we walked back to our cars on Palm Ave. We discovered we had gotten PARKING TICKETS! !@$#@%!@#@!$@#@%#@ This has nothing to do with Bruxie...it was our fault for not reading the street signs. It just was a horrible way to end such an awesome meal in Orange. �54.50 for a damn "no permit' ticket. Thanks a lot Orange... BUT THANK YOU BRUXIE FOR AN AMAZING SANDWICH! I'll be back! =]

Was it good the buttermilk chicken and waffle good? Yes but I still prefer my chicken and waffle with hot sauce and smothered with gravy. The best part was the crispy waffle. The chicken was tender with a light taste of sweetness. I also tried the Bruxie burger and it was good and on a waffle. Both the chicken and burger was very very light. It felt like a protein style burger. In the end I wasn't full and somewhat not content. I thought it was kind of pricey for not being full and I don't plan on coming back anytime soon.

My friend took me here a few months ago. This review is long overdue. I was actually a little hesitant about eating fried chicken and waffles because the last time I tried it, the food was overly greasy. 蔇espite my preconseptions, I tried to keep an open mind. We ended up splitting the Buttermilk Fried Chicken & Waffle. I wish I would have bought my own since it was so good. 蔜here was something so tasty about the syrup on the waffle and chicken that was delicious. 蔜he ingredients were fresh and it wasn't greasy at all. 蔠e ate the nutella and banana waffle for desert and that was excellent as well

Not sure how I missed this one for so long ... probably because someone else was wielding the wheel on the way to the Salty Dawg down the street... ugh. 蔕n my own at last, I piloted a mission to taste their touted Buttermilk Fried Chicken & Waffle sandwich one day during the height of lunch time - which was not the best time to find a spot to park in this area next to Chapman College. �After a long walk , I queued up and had plenty of time to peruse their menu "one last time" ... as well as, check out all the appetizing sandwiches that others had ordered ... however, my stomach growled as I started to add up the cost for a sandwich, fries and drink, which ascended to well over $11 (OUCH!). �As I approached the counter to place my order, I took a quick glance at the few tables next to the establishment and concluded that this time I'll get it to go and eat my waffle sandwich in the car. 蔅ut before I bolt, I need to wash my hands ... so, I used their sanitation station with antibacterial gel to quickly cleanse my hands - do they have a bathroom? �As I navigated the blocks back to my ride, I delved into my bag to sample a cross-cut fry or two to bat down my hunger pangs. 蔜hey sure were good but not plentiful! ... Arriving back in the local parking lot, I hoisted my can into my van and opened my bag to find the parts of waffle sandwich needed to be assembled. 蔜his is where things turned for the worse - I found only one small spattering of cole slaw to add to the heap of chicken and waffle. 蔄fter I put it all together and was munching away, I realized my hands were quite sticky from the small container of Chili Honey that I had applied to my sandwich ... but ah, the sandwich sure was tasty. �Next time, I'll go earlier and bring water to wash my hands and eat my sandwich on site.

My first impression of Bruxie was based on their website. 蔒aybe my appetite got the best of my judgement but I really didn't expect a waffle stand. 蔠ith that being said I wasn't disappointed in the reality but just a taken aback slightly. Upon arrival we were greeted by a friendly, smiley, talkative, waffleboy. 蔋e was helpful and left me feeling warm and gooey on the cold rainy night we visited. 蔋e offered suggestions but I already knew what I wanted. �Gruy弐e and prosciutto. 蔒y Josh got a bacon, egg, and chedda without any maple. 蔜wo coffees. 蔔o dessert... was a little pricey IMHO. �The food was good but I guess I expecting something a little more. 蔒aybe I'm a fatass but I was starving and wanted something a little more filling for my dollars. 蔍'd like to find myself back around the area for dessert... I think that's more up my alley for this place. All in all... good.

Wow! Don't let the line outside discourage you from ordering here.It moved along well. It is in a college area so the prices are reasonable. I really enjoy the thin traditional waffle, there is a time and a place for the thicker belgian waffle. Here at Bruxie they take those thin,light, golden waffle and stuff 'em full of things like pulled pork with a vinegar based bbq sauce and fried chicken fillets with coleslaw. The dill pickle was fresh, sharp and garlicky. We ordered the Dulce de Leche shake and the caramel had to be home made! I paid $21 for dinner tonight which is A-OK in my book. I will definitely be going back!

Already mentally planning my next trip to Bruxie's because my first time eating there today was fantastically amazing! After my friend raved about the Creme Brulee waffle, I realized I couldn't postpone my trip to Bruxie's any longer. I'm not a fan of areas with parallel parking and Old Orange is uncharted to me, so parking was a battle and THEN looking for the waffle stand was another. Thankfully, we asked 2 girls and they helped us out! I ordered the Buttermilk Fried Chicken & Waffles, Lemon Creme, and an Iced Tea (came out to be ~$16). The buttermilk was absolutely one of the best sandwiches I've ever had! Chicken was fried & seasoned well, not dry. Coleslaw & sauce were great. And the waffles, oh the waffles... I feel like I should just ditch bread altogether. They're very light, crispy, and the batter is just great. The Lemon Creme was alright, maybe it's because I saved it for later and the waffle wasn't straight from the kitchen? Bruxie's is sort of far away, and I wish it was just a little cheaper, but I can see why it gets killer Yelp reviews!

this place is cool, nice enough area and has pretty good food. The Food: we got he bruxie burger, which was ok. the meat to me was kind of bland but the waffle was pretty good. very dissapointed in the size! it was more like a taco than a burger. also 蔳ot the salmon waffle. i liked this one more, the salmon was good. it had a very small amount but thats normal for salmon anything. the cream in the waffle sandwhich was very tasty i think it was boursin or something. loved the chocolate mint chip shake. very tasty! the waffle fries were good but i think it was still kind of pricey. for the amount and taste of the food here, it was on the pricey side, and probably not worth it. which i tried the desert though, maybe next time. the Restaurant: this place is a booth. the seating is outside and the no restroom. i did see a soap dispenser and papertowel dispenser, but no sink. very weird. i really just like to wash my hands before every meal. i was very impressed by how clean the tables were though. especially for how busy it was for a 3-4pm. parking is very limited. this place can be pretty loud since its on the corner and lots of cars do drive by. but otherwise its a nice looking place with open seating. the service: the people were nice. they have a person standing outside to call your name out and to serve you the food sometimes. depending on your seating you will get served. the clerk was very nice to me. she took my oprder explained the details of all of the choices i had made to make sure i understood what was in it. that was very nice of her. this place has a great concept. i love waffles and i love sandwhiches. i jsut wish they would give more meat. the waffles are good, and so are the shakes. i probably will be coming back here for some desert. i wanted to give this place a 3.5 stars.

An Orange County trailblazer in the gourmet waffle realm! 蔠e HEART that Bruxie is a food truck style eatery at a fixed location. The waffle burger is excellent and not just because of the waffle; the burger is tender and flavorful too. We also really enjoy the chicken and waffle sandwich. So glad a craving no longer implies a drive to Los Angeles. 蔕h, and definitely get the waffle fries. Best ever! 蔕ur only complaint is that they close a little early - 9:00PM. 蔔o late night waffles run here. 蔜ypical OC, right?!?

Great place to eat at. I got lucky with the parking spots. There is very few powerpoints only about 4 regular and 1 handicap. Theres public parking but I'm not sure where it is. There is street parking also but for 30 mins only and some areas need to have a permit. I got the salmon combo with the strawberry shake and the dried tomato one was to go. Everything was really good to eat and enjoy. The salmon one I was taken back due to the cream cheese I believe it was. The fries were good also. I really recommend their shake of the day or week. Mines was strawberry and it was really good. Now they dont recommend to go and eat it later because the waffle goes soft but I took the tomato one home n I still enjoyed the sandwich. Didnt have to reheat it

Went here for a friend's birthday brunch (it was my idea)! At first i was worried about the parking but it was not that bad as most people were saying, i parked at this one place and we just walked to Bruxie. Well as we walked to Bruxie i was like "OMFG look at the line it'll take forever, oh how are we going to get our food, lets wait anyway lmao" but it was a very fast process though. We all ordered the buttermilk chicken since it was a safe move. The only thing which was weird was that the combo didn't have a drink...i don't mind if it was additional 3 or 4 dollars for a drink with fries but only 2 bucks and all you get is fries...why not add another dollar or two for a drink...whatever As we finished ordering we went to get a seat....well there weren't that much seats! but we were so so lucky and when i say luck we were lucky cuz this man was like "you girls can have these seats we're about to leave" SCORE for the birthday girl! Anyway when the food came i was in Heavennnnn it was sooo good! I don't even know how to describe it, but next time when i go again i'm soo trying everything else on the menu!

I had really high hopes for this place, but it unfortunately didn't live up to all my hopes and dreams..although one of the chefs was standing outside, asking the people in line if anyone had any questions about the menu, etc. 蔄ctually all of the staff here were very friendly and helpful, and I'm always a sucker for good customer service so this place gets a few extra points for that. Things that were ordered... 1. Fried chicken and waffles: The chicken was pounded pretty thin, was crispy, and the spicy sweetness of the chili honey was very tasty. 蔒y cousin wished there was more cole slaw in the sandwich, but I'm not a really into cole slaw so I was good. 2. Bruxie Burger: 蕋his was not as good as the fried chicken. 蔏ind of bland, and nothing special about it. 蔎ust like any burger you can get at a chain restaurant. 3. S'mores: 蔜his was good, it had all the delicious ingredients of a s'more, but the filling was maybe too thin/little compared to how thick/big the waffle was. 4. 蔐emon cream and berries: 蔜his was good, but same complaint as the s'mores one, but the lemon cream was smooth and not too sweet. The only thing I didn't like about this place was that the waffles were a bit too crispy for me (and lacked a little bit in flavor). 蔍 was expecting the waffle for the sweet ones to be a little sweeter, but it wasn't. 蔍m glad I tried this place before I came back up north, but it's not something I'm going to crave when I'm up here though.

Can you say melt in your mouth? Absolutely amazing place. I had the bacon, cheddar and egg waffle. Every bite tasted like breakfast. Not breakfast food, but the sensation of breakfast - every good memory you've ever had of every delicious flavor coming together all in one waffle. They have quite a large variety and my friends all loved their own orders. The only downside is the seating. If you are a person who likes a good sit down, you're in for a long wait and a lot of compettion from other seat hungry patrons. I live almost 30 minutes away from here, but it was totally worth the trip.g

Still find myself daydreaming about Bruxie and repeatedly bringing it up in casual conversation. How many times have I been there? Once. A month ago. Went on a late Saturday night after a long day in SD. It was freezing, we parked in the dark a few blocks away, and there was a line, but it was totally worth it. ATMOSPHERE �蔣oung adults, couples. Limited seating is mostly outdoors. FOOD �蔖henomenal Strawberry Cr弇e Br瀕巈 waffle. GET IT. I wish I lived closer to Bruxie so I could try every last item on their menu...

Went here with a friend for a late breakfast and was not disappointed. We were fortunate enough to get there before the crowds, so the wait time was short. They had a worker coming by and asking people if they had any questions and knew what they were ordering. Adding a friendly touch was a nice change of pace. On to the food: We ordered three waffles, one each and one for dessert to share. I ordered the Bacon, Egg and Cheddar with Waffle Fries which was absolutely fantastic. The waffle was perfectly cooked, not too crispy, not too soft, absolutely delectable. Fries were equally tasty. My friend ordered a Pulled Pork waffle, which she very much enjoyed. I'm a bit more traditional with my waffles and wanted something more breakfast-y, but the pork looked excellent as well. For dessert, we split a Strawberry Cr弇e Br瀕巈 Waffle which may have been even better than the other waffles. Strawberries were fresh and it had a creamy and sweet flavor to it. Overall the place is definitely worth the hype, particularly if you can avoid the lines that were filling up when we were heading out. Highly recommended!!

Bruxie is my new home! I probably spend more time here than in my dorm at CU. I immediately fell in love with this place after my first bite into their freshly toasted, crispy, hot, scrumptious waffles. I love their idea of using waffles as buns; it's definitely something I don't see everyday. Location: This place is located right across the street from Chapman University, which is at the edge of the Orange circle. Parking: PARKING is a baatch. It's literally war on the streets. As a last resort, just park at CU and pay for a 2-hour parking fee for $2! it'll be worth it for Bruxie, trust meh. Seating: There's only about 5 tables so you'll have to battle other people for that too! Last resort......chill on the sidewalks like a g. Service: Employees are super friendly and informative. When my sister asked me where the restroom was, the cashier was eavesdropping in our conversation so he immediately suggested she use the one in the Memorial Hall at Chapman. HAHA hope he's not telling a bunch of people that or else that building will only be filled with Bruxie customers instead of CU students bahah. FOOD: Everything is amazing here. You can't go wrong with anything you order! My personal favorite is their Prosciutto & Gruyere with a side of Waffles Fries. The portion here is pretty small, so if you have a huge appetite, you should order dessert from the SWEETS category, which is EXACTLY what I did with my sister! DESSERT: Nutella & Banana. The name is self-explanatory. It was just as good at the other food on their menu, but we couldn't finish the entire waffle because we got too full. FAIL. I'll come again to make up for my sins, Bruxie, don't worry! Overall, I would recommend this place for anybody. Especially for CU students since it's located in such a convenient place, and can really satisfy a starving stomach. Unfortunately, I can't go for Bruxie runs during hardcore study sessions at 12am since this place closes at 9pm. Bummer....

One of the favorite places... ever. I always get the pulled pork when it's available. The Pork is juicy, tangy, and has a good spice to it. Follow Bruxie on twitter to figure out what special is for the day. The waffle is so unique and delicious it just makes me happy. The smores are pretty good as well. They have my favorite cola here, it's just so unique. It beats coke for sure. Expect a short line, but it's worth the wait.

I think I just had a religious food experience at Bruxie. Got the braised beef short rib waffle and it was out of this world. The meat was so tender and juicy and literally falling apart. The only thing I can only equate it to going to grandma's house for Sunday night dinner and you know that was something special. It was accompanied by a couple waffle fries and a touch of horseradish sauce with some gravy on the side. It is seriously the best item on the specials menu. When they have it...I'm there! Also got the fruit and cream with strawberry preserves for desert and washed it all down with one of their hand-made cola's. Price is a little up there, about $20 for the two sandwiches and a drink, but it's not an every day place so I splurged a little. Parking can be rough since it's in Old Town Tustin and make sure you get there early. I showed up at lunch time and lucked out that I was there before the rush. Once I had ordered, I looked back to see the line was 30 people deep! Now you know a place is good when they have a line down the sidewalk just waiting to order. They should seriously consider opening more locations or allowing some franchises. It a total winning concept.

i came here with 5 other people. we all ordered something different for the most part. we all enjoyed what we got and had no complaints. [chicken waffle, cream brulee, irish fries [which is really just waffle fries with cheese and bacon bites on top]. i personally, got the bruxie burger with bacon for an extra buck. [the bacon was awesome because its not slices of bacon but its chopped up in tiny pieces and they aren't stingy about it either!] 蕋he boyfriend got the bruxie burger without tomatos with mushrooms and ranch on the side. he really liked the mushrooms and kept raving about them! prices were very reasonable. there's a staff standing right outside as you're in line to answer any questions and give suggestions. its all outside seating with some booths and stools with umbrellas. no public restrooms. they dont have regular mustard but they have the rooster sauce. 蕋hey have grape soda and waffle fries. i was hesitant at how the waffle would taste with everything else but i would have to say it all tasted delicious and was super yummy! there's a small parking lot and street parking. they have strawberry cheesecake, rootbeer float, sundaes and other things. they have super enviornment friendly plastic cups! i just wished there was more light outside. its so dark that its hard to see what im eating really. for a fast food type of place there is staff walking around taking your trash, asking you if you need anything else, and simply checking up on you. that's freaking awesome in my POV! i'm totally coming back and getting my grub on! can't wait to try more things!

Well I'm apparently on the foodie wagon, trying all these different places that are hot on yelp or featured on the various food/travel channels on the good ol' Tele.... The service here is top notch. For being a shack, you're greeted by employees, asking if you have any questions, what they recommend etc. The line moves relatively fast and you get the food nice and hot! We had the Chicken Waffle and the Bruxie Burger. Both were delicious!!!! I joked with the wife if we could go back again. 蔅ut with a stern look, I thought otherwise :P I also had the Strawberry shake which was delicious! Another yelper said it had a few strawberries, but mine was great! 蔉resh strawberries and not a lot of sugar. 蔠hat a real shake should taste like! I didn't try any of the sweet waffles. 蔊uess I'll have to make a return trip for that one! 蔊lad I don't work near this place otherwise I'd be going there a lot!

Two words: waffle. sandwiches. HOW CAN YOU GO WRONG? The answer is you really can't. I've had the lemon cream and berries, nutella and banana, cheeseburger, and the chicken & waffles. And waffle fries. Boy, when they say "intense lemon cream," they sure aren't kidding. Even my trusty orange soda couldn't combat the intensity of the cream! I only had a small bit of the nutella/banana waffle, but it was soooooo good. I might consider it the best thing on the menu, dessert wise. As for the entrees, the cheeseburger wins. It's definitely good, and I like that they don't cook the patty well done, but more medium. It's an interesting combo to eat a burger with a waffle instead of a bun, but it's a good interesting. It's definitely NOT bad at all. I will say that I do still prefer buns though, and will always. But it's not a bad switch from normalcy. The chicken and waffles were okay, I didn't try it with the maple syrup, so it probably could have been better. I wouldn't get it again. Parking kind of sucks. Their lot is tiny and you have to be careful on the street because in some areas, you need to have permits or they'll ticket. I'd come back for the nutella/banana waffle, but that's about it.

It astonishes me how a waffle and a piece of fried chicken breast could taste so derishuz! I love waffles, a lot and what makes a waffle great is the texture! At bruxie the waffle is cooked just right so it's slightly crispy, but soft enough so it doesn't cut up your mouth. The chicken breast is juicy, and it doesn't feel like it has been drowned in a bunch of lard and oil for the sake of tasting decent. It really does taste good. I read through reviews and asked to get pesto and the honey chili sauces on the side. I skipped on the coleslaw too but, all together I can see how cohesive it is. mmMm... I'm hungry

I played it safe with the buttermilk chicken & waffle sandwich today w/ a side of syrup. 蔅esides that, they have different savory sandwiches and whatnot. 蔐ike everyone else says, the chicken & waffle sandwich is a sure fire, especially for your first time there. 蔜he waffle was really light and the chicken was crispy, but didn't scratch the roof of your mouth. 蔍t's not your Roscoe's Chicken & Waffles, but it's different and still tasted really good. �Service was really good and everyone was nice. 蔜hey brought your food up to you even though you're sitting outside in a parking lot on some benches. 蔅e prepared to share a 4 person table w/ another since seating to hungry folk ratio is pretty low. 蔠e didn't mind that because some of the people that sat with us were friendly and chatty also. Parking was a pain especially since it was lunch time so I had to circle around the area for a good 10 minutes. 蔍 would come back again, it's worth the parking and walking.

Oh, you know.. its a lunch truck without the truck. Of the two sandwiches the wife and i shared, the sun-dried tomato/goat cheese was the winner. The flavors were rich enough to hold up against the waffle. The burger just seemed heavy to me, though the quality of the patty was evident. For a side they have, surprise!, waffle fries. sigh. Despite it being fairly crowded and on a friday night, the service was fine. We waited less than 15 minutes before getting our food. They had extra staff outside next to the line to assist folks making decisions. I can see this being a nice joint for an after beer snack on the walk home on a saturday night but predict that the craziness of their opening couple of weeks will die down fairly soon.

LOVE IT! I was a little skeptical at first... sandwiches out of waffles? But trust me, it's amazing. I came with a group of my friends for the first time, and we were all impressed. We didn't expect much out of a small little restaurant that was kind of like a to-go stand...but the food definitely speaks for itself. I got the Buttermilk Fried Chicken and Waffle and loved it. The chicken was flavorfully breaded and the inside was moist. I also tried the Smoked Salmon and Dill Cream and that too was a good mixture of flavors. The salmon and the dill cream definitely complimented each other. It's not a sit down restaurant with servers and whatnot, but there is seating outside and they do deliver the food for you. If i'm in the area again, I know where I'm going for lunch...

I absolutely fell in love with this place after the first bite. 蔍 ordered the Buttermilk Fried Chicken and Waffles. It has chili honey and cole slaw inside the sandwich. 蔜asted really good and forget about roscoes. That place tastes horrible compared to here. They had some other tasty sandwiches on the menu. The shakes looked really delicious. 蔜he only downfall is they are more on the pricey side, but well worth it. 蔄ll the mist shooting around Bruxie was good because it helped keep the heat down. 蔖arking is not the best, but you'll be able to get a spot around. 蔜ry this out!!!

Bruxie was good. I had the smores waffle and the banana nutella. The smores really wasnt what I was expecting. It just tasted like chocolate. The banana nutella was exactly as I wanted, except for this white frosting/cream inside that wasnt great, next time I'll omit this. The menu is huge, I really only looked at half of it, so many different things. The staff is super friendly, if alittle too much. I maybe counted 10 people inside this little building with 3 outside. They even bring your waffles to your table. Talked to I think the owner for awhile and seemed like a good guy and loved waffles and customer feedback. Next time Im going to try the pb&j waffle with the waffle fries. It a great idea, in a prime location, I'll be back. But for a first try it wasnt earth shattering.

the second visit was undeniably better than the first. 蔵'm guessing the balsamic vinegar was a bit much for me last time. this time went with the safe choices of the chicken and waffle and the creme brulee waffle. the waffles were much better. 蔴ot, fluffy, crispy. �the service by the guys who run the orders out to you~ they always do a fabulous job. the chicken and waffle was much better than the balsamic vinegar one I had last time. 蔵t was yummy. 蕀oist chicken, crispy and delicious with the waffle fries. 蔰on't waste your money on the extra syrup ($1). 蔣ou won't need it. 蕋hey put enough on the waffle to balance out the flavours. the creme brule one was similar to the strawberry croissants at creme pan (but on a waffle~ duh). 蔰elicious with bits of the burned brown sugar. 蕐ummy end to the meal. round up for a better experience this time. 蔵t's worth trying.. but i don't see myself driving all the way out here just for the food~ esp since it often has long lines. �.5 for the food. 蔵t's good and tasty. but really~ just.. i dunno. something is missing from the wow factor. �.5 for the guys who run out orders cuz they're always nice despite having to be on their feet and run around in the sun. definitely come and try it once. i recommend going with the chicken and waffle and creme brulee. strawberry lemonade was also delicious.

Went here for "brunch" today. Didn't have very brunch like food though. I had been thinking about the chicken and waffle sandwich for far too long. Had to try it. I didn't care how early it was. So my boyfriend and I got the chicken and waffle sandwich and the Bruxie burger, cut them both in half so we can each try them. I was shocked. The chicken and waffle one was FAR too sweet for me. Just not at all what I expected. I was thinking savory and BAM got hit with this random sweetness. Now the burger on the other hand... so yummy. Loved loved loved it. So juicy and delicious. The funny thing was my guy was not that thrilled with the burger and LOVED the chicken and waffle sandwich. It was kind of funny that it worked out that way, but made me realize that it has nothing to do with the preparation... it's just purely preference!

Super friendly waitress. Slow service; the kitchen didn't seem in sync. I ordered the Liege waffle served with Nutella. Big waffle not like what I expected from reviews. I thought I'd get something thin but this looked like all other Belgian waffles I've encountered. I hoped for something more unique. Should I have ordered the Brussels waffle instead? Good and warm for a hot night but maybe a sandwich would've been a better choice. Not much seating, but they have Wi-Fi.

For some reason we decided to park near the traffic circle. All of my friends had a smartphone and still couldn't find the place. -_- Oh people rely on technology so much these days haha. Anyways we finally found the place, which was like 2 blocks down from the traffic circle. For some reason I kept thinking Bruxie would be a restaurant, but when we got there it was like this cute little place with outdoor seating only. Sadly they ran out of everything, but they did however, gave us free yogurt custard! :) The yogurt was very creamy and tasted very rich! The girl that worked there said it would taste pretty good with fries. Sigh I really wanted to try out their waffles....until next time.

Stopped by last night for the opening. Made the mistake of parking some where far off and walked to Bruxie's not realizing that this place has no indoor seating. On a chilly night, perhaps a picnic in your car with your fave waffle would be better than sitting outside. I ordered from the sweet part of the menu. Nutella and bananas with sweet cream was delish! Although I had originally asked for my waffle without the cream but whatever, it worked itself out in the end. I had asked for a cup of cold milk which is weird I know, who drinks milk with their dessert, pssht! Instead I was brought a hot chocolate. They brought back the milk and let us keep the hot chocolate for free. That was pretty cool. I definitely plan on going back to try their savory waffles. The sizes seem right for the prices. However, I wouldn't come here ravenous and expect to feel stuffed with one waffle. Staff was friendly-- a bit confused but that's expected on the first day of a business being open. I really liked that there were staff members walking around checking on how people were going. That definitely classed the place up and I hope they keep doing it. Overall, good peeps and good eats!

What a way to serve a novelty who would have thought to use waffles for a sandwich. 蔅ut im sure glad they did. 蔵t is so tasty. bruxie is in the heart of chapman crowded by the locals, so 蔮e sure to be ready for a wait. i got the seasonal special of braised beef short rib. boy was it worth it. 蕋he meat was soft and flavorful thanks to the 13 hours of slow cooking. 蕋he sandwich it had two waffle fries and dressed with horseradish. 蕋o me, i dont think the horseradish went well with the sandwich, but it didnt kill it. �the waffles are to die for. 蕂bviously made fresh, they are toasted then then lightly pan fried for that crisp, tasty outer shell. waffle sandwiches are a bit pricey and you're gonna crave for more. such an indulgence

A friend suggested this place for lunch, and I had heard about it through friends-- two of which have reviews for this place. 蔎anette told me through twitter to order to prosciutto and guyere, which of course I did because prosciutto is one of my top favorite foods. And cheese too. It was really good because the waffle is really light and it gives it a really good balance with what's inside. �My friend got the short rib daily special which was really good. 蔜he meat was really tender because when he pulled the waffle apart, the meat came apart really easily too. 蔜he short rib one was a little too messy for me because I'm a particularly neat eater, but it was really tasty. I like the outdoor seating and I was glad it worked out because I really wanted to keep drinking my iced coffee I got earlier in the morning. I would definitely come back again if I'm in the area.

"Waffle sandwich? I ain't no redneck!" i howled when the gf suggested this place. But the sign read "gourmet" waffle sandwiches, and this intrigued me just enough to try it, much like if Pabst were to release a special Gold Ribbon brew. Sure enough, she was right again. Although the menu boasts a variety of fancy choices, we played it safe and shared the turkey club, mostly because i didn't want to spend another $9 bucks, and after one bite both regretted the decision to share. Hella delicious! Thank god for the waffle fries or the situation could have turned out ugly... I'm not above resorting to trickery when i'm hungry. "OMG!! LOOK OVER THERE!!!" *nom*nom* 蔣ou know they got a good thing going on at Bruxie when after finishing our sandwich, we stared into each others eyes, and blurted in unison, "let's get a waffle maker!"

Could the latest occupant of the Dairy Treet ice cream shack retain the delicious ice cream and offer something extra? Yes! 蔣es! 蔣es! Gourmet Belgium waffles and great ice cream? 蔔o...actually...better!! 蔜he waffles are thin, light and crispy. 蔜he ice cream is actually frozen custard, think and eggy...yum!! We ordered a savory (Buttermilk Fried Chicken & Waffle) and a sweet (Creme Brulee Waffle.) 蔜he chicken was a thin breast cooked in 100% peanut oil, similar to, but lighter than what you'd get a Chik-Fil-A. 蔜he Creme Brulee Waffle was a special and had bananas and whipped cream. 蔜he vanilla frozen custard was cool, rich and thick with a nice smooth texture. 蔠e accompanied it with a hot cup of fresh Peet's coffee. The walk up service was friendly and thorough. 蔄 plesant young man delivered the orders promptly from the pick-up window and was there to supply extra maple syrup. 蔍n a nice touch they said I could ask for my frozen custard at the end of the meal. When can we go back?

3.5 stars! This place is delicious but not worth the wait... I definitely would come back just at a time where it isn't that crowded. I've tried their custard and a couple different savory sandwiches. It's all very good in my opinion, you can't really make any bad choices at this place. Oh yeah, parking is a bitch! It's in a nice little quaint area though.

Me and one of my teammates had just flown in from OAK to LB airport for the two day weekend of dragon boat. Where we met up with a few teammates that night to see what we wanted to do for dinner since it was pretty late. Luckily, we got there just in time to get our orders placed before they closed (I think it was 5 minutes before closing time) The prices were a bit high but the food was delicious! I had order the Roasted Mushroom & Goat Cheese and it was good. Even though the Balsamic Vinegar made the waffle soggy, it was over all yummy! My friends(teammates) had ordered the Buttermilk Fried Chicken & Waffle and it was good. Some had even order the desert which was just the waffle and Nutella. If I was down in the neighborhood again (Long Beach) I will definitely come back!

I was a Bruxie-virgin and went there today for lunch with two of my friends. I'd heard it was really good. I had no idea! I got the custard and made the mistake of getting it in a cone. Not because it was bad or the cone was bad, both in fact were delish, but it was a lot to eat and I still had a sandwich to get to! But yeah the custard was awesome. I got the fried chicken sandwich minus the coleslaw and was completely unprepared for just how big and delicious it was. I would have fasted for two days beforehand had I known how good it was going to be just so I could have eaten it all in one sitting. Chicken = huge, seasoned, hot and crispy. Waffle = holy cow yum. Combined? Heaven in my hands. Seating could certainly be increased (but even if they turned the entire parking lot into a patio, I think it would still be packed), but thankfully we got a table. If you can't get a table, just walk over to Chapman and enjoy it on the campus. I can't wait to take my husband there!

Went here for the first time after dinner at Haven on a Friday raining night and it was delicious! The only problem I have with this place is the parking, but if you're lucky to find one the food makes it up. My boyfriend had the Bruxie Sunday, 蔍 had their s'more waffle, and my friends had the custard ice cream. �The Bruxie Sunday was the winner of the night. It comes with a waffle, toped with custard ice cream, chocolate, whipped cream, peanuts, and it was HUGE! The s'more waffle was okay, it was a waffle sandwich with chocolate and melted marshmallow inside and I don't think I would order that again b/c it's something you can make at home. The custard ice cream came in a waffle cone and it was creamy, light and I think I would just get that next time I come here. Sadly we already had dinner b/c I wanted to try their chicken and waffles.

I had been dying to try this place for ages. Being all the way out in the OC does not help. They need more locations and preferably one in LA. Just looking at all the pictures makes my mouth water. Finally we decided to stop in for brunch since we would be out in that area (Disneyland!) anyways. It was quite a windy day and all they have is outdoor seating so it wasn't ideal. But you definitely want to enjoy the food on the spot. I can see it getting soggy if you tried to bring it home (esp if you lived far away). Ordered their two most popular or top waffles - the bruxie burger and the chicken/waffles. Everything else on the menu sounded really delicious too. They also have seasonal things on their little blackboard. I was intrigued by their strawberry cheesecake dessert waffle. But alas, we were too full to try it. Anyways back to the burger and chicken. The waffle itself is, I think of the brussels variety, as in they are very light and crispy and not doughy like the Belgium waffles you get at Denny's or Ihop. So I think that pairs well with all the different toppings they have. 蔍 have to say the burger is a little underwhelming. There's nothing too special about it. Just a meat patty with cheese, tomatoes and lettuce. It also felt really heavy to be eating in the morning. The chicken was the better of the two, I think. I like that there was some syrup to add sweetness and there was some spice on the chicken that gave it a bit of a kick. I would totally get that again. One order is the perfect size for a meal. But getting two to share with a friend is definitely better. Will definitely be back to try their other menu items. Can't wait. Tiny parking lot with about 4 spaces. It's located in a residential area right across from a university so there's some street parking. And most waffles are under $10. You also order at the window and they have 2 runners/waiters cleaning tables and bringing the food out to you.

This place was the BOMB! well on certain things only. . . I know, I know the fried chicken and lemon berry ones are the most popular but I must say, they were not my favorite. I actually didn't care for either. I LOVED LOVED LOVED the bacon, egg & cheese one and the nutella banana one!!! OH MY WORD!!! they were both amazing. too bad I had to share them with my husband and cousins. . . booooooo. a few warnings: 1/ be ready to stand in line (I didn't stand in line but I've heard plus with ONE order window. . . go figure) 2/ be ready to not be able to pee, no restrooms! 3/ be ready to eat while standing cause seats are mad limited 4/ be ready to be cold (if you're going at night, they are outside) 5/ be ready to look all over for parking (parking is also limited) is it worth it? HELL YES!!!

The Good: Green Eggs and Ham, 5/5 I inhaled that sucker. Got a little oily/drippy over my hand at the end, but what's a little grease when it tastes like some Dr. Seuss heaven? If you liked this, you might also like the Green Eggs and Ham from Huckleberry in Santa Monica. Strawberry Creme Brulee, 4.5/5 Crispy caramel bits make this dessert great. Service, 4.5/5 Waiting in line sucks, but the Bruxie people are nice and the line moves swiftly. The Bad and the Ugly: Not much to say. Only wish there were more tables. Party of four shared a table for two. Street parking only, but finding a spot wasn't too bad. Overall, great place worth checking out.

Simple & tasty! �Prices are reasonable. 蔈verything was fresh. The waffles are not too thick, not too greasy/buttery, and just right to be folded up. �I gave it 4 out of 5 because of the chicken waffle, but I could have easily given it a 5 stars if it was based on their lemon cream & berries waffle. Buttermilk Chicken, Chili Honey & Slaw Waffle - if you've had Roscoe's, it's not quite the same. 蔍t's satisfying but it was missing something, maybe not enough chili honey? �Lemon Cream & Berries - the lemon cream had a smooth buttery and good bite to it. 蔞ery tasty and not too sweet. 蔒y favorite of the three we tried. Bacon, Egg & Cheddar - sans the mayonnaise, very rich and hearty. 蔒y friends thought it could use more cheese, but I thought it was perfect just the way it came. 蔜he egg is cooked just right, the yolk was ever-so-slightly gooey and runny. 蔣ummy! I'm not sure if he was the chef, (Not sure because I didn't see a name tag, but he was wearing the white bistro chef top) but someone was out delivering dishes to the tables. 蔞ery accommodating and attentive staff. Will definitely be back to try more of their creative concoctions!

Gourmet Waffle Sandwiches have descended upon Orange County & I can tell you from personal experience they are absolutely amazingly delicious. Simply thinking about them, & I'm licking my lips. Oh my heavens... I want one NOW! If you've never been to Bruxie - you don't know what you're missing. It's a quick-serve restaurant located right across from Chapman University in Old Town Orange (corner of Glassell & Palm), that serves over a dozen different sweet & savory waffle sandwiches. & The best part? Nothing on the menu is more than $8! Intrigued? Ready to know what's on the menu? Savory Waffle Sandwiches include: a Bacon, Egg & Cheddar, Prosciutto & Gruyere, Smoked Salmon & Dill Cream Cheese, Sun-Dried Tomatoes & Goat Cheese, Buttermilk Fried Chicken & Waffle, Bruxie Burger & the Cheesy Bruxie. Sweet Waffle Sandwiches include: Fruit & Cream, S'Mores, PB & J, Nutella & Bananas, Lemon Cream & Berries, & Ogura Bruxie. Having tasted literally all of the menu offerings, I can honestly tell you that you won't be disappointed - with anything. & Be sure to add an old-fashioned sugar cane soda, or soft-serve frozen custard to your order for a meal you won't soon forget. Really & truly, this place is my latest obsession. & I'm not alone - on all 3 of my visits, I encountered crazy long lines, but a Bruxie Waffle Sandwich is definitely worth the wait... even my kids agree! Bruxie is opened daily from 9am - 9pm (perfect for breakfast, lunch & dinner), and is located at 292 N. Glassell Street (at Palm Avenue) in Old Towne Orange.

Bruxie's is good for an uncommon waffle burgers and sandwiches but it's kind of expensive for the price you pay. The food taste good which is why I give it a four but its rather expensive and its hard to find seating. The service is quick and the flavors are great. Its a good idea to get a group of friends, than each order something different than share so that you get to try all their seasonal items.

So, I've always had this fantasy of eating every single item on a restaurant's menu (over the course of time... of course!). 蔍 think this is the place I'm going to try it at! �Bruxie is a fun little place - a little walk-up building on the corner with no dining room, a few outdoor tables (with heat lamps, thank goodness) and an eating bar where you can watch traffic go by. 蔜hey actually have a parking lot, believe it or not -- it's tiny and cramped, but for Old Towne, it's a bonus. 蔍 recommend walking. Basically, everything is a waffle sandwich, with either a savory or sweet filling. 蔍 think the most famous choices are the buttermilk fried chicken waffle and the hamburger waffle, but I chose the one with roasted mushrooms, arugula, and goat cheese. 蔕MG, delicious. 蔜he waffle was beautifully and delicately crispy and the flavors were awesome. 蔒y companion got the chicken one and devoured it with zest. �The staff is incredibly friendly and helpful, suggesting menu items (genuinely, not like car salespeople) and coming by multiple times to ask how things were. 蔜hey are awesome. Be warned, it's not a place to linger. 蔈ither get a whole lotta food so you always look like you're still eating, or be prepared to have people breathing down your neck when you get down to the last 1/3 of your waffle! 蔠ith a fun menu where you might want to get up and buy more stuff (like sides, coffee drinks, and desserts), you want to dine leisurely. 蔉or people waiting for your seat, that's the last thing they want. 蔈njoy!

The first time I heard about this place was from a friend, who is a local from the city of orange. I wanted top try it ever since, they have plenty of items on the menu to treat the masses from meat eaters to vegetarians a like. I recently inquired a secret item that one of the owners' Kelly whipped up himself as a throw down made by one of my friends. It was a honey bbq chicken, lettuce, and fried onion strings. One day I went to inquire about this with my girlfriend, so I ended up talking with one of the partners named Dean. It was so secret he ended up calling Kelly and asking him about, because he had yet to come into work and I wanted it. Dean ended up replacing the lettuce with slaw, which paired very nicely. Kelly ended up came up and asked me how I ended up hearing about the story, so he told what happened. Well to make a long story short, he told me he would make it a "spec" so the chefs would know how to prepare it next time I ask. Im putting it out, because it was so delicious and I wanted everyone to know about it. I posted a picture of it too, so you all can ask for it so it will become a regulare or even a secret item menu lol enjoy

I came back here sooner than I thought I would. this time I tried the most talked about fried chicken waffle, and with my way too high of an expectation, the entire fried chicken waffle kind of fell short. I was left underwhelmed. I dont know what it was about this one, i was expecting something savory/little spicy kind, but the fried chicken tasted like just chicken, I wish I had KFC chicken or Chruchs in this waffle, it would have tasted so wonderfully devine! On the other hand i tried my friends Pulled Pork Bruxie, om freaking god, it was so amazing. I hope they figure out how to make a good fried chicken, but for now, I will keep my vote for Roscoes chicken and waffle, 'coz its much better there, but for everything else, I lean to Bruxie side!!! Next things on my list to try - short rib , everyone keeps telling me how awesomely delicious these are, so gotta try it. - oh the hamburger one. it looked mouth wateringly good!!! so i am so there for that next time! Bruxie dear! for now i am gonna leave you at the 4 stars, even though the fried chicken was such a disappointment for me, 'coz you made it all up with the pulled pork! but seriously get it together girl!!! :)

This was my first time ever having anything like this....a gourmet waffle sandwich...and I must say, I am definitely a fan! 蔜his small little eatery stand is located just across from Chapman University and offers delicious sandwiches with an unusual spin. �When I first checked out this place, it was about an hour before the start of the Superbowl, so me and my boyfriend were expecting the place to be somewhat empty. 蔅ut to our amazement, even during Superbowl Sunday, the line was pretty darn long. 蔜he wait wasn't too bad though as the waiters/servers entertained us. The menu is broken down into two sections- savory or sweet. 蔒e and my boyfriend are both heavy meat-eaters, so we chose the savory side of the menu. 蔋e had their most popular, the fried chicken and waffles sandwich (which comes with a side of coleslaw), while I had the breakfast sandwich that contains bacon, eggs, cheese, and mayo. 蔍 also ordered my sandwich with a side of maple syrup through their recommendation. 蔠e also ordered a side of the waffle fries. 蔄s for drinks, my boyfriend got the Vanilla Cream Soda and I got a latte (All their coffees and teas are from Peet's Coffee & Teas). Verdict: 蔒e and my boyfriend both loved our sandwiches and loved how the usage of waffles as a substitute for bread gave the sandwich an extra crunch. 蔋owever, we both weren't too crazy about the maple syrup they gave us to dip our sandwiches in. 蔜he syrup seemed like a sweet chili sauce you'd get at an Asian restaurant with your egg rolls instead a sweet maple syrup. 蔍nstead, we both used basic maple syrup we had in the fridge. 蔄nd as for my boyfriend's Vanilla Cream Soda, it was a lot lighter tasting than we expected. 蔍t was more of a subtle sweet taste that wasn't overpowering. 蔜he service was also friendly and great! Cons: 蔜here are limited seats here! 蔍 understand it's an old building, so additions would probably go against the town's policy of keeping these historical buildings. 蔒y boyfriend and I just took our food to go to save us the headache of finding a table and to catch the game in the nick of time.

Loved it. 蔒y husband got Chicken and I got Prosciutto. The first bite of crunchy waffle was really lovely. We bought 100% maple syrup for $1.00 for chicken. I thought it was .50. We thought it is much better with syrup, but did not use even half of it. So maybe, they can sell smaller container for cheaper? Cannot wait to try everything in the menu.

This was my first "chicken and waffle" experience so i don't have much to base my review on but I must say that Bruxie rocks! The waffle was fluffy and crisp.. I was expecting it to become soggy.. Nope, not at all. I got the chicken and waffle and my bf got the bacon and egg.. both were fantastic! When we went it was rainy outside so it wasn't that busy and the wait wasn't that long but I could see this place having a long wait.. I think we waited at least 20 mins and there was only 2 people in front of us. Oh well, not a big deal. The lemon cream waffle sounded really good.. didn't get it this time but when I go back this will definitely get ordered!

I was skeptical to try Bruxie because I'm not a huge fan of waffles in general. If I do order waffles, I like the soft, fluffy ones. I'm not a huge fan of the thick, crispy type. But since it was a different concept, I decided to try it. Brussel's Waffe- These waffles were buttered and dusted with powder sugar. I took a bite of these before trying any of the sandwiches just so I knew how the waffle tasted by itself, if it 蕎as going to be heavy, doughy or too thick. I took a bite out of one, and WOW, it was exactly how it was described on the website. They were light and crispy. Not doughy at all, they were very airy. You'd think with the thickness of the waffle that it would be heavy to eat. It wasn't at all. It was a nice 'appetizer' of things to come. I ordered my bacon, egg and cheese waffle sandwich with waffle fries. They must've sprinkled the fries with crack (figuratively speaking of course, duh!) because I couldn't stop eating them. They were so good. 蔜he sandwich had Tillamook cheddar, mayo, applewood smoked bacon 蔭long with 2 fried eggs in between the waffle. Rather than leaving the bacon in strips, it was cut into little pieces. The bacon was crispy and you got it in every bite. The egg was perfectly made. The yolk wasn't runny but it was still wet. Bruxie's burger- Two angus beef patties with pickles, mayo, lettuce, cheddar cheese and tomato. 蔜he sandwich wasn't overloaded with the condiments. Words cannot describe what my mouth was experiencing. It was juicy but the waffle didn't get soggy at all. The burger had a good char to it but didn't taste burned. 蔜he patties are made medium unless you specify otherwise. 蔜here was a great balance in flavors between the patties and the waffle. 蔣ou get that crunch when biting into the waffle then you get that bite of the juicy burger. 蔍t is definitely a great twist to your typical burger. Buttermilk fried chicken and waffle- I know that whenever SoCal'ers hear chicken and waffles, Roscoe's comes to mind. Well, don't think that when you come to this place. 蔍f you are craving Roscoe's 蔯hicken and waffles, go to Roscoe's because this sandwich is nothing like Roscoe's. But that's not a bad thing at all. Remember, this is a chicken and waffle sandwich. This sandwich had 2 big pieces of chicken tenders topped with coleslaw and spread with chili honey. The coleslaw wasn't drowned with the dressing. You can taste the flavor of the chili but it was toned down because it was mixed in with the honey. You would think that this would be a heavy sandwich and dry sandwich, but it wasn't. 蔜he chicken tenders were moist and well seasoned and the addition of the chili honey gave it a really different taste. �The last item, the strawberry creme brulee waffle is a seasonal item and is 蕁ot on their regular menu. . I love creme brulee. It is one of my all time favorite desserts. So I had to try this. Yes, I still had room for dessert. Sandwiched between the waffles were creme brulee, bananas and strawberries. This was TO DIE FOR! Both the strawberries and bananas were bruleed. They had that crispy sugar coating and I could've eaten that by itsef. The cream wasn't too sweet either, but you can taste the caramelization of the sugar in each bite. Some of it even oozed out onto the paper tray it came in. Don't think for a second I let that go to waste either. It was a different take on creme brulee. Amazing service and amazing food. Totally recommend this place. BTW, this was my experience on my first trip there. I've been there 5 or 6 other times. Still amazing!

Bruxie may well be my best find in the past few years. 蔈verything I have had has been superb. �Highly recomend the Wild Mushroom and Arugula and the Braised Beef Short Rib sandwiches. The strawberry shake is an absolute must and like no other as it is custard based.

Lovers of brunch and all things yummy: you need to check this place out- multiple times in fact. When I got to this wonderful waffle stand on the corner of Glassell and Palm I realized I couldn't try everything all on one trip. Solution: bring your friends and order lots...and don't skip the seasonal fruit creme brulee waffle.

Me and my food-crazy boyfriend, Victor, read about Bruxie in the Westways Magazine from the Auto Club (March/April 2011 issue). 蔜hey had a great review of this waffle place, so on this sunny Saturday afternoon we checked it out for lunch. �Victor had the buttermilk fried chicken & waffle with syrup. I had the Bruxie Burger with no mayo. 蔠e both loved it! 蔜he meat was cooked perfectly, the waffle was not too sweet, not too mushy or hard. 蔍t held up to the last bite. 蔜he waffle fries were amazing - great mix of salt, pepper, and flavor. 蔞ery fresh. �We will definitely come back for more and to try the sweet dessert waffles choices. 蔜he service was outstanding too. 蔠hile in line waiting, we had employees give out menus and answered questions. 蔄fter we ordered we didn't wait long for food to get to our table.

The food is pretty good, but not worth going out of my way for. I ordered the Prosciutto & Gruyere, but wasn't that impressed. I think all the hype on yelp made me expect too much. My boyfriend ordered the Bacon, Egg, & Cheddar. I definitely preferred his over my own waffle sandwich. We split the Strawberry Creme Brulee (seasonal). HUGE mistake. I wanted that WHOLE thing to myself! The eating area is outside & can get crowded. Since it was too cold outside & there weren't any seats, we ended up eating in our car. Luckily, the food is easy to eat & not too messy.

I had the Prosciutto & Gruyere Savory Waffle Sandwich ($6.95-7.00) and it was unexpectedly very, very delicious. Only thing is, it might not be entirely filling as a dinner because i ended up sharing a dessert waffle (about $7-$8) and two orders of 蔯urly fries ($3) with two other people, and since the menu can be a little pricey, it could add up. However, I've never had anything like these sandwiches and I'm definitely coming back. Old Town Orange is also a really nice area with many small and unique businesses. It's mostly all curb-side parking, but Bruxie has a small area for about 7 or 8 vehicles right next to it. It's almost like a little shack and its all out-door seating; a canopy thing if it's cold. I recommend this place as a definite must-try!

I gave them a 3, but I think they have potential and capitalized on a great business opportunity. I got the Green Eggs and Ham w/o mayo. It was delish, but a little greasy. The $5 California Strawberry shake was not as good as I was hoping it would be. It was very heavy and tasted like it was made from preserves and a couple of strawberries. I will definitely go back to try it again. Possibly the smores sammy.

Bring your wet-naps! So I'm giving Bruxie a 4, could be a 5 with minor adjustments. Very tasty food and great idea. I tried two delectable, what I'm naming, Waffiches. Quick note: Some guy in a previous rating gave a ridiculous review and complained about the chicken and waffle not having a Cajun taste (which he fantasized and is not in the description)...hmmm, it's not supposed to taste Cajun. Think about what you are reviewing when giving a review. Positives: Good specials. 蔍 tried the braised beef with the goat cheese that had a prefect blend of flavors. 蔜he sauce is a must btw! The second was the strawberry vanilla creme. It was also very tasty, it had a perfect little crunch to it, but.....needed a light cream of some type. �Whipped cream cheese would be amazing. Negatives: The roast beef waffiche had too much grease. 蔜ake some grease off and it would be perfect. 蔄lso, they need wet-naps!

Me & my wife decided to order two sandwiches and split them in half. Tried the buttermilk fried chicken and the mushroom special, bruxie fries and the strawberry lemonade. Paid approx $22 Food was good Price is okay Portions are okay (more about quality and not quantity) Service was good We went at 6:30pm and 10 people in line. And most of the seats were taken except for one. Outside seating only ... it was little cold so we took it to go. Parking lot is very small but most customers walk there and so we had no problems parking.

The concept is really cool! The owners are really nice and the food hasn't let me down yet. My husband and I live around the corner and love to walk there to have a sandwich and yummy drink. Our favorite is the Chicken Sandwich. The coleslaw and chili sauce is really good, but you need to add the syrup too and it just pulls it all together. I have tried their burger and it was good and tasty. My only complaint is that the burger made the waffle soggy. This is in a perfect location for Chapman University, so they are always busy. I can imagine that parking is difficult, but that area is usually a pain. Keep in mind this is a small little place so they don't have only but about 5 parking spaces available in their lot, and then you have to find street parking. Other than that, all I can tell you is that it is Totally Worth it!

Bruxie is just amazing. 蔜heir light, crispy Belgian waffles are perfection and the fillings are excellent, ranging from salmon with dill sauce to plain old egg and bacon breakfast sandwiches (wrapped in a waffle!). Go on the off-hours (not 10:00 AM, not 12:00 noon). 蔆ome back for a dessert waffle and a shake.

I was a bit intimidated by the crowded outdoor seating and long line but the line moved super fast and there was a few tables open by the time our food came. I had to try the highly recommended fried chicken + waffle. One of my friends ordered the same and the other had the recommended burger. I was pleased with my chicken + waffle but it was much more oily than I would've desired. Also, the size of my chicken was significantly smaller than my friend's who ordered the same thing! Not too much of a concern for me but I can see how this may bother others. The definite standout is the waffle. The best waffle I ever had (even with all that oil!) and the edges were crisped to perfection! I'd definitely return to try everything on the menu especially the sweet waffles!

Bruxie!!! 蔠hat an ingenious idea. 蔄lthough waffles have been making a comeback in the recent years with their claim to fame pairing with ice cream as dessert, a food stand wholly dedicated to waffles is simply novel! �The goods: Lemon Cream and Berries - deeeelish! 蔍'm a big fan of lemon and all things tart so this is a great combination with the savory (waffle) and sweet/tart (berries/lemon). Prosciutto and Gruyere - I remember it being warm and cheesy. 蔍'm not sure if the combination of the two works with each other. 蔍t would be nice if it had a spicy kick because I ended up drenching it with tapatio. Date shake - Okay, I'm not a big fan of dates. 蔅ut anything doused in cream and sugar, blended with their famous yogurty soft-serve...you can't go wrong. 蔇ate shake for the win! 蔇efinitely enough to share with 3 people at least! 蔍t's great how their shakes are seasonal too. �Parking is very limited but I've managed to snag a spot in the lot both times during peak dinner hours. 蔖ricing is a bit high but you're paying for novelty. 蔛till have yet to try their buttermilk fried chicken & waffle and waffle fries. 蔠ill save that for next time.

The waffle fries are decent. Crispy, not too oily, and just the right amount of salt. The bruxie burger rather lacks taste. The patty is like a tasteless slab of meat, the cheese and veggies were nice, but then everything had this generally coated in oil unpleasantness to it. I personally liked the way their chicken and waffles were seasoned(some may not agree with the amount of sweetness in the sauce), but the coleslaw was awkwardly bitter in contrast and the waffle got soggy too quickly. The mushroom and arugula sandwich(I forget its actual name) was not bad at all. Neither was the sundried tomatoes and cream cheese, or the bacon egg and cheddar(though it was also too gooey for my tastes). The trend seems to be that if you get a sandwich with less filling, it will not overwhelm the waffle and balance is achieved. Lacks tables! Not Bruxie's fault because of the location, but could be quite a hassle if you're coming from far away. I go to Chapman, so in the case of no tables, I can always easily take it to go. �This place is, like yelp said, A-OK. But It's certainly not worth the hype, nor the rather high prices for the amount of food you get. All the employees are very nice though :)

This place is a happy place. When you see the people lining up for the waffle sandwiches and the outdoor seating with the red tables, it takes you back to the memories of summer being full of sunshine and outdoor activities,....for me at least. Whenever I come here I get really excited cause I always want to try something new, especially since Ive heard that all the sandwiches are really good, whether savory or sweet. 蔜hese sandwiches work because they manage to make the waffle the perfect substitute for bread in sandwiches. The first time I came to Bruxie a couple of months ago , I tried the Bruxie burger and the Buttermilk Fried Chicken & Waffle, both with waffle fries. In my opinion, I thought the Bruxie burger was the best of the two because it was way more savory, tasty and filling, Dont get me wrong, the chicken was good too, but towards the end, the syrup made the waffle soggy and difficult to eat and the entire sandwich started to fall apart. You could skip the waffle fries too. I recently came back because I was excited to to find out that they had added some savory new specials during the week . This time, 蔍 ordered the pastrami sandwich (7.95) and the Irish Nachos (5.95?) . While the pastrami was really nice and flavorable, it was also a little hard to eat because every bite had that "stringy" effect where you have to pull and rip away from your sandwich to get a clean bite. The best part of this sandwich was the pickle they put in it. Since the sandwich is more on the salty side, the sourness and refreshing taste of the pickle makes the whole thing balance out more. The irish nachos were good for the first few bites (waffle fries being topped with cheese, sour cream and bacon), but in the end you realize youre just left with waffles fries and that its just okay. Thats when I realized I should have just split a sweet bruxie sandwich instead, which is what I'm going to do next time. All in all, this is definitely a place you have to come try for yourself because it's a creative and fun meal with so many options, whether savory or sweet, you'll find something that satisfies your taste buds.

Light, thin, delicious waffles. 蔖erfect size for sandwiching various meats and fillings. I had the fried chicken with waffles & the prosciutto and gruyere with waffles. �The fried chicken was bland for my taste and was layered with coleslaw and chili honey. 蔍 wasn't that impressed. 蔒aybe my expectations were skewed because i had anticipated the salty-greasy chicken served at Roscoe's. 蔛o for those that enjoy a "healthier" version of fried chicken with a bit of seasoning, this may be up your alley. The prosciutto and Gruyere with whole grain mustard and chives was delicious! 蔜he prosciutto provided it's usual saltiness to the sandwich, which was balanced by the hint of sweet in the waffle batter, and the cheese gave a creamy consistency that melted it all together. 蔜his was delicious! Depending on the time of day, parking can be a bit difficult because their parking lot only hold a handful of cars, so you're left searching for street parking. 蔜he service is quick, the servers are friendly, and the food is quality.

Heard about this place from a friend, then saw it on one of my favorite food blogs and just had to try it. I was intrigued by the concept of a waffle being used as the bread for sandwiches, and new I had to try their take of chicken and waffles. I have to say that I was a little disappointed, but maybe it's because my expectations were a bit too high. I got the Prosciutto & Gruyere, which was okay. The cheese wasn't as melted as I would have liked, and there wasn't enough in the sandwich to really call it a sandwich. Bf got the fried chicken and it was pretty good, but it was definitely no Roscoe's! I think the best thing about this place are the waffles themselves, because they are perfectly fluffy and warm. I would go back just to eat the waffles. It's pretty cool that they have a seasonal menu though, so I would want to try the mushroom sandwich. Overall, $7 for a sandwich is a bit pricey for me, but it's worth trying and the service is great, it's outdoor self seating but the guy still serves you all out. Try if you're in Orange!

I had to aDrizzle aDat aMaple aSyrup.. all over that thing...- quick reference to epicmealtime hahah. But yeah not really worth it for the food.. no restrooms btw.. and to clean your hands?? Freakin sanitizer and some paper towels... freakin jenky yo!

Bruxie is located on a corner near Chapman University. 蔜here is 3-4 parking spots in the back and about 8-10 tables outside. I spent about 15 minutes driving around trying to find parking and be really aware of where you park because alot of the street parking near Bruxie is parking only by permit. You order from the window and either get it to-go or the food is brought to you by the super nice people working there. While waiting in line the people working there would ask if you had any questions and even the chef walked out to see how you liked the food. I got the recommended braised short rib with carmelized onions and horseradish potatoes. 蔛o I took the first bite, got the sweetness of the onions, the bite/nasal clearing effects of the horseradish, and ....almost nothing from the meat. After being told it was braised for 12 hours, I was expecting a lot of flavor but even trying to eat the meat by itself I was left disappointed. I got the waffles fries and thought it was ok. Some were crisp while some pieces were stuck together and not as crisp. I thought the idea of using waffles were clever and they add a different texture but I would give this sandwich this time a 3. However, they really redeemed themselves with the desserts. I got the Liege Waffle with carmelized pearl sugar and nutella and belgian chocolate on the side and frozen custard. OMG!!!! Dipping a small piece of warm waffle into the belgian chocolate with its hint of bitterness (kinda like dark chocolate) then grabbing another piece and dipping it into the creamy nutty Nutella.. 蔜hen once you're in chocolate heaven you bite a spoonful of the cold custard.. then once in awhile you will get a crunch from the carmelized pearl sugar. Soooo GOOD!! Definitely worth a 5!! I wish I could give it a 3.5 but due to the difficulty I had parking I'll give it a 3.

I'm kicking myself so hard right now for not ordering another waffle!!!! FML! 蔍 had to make my first Bruxie experiment a drive by and was in such a hurry I failed to closely examine the menu, so after I ordered my chicken and waffle I heard another customer order a prosciutto and gruyere. 蔜hat's when I first started beating myself up, then I looked at the rest of the savory side menu...DANG!!! So after I drove off with my chicken and waffle I made it a point to slowly chew and taste each bite. �FAIL, I was that driver going in circles in the Glassel roundabout trying to cool my mouth after biting into the steaming chicken. 蔜hough it was a nice burn, I'm coming back with an empty stomach and a laundry list of waffle sandwiches to try.

I love love love Bruxie! Everything I've had from there has been so delicious that I can't decide which was the best. Their lemonade is good too. I love the warm crispiness of the waffle texture in place of regular bread. The waffle is made so it's not sweet so it doesn't interfere with taste of the food. It's all about texture! This is what the chef explained to us when he came out to greet everyone.

Here's the gist: 蕋he buttermilk chicken waffle - lacks flavor. Chicken is tender nicely cooked but it seems like it's missing some saltiness to it. The prosciutto wd cheese: perfect medley of saltiness of the prosciutto, creamy cheese, tangy mustard seeds. Yum! Lemon cream wd berries: nice play of tangy lemon n sweet berries. I luv how their waffles are light n airy making it so crispy especially when u first get it on your table. The maple syrup is also not too sweet, a great complement to any meal. Hot belgian chocolate was also wonderful.

i've been to this place too many times and only now i've decided to put my two cents in, how inconsiderate of me. okay, i highly recommend this place, not only that their waffle sandwhiches are good, but service is awesome! my favorite? smoked salmon & dill cream cheese, prosciutto & gruyere, and, sun-dried tomatoes & goat cheese. you're just gonna have to experience it for yourself and tell everyone about it. you won't be disappointed. to my out of town friends visiting me, expect to find yourself at this place if you come and visit me. oh yeah! expect long lines specially on the weekends.

It used to be an ancient old ice cream and hamburger stand. 蔜here's no inside seating (Think "stand"), no restroom, precious little parking, nearly everything comes on a waffle served on a cardboard tray, and there is always a line out the door. Or, at least there would be, if Bruxie actually had a door (remember the hamburger "stand"?). Why the line? Because, at $5 to $8 per item, Bruxie provides an affordable and unpretentious entree to some fine food. 蔛omeone in the kitchen clearly had some serious training in a serious kitchen before turning his talents to the whimsical waffle sandwich. �As exhibit number one I direct your attention to today's braised short rib and caramelized onion sandwich. 蔉orget the tender meat, the sweet deep-amber onions, or the piquant bits of crumbled cheese. 蔄ny particularly good cook could have done the same. 蔠hat sets this sandwich apart is the sauce nestled by its side, a sophisticated variation on sauce Espagnole, a deep rich chocolaty-brown 蔯oncentration of beef and vegetal flavors. 蔜his sauce is to jus as lobster is to fish sticks. (That, by the way, is the answer to question 127 of the 2011 S.A.T. exam.) Is a sandwich on a waffle a gimmick? 蔖erhaps. 蔅ut, if so, isn't a savory crepe a gimmick? Isn't a tortilla "wrap" a gimmick? Heck, wasn't the first bread sandwich a gimmick? Gimmick or not, I'm going back.

Delicious but yet confused. Combination of combining sweets to savory just took on a whole new meaning. I order chicken and waffles along with their strawberry creme brulee. 蔉rom bite to bite, my thoughts stir up not understanding how something this simple can taste so dankie. The settle sweetness from the slaw, soft crunch of the waffle and savory taste of their chicken is what made sign up on yelp for me to write this review. Service I got from natalie was like a breathe of fresh air. Welcoming smile, fast service and overall a place I would highly recommend. �Natalie you're awesome and deserve recognition for being so awesome. Thank you for recommending 蕋he strawberry creme brulee. Every bite made me go deeper into a world full of strawberries and sweetness. Place is dank... Ahh huh

I heard about Bruxie in the OC Weekly, and it sounded fantastic. I had never tried chicken and waffles and this seemed like the place to go. My wife ended up getting a more desert-like waffle, and i changed my mind and got the special: Prime-Rib, caramelized onions, and horseradish! All served in a crispy waffle. Melted in my mouth. I hoped it would be good, but it was even better than i expected. You have to be prepared for the kind of restaurant this is. There is no indoor seating and the tables are small. Seating is limited and so is parking. One should take all this into account so as not to be unpleasantly surprised when you get there. Still haven't had my chicken and waffles. I guess i'll just have to go back...

This place is yummy, just opened a couple months ago and will be a big hit in the OC. 蔋oping they open in Fullerton/Anaheim area soon! We ordered the chicken and waffle sandwich with a side of maple syrup. 蔍t was fantastic! 蔋int: ask to have it cut in half so you can handle it. 蔠affle was light, moist, and slightly crisp while chicken was all white meat breast fried perfectly, definitely needs the side of maple to get the full flavor effect. 蔠e also ordered the bruxie burger - great burger, I recommend it. 蔋uge, I thing there were two patties with standard lettuce, tomato, and light mayo. 蔠e washed it down with an egg nog shake, it couldn't have been better until the owner (I think he was the owner) joked about adding brandy to it. �Seemed a little pricey for those 3 items: $21 but The staff is very friendly and helpful. 蔍f you dine in, be warned it's all outside and has 7 or 8 tables and they will bring your food to your table. I will definitely be back to try the proscuitto and gruyere waffle with the belgian chocolate shake!

I love this place so much. It is absolutely amazing. I am a huge fan of their strawberry lemonade and smoked salmon waffle with cream cheese. The Irish Nachos were good, but I got sick of them after a while. I highly recommend giving this place a try. They have a big selection and good service. It's a small outdoor place though so there is not much seating space.

I remember when this place was a teriyaki-burger joint just a few months ago and walking by it was kind of gross and depressing. Then there came an amazing idea to renovate it and turn it into waffle-mazing! I've been here about a handful of times and I get the same thing everytime: Bruxie Burger and Nutella, bananas, and cream. I always split with somebody else and it's a good amount without overloading on the waffles, plus best of both worlds. I love that the burger comes with "mayo-butter" and the nutella with "sweet cream" these two sauces make the waffles all the more waffle-mazing. Although they don't have the regular soft drink products, they make their own sodas which are "natural". I usually don't like really sweet drinks, so even the diet cola was a bit too sweet for me, but if you like sweet drinks, I would try it out. On weekends for lunch time or early dinner there is people lined up and takes a good while to order, get your food, and eat. So going around an off hour or during the weekday is the best bet.

Sweet and savory waffles! 蔋eck yeah. 蔒y co-worker/food friend and I went here for the first time today. 蔠e will definately be stopping by a lot more from now on. 蔛ince we were Bruxie newbies we got two different ones and shared. 蔍t was lunch time so we went with savory and had 蕋he buttermilk fried chicken & waffle and the sun dried tomatoes & goat cheese. 蔖lus we had to try the waffle fries so we each got our own order. 蔄s I type this I am so stuffed!!! Buttermilk fried chicken & waffle: 蔞ery tasty. 蔜he chicken was good and had a hint of mustard in the seasoning. 蔍t comes with a side of chili honey & coleslaw. 蔜he chili honey was perfect. I dipped my waffle fries in it too because it was that good. Sun dried tomatoes & goat cheese waffle- 蔙eally savory and good. 蔜hey pack it full of sun dried tomatoes and goat cheese. 蔍t also had arugula in it. �Suprisingly the sun dried tomato & goat cheese was my favorite of the two. 蔍 will definately be going back to try each different waffle. 蔋eck, I might go back tonight and try a sweet waffle. 蔍f it wasn't pouring rain 蔍 might get one of their frozen custards which sound delicious.

My friends and I came here on a Saturday for lunch. There was quite a line but it went by fast and soon enough we had our food and a standing table. My friends and I ordered the bruxie burger, the fried chicken one, and the pulled pork sandwich. My friends said the bruxie burger tasted just like, well, a burger... I didn't try it. I was turned off enough by the soggy bottom of the waffle that was pink from the blood. BUT the waffle with fried chicken and cole slaw and the pulled pork sandwich = fucking bomb. YUMYUMYUM. Soo delicious and there's so many other sandwiches I want to try and drinks too. My friend and I got strawberry milkshakes, soo good in the beginning but kind of overkill at the end of the meal. We were all sooo stuffed!! FREAKING DELICIOUS waffle sandwiches and waffle fries. Don't be scared of the line. It went by super quick and we got our food really fast. Yeah, there's not really enough tables and no bathroom. But it's not really supposed to be a sit down restaurant and I think it adds a special feel to Bruxie. Definitely coming back again. I thought this place was going to be like roscoes.. Waffles and fried chicken but now eaten as a sandwich... And not as great as the hype. But I was wrong. This place shits on Roscoe's.

All the stars are purely for creativity, excellent use of a former waste of good real estate, and "real food" options like old fashioned soda with cane sugar. For me, the appeal ends there. Let me be honest: this is fat people food. On a Monday night just after 7 PM, it was overflowing with overweight patrons, literally every seated customer was obese. That led me to this conclusion: Bruxie is a great place for a unique snack on your way to Rutabagorz, Haven Gastro Pub, or even Byblos Cafe. It can definitely add to a great evening at The Circle, but it can't make a meal...unless you're fat and planning on getting fatter as soon as possible. I had the seasonal special with wild mushrooms, which came with an ironic handful of spring mix on top (still not any healthier!). These are yeasted waffles so they are light and airy, but due to the grease it still feels heavy in my tummy. I also tried a Liege waffle with "pearl sugar" (chunks of sugar) baked into the waffle, it was too dense for me and it left a potent taste of sugar in my mouth. Remember when you were little and you used to eat pure sugar in the form of cotton candy or "rock" candy? It was like that, unfortunately for me I haven't enjoyed the taste of pure sugar since I was 9 years old. I will probably try this place again, and I hope you do to: Old Towne Orange is such a great area and Bruxie gets 4 stars for adding to its charm with such a creative concept.

there are specific times in life when you remember when you had something new and innovative yet so simple and you are angry at yourself for not thinking of it first. the following are some examples in my life: -kawaii not http://-linkedin.com -portal and bruxie has just been added to that list. i mean, waffle sandwiches aren't anything mind boggling, but the way that bruxie does it is brilliant. very light and crispy and using really good and fresh ingredients make it awesome. actually, i have no idea if they are fresh, but they taste like it. last time i got two specials, so i have no idea if they'll still be on the menu. i got a home made corn beef hash and egg sandwich which was awesome. and a strawberry cheesecake one. both were freaking ridiculous. i only hope this is not the new asian trend like boba/pc bang/guppy tea house/donuts and these waffle sandwiches stay awesome.

Still awesome! Went again last weekend and had the smoked salmon and dill cream cheese waffle sandwich. Dang!! It was soooo good. Perfect combination of smoky salmon offset by the herb-y goodness of the cream cheese. The waffle was the perfect "bread" for this delightful concoction. It is currently my fave on the menu! The cool, refreshing strawberry lemonade was the perfect drink as well. Can't wait to go back!

I've been meaning to come here for a while, ever since I found out they served burgers that were made with waffles instead of buns. WAFFLES. Ingenious. I was so excited my friend suggested we all go there for lunch yesterday! Parking is a bit hard to find at this place, we ended up parking about 3 blocks away and walking here. But it was such a nice walk!! Is it downtown or old town Orange?, is gorgeoussssss. I loved looking at all the buildings and really appreciating all the old houses and architecture and how they converted a lot of houses that bruxie is on into businesses. It had a real southern feeling to the place, I love it! If yelp rated cities, I would have so many positive things to write about this little part of town. Anyways, back to bruxie, there were 3 of us so we shared 3 savory options and a sweet option. We got the bruxie burger, the chicken and waffle, and the pulled pork, with the strawberry creme br瀕巈 as dessert. I tried the burger first. For all the hype of this being one of the more popular items on the menu, it was disappointing. The patty was essentially flavorless. Just grilled up ground meat, I couldn't taste any seasonings of any sort. How sad. I put a lot of ketchup and chula sauce to make up for the lack of flavor. The chicken and waffles was what I tried next, and this one was pretty yummy. I like that the chicken is fried very well with a super crispy exterior and a very juicy and tender 蔵nterior. The cole slaw complimented it very well and of course maple syrup ties the whole thing together. Definitely something I would get again. The pulled pork was last. I felt that the flavor profile was kinda similar to the chicken because of the Cole slaw flavor, but it was still pretty decent. Could use a stronger BBQ flavor in my opinion. I liked it better than the bruxie burger, but the meat could still have more flavor. The strawberry creme br瀕巈 was the winner of the meal in my opinion, but then I'm very partial to desserts. :p The custard was so good with the strawberries and they really did br瀕巈 the parts exposed on the edge of the waffle. So good! This place makes really good waffles and I think that was the highlight of every item we tried. Fresh fragrant and soft, but with the slight crunch on the outside when you bite into it...yumo. Service was excellent here as well, the staff were constantly walkin sound picking up trash to throw away for you and asking if you needed anything else or if you liked your food. Great people here! Although i gave them a 4, but I feel like they need to flavor up their meats a bit. Definitely better than a 3 though.

Yes, please. You can't even call this place a waffle place even though that's what it is. It's so much more than that! The combos and flavors are unbelievable... you can't believe it's a between a waffle. These aren't your ordinary Bisquick waffles. They're crispy, flaky, and super tasty. We've basically tried them all and you can't lose. Even the plain waffle with powdered sugar is something to write home about. I'd skip the to go if you can help it, but if you can't , make sure you open those containers so you don't come home to sog.

There's a bruxie opening up in my neighborhood of brea and I thought I'd try out the original place first. It was a small sit outside area but I kind of liked it, the vibe just seemed to fit. I ordered the green eggs and ham seasonal item and my bf ordered the bacon egg and cheese bruxie. 5 minutes after sitting, our food came and it was ahhhhmazing. The pesto on my sandwich with the ham and eggs, I was salivating with each bite. My bfs bruxie was good as well, but mine was clearly the winning waffle sandwich. I noticed a guy next to me was drinking this coffee chocolate concoction which in reality was a root beer float called the black swan. It looked so appealing, I had to go back and get it. Very delicious and dark chocolatey. I loved the food and the vibe was awesome. I will be coming back definitely.

God has fulfilled his promise of his second coming. And he delivered it with the inception of Bruxie. I have been here 4 times now and have been able to sample the majority of the menu without being let down once. Let's get down to the basics: SERVICE- is absolutely extraordinary! Yes, you will wait longer than normal for a fast-food venue. But! They have staff coming to the line to answer any questions, hand out menus, and even give out samples every once in while. Once your order is ready they have someone at the window personally delivering your food/drinks to you. FOOD- as many reviewers have said...the waffle is so crisp and airy, and cooked to perfection so much so that it compliments absolutely EVERYTHING on their menu. For first time Bruxie visits, I suggest ordering their Buttermilk Chicken Waffle. It is divine and all of the flavors meld so well together. The Beef Short Rib sandwich is very good as well but very meaty...get this if you are feeling particularly carnivorous. The Bruxie Burger is good but there are so many other divine sandwiches on the menu so I would personally skip this option. The Wild Mushroom and Arugula sandwich is super yummy. The cheese on it is goat cheese, I believe, which is a little pungent so if you are a cheese fan I would suggest getting this. Plus, the arugula is a great addition to the flavor of this sandwich. My favorite so far is the Smoked Salmon sandwich with cream cheese, dill, and cucumber. Maybe because it is just so light and airy, it is perfect for the summer. As far as sweet Bruxie sandwiches go, I have tried the Smores and the Strawberry Creme Brulee. I never thought I would say this because I am KNOWN for having a sweet tooth, but I actually prefer the savory sandwiches! Maybe because it is just so unbelievable that a waffle would be a scrumptious substitute for bread. Both sweet waffles were good, go for the Smores if you are a choc-o-holic. Did I mention that they have DELICIOUS shakes and homemade sodas! WTH. I can't stop talking. AND all of their ingredients are super fresh. LOVE IT! NO BATHROOM so simply pee elsewhere. KNOW WHAT YOU WANT before you get to the window so you don't slow down the process (and successfully annoy me and other patrons). DON'T GO DURING PEAK LUNCH/DINNER HOURS unless you are prepared to wait (although the line does go faster than you would expect). OH, AND DON'T HOG A TABLE UNTIL AFTER YOU HAVE ORDERED. I swear people who are in the back of the line will snatch up an empty table and wait and wait all while it could have been used for someone closer to the front of the line. Don't worry...you will get a seat if you wait...people generally eat pretty fast here and don't linger, so please be considerate. THAT'S ALL FOLKS!

So after seeing my friends pictures of this place on facebook, my group of friends and I decided to make a trip to this place and give it a try. It took us about 30 minutes to find this place because this place is located at like the downtown of orange? When we finally got there we saw a long line so i thought this place must be good, and i can't wait to try it! I ordered a smoked salmon waffle sandwich and a berry and cream waffle sandwich. the smoked salmon was whatever and i thought the berry and cream one was a little too much berry (jam). So this place didnt live up to it's hype for me. However, I really like their idea of "waffles sandwich". Its a pretty clever concept I must say. However, I don't think its worth it to go back.

Took my first trip here yesterday, and I will definitely be back! 蔍 tried the chicken waffle, and it was great. 蔍 can't say this is a low-calorie meal, but it is worth it! �My friends got the smoked salmon waffle and the special of the day-- mushroom and goat cheese. 蔜hey loved these just as much. I want to try the sweet waffles in the future. 蔜hey all sound good. 蔍t will be hard to choose! The iced tea is also really good here. 蔍t has a very full bodied flavor. �They note it is "hand steeped," which I guess means it has been given more love and attention! �-) ) Check this place out. 蔍 think there is often a much longer wait around lunch time, so go there on the off-hours.

Surprisingly delightful. I didn't know whether or not I'd enjoy it but I really, really liked it. Of course I had to try the buttermilk fried chicken and waffle. It was wonderful. I also tried the burger and the patties were cooked to perfection. The nutella and bananas with sweet cream was really yummy. All in all, I'll be going back to try several different items on the menu.

I tried the smoked salmon waffle and the burger waffle. The smoked salmon waffle barely had any salmon in it, and the cucumber that was sliced was paper thin. The cream cheese was disgusting and gave us stomach aches. The burger waffle was okay, but there wasn't enough veggies in it. Too soggy. Would not go here again

Went here not expecting to eat as I was not really that hungry and not sure what to expect. 蔄fter viewing the menu, well, that changed very quickly. �Wrapping a Belgian waffle around Smoked Salmon & Dill Cream? 蔅uttermilk Fried Chicken & Waffle? Cheesburger? 蔇on't fancy wrapping your waffle around something savory? 蔋ow about around some PB n J? S'Mores? 蔔utella & Bananas? 蔛ounds good to me! 蔍 had to investigate even if I wasn't hungry. �I was in a savory mood so I went for the cheeseburger. 蔄s expected the waffle substitutes the bun in your cheeseburger. 蔛urprisingly the waffle was not heavy but rather added a light texture to the burger. 蔜hey do kind of skimp on the produce with just a few leafs of limp lettuce and a slice of tomato. 蔕verall it was good, but probably would not order it again. 蔠ith that said I def would like to come back and try some other savory and/or sweet selections. 蔄lso need to try out the old fashioned custard they have there....I have yet to try frozen custard and have heard it's to die for.

3 stars...like yelp says A-Ok I came here because I read all the wonderful yelp reviews and needed a little pick me up after the Chargers game...and Bruxie proved to be good, but not great. 蔍 got the recommended fried chicken waffle and the bf got the salmon and dil cream cheese waffle. 蔠e also got the Irish Fries and the Liege Waffle and Diet Cola. 蔋onestly I think the reviews for the chicken waffle gave me to much expectation because it was just alright. 蔜here really were no flavors in either the waffle, chicken or cole slaw, so I had to use all of the sauces (I got the maple too) and even then it was just okay. 蔜he chicken was juicy, but honestly...you can make similar chicken easily at home. 蔔ow the the Salmon and Dil Waffle was AMAZING. 蔜he salmon was fresh and pared well with the cream cheese. I would definately order that again. 蔜he Irish Fries were again LACKING IN FLAVOR...my bf even said, how can bacon have no flavor...I dunno but Bruxie did it. 蔜he diet cola definately tasted different, but nothing to write home about. 蔋e liege waffle was different too...BUT SO DENSE...I felt like I was eating a really hard pancake...I wouldn't be eating that again...Well this place is around the corner from the bf's house, so we'll probably be going again...overall...an ok experience, but WAAAYYYY too much expectation....

Tried it after months of looking at yelp reviews. I had the roasted mushroom feta cheese and my husband had the chicken and waffle. Both were really delicious we ordered the syrup on the side for the chicken and waffle and just dipped as we went along. No complaints even my two year old finished her portion. The mushroom was really savory really rich with the balsamic. The first few bites are heaven although towards the end the richness was starting to get a little much. So sharing the chicken waffle and the mushroom was perfect it offset it just a little bit. But all in all very tasty.

I agreed to meet a friend at Bruxie for a late morning coffee this morning (10:30 am, Friday). 蔍 hadn't planned on getting anything to eat until I read their menu. 蔍 read other reviews on Yelp before I went so I knew that parking would be a problem. 蔜here were no spots on Glassell when I arrived so I drove a block south and parked in one of the public city lots. 蔍 got the Bacon Egg and Cheddar (but with just egg and cheese) and a small cappuccino. 蔍t was just under $10, which I thought was a real deal. 蔜he sandwich was DELICIOUS, the staff was helpful and friendly, and my food came out quick, even though they were pretty busy. 蔍 can't wait to go back!!!

This is an interesting concept that you should try. I have had tried a few of their stranger offerings; cheeseburger, Salmon, Fried Chicken. 蔜hey all are good in their own way, but the Salmon was tops. It is a bit pricey for the amount of food, but the service makes you feel better about what you pay. 蔍 cam here after closing once and started to leave after realizing it, but the workers offered to sell me food anyways: fantastic. As a occasional treat, this place is great.

Better than Roscoe's Chicken and Waffle??? Yes indeed! Trust me I know my waffles and fried chicken. I've been coming here for over a year now. Not too far from Disneyland either and I come here to grab a quick bite if I can't decided where to go eat. Of course for newbies to this place, you have to get the the chicken and waffle. For the dessert part, if you love nutella spread and banana's, then get the nutella and banana waffle! I always tell them to leave out the sweet cream they spread on the waffle for the dessert. I am not a huge fan of it. I don't know why, but its not my cup of tea. The waffle's are always amazing and crispy here. Not soggy like other "waffle house's" Their natural cane sugar soda's are also yummy. I always go for the Cream Soda. And there are always something new every month they sell for a limited amount of time. Oh this is the only frozen custard place I know in So Cal. Let's just say it goes so damn well with the nutella and banana waffle :D. You pay for what you get and expect to pay a few bucks more here but it's always worth it. The lines look long if you come during peak hours but it goes by fast and I think its worth the wait.

I was browsing on Yelp and came across this place. Chicken and waffles, sign me up! Service as good as soon as we got there. There was somebody handing out menus, answering questions, and I think they might have even started taking orders before some people got to the window. I got the chicken and waffle(buttermilk fried chicken, waffle, cole slaw, and chili honey), one of their old fashioned sodas(I think it was a seasonal flavor), and a Nutella and bananas for dessert. The waffles and the slaw were pretty good but the chicken was missing something. It was crispy on the outside, juicy on the inside, but needed some kind of kick to it. Nutella and bananas just go so well together but it was even better with a waffle from Bruxie's

Nice little place if you're a fan of chicken and waffle. Overall, chicken and waffle is not too sweet, not too greasy, great texture. Their dessert waffles are great too! I got the creme brulee one and it's pretty good- light and mildy sweet. If you're craving for some decently good food. I say this is a good place to stop by for casual eating.

There are few things in life as good as fried chicken and belgian waffles. I was going to compare this to roscoes but have to be impartial as this place is way different. I had the Prosciutto ham and Gruy弐e waffle sandwich and my colleague had the chicken and waffle sandwich. It is a walk up window outside that you place your order and the first thing I noticed was the line. ( thats always a good sign in my book. ) The Owner/Chef, Dean was greeting people in the line and asking everyone he spoke with if they had questions or needed a suggestion for lunch. He said that the waffles are unsweetened so make sure to order something sweet for afterward. So we split a vanilla shake to go with the meal. I have to tell you I loved it. 蔜he Prosciutto was a true Parma Ham not that oscar meyer crap. The Gruy弐e complimented perfectly with the buttery waffle. Although I would suggest maybe a buttermilk waffle to add some flavor to it. The waffle was just so-so. My friends Chicken waffle was very good too but again the waffle could have used some flavor. If not sugar then how about buttermilk. 蔍 will be back next time I am in the area for lunch.

This place is Awesome!! When they first opened the lines were ridiculous..not that it's totally not worth waiting in line for. I waited and waited patiently. Today was the day! Tried their braised short rib waffle with blue cheese and waffle fry - served up with a side of gravy au-jus... Killer! Waffle was crispy light and deeelish and the short ribs were tender and flavorful! YUM Factor 5 stars.... I would definitely eat here once a week at least. I really wanted to try their Date Shake which was one of the daily specials...Maybe next time =) This place is a MUST try! � Seating is also limited but there are a few nice little booths with shade. Parking is limited. Try to get there around 11:30-ish for a parking spot and a seat.

Kind of really like this place. 蔆hicken and waffle is pretty good, the more I think about it I like the chili honey sauce more and more. 蔜he waffle by itself is not great, not dense enough for my taste, but paired with the chicken gives it a better dynamic. 蔜he slaw was kind of unnecessary, it didn't add anything to it flavor wise, so just adding it for texture didn't enhance the sandwich. 蔜he s'mores waffle was pretty delicious. 蔍t had a nice punch of flavor to it, again individually the ingredients weren't fantastic but altogether was a lot better. 蔠henever a place has frozen custard you have to order it. 蔍t wasn't the best frozen custard I've ever had but I feel like any frozen custard is a lot better than no frozen custard, so kudos for them putting that on the menu.

After Church, famished as we were after the longer than usual service, we decided to get some breakfast by the circle. We drove by The Filling Station (our usual go-to) then past it to find parking. Boy, were we glad to have gone past. We parked one block north and looked across the street to this small (used to be a burger joint) place with a hipster vibe. Bruxie gourmet waffles. Why not. We ordered the specials, prociutto hash and eggs waffle, green eggs and ham waffle, and coffees. The waiters were delightful and nice! (and prompt!) It seemed like nice people worked here and this accommodated nice customers. There was standing room only, but a couple waved me over as soon as they were done and offered us their seat. Yay. We got our food and... OMG. I turned to my bf and told him that I will definitely be craving this green eggs and ham waffle for weeks to come. I'd only taken a bite! The arugula pesto (green) was so delicious!!! My bf's prosciutto hash waffle was wonderful. The gruyere cheese was melted perfectly and there was a hint of horseradish. I will dream of these waffles as I fall into a food induced nap.

I try not to overhype on yelp so I will just say that it's a nice unique place to check out for yourself. 蔍t's worth it in you live close by and want something either sweet or savory for breakfast, brunch or lunch. 蔄lthough, they open until 10pm on some nights so it would hit the spot later at night as well. �We had the fried chicken and waffle sandwich and the bacon, egg and cheddar sandwich. 蔍t's slightly cheaper to order fries with a sandwich (which they call a combination). 蔜he fried chicken and waffle sandwich as covered in a chili honey and sprinkled with cole slaw. 蔍'd say this is worth trying if you haven't tried it yet. 蔄t almost $10 for the sandwich and fries, it is slightly overpriced for the amount of food they give so that is why this is not a place you should frequent often if you're hoping for a hunger satisfying meal. 蔜he bacon egg and cheddar sandwich was somewhat skimpy but still tasty. 蔄gain, slightly overpriced at $6.50. I'm not a big fan of waffle fries but the ones at Bruxie were good. 蔜hey were crispy which is the way I like my fries. �Again, it is worth trying if you haven't yet. 蔜he waffles are uniquely good and work as a sandwich. 蔄pparently, there's one opening in Brea so maybe check that out if you live in northern OC.

So I play club lacrosse for San Diego State and as we were driving to Chapman University I spotted a food stand with a huge line at 11 am on a Sunday! After a hard game in which we unfortunately lost, we did what many women do after a bad day, we decided to eat our feelings and head out as a team to get some waffle sandwiches. I had the Fried Chicken and Waffle sandwich with waffle fries and a root beer. So freaking yummy. The chicken is a flattened breast in a light batter that had rosemary and paprika in the batter. There was a small amount of coleslaw on it as well. The waffle is so light and crispy it was very tasty. I had a side of maple syrup as well and dipping the chicken in it just took the sandwich to a whole nother level! The girls on my team ordered items from all over the menu and loved them all, especially the bacon, egg and cheese, the milkshakes, and the floats. The only miss was the sun dried tomato with basil arugula and goat cheese. There was just too much cheese on it. The staff was extremely friendly and quick. We even got to chat with the executive chef who was out there bussing tables with the other attendants. If we play Chapman again next year I will have to get more food to go for the ride back to San Diego. Very enjoyable!

love it. very different. something I like to take the out of towners to. parking is pretty bad but its a great area to walk through so park anywhere and walk through old town. my favorite is the salmon or the fried chicken.

No bathrooms since it was built so long ago. I guess they can get away with it, being a historic building and all. pee first, then come.

While on the way to a friend's recital at Chapman University today, I almost ran through a stop sign while staring at this little shack PACKED with people sitting outside and waiting in line in the rain and cold. Then I read the sign: WAFFLE SANDWICHES. Yes please! After the recital, I stopped by to grab something to-go. I ordered the chicken and waffle sandwich and a vanilla creme soda. If you enjoy the chicken-waffle combo (a la, Roscoe's Chicken and Waffles), then you'll like this sandwich. coleslaw, fried boneless chicken and chili honey. The waffle isn't sweet, so it pairs well with the savory flavors as well as the sweet flavors. Soooooo good. Wish I lived closer. I would love to try the PB & J, the sun-dried tomato and goat cheese sandwich and the s'more sandwich. Hmph. It just may be worth a little detour on the way to or from Disneyland. If anything, to satiate my Roscoe's craving for awhile. :-)

The second time I tried the chicken fried waffle and thought that was wonderful too. It was sweet enough without anything more than the honey saucey thing they give you.

Line: decent wait, about 5 minutes . Food: 蔜ried the Prosciutto & Gruyere sandwich. It has a flavor that was tasty and light. I liked it but at the time I was looking for something more meaty. Tried the Bruxie Burger. It was pretty good. Hit the spot. I added a little honey on the burger and it reminded me of Rosco's, meaty and sweet. Dessert: I tried the S'Mores and it was like a s'more but with out the graham cracker crunch. A bit sweet. Tried the PB & J. I asked for boysenberry jelly. It tasted really good. In my opinion it was better than the S'mores. Thought: People working there are really nice, and the wait for the food is about 10 minutes. Overall I recommend trying this place but it is not an everyday thing. It is once every two months thing.

After reading reviews and hearing about this place from my friends, I dragged my boyfriend to Bruxie with me to try it out for ourselves... Now we're hooked. What I've tried: My boyfriend and I have only been here twice, and we ordered 3 items each time. So far, we've had the smoked salmon & dill cream cheese, sun-dried tomatoes & goat cheese, bruxie burger, pb & j, and lemon cream & berries. The smoked salmon & dill cheese is to die for. My mouth is watering right now at the thought of it. We loved it so much, we've decided that we have to get that each time we come back to Bruxie. The sun-dried tomatoes & goat cheese was also really good, but I probably wouldn't get it again. There isn't any meat in it, and I love my meat! The bruxie burger was amaaazing; my boyfriend inhaled that thing. The pb & j was yummy, but I don't think I'd get it again because I'd rather spend $6 on something less simple... for lack of a better word. This brings me to the next waffle, the lemon cream & berries. Now, THIS is more worth the $6 than the pb & j. The lemon cream was light and not too sweet or too sour, just perfect. Also, the "berrieS" is a lie; it was just strawberries. Nonetheless, it was still delicious! Prices: $6 - $8 for the savory waffles; $5 - $6 for the sweet waffles Service: Super friendly service. They even clean the tables for you if it's dirty. Location: It's a tiny, tiny, TINY, shack located in a neighborhood. The parking lot only fits a handful of cars, so most people park along the streets nearby.

I am only writing a review right now because I can't stop thinking about their Creme Brulee Waffle and their Vanilla Creme soda! Bruxie justifies having waffles for dinner. ! Everything about Bruxie I am in love with! Cute location, service is awesome and down to earth. Most importantly the waffles are decadent. �I ordered the creme brulee waffles..looked just like a sandwich with sweet strawberries, cream and burnt sugar! Everything about it was perfect.. My boyfriend had the chicken and waffle ..I wasn't too keen until I took a bite and couldn't believe I finally had a bite of chicken and waffles..and boy was it grub! surprisingly it was super light not as heavy as it sounds. Their vanilla cream soda either poured from a fountain or out of its bottle..but whatever it is it was delicious! I highly recommend this spot rain or shine!! I'll probably go by tomorrow to have my usual..and maybe the next time after that try something different,maybe....

We were in so-cal so I decided to trust my yelpers to help me find a great place to eat...sure enough, I wasn't disappointed at Bruxie's. It's a small place and it's outdoor seating. They sell everything on a waffle (well most everything). We had the buttermilk fried chicken and waffles, pulled pork and waffles, and the hash and waffles. The buttermilk fried chicken and waffles is completely different from Roscoe's. This place serves it with more of a chicken finger inside a waffle with some kind of sweet glaze and coleslaw...YUMMY!!! The hash is not your typical corned beef and potatoes hash, this one is prosciutto and I think corned beef...needless to say it was ....YUMMY. Those two were so good that we decided to wait back in line to try the pulled pork which was also very good. For dessert we split the strawberry creme brulee....sooooo GOOOD!!! I wish we had one closer here in northern california...so if the owner reads this....please expand =) I'm a fan and I'll definitely come back!

I thought Bruxie was REALLY overrated. 蔒y friends took me here because they said that it was really good. I was really hungry so they suggested the Bruxie Burger which is supposedly one of the better things on the menu. 蔅ut I thought the burger was pretty much the same quality as an in n out burger, if not a little worse, and it was about 3 times more expensive. 蔜he whole "waffles for buns" idea really wasn't that great. It just tasted like a sorta crunchy bun. 蔛ay, like a toasted bun/bread. That you can get on burgers/sandwiches at other places. �Furthermore, continuing on with the part about it not filling me up: 蔍 was definitely not full after eating my bruxie burger, and the people I was with got 2 sandwiches each which made their meals very pricey (around 14 dollars each). 蔍 think this restaurant should have 2 dollar sings for the price, not 1, since to get full you might have to eat 2 sandwiches (if you generally eat large meals). ALSO, the bruxie burger (and some other meals I saw there) were disgustingly greasy. 蔍 felt pretty gross after I ate my meal. So essentially what I got out of Bruxie was that it was an overpriced junky meal. It tasted fine, but it just wasn't worth it for the money or the impending coronary blockage.

Some ideas are just so brilliant you ask yourself why you never came up with it first. Thats definitely how I felt when I heard about Bruxie serving up waffle sandwiches. Be aware that this is a food stand and not an actual sit down restaurant. Seats are limited (most are standing up seats) and parking may be difficult. The chef/owner is European and super friendly. He will often greet you in line to chat and hand you a menu himself. I think the fact he's European shows in his cooking. My party tried both the fried chicken & waffle sandwich (by far their best seller) and the proscuitto hash (special). The fried chicken reminded me more of chicken fingers more than traditional southern chicken. It had more spices and wasn't as crunchy. That didn't mean it wasn't finger licking good though. Inside the sandwich was cole slaw that wasn't heavy and was cut into chunks rather than thin slivers. Super delicious also. The proscuitto hash was hearty and chock full of stuff including a nicely fried egg.The waffle wasn't overcooked and didn't have that floppy characteristic that Roscoe's waffles has. For a side we got waffle fries (ha! get it?) which was very fresh and nicely seasoned. It had a great crunch to it that Chik-Fil-A (the only other place I know that serves waffle fries sometimes lack). For 2 sandwiches, 2 drinks, and 2 waffle fries it came out to $23 which is a tad pricey but oh so worth it! I highly recommend this place and only wish they would open a shop in LA too. And next time you can bet I am going to stuff my face with their desserts!

I was encouraged by all the good reviews plus it was on the food network. However, there's very limited parking, outside only seating if you can find it. Most people camp out at the tables. There's always a slow moving line. Food is also brought out slowly. I tried the wild mushroom waffle sandwich. It was soggy with a funky aftertaste. The people who work there are nice enough but the other customers are rude to each other and snobby. People who lack manners and common courtesy. Overall, it was over priced for the quality of food I received. I won't be returning anytime soon.

Since this is the only place like this, that I know of, and it tastes pretty bomb, I have to give it a 5. 蔜he waffles are crispy, light, and fluffy. 蔍've been here several times now and never leave disappointed. 蔍 know there are like 827 reviews of this place at this time, but I have to do one to put on my list now. 蔜he rest of the reviews will tell you about how good all the items on the menu are. 蔛hit, might as well tell you my favs: Fried Chicken (agree with minna t. 蔜he waffle does get soggy after a while, but that just means I'm going to have to learn to eat it faster!), prosciutto and cheese, lemon cream and berries, and all their home made sodas. 蔍 have to confess that my appetite has been insatiable lately and I have to thank Bruxie for being a part of my FAT ASS way of life.

I'm typically a weird eater who doesn't think that certain foods should touch so I was a little hesitant about the idea of a waffle being the "bread" in the meal. 蔄 group of co-workers and I made the trek from Brea to Orange (on our one-hour'ish lunch mind you) just to try Bruxie and I'm happy to report that it didn't dissappoint! In order to get more bang for our buck we split a bunch of items. 蔠e had the Bruxie burger (oh ma gah... delish!), and the prosciutto and gruyere (not normally a prosciutto fan but this was so good). 蔉or dessert we had nutella/banana, lemon creme/berry and their special strawberry creme brulee and all were equally amazing! 蔠e also shared a frozen custard and we dipped their waffle fries into it and again... yum! I'm hoping to take my hubby and kids back this weekend because I think they'll enjoy it too. 蔍 should also mention that the customer service was excellent. 蔅ecause it was our first time we had questions and the staff gave us great suggestions and it appeared that the owners were there too and everyone was super friendly. 蔐ove it!

It's an outdoor waffle stand. Their variety is as limited as their seating. The service is prompt, which adds a star. 蔕verall, I'm not impressed that this place is considered a meal joint. 蔍t's a bit overpriced, but the concept is wonderful- waffle sandwiches, waffle fries, waffle dessert, waffle everything! 蔠affle me this- I felt like I could've opened my waffle maker and created my own sandwich for a significant fraction the price and dinner or pantry leftovers, and more comfortable seating arrangements. 蔔o thank you.

I have been wanting to try this place for a while, and finally got the chance to do so. I must say it is something different and not your regular chicken and waffles. We had the Buttermilk Fried Chicken with extra maple syrup and the waffle fries. My first initial reaction was "WHOA!", a waffle sandwich! I had a bite of it and it was alright. As I got deeper into the sandwich, it was delicious. I actually liked it with the extra maple syrup. The waffle was not too heavy or thick. Seriously, it was crispy but not burnt and it is probably the best waffle I've ever had. The chicken was not dry, cooked to perfection. It had great seasoning, nothing more to it. The one thing was the slaw. Slaw was not very tasty. It had no flavor and it made my waffle soggy. If it was better tasting maybe I wouldn't have minded the waffle being soggy. Definitely could have done without the slaw. The fries were good, reminded me of in and out fries because it still had some skin on it. Its like they cut it there, into waffle shaped. Fries were sprinkled with sea salt and pepper, quite tasty! After the meal was done, my temporal lobes were hurting from all that chewing but it was so worth it. Overall, it was pretty amazing! Five stars because there is nothing like it! I can't wait till my next visit. I already know what I want to try. -Give it a try! Ps. Seating is limited.

I have been wanting to try Bruxie for months! I am a huge fan of all things breakfast foods and sweets. I went with a friend who ordered the short rib waffle sandwich and the banana nutella waffle sandwich. I ordered the green eggs and ham, and the strawberry cheesecake. The dessert waffles were amazing! No complaints! They even let you order them ahead of time, and then you tell them when you want them to come out after you are done with your meal. The green eggs and ham and short rib waffles were good, they were just very heavy and rich. I think I would only go back to Bruxie for a dessert or a snack, not a meal. We also had a banana chocolate milkshake on the house, which was to die for!!

Not that they need another amazing review, but good grief! I'm glad it's a bit of a drive or else I would be there every day. Though this would make me immensely happy, I would also be fat and broke. How those Chapman kids don't swarm the place daily, I don't know. Oh wait, they do! I have not had a bad thing here yet, except that I would not go for the ice cream sundae, but only because the sweet waffles are more special. Probably coming here for my birthday dinner!

Just passed by this place and the concept really caught my attention. There are waffle everything! but I was in the mood for something more traditional, so I went with the standard nutella and strawberry. There was definitely nothing special about the waffle, and the texture was lighter and crisper, where i enjoy a good Belgium waffle. Next time I'd try something crazier.

This place was pretty darn good. Such a simple idea, yet so ingenious . I shared the prosciutto and Gruyere savory waffle. It wasn't as cheesy as I feared it would be, it was just the right amount of cheese and made it a light lunch. Then to finish off the meal, we ordered the off-the-menu item, Strawberry Creme Brulee waffle. It was soooo good, because they caramelized the brulee and combined the texture with the crunch and softness of the creme/fruits made it extra delectable!

Had to wait in a long line because we went on the 4th of July. But let me tell ya, it was worth it. And 蔍 hate lines. Loved the buttermilk chicken waffle with a side of maple syrup. Yummmm!! Better than Roscoe's in my opinion. The wife's sun dried tomato and goat cheese was amazing, too. Also had the creme brulee and strawberry waffle...Heaven! So it lived up to all the positive reviews here on Yelp. Hate to drive far for a restaurant, and we drove from Huntington Beach. But 蕎e're going back even with the drive. So unique and so delicious!

FINALLY went to check it out with hubby, since we were already in the area during lunchtime. It's a nice little joint with outdoor seating. It reminded me of the corn dog stand at Disneyland! We ordered the fried chicken and the figs creme br瀕巈 waffles and a mint chocolate shake. The food came fairly fast. The shake was awesome! They offer a long list of flavors to choose from, and I wish I had the stomach to try them all.. The chicken was nicely fried and the sauce was light but flavorful. The figs creme br瀕巈 waffle was super yummy at first bite, but quickly became too sweet. I had to get a bite of the chicken after a few bites of the figs creme br瀕巈 so I could keep eating it. But it had everything you would find in a real creme br瀕巈: nice crunchy sugar and just sweet creaminess. It would be a good dessert. We were glad that Bruxie didn't disappoint! Although we thought the items are a little expensive. But definitely worth checking out!

So after seeing the stand being built, reading articles in the news paper, multiple rave reviews, high yelp score & not to mention a tremendous amount of lagging on my part I finally made it over to Bruxie. Needless to say it was amazing. 蔍 had the buttermilk fried chicken stuffed inside of a mouth watering waffle. We also has one of the specials the pulled pork waffle that was good as well, the waffle got a little soggy but no big it was delicious and very tender pork. We had a mint chocolate shake but i was in a food coma at that point so I just had a little but it was still ridiculously good. All and all this is a great find and an example of out side of the box street food that the OC needs.

This place is okay. The best part about it is the fried waffle.(at least it taste fried, its very crispy and crunchy and soaks up all the sauce within the sandwich). We tried the buttermilk fried chicken and the pulled pork sandwich. Nothing very special, pretty much average. Maybe the dessert sandwiches will be better, i will try that next time. But their service is very good. We sat down and within 15 min there were five different people asking us if everything was good. Of course we said it was good :)

My girlfriend has never been here, and well yesterday was finally a good day when I can take her. We were actually going to go last sunday, but when we drove by, the line was huge!! Coming here on 蔭 weekday is a big difference! Parking in general is really hard due to the fact its walking distance from the Orange Circle and Chapman University, but coming to Bruxie on a weekday, parking was instant, I LOVED IT! We got there we just had to wait behind one person, heres just a tip dont come here expecting it to be a restaurant, its just a small little spot with..hmmm..probably 10 tables, probably fit 4 to 6 per table. When it was time for us to order, I ended up getting the Buttermilk Fried Chicken and waffle, and my girlfriend got the Bruxie Burger, and we accompanied our meal with their pure sugar cane orange soda. While waiting for our food, I loved the employees there were really nice, two different employees asked us just to make sure what our order was, and one of them apologized and told us that the bruxie burger usually takes longer. And then the food came out! Buttermilk Fried Chicken And Waffle(my dish): This was the second time ive ordered this, and really biting into this dish again, brought me flash backs to when I first ordered it. And it also did give me that feeling as if Ive never had it before. The waffle sandwich is crunchy on the outside, and fluffy on the inside, you can tell its really fresh the moment you grab it, because it kind of beings to tear apart. The chicken was tasty and moist, and the chili honey sauce was a perfect pairing for the chicken and waffle! Just when you think you tasted it all, it sucker punches you with the coleslaw, and seriously it was like..heaven! It instantly put me in that state..you know...when you close your eyes as you chew, and then let out a small "mMmMmMmM......thats good!" Bruxie Burger(Gfs Dish): This dish was new to me, and again a first for my girlfriend here at Bruxie. It had all the components in a regular burger with angus beef. I did love the fact that they offered they can cook the burger to your preference which my girlfriend got medium well, which it was cooked to perfection. I saw my girlfriends face and knew she didn't know what to expect, but after biting into it, her eyes popped wide open and said "oh my goodness that is bomb". So being myself, I offered a trade bite, and man oh man that was delish! I mean seriously big mac who? big carl who? The crunch from the waffle plus the juicy angus beef mixed with the cheese and lettuce, magnificent! The last two bites on a regular hamburger is usually just the bun with maybe a small amount of meat, but with the bruxie burger, it turned into a grilled cheese waffle! I nearly almost cried having that last bite! I have yet to come here to try their sweet stuff, but I am so curious on trying the S'mores, PB&J and also the nutella and bananas! I will always come to bruxie whenever I crave it, but its gotta be on a weekday, because on the weekend is too insane! Feast well fellow yelpers! - Ssp

Ok alll the hype.............is true.... FML this place is good...... ok I had the banana and nutella, chicken and wafflesm bacon and cheese and finally the pancetta hash and it was all delishious... I wish I could have eaten it all but these were all split among friends with leftovers of course, my stomach was sad it couldn't hold more food... and the strawberry lemonade is a great refreshing beverage as well..... I would say the ongoing theme of the food here is sweet, salty and savory.... prices are pretty good you'll probably spend about 8-12 bucks per person here.... like roscoes chicken and waffles you gotta check thisplace out!

One of my other fave places to eat! It's more of a quickie lunch stop place than a restaurant as their seating is just a few tables and some stand up tables outside. It's a cute lil' building on the corner of Glassell and all their sandwiches are made out of waffles. My fave is the fried chicken waffle sandwich...every time I come here I tell myself I'm going to try something different but I always end up ordering the fried chicken waffle. And you gotta get it with the honey. I've tried others that my friends have ordered as well and they're pretty good also. The irish nachos are good too!

Okay, so everybody and their mom's have been talking about this place so I finally got to eat here. It's located next to Chapman U., in a little hot dog stand-sized shack (this place actually used to be a tiny hot dog/burger joint before) with about 4 tables or so and the people waiting in line can probably fill up the 6 designated parking spots. - Bruxie Burger: It is a burger that uses waffles as the bread. I did not know this before coming here, but supposedly all their meals are served in this fashion. Such a simple concept... whoever the hell thought of it is a genius. But it's not just the fact that they stuck a patty and burger components in between waffles that makes it great. Truth is, even if the burger was served in 2 slices of any other decent bread, it'd be an awesome burger. The patty is cooked medium, sizzling hot & juicy. The moist/tenderness of the patty is perfect. The waffles are also perfect on their own as well. Put these two powerhouse entities together and you got yourself a mouthwatering treat, the Bruxie burger. Close your eyes, hear the soft crunch of the waffles. Feel your teeth make their way past the waffle, and let them sink into the soft tender delight of a perfect burger patty. - Waffle fries: I think they were $2.95 on their own, but $2 if you get it with a burger. Of course I tried it. The waffles fries were pretty good. Not as novel/groundbreaking as their burger, but still good. - Vanilla cream coke: They have a selection of "pure sugar" sodas. My friend recommended that I get this, and it was pretty good. It's what it sounds like. My gf got the other recommendation, the orange soda and that was pretty good as well. Service was good, the cashier was glad to give recommendations. As mentioned earlier, it'll be hard finding parking and finding a table. My gangsta gf had to steal a table for us. I hear that the wait is usually 20-40 minutes. Maybe more. And dammit, why couldn't Bruxie have been around starting from 2005, when I was still at Chapman? I guess I can't take a star off for this... Cliff Notes: Bruxie Burger

Bruxie didn't exist 4 years ago when I was a student at Chapman. 蔕h, and neither did Haven Gastropub, the cupcake place or Paris in a Cup. 蔍 definitely missed out on the gentrification of the old town Orange area. 蔠hat existed in place of Bruxie was a burger stand called Dairy Treet. 蔜he food was not that great and the service even worst. 蔅ut I have fond memories of Dairy Treet - we had a professor who was usually in a bad mood during morning lecture, but we would see him walk down to Dairy Treet to buy a soft serve cone and miraculously, he was pleasant all throughout the afternoon lecture. 蔍 would treat myself to a soft-serve whenever I was in a bad mood at school. 蔍 digress. My boyfriend dragged me to Bruxie; I ordered the sun dried tomato & goat cheese, he ordered the chicken & waffle and we split the strawberry creme brulee. 蔍 have to admit, his chicken & waffles were pretty good. 蔊reat seasoning on the chicken and the maple syrup is a dream come true. 蔋owever, I didn't get a really good taste out of the waffles. I had imagined the waffles to be more fragrant, sweeter and with that hard-to-miss batter taste but I really felt that the waffle was lacking. 蔜he same goes for the waffle in my tomato & goat cheese and the waffle for the creme brulee. 蔒aybe it's intentional so that the sweet or savory aspects of the food come out. 蔅eats me. 蔅ut I've definitely had better waffles - I'll even go out on a limb and say I've had better waffles at IHOP. 蔜he sun dried tomato and goat cheese were great - light, refreshing, fresh. 蔜he waffle was meh. 蔜he strawberry & creme brulee were fantastic - but then again, I love all things with sugar in it. 蔜he waffle was meh. We came to Bruxie on a weeknight around 8:00PM and there was a pretty decent line. 蔜he line grew and seating was sparse. 蔔ot sure that I would wait longer than 5-8 minutes in line for Bruxie and not having a place to sit and eat would be a bummer. 蔄lso, I'm not sure how I feel about Bruxie's shout out to the former Dairy Treet establishment in their menu (all of the sweet waffle/dessert items are listed under "Dairy Treets"). 蔠ould I come back to Bruxie?

Probably more of a 3-star place, but I added an extra star for its uniqueness... the Bruxie burger is a must. 蔜he fat from the cheese and meat is offset by the crispy waffle 'buns,' really good stuff. 蔍MHO, much better than the fried chicken sandwich. 蔜he strawberry creme brulee waffle is one of my faves, and I don't have a big sweet tooth - just the right balance of salty n sweet. 蔜he service here is great - it's nice to have the 'floaters' outside who really go above and beyond. 蔄 must-try if you're in this area!

I was in the area last week and I was craving the custard. I get to the window to order a strawberry shake and the girl told me the machine was broken, wahhhhh. Didn't get to have it. I ordered fries and a strawberry lemonade. I ordered a waffle to go for my friend. Next time I'll have to have the shake.

The food is amazing here. Really good brunch place. I'm only giving it 4 stars because parking is horrendous here. Not to mention it's not a restaurant so you sit outside and tables are kinda limited. We had to park a few streets down and walk 10 mins to get to it,. Located right by Chapman University. The area is really nice and it's peaceful to walk around. Got the smoked salmon and that was really tasty. The pink lemonade is also good along with the iced tea. A must try if you're in the area!

waffle sandwiches? what?! saw a series of pictures from fellow yelper ken u. from his visit to this place and i was not only intrigued by the concept but also quite excited to try it out. most times it takes me weeks or months to finally get around trying something new but this time it was a matter of days. i love waffles and i loved all the variety of items bruxie serves them up with. i will say one thing about bruxies though: if you don't have a sweet tooth, you may not relish it as much as someone who does. however, they have plenty of hot sauce in hand to adjust the sweet to salty (or spicy in this case) ratio of their food choices. i think this is the one thing that i see that throws people off. anyway, i went with the popular choice and ordered their buttermilk fried chicken and waffle. amazing taste. it was sweet, it was salty, i put some schiracha on it and it was even more amazing. the waffle was so buttermilky. i loved it. i also had the s'mores waffle. it was quite delicious as well. i wanted to gobble it all up at once. i felt my choices were pedestrian so i cannot wait to try out their more complex choices like prosciutto & gruyere or sun-dried tomatoes & goat. they sound just as amazing. be forewarned. parking is very limited at this place unfortunately. we lucked out and were able to find parking behind the establishment but because it's located right next to chapman university many of the residential streets have parking restrictions. it's obvious they are catering to the college crowd and they're doing quite well in doing so. it would be nice if they could open another location in l.a. county. i think they'd do well. prices aren't the cheapest but neither are the ingredients in their menu choices. service is fast and friendly. this is basically fancy street food but if i am going to have street food, i most definitely choose this anytime. can't wait to come back again.

In Yelp we trust and this place did not disappoint. We ordered the chicken and waffles for the kiddo, which I thought would be fried chicken, roscoes type thing, but I was pleasantly surprised that it wasn't. A thin, breaded,chicken breast with slaw and chili honey sauce was sandwiched in a perfectly crunchy waffle. Sooooo good. I had the smoked salmon, it.was fresh, but it didn't have a chance against the chicken. The BF had the bruxie burger, it was good, cooked medium, but still couldn't get over the chicken . We were ready to fight the kiddo for hers...anyway, I HAD to try the fig creme brulee, which is HEAVENLY. fresh figs with custard sandwiched between yet another waffle. Wished it could've just been regular creme brulee, but the flavors worked together. So I'm a happy camper. The strawberry lemonade could've been colder. Very nice staff. I wished they have one here in Sac.

Holy sweet baby Jesus in a manger! Where have you been all my life! This place is the real mother efin deal! Delicious delicious! I had the fried chicken waffle sandwich and Rick had the new short rib waffle sandwich. Both very good but I recommend the short rib :). It's a small outdoor seating only place, so u might find it hard to find a place to grub but don't get discouraged! 蔐ocated in downtown orange so thats a plus if you want to grab a drink at a nearby bar or sightsee.

I went there for the first time Friday night. The staff was helpful and friendly. I ordered the salmon and dill sandwich. It was delicious! The waffle was not heavy. It was crunchy. The sandwich was not stuffed but thin. I also tried the fries. They were hot and delicious! Simple idea executed beautifully! The one draw back is the price. I wasn't happy to pay $11 for a drink and sandwich. (I'm used to fast food prices.) The meal was anything but fast food quality.

I like my waffles how I like my cookies...warm, slightly crispy on the edges yet fluffy and moist. 蔈ven though I'd heard the hype about this place and was told to set the bar down a notch, I still thought it was pretty good. 蔍 ordered the prosciutto and gruyere, which for me, was the perfect choice. 蔜he waffle was the perfect carb to host this delicious combo of oooey salty goodness. 蔍t was only 10am when I got there and the place was already pretty full, but I'll be back for more.

i love waffles. 蔵 love sandwiches. 蕁aturally, bruxie makes me happy. it's a little pricey, mostly because i feel like i need to eat at least two in order to be full. 蕀aybe i was just really hungry that day...or maybe despite the fact that i am a small asian, i have a big appetite. �prices aren't bad though, just not cheap enough for every day. anyways, i went with a friend and we got the fried chicken and roasted wild mushroom to share. 蕋hey were both delicious, but i was quite partial to the roasted mushroom (with arugula and goat cheese). 蕋he chicken was nice and moist but i just like roscoe's better, although i LOVE bruxie's waffles. 蕋hey definitely got the waffle right. i also got a sugar cane cola--it was sadly disappointing. 蔵 like boylan's sugar cane cola in the bottle better. more flavor. oh wait, almost forgot, but how could i...we also got back in line to get a dessert waffle. 蕇trawberry creme brulee. 蔄MAZING. 蔵 really liked the custard, it wasn't overly sweet. 蕋he burnt sugar added just the right touch. yum yum. overall, i'm satisfied and a little obsessed. 蔰espite the price drawback, i'm determined to try every waffle. 蔴ere i go! nom nom nom.

Waffles just aren't for chicken anymore folks!!! Well, at least not at Bruxie, where the creative menu runs the gamut from savory & sweet creations to classic favorites! We arrived at around 12:00pm Saturday afternoon, and I could already see a pretty substantially sized line forming. 蔍n all honesty, the line was moving at a pretty quick pace, so I was not feeling discouraged from trying out the waffle sammies at this local favorite. While my friend ordered, I took the opportunity to hunt for a vacant table, since seating was very limited here. This type of tag team set up is highly recommended if you plan on finding a table at this busy joint! They typically have specials, as well, and today they were featuring two waffle sandwiches in honor of the SuperBowl teams. 蔍 wasn't entirely impressed with the specials so I went with some of my trusty Yelper recommendations which included: the Bacon, Egg & Cheese Waffle and the Chicken & Waffle sandwich with maple syrup on the side. 蔠e ordered two tasty Peet's coffees and we were good to go. 蔐uckily, I was able to grab a table for two, just as my friend finished ordering. Whew! Moments later, our food and coffees were brought to our table by the friendly and efficient service staff. The waffle looked freshly prepared and all the ingredients looked incredibly delicious! Shortly after I snapped a few obligatory photos, I quickly sunk my teeth into the tasty waffle. 蔄s soon as I heard that beautiful "Crunch," I knew it was going to be good! The texture was perfect. It wasn't too dense, but rather light and airy! The eggs were fried nicely with a soft golden center that didn't run all over the sandwich (and my fingers!) 蔜he bacon was crisp and the cheese was warm and gooey! Yum! To add an additional layer of flavor, I dipped the waffle sammie into the maple syrup, which added just the right amount of sweetness to this delightfully savory sandwich! Next up was the fried chicken waffle sandwich. 蔔ow I'm a huge chicken & waffle fan, so I was a bit leary about this combination. My main concern was that the waffle would get very soggy with the moist chicken inside. After the first bite, I realized I had nothing to worry about! The chicken was crisp and tender with a sweet and mildly spicy finish from the chili honey that was drizzled on top of the crisp golden battered filets. The shredded cabbage added a refreshingly pleasant crunch to the sammie, as well. 蔜he combination was pleasant, but I would have preferred the chili honey on the side. 蔄fter a few subsequent bites, the waffle started getting a little wet from the chili honey. 蔔ext time, I think I'll order the chicken & waffle sammie without the chili honey and dip it in the maple syrup, instead! That maple syrup combined with the savory flavors of the waffle sammie was absolutely delicious! As soon as we finished, our table was immediately snatched up by the next hungry patron. 蔈verything moves at a quick pace here, so be prepared! Overall, I had a very enjoyable first experience at Bruxie. 蔜he waffle sandwiches were delicious and the addictively sweet maple syrup on the side was a MUST! At about 6 bucks a pop, this satisfying meal did not leave my pockets looking thin, either! Add to that a friendly and helpful staff, and you have yourself a winning combination! 蔍MO, stick to the classic recommendations from Yelpers, and you can not go wrong! My one hang-up you ask? The darned Wi-Fi, or lack thereof! If you can get it to work, kudos to you! I was unsuccessful at achieving a connection (after several frustrating attempts) with my iPhone 4 :( Nonetheless, here's hoping your experience is as wonderfully satisfying as mine was! Recommended: Bacon Egg & Cheese Waffle and Chicken n Waffle (no chili honey) with extra Maple Syrup on the Side! Happy Eats!

Bruxie delivers on flavor and quality. The food is great and the service is awesome. I have tried the Bruxie burger and the chicken waffle. Both were really good and something I would recommend to anyone. My wife had the egg, bacon and cheese waffle. I could eat one of those everyday for breakfast. Make sure to save room for dessert. The frozen custard they serve is amazingly good. The mix is source directly from a place in Wisconsin so it is the real deal. If nothing else go to Bruxies for a late treat of frozen custard.

I've heard about this place from a couple of my friends. I saw the reviews and this place has really good reviews. My boyfriend and I went to Orange to try Bruxie. And the reviews were right. We got the buttermilk fried chicken and strawberry creme brulee for dessert based on the cashier's recommendation. The fried chicken waffle was good and the strawberry creme brulee was very rich and delicious. The strawberry lemonade was refreshing as well. We already came here twice within a week. Will be coming here again soon.

Location: It's located in Old Town Orange. You drive down this cute little street that has this quaint old American feel to it with a lot of vintage stores. Its also located really close to Chapman University. You keep driving down Glassell and it becomes a residential area but it's right on the corner. It's a really small place with some outdoor seating. If you come when it's really busy then you might not get seating, but take it to go if you can. Parking's a little bit of a hassle but its a cute place and you wont mind taking a short walk :) Food: The food was really good!! At first I was like, "chicken and waffles?!?!" weeeird...but it's actually really good!! The buttermilk friend chicken wowed my boyfriend because it was soo juicy and it's reasonably priced at about $6. I had the wild mushroom, arugula, sundried tomatoes, and goat cheese waffle. It was delicious!! but only if you like cheese of course ^.^ It's a "seasonal" menu item but apparently it's there quite often. The "waffle" fries are actually just crisscut fries but they're really good!! Their soda isn't from like Coca-cola or Pepsi either. It's soda made from natural cane sugar and its specially made for them. The food is good and you'll definitely be filled. Service: THE SERVICE IS AMAZING!!! this is what made me give it 5 stars instead of 4. Since it's an outdoor area you wait in line outdoors before they take your order at the window. but as you wait, people will come out and talk to you, make conversation, suggest menu items, and introduce their food to you. Everyone is very amicable and friendly; it's amazing! Their service just makes the experience all the better. They're quick about getting you your food and clearing tables (since there are so few in the first place). It's a very friendly and has an all-American feel.

You must have seen that show on the food network called "The Best Thing I Ever Ate." If for whatever reason I went on that show, my meal I ate at Bruxie would be the meal I choose to share with the world. It was a special item off the menu (I recommend asking an employee if the specials aren't posted next to the ordering window) BBQ pulled pork bruxie with cheddar cheese. Juicy to the last bite and absolutely worth standing in line for, twice. I'm kidding but I would have. That's how much I loved this bruxie. Don't skimp on your drink either get the strawberry shake. I'm lactose intolerant. Ouch! Need I say more?

4 Stars omgaah This place is legit.. I had the braised short rib waffle. The meat was sooo tender, it had a hint of horseradish (but not too overpowering) along with carmelized onions, 2 pieces of waffle fries and topped with blue cheese crumbles WOW!! I don't know if they have this everyday but it was the special for TH The fried chicken waffle was okay.. nothing comparable to the short rib though Topped it all off with a sweet waffle dessert of course! I followed all the reviews and ordered the Strawberry Creme Brulee. This item wasn't on the menu but I asked them if they had it, and sure enough they made it! It's just the right amount of sweetness... Oozes out the creme brulee with every bite. Dusted with powdered sugar.. MMmmm Advice: order the small size frozen custard to eat with any sweet waffle choice.. it makes it just THAT MUCH BETTER! I will return shortly!! Can't wait

From the Yelp pics and what I know about chicken n' waffles I figured this place would be dirty and ghetto! I was super wrong. As I approached the street-side eatery I was surprised to see lots of yuppy hungry people in line. For the crowd, it was surprisingly clean all around. I had of course the Chicken N' waffle and the suggested Short Rib waffle. I give both "ok". From the waffle places I've had in Portland I hoped for fluffier more flavorful Belgian waffles. These waffles are flat, "eggo-like" classic waffles. As for the filling, the short rib was too oily, and the chicken could have been crispier. I give it four stars due to the friendly, excellent service.

Bruxie has my heart. This place is so so sooo delicious! I came here wanting to order at least one of each item on the menu (to have a bite of each) after seeing the pictures and reviews on yelp, but I resisted for the time and sake of my company and darling friends. We ended up sharing 3 of the following: Wild Mushroom and Arugala: my favorite! I devoured my half probably in 3 bites, the balsamic vinegerette reduction was fantastic, almost perfect. Mushrooms were fresh and goat cheese was super light, not gross or pungent. Goat cheese usually grosses me out. Carmelized banana creme brulee: very good when warm. The brulee was light and smooth and carmelized bananas are yummy. Reminds me of something they ought to serve around Disneyland. Eating this takes me back to a happy place. Salmon, cucumbers with dill: so light and refreshing. the salmon was really fresh, I am usually pretty picky about where I order fish items but I was pleasantly surprised how nice this one was. I would have scraped off some of the cream cheese if I had to do it over again, but that's just because I was already so full. I can't wait to come back! Totally worth the wait, the line wasn't unbearably long, the people that run this place run it to the T. Very organized, quick, and friendly service.

light, flaky, thin, airy, crips waffles. �this is definitely nothing heavy duty; and is pretty good. i've tried their smoked salmon & dill cream cheese and Smores. both are pretty good. Nothing here is healthy; the light waffles provides the disillusion of healthy eating but we all know what makes these waffles taste so good isn't the lack of butter. they also have custard which is awesome, delicious, sinful and freaken fattening!! personally i enjoyed their sweet waffles rather than the savory waffles. this is definitely a good place to come for dessert; maybe come for a savory waffle if you really love it or just a first timer. definitely something different; something new.

Waffles sandwiches 蕎hat an idea!!! I ordered the Bruxie Burger, waffle fries, orange soda, and the chicken waffle sandwich. 蔐ets start with the waffle. I don't what is in that waffle batter, but it was the lightest, crispiest waffle I ever ate in my life. My taste buds were going wild. Then add in a well cooked burger patty with some mayo , lettuce, and tomato. YUMO!!!! Seriously that waffle orgasmic good! In addition to the wonderful Bruxie burger the waffle fries are great too. Its nothing like Chick fillet's waffle fries. 蔅ruxie's fries the waffle fries in 蕄eanut oil.(fancy) It came out light,crispy, and a whole lot of yum yum! The waffle chicken sandwich was whatever. The piece of chicken I got was over cooked. Maybe the person making that sandwich was tired and didn't give a F*@$, because it was a Friday evening. I will try it again before I make another judgment.

(Reposting my post because I accidentally deleted my review.) I ABSOLUTELY LOVE THIS PLACE! I made a yelp account just to leave a review! :) I tried this place out for my first time a couple of weeks ago w/ family because my friend recommended it and it far exceeded our expectations! Customer service was spectacular (one of the owners are super down to earth!) & the food was beyond amazing. 蔍t's like heaven in your mouth! We all ordered different foods so that we can all get a taste of different menu items to see what we liked best. 蔍 ordered the bruxie burger with fries & a strawberry shake & it was super delicious. 蔜he meat in the burger was fresh & juicy. 蔉ries are fries. 蔛trawberry shake had fresh strawberries in it, which made it extra refreshing. 蔜he waffles are really light & really good. 蔜ried the chicken & waffles and I liked that a lot too. 蔆hicken was golden crisp mmm! Can't forget my favorite item on their sweets section of the menu... the strawberry creme brulee.. WOOOOW. 蔕ne of the BEST DESSERTS EVER! 蔍 highly recommend trying that one. Who knew that waffles would be the perfect combo with all these foods?! It's a small location so there's not a lot of seatings/table arrangement & the line can get pretty long. 蔜hat's the only downside, but the customer service & food honestly make up for it.

I only came here once. The service experience wasn't too good, because they messed up my order: I had ordered the waffle chicken with maple syrup. The cashier charged me for waffle chicken and fries. I mentioned it to him and he returned my money. However, when the order came, I still got fries, but no maple syrup. I was going to mention it again, but my friends started devouring the fries. So in the end, I never got my maple syrup, but the sandwich was fantastic still nonetheless. I also ordered a chocolate shake; it was sweet enough to give me diabetes, but it was delicious.

I've been hearing about this place for a while, and the moment my friend asked if I wanted to try waffle sandwiches, I cut him off and yelled, "YES! LETS TRY BRUXIES!!" I absolutely love the location of this restaurant, right in old towne Orange by Chapman University, there are so many cute little boutiques and restaurants around. Since it was my first time, it was a must for me to order the original Buttermilk Fried Chicken & Waffle. I loved it, the waffle was crispy on the outside and buttery on the inside, the breaded chicken breast was the perfect crispiness and had great flavor. My bf and I also tried the Brown Cow Float - vanilla ice cream with rootbeer in a cup lined with chocolate syrup, I've had this elsewhere before and it's always pretty good! 蔜he service was really helpful and friendly, and I loved that they use compostable utensils/cups/plates. Great environment, great restaurant, great food, what's not to love?

Heard of this place opening in Old Towne Orange and definitely wanted to try it. Drove by late last night, saw a huge crowd outside, and gave into peer pressure and convinced the driver to drop us off first to get in line. Let me say, for being a new opening place, the service was amazing. The chef was outside talking to customers and giving advice on what to order. The other worker also outside was very friendly and gave you our food when it was done. The cashier was also very friendly, suggested additions to your order and was overall very bubbly. (I wonder how long they will keep us this great service). Solely on service, this place would get 5 stars. Here's why it's 4. Chicken and Waffle: Waffle is very good. We ordered take-out and even after waiting 15 minutes to get home and eating it was still good. Very soft waffle, lots of texture and doesn't taste like the frozen kind either. Way better than roscoe's, but the chicken at roscoe's is better. Nothing special about the chicken, could be KFC for all I know. Waffle Fries: I believe they are 2.00 or 2.95, can't remember. Pretty good compared to ordinary McDonalds fries. VERY SMALL PORTION though. easily finish in 5 minutes and leaves you still very hungry. Bruxie Burger: I absolutely love that instead of buns, you get waffles. Bread just gets old. The meat however, is okay. Didn't have much for flavor. Tasted very plain, little seasoning. Comes with cheese (opted out), tomato, lettuce, and I don't remember about onions. This is a great spot to eat before you head out for the night. I can imagine orange high and chapman kids ditching to head here for food on late starts and for breakfast. They say nothing on their menu is over $8, but its still really pricey. $7.95 for JUST 蔮urger with no waffle fries or drink.

THIS PLACE IS AMAZING. I came here for the first time with my friend and I was craving a more savory taste rather than sweet. So we ordered the special for the day, which was green eggs and ham and some other hash brown sort of waffle sandwich. it was so good. The service is also great and they really do advise you with good choices on what to eat. I was impressed. Friendly environment and great fatty greasy goodness.

*Hey, leggo my....* Upon passing by Bruxie's on the way to Felix's Cafe I was instantly intrigued. I, like many others, love waffles. My friend that was in the car with me told me that he had heard of Bruxie and told me that they have sweet and savory waffle combos. I'm a fan of mixing sweet/salty/savory and all that other stuff. So I knew that this place was an inevitable stop in the near future. Upon arrival we already knew we were gonna have to park down the street, because the parking here is VERY minimal. My friends and I came here for our lunch break around 1:30pm. We were anticipating that it might be crowded due to the fact that it's across the street from Chapman University. Luckily for us the line wasn't wrapped around the building. It does that sometimes. The two of them ordered the chicken and waffle combo. Bruxie also has a seasonal menu from which I ordered the braised beef. My sandwich had roasted beef, bleu cheese crumbles, and some horseradish. It came with a sauce that seemed to be made from the reduced juice from the beef. My sandwich was full of flavor, and very tender. I had a bite of my friend's chicken sandwich and was glad I did. The chicken had a crispy crust, and the meat was moist and not overly cooked. They serve coleslaw and a chili honey sauce on the side. The consistency of it was actually more syrup like. My friend added the sauce and the coleslaw to the sandwich. It was a brilliant idea!!!! The very next day half our office wanted to try Bruxie after hearing us talk about it. This time I got the chicken and waffle, so I could enjoy it in all it's chicken n waffle-y goodness. I too added the slaw and chili honey sauce. The cool slaw added a nice crunch to the delicate waffle, and the chicken and chili honey hit it off like a good episode of Blind Date. The flavors are simple and complex at the same time. I truly enjoyed them. The next time I go I'll be sure to try a sweet waffle for dessert. The waffles alone are very delicious. They're soft, but not soggy. They're not hard like the one's you'll find in the frozen section of your local grocer and I mean AFTER you heat them up!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

We came here because we kept seeing our friend check in, and we just had to see what all the fuss was about. =) Good lordy, these people know how to make some waffles! 蔍 know some people have said that theirs was soggy or too crispy, but we must have gone on a good day 'cuz it was perfectly cooked. 蔍 ordered the strawberry creme brulee...hel-lo! 蔣ummy! 蔍t would have been nice to have more strawberries in it, though. 蔍t was a teeny bit on the sparse side. 蔋ubby had the lemon creme and berries, which was good and had LOTS of berries, but mine was better. =p Cousin had smoked salmon and dill cream cheese which I declined to try (not a salmon fan) but he really liked it a lot. Really crowded, but the wait wasn't too bad. 蔕f course, parking sucks rocks, but a little walking never hurt anybody. 蔊reat service. 蔜here was this guy who came to our table before we got our food and wiped it off, who said, "we can't have you eating on this dirty table." 蔉ive minutes later, same guy was moving the umbrellas around so that everyone would get shade 'cuz it was super sunny. 蔔ice! 蔜hen same guy was taking/emptying the trash can out. 蔜urns out, he must have been the owner 'cuz he jumped into a truck with "Bruxie" as the license plate. 蔔ow THAT is someone who cares about his business and isn't afraid to get his hands dirty. 蔍 really, really can appreciate and respect that. 蔆an't wait to go back and try some other stuff!

I heard about Bruxie through word of mouth, and the concept sounded so unique that I had to give it a try! Upon arriving on a Sunday afternoon, the line was long, wrapped around the stand, but we figured that was probably a good sign and decided to wait. While in line, the owner came out and talked to people who were waiting, telling them about how the business started and his personal favorite menu items. I thought that was really cool. I got the Bruxie burger and my boyfriend got the Fried Chicken and Waffle sandwich, and we split them so each of us could try half of the other's. My burger was ok, but if i closed my eyes I'd think I was just eating any ol' burger on a bun. Nothing too spectacular. 蔍 think I liked the chicken sandwich better. The fries were really good too. All in all, the food is definitely tasty but I think it's the concept that really draws people in. There's not many places like it in Orange County. I would recommend it to anyone! The only cons: parking is hard to find, and there is not a lot of seating, especially during busy times. Be prepared to eat standing up, wait a while for a table to open up, or go have a picnic on the grass!

3 stars for A-OK So what was my initial reaction upon arriving to Bruxie? " oh my god it's out door seating and it's raining!" 蔜hankfully they had curtains/drapes that shielded the wind while we were dining there. 蔖arking is limited so you may have to park along the streets. 蔠e met with friends for dinner around 7 pm, and it was pretty crowded. 蔜he order line is outside and you may have to wait a while depending on the time of the day you get there (lets aim for a nice warm breezy day). 蔕nce you're done with your order, hopefully, someone/party is leaving a table as there is limited seating. 蔜here were some extra tables in the parking lot alongside some bushes but we couldn't sit there because it was sprinkling and cold, even though they had heat lamps near the tables I didn't want to sit outside in the wind. The staff is friendly, the food is mediocre. 蔕ur group had the chicken and waffle dish along with the burger waffle dish. 蔜he whole plating looks interesting but to see it for what it really was, it was just lightly battered chicken (moist) wrapped in a plain waffle (no flavor) and the components of a burger enclosed with a plain waffle. 蔜he food is really filling and I do recommend ordering the maple syrup on the side for the chicken waffle sandwich as it lacked flavor. 蔜he burger waffle naturally had more flavor and it was just like a burgor but without the bun. 蔜his place is not to replace Roscoes if anyone of you are thinking this. 蔍 do have to add that while we were in line, the head chef came out to speak to everyone individually and personally recommended the proscuitto and gruyere waffle to my bf but I was too excited about the chicken and burger waffles that I completely forgot to order this dish. �This just means we will have to come back here and give that dish a try. 蔒y friend did mention that their desserts were better (based on her previous experience). 蔄s for the drinks, they do not offer free refills. 蔍 hope whomever reads this review orders something other than the chicken and waffles even though it's the most popular.

So good! The Buxie burger is a little greasy but me and my friend split the Buttermilk Chicken and Waffle & burger so it was all good, it only begins to feel greasy a while in. On my second trip in two days, I tried the smoked salmon, it was really good but I advise you to get the cream cheese on the side to control the portion as with the chicken and waffle just because the chile honey can get things soggy. Chocolate cherry float was good, banana & Nutella crepe was good, lemon meringue was too, it gets a kinda soggy but I think it's because I was already full so it was eaten pretty slowly. Everything's sharable and overall great!

if you expect bruxie's waffles to be like the ones you had in belgium, DO NOT bother to step a foot in here. granted it is pretty hard to impress someone who lives in memories of good times, bruxie's still does not live up to my current standard of waffles, kellogg's eggo, which are not all that hard to surpass. we felt lucky to grab a parking spot right behind the store and to snatch a table moments before our food arrived. the line to order seemed long but it was intermingled with another line of people waiting for their food, so it moved quite fast. hubby got waffle fries to go with buttermilk chicken waffle and i got a liege waffle with chocolate shake. the total came just under $20 which i thought was overpriced given the portions, except the chicken waffle which was equivalent to two mickey d's cheese burgers. the goods first: * buttermilk chicken waffle with chili honey and coleslaw - thin, fried chicken folded in by crispy waffle worked well. the waffle was light and airy, and the sweet honey and citrusy coleslaw balanced slightly under-seasoned, lightly breaded chicken. * waffle fries - easily the best waffle cut fries i had. very crispy and fresh. it was small, but worth $2. the bad: * chocolate shake - there were only 3 different choices, vanilla, chocolate and dates being seasonal menu which i wasn't going to risk eating at a new place. the shake was too little for $5, and not all that impressive compared to counter's. the ugly: * liege waffle - dense, soggy, cold and lifeless...even nutella could not save this awful mess. for something this hard and dense, whipped cream might've been a better accompaniment than nutella. as small as it was, i couldn't even finish it. i'd visit the place again for their savory dishes and waffle fries, but only if i didn't have to look for parking for more than 3 minutes. i like the simple concept behind bruxie, but the food just simply did not blow me away, especially compared to the authentic waffles i had in belgium. maybe i am too harsh?

Great news & Horrible News. The great news is... This place Rocks! The bad... This is the only one. I don't own this place (or work there) but I wish I did! I want to eat there every day for every meal! And they have dessert! The Peets Coffee tastes like starbucks pike. "gross" but some of you like it so... different strokes, I guess. Waffle, bacon (Applewood), egg, Tillamook Cheddar!, Amaaaaazzzziinggg! $6 Belgium Hot Chocolate = The best hot cocoa anywhere! Tastes like Ghirradelli chocolate! $3 but well worth it! The people who don't like this place are expecting WAAAYYY too much. It's a waffle stand! $6 doesn't get you a fillet mignon... But $7.50 gets you Smoked Salmon and it's BOOOMMMMBBB!!!! Doubters, don't let the bad ratings sway you. I've always doubted this kind of food but dang, so good! Anyways, try it! You won't be disappointed!

I was considered going to Bruxie simply due to their unique concept of a waffle sandwich. After reading their menu online, I found that they are not just waffle sandwiches, they are gourmet! I anticipated ordering the Wild Mushroom and Arugula with Goat Cheese, but had the Chicken and Waffle and the Prosciutto Gruyere instead. I will go back and try my original craving another time, as I liked the Bruxie experience. The Chicken and Waffle is very good. The meat is very flavorful and the crunchy coating is well adhered to it. I give this one 5 stars. If you get the same two savory waffles as I did, eat the Proscuitto one first. The flavors are more subtle and complex than the Chicken one, and are easily lost on the palette if you first eat the Chicken one which is smothered in a deliciously strong honey chile sauce. Waffles: light and crispy, better for a sandwich than a really bready breakfast waffle. They get soggy fast, but the sandwich lends itself to being eaten fast so that doesn't really matter. My hubby says they are exactly like Waffle House waffles Service: Excellent! Tons of smiley, happy people who were on the ball...The line was super long, a 15-20 minute wait, but once we paid, our order was up in under 10 minutes. Their menu includes a variety of custard shakes, custards, and coffee drinks which all look very good, too. I'm just not the type of person that typically eats/drinks ice cream or coffee with food. If I lived close to their location, however, I might stop by just for a shake. Definitely a treat.

I don't really enjoy standing up while I'm eating, and this place gets crazy busy sometimes. 蔜he staff make up for it tho by keeping the place very clean and they are very friendly. 蔍 am looking forward to going back.

So much has already been said about Bruxie, I'm not sure there's much to add. It's one star short from perfect because I found myself eating my fried chicken and waffle separately in the end. Don't get me wrong, it was good, but the syrup was a little too sweet for me. You might also need to order two if you come hungry. It's a spot I would return again and again to, especially given the wide variety of interesting combinations on the menu!

I went here on opening day at 11:30 am - KCAL 9 news was doing a story on the grand opening, line was 15 people long, employees were rushing orders, and they weren't sure if the frozen custard machine was operating properly. That being said, I was able to order and get my waffles within 15 minutes. A lot sooner than I expected! Fried Chicken & Waffle - I think I needed more slaw, but flavor was great, waffle was crispy. Wonderful Prosciutto & Gruyere - You can tell it was a lower quality prosciutto they were using, but overall good. Smoked Salmon and Dill Cream - the dill cream made my day. It was very fresh and really lent itself well to the smoked salmon Lemon Cream and Berries - The lemon cream - consistency of lemon curd - was very flavorful and in combination with crispy, light waffle and berries was a hit. Definitely coming back again for more.

I tried their caramel sundae and was a little disappointed. 蔜he caramel was a burnt (and I usually prefer slightly charred/burnt food) and extremely sweet, they skimped on the peanuts (I counted about 4 peanuts - 4!!!!), and the whipped cream was the height of the custard (great if you're into whipped cream, not so great for the rest of us). 蔍n the future, I'll stick with only the custard.

Sure, why not add another review to the crowd. 蔠hat can I say, I loved the thin crispyness of the waffle wrapped around a juicy tender buttermilk fried chicken with a cole slaw like veggies in between. 蔜he other item we ordered was the proscuitto and gruyere cheese savory waffle. 蔞ery good and done well. 蔣ou have to eat it here since I don't think a soggy cold waffle would taste good so don't get it to go. 蔛eating is limited but if you go on a weekday at noon, it wasn't bad at all. 蔠e got a table in a couple of minutes. 蔜he staff is very friendly and helpful and it is so close to Chapman University that they must get many students from there. 蔍t was somewhat expensive but not any more so than most of the gourmet burgers that I have had. 蔜he fries are a must try and I will be back for dessert waffles. 蔊ood Eats!

Good lord this place is good! When my friends said we were going to a place that serves everything on waffles, I must admit I was skeptical. I was picturing Roscoe's type artery clogging cuisine, but I was thoroughly impressed. I've now eaten there around a dozen times and everything I have tried has been excellent. Any of their savory waffles are great (the waffles taste more like really fresh bread than the sweet breakfast waffle you are picturing, and they are thinner than a giant Belgian waffle), but I also had a strawberries and cream waffle and went to a happy place for the rest of the night. I am a milkshake fanatic, and they did not dissapoint. If you are on a diet, I suggest staying away from here, but if you are looking for a tasty treat, this is your place. It's not an indoor restaurant, which is a nice change and is perfect in sunny so-cal.

So good. Thats how I'm starting this review. I was expecting a really good belgium waffle. What I got was something that far surpassed those expectations. Arriving in my lap, within moments of ordering, was an basket of the crispiest waffles I've ever had dusted in cinnamon sugar and a side of syrup. Deep brown and caramelized, the crunchy exterior gave way to a pillowy soft, almost custardy, core. I was on a purest vibe, so I ordered a coffee and a waffle. But I was tempted by a number of items on the menu, and I'm certain I'll be making more regular stops at Bruxie in the near future.

This place is heaven on earth.. They have been open for three months and they already have a ton of reviews! My tax account who is across the way told me that "Bruxie" is a gold mine so I made it a point to come out here with a friend who was in visiting. The owners are brilliant and true savants. Whoever came up with the idea of marrying prosciutto and 蔳ruyere cheese or lemon cream and raspberries deserve an award of awesomeness. I love the remodel that they also did and the heated lamps outside make for it to be less cold. This use to be a little burger joint that has now had a facelift and looks cute. There is no bathrooms which sucks and only outdoor seating. Therefor bring a jacket with you so that you may keep warm.

We went there for lunch today. I was mostly looking forward to the frozen custard. Though it was good, it did not compare to the good stuff in the midwest. I had the peanut butter and jelly. It was good, but I really should have gotten something more adventurous. My husband got the club sandwich (one of the specials that day). After a bite I was dissapointed that I did not get the same. Lines were long and there are few places to sit. It was good, we will be going back, but not anytime soon.

The employees here were all incredibly friendly, cheerful, and excited to talk about their menu... Service was a 5. 蔜he waffle had the consistency and crispiness of a Belgian waffle yet the moistness of a pancake once you took your first bite. The addition of a house slaw was a nice touch to tone down the saltiness of the fried chicken. The chicken itself is much more succulent than your typical chicken sandwich and it is smeared with a sweet house sauce that slightly resembles sweet and sour sauce from McDonalds. Dipped in the maple syrup, the sweetness definitely complimented the whole sandwich. 蔍n conclusion, don't take my word for anything in regards to Bruxie....go and try it for yourself. 蔍 know my son and I will be back for lunch to sample a few more items, both savory and sweet.

Been here a few times and still love this place! My favorites are the chicken and waffle with a side of maple syrup and strawberry creme br瀕巈 waffle. So far every sandwich that I've tried here is yummy tho. The pure cane sugar sodas and wisconsin custard are good too. The staff is friendly and the prices aren't too bad. It's something different and worth trying!

maybe i just didn't order the right thing? we tried the buttermilk fried chicken & 蕎affle sandwich, and the cheeseburger sandwich. 蕂ut of the two i would say i liked the fried chicken one better but even that was just a "ok". 蕋he fried chicken was done at the right texture and tender, but it didn't have much flavor. 蕋he cheeseburger was a little plain too. the waffle fries were great, and the waffles are great. 蕇omehow when they're made into a sandwich it was just alrite. 蕀y own conclusion? it's the fact that they don't put any sauce on it that made it plain. 蔭nd the reason for lack of sauce? i say it's because it would make the waffle soggy... i also didn't quite like the limited seats. 蕐ou already have to stand in line to order, and you have to stand and wait for your food, then stand some more to eat? totally not enjoyable. �however, the menu looks creative, the ingredients are fresh, and somehow i think the dessert ones are probably better so i will probably go back to try dessert.

As you can see there are hundreds of positive reviews for this restaurant and how amazing their unique food fare is. Good food is only half of the experience. I'm sure you've been to restaurants where you had an amazing experience with just the server for example. At Bruxie's it was apparent that the whole crew was truly enthusiastic about making sure the customer was completely satisfied in every aspect of the visit. I've never felt so welcomed at an eatery before.

YUMMY! i love their salmon and cream cheese one, just gotta ask for light on the cream cheese, they put way too much on it. Their burger is really good as well. My boyfriend love the sun dried tomato one with goat cheese. Their berries and cream and nutella with bananas are really good for dessert. The liege with nutella is REALLY sweet. I wouldnt suggest it.

Came here for the first time today accompanied by my girlfriend. She ordered the buttermilk chicken and waffles at $6.95. It comes with chili honey and Cole slaw. I ordered the Bruxie burger with all the toppings at $6.95. We both each shared half each. Great portion. The buttermilk chicken and waffles was so good and moist. The hint of the chili honey gave it a good kick. Then we tried the burger, in my best opinion, the waffle substituting for a hamburger bun was a brilliant idea, it was so good! The sweet honey from the waffles goes well together. It was crispy and butter-milking! I will definitely come back and try the other savory waffles sandwiches they have there.

Some friends and I stopped here after Dland one day and we pretty much ordered a little bit of everything on the menu. I think we had the chicken waffle, the vegetarian one, two dessert waffles and fries. The food was so good, we shared everything I think my favorite was the fried chicken waffle. It can be a bit pricey... but definitely something you can't get just anywhere. I say try something and share with friends so that you can get a chance to try a bit of everything. The staff was really nice there, and it seems like a really chill place. Why don't they have something like this is hipster LA... LoL

Ohhh Bruxie, you had my heart way before so many people started coming here. I've been to both locations, but I mostly come to the Orange one. The waffles... I really love trying the specials because there's usually always something new. Some of my favorite savory waffles: Bacon, Egg, and Cheddar, Proscuitto and Gruyere, and Albacore Tuna Salad. I also reallyyy love their sweet waffles. Sometimes, when I just want something for dessert, I come to bruxie just for a sweet waffle. My favorite waffle is the strawberry creme brulee. YUMMM. The nutella and banana or strawberry cheesecake is also good too. But if you come here, and you really love fries, I suggest getting the IRISH NACHOS. When I first saw this on their special menu, I thought "... nachos... as in chips?", but it was definitely not chips. Irish nachos are waffle fries with sour cream, bacon and this special cheese sauce. What really make it good and unique is the cheese sauce. Just writing this review makes me want to eat them right now! If you love bacon, and you love fries, you definitely need to try them. Not only is the food good here, so is the service. Their staff is super friendly and always welcoming. If it's your first time to Bruxie, they are always willing to give you some suggestions. There are different times where I've gotten a free sample of their frozen custard and their owner/chef even personally made me a free waffle once! Bruxie, in my opinion, is truly amazing.

Honestly, I cant say anything bad about this unique safe haven. I'm always down for any delicious concauction & thats why Bruxie caught my eye. Waffles only for breakfast? No no no my friends, after eating a few of these Bold Folds I will be coming here for breakfast, lunch and dinner for the next couple decades to come. Anything on the menu should be worthy of satisfying your taste buds, just do it

It's a fun concept, but I think it's pricey for what you get. Don't expect to get full from a sandwich. It's more of a snack if you ask me. Unless you get the chicken waffle. I had the prosciutto waffle and the PB&J - both were tasty, and were nice treats. It's a fun place overall-but not the best.

Braised short rib: Meat was so tender and delicious, perfect combo with the blue cheese. Seasonal item but my favorite. Smores: This was better than I ever imagined. This is a must have for dessert. Went with my wife and we split both of them, made a perfect meal with some fries and a drink. Their Orange Soda is really good.

Tried it for the first time and loved it. I had the Buttermilk Chicken Waffle and took a couple bites of the Savory Waffle Burger. There's something about the taste that makes it amazing. It might be the touch of maple syrup they put in the Buttermilk Chicken waffle, and the juicy meat of the savory burger, but its awesome. I highly recommend this place to anyone. You can bet your last dollar that I will be coming back again to try out the other choices, and to get the Buttermilk Chicken again.

oooo I wanted to try this place for a whillle so glad I came! *** note that it is a historical building and there aren't any bathrooms*** that kind of weirded me out sanitation wise.... whatever I mean they have hand sani and stuff. We got: strawberry creme brulee--hubby was obsessed but I thought okayyy. Fried Chicken-pretty good but I expected better. Pulled pork- Surprised people didn't like this more I thought it was so great! Sundried tomato and goat cheese--- REALLY good surprisingly good my husband ordered this and I ended up eating it. Caramel something milkshake---OMG literally the BEST milkshake I have ever, ever EVER had. Super rich. So much flavor. So decadent. Yum! Def a desserty thing. Made eating my dinner difficult.

When I saw the line at Bruxie I immediately said (in robotic voice), "Must eat there." 蔣ou know when you see the crowds and check a high rating on yelp you can't help but get excited to try a place out? 蔜hat was the feeling I had here. �But it fizzled after I tried their original chicken waffle sandwich. 蔜here is a very small window of time where you can enjoy a crispy waffle cause after, it's just kinda goopy. 蔖lus, there is a seasoning on the chicken that I don't care for. 蔎ust wasn't tasty as I wanted it to be. 蔍 had to douse it with honey to mask the flavoring on the chicken. 蔒y boyfriend had the burger which was better and sister had green eggs one which I probably would get next time.

not that this place NEEDS more reviews but i'll still contribute :p this came highly recommended by rave reviews from my friend. she was practically salivating at the mouth when she told us about it. it's more of 蔭 to-go place rather than sit down (there are only a few tables outside), but the line moves quickly and prices are reasonable. the idea is novel and works well. the items are neatly packaged so stuff doesn't fall out and drip too much. i need to go back and try more things... we had the burger (the bite of the chicken one was amazing too), irish fries (seasonal) and strawberry cheesecake waffles. yumyumyum.

I love Bruxie! I went there all the time between my classes when I was at Chapman Savory: Buttermilk Fried Chicken & Waffle - The most popular item and in my opinion, the most delicious item on their menu. The chicken is perfectly crispy, a touch of honey and coleslaw makes the sandwich just that much more tastier. Try it! Bruxie Burger - So, so. I wouldn't order it again, it tastes like a regular burger. Bacon, Egg & Cheddar - I think it's a good go-to breakfast! The sandwich really fills you up.. Smoked Salmon & Dill Cream Cheese - So, so I feel like I can make it myself Roasted Mushroom & Goat Cheese - I actually didn't like it that much...I think it was the goat cheese. Prosciutto & Gruyere - So, so Cheesy Bruxie - This is a good go-to snack! Very cheesy Sweet: Nutella & Bananas - Nothing out of the ordinary, but it's still delicious. Seasonal Creme Brulee - This is little too sweet. Cons: Limited seating area/parking, long lines (24/7) and the food items are a bit overpriced

Sadly I have to give Bruxie a bad review. I was here today when it was busy at lunchtime. We didn't get our fries and the runner giving out food told me flat out that she didn't believe we had ordered 2 portions of fries. I read it out to her and there was no apology. I understand that you're busy but politeness costs you very little time. I don't actually need to pay to get insulted. Bruxie is off the list for a while

let me just start this with, I LOVE WAFFLES! so there should be no surprise i dig bruxie's angle on my beloved belgiums. bruxie is a specialty waffle sandwich shop in old town orange near chapman university, so the place is always busy. the line moves fairly quickly. be prepared to park and walk since there is a teeny tiny lot for bruxie and street parking is tough by the university. my patience in line was handsomely rewarded with freshly squeezed lemonade and the prosciutto and gruyere sandwich. the lemonade was very refreshing! i'll definitely be coming back here and trying other items on the menu. they all look so fantastic! much rather eat here than at roscoe's. my advise is to skip the fries. they are waffle cut, but fairly average for fries. save the calories and just get another sandwich. :) thank you again, to my foodie friend for this find! my foodie friend, vy t along with another co-worker went here again today. it took us about 15 minutes to get through the line this time, but we easily found a table and enjoyed the beautiful socal weather. i ordered the albacore tuna melt. vy had the strawberry cheesecake and my other dining companion had the green eggs and ham. the tuna was tasted very fresh--not from a can--and flavored well with chives. not too goopy with mayo, which is perfect. 蔭ll of us were quite satisfied with our choices. strawberry lemonade was the perfect accompaniment to my tuna melt bruxie. fresh lemonade and a tasty waffle always put a smile on my face!

Really? 蔍'm surprised that this place has such high ratings. 蔋ate to rain on the parade but it just wasn't all that it's hyped up to be. 蔠e ordered the Fried Chicken Waffle sandwich, a breakfast waffle with eggs, bacon and cheese, a nutella & banana waffle, a coffee and a vanilla soda. 蔜he total was close to $30. The nutella & banana waffle was the best thing out of the 3 that we ordered and the vanilla soda was pretty good. 蔈verything else that we ordered was mediocre at best. 蔍t's a cool concept and I like the fact that they are trying something different but if you took the waffle away and put those sandwiches on bread, this place would down right suck. 蔜he outer waffle (being thin and pretty much flavorless) just isn't good enough to make up for all of the contents' short comings. Oh, And "Would you like maple syrup with your waffle?" 蔍 say, "Uh Okay." "It will be an additional 50 cents." 蔍 thought that was weird but I said okay. 蔍 got about a tablespoon of maple syrup in a little cup on the side. 蔛ay What? 蔍t's a friggin waffle place, shouldn't maple syrup be a staple? 蔍t should be like ketchup. 蔆'mon people.

I gave Bruxie a second chance. 蔍 got the chicken and waffle. 蔍 didn't like it at all was worse than the first one I got. 蔜here was no taste that I could taste. 蔍 never tasted the chili honey sauce, I almost think they didn't put any on. 蔄nyway I wanted to give 2.5 stars cause the fries and sodas are good. 蔍 rounded up because the servers are so friendly. 蔄ll in all I won't be back. ���Also I want to say the service is very nice but the people who eat here are not. 蔍 watched a mom with 3 small children not tall enough to stand at the stand up tables waiting for a sit down table. 蔜hey are quietly waiting a little to the side for a family to stand up. 蔄s the people are getting up some young woman in her 20's, with her lumpy ass shoved in one of those gray jumpers two sizes too small for her, shoved her way past them and put her drink on the table. 蔜hat way her and her boyfriend could sit alone at a table for four while the kids sit on the floor. 蔍 have seen similar things happen there a few times.

This was on my food bucket list & I was so happy to finally try it. It's in Old Town Orange (such a quaint little town that I'd love to walk around someday). Luckily, the line wasn't too long outside and it moved quickly. There are plenty of tables outside and there were no seats for a few of them so we had to stand. I ordered their Buttermilk Fried Chicken and Waffle Sandwich because it was the most popular. Pretty unique taste with the cole slaw and chili honey sauce. I can understand why many Asians frequent this place. My friend ordered their sun dried tomato, basil and goat cheese sandwich which was equally delicious. I can't wait to go back! :)

Are buns giving you the satisfaction you want out of a burger? If your answer is no, then look no further. Bruxie offers sandwiches and sweets on a delicious waffle. The waffle surprisingly complements every sandwich they have on their menu. And oh boy, if you want a wonderful dessert, try the S'mores, absolutely delicious. The parking can be horrendous during lunch times and dinner on weekdays, because it is right next to Chapman and downtown Orange. There are a few tables and seats outside so you might have to wait to find an area to eat at. Overall it is a wonderful establishment and provides an innovative idea to typical sandwiches while providing quality ingredients and a great atmosphere.

Oh god, just bringing the memories of my burger to mind in order to write this review creates waterfalls of saliva in my mouth and a painful pining in my gut. All I can say is these people know their stuff. I don't know how they came up with the idea of putting delicious things in a waffle, but I applaud their genius. I had the aforementioned Bruxie Burger...a burger patty with cheese, lettuce, pickles, and tomatoes served in a waffle folded like a pita sandwich. Top off the experience with some waffle fries... mmm mmm. They have frozen custard and sweet waffles and coffee AND they're located in the Orange Circle, my favorite neighborhood in Orange County.

why wasn't the waffle thin and crispy? It was rather soggy and bready, that's actually called a bun in a shape of a waffle. Also, why did my fried chicken taste sour with buttermilk, yet under seasoned with salt and spices? Why was my chicken so artificial, meaty, and boneless? Questions I'll ask for eternity...

Bruxie, you are so incredibly good to me. I adore you, and your waffle goodness! This review is going to be short, sweet, & to the point: This place is realllll good. My usual selection is the smoked salmon bruxie with cream cheese and cucumbers. If someone were to tell me that combining waffles with salmon is a good idea, I would've told them they're crazy. Truth is, the idea is crazy; sheer insanity, but good gracious, it works. It's a simple delight, and for the salmon connoisseurs of the world, I highly recommend trying it. That said, go there. Go now. You won't regret it.

Interesting, unique and delicious! Waffles are perfectly made - soft and buttery on the inside and nice and crispy on the outside. Fulfilling and very satisfying. It may be hard to choose from the menu, but whatever you may pick will not be a disappointment. Can be a bit pricey, but well worth the money. The only downside I can think of is that there isn't a lot of seats and tables and it's usually packed. Another plus side is the extremely fast service and to top it off, all the employees are really genuinely friendly and nice :) I will definitely be coming back for more!

LOOOOVED the banana nutella waffle sandwich. 蔒y husband ordered us the breakfast egg waffle and 蔵t was pretty good. 蔍 read the fried chicken waffle is good but I am affraid to order it and be dispointed, it just sounds too heavy. 蔍 will go to Rosco's chicken and waffle for that. 蕎ould love to come back to try other waffle sweets.

Damn good waffles and everyone is sober! 蔍 think some things on the menu are slightly overpriced for a non sit down restaurant with barely enough and no indoor seating. The customer/owner/workers relationship is great and putting some more cheaper options, specials, or perhaps student discount would benefit the place!

This place is awesome. I was initially skeptical of the "savory" waffles, but the waffle pastrami sandwich settled any doubts. Extremely flavorful, great quality, very impressed. The waffle fries were also awesome. I suppose I went at off-peak hours (~3pm) because I received my food in under 10 minutes. I'm stoked to try the sweet flavors next. My only gripe is the lack of a bathroom anywhere near the establishment. I suppose the the Purell is a good gesture twoards hygeine.

Arrived around 11 and waited in line for about 3 mins. I ordered the Prosciutto & Gruyere sandwich, but was definitely tempted to order other things off the menu but I controlled myself. My sandwich was delivered to my table and I took a bite of it right away. It was DELICIOUS! I was pretty skeptical when my friend suggested this place, but I am glad she did because it is definitely a hidden gem in old town orange. This area kind of reminds me of the set of ghost whisperer, but any who this place is a must try ! I am already thinking about what to get next time... hmmmm

Been to this place a couple of times already, I honestly love it. I love the chicken and waffles of course. I've tried the salmon, pastrami, and a few others. All of them have an original taste, and every bite is just amazing. Although sometimes I'll get the sandwich already broken so it gets all messy :c. The service is great, when there is a long line the workers will carry cups of water for the people waiting in line. Saturday and Sunday mornings are usually crowded.

Went with my brother to this place recently. i had never heard of it until my brother told me that that was where we were going. The place was located on this cute "downtown" looking street except there were houses around bruxie itself but none the less it looked very inviting! I loved the way everything was set up, with the seats and the counter area to the side! not to mention the service was great! i would like to give a compliment to the guys who brought me my food..but sadly i didn't catch his name but anyways...thanks mister! now the food... so my brother ordered the chicken and waffle which he read from yelp was the top item to order, as for myself i got the green eggs and ham because i was in the dr.suess mood...i just wanted to try something that had a weird/playful name. and with that we ordered two orders of hot chocolate! yumMmm [not gunna lie...i was being a little food greedy...i was positive one item was NOT going to fill my tummy but i decided to just order one for now and order another later if i was still hungry, luckily it was not necessary] loved the presentation of the food and the fast service! 1. chicken and waffle: my brother got his first and omgosh! shoooo goooooooddddddd!!!mannn..why didn't i order this!! DEFINITELY different from the usual chicken and waffle everyone talks about, like roscoe's [SO GOOOD], the sweetness of the chicken slathered with chili honey..gahh...mouth watering..and of course the cole slaw added a nice touch [this is good coming from someone who isn't a big fan of coleslaw] definitely something to try/order for myself next time 2. green eggs and ham: thank you mister server for bringing it!! gahhh i love the name!!! and ways my item came and it looked mighty delicious!!the kid in me was actually expecting my eggs and ham to be dyed green like we had it in elementary school but alas it was not like that. but that's ok! i can do that at home. anyways i have to say, this one was an a-ok one, but i think thats because i took a bit of the chicken wand waffle one before but none the less the taste was good and lets not forget about the waffles...soft and delicious!!loved it!! 3. hot chocolate: i don't think you can go wrong with a cup of belgian hot chocolate on a cold day... overall i had a great experience at bruxie and i will definitely be visiting again!this time imma get my own chicken and waffle. now off to desert at donut man!

YUM! 蔍've been there a few times and have tried the wild musharoom and arugala sandwich and also the bacon, egg and cheese. 蔅oth were delicious! The fries are amazing too! Only lost one start because for some reason or another the waffles were soooo greasy. 蔍 don't know if I was going in expecting them to be more like waffles that I would eat for breakfast or what. 蔅ut my hands were pretty disgusting by the end of my meal.

Bruxie is a cute little gem in Orange, CA. Probably seats 20 inside and it has a few standing tables and 2 benches outside. It's great to take for a picnic or to eat on the go. I've tried the green eggs and ham and the fried chicken waffle. I really like the idea of eating pesto with eggs and waffles. The chicken was amazingly tender and juicy too. In terms of dessert, the pb&j taste just like a regular pb&j. It wasnt that special. However, their Creme Brulee waffle is delicious. I could eat it up anyday.

I would definitely come back here! My boyfriend and I decided to try it after I read an article in a magazine about it. 蔐uckily we beat the Friday night dinner rush by getting there at quarter to 6:00. 蔠e even found an okay parking spot AND a table off to the side near a heat lamp! 蔍 have to say first off that the service is really good. 蔜hey make sure you have everything you need and are really friendly. We got: 蕋he Bruxie burger, the buttermilk chicken waffle, s'more waffle, frozen custard. I loved the buttermilk chicken waffle. 蔍 ordered the cole slaw on the side because I don't like it but my boyfriend does, and my only complaint is that they charged me 50 cents extra to have it on the side in a little tiny cup. 蔙eally??? Because I thought I was doing you a favor by not having to stuff it inside the sandwich... Anyway, the honey or whatever sweet stuff is in that sandwich goes very nicely with the chicken, which is really juicy. 蔄t first I was worried that the waffles would scrape the roof of my mouth kind of like Cap'n Crunch, but they didn't. 蔍t was perfect. 蔍 devoured it quicker than I'd like to admit. �My boyfriend got the Bruxie burger which was also delicious. 蔍t was basically a really good burger inside of a waffle which was different and fun. �The s'more waffle was really good. 蔜he only weird thing was the marshmallow (which I believe was a marshmallow spread) tasted burnt. 蔍t tasted a little funny. That didn't stop me though from scarfing down the whole thing and then getting a bellyache on the car ride home! �The large frozen custard was more than enough for 2 people. 蔍 had never tasted frozen custard before. 蔍t was like a heavenly dream....it was almost like sour milk but in a good way. 蔍t was so thick and wonderful and not too sweet. It went nicely with the chocolatey s'more. 蔍 kept alternating bites. Overall, we both really liked this place but we didn't think it was outrageously amazing or gourmet. 蔣ou get what you pay for here...nothing over-the-top creative, but still really really good food and a nice change of pace.

I love bruxies. After coming here 蕋hree times in two weeks, I'm still hooked on to this place. I don't eat beef or pork so i got the chicken waffle meal, it comes with their waffle fries, and both very delicious! The first time I went there my sister and I shared the chicken waffle meal as the main dish and also shared the nutella and banana waffle for dessert. Seriously made our night. Everyything was tasty and it hot the spot. I gave it 4 stars, wishing I could give it 4 1/2 stars bcos of their parking and seating, it's very limited. Other than that, everyone is friendly and sometimes you get to see some of the owners and their sigfig (significant other), very cute.

4 for interesting concept. 3 for actual taste. I had the chicken waffle one and vanilla shake. It was pleasurable enough but not worth the long lines and impossible parking that this place is apparently infamous for. I didn't experience any of that since I was there at 10 AM on a Thursday. Also points for having Shiracha as a condiment.

Surprisingly VERY GOOD! :) Passed by this place a couple times, and also heard good reviews from friends, and always wanted to give it a try! You will NOT be disappointed with anything you order on the menu. Its located very close to Chapman College. Parking is mostly street, although they have a very small lot with limited parking spaces. Its an open order place, with open seating benches (which can be limited, if busy). Very happy with Bacon, Egg & Cheese Waffle (savory), although tried a little of the sweet waffles (Nutella & Bananas), and it was exceptional as well. Looking forward to future visits to try more options on the menu to indulge in.

Had my first chicken and waffle here and i can say without any regrets that i dont need to ever try roscoe's! i had just died and gone to chicken and waffle heaven!..bruxie now has a special place in my heart. Parking was not too bad...theres always street parking in downtown orange and its just like two blocks away. 蔜he line gets quite long with very limited seatings so make sure you have someone in your party to wait for a table while you wait to order. my bf and i shared the fried butter chicken waffle and seasonal strawberry creme brulee waffle. They were both very tasty..the waffle was crispy and the boneless fried chicken was not dry at all. And as a girl who loves dessert, 蕋he strawberry creme brulee waffle was definitely a firework in my mouth! I cant wait to be back!

I could've sworn I reviewed Bruxies...but anyone here I go. I first came after my gf begged me to come time n time again. Sandwiches made with...waffles o_O well we first split a Bruxie burger (hold the mayo :P) n a creme brulee waffle. The burger was awesome...something different. It had the features of a burger in a waffle though :O the meat was good n juicy n every condiment was fresh...the creme brulee was the perfect sweet treat after that burger, the vanilla flavor n strawberries mixed very wel :D. My second visit I decided to try the Mushroom n Goat cheese...it was good, my first time trying goat cheese, had a strong cheese to it but the mushrooms and arugula mixed very well with it. I used some of my gf's syrup n surprisingly it added more flavor. After eating that sandwich I had to try their frozen custard. Very egg-y taste to it in a good way though. It went well in a day that reached up to 103. Overall believe in the hype n try it out for yourself!!!

Yes I'm updating already. We went back again for a second try and ordered the same items again but opted for the WITH maple syrup option for both waffle sandwiches. With syrup option means they give you a small container of maple syrup with your order. I was a tad skeptical at first because the syrup was so thin...but after pouring it on my egg, cheese, and bacon waffle sandwich...ULTIMATE DELISH!!! The syrup is the perfect level of maple, sweetness, and thickness for the waffle sandwiches....it's a flavor enhancer...not overpowering at all. We also tried their French fries this time and honestly they were some of the best I've ever had. Seriously. The fries are essentially cris-cut potato slices thick and crispy with skin left on, seasoned perfectly with salt and pepper (no ketchup necessary). I have a feeling Bruxie is going to become a regular stop for us : )

I'd been once before and was wanting to come back. Just happened to be in the area and was with a friend and hungry so had the chance once again. Had the tried and true fried chicken on a waffle. So good. Wanted to try something else but this hit the spot before so stuck with a good thing. My friend had the mushroom and goat cheese and loved it. Can't wait to go again and want to try the pastrami. Just go. You'll love it. And the all natural sodas are great too.

As I do with nearly all new establishments in my identity crisis-riddled neighborhood, I caught on to the air of excitement for an entirely independent and seemingly original eatery, coupled with a fondness for the concept. 蔍 spent a few significant days of my life in Belgium, and the name (Bruxelles, Bruxie, etc) along with the foundation of dealings here being a waffle, stoked memories of quite a happy episode of time for me. 蔅esides, great meals, even the simple ones, have a tendency to jar something within us. 蔍 was hoping for Bruxie to move me in that direction. 蔄fter three separate engagements with Bruxie, I can safely say I'd prefer not to return, and not to give them my money. �I can understand the sentiment that rating an establishment should be primarily about the food and somewhat about the service. 蔋owever, I am more of the mind that whatever the things are that catch your eye and affect your experience should be the same notions that move you to review. �One evening while out for a walk with my wife, our son and the dog, we stumbled upon a training course going on at Bruxie. 蔠alking by slowly and observing the proceedings from the sidewalk, we were approached by an enthusiastic young man asking if we'd like a sample. 蔠e accepted this gracious gesture and realized that there was a serious employee training happening, led by a nice gentleman who extended his thanks for our interested along with a salmon and dill waffle sandwich. 蔘uite nice. �We strolled home and I recall telling my wife we needed to go back to try it again. 蔜he salmon had the perfect level of smokey flavor and the waffle was crisp, not remotely soggy and while a bit bland, definitely gave the sandwich an original and welcoming texture. 蔍 was intrigued to try more, both by the generally friendly nature of the guy who was conducting the training and gave us the free meal (it was much more than a simple sample) and the reasonably good taste. �Peet's Coffee on the menu (albeit, $2.95 for a large) doesn't hurt either. Since then I've been back twice. 蔜he second visit was not at all noteworthy. 蔜he waffle fries were more than acceptable, but far from spectacular. 蔍 shared the "grilled cheese" version of their sandwiches with my 19 month old son. 蔍 am sure he enjoyed it more than I did. 蔍 found it cold and rather boring with the cheese being devoid of taste. 蔍 have a panini press that does the same job, better. 蔒y wife had the burger and thought It was good, but again, unremarkable. 蔜he wait (10 minutes to order, 15-20 for product) for food that was only ok was, in my mind, not really acceptable. �Today, after the rain broke, we decided to celebrate clear skies, cool weather and sunshine with another stab at Bruxie. 蔜his trip was more or less the nail in the coffin for me. 蔄fter a couple of experiences with them of my own, reviews I've read, and the times I've been by and seen their line, I knew we were assured an excessive wait. �Surely, it took 20 minutes for them to make waffle fries (granted, they were hot when we received them) and a goat cheese/sun-dried tomato waffle. 蔋owever it was what I witnessed during that 20 minutes that has me fairly unlikely to return. 蔜he general petulance and arrogance of some gentleman that I can only assume was the owner as he berated his staff openly, rolled his eyes at them, and just generally acted a bit like a clown while we waited for our food to be finished. �are we constantly brewing coffee? NO? WHY NOT?!?!" If you want to pretend your Gordon Ramsey, then open a real restaurant and hire a staff capable of handling it, you may then feel free to proceed to blast your sous chef at any and all opportunities. 蔍f you want to renovate a hamburger stand and hire a bunch of kids from Chapman University and Orange High School that are probably stressed out for finals, wondering who is getting kicked off of Dancing with the Stars, or if Billy is going to ask them to Prom, to sell your semi-decent sandwiches, don't walk around in a proper chef's shirt pretending you're doing anything else. 蔍t's embarrassing for you and your staff and definitely doesn't do you any favors with the dozen or so people watching you while waiting for their food. 蔖erhaps you're merely having a bad day, but unfortunately for you, there are very few businesses where the premiere impression matters so much. 蔜his is why restaurateurs people hire managers, for both their business affairs and their personnel; simply being able to cook a decent meal doesn't give you any insight on how to work with people. 蔄nd when the food doesn't speak loudly enough to sway my decision whether or not to eat there, I'm forced to rely on something else, and in this case, that something else nets Bruxie a failing grade.

We went to Bruxie awhile back to see what all the hype was about it. My boyfriend got the chicken and waffle. The chicken was a bit dry and a bit bland. Also, I think if the waffle had a bit more flavor it would taste better. Maybe I've just been eating at Roscoe's too much. I got the prosciutto and gruyere. I would say its good, but the filling is so thin! I'm a hungry gal, feed me at least. We topped it off with a Creme Brulee dessert waffle. That was yummy because I'm a creme brulee fanatic, but it was pretty much custard and waffle. Nothing life changing there. I'm not sure if I'd come back here again given the prices, but it was definitely a nice experience. Old Town Orange is super cute to walk around too, especially on a sunny afternoon.

Can I say it here? Bruxie is overrated. Sure, the sandwiches are tasty, but $6 for a light Belgian waffle turned into a taco? It's not even really a real sandwich if you're just using ONE waffle. It's a half sandwich....for $6. I'll save my money for good food that's filling.

I am slowly learning to read the yelp reviews before I go to eat at a restaurant. 蔍 took the advice of other reviews and showed up early (11:20 am). 蔠e didn't have to wait in line (we had 8 or so in our party), but by the time we were done ordering the line had about 10 people in it. 蔠hen we left at about 12:30 the line had at least 25 people. 蔊o early! 蔜he general consensus among our group was that the sweet waffles (we tried the lemon and berry, smores, and cr弇e brule) were delicious but the savory ones (we tried the cheese burger and fried chicken) weren't that special. 蔍 would rather have a regular cheese burger. 蔅ut oh the frozen custard! 蔍 will go back just for frozen custard. 蔍'll be back for an afternoon treat but probably not for lunch.

I was doing some errands near here at dusk. So I decide to check out the hype since it's running late and I don't feel like cook anything at home this late. To me using waffle as buns for sandwich seems just wrong in every way possible; until I met Bruxie. In my head: crunchy, hard, dry, and sweet buns with salty yummy centerpiece. Reality: Soft, warm, yummy, and crispy buns with OMG fillings. I had Prosciutto and Gruyere to go, but I devoured it on the spot. People working at this place knows how to tackle the conjested queue. There will be a Bruxiean come to prepare you with your order if you are in queue. I haven't yet to try any of their sweet stuff but there seem to be an equal amount of demanding crowd as the waffle bunch. Overall, I spent $8 for what I ordered. But it is damn worth it! For the Prosciutto, the Gruyere, and to the waffle.

Great waffles. 蔒aybe a tad on the sweet side when ordering a savory sandwich. 蔍 know the whole sweet/savory combination but I like my sandwiches to stick to one theme. 蔠e tried a bunch and the favorites of the crew were unanimously the bacon, egg and cheese and the PBnJ. 蔜he PBnJ on the waffle was an absolute revelation. 蔆ompletely satisfying as a dessert and the sweet waffle batter was a perfect complement. 蔜he waffle fries (get it?) were ok. 蔍 would have liked them to be fried to a better crisp and it was kind of a small order for $3.00. 蔜he best part about the whole meal was the milkshake or concrete depending on where you're from. 蔜he frozen custard just has a special place in my heart. 蔍'd definitely give this a try if you're in the area.

OMG! I attended an event this past weekend at Chapman. Multiple people went to Bruxie multiple times / day. Quick, cheap, unique food. Loved the owner's descriptions of the food. And the food lived up to everything he said! (Unlike the descriptions a waiter gave of the entree I had a few nights ago at a fancy seafood restaurant.)

Their chicken waffles w/syrup is the best thing in the world. Waffles are light and crispy. Chicken is boneless so there's no hassle when you eat it. Price isn't bad for what you're getting. They also have sodas that are sweetened with cane sugar.

Wow. So impressed with this place! Ashley K. and another friend of ours (Leslie) came down to visit me and we were getting the tour around Orange from my boyfriend. After walking through the circle we were headed to look around Chapman University and saw the sign.... Waffle Sandwiches... we were stopped in our tracks. It wasn't part of the tour but we knew we needed to go back! (And my boyfriend, Ashley K. and Leslie went back again before they left to go back home!) So it was the next morning :) We managed to find our way back with the help of GPS. The parking looked like it might be an issue but we actually found a spot in the small lot. There was no line and we just weren't really sure where to start. When they take your order they take your name first and everyone was so polite. Leslie and I got the Bacon, Egg and Cheese one and they "warned" us there is a light spread of mayo on the waffle. Ashley K. got a Lemon Berry one. I ordered a hot chocolate too but it was actually warm outside and then saw someone else with the iced tea and it looked yummy so I went up to the order and asked if I could change it to iced tea and I told them I didn't care about the price difference (The tea was a little cheaper) So I stood there for a little bit and they were taking a little while and I wasn't sure why and found out it was because they were getting me the change difference. (I ended up putting it in the tip jar) The iced tea tasted as good as it looked. They also make their own sodas from what I understand. So I'll need to try one of those next. A table opened up and we sat and waited for our food and it wasn't long before they were bringing it out to us and napkins and they got straws for us and again I was just really impressed on how nice and polite the crew was. I was hoping the food wasn't going to suck, haha. I took my first bite and then really fell in love. Crispy waffle, seemed shredded bacon (which is nice because you don't end up trying to take one bite and take the whole piece of bacon), gooey cheese and an egg cooked perfectly! Oh my. It was so good. Traded bites with Ashley K. and loved that one as well. I really want to try the chicken one and the s'mores one next :D Plus they have waffle fries and I need to try those. Pricing isn't too shabby so it won't be breaking the bank. Seems like the perfect weekend breakfast stop. Needless to say I will be going back and trying everything and now it's the only place I can talk about to eat at.

The wait in line may sometimes be lengthy, but the line moves quickly and the wait time once an order has been placed is pretty fast. 蔍 tried the waffle fries, cheesy bruxie, and fried chicken bruxie. 蔄lso, I am pregnant, which means I got my first Bruxie burger well-done unlike its default medium, but it was surprisingly succulent. 蔍n fact, before I knew it, all I had left of my burger experience was an empty cardboard box, which I told my husband I was going to save, leash, and walk around, out of sheer love and respect for what it once contained. 蔋e threw the box away when I wasn't looking. �Since that first miraculous burger bite, I've taken my mother, brother, sister, and friend there, I've gone there alone in the rain, and would take anyone who wanted something different, and yet wholly down-home and familiar. 蔜he sweet waffles are beautifully done,and the creme brule waffle was as lovely as a spring morning, but every time I've gone, I've never been able to stray from that Bruxie burger. 蔈xtra pickles. 蔄 triumph every time.

Sucha interesting idea! Sweet + savory waffle sandwiches..who woulda known this place woulda blown up so much. Finally was able to try it last week after having bookmarked it months ago, maybe years ago? I don't remember. Had the chicken+waffle which I highly recommend as a starter if it's your first time. The chicken was cooked perfectly, hot and moist! IMO, I wouldn't recommend it with syrup, waste of a $1, just add hot sauce..if you want sweet, grab a sweet waffle sandwich. I only had one sandwich and was still craving more afterwards. Maybe I'm a fat ass or the portions are just small? I don't know, that's besides the point...but if I were you guys I'd probably get two, one savory and one sweet and you'll be set!

On Saturdays there is an insanely long line and no where to sit but after the first bite you will forget it all ;) It is that good! 蔛eriously I know everyones raving about it but now I 蔾now why. 蔍t is truely one of the best things I have ever eaten. 蔋ands down Finger licking good! 蔍 would advise people to come on a weekday if you can, its a lot less busy and say hi to Collin he is a sweetheart and will give you the best recommendations!

Simply delicious. Good people and customer service. You may be intimidated at first by the line, but this establishment works fast without skimping on their product. I had their specialty, which was the Strawberry Cheesecake, so yummy. It was not heavy, but filling. It seemed to be made out of cream cheese, fresh strawberries that were not tart at all (a pet peeve of mine) and I could have sworn that I tasted some honey. Yum Yum. My friend was recommended by the guy behind the counter the pastrami, which she was in heaven with very bite. The ambience was chill. Seating is outdoors, but it was not at all that bad for a Saturday evening. The tables are either sit down or standing only, and this is a dog friendly place. I am definitely returning.

Food here is amazing. 蔍 had a few friends come visit from the Bay Area and this was somewhere that I had to take them. 蔍 myself hadn't been there before either but I had heard nothing but good things. 蔠hen we first arrived the line was pretty long, which is definitely a good sign! 蔕nce we got in line we were kind of worried it would take a long time, plus the sun was blazing that day. 蔔ot to worry, the staff was extremely friendly and attentive to all the customers, even the ones at the back of the line. 蔜he owner made it a point to provide ice water for everyone waiting in the sun. 蔄lso he went out of his way to move around big patio umbrellas to provide as much shade as possible to patrons waiting in line for these delicious waffle sandwiches. 蔛urprisingly even with a long line of over 20 people it did not take long to get our order in and once it was placed it didn't take more than five minutes before the food was on our table. We ordered the pulled pork sandwich, waffle burger, strawberry cheesecake waffle, and the fried chicken waffle. 蔄ll of it lived up to the hype. 蔜he waffles were all consistent and crunchy on the outside and soft on the inside the way they should be. 蔜he only downside I would have to say was the massive food coma I had to endure and the essential trip to the gym later that day after I had the chance to nap it off :).

We tried this place because of Yelp. 4 people got 5 things to taste. Original Chicken and Waffle, Proscuitto and Gruyere, The special for the day: Pastrami, Scottish/Irish Nachos: Aka Loaded french fries, and Desert. The original chicken was ok, very Herby...lots of Thyme.VERY SALTY Pruscuitto was my favorite, the waffle was crunchy and the cheese wasn't too salty. It was kinda like cheese bread. Pastrami was ok, it had a lot of mustard seed so the flavor was quite tangy. Irish nachos looked good but very salty and its big so we split it. In my opinion, waffles should not be made as sandwich bread unless its got ice cream or some sort of fruit in it... I"m gonna stick to desert for this place because the regular food is very salty. Prices were up there. We spent $50 for 4 people including drinks. Parking was like 4 spaces only. Seating is very limited. This is a college hot spot, so lots of young kids.

Came here for a Sunday breakfast with my boyfriend and was not dissapointed! There was a line when we got there, but it moved rather quickly and we were able to find seats on their outdoor patio quite easily. I had the Brunch Bruxie which was the special. It was eggs, parsley, hash and gruyere. All stuffed in a light and fluffy waffle. Definitely exceeded my expectations. My company got the fried chicken. Normally something I wouldn't care for but the chicken was not heavily breaded and it was tender....and good. Next time definitely want to try one of the more "Sweet" Bruxies. Also waffles fries get 2 thumbs up. Lightly seasoned and cooked to perfection, I could barely finish half of the order. As for drinks all their sodas are made with cane sugar, so yum! This place is definitely a treat.

I love waffles and sandwiches, so when I heard that there was a waffle sandwich place, I had to check it out! The chicken and waffle looked delicious but I decided to stay on the healthier side and my friend and I split the prosciutto waffle and the seasonal boars head! They were both tasty and but its not something I would crave on a weekly basis. Still a nice little joint (outside seating) and good place to check out! I'm definitely trying the chicken and waffle next time I'm here

Incredible. Everything a waffle should be. I once saw a Rachel Ray special where she travelled to Belgium and ate their infamous waffles. That was around five years ago and I've been wanting to try them ever since. I finally had a taste at Bruxie and I am in love! Theyre the perfect consistency- soft on the inside crunch on the outside. They practically melt in your mouth. I had the seasonal mushroom and herb goat cheese with arugula and it was phenomenal. Followed by the Belgian waffle with cinnamon and maple syrup- that's what really won me over. I felt as if I were having the waffle that Rachel Ray had in Belgium but I was in Old Town Orange! Oh and the fact that the owner came out to ask me how the food was and that he had a thick European accent made it feel all the more charming and authentic.

Gourmet Beligum Waffle sandwiches?! Genius!! The crisp yet fluffy waffles are the perfect vehicle for the yummy, savory, and sweet fillings they have to offer. My friend and I were lucky enough to score the last buttermilk chicken waffle and a proscuitto gruyere waffle as well. 蔜he buttermilk chicken was moist and tender, and spiced really well. 蔄 dash of Chalula hot sauce, and it was perfection. The only thing I would ask for is for more slaw, because I love the balance of the crunchy slaw, tender chicken, and fresh warm waffle. The proscuitto and gruyere was hot, ooey, gooey, cheesey, and with that distinct salty bite that proscuitto lends to everything it graces. We were so impressed, as soon as I finished my last bite and wiped my mouth... I was already in line ordering the smoked salmon and dill cream cheese, nutella and banana, lemon cream and berry, and s'more. The lovely guy at the counter recognized us from our "last" time there aka 10 MINUTES, and gave us a complimentary frozen custard to thank us. I fell for it hook, line, and sinker. You got a customer for life buddy. :) We brought the remaining waffles home to share our new found treasure with friends, and found that despite the 20 minute drive, the waffles held up fairly well. Lost the crisp on the way home, but held up well without being soggy. The smoked salmon was super fresh, and paired perfectly with a dill cream cheese, crisp cucumbers, and light chive/green onion? The sweet waffle sanwiches were light and delicate and the perfect ending to a great meal. The only waffle I didn't care for was the lemon cream, the lemon cream/curd was just too tart for the pairing with raspberries and blueberries. I am ecstatic about this new spot, and have been raving about it to everyone I know for the last two days! I would eat any one of these options for breakfast, lunch, dinner, or dessert any day of the week!!

Not bad, but a super long wait on a Sunday afternoon. 蔜he waffle was no bid deal, I could have made one at home with my $10 waffle maker from Target. 蔜he filling was lemon custard with some fruit spread within. 蔍t was just ok, nothing to jump up and drive over there for. 蔒y husband had the burger with fries, and it was ok.

This place really makes a person feel happy; their waffle sandwiches are so good! :) I don't know how they came up with the concept of replacing bread in sandwiches but it's working and making a lot of people very happy! Though there are very limited seats at the site, you can still just take your 'waffle-wich' to-go and enjoy it's delicious-ness elsewhere.

In addition to two wonderful and personable owners who converse with almost every customer, the crisp waffle crust is the first layer of pleasure for your palette as you delve into deliciousness. Offering fillings for what is in essence a waffle sandwich, you can choose from sweet or savory items. The SMores and Prosciutto/Gruyere cheese offerings are musts. Peers coffee is served fresh and every waffle is made to order...nothing is premade. Set adjacent to old town Orange, this converted burger stand is manned by friendly staff, a clean kitchen and the recipes are carefully developed. Every creation is a masterpiece...a true gem.

MOTHER - WAFFLIN- SANDWICHES. This place is amazing. I am going to start off by saying 1 ) How impressed I was with the level of service I received for a small walk up window kinda joint , and 2) How quick the line moved even though it looked as if it was going to take an eternity. The food speaks volumes for itself, expertly prepared, delicious combinations and fairly decent prices. The only major down side is lack of seating, but well worth it if you have to take it to go. Oh ya and dont forget to add a handmade soda, or Peets coffee. Bonus points for both of those options.

Order and eat on site if you will. Park on the street but beware permit-only areas. I've been here a few times and will rate this on my most recent experience. Service is quick given the lines that grow to place an order. I had the chicken waffle, waffle fries, and their seasonal strawberry shake. Don't get the waffle sandwich to-go. I don't live that far away and by the time I got home (10 minutes later), 1/3 of it was on the soggy side. The waffle fries could use a lot less salt. I like that they are seasoned with ground black pepper. The seasonal strawberry shake was topped with whipped cream and a drizzle of strawberry. The shake was just ok, which sucks since it was $5. Insert Pulp Fiction shake quote here. The waffle sandwiches, both savory and sweet - are good - on location.

wow, what a goldmine. 蕎hoever thought of waffle sandwiches must have been godsend. 蕎hat's special about this place is the homey/community atmosphere, with outdoor benches with heat lamps, and a super-nice server (Tagan) that brings out your food while you're waiting at a table. 蔵 have to also compliment the service b/c while my friends and i were waiting for our Bruxie Burger and Buttermilk Fried Chicken & Waffle, 5 min. turned into 20 min., and our stomachs started to growl wondering what the hold-up was. �Lo and behold, there was a mixup of orders, and someone else at the table was chowing down on my burger, as i drooled in eager anticipation. 蔉ortunately, the lovely Tagan brought out our food in due-time, apologized for the mixup and offered complimentary fries "on-the-house" - awesome two-thumbs up service! went with two other friends and none of them got full, and ended up ordering a second waffle, my advice is if you're looking to get full, try the Bruxie Burger, it's not only filling, but the gourmet patty was worth chewing slowly for.

woke up the other morning craving WAFFLES! i immediately thought this would be a good opportunity to 蕋ry this place out. so made the trek out to orange... and it was totally worth it! I ordered the buttermilk fried chicken and my friend got the bruxie burger. i nearly died after the first bite. it was sooooo good! the chili honey has a bit of a kick but totally compliments the chicken. As for the bruxie burger.. i dont know if its because i dont usually eat burgers but this one was sooo juicy and exceeded my expectations! We also ordered a side of waffle fries which i thought were a little salty but made for a great pair with our sandwiches. even after devouring our meal, i felt we had to try one of their desserts.. so i went back and got the nutella and banana. yummers! but who am i kidding anything with warm gooey nutella in it is a winner. 蔰efinitely satisfied my waffle craving. aside from the fab food, the customer service is so great! all the servers were really friendly and helpful. First of all, they come find you to give you the food! You don't have to hang around the pick up window anticipating your name being called. Then they occasionally stop by to see how things are going and even spark up a convo with you. really something you don't expect from basically a burger joint. overall, not only was the food great but so was the atmosphere! something worth trying when youre in the OC. i enjoyed it so much i ended up coming back two days later! parking tip: although they have a limited parking lot.. the streets have designated 30 min parking spots.

I was so hyped to try Bruxie after seeing it in the newspaper. The call of sweet and salty had my attention. Waffle and beef? Sounds 蔳ood. When I arrived there was a line which never dissuades me if the product is good. When I got up to order, I ordered the cheese burger with bacon and avocado (go big or go home, right?), waffle fries, and cream soda. We sat down and waited for our order. The burger and soda came out in about 7 minutes. I wanted to wait for my fries but after waiting another 5 minutes I started eating my burger. It was high quality meat and ingredients but the waffle it came in nearly had no taste! I was expecting a sweetness but it really tasted like nothing. The texture was good but that was about it. As I finished the first half of my burger and drank my soda (which was delicious but a bit overpriced) I eyed the line hoping for my fries. I asked the server and he said they were coming. Then I see the owner come out and talk to a friend at a table. I knew it was the owner because he mentioned it to the man he was talking to. I know creating your own business is hard work (I own my own business) but I feel that when you are that far in the weeds you should be in the kitchen busting your butt not outside talking to people about your newest write up in the newspaper. So more than 10 minutes later (yes, a whole fifteen minutes or more after i got my burger and sat down), I had finished my burger and was still waiting for fries. I was right up front and in the servers path so I know he didn't forget. The owner, still standing nearby chatting, looked at me and did not help either. Finally, after I had thrown out my trash and was just standing around, my fries came out and within direct earshot of the owner, I explained that I had already eaten my meal and had to wait for 20+ minutes for one order of fries. The owner chuckled and said he was sorry about the wait. That was it. I was really hoping that this place would be my new "spot" but with such horrid service coming directly from the owner, I can't support them. I gave two stars just for the quality of their beef and because once I got the fries, they were very good. I won't be returning. side note: I know new business' need to work kinks out. But it was the owners attitude that lost me. He came off as so proud of his newspaper write ups and hype that he didn't care about us (other customers were treated the same when I was there).

I used to come here a lot when I worked in Orange. Long lines during lunch time. Must try the strawberry shake, sooo good! Some of the items were a little bit greasy but they taste good. They have some good specials so check out what they have for the day on the chalk board. Waffle sandwich creations are good but a suggestion would to Bruxie would be to use Belgian Waffles instead. The waffles themselves are a little bit bland. This was not the first time i had a waffle sandwich. If you really wanna try really good waffles �savory & sweet) and are in Portland, OR, try The Waffle Window. Otherwise Bruxie will suffice for now.

I went to Bruxie's last Sunday for my second time. We waited in the 20+ minute line and to our delight they had SPECIALS! 蔍 ordered the turkey reuben special, the smore's bruxie, and a frozen custard... that combination = simply amazing!! Honestly, as long as you get a savory bruxie, then a sweet bruxie with a frozen custard to finish your meal you will be have the full bruxie experience. 蔠ell worth the drive and well worth the wait in line. 蔍 tried a bite of my boyfriend's bruxie burger and it was huge! 蔍t had 2 beef patties in there with tillamook cheese.. I honestly can't figure out which one is my favorite. 蔜he burger was juicy and the turkey reuben was also equally tasty. 蔜he turkey was thinly sliced and the melted cheese with the sauerkraut mix (I think) really made it special. 蔠e had the waffle fries again and they weren't seasoned as much as the last time but still tasty. 蔜he next time I go there I will definitely be torn on whether or not to try a new sweet bruxie or stick with the delicious, chocolaty, marshmallow oozing smores bruxie. 蔍t's really rich but it pairs so nicely with the frozen custard... I practically finished the large one WITH my bruxie by myself... everyone was surprised I finished all of that food.. even myself. �Tables are limited so unless you're getting it to-go or don't mind standing at the tables on the right, I suggest you scout the area for someone that's getting ready to go and have your friend wait in line while you hold down a spot if you find one. 蔄nd usually if there's a larger table with only 2 people sitting there, I'm 80% sure they will offer you a spot next to them, and 100% sure they will if you ask. �I also thought it was cool that they had a large dog bowl filled with water so you can bring along your other best friend. 蔍 wish I had known that so I could bring mine! 蔍 know it's okay to do that since you're sitting outside but I thought the dog bowl made it even more welcoming... just when I thought Bruxie couldn't get any better.. it did. :)

I go to school nearby and yummm is this place amazing!! My favorites are the prosciutto & gruyere (basically ham & cheese but sooo good), the pastrami (which is a special and can only get it sometimes) and the nutella one for dessert. But I've tried different ones and they were all pretty good. It is a bit pricey but totally worth it. Amazing!

Not bad! But the hype is a little too strong Tried the Bruxie Burger and the Fried Chicken Waffle Pricing points are a little high but not terrible, $6.99 for both entrees. The portion size was very fair for the price. The Fried Chicken Waffle was very good, the chicken was very juicy and the accompanying sauce went well with the chicken (reminded me a bit of Sweet and Sour Chicken). The cole slaw was pretty lacking and the waffle was pretty soggy before putting the sauce and cole slaw on (I ordered this on the side). The waffle wasn't able to hold its state and acted more as a tortilla by the end. The Bruxie Burger was average. Unlike the bold flavors of the seasoning on the chicken and the spicy chili sauce of the chicken waffle, the Bruxie Burger had a very standard taste. This was pretty much any kind of burger you could get at a diner on a waffle. Again, the waffle was pretty soggy but I will give them props for using Tillamook cheddar! I would definitely come back to Bruxie to try their "sweet" waffles, but I think I'll lay off the burgers and make the walk down to Haven and pay an extra $4 for a better burger experience.

I've bumped up my rating 'cause I went back and tried their chocolate shake. The best I've ever had. Forget the waffles and get a shake. It tasted like chocolate cream pie filling in a cup. At $5 it's a tad pricey, but delicious. I'm still not sold on their waffle sandwiches and I've tried the hamburger and fried chicken since my first visit.

We had dinner tonight, 3hrs later and I feel like I ate fair food. I just don't get why this place is such a bid deal. 蔜he food is average at best, and the location/staff are below that. We were waiting in line when their obnoxious greeter came up to me. 蔄t first I thought that was nice of her to offer to explain their menu to me, as this was only my 2nd visit. 蔛he asked if i had been there before then probed about what I had the 1st time. I told her that i didn't remember, to which she kept pushing to try to figure it out. 蔊uess what troll, it wasn't memorable. Seating sucks - limited and outside only. There isn't a place to wait without hovering over people that are trying to eat. We took our order to go. 10+ mins later... Even though we were only 8ft from the window, she brought our order to us. 蔛uper unprofessional, and tried to make some stupid a$$ joke about giving our order to someone else or something. The food was edible but not spectacular. The waffles were soggy by the time we got back to the house - not their fault. The chicken was alright, but I couldn't help but think it tasted a little like dirt. 蔜he rib special was better than the chicken, but not really worth going through the hassle of this place. Would have been 3 stars, but the greeter troll bugged me. 蔜he frozen custard was tastey though. 3 stars for the food minus one for staff/location

I was hungry and got the mushroom waffle sandwich, it was good...not good like foodorgasminmymouth, but good. 蔍 should have gotten something sweet, I think it's because I am not a fan of savory and sweet, haha. 蔍 will be back for a sweet delightful waffle. :]

worth the wait in line...even on a Thursday afternoon after the lunch rush. The waffles are light and toasty crisp on the outside and air light on the inside...a real nice compliment to either sweet or savory fillings. We had: The braised beef, grilled onions, bleu cheese waffle potatoes waffle sandwich. This is not on the regular menu, so you can't get it all the time. OMG, this was so good. The braised beef was in a rich gravy and just went so well with the toasty waffles. If you were on death row and this was your last meal, you could close your eyes and smile and not notice the noose around your neck or the metal clamps on your arms and legs...it would be total bliss until the next episode. The brie cheese and prosciutto was like a grilled cheese for adult foodies. It was so good that you could cut it up into little bites and serve it at a party. The cheese burger was okay. My daughter loved the Smores but couldn't finish it because it was so filling. Don't forget to wash down your waffles with one of their natural sugar cane sodas...even if you don't normally drink sodas (which I don't), it's good to splurge sometimes. The only set back is the parking. it's tough because you can't park in the residential area, which sucks...unless you luck out and one of the nice neighbors offer to lend you their parking permit.

A day after their grand opening and it wasn't as packed as I thought it would be. They did run out of waffle batter when I got there but I stayed and waited it out for about an hour until they finished making it. During the waiting time, I got the frozen custard and it was really good, thick and extra creamy. I tried the Bruxie's Burger and the Buttermilk Chicken which were both really good. The meat for both were so tender and was cooked perfectly. Although it was really good, I thought there was just something missing. I'll definitely come back to try all the other waffles sandwiches. Oh, and the parking sucks ass.

One of my friends recommended Bruxie and it surely is unique and delicious. It's difficult to choose from the menu, whether it be a savory or a sweet waffle sandwich. But when you do finally order, the food does not disappoint. The waffles themselves are crispy on the outside and it has a nice buttery and soft interior. I've had the salmon with dill cream cheese, lemon cream with berries, and the chicken and waffle sandwiches; all of which were delicious as is. But one of their items that stood out to me were their waffle fries. I honestly wish that I had an unlimited amount of those when I'm there. The only thing that's keeping this place from a 5 star is that it is kind of pricey and there's limited seating. In addition, it's pretty far from where I live.

My advice- Go with lots of people so you can try more than one ;) I ordered the Sun Dried Tomato and Goat cheese. It was amazinggg. The crispy fluffiness of the waffle went great w/ the tasty arugala and balsamic. (You have to really like goat cheese bc they put on a hefty amount). I also had a bite of Prosciutto & Gruyere which was delicious.. how can you go wrong w/ Prosciutto? The Bruxie Burger and the Fried chicken were also good but not my cup of tea. They have crisscut fries that taste delicious w/ their frozen custard. I can't take credit for that unusual food pairing- I tried this upon the suggestion of Kelly- one of the business parters. He definitely went above and beyond to make sure we got the full experience. Such a down to earth business owner! I also had the cola made of pure cane sugar. It was slightly different but a good different. Onto desserts! I couldn't help my little self so we got 4- lemon cream and berries, ogura bruxie, S'mores, Fruit & Cream. The Ogura (red bean & sweet cream) was my definite favorite.

Nice little eatery near Chapman University. Order at the counter type place with only outdoor seating. However there are heat lamps for cold nights. Plethora of different types of waffle sandwiches and desserts. Had the smoked salmon and dill which was good. The waffles are very fluffly, light, and not sweet at all so it doesn't clash with the savory fillings. Also don't forget to check out the seasonal specials on the chalkboard-I tried the pulled pork waffle sandwich which was very tender and full of flavor. Came with an excellent slaw and slightly tangy and spicy bbq sauce. Only complaint was that the waffle got a bit mushy, so eat this one quickly. Would recommend trying their Irish waffle fries (has some cheese sauce, sour cream, real hearty bacon pieces). Delish, but extremely filling. Would recommend sharing this. I wanted to try their seasonal date shake, but unfortunately they were out :( Can't wait to go to Bruxie's again to try their dessert menu items and hopefully they'll have the date shake. Highly recommended!

Wow, this place is unique and has good food. 蔍 had a pastrami sandwich, yes, it sounds strange to have a pastrami sandwich on a waffle but rest assured, it is good. 蔜he only negatives are they only have outside seating and there really isn't anything healthy so go on a day when you're willing to throw the health food diet out the window. 蔜he line to order was long but the food came very quickly and the service was fantastic.

delicious, delicious, delicious. oh, and did i mention: DELICIOUS?? my only complaint is that i wish it was closer to my house so i could frequent the joint more often. their chicken in a waffle is definitely my favorite but even their more simpler options such as the belgian + nutella is delicious. it can get pretty crowded but the waiting time is so worth it. if anything you can ask to take it to go if there aren't places to sit. they take to-go into consideration by separating all the goods so that the waffles won't get soggy. but let's be real-- you won't be able to resist and will probably be eating the bad boys half way to your car.

DELISH! I came here with the boyfriend and his parents while they were in town for a visit. We were all VERY satisfied and can't wait to go back! We were actually heading to a vegetarian restaurant just a couple houses down, but it happened to be closed on Sundays. It all worked out though! My boyfriend had the pulled pork (special), and his mother and I split the Wild Mushroom (special) and Smoked Salmon. Both the Wild Mushroom and Smoked Salmon were FAB! Great for a hot day, especially the Smoke Salmon because it was cool and light. There were both the perfect mixes of flavor! The waffles they are served on are perfect. They aren't too sweet, so they go well with the savory sandwiches. I have yet to try any of their sweet concoctions, but I am sure they are awesome too with names like S'Mores, and Nutella and Banana! If you are near this place and looking for somewhere to grab a bite (or dessert), don't miss out on this gem! You won't regret it!!!

This place is a MUST try! I kept hearing how good this place was, until I finally decided to try it for myself! I had the cheeseburger waffle, DELICIOUS!! Who would of thought combining waffles and hamburger meat with all the trimmings!?!? The service was super friendly and helpful. The French Fries were also pretty tasty too. Their portions are pretty big, so if you're not a big eater, I highly recommend you share with someone. The ONLY downfall is that this place is all outdoors and has limited seating. So on a cold and day, it will be really hard to enjoy these sandwiches. The ambiance is great! This place sits right in the middle of Old Town Orange, across the street from Chapman University. I am looking forward to going back again!

This place is crazy delicious. The breakfast waffle sandwiches are falvorful and fantastic, but the less obvious, savery, lunch waffle sandwiches are equally great. They are melt in your mouth good, with a large variety for such a small fan ( and a few really good vegetarian options). Gets four stars because it is kind of pricey for the amount of food you are getting, but worth it to buy every so often.

I found this place on Yelp and saw that it had great reviews. Since it was close by where I live, I decided to try it out. My cousin and I split the chicken and waffle and the cheeseburger waffle. I've had chicken and waffles before so I didn't think the cheeseburger waffle sandwich would be good. It was soooo yummy! I liked it better than the chicken waffle sandwich. The price was very reasonable. I would definitely recommend Bruxie.

Had the Bruxie burger and the smoked salmon. They were both good, but they were not as filling as I thought. The bruxie burger meat was medium rare, which made it really tasty! but other than the waffle it tasted like a regular burger. The smoked salmon was a little chewy which is a plus. It had some dill creme cheese that gave it an extra kick. Dipping every piece in the maple syrup made the bites taste much better. Over all I gave it a 3 because I don't see myself craving it. Menu is a little small, so you can try everything in two escapades. Good experience though!

I had the fried chicken and waffles here and it was great quality. The chicken was very juicy and had a light sweet glaze on top. The waffles were very light, but I felt they didn't have very much flavor. The atmosphere of the place was friendly and the service was incredibly fast. 蔄lthough the food was tasty, it wasn't very filling. It is definitely great for a light lunch, but not if you are really hungry.

My friends suggested that we should come down here sometime and I am so glad we did (: Honestly, from the outside, it doesn't look like very much (small with outside seating, etc.), but facade alone should never deter you away from trying new food n__n and it IS a food stand, of course Just looking at their menu on what they had to offer made my mouth water! I was feeling greedy and I wanted a waffle from the savory and sweet lists~ but in the end, I just picked the savory smoked salmon (my fave!) with herb cream cheese and cucumber waffle. After taking my first bite, I felt myself soaring to waffle-heaven *laughs* n__n So delicious!! The buttery salmon, crunchy cucumbers, and velvety cream cheese wrapped in a crisp yet soft waffle were a food-texture symphony. �The only thing that made this place fall short from receiving a 5-star rating from me are their drinks. My strawberry lemonade was too sweet and both of my friends' floats were just an horrendous combination of flavors. When I wanted to have something else to wash down whichever drink I just had, it was a lose-lose-lose situation at hand . But overall, the food is good, drinks are meh, & service is friendly (:

I went here last night and for the most part food was fantastic! What keeps me from giving it a 5 star is because it's an outdoor/patio eatery and the heat lamps didn't do much good to keep me warm. The staff is very courteous and at least they bring the food out to you! I tried the chicken waffle. The waffle is light and crispy and the fried chicken is lightly battered, perfectly seasoned, juicy, and so yum! My hubby tried the short rib special which was also delish. 蔠e shared the liege waffle with nutella and frozen custard soft serve. The liege waffle was good BUT I personally think the one at Coffee Bean is better!! It's a bit of a drive for me to go back but I would def recommend it.

Bruxie is such a cute little place right next to Chapman University. I love the little town feel and friendly environment of this area. Who would of thought a waffle sandwich could taste so good? And the service! The servers are all so nice. You place your order from the little shack and sit at any available table around the restaurant outside. The servers will call your name and they will bring you your food. After I was done before I could even get up to throw my trash away a server already came by and asked if he can throw it away for me. Definitely great service! I went with a friend and we shared the Bruxie burger and the buttermilk with fried chicken. The sauce and cole slaw in the buttermilk was delicious! and the burger was juicy. Sadly, I was too full to try any of the desserts. I will definitely come back to try the desserts I hear so highly of!

i have been passing this place for the past 2 years and have been wanting to go for the last year. finally i had an appetite for it. even though i am willing to go back i still will only give it two stars because the second i got my food i ate one of the waffle fries, warm almost cold. couple minute walk to my car and they were cold. if i would have had them fresh and hot they possibly could have been really good. but they almost reminded me of carl's jr. fries. not so good. i also got the waffle burger. it was alright... pretty much an OK burger on a waffle. that also was warm. this meal wasn't worth the price nor the wait, but i'm still going back to try other things and hopefully give Bruxie more stars.

i've been here a handful of times, and i've had decent to exceptional experiences. the first time i visited i had the beef brisket and the smoked salmon. my waffle was really soggy by the time i got my meal. i don't know if it was because it was uncooked or if it just happened to get soggy within a few minutes from the juices of the brisket and moisture from the cucumbers and cream cheese, but that alone made my experience with the food barely okay. but the other times that i came back, i had the sundried tomatoes and goat cheese. my waffle was perfectly made and it still had a slight crunch to it. which really sealed the deal for me. that's all i wanted from the waffle sandwich and it was great. the combination of sundried tomatoes, goat cheese, and arugula leaves were really good. it was aromatic and crisp with a creamy texture to it. i thoroughly enjoyed this waffle sandwich. the waffle fries were excellent. not too oily and not too salty. i'd recommend trying the cola also. the service here is great and there are plenty of condiments to choose from. it's a pleasant little brunch spot with plenty of neighborhood parking. worth visiting and revisiting.

I was a bit skeptical when my friends told me we were gonna go to a place that sells waffle sandwiches. 蔍 was thinking of some big doughy buttery contraption that Paula Deen would make...but no, I was wrong. 蔜he waffle was hot, crispy, fluffy but not too thick and not greasy...just right to hold in your sandwich fixins! �I had the cheddar bacon & egg and I thought it was delish! �The place is small and seating is all outdoors. There is a semi-decent amount of counter space & tables to stand and eat which doesn't bother me. 蔄nd the misters all around to keep you cool are nice. 蔜he only reason I gave it 4 stars is 'cause there is no public restroom and of course I had to pee really really bad.

Super creative menu, my favorite thing is the "smoked salmon and dill cream." Who would have thought salmon and dill would taste good on a waffle? But it does and it is amazing. The homemade sodas are yummy too! And the service is great, everyone is super friendly. The only downside is the wait can be pretty long and seating is limited, but its definitely worth it even if you can't find somewhere to sit :)

My husband and I tried Bruxie for dinner. 蔠e had watched them set up in what seemed like weeks after the Dairy Treat or as we liked to refer to as the Teriyaki Special place switched ownership. 蔠e live local and we always try what pops up in downtown Orange. �On this cold, windy night, we hopped on down the street. 蔠e discovered a decent sized crowd which made up the Bruxie line. 蔍 know it opened today, but I wasn't expecting a line. �Here are our first impressions: Presentation **** Cute upgrade to the location with the paint colors, signage, and tables. 蔜he branding is simple, chic and clean. 蔄lthough, the tag line "The Bold Fold" makes my husband think of the female anatomy. 蔊ood or bad...it is memorable. 蔠e don't have to worry about parking, but we know it to be limited and must be a struggle for a new business. 蔋owever, with Chapman University nearby, we can see it being a lunchtime favorite that is easy to walk to. �Service �*** As I mentioned, the line was long and slow. 蔠e didn't really see that as a problem being that Bruxie has just opened and probably wasn't anticipating the rush, which also reveals why they were out of the Chicken and Waffle sandwich and the Bacon, Egg, and Cheese Sandwich. 蔜here was a very helpful person delivering completed orders and answering questions. 蔍 would be happy to hire her for any service job as she was friendly, prompt, and cute. 蔠e thought it was weird that the waffle fries came out first. 蔜hen 10 minutes later the custard came out, and then finally, the sandwiches a few minutes later. 蔍t would have been nice to get everything at once to keep what needed to be hot, hot and what needed to stay cold, cold. �Food �Waffle Fries �**** We enjoyed the fries immensely. 蔜hey were hot, crispy and delicious. 蔠e didn't even need ketchup with them. 蔠e ate them before anything else could arrive. �Bruxie Burger **** We found that the waffle worked really well with the burger. 蔍t gave the sandwich an unexpected crispiness and was not really sweet at all to distract from the flavor of the burger. 蔜he burger was meaty, juicy and not over cooked. 蔜he tomato and lettuce were very fresh. 蔜he only thing that could have improved it was some of the tasty cheese that you can get when you order a Cheesy Bruxie. �Sun-dried Tomato and Goat Cheese ** Not worth the money at all. 蔍 love this combination of flavors normally, but it was overpowered by the waffle. 蔜here was not nearly enough sun-dried tomato and there was no indication of the balsamic reduction. 蔜his was just a fold. 蔜here was very little filling. 蔍 think this is the challenge with "The Bold Fold." 蔍 gave more than half of it for my husband to eat because I didn't want to waste my calories. �Custard �** I wasn't a huge fan of the custard. 蔍 think you can get a better tasting value with frozen yogurt. 蔜hat said, it was very creamy and my husband thought it was very tasty and rich, but he felt it could use some hot fudge or butterscotch. �Price �** For a higher-end fast food restaurant the prices were basically typical, but the sun-dried tomato sandwich was way over priced for what you get. 蔕ther than that, I would say that the prices weren't great or terrible, hence, 3 stars. �Overall �*** We believe Bruxie has a lot of potential in downtown Orange, but will need to work out the kinks. 蔜he kinks being the delivery of food, and menu being hit or miss. 蔠e still need to try the sweet waffles to be fair and we know Peet's coffee is great. 蔕ur suggestions would be: 蔐et the poor girl delivering food and announcing numbers be there for questions and clean up and get a PA system to announce numbers. 蔛ave yourself some labor and have the customers pick up their stuff. 蔍t will save you some trouble and customers are used to being called up for fast food at a window. 蔄lso, call the order when everything is done and not one item at a time. 蔍t would have been nice to have the fries with the sandwich. 蔠e are looking forward to seeing what you will serve up at the Orange International Food Fair. 蔊ood Luck!

The food is great! I love love love their waffle. It's really soft on the inside and crunchy on the outside. I always go for the burger because I just love it so much! The custard is really good too. I just don't like waiting in line for the food because it's so long and it takes forever too. Other than that, the service is great, and so is the food!

Had the buttermilk fried chicken and waffle; eggs, cheese, and bacon waffle; creamsicle float; and soft serve frozen custard. So full but 蕇atisfying. Not a lot of seats on a Saturday afternoon, but the food is worth the wait. The chicken was seasoned and fried nicely and the waffle was a nice crispy addition. The egg, cheese, and bacon waffle was so-so, but I'm not big on breakfast sandwiches. Service was friendly and knowledgeable but you really got to be aggressive when waiting for the seats or all the other hawks will sweep in.

Ohhhhh Bruxieeee, you soo sexxyyyy~~~~ I have never had chicken and waffles before and was curious to see how the 2 plays together. I have to say Bruxie defintely opened my eyes. The cripsy and juicy chicken breast along with the sweet sauce on 2 toasty waffles was extremely good. Too bad its not available in Norcal.

The food here is always fast, good, and consistent. The staff is always very friendly as well which is always a plus for me. Interestingly enough, all of the bread here is substituted for waffles. The Bruxie Burger is what I had my first time here and I must say it was much lighter than a normal burger but it wasn't as satisfying...there wasn't anything really special about the burger itself except that it had no bread and waffle instead. The only reason this place got me to visit again was because of my second visit which I tried their chicken and waffles which was UNBELIEVABLE. The chicken is fried and has syrup tucked in between a whole waffle. MMMMMMmmm

Wow, really wanted to try this place when I saw it online. I think pure curiosity brought me in. When I show up my friend is already there and talking to one of the chefs (I think). He asks what I am going to order and I tell him, unfortunately, they aren't making that sandwich/waffle that night. He goes in and comes back out saying the chef WILL make it for me! SCORE!! Great concept, good, amazing food, the location is good and with the concept and menu it is good that it is a walk up location and not some huge sitdown type restaurant.

This was my first time eating a chicken waffle sandwich, and it was yummmayy! I got the famous chicken and waffle sandwich, it was a decent size, the waffles are airy and the chicken was drizzled with honey. I also had a bite of my friend's strawberry creme brulee waffle sandwich, which I actually likef better than my waffle sandwich :P The place is a cute little joint with outdoor that is self-seating. The servers actually come to you to give you your order when they call your name out, very friendly people! :)

I ordered the fried chicken waffle and the fries and it was amazing. 蔍've never had such a weird combination before, but it works. 蔍 would opt out on the syrup since it has a little sweetness to it already. 蔒ake sure you add a little touch of rooster sauce for that extra kick.

Who would've thought a waffle could me eaten in so many gourmet ways? 蔠ell, it's possible. �After reading about this place from AAA Westways magazine, we decided to have lunch here the following day. �Just like most of the reviews say, about long waits and long lines...it's true. 蔛o, if you're truly hungry and want food ASAP, don't go here. 蔅ut if you don't mind waiting in line for 20 minutes and another 20 minutes for your food then I definitely recommend eating here. 蔍 had the Burger and IT WAS DELICIOUS! 蔜hen I had some of my daughter's Belgian Waffle with maple syrup and powdered sugar, OMG it was so light and fluffy, melt in your mouth awesomeness! 蔍 didn't feel so weighed down. �They have other gourmet sandwiches, which I'm definitely coming back for and they have other sweet waffle selections, as well as their seasonal menu. Why 4 stars, mainly because of the wait and the fact that it's not a sit down restaurant. 蔣ou have to scope the property to find a table to sit on after you order your food, or stand by the window and eat on tall counters. 蔅ut it's one of those places where you have to "eat your food right there and then because it won't taste as good when you get home". 蔣ou might have to stalk some people and nab their spot when they're done to get a spot. 蔕h, and parking is little tough. 蔣ou will have to find public parking areas and walk a bit, a few blocks or so. 蔣ou can't park in the neighborhoods, unless you have a permit. So, yeah! 蔍t was good and worth the wait!

One of my favorite places to dine around in the OC is Downtown Orange, and when foodie news hit that a restaurant would serve waffle'wiches....I was elated to hear about it and couldn't wait to get my hands on a delicious treat. I didn't dare to try it on opening day and I heard they ran out of the "fried chicken and waffles" - that would have been one of my top choices, too. My husband and fellow foodie friend came here for breakfast this past weekend, and we were lucky enough to avoid any of the long lines that I had been reading about. I think waffles are the best way to start your day for breakfast. The Bruxie serves up gourmet waffle sandwiches with some tasty concoctions that will salivate your glands. Something savory like the apple wood smoked bacon, egg and cheddar - which was my husband's pick of the day. I had a tough time deciding between the savory and sweet because everything sounded soooo good. I finally decided on something sweet - the Lemon cream and berries. We also got two coffees to perk us up. I'm very happy that they serve one of our favorite coffees from Peets - it is one of the best brewed cup of coffees. The quality of coffee is quite exceptional and such a perfect pairing for a tasty waffle. My foodie friend, Marlon, had ordered the prosciutto and gruyere combo with waffle fries and seasonal shake - Pumkpin. Yes, he ordered a shake for breakfast - that's how he rolls. There isn't a better time than the morning to enjoy yourself a nice frosty treat right? Tasting...SMACKTASTIC - like lick your lips and smack yourself in the face and say OMG - because it's one of the best waffles that I have had. It's not too dense like an eggo waffle or nothing like Roscoe's buttery and soft waffles but something about the texture was oh.so.right. and it was perfectly cooked. It had a nice balance of crispy and buttery and never overpowered the fillings. I loved the tangy lemon curd mixed with the sweet berries and I was sad when I finished my last bite. I seriously could have eaten another waffle all by itself.My husband oohed and ahhed over how he could eat this every day of the week if he could. Marlon said they need to open a taco truck and I'll be the driver! haha My only concern is the seating is quite sparse and luckily since there were only the three of us - and we got a booth. Design wise - if they had added a counter height table alongside their mural wall - there would be space for everyone to put down their food or drinks and enjoy the food. I hate holding my drink and food at the same time and it takes away from enjoying the food - I felt bad for the people standing around. Parking kinda sucks A LOT. Permit signs are located everywhere since Chapman University is right across the street. I might have to ride my bike here for my next visit so I don't have to fight the parking wars of the residents. Customer service was great - the cashier was eager and happy to please and so was our waiter girl. I love happy working people that means I'll be a happy paying customer. Aside from the crazy parking issues - the waffles are soooo outstanding and definitely a food explosion in your mouth. I'd say go ahead and jump on this waffle train because it's BOMB-DIGGITY-DELICIOUS!!!!!!!

If you're in the mood for something decadent at a reasonable price, Bruxie is the place to go. 蔜he Buttermilk Fried Chicken and Waffle is a stand out. 蔉ried Chicken Sandwiches have become a staple of fast food and American eateries, but Bruxie's waffle-as-bread and Chili Honey topping make this one a real treat. 蔜he waffle Fries are yummy. Sweet sandwiches are also delicious. 蔍 especially like the Creme Brulee, but if you need a chocolate fix the S'Mores is good as well. 蔜he staff is helpful, friendly and visible. 蔈very time I've gone, there's been a greeter who will explain menu items and make recommendations and I've always been asked by a waiter how the meal was. 蔍 find this pretty impressive for what is essentially a food stand. 蔒y only complaint is the lack of bathrooms, if only for hand washing after eating a sandwich that oozes honey all over you. 蔅ring wet wipes, and be prepared to wait. 蔍t's worth it.

I wanted to see what all the hype was about so I drove my brother here after picking him up from school. There was a bit of traffic as I think this was around the downtown area of Orange and located right next to Chapman University. Parking was horrible so finding street parking might take awhile. It started raining on us literally the minute we got out of the car, but I was determined at this point to get my waffle. There was a long line when we got there, but they were fast and efficient so the wait wasn't too bad. We ordered the buttermilk fried chicken waffle and the prosciutto and gruyere waffle and took them home because it was freezing outside and there was no indoor seating (outdoor only and they only provide a few benches). I believe both of our orders came out to be around $16. Pretty pricey if you ask me and it didn't even fill us up. Both waffles were really good with all that melted cheese and the waffle was crunch on the outside and soft on the inside. Taste was definitely a 5/5. I would totally get more if it wasn't so pricey and located in an inconvenient area.

This is a good place for a good start to the day or just great for any time. 蔍t's a nice little building with outside seating right next to Chapman �University. 蔣ou can already tell how popular it is with the amount of people waiting in line. 蔠hile waiting in line, a worker came up and gave 蕌s a smaller version of their menu so we would have an idea of what to order by the time we got to the window. Also another plus he gave us an explanation of their specials board and tried to sell us some of the favorites. I ordered the cheesy bruxie with double bacon and got a strawberry lemonade. 蔜he waffle was delicious. It was light and crispy and not too heavy like a lot of waffle places. The cheese was nice and melted and the bacon was cut into nice bits instead of strips. 蔜he strawberry lemonade was nice and sweet and a great compliment to the waffle. 蔜he waffle fries they have a delicious as well. 蔜hey are fries cut into the shape of potatoes and fried in peanut oil and seasoned with a nice seasoned salt. 蔜hey were nice and light and not at all oily. I would definitely come back to this place if they had one in Vegas. 蔊uess I'll have to wait till my next trip to Cali.

Being open for only 5 months this little stand located right across the street from Chapman University has already blown in popularity.The staff and the owners here are very friendly and helpful. The seating arrangements can be tricky since theres only a few seats and a lot of customers. ��Buttermilk Fried Chicken & Waffle: As far as the name goes that's all there was to it. Now I understand that chili honey and coleslaw are also featured in the sandwich, but there was a serious lack of both if there was any. All i got was a thin line of sauce and tiny tiny bits of coleslaw.={ Although with only the few bites I had that included both ingredients the sandwich was quite good, but unfortunately not my favorite. ��Mushroom & Goat Cheese added Avocado (seasonal): Artisan comes to mind when I had this sandwich, truly one of the most unique tasting thus far. Bold earthy mushrooms paired with a tangy goat cheese gave my taste buds something to remember. But something they did not even noticed was the avocado which only a little was placed in the one half of the sandwich that split with my girlfriend. 75�of avocado? More like 10� None the less I don't think it even needed it was delicious on it's own. Top Pick ��Braised Short Rib (seasonal): Now this is a sandwich, the epitome of the word savory. It featured a big heaping amount of juicy meat that reminded of top quality Carnitas, sharp blue cheese that provided a bite at the end of your tongue, and stuffed with waffle fries that really only took up space. Another nice feature to this sandwich was the Au Jus style sauce on the side that has surprising Wasabi kick in the end, absolutely delightful .^^ Without a doubt in my top 2 so far, I really wish this was on the permanent menu. �蔄 few things about the waffles tho, I came here thinking they would add to the flavor but actually it didn't add too much the flavor but the overall texture. Which I also have to advise, eat them as soon as you pick them otherwise they'll loose there crunch and start becoming soft. Another note, in the last two sandwiches I noticed there where a couple other ingredients featured, but they where really overwhelmed by the cheese and mushrooms, although it didn't harm the flavor at all because it could be just as delicious on there own. So I really hate to be stickler about the things mentioned above but it's something that had to be addressed. I want to believe that they are better than what I had and that was a lack of proper ingredient distribution. Come here and experience it for yourself.

striaght up --- 3.5 stars (c'mmmoooonnnnn Yelp, get with 1/2 stars already!!) 蕂verall food -- swinging ballot, 3.5-stars to 4. ambiance - 3 it's pretty much outside and tends to be crowded. service - 4.5 -- VERY friendly staff, generally pretty quick and good overall. location - 2 stars -- on a corner of a main street, with no parking on the adjacnet street except for residents. tiny lot -- -expect to do a little walking. finally swung by here while out running errands and such, to see what all the hub-bub was about. caught it a lucklily not too busy time, and dove right in. we ordered: -prosciutto and gruyere waffle sandwhich - cheesgburger waffle sandwhich -special: rueben waffle sandwhich. over all -- I'd call this "decent" eats, and its a nice little twist on the standard sanwhich offerings out there. Was it the end-all-be-all of sandwhich fare? no, not for me. of the three, I enjoyed the rueben the best. very good portions of corned beef and kraut, and not too heavy on the cheese or dressing. balanced out nicely with the waffle, which has just a touch of sweetness to it. the waffle -- ah, there's the rub. its not a BAD waffle per se, but I feel like in this setting, it's "missing" something. a little too airy/fluffy perhaps? as a sandwhich mainstay, I'd like to see it with a little more depth and CRUNCH to it, instead of soft like a potato roll. One thing I would do (as I have done on my own, when crafting wafffles in the past) is drop some flavor in those bad boys. Cheeseburger waffle sandwhich? good stuff. ....cheeseburger waffle sandwhich, with BACON (pieces) and chees waffle as the bun??? now THAT would be off the hook! the gruyere and cheese sandwhich didnt too it for me, I felt the thinner, smaller layers (of prosciutto and gruyere) where overwhlemed by the doughy, soft waffle. the cheesburger waffle was pretty decent though -- comes with tomato, what looks like romaine and mayo (I held the mayo) -- you can put mustard (have to order it -- whole grain, nice bite!) and kethcup on yourself if wanted , which I did. Overall, a good burger. good size patty but not huge, just the right amount of cheese and you can taste the meaty flavor as you should. Again, I like how the gentle sweetness of the waffle worked with the sharper ones of the meat and cheese, but it ends up getting soggy SUPER fast --- one of the reason's I'd like to see some-thing "Added" to them and somewhow get them a little crunchier. had some waffle fries as well -- pretty decent albeit a little "plain" -- would love to see them with a little spice or two in them.... didnt get the chance (too full!) to try any of the "sweet" offerings this time (nutella and banana sounded good!) �-- but will next time. I wont go out of my way or make a special trip again to get here, but if in the area would certainly drop by again if I was in the "mood"....

WHY I ATE THERE:I pass by Bruxie all the time on my way to other restaurants and always wanted to try it. There was always a long line of people ordering and I though hmm this has to really good. PLAN:Before going I looked at their menu online and was delighted to see how creative the dishes were. I wanted to order two items off the menu and after reading some very positive reviews about the "Bacon, egg, and cheddar" sandwich I chose that and the "Chicken and waffle." VERDICT: The service was great, we were greeted and the order was taken in a casual but professional manner. I just wish the food was better, I was really hoping that the food would turn me into a regular. I was disappointed. Both of my sandwiches was suprisingly BLAND. The waffles were light and crunchy but no flavor, even with the maple syrup drenched over each square. I was definitely disappointed and surprise that this place has gotten a lot of positive review. The service was great but the food was ehhhh, I wouldn't stop by again it wasn't filling either.

By far the most creative waffle joint possibly ever. I always get the chicken&waffle so great....You cant go wrong with the bacon egg and cheese bruxie either. The soda's are really great especially the strawberry and lemon lime.I asked the guy who took my order why the sodas taste so great and he said the have them specially made for them to their specifications. 蔍ts really been cold as of late and the heaters were really nice to see and feel on a cold night in the O.C. I would complain about the parking but you cant complain because its dead smack in the middle between a busy orange circle and Chapman University. Its worth finding parking in the north of the circle and walk through the circle check out the shops and get a waffle, then the walk back to your car will help you digest all that waffle greatness.

I wasn't interested in trying waffle sandwiches, but my girlfriend convinced me to go because she loved them so much! 蔠e went on a saturday night, and it was a fairly large crowd. 蔜he ambience was nice with outdoor booths and low lighting. 蔍 had the Bruxie burger wich was awesome. 蔜he waffle was light and crisp and made the perfect wrap for the burger. 蔛ince then I have gone back many times and loved the Peanut butter and jelly, and the chicken and waffles. 蔈verything has been awesome.

Hey foodies!! You know when you read about a place and it sounds great and looks great in photos but still there is a little apprehension left that keeps you from getting there? 蔉ear not at Bruxie!! I have to admit, I have a goat's palate, so most food sounds appealing and tastes good for me. However my better half has a more discriminating palate. I know if she likes something new then it must be good. Well, she was impressed. The bacon,egg waffle fold is amazing!! The waffle is the perfect texture, not too heavy and not too sweet. I had the chicken and waffle fold and it was a homerun!!! The chicken was just crispy enough and white meat was very tasty. I think the best part of the meal were the waffle fries.. They should have a huge bag for sale. I would buy them every time. I know for most, I am just preaching to choir, but I needed to share. The only drawback might be the long line that forms early and is there all day. Get there just hungry enough and not starving because you might have to wait a bit. 蔍 can't wait to go back!!!

My wife suggested the great new place. I was a bit apprehensive at first since I'm very picky about my waffles. I had the Smoked Salmon and the wife got the Buttermilk Fried Chicken & Waffle. At first I thought it would be weird to have those ingredients put together in the waffle since the only other savory waffle combo I had had was Roscoe's Chicken & Waffles, so having salmon and cream cheese on it sounded weird. Thank goodness I didn't say no to this concept because it was even better than having it on a doughy bagel. Bruxie must import their salmon from Norway because it was so good! And the waffle wasn't drowned in cream cheese. If you love salmon, this is a must have! I unfortunately didn't try the wife waffle but she would come back and try other flavors. We also brought our doggie since it is pet friendly.

Alright, so the concept for this restaurant is almost irresistible: use staple ingredients found at most high-end sandwich shops and place it in a folded belgian waffle as opposed to flat-bread or a thick kaiser roll. The result is indeed delicious. The waffle is light and fresh and adds a subtle sweetness to any sandwich. I had the burger, which was cooked medium (legitimately pink throughout) and had the basic condiments. 蔍t tasted good, and the waffle lived up to its novelty, but, at the end of the day, it really is just a novelty. 蔈ach dish is well executed, and the prices are decent, but I'm just not convinced that this place has any staying power, mostly because I'm not craving to go back and wait in a long line for a waffle-taco-sandwich. Oh well. It was a novel treat while it lasted.

It's great for the Orange Circle to have such a creative food option nearby. In fact, it's the first waffle sandwich place I've heard of for that area. That's a Pro. That's it. The Cons? Parking (and for spoiled O.C. drivers, that's a big deal) Long lines AND slow service. Miserable looking staff. All of these are problems with almost EVERY restaurant in L.A. and I will deal with in return for great food and amazing atmosphere. This place has neither! No seating to speak of and for a $7 Chicken and Waffle Sandwich I want more than 12 confetti-sized pieces of lettuce they call cole slaw. I want to actually taste the chili honey they claim was in my sandwich. I want it running down my fingers. My sandwich had two undersized pieces of chicken. Their burger was no better. Two pieces of hamburger with one sheet of lettuce layered across them. Also $7. I figured since I visited this place shortly after its Grand Opening that the portion problems were due to skimping because they didn't anticipate the long lines of interested patrons. It hasn't changed. Two stars for the off chance you might be able to get there when there isn't a crowd and somehow get someone to give you enough condiments to make your sandwiches worth eating... and for the fountain drinks. They are so good that they go too fast but NO free refills. You will want another soda but you might not want to pay another 2 bucks to get it. Also, if you're looking for creative food options it doesn't help this place that Rutabegorz is right across the street.

I've never had waffles with anything else besides syrup, fruits, and ice cream...and I thought that was good enough... I always thought that waffles with chicken or anything meaty was a strange combination... The first time coming here, there was no friggin parking so we parked a long ways from Bruxie but the walk there was pretty cool. It is located in an old town and surrounding it were old antique stores and things like that. Chapman University is just a block down. There was a pretty long line that day so I thought it was a good sign! Long line must mean good food! The seats were outdoors and there were none left by the time we got in line...but luckily a couple left so we were able to grab a seat right next to the line. I was about to order the ususal Belgium/Liege waffles but I decided to try something new for a change. I ordered the Bacon, Egg & Ceddar waffle sandwich. It was pretty good. My boyfriend ordered the Buttermilk Fried Chicken & Waffle...he let me take a bite out of his sandwich and let me tell you...it was so good...I totally had to trade sandwiches with him! LOL. OH AND THEIR FRIES! =O THEIR WAFFLE FRIES ARE TO DIE FOR! I love this place despite their limited parking. My boyfriend loved it so much he kept telling his friends about it for the rest of the day! We are definitely coming back possibly with friends :) Oh, and another good thing is that nothing on their menu was over $8!

Took the clan to some new digs last Sunday. 蔙ead all the reviews on Yelp and thought to give Bruxie's a try. 蔛o glad we did. We got a good sampling; Proscuitto/gruyere, Bruxie burger, mushroom/arugula, chicken/waffles, and nutella w/bananas. All I have to say is WOW!! 蔜he waffles are light and crisp without being too crunchy. The waffles to filling ratio is perfect and very satisfying. To pair with the sandwiches, we had the seasonal California strawberry shake and the chocolate mint shake. Both unbelievable and, to top it off, they use frozen custard in their shakes. That's legit!! 蔍 lived in Wisconsin and totally loved Bruxie's. The strawberry shake tasted fresh and decadent. We were told they macerate fresh strawberries daily for their shakes. �What I liked the most are the people working there. The staff are very helpful and very welcoming. They repeatedly checked on us to see if we enjoyed the food and experience. Even Chef Kelly, one of the owners, came out and had a nice chat with us. That attention to customers is why we'll be back again and again. Thanks to all at Bruxie. Can't wait to come back and try more. Thanks again Yelpers. Another winner.

This place is quite the treat! I've tried quite a few items and loved them all except for the chocolate shake...it wasn't that it tasted bad, it was just soooo rich I could only have a few sips and was done. It's a great spot especially for lunch, a late night snack, or a first date since it's right near the circle!

Absolutely love this place. Went to order some waffle fries with cheese and they offered me some Irish nachos (Yummy!!).The daily specials are very good. Had the wild mushroom waffle, special of the day. Prices are reasonable for the portion size of the food. Line is long but well worth the wait. Would recommend to anyone!

This place is so much fun to chill with your friends while munching on good food! It's always refreshing to find something in SoCal that's innovative and convenient at the same time. Bruxie's provides a menu and concept that is clever because it's different but makes sense, like Kogi tacos. I'm glad I got to experience that today. For starters, there will most likely be a line so come prepared to wait some time. It moves pretty fast though, especially with the executive chef walking around, answering questions and keeping you company. There is also limited seating (only outdoors) so make sure to stand by some occupied tables to get dibs, and in return not feel awkward about people standing around you waiting for you to finish your meal. At the same time, you'll be too busy enjoying your food to notice the eyes anyway. I'm glad I went with a handful of first-timers because we all got something different so we were able to try a bit of everything. I didn't try the seasonal braised short-rib waffle because I'm not a fan of bleu cheese, but my friends raved about it. The waffle burger was good noticing that the burger was cooked perfectly, but I felt like it could've used more flavoring. Another friend ordered the smoked salmon with cream cheese and dill which I also didn't try because I'm not a fan of cream cheese (heh...) but all of them said that there was a definite lack of smoked salmon in terms of flavor and substance. I ordered the chicken and waffle and was slightly disappointed. :( The chicken was very tender and perfectly cooked, but with barely any flavor. The coleslaw was too dinky and the maple syrup overpowered the sandwich. You know what could take this sandwich over the top though? Some legit gravy....MMMMM! That would've rocked my socks off...although I wasn't wearing any socks...but I guess that would only propose that it would be even better. Oh! And the nutella and banana waffle is soooo good! Forgot to mention, their waffles are delicious on there own: crispy and fluffy at the same time. This one's pretty rich so be sure to share it. I also ordered a side of waffle fries which were delicious...and for some reason I feel like the ketchup tasted slightly different too. Maybe my taste buds went awry today. Well anyway, I would definitely suggest this place to anyone, especially since it's in such a nice area. You could even take your food (if there is no seating or you just wanna be more adventurous) to the little park in the traffic circle a couple blocks down. Have fun!

Bruxie definitely lives up to the hype! I ordered the Bruxie burger and my gf ordered the Chicken waffle and we shared them. The Bruxie burger was cooked medium rare to perfection so it gives the burger more flavor. The Chicken waffle was a favorite for me. It's served with coleslaw and maple syrup inside the sandwich. The food was orgasmic. Finding parking and an area to eat was a pain though. The wait wasn't so bad as long as you get there before lunch time (noonish). The food is a bit pricey but was worth every penny. Refills cost $1 which kind of annoys me. The service however, was excellent! I will definitely be a regular here.

I'm not the biggest fan of chicken and waffles (though I do enjoy them), so when I heard that they used waffles here, I was looking forward to it, but reservedly so. Bruxie really is delicious, and far exceeded my expectations. I had the burger, which was amazing. Waffles as buns was an unexpected delight. I also had the strawberry shake, which was perfect for a summer day. Not much parking space in the lot, but there's spots around the area. Not much seating (as expected since it's stand-type eatery), though there are some tables. If you're in the immediate area, check it out ASAP. If not, it's worth a trip.

I've heard so much about Bruxie and it does not disappoint! 蔍t was very good. 蔜he combination of waffles and some of the ingredients that I wouldn't expect to taste so good actually was quite tasty! 蔍 had the salmon waffle and it was great! 蔍t felt very refreshing and healthy! 蔣ou have to also get the waffle fries which totally completes your meal! 蔜he dessert waffles are to die for! 蔜he staff was very friendly and they had a person stand outside to assist newcomers with the menu. 蔜he only downside about this place is the lack of parking and no where to sit when you're ready to eat. 蔜here are very few seats and its hard to eat this standing up. 蔜ry not to go on super popular days like the weekend because you'd never find 蔭 place to park or sit!

Yes! It's this good. Parking on the street can be tricky, some areas are by permit only. Careful. There is ALWAYS a line out front but I swear it goes fast! I love walk up experiences. This is truly a great little joint. Staff is friendly and owners are very personable. Outside seating only but there are umbrellas, misters, and heaters for weather variations. No bathrooms so go easy on the serve yourself water. My 9-yr old daughter ordered the S'mores once and I figured it would be too sweet and she'd only eat 1/2...WRONG! She shared only one small bite but with that bite my husband discovered a hint of campfire marshmallow for authenticity. No plain marshmallow fluff in there! My husband has had the chicken and waffles several times. No need for the extra side of maple syrup... It was to die for as is! He would eat one daily if we lived a smidge closer. He has ventured out once and ordered the pulled pork, too. He loved it! He's convinced he'd love anything from here :0) I went the traditional bacon, egg, and cheese on a morning visit and it did not disappoint. So light, I could have eaten two orders. We shared a seasonal strawberry shake that day and we licked the cup clean! On another visit I had the wild mushroom. OMG! That balsamic reduction and goat cheese was deeelish! Very light sandwich if your not starving. We also had a mint-chocolate shake and a frozen custard. Loved them both! This place is a quick stop but there's nothing quick about the enjoyment... The flavors linger and makes you want to come back the next day! Enjoy...

soo I've decided to update my review for Bruxie since ive been back a few more times and tried a lot more of their items off their menu first of all, im gonna say that i LOVE the service here. all the servers are soo friendly and nice. definitely another reason why i keep coming back. the food here is just as amazing. the waffles don't really taste like waffles but they go so perfectly with whatever is stuffed inside them! ive been very satisfied w/ everything i've tried here except for one item. the only thing which i would NOT recommend getting is their Liege Waffle. FOr some reason, this just didn't cut it for me. The waffle was really thick and i didn't really think there was anything special about the toppings and flavor. However, i WOULD recommend their bruxie burger, the proscuitto one, buttermilk chicken, salmon/cream cheese, cream & berries, and nutella & bananas. I like their proscuitto and cheese waffle A LOT! the meat is really tasty and the cheese they use goes so well with everything! its heaven in every bite..

this place has been on my radar since my friend yelped it a few months back http://sharen.yelp.com 蔲inally made a weekend friend date to go. pulled up, didn't realize it was counter/outdoor seating only. good thing i had my sweater. long line on the curb. 4 of us shared: [sans any maple syrup] Bacon, Egg & Cheddar [mayo on the side] - this was a food orgasm in my mouth. i can't even begin to describe the erotic feelings this wafflich gave me. just. wow. Buttermilk Chicken - seemed odd, just a large chicken breast inside a waffle. but the chili honey was perfectly blended 蕋o go w/ the chicken/waffle tastes. Creme Brule(sp?) - think this was a special wafflich, as it was written on the chalkboard at the ordering window. i had no idea this was an option but it came out w/ strawberries and creme, akin to a strawberry shortcake like dessert. i dont like strawberries, so i abstained. but my friends said it was delish. Mint Chocolate Shake - i think this was the seasonal shake (also written on the chalkboard). one sip and AAAAAAHHH!!! it seriously tasted like Thrifty's Ice Cream! the shake was huge. the bottom of the cup was lined with chocolate sauce and the shake was topped off with some whip cream. it was IN.effing.CREDIBLE. i loved it. and sadly i dont think it's there all the time. i couldn't stop raving about it. man. so good! 3 waffliches and a shake wasn't enough to make a meal for 4 ppl, but i think i'd keep this place as a tween meal place. or snack before hitting old town. definitely coming back.

Ok, Bruxie, you're good. 蔣ou're tasty. 蔣our waffles are soft and fluffy and airy and make a great sandwich covering for the savory selections. 蔣ou use great ingredients that go well together. 蔅ut I can't help feeling like you're shortchanging me a little. 蔉irst off, your waffle fries are rather generic, and don't do enough to complement the meal. 蔜hey're overpriced and ordinary and I keep wanting you to include a whole slew of real Belgian pommes frites with dipping sauces and other fancy accoutrements. 蔛econd, I keep wanting more after I'm done with you; you're a great snack, but as a meal I just want something that fills me up just a tad more. 蔍've yet to try the sweet waffles, and I most certainly will, because I want to give you another star, but I'm just holding back for now. 蔅ut I wish you well, because you show potential....

Bruxie is a tiny little shop on the corner with outside seating. They just recently added more seats in the parking lot which is a god send cause this place tends to be busy all day long. Their staple dishes are amazing. I usually get the Bruxie Burger which is just delicious. The waffle bun isn't sweet at all which I thought it would be. The ingredients are fresh and juicy. It left me full but not comatose full so it was just right. I tried my friend's Chicken and Waffle and it was just as good if not better. When I first saw it on the menu I assumed it would be a breast and waffles but it was actually a sandwich. If I had known that I probably would've opted for it cause i LOVE chicken sandwiches. They also have a seasonal menu that changes ever so often. Right now they have a Strawberry Cheesecake Sweet Waffle. So delicious! I'd go there again and get two of those!

Bruxie makes an amazing waffle. 蔈ven with all the offerings that they stuff in the waffle to make a large variety of sweet and savory waffles sandwiches, it really is one of the best waffles that I have ever had. 蔄mongst the normal selection they have daily specials of different sandwiches and seasonal shakes which are also way better than most shakes you can get anywhere else. 蔍f you like waffles and delicious things then you need to eat here. 蔍f you don't then you probably don't have a tongue.

delish doesn't even begin to explain... came here one Saturday morning after a night out drinking and it was the best thing I ever did for myself. I had the fried chicken waffle sandwich- YUM. My brother also got it but asked for no coleslaw- id suggest doing that or ordering it on the side, the coleslaw on mine gave a good texture contrast and crunch but it made the waffle slightly soggy. Also a must- the waffle fries. The chili honey on the fried chicken was PERFECT. My friends got the nutella & banana one, also delicious, and the salmon & cream cheese. I personally don't love lox & bagels, but if you're a fan, you should definitely try that one. I want to go back NOW!

I heard about this because my coworker was on TV when KCAL9 News did a story on this place. When I saw the news story, the concept completely utterly blew my mind. We had to try it. My buddy and I decided to jet down here right after work. I ordered the Fruit and Cream waffle, while my buddy ordered the Chicken and Waffle. Both were to die for. The crispiness of the waffle was perfect, and went really well with the filling. I wasn't that hungry at that moment so I opted for something sweet instead of savory. I can't wait to try their savory offerings. Owner Dean Simon was gracious enough to greet us and have a short conversation with us while we were noming down on such epic waffle goodness. Not many people have really put an emphasis on this, but the Real Sugar Sodas are very tasty! I had the lemon lime soda, and it was awesome. I paid for a refil, and she accidently filled it up with orange soda. Fortunately, it was the best damn orange soda I've ever had! This really sealed the deal for me with 5 stars already. We then tried the frozen custard. I've never had frozen custard before, and I thought this was just epic. Incredible. It was rich in the right proportions. I might just have to order it everytime I come here. I'm sure that they will improve their little processes and fine tune things to run more efficiently.. But What I'm most concerned about is being able to service huge lines of customers efficiently in such a little location they have, because I honestly think it won't be long until a cable network food show will discover this place and blow it up further.

I had the chicken & waffle sandwich w/ coleslaw and also tried the cheeseburger waffle. Both seemed to be missing something. The fried chix waffle wasnt a real piece of fried chix, it was a cutlet with just some light dusting of seasoned flour. The Cheeseburger waffle really had no flavor. The waffle itself tho was good as well as their waffle fries. I think their food could be really good if they just "tweak" their flavor/taste profiles.

After a hearty meal at Haven Gastropub, even I wasn't sure if I could manage to put away dessert. 蔋owever, I was a wo(man) with a plan, Stan, and I wasn't about to leave Old Towne Orange without trying the new kid on the block: Bruxie. �The Date Shake seemed to be a limited time only offering, so that was a must. Plus I had read so much about it on Bruxie's facebook page, so I decided to give it a whirl. 蔒y friends and I decided on the shake + the lemon cream & berries waffle. 蔜he verdict: 蕋he date shake was unbelievable. 蔜he waffle was really good; the texture was perfectly crisp yet bready, the lemon cream was wonderfully tart, and the fresh berries were the perfect touch. 蔍'll be back.

I think this was a great concept. 蔋owever the execution is a failure. 蔜he workers wondering outside spent more time talking to friends than helping customers. 蔜he people inside the kitchen screwed up several different orders.

The prosciutto and Gruyere waffle sandwich was delicious. Just a bit of mustard and chives keeps it from getting boring. The waffle itself was light and crispy and not sweet. I really wanted to try the fried chicken waffle with chili honey and coleslaw but they were out already :(. To be expected I guess on a busy first day. The line was pretty long at noon but they were getting the food out in a timely manner. They have Peets coffee and tea which I really like. The menu is quite varied with both sweet and savory waffles and I'll definitely be looking forward to trying more. Price was pretty reasonable at $6.50 for the sandwich.

I live near this place and never really had a chance to check it out. Today I stopped by and had the salmon and cucumber waffle sandwich with dill cream cheese. The texture of the waffle was so light and crispy, and it had a delicious savory flavor. The filling was fresh, but I found the flavor to be enhanced tenfold by the addition of sriracha hot sauce. This elevated the sandwich to another level. Next my friend and I shared the red bean and sweet cream dessert sandwich. The beans were creamy and sweet and the cream had a lemon-y tartness, all between that golden amazing waffle. Next on my list, goat cheese and sundried tomato or the seasonal roasted mushroom.

This place has great food! 蔍've been here many times, and I haven't tried anything that I don't like. 蔍 especially like the hamburger, which is a pretty decent sized Angus patty cut in half and served with cheese, lettuce, tomato, mayo and pickle between waffles. 蔖arking within a block of Bruxie can be found most of the time, mainly on the street. 蔜he line leading to the order window can be long at times, but usually the lines move quickly, unless it's someone's first time. 蔜he menu can be kind of intimidating, since many of the combos of ingredients are varied and lengthy for a small restaurant, so making a decision can take awhile. 蔎ust go with what your stomach is yelling for! 蔛eating is outdoors, and some of it is "protected" by plastic panels enclosing the tables and chairs; some of the other tables are protected (partly) by large patio umbrellas. 蔄ll of the employees are friendly and appear to take pride in ensuring everyone enjoys their Bruxie experience. 蔠hen your food order is ready, a food runner will bring your food to you. 蔠hen lines are really long, at times there is an employee greeting people and answering their questions about the food. 蔖rices range from reasonable to kind of pricey, but all of it is delicious! 蔣ou can count on great food and friendly employees every time you go to this Bruxie location. 蔜hey have great desserts too!

The Cheesy Bruxie with avocado and sun dried tomatoes is yummy in my tummy. The waffle was perfect and the flavor was great. Even though it was cheesy, I didn't feel my arteries clogging like with a normal grilled cheese. Jerm got the Bruxie Burger and waffle fries. The waffle fries are a bit of a let down... I had come by here previously with my derby team when we were fliering for an upcoming bout, and some of the girls decided to get a snack before practice, waffle fries was one of their choices. I seriously got so damn excited because I thought we were going to be noshing on little bite sized waffles, but alas, they were just crisscut fries like at Carl's Jr. Still tastey, just the name fools ya. Aniwhoo, Jerm liked his Bruxie Burger with bacon and we ended up splitting a delicious Strawberry Shake. The line was a bit long when we rolled up, but it moved quickly AND our food was prepared quickly, awesome. Also one of the gals that works there was mingling and greeting customers and going over the menu and the specials. Definitely a nice touch and very helpful for newbies. Oh... and while we were waiting, they were playing the Cure and the Smiths. NICE.

Located in Old Towne Orange by Chapman University. 蔉elt like I was back in college when I was eating here with my fiance. 蔋e's been raving about this place so I asked if he could take me here. I ordered the smoked salmon waffle. 蔍t was so good, I barely spoke to my fiance while eating it. 蔒y fiance said "wow you're really hungry". 蔔o it was really friggin good. 蔒y fiance ordered a vanilla creme soda. Perfect combo with my waffle. �These waffles aren't the typical American style, but the Brussels-style Belgian waffle sandwiches for those with a savory or sweet tooth. 蔜hey taste very delicate with just the right crisp to them. 蔍t's like a classy tasting waffle. 蔅ruxie produces its own proprietary yeast-leavened batter. Each waffle is about $4.50 - $7.50. �Bruxie's has an outdoor stand concept with outside casual seating so watch out for those seats while you are in line. �The owner of Bruxie came around to speak to different customers which made him more memorable because he was quite personable. 蔜here's nothing better than a good tasting restaurant with a great staff. �A must try!

Bruxie is a great potential breakfast or other location but we found it to be limiting taste and flavor wise. The waffle itself was ok but the chicken left much to be desired. The seating is limited and they did manage to lose our order which meant waiting in the cold for a solid 15+ minutes to get our order. 蔍 also concur with the other reviews in that the portions are relatively small so you could easily eat more than one. One and I certainly wasn't satisfied.

WOW. the texture was so smooth and had a slight chewy consistency, almost taffy like. it was really REALLY good. i forget where they got their frozen custard shipped from, but i swear they probably have a cow in their kitchen because this is the freshest frozen custard i have ever tasted. and i don't even like custard! .. well not that much. and a small should be enough for 2. +1 cute smiley worker -1 parking. there's only like 3 parking spots available in their lot. i parked along palm avenue, but you can only park there 30 mins max. so g'luck with that. will probably try it out again. maybe for their waffles, but def for their frozen custard. yummy B)

Cool concept, average food. Service - Nice and observant. Parking- Street so beware of permit only areas and learn how to parallel park. 蔐ot allows for four parking spots so don't bother. Price - Average. 蔄 bit pricey but the quality is much better. Takes cash/charge. Seating - Outside only so come prepared or when it's warm! Food - There wasn't a wow factor. 蔜he waffle was light and crisp but it didn't give the right texture for the dish. 蔔ext time, I'd try sweet over savory. 1. Special of the Day, Wild Mushroom, Chives, Goat Cheese and Balsamic Reduction Waffle Combo- 蔅ig chunks of mushroom, not overly rich. 2. Waffle Burger Combo - 蔒eat could use more fat for moisture and flavor. 3. Waffle Fries - Add $2 to make any meal a combo. 蔠affle fries were similar to Chick-fil-A. �Lightly and perfectly fried. 4. Lemon Lime Soda - Made with sugar cane. 蔣ou can definitely taste the difference. Refreshing and much lighter in taste.

A good friend of mine and I checked this place out and we were plesantly surprised. This place specializes in waffle sandwiches and real ice cream shakes. I had the bacon,egg, and cheddar waffle sandwich with waffle fries and they both were excellent. My friend said his strawberry shake was excellent. I thought the prices were a bit high and if I wanted to have maple syrup as a dipping sauce for my sandwich it would have been a buck extra(really guys for maple syrup?). I'll just bring my own next time. The waffle burger here looked great and I think I'll try that when I return. Good luck with parking.

if i could give half stars, this place would be an overall 3.5. if i were rating just the waffles, 5 stars. (i rounded up. im in a good mood today) first visit to bruxie, i ordered the liege waffle AND the regular belgian waffle with nutella on the side. �yum. 蔭lso got the chocolate milkshake, which was MUCH better than that stupid serendipity place in vegas and didn't cost no stinking ten bucks. my cousin got the egg creme, which i was scared to try until she told me there's not actually egg in there. 蔵t was ok, i guess. but maybe i was still getting over the initial shock of thinking there was a drink with raw egg in it. (how horribly uncultured i am) 蕀y only comment on egg creme is that the chocolate pieces are too big so your straw gets clogged and the drink doesn't come out. 蕀aybe they should invest in those superfat boba straws. second visit i tried the fried chicken and waffle sandwich and french fries, of course. 蕋he sandwich was bleh. 蔵 was unimpressed. 蕐es, the waffle goes soggy quickly, and i thought the chicken was kind of dry and bland. 蔵 didn't care for the flavored mayo or sauce they put on it, whatever it is. 蔲rench fries.... well, how could you go wrong with fries? �i guess if you go to a place known for waffles, you should stick with the waffles. 蔵 will definitely go back but only for the waffles. 蕋he waffles were an A++++ 蔯offee was pretty good too. :)

-Tried the Bruxie Burger and Prosciutto with Gruyere. �In both cases the waffle was the star (thick, crispy, airy, and tasty). However, the contents of these 蕇andwiches for me were average, especially the burger. I think the waffle is so good that it could tend to deflect your focus from the other ingredients. Neither sandwich was heavy on the stomach and cost around $7. -Actually, my favorite was the Lemon Cream & Berries dessert. Again, the waffle is the star but the cream is pretty good as well. About $6. -Overall, it's not a lot of bang for your buck and easy to get swept up in the novelty of a gourmet waffle sandwich. -Don't be surprised if you are hungry again an hour later. Depending on the size of human being you are one sandwich may feel more like snack.

I love waffles, but Bruxie takes it to another level. I consider it one of the hidden treasures of Orange County. The place is small, and the line can get ridiculously long, but its ALL is worth it. �FOOD: -Prosciutto & Gruyere: WTH is this? It's like a ham and cheese in between two waffles. At first I was skeptical about this place, but it soon became my personal favorite. It was so good that I went back in line just for seconds of this deliciousness. -Chicken & Waffles: Although the chicken was kinda dry....it was alright. Syrup is recommended to counterbalance the dryness of the chicken. Overall, the food is pretty good, and I am crazy enough to drive long distances for it. If i can change anything, I would like a parking lot since it can be painful to find one out there. Please come out to the L.A. area!

Apparently everyone were eating here, so it sounds like a good chance to review this place. i like the atmosphere. The location has it's perks if your a neighbor of the restaurant, but if your not..don't expect to find parking in the restaurant's lot. there's only 3 spaces last time i checked. the restaurant is reasonably priced, and i got the special of the day. i was Hash and Eggs. Good thing the worker suggested it because it was pretty good. It came with this really smokey sauce that i still dont know what it is, but it was pretty good. First of all, it was a waffle looking sandwich, but more like a taco. it had pastrami hash with potatoes and eggs with that amazing cheese. i saw the other stuff too, and the dessert looked bomb, so i might come back there again to try it out. Just fyi whoever reads this review, you should try the Chicken and Waffle sandwich, cause that looked amazing.

Bruxie's is an original establishment that satisfies both savory and sweet in one stop. I heard a lot about this place from foodie friends who chase down food trucks and I have to say, the location and set up of Bruxie's is reminiscent of that kind of outdoor food joint. My boyfriend and I ordered the Prosciutto & Gruy弐e and the daily special of Wild Mushrooms, Arugula & Goat Cheese with a side of waffle fries. First off, they had good intentions with seasoning the golden brown fries with salt & pepper, but they were unevenly seasoned. I would get bland ones while my boyfriend would land the heavily salted fries. They also weren't as hot or crisp as we'd expect the fries to be, so that was a little disappointing. However, this side item didn't diminish too many stars from my rating. On to the sandwiches...I expected the meat and cheese to be busting out the side of the folded waffle, so I was skeptical when I saw how flat the waffles were served. However...The Prosciutto & Gruy弐e sandwich was AMAZING! I loved the saltiness of the meat and richness of the cheese. It was simple, but tasted wonderful. This is a time when less is definitely more because anymore prosciutto would have made this sandwich gimmicky, in my opinion. The Wild Mushroom & Goat Cheese sandwich was equally delicious with its freshly sauteed mushrooms, refreshing arugula, and creamy goat cheese. My boyfriend felt like he was indulging because the sandwich tasted rich and hearty, but minus the food coma and inches to the waistline. For dessert we ordered a small sized Frozen Custard and the cinnamon & powdered sugar Brussels waffle. The custard tasted like sweet cream ice cream and was incredibly buttery, but it had the smoothness of soft serve. I liked it and found it refreshing after the warm sandwiches, but my boyfriend found it a bit too buttery for his liking. The Brussels waffles were good, but not great. It was simply dusted with cinnamon & sugar and served with a side of maple syrup. I initially wanted to order the Liege waffle, but I was told that they were sold out. I was bummed and a little skeptical about this because it was only 7pm and hellllooo, you guys sell waffles...throw some Nutella on one. This incident almost landed Bruxie's a 3-star rating from me, but the service was amazing (the server informed us that a table under the tent opened up when she was walking our food over to us on the other side of the lot). Thanks to this girl, I was reminded to only rate the food that I tried and that service does make a difference to the experience.

Food is just ok, and good luck trying to find a place to sit. �It must just be a novel place right now, because to stand in a line for 45 minutes, can't get a seat, and no bathrooms and food just ok is NOT worth it!

I had the fried chicken waffle sandwich. 蔍t was great tasting. 蔜o me it is not worth waiting a half hour for but it was a good sandwich. 蔍t was not as filling and it was priced on the 蔴igher side. 蔋owever, I am thinking that the quality of food is why it has a higher price and smaller portions. 蔊ood place to go.

I give it a meh. 蔜he service was excellent and the staff were super friendly. 蔅ut, the food just wasn't that great. 蔍 had the bacon, egg, and cheese waffle sandwich. 蔍t tasted okay but was a bit greasy and has been sitting hard all day. 蔍 also tried the Liege waffle. 蔍 actually love Liege waffles but have not found any where in the U.S. that makes them right. 蔅ruxie unfortunately missed the mark. 蔍t was a good effort but not quite what I expected. 蔍 doubt I would go back for seconds.

First time at this place, waffle sandwiches? 蔊enius! Quite a variety of choices and different combinations of ingredients. 蔍 had the fried chicken sandwich. 蔠e also tried the wild mushroom sandwich, the reuben and the (secret menu) shortrib sandwich. 蔄ll got pretty good reviews. 蔠e didn't get any sweet waffles because we would have had to get back in the line that went around the corner. 蔄nd they said this was slow for a Sunday! 蔙umor has it they are opening a store near UCI, now I don't have to go to Long Beach for Roscoe's!

Of all the times I've eaten waffles, I'd never known them to be so greasy feeling until Bruxie. 蔍 guess they really butter up those waffle machines to crank out sandwiches for the long line of customers. �Ordered the smoked salmon with dill cream cheese, one of their specials of the day which had pesto, fried egg, gruyere (if I recall correctly) and ham, waffle fries and Peet's iced tea. �I've had this bout with smoked salmon since my high school days so after a few bites I felt like I was about to upchuck what I'd gotten down. 蔄lso, the cucumber slices could have been a little thicker. 蔍 think without the salmon and, sandwiched between two regular ungreasy bread slices, the dill cream cheese and cucumbers would be simple and heavenly. �The special that we had was good. 蔍 could have done without the ham. �What can I say about the waffle fries? 蔈xcept that I love waffle-cut fries and I wish the serving size was larger. �With all my little digits ending up glazed over from the grease after the meal, I sort of wish they had a washroom instead of just a sanitizer pump.

Definitely a must try. Very tasty food and friendly staff. The only reason I dent give it five stars was the portion to price ratio. My girlfriend and I went and it ended up being $19 for two "sandwiches" and two milks and I left mildly content. I will still go back to try something different like the burger or chicken and hopefully it'll be a little more filling. Outdoor seating only and you can always expect a line. Which is always a good sign!

My mission is to try EVERYTHING that they offer. Food stuffs: Braised Beef and Shortrib Wafflewich: a MUST. This SHOULD be their signature waffle sandwich...I'm bummed that it's only a "seasonal" wafflewich. Prosciutto & Gruyere Wafflewich: First thought...wtf is proscuitto. Second thought....wtf is Gruyere. 蔇espite not having high hopes for it, I was actually very pleasantly surprised. Wild Mushroom & Arugula Wafflewich: Similar to the Prosciutto & Gruyere...didn't have high hopes, but it's almost as good as the Shortrib! Irish Nachos(wich): Oh yeah! Dessert: Lemon Cream and Berries Wafflewich...Drooooool. Custard(wich)...YEAH! Dulce de Leche Shake(wich)...HELL YEAH!!! Sadly, Meh on the following though: The Chicken and Waffle was a little to simple ... and ... I didn't care too much for the *something* Cherry Chocolate Shake. And FINALLY...Super Meh on this: The PASTRAMI Wafflewich has been eluding me...I'm 0 for 2...my mission to try it though. I'm DYING to try it. You will be mine soon, my pretty!

We ate at Bruxie this morning (Friday, 9:30 am). 蔛at outside (of course, since there is no inside seating!) with the dog. �蔅ruxie is on the site of the former Dairy Treet. 蔍 had the Prosciutto and Gruyere waffle sandwich ($6.50), with some kind of mustard spread -- very tasty. 蔒y wife had the bacon and egg cheddar �$5.50) -- she liked it but wished she'd specified the eggs to be scrambled (the default was over easy I think). 蔜he kids both had the S'mores waffles ($5.75). 蔜his was my son's second time. 蔈veryone loved the food. 蔍'd recommend they get some juices or maybe smoothies (only sodas [$1.95] and Peet's coffee now). �Looking forward to trying the frozen custard (my Wisconsin roots). 蔄 great and unique addition to Old Towne Orange. 蔖S The server brought my dog a Scooby snack -- nice touch!

What's better than a warm delicious belgain waffle sandwich with cheddar and gruyere cheese and BACON?! Not much. This is one of my favorite places right now and I can't wait to go back for more. I also had the short rib sandwich, it was good, very filling, but I probably wouldn't pick this one again.

I was super psyched to try Bruxie being a huge fan of Roscoe's Chicken and Waffles in LA. 蔈specially because so many people had said that the fried chicken and waffle sandwich was delicious, but it was a letdown IMO. The waffle isn't nearly as good as the Roscoe's waffles and there was nothing special about the seasoning on the chicken. Where Bruxie sets itself apart IMO is the sweeter concoctions like the Nutella and cream. The homemade sodas are absolutely delicious too. IMO the best thing you can get there is anything that's really sweet and decadent. Because I love Roscoe's so much, the comparison sandwich just did NOT compare. But Bruxie is an outstanding stop if you're looking for a super sweet, super rich and delicious treat. Oh and the place doesn't offer high chairs, so don't plan on bringing a baby there anytime soon.

It's exactly what people say it is: 蔄n over-priced waffle with tasty stuff in it. People who think this is life-changing, amazing or incredible, need to get out more often. 蔛eriously. 蔍t's not _that_ great. 蔍t's a waffle. But the workers there are certainly friendly, which counts for something. I'm glad I tried it, but don't plan to return.

The first time I tried Bruxie, I was disappointed. 蔄fter a month I tried it again, and it was better, but still not worth the wait nor the money. 蔍 think it's overpriced for an average tasting waffle and minimal ingredients inside. 蔍t looks like a lot of people disagree with this, judging by the lines! 蔍 think, though, once people slowly start to realize that the hype isn't worth it they'll instead go to the many other places around where even 7-8 bucks can get you something more substantial and just as tasty.

What is there to say about Bruxie? Exquisite? Lavish? None of these apply. The correct words would be: Excess, Casual, and Delicious. Definitely not saying that I did not enjoy the bomb-ass seasonal dulce de leche shake. 蔆reamy and thick, it was way too sweet for my taste. 蔍 swear it's made of heavy whipping cream. �Of course I had read prior reviews of the absence of a bathroom, when I finally got there I had to go to the restroom. Ordered the Buttermilk Chicken Waffle Sandwich, honestly one of the oddest combination of flavors (I've ever tried): sweet, salty, and sour. 蔔o idea why it works so well. Sweet: Maple Syrup & Waffle; Salty: Fried Chicken; Sour: Buttermilk & Coleslaw. 蔋onestly, in heaven. Also had a piece of the Eggs & Bacon one, not as good as the chicken but definitely just as well made. The funniest thing I noticed was the fact that they had FireCock Sauce (Sriracha) placed right next to the Cholula. 蔇efinitely sums up what Orange County was and still is, today: Lovers of Cuisine.

My friends and I were in the area, so we decided to come here for brunch. 蔍t was around 11, and there were already a decent amount of people eating outside. I ordered the Prosciutto & Gruyere, and it was quite delicious. However, the saltiness of the prosciutto somewhat overpowered the taste of the waffle (nothing a sip of water cannot solve). Even though Bruxie is listed as having no waiter service, the waiters do bring you your order so you don't have to stand waiting. I will be going back for the food and the friendly staff.

AMAZING!! I watched as this place moved in after the teriyaki joint closed. �WTH is a waffle sandwich," I wondered, "and who would want one?" 蔠ith that attitude, I amusedly watched the customers and purposefully avoided going to Bruxie. 蔜hen, curiosity got the best of me, and I checked out the reviews here on Yelp. 蔍 became more curious. 蔜hen, a classmate brought her Bruxie dinner to class. 蔍t looked so good, I had to let go of my doubt and try it. The first thing that won me over was the coffee. 蔒y vanilla latte was actually good! 蔍 don't think Starbucks is God's gift to the coffee world, but I do go there because they are generally consistent. 蔛o many other places serve nasty, weak, or old coffee that I rarely try to order it anywhere else. 蔔ow I have a new spot for caffeine emergencies! 蔜he latte was very hot, and just sweet enough (not overpowered by cheap syrup), with just enough foam. 蔣um! I ordered one of the special waffle sandwiches: roasted wild mushroom with goat cheese, greens, and balsamic glaze. 蔍 have to admit, I was in heaven! 蔍t took a little while to get because it was obviously very freshly made (and they were busy), but it was well worth the wait. 蔜he waffle was light, warm, and crispy. 蔜he filling was just enough - filled the waffle without making a mess - and had a wonderful balance of flavors so that I could taste everything. �Impressive because goat cheese can overpower a lot of other flavors.) 蔍 was left wanting more! �I did not order fries, and as tempting as the date shake was, I decided to pass. 蔍'm sure this is not exactly diet food, so I can only allow myself to splurge so much... 蔖lus, you get what you pay for, which is not cheap food. 蔉ries and a shake would probably have made it a $20 lunch.

Got the chicken fried waffle sandwich, belgian waffle, and Strawberry Creme-Bru le desert thing Overall, the food was good. However, the fried chicken has been too hyped, and the belgian waffle was a bit dry. Strawberry creme le thing was pretty good. Would give another star but the prices seem a bit high fr the quantity, especially the belgian waffle. This place is a great place for deserts (also the custard is pretty bombs) Probably on my next visit, if I am more impressed or something (try something new?) I'll give a better rating. But for now, from what I experienced the first visit, 3 stars, p[otential 4

3.5, was waffling between 3 and 4 starts. ha! yeah, I'm awesome. Anyway, went here around 9am on a rainy Saturday morning. Was met with friendly staff and delicious smells. Good first impression. Had the Fried Chicken & Waffle. I dunno, I was expecting something more... decadent, more grease, more oomph. Alas, it was a breaded chicken breast with a sweet/spicy glaze and cole slaw. Sauce and slaw were pretty tasty in their own right. But when the menu says fried chicken I want no-holds-barred-oil-mustache-inducing-greasefest. Hmm, Fried Chicken & Waffle.. I'll give you... 3 stars. Coffee!!! Peets Coffee!! great, fresh, hot, steamy. 5 stars Condiments are lacking, which I've read in other reviews and agree, is just surprising. Waffles need adornment! Even a lovely lady needs a pearl necklace now and then. Here's where I feel strange. I believe it was the owner standing right in front of the place, seemingly lording over his dominion. My bestie ordered a breakfast waffle with egg. Now, in my experience when they do NOT ask you how you want your eggs they are always fully cooked. Or at least the menu notifies you with that little asterisk *consuming raw or uncooked foods blah blee blah blooo... But 1st and foremost, this is basically a stand. More power to them, though, for cooking a delicious runny egg, but I'm saying it's not expected. Anyhoo, she's a preggo, cannot eat raw eggs. When she bit into her samich the yolk just came a running out. She LOVES yolk, but sadly, again, pregnant. The staff was nice enough when she went up to ask for a new samich but the owner/manager told her she should have specified. Hmmm, not cool dude. Again, this isn't a sit down restaurant, the menu did not specify how the eggs were cooked, and no one asked her how to cook them. Not everyone likes raw egg. Not me personally. But enough. Don't tell customers what THEY did wrong right off the bat. I've made errors at restaurants that were my fault but never have I been blamed for an error. She didn't require an apology or complained in any way, she just wanted a fully cooked egg samich. In summation, bestie loved her brekkers once it didn't threaten her fetus, I enjoyed mine despite lack of grease. Only damper was lack of saucy sauces and syrups and a somewhat strange owner/manager.

At the end of this quaint, little, offbeat neighborhood you will find Bruxie, stationed on the side of the road. 蔍t is a small shack-like restaurant with cafeteria style bench seating but it all works so well. 蔜here isn't too much parking but come on a weekday during lunch and you'll be fine. 蔜he seasonal waffle options are spot on and refreshing. 蔍 got the wild mushroom with goat cheese, arugula, and balsamic. 蔍 was concerned that the waffles would be sweet, thick, fluffy breakfast waffles but they're not!(Don't get me wrong, I LOVE my breakfast waffles but I didn't want it to take away from all the ingredients inside my sandwich.) 蔜hey are light and slightly crispy. 蔜he waffle fries are amazing! 蔄ll fried in peanut oil; almost fools you into thinking they're healthy. 蔍 haven't tried any dessert waffles at this joint but I will definitely be back! 蔆ustomer service is great. Tables and surroundings, clean. 蔖rice is budget friendly. �After lunch, enjoy a beautiful stroll through town to the fountain at the town circle.

Suffering the rain to speak with his customers, owner Kelly told me about how he crafted his one-of-a-kind waffle sandwiches while on an Asian food tour. The waffle mix is light and crispy, unlike traditional thick, doughy versions. The most popular waffle is with buttermilk fried chicken, but the other creations seemed like perfect pairings of flavors. True to the diner feel, he also offers shakes, custards, and sundaes in addition to sweet waffle creations. He also makes his own soda mixes using real cane sugar instead of corn syrup and to top it off, he serves Peets gourmet coffee! The only problem with this place is coming alone - I want to try it all!

Love this place! I come here at least once a week. I have tried the fried chicken and waffle, the bruxie burger, the lemon and berries, and the creme brulee bruxie. All super good! Don't expect roscoes when you get here because it is bruxie waffle sandwhiches and if u expect roscoes try something else besides the fried chicken. 蔜he owners are always around and they are super nice and always ask how we liked it. Such a great idea that is perfectly executed!

We eat here almost every week! 蔜he fried chicken waffle is amazing but if you want something lighter, go for the smoked salmon. 蔍 pretty much order it every time. �And I don't think anything is over $8 or $9. 蔄lso, it's usually always packed so getting a seat can be difficult. �蔜his place is a gem.

I came here with a bunch of friends. Overall, the atmosphere was fun. We conversed with the owner for a bit, everyone was welcoming and warm. I had the prosciutto waffle and thought it was salty and okay. Two friends had the buttermilk chicken waffle and thought theirs was tasty so perhaps it was just what I ordered.

Went last week to check this place out and I' so glad I did. Based on everyone's reviews, I ordered the Buttermilk Chicken Waffle + a side of syrup + waffle fries = yum! Food: 5 STARS - The waffle isn't your typical waffle. It's extremely light and it's NOT as sweet as you think. It just tastes like a really good piece of bread. The slaw + chicken inside of my waffle combined with hot sauce & some syrup was DELICIOUS! You HAVE to try this waffle when you're here. The fries were well seasoned and were cooked to perfection. Service: 5 STARS - We had to wait about 10 minutes in line since it was long (even though it was past 1PM) which I didn't mind since we all know that if there's a long line, it must be good! The owner came out and chatted with us and everyone else in line. He asked us if we had any questions and helped us in the ordering process. He also brought our order to our table. Price: 3 STARS - My waffle + fries + a side of syrup = a little over $10 bucks. A drink would of taken that price to $13+. I wish it was a little cheaper since it was supposed to be a quick lunch. Tip: Parking is limited and you'll have to have a parking permit to park in the neighborhood surrounding the store. They also have limited outside seating however the seats do turnover quickly. If you haven't tried this place out, definitely go!

I love Bruxie so everytime I go there I try something new. Their bruxie burger is by far my favorite, but the smoked salmon was pretty tasty. I also enjoy the strawberry crem brulee waffle. My bf and I got the smores waffle, I wasn't a fan. The strawberry shake is a must ! It has small chunks of strawberries, it tastes amazingly fresh! My only complaint is that the fries are only given in a tiny portion.

One word of advice: 蔱at the waffle sandwich immediately. 蔍t took all of 5 minutes for the waffle to turn from the light, airy, crispy goodness that everyone talks about into a limp, chewy afterthought. 蔍 ordered the chicken and waffle, proscuitto with gruyere, and the liege to go. 蔜he sandwiches did not survive the car ride. When I did eat them 蕋he flavor was great and but i couldn't get past the lack of texture. 蔍T WAS MY BAD. 蔜he liege made it out alive and it was everything i thought it would be. 蔍t would have been nice to have a little bit more Nutella on the side tho. �蔍 will definitely go back and try Bruxie again. One thing that I did eat immediately upon receipt was the frozen custard. 蔒MMMMM. 蔞ery creamy and smooth. Can't wait to try the shakes made with this custard.

Good for what it is--tasty, unhealthy food served in a fun, novel way. 蔛ervice was quick and friendly. 蔠e each had a fried chicken sandwich and then shared a lemon berry sandwich. 蔠e wish that we would have shared a fried chicken sandwich and then each got our own desert sandwich. 蔜he chicken was hot and spiced nicely. 蔜he waffles were cold. 蔛till, it was a pleasant meal with good food. 蔍 would recomend that 1 side of syrup is plenty for 2-3 people.

Just came back from our second visit to Bruxie (in a span of 5 days). 蔐ast time got the chicken waffle. 蔜his time got the lemon cream & berry. 蔅oth times got the bacon, egg & cheddar. 蔠ifey and I are now big fans of the latter two. 蔜he lemon cream & berry is light, tarty, and not too sweet. 蔜he softness of the cream and the juiciness of the fruit strike a perfect balance of textures with the waffle slices that surround them, which themselves achieve just the right balance between chewy and crispy. 蔅ut beware all you voracious eaters out there (like me), take your time with each bite lest you knick the corner of your mouth on a crispy edge of waffle like I just did. �It's hard to help it when you're holding food this good.) �Finally, in terms of service, both times we got really friendly cashier's. 蔄nd despite how small the lot is, when your food is ready at the counter only 5 feet away from you, a server still graces you with delivery to your table, or in my case today, your car, despite being parked behind the building. 蔍 admit my order took a little while last time, but because of this impressive act of service and because the order was done in less than 5 minutes this time, I rounded my 4 stars up to 5.

Very cool concept. Waffle as a sandwich. Whodathunkit. 蔜ried the not-so-traditional chicken and waffle with chili honey and coleslaw. Very moist and tender. Homemade batter made for a light, yet crunchy waffle. This is the perfect spot for the Old Towne Orange college crowd or local business folk. Note that it is a outdoor, walk up restaurant.Check it out, very yummy. Going to try the 1/3 lb waffle burger with Gruyere next time I'm there.

Ok first off I want to say thanks to Kelly and the rest of the staff they are just amazing. 蔜his place is like strapping a bomb to your head and blowing your mind. Try the beef short and be prepared to smile uncontrollably. It's that good. Nadia's creme brulee is rediculously delicious. Me and my buddy Phil are calling it: we had the first taste. The creme was great and you can totally tell that they really took a blowtorch to the top before they folded it. 蔆hicken and waffles was amazing. 蔜he waffles were crisp but didn't tear up your gums or the roof of your mouth.

Dont believe the hype! Spent $25 for chicken & waffles, mushroom/ sundried tomato special, waffle fries, and strawberry shake. It was good but not $25 worth. Portions are small, appetizer size small! Spent an extra $1 for syrup..mistake. The chili honey that chicken came with was good enough. Gotta say though, the strawberry shake (made with custard) was the only thing I can rave about. Not too sweet, just right. If you gotta try it for yourself, go for it. But probably won't be coming back. Parking sucks, and not enough places to sit. But I guess that comes with the territory. Service was cool. A for effort, Bruxie.

I found out about this place from a friend of mine. I thought to myself, waffle sandwiches eh? That definitely sounds interesting so sign me up! I came here on a Friday night with a friend and her family. You place your order at the window and your name gets called out when its ready. It reminded of those old school ice cream or burger stands. One of the staff asked me if I had any questions on the menu and naturally I asked what she recommended. For entrees: Bruxie burger, salmon & cream cheese. For desserts: lemon cream & berries, s'mores, and the frozen custard. I ended up ordering the Bruxie burger, waffle fries, and a vanilla cream soda. The burger ended up being average. Just two Angus patties and your standard burger ingredients (mayo, lettuce, etc.). The waffle fries were good but 2-3 bucks is pretty expensive for fries. The vanilla cream soda was awesome and like the rest of their sodas made with pure cane sugar. It may just be me but I didn't find the portions to be too terribly filling so I ended up going for dessert as well. I ordered the lemon cream & berries which was great. It wasn't too terribly busy as I had expected and it was around 8PM. Service was a bit slow but I figure its their first few weeks so they're still getting used to it all. Staff is nice, helpful, and they'll bring your food out to your table. I don't recall much parking on-site so head to the streets. I will definitely be back to try out more of their selection!

I enjoy saying the name "Bruxie" but the quality of the waffles is just "OK." You have to eat their waffles right away, unless you prefer to eat soggy waffles. 蔜he wait for the food was a little too long, and I hope their hire some more workers soon to speed up the process.

This little waffle joint is comprised of a modest stand where you order food and limited outdoor seating in Old Town Orange. Don't let the size of this place fool you. The waffle sandwiches are just PERFECT. 1. Short ribs: This is seasonal item is simply amazing. The waffles are perfectly cooked... crispy on the outer layer... with just the right softer consistency in the middle. The meat is so tender and well-marinated that it makes my mouth water just thinking about it. Trust me, if you can, you MUST TRY THIS ONE! 2. Wild mushrooms: Another seasonal special, this dish is also pretty amazing... with a splash of arugula and delicious cheese. 3. Buttermilk chicken: While this sandwich was tasty, the chicken is not as tender as I'd like it to be. The maples syrup adds a nice touch to this waffle. 4. Smores: I shared this dessert waffle. If you like smores, I'm certain you'll love this waffle. It is, however, VERY sweet... ^_^

You can't go wrong with the prosciutto & greiner or the lemon with blackberries. Shitty parking, great food & great customer service. The change their berries seasonally so the blackberries must be requested or else you get strawberries (which isn't that good with the lemon cream....). Really high in calories but very delicious

I really wanted to be blown away by this place, just like all the other reviewers seem to be. I mean, I've been hearing about their waffle sandwiches for the past couple of months and I drove about half an hour to finally give it a try... however, I have to say that my reaction to their waffles was at best, anti-climatic. My husband got the Bruxie Burger while I tried their Strawberry Creme Brulee Waffles. We kept switching sandwiches between one another because after a couple of bites of mine, I found it to be way too sweet and needed something savory, and I'm sure he felt the same way about his being too salty. Neither of us could finish our sandwiches and packed two halves to go. Their waffle fries are nothing special either, and after our meal (though unfinished) we just felt like it was way too heavy on our stomaches to eat. Unless you're a waffle lover, I don't know how you would choose the Bruxie Burger over In & Out or any of their waffle sandwiches over regular sandwiches. That being said, I think their dessert waffles made more sense and are actually something I might come back to try more of. Oh, that and their strawberry lemonade. You gotta try it.

Cute little place. I went here because I heard about it from a friend and wanted a different take and place for chicken and waffles from the typical Roscoes. I did not know that it was a small restaurant but found it cute. It is right by the hustle and bustle of Orange Circle but far enough away that it is not a war zone looking for parking. I got the chicken and waffle and the nutella and banana as my dessert. I was pleasantly surprised when I found out the chicken and waffle came out as a sandwich. They use white meat and it was not at all dry, which I was expecting from a thinly sliced piece of breaded chicken. The flavor was different from Roscoes since I usually get dark meat from them but I still enjoyed it very much. I did not get the slow, bloated feeling I usually get from Roscoes and I had room for dessert still. The nutella and banana was nothing extraordinary but who does not love nutella? No matter what it's delicious and makes anything it goes on good. Bruxie is a great place for a quick bite, not so much for a big group but great for your tummy.

My first time trying "chicken and waffles". 蔍 really wasn't expecting all that much. 蔍 was thinking really sweet, and probably really greasy for the chicken and waffles. 蔜he waffles were in fact really really delightful (yes I said delightful) and the chicken was super tender and juicy with the right amount of crisp. 蔜he pure maple syrup was definitely the perfect complement. 蔍 really didn't think it'd be that good, but it was amazing. 蔜ina C had the smoked salmon and dill, which was really good as well. 蔄gain, you don't expect the waffle to be all that great a complement, but they worked so well together. 蔞ery laid back vibe with the outdoor seating and picnic table. 蔋as that feeling of an ice cream stand from back in the day. 蔍 also had a creamsicle float which was very good. 蔠ill definitely be back to try the rest of the menu. 蔈xecutive chef was also walking around and mingling with the crowd, which is always a nice touch. 蔆ool vibe in an interesting part of town.

Came back for a quick and (what was supposed to be) light lunch with the bf on the way back to my house. Even though I'd seriously loved the salmon last time, I decided to try something new and go with the prosciutto & gruyere. Bf got the special of the day, short ribs. His was definitely NOT light -- and I can't believe I'm saying this, but it was honestly TOO much meat! In any other case, it would've been great, but for this kind of sandwich, it was far too heavy and dominating. You couldn't really taste the waffle or any of the other flavors, like the potato with goat cheese and horseradish, which sounded delicious and were part of the reason we picked that one! My prosciutto was much yummier and lighter, so I'm thinking that's the type of sandwich I like here on the waffles - light but really great flavors. The salmon still is my absolute favorite (it was just so fresh and yummy), and you can't go wrong with a side of the waffle fries.

Upon arriving at Bruxie I was surprised to learn that it was quite a small stand and not a restaurant setting. With that said parking and seating is quite limited. I have come back at various times of the day but it seems as if they are ALWAY busy and there's always a line. Don't let the long line intimidate you because it moves a lot quicker than you think! The menu consists of gourmet waffle sandwiches and speaking from a non waffle believer, it was extraordinary! They have a really good menu including waffle burgers, waffles with mushrooms and arugula (swoons). Something called a green eggs and ham waffles thats made with pesto! With so many interesting choices I have never been able to leave without the classic buttermilk and fried chicken waffle, a MUST TRY. Chocolate and strawberry shakes also great! Although the shakes were huge so split it? Portion size for the waffles were good and plenty and you can't ask for better prices! You can really taste the quality they put into everything. What really surprises me is the great service they provided. every single person was super friendly and attentive even though it gets crazy busy. They also have a self service station for condiments and water which I really appreciated. Thanks Bruxie! :D

I've had just about every sandwich so far and they're all great. 蔜hey also have seasonal sandwiches like the beef brisket in a waffle. 蔄mazing. �I think the only problem is that they'll have to expand pretty soon. 蔛eating is a bit of an issue but a petty one at that. �They very well may take over the world.

Fun food shack. Prosciutto was unexpectedly greasy. 蔖rice was kinda not too budget friendly for what your're getting. 3 bucks for a side of six waffle fries? and I even counted the half piece. 蔜otal wait time during lunch hour is about 25 mins. I would definitely come back but just not very often.

This was sooo good! The prices were reasonable, the food was outstanding (I had the bacon and egg one and my mom had the lemon cream one). But the most impressive thing was that the owner was standing outside in his chef's whites recommending food to get and delivering food to the tables. Parking was a bit confusing, but hey it's near Chapman college, parking is always a hastle. Seating wasn't too bad either, by the time I ordered people had finished their food. No one stays for that long, but everyone is satisfied. Will DEFINITELY return with friends, acquaintances and people that I slightly dislike :)

Gourmet waffle sandwich?! Genius idea. �Got there and the chef/owner was outside greeting people and was bringing food out for customers. 蔜echnically, they call your name and you pick up your own food, so it was nice to have the chef/owner bring it to you. 蔜here's only outside seating and it can probably only seat about 20 people, so I wouldn't recommend going there when it's freezing cold or raining. Luckily we got a table but it was in front and we felt like were at the zoo having people look at us and what we were eating. BURGER WAFFLE:: it was delicious but the waffle itself did get soggy but what do you expect? It's going to happen away. SUN-DRIED TOMATO W/ GOAT CHEESE:: 蔜he first couple of bites was good but after while all I started to taste was just the goat cheese. 蔍t would be better if there was like ham in it or something. LEMON CREAM & BERRIES:: soo good. 蔜he lemon cream didn't make the waffle soggy at all so every bite had a nice airy crunch. The lemon cream wasn't too tarty or crazy sweet at all. Overall, I'd come back again. 蔅ad thing, wish there more places to seat or indoor seating. 蔛treet parking is also horrible but there is a parking lot that you can park for free that is about a block away.

I give Bruxie 3 stars. One for the friendly customer service, and 2 more for the delicious chocolate covered banana shake I ordered. My better half and our 3 kids each ordered something different. I took turns trying each of their waffle sandwiches. I ordered the chicken and waffle. This does not hold a candle to Roscoes. It was a deep fried chicken nugget wrapped in a waffle with cabbage. No sauce or anything to bring it all together and a tiny container of syrup is $1.00 extra. WTH? Since when do you have to pay for syrup when you order a waffle? Next I sampled the berries and creme waffle, it was just eh. I tried the prociutto and gruyere, it was different. Seemed a little rich to eat an entire sandwich of this though. I didn't sample the burger but I'm pretty sure it tasted like a burger. All in all it's a good idea but it falls a little short of the hype. If you want a great shake come here. That's all I have to say about that. Oh and parking is an issue, so is seating.

Bruxie is a cute little place located in old town Orange. My husband and I have only been here twice. The place looked very clean which scores major points for me :) There is usually a line that forms down the street but it moves pretty fast especially since the staff and sometimes the owner comes out and talks to the customers waiting in line. They have EXCELLENT customer service. The first time we came here, I ordered a fried chicken and waffle, out of curiosity, and I enjoyed it. It was my first chicken and waffle so I don't really have anything to compare it to but it was pretty good. They have amazing pure cane sodas made from their own ingredients. I don't drink sodas and I found myself stealing their version of Cola from my husband. The second time we came, I had the green eggs and ham waffle. 蔜he pesto really pops out and it was a good filling lunch. My husband had their Bruxie burger which is also good. I do believe its their waffles that really make the food. It's an unexpected but pleasant combination with the juicy meat and light, fluffy waffles as "buns." I highly recommend their pure cane sodas, the vanilla creme soda is very good. However, we were not big fans of this drink they have, called mad cow or something like that. It is basically their version of a root beer float. The whole inside of the glass is coated with chocolate then, you have the root beer and on top is their very own frozen custard. It was recommended to us and to my husband's dismay...this super sweet drink didn't go well with his Bruxie Burger so don't order it with the burger, it might be good on its own depending on your taste but we really didn't enjoy it. Overall, we would definitely go back to try some of the other things they have on their menu and also because they have such good customer service :)

Three stars is being nice because they had such friendly customer service. Other than that, this place is too overhyped for such average joe tasting waffles. Looking at pictures the waffles look delicious and crispy on the outside but alas, they are not. Had the buttermilk chicken w/ coleslaw, but sans syrup b/c I figured it would be too sweet. Also ordered the strawberry cheesecake for dessert. I got a large piece of chicken in my waffle, whereas my friend's piece was probably about 3/4's it... Anyways, for starters the waffle was wayyy too soggy. It was practically mushed covered chicken, except for one side. The waffle didn't have any special flavor to it. Could've been an Eggo waffle... Figured it was a "gourmet waffle" place so the waffles would taste SOMEWHAT special... Guess not. The chicken was good... A bit dry, and there was not enough sauce to compliment it, aka, I couldn't really taste the sauce. Cole slaw was also plain, it was basically cabbage w/ no flavor. Overall for the chicken, I'd give it a D. And now for the strawberry cheesecake... I was honestly a bit too blah'd about the chicken to carefully indulge in the strawberry one and REALLY think about the flavors... However, it was decent. Waffle wasn't soggy and there were fresh strawberries and crunchy crushed graham crackers. I almost feel bad for the less than ok review b/c the service was so great. Guess it has to make up for the craptastic parking and less than great waffle. Maybe I'll come back and try the prosciutto one, feel like they deserve a second chance and maybe another review.

Whoever thought of waffle sandwiches/burgers is a genius! The very first time I came to Bruxie I had the smoked salmon waffle and thought it tasted rather good nor bad. The dill cream that was in the waffle and smoked salmon was a little bit too much for me. It tasted appetizing, don't get me wrong but I felt as though I was eating sour cream or mayo by itself with every bite I took. I wasn't able to taste much of the smoked salmon, which was a bit disappointing. My bf ordered the buttermilk chicken waffle with maple syrup and his order was surprisingly pretty good. However, I still personally like Roscoe's chicken and waffles more. The second time I went to Bruxie was a few days ago and I decided to try something new from their menu. I ended up trying the Bruxie burger...wow, was it good! My very first bite of the burger felt like an orgasm in my mouth! Mmmmm ahhhhhh I LOVE IT! I think I'll stick to ordering their waffle burger from now on. For my next visit I'm most likely going to try their dessert waffles. Does anyone have any recommendations from their dessert menu? =)

bruxie burger= thumbs down, chicken & waffle=slight thumbs up, lemon cream & berries= slight thumbs up. i really didnt see the hype with this place, nothing special at all in my opinion. well, maybe for the long line. burger was bland and seemed to be missing a lot. the fried chicken was better than the burger, but not my much.

Today was my second Bruxie visit. I held off on reviewing until now since I thought maybe I had just missed something the first time around. My first visit was shortly after its opening. I saw an article about a waffle sandwich place opening in Orange and I knew I had to visit. I ordered the Nutella & Banana waffle with admittedly high expectations. I love waffles as well as the combination of bananas and Nutella. I have had AMAZING banana & Nutella crepes before so I thought this combination on a waffle should work out splendidly. Unfortunately, Bruxie's waffle rendition was far below what I had come to expect from its French counterpart. The waffle seemed too thick and did not have much of a taste to it. The proven filling combination seemed to be overpowered by a sub-par waffle. Overall, my first experience left me disappointed as I had such high expectations for Bruxie. After my first visit, I assumed the crowds would start to die down once everyone tried it out. But, I was wrong. Every time I would pass by, the lines were LONG. Seeing this, I started to think that either my expectations were too high for the B&N waffle or that they had improved the actual waffle so I decided to give Bruxie another shot. This time around I decided to order the Bruxie Burger. I figured I would try something off the savory side of the menu this time since I had heard some good things. The patty itself was a good size and cooked very nicely so that there was a little bit of pink left. Overall, it was juicy, but slightly lacking in flavor. The lettuce and tomato were both very fresh and crisp. It also included pickles and mayo. However, once again the waffle stood out, and not in a good way. It was still flavorless and seemed to add nothing to the burger. Thankfully, the burger was a good size and all of the fillings were fresh, quality ingredients so the dryness of the waffle was less noticeable this time. I also ordered the waffle fries which were tasty, but a little over salted for my preferences. Overall, I love waffles and I love the idea of waffle sandwiches so I want to love Bruxie. Unfortunately, the Bruxie waffle itself seems to disappoint. It either needs to be more flavorful (maybe use a hybrid cake/waffle mix?), thinner, or some combination of those two things. As it stands, the blandness and dryness of the waffle overpowers the fresh, tasty fillings inside.

here's the thing...i agree with some of the good reviews, and also with some of the bad. 蔮ut my take on the whole place is this: -the food is good, but not amazing -the price range isn't terrible, but definitely could be lower -it's saving grace could be that it's a quick stand where you can grab your food and go...but the place isn't built for crowds, so it takes forever! that being said, i can't really give it more than 2 stars. 蔵f any one of those three categories impressed me, i'd be much more willing to go back. 蔮ut as it is, i don't have too much of a hankering to return to bruxie. bottom line: great concept, great location...not the greatest execution.

I was happy. Boyfriend was not. So I made my 2nd trip to Bruxie (since their first day and getting a ticket and whatnot; read my review, its at the bottom of the list) They had short ribs which I really wanted to try. So I went with my boyfriend and of course, everyone is very nice and courteous, and helpful. We got our order, and were happy and all and got in the car and left, when we realized there were NO FRIES! OH NO! Ok so we turned around, and they were really nice about everything (gave me a free strawberry shake; out of this world.) I was quite appeased. When we got to my house though, the waffles, which would still have been crispy if we went straight there instead of having to wait for fries to fry, were soggy. You know when you're a kid and you're being taught about directions and they teach you the whole Nobody Eats Soggy Waffles. Well, we did that night. My boyfriend was upset that they forgot his maple syrup (at an extra �1 he was ticked) Luckily, I had a fat bottle of the sweet stuff at home. The short ribs were not quite as good as I had expected, but still good. The nutella and banana was divine. I'll jsut check my order better next time, and perhaps eat there.

Food was good, service was VERY fast, and the staff was super friendly. But $7 for a hamburger just because it has a waffle instead of a bun is way over-priced. 蔜here is usually a VERY long line of college students in the order line, and a severe shortage of tables means a wait just to sit down. 蔍 probably won't be back.

the fried chicken in a waffle is the stuff of legends. thin, crispy chicken breast cooked just right is mighty delicious, but 1 out of 5 friends mentioned she got a soggy one. sadness, but even these guys are entitled to an off day. a worthy substitute if you're not in the mood for the burger.

I really didn't know what to expect when we decided to give this place a try. 蔄ll I've been hearing is that their waffle sandwiches are amazing... A few people warned me about lines, but we went between lunch and dinner, luckily there wasn't a line (SCORE). While I was reviewing the menu, there was a nice man in a chef uniform outside greeting the diners and making sure everybody was happy. 蔋e was very helpful and super nice, turns out he was the owner and was so pleased and grateful for the turnout and the rave reviews. 蔠e decided to try the Prosciutto and Gruyere sandwich and WOW! I'm so glad we did! This is my new favorite sandwich! 蔜he waffle is cooked perfectly to fold, the taste is great, and the sandwich doesn't fall apart. 蔜he service here was excellent, considering they just opened, and there was nothing wrong with our first visit to Bruxie. 蔜his place is one of a kind and very unique. 蔍'm definitely coming back to try the rest of the menu.

I read about this place in AAA monthly magazine. 蔍 thought why not, it's nearby, I love waffles, I'll keep this on my to do list. 蔛o a friend calls to meet up for lunch. 蔖arking is not very friendly because of the university across the street. 蔍f you choose to park on the streets, be careful because some streets are parking permit only. 蔜he line wasn't very long, but it would make me nervous if I were to come here on my lunch break (don't forget the time it takes to find parking!). 蔜he folks there are incredibly friendly. 蔠e were asked if we had ever been there before and if we had any questions.

The waffle was light and warm. 蔜he chicken was soft, flavorful, and not heavy at all! The savory and sweet waffles are DELICIOUS! We split the boysenberry sweet waffle and that's my only regret. 蔎ust when you think you're full, YOU NEED YOUR OWN sweet waffle.

i came here cuz my roomate told me about it, i had the chicken n waffle, cuz she told me it was better than roscoes, but i wudnt compare it in the same way thought its both chicken n waffle. i found it kinda dry, but thats just me, ialso had the smoke salmon cuz it was a hot day, n it was recommended by a server. it wasnt really my taste, why did i give it a 4 star? because i love creme brulee, and i had their seasonal, strawberry creme brulee sandwich, it was delicioussssss!! it was so good that it alone deserves a four stars, it wud have been a 5 if it werent for the other two. i really like jamba juice's waffle, if anyone else has ever tried it, though it sounds random, its realy good, so i m down to try it frm here, their leige waffle, that is supposed to be even better! but i m hoping it is! since they have a family recipe and everything. but i hope its amazing

After reading about Bruxie on yelp, I decided it would be worth a try. 蔍 ordered the Buttermilk Fried Chicken & Waffle. 蔍t tasted good, but it was barely warm. 蔉or the full experience I added the maple syrup for an extra $1.00, and when I saw the amount of syrup supplied I thought, a dollar for this, what a rip. 蔜here are many other interesting things on the menu, so I would try it again and hope for the best.

I love this place. 蔜he challenge is to not come when everyone else is there. 蔐ike on a Sunday late-morning, I've seen the line extend a few hundred feet down Glassell. 蔍t's basically a food stand--they took over this tiny shack of a take-out place called Dairy Treat and created a unique waffle sandwich take-out. 蔊reat selection of savory and sweet offerings. 蔜heir specials are usually very good. 蔒y favorites include their smoke salmon and dill cream cheese sandwich, their hamburger, and they have some really good dessert waffles. 蔍 recommend getting one savory and one sweet--if it's just a couple of you, you can split the waffles and get that savory/sweet combo. 蔜heir waffle fries are good. Their seating area is improved over the months, and they have these neat gas heaters in the patio section off the parking lot. FYI: beverages are NOT free refills ($1 for a refill) and then tend to put a lot of ice in their cups. So unless you want a cup with effectively 6 ounces of soda, tell them to go easy on the ice. 蔕therwise, enjoy.

My family and I went to this place with friends because one of our buddies works here. 蔜he food and the atmosphere were completey different from what I expected. 蔍t is a walk up place and you sit outside near the amazing downtown Orange scene, near Chapman. 蔜he atmosphere is great and the food is pretty good. 蔍 ordered the burger, which was good; I would however add more condiments only because the waffle was a little dry, but overall it was good and different, which is always fun to have. 蔒y wife ordered there chicken sandwich and I was able to sneak some bites in...it too was surprisingly good! 蔜he flavor and spicyness of the chicken was a nice mix with the waffle. 蔄lso, they have really good fries. 蔛o if you are looking for a quick and different bite to eat, Iw would recommend this place and after you are done eating, enjoy the downtown area and get yourself a beer or some ice-cream.

I had high hopes after reading the review but was a bit disappointed. 蔋ad the Cheesy Bruxie with bacon and tomato. 蔜he waffle was light and fluffy and the ingredients were very fresh tasting but the sandwich had no POP. 蔍t was just a glorified grilled cheese for $7.00. 蔜hey deserve 2.5 stars but not three. 蔍 need to go back and try some other sandwiches and a sweet waffle too.

Had a bad visit that perhaps doomed my experience here. Not to say the place isn't good, but there are stipulations to enjoying the place that should be addressed. The wait actually isn't awful and there was a nice girl to discuss with everyone the menu choices-- she was genuinely interested in making sure that people had a pleasant experience. After finally making it to the window, I briefly scanned the menu and made my choices, intending to sample a small chunk of the available offerings: Bruxie Burger, Prosciutto and Gruyere, Buttermilk Fried Chicken, Nutella and Banana, Baco, Egg and Cheddar. After I placed my order, I waited. And waited. Soon it was clear that they had skipped me. After some conferring, it was obvious that they had given away my order to someone else. They give out orders by numbers/names and apparently someone had taken mine. Moments later a woman returned, a large bag in hand, claiming that what she had wasn't her order. The worker glanced at the contents and handed it off to me. I stared incredulously at him. My name is so masculine that perhaps the only more male sounding names are limited to a select few: "Max Power" springs to mind. But that was it. No apologies, no comments about how my meal, in that time span, had died. Nothing. I mostly don't fuss about bad service, but here's the problem-- Bruxie's waffles have a half life of about 4 minutes. The waffle and all its deliciousness disintegrates like a dream and the minutes start ticking as soon as they're put into your brown paper bag. The mixup had taken probably 5 minutes and it was more time to walk back to my car so I could eat in peace. As you can guess, the end result of everything is I got essentially cheated out of having Bruxie at its full culinary power. A soft waffle dooms the entire sandwich for one main reason: the waffles here are unseasoned and thus become a flavorless vehicle that, without its texture, are even worse than any sort of bread that would be paired with the fillings because it literally becomes nothing but a distracting presence. It's sort of a starchy, tasteless mess that actually cuts too much into the flavors of its contents so they no longer shine as they should. I saved some of my meal to try and resurrect in the oven just to see if it was possible, but it was a failure. This is the greatest weakness of Bruxie that MUST be noted, and unfortunately I got the short end of the stick on my visit. And I really did catch a few glimpses of what made this place so loved, which was all the more upsetting. -Bacon and Egg and Cheddar was flavored well but unsurprising and slightly saltier than I would have liked. -They dropped the ball on my Prosciutto and Gruyere. It wasn't even close to being remotely as mind-blowing as many people here seem to attest and I do think maybe I just got a dud. But what I did get was overpowering saltiness from the prosciutto-- I am a sodium loving fiend but this was just too much for my palate. This waffle was soggy and slightly grainy from the mustard, which left an unpleasant mouth texture. -The Bruxie Burger's contents were amazing because it's done right-- the melted cheese has enough presence to really add bite to the chewy, flavorful burger patty. This one was one of the many that had already had a soft waffle cradling its contents and it did dampen the experience some, but I could sense that normally the Bruxie Burger would have been quite delicious. -You can't mess up Nutella and Banana and they don't here either: it's a sinful, messy chocolate experience that was shoved down my greedy maw in moments, soggy waffle and all. This was a case where I didn't feel the soggy waffle really detracted anything and everything still tasted good, but as I said, it's very hard to mess up this particular combo. -The Buttermilk Fried Chicken was weird. This was actually the first sandwich that I ate so the waffle still had some semblance of integrity-- there was still a slight crispiness to the waffle. Chicken was moist and tasted great. But I felt 蕋he problem here is that the the crispiness of the chicken actually overwhelms the waffle, so the waffle doesn't really have presence. I really gave it some thought, in terms of why a chicken and waffle combo, with ingredients separate on a plate, was better than this particular combo, and it soon hit me. Bruxie's waffle in fact hurts this particular sandwich because there isn't enough presence for the waffle to stand up to the hot oil and chili/honey sauce (which was quite fruity, surprisingly)-- the yeast-batter waffle is just too airy and thin to bring anything to the party. The chicken portion is big enough that the slaw (very mild) doesn't cut through so there is no balance: if the waffle had any presence, things could very well have been different. I don't plan on coming back, but for those that haven't been to Bruxie's yet, I will say it's worth a whirl. But eat. IMMEDIATELY.

My family enjoyed the food. The sandwich didn't leave me feeling heavy and weighed down, but one sandwich was not enough for my 12 or 13 year old. They each could easily down two. The only negative? The price. I think it's a bit expensive. It's more cost effective to feed my family at Chef Chen's. I liked Bruxie's, but it's not a place we can afford to frequent.

Wanting a waffle fix and reading the great reviews I had to try this place out. Walking towards the place I saw a long line. The seatings are outside and on the other side is a table area where you can stand and eat. You order your food and wait, the staff will go around calling your name to find out where you are. I only had the sweet waffles: Fresh Cream w/ Strawberry preservative and the Brussels waffle (with powder sugar and syrup). I recently had waffles at the Crepes place up at the Farmers Market in LA and thought it was really good with fresh strawberries. So I was eager to try this and hoping this would be my go to place when I want waffles. The waffles were too light and crispy. BOO! Maybe the person making my waffle was cheap on the batter. I wanted to do my happy dance but sadly no happy dance. A lot of people were ordering the Bruxie burger though. Would I come back, no. But the staff that were outside were nice and friendly.

This place is located in Old Town Orange and is walking distance from Chapman University. 蔠e came on a weekday around 3pm for a late lunch and there was a line! 蔠e were not expecting a line, but luckily, the line was not very long. 蔠e ordered the braised rib waffle, burger waffle, and lemon cream & strawberries waffle. 蔜he waffle was crispy, light, and buttery...simply amazing as a bread-like vessel. 蔜he braised rib was tender, savory, and delicious. 蔜he reduced sauce, which came on the side, complimented the meat. 蔠owza! 蔜he cheeseburger waffle was yummy as well. 蔜he burger patty was perfectly medium, juicy, and so good. 蔍 like that this sandwich was kept simple without any sauce. 蔜he lemon cream & strawberries waffle was good, but the combination was slightly tart for my taste. 蔍 preferred the savory waffle-wiches. 蔍 don't know why we did not try this place sooner. 蔜he place earned 4 1/2 stars...rounding up to 5. 蔜he food was fantastic!

Proud that Bruxie is in my neighborhood! Quality food. Friendly service. Clean. The hamburger is off the chain, the meat is so flavorful! And all the sweet waffles are to die for. I've tried almost everything on the menu, everything is good. Maybe they should offer something green of crisp or healthy, just to balance out the richness of their menu. But then again, maybe not.

Wow a lot of reviews considering this place is still pretty recent. 蔜he four star average is a bit high, but Orange isn't exactly a food Mecca so when a new place opens up people seem to lose their minds. 蔜he menu isn't very extensive, so the few times I've been I got the chicken and waffle sammich with waffle fries. 蔐ike everyone else has said, it's delicious - and the chili honey is a unique and interesting touch. 蔕n the other hand, I tried the pulled pork waffle, which is a seasonal special, and I wouldn't recommend it. 蔜he pork was tender but not very flavorful. 蔄lso, the slaw that comes with it was too tart, and it was not very well composed. 蔍t was dripping like a mother and the waffle got soft and mushy. 蔍 also gave the dulce de leche shake a try, and while it was made fairly well, an entire shake of dulce de leche was too rich for my blood - not their fault I guess, but if you're considering it, beware the richness. I love their iced tea, though, oversteeped and strong just the way I like it! 蔍t's something different in downtown Orange, and the food is good, so I'd say it's definitely worth a try if you're in the area. 蔖S - avoid the lunch crowd if possible, the line's around the corner, although the employees work pretty quickly.

Waffles. Fried Chicken. Waffle Fries and perhaps a strawberry soda. That my friends is what your first meal at the Bruxie should be. The Waffles are nice and soft which makes it easy to fold into a sandwich, the chicken is nicely seasoned, tender and not very greasy at all. The Waffle fries: " bet you cant just have one" 蔭nd the strawberry soda was the perfect amount of sweet to top it off. For only being open about 3 months, the bruxie seems to have established quite a cult following. The food here is delicious and really the only place like it in the area. Im just thankful that I dont need to drive all the way to long beach to get some chicken and waffles. That being said, this place has a lot more to it then just the chicken and waffles. They offer waffles with smoked salmon, wild mushrooms, prosciutto and gruyere and many more. If you havent tried it, you're only depriving your taste buds of a serious treat.

Driven by this little hub of waffle sandwich goodness with curiosity a few times. After my girlfriends solo trial run, I felt left out and wanted to check it out too. A little bit of a line when we got there but it was lunch hour, and it moved fast. The menu was broken down to Sweet or Savory. There was also some daily special waffle sandwiches. Making a decision was hard, but I definitely wanted something sweet. I went with the Strawberry Creme Brulee, from the daily special menu. A little pricey but I was too "in" to care. Seating was rough, as there are about 7 outdoor tables but we snaked one before the food came out. MMM, mine was a bit sweet but that's what I was looking for. The waffle was prefect though, it didn't crack of break, but was it still had that bit of crunch. I never thought a waffle could be so versatile but DAMN! I can't wait to go back and try a Savory one. Oh, and I highly recommend the waffle fries with a side of chili honey!

Heard the hype, but was hesitant to go anywhere I've been told to bring my own chairs. Luckily, my friend was mistaken, as there are a few tables available if you're quick or lucky. The poor people at the end of their meal had to deal with me sneaking closer and closer to their table as they were eating; awkward... Tried a few different things from both the sweet and the savory parts of the menu. Prosciutto & Gruyere: Very good, but a bit sparse with the cheese. It's not health food here; pile it on! Mushroom & Goat Cheese: (special) Holy yumness! The mushrooms were flavored amazingly, and made me regret promising to share this with friends. Shortribs: (special) Great amount of meat! The sauce /au jus was terrific. Friend drank the leftover sauce after the sandwich was done! Seriously. S'mores: Like a fun campout food but without having to do the work. Strawberry Creme Brulee: Fresh and great custard. Reminded me a bit of the strawberry croissants at Cream Pan, another personal fav. Would definitely go again, but would have to recommend that you eat it as soon as you get it. 蔜he waffle does NOT hold up after a certain amount of time. 蔈at fast, and you'll be happy!

delicious! went twice this week already. i didnt realize it was soo small, but dont worry its big taste makes up for it! if youre able to get the braised short rib, its to die for. but personally, i like th dessert waffles. the strawberry creme brule is AMAZing, and the smore one is literally what heaven would taste like if i could imagine it. tip: definitely dont take it to go, the crispyness of the waffle is lost quick if you take it home and its soo much better crispy =)

Welll I definately like the creative perspective of the waffle burger. But I wasn't impressed by the burger really at all. The burger just wasnt as good or flavorful as I was expecting. The waffle was a bit dry. 蔠ould I eat here again hmmmm no probably not.

I have been coming to bruxie since the end of November, the first time I tried it, it was lengend... wait for it... wait for it... dary. You can't go wrong with their smores, it was like biting into a cloud. The chicken from the chicken and waffles is sometimes dry but a little extra syrup fixes that right up

Heard about Bruxie from a friend. Went one morning w/ my husband. Parking was a little riduculous. We had to circle the block several times before we parked on the street, but wasnt sure if we were even able to park there. NO PARKING signs everywhere! Their own lot was very very small. It's a busy little shack, but the wait was okay. I had the Bruxie burger which was angus beef w/ lettuce, cheese, tomatoes, pickle and mayo folded in the waffle. It was delish!! My Husband had the buttermilk fried chicken and waffle. He liked it too, but he had a few bites of my burger and really liked that. We also ordered the soft serve frozen custard. Their machine was being fixed at the time so the wait for that was probably 20 min after we had finished our waffles. We didnt mind the wait too much. They upgraded us to the larger size due to our wait.It was good, like custard flavored ice cream. Will come back again to try their lemon and berries waffle because my friend raved about it.

Over Priced and over hyped for what it really is. This place is ok but not as great as others described it. We went today on 1/18/11 around noon and I ordered the buttermilk chicken sandwich with waffle fries while my wife had the lemon berry waffle. First the chicken was decent but kinda dry and the waffle was not as buttery or light as I imagined. The total came out to around $19 which is way to much for what I got, and they charge .54 cents for syrup but they give you every other condiment free. Over all I would not come back unless the prices changed or the food got better.

very good tasting fluffy waffle, chicken cooked to perfection and great seasoned waffle fries. down side too small they should add a big boy combo with two WHOLE waffles and two pieces of chicken no fold!!! the old fashioned cane sugar sodas are great!!! not to mention their creamy vanilla shakes are delicious overall this place is good definitely 蔯oming back to try the rest of their waffles.

yum yum!!! this place was better than i had expected. a little bit on the pricier side, and i found myself eating more at home because the sun dried tomato with goat cheese waffle sandwich (SDTGWS) with a side of waffle fries just wasn't filling enough for my tummy. however, the SDTGWS was sooooo savory, and i'm all about the flavor. if i go back, i'm trying the wild mushroom and arugula waffle. i'm always a fan of small businesses and this is no exception. customer service was top notch, and food quality was equally impressive. be prepared to eat outside though! so if it's winter time, bundle up!!! they haven't put up any outdoor heaters yet. :P

Can't believe I didn't try this place sooner! 蔎ust got back from having the 4th of July special Lobster roll. 蔍t was absolutely amazing! 蔈ven my husband, who is sorta allergic to seafood, couldn't help but have several bites. 蔜hey shipped in lobsters from Maine, and they were boiling them fresh in the parking lot. 蔜he line was hideously long, and the heat was almost unbearable, but there was a super nice waitress that was passing out menus and cold water for everyone. 蔈veryone there was super nice too. 蔛o, the wait (and the price, $17 for the lobster combo) was totally worth it. 蔜he lobster was so so fresh, almost sweet, and they used large lobster chunks in the sandwich (not tiny shredded pieces) that were mouth watering and perfectly chewy. 蔜he lobster was mixed with a bit of mayo (?) but it was very light and didn't over power at all. 蔋ope they have the lobster sandwich more than just once a year, and hope they have it every July 4th! 蔍'll be back soon, and definitely be back next July 4th!

Perfect quick breakfast option as we traveled through this area. Piping hot waffle with apricot jam and sweet cream for me; R had a bacon and egg waffle. Both super-yummy with crisp, fresh waffles. The staff working were very helpful and nice. 蔠e enjoyed the retro fast food building (from the 60s?) as we sat under some clear plastic flaps and looked out at the rain while we ate our waffles. Additionally, we were really happy to find that the coffee was strong, hot, and fresh...DELISH!

I heard the hype. I went with a couple of co-workers about a month ago on a lunch break... and yea... it was a pretty dissapointing lunch. I had the chicken waffles... the chicken was bland... the waffle wasnt very savory... and the coleslaw threw me off. Personally.. Roscoes is better. I also ordered an overpriced vanilla shake... tasted no better than a Jack n Box shake. I tried the "spicy syrup"... it didn't live up. I will give this place another shot, but I'll probably go with a PB & J or some fruity variation waffle instead of the "crowd favorite" chicken & waffles. Hopefully it's better the 2nd time around. If not, I'll have to figure that all these rave reviews are pretty much biased to OC ppl that haven't gotten the nerve to check out any of the Roscoe's in LA county.

It is too die for.....it is definitely a place you must try if your in the area. The parking situation sucks really bad....I got a ticket cause I parked in a permit only zone and didnt realize it. Good luck on finding a place to park

slightly pricey. line was pretty long when i got there during lunch hour. the chefs came out time to time to greet their customers and make suggestions on popular items. i got the Cheesy Bruxie and my friend got the Buttermilk Fried Chicken & Waffle. �My Cheesy Bruxie was like a grilled cheese sandwich; outside was a LITTLE crispy..inside was yummy melted cheeses (gruyere and tillamook cheddar). My friend enjoyed hers, as well. 蔜he chili honey gave it a little bit of pizzazz... We shared the Waffle Fries, which tasted just like Carl's Jr. waffle fries....not as amazing as some people noted...but apparently tastes good with their ice cream custard. would go back if i have guests in town, but for its money..i think it should go at least 2 bucks cheaper.

cola - wow. 蕋his is what cola should taste like. 蕋otally took me too my childhood. 蕂k, so on to waffles. 蕍ery, very good. cheese, egg, & bacon - excellent! 蕂ne thing i didn't like was that my egg was not cooked all the way. 蔵'm pretty sure that's the way they do their eggs but not all customers might like their eggs cooked that way. 蔵 like mine cooked ALL the way. 蕁ext time, i'll just have to ask them to cook my eggs thoroughly. one other thing is, i'm at a waffle place but they don't have syrup unless u ask for it. 蕎hy? otherwise, this dish was great! ��burger - the burger was alright. 蔶ust ok. one other suggestion, they need a new location where it's indoors and has parking space. 蕇eriously, today it started to rain and it was cooolllddd. 蕀akes it hard to enjoy ur food when its cold. 蔶ust sayin~ i wish it was lot closer though. 蔭ny plans on moving to irvine or near south coast plaza??? 蔯an't wait to try other dishes on the menu!

this place is very interesting. 蕋he only place i know of in orange county that made waffle sandwiches. 蔵 recommend the chicken waffle...the bruxie burger and the salmon waffle. 蔵 didnt give it 5 stars because there is never any place to sit there and no public bathroom but other than that the food was very very good

Awesome establishment! And even more awesome of an owner. My girlfriend and I had heard great things about Bruxie and couldn't wait to try it. First thing that should be said is how rad their set up is, Kelly(the owner) told us that the building used to be a burger joint back in the 40's-50's and you can definitely feel the heritage. We both ordered the the chicken/waffle sandwich, fries and a vanilla soda. The table we wanted was dirty and my girlfriend asked the first employee she saw if they could clean the table, we later found out it just so happened to be the owner. He was the nicest guy about it and was quick to clean the table with a smile on his face. When we got our food we were both overly anxious to dive in because of how amazing it looked/smelled. Although the concept seems very simplistic yet unique... they really do knock it out of the park as the food was on point. We were just about finished and I was thinking we for sure had to try their seasonal shake which was a date shake. Just then the owner walked back up to us and asked us what we thought, we quickly responded with nothing but great comments because of how much we enjoyed the meal. He was quick to explain the reason behind the name and concept and seemed so passionate about his little nook. I told him we were going to get the shake but I was just waiting for the long line to mellow out a bit. Not 5 minutes later he walked back up to our table and gave us a complimentary date shake, needless to say we were surprised I mean REALLY??? Who does that? It just goes to show that he cares about his customers and wants you to walk away from his spot wanting to come back the next day(believe me you will want to as well). Let's support local businesses like this because we need more of them. Congrats Kelly/Bruxie team you really have something special there! Can't wait to go back!!!!

So we decided to try out Bruxie and was very happy with the decision. They have a variety of savory and sweet items. I had the chicken and waffles and my husband the egg, ham and cheese. We loved the crispy waffle texture and the savory flavors complemented the slightly sweet waffle. 蔍 would have given it a 5 star, but the waffle unfortunately could not hold it's form with the chicken. 蔜herefore made it difficult to eat, not to mention the chicken could use a little more seasoning. �But waffle held up very well with the egg concoction my husband had. 蔜here really isn't any place to wash up, but they have free water cups, a sanitary hand pump and napkins. So that worked out pretty well. 蔜he decor is very hip and on a nice day, it's a good place to go and enjoy the outdoor dining experience. 蔈specially when your four legged friends are welcome. �I like Bruxie and despite the waffle not keeping it's shape with the chicken, I would order it again as it was tasty, especially with maple syrup. 蔠ith that said, I'd like to try some of the items on the sweet menu and see how those play*out.

I saw a pic of someone eating here on facebook and thought it looked so good I had to try it. So, tonight I dragged my boyfriend to Orange (20 min from where we live). He was very skeptical. I liked the atmosphere: across the street from Chapman so lot's of college kids roaming aroud and black and red themed colors. It looked like an old taco joint with a modern twist (it was an old hamburger joint before). Someone came up to us right away outside the order window and asked us if we needed any help/suggestions. Since this is an order first then sit down place, that service was awesome! I had seen and heard that the fried chicken waffle sandwhich was delicious so my bf got that. I got the seasonal goat cheese, arugala, and wild mushroom with balsamic and added sun dried tomatoes. We also got an old fashion cola, diet cola, and criss cut fries. The cola and diet cola were good, tasted really different from each other. They are made from pure cane sugar instead of high fructose corn syrup, and you can really tell the difference. The fries had salt and pepper on them which I liked. They were pretty good but nothing out of the ordinary. My sandwhich was really good. All the flavors were great and the waffle was super crunchy on the outside but soft on the inside. My bf's was AMAZING. The chicken was so tender and a perfect combo with the waffle. It wasn't super greesy like fried chicken normally is and it wasn't too heavy. It was delicious. I've had roscoes chicken and waffles and I think this one is MUCH better. When I go back if I'm really hungary, I think I'll get the chicken one because mine seamed to lack something (meat or a substantial filler). If I'm not so hungary, I'll get the mushroom and goat cheese one. I also am curious to try to breakfast waffles (egg, bacon, and cheese) as well as the dessert waffles (berries & cream, nutella & banana). I wish they could open one closer to where I live in Newport or Costa Mesa. It would be a great spot to have on the Peninsula in Newport. I can't wait to go back!
