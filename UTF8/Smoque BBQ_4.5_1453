Why didn't I go here sooner? I was in the mood for some BBQ for dinner, so I decided to come here on a Thursday night. I was somewhat surprised the line was forming out the door, but it moved rather quickly. I decided to go all out and eat like a pig. I got the sliced brisket platter with mac n' cheese and coleslaw as my two sides. Also I ordered the cornbread and peach cobbler. The brisket was delicious and the BBQ sauce that came with it was so good. Everything I ate was wonderful. I was even tempted to get more peach cobbler. Afterwards, I went into a meat coma and fell asleep at home. Good thing I ran this morning also. Definitely coming back here when the BBQ mood strikes again.

I spent the last two years living in Kansas City, a town known for BBQ, so I have unreasonably high standards for BBQ. That being said, Smoque is a great place for BBQ. I didn't give it 5 stars, however, because I felt the highlight of my meal was their sides, not so much their meats. I break it down below: Sides: The macaroni and cheese comes baked in a separate metal container. It was rich and cheesy, but not too heavy - certainly a must have. Don't skip the fries, baked beans, or cornbread - all delicious and certainly noteworthy. Most importantly, do yourself a favor and save room for their peach cobbler... holy shit. Meats: I tried the pulled pork and the sliced brisket and both were solid. Juicy, tender, and flavorful - great, but not amazing. I haven't tried their ribs or Texas sausage and I'll be sure to reevaluate this review when I do. Sauce: I enjoyed it - it was tangy with a hint of sweetness, though it was a bit on the runny side. Is it the best BBQ I've ever had? No, but you'll be hard pressed to find a better place in Chicago.

Few weeks ago Smoque BBQ was featured on Check Please! and got great revews so I decided to give it a shot and see what is everyone raving about. I was actually very lucky as I did not have to wait in line that long maybe 10 min. However as I was exiting I saw that the line was a 1/2 block long outside. Crazy. I ordered a little bit of everything -mac and cheese - ok -french fries -ok -green beans - not so much and the famous brisket - ok BUT I could not finish all of this food so I took some left overs home and here is where the secret is..............THE BRISKET IS DELICIOUS COLD!!!! Seriously it is better cold than hot. I love it. If I am ever in the neighborhood 蔭gain I am getting the brisket to go and sticking it in my fridge for a day.

Smoque is the best barbeque you'll find in Chicago. The brisket is the most popular item on the menu. I got the chopped brisket sandwich - with a side of fries. My girlfriend had the pulled pork sandwich with a side of mac and cheese. I will give them credit for having a "taste" option on the menu where you can order a small portion of basically any menu item... which i did take advantage of. I also tried the St. Louis ribs which in my opinion was best thing I tried. �Maybe it was just me but i enjoyed the pulled pork better than the brisket too. I found the brisket to be a little too dry. 蔜he sides were also very good and overall it was a great bang for your buck. For me, Smoque doesn't measure up to a few places down south, but it is the best in Chicago.

This place is about 3/4 of a mile away from my condo and I am so glad it is. 蔍 am a repeat customer as the food here is fantastic. 蔈verything I've had has always been excellent, but the Pulled Pork sandwich is my favorite. 蔄 single sandwich is typically more than enough food for 1 meal, and I sometimes make 2 out of it (usually with a side order). 蔜he peach cobbler is a great desert, but i do wish that there was a little more to the corn bread. The only real drawback in my opinion is the interior - it always feels like a mess hall to me and I wouldn't really ever consider eating on site. 蔜he good news is that their take out service is great. 蔜hey will give you very specific times for pick up (sometimes in excess of 2 hours, so plan accordingly), and they are almost always on time with their schedule. 蔍ts nice to walk in, skip the line (which is always to the door!), pay quickly and escape.

Brisket and pulled pork were good, but not amazing by any means. 蔜he Mac and cheese was lumpy and flavorless, a big disappointment. 蔜he sauce tasted like burnt, watered down tomato paste, definitely forgettable. 蔜o top it all off, the cash register or POS system broke, once we placed our order they told us that we had to come back and get in line to pay after we finished our meal, totally inefficient.

I have been wanting to go here forever and I finally got to last weekend! I love the cafeteria-style set up. You order your food and pay at a register, then sit and watch the pick-up counter, where they will set your finished tray and call your number. I had the St Louis half slab rib platter with mac and cheese and peach cobbler for my sides. It also came with coleslaw. The ribs were great - not as tender as baby back, but really unique and tasty seasoning. The mac and cheese had great flavor, but it was too runny. I would still probably deal and order. The coleslaw was tangy and delicious. Honestly, the highlight was the cobbler. OH MY GOD. The crust is thick, seasoned and crisp. The inside is warm, sweet, with firm peaches. I had quite the experience eating that dessert. Would definitely come again. Everyone in our group did the platter option, and everyone ordered different meats and everyone was pleased. Don't think you can go wrong!

Loved this place. Awesome, awesome, awesome bbq. My fiancee wasn't really too impressed, though. I had the half brisket sandwich, added a sausage, had the baked beans and the cole slaw. I loved how the slaw wasn't a mayo based but more vinegar. The baked beans were really tasty as well. We also had the mac and cheese which was ok and the corn bread, to which my fiancee stated was the best thing we had, it was really good. The bad, everything was vinegar based. Not much variety in terms of sauces, or maybe I didn't know that there were other options. Also, it is WAY out. I mean I probably would not make a special trip out there again, not just for this. Its also BYOB and thankfully Walgreens started selling because there is one close by.

Had a full rack of ribs, Mac and cheese, pulled pork sandwich and the peach cobbler. The BBQ sauce is what makes this place. The ribs were do tender we cut them with plastic forks! We dinned in so all the aromas added to the overall experience. Besides what better way to celebrate the 4th than with ribs!! The Ribs were so tender i was easily able to cut them with a plastic knife! food was ready quick and the staff was really nice. The peach cobbler had almonds or pecans in the crust which gave a really delicious taste; original in its own way. I love an establisment that doesnt over charge customers for petty things like fountain drinks. Somque has free refills! Lastly, their original bbq sauce is off the chain...so good in fact they actually sell it by the bottle! i will mos def be visiting Smoque again real soon!

I don't know why it took me so long to try this place out... you need to look no more for great BBQ! Smoque BBQ is the place. I had the full slab of baby backs with the slaw, fries and beans... awesome! It's exactly what I expected and more. I really appreciated that the BBQ sauce was on the side and not hiding the beautifully cooked ribs...they call it "low and slow" here at Smoque BBQ. It makes my mouth water just thinking about it. The order came with 2 servings of BBQ sauce and I used one with a couple of dashes of hot sauce, the other I left alone to compare... excellent balance of heat and smoke. Smoque BBQ is definitely in the "going-back-here" category!

It's been on our Chicago bucket list for awhile, and we finally made the trek last night. We got there around 5:00 and had to wait a good 20 minutes to put in our order. By the time we left around 6:15, the line was literally down the block. Between the two of us, we ordered a pulled pork sandwich, a half rack of St. Louis ribs, and a tasting portion of the brisket. Our sides were baked beans (which we both agreed were the best thing we ate) and macaroni and cheese. I thought the pulled pork was absolutely fantastic. One note on the macaroni--you can get a small (one aluminum tin) or large (two aluminum tins, aka the large is twice the size as the small). The small is what comes with the entrees. So, if you're getting one of the sandwiches, it's actually more advantageous to order the sandwich a la carte and then a large macaroni on the side. It's much more macaroni bang for your buck (and yes, it's delicious). The seating situation is not a big deal at all. You wait until you've put in your order, a host finds you a table, and you eat in peace. There are enough tables and few enough cashiers that they have the whole operation timed perfectly.

Regardless of what some Chicago food critics may say about the brisket here, it's nothing like Texas brisket. The main problem as I see it is that they are using an electric smoker and it just doesn't impart the fragrance or texture of a smoker that gets it's heat from a wood source. I honestly feel like they should create another category called electricue to describe what those things produce. The brisket is juicy but frankly I find it to be a little bland and not quite crusty enough on the outside. I like mine fattier too but I realize that may be more subjective. The ribs were good, very good. The beanswere sweet, tangy and delicious. The mac and cheese was kind of clotted but the taste was OK.

Amazing! 蔍 have always been skeptical of BBQ in chicago, but now Smoque has changed all that. 蔍 stood in line for about 45 minutes on a Saturday night, but it was well worth the wait. 蔍 had the 1/2 and 1/2 sandwich (1/2 brisket, 1/2 pulled pork). 蔜he coleslaw, baked beans, Mac and cheese, and peach cobbler were all equally amazing. �My only complaint is that this place should either be bigger or they should open another location. 蔣um!

My wife and I are from California and we were in Chicago for the weekend at the time craving for something a really good place to eat. This place is great! I don't really know what else to say about this place that has not been said yet within the thousands of reviews by fellow yelpers. My wife and I had the pulled pork and tri tip brisket with Mac n cheese coleslaw. The tri-tip is so tender it just crumbles. The pulled pork was the best I've ever had (and I've been to quite a few of BBQ restaurants). Sides are pretty good as well. I love their Mac n cheese. This place has won quite a few awards for their BBQ and has also been featured on food network.

First time there. What wonderful BBQ! The brisket, pulled pork, St Louis ribs were all amazing! That brisket is to die for. The baked beans and mac and cheese were terriific sides. If you don't mind the wait, we waited about 50 minutes from the time we got in line to the time we got our food, it is well worth it!! The place is a little small and seating is tight. But the price is right and the food is off the charts. I'm a huge fan and can't wait to get back there.

There is nothing to add. Get the sliced brisket sandwich, spicy BBQ sauce and the slaw to dump on your bun. Fries are nice if you eat them there. As an Eastcoaster we would love some malt vinegar for the fries, but as minority we bring our own.

After hearing nothing but rav reviews from fellow Chicagolanders my lips were smacking just at the thought of going to Smoque... I however was disappointed. It's quite possible that it was talked up a bit too much for me... My husband and I went the day after the 4th of July (when they were closed) so I suppose the ribs werent as low and slow as they could/should have been. They did not fall off the bone, they were not tender, they were chewy. I regretably did not get the mac n'cheese. It looked divine. The beans were some of the best I've ever had. The BBQ sauce is middle-of-the road... nothing to blow your mind or anything. I was also surprised to find that it was not a sit-down, table service kind of place... I guess the fans who raved about it left that part out? There is no beer either. My expectation was to come, sit down, order a beer, have some mind blowing BBQ brought out to me... and I didn't get that at all. Smoke Daddy in Bucktown still beats this out in my opinion.

I've been meaning to try this place out for a while given all the praise it gets and finally got the chance a while back. 蔄 group of us ordered a handful of items for take-out and everything lived up to the hype. 蔠e had the baby back ribs, the St. Louis ribs, and the brisket. �The baby back ribs rivaled ribs I've had anywhere else, but the real star for me were the St. Louis ribs. 蔜hey were meatier and juicier than their baby back equivalents and with extra barbeque sauce they were to die for. 蔜he brisket was excellent as well, fall apart tender with great smoke and beef flavor. 蔍 was also a big fan of the vinegary sauce that came along with the brisket. 蔄s for the sides, I enjoyed the mac and cheese which was cheesy, creamy and everything a good mac and cheese should be. 蔋owever, the side I enjoyed the most was the peach cobbler. Chicago may not be a mecca for barbeque like Memphis or Kansas City, but Smoque is definitely a stand out.

Smokey bbq at its finest. The half chicken melts in your mouth, but I will say that the brisket is where it's at. Get the sandwich. The sweet bread makes the brisket's tangy goodness even more apparent. For sides, I am not a cole slaw fan. But I do love their mac & cheese. So much so, that when I get to have two sides, I opt for two orders of the mac & cheese. My mouth is watering right now... Bring your appetite and get a "taste" of the ribs for only 4.50 more.

There's really not much to add. 蔄ll I have to do is basically be a sounding board for everyone else's raves. 蔛moque is a pretty legit BBQ place. 蔜hey are focused on good old fashioned BBQ and not slathering on all sorts of sweet honey laden sauce. My favorite is their pulled pork and their brisket. 蔍 won't even get on the topic of ribs because I can't defend myself, too touchy of a subject. 蔜he mac and cheese is pretty amazing too. Parking kinda sucks around here. 蔜he wait has definitely gotten easier as opposed to the early years, but the food is consistently the same. 蔛moque is probably here to stay and I love that. 蔍t's also really nice to have a local foodie option in the Old Irving neighborhood. �)

Best barbeque in Chicago. I'm already craving it a couple of days later. I went on a Sunday afternoon ready to wait. Lucky me, I was ordering in just a couple of minutes! I got a half slab of baby back ribs, mac and cheese, fries, and coleslaw. My boyfriend got the chopped brisket sandwich, beans, and coleslaw. My ribs were absolutely perfect! Smoky bark, juicy meat, not too fatty. I dunked the pieces in the accompanying regular and spicy sauce. And... that's where I feel Smoque falls short. Where are their sauce choices?! One of my favorite aspects of barbeque is trying all of the different sauce options, from smoky to spicy to vinegar-based. Smoque's spicy sauce was yummy, but it didn't really entertain my fire-loving tastebuds. I just like variety... is that so wrong? But I'll get over it. Anyways, back to the rest of the food. The mac and cheese is really as good as everyone says: super creamy, real cheese taste, beautiful crust. The fries seemed fresh cut and the portion was huge. I tried a bite of my boyfriend's chopped brisket and was surprised by how juicy and flavorful it was. We both liked the coleslaw well enough but it was primarily regular cabbage--not much color in there. The staff was unexpectedly pleasant, from the girl taking my order to the guy telling my confused face that I could go sit down outside and he'd tell me when my food was ready. Oh yeah, the girl sitting next to me got a salad. Idiot.

I know, it's shocking, but my BF and I actually went to this place without checking Yelp; We found their website via Google and went based on what we saw there. Bad idea. To preface: We are not food snobs at all. All we want is good food, good service, and a pleasant experience. We go out to eat several times a week and try to judge everything fairly, within context, and with an open-mind. I say this only because of the overwhelmingly positive reviews of this place that I do not get at ALL. They have their own parking lot, and we had no trouble with street parking. Walking up to the restaurant, the outdoor seating section looked lovely (unfortunately, it was full - at 5:30 PM on a Friday, so go early). We walked inside and were told by the busboys they'd "seat us" after we placed an order, but the inside was completely empty and basically had cafeteria-style seating, so, um...okay. Dress code? Feel free to show up in your sweatpants (not necessarily a complaint, ha). You place your order at the counter, much like a deli, and are given a number. We ordered from a bored young girl who couldn't have looked more unhappy to be there. Within mere minutes, your number is yelled out for you to walk back up to pick up your tray. Okay, so in a deli, your food can be made-to-order within minutes, but BBQ? No. So the food is not made-to-order. You can BYOB or serve yourself at a soda station, not unlike, again, a deli or McDonald's or Burger King. My BF ordered ribs with the brisket chili and mac & cheese, I ordered the chicken with corn bread and mac & cheese. They really are sides, quite small, which is fine. The sauce is VERY VERY VERY sweet, like, 20 sugars dumped in per serving sweet. The chicken was fine, the ribs were fine. Far, far, far from the best we've had, but certainly not the worst...just meh. The main dishes were just...fine. Nothing to write home about, at all. Maybe they'd have tasted better if they hadn't been (barely) luke-warm. The sides were excellent, and I wish they were available as their own entrees. My boyfriend completely devoured their coleslaw (I'm not a fan of coleslaw in general), so that's also a plus in terms of sides (and comes included). So, yeah. Cafeteria seating. Deli service (in the short time we were there, they went from yelling out 60 to the mid-80s - that's not impressive, that's a factory line of food...again, like a BBQ McDonald's). Food that isn't made-to-order. The entrees are overpriced, the sides are excellent. Disgustingly-sweet sauce. $40 for this? The equivalent of fast food? No, thank you, not with all of the legitimately incredible options out there. Guess it'd be alright for a quick lunch if you don't mind blowing $40-50 on lunch for 2. Their prices are ridiculously inflated for the quality of the food and the dining experience. Maybe this is "great BBQ" for people who never venture out their own neighborhood. It's not even charmingly simple or down-to-earth. We left super-disappointed. But, hey, the mac & cheese was delicious, so maybe we'll just order 6 side orders if a craving hits.

In my ongoing quest for the best BBQ well, ever, smoque is a top contender. I went back and forth on 4 stars or 5, and settled on four as a reflection of the overall experience. Based on the actual bbq, though, this would receive a 5+ rating. I had a pulled pork sandwich, and it was, in a word, Phenomenal. Best bbq pork I've had outside of north carolina (home to the best pulled pork on earth.) The meat was juicy, smoky, and tender. I didn't need a sandwich, I could have just eaten a mound of the meat on it's own. Perfection. 5 stars. The rest of the experience was a solid four. I wasn't blown away by the mac and cheese, and I can't handle the vineger slaw that yankees insist on calling cole slaw (if it's not creamy, it's not cole slaw.) That being said, I still ate all the mac and cheese and slaw on my plate, so it's not like they were bad. My boyfriend's meal was the opposite-- his sides were pretty out of the park (baked beans and corn bread), but his sliced brisket was just on the good-side-of-average. I was too full for an order of peach cobbler, but as I do consider peach cobbler to be my true love of the dessert world, you can be sure I'll be back for more. one last note-- it's communal seating, but just barely. The tables are long, but someone seats you after you've ordered, so there's no fighting for a table. All very civilized and easy.

If eating in..get there early - it gets packed! 蔅est bet: order ahead and take it to go.

Absolutely the best BBQ joint in Chicago!! Hands down. Friendly service. Expect a wait most times you go, because people consistently crave this joint. I wish like hell that the owner would open up another joint in trendy Bucktown. :) Ribs, Brisket, Beans, sides, everything is top notch. Geez my mouth is watering just typing this.

These folks are the expert smokers, I mean BBQ'ers. We ordered the baby back ribs and the meat was so tender. It had a good meat to fat ratio. Plus, the meat had a wonderful crust that was not charred up with burnt meat. 蔍t was smoked really well and you can taste it in the food. We were so impressed!!! If you order the food as a combo, it comes with two sides. 蔜he order comes with a side of coleslaw already so make sure you pick two different sides. 蔠e had the baked beans, french fries, mac and cheese, peach cobbler and the corn bread. 蔒y favorite was the coleslaw. 蔍t was made with a vinaigrette dressing and was super delicious! 蔒y other two favorite sides were the french fries and the peach cobbler. 蔜he mac and cheese was good too but too creamy for me. 蔍 was surprised that this BBQ place did not have mashed potatoes. Maybe a suggestion for the future? I love me some mashed potatoes! There are rules outside of the restaurant, such as you cannot pick where you want to sit. 蔍 guess seating is tight at the restaurant so they need to pack everyone in. We had a table sitting right next to us, even though there were other open seats available. 蔍t did start getting busy later in the evening so I can see why they want everyone seated in an orderly fashion. Service here was really top notch. 蔈veryone was really nice and friendly. 蔍ts a pay first, eat later type of restaurant so I wasn't even expecting to be served. What a pleasant surprise! Street parking is available in the area. 蔋owever, there are signs across the street from the restaurant that say you aren't allowed to park. I think its because the residents that live across the street from the restaurant don't want anyone taking up their parking spots. Be careful where you park! The restaurant was a little out of our way to get to, but definitely worth the trip. It was really good smoked meat!!!

Smoque Catering beat out two other quotes from other, competing BBQ joints here in Chicago. I recently hosted a large family party at my home and was really excited to serve their food. Two days before the party, I checked-in with Peggy from their catering office and was really unhappy with the way she talked to me. She was short with me, inpatient, and sort of patronized me. It got me really nervous about my order. I admitted to her that a handful of people RSVP'd to the gathering later than I had wished and she managed to bring my conservative $350 order up to nearly $600. It was really more than I could spend but she said this, "So are you only trying to feed your guests just a taste because if this was my party, I'd order a lot more than what you're ordering." That statement really made me nervous... I told her a lot of the guests were not big eaters... I also have catering experience having planned conferences for a living professionally... well, I should have gone with my gut. The food arrived, by one of the most helpful guys ever. The food tasted and looked great (the guests loved it) but I can't tell you how much food was wasted. We had two and half extra pans of pulled pork that went uneaten. We had three bags of buns that were never opened. And we had one extra container of slaw. I'd say, about $150 worth of extra food that didn't need to be there. Peggy upsold me and I wished she would have just respected my original order instead of using my uncertainty to bring in more revenue.

Smoque catered my Backyard BBQ engagement party two weeks ago. I'm still getting phone calls asking where we catered from because everyone LOVED the food. From the very beginning Smoque made everything so easy. It's hard to find a place that will deliver to the suburbs, but I called and discussed how much food they thought I'd need and worked with me without any problems. When I called a couple weeks later to say that our guest count had gone down they had no problem reducing the amount of food I ordered. I even told them that I didn't want to use their buns and they were fine with that and suggested how much I should get to make sure I had enough. Setting up the day of the party they arrived on time and made sure everything looked nice and organized. The food was delicious and many people went up many times for more helpings. I love eating the food at Smoque but I definitely recommend their catering if you're looking for someone to provide food for any sized party!

smoque = awesomeness! i had the pleasure of dining here and ordering a few different items from the menu - the staff was courteous and delightful even with all my annoying questions. the sausages was tasty, snappy and smoked to perfection - the ribs had a great rub on them that i didn't even have to bother with any sauce but of course, i had to tast each of the sauces (just in case) i recommend this place to everyone!!

Went back to Smoque for a late lunch, with a girlfriend after hours of garage sale shopping. The line for service was out the door and onto the sidewalk! So - we called our order in - waited comfortably in the shade on a bench in a little park 1/2 block away, then strolled back to pick up our brisket sandwich order. Walked back to the park, and enjoyed our meal al fresco! (This was definatly the way to go!) Oh yea - food was excellent!

Darn good Q! Came 蔴ere for the first time the other day and man was I pleased. I got the platter of brisket with the mac and cheese and fries. I also got a taste of the pulled pork. Both the pulled pork and the brisket were heavenly. The meat was tender and had a great kick to it. I don't know if its the seasoning or the way they cooked it but man was it good. Next time I visit I will most likely get the pulled pork sandwich. Also they give you lot and lots of bbq sauce which I can dig.

I have traveled to many BBQ cities and I've had great BBQ but never in my own city. I mentioned this to my wife and she surprised me with a visit here. When we walked in we were greeted by Carlos aka Omar, who asked if it was our first time. I love it when a restaurant recognizes new customers and lends a helping hand. He was very helpful and recommended we try the beef brisket. He told us it was his favorite. I also thought his story about his nickname was cute. They call him Omar because there are too many other Carlos working there. It was funny how he delivered it. So of course we ordered pulled pork...sorry Carlos/Omar. We also got coleslaw, Mac and Cheese and peach cobbler. Carlos then came over and he offered us two more sauces to dip in. I really loved the spicy BBQ sauce. It was really yummy. He even hooked us up with sweet jalape杘 peppers. They were so good...I started eating them with my pulled pork. The pulled pork was amazing. It was one of the best I've had in a long time. Carlos noticed we only got the pulled pork. I think he was sad we didn't take his advice. So he brought us over a sample of the beef brisket. Oh boy was it good. I am completely torn between two meats. I know next time I will get both. The Mac and cheese was so good. The small side left me wanting more. I love the little individual foil dishes. Every container had the perfect amount of bread crumbs toasted on top. The peach cobbler was also fantastic. The crust was one of the best ever. I only wish I had a scoop of vanilla ice cream to put on top. Maybe management will add this for a summer treat. The Cole slaw was also very fresh tasting. I loved that it was not drenched in mayo but seemed to be vinegar based. While we were eating my wife told me to look over my left shoulder. And there was guy hanging on the wall starring at me. Really? Why is he everywhere in Chicago? This is starting to get a little ridiculous. He should just move here and open a restaurant. As we were leaving at 11:50am, a huge line started to form. We had beaten the lunch crowd. I also got to see Carlos in action. He not only welcomes guests and cleans tables but he is the enforcer too. Some guy was trying to save a table even though his party was at the back of the line. He very diplomatically informed the guy that he had to get others seated who were in front. I love that!!! Good for you Smoque for defending the rights of the hungry people needing a spot to eat. You have got this down to a science. Some side notes...the neighbors do not like you and your cars. They have giant professional signs in the street informing you to not park in front of there houses. I found it kind of funny but understood. It only told me that the food was so good that people will risk there car for an amazing meal. I loved Smoque BBQ...it was one of the better BBQ's I've had. I can hardly wait to come back for some more of this fantastic food.

Restaurant: Smoque BBQ Cuisine: BBQ Location: North Center (Chicago) Address: 3800 N Pulaski Rd Price Range: $10~15 1: Poor 2: OK 3: Good 4: Very Good 5: Excellent Food: 4 Service: 4 �Ambiance: 3 Overall: 3.5 Extra information: *Ranked #6 restaurant on Urbanspoon Chicago *Pay first, and then sit down Smoque BBQ was a random find for me. Nobody told me about it, and I didn't find it on urbanspoon or yelp. To be honest, I can't remember how I stumbled upon their website. Anyways, regardless of however I found this spot- there was no way I was going to pass up on a BBQ place. It was a few minute drive from Chicago downtown, so my friend and I decided to check it out. Smoque BBQ is known for their brisket and bbq ribs- but personally, I find briskets to be a little too dry for me. Since there were only two of us....I had to think really hard as to what I wanted to order before I visited the restaurant. Once I walked in, I was surprised to see the restaurant lay out. I was expecting a full service restaurant, but it was order and pay at front and sit whereever kinda thing. There was a guy from the restaurant guiding everybody and making sure everyone had tables, which was super helpful. Keep in mind that they don't let you sit down unless all of your party is present at the restaurant. Ordered: St Louis Rib 1/2 Combo with coleslaw + 2 sides * 1/2 St Louis Rib, coleslaw, mac n cheese and fries for $14.95 * You can choose between Baby Back Ribs or St. Louis * They said St. Louis is the meatier and fattier cut so I went with that * If you choose a combo, you get to choose 2 sides other than a coleslaw * Sides are BBQ beans, mac n cheese, fries, brisket chili and corn bread * For $14.95, this combo was huge and it could be shared between 2 people (girls) * Ribs were kind of on the dry side, and the sauce was more so marinated into the meat rather than dripping from it * Explains why there was a side of bbq sauce on the side for you to dip in * It wasn't fall-off-the-bone type which I prefer, it was kind of disappointing * Coleslaw was light and refreshing but nothing special * Mac n Cheese was so good! it was small in portion but had the perfect consistency of cheeseyness and the crust on top was to die for * Fries were huge in portion, it was good but again- nothing special Ordered: 1/2 Pulled pork sandwich * 1/2 pulled pork sandwich for $4.95 * This was better than I thought it'd be * Most pulled pork sandwiches I find it to be dry * But the pulled pork was so tender and juicy * I didn't really like the bun since it was toasted and made it a little messy to eat * They give you some more BBQ sauce on the side to use * BBQ sauce was tangy with the just right amount of sweetness and smokyness Ordered: Cornbread * Side for 95 cents * This went well with my meal and it was well made * It's made like a corn muffin which made it easier to eat * I could feel the texture of cornmeal when I ate it (how it's suppose to be) * If you like cornbread, it's def worth 95 cents! Summary: I looked around as I was eating my ribs and it seemed like a lot of people were getting the briskets (what they are known for). And they looked pretty damn good! It wasn't dry looking like the most briskets I've seen. I love bbq and meat- and I can't stop thinking about their mac n cheese. 蔖rice is decent and the turnover rate for tables are quite fast. Would recommend to drop by if you are in the area

The bbq here is incredible as everyone is probably saying on here. 蔍 agree. The smell once you get inside this small, well set-up place, will make you crave bbq that very instant. I won't upload any pictures because there are many on here already. 蔍t's a small place but the way they shift and move people around with great speed is a plus. 蔜he service from the wait staff is the key here. 蔜hey clear tables very fast. 蔜he food is ordered and you wait to be seated, once seated your order is processed. 蔜he food...hands down the best from here to Texas. 蔍t's the right seasoning, the right bite and the right pull from the bone. 蔇ry-rubbed ribs, no sauce needed (maybe the pulled pork sometimes) and down right outstanding! 蔜hey know how to do it correct. 蔆hicago will never be known for brisket but holy sh**! 蔛o tender and juicy, smoked perfected and the bite can make you speechless. 蔜he sauce (vinegar based) only compliments it but is not needed. 蔜hat's when you know you have a great bbq spot. 蔋uge plus is that it's byob. 蔆rowded on the weekends and loud for an extremely small place so maybe get in there before 6pm or on the weekday. �This is truly a must of spots, a must.

Awesome-5 star-brisket!!! The little guy with the gray hair & mustache that works there--even more awesome! Pretty cool that he shares the employee favorites & special concotions they make up. Brisket is my only focus when heading into this meatopia. The sauce is not necessary b/c it's flavorful and definitely not dry...but adding a touch of the spicy bbq sauce does compliment it. Since it was on the Food Network, the lines are sometimes craaazy long... fortunately, it goes pretty fast. The seating is a bit packed & loud but who cares when you're feeding your face with meat!

Finally a place that lives up to the hype! This was a last-minute dinner decision, and I was really surprised to find the place packed, and I mean PACKED, on a Thursday night. We pretty much had to wait out the door, but surprisingly things kept moving. 30 minutes, and many edited dinner options later, I finally decided to go with the Brisket Platter with the BBQ Beans and Peach Cobbler. Holy yum. Full of flavor and delicious-highly recommend. My partner got the Pulled Pork Sandwich with a taste of the St. Louis Ribs, both were reallyyy good. The only thing I would've like was more sauce on the Pulled Pork, but it's personal preference really. I pretty much want everything on the menu, so I will definitely be coming back to do just that. Yay Smoque!!

Omg now i know what a true definition of a feast is!!! I dont think I need to say more. The ribs are out of this world! The (pulled?) chicken sandwich is amazing and all the sides and the peach cobbler!!! The 30 minute line was WELL worth it!!! The service is great there too, got our food fast and the bus boys were very helpful and friendly. Not a place u go to every day or even that often - am sure its not uber healthy! But every once in a while its a TREAT! Expect a long wait, but worth it!

We went for lunch. Chopped brisket was good although its' temperature was lukewarm while the chicken we also ordered was piping hot. Chicken was delicious - very moist - and delicious when dipped into the sauce we were given. Mac and cheese was ordinary, coleslaw dry, and fries greasy. We were not asked what sauce we wanted so I guess you just get what they want to give you. Compare that to Smoke Daddy on Division which has various sauces on the table for you to try. The biggest disappointment for me was the lady that took our order. (And I would have overlooked this if the food had blown us away.) There was only one other customer in the entire place; she was not busy. It was obvious we had never been there before from our confusion as to where the menu was (blackboard on wall) and to our discussion on which sides to choose. She neither offered her suggestions nor conversed in anyway besides asking "What would you like?" If you're going to have someone interact with customers and take orders, have them be a bit personable and friendly. Parking was easy right on the side street. Free for 2 hours. I'm sure, though, it's super busy on the weekends. And, yeah, don't park on the south side of the side street where you will see the "NO PARKING for SMOQUE BBQ' signs; it's permit parking. Smoque's neighbors must be tired of cars taking their spots. Good they're trying to save people from getting tickets.

Not sure which I like better, the sauce or the smoked meats - Does not matter, eating them individual or combining them are my favorites. If there was room for a tent outside I would be there but the lines of people would not approve. As always, the ribs here are the best - despite the long wait and lines - worth every minute. Take out is my choice to get this great BBQ in my mouth the fastest.

Yowza, yowza, yowza! 蔐et me get this out there: 蔍 looove barbeque! 蔍 like crappy barbeque even. 蔠hat is there not to love about a rosy pink smoke ring, a crusty bark, juicy, succulent meat and a perfectly balanced sweet/sour accompaniment sauce? �Yes, I am from the camp of bark bbq fans.) Proper barbeque should have all the above. 蔛moque BBQ delivers! 蔐ast night was my second visit. 蔍 have tried to go on several other occasions, but the line had been out the door and I was too ravenous to wait that long. 蔉ortunately last night my wait was a mere 15 minutes. First, let me give Smoque BBQ a big shout out for the tasting portions! 蔍 can be indecisive at times, and the tasting portions are reasonably priced and sized to allow me to sample without grazing on my dining companion's dinner. Now for my meal last night...I ordered the brisket chili, the sampler of St. Louis ribs (1/4 slab) and the cornbread. 蔜he brisket in the chili was good, but I was looking for bark chunks and was disappointed that there weren't any. 蔍t was a bit on the watery side for my liking for chili -- I prefer the stick-to-your-ribs kind of chili that leaves me satisfied until breakfast the next day. 蔜here was, however, a nice balance of meat, beans and tomatoes in the chili. 蔜he spiciness was very good too: 蔭 heat that wasn't so overpowering that people who can't handle spiciness should shun away from this. Now for those ribs. 蔍'm drooling right now as I write this. 蔅oy, Pavlov would be so proud if he could see me now! 蔐et me sum this up quite simply: 蔊o to their website and take a look at the ribs. 蔣es, their ribs look like that and YES YES YES, they taste like that! 蔜hey put the sauce on the side, which I feel satisfies both sides of the barbeque dichotomy. 蔣ou who love the sauce can slather that goodness as much as you need. 蔣ou who love the bark can grab a hunk and dip to your heart's content. Lastly, I can't forget that cornbread. 蔜he cornbread was really good with pieces of corn. 蔛weet, but not too sweet. 蔒oist, but not to the point that the bread gets stuck to your teeth. 蔍f only they served it warm with a pat of butter on the side. And please don't insult Smoque: 蔇on't dare use a fork on those ribs.

Ehhhh? The atmosphere is fun, but I think I have figured out the reason for Smoque's popularity, because I'm thinkin' it ain't over the food, or the location (sh!t's far away, yo). It's the name. My silly (boy) friends just love love loooooove to say, "Hey dude, wanna Smoque tonight???" Yes you're super awesome. Such creative play on on the name. I'm so lucky to call all you idiots my friends. Maybe I just don't get the real reason behind BBQ. To me, the purpose lies in two areas: 1. Sauce 2. Tender, meaty goodness Smoque kinda failed in one arena and skated by with a 6.0 out of 10 in the other. The sauce was lackluster and minimal. I need my meat saucy. It just isn't the same for me. The meat was somewhat tender, though sometimes difficult to chew and occasionally quite tough. I don't like to work to swallow my meat. (That's what she said.) I'm not saying that Smoque does not provide classic, for reals BBQ. All I'm saying is they do not serve the kind of BBQ that I enjoy. Every now and then I can be talked into Smoque(ing), and then I order the sides, which are much better than the meat.

The Baby Back ribs are incredible! And that chopped brisket sandwich was the sh#t! None of the sides disappointed, I think it is BYOB so next time I am bringing a Scrimshaw Pilsner with me. And the people were so nice and seem to really feel how the customer's where enjoying the BBQ. Awesome place and I can't recommend it enough for rub they use on those baby back ribs.

Sitting at The Smoke Shack in Milwaukee I was seated with another couple talking BBQ. The gentleman highly recommended Smoque and after some research a small group of us went down there. We got there nice and early and were among the first in line to get in. I got half slab of St. Louis Ribs, Smoked Sausage, Chopped Brisket, Beans and Mac and Cheese. Their BBQ Sauce that is offered is good. I kept finding myself going back to it. The ribs were tougher then I thought they would be. When attempting to pull the bone away from the meat or remove a portion by hand there was a lot of resistance. It was one of those moments where if it would have given way I may have clocked the guy next to me. Another in my party commented on the toughness of the Ribs. The smoked sausage was good. Nothing I haven't had elsewhere though. The chopped brisket is a good choice if you want to sample the sauce in my opinion. It serves as a vehicle for the sauce to be consumed. Eating this by itself tends to get tiresome as the bites ware on. I found myself wishing I would have had the sliced brisket. The Beans were fair and the Mac and Cheese was standard that you find at more popular restaurants. Everywhere I go the waitstaff usually comments on and highly recommends the mac. Everywhere I go it typically all comes out the same. I mean really folks... its noodles and cheese and only so many combinations of the two. I would come back and get a different cut of ribs. I would also get the sliced brisket then update this review to reflect that. As it stands now I wasn't overly impressed. It was good BBQ but not really worth the drive. I am sure Chi has other joints that I'll be checking out when i am down there next.

The people are so friendly and generous I almost don't want to give it a one star for food so I will give them a 2. 蔍 personally almost choked on how dry the barbecue was. 蔍 am thankful we have a barbecue place out here called Al's Barbecue Shack in DeKalb, IL. 蔠ho knew we had such a good thing in my neck of the woods! 蔍 drove about 1 1/2 to dine at this pretty cool chipotle set up establishment because I saw it on TV and they did have the friendliest people you will meet. 蔅ut the meat just didn't do it for me I'm sorry Guy Fiere you are WRONG once again. 蔉irst it was with Nasty Nana's in Bridgeport and now Smoque which rhymes with choke, which I literally almost did and yes I do chew my food but not ike a grazing cow so maybe it was just an off day. 蔍 wasn't going to say anything that day since the owner was next to me talking to the owner of Urban Belly and he seemed pretty excited delighting him in his food.

These guys know how to do BBQ right. Until I found Smoque I had been disappointed with all the BBQ I'd tried in Chicago. I went to Ribfest last month and tried half a dozen different ribs - none of them did it for me. I finally decided to email my favorite BBQ place back home in the south (a place that has won national awards for its ribs and has spoiled me) to see if they knew of any good BBQ places in Chicago and they recommended Smoque. Now I don't claim to be a rib expert, but I do know the difference between Kansas City and Memphis style, and I know that the meat should be tender but not falling off the bone, and it should be flavorful but not overpowered by sauce. Smoque's Memphis-style baby backs have all those bases covered. The chopped and sliced brisket and pulled pork sandwiches are hearty and tender and the sauce is perfect - subtle, flavorful, and not too sweet. I haven't had all the sides but the seasoned fries and cornbread are delicious. You can tell by the long lines that this place is not a trade secret. Luckily Smoque is a well oiled machine, and despite their high volume, everyone has been friendly and they never "act" rushed, if that makes any sense. In fact, one time recently I realized once I got to the restaurant to pick up my order that I forgot my wallet at home, and the owners immediately told me not to worry about it and were more than happy to give me a free meal (although I had my credit card number memorized and insisted on paying...but the gesture was very nice on their part.) I should mention that I've only ever gotten carryout at Smoque - they do have tables (indoor and outdoor) but it's only self-service and BYOB. My only frustration is that Smoque is so far away from where I live...otherwise I'd be eating here way more often.

OK, so I have heard so much about Smoque that I finally got to try it today for lunch since I was working in the area. I had the 1/2 and 1/2 platter with brisket and pulled pork with a side of fries and mac and cheese. The brisket was good but It was not the best I have had. Many people on here did not like the fries. I thought the fries were crispy and good. The mac and cheese was OK but then again I am from a family that has been making REAL MAC AND CHEESE for decades. First I have to say that I have had alot of BBQ in my life from my family and restaurants. To be honest since I have family members that have been cooking BBQ for decades I have not found any place that I feel is as good as what my family makes. I am not here to bash Smoque but just give my opinion of what my taste buds like. I grew up on the south side of the city so I can assure you that there are quite a few BBQ joints that are really good. 蔜he difference between Smoque and other BBQ joints is that the real BBQ joints have just a few tables and maybe some stools but most of the time you have to stand and eat. 蔄lso Smoque has the power of advertising and yelp definitely helps. Real neighborhood joints don't advertise, you either know about them or you don't. Also lets face it, a lot of people will not go to the south side. Hyde Park is as far as some people go or have ever been. With that being said people are really missing good BBQ in the city. I thought Smoque was decent and I think it is a welcome addition to the North side for BBQ. Keep in mind that this is just my opinion. I would never bash a restaurant because I think that we all have different taste buds. I had a place in North Chicago/Waukegan area called Big Ed's and let me tell you that I loved Big Ed's better than Smoque but I am sure that there are people who would go to Big Ed's and say that it was just ok and they like Smoque better. So just go and decide yourself whether or not it is good BBQ.

Dang. That's five star barbecue. I mean, holy shit, that was good. My buddy and I sat down to what looked like an immensity of meat, and plowed through like it was nothing. I usually don't eat beef, but that brisket was some of the best beef I have tasted. It wasn't exactly a blur, but it went down so fast and easy and good. I'm 蕇ure it's all been said here, but I do wanna shout out to the young guy hanging out by the seats, making sure everyone was taken care of and tables were cleaned properly. I'm sure it's a bottom-of-the-totem-pole position. I wouldn't say he was happy. But he did a good job, and he added an extra note of attentive professionalism to an overall superb dining experience.

The Brisket and The Ribs do get 5 stars..the place, not so much...The long lines are a drag, the way the push you around in there is something else. They will tell you where and when to be seated. It is one thing when the place is busy perhaps, but they always do this. It is VERY ANNOYING. The slaw is not creamy, more of a vinegar based shredding of cabbage. Not a fan of that. You can get cornbread instead, which is what I suggest... Back to the rules of this place...see the picture I posted here. Kind of says it all.Since they know they are the real deal when it comes to Ribs and Brisket, guess they can get away with an attitude. �They have the best ribs and brisket around Chicago, but if you want a better dining experience and the same good ribs and brisket, just go to Que in LaGrange...it is the same..without the BS.

Best brisket in Chicago and the best restaurant operations in the city - it could be a Kellogg business case study. You order food at the counter and magically by the time your food is ready a table is available (even for a party of 5 on a Friday night). 蔍 was very impressed with the timing and efficiency of it all. Back to the food, I really enjoyed the mac n' cheese - definitely my favorite side. 蔍t was real cheese and had a good crumb topping. 蔜he brisket is very tender and pairs really well with the BBQ sauce. 蔜he ribs were good, but the brisket is the best. BYOB as well - couldn't be better. 蔜hey have (plastic) cups and a wine bottle opener if you are so inclined.

I have never given a restaurant 5 stars, but this one deserves it. This has to be the BEST bbq place in Chicago/Northwest Suburbs. I am a huge fan of bqq and believe that this is as good as it gets (close to home anyway). The place is a little small and the line can get farely long but it is well worth the wait. There isnt much room to sit inside either and the tables are close together so get ready to sit next to someone you dont know. The ribs are incredible and just put you over the top. When I dont have a lot of time I usually get the 1/2 pulled pork 1/2 brisket (sliced) sandwich, coleslaw and fries. Also an amazing choice. The pulled pork is tender and has a sweet and sassy bbq sauce. Macaroni and cheese is a delicious side as well if thats more to your liking. If you have room left over for desert, definetely try the peach cobbler, taste's like its from Georgia (if youve ever tried it). Absolutel must go!!!

Before I get into the meat of this review (get it?) I'd like to dedicate it to my very tall friend Jim. 蔠ithout his guidance and insistance on making me fat I probably would never have tried Smoque. Smoque obviously is doing something right, 1307 reviews and 4.5 stars makes that pretty clear. 蔜he food was good, the service was friendly, and the dining room is nice and clean (read: not sticky). �I had the 1/2 & 1/2 pulled pork and sliced brisket with cole slaw, fries, and beans. 蔇on't worry, I had no intention of eating all of that, but I wanted to try it all. 蔜he pulled pork and brisket were both very good, either would make a fantastic sandwich. 蔜he cole slaw and fries were also good. 蔛omething just wasn't quite right about the beans though, they were too sweet I think. 蔛kip the beans, you won't miss 'em. It's a counter service place, which works efficiently here. 蔠hen I got there they were pretty much empty, by the time I was leaving there was a line to the door, so go on off peak times if you don't want to wait. �The food was worth it if you're nearby or it's on your way. 蔍 don't know that I'd go too far out of my way to get some Smoque BBQ.

All winter long I had heard of Smoque BBQ: first on the Food Network and next on "Check Please!" When the weather started to turn, the call of barbeque was simply too strong to resist. 蔍 started looking for excuses to travel to Irving Park to gorge myself on sumptuous barbeque. 蔍 finally got my chance this last week. When my girlfriend and I walked into Smoque, we were immediately greeted by a friendly staff person who helped us place our order and reserved a place for us to sit. 蔍 thought that this was a nice touch, since it seems that Smoque can get crowded in a hurry. We ordered the Texas brisket, pulled pork, and a half-slab of St. Louis ribs. 蔠e also ordered baked beans, cornbread, and macaroni and cheese as sides. Let's start with the good. 蔜he brisket was cooked perfectly. 蔕ne thing that I really liked is that the meats were not drowned in barbeque sauce a priori. 蔜he sauce is given separately for the diner to freely decide how much or how little he wants to use. 蔄s a person who wants to taste the meat above all else, I really applaud Smoque for this decision. �The sides were also pretty good. 蔜he mac and cheese was the standout among the sides we ordered. 蔜he beans were altogether too sweet for my taste--so much so that I couldn't eat more than one bite. Now, for the bad. 蔜he brisket, while cooked perfectly, was under-seasoned. 蔜he pulled pork and ribs were very disappointing: both were severely dry. 蔒y girlfriend almost choked on the pulled pork because it was so difficult to swallow. 蔅oth the pulled pork and the ribs were a far cry from the best that I've ever had. I am so sad to say that I cannot recommend Smoque because of the quality of the food. 蔜he service and prices are spot on, but they really need to put some work into perfecting their barbeque. Food: 2/5 Service: 5/5 Price: 4/5

Best BBQ I've had in Chicago. 蔄nd I take my BBQ seriously. I saw Buddy Garrity eating brisket on Friday Night Lights and suddenly got the itch for some good BBQ. Yelp reviews led me to Smoque, and the itch was scratched. Meats: There was a classic red smoke ring in all the meats, but they remained amazingly moist. 蔈verything melted in your mouth. 蔈xcellent dry rub. 蔇elicious sauce. �Sides: The Mac & Cheese was cheesy - not watery and bland like most places. 蔜he beans had an amazing BBQ flavor. 蔜he slaw was a refreshing complement - not a mayo-drenched blob. Tips: - Expect to wait in line. 蔠e got there at 8pm on a Saturday and waited for 40 minutes. 蔠ELL WORTH IT THOUGH. 蔍f you get there a little later, you'll wait less. 蔣ou order at the counter, then someone eventually seats you. - BYOB! - Call ahead and carry out. 蔣ou can skip the line. You can eat well for about $12. 蔍 can't wait to head back!

This place is so good. I can see why people trek to it. Just off the Blue Line makes it pretty easy to. Lucky for me I live a couple blocks away. I have to will myself not to go in there all the time. I think my favorite is the brisket, but the ribs are great too. The BBQ sauce is amazing. I like all the sides. The slaw is refreshingly real and light. Really good. So is the cornbread. I could order a whole meal of just that.

I was told by numerous people that Smoques had the best brisket they've ever had. I'm convinced it's because those people never had good brisket. Smoques meats are in fact tender. They cook them for 15 hours so they can't screw that up. But they're pretty flavorless. I mean I couldn't tell if was eating the beef or the napkin. It wouldn't have been so bad if they had better BBQ sauce. I guess that's a thing of preference, as the person I was with appreciates vinegar based sauce and I'm more fond of tomato based sauces as they have more flavor. And something strong was needed to help this poor beef. The pulled pork was nothing to write home about. I've made better pulled pork in my oven. The sides were decent. The mac and cheese was pretty good, but they give it to you in a container the size of a bottle cap. The fries were hard and over-cooked. The links were okay, once again nothing special. Overall, not horrible, but definitely overrated. I have no desire to go back. I have yet to enjoy any of the hyped chicago eateries that everyone seem to enjoy.

I'd seen Smoque featured on a TV show highlighting the best BBQ joints in America a couple years ago and since I love ribs I was so excited to try it out when I finally stumbled across it while returning from my favorite Filipino restaurant. 蔍t was a huge letdown after the hype I'd seen on the TV show. 蔜he food was just ok and 蕂verpriced for what you get. 蔜here were 3 of us and not a single one of us was impressed. 蔄t the prices they charge they really need to be serving great ribs and not just ok ones. 蔠ill I return in the future? 蔍t's pretty unlikely since there have got to be a hundred really good BBQ joints in this fine city so I'm off to search on Yelp for someplace else with outstanding ribs. 蔍f you do decide to try this place go in with low expectations and hopefully you'll be pleasantly surprised and find out that we just hit them on a bad day.

Smoque gets 5 stars because not only is everything on their menu delishible but they have "seaters" who find you a table and reassure you that when your food is ready, you will be able to sit. This is huge. It's like Hot Dougs in that respect, which to me shows you care about your customers. My biggest pet peeve is people who sit down to save a seat for their group before the group has ordered their food. So people who have already ordered but don't have someone to save a seat have to stand around and wait. Don't do this, you are an asshole if you do this. Their ribs are incredible, their brisket is incredible, their sausage is incredible, their pulled pork is incredible and their chicken is incredible. Their sides are the real stars though. I'd be just as satisfied eating a giant portion of their brisket chilli or french fries as I would their main dishes. It's BYOB, the line moves fast, and the afformentioned "seaters" don't fire up your order until you have a seat. And they have a list of who came in what order so it's a very orderly dining experience.

This is the top reviewed BBQ place in Chicago and locals love it. 蔠e got a small sampling of their ribs, brisket, links, pulled pork, and chicken. �The links and chicken were forgettable, but the pulled pork is great. 蔠e made stops for the best BBQ places in Chicago, St Louis, and Kansas City, and we felt that they had the best pulled pork of the places we visited. 蔜he meat was juicy and it had good smoke flavor. �People love their ribs and I have to be honest - our first rack of their ribs was terrible. 蔜his rack was dry and, though there was a discernible smoke ring, the smokey flavor wasn't deep. 蔠e had a second rack of their ribs and it had a little more tenderness and flavor. 蔅ut our impression was heavily biased by that first rack of ribs. I would not recommend the brisket as it was dried out. 蔕n my barbeque adventure through the Midwest, we have to admit that Smoque wasn't high on our list of places to check out. 蔅ut it fared pretty well when it compared to the best of St. Louis and Kansas City, which are towns that take pride in their BBQ.

Yummmm! I loved pulled pork but their brisket is out of this world...just melts in ur mouth. I been here twice so far. Each time its been busy and crowded but they have a nice line system and ur food is ready by the time u get a plate. Def recommend the mac n cheese. It comes in the little metal tins, perfect side, I get them both as two side options. I had the BBQ beans, they are good, but I prefer my beans sweet, if you prefer them smokey, then get them! I have yet to try the ribs, but they are next on my list! I like the sweet BBQ sauce not the vinegar 蔮ased one. But u have to ask for it. Staff is great one of the owner walks the floor..even gave us free cobbler after we turned in a wallet that was left behind! Great place..once is never enough ;) Only issue is parking, be prepared!

I just visited a Texas BBQ place this week, which reminded that I better get this review in. And, let me tell you, you WANT to hear about this place. Wowser! This is literally effing fantastic BBQ! No, better than that...BBQ nirvana! Yep, nirvana about describes it. You have GOT to go!! Let me give you a few logistics before I talk about the crazy good food. First, you need to BYOB, so go by Trader Joe's or Binny's or Whole Foods and buy beer. Get a good micro-brew because this place deserves it. Second, go EARLY! They sell out. Having been there many, many times, I can tell you that they sell out often of the good stuff. Third, don't let the line scare you. They move that line pretty quick. Yes, the darn line goes out the door and down the block sometimes, and, while I hate waiting, I always beg my hubby to let us stand in this line. Even in the winter, and if you knew how much I hate, hate, hate the Chi-town winters, you would understand what a sacrifice that is for me. The place will usually be PACKED when you finally get in the door. But, don't worry. They will find a table for you by the time your order is ready. Just go ahead and place your order, stand where they tell you to and the owner will tell you when and where to sit. Just do it. It's a privilege to be in there. Now, the food. I'll start with a disclaimer, as a native South Floridian, I didn't really know good BBQ from bad. I mean, we're known for not knowing how to vote, and not for our BBQ. But I married a Texan. (Yeah, girls, be jealous, they know how to grow them in Texas.) And, my Texan knows BBQ. So, an endorsement from him is a big deal. He LOVES this place. They make this beef brisket by smoking long and low. It gets this lovely smoke ring all around, and the flavor is to die for. Then they get their sausages from Mikeska's. Texans will know what that means because Mikeska's is a Texas institution. They know their sausage. And, Smoque gets it from them. (The sausage is a big sellout early in the evening, so try before 7 pm for that). And, the cornbread! Oh, man! Sweet but not like cake. Moist. With little pieces of real corn. Love it. Then, they make their baked beans in house. With their own recipe. And they put chopped beef brisket in the baked beans! Oh, my stomach growls and my mouth waters just writing about it. Chi-town, how I will miss those beans! The hubby likes the mac and cheese. He's a big mac and cheese eater and he likes the one made here. Lastly, one of the owners is usually in the kitchen, while the other one helps keep the line flowing smoothly and the seating arranged. Just go! You won't regret it! (Unless you are a vegetarian...then stay away.)

Don't be thrown by the Q and the U - Smoque may be run by white men and targeted towards the Yelp crowd, but it's an unassuming place with top notch barbecue and delicious sides. I stopped in on Saturday for a late second lunch, with Michael K., Janice K., her sister, and her sister's roommate. 蔜he place was neither full nor empty at 4 in the afternoon - we enjoyed our food in good company, but without an attendant wait. 蔍 liked the casual bare bones feel of the place. 蔍t felt welcoming in a neighborhood lunch stop kind of way. 蔠e ordered at the counter and took our place at a communal table. 蔜he cashier was pleasant enough, and the food came out fast. After some strategizing, we put in a big order for our party of five, accounting for three of us who already had bellies full of hot dogs. 蔠e ordered brisket, a half rack of St. Louis style ribs, a taste of pulled pork, and a sausage, with sides of cole slaw, BBQ beans, brisket chili, macaroni and cheese, and cornbread, and a little peach cobbler for dessert. 蔜his feast, about enough to feed three hungry people, cost a little over $40 with sodas. Everything was delicious. 蔜he ribs were smokey and very tender, but meaty enough to give a satisfying resistance when I sank in my teeth. 蔜hey were painted in sauce, but not drenched, so the flavor of the meat remained supreme. 蔜he pulled pork was superb, moist and flavorful, smoked for hours and pulled apart by hand. 蔜he brisket was not quite as good as the first two, but this was just preference - it was faultless, with a delicate texture usually reserved for fattier cuts of meat. 蔜he sausage was great, thick and full of flavor and spices, with a good level of snap. 蔠e got two barbecue sauces to slather on our meats as we pleased. 蔕ne was thicker and sweeter, the other a bit runnier with a vinegar tang. 蔅oth were delicious, and I actually loved mixing them together. The sides were as impressive as the meat, and they made our barbecue session into a complete feast. 蔍 loved the mac and cheese. 蔍t was very cheesy with a touch of creaminess and a nice crispy topping of bread crumbs. 蔜he beans were among some of the best I've had, full of flavor with a far cooked but toothsome texture. 蔜he brisket chili was likewise fantastic, deeply comforting with nice shreds of meat. 蔜he cole slaw was the only light side on the table, and it was refreshingly easy on the mayo, with crisp clean flavors to cut through the smoke and fat of our meal. 蔜he cornbread was the one side I stopped eating after a bite. 蔔ot bad, but not good, a little hard and a little short on butter. We finished with the mini peach cobbler, and I wouldn't leave without tasting this tiny $2.25 treat. 蔍t was more of a crumble than a cobbler, mostly peaches and sugar under a little bit of crunchy crust. 蔍t was sweet and fruity, with a softened fruit texture. 蔄 couple spoonfuls made a nice cap to a meaty meal. I admit I'm no expert, but Smoque provided some of the best barbecue I've had in recent memory. 蔍t was comforting and delicious, and if it were in my town, I'd take advantage of it as often as my body allowed.

It was good que The brisket chili is worth coming to smoque for But the brisket is not the best, but ok The baked beans were also ok The brisket , beans, and sauce were slightly bland The beans and sauce were overly sweet When considering BBQ outside of the capitals of KC,Memphis,Texas, and the Carolina's Smoque is probably a four star, but when compared to the capitals it falls short

For the variety and types of q you probably can't beat Smoque. 蔠e got a bunch of different types of q to share which include: a rack of St. Louis style ribs, 1lb of sliced brisket, Texas Sausage, with sides of mac and cheese, beans, chilli and slaw. �The smoke flavor in the meat was fantastic, strong yet subtle, flavorful yet not overpowering. 蔜he ribs had a real nice rub on them that stood up alone and the bbq sauce was just a nice accent to the meat. 蔜hey were not fall of the bone tender yet they were very tender. 蔍 actually prefer my q to have a little chew to it so I enjoyed the ribs that way. 蔜he brisket once again had great smoke flavor and was fall apart tender and super flavorful. 蔒y only complaint about the brisket which is just matter of taste is I thought it was a little too fall apart tender, I do prefer to have a little more texture to my meat. 蔅ut nonetheless it was great. 蔜he sausages were good but nothing to write home about. �Smoque would be a 5 star review if it weren't for the sides. 蔍t's not that the sides weren't good it's just they seemed to be overlooked. 蔜hey were super small portions even for the large, and when I think of having a bbq it entails huge ass portions of sides. 蔍 want to be able to get big ass buckets of beans, slaw, etc. �Also I felt having the mac and cheese in the metal ramekins gave it a metallic taste which I did not enjoy. Overall if you are looking for some killer q Smoque is a good stop. 蔍f you are looking to have sides with the q I may look elsewhere to get your side, unless they start to serve some bigger portions.

This place claimed to have "Southern-style bbq," and being a Southerner, I thought "I'll be the judge." Well, let me tell you....this is Smack-yo-mama bbq. It is wonderful! As soon as I walked in the door the first time, I thought to myself, "This smells like home." Usually, bbq is reserved for cookouts, and July 4th-like holidays. But this place makes it completely accessible all the time. The classic pulled pork sandwich is what I got, and my friend got the brisket. Both...UH-MA-ZING! And their slaw is SO good. I mean...SOOOOO good. Take it from a Southerner...go there, and go there, and go there.

Damn that Brisket was great, I gave it an B+ :) mac and cheese good B+ :) baked beans good B+ :) corn bread was good as well. they didn't have much on their liquid 蕇election. I didn't care for the coleslaw :( it had way too much vinegar and onion. 蔍 also didn't care for be set up as far as how are you order and pick up, when you dine-in. it's a very small place for the magnitude of customers, looking forward to hopefully them opening up a bigger location. 蔕verall yes I 蔳ive Smoque 4 $tars :) I definitely would recommend and return 蕀yself.

I know that people probably wonder if this place lives up to its hype, but I think that it does. Coming from Michigan, I always make sure my trips to Chicago include a trip into Smoque. And, I will say that it never disappoints. Went there with a group of friends this past weekend who all left fans of this place. I highly recommend the brisket. I always get it and I'm always happy. Two of the guys got the 1/2 and 1/2 sandwich, which is half pulled pork and half brisket. They both loved the sandwich. The mac and cheese at this place is pretty decent, but the baked beans are better. The other thing I would suggest is that if you're like me and you're into spice- ask for the spicy barbeque sauce and the pickled jalapenos. I never KNEW how much this would up the flavor factor of my sandwich until I slathered this BBQ sauce and topped the jalapenos...I will never go back to a plain brisket sandwich here. The only thing I would suggest? A place to take naps :) Cause I really needed one after having a very full belly.

Anytime you see a line out the door for food - eat there. People don't want to wait for ANYTHING, but most humans are intelligent enough to understand the concept of a worthy sacrifice. Fortunately the line wasn't out the door like I have seen, but there was enough of a line for people behind and in front of us to complain incessantly. The staff is prepared for the long lines, so if you can't deal with waiting and sitting next to strangers, do us all a favor and eat somewhere else. Four of us first-timers went for lunch yesterday - and it was tip top. I've always been a pulled pork guy but I went brisket and it was a very wise choice. Perhaps the ribs would have been even wiser but I am no Jedi yet. 蔒ac and cheese was above average, barbecue beans were amazing, cornbread was spot on. BBQ joints keep a line coming for their meats though - and Smoque's is some of the best anywhere.

My daughter and I saw this on Check Please and decided to check it out for real. I don't know much about great BBQ but I do know that was the best damn mac n cheese and BEANS I have ever tasted. The husband is picky about ribs but he was happy as can be, he said they were the best ribs he's had. I don't think my daughter said one word the whole meal, it was that good. I recommend the brisket, seems like that was everyones favorite. I was super impressed with their crowd management. My husband hates waiting in line so we tricked him into going here even though we knew there would be a wait. On a Saturday night at about 7:30 we waited outside for about 15 minutes. Once we got inside I was a little worried because this place is tiny. Every seat was taken and lots of people in line still. They asked us how many we needed to seat and I have no idea how they did it but they seated us as soon as our food was ready, and everyone else in line too. Amazing! The owner was standing at the door. When we left he asked us how it was and thanked us for coming. I love that, espcially since we drove over an hour just to try his restaurant, it's nice to be appreciated!

Best BBQ in Chicago...and realy one of the best in the country. 蔍 have been to BBQ joints throughout the U.S. (St. L, KC, Texas, and more) and this ranks up there with the best of them. 蔜heir brisket is incredible, memphis-style BBQ sauces are great, and the sides are tops too. 蔍 reccomend for sides the Mac & cheese and french fries as two of the best. 蔄lways be prepared to wait as the lines are always very long for this great BBQ. 蔣ou wait in line to order and get a table shortly after ordering and then the food is ready not long after that- the wait is the wait to order which they space out nicely.

I could definitely smell and taste the smoke and me likey! We ordered brisket, ribs, coleslaw, fries, and macaroni and cheese for about $25. We were greeted and served by the owner, which was a treat. He took the time to really explain all four sauces before me. M declared them to be truly spectacular. So here's the deal. You know from all the other reviews that the food at Smoque is delicious. No contest there! I especially liked the coleslaw, which tasted kinda like this Asian cabbage salad with Ramen Noodle topping. M said that my dad makes better ribs. I thought the brisket was yum yum yummy, but M thought it was too fatty. I wasn't the biggest fan of the macaroni and cheese... The noodles were too soft. The service was also amazing. All of the employees seemed happy (not quite Trader Joe level, but close) to be there and the owner was friendly, but not overbearing. We ordered at the counter (with gentle suggestions from the owner) and then were told where to sit. In a few minutes, our food was brought to us. The tables were clean. This is our major complaint about Smoque. It was not overly busy the rainy, Wednesday evening we went (not like the descriptions of other reviewers). Yet, people were still seated, cafeteria-style, right next to one another. Literally. I could move my elbow a few inches and jab my neighbors on either side of me! It was noisy. M and I could not have a conversation. That characteristic alone is enough to keep us away from Smoque. After all, if we're going to travel out of our way for food, we'd like to savor the experience with a dollop of conversation.

While this doesn't compare to Kansas City BBQ, I give them huge props for what they deliver in Chicago. First, this place is BYOB. So nice. Second, they do a great job of moving the line, getting people sat, getting food out, etc. Finally, the food is good- you get a lot of the $$ and even the sides are worth it. The mac and cheese is a must try, I was also a fan of the corn bread. As for meat, I thought the brisket was the best I tried, but I definitely need to get back there to try the ribs, I know I'm missing out!

So....I really really really wanted this to be a 5-star review. 蔛orry Smoque, I just couldn't do it. 蔛moque is the reason I implemented the "would I bring out of town guests here" to some of my reviews...because...and I'm sorry to say it, I wouldn't... So, on with it... Pros: - Good BBQ, fresh, juicy - Pretty good sauce...but not my favorite, but still good - They seem to have other sauces (how can I try them?) - BYO - SUPER friendly staff - Value is good - Mac and cheese! Cons; - Location - Parking - Food was good, but I didn't find it spectacular. �- I don't love the cafeteria vibe...good for lunch, not so for dinner - I would like way more sauce - Fries...look delicious...not so much I wouldn't bring people out here, but I would get take out...I'm not sure I'd stop in for dinner, but it's an ok spot for lunch. 蔒y 4 stars are basically for food quality, but I do like other spots a tad better. 蔛orry Smoque!

ZZZZzzzzzzz.....zzzzzz.....zzzz....zz.... Oh, sorry. Just ate 12 lbs. of bbq from Smoque. Scientists have accounted for close to 100% of the human body. However there is a small percentage unaccounted for. Many believe this is the human soul. I believe this is the human beings passion for BBQ. Or perhaps a combination of both. OR, are they the same thing? I digress, Smoque makes some damn good Q. I was fortunate enough to get here before the busy crowd (about 5:45-6:00 on a Friday). Instantly after I placed my order, there was a line reaching the door. The facts. St.Louis Ribs. Bomb diggidy. Big ol' smoke ring (the pink lining under the skin for newbies). They remove the translucent skin underneath the rib, hate when places don't do that. Hugs the bone gently, doesn't fall off the bone (that's a no-no, again for you newbs). Sliced brisket, that's one BIG OHHH YEAHHH! Masterfully cooked with and almost pillowy texture. No sauce needed. Pulled pork's good, but I'd prefer a vinegar based sauce for PP (can't all get what we want though). We forgot to order the Texas sausage, nooooooooo.... The sides. Coleslaw is one of the best. Love the dressing the use. So-so beans. Comforting mac and cheese (i like the serving dish, to-go that is). Excellent cornbread and one mighty good peach cobbler. Smoque knows their BBQ. Splurge, enjoy yourself, and have some of the best BBQ you can get your hands on in our beloved city.

It's not hard to believe that Smoque BBQ is one of the highest reviewed places in Chicago on Yelp. 蔒y family and I went here for dinner the Saturday after Thanksgiving. 蔠e had to wait outside because the line was kind of long and pretty busy. 蔐uckily Smoque supplies umbrellas for those waiting outside because it was raining. �A few minutes later we were inside and waiting to order. 蔜he decor is nice, with the articles about Smoque from the New York Times as well as the Food Network from when Diners, Drive-ins and Dives came to film. 蔠e got up to the counter and ordered. 蔍 got the Pulled Pork Sandwich with a side of Mac 'N Cheese. 蔠e moved out of the way and waited for the staff to find us a table for 7 people. �The Pulled Pork was the best Texas style that I have had! 蔍t was the perfect ratio of Pulled Pork to sauce. 蔜he Mac 'N Cheese was also great. 蔣ou can't go wrong with any of the food at Smoque BBQ. �My family headed outside to wait for my brother to bring the car around because of the rain. 蔜he owner happened to walk outside to tell us we could wait inside, if we wanted to. 蔠e ended up standing around the front talking about the restaurant and how the business runs. 蔋e also explained how Smoque ended up with an article in the New York Times and the reason behind the umbrellas. �Smoque was a great experience. 蔍 look forward to going back soon.

We were expecting really great BBQ based on all the things we had heard about this place, but it didn't live up to the elevated expectations. 蔍t's good BBQ but not great. 蔠e sadly didn't get to try the brisket, which is what we went for, because they screwed up our order and we didn't realize until we got home. 蔜he pulled pork was good but a bit dry and the St. Louis Ribs were even drier. 蔜he cornbread was baked in little individual cups and ended up getting soggy in it's own steam. 蔒ight go back to actually try the brisket, but otherwise not a repeat place for us.

Going to Smoque for BBQ is like going to the south side for blues. As a white, middle class suburban kid, this is an adventure! Fortunately, they're about 6 inches off of the Kennedy on Pulaski, so that's lowers the anxiety a bit. But then you pull in and the street seems full of signs that basically say, "If you're a Smoque customer, don't even THINK of parking here!" In fact, I think some of the signs said EXACTLY that. But after a bit of roaming around, we found a parking spot that didn't appear to have a "TOW ZONE" sign in effect -- at that moment. With that friendly neighborhood greeting, we walked into Smoque. It's nothing special to look at on the outside, and not much better inside. There's a wall-covering blackboard with the menu, but it's starting to fade out, making it hard for noobs like us to decipher. Fortunately, my brother is a regular here, so I didn't need the menu. Even at 1:30pm on a Wednesday afternoon, the place is jammed. The line is not out the door, and that's something. We order, a kid on the floor asks uhow many are in our party, and what our order numbers are. Every table is jammed and it looks like we're going to eat standing up. 15 minutes or less later, as the kitchen nears our number, the kid shows us to 4 seats, conveniently located in the corner and near the pop machine --perfect for me! 3 minutes later, our food comes out. I order the sweet jalapenos and head back to the table. My first mouthful of chopped brisket is, well, awesome! Lots of smoke, crunchy crust, great beef taste, subtle complex BBQ sauce and perfect moisture. Cole slaw and fries are both really good, as are the beans. I agree with my bro -- the brisket is the choice here, but my wife's pulled pork sandwich was great -- and the 1/2 sandwich was just the right size for her appetite. We didn't feel rushed, even with 30+ people standing in the aisles waiting for a table. Overall, this place runs great -- they should give crowd management lessons to some other restaurants that will remain nameless. And to all my fellow melanin-challenged white kids out in suburbia, it's okay, nothing to worry about here -- c'mon down!

Really delicious BBQ. 蔛mall dive-y joint a little far outside of the city, but worth the trip and the wait. 蔠e brought my suburban dad here who was initially skeptical about the BYOB factor and having to wait in a line that wrapped outside the building (and on a weeknight, no less) but even he seemed more than satisfied to finally sit down and eat good BBQ while drinking the beer of his choice. 蔅etween the 4 of us we tried a little bit of everything and everyone left full and nobody left disappointed.

Smoque has amazing BBQ but get ready for the ambiance of an Army mess hall with a fraternity party (at least the night we went). When we arrived at the restaurant where there was plenty of easy to find street parking in the area (about 8 on a Friday) there was still a line out the door. After waiting about 30 minutes being jostled and pushed by people cutting the line for various reasons (usually they would get a "line holder" then the rest of the party would try to push their way to the front through a narrow passage). Once we got to the front a guy ask us how many were in our party so he could find us a table, we ordered and paid (they only had one register open on a Friday Night with the line going out the door) then were taken to a table. The restaurant itself was mass chaos, there were groups of very loud, obnoxious post-college types swigging vodka from plastic bottles, screaming, yelling etc. etc. I thought I was at a college fraternity party. The whole experience probably would have been more tolerable if I could have got a drink myself but Smoque does not have a liquor license. When we got our food (it took about 15 minutes) the portions were gigantic! (An amazingly large portion for the price) and living up to the restaurants reputation the BBQ is great! I got the brisket that was perfectly smoked, the sauce added the right amount of flavor, and the sides (especially the mac and cheese) were equally tasty. I consider myself somewhat of a cole slaw expert and the slaw at Smoque was some of the best I have had in a while, it was vinegar based, tangy and really flavorful (if you order the platter it is included so you can get two additional sides!). �My advice would be to get carry-out of this amazing BBQ or eat in the restaurant on a non-weekend night when it is less chaotic.

It's 5pm where to go for sime great BBQ? Smoque that's where. It's our first time here and it was amazing. 1st street parking is a must. Park on Pulaski if possible. 2nd when you walk in and not sure what to order? No problem the owner is more than happy to meet and greet you at the door and help you pick out something you'll love to eat. The food well unless you try it for yourself I cant explain it except WOW. Definitely one of the best places in Chicago if the Best for BBQ. P.S. If there's a line outside the door to get in, belive me it's well worth the wait.

Ugh! Don't go here. This place is horrible. No really you won't like it. ;-) I went here with high expectations. The food was described as exceptional (it is) The service is a mix of utilitarian but attentive. (more on this later) Okay the truth now. You probably want to go here early. Okay for you readers sans wee ones early likely means 7PM. You will be in for a long wait. Think Seinfeld's Soup Nazi without the insults. So yeah fair warning. We were there early by our standards and by the time we left at 5PM the line was already wrapping out the restaurant on a freezing day. The food is delish and uncomplicated. They do BBQ and they do it well. They do nothing else. The service for a cafeteria style place is superb. These guys are helpful to a fault. I don't know how they'd keep this up later into the night but we felt like we had servers at our beckon call. Again this may have been a function of our arrival time. The only terrible thing is that I only learned about this a few months ago. Time to make up for lost time. Also, they cater y'all! If you plan on eating there I recommend a crispy lager (Metropolitan). I've clearly been doing my BBQ wrong because there was a flavor war when I paired it with a Belgian Strong Dark Ale.

I don't even like BBQ..... Smoque is just that good. My hubby and I went to Smoque last Friday night. We got there about 6 and somehow missed the rush, because 30 mins later there wasn't even standing room. The staff is phenomenal. They keeps this place running like a well-oiled machine. 蔜he line can be intimidating, but there are several excellent wait staffers/busers/attendants/cooks that want to get you in the restaurant and fed. That always helps :) The food is flat out amazing. I had the brisket platter with fries and mac and cheese. It was so good. The brisket was so tender it fell apart when I was trying to stab it with a fork...maybe I should have used a spoon to dip it in the awesome sauce! The mac and cheese was perfect--not too creamy, cheese, or runny. Seriously awesome. The fries may have been some of the best I have had. I got my standard ketchup, salt, pepper---I didn't use any of it really. They were perfect. 蔍 did use one packet of ketchup to mix with the BBQ sauce and dip with the fries, that was excellent--but not necessary. And the coleslaw is delicious. It's more oil based than the creamy mayo based, which I loved. I cannot wait to bring my mom, in-laws, friends, etc. to Smoque. I know all my family members will love it.

Ordered: sliced brisket platter (brisket+mac&cheese+peach cobbler) = 12.45+tax. I came here because Smoque's the most reviewed BBQ place in Chicago. It's definitely not a fancy-smansy sit down place, though there are tables and we didn't have to wait too long to be seated. But who really cares that much about seating- I came for the food! Brisket: THE BEST brisket I've ever had. I'm wary of saying anything is the best in the city because I don't really plan to visit enough places for that statement to carry statistical value. However, it was amazingly tender and moist and melted in my mouth. I thought the portion was fair considering that BBQ is usually expensive. Next time I will probably just buy a straight pound of this stuff and forgo all the other food distractors. Mac&Cheese: I have to preface this by saying I'm not a big mac&cheese kinda guy. I never did the blue box stuff growing up, so cheese covered macaroni doesn't really bring up childhood memories. The mac&cheese here is baked and adequate, which is about as good as mac&cheese gets for me. Peach Cobbler: Again, no childhood connections for me. I thought it was pretty good. Overall, I considered Smoque a great value, which is really hard to find in a BBQ place in a major city... actually, it's probably because I'm a cheap bastard and I don't think many places offer good value ^_^ I enjoyed the relaxed atmosphere here and their commitment to amazing brisket. I will definitely be back!

Great food. 蔛ometimes Yelp hits one out of the park. 蔍 was visiting some good friends in Chicago and Yelp'd some BBQ places. 蔛moque looked good and off we went. 蔜he decor is bad. 蔆heap paint on the walls, cheap tables and chairs, and so what! 蔜he food is so good I wouldn't care if I had to sit on a cactus. 蔍 travel a lot, and these are my favorite ribs I can remember eating. 蔅BQ is a very personal thing and I'm sure that if you grew up on a certain kind of BBQ you can always find fault with BBQ that is done different then you are used to. 蔅ut don't be a sucka. 蔜his place is great. 蔙ibs, sausage, brisket, all good.

I didn't realize my wife posted a review until I logged on just now. We ate here Sunday night and I was just telling a co-worker about Smoque and my mouth literally started to water. I've been in most of the BBQ meccas around the US, and Smoque is right up there. 蔜he brisket was a great blend of tenderness, smoke and crust. I was very happy that the quality didn't fade through the day as we arrived with only 30 minutes left before closing. Kicking myself that it took me so long to eat there, especially since it is 8 blocks from our house. �I joked that we should bring our daughter there and tell her to have 蔛moque cater her wedding.

Amazing BBQ! 蔜he girlfriend and I had the brisket, sausage links, baby back ribs, mac & cheese(best I've ever had), baked beans and fries. 蔄LL were excellent! 蔖lace is not cheap, but portions are fair and the "treat yourself to kick ass BBQ every once in a while" experience is worth it. Place is A MADHOUSE at dinner time. 蔇o yourself a favor and go in during off peak hours, or call in for carryout (unless you enjoy 50 hungry people staring at you through the window trying to "Jedi Mind Trick" yo' ass into eating faster and getting the hell out so they can have your table...)

Now I have two favorite BBQ joints in Chicagoland. When I'm on the North side it will definitely be Smoque again. Let's start with the meats. I had the Rib Combo (both Baby Back and St. Louis). They were cooked to perfection. As a BBQ Judge I have become very spoiled with perfect ribs, and these are perfect ribs. The meat comes cleanly off the bone where you bite, but it does not "fall off the bone" when you take a bite. The bone dries immediately. That's a perfectly cooked rib. As for flavor, it was fabulous. I asked for the sauce on the side so that I could taste the meat, and it was heavenly. I added some sauce and it just made me happy. Both the Baby Back and the St. Louis ribs are awesome. My wife had the sliced Brisket. It, too was awesome. Just a little on the dry side, but nothing to complain about. She, too, had the sauce on the side, and if they would have put the sauce on the meat, it would have been perfect. The sides are great. We had Mac n' Cheese, Brisket Chili and Cornbread. The Slaw comes with the meal, too. They were all awesome. Mac n' Cheese was very cheesy, creamy, and not overcooked like many establishments. The Brisket Chili is almost as good as mine (seriously that is awesome Chili). Heavy on the Brisket, light on the beans. The Cornbread was sweet and moist, and delicious. And now the Slaw. Normally I like creamy Slaw, but this Slaw was fabulous. Sweet vinegar with red onions and cabbage. Simple, and simply divine. One thing I really like about both of my favorite 'Que places in town is the fact that the owners take an interest in the customers. Barry was out working the crowd, he apologized when our meal was taking a little longer than he liked. He followed up with everyone in the place, and when I asked for a little Pulled Pork to go, he got me some. All in all it was a very great visit. Now to that Pulled Pork. We live about 45 minutes away, so I knew the pork would be cold, but oh, how heavenly. The perfect amount of smoke, still very juicy, and tender. Again, not overcooked. Oh, and Saturday night at 5:00 in the rain didn't deter anyone. The place was packed. I will be back. I will definitely be back.

As Creative Director of The Agency in my mind, I try to come up with a good slogan for this place, like: "Meet me at Smoque, for Barbe-queue and a Coque." Or "Smoque really taques the caque where BBQ s concerned." Or how about: "It's no joque. This old bloque, he really liques Smoque." OK, so an ad man I am not. But seriously, Smoque is a most unpretentious spot for quality made-with-love BBQ, friendly uncomplicated service, and mouth-watering food at a reasonable price. Hit it mid-afternoon like we did on a Friday and you can skip the usual "queueing up." We were served lique it was a fast food 蔶oint. Love the brisket and pulled pork. Have not tried the ribs yet. I also lique the casual college town ambience. The painted cinder block walls, the hard cement floor and the utilitarian hard-edged furniture. You can get Taque-out, and the place is BYOB, too. For Pete's saque, if you haven't bean, maque haste, and get thee to Smoque. Queue or no queue, 蔵t's well worth the treque.

What constitutes a good rack (of ribs)? I'd say, flavor, texture, and the SAUCE. I've always been a fan of ribs, but ever since moving from Texas to California, I've never had a good slab of ribs that could compare. Anywhere. One of the three criteria were always off. Smoque BBQ on the other hand gets it done with flying colors. The flavor of the ribs could stand on its own, even without sauce. The texture isn't chewy and falls off the bone with one meek chomp. And now, the sauce... married with the ribs, it's pure perfection. The sauce has just the right amount of spice and the right amount of tang. It would be a sin to let a drop go to waste, and honestly it could probably stand on it's own in a glass with a silly straw. Now that's a nice rack. Saucy.

Being a Texas native, I'm a bit biased when it comes to BBQ. I like it flavorful (smoked, not drenched in sauce) along with some good sides. Smoque fits the bill for midwest bbq, however I will be trying some other BBQ restaurants to see what else is out there. We had the chopped brisket sandwich and the pulled pork. Both were good, and I would order the chopped brisket again, but the pulled pork just didn't taste too great. Their amazing spicy bbq sauce made up for this, however the meat doesn't stand out on it's own. Their sides are pretty delicious. I enjoyed their cole slaw, which held back on the mayo in favor of vinegar, a big plus in my book. Their mac and cheese was good, however I wish I would've ordered their fries, which on the plate next to me looked delicious! I would recommend the sliced brisket or the ribs here, they both looked good and when I return that's what I'll be having.

This is a review by a southerner & daughter of a BBQ enthusiast. Having lived across the South, I deem myself an authority on sweet tea- this place got it right. The darkness showed the steeping was done just right with just the amount of sugar to sweeten, not turn beverage into syrup. The brisket is on par with any that I've had in Texas. The beans were adequate but not my mother's. The "cobbler" was tasty but more of a crumble & not a cobbler (Smoque tops peaches with sweet, crispy, buttery oats-yum! but not cobbler).

WORTH THE WAIT. 蔅ring your appetite and patience and you will be awarded with delicious food. 蔅etter yet, order online and pick-up. FOOD: * Chopped BRISKET is smoky and delicious. A cup of BBQ sauce is served on the side for you to slather your meat the way you like it. 蔆hoose Regular or Spicy sauce. * Side dishes come in portion cups perfect for one person. (You wouldn't want to share anyway, they taste so good!) 蔍 especially like the MAC AND CHEESE (creamy cheese sauce topped with crunchy breadcrumbs) and the PEACH COBBLER (sweet peaches with a caramelized crust). * COLESLAW comes with every platter and has a light vinegar dressing. 蔜he coleslaw alone is no show-stopper, but its crunchy texture and mild flavor provides the contrast needed to support the meat and sides. �WAIT-TIME and DINE-IN SERVICE: A line ran out the door during during the our entire visit (Friday night dinner). 蔉rom waiting in line to sitting down to eat, we only waited a 1/2 hour. 蔛moque was managing the seating process, so there was no pressure in racing to save tables which was a HUGE PLUS. �RESTAURANT SIZE: The place is really tight. The line runs out the door and there is no area to wait for your order. 蔜ables are jam packed, so it is difficult to dine-in with a large group or if you have kids that need to move around. PARKING: Private lot behind the restaurant fits about a dozen cars. 蔛treet parking available. 蔍'm not sure how difficult it is to find parking, since we were able to secure a spot in the lot.

overated. It really is. For what 蕐ou're spending at Smoque, you could have a fantastic meal at a restaurant in the city that has a quiet, comfortable atmosphere. Call me crazy but I really don't enjoy spending $40-$50 on a meal for two people just to be crammed between loud talkers at dirty picnic tables. It's just not my thing. When I want to sit at a picnic table, I go camping. The three stars are for the delicious pulled pork. It's fantastic. However, the sides leave something to be desired. They are expensive and the size of a cereal bowl from which The Littles would eat.

Picture the scene: 7 people, 2 toddlers, where to eat on a Friday night? Normally this scenario would give me nightmares, and a busy place like Smoque would be out of the question. But since it wasn't my decision I went along with the plan expecting the worst. I can happily report that my fears were unfounded. When we got there the place was half empty, and we were seated right away. Then we put in our order and got our drinks from the fountain. By the time we got back to our seats our food was ready! The food was delicious. I had the half rack of baby back ribs. It comes with slaw and two sides. For those I chose the peach cobbler and beans. My only complaint is that the half rack seemed on the small side, but everything was seriously good. I would come back again anytime. Parking was easy. Although we drove, its really easy to walk to from the Irving Park blue line station.

Our visit to Smoque was fantastic. I tried several things here and they were all excellent. A few surprises: it's a casual walk-up order place, no waitstaff, and they actually have parking in the rear of the building! What else can one significantly add to a place that has been reviewed over a thousand times? Not sure. If you need to know anything else I'd say get prepared for some crappy coleslaw. The the bleu cheese coleslaw recipe from Bat17 in Evanston would be a great match; they should steal it.

The only thing here I'm not bonkers about is the coleslaw; I prefer creamy and they have a vinegary style. Other than that, everything I've ordered her is aces.

Yummo is what I said in my quick tip and yummo is what I ended up getting. This place is always busy and I think it is the best BBQ in Chicago and up there with any Texas BBQ place. You get in line, order at the counter and then they call your number when your food is ready all the while trying to make sure you get seated as well. The people are friendly and the food is great. On this particular occasion I had the Baby Back ribs and they were outstanding. All of the sides are great as is the brisket. So if you are in the neighborhood give it a try!

Smoque delivered a cultural experience. The place is a picturebook playland of Americana indulgence. �Sitting next to us were two groups competing for our attention: (1) a herd of happy ladies practically pouring hot sauce in each other's pork packed mouths; and (2) a table of eager-to-be-labeled foodies with proudly displayed Half Acre growlers. 蔜his place has become a destination and people make an event out of it. The food here is delicious, but I have a couple tips-worth of advice. �First, if you don't want to deal with the out-the-door line (especially in the winter) order take-out 45 minutes prior to your arrival. 蔍t'll help you make a quick getaway. �Second, if you're real hungry and debating between the platter and the sandwich meal options, go for the sandwich and add the sides. 蔒y platter portions were noticeably short-shrifted, meat-wise, in comparison to the sandwich options. One more thing - my palette may not be refined, but barbeque isn't the most demanding of dishes. 蔄s I see it, the difference comes in two basic angles: the smoke flavor of the meat and the taste of the sauce. 蔛moque delivers a nice cedar flavored pork sandwich and a citrusy barbeque sauce. 蔜here's a lot of hype here, but you'll probably walk away satisfied with your meal.

This place has received a ton of publicity and reviews so I had to try it. I went on two occasions over the course of ten days and both times the food was average at best. I had the brisket platter on both visits and I was not impressed with quality, flavor and seasoning. Once it was a tad on the dry side while the other time, the meat contained a lot more fat. The portions were small for the price. I also had some stomach issues after visiting which I did not appreciate. I was not the lone person as the folks in my group also had to hit the toilet. Not cool. I do like the sides a lot and recommend them. Overall, the place is average at best, nothing fancy for a BBQ joint. I wanted to make sure I ate here twice before making a recommendation and both visits were not worth the time or effort.

This past Saturday, my husband and myself had the priviledged of joining my brother and his wife and my father for a meal at Smoque. I had never heard of it before but was excited to try to down-home cookin'. Upon entering, you will have to order first then you will be seated. We were in a little bit of a line but it went quickly. Our orders were fulfilled within 5 minutes or so which I also thought was nice and speedy, considering the place was pretty much full. I ordered the pulled pork ala carte with a side of the cornbread. I have to say that the pork without any additional sauce would have been just fine but once you add in the sauce, WOW! It was delicious! The pork was moist and the sauce was so flavorful. I also very much enjoyed the cornbread and actually saw some kernels of corn inside which made me appreciate the flavor even more. My husband ordered the same pulled pork but I do believe SOMETHING must be said about how amazing the mac and cheese is. No joke, it's amazing. If we ever venture back to Smoque, I will be ordering that M&C because it has this lovely crumble layer on top like a panko bread crumb and it's so cheesy! I also tried my brother's brisket which was delicious. I did not try the ribs but they looked great, too! Overall, our experience was great, I would definitely recommend this location for a lunch if you're in the area. Only downside would be parking but even when it was busy and snow was everywhere making parking difficult we still found a spot within a few minutes. Great spot for BBQ!

This place features some of the best BBQ around. �Tried the brisket, which was very soft and smokey. 蔍t was good, but not great. 蔜he meat was just a little bland for me and I found myself drenching it in bbq sauce, which I don't usually do. �The ribs however, were really good. 蔍 tried both the St. Louis and baby back ribs. 蔍 personally prefer St Louis because the fat content is higher and thus it's a safer bet to be less dry. 蔛ure enough, I did enjoy the St Louis a little more, but both had good smoke and flavor. I personally wish the sauce had a little more kick, but that's more of a personal preference. 蔜he sides, especially the peach cobbler was ridiculously good! 蔜he crust on that cobbler... wow. 蔔ext time, I may just get a double order of peach cobbler. �Mac and Cheese were good, as were the beans. �The coleslaw was meh to me, but I've never been too big of a coleslaw fan. �Overall, a good bbq joint. 蔇efinitely give this place a try if in the area.

Went to Smoque this weekend with some friends and had a pretty good experience. The ribs were cooked perfectly albeit a little on the bony side. The mac and cheese was sharp and delicious. Fries were perfectly cooked and a huge portion. Peach cobbler was also very good. Overall, a good experience but I think for the size the sides are a little on the pricey side. Service was very good and the wait for food was very reasonable. Only negative was the cole slaw, it was just basically shredded cabbage had no real flavor to it. That was disappointing since the coleslaw can really be a great addition to your meal. All in all a good experience and would try again.

This place got super packed since I last time I came here! holy cow! perhaps it's because it was on diners, drive-ins, and dives? 蕀aybe... so there's a crazy line out the door now where you wait to go in and order. There isn't much room for tables but the nice part is that one of the guys takes down your party size and helps you look for one (maybe this is only on busier nights?) I got the sliced brisket. They put the marbled ones on top so that the first bite is deliccccious. The ones on the bottom only have a layer of fat on top so it's a big tougher on the bottom. 蔜he sliced brisket gets cold FAST. I sat down and started eating and my second slice was already cold. The bf shared ribs with a friend and we both thought the St. Louis was much better. More Meat = More Delicious! (Not really but it was in this case) The mac and cheese is baked with a crust on top. 2 Thumbs Up and a Big Toe!

Smoque is some amazing BBQ. I knew it was going to be good before I even walked in. I could smell it as soon as I got out of my car. Its not much of a dining experience, but the food is great. I had the pulled pork sandwich and corn bread. It is a little out of the way for me, so next time I go (and there will be a next time) I am going to by at least a pound of the pulled pork and take it home with me.

This is the best place in the world for chopped brisket and hand-cut french fries! 蔛o good, in fact, that I have yet to ever try anything else on the menu - I just don't need to. 蔜he brisket is consistently juicy and delicious with a near-perfection darkening of the outside (that gets mixed in when they chop it so I always order chopped instead of sliced). 蔄nd the fries are consistently crunchy on the outside and tender on the inside. �So many places have trouble getting a really good crunchy outside, but Smoque gets it right every time.) �And for such a tiny restaurant, I think they actually do a really good job making sure everyone gets a table without having to wait - that is, after making it through the long wait just to place your order. 蔍've seen the line go outside the door, but it actually moves fairly quickly. 蔣UMMY!

I went in there on a Saturday night and man oh man was it packed. The line was all the way to the entrance. That definitely turned me off right away but holy shit the smell alone in that place and seeing everyone munch made me wanna stay. It took about 20 minutes total to get a table and start eating but it was definitely worth the wait. It was super chaotic in there but the staff was really good about getting people tables and cleaning up quickly after people were done. I had a half a slab of the St. Louis ribs (my personal favorite style), the corn bread and the mac and cheese. The ribs were so damn juicy and the bones pulled clean out. I don't like having sauce on the ribs because I love the taste of the burnt crust and taste the flavor of the meat. The house BBQ sauce they gave was nice and sweet and good. The corn bread was super delicious. The best part was that there was pieces of corn inside. The mac and cheese was super creamy and the best part of that was the bread crumbs on top. That meal was super super good and I definitely loosened my belt when I walked out the door. I'll be back for sure.

BBQ Brisket heaven. It's a 15-20 minute metro/subway ride from downtown Chicago, but very much worth it. For about $10 you get a main meat and two sides. The service and speed of order is excellent, though call ahead if you're late to see what meat they have left. Get the mac and cheese, it's amazing with the bread-crumb(like) flakes. The cold slaw is surprisingly refreshing and crispy too, but the beef chili side is really good and much more bang for your buck. The cornbread was average as always (and that's a compliment). Skip the cobbler though. The pulled pork isn't bad at all, it's just not nearly as the brisket. Same goes for the ribs, very plain and lacks flavor. skip it. Brisket it and you'll be happy.

Holy Smoque, this is possibly the best barbeque I've had that didn't come from my dad's grill. We stopped in on a Friday afternoon and walked right up to the counter, ordered from a very friendly young man and grabbed a table after filling our cups with some sweet tea (which is a must with southern barbeque). Shortly thereafter our number was called and we dug in. We sampled a bit of everything with the exception of the peach cobbler, ribs and chicken. I chose the brisket, brisket chili (lay off me, I spent my formative years in Texas and I love brisket) and fries as my sides. My dining companions went with the pulled pork, cornbread and macaroni and cheese and the brisket and Texas sausage, baked beans and cornbread. The brisket was delicious. It was juicy and surrounded by the most flavorful bark. It was so good, I let it go sauce-less. The Texas sausage is another matter. On its own, it's good. It's spicy. But, it needs the sauce. It's almost as if it was made to pair with Smoque's sauce because when you put the two together, it's barbeque bliss. The pulled pork was melt-in-your-mouth good. But, I'm glad I chose the brisket. And the sides were amazing! The brisket chili is Texas chili at its finest. It was so well-seasoned and chock full of brisket, beans and tomatoes. I wanted to take a quart of it home so that I could slip into something more comfortable and get in some alone time with it. The cornbread was sweet and savory, with kernels of corn throughout, and perfect for sopping up every last bit of the sauce from my plate. The baked beans were super tasty but paled in comparison to the chili. Now, I do not go out of my way for macaroni and cheese but Smoque has me singing a different tune. It was rich and topped with bread crumbs. It was so good your granny would be tempted to ask for the recipe. Let us not forget the coleslaw that comes with all the platters. It's just cabbage and vinegar (apple cider vinegar maybe?) and perhaps some seasoning but it is fantastic. It's clean and simple and it pairs perfectly with richness of the meats. I loved it, loved it, loved it. And the sauce is divine. It's the love child of Memphis barbeque sauce and Texas barbeque sauce. It's vinegary and spicy and the stuff Smoque makes will stay there forever if you dare to get it under your nails... So get that frown off your face, Smoque's gonna replace it with a smile and a dream come true. You probably won't see a pretty girl dancing to jug band music but you will get a mess of some of the best barbeque.

Just two places outside of the south that do BBQ right: my old man at home and Smoque. It's a close race actually. I've been waiting patiently now for awhile to read a headline letting me know Smoque is dropping some roots closer to the loop, West Loop, South Loop. Anywhere! C'mon!

Moved to the hood nearly six months ago, and suprisingly had never heard of Smoque. 蔐ast week, upon the reco of a friend of mine from a completely different side of town, I ventured in for the first time. 蔍 have been back twice since (three times in eight days) and have now tasted virtaully everything on the menu (I myself am not a fan of peach cobbler) and am a true believer that this is the best BBQ around. 蔒y only suggestion (other than to buy the brisket, and tons of it) is that you arrive in non peak meal hours as it seems to develop a line, even when it is 20 degrees out, right around lunch and dinner. 蔏eep up the good work, and the oak smoking going on out back.

My husband likes to make runs to here whenever he has the chance. We always get the baby back ribs without the sauce. SO TASTY EVEN WITHOUT SAUCE and I usually don't like it dry. I don't think the sauce makes it better either. I can finish a full slab all by myself and I'm a small girl. Now the sides... Cole Slaw - love the vinegary, oniony, peppery sauce for the slaw; different from most places using mayo Mac n Cheese - don't think i've had better mac n cheese anywhere around here. the bread crumbs on top are a nice touch. Dessert is Peach Cobbler - i have never tried actual peach cobbler other than like peach cobbler flavored stuff. i was in for a very good surprise. too bad the portion was so small. I should get more than one. Please go if you're ever in the area.

Smoque has become one of my favorite BBQ places. It's close to my neighborhood, and often I just get it for take out (no lines!) and eat at home, though I love that they are BYOB. I love their St. Louis style ribs (I like my ribs meaty!), pulled pork, sausage and sliced brisket. Though everyone talks up the brisket, its my least favorite of all that. Their macaroni and cheese is pretty damn good, the chili with brisket is good as well. The beans are great as is the cornbread. I'm not a fan of the vinegar-y and onion-y coleslaw though. I wish they had collard greens, that would be amazing and they would be just about my IDEAL BBQ place then.They have pretty good peach cobbler too. The owners are always there, they've gotten the crowd control going pretty well and usually there are no issues.

Writing this review was so difficult, because all that would run through my head was "Brisket brisket brisket. Brisket, briskety brisket. Brisket!" Excellent little spot that's welcoming during off hours but mayhem during peak. Their cornbread, beans, and mac'n'cheese are nothing to trifle with. Go home with those three sides and you'll be as happy as a clam without even having the most tender (tenderest?) brisket you'll loathe finding a rival for.

When I evaluate barbecue joints on the North Side, I feel like my experience with baklava is relevant. �The first time I had baklava was in Istanbul. 蔔ot only was it authentic baklava in the most beautiful city in Turkey, but it was from the chef that's renowned from making the best baklava in the world. 蔍t was amazing. 蔝HMAZING. 蔜he result? 蔄ll other baklava tastes like shit to me. ��Similarly, I never even tried pork until I hit my twenties. 蔍 grew up in a vegetarian family, and occasionally had poultry or fish. 蔄nd I had never had ribs until I came to Chicago - and it just so happens that I was living in the south side and ended up trying it at joints like Uncle John's, Lem's, BK - in fact, the south side is filled with amazing barbecue joints. �The lesson I'm trying to convey is this: when you try something for the first time, don't get the very best. 蔍ts setting you up for a world of disappointment. That said, the ribs from Smoque are what I would describe as SOLID. 蔜hey were perfectly done and delicious. 蔔ot very saucy, not particularly flavorful - the menu suggested St. Louis for the "authentic experience," but they were out and we got baby back. 蔍t's a little pricey for what you get, and they charge extra for bread. It didn't capture my heart the way Uncle John's has, but it's close to my apartment, and no one in the neighborhood looks at me and assumes I'm there to buy drugs. It's not a friendly neighborhood joint � the young lady who took my order didn't even look at me and none of the customers chat in line, but they were perfectly courteous. Since, as I said, I didn't try pork until I became an adult, I get a very minor stomach discomfort when I eat it - which means I only eat it when it's REALLY fucking good. 蔛moque doesn't quite warrant the discomfort, but I'm going to be honest - if 蔍 had never tried Uncle John's or Lem's, I'd probably give Smoque five stars.

Best brisket in town. But I have to say, DO NOT MISS THE CHICKEN!. Every person I take here I insist we order it and everyone thanks me for it later. The only quiblle I have is that it seems, for whatever reason, that the quality isn't always as good for take away. it seems they put the lesser parts of the brisket in the to go orders. Maybe it is just bad luck but the only bad meals I have had from there were carry out.

Great food... atmosphere... not so much. We took my BIL here for his bday. We love to pick BBQ places (notice my review on Lillie's Q). Hubby and BIL had ribs. My other BIL and I had brisket. We all enjoyed what we ordered. The brisket is to die for! I saw complaints about the BBQ sauce on some yelp reviews, but I loved it. The cole slaw was nothing special. Corn bread and baked beans were tasty. The guys all had mac n cheese. They all liked it. It's BYOB so we brought wine and beer. They only have plastic cups. So if you want to drink you wine out of a glass... bring one along :-/ We loved the food, the neighborhood (parking was easy at 5:30pm on a Saturday), and the staff. They were the friendliest bunch of folks! They do not get 5 stars because it is basically a fast food joint. You come in, get in line to order, they find you a table, then you have to go get your food when they yell your number. AND they have screaming kids, just like any other fast food place. (OK... so we could have gone later in the evening to avoid the screaming kids.) But I would go here any day before I would step anywhere near Lillie's Q ever again!

cold food + awkward seating = Smoque did not live up to my expectations. I went here last night after hearing great things about the place. When we first walked in there was a sign warning that they would run out of pulled pork soon. Seeing as this is what I came to eat, it was pretty annoying that they would run out of one of their most popular items. When we did get to the register, it took them awhile, but they decided they had enough pulled pork left for one sandwich. I was happy that I was going to be able to eat! After ordering my boyfriend and I were seated very quickly, but I was squished between a pair of Chicago police officers and an overweight couple. So this was annoying and awkward. Holding a conversation was difficult being in such close proximity to the other people, and being bumped by the man next to me multiple times made it even worse. Now I know why they can seat people so quickly- no one wants to stay and eat when it means you are forced into dining 3 inches away from complete strangers. Once my food came, I was just looking forward to eating. But, my sandwich was cold. Cold pulled pork is disgusting!!! Obviously, this was very disappointing. Since the place is so crowded as rushed, and they had ran out of pulled pork, asking them to fix it seemed unlikely. Overall, if Smoque would have served me a good meal I could have gotten over the other annoyances, but when you can't even serve me my (overpriced) sandwich at an acceptable temperature, you fail. PS- Don't order small ala carte sides. What a joke! For $2.25 I got about 2 tablespoons of mac and cheese. Lame. (At least that was hot though.)

There's definitely some good eats here. With the best days of summer long gone, the smokiness and selection of food helped me ignore the cold, fall downpour and feel like I was at a backyard cookout in the middle of July. Loved the half slab of St. Louis ribs I ordered. When they say smoked, they mean it! The smoky goodness was intense, but the occasional dip into the provided BBQ sauce rounded flavors out nicely. And these babies are served up nice and HOT--I burned my fingers trying to pick them apart as I hurried through my lunch. The mac & cheese sadly didn't thrill me, but the BBQ beans and coleslaw did. The coleslaw especially since it's my favorite type--cabbage and onions in a light, slightly sweetened vinegar dressing with just a bit of celery seeds. Simple, delicious and a great contrast to all the other rich flavors. I'd give this place 5 stars, but I have nothing to compare it to, especially nothing authentic. Despite that, I'd definitely go back and wouldn't hesitate to recommend it to anybody in the area looking for some good food.

I like it, but it's not going to get on the super-special-express anytime soon for me. Sides were okay. Place is accessible. Service was okay. The main food, underwhelming. The sauce on the meats was good (seemed like the same sauce no matter what you ordered). Here's my issue. The smoke seemed fake. It tasted like they used smoked flavorings in their sauce rather than actually smoking the food. I could be wrong, but that is what it tasted like. Their website says otherwise of course, everything in this place is smoked and everything is smoked using varied woods depending on the dish (they expertly chose the right flavor combinations). I don't know, I've been in a few chili-cook-offs that had contestants with very apparent smoke-flavoring and that's what my meal here reminded me of. I had the beef brisket that was incredibly tender, but it wasn't very flavorful on areas that the sauce had not touched. I'm okay with this now that i know I must be equipped with enough sauce. Fiance had the chicken and I am incredibly glad they didn't overcook it. I hate overcooked chicken. It was cooked well, moist and fell off the bone. Again, the sauce issue, but the chicken did have it's own flavor. Forgot to mention that I would return if I'm craving BBQ and if we're too lazy to make it ourselves. However, I wouldn't make this my "go-to" for BBQ.......hey, that rhymes.

Best bbq I have tried here in Chicago. Sliced brisket, excellent. The pulled pork is tender and juicy. Ribs had a nice bark and flavor. Don't make the mistake of not ordering the peach cobbler.

In my opinion this is the best BBQ in the city. There are other good bbq places in Chicago but none are in the same league as Smoque. I could write reviews of everything but no use in boring you, just try everything, it is hard to go wrong. My favorite though has to be the St. Louis Ribs. The rub is so good you do not need any BBQ sauce at all. Don't be discouraged by the line at the door, it will move fast and by the time you are eating you won't even remember waiting in line.

Love it all, especially all the great sides. Small portions, but it's all you need with the BBQ. I especially love their Peach Cobbler made in house. It's perfectly baked and crispy on the outside with hot peaches cooked on the inside. MmMmm... This place is even BYOB which makes it so convenient and a great place to try out new and delicious BBQ with friends. Try coming during non-rush hours or you'll be expecting a long line.

The mac and cheese was rather insipid, the best that one can say for it is that it was browned and crispy on top and that made it worth while. oh and the ambience is rather diner-y, much like you would expect from 5 guys.

Went here last summer after doing some research on a good BBQ joint to hit up while in town. We took a cab here from downtown to the tune of $20, dumb idea. Cabby looked at me like I was crazy when we got picked up downtown and said where we wanted to go. Take the Blue Line, it stops nearby and is way cheaper. My girlfriend and I waited in the long line for about 20 minutes. Too bad we didn't know you can bring in beer and just drink while in line or I'd have hit up a party store. She got the brisket, I got one of the varieties of ribs. A co-owner was there and overheard me mentioning we were out-of-towners. He hooked me up with some free pulled pork and the other variety of ribs I did not order. 5 stars already! The brisket was Godlike. I've never had better brisket. And my girlfriend doesn't care for BBQ. She devoured it with a smile on her face that I'll probably never see again unless we return. Both styles of ribs were amazing, very flavorful. A lot of people mess up ribs by making them taste like 90% smoke and 10% meat. These were perfect. Can't remember which type was fattier (St. Louis maybe?) but I preferred the less fat ribs. Pulled pork was pretty damn tasty too. Don't recall too much about its flavor but I know it was good. All the sides were amazing. Cole slaw and cornbread stand out as two of the better options. Worth the trip from downtown if you're in the mood for some memorable BBQ. How much I can recall from a visit 14 months ago should tell you it's quality stuff.

I had high hopes for this place. I wasn't disappointed, but I wasn't impressed either. The baked beans where awesome and the mac N' cheese was great too. I tried the beef brisket and it was tender (burnt on the outside, but didn't taste burnt), but just lacked flavor. The BBQ it came with was weak and just about any famous dave's sauce would beat it (not saying Famous Dave's sauce is that amazing either, but it's at least something to compare too). The sauce was sweet but that's it. I also had the Texas sausage, which was good and had decent flavor. Prices were very reasonable and the environment is great. Everyone was friendly and it seems like a well oiled machine. I would definitely eat here again, but it I wouldn't go out of my way and would probably try different meats.

This being my last non-vegan meal... I loved it!!! I was told that they are the best BBQ in Chicago so I had to try it before I gave it all up! I ordered the pulled pork sandwich with a side of coleslaw and peach cobbler. The pulled pork was just how I like it with certain pieces a bit crispy. I smothered it in their hot BBQ sauce which kept my taste buds on their toes for sure! The only down side was that they use soft buns so things got mushy a bit. The coleslaw was exactly how I like it. They use a vinegar base instead of mayonnaise! Yeah! And the peach cobbler was not too sweet, had a good textured, crunchy topping and was the perfect small size for after a big meal. Yes... this meal has been in my dreams a lot lately... night! ;)

I was really skeptical since I'm used to southern BBQ but this was SO good that I crave it once in awhile now that I'm back home in Dallas. I ordered a brisket platter that came with two sides of your choice and cornbread. Must I say, the cornbread was AMAZING and moist. The two sides I chose were mac and cheese and coleslaw, YUM. The brisket was the best part, obviously. The second I forked some into my mouth, I WAS IN HEAVEN! It was sooooo delicious and it melted in my mouth!

Smoque was OK. The Ribs were good but I wanted them to be saucey - the sauce was on the side - first gripe. For my sides I got Mac and Cheese and Cornbread - the Mac and Cheese sucked, the Cornbread was OK, but there was hard parts in it that kept hurting my teeth - was like eggshells although I'm hoping it wasn't eggshells!!!! It is pretty overpriced for the quantity of food that is given. The one thing I did enjoy was their Peach Cobbler and I HATE Peach Cobbler..it was YUMMMYYY!

Their menu is written on a large chalkboard up on the wall. 蔄s I was drooling over the menu, I was having a tough time deciding what to order. 蔍 wanted to try everything, but was happy to see they had tasting portions of some items. I ended up ordering the Beef Brisket with a taste of some St. Louis Ribs. 蔜he Beef Brisket was damn good. 蔛uper moist, smokey black crust, thick cut, with great spice rub/BBQ sauce. 蔜he brisket easily breaks apart with your fork and I was smiling with every bite. 蔜he taste of ribs included a quarter slab, which was plenty as the St. Louis were meaty. 蔜he ribs were fall off the bone tender and the smokey crisp crust has great flavor. �The sides didn't disappoint at all. 蔍 loved the vinegary cole slaw, which went well with the smokey BBQ, but the mac & cheese was freakin awesome! 蔜he side was just the right amount of mac and hot creamy cheese. 蔍 also got the Peach Cobbler which was really good. 蔜he sides were small, but with all the meat I thought it was just the right amount. I can't wait to go back for some more brisket and to try the other sides.

Really the best BBQ in Chicago. But we only like the beef brisket. Opting for a chopped brisket platter lets it get more saucy...plus its good for neat freaks who prefer using utensils for food :-) �.....or girls who don't like dry cleaning bills. Actually we like the small specialized menu... But 5 stars from me would require having smoked lamb and no pork...but that's asking alot I know.

I have not gone there yet, as I've only had it as a take out order that someone else has gone to pick up. 蔍'm a huge fan of brisket, so I've only had their sliced brisket sandwiches, but both times they were to die for! 蔜o me there is nothing special about their mac & cheese, but I LOVE their coleslaw! 蔍 am a huge fan of vinegar based coleslaw and their is so good I can't stop eating it! 蔍f you like creamier coleslaw, you will not like this one. I've told my mother & sister about this place, and have made tentative plans for them to come into the city to join me here for dinner. 蔍 know they are going to love it also!

For some reason, I have been on this bbq binge trying to find the good ones in Chicago. 蔍 am giving this place 5 stars because it just might be the best sliced brisket I have ever had in the US. 蔔ow note, I am more of a fan of dry rubbed bbq, nothing too saucey. 蔅ut I even love eating at this place. 蔠ith the guy there to find you a table to eat at, it feels comfortable eating there...which is what a bbq place should be like. Also when I ate there, I ordered a half slab of baby backs. 蔔ow I will say, I think the ribs here are just ok...Id prefer the brisket over everything else on the menu. 蔋owever one cool thing about this place when I ordered my ribs...when I picked up my order from the counter, the person told me I was given a small batch of ribs and that they would give me a whole another batch to make sure its right. 蔜hats amazing. 蔒ost places would just give the small batch to some unlucky customer but this place wants to make sure you get it right. 蔍 was rooting for the ribs after this, so I was a bit sad it did not live up my expectation for ribs (so far, I have liked Q's ribs the most). 蔅ut I definitely felt the urge to give a shout out to smoque for offering this kind of service. I wasn't crazy for the sides either. 蔛o basically, my message about this place is that its a great place to eat at, and the sliced brisket is the thing to get.

Prior to visiting Smoque, I had only one recommendation in terms of where to go for great ribs. �I-57 on Halsted) 蔜hat was until I made the trek and visited Smoque. 蔅oy was I pleasantly surprised. 蔜he ribs were meaty and delish. 蔜he sides were fantastic. 蔄lthough there was a long line, the seating process was rather efficient. 蔕verall, I was reallly happy. 蔜his is DEFINITELY a place to try.

I think Smoque's rating here on Yelp speaks for itself. The place is not much to look at from the outside or the inside, but the food is out-of-this-world good. If you're a vegetarian, I'm not sure this place is for you, but if you're like most other people and you like meat - oh man, it's heaven. The food is simple, it's prepared quickly and IT'S SO GOOD. If I lived closer, I'm not sure I would be able to stop myself from coming back everyday.

I'm from the southeast, home to the kings of BBQ. 蔜rust me, I wanted to knock this place a little because of it's distance from the true BBQ capital but I can't. 蔠hat I ate here, my god, I hate to say this but I've had the best BBQ ever and it didn't come from the south. 蔍t came from Smoque. �The owners here know what they are doing. 蔜his isn't just some hole in the wall with good food. 蔜his is the epitome of flavor, tenderness and smoke. I was born in Chicago and moved to the south and now I'm moving back. 蔊uaranteed that I will be a regular here. 蔍'm even going to apply to work here, even though they may not let me, I've been smoking my own pork and beef for years and I want to know how they do it. �Only thing that would make it better is if they tried out my mustard, ketchup, vinegar blended sauce that symbolizes all of the Carolinas. �) Five stars, hands down...

nom nom nom. This place hits the spot when you're in need of some good ol' comfort food. Smoque actually reminds me of Brasa in Minneapolis, but is not as healthy-feeling. We got the baby back ribs, brisket, and pulled pork platters with all the sides they offer. Our favs were the brisket and pulled pork. The baby back looked dry but actually weren't. However, none of us were a fan of the dry rub marinade (that's a personal preference b/c my mom's ribs are 100000x better than anyone else's, including Smoque's... sorry!). I actually like Smoque most for the smokey (ha.. ha...) flavors in its meat and its sides. The sides are def my fav. I would recommend the mac n' cheese, corn bread, peach cobbler, and fries. The cole slaw comes with every platter and is one of the best I've had.

After hearing so many good things about this place (from friends and various TV shows) I was disappointed with my experience. �The food was OK but it tasted a lot like other BBQ that I've had (namely at a friend's house). 蔜he place is cramped and there's some waiting if you come at peak times. �There's a lot of street parking available but it's sort of in the middle of no where, so plan on taking a bus.

We came here after hearing so much about it and seeing the place on Food Network. 蔠e came and weren't disappointed. 蔅e prepared to wait in a line (outside too) before you go in and order. 蔠e waited about 45 minutes. 蔍t was definitely worth it! They have it down to a science. 蔣ou order and then they have someone seat you. 蔍t is loud and nosy but that's okay. 蔍t is a place you eat and leave. 蔍 did note that they had pick up which I will definitely keep in mind. The food was very good. 蔠e had a sampling of almost everything. 蔒y favorite was the Brisket. 蔣ummy! I loved the sauce that it came with too. 蔜he pulled pork was also delicious and my boyfriend loved the Baby Back Ribs. 蔄s for the sides, we went classic fries and mac & cheese. 蔞ery good! �We will definitely be back!

Just came here last night for the first time. Overall, the experience was fantastic. I'll mix it up and start with my complaints first. I only had two small issues with this place. First, the ordering/seating was a little disorganized, especially since it was pretty busy. It ended up working out fine, and we got our food quickly, but it was just a little disorganized and confusing. Second, we got a "taster portion" of the ST. Louis ribs. They weren't the best I've ever had (*cough* they were no Twin Anchors *cough*.) They were a little tough--definitely not "fall off the bone" tender that I like. Now the positives: my husband and I each ordered the brisket plate. We were in agreement that it was the best brisket we ever had. The sides were also very solid: we got beans, mac and cheese and cornbread. I thought the beans were the standout (I pretty much drank the extra sauce in the cup at the end) and my husband thought the mac and cheese was the best. All of the sauces were fabulous as well: we stuck with the Carolina and the "Spicy" Memphis. Bottom line, I'll definitely be back here. This is the best BBQ (overall) I've had in Chicago.

Absolutely over rated. They have their cooking methods perfected, the brisket just feel apart and was extremely tender. What they don't have down is flavor. You could barely taste the rub, the smoke flavor didn't penetrate the meat, and the barbeque sauce was just bland. I went in to this place expecting great things. If this place hadn't had a million reviews on yelp and been all over food shows, I would of came out happy. With that type of hype I was expecting bbq that is hard to find, but they didn't deliver.

Yes, Smoque is the BBQ joint in the city, hands down. 蔅etter than Smoke Daddy, better than Pork Shoppe, better than Lillie's Q, better than Chicago Q. �Their vinegar-based sauces is so good that I could almost drink it. 蔜heir brisket was so tender that I didn't need my knife at all. 蔜heir mac & cheese was perfectly cheesy and crunchy with breadcrumbs. 蔄nd their peach cobbler was a nice sweet end to the perfect BBQ meal.

Ah, This is a 4.5 star restaurant to me, but I am giving 5 because (first of all they don't have 4.5 officially, but also) their brisket was something special. 蔍t was so tender and juicy but still the texture was intact. 蔠e also loved the St. Louise rib. 蔋owever, their baby back rib was dry and just ok. 蔍 would definitely recommend, as a lot of people say, to try briskets and baby back rib.

I've been to Smoque multiple times and it never disappoints. Problem is I love the ribs so much I get them every time! Need to make a point to try other stuff on the menu. St. Louis ribs are as good as it gets. Meaty, they take the time to really cook and smoke them so there is tons of flavor. All the sides are delicious but my favorites are the beans and the fries! Fries are fresh cut and a generous portion. Other sides have smaller portions but are rich enough you probably don't want (or need) more. BBQ Beans of some of the best I've had (warning for vegetarians there IS meat in them!). And the service there is great. The people on the floor are very efficient at preparing your table so you can sit when your food is ready. People move through at an efficient pace! Well done Smoque!

Ok so let me start off by saying that I spent much of my life eating Texas BBQ, growing up in Texas.... My dad used to own a deli which was close to Sonny Bryan BBQ (anyone from Dallas knows Sonny Bryan's), and they used to trade lunches. That is the best of the best. I have to say that Smoque runs a pretty close second! I am so excited to have found Texas BBQ in the great city of Chicago - who knew!!!! I went there for my second time today and enjoyed it as much as the first time I was there. The brisket is smoked to perfection and as tender as can be! I recommend the mac & cheese as a side - it is some of the best mac & cheese I have ever eaten. The table set up reminds me of eating in the best BBQ joints in Austin! I highly recommend Smoque if you are craving a great smoked BBQ meal!!!

Just when you think macaroni and cheese can't get any better, we check out Smoque BBQ and get lost in what can only be described as macaroni and cheese sent down from the Gods (or God). By far the best mac 'n cheese we have ever had. While we didn't sample any fine BBQ meats this go-round, we managed to grab some coleslaw, cornbread, and of course the other worldly Mac 'n Cheese. Slaw wasn't as creamy as most, but far from inedible and popping with flavor. The cornbread was superb, velvety and fresh out of the oven. Only downside was the freaking crowd! This place gets rocking at lunch, so if you're in a hurry, call ahead and get it to go. Unless you enjoy rubbing elbows with strangers while BBQ sauce drips down your face. Bring your wallet too, it can get expensive. Thanks again Smoque!

Tried Smoque BBQ while on vacation in Chicago. This is honestly some of the best BBQ I have had. It makes me sad that in Los Angeles we lack good BBQ. The staff was attentive and helpful. They are more than happy to find you a seat once you place your order. They also bring the food to your table and cleanup once you are done. The food was amazing! I was able to try the Sliced Brisket Sandwich (http://www.yelp.com/biz_� with some Mac n Cheese. The brisket was super juicy and tender. Literally melts in your mouth. We also ordered a platter (http://www.yelp.com/biz_� with Chicken, Ribs, and Links. All the meats were perfectly smokey, with a great bark on the outside. The sides were also delicious, but obviously the meat is what people come for. It was definitely worth the drive outside the city!

This place is soooo uberly amazing!! 蔛ad that we're moving to San Jose in two months and just recently discovered this place....I guess that means we'll just have to go here 2-3 times a week before we leave - which we've been doing because it's so darn addicting! �Words can't describe how good the pulled pork and the chopped brisket sandwiches are. 蔍f you've had bad bbq before you know that theyre usually really chewy and dry even with a good douse of bbq sauce. 蔜otally NOT the case here.....the meat almost literally melts in your mouth, so tender, so juicy, so perfectly delectable that I think I ended up eating twice the amount of food I usually consume in one sitting. 蔜hey have a half brisket half pulled pork sandwich in case you cant decide but if I had to pick one I would most definitely go with the brisket because it was a little more flavorful. Sideswise go with the baked mac n cheese, baked bbq beans and fries. 蔍 would personally skip the coleslaw and cornbread but definitely get the peach cobbler for dessert! So when you first get there, get in line to order (you'll see the line when you get there....and there's ALWAYS a line) and afterwards someone will assign you a table. 蔇on't try and grab a table before you order or you will mess up their whole seating system....I don't know how they manage to do it but it works every time :) 蔜he longest we've had to wait was about half an hour and that was when the line went back to the door so not too bad. if you're looking for good bbq in Chicago, RUN don't walk here ASAP!! :)

The day after I get back from Atlanta and my friend wants to get BBQ for dinner. I agreed. Ugh. I'm so fat. MUST ORDER: - sliced brisket: So tender it melts in your mouth - mac n cheese: Cheesey goodness with a bread crust! - peach cobbler: Best cobbler I've ever had. Next time I will take these to go and eat it with ice cream at home Ribs were decent, pulled pork was decent, and the chicken was decent. So pretty much whatever you order it will be good. BYOB. But if you're sitting outside I don't think that applies because there was a sign at the patio stating no alcohol.

There is one major thing I did not like about Smoque and it was the sauce. 蔍 am not a BBQ aficionado but typically like more of a sweet brown sugar, thick and tangy type sauce. 蔜he sauce at Smoque is pretty thin and tastes a lot like vinegar � just a little too much for me. �In fact, at the end of my meal I had to eat my brisket without sauce. Well then, why the 4 stars ... because everything else here is top notch. 蔜he dry rub and meats were all very tasty and extremely tender. �My husband and I got a bunch of sides to share and everything was fresh and had good flavors. Again, not being a BBQ expert, I felt the prices were good. 蔜here was a bit of a wait when we went but it was quick. 蔍 really liked how the quasi host found a table for us after we ordered. 蔍 felt like we didn't have to stand and hover over a table until they finished their meal.

Another review, another 5 stars for Smoque. It's been over a week since we came here for lunch and I'm still raving about how awesome Smoque is. We knew going in that this place served up some great BBQ, but it was above and beyond anything I expected. Coming off fresh from a BBQ disaster elsewhere (review to come), I was a bit skeptical. Could it be possible to eat BBQ without fat oozing everywhere and feeling like a disgusting glutton? The answer is YES! Atmosphere: We were prepared for a long wait and were pleasantly surprised at how quick the line was moving. I think it helped that additional seating was available in the outdoor patio. Cleanliness definitely caught my eye. Also, it was nice that the staff take on the task of finding you a seat after you order. It not only helps to avoid confrontations for "seat saving" for instance, but also helps to keep things moving. Food: I ordered the half &half with one side. This sandwich gives you the best of both worlds and is perfect for someone like me that can never make a decision. One half of the sandwich was of the brisket while the other half was of the pulled pork. Brisket - deliciously moist and tender. Be sure to order it sliced since it's a bit juicier than the chopped. Pulled pork - More of the same awesomeness. I was amazed at how little fat at all (if any) was on any of the meat. The BBQ sauce - the perfect mix of spicy, tangy, smoked BBQ. Yum! I really like how they give you a separate container of it which is perfect for dipping. I substituted the coleslaw for corn bread (YES!) and got the side of fries. The fries were huge; enough to feed at least 3 people. The corn bread was good - even had real corn bits in it. Service: Friendly service, despite a very fast-paced atmosphere. 蔄nother plus for having free soft drink refills and an endless supply of napkins at each table. We can't wait for our next trip here. We also are hoping to be able to have Smoque cater an event for us in the near future it's THAT good!

I'm a HUGE BBQ fan and this place is hands down the best BBQ place in Chicagoland. Everything is good! Smoque (sm?k) BBQ is a neighborhood kind of place that cooks up BBQ good enough to make it a true destination. It was created by five regular guys who happen to be passionate about food in general and BBQ in particular. We believe barbecue is at its best when all of its powerful flavors combine and harmonize. The natural flavors of the meat. The savory flavor of hardwood smoke. The spiciness of the rub. The sweetness or pungency of the sauce. When these elements are in balance, you have found BBQ heaven. We've worked hard to match the right cut of meat with the right rub, wood smoke, sauce, and cooking technique. Our proprietary sauces and rubs are lovingly crafted from scratch in our own kitchen. Same goes for our sides. It's a bit more work to do it this way, but we believe the results are well worth it. We invite you to stop by soon and see if you agree. They have everything from pulled pork, brisket and chicken to coleslaw, baked beans, and the best mac 'n cheese I've ever had (except for Alisha's of course). This place not only has amazing BBQ but the owners are extremely hospitable. When I went with about 12 teenagers one of them sat down with us and actually threw our trash away for us. This place is a must if you're a BBQ lover, it never disappoints. Stop by and check 'em out!

After watching and hearing many great reviews of Smoque BBQ, my parents and I decided to give this place a try. 蔜he last time I had BBQ was on my way back from Florida where we stopped at this BBQ joint in Savannah, Georgia which had just about the absolute BEST ribs I've ever had in my life. 蔝nfortunately I cannot say the same about Smoque BBQ. We ordered baby back and st. Louis ribs along with a taste of brisket with mac n cheese, peach cobbler, BBQ beans, and brisket chili as our sides. �First: the sides. 蔠e personally enjoyed the mac n cheese and peach cobbler very much however the BBQ beans and brisket chili weren't quite up to our standards. 蔜he BBQ beans had too bold of a flavor in that they were too sweet and too sour. 蔍t was quite hard eating them alone however perhaps if eaten with cornbread, it possibly wouldn't have been as bad. 蔜he brisket chili was really just average, can't say much else about it. Second: the main dishes. 蔜he ribs were okay. 蔜hey were very smokey and flavorful however the tenderness was off. 蔉or both slabs we found that the ribs were somewhat tender but not exactly to our liking. 蔅asically not "fall off the bone" tender, unfortunately this is a huge pitfall for us. 蔜he brisket was NOT "to die for" like many other reviewers claimed. 蔜he texture was very grainy/rough like and was uncomfortable for me to eat. �Third: the house/bbq sauce. 蔍 personally enjoyed this sauce however my parents do not agree with my opinion. 蔍 thought it was very flavorful and had the right amount of sweetness and tartness to it. 蔒y dad felt that the sauce was missing "something" and could be a little thicker. 蔍n all honestly it isn't the best sauce I've tasted but definitely one of the better ones. When we arrived at Smoque BBQ, there was huge line spanning out of the restaurant. 蔠e had to wait about 45 minutes to an hour to order our food. 蔕nce our food was ordered it only took about 5 - 10 min for our food to be ready. 蔜he atmosphere reminds me of a busy/hectic train station. 蔍t's very loud and jam packed. 蔜he tables are arranged in sort of long picnic table array, or in other words you'll probably end up sitting next to a couple/group that you don't know which was a little uncomfortable at first when our food wasn't ready. �So there is a chance that because the restaurant was really busy there is a possibility that their food isn't always as I have described it, so because of the plethora of great reviews, I have decided I will give Smoque BBQ a second chance some time in the future. 蔋owever based on our experience today I cannot rate this restaurant above 2 stars overall. 蔍 feel like everyone who has reviewed Smoque BBQ are native Chicagoans that have never truly experienced great BBQ, but then again I could be wrong! �I hope this helps! 蔆heers!

Great food, but still a little overrated. �Get ready to stand in line, especially on a summer weekend the line is up the block. Very friendly and helpful staff! Crowded dining area and it's a bit confusing at first. 蔜here is a huge line, someone taking numbers for a seat (which you don't realize the first trip there). 蔣ou stand there watching for a table, go to sit, and then are told that you need a number or to get your name on a table list. �I like Smoque, but will come back when they are on their down hours.

Smoque has a well deserved reputation of being one of the best BBQ in the Chicago area. In my family, we ordered the shredded pork sandwich, brisket, and st. louis ribs. 蔄ll were excellent. 蔜he shredded pork is meaty, the brisket is tender we cut ours with a fork, and the ribs fall off the bone. 蔍t's clear the restaurant slow cooks the meat for hours. Sauce is the right combination of a brown sugar or molasses and the accompanying sweetness and a bit of vinegar for a kick. 蔜hose combined with the meaty taste of our meals was a true threesome of taste. Sides were good, not excellent but still good. I liked the baked beans not being drowned in a sweet flavor typical of other 'cue joints. �Smoque nails the taste. 蔕ne star is deducted for the somewhat chaotic seating arrangements. 蔕nce you give your order you wait for an open table where the staff will seat you. 蔈xcept there's no place really to stand so you end up standing amongst the people dining and getting their fountain drinks.

Our Smoque dinner was 7 hours ago. I've washed my hands plenty of times. My fingers still smell like smoky BBQ. My boyfriend's fingers still smell like smoky BBQ. Yours probably will too. Weird? A little, but it's just a testament to how rich and powerful those smokin' St Louis ribs were. I don't even care how uncouth I may have looked sucking on those bones with all I had in me. I went from sweet Asian girl to frenzied Asian barbarian, fingers coated with that deleeeeeectable spice rub. I apologise, these babies deserved all the love I could give them. Oh, and don't get me started on the peach cobbler. Whatever, right? Peach cobbler is peach cobbler is peach cobbler. False. This, my hungry friends, was some crazy rich buttery heavenly divine PERFECT peach cobbler. If someone reading this discovers the recipe to this peach cobbler, please message me. I will buy you dinner. After reading this review (and the countless others), it should be clear. SMOQUE IS GOOD. Go eat.

The restaurant reminds me of my grandparents youth when an enterprising person usually an immigrant would make a restaurant in their front room. The restaurant is on one level with the cooking ovens and facilities at the back and the seating at the front. The place d巆or is rough and ready yet spotless. They served the meal on trays with plastic knives and forks and sides in polystyrene containers but it did not matter for the food was fabulous, well cooked and flavorsome. This is a place you dream about eating at and so do many others the place was packed.

There are over 1,100 other reviews detailing in depth how AMAZING the food is. There may even be one or two that would actually do the food justice. I won't even try. But I WILL tell about a couple of the things I was surprised with: - Cleanliness! I was expecting a place with such good food to be kind of gross. It's not gross. In fact, it's actually pretty clean. - Low wait time - When we got there it was pretty crowded, but there is a fairly quick turnover of the tables. There are a couple guys working that really do a great job of cleaning the tables, seating you, and making sure things are running smoothly. - Outdoor seating - there are a few tables outside, which was a nice surprise as well. I could go on and on about the food, but what's the point? If you're reading this review, somebody else has probably already told you about the food. Listen to their recommendation, and GO TO SMOQUE RIGHT NOW.

If I lived in Chicago, I would probably be a regular. 蔋owever, after having bbq in KC, STL, NC, Memphis, and Texas, this just doesn't match up. 蔜he sausage was ok, but bland. 蔜he coleslaw was dry and bland. 蔜he baked beans were not memorable. 蔜he peach cobbler seemed like canned peaches with toasted granola on top. 蔜he bbq sauce was average. The best food I had was the chopped brisket, but even that was just average. 蔍 realllllllly wanted to love this place, but I wasn't blown away like everyone else. �Also, it's very confusing when you kind of have a server. 蔣ou order at a counter, but a person finds a table for you and "assists" you at your table. 蔄nother person brings out your food. 蔈ither have servers or don't...don't have various people hovering over you and interrupting your meal trying to guess what you need.

While I may not have tried every BBQ place in Chicago, I have tried a lot of them. Smoque is by far my favorite. The only knock is that their success has bred a long line (sometimes). The owners and managers are very friendly; they actually want to hear your views (good and bad). The brisket is to die for, as is the chicken, ribs and sides. I highly recommend it to those who care about their BBQ!

Dont read any of the other reviews because I am going to tell you EXACTLY what you need to know about Smoque. This is a great place and depending on when you get there prepare to wait. If you go after 5pm, expect to wait at least an hour if not more. For reference, it is totally worth said wait time. Order the SLICED brisket sandwich. For sides, get Mac n Cheese and the baked beans. Not into baked beans? Well these are bad ass and they have chunks of the brisket mixed in. Take the slaw and put it directly on the sandwich. Dont worry its not thick with mayo. Its a very fresh, light coleslaw. Ask for an extra sauce, but ask for the sauce that comes with the ribs. The rib sauce is better than the what they give with the sandwiches because it is thicker, sweeter, and has a much better flavor. I know all of this because we ordered multiple items and shared them to include many sides, sandwiches, and even ribs. I dont play games.

Absolutely the best smoked brisket I've ever had anywhere in the country! It's so tender it can be cut with a fork, and it's wonderfully flavorful. 蔛o smoky!!! 蔜he rub they use is also fantastic. 蔜hen when you add the vinegar based bbq sauce, it's a combination of flavor made in heaven. The mac and cheese is also to die for. 蔜hey start with creamy mac & cheese in a small tin cup. Then they sprinkle on top bread crumbs, white cheese and yellow cheese, and run it through a broiler. 蔠onderfully delicious. The pulled pork is also superior. 蔍 also order the dinner plate with half pulled pork and half sliced brisket. There is often a line, but it moves fast and is so worth the wait!!!

The only thing that stops me giving Smoque a 5 star is the length of time it can take you, with lines out the door especially in the summer time. This is one of the best BBQ joints in Chicago, have visited multiple times and tried almost everything on the menu and have not left feeling dis-satisfied. The Brisket and the Ribs where by far my favorite, moist meat, good portion size and plenty of extra sauce. Some of the taster options are a nice way to allow you to sample the delicacies without having to commit to buying a full platter. The Mac and Cheese side is one of the best I have tasted, with an interesting bread crumb topping and the portions of fries are extremely large. This place is B.Y.O.B and has also been featured on some Food Network Shows. It is good for smaller groups as there is only 40 seats in the whole place and you can feel rushed as the crowd begins to gather. Parking can be a little tricky and you must get there early if you are not prepared to wait, but Smoque is a truly delectable experience!

Not the best, but one of the better BBQ spots in Chicago. I love this place and have planned on going back. The location is really unfortunate as far as public transportation goes, which is probably the reason we haven't been back yet. Driving will be worth it. We all enjoyed our meals. For myself, I ordered the St. Louis 1/2 slab, brisket, the Texas sausage, mac 'n cheese, BBQ beans. The brisket was by far my favorite. The slab was great, plenty of meat. It's important to note that my BBQ preference leans more toward the fall-off-the-bone saucey type vs. the dry rub though, and that's what the St. Louis slab was, the dry rub kind. But, I enjoyed it regardless. The sauce pretty much made this food trip for me, I loved it. I'm one who tends to think a lot of things need more acid though, so I enjoyed the sauce being more on the vinegary side, but that might not be your thing. There is another sauce available that's much thicker, less acid, with sweeter notes. As for the sausage, it was okay. I would just move on over to Uncle John's instead if you plan on centering your order around something that. I'm not head over heels in love with the mac 'n cheese like everyone else on here seems to be because I've had much better, but it IS very creamy, and very good. Not a fan of the communalesque seating but at least they've got a system going in helping you get seated.

In the course of one afternoon I went from a girl who didn't really like barbecue to a girl who was completely ignoring her lunching companion because she was having a special moment with a brisket sandwich. Yes, folks. Smoque is THAT good. Smoque serves up heaven on an aluminum tray. The brisket is so tender that it falls apart the moment you even look at it. The brisket sandwich (which I'm told is served on Hawaiian bread) will make you forget your manners, neglect everyone around you, and induce fantasies of shoving piles of brisket sammies into your face hole. The mac and cheese passed the Wisconsin Girl test - it was creamy and cheesy with crisp, buttery bread crumbs on top - and the coleslaw was phenomenal. The peach cobbler will make you weep tears of joy. The sauce at Smoque deserves its own paragraph, because barbecue sauce is the reason that I don't (or didn't) really like barbecue. Typically the sauce is too sweet or tastes like ketchup and I just think it's icky. However, the sauce at Smoque was tangy and peppery with a little bit of spicy heat. It was perfect. I wanted to drink it. I have been told that there is usually a line out the door but we arrived around 2:30/3pm on a Sunday afternoon and, while there was a small line inside, it wasn't a very long wait. Also, I appreciated that they seated us at a table for two instead of the long communal tables, because I wasn't minding my table manners. At all. Go to Smoque. Don't ask questions, just go. And BYOB.

I still love the food at Smoque but I'm deducting a half star for some service issues. I placed an order for a 6:30 pickup on Friday night so I wouldn't have to wait in the line from hell. I arrived at exactly 6:30 and my food was ready. So far, so good. Unfortunately Smoque only has one register and I had to wait for a good five minutes for my order to be rung up. I also had a $10 A La Card to be deducted from the final total of my order. I didn't know that giving them the $10 A La Card would cause all kinds of problems. Apparently a manager had to come over to handle the transaction which took additional time and then caused everyone behind me to wait since they only have the one register. My debit card was charged; I thought the amount still seemed high after the discount was applied but after being there so long, I just wanted to get the hell outta dodge. I got in my car and then looked at my receipt and it turns out I was given a discount of 10%, not $10, so I was shorted over $6. I debated dealing with it later but then figured it would be more of a hassle, so I did a somewhat illegal U-turn on Pulaski, re-parked, and went back in, fighting my way through the crowd. The girl that handled my food order (not the cashier) saw me and asked if something was missing from my order so I told her no and clarified that I was overcharged. She told me the cashier could help me when she was done with the current transaction she was ringing. So again I had to wait. The girl (pretty much the only bright spot) asked me if I wanted some chili while I was waiting "because it seems like this has been one huge pain in the neck for you." I acknowledged my annoyance but declined the chili, but I thought it was a nice gesture on her part. Again, the manager had to come back to deal with my transaction, which took another five minutes. Why they couldn't have just handed me $6 and change in cash and deal with sorting out THEIR error later instead of making me wait, I have no idea. They re-ran my credit card for the reduced amount but of course since it was on my debit card, the pending charge is still the higher amount until the final processing. I received no apology or acknowledgment of the hassle (other than the girl who gave me my food) from the cashier or the manager so I found that to be off-putting. I can't think I'm the first person to use an A La Card so they should know how to handle these transactions by now and they should also think about getting a second register to speed up the process for their customers. And of course because it took me so long at Smoque all of my food was cold by the time I got home. Soggy fries are a bad way to start out the weekend. As Amy H says, "First world problems" - yep, they're a bitch.

I've been waiting to try this place for a LONG time. I live all but one block away from the lake so going out west as far as Pulaski is a rarity, but hell for Smoque I am more than willing to make the trek out that way more often. When it comes to BBQ I have my own personal particular preferences for various elements to what I consider to be "Perfect" I'm talking about factors such as: - Spice/Seasoning: Give great flavor without ruining the integrity of the product - Texture: Tender doesn't always equate to mushy meat. Have it be soft but retain some level of bite that ensures you that you are indeed eating real meat. - Sauce: Sweet and tangy with a little heat. Balance, viscosity, color - all are important. - Sides: Costars to the meat that need to be able to standalone. At Smoque... - the meats taste great. not overtly smoked but just the right amount that makes you remember that smokiness exists for good reason. - the texture is superb. nice and succulent expertly prepared meats IMO. - The sauces I got were so tasty (different sauces for different meats) not too sticky nor runny. I got nice sweet caramely notes along with nice peaks of acidity that brought things together to meet the heat. - the sides here are great! I absolutely love the slaw here. Not mayo based which goes against my normal mantra of picnic style salads (mayo ally) but I really appreciated the vinaigrette. The french fries are pretty damn good and mac & cheese is super tasty.

It ain't no Texas bbq, but it sure is good for the midwest! I'd have to say - best bbq in Chicago. Ok fine, not that I've tried all of them in Chicago (I swear), but still, this is really good and legit stuff guys. Tried most of the meats on the menu - pork ribs fall off the bone, brisket is juicy, pulled pork melts in your mouth, and the bbq chicken was perfectly cooked, just about! Char grilled skin and errrrthang ;) Comes with sides - baked beans are amazing! Cole slaw and fries aint too shabby either. Seating is pretty limited, and street parking is available. Overall, good atmosphere and great bbq! I'd definitely come back.

My favorite thing about Smoque are those super-adorable-oh-my-gosh-cute tins they use to serve up their sides. I'm not trying to be silly. Really. This is my favorite thing about this place. I am from Kansas City. Roll your eyes if you want; I'll wait. I'm from Kansas City and nothing can unseat from my heart those champions of BBQ (Smokestack, Gates, Oklahoma Joe's). But I'm also a realistic person. I know it's more convenient to drive 20 minutes south instead of 9.5 hours south when I feel like eating BBQ. And my fianc�loves this place so I'm sort of stuck with it. Now, if this was KC, I'd rate this place on meat, beans and sauce. But this is not KC. And by that, of course, I mean the beans aren't great. So instead I'll rate this place on the tins, the meat, and (dammit) the sauce. The brisket is pretty good. By Chicago standards, I think it's pretty famously good. The sliced brisket has a strip of fat through it which weirds me out, but I'm easily weirded out by fat. I will carve a brand new cut of meat out of a steak if it's served with any normal amount of fat on the edges... and I certainly carve the fat out of this brisket. But this probably only reflects poorly on me, and not on Smoque or most other restaurants, for that matter. The sauce is really where I wish this place exceeded itself. The thin and vinegary sauce is ok, but it's not great or grand. I had high hopes for the thicker sauce but it tastes like BBQ ketchup. And so I suffer, destroyed by my unfulfilled BBQ-cravings. It's good on french fries, though. I'll give 'em that. But it's in Chicago, you know. It's in Chicago and it's alright. Plus the service is friendly and I'm into that. It gets four stars because of these two considerations.

This place has been on my bucket list ever since I saw it on Diners, Drive-Ins and Dives and recently I finally had the pleasure to dominate their BBQ. If you are looking for ri-donk-ulous BBQ then you need to get your Smoque on! I came here with some fellow Q lovers and got the pulled pork platter with a side of fries. I knew I was in for a treat when they served me my platter of pulled pig on a cafeteria tray and then, before they handed me this dish, they dumped a full ladle of thick BBQ sauce on my entire dish. (If you are drooling on your computer right now....I totally understand) The meal was flat out authentic BBQ. Each bite had a mixture of perfectly cooked oink oink, smoke flavor, and tangy BBQ sauce. I also tried the beef brisket and grilled chicken breast and they were equally as good, but I still think the pulled pork was tops. Drink a lil drink, Smoque a lil Smoque. Boom!

One word: smoque'd! My cousin and I didn't know what to eat so of course I turned to Yelp! Being a Friday night we couldn't turn down the idea of BBQ so we headed on over to Smoque! Boy was it packed! The idea of having bussers get a table for us while we waited is a smart idea than people won't have to fight for seating! We ordered: 1/2 slab of St. Louis ribs, brisket sandwich, large order of mac and cheese, large order of beans, and large order of fries. -- 1/2 slab of St. Louis ribs is tender and definitely smoque'd, love the flavor it left in my mouth and the bbq sauce definitely makes the ribs, however, I wish our ribs were warmer, it got cold quick. -- the brisket sandwich meat was soft and tender and the sauce was a nice touch -- baked mac and cheese? extremely declicious! it's more for the creamy lover who just absolutely adores that heavy cheesey taste. -- the beans are flavorful with a hint of sweetness -- the bag that fries came in was quite oily, but oddly the fries theymselves were not. they came fresh and steaming hot It was a delicious smoque'd bbq meal! Can't wait to try their pulled pork, baby back ribs, and peach cobbler next time!

I was lucky enough to get here when something went wrong with some of their machinery so they were doing a $8.95 deal for half a slab of baby back ribs and 2 sides. Ribs were perfect and the SIDES were bomb. I ordered the fries(HUGE) and mac & cheese....that was enough to fill me up.. but I kept going. Also, their slaw is awesome. I don't like coleslaw, and this def was an upgrade from the usual. I'll be back!

OK, Smoque. You sold me. The ribs were delicious, the brisket was so tender and juicy, and the cornbread was perfect. 蔈ven with the long line, the staff made things incredibly efficient and made sure we had a place to sit. 蔍t was raining, so they put umbrellas outside the entrance in case the line stretched outside. �The real kicker was when my plate of ribs came out, they apologized for the half slab turning out a little small. 蔍 hadn't said a word or complained, or even noticed for that matter, but they gave me a whole new half slab for free. I ended up with a whole slab of yummy ribs, and everyone I was with was stunned at the service. Thumbs up, Smoque. 蔍f only you were closer.

I've wanted to try this joint for a couple years and finally did. Always huge line, so we usually keep on driving. Went an hour before closing on a Saturday and the wait wasn't too bad. It lived up to the hype in every way. My special lady and I shared the sliced brisket, full slab of ribs, and a taste of the Texas sausage. For sides we both had mac & cheese and baked beans. The mac and cheese and baked beans were both the BEST I have ever tried anywhere. The brisket and ribs were both great and probably the best I've had in Chicago. The sausage was above average as well. Overall a great experience. It definitely tops my list of BBQ spots in the Chicago thus far.

My friends and I drove about 40 min. to try this place (which was featured on diners, drive-ins and dives) for lunch. Since we didn't eat breakfast, we were all getting a little irritable from hunger. But after trying the first bite of our food, we suddenly became very happy -- if you were eavesdropping on our table, you basically would have heard a bunch of "oh my god"s and "this. is. AMAZING." I tried the pulled pork and the brisket. Both were on the drier side, but it had really good flavor. Dipping it into the bbq sauce solved the dryness problem, but masked the natural flavor of the meat. So I ate half without the sauce and half with. I'd say the highlight of the meal was the SIDES. The coleslaw and bbq beans were pretty good (probably b/c they were so sweet?). The mac and cheese was great as well, esp. since the top had that crispy part with breadcrumbs. Also, you must try the peach cobber. It's one of the best I've had. You could come here and just get sides and feel like you had a satisfying meal. Oh yeah, and I had a $10 off $25 alacard coupon, since I came in 2010 -- I don't know if they are doing that this year, but that definitely made it even better!

I have been here on numerous occasions and keep coming back. I just really love their brisket. My most recent time was a few weeks ago with my fianc巈 who raved about his meal. He really enjoyed his pulled pork. I agree this form is the best way to retain their sauce. I like a thick and sweet BBQ myself, but I love the tang this place has to offer. 蔒y go to is the brisket because of how tender it is, but I agree that I need to mix it up on my next visit and do pulled pork or maybe the ribs. I'll just keep it standard by ordering their Mac n cheese ;p

One of the better places for bbq in Chicago. I love the sliced brisket here. It's always juicy and soft and can be eaten with or without the sauce. I've heard other people say that sometimes it can be dry but I've never had that experience whenever I order it. To me the pull pork is a bit dry but it's alright if you eat it with the sauce that comes with it. The St. Louis ribs are great as well. It has an excellent smoky flavor to it and like the brisket it can be eaten with or without the bbq sauce. The sides are good as well. Homestyle fries and the mac and cheese are my favs but the portion for some of the sides can be small. They come in these cupcake size aluminum containers where they're individually cooked. As for the place itself, it can get crowded. But the staff there help you find a table while you wait in line to order. They do have their own parking lot and there's street parking but there's not a lot of spots I recommend carpooling if you can. All in all one of my favorite places to eat.

First off I guess I should say that I'm not from Kansas or Memphis or one of the true BBQ capitals of the world. But I have set my heart on finding the best BBQ that I can on frequent trips to the US. Smoque's location should really put a tourist off, but after a trek out - it's a really long walk from Wrigley!!!, I found the best BBQ joint I've experienced so far. The babyback ribs were fantastic, the sides amazing - and who knew mac and cheese could be so good. I'd also have to say that the owners on both visits we made (we took the L the second time!) were incredibly friendly and chatted at length about theiir passion for the restaurant. They also ran back and got us some brisket to try, which merits the many great reviews on here. Really worth the trip out for great BBQ and superb service. I certainly know that it'll be first on my list when I head back to Chicago in May! Counting the days down already!!!

I am not a barbecue expert, but this place is awesome. It was my first real exposure to the real thing. Since trying Smoque, I have tried many other "authentic" places, but to me, nowhere else comes close. The brisket and ribs are really outstanding. Ribs are tender and meaty, with a nice smoke ring. The brisket is fork-tender, with deep and satisfying flavors. The sauces are good, but I usually find that I barely 蕁eed them! Additionally, I love the sides, especially the slaw and the mac and cheese. As a Wisconsinite, I know something about mac and cheese -- this is stellar. Definitely. Go.

This is what I love about Smoque... the trays. 蔍 know, weird, but I think they're super cute and isn't that what's really important when it comes to BBQ? 蔕kay, I know it's not, but I was more impressed with the tray than with what was on it. �Everybody raves about Smoque and my sister has been on a barbecue kick so when she was in for a visit we decided to go give it a try. 蔠e knew we'd have to wait in line, we knew it was cold out... we were prepared, except for the guy behind us who didn't understand the concept of personal space and grilled us about all of our favorite barbecue places in the city. 蔋e was visiting from out of state but he'd been to all the big names in Chicago BBQ. 蔒aybe it was all the talking about Fat Willy's and Smoke Daddy that ultimately led to my mild disappointment. �We ordered a couple different things to share so that we could get a good feel of the place. 蔙ibs, brisket, and a pulled pork sandwich. 蔜hey were out of peach cobbler (Which is maybe my second favorite thing on Earth) so I was a little miffed. 蔍 thought the ribs were pretty good (better at Smoke Daddy) and the brisket was pretty good (better at Fat Willy's) and I didn't have room for the pulled pork (although the bf said he liked it.) so I don't know how that faired. 蔜he cornbread was dry, the mac and cheese was alright, the baked beans were tasty, the fries were awesome. �I found the place friendly and nice, but nothing was so good that I feel compelled to go back. 蔍 do want to try the cobbler though; I just don't know if I want to stand in line for 40 minutes to try it (or worse, find out they're out again.).

Finally ate here just this past Monday, the seating arrangement is family/picnic style so make room for others to sit next to you. There is a nice big board for you to read the menu. We decided to get half and half. I wanted the pulled pork, she wanted the brisket. Was it amazing and tender! The sauce was really good and vinegary, I wish it was thicker, but still worked out. The mac n cheese is a must have along with the scrumptious corn bread! Last but not least, peach cobbler was really great...all it needed was a scoop of vanilla ice cream. The price is really good, and all for about $22 for the 2 of us was more than enough! There is always a line, but it moves pretty fast and worth the wait if you are a BBQ lover! I will be back for more even though I make some good pulled pork myself hehehe...

Liked it. Not sure I loved it. The pulled pork was incredibly disappointing. All I heard before coming here was that it was to die for. When I ate it, it was incredibly bland. I did go on a Friday night at their peak and will chalk it up under a bad batch. I'll give it another chance when more care can be put into the food. The brisket was incredibly juicy. The St. Louis ribs were very smokey without losing a freshness or soft texture. The Texas sausage was mediocre. The place was packed and the line out the door was intimidating, as they don't take reservations, but the line moved fast and my girlfriend and I were seated almost immediately after ordering (you order & pay before sitting). The food was three-star food, to be honest, but their BBQ sauce elevates everything to mouth-watering levels; the service was incredibly attentive and helpful; there's free parking; it's BYOB, the price is more than right, and you're not rushed out; and, again, the BBQ sauce is amazing! I really think this place is five stars at the right time. Friday at 7:45 p.m. really isn't that time.

HOLY MOTHER OF ALL THINGS HOLY this place is frickin' delicious. I love going there with a six pack and a friend and gorging on brisket (by far, my favorite). The last time I was there, they weren't serving the St. Louis ribs which was a good move in my book. I had them one time and they were kinda tough and not horribly flavorful. The brisket though... .oh, the brisket. If I could fall in love with a piece of meat I would drop mad L-bombs on that brisket. The mac and cheese is to die for, the BBQ beans are always a solid choice, chili is pretty tasty and 蔱ven though I don't typically like coleslaw, I even enjoy that. Something I really like about this place is that you can get a "taste" of something for the low, low sum of $3... so you can really try everything. It's safe to assume that as long as they're dishing out tasty noms, I'll be there helping to keep them in business.

Headed to the airport? Make a stop at Smoque - skip crappy airport food and prices. You will be full until you reach your destination! We usually get the baby back ribs - the only way to go. Excellent pulled pork as well. We always get 2 mac n cheeses (they are so tiny :*( ) and fries. I love the non-mayo-y coleslaw. The ambiance can be weird. With the line of people waiting in the main walkway and all the tables smashed up against each other. However, it's still great because it's very no non-sense.

Smoque was great! As someone that doesn't eat red meat or pork plus the talk of lines, I was a bit hesitant to head here. I went during prime dinner time during the week and only waited a few minutes in line--which I definitely needed to figure out what to order! There was someone that cleaned a table and sat us immediately after we ordered. We waited about 10 minutes for them to call our number and grab our food. It smelled and looked fantastic! We ordered a salad with smoked chicken, mac n cheese and the brisket platter with fries, coleslaw and mac n cheese. It was a lot of food that wasn't all finished! With drinks it was $26. I wished there were more chicken options (there was 1 plus salad w/ chicken) or fish. But there were a lot of sides that didn't have meats to choose from and the coleslaw, fries and mac n cheese that I tried were good.

Smoque BBQ, you son of a BEEF! You're kinda tasty, anyone ever tell you that? Baby Back Ribs were engrained with spices and pipin' hot fresh from the oven. The fries were also good but I didn't eat any. 蔜he mac & cheese were also pretty good; just enough to fill the tummy and not become an oompha loompa. The only item that I had a problem with was the beef brisket. Don't get me wrong, it was fall of the fork tender. But I thought it lacked alot of flavor, almost bland some would say. It does come with a water down vinegary sauce and it does taste good with the sauce but I like my meat with some flavor. Nevertheless, I still liked the brisket and I will probably continue to get it but spices wouldn't hurt. Note: Parking was another son of a BEEF! But there's free parking near the side intersection near the highway. (Wall area)

Absolutely-hands down the best BBQ Ive had in the city of Chicago. Words can't explain how I feel about the BBQ at this spot. All I can say is if your a real BBQ fan then you should take the time out of your day one day this week and get your butt up to Smoque. We tried the 1/2 Chicken and 1/2 Slab of Ribs. Both were incredible. All of the side dishes were amazing. I can wait to go back.

Time: Friday night, 04/2011 Entr巈: Chopped Beef Brisket sandwich Pros: 1. Excellent customer service. 蔈verybody was very nice and friendly. 2. extensive menu 3. My friend and I ordered the same thing, chopped beef brisket sandwich and it was OK. Well I think the sauce makes the meal. 蔜hey only had 2 choices of sauce to choose from for the beef brisket. They pretty much tasted the same, one was slightly more...spicy than the other. But they were pretty much the same. I prefer more of a sweeter sauce. 蔍've had better in Tennessee or even at Uncle Bub's here in the south suburb. 4. Average pricing 6. Appeared clean under the nasty white lights. Cons: 1. Brisket sauce was not sweet. 2. Nasty white lighting. Summary: I would go here again to try something else. Not for the beef brisket.

It took me two years to get to Kuma's, and then another two to get to Smoque. 蔒y holy trinity of north side gluttony isn't complete, though; I still haven't been to Hot Doug's. 蔛lowly but surely, folks. �We came here the Saturday after Thanksgiving. 蔒ost of Chicago was still dealing with leftovers and heartburn, and this allowed us to place and receive our orders within about fifteen minutes of entering. 蔍 think the Thanksgiving leftover crowd ran out of gravy soon after our arrival, though, because the line was to the door from the time we sat down to when we left. �I went with the half and half, as I didn't want either the pulled pork or the brisket to feel bad about being left out. 蔄nd since I still don't want either the fallen pig or cow to feel slighted, I'll say that they were equally good. �Sides: the fresh cut fries are excellent, although it would be quite the disappoint to ever get a bad order of fresh cut fries (was there ever a food name with such built-in deliciousness?). 蔜hey didn't skimp on them either, and that's appreciated. 蔛ome of the other sides my friends and I sampled were small but intensely flavorful. 蔍'd never had baked beans that needed to be savored quite like that. �Room for improvement? 蔜he meat was cooked to perfection, but the sauce wasn't very memorable. 蔄nd like countless other bbq places, Smoque would do well to put some more effort into their bread/buns. 蔛ome average bread won't spoil the meat here, but the right kind will make it divine. 蔆ooper's is a good example of a place that has embraced this concept. �Both the guys working out the seating arrangements and the folks at the counter were very polite and cordial, and this was a pleasant surprise. 蔣ou would not expect this at a place that has a line from open to close every day. 蔣ou folks at the DMV (who no doubt read Yelp religiously) could learn something. �We were witnesses to a funny thing while eating. 蔜he gentleman I took for the owner and one of his employees were having a conversation near the exit on the side. 蔄s the line pushed toward the door, a well-heeled looking older lady seemed annoyed that they weren't following the line towards the cash registers. �Excuse me, are you in line?" 蔆ome on, lady. 蔣ou may not know that he runs the place, but he's wearing a white coat and checkered pants; he clearly works here. 蔅ut surely it's plausible that if he were employed elsewhere he'd cheat on his own kitchen for some Smoque.

I don't know what took me so long to check this place out! It's a cute little spot where you order you stuff and pick it up at the counter. I like that they have a hostess to help you find seating because that can be a little daunting and this creates organization and who doesn't love organization? So let's get to the good stuff--the food! The BBQ here is amazing. Ribs that fall of the bone without that "boiled" taste. You can tell that they cook it low and slow. The BBQ chicken is the moistest I've had and and the skin is so crispy. The best part is that when you cut into the chicken all the juices come gushing out so you just know that it won't be dry! The brisket here is the best I've had in the city. Nice and juicy..smokey without being too smokey. The slaw here is the sh*&! I like that it's not a heavy mayo version and that they don't throw all kinds of crap into it. The fries here are heavenly...nice and crispy! Their mac n' cheese is tops. I would say their corn bread and bbq beans are ok but nothing spectacular. Their sauce is right in between that thick sweet sauce and the vinegary-type bbq sauces. Can't wait to go back...this place will totally give you the itis b/c you won't want to stop eating!

Mac n cheese is good.

This place made me love brisket-- I'm really a pork girl (I'm Filipina!) but the beef brisket was juicy, beautifully smoked, and tender. 蔐ove the sauce, and the ribs are good too. I'm really picky with my mac and cheese, and this place gets it pretty good. 蔜he beans hit the spot too, with bits of brisket. �It's not all that comfortable a place to dine-in as the lines can be long and the place is really too loud for conversation. 蔛o, take it to go and you are good to go!

Ok, this place gets a lot of hype (at least from people I know) but I'm giving it the four stars it deserves even though I felt a little let down because I was expecting to have a food-gasm. 蔇on't let people trick you into thinking this place is life-changing, do'nt get me wrong it's really good, but you know... Everything is very good. I was lucky enough to go with people who all ordered different things and I tasted most of the meat offerings. Those offerings however, are kind of limited. I know it's a BBQ place and they do what they do and they do it well and it's their thing and that's all, but still the menu is small. That said, the sauce is really good enough that they could serve only that, alone and I think I would still come here from time to time. The sides were good, although I like a gooier, rather than creamier mac and cheese, theirs is very creamy. The price is about right, the portions are excellent and it's BYOB so that's awesome.

I wasn't sure what to expect, but Smoque is a very down-to-earth BBQ joint reminiscent of those you'd find in North Carolina. You wait in line to order, give your number to the guys manning the tables, wait for your order, and those guys find a table for you. We got there with the lunch rush on a Saturday afternoon so I was afraid that we'd be standing with our food, waiting for them to find a table for us, but tables turn quite quickly and we were seated before our food was called. The hubby ordered the sliced brisket platter with mac n cheese and cornbread. I got the pulled pork with bbq beans and mac n cheese. Both orders also came with coleslaw. My pulled pork was so good! Moist pork with crispy edges and skin, with a side of bbq dipping sauce (sweet and tangy). The hubby's sliced brisket was delicious and clearly a favorite as most tables had at least one order of it. The mac n cheese were served in little foil cups and had a breadcrumb topping that added some contrasting texture to the creamy, cheesy mac underneath. The cornbread was good, nothing spectacular. The bbq beans though - those were spectacular. Served hot, with chunks of beef, a good amount of spice and tang. I loved it. The slaw was simple, vinegary, and nicely cut through the rich, sweet, spicy bbq sauce and beans. Pulled pork -- Beans -- Bite of Mac n Cheese -- slaw -- sip of Sweet Tea -- Repeat. We left with full tummies and happy hearts. We'll definitely be back to 蕋ry other menu items, namely, the St. Louis ribs!

Sure, I'm the 915th person to (most likely) extol her praises of Smoque on Yelp, but by golly, I want to share. Mostly because... HOLY MAC AND CHEESE, YOU ARE THE TASTIEST MAC N CHEESE I HAVE EVER TASTED THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU. Seriously, this is my favorite mac and cheese around. While I like the barbecue here, I love this side and could devour it all day every day. Fortunately, I am a (slightly) responsible adult and don't gorge myself on their cheesy goods. Also worth mentioning was that two older dudes sat next to my boyfriend and I while we were here with three bottles of wine and proceeded to drink their meal with a side of barbecue. Long live BYOB and cafeteria style seating!!!

The rating is deserved and the hype is true. Smoque delivers a consistently awesome BBQ experience that justifies the line stretching out the door. The staff are all smiles because they know they're serving up portions of awesomeness at a fair price. The seating is casual and the paper towels are right there and ready. The brisket is tender and high quality. The sandwiches are on a good-enough quality of bread as to make it more than just a vehicle of getting meat to your mouth. The pulled pork is flavorful and firm. The dipping/drizzling sauce has an addictive lime flavor that makes me want to gargle with it. The sides are appropriately portioned and seasoned to compliment the BBQ meat. If you're going to pig out, do so where you are guaranteed to enjoy it. They also kick butt and take names at short notice catering. My Superbowl party LOVED the party tray they put together with just an hour's notice!

I like Smoque for a couple of reasons. Firstly, it is a perfect example of what happens when somebody likes something enough that they devote themselves to trying it out and not stopping to get it just right. The second reason is just that...they got barbecue just right. The sliced brisket is juicy and flavorful, and the ribs rock. Also, be shire to get a side of BBQ beans. They are sweet, smokey, and have bits of beef brisket in them. Could it get much better? I think not.

tried the pulled pork sandwich the other day. thought the meat was pretty tasty but when i happened to take a peak at their bottled bbq sauces they had for sale, both the original and the spicy flavors had high fructose corn syrup and anyone who knows anything about bbq is even at a high volume place such as Smoque, its a no no in terms of taste compared to regular sugar. so that was a picky turn off for me. not to mention the place is really small, expect during a busy time of the day to be sitting right next to a stranger at the same table while eating. most of the people that came in were taking carry-outs though so i guess it all made sense. my continuing search of amazing chicagoland bbq does not end here at smoque, but im still glad i stopped to notice it along the way.

As soon as we stepped in out of the rain, we were in line. Yes, that busy, but seemed to move at a fair pace. They do have people that will seat you. We had a group of 9 and thought it would be out of the question, but sure enough, they had a table for us. Food was enjoyed by all. I could not decide so I had the 1/2 and 1/2. Half chopped brisket and half pulled pork. Best of both worlds. No choice on sauce but liked the house sauce so no foul there. The mac and cheese was decent but was too small of portion. Would not get again, only because of size. Cole slaw was tasty enough. Not usually a fan, but ate my sons as well. Would definitely recommend, but would take out if you can.

AWSOME!!! I'm definitely a fan of Smoque! We thought we were there early to beat the dinner rush but even at 5 pm, the line was pretty long but by the time we left, the line was out the door and around the corner. We waited 30 minutes to place our order and another 20 minutes to get our food to-go but well worth the wait!! We ordered the brisket (sliced not chopped) platter with 2 sides along with an add-on order of the St. Louis 1/4 rack ribs. 1. Brisket: Absolutely Delicious - 5 star Very moist and so tender...the BBQ sauce is very tangy and not as thick as other BBQ sauces. 蔍t's not really sweet either...more spicy and with a vinegar tang to it. 2. 蔛t. Louis Ribs - 5 star 1/4 rack = 3 pieces of juicy ribs Come with it's own unique sauce that is thicker than the brisket sauce and not as tangy but goes very well with the ribs 3. Slaw - 5 star Reminds me of sauerkraut and nothing like your KFC slaw. 蔍t's just finely shredded cabbage with blk pepper with a tangy kick (once again, not sweet) 4. Peach cobbler - 3 star I haven't had many peach cobblers so I really cannot be a judge of this dessert but it can be best described as canned peaches with a gooey cinnamon/sugar base with some sort of bread/butter/sugar crumb topping. 蔍 had one bite and the hubby at the rest but let's just say that he devoured it ^^

Being raised in farm country, the son of a hog farmer, working at a hog processing plant... I KNOW my pork dear readers. So believe me when I say that this was some of the BEST pork ribs and brisket I have EVER eaten. The staff was friendly and effiecient despite how crazy and busy the place is. And despite understandably long line of people waiting to get their hands on some damn fine food, the staff keeps things moving very well. The ambiance is a bit lacking, the noise level is a bit high, and there isn't a whole lot of room. BUT what it does have is some of the best BBQ that there is! And it is also BYOB and don't charge a corking fee, so bring some beer or wine of your own to enjoy with your meal! I had the chopped Brisket sandwich (which comes on sweet Hawaiin roll buns!), with cornbread, fries, and a taste portion of their ribs. EVERYTHING was fantastic and some of the best I've ever had. The menu is a bit spartan, but what they do have they do VERY well and frankly I love seeing a place that does a few things perfectly than try to serve many mediocre dishes. If you love BBQ pork and chicken you will love this place. I will definitly be coming back here as many times as I can!

A little while back I was researching BBQ joints in the city when I came across Smoque. 蔍t had a ton of great reviews and had been featured on Guy Fieri's "Diners, Drive-Ins and Dives". �You can see the segment here.) 蔍t looked pretty darn good so I thought I should probably give it a go. What I learned from the show is that the guy that opened this place had little restaurant experience and no professional cooking experience. 蔋e was just an IT guy who decided he'd "rather make ribs". 蔛o he and a couple of his buddies traveled around the country figuring out BBQ. 蔜hey decided not on one style, but a variety of styles from the likes of Texas, Tennessee, and the Carolinas. 蔏inda cool, I thought. The other great thing about the menu is that there are plenty of different combo options for maximum sampling. 蔠e ended up with 3 meats and 3 sides between 2 of us. The St. Louis Ribs were definitely delicious. 蔜he held together when you needed them to but were super tender to bite into. 蔊ood and smoky with plenty of sauce for dipping. Here you see our half and half sandwich. 蔍t's pulled pork in the foreground and sliced brisket behind. 蔅oth delish but for me, hands down, the brisket wins the grand prize. 蔍'd go so far as to say that next time, I'd skip the others and eat A LOT of brisket. We were less enthused over all with the sides, especially the beans. 蔏ind of disappointing after watching the video and getting excited to try them. 蔜hey were just way too sweet for me. 蔜he slaw, too, was a little less than exciting. The mac 'n' cheese, however, merits its own picture. 蔜his was dangerously delicious. 蔄ll I had to say about it was, "Oh my God. 蔜his is what mac 'n' cheese is supposed to taste like?" 蔍've never been a mac 'n' cheese person but maybe because I've never had a good one. 蔝ntil now. 蔍t was creamy and cheesy and moist. 蔔ot at all dry and sticky with pasta so overcooked it's impossible to stab, like most versions I've tasted in the past. 蔜his one was worth the calories! I have to say that I'm a little sad that we didn't try the peach cobbler. 蔕h, well. 蔔ext time. The place is obviously a quick-serve restaurant. 蔞ery casual as you can see by the styrofome containers and plastic ramekins. 蔣ou order at the counter and hope that there's a seat available for the 'host' to direct you to. 蔜hey'll call your number in a few minutes for you to go up an retrieve your food on a cafeteria tray. I think we must've walked in at just the right moment because as soon as we sat down, the line had stretched all the way out the door. 蔜he good news is that these guys crank it out so even if you do have to wait, it's not for long. 蔅ut that also applies to you so just know that this is not a place to linger. 蔍t's just understood that you are expected to get up the immediately after you've finished. 蔝nderstandable, though.

OMG - can I say BBQ heaven???!!! 蔔ow I'm no bbq expert, but this is damn good food. 蔍 make the 20 mile car ride once a month to treck out to this little hole in the wall bbq joint. 蔍've had the sliced brisket, 蕄ulled pork, Texas sausage, BBQ beans, corn bread, peach cobbler, and cole slaw. 蔍 love the sliced the brisket, and their cornbread. 蔜he cornbread is moist, brisket is tender, and their bbq sauce is very tasty. 蔖ulled pork is delicious, but I prefer the brisket. 蔜he Texas sausage is a very yummy, smokey sausage. 蔜heir cole slaw is vinegar based and no mayo. �Although there usually is a line, the restaurant has a good workflow of how you order, how you get seated and you pick up your food when your number is called. 蔍t's fairly fast and fairly priced good food.

St. Louis ribs were fantastic, seasoning very well done and very juicy. Didn't like the fries as much, but they were still good with the BBQ sauce. Slaw was fresh. Didn't like the cornbread as much as I would would have thought. �But maybe it was because I already had dinner before... dinner.

This BBQ here is OMG DELICIOUS. I went here becuase Guy Fieri recommended this place and he has yet to lead me to a horrible place. The line was out the door and around the corner, but it was worth the wait. I ot my food to go because the place didn't have any seats. 蔍 waited and had my food within an hour. The beef brisket is so tender, the cornbread is full of pieces of corn, the chili has a smoked tasted and the coleslaw is made just how I like it, with vinegar instead of mayo, YUM-O. The baked beans were perfect, I will be back, but I will phone first nex time.

The best straight up BBQ in the city, with a decent edge over Smoke Daddy's. We get Smoque catered at work once a month, and I've been to the actual establishment twice. The mac and cheese is the best...ever...anywhere. Man do I wish it was good for me. The BBQ beans and the cornbread are both excellent as well. The ribs are second to none. I prefer the smokier St. Louis ribs to the more traditional Baby Back, but to each his or her own. Why argue when you can just do half a slab of each anyways? The brisket, pulled pork, and chicken are all awesome too with the chicken being a real standout to me. Usually chicken at a BBQ place is either super dry or mad greasy. Smoque's is just moist and flavorful. I don't remember the names of the sauces, but there are two main ones which really go well with the meat they are intended for. The restaurant itself is what it should be: a stripped down little joint with plastic benches, a counter to order at, and no frills. The service is very friendly and more than happy to help you make a decision. Oh, and the peach cobbler kicks ass too. I don't even really like peach cobbler. Or do I?

My biggest complaint about Smoque is that it's closed on Monday, but they are still cooking and the smell is fabulous if you are walking through the neighborhood. My mouth is watering right now just thinking about it. Other than that, I have nothing but positive things to say about this small storefront in the Old Irving Park neighborhood. My family goes to Smoque on an average of once/week: on the way to school, on the way home from school and at various times in between. My 8-year-old would probably rank this as his #1 restaurant in the neighborhood -- we go for a bag of piping hot, fresh-cut fries to share on the way home from school on Friday afternoons. My 4-year-old prefers Hot Woks, Cool Sushi, but he's unlikely to turn down a side of Smoque mac & cheese -- served with a nice crust of breadcrumbs on the top. My 6-year-old, a latent picky eater, turns up her nose at the kids' mac & cheese (served without the breadcrumbs and therefore a bit runnier)...and then promptly finishes the bowl. The portions at Smoque are generous, almost to a fault. I usually order from the children's menu, opting for a mini brisket sandwich (both chopped and sliced are great) & fries and a side of crunchy cole slaw. I'm sated, but not overfull and it makes a weekday lunch at Smoque more affordable. If a giant portion of meat is not your thing, the salad -- with or without smoked chicken (unavailable otherwise) -- is pretty tasty. I've tried about 85% of their menu and it's all great. My husband likes the ribs and baked beans and my oldest child digs the pulled pork sandwiches. I do not like the mayonnaise-y cole slaw served in most restaurants, but I love Smoque's vinegar-and-honey version. Communal seating may bother some -- especially if you happen to be in on a Tuesday afternoon with a crowd of Chicago's finest in uniform -- although it minimizes wasted space in a popular restaurant where there is pretty much always a line. However, I've had some lucky accidents in seating arrangements and am seated next to or see someone I know three times out of five. Smoque also provides catering for private parties. I've ordered from them for family parties and it's a big hit and very easy.

If any place I know in the city of Chicago can be described as 'finger licking good', it is Smoque BBQ. Off the beaten path, this little shop of glorious smoked meat creations provides a small menu, but big flavor. I found my way here after a catered event by Smoque to try their foodums first hand. And I was thoroughly impressed to say the least. The meat is perfectly seasoned, and absolutely melts in your mouth. The mac n' cheese oozed with goodness. The BBQ sauce was heaven sent. And don't you dare leave without the cobble. It was PACKED on a Wednesday evening when I ventured it, and I had to wait a bit... but it was worth it. If you are a fan of BBQ, you will be a fan of Smoque.

What more can be said about this place? Don't let the website fool you. 蔜his is somewhere between BBQ pit and hole-in-the-wall. 蔍n the best possible way. 蔈verything we had was great - my favorite was the brisket but the pulled pork, ribs and chicken were all perfectly cooked, heavily seasoned, and most definitely fork-tender. 蔜he mac & cheese was deliciously cheesy and fired on top and served in an adorable little foil ramekin. 蔄nd the best of all - the sauce! 蔜he vinegar BBQ sauce has a heavy dose of smoky, sweet and sour, in just the right proportions. If you walk into a place and most of the customers are significantly overweight and wearing smiles on their faces, you know the place is either gluttonously unhealthy, absurdly delicious, or both. 蔛moque is probably not particularly good for you... but it can stand up to any BBQ in the city.

It's a nice yet small dining area. Try the sampler because you can't go wrong. My wife doesn't care for coleslaw but here it's vinegar based and taste very good and she loved it. The brisket and sausage link were good and you can't go wrong with the pulled pork. The ribs are way better than Fat Willy's Ribs by far so give this place a shot.

We met another couple for dinner here and found the dry rub ribs tender and delicious. The default sauce, was a little disappointing compared to how well prepared & cooked the meat was - the sauce was trying too hard, but next time (!) I will explore sauce options, there were choices, but as this was my first time, I was curious to see what I would get. The sides (corn bread, (vinegar) slaw & peach cobbler) were just "OK", by comparison. The corn bread was tasty without applying butter, but nothing to write home about. The Peach Cobbler was OK, but I think that I was in the mood because reflecting back (1 hour ago), there wasn't anything that really stood out. I'm not a big fan of vinegar slaw, in general, that being said, this was well prepared, good proportions of pepper, cabbage & vinegar (I ate it all). My wife had the brisket it was also very well seasoned & cooked (I got to taste). The brisket sauce was different than the BBQ sauce that came with the ribs and was tasty (IMHO). She liked her Mac & Cheese, which she is very picky about. Given the "atmosphere" & seating accommodations, I was a little surprised that it was over $30 for two dinners. That being said, the food came up (#1) reasonably quick and the table was cleared inoffensively. Smoque is near the top of my heap for casual bar-b-q.

I've got to start this review off with one word..... Disappointment!! I finally was able to make it to Smoque last night with my friend and was really not that thrilled! My other friends have been going on and on about this place saying it was amazing and I just didn't feel it. 2 Stars for logistics and set up of this restaurant: It's so difficult to get a table and you have to wait for a while just to be seated on top of your neighbor. There's one area for drinks that is in the far corner and you're bumping into people just to move. Plus the cups they give you are so small for water, you might as well plan on getting up multiple times just to get enough water. We did move through the line pretty quick considering how packed but still, not a pleasant experience. 3.5 stars for food: Yeah, the BBQ is good, but it's NOT GREAT/AMAZING/EARTH SHATTERING. The portions are decent and the food has some flavor. Sauces are unique and have a kick. The fries are great. The food is priced on the expensive side however. I've had better so I'm sorry to say I can't give it an amazing rating. BYOB - this is a BYOB place so you can bring your own beer, which is pretty cool. If you're not going to drink I suggest you bring your own cup or plan on making many a trips to the fountain. I told my friend after we were done. Maybe if the place was not so packed and such a cluster f*ck, then i might give this another whirl.

I'm so glad my new place is a few blocks from here. The food is good, and the prices are fantastic. The combo meals are well-worth the price; go with the fresh cut fries. The sauces are the real deal; none of that fake, watery stuff from Cisco Food Systems. My only gripe about this place is the whole ordering and seating system. It's rather confusing to see signs telling you to queue in one place and then have a host or hostess tell you where to go next, including your table.

BIGGEST TIP-BRING YOUR OWN BEER! The smell from the door made me even more hungry then I already was! We arrived on a late Friday evening with a large group with the line out the door. We were all seated together in about 30 minutes, this place MOVES! 蔍 had a pulled pork sandwich which turned out to be a group favorite. 蔍 would definitely recommend it ! 蔒y only tip for next time is that I would order the fries as a side, I ate quite a few of my friends who ordered them! Parking lot is in the back for customer use so that was a HUGE plus. It was worth the drive outside of the downtown area.

Four of us split: pulled pork, brisket, 1/2 rack 蕂f baby back ribs, and a 1/2 rack of STL cut ribs. The baby backs and the pulled 蕄ork were as good as advertised...but the stars of the ball..were the brisket and the STL ribs. The brisket was probably the best I have had out of Texas...but not the best of the meal. For those who do not know..the STL �Saint Louis) is a squared spare rib cut. 蔍t makes a uniform cut..but it was what the pitmasters @ Smoque did to that was crazy good. Of the 3 who normally favored -- baby back ribs...we all admitted that the STL cut..was the best pork rib we had tasted in our 35-40 years. 蔍t 蕎as as close as one could achieve to bacon..in BBQ. We had to order an extra rack to satisfy everyone when a 1/2 slab was adequate for one. Sides: Mac and 蔆heese was cheesy and excellent. BBQ beans were very adequate. Cole Slaw and Fries were the weak components of a 5 star meal. I would have been blown away by the pulled pork and baby backs.. but so glad we chose to pull ourselves out of our element.

The BBQ is good, although I have to say not my favorite. 蔠e've never eaten in, always ordered and picked up, the service is great though. The ribs are FANTASTIC! 蔐ove them and don't need sauce on them because they are SO flavorful! 蔅aked beans are amazing, incredible flavor. 蔣UM! My biggest issues: 1. 蔠ithout the sauce, not much flavor to the meat - whether its the beef brisket or the pulled pork. 蔠ith the sauce, good flavor, but I like meat that stands alone and doesn't require the sauce. 2. 蔛ides are very small, even when you order the big ones... a family can go broke trying to get sides to go with their meal. Yes, we will order from Smoque again, have done so a few times now, but will probably stick to ribs because that is what we enjoy the most.

Saw this on Guy's show awhile back. Finally got around to going there. 4pm on a Tuesday, and we walked in, ordered, and had food in under 10min. Go at random times to avoid the crowd. Great Brisket(shaved/sliced) Great fries, cornbread, mac/cheese, slaw, BBQ sauce. Ribs were very good, and the reason I didn't give it 5 Stars. My issue with them was they were a little inconsistent. Half of my 1/2 slab was great, half was good. If they all tasted like the great 1/2, it would've been 5 Stars! Great job there! I will definitely go back! ALL Brisket next time! I'm allergic to pork, but still eat it if I feel like its worth a stomach cramp to eat! haha

I'm not a BBQ connoisseur by any means, but this place is delicious, no doubt about it. It's true that you will generally have to wait for your food (abt 15 min. for us at 2:20PM on a weekday) and you will probably have to wait for a table (but your food will be timed to your seating). However, Smoque doesn't seem to have either dropped the ball in either its organization or its setup. Smoque is simply too popular and it's dealing with that in the most sensible way possible. So instead of hovering over people as you might do in HK, Smoque has a dude who asks you if you're eating in or out and places you on a list for seating accordingly. If you think about the space, Smoque isn't actually tiny or cramped. It has tables and seats for at least 40 people. It just seems that way because those seats are always filled. In any case, if you're whining about the wait ... you're contributing to its popularity so it seems a bit circular. IDK Anyway, I enjoyed everything I ate. My only gripe in terms of the food is portion size (again) I know, but this time of the sides. I know the focus is on the meat, in my case - baby back and st. louis ribs, but I do wish that some of the sides (Mac 'N Cheese, Baked Beans) were a little (a lot) larger. I don't know that if you order them separately instead of as part of a platter if they'll be any larger, but the side orders that come with a platter are definitely not sized to share. The only exception to this is the bag of their steak cut fries, which are delicious. As for the food itself. St. Louis Ribs were very tender and moist, the baby back ribs less so - but apparently this has to do with sauce distribution. The mac 'n cheese was the tastiest version I've had for a while without any graininess and it definitely tasted of real cheese and not that cheez whiz stuff. Baked beans were just delicious. Cornbread was a little on the dry side if you were to eat it by itself but paired well with the ribs. I also love how the coleslaw is not mayo-based (vinegar instead). It provides a really welcome interlude of crunchy sour fiber. The meal for 3 people came out to about $50 for two platters of ribs that we couldn't finish. Each platter came with about 12 ribs. Platters come with slaw and your choice of 2 sides. Smoque is also michelin-starred (I assume 1 star but feel too lazy to fact-check), if you're interested in that kind of stuff.

Saddened, disappointed, but still going to go back for another try. 蔒y chicken was VERY PINK inside, which made my godmother shy away from eating it. 蔠hen I called the restaurant to complain, they assured me that it was smoked for 2 hours, low and slow, and that it was customary for it to have that pink hue....The manager apologized and said that he would reimburse me for the chicken, but that transaction it yet to be completed and it's well over 2 months The brisket was pretty good, although it needed some of the sauce for it to have nice flavoring. 蔍 don't really see it standing alone. 蔜he mac and cheese was GA-REAT. 蔊reat texture, great flavor, well seasoned, good cheese to pasta ratio. �I'd give it another shot because an Elite high in my book, J.P, gave some recommendations that said would knock my socks off. 蔖retty good in house service, so maybe two's a charm.

Let me tell you, being from Texas I have very high expectations when it comes to good BBQ because I grew up on the best...Smoque did not disappoint. Never mind the fact that I had to wait in a long line out the door @ 4:00p.m. in the afternoon, and then 20 minutes later I'm at the front giving my order, the smell was enough to make me unconscious. There's not better aroma than that of good BBQ. I got the BBQ brisket, sausage, coleslaw, BB baked beans, and a roll in a timely fashion and it was delicious. The only thing else I could've asked for was fried okra. #nomnomnom The portions were Texas-sized. The meat was tender, juicy, and smoked to perfection and the BBQ sauce was just the right amount of smoky and sweet. And for dessert, I had peach cobbler. It was the best peach cobbler I have ever had. The peaches were warm and juicy. The crust was crispy, yet moist and sweet. It was fairly priced, but the size of the joint and the location are not very accommodating. They ought to consider expanding, if they remain that busy. Two Texas Thumbs up for Smoque...

This is a BBQ joint done right. A simple menu, quick counter service, and a delicious product. Yeah, the place is freakin' popular, and yeah, they've shoved in as many tables as possible so that people have enough room to eat. It isn't a huge location, and that is half of what makes it great.

Best. BBQ. Ever. The staff was very helpful in making sure our group of 6 was seated together, no mean feat, considering how busy the place was. The staff also does a good job keeping things moving, without trying to rush one out of the place. As for ambiance, well, it's a BBQ joint. I saw families and people from every walk of life. It can be a bit loud in there, with everyone talking. (Which kinda surprised me. The food is so great, you'd think you'd only hear moans of ecstasy, but yeah, some people actually manage to talk!) I had the sliced beef brisket and St. Louis ribs. 蔍t was an orgasmic experience. The brisket was buttery and falling-apart tender. The ribs (being ribs) were slightly less so but oh-so-tasty! I preferred the dipping sauce that came with the ribs to that for the brisket, but both were really damn tasty. I especially appreciated the fact that you can order "A taste" portions which is great if you want to try EVERYTHING or are trying to watch the calories. Would I go back? Yes, in a heartbeat. And drag my friends. And people off the street. 蔊reat food for a very reasonable price. Go there. FYI, they have kids' menu items too. Also, drink is BYOB, with no corking fee. So I had mead with my BBQ.YUM! Go there.

My recent craving for everything BBQ led us to Smoque on our recent visit to Chicago. The tiny corner shop had a line out the door when we arrived, which moved fast, but was just long enough for us to have a contentious debate about what combination of ribs/brisket/pork and sides to order. If only they offered an "everything" sampler! We settled on the baby back ribs (the St. Louis ribs weren't available that night) with BBQ beans and mac and cheese for the sides, and added the sampler portion of the sliced brisket. Even though it seemed every inch of the place was full, we were led to an empty section of the table immediately after ordering. We had our food within minutes and our first taste of the extra smoky BBQ beans had us wishing we could get a bucket of them. 蔔ot that we would have had room with the substantial portion of ribs, brisket and the thick and creamy mac and cheese with a generous topping of crunchy crumbs. Even though I ate more than I should have, I kept sneaking a peak at the tiny side of individually baked peach cobbler on the tray next to me wishing I could just sneak a taste. Next time we're in Chicago, it would definitely be worth going back.

The only small complaint is that there can be a wait depending on the night. Who can fault a place for being popular though. Great food at a fair price.

Best Mac and Cheese and I could bathe in the cole slaw... (shout out to no mayo!). Brisket is cool as well. You have to wait in line a la Hot Doug's which is kind of annoying sometimes... especially because if I'm going to wait in a Hot Doug's style like, I'd like to see Doug at the end of it... or at least the same face every time... �no matter- the food is good. 蔋ighly recommended.

Smoque has some of the best BBQ I've had in the city. 蔄s other yelpers have said, you will want to get there early. 蔕n a weeknight you should be able to order and enjoy your dinner if you get there around 615, but come 7pm it's a packed house and seats can be hard to come by. 蔍 had the chicken and pulled pork and the sauce really made the meal. 蔜he side dishes were good but nothing to write home about. �Deal Tip: They have a parking lot you can 蕌se on weekdays located directly behind the restaurant to avoid Chicago's favorite Laz Parking.

Everyone loves Smoque...its been talked about, reviewd, and talked about somemore. Mary had been here a few time...and this was my first trip. Line: of course Service...pretty good....food came fast. We ordered the pulled pork...brisket and a taste of ribs. side of mac and cheese. Pulled Pork to me was lill dry...brisket was juicy,tender and had a nice dark bark to it...with pleanty of Smoque to it. Very tasty one of the best I have had so far...ribs we very smoky and had a good smoke ring to them...jus a tad bit strong...but not overpowering. The biggest hit for Me tho was the Link Meat/Texas Sausage very very good! That was the big surprise of the day...LOVED IT! Huge flavor...just the right amount of smoke, and depth. Mary loved the brisket...didnt like the ribs...and said the same that I did about the pulled pork. Smoque was good overall...maybe a tad overrated, to Me. I wasnt left blown away like most ppl. Worth a spot in the Top 5 in a BBQ list.

I heart this place a lot! A LOT!! Love their BBQ and pulled pork. By far the best I have found and I've always on a mission for good BBQ. I love that you get extra sauce when you order since I'm an "extra sauce" type of girl. This is my favorite place to go for lunch. Great atmosphere and while it's a little busy during the lunch hours, it is definitely worth it. I've talked to the owner a few times and I love how he's always there and enthusiastic about his restaurant. For the record, I wasn't a big BBQ fan before this place, but Smoque changed it all for me. I didn't know it could be so great! Gotta get the fries...they're pretty tasty and come in a paper bag.

Just writing this review makes me want another order of Smoque's baby back ribs. 蔜hey were exactly the way I want ribs to be - not falling off the bone like they were done in a slow cooker but smoky, meaty, and requiring some actual teeth to consume. 蔜he sauce was great too, although fans of sweet-style BBQ sauces (like most types of Sweet Baby Ray's, for instance) may be disappointed because the Smoque sauce has a little kick to it and definitely isn't sweet. �I had mac and cheese and peach cobbler as the sides. 蔜he mac and cheese is very heavy and creamy so a small side portion is all you need. 蔜he cobbler was my least-favorite part of the meal (although I ate the whole thing, so that should tell you something). 蔜he cobbler topping was awesome and crunchy, but the peach stuff underneath was incredibly sweet. 蔙eally needed some unsweetened whipped cream or something to cut the sugar. 蔍 would skip it next time. A note about the line & wait time: We were a party of 3 and went at prime time on a Friday night. 蔜he line was clear to the door and every single table was occupied. 蔠e figured we were screwed and there was no way on earth we would end up getting a table - but we were wrong. 蔍 don't know how they manage to do it, but somehow each and every group we saw was seated immediately upon ordering. 蔍'll chalk it up to BBQ magic.

Oh man.......YES, What was a nice Jewish woman like me doing eating, no relishing St. Louis style pork at Smoque?! WHY its because it is the best damn BBQ around and I don't follow those kosher laws. IF God didn't want me to eat pork, He would't have made it so dang good. Okay........people, get the pulled pork. IT is tender and juicy and you can just have plateful after plafetul. Our waiter explained the rub that they use on the meat.......it is spicy, but not too spicy. Just a nice little kick which I found rounded out the meal. I prefer traditonal southern sides like mac and cheese or cole slaw both of which are DE--LISH here.........if you have room have a cobbler.......My GOD. This is why pigs aren't kosher.......I think that God is saving them for HEAVEN. Right here on earth....Smoque. LOVE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

MMM indulgence.... picture: decadent, charred, smokey, tender meat. All the meat. Two different sauces... one sweetish and thick, the other... juicy and pungent Mac & Cheese: Thick, crispy, tangy, creamy, perfection Peach Cobbler: Sweet, crumbly, fruity, and warm Texas Sasuage: Crisp casing, juicy... PEPPERY but not overpowering, juicy, melt to your knees sasuage. (not a fan of savory cornbread, so I'll leave my image of it out) Oh how I want to run there this instant! I want to give this place 5 stars, but I don't go often to BBQ restaurants so I don't have much to compare it to. I used to eat normal chicago bbq... but now, I'll never go back! This place is meat heaven. Please remember, its best to take it home, I've never been able to eat there without getting elbowed in the ribs or get my hands stuck to the sticky table. The only reason why I stay away more than I want to is the crowds.. sometimes, its just too much :(

This was the best pulled pork that I ever ate! I'm in love with this place! I'm not a meat or BBQ lover but I have to admit that my meal was amazing! �I had pulled pork with fries, corn bread and coleslaw... It was terrific! The sauce is really good!

This is by far the BEST BBQ I've ever had! I have to get the beef brisket every time, despite my contemplation to go for something different for once....BUT I love the brisket and by the time I get there, I've already made my mind up that I want that again. Haha. (That's when I just start trying things off of my boyfriend's plate) ;-) Anyway, the fresh-cut fries are to die for, the coleslaw is the best around, and the mac-and-cheese side option is awesome. Oh...and it's an absolute MUST to save room for dessert! I must warn however, that when it's busy, parking is a pain in the butt to find! However, if you're willing to drive around for awhile waiting for a street spot to open up, or if you want to just park in Timbucktu and hike it back...it's well worth the effort!

So, I learned about this place from DDD, and every time I drove by, I would see a long line of people waiting to enter the restaurant. So I was smart and ordered take-out. I ordered the pulled pork sandwich with a side of mac-n-cheese, and my hubby got the brisket sandwich w/a side of BBQ beans. It was good, but definitely more hyped up than anything. The meat was tender, and it comes with a side of their sauce, which we poured on to combat the dryness of both meats. The coleslaw was delicious, as was the mac-n-cheese and bbq beans. And the peach cobbler was great, too. So overall, okay, would I come here again? Honestly, unless I was starving and this place was the only thing nearby, probably not. 蔍 just don't see myself craving this place. I have yet to try their ribs, so maybe on another rainy, boring day, I'll give them a shot again.

Awesome sides, awesome service, not the best pulled pork in town. I love pulled pork, probably too much for my own good, so I was really looking forward to eating here after having heard such glowing reviews. Maybe it was the anticipation, maybe it was a bad day, but I was sorely disappointed. The pork was just barely OK - way too dependent on the BBQ sauce for flavor, and way too tender. What's too tender, you ask? Well, if you could take the pork and sell it as baby food, you may have crossed the line from "tender" to "mushy." I didn't know this was possible to do with meat, but Smoque showed me that it is. The sides, however, were incredible. Probably the best baked beans I've ever had, and the macaroni and cheese was really great too. The restaurant smells delicious, and you shouldn't be intimidated by a line running out the door because this place runs like a well-oiled machine. The staff gets things done. I'd definitely love to come back and try something other than the pulled pork, or maybe just have a big vat of those delicious baked beans - worth a star all on their own.

Smoque has been making quality bbq for hordes of patrons for a few years now. I have always gone for the brisket, which is consistently excellent, and sometimes enjoy the pulled pork, which is also outstanding. I am not a rib fan, I don't generally enjoy meat off the bone. Perhaps this invalidates my opinion to hard core bbq fans. I apologize. I will say this, however, I do love me some ribs from Smoque. Damn, these guys know what they're doing. I had the pleasure of living mere blocks away from Smoque, so I could often catch them during their "slow" hours, so the door-escaping lines were not often a problem for me. If you're anything like me, and don't really want anything "green" on your plate when consuming bbq (vegetables have their uses - accompanying bbq is not one) ask to sub corn bread for slaw. Also ask for a side of both kinds of sauce to maximize your smoque experience.

Holy Smoques. Been here many many times and it never disappoints. Most recently, my lunch partner and I shared a brisket platter with cornbread, mac & cheese, a 1/2 and 1/2 sammich, fries, cole slaw, and peach cobbler. Everything was delectable. 蔜he peach cobbler is silly good, like about to have a crisis good. 蔄ll of the meat we had (which was a lot) was tender and juicy. We went around 2:30 on a Sunday and there was plenty of seating inside and only a few people in line ahead of us. 蔠ant the ultimate test in self control? Live within a couple blocks of Smoque and try to not go there everyday. Fortunately, I have since moved and my cholesterol has thanked me.

After a day of turmoil and trouble, my boyfriend and I decided to have a date night in. 蔙ibs was his request of the night and, although we love Gale Street Inn for their ribs, I wasn't in the mood so, after a terrible first experience, we decided to give Smoque a second try. We went there on a Friday evening for pick up and, unlike the first time, didn't even have to wait in a line. 蔠e walked up to the counter, grabbed two paper menus (as the chalkboard menu gives my eyes hell) and stepped to the side. 蔄bout 3 minutes later, we were approached by one of the employees who asked us if we had any questions and, upon our decline, politely excused himself but made sure to tell us where we could find him if we changed our mind. We finally decided and, again, were able to approach the counter immediately. 蔜he counter help was beyond friendly. 蔠hen I asked her how the brisket chili was, she offered me her opinion, mentioned she likes it with Tabasco sauce and offered me a sample. 蔛ample? Sure! 蔈xcept that the sample was an ala carte sized side of the chili which we devoured while we waited for our actual order to be ready. He chose the St. Louis Style Ribs w/ Corn Bread & French Fries. 蔜he ribs were rich in smokey flavor, moist, tender but still edible off the bone (without crumbling). 蔜he corn bread was average and, although I'm not huge on french fries, there is something about the aroma of theirs that makes me sneak a few out of his bag when he's not looking. 蔍 chose the Sliced Brisket w/ Brisket Chili & Mac & Cheese. �YES! 蔜he brisket chili was so good that I actually got a second side all for myself! 蔜he sliced brisket was so tender that I struggled to actually pick it up with my fork. 蔜he accommodating BBQ sauce that comes along with it on the side had the perfect amount of zest without overpowering the flavor of the brisket itself. 蔜he mac & cheese was also delicious. The only reason I'm giving them 4 stars instead of 5 is because, for the price, I believe the portions are are a little on the small side. 蔜he meat itself is substantial but the side portions are lacking just a bit. �蔜he side of brisket chili was average sized and so were the fries but, I'd like to see larger corn bread muffins (or offer two for the price you're charging for one) and larger mac & cheese portions, for sure! I should mention they are 蔅YOB joint, as well! 蔠e plan to dine in on our next experience - the pulled pork is the next thing on my menu! So glad we tried this again! 蔜he first time was just a fluke and, honestly, probably more so on our end then Smoque's. :)

Not that Smoque needs ANOTHER review...but alas here I am. I suggested going here for lunch with my boyfriend and I got major points for the suggestion!!! We went at 3pm on a Saturday in the pouring rain and the line was still out the door. If that doesn't speak volumes for their food I don't know what would. (tip- they have Smoque umbrellas inside for the diehards willing to wait in the rain) As far as food, I had only ever had the ribs which are delish. My bf ordered the beef brisket and let me say...I was converted. I can't wait to go back and order my own!! Great place!

I've been to Smo que dozens of times. I was tipped off about this place by my former boss when I noticed from his expense account that he ate here every week. Kind of a trek from the office but I was game. I haven't looked back and make sure I arrive before 11:30am at Smo que to first get a good parking spot on Pulaski and second to beat the crowd before the line forms out the door. The Beef brisket is heavenly, the best that I have ever had as far as BBQ. What I like about Smo que is that they have the barbeque sauce already on the meat. I hate squeezing barbeque sauce out of a bottle. The beans are the best I have ever had, the fries are freaking amazing as well. You can get out of there for about $13 for lunch and don't need to eat for the rest of the day. Sometimes I even order take out to eat later in the week since I didn't live close to Smo que. If you need a good laugh, read Smo que's Manifesto on their website. I crave Smo que more than ever since I ditched the Chicago scene to live in Arizona. I can't wait to get my "Smo que on" this coming summer.

Go there for the brisket - it was some of the best most tender brisket i've had. 蔈verything else - pulled pork, sausage, and ribs were just so-so. 蔙ibs in particular was a bit tougher/drier than i was hoping for....Mac & Cheese and cornbread were good sides though.

Definitely one of my favorite places to eat in the city. Especially Chicago not being know for many bbq joints it is somewhere to check out. It was a tad confusing when I first went because I wasn't sure if I needed to step in line, get a number or sit down and be waited on. But, you just order at the counter. May need a sign or line ropes? About the food itself, it was definitely one of the best BBQ places I have been to. Most of the places I have been to were in Orlando but this place definitely knocked them out. I had a half slab of baby back ribs and a side of brisket. Usually I am picky with ribs because I love Portillos/Barney's fall off the bone ribs but the ones at Smoque definitely held their own. They didn't fall off the bone as easily and weren't as moist as my favorite but they packed a lot of flavor. What I ended up falling in love with was the brisket. I was disappointed I only order a side of it. It is tender and easy to cut up (I actually only used a fork) You can order it pulled or sliced but I think its funner to eat it sliced. The atmosphere is definitely appropriate for the food. It's simple but cook use a few brighter colors or lights. But I did also go in the middle of the winter when it was gloomy everywhere. Also, place will get packed especially after dinner time so its a somewhat loud atmosphere but I didn't mind so much. Also random tip I learned from a friend. If the Chicago police are parked outside a place and are eating there you know it'll be a good place. They know the best spots to eat at!

Smokin'!! 蔛orry, I had to say it. 蔜his place was oh-so-good!! �I came here for lunch because I'd read that the restaurant routinely runs out of food and if I am going to travel all the way to Irving Park for food and I can't get any...well, Johnny T (like Wayne Brady) will have to choke a b!tch. 蔄nd I am trying to cut down on my assaults and batteries for the year. 蔜rying. So, I was armed with the address and I made my way down Pulaski from the Blue Line. 蔍t was bright, I had my sunglasses on, I was strutting, saw the address, opened the door, walked in...and it was a dentists office. 蔍 tried to play cool. 蔍 told the receptionists that I was "meeting a friend." 蔜hen I had a pretend conversation on my cell phone with my 'friend' saying that "I was at the office and she could pick me up now..what was that...oh, if you are running late, that is fine. 蔍'll walk around. 蔍 feel a little awkward waiting at this office anyway..." 蔄nd I left. 蔍 am sure the receptionists were laughing at me. Walking next door (and trying to reclaim some cool), I finally entered Smoque. 蔜here were a decent amount of people sitting but still some empty tables. 蔍 sauntered up to the register, ordered a pulled pork sandwich with slaw and fries and a soda. 蔠ith tax (hi Todd!), that was $10.14. 蔔ot bad. 蔍 went to the soda fountain, drew some SWEET TEA (the only non-alcoholic beverage to drink with bbq) and sat my happy self down. 蔜hen I remembered I'd been on the CTA and I washed my hands in the restroom. 蔄nd used some towellettes. �In the midst of my hand-cleaning OCD, my order number was called! 蔍mmediately, I was impressed by the portion size. 蔜he sandwich is served on a thick wheat bun and there's a more-than-generous amount of pork and sauce awaiting your lips. 蔄dd to that a BROWN PAPER BAG full of fries, container of extra sauce and tub of slaw (with vinegar, not mayo; I hate mayo) and I was ready to dig in. 蔙emembering my Southern upbringing, I took a bite of my sandwich without adding sauce. 蔣um! 蔜ender, seasoned pork and just the right amount of sauce made for a flavor explosion in my mouth. 蔙emembering my gluttonous ways, I dumped the rest of the sauce on the sandwich and sopped up any extra that ran off with the bread. 蔜hat's how we get down in the dirty dirty. �I assume that I was eating like Homer Simpson because I caught some looks of horror as I gulped down sweet tea, made smacking noises as I ate my sandwich and stuffed fries in my mouth. 蔍 didn't care. 蔜here were free refills to take advantage of and food in front of me to eat. 蔜he looks are deceiving re the portion size. 蔜he folks at Smoque do not skimp on portion size. 蔍'm a big eater and I was barely able to clean my plate. 蔍 was happy that I didn't order the cobbler, as I would not have been able to eat it. �Since I was in a trance-like state as I gorged, I noticed a few things on the sparsely covered wall. �.) a crayon drawing done by a child, complete with the word "Texes." 蔍t took every bit of my self-control to not turn the "e" into an "a." 蔍 am still thinking about it. 2.)

One last free refill (and giggle at the best butt to, well, you know) and I was on my way home. 蔍 barely made it back to my place before I passed out from a full belly. 蔄nd, ladies & gents, that's good eatin'.

PROMETHEUS MUST HAVE LOVED BBQ Why else risk the fury of the gods to bring fire to mankind, than to spread the wondrous joy that is created when fire and smoke lovingly intertwine with meat to create the magic of BBQ? 蔛moque capitalizes on the titan's gift by creating some of the best BBQ in Chicago (or anywhere for that matter). �Ribs: Tried a 1/2 rack of baby backs and a 1/2 rack of St. Louis and both were superb. 蔜hey must have a masseuse in the house, because their ribs were obviously massaged with care with a heaping serving of spices that forms a crust bursting with flavor. 蔕n top of all that, they smoke their ribs so thoroughly that if I was blind I'd be convinced I was sitting in front of a camp fire. 蔅etween the rub and the smoke you really don't need any sauce, but I love sauce and Smoque's smoky-vinegary-spiced elixir really hit the mark. �Chopped Brisket: Incredible. 蔠ent for a taste ($3 add-on to my ribs) and the first bite made me think I should've flipped my order around. 蔅etter than I ever had in Texas. All in all it was a meal fit for a god...or perhaps I should say, a titan. 蔛o the next time you're chowing down at Smoque, throw a bone (or maybe some brisket) to the one who made it all possible.

Proof positive that some people in Chicago will do ANYTHING to avoid going to the south side of the city for (waaaaaay) better food http://www.yelp.com/user�. This place is crammed full of cutsieness (a mini cupcake tin of mac n cheese), small portions (a mini cupcake tin of mac n cheese?), kind of bland food (a mini cupcake tin of mac n cheese) and a bunch of people that don't know shit about barbeque (and mini cupcake tins of mac n cheese) proclaiming it all just the best thing ever. Puh-lese. The meat is all very moist and wet tasting and all, but almost completely devoid of seasoning or meaty flavor. Could be beef. Or pork. Maybe chickenish? The "peach cobbler" needs to change its name to "peach crisp" with a quickness, or else one of these days somebody's moms is going to whoop someone's ass up in there on principle - oats and nuts and shit do not a cobbler make, but the mini cupcake tin of it tasted pretty okay. But it's still not cobbler. I had to track down some Tabasco to liven up the weak sauces. Fries are really really great. Coleslaw is not. 蔍 like the kids' menu. But seriously - seriously - What is up with the jail-looking, prison-issueish, quasi-thali-esque presentation of the food here? Tin tray , lined with wax paper, meat lumped directly on that paper? Like the paper is the plate? And then tiny little tin muffin tins of sides. Is that supposed to be "authentic"? Authentic what? (-sigh-I probably really don't want to know, do I?) Look, I've lived in multiple areas of the south, and they do have themselves a lot of fucking problems, but they do (for the most part) use plates. Luckily I had zero wait time, no line and no crowd at all - trust me, it is worth none of all of that (Zagat and Guy Fieri can be damned if those bitches disagree). But if you're in the area and it's about 3-5pm with no line or anything, feel free to have yourself a decent and probably forgettable meal (as long as you don't make the critical mistake of hyping it up in your own head too much...). And the people who work here are super sweet, which always makes even mediocre food go down easier. I'll probably visit again, too - I'm not always lucky enough to be near better bbq. PS - And, fuck! I am sooo mad that Tony C. already called this place "antiseptic"-that is is the perfect fricking word, too. I don't even have another word that good. I'm about to have to check a damn thesaurus for a stupid Yelp review or something, sheesh. PPS - Seriously, that's not a cobbler. PPPS - The brisket at the South Loop Whole Foods bbq station kicks Smoque's ass...for reals... PPPPS - You know what? I really should have done this review as a music analogy. 蔐ike you know how there were a ton of versions of Hound Dog? 蔄nd the Elvis version is okay and all, but the Big Mama Thorton version is such an awesome different animal that it straight whoops Elvis's ass, but how the Elvis version is waay better that wack ass Freddie Bell and the Bellboys version? Okay, so at a real bbq place, like Barbara Ann's or something, that would be like Big Mama Thorton and the Bellboys would be like The Patio or Arby's or Famous Daves or something. 蔛moque would be almost like Elvis. 蔄nd what's wrong with that, right? People like Elvis. 蔄nd good for them, too.

My better half has had a hankering for GOOD barbeque for oh, I don't know, TWO YEARS or so. A quick search on Yelp revealed that Smokin' Woody's is nearby, but reviews were mixed. A second quick search revealed an average rating of 4 stars for some place called Smoque BBQ. We public transit over to Smoque BBQ to discover A HUGE LINE. (I returned home after our meal to discover that the place has 460 reviews, a minor oversight of mine). Okay, so this place must be good. An hour later we sit down with a sample of everything on the menu--pulled pork, brisket, chicken, ribs, mac & cheese, fries, cole slaw, and baked beans. Was it worth the wait? Hell yes. Everything was fantastic. The long line did not lie. My favorites were the pulled pork, mac & cheese, and fries. What's almost as amazing as the food is the system. Once you get in the door, a guy asks how many are in your party. He keeps an eye out to let you know where to sit. They have good insight on how long people stay and by the time you are getting your food, your spot is ready. It's really efficient. On top of all this, Smoque BBQ is BYOB. You can drink in line as you wait!

I basically starved myself all weekend in anticipation of my mini-feast at Smoque. And I'm so glad I did. Because I ate, ate and then ate some more. First of all, I think you'd be hard-pressed to walk into this joint at a time it isn't busy. On a Sunday afternoon around 4, the restaurant was full with a growing line. There's communal seating, which definitely helps speed things along. As we placed our order, our seats were pointed out to us. Within 10 minutes, our order number was called and we entered BBQ heaven. I had the pulled pork platter, which is basically a heaping pile of juicy, tender meat which I topped with the super vinegar-y cole slaw. The acidity of the cool slaw really balanced out the smoky flavors of the meat. The platter also comes with two additional sides-- albeit small, both the cornbread and peach cobbler pack a tasty punch. The sad part is that I could have kept eating after my mound of food disappeared! Luckily, my dining partner didn't judge and was kind enough to let me sample his divine brisket which was also soon gone, baby, gone. I still prefer Honky Tonk as I like their seating better but Smoque is a bit more accessible to me and let's face it, also rather delicious. And, Smoque is BYO!

I'm trying not to eat out much lately, but today was a miserable failure. Breakfast at Jam's (biscuits and gravy were good, not great) and lunch at Smoque's. I was on the Northwest side see, as one is when they're not in another location, and google maps for iphone conveniently informed me I was a mere few blocks from one of the more revered BBQ restaurants in Chi-city. Brilliantly, I made the decision to invest $11 towards keeping my weight up. The sliced brisket sandwich was off the fucking hook. Just amazing meat. The mac 'n cheese, despite a distinct lack of truffle oil, was also epic. The coleslaw, however, was flavorless and sorely lacking in calorie content. It was not mayo-based see. The restaurant is fairly clean, with 2 bussers just waiting for you to take your last bite so they can snatch your tray. There were also other randomly scattered employees who have clearly mastered their trade, but appeared none-too-happy to be working there. I caught a couple of random scowls. Maybe it's because I was dressed like a total d-bag? I rocked the untucked Polo shirt, khakis, and flip flops getup today. I might as well have had "How do I get back to Wrigleyville?" tattooed on my forehead.

Nothing to see here, move along. 蔔othing to see, move along! [pause] Are they gone? Good, those of you left behind should lean closer while I tell you about something you need to try. 蔉irst, please excuse me while I may seem rude, I need to lick this BBQ sauce off my fingers. Ahhh. The food here is simply good stuff. 蔠hile it's not the best BBQ I've ever had, it's damn tasty and it could hold its own in a smoke-down. �First up, contender #1, the pulled pork. �Standard fare, and as far as I'm concerned, the bar setter at any BBQ place. 蔞ery tender meat and I really liked the extra sauce served up on the side to add a bit more wetness, because some of us like it like that. Second up, contender #2, coleslaw. 蔕ne word: vinegar vinegar vinegar! 蔜hat counts as one because it was just repeated, right? 蔛moque does coleslaw just like I prefer and not creamy at all. 蔕nly fresh, crisp, and vinegary. 蔛nap! 蔇id I mention vinegar? Contender #3, the fries. 蔅ig, hearty, and served in a brown paper bag. 蔜hat's cool. If you go here hungry, don't order a small side of anything expecting a huge amount. 蔍t's literally a small portion. 蔄lso, don't expect a quiet, private conversation with your bestie or a date. 蔜he tables are communal and just enough elbow room to keep the person at the next table from slopping BBQ sauce your way or swiping a nibble of that brisket. BYO helps the wallet and makes the experience overall a good value. 蔜he friendly staff is the icing on the cake. The winner? 蔣our stomach. 蔈asy call.

I know the food is good, but if it's such a pain in the arse to get it, well for me, forget about it. As per usual they were out of something, tonight it was the chicken. I don't mind waiting for good food, but there's a problem when it's so crowded that you can't even get in the place to get to the counter to place a to go order. I'm glad I didn't place an order by phone, because I'd have to ask people to get me up front as if I were in a mosh pit. I've gone here many times, and I've left without food more times than I have left with food. I know most you feel the Yelp love for this place, but for me, all I'm feeling is hungry.

It's like going back to your school cafeteria where they serve some of the best ribs you've ever had. I had the 1/2 slab + chili + cornbread (b/c cornbread is where it's at, dawg). 蔣ou can add on to this meat fiesta w/ your choice of pulled pork, brisket or some sausage. 蔍'm going that route next time. 蔜he slaw was definitely unexpected. 蔍'm usually "meh" when it comes to slaw but the slaw here was pretty much a B-Side gem. 蔍t's nothing too fancy but the taste really complimented the meal well. �Oh and don't forget this is a BYO place so bring your drinks. 蔒y crew and I realized this fact a bit too late and were mumbling "beer" all throughout our stay.

I'm no BBQ auteur, but I was sorely mistaken in my expectations of ordering a half order of the sliced brisket sandwich. 蔜he sandwich was not much more than the size of a slider. 蔍 enjoyed their macaroni & cheese and the corn bread was baked to perfection. I was pleasantly surprised by how quickly we were seated and eating considering how busy the place was. 蔍f you do dine in here, it's probably best that you go in even numbers and have conversation ready that you're comfortable for your neighbors to overhear. 蔜he (creepy) guys to our left stayed an extra 20 minutes while my friend back for the holidays discussed her sexual experimentation with other women with me. The bbq sauce they serve here also throws me for a loop. 蔍t's unique, but doesn't pang of any specific region of bbq that I know of. 蔔ot to say its bad, just a little messy. 蔅ut I don't go to a bbq joint expecting to stay clean.

I've never stepped into the place, though take out RAWKS. Either dine in or pick up ALWAYS phone first and see what's left. Phone orders appear to get priority and if you've ever been victim to Smoque running out of food...this is how to increase your odds in getting what you desire. Brisket and pulled pork by the pound! only way to do it, take it home and feel like its Christmas as you unwrap the silver wrapped packages of cholesterol clogging goodness. What's even better is the leftover brisket the next day mixed into the BEST omelets EVER!

The fact that barbecue from Smoque is the only thing I could keep down the day after Yelp prom must count for something. As a native Kansas Citian, barbecue is programmed into my consciousness somewhere deep inside me. When I smell a meat smoker working its magic, I waft along on its drifts of deliciousness like a cartoon character until I'm in the door and chowing down. It also makes me instant friends with any owner of a barbecue restaurant and makes me feel, even in the throes of the worst hangover of my life, like I should suck it up, eat myself retarded and like it. Hard. Well. This was not difficult at Smoque. The whole staff, including the woman at the register who could barely speak because of her allergies, was incredibly sweet and understood that it was nothing personal that I couldn't remain standing long enough to get a good look at the menu. Once my friend (the impeccable Daniel R.) and I were seated at our table, rocking out to our amazing barbecue -- him a half slab of ribs, me a pulled pork and brisket sandwich and a huge BRICK of fries -- an employee who knew we were from the superior barbecue capital of the world came to ask us how the food was. And I continued rocking out. As in. Threw up the rock. Devil horns. Metal. AWESOME. Go there, hangover or not, and be floored by the awesomeness. Rock out.

You want some macaroni with that cheese? "MMMM" was all I heard from my son as he ate the mac n cheese, and boy was it cheesy, a little too cheesy for my taste. As for my son dairy products list number one on his food pyramid! The family traveled up to the restaurant at about 11:30am on a Friday afternoon and after hearing all of the reviews we wanted some BBQ. At about the time we ordered and were seated by the host the lunch crowd started lining up. Tables can get tight not too mention sparse when groups start piling in to the restaurant. The restaurant was clean and kept clean by the host/bus boy. He had the job of cleaning off tables and seating customers. I ordered the sliced brisket platter with cornbread and baked beans. The meat was TENDER, the flavor with the sauce served on the side was -Ful as in flavorFul, 蔮ut in my opinion the taste was not hitting the spot for me. Corn bread comes served in it's own foil cup and the beans were chock-ful of pieces of pork and onion with just the right sweetness. Cole slaw was fresh and had good proportion of tart and sweet with crunch. The other items ordered were the Baby back ribs which were also tender and flavorful and the Mac and cheese as mentioned above kid size, with a brisket sandwich (kid size), comes with fresh cut fries. Please do not get me wrong on this review. All the food was quality, and fresh, and had the yummy factor, but maybe my palate lacks in finesse and I just enjoy barbecue that is slathered with sauce that rhymes with "Sheet Fabee Ways!" I felt like I was the product of getting too much talk about something and then trying out the product for myself and finding out "It was not all that" Not bad food just not what I was looking for. Would I come back? Of course. Maybe take out and bring it back home. Or maybe I need to give this place a second chance for a first tasting kind of thing. P.S. Do not park in the residential areas. There are signs along the way that prohibits parking in certain areas.

The 5 star review parade marches on! 蔜he northside Chicago BBQ scene has always been so sad- at other places I'd learned to dose up my meat with tons of sauce to get my flavor and have been left wondering, what did the meat even taste like? �Smoque fixes that by doing it right! 蔐ong/slow smoking of the meat infuses wonderful taste, plus a nice spice rub and all I need is a little of their homemade sauce to finish what is by far the best BBQ I've had in the city. 蔍 seriously burp smokey goodness for a couple hours after pigging out here! 蔄nd I end up with extra/unused sauce!?! Their sides have all been super tasty too! 蔒y favorite is that peach cobbler counts as a side with your rib order. 蔕h yeah, they welcome BYOB too!

The first time I had tried Smoque it was shortly after they first opened and we had gotten take out. 蔍 was very under-whelmed and had no real desire to go back. 蔅ut Andy's brother wanted to go for lunch the other day, so we gave it another shot. While it certainly was no 5-star experience, I could tell they had made improvements. 蔜he brisket was juicier and was of a thicker cut (before it was served almost minced). 蔜he sauce was good, but too watery and too high of a sugar content. �The mac and cheese was lovely and creamy, but the cheese flavour did not pop through like you would expect - it tasted more like a thick white sauce with a tiny sprinkling of cheese throughout. The peach cobbler was a huge improvement which i was pleased to see. 蔵nstead of a cup full of tiny, anemic looking peach bits slathered with a tasteless crust, now we have plump yummy peach chunks under a crisp, brown oatmeal topping. 蔉or $1.95 it was a perfectly portioned, tiny bit of sugary delight. However, eating there is more difficult than giving a spoken word beat poetry performance to a room full of weak bladdered, deaf elders. 蔕h my god! 蔍f seating takes the navigational skills of a Navy Seal Commander, don't you think it is time to do something about it? 蔈xpand, move, offer take out only? 蔍t was absolutely insane and this was at 2:30 on a Sunday! I can't even imagine what a lunch hour or a Saturday during dinner would be like. 蔣ikes.

Oooh boy! I was introduced to this place by a customer of mine when she ordered the ribs from Friendship. She mentioned there was a BBQ place on Pulaski by the highway that had amazing ribs and brisket sandwiches. So, of course, I had to try it out. Sure enough, she was right, this place is awesome.

Sometimes when it comes to the power of Yelp and the "hot spots", you just become a number. 蔜his is one of those cases. 蔍'm just a number. At Smoque, simplicity is key...well that is til it comes to the intense smoquey flavors. 蔝sually I don't care for smoked foods, but here it's welcomed because they must do it right. So how it works (ordering, not barbecuing--it's probably a secret) is you jump in line, wait, order your food, [behind the scenes it's prepared via a kitchen assembly line], await your order number to be yelled, have the host seat you (or grab any seat you can find), and dig in. 蔜he messier the better--I mean it's BBQ after all! 蔎ust make sure you have your metal platter underneath and a roll of endless napkins at arm's length. 蔒ore food than necessary and delicious Mac N Cheese and Baked Beans sides. 蔍 was just recently in St. Louis and Smoque's ribs are ultra close to perfection. 蔛t. Louisians would be proud! If the owners keep up with Yelp, I see that they love keeping it to the basics (like BBQ should be) but for time's sake, they need an electronic number sign reading orders to be picked up versus having their poor employee continue to lose his voice.

It was Dad's birthday and he loves BBQ - so I suggested we order in from Smoque. We tried EVERYTHING: the brisket, pulled pork, St. Louis ribs, mac & cheese, beans, corn bread, fries and the peach cobbler. Both the brisket and the pulled pork were so tender and smokey, they come with sauce on the side. A thinner, less sweet type of sauce. Eh, i like the thick, sweet goopy stuff - but this was still tasty. I'm not a huge fans of beans, but these were fantastic with huge chunks of meat in them. Everybody seems to love the mac & cheese and it does not disappoint. The cornbread, fries and peach cobbler were good, although the cornbread was a little dry. Dad enjoyed his birthday dinner and I'm glad we ordered in - that place was packed with a line out the door. Solid good BBQ.

Restaurants in this area get too many stars simply because there is not a big selection in Portage Park/Irving. I think when something is "DECENT" the residents jump all over it. That's all this was, decent. The meat was very tender. The BBQ sauce was only adequate and too runny. I would have actually given it 3 stars based on the meat alone but I needed to even out this place because to me it definitely did not deserve all the 5 stars it has gotten. I've had MUCH better BBQ that was SO flavorful, and paid a better price for it. I didn't like any of the sides; mac n cheese or coleslaw. Both were bland. The fries were alright but I wouldn't even choose them over fast food fries. If you want great BBQ, there are better choices in the city.

First I must say, I was not excited to get BBQ. 蔝nfortunately, I worked in a rib place in my teens and am still traumatized by the smell of smoked meats. �Smoque is completely different then every other BBQ place in the city. 蔍n Chicago, it is all the norm to expect sweet, thick sauced baby back ribs, not at Smoque my friend. 蔠e are talking about a vinegar based sauce, which I'm told (mainly by the Food network) that is common in the Carolinas. 蔞inegar in BBQ?

I've enjoyed barbecue all over the country. 蔛moque is among the best that I have ever tasted. Out of all their meat options, the ribs are the most notable. Both the St. Louis, which are larger and meatier, or the baby back, which are leaner and smaller, are fantastic, and hold up well with the best from Texas or Alabama. The rub is great, the smoke flavor is excellent, and the meat is obviously of very high quality. The brisket, either chopped or sliced, and the pulled pork, are both excellent as well. The meat is lean, which may be why some reviewers find it dry. It's also why I choose the ribs over the brisket and pulled pork every time. The Texas sausage and the chicken, which I've only had in the salad, are also very, very good. The sauces are excellent. Unlike traditional Chicago barbecue, the meat is the main player here, and the sauces do not dominate the flavor. That said, both the rib sauce and the pulled pork sauce are excellent. The cole slaw is vinegary and complements the meat quite well. It is one of my favorite parts of the meal. As for the other sides, my favorites are the brisket chili (which they don't always have), the baked beans, and the fries. The mac and cheese is also good. The place is a bit cramped, and their system for organizing who sits when is effective and charming. However, I have not sat down to eat at Smoque for some time, preferring instead to phone in my order and skip the occasionally long line. It also is not a place to linger, unless you want to heartlessly deny barbecue goodness to the people in line. They also do catering, and are partly responsible for my happiest birthday party ever. I love barbecue. Smoque is the best place that I have tried in Chicago for barbecue, and is among the best places in the country. Truly a gem.

After much rescheduling with my BBQ lovin' buddies, and many dashed dreams, we finally made it to Smoque. �Unfortunately we finally made it to Smoque after Smoque finally made it on TV. 蔍 will damn Guy Fieri to Hell for making me wait in a one hour line. 蔍 am old, and I am hungry. 蔅ite me.

By far not the best ribs I've had, but some of the best I've had on the northside of Chicago. They have both "St. Louis Style" and baby back ribs. I really like that you can order 1/2 slab of each as part of a meal (or you can order 1/2 or whole slab ala carte). 蔍 ordered 1/2 of each. 蔜he babyback ribs were a little drier than I sometimes like, but still good. 蔍 much preferred them over the St. Louis style ribs, but honestly I think I just kind of got a bad cut. 蔄t least 2 of the ribs were just covered in solid gelatenous fat, which was kind of nasty. 蔜he other half wasn't like that at all. �we had ordered it to go, I might've taken them back up to the counter had I been there). �I like that the ribs are mostly just dry rub and they provide you the sauce on the side. 蔍 sometimes hate places that douse them with sauce (though I can think of some places that do it this way and it's really good...). 蔜hey give you two different kinds of sauce, I don't really remember the difference but one I liked and one I didn't like at all. The sides were great. 蔜he mac and cheese was AMAZING. 蔜he peach cobbler had a hint of almond--delicious. 蔅aked beans were better than most others. 蔆ole slaw I could do without. 蔆ornbread was good. 蔇idn't try the fries but they looked good too. The place is efficiently ran and seemed to be very well managed. 蔜here was a manager walking around and chatting with everyone to make sure they were happy. 蔜he cashier rang up our order wrong but we got it straightened out (and the manager happened to notice we went back and approached us to help her help us). 蔜he line was a good 10 people long with a single cashier. 蔍t took over 30 minutes to wait through the line and wait for our food... From my experience, this is pretty typical of any rib place I've been to, and it seemed like they were really organized about it, so I'm not complaining. The parking situation was a little iffy... They do have a parking lot behind them (only during the off hours of another business, so after 5:30). 蔠e found a spot, but the lot was nearly full. 蔜here was a guy outside in an orange vest that they had hired to deal with helping people park in the right areas. 蔜he street had some street parking but other places were zoned, and I overheard him telling someone else they had hired him because some crazy old woman was taking pictures of all the cars that parked in the wrong place. 蔍t's nice of them to hire someone, I know most places would just not worry about it and let the customer worry about being towed. I don't know who rated this 1 $, I don't think it's possible to eat for under $10. 蔜he rib meals are $18-19. 蔍f you order the cheapest thing, which is probably one of the sandwiches, it would still be more than $10 once you add drink and tax. We went with ribs in mind, but it did seem like the brisket and pulled pork sandwichers were a lot more popular (by far). 蔜hey looked really delicious, I want to go back and try the brisket.

What can I say? Come early to avoid the lines. Order: St. Louis Ribs with baked beans and peach cobbler. Maybe a little brisket on the side... you know you want it. Taste of meats? Genius! And that runny vinegary BBQ sauce? Please send a thermos to my house. I will happily drink it for sustenance. I love you Smoque!

Wow, I never thought BBQ could be this good. But it can. And it is. At Smoque BBQ just about 15 minutes outside downtown Chicago. I would give it 6 stars if I could. Recco'ed by JL who has never disappointed and really knows her eats. Keep your friends close and your foodie friends closer. Nestled on a street lined with small businesses and residential homes, the brick building stood out with the name painted right on it. The minute we walked in, the smell of BBQ wrapped around you like a warm hug. Mmmm...barbequey hugs are the best. The atmosphere was like being in someone's garage. One wall held a huge chalk board with the menu. I didn't have to look far before deciding on a 1/2 slab of baby back ribs with 2 sides for about $14. I originally chose mac and cheese and coleslaw as my sides, but happily found out that the meal already came with slaw and so I ecstatically selected cornbread. Tears almost came to my eyes as I realized they served Coke. After being at multiple places in the city, I was beginning to think the entire state of Illinois only served Pepsi. But there is was, a self-serve fountain soda machine with Coke clearly written on the side. Some guy told us to order our food first and he would put together a table for our party of 5. The entire place probably only seated about 25 or 30 people. We were seated by the window, right next to the counter where the food came out. We probably waited about 10 minutes, maybe less before our orders were called. You help yourself to plastic utensils and there are plenty of napkin dispensers on the tables. Important detail: the napkins came out from the top so they were easy to pull with your bbq-laden hands. Very important to have easy access to napkins. Anyway, the ribs were flavorful, juicy and fell off the bone. They give you extra sauce and it was probably the best BBQ sauce I've ever had. I wanted to stick a straw into it and drink it. The cornbread was so warm, the crust was perfect and the bread was moist. It and the mac and cheese, so cheesy, so yummy, both came in these little aluminum containers that were the perfect size. Anymore and it would've been overkill. The slaw was vinegar-based, not mayo-based, so it was interesting and different, but in a great way. For 5 people, it was only about $70. Others at the table got brisket (thumbs up) and someone got the fries, which came in a mini brown bag that soon became grease-soaked. They were regular-sized fries, just simple tossed in like salt and pepper, but still had the skin on. And they were fried to perfection. As we finished one by one, some guy came by and took away some of our trays for us. As we stood up to leave, my colleague who ordered the fries put it on his tray. I panicked. Me: "Are you going to throw those away??!" Him: "Well, yeah." Me: "Are you crazy? I'll take them to go and eat them in the car." So he handed me the bag, I took some napkins and wrapped the bottom, and took them with me. As we pulled away, I looked back and was so sad that this would be my only visit to Smoque during this trip to Chicago. As I sat in the back row of the Sienna, with my Coke in the cupholder, I finished off the bag of fries in about 5 minutes and was completely content. Until we meet again.

I'll keep this simple: 1) beef brisket so tender you can slice it with a plastic fork! 2) a large garden salad big enough to feed 3 of me! (yummy sun-dried tomatoes, cucumbers, iceburg, sunflower seeds, great vinagrette) 3) free refills on the medium iced tea 4) friendly service 5) nice vibe!

If you don't give Smoque 5 stars, you are ridiculous! Yes the line was out the door when we arrived at 8pm on Thursday, but I thought it moved rather quickly and they even have reading materials located at the door. The management has a great system set up to keep everything flowing. Once we got our food...heaven! The baby back ribs were meaty and the rub is absolutely to die for. They didn't even need any BBQ which I never say about ribs. I got the BBQ beans and mac and cheese for sides. None were disappointing. The baked beans were hearty and though I like a tad more heat, these were definitely a highlight of the meal. Bust into the mac and cheese early when it is hot for the best result. The crunchy topping was the perfect accompaniment. My honey's sliced brisket was good too, though he admitted my ribs were better. �) I will surely make my way back to Smoque and will probably get the ribs again. Boring, huh?

Best BBQ on the North Side. 蔖ulled pork and brisket sandwich are the best. 蔜he ribs could use some work. 蔍 went the first week they opened and I wasn't expecting so many people to be there. �The Mack and cheese is straight from Alton Brown! 蔈ven down to the Panko Breadcrumbs on top. The french fries are just like Little Louie's from way back in the day! I am so happy that I live within walking distance! 蔋ail to Smoque. 蔍 will be a frequent customer. 蔍 am bringing my in-laws there tonight!

Smoque is some of the best food for the best prices in all of Chicago. 蔠e have had everything on the menu at least once, and you honestly can't go wrong...but the fact that you don't even need a knife to slice the brisket makes it the best! 蔄lso, the sauce that comes with each meal will knock your socks off. 蔛eating is a little tight, but even during the busiest of times, the staff does a good job getting everyone who wants to dine in a seat before their food is ready. 蔅ut do be aware, that on certain nights/times, the line can be out the door and around the corner... Pros: - A place where you cannot order the wrong thing! - Wonderfully staffed with food coming out fast, tables cleaned quickly and a very upbeat environment. - The sauce is to die for, and you can take home a bottle for only $6. Cons: - Street parking can be chaotic. 蔆ertain days/times (all day Sunday) there is a connected, free lot.

Smoque makes some very solid BBQ. The meat is tender, ribs come of the bone easily, and everything is reasonably priced for quality BBQ. It doesn't hurt that it has very easy access to the express way.

You don't go to a place like Smoque for the ambiance; it's noisy, full of screaming kids, smells smoky (and so will you when you leave!) You go for the amazing food. My S.O. and I braved the nightmarish CTA from Lincoln Park in -20�windchill to sample some Smoque barbecue, and despite the fact that while waiting for the Diversey bus back home I thought my feet might fall off, it was totally worth it. We tried the baby back ribs, brisket, fries, and baked beans. He had their Mac and Cheese, too (I've got a dairy allergy, so none of that for me). Everything was awesome. The ribs had those pink smoke rings in them and the meat was super tender (I don't generally eat pork, but made an exception here), all the sides were delicious, and I liked that the coleslaw was vinegar-based rather than slathered with mayo. I wish the barbecue sauce was slightly spicier, but I just like things that burn my mouth! One of the owners chatted with us before we left to ask how everything was, so I feel like the people who run this place really care. If you're craving barbecue this is the place.

As I wait for that fateful day when my folks venture forth from those sylvan groves of the North Shore and cry, "Child, take us to Uncle John's (or Barbara Ann's)," Smoque does quite nicely, thank you very much. Once you get over the unbearable whiteness of being (a snazzy bbq in Old Irving Park while Honey I et al. struggle elsewhere), it's not hard to appreciate that Barry and Co. are the area's best emulators, which is saying something, given how many false promises of real 'cue this city has gotten before. Best news: this is not boiled meat jello. It's not Hill Country, but it's probably as close as we'll get it: the brisket is, as noted before, excellent; sauce comes on the side, thank cheesus; ribs are pink-y and have an excellent chew (I sound like Pat Bruno, sorry). Sides are not ignored, surprising for a BBQ joint; go for the beans. The operation is efficient, and the prices--even after the constant critical praise--are still lower than most of its Chicago-style BBQ competitors. And my folks like it. So there's that.

I used to love ribs, but I'm not a pork eater anymore (bad food poisoning experience- plus all the stuff you hear about parasites..). Anyway, I loved the beef brisket, I wanted to try the bbq chicken, but they were all out. I guess that happens a lot there- running out of things. The flavor was excellent. It tasted smokey to me (glad my taste buds aren't burned out). The meat was tender and juicy. I too loved the mac and cheese, had the flavor and feel of a good homemade comfort food. Didn't like the coleslaw, just because it wasn't creamy-but it did taste fresh. What I didn't like, was the size and design of the place. It was like a jammed in picnic area with a bunch of people you don't know. Also, I don't know if I missed it, or I was too focused on thinking about how the food would taste-what the price on the chalkboard said for the brisket and what the cashier (and flyer) told me were two different things. So I hold back one star, not for the taste of the food, but other little annoying things.I can't wait to get back there and try the cornbread, fries,cobbler...and maybe I can even get there before the chicken runs out. ---Update: tried the chicken, it was tender, juicy with a non-rubbery skin (the best part, for me). Unfortunatly, also noticed again, why would anyone want to eat the food inside there? I personally, don't like the experience of having impatient drooling people crowding my space and standing over me while I eat, but hey maybe that's just me...

So we ordered a buffet from here for my parent's anniversary... We had both ribs, pulled pork, brisket and texas sausage. 蔠e also had all the sides and cornbread. Everything was delicious as always.. brisket was extra yummy.. 蔍 did notice that the beans were a tad more watery/vinegary then usual and so was the coleslaw. They were both still very good but I think since they packed them in large tubs they lost some of there charm... Its a small place so be prepared to wait in line.. very much worth it

Some friends and I went to Smoque last nite for dinner. 蔅oy! 蔄m I glad we did! 蔍've been searching for a BBQ place ever since I moved back to Chi over a year ago. 蔔ow I've found it! Smoque served up some delicious briskets. 蔍 got the brisket platter (half chopped, half sliced), cornbread, and peach cobbler with a taste of Texas sausage. 蔕MG! 蔜he savory brisket melts in your mouth, especially the sliced brisket. 蔍 much prefer the sliced over the chopped brisket. 蔜he Texas Sausage was a little spicy and was perfectly grilled. 蔜he peach cobbler, oh peach cobbler... was fantastic! 蔛weet and sour and crunchy... 蔜he flavors and texture just blends together so well in your mouth. 蔜he cole slaw was good as well. 蔍 like that it's not a creamy slaw (although I like that too). 蔅ut it's good the way they make it here! The restaurant was packed and with a group of 7 people, I had no hope of getting a table. 蔅ut magically they got a table big enough for 7 of us! 蔜hat's cool! 蔜he guys who cleans and assign tables are cool! 蔉unny, courteous, and pleasant. 蔍t's kinda nice to feel welcomed at a busy place like that. The only complaint I had was that some of the patrons would just sit there yapping away with their friends long after they've finished eating and their plates taken away. 蔆ome on people! 蔋ave some courtesy for your fellow hungry diners, and get your full-asses out of the restaurant so that other people can sit down. 蔍t is ok to stand outside and talk. 蔍t won't kill you... 蔕h, I wish they'd convert the back parking lot into an outdoor patio. That would rock!!! I'll definitely be back for more brisket and cobbler at Smoque!!!

My first taste of barbecue/southern cuisine came when I was a young boy. We were driving through Alabama on our way to Mobile. 蔍t was late at night and the only thing open was a KFC. 蔄 mustached beacon in the humid southern night. �Fried chicken livers anyone?" �"Yes mom, whatever you say." Many years later, I made a habit of Lee's and Dee's in St. Paul. 蔛mall, unassuming, great ribs. 蔣ou can sit in silence off Selby Ave. and lick your fingers all you want. ��I would never lick my fingers at Smoque. 蔜here are too many watchful eyes, judging your every move. 蔜oo many people extolling the virtues of barbecue. 蔖eople upon people. 蔒illing about, eating barbecue, checking to make sure your dining experience is all you'd hoped. 蔄t times, awkwardly touching your hunched shoulders. �For me, this is a turnoff. 蔠hen faced with barbecued/smoked meat products, I need solitude. 蔍 need a place where I can give full attention to the task at hand. 蔔amely, cementing my status as a decorated member of the clean plate club. �Don't get me wrong, the food was great. 蔍t just seemed like there wasn't enough of it. 蔜he brisket was extremely tender. 蔍n the future I may just buy a pound or two of this, instead of doing the sandwich thing. 蔜he bread seems to overshadow the star of the show. I did however, like the pulled pork sandwich, piled high with fresh cole slaw, drizzled with their signature barbecue sauce (tangy and delicious). One thing that may keep me away from Smoque is the hype. 蔍 could almost smell Guy Fieri's hair gel as I crossed the threshold. 蔄nd as we all know, with hype comes congestion. 蔄nd I get really cranky when I'm forced to wait for food, a bi-product of my self-diagnosed, social-anxiety disorder. �I'll definitely come back for the ribs though. 蔖ast that, who knows. 蔍 would 蔭lmost prefer the nine hour bus ride to Lee's and Dee's.

Service: Good Atmosphere: Casual Food: Excellent Price: Reasonable I heard of this place on Diners, Drive in and Dives! on The Food Network. Cornbread was dry, Mac and Cheese-awesome!

Unfortunately, this isn't 5 stars......perhaps for folks that haven't been to Texas and tried their BBQ, but this does a "very" good job making some tasty meat, but it isn't perfect or the best..........so call me ridiculous. Arriving at probably the peak time to eat (8pm), there was 蔭 line from the counter out the door, but it did move at a nice clip. 蔔ow your first inclination is to ask, "why don't they have outdoor seating?" 蔠ell, I overheard another table say that the neighbors are against it, which is evident by the big signs on the side street indicating that parking along that street is for "RESIDENTS ONLY." 蔅ut there is plenty of parking on Pulaski, so don't sweat it. When we entered, we had plenty of time to read the big black chalk board showing all the options and items one can partake in this crazy busy place. 蔠e were asked by staff how many in the party and they looked for a table. 蔔ow this isn't community seating, but the tables are so close it might as well be. Our order was placed and I had the brisket....something I dearly miss from Texas and have struggled to find a place that does it as well as places like Salt Lick in Austin in the Mid-west. 蔍t was a brisket platter I ordered which comes with cole slaw and 2 sides. 蔒y sides were baked beans and fries. 蔅y the time we had our order taken and paid we had a table to sit in. 蔠e waited for between 10 and 15 minutes which wasn't that long, but felt longer with all the folks around us eating, plus the smell of the food cooking?!?!?! Our number was called, "45!!!!!!!!" 蔭nd it was time to eat. 蔜he brisket was tender to the point of falling apart when you tried to pick it up with a fork and the sauce was just the right mixture of spice and flavor. 蔜he baked beans had a nice little bite, though my GF didn't think it was enough. 蔜he cole slaw was mild and vinegar based and the fries......well they were just a big bag of fries....personally it was a filler and not spicy or jazzed up and I'd recommend you don't get them, but rather some other side dish, particularly the mac & cheese which is very good. I also had a taste of the ribs, which I thought were very good, even better than the brisket which the meat seem to lack flavor and I found myself dipping it into the sauce on just about every bite. All and all Smoque lives up to the hype, but not in the flavor department in my opinion - at least for the brisket I had that night. 蔍'm going back, but for the ribs next time!

I don't see what the big deal is about this place. 蔍t's a friendly neighborhoody BBQ restaurant, but they seem to have ramped up the hype machine to get themselves noticed everywhere from the Reader to The Hungry Hound. Food is very homemade-tasting, which is good, and prices are reasonable. 蔜he mac & cheese side and the coleslaw are both tasty, and feel like you could be eating them at a family reunion. I also had the brisket which was decent, but not mind-blowing. Smoque is good comfort food, but really - what's up with all the hype around it?

Yes, I saw all the awards they display on the wall but I have to be honest I wasn't blown out of the water.... no I wasn't even swayed by the endless promoting of their time on Diners, Drive-ins and Dive's 蕎ith Guy Ferrari, posters, pictures, books, really !! Now, how to compete with the other 837 reviews... hmmm how about 5 tips for the wise 1) GET THE PLATTER... platters come with 2oz more meat and 2 buns worth less of carbs. do it. In General portions are big, you sure get your money's worth, I got the chopped brisket platter, comes with over 2 cups of tender chopped brisket, slaw and two sides, which look small, but when its all together its enough to feed a small country. Mac and Cheese and baked beans were good. Addition: Even better the next day, as I am eating this cold at 8am. yummy !! 2) BYOB..... woooo. enough said. 3) 蔇ON'T EXPECT FIRST CLASS SERVICE... though everyone was friendly its very self serve here, order from the counter, no table service, communal table seating, metal trays as plates, and plastic silverware, though they some of the best bus boys in town. 4) DRIVE... if you don't have a car invite a friend who does, don't pass it by, it is not advertised well unless you know where it is, there is lots of free parking just North on Avondale and in front on Pulaski though its not the best neighborhood so leave your brand new Ferrari at home, my friend got the tire cover stolen off her jeep while we were eating... eeek. 5) 蔊ET THERE EARLY... got there at 6:30 on crisp fall night, we were pleasantly surprised that they were practically empty, though by the time we were finishing up a little after 7, the line grew and it was sooo busy ! I had wanted to try the cobbler but it is served warm so the only logical thing to do is order it after your done eating, but by that time I was not willing to wait in that line. Guess I will have to come back ! It also get very loud in here, when it was only about 1/4th the way full it was almost impossible to hear my friend, even sitting in the corner of the restaurant ! not cool ! Definitely worth a trip to Avondale to try it out when your craving some BBQ and nice and hungry !

I like this place. Good food and a pleasant atmosphere. This place does almost everything right. Carnivores will enjoy the variety of meats, side dishes to how you want your meal prepared. This place has "Hungry Pig" written all over it. But, the sticking point for me is the sauce. I'm just not into the sauce man. The sides are also pretty damn good, with cornbread being my favorite. This place does everything better than any barbecue place in the area but, again, it is the sauce that fails. It's good but not great.

You know when you are told to get there by 5 to get a seat and to make sure that they still have everything available that on the menu- that this is no ordinary BBQ joint. First the experience. This is not going to be a leisurely dining experience. More of a "get in, get food, get out" mentality. They have to move people through as the space is small, the crowds are large but they have a system that is pretty darn efficient even on a Saturday night. We ordered a little bit of everything . . .brisket, ribs, Texas sausage and all the sides. I loved that the meat was rubbed and smoked and that the vinegary BBQ sauce is served on the side- to slather on or not- your choice. The portion sizes for the meat are large but the sides seemed a bit skimpy to me. The foil ramekins that the mac and cheese came in were small but I guess that's so the star is the meat, The peach cobbler for dessert- also good but call me crazy but I'm a girl that likes my food served on dishes. I get the simple approach- I just don't like to eat off of foil, paper lined trays and Styrofoam bowls. Dinner for two with a ton of food leftover ran about $37 (enough meat left over for at least another meal) Get there early. Bring your appetite and don't dawdle over your food. Cuz that person who is standing there waiting for your seat just might be me!

UPDATE: Are we seriously judging this place on the dining environment, the lighting, and the color of the walls? 蔊ood grief. 蔍T IS A BBQ PLACE without table service... what do you expect? 蔔ot that I care in ANY way, but for a BBQ place, it looks pretty damn good: clean walls, clean tables, clean floors, clean kitchen upon which anyone can look, and clean restrooms. 蔄nd because people seem to care, I think the walls are a non-harsh red with a slight brownish hue and I do not find the lighting to be harsh and I did not need a blanket wrapped around me while I sat near the door in January (in case wall-color and fluorescent lights matter to you when you buy a ton of meat at a BYOB cop haven in Avondale). 蔎udge cheap take-out places on food, not on friggin ambiance or your normative perception of a lack thereof.... ugh. Original review: Outstanding. 蔄bsolutely delectable. 蔍 have never tasted better pulled pork in my life. �I would go WAY out of my way for this place... luckily I live about 6 blocks away. �Without a doubt one of the biggest gems in Avondale or Irving Park. During the 15 minutes I waited for my takeout order to finish, No less than 3 CPD cruisers pulled up entirely separate of each other, EACH cop picking up separate orders (for at least 6 people). 蔜he cops didn't even know each other... If this place is good for 3x6=18 cops on a late Saturday afternoon, you know it's something special. 蔄nd there were about 20-25 other diners there at the time, so it's not by any stretch just a CPD haven. �Destined to become one of my favorites in the city. 蔆an't wait to try the ribs... OUTSTANDING, OUTSTANDING, OUTSTANDING.

It's been a while since I've written, I may be a bit rusty, but here we go. 蔐ast night husband and I tried Smoque. 蔠e'd heard so much raving about it, that we were dying to try it. 蔜rue to what we'd been told there was a line from hell. 蔋owever I had called ahead at noon to order dinner at 7. 蔕nce we got into the door enough for me to see an employee I asked where to go's orders get their goods. 蔋e pointed me straight to the front and I was relieved. 蔜he place smells of, well...smoke. 蔠hat did I expect. We ordered a slab of ribs and a pulled pork sandwich with fries, slaw, cornbread and peach cobler. 蔛eemed like enough to put us in a food coma. We grabbed the goods and headed home dying to rip into the bag. 蔖ortions were generous. 蔜hey were smart and put the sauce on the side so everything wasn't a gooey mess. 蔠e doctored everything up and got to eating. 蔜his is our impression. The ribs fell off the bone they were so tender. 蔊ood sign. 蔋owever the smoke flavor was so incredibly overpowering we couldn't taste the meat at all. 蔍t was like eating smoke. As for my pulled pork. 蔍t was tender as can be. 蔜hank god it didn't taste as smokey as the ribs. 蔜he sandwich was huge, I couldn't finish. 蔉ries were fresh cut tater style and plenty of them. 蔛law was good, not to much mayo (maybe there wasn't any at all) but unfortunately they were peppered with raw red onions that don't sit well in my stomach so I couldn't enjoy them. 蔒y husband slurped them up. Cornbread, if I'm honest...we took one bite each and threw it away. 蔍t was terrible. 蔛orry :( We saved the cobler, maybe we'll have it this morning with breakfast. �The place is a dive, you'd drive by and miss it unless your windows were down and you smelled the smoke. 蔍t was packed, so you know people are coming back. 蔠e might try it again and order the chicken. 蔅ut in my humble opinion, while I enjoy a good smokey flavor to my BBQ, I also want to taste the food. 蔙ibs were a fail on that account. 蔅ut I enjoyed the hell out of my pork sandwich so, it's like it evens out.

I am going to give you explicit instructions on how to enjoy this place- 1) Order for pick up, they have a menu online for easy ordering. 蔜his place is a madhouse and the crowd is mostly families with loud and dirty kids. �no offense to people who have said "loud and dirty kids") 2) DO order the brisket. 蔍 though this was the best thing we had from here. 蔒ake sure you get 2 kinds of BBQ sauce not just the kind that comes with the brisket. 蔜he two kinds of sauces are very different and you will appreciate each in their own way while enjoying this savory creation over your coffee table; in the comfort of your own home. 3) If you must get ribs from this place my boyfriend (rib connoisseur) prefers the St. Louis style to the baby backs. Although the recommendation from the professional is that the rib sampler at Smoke Daddy is superior. I have also sampled the pulled pork and near all the sides. 蔔one of these impressed me. 蔜here are so many good places to get BBQ in the city and I am trying than one by one. 蔜his place gets 4 stars for the brisket alone. 蔜his is something you must try Smoque style!!!

***Read my Disclaimer below this review*** Smoque should be fired for having sub par BBQ. I ordered take out for me and my roommate last night. The following is a synopsis of what we ordered and what went horribly wrong. Roomie's Order: Brisket Platter - Not much flavor. Not much meat (won't feed a big burly man). Plus side is that it was tender. BBQ sauce on the side - VINEGARY or something. It smelled bad and tasted bitter. Blah. Fries - Best part of the meal. Still weren't that great, though. Mac n Cheese - Small muffin cup sized portion. Tasted a bit eggy. Coleslaw - VINEGARY again. WTF is it with the Heinz up in here? Ick. My Order: Pulled Pork Sandwich - I would have thought this was chicken. No flavor beyond the bread. Put my own Baby Ray's BBQ sauce but could not salvage the sammich. Fries - see above. Coleslaw - see above. This does NOT compare to Fat Willy's. Fat Willy's has great sauces and their coleslaw is distinctive (I love the cilantro in it). Also, FW has steak fries, which kick Smoque's ash. I will also say that neither FW nor Smoque compares to Famous Dave's, which can be found in/near North Riverside. I will not be eating at Smoque again. It was disappointing. I wasn't expecting Carson's Ribs but hey... it's a bit pricey for getting bland food. DISCLAIMER: Portage Park restaurants get 4 and 5 stars all the time like they are government cheese. I believe this is due to the niceness of the residents of this area. The sad truth is that Portage Park has very few dining options that will make you salivate. Do not believe all the superb ratings. I would go by the worst review of any given place. I am all for dives, chains, and fancy places. It all depends on your mood. But one thing I look for is good quality for a decent price.

Ambiance: 蔖retty low key. 蔔ot your typical restaurant, but more like Portillo's where you pay for your food ahead of the time. Simple decorations but I got the impression that people came in there to EAT and not for their ambiance. THE GOOD: let's see, their RIBS were DELISH! - Both St. Louis and baby back style!! Their Mac N Cheese was pretty tasty, but came in a small individually backed foil container. 蔉ries was typical, but... IT'S BYOB!!! That's always good on my book. The sauce was great! They have their own version of a bbq sauce which had a sweet and tangy taste. �THE BAD: 蔍 wished they served more of Mac N Cheese. 蔉or the little container that they had, they were charging $3. 蔍 also wished they had more variety of sauces instead of one. The Service: 蔕K. 蔛ome guys walked around to make sure everything is OK. 蔜hey have a Fountain drink so you'll have to do your own refills. BOTTOM LINE: 蔍F you're looking for a really good bbq ribs, this is pretty good! 蔣ou get in, you pay ahead, eat, drink, and be on your way! 蔜heir ribs was very tender and their own bbq sauce was prettty tasty too. 蔄nd it was pretty reasonably priced.

4.5 stars. Prior to eating at Smoque, I simply believed that one could not get great BBQ on the North Side of Chicago. Now there are a whole slew of bbq joints, but Smoque takes the cake. Pulled Pork: perfect mix of crisp, chewy bark and tender meat. Brisket: fuckable. The brisket is fuckable. Mac n' cheese: Crisp top, gooey inside, strong cheese, not overcooked pasta. Awesome. Slaw: God I love that there is a place in Chicago that doesn't ruin its slaw with the world's worst condiment. Also, it's healthy! (not that anything else here is, but you don't go to Smoque to please your Weight Watchers guru). BBQ beans: So. damn. tasty. Bits of brisket in the beans, enough onions and spices to offset the delicious sweetness. Did I mention that there is chopped brisket in the beans? Brisket chili: A special that I've had the last two times here- hopefully it will become a permanent menu fixture. Personally I prefer pinto beans to the large kidney beans that populate this chili, but the brisket is so good you kind of forget that you are eating chili and not just foraging for meat gold. Fries: The reason I give this place a 4.5 and not 5. Okay, they're pretty good fries, but if you're gonna go to the trouble of eating one of the most unhealthy things on the planet, why not season it up a bit? I like that there are places popping like Edzo's Burger Shack that doll up the fries. But maybe it's just that I don't really see the point in plain fries... Sauces: The house BBQ sauce is thin, sweet and vinegary: It's not a North Carolina style sauce, but more similar to that then what you'll find in a bottle of Baby Ray's. -The other sauce (is it called Memphis?) is what I usually go for. This is what uppity food connoisseurs hate, and what most midwesterners love: A sauce that is thick, sweet, and full of deep, peppery flavors. People say that this stuff masks the BBQ, but I would beg to differ: Is it not possible that creating the perfect BBQ sauce to complement your meat is just as high an art as creating a good piece of BBQ-ed meat? All I know is that when I lather my brisket in this stuff, I taste both the meat and the sauce, and it is a match made in heaven. Line: I've never had to wait more than 20 minutes and usually go at prime dinner hours. Dining area: It is what it is- this is a BBQ joint, you pay BBQ prices, picnic tables are okay by me. And the BYOB is nice.

If I ever dine out at a restaurant that has macaroni and cheese on its menu - in any form - I will order it. 蔍t is my all time favorite food, and I am on a constant quest to find the good stuff!!. 蔕ther than my fiance's delicious homemade version that he has been perfecting since we first met, Smoque is the real deal. 蔕MG, it's so good. 蔜he perfect amount of cheesiness and creaminess, topped with the tiniest, crisp breadcrumbs that just melt in your mouth. �Oh yeah, and they have great barbeque too. :) The brisket is to die for - juicy and tender and dripping in sauce! 蔠hen my co-worker told me she was going to get takeout from Smoque for her birthday, I started salivating at my desk. 蔄nd this place is a trek for me. 蔍t means walking and taking two different bus lines just to sit down at their tables and nosh. 蔅ut believe me, it's all worth it.

This has got be my favorite bbq joint in the city right now. 蔍've been here three times already, yet with each time I leave wanting to come back even more! 蔛moque's had an incredible amount of publicity since they opened. 蔍t's been on Metromix, Check Please, and even Diners, Drive-Ins, and Dives on the Food Network!! �Everything about this place screams bbq, from the shack-line appearance on the outside to the small, cozy interior w/ a heavenly aroma of smoke and goodness in the air. As if the anticipation wasn't great enough, Smoque happens to be BYOB, how cool!!! 蔒y friends and I waited in line, case in hand, ready to devour. 蔠e ordered a slab of the baby back ribs, half slab of st. louis style ribs, taster portion of the chopped brisket, corn bread, and chose our sides of baked beans, mac and cheese, and fries. �I can't even begin to describe how good the food is here. 蔜he ribs were so tender, especially the St. Louis style, which were incredibly meaty and smokey. 蔇on't forget to add their homemade sauce, it's fantastic! 蔜he brisket was insanely tender and flavorful as well. 蔍've never had better baked beans than here, they have an incredible meatiness that makes them taste so damn good. 蔜he mac and cheese is baked w/ some parmesan on top, adding a nice crunchy texture. 蔜he cornbread actually had bits of corn in it, how awesome!! �My mouth is watering even as I write this. 蔆ome during the week to avoid the crazy lines on the weekend. 蔄nd don't forget to show up early because they tend to run out of the good stuff if you come late!! You might leave w/ bbq sauce all over your face, but you'll undoubtedly be be smiling all the way home after eating here!!

So I ate at Smoque for the first time on Saturday afternoon...... This is the BEST BBQ in the city! I can't get over how AWESOME it is! I recommend getting a platter, with that you get your choice of meat, Cole slaw, and choice of two sides! My boyfriend and I each got a platter: Mine- Pulled Pork- moist, huge portion, great flavor Slaw- soooooooo good, not mayo based, light and awesome! Mac and Cheese- perfect portion, cheesy goodness and Peach cobbler- I wasn't a fan, I ate the rest 2 days later drunk, and liked it. His- Chopped Brisket- again moist, huge portions, and not overly fatty, there was a smoked awesome favor Slaw BBQ Beans- They were OK, nothing to write home about.... Fries- fresh cut and seasoned well. and a side of St. Louis style ribs-- meaty no fat and full of flavor. We split everything and loved it all! The meat is plentiful, and not fatty at all. You don't need sauce, I prefer the meat with out it!

They should change the name of this place to Smoqueue. Get it? "queue" - as in a line of people waiting? I kill me. Seriously, all you meatheads need to stop raving about this place. You're making it impossible for the rest of us to get in. At least until the owners wise up and move to a larger location with more reasonable parking rules. But if you do go, make sure it's on a night I'm not going, and get carryout. The dining room has all the ambience of a prison cafeteria.

I've been here twice, both times have been of equal quality. The dining room is pretty small and the line is long, but most people don't linger too long after eating and the host staff is awesome about arranging tables for a big party. 蔈ven though you order before being seated, the host staff coordinates with the kitchen so that your food isn't done before a seat has been found for you. 蔅oth times I've come, we've had a big party of around 8 people and getting seated hasn't been a horrible experience. I'm a huge fan of pulled pork, so that's the only thing I've ordered both times. 蔍 find the sauce TO DIE FOR. 蔄fter living in North Carolina, I've really become a fan of vinegar based bbq sauces, and Smoque's sauce definitely has that "tang" to it. 蔍 could bathe in the stuff. 蔉riends have ordered everything else on the menu and I've tried bites of it. 蔍 like them all, but will always stick with pulled pork. I would have given this place 5 stars, but I'm taking a star away for the horrible excuse that is their coleslaw. 蔍 know that everyone may do their slaw a bit different, but really there is no reason to deviate from the creamy goodness of traditional coleslaw. 蔜hese guys do and it's not a good deviation. �Can't wait to go back for more!

We went here for a Friday lunch since it's only 3 miles from where I work. I've seen other people's reviews and had a very favorable impression going in here. When we arrived, an older, unshaven guy in an orange vest told us where not to park or risk towing. I'm not sure if he was a city worker, valet, or The Parking Nazi. Once we parked legally nearby, we came inside the little corner joint. Inside, the restaurant is very plain in its decor. The menu appears on a chalkboard and is easy to figure out. 蔠hat you need to know when ordering is that the brisket is either sliced or pulled. I chose sliced since I feared a mouthful of meat imbedded between my teeth. While everyone else in my group of 4 ordered brisket sandwiches, I went with the brisket plate & 2 sides. The brisket is awesome, tender, and charred crisp on the edges the way I love it, for that rich BBQ taste. Definitely a great meal! Following other Yelpers' advice, I avoided ordering the coleslaw, though the guys with me liked it. I may try it next time. I have to say, the sweet and smoky-tasting baked beans are awesome. Likewise, same goes for the fresh-cut, skin-on potato fries that are the best on this side of Gene & Jude's. The corn bread was decent but not mind-blowing. Free drink refills are a plus. Service is pretty quick for sandwich orders, but I found myself waiting the longest, since the brisket platter orders seem to take the longest to prepare. Still, the orders keep coming and the crew looks very efficient. I would definitely recommend this place to others.

*Finally* made it to Smoque, long overdue and man I've been missing out. 蔉or me, bbq is all about the pulled pork and theirs is something to behold....tender, nice smoky flavor and oh so delicious. Topped off with their zesty bbq sauce, this is how bbq is done, my friend. The place itself is fairly small, about 15 tables total. 蔍 went at 11:30a thinking i'd beat the lunch rush and there was a line about 5 deep...no worries right? 蔠ell, not really. 蔄pparently some jack-arse ahead of me ordered, and i kid you not, no less than 20 different things; he walked out with five gianormous bags of food...totally cluster-f'd everything up. 蔍 ended up getting my order at just after Noon and by this time the queue was at least 20 deep with patrons quite visibly annoyed. oh well, such is life....now, let's talk food: again, pulled pork was tender, juicy and succulent with a nice char on a few of the pieces, easily a 5/5. 蔐ove their sauce which was reminiscent of what Smoke Daddy's *used* to be (sadly, they've changed for the worse), semi sweet w. a nice kick to it. ��I went with the 2-sides platter and chose fries and baked beans. 蔜o me, sides play a pretty big role at a bbq joint and they delivered another 5/5..out.stan.ding! 蔉ries were hot and fresh, crispy on the outside steak type fries but not all "potato-y" like some steak fries tend to be, very flavorful! �Baked beans were as good as they get, nice hickory flavor, bits of bacon and pork included and a hint of sweetness via brown sugar and other seasoning, incredible. 蔆ole slaw (included in all platters) was probably some of the freshest i've encountered, light dressing (not mayo based) which I can only compare to my Mom's homemade Poppyseed dressing...again 5/5! �Food 5/5 !!! Look, feel of the restaurant and overall experience (parking is a total hassle and ironically it's similar to Fat Willy's...chicago bbq joints, sort it out already!) 3/5.

Being featured on the Food Network definitely does not hurt business. 蔈specially when the episode of Diners, Drive ins & Dives has aired twice already (by the way I am convinced the host of that show Guy Fieri--is going to die of a heart attack--sheesh!). �Went there after seeing the show & cannot say I was disappointed. 蔜he food is absolutely tasty, the portions are very generous & the prices are decent for BBQ. 蔋ave tried the brisket, baby back ribs, St. Louis Ribs, and the pulled pork--all of it is great. 蔄lthough I have come to the conclusion that I prefer baby back ribs to the St. Louis kind. 蔄ll meals come with sides & corn bread (YUM!). 蔜he sides are delicious from the mac n cheese to the fries. 蔍f you are watching what you eat--you may want to consider eating somewhere else--this is not light by any means. You may want to consider taking the food to go as the place gets uber crowded & it rather small on the inside. 蔄lso, try & get there early or else you will be standing in one long line. 蔜his joint is pretty casual & the seating is not the best--it is like a cafeteria with long tables where you can sit right on top of people. 蔍f you don't mind that, I say check them out--you probably wont be sorry.

Wha happened? Why was the brisket so bad this time? Okay, it wasn't bad, but it wasn't the smokey pink goodness that I had on my last visit. It was dry. 蔠hat the hell. This really hurts me, Smoque.

The best BBQ brisket is the best I've ever tried. It was easily my favorite dish, and the entire menu was good. Here are my two gripes: They need to make it easier for a group to buy a sampler platter of all the meats. "The Feast" at Famous Dave's may be a sales gimmick, but it's the best way to serve a table of people BBQ that I've seen. They need a $60 platter of meat at Smoque. The seating in the dining room is stupid. We were told to sit down and try some fries while we waited for some friends, then asked to get up so another party could sit, then we were given another table. It was confusing and annoying. The next time we were in the mood for brisket, we just got it to go.

By the looks of it, Smoque doesn't really need another 5 star review but I'm going to give them one anyway because they deserve it. I should begin by saying that I've only been to Smoque during very off-peak hours, so I've never had to deal with the ridiculous line, however I like it there so much that I'd gladly wait for a taste of that barbecue. 蔛pecifically, the Jew in me loves the beef brisket and the St. Louisan in me loves the pulled pork: slather both of them in sauce and I'm a happy gal. 蔜he mac & cheese deserves a special shout-out because it is SINFUL: its perfectly creamy, but it has a good breadcrumb crunch on top. 蔄nd the peach cobbler is a great way to end the meal: I could eat it for breakfast the morning after! �Smoque, you might not see me for a little while because I've been a fat bastard lately; its a new year so I plan on abstaining from red meat and artery-clogging fare in general. 蔅ut I'll be back once I fall off that band-wagon (and you KNOW I will).

Just visited Smoque for the first time with some dear friends who are in town and I must say----pretty AMAZING. 蔍 love BBQ, but my experiences with really authentic tastes have been limited to Memphis (the rest of my experiences come from places like TGI Fridays...gulp) and that's it. 蔛o it was great to try something new! I had a half slab of babyback ribs (plenty!), the mac & cheese, and the brisket chili. 蔜he barbeque sauce is ON POINT with the ribs--I had to keep dipping them into the side cup because it was just soooo good. 蔜he macaroni was also phenomenal---crusty on the top, gooey on the inside, and VERRRRRRY cheesy. 蔍 didn't like the brisket chili, however...it was a gametime decision and was actually a little odd tasting. 蔍 did, however, steal some of my hubb's fries and they were off the chains good. Be prepared for a no-frills, no-nonsense interior that is PACKED with people. 蔣ou order your food first then they find you a seat. 蔠e did have to wait in line a fairly long time, but it was worth it. 蔇elicious stuff, y'all!

Food earns the 3-stars. Pulled-pork was great, mac and cheese was cheesy, fries were too greasy, slaw was crunchy - the way I like it. BUT it turns out this "kind" of bbq isn't my fave. It didn't wow me. Ambience gets a big fat zero. I don't mean to be ass, I know this place isn't TRYING to be known for its atmosphere, but, well ... the lighting was very harsh, too bright. Concrete floors and walls (easy to clean?). Surprisingly it wasn't loud, despite all the people. Fast, efficent and good. I'll go back but this isn't my #1 choice for barbeque.

If you are going to Smoque at dinner time, be prepared to wait. The line snakes out the door and the seating is in short supply during rush. Bring along a sixer (this place is BYOB) and hunker down for a wait if your order does not include brisket. Fries here are great - as good as any I've had in Chicago. I'm a non-four legged animal eater, so it was chicken all-around. The dark meat was moist, and the breast was, as expected, a bit dry. The smoke flavor was mild, the skin was golden. Beans were good - again, good smoke flavor, good sauce, delicious. The slaw was nothing special, although thankfully mayo-free. I'd go back...but not too soon.

A group of friends and I (yes, with "Tom T") went to try Smoque last night. 蔍 wasn't quite sure what to expect...good BBQ is one of the few things I miss about living in Texas. I ordered the 1/2 brisket (sliced) 1/2 pulled pork sandwich and a side of mac and cheese. 蔜he meat is a little hard to describe...it was soooooo tender and yet not mushy. 蔛uper tasty! 蔜he mac and cheese was so good also...I'm glad the portion was modest, as I probably could have eaten a gallon tub of it, no kidding. 蔜he few bites of coleslaw I had I liked, also...very crunchy and not too wet. When I first got there, the line was such that I didn't think we would be able to sit down, but somehow a spot to seat all 7 of us appeared; throughout the meal, I noticed nobody was standing waiting to sit down with their food. 蔍 don't know how they do that. 蔍f only Kuma's was the same way. �) Anyway...I loved this place. 蔍t's just my style...great food without being fancy.

Much like the strip club, you will drive home from this place smelling your fingers. 蔜op notch. 蔜op notch.

I love me some Smoque. Nom nom nom... I will admit I am not a huge BBQ snob, but this is pretty darn good food. The brisket, ribs, pork, and chicken are all super yummy, and the baked beans and mac and cheese are great sides. The cole slaw is vinegar-based, as opposed to mayo-based, and I know that's not everyone's cup of tea, but I like it. The peach cobbler is a nice finale. Only drawbacks - it's small, gets crowded, you may have to sit next to people you'd rather not, and I'm gathering the neighborhood folk aren't too pleased with Smoque patrons parking on their street (note the NO SMOQUE PARKING signs). 蔅ut I can't seem to stay away for too long....

Being that I am from Memphis I truly don't make it a habit to try BBQ from other places. 蔍 branched out and walked to Smoque's with a friend. 蔜his place is about 4 blocks away so that is very convenient. 蔄s we approach the restaurant I see a line of people to get into the door. 蔔ow anyone who knows me knows that I am totally against standing in line. 蔍f I had been alone I would have continued to walk until I found another place. 蔍 did suck it up and 45 minutes later I was inside preparing to order. �For this reason I will probably never eat inside of this place again but now on to the food. The BBQ was good. 蔍 can't say that it was the best I have ever had but it is definitely worth returning for carry out. 蔛o I give this spot 3 stars because it's Chicago and there was actually a good BBQ joint. 蔍 took one star away because it really should never take 45 minutes to get inside of a place to eat.

Score another victory for the Food Network's #1 show Diners, Drive-ins and Dives. I love barbecue and Smoque does it right. We were in town for the USC/Notre Dame game and decided to break our tradition of having pizza on the first night so we could try this legendary restaurant. And it was a little bit of a tough sell because from our hotel in downtown it looked like it was half way to O'Hare. But after the first few bites the consensus was that it was worth the $20 cab ride. I went with the baby back ribs and they were the best I have ever had. I liked that they were served with the sauce on the side so you could appreciate the rub that not only flavored the meat but caramelized slightly to give the ribs a great texture. The girlfriend, J, is a brisket fan and she declared the brisket at Smoque the best she's ever had. So why 4-stars and not 5? Well for me the barbecue experience has to have great sides. The sides at Smoque are great. We had a combination of mac & cheese, beans, coleslaw and cornbread. But --and this is really nitpicky-- I didn't think the sides were as good as the sides at Baby Blues BBQ in Venice, CA, another Triple D hot spot. But if you haven't had Baby Blues then you don't know what you are missing. BTW, the peach cobbler is the best peach cobbler I have ever had and if you are a fan of almonds you will love this dessert. It's like fresh peach cobbler and a bear claw had a one night stand and this is their shameful but delicious offspring. Do not pass it up.

Having lived in Austin, Texas, and experienced the BBQ of the Hill Country, I feel it is hard to find good BBQ. I think Smoque does a pretty decent job of bringing good BBQ to Chicago - in my opinion, a town that sorely needs decent BBQ. The food is always fresh and inexpensive. Over four of five trips, I have tried both styles of ribs, the brisket, and the pulled pork. I think the brisket still needs work. It lacks the deep smoke ring you see at places like Ruby's or Smokey Moe's or the Salt Lick in the Austin area. It is also a little dry. The pit masters of the Hill Country seem to be able to smoke brisket for 24 hours and have it emerge with a perfect consistency of smoke, moisture, and texture. I think if Smoque continues to work on their technique, they will eventually start getting better quality brisket. The other thing I wonder is where they're getting their brisket from? The meat is good quality but it doesn't seem to be the highest quality you might find in the BBQ meccas. Lastly, I think they add a little too much brine to the brisket, therefore detracting from the smoke. What the brisket might lack, I think the pulled pork makes up for. I really love the pulled pork here and think it is their most consistent and well-done dish. The pork is succulent and moist, with just the right amount of crust. The sauce at Smoque is excellent with the pork, with the vinegar base serving as a perfect contrast for the sweetness of the pork. The large white rolls they serve their sandwiches on are perfect for soaking up a good amounts of BBQ sauce. I've tried both styles of ribs and am leaning towards the dry rub Memphis-style ribs. Just like the brisket, I still think they need a little more smoke. But, they go extremely well with the sweet sauce they serve them with. If you go, you have to try to mac n' cheese as a side, it is delicious, with a hard crust of cheese on top that opens up to a hot, creamy interior. The beans and fries are pretty good and the slaw could use a little work. All in all, I think they do a good job and will likely get better with time. A legendary pit master in Omaha, Jerry, one of the owner's of Fojay's Pit Bar-B-Que, once told me that most smokers don't develop character until you've used them for a few years. I know I'll keep on checking out Smoque, because it is by far the best I've had in Chicago. Parking at Smoque can be a challenge and it is often crowded, but we've never had to wait for more than a few minutes for a table. The decor is basic, but I'd be worried if it were anything more for a place serving BBQ. The staff is friendly, and one of the owners is often walking through the restaurant inquiring about what people think about the food - a good sign as I think they genuinely want to make their BBQ better each day.

This place is soo damn good!! Best of all its cheap AND its BYOB too! What more can you ask for. Peak hours have a very long line but it seems to move rather quickly. The food is cheap for the portions. For $10 I got pulled pork, a small side of the best mac & cheese everrrr, and fries! Just an FYI, they turn over tables quick, so this isn't a place to eat and linger. Eat. Drink your beers. Leave. Go, go, go!

Jeff L and I stopped by smokey the other day to get some takeout. It was CRAZY busy. Good thing we got in when we did because the line quickly went out of the door and there was no where to sit for anyone. We eventually got our order. The manager (I assume) was very nice and thanked us for moving to another table so a boy could sit with his parents. When we got home we ripped open the food. Everything smelled really good. The brisket was orgasmic! They didn't give you enough it was so so good. I've never had better! The Saint Louis ribs were great too. The meat came off the bones. The baby back ribs were terrible, I couldn't even eat them. They weren't cooked enough so instead of the meat falling off the bone it was more like eating a overcooked breakfast steak and a diner! boo! After all was said and done we got a ton of food for $60! It was pretty good. I'll go back but I won't order the baby back ribs again! Update: Went back and got gross tough ribs that were inedible =( Come ON BBQ places!!! Cook your food.

I can see why folks who live in Irving/Portage Park might give Smoque 4 or 5 stars, it's a nice place in an area which doesn't have a whole lot going on in terms of interesting or exciting eats. 蔜he spartan decor of the dining room does not bother me (though so far all my visits have been take-out). Their menu is pretty simple as BBQ places go, here's my evaulation of what I've sampled so far: St. Louis Ribs & Pulled Pork - pretty good Baby Back ribs & Brisket - so-so Side items - very modest portions, but the mac & cheese and beans are great I also like that they put the sauces on the side, sometimes I prefer that my meat not be swimming in BBQ sauce. One thing that has recently annoyed me about Smoque is apparent issues with "running out" of food later on weekend evenings. 蔕ne Sunday I called in for carryout, the person on the phone advised that they were out of brisket & pulled pork - no big deal, since I really wanted ribs, but they sounded like they would have preferred that I give up and order some other day. 蔕n a more recent Saturday, I tried three times to call in an order about an hour or so before their closing time, but no one was picking up the phone. 蔜he money I was going to spend at Smoque that night ended up going to Smokin' Woody's. Maybe this is just a new business "growing pains" thing that will eventually be resolved? �In summary, I'd go back to Smoque if I was in the area, but probably would not go too far out of my way to visit again.

Really good brisket sandwich. The meat was extremely tender and the BBQ sauce they use, though thin for my tastes, was really tasty. The brisket chilli, though also thin, was flavorful with nice big chunks of meat. Prices are reasonable as well.

As I was walking home Wednesday morning hammered (cubs game, plus lots of post game drinking). I decided that I was probably going to be hung over when I woke up. 蔖erfect hangover food is bbq. 蔉ood from this place is as perfect as it gets when you have a hangover. �Writing this review is making my eyes mist up. 蔍 miss this place already. I ordered the brisket platter, which came with two sides. 蔜he brisket is perfectly cooked with a little bit of charring. 蔍t was melt in my mouth good. 蔜he portion was huge and I though I would have left over, but nope all gone. 蔒y first side was Mac n Cheese. 蔄ll I'm going to say is this is the BEST Mac n Cheese this man has ever had. 蔍 would marry this stuff if it would have me. 蔜he baked beans didn't stand a chance against the cheesy goodness. 蔜he Mac was crusted on the top and once you broke through the top it was pure cheese bliss. 蔍 bought a large to take home with me it's that good. �The beans had little bits of brisket in them and were tasty. ��The price was perfect 12 bucks for all that food, coleslaw and a drink. 蔜he place was very clean and the staff was very friendly. 蔍 will say it gets crowded in there, but believe me the line could be down the block, in the blistering heat and I would wait like a little puppy ready to stuff my face.

My belly was so full that I was literally holding it out the door... After Yelp Summerfest, I convinced Denton J. to head over to Smoque. 蔛ure, we had already feasted on all sorts of deliciousness, but I couldn't pass up the opportunity since we are never in Portage Park. As we pull in the parking lot, a Range Rover tried to literally beat us through the front door. 蔠ith only 10 minutes to spare, they wanted some BBQ and were willing to fight me over it. Um, I don't think so. Anyway, we got to the door, smelled the deliciousness, and all of us were served. 蔐uckily. 蔕therwise, I'd have to fight them south side style. But enough about the drama: let's talk about the food. 蔕h my, is it sooo mouthwatering good. 蔇enton J. ordered a full slab of ribs and I ordered the pulled pork. 蔍t was so good that we just kept on eating, ignoring the fact that we were on our fourth meal of the day. 蔉inally, we called mercy and packed the leftovers to go. And then we got home and realized, ribs and pulled pork won't taste nearly as good the next day. 蔛o we finished the order, like two fatties, at the breakfast bar. I didn't eat until 3PM the next day.

This place is always busy! And no wonder, it is worth wating in line for this place. The first time I was there, instead of going for the usual ribs, I decided to sample their brisket. Huge fan of brisket. The first time I had it 蔍 had the sliced brisket sandwich. It tasted so delicious! Loved the BBQ sauce on the side with it. The next time I went I had the chopped brisket. Just as good as the sliced. This place is definitely worth the wait in line. It's pretty small, but was able to find a place to sit the times that I was there. �Definitely will be back for more!

Best barbecue in Chicago. Period. "But, what about ...." No! BEST. BARBECUE. IN. CHICAGO. In fact, after Arthur Bryant's and Rendevous, this is the best I've ever had. Went with my parents a couple of weekends ago. I got a half slab of Baby Backs and a half slab of St. Louis Styles. Both were phenomenal. The meat has fantastic flavor without any sauce because of the rub, and with the sauce, it was even better. �I prefer baby back because the meat is much more tender and falls off the bone, but St. Louis style was very good as well -- just had to put a little more effort into it. Sauce was more peppery than vinegary -- very full of flavor with a little kick. If you ONLY like sweet sauce, you might not like it. But if you're open to your sauce opportunities, you'll be very happy. The mac and cheese was tremendous. I loved the fact that there were bread crumbs on it -- made it that much more flavorful and added another texture element that makes you ask, "Why didn't I do this with my Easy Mac?" My mom got the brisket, which was awesome. Not overly tough or chewy like most brisket I've ever had, and it's very flavorful with a nice charred crust. Pricewise, it's not too expensive, about what you would expect to pay for a full rack of ribs (I think the ribs are about $17 a la carte, $21 for ribs with two sides). I still like Famous Dave's and Carson's, but if the choice is between these three, Smoque is where you need to be.

So finally I've managed to eat... well not at Smoque proper because there's no place on this planet I'd stand in line outdoors for. 蔅ut I phoned them on New Year's Eve and asked a lot of questions, and the gal I spoke to was unfailingly nice to me in spite of probably being ferociously busy. In the end I ordered two pounds of the pork, two of the brisket, two sausages (I thought I'd ordered three, but I could be mistaken) a quart of the beans, six cornbread and two slabs of ribs, one of each kind. 蔍t was a little pricier than I expected it to be, but all things considered it made a damn good meal for me and my guests and it was ready when it was supposed to be, and packed very well. �As for the specifics, I'd have to say that anything I found not to my taste was probably pretty much a matter of personal preference. 蔉or example, I don't like fatty beef and the brisket was kind of fatty. 蔊ood flavor, but fatty. 蔕TOH, the pork was lean and delicious. 蔜he ribs were very good, though neither were the fall-off-the-bone sort which I prefer. 蔜he dry rubs were excellent, but the sauce had a lot of cumin in it and I just barely tolerate cumin. The sausages were very good and I'm not a sausage person, and the beans were extraordinary. 蔄lso, very good cornbread. 蔔ot sweet at all which more southern style (Northerners tend to like it a little sweet.) I was very impressed over all, and do want to try them again, though nothing I had made me want to stand in line there, particularly in sub-zero temps. 蔍'd like to try the chicken and have some more beans and sausage. I do see why their reputation is so good.

Its been a while since I have 5 starred a restaurant. i am ecstatic that this is the restaurant I am coming back with. Word of mouth, yelp reviews, passing by, aromas, etc. I HAD TO TRY THIS PLACE. We arrived and parking was plentiful and luckily got a spot in their parking lot. Arrive early because when they run out of ribs, you will be pissed. They line was almost out the door and we squeezed in and to my surprise, the manning behind the counter was moving like a well oiled machine. Employees had a line assembly thing going and the line was moving. We ordered the Pulled pork, and both the St. Louis and baby back ribs. On the side we chose, mac and cheese and coleslaw. It was communal style seating and hosts help accommodate us. My food was picture perfect. In fact, I took a few shots myself. I make the perfect bite consisting of my pulled pork sandwich and and some of the peppery slaw. The meat was juicy and tender accompanied by a warm soft bun and that slaw. Utterly amazing. The ribs were tender and fell right off the bone goodness. I was a little ashamed that I might need to do some bib action because I wanted to shove it all in my mouth and I didn't want to stain my new white tee. I refrained from making a bib from paper towels but I still ate like a maniac. The meat wasn't over powered by crazy spices and the flavor of the meat was very pronounced with the right amount of smoke.The sauces are all made from scratch. The BBQ sauce was sweet, tangy, and with the right amount of spice. The mac and cheese was light and fluffy, it didn't stand a chance. I might not be a BBQ queen, but I know what good food is...this is it! Its an experience that I want to relive over and over and over and over.

Is there anything worse than really looking forward to eating at a restaurant all day, arriving three hours before they close and having 2/3 of the menu unavailable? 蔍 mean it's 7:00pm !! 蔆ome on. Let's see. "I'll have the St Louis Ribs!" Nope. Okay, "I'll have the brisket I've heard so much about." NOT. Other Yelpers suggest that Smoque is going to convert Chicagoans to St Louis Ribs?!?!?! 蔠ith what, pictures of St Louis Ribs? They could put up huge posters of these fabled, yet unavailable, ribs so you could know what you wouldn't be eating that night. Or, maybe a coloring book would work better? Average baby-backs ribs which were frankly fairly dry and overcooked. 蔔eeded to slather on tons of bbq sauce to make them a little bit moist. Other ideas. 蔜hink it's time to change locations, find an extra 5000 sq. ft. of seating and expand the kitchen. 蔄dd multiple cash registers and segregate the huge lines from the tables so people who are seated and eating don't have someone standing inches from their food. 蔄lso, I'm also sure they'd love to get a liquor license and start serving beer with their food. 蔅YOB is such a pain. Sadly, Smoque BBQ does not even come close to the hype surrounding it. 蔈xtra star is for very friendly, attentive service.

We ordered the baby back ribs with beans and mac and cheese and the taste portion of sausage. The rib portion was generous and came with plenty of BBQ sauce to cover them with. They were smoky and the rub was tasty. The beans were also smoky with lots of onions and the mac and cheese was creamy and covered with bread crumbs that gave it a nice texture. Absolutely loved the sausage; we plan to order more next time. I ordered carry out on a Friday and was told there was a 1 1/2 hour wait for pick up, which was fine. However, the woman who took the phone order told me about the wait as if she was hoping I would change my mind and not place an order. She was very rude and short with me when I asked her a question. But I would risk the rudeness again because the food was fantastic.

Rows of people lined the inside, disorganized pockets of people outside were tapping their toes and looking at their watches hopelessly crossing their fingers that they would not be late for the Super Bowl. Fortunately for us, we zipped in through the express "I called ahead" line and got our food in no time as they were very organized with tables of pre-ordered food waiting! The look on some people's faces could only be compared to that of a college kid running out after a massive liquor run as I saw guys hauling hundreds of dollars of food with boxes stacked upon boxes looking like a giant tower of Jenga ready to collapse in seconds. We made our heist and hauled back the food to Super Bowl central. For the first half we munched on Lawrence Fish Market sushi and were very intent on eating ribs at associated side orders during the Halftime show featuring The Who. As the bum rush to the kitchen ensued with boxes and foil flying everywhere, I landed a slab of ribs and some cornbread for my troubles. The ribs were tender, heavily seasoned and had a magical smoky flavor. In the dead of winter, Smoque gave me a slice of summer sitting on my plate and I savored every sliver. It will be well worth it for me to go back, line be damned.

Man was I dissapointed. Not only were the ribs dry (I tried their St Louis style dry rub or whatever) their service was disorganized. I had to go up to the counter and wait after we got our food since they gave me the wrong side dish. Some old man in a Smoques shirt came up to me and asked me "Can I help you with something???" but his tone was more like I was causing a problem and not because he wanted to "help me" and all I was doing was standing up at the counter waiting for my side dish. (hmm do I look like a troublemaker?...ok dont answer that hehe) The regular style ribs are a bit better but completely average. Ribs should come off the bone with ease me thinks, dont you? I had to gnaw the meat off. Im never going to come back here. NEVAR!!!

Yes! A barbecue joint by my place! I was so excited to check it out but after experiences with them, I can only sum it up as a "just OK" place. The first thing I like to try when I find a new BBQ joint is their tips and links combo. So I look up at the huge chalkboard menu trying to find it....not on the menu?! Impossible! After a couple of minutes of careful study of the board, I had to settle for the half baby back, half St. Louis rib dinner. Then I found out that they can, and do run out of food for the day. I was told they were out of baby back ribs. So I settle for the St. Louis ribs. And I was not impressed. The rub on the ribs was only OK. The meat itself was just OK. I smelled the sauce that comes on the side. Smelled great, so I poured it on my ribs. And it proceeded to run all down my fingers onto my hands. The darn sauce is too thin! Not cool. Hopefully it'll wake up the flavor of the meat. I took a bite of the sauce-soaked meat, and it was a tad bit better. But I'd have to say that it's best to stay away from the ribs, at least the St. Louis ones. I faired a lot better the second time around. I'm not a fan of pulled pork, so I ordered the sliced brisket sandwich. Best beef brisket sandwich I've had so far. The meat was delicious and cooked to perfection. I have to give them props for the mac and cheese. It is awesome! Too bad they give you so little of it. I'll have to order an extra next time. And the cole slaw was fresh, tasty, and zesty. I prefer a creamy slaw, but their slaw was very good. The fries instantly reminded me of Jimmy's fries, except, they were not as good as Jimmy's. The place is not very pleasing to the eyes, if you care to dine in. That, and their limited parking means my future trips here are for take-out only (and only for the brisket sandwich with mac & cheese).

Any place that FoodTV visits has a lot to live up to. Smoque lived up to expectations and now I'm looking for an excuse to return for more. We ordered the St. Louis ribs and brisket with sides of mac & cheese, beans, cole slaw, cornbread and for dessert: peach cobbler. Even on a snowy cold day, this place was busy so I can only imagine what it's like when the weather is nice. In those instances, I would order take out for sure. Although it was teeming with people, the host easily found us a seat and overall, the service was incredibly attentive and kind. That always wins extra points in my book. But back to the most important part of Smoque -- the food. The ribs are cooked in a dry rub so don't expect messy, saucy ribs. They are tender and flavorful, with a sweet sauce on the side. The brisket was equally tender. It could have benefited from a bit more fat, and the accompanying sauce had a little too much acidity for my taste, but they were still good eats. The sides really stole the show. The mac & cheese is probably the best I've had in Chicago (thus far); the beans have a rich smokiness and some pork mixed in; the slaw, although not creamy, was crispy and fresh; and the cobbler was deeeelicious with a thick, crispy crust and firm, fresh peaches. Overall, an awesome meal and I cannot wait to return for their pulled pork and Texas sausage.

2.5 Having sworn off pork and beef for a decade and a half, I probably should have not have come to Smoque w/ the expectations that I had. �One can't help but to read reviews and then to generalize.) 蔍n any case, I had the half chicken w/ the mac and cheese and fries. 蔜he chicken was pretty average. 蔜he BBQ sauce was pretty mediocre in my opinion. 蔜he mac and cheese, which comes in a small foil tin, and fries were also fairly average. 蔍 couldn't rave about the sides or the chicken or the sauce or the prices, putting this place a little under a 3 in my eyes. �As we ate, my friend remarked that he felt like a cow. 蔍 thought perhaps this was related to his meal (though in retrospect that made no sense since the portions are what I think is being called "sensible" these days). 蔍t turns out that he was referring to the process of ordering and getting seated. 蔣ou slowly mosey up to the counter, place your order, go to the seating police, who then directs you to a table. 蔣ou then get to rub elbows w/ other patrons -- yes, I mean physically -- while you eat. 蔄nd that's if the table police is not too busy spraying the table right next to yours to turn it over for new neighbors. �My arm actually got misted a bit.) The people there are really nice though, and I did appreciate the manager/owner? coming around and asking about our food.

So let me tell you, watching the food network before bed is a bad idea. 蔆atching an episode that involves BBQ is probably the worst you can do for yourself and to top it off they cover a place in Chicago. 蔄ll day I dream about BBQ! 蔍 had BBQ on the brain all day at work and when the time finally came to head to SMOQUE I was so excited. �We get there and just manage to beat the rush and ordered our dinners. 蔍mmediately I recognized the guy that was on TV telling the host how they do their beans, brisket rub, ribs etc and things were smelling wonderfully. 蔍 was greeted by the nice lady at the counter who took my order of chopped brisket, mac and cheese, slaw, beans and a taste of the pulled pork. 蔜he taste option is pretty cool, I should have gotten a taste of everything but I didn't want to over stuff myself and ruin my experience at Smoque. The brisket was very tender and the BBQ sauce was kind of lacking. 蔍 guess I'm not a fan of vinegar based BBQ sauce 蔮ut aside from that the tenderness and texture of the meat was amazing. 蔜he meat really made up for the BBQ sauce. 蔍'd recommend the chopped brisket but you can't really go wrong with any of the meats there. 蔜he mac and cheese was pretty good and the beans were pretty good too. 蔜he peach cobbler was very tasty. 蔒y only gripe was the price, I thought you'd get a little bit more for what you pay for. 蔕ne thing I thought was pretty nice was the host type guy who walked around and made sure everything was going OK. 蔍 thought that was a nice touch for a BBQ joint. Ah well, no biggie. 蔒aybe next time I'll try the ribs

I'll start off by saying- I fucking love this place! I've been there a few times and has yet to disappoint me! the smell before you even walk in the place is enough to make your nipples hard! I've never been a Brisket eater, but every time I've went I had to get it ( which sucks because I really wanna try their ribs, but get trapped ordering the Brisket!) and I love BBQ sauce! I swear I'd eat an Elephants asshole if it was slathered in BBQ sauce,but this Brisket is so good it seems a crime to cover up the taste with sauce. Sides: Fries - huge side of fries,if you like fries,get 'em,.. theres a shit load! I got them for the hell of it one day, normally not into fries,.. but they do give you alot! Mac & Cheese - By far THE best I've ever eaten!!! I don't know how many times anywhere I've had Mac & Cheese somewhere else and thought it was a disappointment, to the point I felt cheap ol' Kraft Mac & Cheese way still better than any "home made" 蔍've had anywhere,.. but Smoques Mac & Cheese fucking RULES!!! its got this nice bread crumb crust that just makes it!,... so insanely good,to the point you may even stop in JUST for that. BBQ Beans - Awesome awesome awesome!!! sweet,sticky,spicy and loaded with brisket,the Beans and Mac & Cheese are a MUST when picking a side! the place is always packed,..get used to it!!,..unless they move to a bigger location or open another store, it will always be packed! but that just a sign of great food! First time I went it was just as they were opening and it was 11 degrees below zero out and there was still a line out the door!

We've been meaning to try Smoque since it opened last year, and finally made the trek up to Pulaski. Maybe it's that my expectations were too high, after hearing such great reviews and seeing it on Diners, Drive-ins, and Dives. Maybe it's that I don't love barbecue sauce in general. Whatever it is, we left disappointed. I thought the macaroni and cheese and the fries were excellent. I loved the way the place was run - order at the counter, then see Barry to get seated. Everyone was super friendly - the woman in front of us in line talked us through what she thought were the best parts of the menu. But the BBQ itself? I wasn't overly impressed. I got the brisket - half chopped, half sliced, and while it was tender and the meat itself had a good flavor, I thought the vinegary BBQ sauce distracted from the flavor. I also thought that it was too fatty for my taste, but that's just me. Mike got the pulled pork, and he liked it, but said he'd had better pulled pork at Kuma's. He might stop by on his way home from work to pick up some BBQ for himself for dinner, but I think I probably won't be back to Smoque, at least not any time soon.

This place can rub and smoke me any day. 蔛o very good. �Had Pork and St. Louis Ribs- tender, meaty, smoky and flavorful! I could not stop! �Cornbread is a wonderful mix of crunchy and moistly tender. �Macaroni is cheesy goodness and not greasy. �Beans were tangy tasty- not just beans and bbq sauce but an intricate mix of onion, beans, meaty pieces, and sauce. �The sauce is tangy and bright. �I enjoyed the slaw, just like BBQ there are many ways to do it and many opinions. 蔜his slaw was refreshingly bright- crisp cabbage, red onions mixed with a vinegary dressing. �Staff was super friendly. Will be back 蕋o dine there instead of just pick up and go.

As much as I love the food from this place, the prices for the amount of food you get are a bit outrageous. They're not the best BBQ in the world, but they're as best you can get in the city proper. The sides are what I take issue with. However good the macaroni and cheese is a(nd the others), again, they give you half a cups worth and charge you an astronomical price just because they were featured on television. This spot is busy because it's trendy, not because it's the best.

Read tons of positive 蕆eviews and saw them praised on many TV shows. So, I visited this place 3 times. Basically, I tried everything and everything was OK. It wasn't mind blowing. And if I'm being critical, the meat was just too bland. Without the sauce their wasn't much "Smoque." Really, where's the smokey flavor from properly smoked BBQ? If your joint is called "Smoque", shouldn't 蕋he food have that signature BBQ flavor/smell? Being less critical, everything was just down the road, very light flavors and nothing over powering. It's BBQ done OK. Not too dry, but not too moist, but I guess just not enough "Bang" or "Yeow!" for me. My wife just doesn't care for it and like me can't figure out all the praise. She just can't believe all the hype for just OK BBQ. The line is always long here and be prepared to wait. The counter people have complained that there isn't more space for more cash registers. The place is small and getting a seat is tough. The place is relatively new, clean and nice. Parking is tough around there too, street parking mostly. Its location is in a quiet neighbor hood and easy to get to since it is near a highway exit ramp.

YUM! 蔛moque was just as we expected....but better. 蔜he service was fast and very friendly. 蔜hey do a great job of keeping the place clean during the rush. The sink/soap set up in the bathroom was no nonsense so you could get in there and wash all the tasties off your hands. Back to the food....couldn't get enough of it! Pulled pork was so tender and flavorful. Cornbread wasn't too dry. 蔅eans, slaw, mac'n'cheese, ribs, chicken....all delicious! �Next time, I might ride my bike there just to balance it all out.

I've heard a lot about Smoque. But I was skeptical. Could it be as good as Fat Willey's (hands down my favorite BBQ in Chicago)? We decided to stop by on a whim and get carryout. The place was hoppin'. You order at the counter to get your food, and while there was a line at 5pm on a Sunday, the orders were coming up quick. I got my food in about 5 minutes after ordering even though it was packed. To give it due diligence, I ordered the full slab of ribs (1/2 baby back, 1/2 St. Louis style) with sides of mac and cheese and cornbread. We consumed and digested, and now the verdict is in. I have to say Smoque is every bit as good as Fat Willey's and that it might be a tie as to which I like better. Actually, I would have to have the ribs side by side to make a final decision. But the thing I like about Smoque are the options you have. Picking your sides is great, because the mac and cheese was really good, though I probably wouldn't want a large order of it. And the cornbread was tasty. Only the slaw was average. The ribs were great, both styles. The sauce was good, but did not overpower the meat. And the fact that you can get a half and half order is cool. Also-BIG PLUS-for $3 extra, you can get a side of beef brisket or pulled pork. I am always in the dilemma of whether I want brisket or just ribs, and this option solved my problem, and for the $3 you definitely get enough to make it worth it. The brisket was excellent as well. The place itself was actually not what I pictured at all. For some reason, I thought it was going to be somewhat more upscale (which for BBQ and the location, 蔍'm not sure why I thought this). But in fact the inside is as casual and bare bones as it gets. It's all about the food. There are dozens of small tables pushed together to make for a communal, get to know your neighbor, kind of experience. Everyone seemed friendly as well.There were people and kids of all kinds eating here and ordering to go. As far as ambiance, I may prefer Fat Willey's because it is a little more sit down, though casual, and they have outdoor seating and beer. But Smoque has it's own thing going too, and you may prefer to just order your food at the counter, rather than have someone waiting on you. Now the next time I need BBQ, it will be a tough decision. Willey's or Smoque?

Finally... Guy Fieri was right about something! Yes there is a line folks. Even on a Tuesday night. But like every night, its worth the wait. I had the brisket platter, mac n cheese, fries and a peach cobbler. I have to admit, I was kinda put off by the seemingly small portion of mac n cheese and cobbler served in mini muffin tins. Portion control never goes over well with me. However, as soon as I started to get a taste of everything, I was pretty full and didn't think I can finish the cobbler. My favorite thing is that the cobbler was only $2!!! At some places, I want to have dessert but usually never have room for it in my tummy or my wallet. Overall... it was bomb.

Took the wife for lunch here yesterday. We came back for dinner with the kids tonight. I can't rule out a return visit within the next seven days. This place smells GREAT from the street. Even better than San Soo Gab San if that means anything to you. Story time. . .we joined the line out the door at 6:27pm on Memorial Day weekend and stood in light rain for about 10 minutes waiting to get in. While we waited outside the owner appeared and taped an apology on the door for running out of brisket. Ten minutes later he replaced that sign with an out of pulled pork/out of brisket sign. None of this looked good, and some other peeps in line began to scuttle away to their safe little plan B Thai places. Fail. Knowing what was at stake we decided to stick it out. We made it inside and felt the panic and longing as we tried to avoid leering at the other diners gnawing their ribs and stuffing those fat delicious fries down their gullets. The wife noticed plenty of pork sandwiches were still making it out of the prep area. Hmm. . .where did this magical bonus pork appear from? The smoker only holds so much meat, and it bestows its gifts but once a day, and lo it runneth out from time to time, but we decided they post the "gone fishin" signs when the line threatens to test the patience of the neighbors. Or maybe someone in the kitchen is about to stab someone. Anyway long story short we were all sitting down to delicious pulled pork sandwiches by 6:56. So let's do the math. . .even at their most slammed, this teeny L train sized shack can deliver you from literally out at the curb to pulled pork heaven inside of 30 minutes. Just keep your cool like the staff does and you'll be fine. ok let's talk portion control. I can overeat with the best of you slobs. . .Smoque's sandwiches are plenty big, even if you're one of those carb haters that scrapes the meat off. It comes with a "small" fry that has about 2 potatoes' worth in a grease lovin mini grocery bag and a fistful of slaw. I am not into slaw; I ate this slaw. It's crispy and fresh and has no mayo. Nice celery seed flavor to it though. The owner told me they add fresh dressing to the cabbage every 20 minutes. So kimche it's not. Thank god. Wow you're still here. . .ok for your first visit I'd suggest the half and half, just to validate your suspicion that the pulled pork is ever so slightly better than the brisket. Why do you think they make bacon out of pork? I rest my case. Still you need to try everything here, let's try that brisket. It's mighty good. 2nd trip reconnect with the pork. mmmm pork. My next visit I'll get St. Louis style ribs. I'm told they are fattier, meatier and have mo' flav than the baby back ribs. Ribs are pricey and I'm cheap so I'll prob. get the half slab. Staff, presentation, ambience. . .in that order. The prep guys all look pretty tough, kinda like that. Actually I am totally grateful they didn't put up retarded "authentic" roadhouse memorabilia or weathered barnwood. I admit if it were grimy and old and on the south side and you got lost trying to find it it would seem like more of an adventure. Just saying. Check out the smoker when you go back to wash your hands. It's like 8 times bigger than those rotisseries they have at Dominick's. Prices are fair. We got out of there for around $10 a head. Not bad at all. Minor point, they do a lot of little things to keep it all running smoothly. Too boring to write about but I noticed them all. More restaurants should sweat the details like Smoque does. BYOB. We didn't. Pathetic really. Next time.

We were wandering around in the snow looking for a new place to eat since we moved to the Old Irving Park hood in the fall. We had actually walked into Smoque before, but the lack o' vegetarian options made us walk out. (Yeah, I know BBQ place...meat, I get it) I did have a craving for Mac N Cheese and the non veggie fiance wanted to try the brisket, so we stopped by and grabbed some food to go. The service was fast, and most of the food was warm by the time we got home. (The fry bag was open so our taters got a bit chilled). That being said, the fries were still awesome, the brisket I am told was tender and delicious. The mac was good and the beans were delicious... though strict veggies beware a meat chunk did live in the beans. I also indulged in some corn bread which had corn in it and was not your typical dry cornbread. And I'm not big on slaw, but the fiance really dug that it wasn't made with mayo. I do wish that Smoque would throw on a portabello on the grill or something, but I have no problem with making a meal of sides here.

Went on Friday night and my wife and I liked it a lot. I had the half baby back ribs half St. Louis ribs. Both sets of ribs were very good. The 1 star negative was that the baby back ribs were very fatty. Three ribs on the end were almost all fat. And the side dishes are too small. That goes as a positive though since the sides were very good. Sides: Macaroni & Cheese and Backed Beans - The Mac & Cheese had a nice crust on it and was served in a small (too small...see above) dish and the beans were served the same way. If you don't like lines or crowds...you might want to go at off times. Luckily when we got there there were only 8 people in front of us. Ordering and pickup was easy, and the staff was really nice. Especially with keeping the seating moving. I will definitely be going back and ordering a WHOLE slab of the St. Louis style ribs. Oh forgot, the BBQ sauce there rocks.

So, after having Fat Willy's and Calvin's, a friend recommended Smoque as a great BBQ spot that's still young enough to put the needed care into their food to produce a great meal. 蔛moque was definitely one of the better BBQ joints I've been to in a while and I'll be heading back, as long as they don't run out of food. As someone else said, call ahead. 蔜he conversation usually goes like this: Caller: I'm going to be there in about an hour - what do you think you'll have left? Smoque Employee: Well, we're running a little low on _____, but we should be fine with everything else. I had the pulled pork with fries and cornbread and I split the St Louis ribs taste with my girlfriend. 蔍 think we could have split the pork platter as well and just bought an extra bun. 蔜he pulled pork wasn't very warm and a little more fatty than I would have liked - I think they might have been scraping the bottom of the barrel. 蔜he ribs were fantastic and I would love to try a half slab of each next time. 蔜he sides were all great, especially the Jiffy cornbread that reminded me of eating BBQ chicken at my grandparent's. 蔒y girlfriend picked up the mac and cheese and loved it. 蔍 really wanted to try the peach cobbler but I probably would have exploded. So next time, I think we'll split a platter, buy 2 buns, maybe a taste of the brisket, and hopefully we'll have room for some cobbler.

You ever have one of those moments when you bite into your meal, and you nearly collapse under the weight of unbridled joy, a feeling that everything is right with the world, complete, unmitigated pleasure? I had one of those moments at Smoque. As a lifelong Chicagoan, I have always felt "barbeque deprived." 蔐et's face it, our fair city does not have a reputation as a smoked meats mecca. 蔍 especially felt slighted when I'd visit my brother in Austin, Texas, which has knee-buckling good barbeque on virtually every corner. �Smoque is the one place I've found in Chicago that comes close to replicating top-flight Texas barbeque. 蔜he brisket is tender and bursting with flavor. 蔜he St. Louis-style ribs (FAR superior to the baby backs, in my humble opinion) are fall off the bone tender, and paired with a tangy, vinegary barbeque sauce that puts Carson's molasses-based abomination to shame. 蔜he sides are excellent - particularly the macaroni and cheese. 蔄nd this might be the highest compliment I can give - I ate every bite of my coleslaw, a food I generally despise.

Ive been to most of the bbq places in the city and evanston. 蔍 consider myself a bbq snob (both commercial and private) and would never cook on gas, or briquets. �Many of the northside places, IMHO are way over hyped by people who think Open Pit is the sauce to end all sauces. Smoque is no such place. The St.Louis slab was perfect, and the dry rub was probably the best that I have ever had. �The sauce was complex and complimented the rub perfectly. �The chicken was juicy and cooked evenly all the way thru. My only gripe is the Peach cobbler did not have a top on it, and was sealed with foil. 蔅y the time I got home, it had dripped in the bag.

I have a personal rule that I only give out five stars when a restaraunt does something better than I've ever experienced before (or at least damn close). Smoque met this criteria on with SEVERAL items! First of all, and most importantly, it was the BEST bbq ribs/pulled pork I'd ever had. Listen to me here, EVER! Next, 蔵t was the best Mac 'n Cheese I've eaten in my life, and this is coming from someone that considers himself quite the expert on the Mac 'n Cheese. The line can be a bit of a wait, but it is well worth it. That is, is if you can withstand every single person exiting the place (the exit conveniently next to the line) thinking they are at amateur comedy night at the Apollo. My personal favorite was: "Oh no, they are all out, sorry about that (as they rub their belly)". About every third person out the door gave us that one... However, for every person that made the obnoxious joke, there was another behind them offering a supportive: "Don't worry it's worth the wait (also while they rub their belly; that is a consistent theme)". 蔕verall, if you haven't already been there, I'm jealous of you that you get to go for the first time very soon...

5 stars. DUH. Ordered pulled pork sandwich. Delish! The bun is soft but stays together (a pet peeve of mine are wimpy buns! No more wimpy buns!) My boyfriend had the same but his came with the slaw. He piled it on top his pulled pork and loved the crunchy fun it brought. We also both got the 1/4 slab of St. Louis ribs. The rub was a little smokey for me, but i ate them alllllll nonetheless. I just slathered on their A mazing vinegar BBQ sauce. I only wish they supplied wet naps, as I go through 25 napkins in one sitting! The corn bread is always a favorite of ours when we go to Smoque. A little word of advice- they don't have honey-so bring your own! This is how it goes in my house: Boyfriend: 'Want to go to Smoque?" Me: "Yeah! Grab the honey, honey!" We love Smoque!

Saw this place on Diners Drive-Ins and Dives a couple years ago and have been waiting to get back to Chicago to taste it. All I gotta say is AWESOME! I got the taste portions of the pork, sliced brisket, and a texas sausage with a side of the beans (which were the most interesting to me on the TV spot) and a cornbread muffin. I've never had better meats and the sauces tasted good although I didn't want to mess up the flavor of the meat so I went mostly dry. The sausage wasn't as spicy of a link as I prefer, but the perfect smoke flavor more than made up for that. Absolutely worth the hype. I don't subscribe to hype, just to taste and it was perfect. Enjoy!

Ribs = greasy (not the good greasy like most ribs, there was lots of fat on these baby backs) Briskey = pretty good pulled pork = left more to desire peach cobbler = tastes like canned peaches mac and cheese = yummy slaw = decent Not worth the hype. 蔊ood if you're near, not worth more than a 5 minute trip

I don't think I've ever had bbq this good in my life... then again I'm from the north, and i've never been to Memphis in May BBQ Cookoff (which I would love to attend one day). But as far as I've tasted, this is the best! It's the perfect place to go for ribs, brisket, pulled pork, chicken, texas sausage, and your favorite country sides all under one roof... and the best part is that they allow BYOB. So you can sit there chill with your friends, make yourself some cocktails while you wait for your food. I like that there's no waiters/waitresses, it's counter service - you order, u pick up your food, grab a seat and chow down. Half a slab will fill you up if you're not a big eater, but I would still get the full slab b/c you'll definitely want the leftovers! Their mac n cheese and cornbread also compliment their ribs really well. The place has gotten a lot more packed since it was featured on Food Network, but it still hasn't lost its hospitable flair one bit... can't wait to go here again!

I know that I'm not an expert on BBQ, but I think I know a good rack of ribs when I taste one. 蔍 ordered the baby back ribs, the beans, fries, and a side of the pulled pork. 蔜he ribs were slightly overdone on one side, and were not easy to pull apart...I don't know if this is supposed to be good or bad. 蔋owever when I bit into a few of the overdone side ribs, the meat was tough, chewy, and had a chalky taste. 蔍'm going to give this place another try, but mark one down for the ribs. �The pulled pork was delicious...so a thumbs up on that!!!

The BBQ beans were amazing(and have now become my favorite thing on their sides menu), and I only wish they'd make the portion of the macaroni and cheese they get(if you choose this as your side) equal to the portion you get of the BBQ beans. Finally tried the Saint Louis ribs, and those are excellent! The sauce that comes with the ribs(it has a very tomato-based taste) compliments the ribs very well. Peach cobbler isn't too bad, not my favorite place I've had it at, but certainly is still very enjoyable(and within the city of Chicago, how many places serve it anyway? not very many). I'm starting to think the cole slaw issue is just more of a matter of taste, as I just prefer cole slaw that isn't heavy in vinegar. But I've gotten past this, and my opinion of this place is definitely on the way up.

One of my favorite BBQ restaurants. I have a number of friends in Texas and it certainly seems Smoque has their recipes made to perfection. I haven't had an issue ordering immediately on off hours. On the other hand, I've been in line for quite some time on weekends and during lunch hours. Regardless of the wait, the food is simply outstanding. I haven't been able to favor one item over another because all of them have been amazing. Have also had the pleasure to meeting the owner who was incredibly polite and pleasant to meet....which makes this establishment that much more memorable.

Brisket: 蔒eh, no taste. Ribs: 蔣um Pulled Pork: Orgasmic You know you're at a good eatin' place when you're surrounded by "professionals." �Be sure to get the bbq sauce on your sandwich that's used for the ribs, it's thicker and has a more smokey flavor. �Found a new favorite spot!

From where I live Smoque might as well be in Wisconsin. �However, as far as Smoque seems to be from my house in the West Loop, it really doesn't take that long because its right off 90/94 at Lawrence. �Well, that is if there isn't traffic. 蔐uckily both times we went the highway was wide open. On both of our visits to Smoque we were greeted by a line that made it almost out the door. They do a good job and getting peoples order taken and getting them seated so it's never been an issue. 蔖lus you gotta think if people are willing stand in line to get some BBQ it either must be really good or the people standing in line must be really stupid. 蔍 don't think they're stupid. I'm a creature of habit and both times I had the pulled pork sandwich platter w/ slaw and two sides. 蔜he pulled pork is very tender and there vinegar based sauce really compliments the pork well. 蔜he fries are solid and the pork & beans are also very good. 蔉ellow diners have tried the brisket and ribs which were also well received. The decor at Smoque is clean and for once I use clean as negative descriptor. 蔠hen it comes to BBQ I feel like the space should be dark, dirty, and loud. 蔍 want to see a country western band playing behind chicken wire getting pelted with Old Style bottles. 蔍 want some old dude telling customers to go to hell when they try tell him how good the BBQ they make at home is. 蔍 want to see a sign that says "Vegetarians Suck" (I don't think vegetarians suck, but I want my pit master to think that). 蔝nfortunately, the service at Smoque is as good as the restaurant is clean. 蔜he staff wears branded Smoque t-shirts and they all just look too damn nice and clean! Despite the spic and span interior, both of my experiences were very good and I will be going back at some point. 蔋owever, Smoque definitely lacks something. 蔍 guess I want a "BBQ Joint" and Smoque comes off as a "Barbecue Restaurant". �I'm afraid to say that Chicago will most likely never be able to compete with Kansas City, Texas, and the Carolinas for the best BBQ joints. 蔅ut if you are looking for some good Chicago BBQ Smoque will get you close. 1 Pulled Pork Platter w/ slaw and two sides --------------------------------------------------?----------- $10.00

If I could do 3.5 stars, that's what I would give this place. 蔜he ribs are definitely great here. 蔍t has the great smokey flavor and the barbecue has a great tang without too much sweetness. 蔍 prefer the st. louis ribs cause they're meatier. �Seating is little difficult, but you won't wait more than 15 minutes. My problem with this place are their sides. 蔍t's my personal belief that one of the best thing about ribs are the sides that it comes with. 蔜here is nothing like a side of mac and cheese or baked beans to compliment your ribs. 蔋ere, the sides are simply disappointing. 蔍 tried most of their sides, and they were all a miss with the exception of their french fries, which isn't even a true side when paired with ribs. There aren't very many choices of food here either, so come here only if you are looking for ribs and not much more. 蔜heir brisket was not flavorful enough for me, although cooked to true tenderness. 蔜hey definitely know how to cook their meats. I do think they serve excellent ribs here, but when rated against other great rib restaurants in Chicago, it falls a little short b/c of its lack of great sides, so I had to take away couple stars.

Smoque was recommended to me by a friend and I am VERY happy that I went. �I went with the full slab of St. Louis and they literally fell off the bone. 蔜hey are very proud of their BBQ sauce and I can see why. 蔍 also had a side of Mac n Cheese and that blew me away. 蔍 absolutely love cheese and love to try Mac n Cheese wherever I go. 蔜he only downside to the mac n cheese was the tiny portion.

So it was a Thursday night and our little one spent the night by Grandma's house. When I asked my husband where he wanted to go he suggested "smoque". 蔍 wasn't that excited about making a trip further north for bbq but it was food and I was getting hungry. When we arrived at Smoque the line was already out the door and I was starting to get agitated at the thought of standing in the ridiculously long line. Seriously, a line for bbq? I thought to myself "this hole in the wall better be good". When we finally got to the cashier I ordered the brisket, corn bread and mac and cheese. Number 72, number 73.... number 74. Finally! I don't think I will ever forget that first bite of brisket- it was so tender and juicy that it melted in my mouth. I was not really a fan of the sauce they gave with the brisket, but the brisket was seasoned so well I didn't miss the sauce. Their mac and cheese was also excellent. It is a little too crowded for me especially if we have our little one along. I definitely will be heading back for the brisket- next time it will be take out though.

My first experience with Smoque involved cold, leftover pulled pork. 蔋onestly, after that, I was sold. M'lady and I went in on Saturday for lunch to try it hot and fresh...I wish there was a sixth star. �Not only is the food delicious, but you get SO MUCH for your money. For around $20, we got the brisket plate with two sides (the day's special of brisket chili as well as baked beans), the pulled pork plate with two sides (double mac and cheese), two drinks, and a side of cornbread...WITH PIECES OF REAL CORN INSIDE!!! HOLY COWS!!!!! And, if I may say so, I think they're cooking with holy cows because it was allllllllllllllll delicious (and yes, I know pork is not cow...I was just making an animal pun. Woot!)

Well, we had a serious craving for BBQ so we checked in with all of you fine people. Smoque delivered the goods with gusto! I'm pretty picky about BBQ (OK not that picky) and Smoque treats their ingredients right! We tried: Baby Back Ribs (very good), Pulled Pork (very good), Fresh Cut Fries (Great), Mac & Cheese (just ok) and BBQ Beans (GREAT!). We brought a bottle of Bonny Doons which was great (even in a paper cup!) until we got our food. I don't know what we were thinking but next time we'll have a couple of Blue Moons;) For a place that doesn't have servers, we got a lot of positive attention while we were eating. Smoque knows what they're doing and if my second trip is as good as the first I'll add a star to my rating.

Smoque has the best beef brisket I've had in the city. 蔄ny place that has more than one cop car outside has to be good. I definitely agree with Natalie T. 蔣ou have to order for pick up. 蔜he lines have been getting ridiculous. I chit chat with the owner whenever I'm on the phone or in line and he says the same thing, that he loves that it's loved by Chicagoians, but hates that it's getting so busy. 蔄pparently, the idea was for it to be a neighborhood spot, only it's so good EVERYONE goes there. 蔛o, the neighbors have been complaining, and it's not been very friendly. So, I do my part and get in and get out. 蔜ake out has been great. 蔍t's always ready when they say it will be and it's travels well. Tips: 1. When ordering the beef brisket, get the dinner (brisket chopped) and two buns. 蔍t's enough for two sandwiches and cheaper than doing separate orders. 2. If you like mac & cheese, try theirs. 蔍t's good, portioned out -if you are an addict like me, and it's got a great breadcrumb topping. 3. 蔍f you like fresh cut fries, you'll probably like theirs. 蔋owever, if you don't like pepper, then don't get them. 蔜hey tend to be on the peppery side.

This is my favorite BBQ spot in Chicago. I like to bring friends here from out of town for an "authentic" Chicago restaurant experience. The waiting in line part just adds to the anticipation. I have been here many times. I usually like to get the ribs or the pulled pork sandwich, the mac & cheese (creamy), the baked beans (best I've ever had in life), the cornbread (sweet and fresh), 蔭nd the fries (freaking amazing- nice and crispy). Smoque needs to open another location- quickly. My words of advice for you: Don't get the peach cobbler - it is more like a peach crisp. There is not any crust or dough parts inside. For me, that's key. Go during off hours- before or after a typical dinner rush. I usually 蔿ike going during the week around 8pm or on a Sunday at 3 in the afternoon. Its much easier to get a table during off hours. Enjoy!

So like many of these Yelpers, I found Smoque through DDD [Diners, Drive-ins, and Dives] on the Food Network. It was drool at first sight. I went with a few friends and we decided to mix it up and order something different than one another so we could get a taste of a little bit of everything. Here's the lowdown: - Texas Sausage: A little greasy for my taste..Don't get me wrong, I'm down with eating unhealthy, but this went a little overboard for my taste. Verdict: Good, but I've had better sausage in my day. - Brisket: Flavor was AMAZING with AND without sauce. However, when they advertise 15 hours of cooking, I expect it to be ridiculously tender..maybe I came on a bad day. Verdict: Delish. I'll definitely give it another go, though. - Baby Back Ribs: No lie, some of the best BBR I've had in a while. Great flavor. Lean meat. SO tender. Verdict: Primo stuff. - St. Louis Ribs: Apparently I've been sheltered most of my life because I have never heard of St. Louis RIbs. Stuff is AMAZING. The rub on these bad boys is insane. There was so much meat on there, too. Verdict: You gotta try it. - Sides: Mac n Cheese was ok. Slaw was above par. Fries had this divine seasoning. Overall, service was solid. Didn't wait too long to order. They had table staff to ensure everybody got a table. For the most part, the food was excellent. Definitely worth going back.

My bf and I came here during our first trip to Chicago in search of good local Chicago food. 蔅ased on the spectacular recommendations on yelp, we thought we'd give this place a try. It was.... ehhh okay. �I don't eat meat, but my bf got the combo ribs (St. Louis and baby back), but it didn't look like there was any difference between the two. 蔠e're not even sure if he got the right order since they tasted the same. �We had a side of cole slaw, mac n cheese, cornbread, and peach cobbler. 蔜he mac n cheese and cornbread were average. 蔍 loved the cole slaw... it was different in that it was less mayo-y and more tangy with some citrusy or vinegar base. 蔜he peach cobbler was pretty good too. Overall though... it wasn't anything we'd rave about and probably wouldn't go out of our way to revisit Smoque if we were in town again. 蔉or us, we don't know how Smoque has such raving yelp reviews. 蔒aybe it's really good BBQ for Chicago... but I know for my bf, he's had the best BBQ ribs at Phil's in San Diego, CA and Dinosaur in NYC. 蔅ut Smoque in Chicago just didn't seem to compare.

Just went back to Smoque again this past weekend during the Blues Festival, and it still rocks my socks. One of the best gems on the NW side of the Chi, and not a "hidden gem" anymore by any means! The BBQ was still chargrilled to perfection. The meat had the right fattiness and came off the bones easy. I had the 1/2 slab St. Louis and 1/2 slab Baby Back combo. $23 OTD, but worth every penny. The sides (Mac & Cheese and cornbread) were still piping hot and small enough to not fill you up (so that you enjoy the awesome MEAT). Oh and this place is STILL BYOB with no extra "corking" fees to exploit it. Yep! My group and I brought in a fifth and a 6 pack of beers, and boy was it great to sit down and drink that to get a nice summer buzz going before eating :-) $25 liquor store tab sure beats a $125 bar tab! LOL Go Smoque! This is what great BBQ in the Midwest is all about. I wish that the mandatory slaw was replaceable with any of their other sides though.

I read all the reviews and was expecting nothing short of Robert Johnson's devil-owned soul to come slap me in the face when I took a bite. Nonetheless, I was relatively unfazed. 蔒y biggest issue was with the uncomfortable dining environment. 蔜his struck me as a lunch place: cavernous, very harshly lit, bare floors, cafeteria seating, the food counter, all the way down to the self-serve pop machine. 蔔ot like I'm any huge dining snob, I was just expecting something a little more laid-back and condusive to dining. Onto the food. 蔍 had the Pulled Pork Platter w/2 sides, comes with slaw. 蔜he pulled pork was good, but not excellent. 蔜he sauce wasn't what I was expecting. 蔛law was eh... it was like a few sprouts. 蔜he Mac & Cheese would have been great, if they gave you more than a tiny cup of it. 蔄nd the fries were really good, the best part of the meal. I do admire their BBQ Manifesto, I'm glad to see a place take a stand on food that, as they say, inspires much debate. 蔍t's also a good addition to the neighborhood. 蔍'll probably come back to check out another dish, but only because the options are more limited on this side of town. Fat Willy's is still my number-one, hands-down favorite in the city. 蔜hey beat out Smoque on flavor, options, portions, taste, and ambience (by a long shot). 蔍 may be spoiled, but other places raised the bar for me and I think Smoque is only going to do well because of its relative isolation.

I like that they give you many options for combining food - 1/2 brisket and 1/2 pulled pork on a sandwich, the option to add small tasting portions of things to your meal. 蔜he brisket sandwich was spectacular, the fries were hot and crispy, the mac & cheese was a little cupcake of cheesy heaven - now 蔍 want to go back and try the pulled pork and the peach cobbler. �We got an order of the chicken to go for eating the next day, and when I popped it in the microwave cats and roommates came out of their lairs to see what was cooking.

That's it. Smoque is officially THE BEST barbecue in town. The last time I visited this fine establishment, I had the pulled pork. Good, very good. But this past time, I went out on a limb and tried the baby back ribs. I must admit that I was a bit skeptical, as I have a special affinity for barbecue sauce on ribs and didn't really trust the dry rub. But alas, I was feeling a little adventurous. And boy did it pay off! Not only did Smoque get an additional star from me to make an even five, they also earned my endorsement of the Best Barbecue in Chicagoland.

The counter service and grab n go line was long upon entering. It surprised us though that we cued up quickly to the front. Here, we came for ribs and ribs are what they got best. Choose from either babyback or st. louis style (more meat) ribs and throw some sides on the side. Sauce is tangy Mac n cheese has a good balance of cheese and crunchy bread topping, yet I was disappointed at the small portion. Slaw is good - not the mayo typical. I want to try again, but am happy the north side is getting more options for ribs. My favorites up north are on western.

Had a pulled pork sandwich here with my friend. The atmosphere was kind of loud and uncomfortable (bad acoustics + crazy noise) and they tried to seat us at a long table knocking elbows with a screaming kid (no thanks). We sat off to the side somewhere else. The food itself was pretty good, but I think we crammed ourselves too full and got nauseous. The bread they put the sandwich on wasn't really my favorite (I shouldn't be eating bread anyway but couldn't resist), it was like a dinner roll or something. Pulled pork itself was fine, but the sauce? Weird, thin, and way too tomato-based which I guess is "another kind of bbq" as opposed to what I'm used to (I don't pay enough attention to the bbq Nazi shows on Food Network where people argue about what's "right" about bbq sauce). Cole slaw wasn't bad. I would go here again and give it another shot.

1 year ago, I would've given this place 2 stars based on the chicken and pulled pork - both were mediocre. 蔍 also had a tasting of the brisket, which is the ONLY reason I agreed to go back recently- it was the MOST TENDER, SOFTEST brisket I've ever had! 蔍 normally hate brisket but I turned into a fan at Smoque. Since I read Nick C's recent review before my most recent visit to Smoque (as the fiance was dying to go back), I understood that they offer 2 different sauces and maybe that's where I went wrong. Al (the host who was seating us) gave us his recommendations for which sauces to put on what. �All I can say is that the ribs were delicious on it's own but with the "regular" bbq, it's to-die-for! 蔜he brisket was awesome again and they were nice enough to give me the vinegar based sauce and the tomato based sauce on the side so I could do what I like. 蔅oth sauces are great but it's a matter of preference for how you want to top your meat. �We also tried the peach cobbler - YUMMERS! 蔜he crust was caramelized and had almond slices to give it an extra crunch! 蔍'm still drooling!

I don't know jack about BBQ. Texan? Memhpis style? St. Louis-an? No clue. But I know I do like moist meat, tasty/tangy sauce and a smoky flavor. Smoque really hits the spot. I've had the baby back ribs and the pulled pork...both excellent. The macaroni and cheese is very tasty, though the portion is kinda small. And their cornbread/muffin slathered in butter is divine. The seating is a little awkward in that the tables are all put together in community style. One, I'm not a big fan of eating next to strangers and two, since most people share this sentiment, everyone tries to spread out , which only makes it more difficult to find a seat. It's BYOB, which I'll have to participate in next time I go. Get in line and get yourself some b-b-q!

I'm having a hard time finding an opening sentence to express how much I love this place. I'm not even a typical "bbq" kind of person. (No, I dont know what that means, so dont ask me.) But this....it's heaven. It really is. I have had the following things: Brisket- To. Die. For. Perfection. I've only had it in sliced form and I've been told this is the far superior style. It's smoky and saucy but not too saucy (but just saucy enough if you know what I mean). It reheats well, so dont hesitate to get some to go. Maybe a pound of two. Eat it for breakfast. Seriously. Cornbread- EXACTLY how I like it. Not dry, chunks of corn...perfect amount Mac and Cheese- ditto what I said about the corn bread. Delish. Brisket Chili- everything I said about the brisket, but add gas Cole slaw- not mayo-y, so not my style, but people that like a vinegar cole slaw tend to like it. I've also tasted the St Louis ribs and they were heaven as well. �About the place in general, yes, it's packed (thanks Guy Fieri!) but it's BYOB so bring something to drink while you're in line. Both times I've gone, on a Sunday night around 7ish, I waited no more than 20 minutes for a table. They've got a very efficient system going, you get your table, then shortly after that you get your food. 蔍t's cheap (to me at least) and a good amount of food for what you pay. To sum it up...I like Smoque. Just like everyone else. But I wanted to write a review anyway. :)

This is a review of Smoque BBQ, and to a lesser extent - a review of the Food Network show "Diners, Drive-ins, and Dives." Reason being, because DDD is the reason I went to Smoque in the first place. I grew up in Texas, so when a Texan buddy of mine was in town visiting me in Chicago he told me he had seen this Smoque BBQ place on DDD and we should definitely try it out. Texas BBQ? Profiled on Food Network? Sounded like a no-brainer and we were excited about trying it out. It was an unusually hot and muggy June day (very Texas like), so the scene was set for a little reminder of home. Or at least that was the thought process... Smoque proves that just because something is profiled on Food Network, doesn't mean it's good. Or even adequate. Food Network jumped the shark on food integrity long ago. I'd estimate somewhere between The Next Food Network Star and Cupcake Wars. Thank God for Alton Brown - perhaps their only saving grace. Anyway - the food at Smoque was barely just ok. I'm no BBQ purist, but I will say I've been to numerous good AND crappy BBQ joints during my life, and Smoque would have trouble holding their own amidst the "crappy" category. Very sub-par for something featured on the Food Network. The sauce - often the crown jewel of a famous BBQ joint - was forgettable. Our group of four each ordered different meats and sides so we could share and get a more comprehensive tasting. We were all disappointed to say the least. The disappointment was severe considering the journey we took to get there (because of construction on some EL lines, we had to take two trains, a bus, and eventually a cab to get there). The food was hardly worth our Odyssey. Oh, and did I mention Smoque gave me food poisoning? I was sick for 3 days after eating there, effectively ruining a long weekend with friends in town. Now, I am a fan of the CONCEPT of "Diners, Drive-ins, and Dives." This, because of my general disdain for chain restaurants and my love of great little-known mom-and-pop places. I do a fair bit of travel for my job and if I was limited to Chilis and Applebees for all my meals I would lose my mind. But Food Network really does its viewers a disservice by featuring places like Smoque. They get away with it because they figure most viewers are unlikely to actually go to most of the places featured, and you can't taste or smell food through the TV set. Guy Fiere, albeit a decent TV host, is certainly no chef of record and all he does is kiss up to these places he features. He never plays the role of true critic, automatically discounting just about everything he features. Not to mention his abortion of a Sushi/BBQ (con)fusion restaurant, Tex Wasabi. Anyone stupid enough to fuse BBQ and Sushi has respect for neither BBQ or sushi. And he should really be ashamed of himself. But the Food Network is the machine which gives people like Fiere a voice to lead us all astray in our cullinary pursuits. So to summerize: Smoque BBQ - SKIP IT. And be skeptical of anything Guy Fiere features.

my god, it's been forever since I've eaten from here. So when my friend texted me that he wanted to grab some smoque for pickup I naturally said of course. I put my eating boots on and got myself mentally prepared for the inevitable gorging that was about to happen. We ordered up a brisket platter with two sides of mac n cheese (I mean really, how do you not get down with their mac n cheese), a half slab of st louis ribs, and an order of brisket chilli. Well, all of the food got demolished when we got back (along with some of the food getting picked at in the car as well). The brisket was insanely tender and was falling apart left and right. The ribs were very good, but the chilli was awesome and the mac n cheese got inhaled It was packed when we got there and I'm not used to ordering ahead, so I was looking around like a lost lamb at first and was looking at the big line that was at the door. I finally figured out to just go up to the register and in about 5 minutes or so I had our order and was out the door. When going here after 4pm, this is definitely the way to go, or else you'll be waiting in line like a sucker with everyone else

I wrote a review of this a few days ago, but it has apparently disappeared into the Internet's black hole of missing pages. My husband and I each had the brisket, and it beats just about any other brisket I've had. 蔍'm from Kentucky...land of the Moonlite B-B-Q Inn (world famous barbecue joint), so I know barbecue when I have it. 蔖ortions were generous, the brisket was melt-in-your-mouth tender, and the atmosphere was friendly. 蔅eware of the "family style" tables in the tiny restaurant, though. 蔠e got there around 6:30 on a Friday for dinner, and a line began to form soon after--so go early. Be warned: 蔵t was featured on the Food Network (we didn't know this), so a lot of the patrons are coming from that particular buzz. 蔠e actually saw the feature on when we got home from dinner. 蔋ow weird is that?

Um, wow...as I've said many, many reviews before, I come from Texas, so BBQ is something that's easy to screw up. 蔛o after watching Diners, Drive Ins and Dives, I was sold and couldn't wait until winter was over to take the car for a spin and go get some BBQ there! �We waited in line outside for about 30 minutes..and to think I actually considered turning around and leaving b/c I was starving! 蔜his place has it down. 蔍t was cracking me up the tourists taking pictures w/ the owner b/c he was on TV. 蔝m, no one actually know who that is, you know that right? 蔅ut he was super nice and checking on everyone. 蔜here was such limited space I was wondering if we should get it to go. 蔅ut it seemed like when someone was ready to sit - a seat was available. 蔝nfortunatley, it's family style seating and we got sat next to 4 older ladies talking about dirty glasses at a bar and some other stuff...SO not appetizing while you're eating! Now onto the food...it..was...phenomenal! 蔍 couldn't finish it all! 蔍 was trying SO hard to but I couldn't do it! 蔆hopped brisket sandwich on some yummy yummy bread...mmm...baked beans yum. 蔍 haven't had those in forever! 蔍 wish I could have had this peach cobbler everyone was talking about but I just couldn't eat another bite. 蔍 walked out so very happy and so sleepy from too much food. 蔍 can't wait to go back here and get some more - thank goodness it's not a walk away or I'd be in serious trouble!

This place was recommended by a friend that grew up in Oklahoma and spent some time in Texas. I also spent a year working in Dallas, and I'd like to say that it is a very representative version of Texas-style BBQ. I had a pulled pork platter, which came with an ample amount of pork. an extra side of sauce and 'slaw and 2 sides. The slaw was okay, but you may find that the two sides are a bit smaller than you may think. I had the mac and cheese, and the cornbread. Both were excellent, but a bit undersized considering you just forked over about 2 Lincolns. The pulled pork itself? Dee-licious! Soft, juicy and tender like it was meant to be, with a decent amount of sauce as well. There is ample seating space, and some parking within the neighborhood. If you happen to be there when the dental office next door is closed, you should be able to use the back (west of the building) parking lot as well. It can be a breeze to get to, if you take 90/94 to get here, since it's right of the Pulaski exit. A solid option, depending on where you live.

I went on a Tuesday night to avoid the crowds, who come with good reason! I tried the brisket platter, half sliced, half chopped with Fries and the cobbler. 蔈verything was excellent. 蔍f you leave without trying the cobbler, you shouldn't have come in the first place.

Brisket and pulled pork are good, but the ribs are heavenly. They use 11 spices in their rub to form the most amazing outer crust. Side bbq sauce is on point with champion bbq. If you like chili, the brisket chili will not dissapoint. Prices are pretty darn good (sandwiches $7, includes delicious slaw). A full slab of ribs is $17 (you'd pay $20 at famous daves). It does get crowded, but usually in spurts (not constant), but they have a very efficient system (one cashier, bunch of guys cooking, and they line the orders up on the counter). Even though seating can feel a little cramped, it's not bad considering the size of the building. If your still not convinced, watch the "diners drive-ins and dives" episode on youtube, the owner did his homework (traveled through austin and memphis to learn from the pros). If your anywhere near chicago, I can't recommend this restaurant enough.

The BBQ at Smoque was good, but nothing extraordinary. 蔕n the weekday afternoon I went, it wasn't overly crowded and took about 20 minutes from the time we stepped inside to the time we received our food (I was expecting an hour+ so I was pleasantly surprised). The pulled pork is soft and well bbqed and the meat from the ribs just fell off the bone. While I should probably remember the bbq from a BBQ joint, I don't. 蔍 remember the mac & cheese. 蔊et an order of the mac & cheese, then get an extra order because it's that delicious.

Finally had the pleasure to stop by here Sunday night! The negatives: Finding such an odd location and the parking can be difficult, and we had to wait about 30 minutes just to order and find seats. The location is extremely small, and I would definitely recommend ordering to go in order to avoid the seating hassle. The sides were OK, nothing out of this world. And since it was Sunday night, it was a little disappointing that there were no TVs for the football games. That would've complemented the ribs perfectly. The positives: Ordered the half slab of each: St. Louis and Babyback. I really liked their menu flexibility where you can add on ribs/brisket/other sides if you want to try something new. The prices were reasonable, and each order came with a substantial amount of food. The ribs were really tender and the brisket was scrumptious as well. I would recommend the brisket over the pulled pork sandwich, but they were both delicious so you can't go wrong.

If it was up to me Barbecue would be a part of the food pyramid or food groups. Because while it isn't vital for your body to have, it brings a great deal of joy. Because nothing is tastier than smoked meat falling apart due to the breaking down of connective tissue. I dare you to think of something, and guess what you can't. That's why America won the Cold War. And Smoque can give me those tasty smoked meats. Their St. Louis ribs and pulled pork are what stands out here. Sometimes there ribs are tough and shitty, but that's only happened once. The brisket, chicken, baby back ribs, and sides are all delicious as well. They just don't shine like the pulled pork does. If you get a take out order I would suggest asking for extra barbecue sauce, just because it's always good to have extra. Out of all the barbecue places that I've ate at in Chicago I would say that Smoque has the most consistent quality of smoked meats. And they have the best balance of delicious sauce and delicious meat. The only time they've let me down with the very tough St. Louis ribs. But that only happened once, so it's not a huge concern.

Woah nelly, this is some good bbq!!! The place was packed but it was a real orderly operation with a guy finding a table for you while you waited in line. So clever. I got the pulled pork sammich while Hubster had the chopped brisket. We both got mac 'n cheese as a side since we spied it at other tables and it looked great. Meat was superb and I am obviously echoing what everyone else has already said. Dy-no-mite! The mac 'n cheese was KILLER though, I wish I had ordered 3 more orders of it. That's the only reason I'm not giving 5 stars, the sides are too small! I loved the cute little individual portion aluminum cups the mac came in, going to have to try that at home!

We tried going to Kuma's last night but no way we were waiting two hours for a burger, so we hit this place up. It was a very pleasant surprise. It was no bullshit BBQ--I can dig that. They were out of a lot of things that late in the night, but pulled pork is good for me. It was really, really good. I'm no pulled pork expert but it made my tummy happy. On the side I had this tiny baked mac and cheese pastry cup. It was the cutest thing. I love mac 蔭nd cheese but I feel like whenever you order a side of it, its never that good. This one was delicious, with crumbs on top--and so cute! The coleslaw was also phenomenal. Lost of pepper and red onion really gave it that kick. We ordered our food at the counter and even though the place was jam packed, they sat us right away. A few minutes later we had our food. Even though the atmosphere is hectic (and there were other customers lingering around our table), someone came by to ask us if we needed anything else, how the food is, and then to clear the plates. I really have no complaints. Well, ok, it was a little drafty but I was totally fine. You have a silly name, Smoque, but you are kique ass!

I don't think I would have made it here without the help of my Dad's car...I do not have the patience for long long bus rides to the north side of the city nor for insanely long lines and table waits, combining those two things in one trip? Forget it. My Dad, his girlfriend, the little sis, and I hoped in my Dad's Jeep one evening and came here for dinner. It was around 6:30pm on a weeknight, and line was out the door. We nearly left and went somewhere else, but my Dad's girlfriend insisted that the food would be worth the wait. Finally we got inside and noticed that a guy was taking orders so that the line would move a little smoother and quicker. He was also nice enough to see to it that we would get a table(all of them were full) and get me a paper menu because my eyes were not allowing me to read the chalkboard menu. We finally made it up to pay, were kindly seated at a freshly cleaned table, and waited about fifteen minutes or so for our number to be called. I went with the half and half. Half pulled pork, and half brisket sandwich. For my side I got the Mac and Cheese. It also came with coleslaw. The pulled pork was tasty. Though It was a tad on the bland side, somehow the smoke didn't fully come out in the meat. The sauce helped to add some zing though. It was a tasty sauce, I really liked that it was a vinegar based BBQ because it had a nice tang to it. The brisket half was a whole other story. It was moist tender super smokey. Also had a different sauce. Still tangy but it had a little bite to it as well. The brisket was the clear winner. I ate all my coleslaw, I usually am not a fan of the stuff, but it was not a mayo based slaw. It was crisp tangy, slightly sweet. Yum. The mac and cheese was done very well, it was buttery creamy and cheesy. I just wish that the side had more than three bites in it! Also I got to sample a rib. Which was super flavorful and smokey, but not tender. To me they were kind of tough. They are dry rubbed with sauce on the side. The sauce with these was a little strange, It actually kinda reminded me of curry, which wasn't what I was expecting to taste. I sampled some BBQ beans as well. The smoke taste in the beans was a little overwhelming, not my thing. All in all there were a few things I enjoyed and a few I didn't so it adds up to an A-OK in my book.

My sense is that this place really picks up at the key dinner hours, but damn, if rollin' in around 5:30 PM on a Friday doesn't give you curbside access to the counter. 蔙olled in here for my second visit last week, with mummy and little bro in tow. 蔊iven that the last time I'd come to the spot was last August, and that visit did not disappoint, I figured it was time for a second go. �Additionally, the advice of fellow yelpers led me to believe that this joint was to be the best of both worlds, if the set of worlds under consideration are those that (1) serve some of the best macaroni and cheese in the city and (2) are kid friendly. 蔖oint (1) eliminates a good majority of spots, and (2) knocks Kuma's and Orbit Room out of the running for good (though who doesn't love getting tanked and listening to metal around children???) So it was that our weary trio ended up at Smoque, ordered two pulled pork sandwiches (wif frites pour moi, wif mac por mi madre), and an order of the kid's mac (which comes in a bigger foam bowl and sans the delicious--but decidedly adult--crusty topping. 蔜hree fountain sodas, pleeze. Took a seat (the fact that they have someone greet you, let you order, then seat you is a little weird, but is a necessary protocol for maintaining order when the place gets busier), and it didn't take long for our number to get called (maybe 5-7 minutes; they seemed to be filling a lot of carryout orders). 蔙an up, hooked up the grub. The verdicts? My pulled pork sammy was delicious, and hit the spot right where i wanted it. 蔇umped the coleslaw and the sauce on the sandwich, and was good to go. 蔄te the shit out of it. 蔍 really like the sauce; it's tangy and flavorful. 蔜ypically I'm all about the spicy-as-possible but I actually quite like the combo of meat-bread-slaw-sauce this sandwich delivers--no spice needed. 蔜he fries are greaaaaaaaaaat, too. 蔛ome day I'll try some of this Texas sausage, 'cause it sounds great. 蔒um liked her food too - tho she's generally easy to please. �The toughest critic was the 6 year old, who deemed the mac and cheese delicious, and wanted to know if I had any idea what the "secret ingredient" was in the mac and cheese. 蔍 ventured that it might be butter, and he agreed... until we had been there for a while, the mac and cheese got cold, and then his decree shifted from delicious to disgusting in one drop. 蔆an't please all the people all the time, I guess. Overall, a tasty spot when you get the urge for BBQ all up in your belly.

This is by far, the best BBQ I've had in my life. I ate every single thing we had on the plate! The first thing we had was the Memphis-Style Baby Rack Ribs which were amazing. Succulent in flavor, great crispy burnt texture on the outside, but soft tender meet you can bite off the bone on the inside. Next, the Sliced Brisket was so, so tender and every little bite had a burst of flavor. The outside was nice and burnt, crispy but the rest of the meat was so soft and juicy. I know I'm making all the Texas Rudy's BBQ fans cry by saying this, but I never liked the brisket there and therefore resigned in thinking I just didn't like BBQ. So in a way...Smoque has changed my (bbq) life. I loved the BBQ sauce as well, tangy and meshed well with the meat. Damn. I could swim in that sauce. The sides we ordered were the Mac & Cheese, Peach Cobbler, Coleslaw, and the Corn Bread. Where do I even start? The smalls were a bit too small, it's meant for one person but we ordered a lot of sides to share. I really enjoyed the Coleslaw because it wasn't your traditional Coleslaw - it's not made with mayo at all, instead it is made with a vinaigrette which helps to lighten up and balance the meal and the rest of the more heavier sides. Even the Mac & Chese wasn't that heavy though, just the right amount of cheese, not too much. No complaints about the Corn Bread. And lastly, the Peach Cobbler was the perfect ending to our meal. I don't even know how to describe it other than I've never had Peach Cobbler like that before. Besides the food, this place has no atmosphere. It's in a weird location, located off the beaten path in a small neighborhood. The service is good though. The line is ridiculous but if you go later, it's shorter. Smoque is definitely worth the wait though.

I'm Filipino so its an autonomic response to LOVE pork! and this place is a PORK holiday all day every day! I had the sliced brisket sandwich w a side of mac and cheese. It comes w a side of their special bbq sauce, and their mac and cheese has a creme broulee breaded concoction on the surface making the cheese crispy on top but the mac soft in the center w oozing goodness of dairy. I wasn't fairly hungry but as I sank my teeth into my 1st bite and the juices and meat touched the 1000s of taste buds on my tongue I became an animal. 蔣ou know when you're starving and you just stuff food in your face non-stop until you feel yourself and your stomach bulge out like a 3month old prego lady? Unfortunately I did that but caught myself 1/2 way so I could enjoy the sandwich more. I do have to go back there and sample everything else they have on the menu. 蔍ts inexpensive, the menu isn't that extensive and the location is perfect; doesn't get too crowded or noisy during rush hour!

It definitely was not the best bbq I've had. I tried the brisket sandwich and pulled pork platter. Both meat kinds were not flavorful and the sauce didn't make up for it. It was on the more watery and tangy side. The meat tasted boiled and then smoked. I will compliment the sides and service. The place had a busy, crowded, popular feel to it, but things were organized. You place your order at the register, someone comes and asks if you will need seats, you stand and wait until a seat opens up (they find seats for you), and then wait for your order to get called. Cole slaw was not creamy - which I liked. Mac&Cheese was the best! and cornbread was good- I just wish the portions for the sides were a little larger. Fries were delicious too.

Before coming to Smoque I heard epic tales of its succulent greatness. I'll be honest after trying it I am not that impressed. Perhaps it is because I am from Texas where BBQ is king or I think that when you throw down $10 you should be given more food than you can eat, but Smoque did not satisfy my expectations. I got the Brisket Platter with two sides. The first side which was Mac and Cheese was great. The second side of the day which was Brisket Chili was unimpressive. This was more soupy than it was chili and it didn't really have the smoked meat flavor permeating the item The brisket itself was average. The meat was tender, but not as flavorful as I would have liked. The smoked essence essential in BBQ was not evident. The BBQ sauce was watery and did not have anything distinctly special about it. All in all for BBQ in Chicago the meal was good, but for BBQ overall it just doesn't even come close to a place south of the Mason-Dixon line.

This place has great food, but I'm just not a huge fan of dry rub ribs. The rub is really tasty, the meat is so tender and crunchy...but I just prefer mine to be dipped in a vat of sauce before I eat them. Just my personal taste, but if you like dry rub, you will love love love it. My boyfriend gets the pulled pork sandwich and recently introduced it to a friend of ours, and now the both of them can't shut up about how great it is. This place is ALWAYS crowded though, so I'd suggest calling in way ahead of time. We were around on Saturday afternoon, called for pick-up at about 5pm, they said it wouldn't be ready till 6:30. When we got there, there was a line for people waiting to sit down that was out the door...and it was sleeting outside! I know Chicagoans are hardcore, but standing out in the freezing sleet with no umbrella just to get some ribs? You know this place has got to be good.

Did not steer me wrong. Finally got up there after hearing about this place for years..... My friend was told to order the chicken; I will absolutely return for that. I'd had the pulled pork and brisket at other venues (Jiucy Wine Co.) and enjoyed the pulled pork platter again. Special brisket chili last weekend was spot-on, esp. with a side of cornbread. I am not big on french fries, and they really grabbed me. Plenty of pepper (a must), nicely crisp, quite fond of those. Can't wait to go back with my p's who have seen this on various programs.

Hey Smoque - you still got it, baby!

And, apparently, it's not just beloved by us Midwesterners who, living north of the Mason-Dixon are often told they know jack about BBQ!

Best BBQ i've had in a long time, definitely within Chicago. I think we had everything on the menu last night: - St. Louis ribs: 蔭 good amount of fat, very smoky but I'd probably go for the baby backs next time; 蔮bq sauce is sweet and has a good amount of sour/tang. - Brisket - Pulled pork - Texas sausage - Sides: cornbread, baked mac n' cheese, mayo-less cole slaw, french fries, peach cobbler, brisket chili, beans - the sides were almost my favorite part of the meal; definitely get the cobbler, which is probably the best I've ever had, and I believe it was even made with canned peaches. Our party trickled in ~7pm on a Friday night and this place was just beginning to get completely packed, the line running out the door. 蔛taff is as friendly as can be, and helps to facilitate the line and counter to table self-serve and seating. 蔕pen view into the kitchen shows this place is spotless and a tightly run unit. 蔊otta love this place.

As I sit here writing this review, I can still smell the smoke and vinegar on my hands. 蔜his was, without a doubt, some of the best BBQ I have ever experienced. You must, MUST, go!!! Me and two of my friends arrived with some beers around 7:00pm on a Tuesday. 蔍t was lively, busy, and smelled incredible. 蔈verything is ordered off a large chalkboard and seats are assigned only after you plae your order at the counter. 蔍t's loud and cramped but I didn't mind one bit. 蔍f you do mind, then you don't belong there as you have missed the point of what Smoque is about. 蔠e're not there for the ambiance, you go for the food! I had the Brisket platter with slaw, baked beans, and fries. 蔋ands down, the best brisket I've ever had. 蔍f I had to pick my favorite part of the meal I would have to say the BBQ baked beans...they were unreal. 蔋uge smokey chunks of brisket could be found in almost every bite of the beans. Everything was so good that I got back in line to have the peach cobbler. 蔉olks, this was incredible food. 蔣ou must go. 蔍 will be back soon!

First of all, highfalutin restaurant owner -- learn to spell: the word 'smoke' doesn't have a Q. It doesn't have a U either. S-M-O-K-E Got it? Now we can get on to the BBQ. It's definitely tasty and tender and all you'd come to expect from seeing it on TV or in the myriad local magazine and newspaper articles. It lives up to its hype. I got a beef brisket sandwich with corn bread and coleslaw. The brisket was the star of the culinary show on my plate, and all I can really say is that it's good. Anything would be good after you smoke cook it for fifteen hours, I guess -- so this is actually above and beyond good. Hard to really say anything else about it. You just have to try it for yourself. Take confidence in knowing that I like BBQ, and this is a truly delicious specimen. I also liked the coleslaw. Normally I hate coleslaw. But at Smoque it is the tangy brother to the brisket. Also the cornbread is good. It's all good. Dining room's kind of small and like, 'blah'. I imagine you'd have hard luck going there for lunch rush. Food tops atmosphere and service, which is fine in a place like this -- but with a little more care to detail and service, it could be an astonishing place to eat BBQ. Right now it's just good. Just good. PRO TIP: If you plan on ordering fries, make sure you bring like twenty people to help you finish them. They give you lots of fries.

So I first start by saying I come from a mommy and daddy that both lived in South Carolina, St Louis, and a final destination of Kansas City. 蔠e are some bbq folks. I was super excited about smoque cuz it smelled so tasty and I've only heard great things. �Was I super duper impressed? nope Did I realize that the bbq sauce is tomato paste and A-1? yup Can the moms make better cornbread/beans/peach cobbler? yesiree The staff was attentive and friendly and I did see the owner running around, so all's good there. I will say that the boyfriend liked the pulled pork and the cole slaw.

I don't even see how this could be debatable. 蔛moque simply has the best BBQ in the City. �I live down the street from Smoke Daddy - and don't get me wrong, I love Smoke Daddy. 蔅ut sorry, no other place stacks up. I started coming to Smoque right when it opened, and while the food was always fantastic they had some service bugs to work out. �Last time I went with a group of six on a crowded Saturday. 蔛omehow, the guy had a table ready for us to sit by the time we made it through the line to order. 蔄ppears that those bugs have all been worked out now.

Pretty darn good, for a northern state's BBQ. 蔍 was battling myself on whether to give it a 3 or 4 stars. 蔍 think I hold BBQ joints to a much higher standard because it's just a crime to serve bad BBQ! Maybe because I know what Kansas City BBQ tastes like I may have a slight bias. 蔜here are so few BBQ joints up here, I had to give it a 4. �I ordered the half order of brisket sandwich with a side of slaw and baked beans. 蔜he brisket was fantastic! 蔞ery moist and tasty! 蔜he sauce was good, but seemed like it lacked something that would really give it a good kick. 蔜he slaw was bland and the beans were runny and a little under cooked. 蔇issapointing. I defiantly must make it up here again to try the pulled pork and ribs! 蕀mm.. mouth watering already.

First time my Hubby and I went to Chi-town and He insisted we head to Smoque after watching that feature on TripleD. I am SO glad we went... We took the blue line all the way to Irving Park. HANDS DOWN... Best BBQ ever!!!!! What we ordered: St. Louis Ribs, Baby Back Ribs, Coleslaw (came with ribs), fries, Mac&Cheese, Beans, and corn bread!!! St. Louis Ribs, Baby Back Ribs - BEST EVER! Seriously! My Hubby liked the BB's and I favored the St. L's. Sauce is AMAZING! I literally died it was so good. Coleslaw - so good and I actually felt healthy eating it. YUMMER! Mac&Cheese - I am sort of a M&C connoisseur and Smoque has the BEST BEST BEST EVER. I want to cry thinking that I have to come all the way back the Chi-town to get this heavenly experience. Beans- Hubby LOVED these.... He said they were the BEST he has had! Fries - Reminded me of FIVE GUYS... so delish! Cornbread - Perfect COMBO to top off the lovely meal with just a tiny hint of sweetness! LOVE LOVE LOVE this place.... Chicago, I'll definitely be back:) Thank you SMOQUE for being so perfect! P.S. It's BYOB, wish I knew that before I came!

Finally Chicago has a place that serves good BBQ. I am not your typical loud Texan, but I am from the state. Since I left Texas in 1998, I have not experienced good quality brisket outside of Texas. In addition, I have not had that great of pulled pork since my many wild nights in Memphis...problem solved again. I have no more worries, Barry Sorkin has solved my problems. Barry is not only a very gracious host, but also an expert smoker. Great job Barry....Kristin and I are going to have you cater our Rehersal Dinner. Next stop...a downtown location??????

The smell of BBQ wafting through the air gives me more than enough reason to grab a place at the end of the order line that is far outside the door. 15 minutes go by and the line is creeping s-l-o-w-l-y along, but I decide to stick it out. I see each customer get to the counter and take, what seems to be an eternity to place their order. It is a full 25 minutes before I finally make it to the register to place my order. And, so it goes... Me: "I'll have the brisket platter with beans and cornbread for the sides." Smoque (speaking in the drollest possible manner): "We are out of brisket." Me (mumbling under my breath): "Hmm, why didn't you tell me you were out of brisket before I recited my entire order? Me, again: "Okay, I'll have the chicken platter with beans and cornbread for the sides." Smoque: "We are out of chicken. Basically, all we have is baby-back ribs. We are out of everything else." Me: "Thanks for wasting my time!" as I walked out the door more than slightly pissed off. I am sure that every customer waiting in that long line experienced the same problem that I encountered when I finally got to the counter to place my order. I am sure that the baby-back ribs were great. But, I did not want baby-back ribs! And, I would have loved the opportunity to make that decision before Smoque wasted 25 MINUTES of my life waiting in their baby-back rib line. So, here is my restaurant management tip for Smoque: Somehow convey to your customers waiting in line what is and is not available, so they can make an informed decision on whether they want to wait in said line. 蔜hank you! The bottom line: great BBQ (for the northwest side of Chicago) but lousy customer service. I may go back, but I'll never wait in line again unless I know what is available to order.

The food at Smoque is EXCELLENT. 蔍 understand that the long lines, somewhat cramped (when crowded) confines, and the potential for running out of key menu items have the potential to detract from the overall experience (these are the only reasons I'm rating less than 5 stars). 蔋owever, food-wise, it's easy to see that all of the negative/mediocre reviews have been written by folks who are either inexperienced in BBQ (particularly the smoked kind) or hold a grudge against the place because of its popularity in the media, and were just looking for some aspect of the restaurant's service or aesthetics to rail against. As for my own opinion, let me just say that beef brisket is one of my favorite foods. 蔍've cooked it at home (using a recipe that requires 2 days to prepare), I order it frequently at Irish pubs ("corned beef" is almost always a brisket cut) and Jewish delis, and I have had the "real BBQ" brisket in Texas and other parts of the South -- not to mention many joints in Chicagoland and elsewhere. 蔜he brisket at Smoque was at least as good as any I've ever had! 蔛o good -- and so much more enjoyable because of how hard it is find it prepared this perfectly! 蔍've had plenty of dried-out and/or tasteless and/or overly fatty brisket in my life -- trust me, this is the real stuff, done right. I enjoyed the pulled pork as well -- I can't think of a better place for pulled pork in Chicago, but Smoque's version doesn't really stand out either. 蔍 think that's because pulled pork is a little easier than Brisket to get right (you can easily make a pretty decent "faux-smoked" version in any Chicago kitchen just by browning a big pork shoulder roast and then letting it cook all day in the slow-cooker, bathed in about half a bottle of Liquid Smoke -- no other liquid is necessary. 蔖ull it apart when you're done, and taste the goodness). As for the sides at Smoque, they were great too. 蔄s a Chicagoan I'm a sucker for fresh-cut fries and these were as good as I've had -- the "small" is a huge piping-hot bag, liberally seasoned with cracked pepper but not oversalted. 蔜he cornbread and mac-and-cheese were solid too -- very small "side" portions of each, but they were rich and tasty enough to make up for that. 蔍 personally don't like cole slaw but my wife enjoyed hers -- she doesn't like the kind slathered in mayo, but this was vinegar-based and hit the spot for her. UPDATE: As of my initial review I hadn't yet tried the ribs or chicken, but we just ordered carry-out last night and got to sample the St. Louis ribs and the smoked chicken. 蔅oth were out of this world good -- and now that I've tried both sauces I can say they're both wonderful. 蔜hus, despite any misgivings about the ambience of the restaurant, I am compelled to upgrade from 4 stars to 5 stars!

Smoque is good BBQ, don't get me wrong, but lets be honest, I think all the hype left me disappointed. Smoque appears as if it is a BBQ joint you would find in the Middle of Texas, such as the one on Friday Night Lights, but in my opinion the sauce was just not that great, and sauce makes or breaks the BBQ. The sauce is tangy, which I usually am a fan of but it detracted from the food. I did enjoy the brisket and sausage. I did not like the feeling like I was being pushed out by people hovering for a table although it slowed by the end of my meal. This understandable due to the size of the place. Overall decent prices but over rated. Good place for people who have not experienced real Texas style or Memphis BBQ. In my opinion Honkey Tonk BBQ in Pilsen is superior and much more authentic.

I was sitting in my cousin's room and he says "you wanna get some good barbeque?" as he sat on the computer. He was watching youtube videos of the Food Network (which I'm sure was in violation of strict copyright and redistributing laws) and showed me these raving reviews of this joint called Smoque. All the people were saying "this brisket is better than Mississippi" and whatnot. So, I thought myself if I get brisket at Smoque, then I can eliminate going to Mississippi. Really, there's no reason to go to Mississippi besides barbeque. So, I says "hell yeah,bro, let's get that brisket". I wasn't even that hungry, but I'm a fat glutton and love delicious food. We roll six deep over to Smoque. We go inside and there are bunch of scattered tables with no seating that could accommodate us six. Basically, two of us have to sit by the bathrooms, two of us by the windows and the last two sit by themselves one either side of an elderly Korean couple by the soda machine. They have a guy walking around trying to smoosh people together. Eating is my favorite social event and I can't talk about stupid things that happened at work or about girls I hooted at while driving, then what's the point of eating together? The other people in a restaurant don't want hear about women I yelled at today. No one is interested in that, especially not that elderly Korean couple. To say the least, I thought not being able to comfortably accommodate 30 people at one time is something most popular restaurants should be able to do. I don't think I'm being picky. It took me twenty or so minutes to get to the order taker girl. My five friends all went before me and all ordered this famous brisket I've been hearing so much about (from the youtube). I get up there and ask for the brisket platter. This girl told me they just ran out of brisket. I am completely bewildered as to how five people, and countless before us, ordered brisket with no problem. "Fine, you know what, let me get the pulled pork. I can't believe you ran out of brisket so abruptly, but that's fine. I'll just take the pork, it's fine. Whatever." No dice. The girl told me they just ran out of pork as well. Smoque has four different things: chicken, ribs, brisket and pork, and they just ran out of two of those four things. This girl said that she could take my money and if somehow they find brisket, they could give it to me. I said I didn't want anything else based on principle. Restaurants shouldn't run out of half of their types of food. It's like going to McDonald's and they didn't have any more hamburgers or any sort. I don't want chicken McNuggets (metaphorically), I want some damn brisket (literally). I know what you're thinking, they turned me down because I'm ugly. Not true as I am quite handsome. Apparently, handsome doesn't get you brisket in this town anymore. So, I sat there, pretty hungry and with no food on my non-plate. My friends all pitied me, offering me some of their food. I had a taste of their brisket (it was aight) and some of their fries (mostly aight). There was mac and cheese that was disgusting and coleslaw that looked like it was made by a chef with no hands. The owner or some self-important guy with a belt clip cell phone and zubaz pants walking around the twenty square feet of dining area asking how everything was going. I think he knew better than to ask me because I would let him have it. I saved the thirteen some odd dollars I would have spent on something I never wanted to eat that wouldn't have been good anyway and spent a third of that on some awesome Wendy's. If I could give Smoque one fourth of a star, I so would. Love, Marvin P.S. It was all white people working there. What do white people know about barbeque anyway?

I willingly drive 50 minutes (that's w/o traffic) to eat here. I rarely eat BBQ anywhere else in Chicagoland. The brisket more than lives up to the hype. I recommend getting the sandwich with BOTH sliced and chopped meat on it. The fries are fresh and a good side, but the smoked beans take this place over the top. Chunks of brisket, onions, and a plenty of sugar make these beans the best I have ever had. The pulled pork is fine, not phenomenal. The St. Louis ribs are always tender and meaty; I prefer them to baby backs. And the peach cobbler with the warm almond streusel topping for 2 bucks is a great capper to the meal.

I'm passionate about meat, and I appreciate places that have that same passion. This is hands down my favorite restaurant in Chicago, and for my money it's the best barbeque in Chicago. First thing you notice when you go in is the smell. I almost already know if a place is going to be good by the smell. The place is permeated with the sweet aroma of barbeque. Must Have Brisket. Sliced. Not chopped, b/c sliced is the fattier cut. St. Louis-style ribs. Dry rub, meatier than the baby-backs, $1 cheaper. BBQ Beans. Smoked, with bits of brisket and onion in them. The best beans I've had...pretty much anywhere. Pulled Pork. The first time I went I was disappointed, but I must have been expecting something other worldly because on repeat visits, I've come to appreciate the tender delicateness of the pork. Make sure you get the vinegar-based bbq sauce for the brisket and the ketchup-base bbq sauce for the ribs. They should give it to you without asking, but last time I was there they forgot one. Solid French Fries. Fresh-cut, crisp, well-seasoned fries. They give you so much, though, that it can detract from the meat. Recommend share one with someone else. Cole-slaw. Vinegar based. Cleanses the palate decently, and is so straightforward, doesn't try to pretend to be something fancy. Mac'n Cheese. Great taste, though it's a really small portion. (I'm clearly not refined in my mac'n cheese taste buds) Whatever Smoked sausage. Genuinely disappointed. They taste like they could've come from the grocery store. Haven't tried Baby-Back ribs. Seriously, why would I get baby backs when I can get one-of-a-kind (in Chicago of course) beautiful dry rubs? Brisket Chilli. Peach cobbler. Looks like a small portion, but I've heard good things about it. Anything else not listed Recommended meal(s) Listed in order of hunger and descending price (I think) Brisket Platter with a taste of St. Louis ribs. Sides: BBQ Beans and fries (to be shared with someone else). Brisket Sandwich with a taste of St. Louis ribs. Side: BBQ Beans For an emphasis on the ribs, switch the St. Louis ribs and the brisket (you get a half slab of ribs with a taste of brisket, etc). Yeah, this list is shorter than I thought it'd be. :D Go early if you can, later if you can stand the wait, late if you can stand them running out of meat. Let me know how your experiences have been/your recommendations!

For a place known for their BBQ, I enjoyed the Peach Cobbler and the Mac N' Cheese the most. 蔜he Mac as the best I have ever had and the Peach Cobbler was the perfect desert. 蔍 was very excited to come to Smoque, I have been trying to get here for a while. 蔋owever, I have to say I was a bit let down. 蔜he sauce was good, but not as good as some of the more famous places in Chicago and the 'burbs. 蔜he chopped brisket was good, but I wish I had noticed the 1/2 and 1/2 (meaning combining any of their sandwiches to get a 1/2 of one and 1/2 of another). 蔍 love both brisket and BBQ pork, so I would liked to have tried both. My wife loved her baby backs and the cornbread, I loved that the Cole slaw wasn't creamy and the beans were just average. �I love that its a locally owned place from new restaurateurs. 蔍 will definitely be back to try some other dishes and really want them to succeed.

We waited in the line outside the door in the pouring rain. The added humidity only enhanced the luscious BBQ perfume emanating from this decidedly small, un-fancy building known as Smoque. While long, the line moved frequently, at least a little. When we finally ordered, a guy found us a table and we sat and waited for our number to be called. Seating is heavily communal; if you aren't comfortable with coming close to bumping elbows with another fan of great BBQ, go elsewhere. My companion and I were sat next to 2 Harley bikers and 2 old ladies, both pairs of whom had been coming to Smoque for years. We got the brisket and the chicken, with a side of the pulled pork for good measure. While I don't often eat gut-busting loads of BBQ...I totally would at this place, every day of the week, if I could get away with it. Delicious, perfectly prepared. The meat truly is the star of the show here; any sauce a modest second player. �Darned fine stuff. You should go.

Smoque sits somewhere up with Maurice's and Gate's and far above Hecky's, Robinson's, and Smokin' Woody's/Calvins. The only Chicago rival has been Honey 1. The word is out though as the line was nearly outside at 5:30 PM on Friday. Smoque is one of the few BBQ joints north of KC that doesn't hide its meat in liters of sauce. The Baby Backs were very good, but the prize is the St. Louis Rack. The ribs are rubbed well and perfectly cooked. The brisket was buttery and tender. The sides are very good. I recommend the beans and the mac and cheese. Additionally, it is BYO. So bring a little Shiner.

I had the 1/2 and 1/2 sandwich platter. �/2 pulled pork and 1/2 chopped brisket with beans and slaw. 蔜he meat was dry. 蔅oth of them. 蔈ither they were cooked to death or they sat in a warming tray for a long time and we got the end of lunch service. 蔜he beans were really tasty. 蔜he slaw was good, vinegar style, I like it. 蔒y friend had the 1/2 and 1/2 ribs. �/2 St. Louis and 1/2 Baby Back. 蔜hey were okay. 蔍 liked that they weren't cooked to death and falling off the bone, they still had some structure to them. 蔜hey were tasty, but I've had way better. 蔋e had beans, slaw and mac & cheese. 蔜he mac and cheese was ok, but not my fave. �Overall, the service was really great, the people were nice and it's a typical BBQ atmosphere. 蔍 love BBQ, but being raised in the south, I think I have a pretty high standard. 蔜hink I'll pass on visiting Smoque again.

I haven't been this pleased with BBQ in a LONG time! 蔍 took my boyfriend (originally from Kansas City) there for his birthday last night, and it was truly the gift that keeps on giving: a new favorite BBQ place! �I love that this place follows the rule of �Nothing to Hide, Sauce on the Side" and they do it well. I will admit, the portions of the sides (cornbread instead of slaw and mac & cheese) were small but tasted really good, and the fries were good & plenty of them. 蔅YOB - love it! 蔆an't wait to try their sandwiches!

Three words: PULLED PORK PLATTER. I couldn't finish it by any means, but let me tell you, with tasty fixings like pulled pork drizzled in sweet BBQ sauce, cornbread, baked macaroni and cheese, and warm peach cobbler, you better believe I tried my mother effing best. OH MY GOD. OH. MY. GAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHWWD. And now for the review: Seriously, let me start first by saying that damn, this place is super efficient. As soon as we walked in we were greeted and informed that upon ordering we'd then be seated. So it's 6:30 on a Friday night and there's a manageable line in front of us, okay, no big deal. I ordered the Pulled Pork Platter and my boyfriend got the brisket platter. When we placed our order we moved to the side and were seated right away. Seating here is communal so you're literally sitting quite closely to the other patrons who (hopefully) aren't gnawing on the tasty BBQ -- but if they are, you can't really blame them. Within about 5 minutes our number was called and we grabbed our food. I was not prepared for what happened next. Wow. Just wow. My pulled pork (enough to serve 2) was mouthwatering. It was perfectly cooked and also came with a side of extra BBQ sauce (included with the order). The baked mac and cheese was crunchy on top and melted inside. The cornbread was the best though, quite possibly the best comfort food, better than your mom could make it, trust me. I got the peach cobbler as one of my sides (yes, amazingly I had room for dessert)....the perfect ending to the perfect meal. No complaints whatsoever. OH! My boyfriend's sides included cole slaw - I absolutely despise cole slaw but here they make it almost sour - just cabbage, onion and vinegar, it was great in between bites, really crisp and cleansed the pallet. When we finished eating, someone offered to take our plates and the next couple was seated. They clean tables immediately after every meal before seating whomever is next so it's super clean and efficient. The line may look long (and sometimes out the door) but they are eager to get you seated in a timely manner. I'll be back!

Probably the best smoked brisket and pork in the City. 蔣ou can go to white table cloth restaurants in the city and pay 50% more than this plainly designed smokehouse. 蔅ut you will not come close to the quality of food that they put out. 蔍f there is a line inside, dont worry, 蔜hey move fast.

Half Sliced brisket and Half Pulled Pork with coleslaw and fries (sometimes the beans). 蔜he slaw isn't for everyone, I'll give you that, but I like it and I'm writing the review. 蔜he beans are also different than you might expect, but again, that's why I like 'em. My wife is a vegetarian and is always willing to go to Smoque for the salad. 蔣es, it's a fairly plain salad, but their vinaigrette dressing is excellent. 蔛he also gets the Mac & Cheese, which is great. 蔠e both love the fries. It's probably not the best BBQ in Chicago, and I'll admit I haven't tried all the places you should probably go first. 蔅ut if you're in the 'hood, this is easily one of the best places to go for a meal.

I saw this place on the Food Network channel about a year ago and decided since I was in Chicago I would check it out. After a week long marriage to deep dish pizza, I decided that on my last day in Chicago I would check this place out. I'm not a huge BBQ fan and we don't have a lot of good BBQ in Los Angeles, but I was really impressed with this place. The brisket I had was awesome, it was flavorful and juicy and the sauce was so good, I could drink it. It had a good amount of vinegar in it. I love vinegar. Anyhow, I'd gladly return to Smoque and as far as BBQ goes, it's far better than any BBQ I've eaten in Los Angeles.

So, my past review of Smoque got me thinking it was time to revisit, and yup, it was just as good! Full slab of back ribs was a little heavy on the rub, but I still loved it. 蔜he beans were great with nice chunks of meat and onion. 蔜hen, my only deviation was trying their brisket chili. 蔍t was pretty good, but definitely not as good as other options. Still, definitely fantastic ribs and BBQ in general. 蔜his place has really nailed it.

I love BBQ. I need it. Sometimes, I wake up in the morning and I want ribs. I haven't smelled ribs, I haven't had ribs in forever, I just wake up with this gut feeling that tells me-hey, you need some damn ribs in your life. It doesn't happen often, but when it does, I need some BBQ in my belly. Maybe it's because I lived in Texas those two years of my life, I don't know. I had been meaning to try Smoque but was terrified of the long lines that I heard about. If there's one thing that I don't like, it's waiting for food when I'm hungry. I get grouchy, I get mean, I get-well, we just don't need to see me when I'm too hungry. So once upon a saturday, me and the bf woke up early to go and get BBQ. We got there around 11:45; no wait in line at all for us! I was excited! But I didn't know what to get. And there wasn't a combo platter, OH NOES. I wanted to try everything. So. I kind of did. I got a half slab of the St. Louis ribs and a side of brisket. My lovely boyfriend was so kind to get the pulled pork sandwich, so I got to try some of his as well. Everything was delicious. I don't know what brisket these other people are eating, but mine was quite tender and not dry at all. The ribs had the nice pull to them that you expect from St. Louis ribs, and I really appreciate the fact that you get different sauces for different meats. A-plus. So that was Saturday. Then Tuesday rolls around, and my boyfriend offers to pick up Smoque again for dinner. BBQ and Lost? Who can say no. This time, I got the pulled pork sandwich and a side of the sausage.We also split another half slab of St. Louis ribs. I loved the bread that it came on, I felt that it didn't soak up all of the bbq sauce and let it marinate on down into the meat. The sausage was wonderfully smokey with a hint of spice in the background. I wish it was a little spicier, but I think that's because I love hot links. I'm really only giving it four stars because I think their sides could be a little better. I enjoy the mac and cheese, but it doesn't blow me out of the water and there aren't enough vegetable options. Like, hello? I could be eating some greens with my ribs. All in all, of course I'll be back when that craving hits me. I'm sure it will be soon enough.

Smoque catered our Holiday kickoff party and I was blown away! I had no idea that scrumptious beef brisket was available north of Kentucky! Our selection for the event was pretty basic, but sometimes that's all we need! -Beef Brisket (tender, flavorful, just the right amount of smoke flavoring) -Pulled Pork (moist and not over pulled) -Macaroni & Cheese (Cheesy, rich, and distinctive home made flavor) -Individual Corn Cakes (each caked was baked in it's own tin cup with a slight sweetness from the whole kernel corn) -Cole Slaw/Salad (basic, simple and complimented the rest of the meal) Delightful! I'm craving it right now as I'm typing!

We have gotten smoque catered for my work 3 times now, so I have sampled just about their entire menu. Being not the biggest fan of bbq, I was shocked to say that I absolutely loved it...the pulled pork and brisket are AWESOME. The brisket has that char on the outside but is tender on the inside, and the pork pulls part and is nice and charred with different textures. The babyback ribs weren't' as a big a hit w/the crew...I can't handle meat on the bone, so passed on that. Corn muffins come in individual tins and have whole pieces of corn interspersed. Coleslaw isn't my thing, but it is mayo-free. The mac n cheese tastes deliciously terrible for you and it's impossible to stop eating. Great baked beans, and sweet, smooshy 2 hand rolls make this place a great place to add to the list. I can't speak to the interior, but if they can cater food in mass quantities to be that tasty, I imagine on an individual basis it's even better.

Fast-food BBQ - Just be warned!! The food is decent but nothing to write home about. Sauce has a good taste and I thought the brisket was the best item on the menu. It was really tender and had the right amount of sauce. Don't get the bread - it is uncessary calories. You feel pretty gross after you eat for several reasons: the seating is smooshed together, the food is greasy and obviously bad for you, and the place seems a bit...dirty. Sorry to say. Parking is a big annoying too cause it is on a main street with lots of no-parking signs. The price isn't bad, but again it is fast food for sure.

I realize I'm in the minority here, but I swear, I've had better cole slaw at KFC & pulled pork at bars. Everything tasted either too bland or overpoweringly of smoke. Their sauce was too thin, too sweet and did have way too much cumin in it, as someone else mentioned. Everything's too pricey for what it is, too. To be fair, I DO pretty much dislike most things ~American~ so my palette may have adjusted accordingly... But perhaps my displeasure with our culture began with the cuisine... Who knows! All I know is that I won't be back here again. Sorry, Smoque. Next time I'm craving BBQ flavors, I'll just dump some Sweet Baby Ray's on something.

We went to Chicago for the weekend and was hoping to try some good food. All weekend time after time we were disappointed. We were actually going to Hot Doug"s but they were closed and ended up at Smoque's which was a pleasant surprise. We came right before the rush. The staff was very professional. It was our first time there and they clearly answered all our questions about the menu. The plate sizes are very generous. Everything tasted great. We had leftovers which we ate 4 hours later cold at the airport and it was still good. The only complaint: they should give different flavor of bbq sauce.

This place is definitely 5 star worthy but i can't do it because of the wait to place my order. So far I've had the chicken, pulled pork, brisket chili (side dish), mac and cheese, fries, and a few others I can't remember right now. It's ALL amazing!! The atmosphere is that of a bunch of people who love barbeque in a cafeteria and the occasional screech of someone behind the counter when another order is up. Something that helps the wait in line is to sneak a beer in while waiting. It's BYOB and I love that. You can ask for a wine key when you order our food. The last time I went with my beautiful wife we had a scare that they were running out of chicken. My father in law ordered the last one!! Just be aware that does happen and you may have to order something you weren't planning on. If the party of four in front of us didn't leave one of us in our party wouldn't have had our chicken. Bottom line: Great BBQ and it's cheap as hell.

This is the point where I wish Yelp offered half stars....because if they did, I would give Smoque 4 and a half enthusiastic thumbs up. 蔅ut, being from Texas and knowing the true definition of authentic bbq, I just can't give it 5 stars. However, the one feeling I had after last night's last minute decision to venture to Smoque was...when's the next time we're going??? 蔠e happened to stumble in there at the right time...because as we sat down, we looked up and all of a sudden the line was out the door. 蔜hank goodness for good timing, because I was starving! The fiance and I split a half chicken, brisket (sliced, not chopped), cornbread, mac and cheese, and cole slaw. 蔍 am a brisket fanatic, but I have to say, I thought the chicken was even better. 蔈verything was really delicious. One small downside...and it's really only because, as my fiance says, I don't like people...they pack you in to these tables, and we were seated across from each other, but pretty much packed in like sardines with a people on either side. 蔄t first, I was a bit uncomfortable, as though I were eavesdropping on these other tables...but once the food came, I was so engrossed in the delicious meal, I hardly even noticed anyone else was even there.

Best Brisket In Chicago!!!!! I learned about smoked brisket when living in Oklahoma, and haven't had one since that was as good as Mahylon's in Muskogee. 蔔ow I've found it. 蔜he fries are also fantastic, and the slaw is top notch. 蔉iancee likes the Mac & Cheese, and it's BYOB, which is always nice. Loses one star for ambiance. 蔜he space is about as interesting as a McDonald's, and it's always crowded. 蔜hey could have used twice the space. 蔜hey also tend to run out of brisket pretty early on busy nights, which is a bummer when you have a craving.

Best brisket in Chicago--hands down. Small location with a line outside by Noon on the weekends. But it's worth the wait! Slow-cooked brisket that barely stays together when picking up with your fork. Which is a lesson folks...USE YOUR HANDS!!! Get sloppy, it's BBQ! The ribs are tender with a nice smoke ring, but I'm sure you can find others in Chicago with similar taste. If you want what they're good at, stick with the brisket. Also, the sides are tasty as well. The baked beans actually have brisket trimmings in them. The peach cobbler is a sweet and crunchy treat as well. Last time I went, I bought the meat by the pound and am savoring pieces in my fridge like gold. Ha.

I went for the first time last night after seeing that it was on DD&D and only a ten minute drive from me. I've always envied Guy's job so I figured I could pretend to be him for a night. I get there at eight pm on a Tuesday night, and the place was packed! I waited in line for about ten minutes and got my food ten minutes later. I took it to go since there was no seats. I got the pulled-pork sandwich and my boyfriend got the beef brisket sandwich, which we split half and half. We got two cole slaws and BBQ baked beans and their brisket chili. Let me just say this..WOW! Their BBQ sauce was tangy and a bit watery but it was something I never had before. Definitely very flavorful. I used to not be a fan of beef brisket until I had theirs. It was definitely tender and nicely charred. The beans had this intense smokey flavor and the chili was sooooo good. I can't wait to go back for the ribs. Not to the mention the prices were just right too for such good food.

I went to Smoque on a work lunch trip with a vendor and was amazed at how packed the place was. It was kind of ridiculous. Good thing we had reserved a table! The line was very long and the wait was somewhat agonizing, since the aroma of brisket and pulled pork wafted everywhere and I was starving! Finally, we were served our food. We were cramped at the table, literally rubbing shoulders with each other, but that didn't matter so much to me, the food was excellent. I ordered the pulled pork sandwich and it was very good. Came with fries and cole slaw. I only wish this place was less chaotic. That's the only thing that keeps me from going there again soon. But believe you me, I will return there again some time because frankly, the food is GREAT.

A friend treated me to this place last week and I think I may make him my bestie just for this trip alone. I went from his recommendation and got the brisket with a side of french fries and macaroni and cheese. The platter comes with coleslaw already. The brisket was like BUTTER BABY. So, tender..very flavorful 蔭nd delicious. I barely had to slice it. The sauce they pour over it was tasty although not as sweet or tangy as I prefer BBQ sauces to be but still very good. The coleslaw was good, they use a vinaigrette dressing I think. I like that its not a traditional mayo slaw. The mac and cheese was inspiring. I want to figure out what cheese they used and how they made it so creamy and cheesy. Fries were crispy and a great compliment to the meat. They give you so much food that I suggest going on an empty stomach or being prepared to take food back home for later. Dessert: Peach Cobbler!! The topping is crispy and almost like a baked granola that you have to break to get to the fresh tangy peaches and sweet cobbler beneath. It was very good! All three of us at the table was tasting and trying to dissect the ingredients. & I like the location because its so inconspicuous. I guess thats Chicago for you too though. It's nestled in a mostly residential neighborhood and a fairly quiet spot. The resteraunt itself was packed on a Sunday afternoon. It's not a huge place but its obvious that business is going well. It's also a nice family friendly spot. Many of the tables were filled with families eating Sunday dinner. I am definitely going back one day soon to try more things on the menu.

The bbq here is really good. 蔍 got the sliced brisket platter with a side of mac and a side of fries. 蔜he brisket was saucy and very tender - almost too tender, verging on stewed. 蔜he mac, though tasty, was too small of a serving to be satisfying. 蔜he serving of fries was a good size, and the fries were delicious - skin-on and cut not too thick/thin. 蔊reat cole slaw - I dislike the normal mayonnaise variety, but Smoque's was tangy and refreshing with absolutely no mayo. The pulled pork was also good, and, to my undiscerning palate, tasted very similar to the brisket. 蔛t Louis ribs were good and smoky as well, but served with the same sauce (though thicker) as the other bbq-ed meats. Laid-back atmosphere. 蔊ood food, decent prices. 蔍f the meat held up a bit better or were a little more distinguishable across mammals, maybe it could warrant an extra star.

As a vegetarian of over a decade, I do not recommend a lot of meat. Smoque gets my top recommendation....I wish I had a plate of it in front of me right now!!! Side story that totally won my heart: My husband and I return from out of town, looking at the GPS for nearby restaurants for over an hour without luck. Smoque comes up in the cue.....we're reminded of how many of our friends talk about this (Thanks JD below for reminding me to review Smoque!!!) We go and they're sold out. No luck, no joy. I'm waiting for my husband to use the restroom and a manager walks by and starts talking with me. He hears the situation and sneaks us two plates from a catering order!!! We stealthily ate an AMAZING beef brisket plate and were so thankful for it!!!

Smoque is a fairly tiny BBQ joint with a line out the door. 蔍t's good, but not exactly worth the trouble unless you can sneak in when it's not crowded. I arrived late on a Saturday night and my check of Yelp definitely let me know what to expect. 蔍t took maybe a half-hour to get to the register to order. �I didn't understand why so many large groups had shown up to eat. 蔍n a packed zoo like Smoque, bringing the entire Von Trapp family doesn't make sense. 蔄nd while it's nice to have a good post-meal conversation, maybe you want to skip it when there is a teeming swarm of people who wish they could sit down. *This is not a restaurant for large groups.* If you want your entire biker gang/graduating class/Mormon Tabernacle Choir to enjoy Smoque, might I suggest getting it to go and having it in your crime den/school gym/rehearsal hall. (A sign on the wall says occupancy by more than 45 people is unlawful and dangerous. �5. 蔜here were easily 100 people there if you include the line out the door.) We ordered a sliced brisket platter with cornbread and fries and a full rack of baby back ribs with beans and mac & cheese. 蔖each cobbler on the side. The brisket was good, but not amazing. 蔜he ribs are definitely charred, so hopefully you like that going in. 蔍 preferred the thicker rib sauce to the more watery brisket sauce. As far as the sides, I loved the cornbread and fries. 蔅ig fan of the zesty slaw. 蔜he cobbler was good. 蔠asn't a fan of the beans, but I never order them for myself. 蔄nd I wish the mac & cheese were creamier. 蔍t was kind of chunky/gritty? I liked Smoque, but I didn't love it. 蔍f I have to stand outside at a restaurant and wait for a tiny, loud table, the food better leave me licking the plate. For future BBQ fixes, I'll stay closer to home and hit Twin Anchors.

The brisket gets five stars and is worth waiting a half hour in line for. 蔜he sides are kind of overpriced for the portion size, but decent. 蔜he place is small so there is not enough room for everyone to eat in, but if there's enough people working then a person will survey the line and try to make sure everyone gets a place to sit by the time they get their food. I'd like to stress again that the brisket is really really good. 蔒y bf says the ribs are only ok, and he feels the same way about the sauce. 蔍 don't like change so I stick with the brisket and it is really really good.

The best BBQ I've had in Chicago. But the place is way too small for the crowd it draws - we ordered but had to wait for almost 20 minutes to sit down! The ribs were just right - crusty on the outside but juicy and tender. The pulled pork didn't have as much flavor as I wanted to see, but the "Texas sausage" was excellent. I didn't think the much-heralded mac n cheese lived up to expectations, but the vinegary cole slaw was out of this world. The sauce was good, but I would've liked a variety - sometimes I like sweet, sometimes spicy, etc. In other words, Smoque is very good for the city but a mixed bag overall. If you want some SERIOUS 'cue and are willing to drive for an hour and a half to get it, Charlie's Piggin' N Grinnin' in Benton Harbor, MI. Charlie McGee is a world-class multi-state BBQ champion and knows how to do a pig right. Plus, his four sauces (regular/sweet, hot, tangy and may-based) are all phenomenal. Anyway, not sure when I'll be back to Irving Park for BBQ again, but I wouldn't mind the 15 minute drive for Smoque.

I only tried the brisket but it was incredible on a really warm Chicago October night with great friends. Others commented on how good the pulled pork sandwich and the mac and cheese were. Prices are reasonable. Any time I come back to Chicago I'm planning on going back to Smoque!

I've been craving bbq for a while and Smoque was the perfect remedy when I went there this past Saturday. I had a chopped brisket sandwich with a side of mac 'n cheese. The brisket was divine--tender, juicy, and oh-so full of flavor. And it was BIG, which I'm grateful for because that day I felt like a pregnant woman in July, craving a side of beef. The mac 'n cheese was excellent. I do, however, wish they offered a little bit larger size than the dixie cup-size that accompanied my meal. I do have two *teensy-weensy* complaints, though...if you would even call them "complaints"....more like "future suggestions". When I go to a bbq joint, I expect it to be a true "meat & threes" place. At Smoque, you can only pick one side and then you have to choke down the free celery salt-induced coleslaw (grody for me because i hate celery). You don't even get free cornbread or johnny cakes! Give a girl her cornbread, fer chrissakes! 蔅UT, their are sides are cheap, so paying an additional buck-nineteen or whatever isn't bad at all. Also, it gets rather crowded after 6 and then it seems like the staff kind of loses control and everything suffers. It takes longer to order, it takes longer to receive your food, and some of those elderly yuppy customers living along Pulaski can get BITCH-AY standing in line when they don't get their food right away! It might even help if they add another desserts to their menu. But who knows, maybe the peach cobbler is so spectacular, they don't need another sweet.

I actually heard about this place from my uncle in California. 蔍 think this place was on the food channel. 蔈veryone was excited to try the famous north side BBQ joint. �Things you should keep in mind- this is a small crowded restaurant so it is best to carry out your food and order ahead by phone. �The beef brisket is great- tender and comes with their own secret sauce (ok that sounded bad but you know what I mean). �The chicken is tender and delicious and comes with a special BBQ sauce (all of the sauces are different). The BBQ beans were nothing special, the coleslaw was ok- its vinegar based and could use more flavor. 蔜he best side that we tried was the cornbread- they are cornbread muffins. 蔜ruthfully I can make better cornbread but this was decent. �Another note- you can order brisket by the pound which is probably your best option. 蔍 would skip the sides and come for the meat... call ahead and take you BBQ to go.

I don't know what all the hype about this place is. Although I have to admit, a BBQ place in the vicinity is not really to be found, and I do like that it is in the neighborhood. But seriously the food was just "okay". I gave it 3 stars because I only went there once and had experienced only a small part of the menu. I have an open mind, and I will go again....my ratings could change after another time there. I don't care about how the seating is and the crowds, I'm used to it at about any popular place in Chicago. My gripe was that for all the hype, I expected some kick butt ribs. I orderd a chopped brisket sandwich with mac n cheese. The brisket was OKAY. I didn't really care of the stale type of bread, and I didn't like the taste of the sandwich sauce. Although decent, my palete craved a different taste. I LOVED the mac n Cheese however. Very Very good. I added on a 1/4 slab of st. louis ribs. DRY, NASTY, NOT MEATY at all. I know there are two different kinds...but seriously bad. My daughter who loves bbq and ribs of all sorts.....stuck her nose up to these doozys and ate frenchfries for dinner that night. I don't care for the excesive tartness of the BBQ sauce either. I know everyone has different tastes for BBQ. I guess I am spoiled by Famous Daves which I adore. I would rather take the drive to Berwym to eat at Famous Daves, than eat at Smoquee again. With that said, like I mentioned before, I am willing to give it another try. I'll do a follow up post when I do.

I feel like I've done a good deed. I brought back food from Smoque to my co-workers. They LOVED it!!! Could not stop hearing raves about it. Pulled pork, brisket, ribs, mac n cheese, PEACH COBBLER!!!!! I've had cobbler only a few times in my life, this by far is the best I've had. 蔈ncrusted with bits of slice almonds, sweet sugary crust and a caramel like filling w/bit sized peaches. I'm glad they only serve it in little portions or I may have gone well over my alotted amount of cobbler!!!

MeatFest!! YUUuUum! I love meat. After a 6 hour bike ride, we were super excited to check out Smoque. We were on Pulaski and we turned the corner and saw a HUUUUGE line on the side of the building. Doh! Luckily we were determined. Some people left the lines bc they were sick of waiting. BooHoo... The line moved fairly quickly. We ordered a full slab of the St. Louis style ribs, the brisket platter, and a taste of pulled pork. The pulled pork was freaking amazing. It was so tender and flavorful. This is definitely the best pulled pork EVER!! The brisket was also good, but not as good at as the pulled pork. The ribs had a great smokey flavor.

Good 'ol Southern Cookin! Very popular place and for good reason. Great bbq sauce and very tender meat. Menu is short and sweet, but you can't go wrong! Ribs are my favorite! The cornbread, macaroni and cheese, and peach cobbler are the best sides. Cole slaw is vinegar based and the beans are...well, beans! :) 蔖erfect bbq place, but the food does add up money-wise! TIP: CALL AHEAD for take out. There's usually always a long line so if you call ahead you get to skip to the front of the line when you arrive to pick up (pissing everyone else off!) 蔆learly not a genius idea, but you'd be surprised how many people wait in line when they could have been in and out in 5 minutes if they had just called ahead.

I made my first trip to Smoque in the middle of a lazy Sunday afternoon. 蔄 nice drive on a 50 some odd degree sunny day with the windows down definitely set the mood. 蔠e found parking easily on the street just west of Pulaski. 蔜he air on the walk over was infused with the barbecue flavor; it was then that I wished I was able to take a picture of an odor. Walking in the line was backed up to the door. 蔉or a place so popular, I was not surprised. 蔍 was, however, surprised at the size of the interior. 蔍 figured for a place so popular they needed more room! 蔐uckily they have an employee who's seemingly only job is to coordinate seating for customers. �The line moved smoothly, the owner conversing and joking with his patrons. 蔕ur turn to order and we dropped our $20 and were politely guided to where we were to sit. 蔄fter about 10 minutes sipping my orange Fanta, our order was up and ready to consume. �My chopped briscuit was piled high and deep on two rich pieces of bread, so I trimmed down the mountain of meat using my fork. 蔍 felt bad when I eventually dipped the morsels in the side of BBQ sauce, because the meat tasted fantastic without it....but I craved more flavor! 蔜he mac and cheese was just a bit too cheesy for me but what the heck, I made quick work of that as well. Overall, this establishment did an A+ job of accommodating the vast number of customers in such a confined space. 蔠hen my brother and sister-in-law come to visit from Texas, I know exactly where we are going!

I had heard great things and been wanting to try this place for some time... So glad I did! We went just a few days ago on 3/25/11 and had a wonderful experience. The place was packed, but they have a great form of organization down. The young woman at the register was super friendly and helpful with us first-timers. I chose the sliced brisket, and it was OUT OF THIS WORLD! Best brisket I'd ever had. The coleslaw comes with pretty much everything, and it's good. I liked the baked beans, but they weren't the best I'd ever had. But let me tell you, the macaroni and cheese is the way to go! My boyfriend had the St. Louis style ribs, and they were amazing, too - he loved them. He also enjoyed the corn bread. I feel like you can't really go wrong at Smoque! I can't wait to go back, and I'd like to introduce some out-of-towners to the place sometime. The place is in a very unassuming location, which I like. FYI -- there is a parking lot behind the building for restaurant diners. Always nice!

My hubby saw this joint on Guy Fieri's show on Food Network and told me we were going - oh joy. I only eat red meat every couple of months so I guess this will be a red meat meal! So, we went last Thurs around 1:30 thinking we could beat the "lunch rush" - ha, nope, we were wrong - we got the last available table! I had the half sliced brisket plate with coleslaw and baked beans - everyting was seriously great! The brisket wasn't doused with BBQ it was just enough to flavor it and not drip down your arm like some places. Hubbie had brisket platter with fries and beans and added on ribs. He loved the brisket but, is still raving about the ribs - he will be geting just ribs next time we go! Smoque had a line out the door by the time we were done with our lunch! Call ahead or go at non-meal times. Smoque is worth the trip!

As a New Englander, I am probably the least likely person to review a BBQ joint, but when have I ever let that stop me before. Coming from a BBQ neutral region, I have no bias and I really enjoy Smoque. 蔍 love how I can get pulled pork, St. Louis style ribs, and brisket under one roof. 蔜heir sides are spot on too. 蔊et the beans - you won't be disappointed. The combo platters are good and I also really enjoy the fact that you can get cheap sampler sizes to supplement your order. The line can be long, but it moves quickly. 蔜hey do a decent job of keeping order. 蔜he space isn't that large, so you may be rubbing elbows with your neighbor, but that's a small price to pay for BBQ this good. Smoque may not be able to solve the regional BBQ war, but it succeeds in giving everybody a fair shot.

Just go. �I grew up in Georgia where barbeque and SEC football are the real religions, and Smoque is the closest I've come to the slow smoked deliciousness that comes from "down South" I think the greatest strength of Smoque is that they pay homage to all the greats of the barbeque genre. Their brisket is pure Texas. 蔛low smoked, tender, and juicy. 蔜he ribs are straight out of St. Louis with a delicious dry rub. 蔋ave the sauce on the side and try 'em "dry" so to speak. 蔇on't let the sauce obscure the amazing flavors of smoke, and the lip-smacking unctiousness of the pork. 蔄nd the pulled pork tastes almost exactly like the style from my hometown in Georgia. �I also think that as far as thick sauces go, Smoque's got one of my fav's. 蔍t's not the syrupy sweet super thick sauce that you wind up buying at the supermarket, nor is it the thin vinegar and mustard based sauce of my childhood. 蔍t's it own beast of delicious tangy flavor with a hint of sweetness. 蔍 like to tear down my rack of ribs and dip just a bit in the sauce, so that I get a hint of the sweetness to accentuate the savory. �So do what I said in the first sentence. �Just go. PostScriptum: �Just go" early. 蔍f you go too late, you get to the front door and see a sign listing what they're out of. 蔕nly restaurant I've ever been to that has to do this on a regular basis.

Can't be a great entree without some yummy sides to go with. 蔅aked mac and cheese, coleslaw and corn bread are my choice sides. 蔜he slaw isn't creamy at all, it's has more of a vinaigrette kick to it. 蔒ake room for dessert or at least order it to go because the peach cobbler is a MUST. The ribs are great as well. 蔆an't go to a bbq place without trying ribs can I?!! 蔍've had both the St. Louis style and the baby back style. 蔄nd depending on the day, I can swing both ways. 蔙ibs that is!!

Go early, go often, try everything on the menu, because it is all delicious. 蔄nd ask for extra sauce because everything, EVERYTHING needs extra sauce.

If you love true Texas barbeque then you will love this place. 蔍t still doesn't come close to Salt Lick, Driftwood or Rudy's in Texas but it's pretty good and it's in CHICAGO! I don't have to go all the way to Texas for good barbeque. Everything looked tasty so I was in a bind. I was eating for one today and I wanted everything. So I ordered taste portions of brisket, pulled pork, texas sausage, mac/cheese, and cole slaw. 蔜he brisket is fall-apart good. The pulled pork was a tad dry. 蔜he sausage took home the grand prize! It's smoky, garlicky and very flavorful. 蔜he casing is crunchy and a good thickness. 蔜he mac and cheese was definitely unbelievably tasty. The cole slaw is NOT creamy and heavy on the vinegar. I love it but I can see how those from Chicago don't really like it. 蔍 do miss one thing that Texan bbq places always have with their bbq...PICKLES! I will definitely be back. 蔊o on Sunday and you can park in the attached parking lot without being towed.

I suppose I fancy myself a BBQ connoisseur. Having grown up in the Chicago area, I have a fondness and affinity for that sticky-sweet-tomatoey-Carson's-type of sauce (not that I would complain about L. Woods either). However, having lived in the deep south for many years, I also appreciate that pit-wet-and-dry-smokey-vinegary thing as well. So I was very excited when a new BBQ place had opened in the neighborhood. Smoque is a little place on a well-traveled corner. It is very clean and brightly lit (almost too brightly lit) and there are about 20 simple wooden tables with chairs, all of which were filled when we arrived. There is an open kitchen with a counter with friendly people, where you place and pick up your order. The nice-sized brisket and pulled pork sandwiches and platters have a terrific depth of flavor, with that smoky tang that takes you to the Carolinas, or Memphis, or someplace down there. Individual ramekins of cornbread and mac and cheese are noteworthy complements, and the BBQ beans should not be missed. They do a nice salad that you can add chicken to, and they serve it with a creamy ranch dressing that makes it very rich. I think I would add a few drops of sauce to that dressing for a bit more piquancy. All in all a lovely experience, comforting and reasonably priced. Get in there!

My Order: -Chopped brisket: (might have been my mistake. I also ordered 1 lb of the sliced brisket and pulled pork and when I got home and it was much better... even when it was nuked.): 蔍n my opinion it was a bit on the dry side, although I did not eat it right away. -BBQ sauce: Definitely waaaay too watery, not watered down but on the runny side. �-Side of mac&cheese: A plus. Nice and cheesy just the way I like it. Also nice and hot!! -Baked Beans: Good flavor. -Cornbread: It was alright, a bit on the dry side (though again, it wasn't consumed immediately.) All in all, I think 蔍'd give it another shot if I went back to Chicago. �Plenty of other good BBQ places in the Bay Area. Minus 1 star for the BBQ sauce/soup and lack of BBQ sauce when the 1lb of brisket and pulled pork was ordered.

There's a line out the door no matter what time you hit this place, apparently! We got in just under the wire before they closed and got the chopped Brisket platter with two sides each. I got the cornbread and the cobbler. Jen got the cornbread and the Mac & Cheese. Seriously brilliant brisket. The cornbread was moist and delicious and the peach cobbler was warm and gooey. It's a lot of food and well worth the wait. Since I've only been here the one time, I can't vouch for any of the other menu items, but the Texas Sausage looked intriguing.

I do not understand. I simply do not understand! It must be the power of good press. Maybe Oprah said something good about it so the drones showed up. I just do not understand. You do realize that other cities giggle at Chicago's attempt at BBQ. Restaurant 101: If you own a rib joint . . . have ribs. When we went, they sold out. Of every rib. It was 7:00pm on a Tuesday. They also had already sold out of chicken and sausage. Not good. Sauce . . . fine, I get it, they put lemon in their sauce. Everyone cheer, lemon is here! I don't get it. Fries were delicious. Perfect. Mac and Cheese . . . uninspired. Cole slaw, delicious. Pulled pork: dried out, little flavor, completely overrated. Clearly did not help that I did not want pulled pork . . . wanted freaking ribs! Brisket: fatty but delicious. Please Chicago, stop treating this place like it is a savior . . . have you not read Ayn Rand? If you keep saluting mediocre that is all we will end up with.

The first time I went to Smoque, we must have waited 30 mins in the line before getting in. It was a good thing that it was warm and not freezing cold. The menu is up on the wall and it's a serious BBQ joint. The location is pretty easy to get to as it's right off the Expressway. Parking was not an issue either as we found one fairly easily on the side street a couple of blocks away. You order the food first and then tell the person how many ppl is in your group and they will find you a spot. The place is filled with rustic benches and tables - very laid back and conducive for eating BBQ! The place is also a BYOB so that definitely helps cut down on the cost of your meal. :) Since then I've only order for to-go to bypass the long wait and the food is just as good! Their sandwiches are a hefty portion and I typically have enough for a 2nd meal. The sides are also quite tasty such as the mac & cheese and the baked beans. They have bits of meat in beans which makes it heavenly. You also can't miss the peach cobbler! Overall, great place for BBQ if you don't mind the long wait during peak-hours. Otherwise, order take-out and I promise that it's just as good!

I love Smoque BBQ! 蔅efore I get to the meats, I have to say the Mac 'n Cheese is the best I've ever had. 蔒aybe its the crumbly topping, or the oozy cheese, or maybe it's because each one comes individually packaged, making me feel it was made just for me. AND THE MEATS... the meats are so succulent, all of them! 蔍 love that I can get a "taste of _______," because even though I didn't want to focus on Texas sausage, I knew I needed to mix it up a little bit. 蔜he pulled pork is outstanding, the meat slips right off the ribs, and the chicken was soooo moist and tasty. Whatever you do, no matter how full you are, please, for me, end on peach cobbler. 蔍t may not be the absolute best cobbler in the world, but there's no better way to complete a good BBQ meal than some homemade cobbler. 蔍 personally ate mine while I waited 20 minutes for the Blue Line in 5�temperatures, and it somehow made the downtime bearable. Please know before you go in, this is not a typical restaurant with waiters and waitresses that take your order and bring you your food. 蔣ou walk in, place your order, and they yell your number when its ready. 蔣our food comes on a huge metal tray covered with butcher paper, just the way God intended.

By far the best BBQ I have ever had. 蔜he brisket is INSANE. 蔍 love the sauce. 蔜he sides are great too. 蔔o wonder they've been selling out of food lately!

I can't say I have much to add that hasn't been aptly chronicled by other Yelpers. * Overview: This is indeed some of the best BBQ you will find in Chicago. 蔄nd at a very reasonable price, if you ask me. �Not cheap per se, but inexpensive for BBQ -- you can get a sandwich and side for like $7-$8 and they sell sides and small portions of everything for like $4 if you want to sample it all.) * Details: Their sauce is a little runny but pretty good -- I'm picky in this regard and I liked it enough to use most of it. 蔖ulled pork was excellent; I liked the fattiness and moisture and the roll was a nice sweet compliment to the pork. 蔆ould use a pickle. 蔜he St Louis ribs were okay by me; I didn't think they were far and away better than Carsons, but likely better than Robinsons, Twin Anchors, and most chains. 蔉rench fries were very, very good -- lots of flavor and very crispy. 蔅aked beans were also very good -- a couple different types of beans, plenty of porky goodness. 蔜he corn bread comes in a funny little tin. 蔜he tin is actually a pain in the ass and the corn bread isn't anything special. * Yes, it is a little bit of zoo and they might run out of what you want to eat. 蔈ither call ahead or be ready to play it by ear. 蔍 wouldn't want to eat in on a crowded night. 蔍t's too bad they don't deliver, although it would likely take forever. 蔔ot terribly difficult to get to but there's not much else to do in that neighborhood except get back on the El or in a cab if you can find one. �* Easy directions. Take Blue Line to Irving Pk Road, exit at the south end of platform, right on Pulaski under the highway and down two blocks on your right. 蔕r Red Line to Sheridan and then switch to an Irving Park Road bus. 蔜rust me, it'll take forever, especially if you're bringing the goodies back to your apartment.

Salad at a BBQ Joint? I just had the salad with chicken from Smoque BBQ. 蔉or the first time in my 39 years I did a salad when I could have had smoked meat. 蔎ust too much good eating this week. 蔇amn if it wasn't tasty. 蔜he chicken was moist by breast standards and had a nice smoke flavor. 蔆ould have used a little more spice and another thimble of dressing but then again it could have been a rack of ribs.

My husband introduced me to this little BBQ place a few months ago, and since then I've ordered a brisket from there for Passover and dreamed about it no less than 4 times. 蔐ook - okay, BBQ chicken = boring, right? 蔠RONG! 蔍've never had chicken like this before in my life. 蔇id you know that BBQ chicken can be juicy? 蔉lavorful? 蔛exy? 蔕k, maybe not sexy. 蔔evertheless, Smoque's chicken tempts me away from my usual brisket or ribs staples. 蔍 haven't tried the Texas sausages yet, but I'm sure I'll get around to it one of these days. In summary, Smoque is hands down, some of the best BBQ in Chicago. 蔖lease do not take this claim lightly. 蔍 love BBQ like a bear loves honey. 蔍 also love honey. 蔅y the transitive property, I am a bear. 蔣ay logic.

Killer bbq restaurant. For a great overview of the place, check out the Diners, Drive-Ins, and Dives segement on it from the Food Network (should be able to find it on youtube). The food is outstanding to say the least. The only downside to it (and the reason I am only giving it 4 stars) is that the staff is sometimes not clear on the fact that they will seat you if it is busy, so sometimes a set of seats that was just cleared off gets taken by people who just walked in and sat down while the staff is fetching the people that were in line.

MMmmmmm...now that's some barbeque! Great meats - I've tried the ribs, brisket, and pulled pork. Terrific sauces - -- thicker, sweeter with the ribs -- thin, vinegar-based with a slight kick with the brisket Love the sides - could the mac n' cheese be more creamy? Save room (or MAKE ROOM) and splurge on the cobbler! Aways a wait, and you stand in line, but go with some friends and just take it in as part of the experience. Plus you get to eye all the various meals getting served and at nearby tables, which just serves to increase your appetite and prepare you for the large portions. Not too pricey, and worth every penny. The only downside is that, in my experiences, it's always busy and as you start to finish eating it is easy to feel rushed to leave. Definitely worth checking out.

A rainy weekend afternoon, a decent crowd, and really delish food... �equals: �We'll be coming back!

So after hearing about this place from a bunch of friends I finally made it in. 蔉irst off, I'm not a fan of lines or waiting 2 hours like Kuma's corner...not gonna do it. 蔍 walked away from this place twice because I didn't want to stand in line. �It is a small place inside and they do not serve liquor. So I went and patiently waited. 蔍 ordered food to go as it was a nice day and figured I'd find a park somewhere, snag a beer or two from a liquor store and eat in the sunshine. 蔍 orderd a brisket sandwich, half slab of ribs and a small mac and cheese as I heard it was great. �My ribs were not the tenderest that I've had, the taste was good but I'll take Merle's or Gale Street in over these. 蔜he mac and cheese was eehhh, not so great. 蔍 can make better mac and cheese at home. �The brisket....now that's where you earned your stars, I'd have rated this place much lower but the brisket is some of the best I've had and I will definitely go back for that.

I can't disagree with any of the great reviews about Smoque, BUT I would like to point something out. This is unquestionably one of the best BBQ spots in the Chicago land area, but only if you like a vinegar based BBQ sauce (think Virginia and/or Carolina style), so be forewarned if you are a tomato based BBQ fan. Beyond that minor detail Smoque is a "can't miss." I went to Smoque with a rather large group so I was lucky enough to sample almost everything on the menu! I ordered the brisket platter, which was great. I did use some of the thicker sauce intended for the ribs on it, and it made it even better. Other notables were the baked beans, and peach cobbler. While everything was very good, these two dishes were quite memorable. I would suggest giving Smoque a try without question, and be sure to remember it is BYOB.

This place is absolutely amazing! The ribs and the brisket sandwiches are great, as are the sides. I would pass on the chili, but always go with the mac and cheese. The peach cobbler is to die for. The best part is that the prices are really reasonable for barbecue. This place is becoming one starting to be one of my "regular" places to eat. The one drawback to this place is the long long lines (just b/c its so popular)

Some of the best ribs in the nation. From all my travels, I would say it comes down to Smoque in Chicago or Sticky Fingers in Chattanooga TN. Both offering some of the best dry rub I've ever tasted. This place is a BYOB, you can get a rack and sides for less than $20. They do offer a 1/2 and 1/2, which is a half rack of baby backs and a half rack of St Louis style. Service is very friendly. Be patient as there is probably going to be a line, it moves rather fast. Understand that your not going to be the only family in the mood for great ribs in the city. Not always a line, but usually around dinner time.

Unfortunately, I must deviate from some of the high praise offered for Smoque. There are many fine things about Smoque. The service was fun and friendly, and the sauce is outstanding. The pulled pork was also excellent, which is saying something because I prefer North Carolina style pulled pork with a vinegar based sauce. The reason I have to ding Smoque is that our ribs were undercooked. We got both baby back and spare ribs, and both needed more time in the smoker. It was a Sunday evening and it was very busy, so I suspect they were pulling the ribs off early in order to feed the crowd. Nonetheless, I was disheartened because I had heard so many rave reviews. Smoque has clearly become a top BBQ destination in the city and you should check it out. I plan to return and give it another try. But if you're a rib fanatic, you should consider the timing of your visit to avoid ending up with undercooked ribs that were pulled off the smoker prematurely.

Food: 蔜he food really makes this place (Note- 蔵t's BYOB). 蔣ou can tell from the moment you walk in the door, the owners, cooks & cashiers are 100% focused on food. 蔍 don't typically crave bbq, but I've started to now. 蔍 sampled the pulled pork, chopped brisket, hotlink, ribs, coleslaw, mac n cheese, baked beans & cornbread - yummy! 蔜he baked beans were a little heavy on the onion & the mac n cheese was more fluffy than creamy (from all the butter, I'm guessing) but all the flavors blended nicely. 蔜he name was definitely the staple behind the meat flavor, but I had been hoping for a little more of a smokey crust to the meat. 蔜here wasn't much of a crust, making me wonder if it'd been sitting for a while. 蔒aybe it's better during peak busy hours (I was there at 4:30pm on a Friday) but even without the crunch, I would go back - oh, and get the peach cobbler. Atmosphere: Small town feel in bustling Chicago; always busy but usually in a friendly way. 蔆afeteria style seating can be tricky for shy folks, but doesn't bother me any. This place is down to earth and all about the food - which gives me confidence in going back again and again. 蔍 wouldn't bring a date here for the first date unless he/she had moved from Memphis and was feeling homesick, but I would come back to meet friends and family. Parking: 蔛treet parking during business hours, and there is a small parking lot behind the restaurant that's available after hours. 蔣ou might have to walk & if that bothers you, you shouldn't be going here anyway - there'll probably be a line to get in. Price: Moderate; you get a lot of meat for your money, but the sides are pretty small for the price, so I suppose it all evens out. Service: For my friend and I, there wasn't a lot of service involved - walk in, order food, sit down, eat, and leave. 蔈veryone was friendly though, from the Cashiers to the busboys. 蔍 liked it and will be back.

My friends and I had a mean craving for some beers and bbq last night and went to check this place out to see what all the hype was about. 蔍 heard it was popular but did not expect to be waiting in line for about 15 minutes on a Tuesday. 蔜hankfully, it's byob so we drank some beers while smelling the deliciousness that awaited. �The best kind of dinner to have with friends is the one where everyone is not shy about sharing their food. 蔅ut when my buddy asked to share 蕀y napkin, it got a little weird. 蔜he brisket platter was f-ing awesome. 蔜he meat falls apart and melts in your mouth. 蔍 got the bbq beans and mac and cheese as sides which completed the holy trinity of bbq. 蔒y friends got the st louis ribs and pulled pork sandwich. 蔜he ribs didn't have an ounce of fat on them and I imagined the pulled pork tasted exaclty like ms. piggy. 蔅oth were awesome. 蔒an, woman, small children, and even domestic pets will enjoy this place.

Tried Smoque for lunch for the first time and was impressed, even comparing it to some of my fav bbq spots down south! I had the chopped brisket sandwich with fries and was lucky enough to try some of my husband's St. Louis ribs and Texas sausage. All were EXCELLENT. We weren't planning on getting the sausage, but I had a couple to use (where you need to spend $25) so we added a Taste portion of that on and it was a nice surprise! From what I hear, they're know for their ribs and brisket, so of course that's what we wanted to try. I didn't dabble too much into the sides, because there was already so much to eat, but they looked pretty good. It's not a very big location, so you'll have to wait around (and move around a lot so people can get around you), but it's worth it. Just know that you'll probably be at a large table with others and won't have much space.

Texas transplant here always on the lookout for BBQ - and this place completely delivers! The brisket and pork are EXCELLENT. And they got the sauce right - not overly sweet. The sides are amazing - mac&cheese is awesome, and well as the beans. AND the best peach cobbler I've had outside of Texas! My only minor gripe is the place is a little small, and there is no table service (you order and wait for your number to be called). So, don't make this "event" dinning. Take out would be ideal - but definitely go - it's worth it! OH - it's BYOB � they should put that on the website.

We arrived at smoque at about 2:30 on a Saturday, and it was packed. The service, however, was very quick, and for how busy they were, extremely friendly. It was my first time there. I ordered a pulled pork sandwich with slaw and fries, and I added a taste of the sliced brisket. My total came to about $13. We were seated after ordering and waited for our number to be called. When our food was ready, my first impression was how small the sides were. I tasted the coleslaw first and thought it was a little on the sour side. 蔄t this point you're probably wondering why I gave this place five stars. After one bite of the meat, I knew I was going to give it at least four. After all the remaining bites, I knew why the sides were the size they were. I was pleasantly full. The coleslaw, after a few bites of the rich bbq sauce was a pleasant palate cleaner, preparing you for the next bite of perfectly smoked meat. Next time I go, I'm getting the sliced brisket. Next time I go will probably be later this month.

On my recent trip to Chicago, Bella(my fat friend) brought me here, It was walking distance from where we were staying. I ordered the pulled pork combo with 2 side dishes. She got the 1/2 brisket and 1/2 pulled pork and got way more meat than I did! I have never tasted a better mac and cheese in my life. Only problem was that the serving was too small. The pulled pork was really good and so was the brisket. This is one of the better BBQ places I have been to.

This place is okay, but I don't quite see what all the hype is about. 蔄re there just not enough places in the area with BBQ, so one of the few gets more accolades than necessary? �I can only comment on what I ate: Mac and cheese - not my style due to the breading, but overall well done. 蔍 would prefer if it tasted more freshly made than cafeteria-style and did not come in the strange little tin. Slaw - I normally prefer a creamy version, but this was surprisingly good. Pulled pork sandwich - pork was a little dry and I had to pull off several chunks of fat. 蔍 like the pork completely smothered in BBQ sauce, and the amount of sauce given still left me with non-sauced pork at the end. 蔜he top of the bun was rather dry, which also made me want more sauce. Sauce - Tangy, good flavor, not very thick. �Fries (I ate two of my husband's fries) - Very good, but I don't really go to a BBQ place for the fries. This place is fine for a causal meal. 蔅e wary of going in the winter. 蔍t was cold in the restaurant and by the time I was about half-way done eating everything on my tray was cold.

Not bad. Probably one of the best in Chicago, actually. It's just that there AREN'T many good BBQ joints in Chicago. They just can't quite find the right mix. Case in point: Smoque. GREAT meat. Quality, in that it's actually smoked everyday, and the aroma of the place brings you to your knees. But their sauce? Not for me. Perhaps I'm spoiled by having lived near Texas for a few years, but there should be a little more natural flavor to the sauce. Oh, and my ribs were cold and the brisket was stringy. I can't fault the pink and grey, though! They know what they're doing with slow smoking the meats. Bottom line: If you're a fan of straight up smoked food, you're overdue here. If you like flavorful sauces, you probably need to go somewhere else.

I can't heap enough praise on Smoque and their catering team. We hired them to cater our rehearsal dinner of 20, and absolutely everything they did was awesome. Their office team was efficient and on top of all the little details, and their delivery guy was quick, kind, and on time. In terms of the food, how could you go wrong?! The prices were the most reasonable we found, especially considering the quality of the food. The big hits for everyone were the sausage, the brisket, and the baked beans.

The pulled pork, chicken, mac 'n cheese, and slaw were alright, but nothing to write home about, in my opinion. 蔠hat I was impressed with was how efficiently and expertly the waitstaff organized the line and found each party a table to sit at. �Smoque smokes any other BBQ place in my mind, to date.

It is sooo delicious and not very expensive at all ($4-$10) But the best part of the restaraunt besides the food is the service. The first time I went to smoque I ordered a pulled pork sandwhich and the owner gave me free brisket also to try and mac n cheese.

Pigs, cows and chickens everywhere are massaging themselves with BBQ rub, in hopes of being selected by Smoque. 蔄nd you know why? 蔅ecause Smoque isn't just BBQ-ing meat. 蔜hey are transforming the residents of Old MacDonald's Farm into moist and delicious gods. I love their ribs - the baby-backs are melt-in-your-mouth perfection, and the St. Louis ones will almost ruin you for all others. 蔜he sauce, served on the side, is tangy with a kick of sweet. 蔔ot too much, not too little, and it complements the meat well. 蔍f I was not afraid of being socially ostracized, I'd put a straw in the BBQ sauce and hit it. 蔒y only regret? 蔍 can't eat the bones. 蔍 guess I'll have to settle for sucking on them. 蔖oor me! My other favorite (!) is the brisket. 蔜his is the best brisket I've ever had. 蔍 had smutty dreams about Smoque's brisket that I can't describe in polite company. 蔛hhh, don't wake me - let me be! Further, when I die, I hope to be reincarnated as Smoque's macaroni and cheese. 蔍t's gooey and creamy inside, with a sharp twang and - AND! - a crunchy top. 蔎ust like Mom's! 蔕MG Finally, Smoque has the last word on good service. 蔠ould that I could get every restaurant in town to have such thoughtful, efficient and pleasant people manning the front. 蔜hose folks at the counter are exceptionally sweet, and I swear that I'm bringing them beers next time I visit. 蔉or the service alone I would go back.

4 stars: A casual place for yummy comfort food. I'm not a huge BBQ lover, but I like this place a LOT and get regular cravings. The ribs are really good - their Baby Back ribs are tastier than the St. Louis, but the St. Louis has more meat (so more bang for your buck). They both have an amazing smoky flavor that I love, the sauce is tangy good, but the meat is not as tender and juicy as I would expect. The Macaroni&Cheese side is creamy n'delicious and I think the Peach Cobbler is the only dessert they have, but it's the only one you need, it's so good! The place is small and the tables are crowded (so don't expect to have long, intimate conversations, though why would you while you're stuffing your face). The food's just as good ordered to go, so if you don't live too far, I'd recommend taking your food to eat comfortably in your own home.

We tried three different types of BBQ sauce with our brisket and pulled pork. It's soooooooo good. I can see why this place is one of the best BBQ places in the country. The mac and cheese is the best since it is baked! Their coleslaw is good, not the mayo drenched goopey mess but fresh and vinegary.

I discovered this place after a coworker suggested it. I then came over to Yelp to find over 300 reviews, how could I have missed this place. I decided to have lunch. I ordered the 1/2 pulled pork sandwich. For being a 1/2 size it was just right for lunch. The pulled pork was very good. I really liked the sauce. The sauce wasn't too sweet it was just right. The sauce had a great mix of flavors. I decided to get the beans as my side. They were excellent! Great flavor and just the right texture. The other side that came with the sandwich was the coleslaw. I normally like the creamy style better, but this tangy and not creamy coleslaw was really good. I can't wait to try some of the other foods offered. I really like ribs, so that will be my future taste. The interior was nice and had a good down to earth plain decor. The people were very nice and helpful. They did a good job of managing the flow of people. One thing to know. I passed the place by. It doesn't have a big flashy sign out front if your coming from the Kennedy. I went around the block and did find it after looking more carefully. I will be returning to try other food. I will also be bringing along other BBQ fans to try the food.

Smoque was solid. 蔍t didn't knock my socks off the way the reviews and line to get in suggest, but it was definitely solid and I'd go again. 蔣ou do wait a while in line, but once you get in it's counter service, so you're eating right away. 蔍t's BYOB, so if you drink a few while you're waiting in line, it's just like a normal restaurant, except you have to stand up until the point when your food comes. 蔊o on a nice day though, cause a chunk of the line is outside. My bf and I split the pulled pork and brisket platters, of which the brisket was way better. 蔜o me, the sides were the superstars. 蔅aked mac n cheese with perfect consistency, amazing baked beans, and a fabulous special side of the day - brisket chili. 蔣ou get 2 sides with platters, but you can add more for not too much, so I'd load up! Also, prices were down right awesome. 蔠e payed $22 for two platters, with 2 sides each, plus an extra side of cornbread.

Smoque is Smokin'! With this many reviews, I'll keep my short and let it be known I KNOW good BBQ, having lived in the South for many many years and married into a Southern family. Yes, 蔒'am. MUST HAVES: sliced brisket, mac and cheese with its wonderfully crumbly topping, ribs, slaw, baked beans, frieds AND peach cobbler that comes in a scrumptiously pecan-crunchy caramelized crust. MUST NOT HAVES: nothing whatsoever. Well, the sweet ice tea was a little weak, but hey, at least there's that option. I'll still take that, thank you very much. The leftovers taste just as good the second time around. My stomach and mind are clamoring for another visit very soon.

I'm most definitely not a BBQ conneiseur and I don't eat it very often, but this is by-far the best barbecue I've had. �蔅ecause of Smoque, I'm now a barbecue lover. 蔍 dream of it. �-) It would be great if they opened other locations. 蔍'd love to go back, but rarely travel to that part of the city.

You don't need me to tell you what the hundreds of other reviews have. The food at this place is great. The St. Louis ribs, the Texas sausage, the pulled pork sandwiches, the cornbread, the mac & Cheese, and the french fries were all sampled by yours truly on a recent visit. It was BBQ heaven, everything was amazing and done perfectly. I can see how this place would get crazy, and I'm not sure I would have given it a full 5 stars if we had to wait hours to order, but we came here at about 11:45 a.m. on a Sunday and there was only one person in line ahead of us. We ordered, were seated right away (with a high chair for our daughter no less), and had our food all within about 5-10 minutes of walking through the door. If you want to try this place but are put off by the prospect of fighting the BBQ-Loving masses, then I would suggest heading here before noon on a Sunday as we did. Even the parking out front was no problem.

In comparison to my last review I really don't think much has changed. Except for my rating. I recently took a trip Texas and went to a few BBQ places and I realized that smoke hits the nail pretty dead center. So I came back, and sure enough I was right. All around great flavor on the brisket, good BBQ sauce similar to that of Texas and good portion sizes. I think my personal taste is to have the sauce a little thicker. The best part about this recent trip was their Texas Chili. By far some of the best chili that I have had in long time. It could even beat my family's recipe. Similar Bonus Points as last time: BYOB, and Pretty good brisket, nice and tasty and good quality meat (Not a lot of fat like some places). I love the macaroni, wish you could get more. Finally they provide guided assistance/table organization during peak hours.

When I am in the mood for bbq this is where I have to go. 蔛mall casual place with big flavors. 蔋uge portions so if your not super hungry you might want to share with someone or plan on bringing some home for someone else. �Things I have tried and recommend: Chopped Brisket (or sliced) Mac n cheese Baked beans French fries

3.5 stars for the food alone, but the BYOB , seat-yourself, and parking lot factors bumped up Smoque to a solid 4 stars! My girl friends and I arrived around 5:30 PM on a weeknight, and there was a constant steady flow of patrons. 蔣ou order at the counter, seat yourself, and pick up your order when your number is called. 蔜his minimizes costs by not having to tip a waiter - bonus! 蔠e also brought in a 6-pack of beer w/o being charged a corkage fee - another bonus! 蔄nd we parked in the lot for free - bonus again!! Aside from these great perks, the food was very enjoyable too. 蔉rom word of mouth and Yelp reviews, I quickly realized that the brisket and St. Louis ribs are on point here. 蔛o I ordered the "1/2 and 1/2" sandwich (half pulled pork, half brisket - either chopped or sliced) which came with cole slaw and 1 side (I chose mac & cheese) and added a 1/4 slab (~3 ribs) of St. Louis ribs for ~$15 after taxes. 蔖retty affordable! 蔜he pulled pork was my favorite, but I was also impressed with the extreme tenderness of the brisket. 蔋owever, I thought the St. Louis ribs tasted too smoky, the sauce for the sandwiches were a little too tangy (although the ribs sauce was just fine - ketchup-y, slightly sweet, and thick), and I wish the side portion of mac & cheese was larger. 蔅ut these aren't dealbreakers, as I was really content with the pulled pork and brisket. 蔍 will definitely come back!

this is the real deal. lived in texas for 5 years for work, they really know how to do bbq there, i would eat it every few weeks. smoque has got some great stuff, the chopped brisket, chicken, ribs, brisket chili, beans, all was excellent and had different flavors from each other. BYO, if you forget, go 2 blocks down to the 7-11 will definitely be back - they were out of the pulled pork the night we went

I don't know why but I can't get on the Smoque bandwagon; for some reason this place gives me a tummy ache, and not from over-eating because it's a tummy ache that is unique to Smoque. Everyone raves over the mac and cheese but I find it slimy and gross; the fries are soggy and dense; the baked beans are overly sauced and I can't taste the bean. The pulled pork and beef brisket are amazing and perfect and all that, but they use that Hawaiian style of bread, which I don't think works with BBQ; the sweetness of the bread combined with the sweetness of the sauce just makes the whole thing too sugary. I also never really care for a soft roll with loose meat. I need something firm in a sandwich, whether it's the bread or the stuff inside the bread. Overall, Smoque just doesn't quite do it for me. Although, they debuted some manner of Texas-style hot link, which I have to say was mind-blowing, except that it also gave me a tummy ache. Smoque! Enough with the tummy aches!

We came back for a lunch with the son and a couple of his college pals. 蔍t was a first visit for them, and I think they would all agree with the rating - 蔭t least they ate like they would agree. 蔜he beef brisket was the usual unbelievably awesome good. 蔜he ribs this time (half slab of each St Louis and baby back) were also more moist and better than we've had from here in the past. �We all liked the St Louis ribs better. 蔔o waiting at 1pm on this weekday, but the queue to door would come and go sporadically. 蔄s usual, the attendants found a spot for 5 of us with no trouble. 蔜hey seem to be able to do it no matter how crowded the place appears. 蔍t's reaffirmed again - Smoque really is as good as it gets!

This place serves some awesome BBQ. 蔍 ordered the chopped brisket sandwich with baked beans, which was really excellent. 蔍 remember leaving the place already planning my next trip. The reason Smoque doesn't get 5 stars: 1. It is always really busy. 2. They frequently run out of everything. We tried to go there on Saturday at 7pm and saw a sign on the door that said "Sorry we are out of everything". 蔜hinking this was a joke we went in to find out they only had sides left and a rack of ribs....guess everything should not be taken literally. 蔠e left disappointed and tried again on Sunday. 蔠e got there at 1pm, 2 hours after they opened, and the line was out the door and they were already out of pulled pork and St. Louis style ribs. 蔄fter waiting in line and finishing our meal we walked out the door to see them put up another..."Sorry we are out of everything sign". 蔏eep in mind this was 3 hours after they opened!!!

So you have to know that today I started my eating with bacon. Just wanted to say that. I have heard of this place a lot, and especially lately the idea of BBQ was just exciting. After spending the day tooling around I was hungry. And I was given this among 4 places. I'm babbling. Took the Blue Line. Walked down the back stairs. From the smell of piss and CTA, you get a whiff of the BBQ from nearly two blocks away. I was excited. We walked the two blocks and took our place in queue like good boys and girl. The line was out the door, but what I quickly realized is most people do take-away. We stood. And waited. Around the corner you see the simple menu. By the time you get to cash register, you should know. We placed our order. Someone asks you if you're staying or going. He'll point you to your table (family style so be warned). We got our 12oz cups at the all-you-can-drink dispenser and patiently waited for our order to come out. At the table, we got a bit of all animals to enjoy: the half-chicken, the brisket and the ribs with a side of sausage. The sides were mac 'n' cheese, fries and beans. We all got the complimentary slaw and a side bucket-sito of the sauce. When our number was called, we marveled at the aluminum trays. And everything was amazing! My wife had the chicken and she actually ate the skin... Which she NEVER does. I had the brisket and it was so tender. And the ribs were not fall-off-the-bone but they were amazingly delicious. The mac 'n' cheese were as everyone says simply divine. No complaints here. The bit is: if you order a human-sized portion you don't walk out of there waddling. It's the right amount of food. The BBQ sauce isn't that thick Kansas City stuff either. It's definitely on the tangy side and a bit sweet. And those beans. MMMMMMFFFF! So good! This place is BYO and folks live it up, most bringing a six-pack of what I believe is beer. That would've rounded this meal off perfectly. Parking's a PITA so be warned. If you have access to the Blue Line I would do that instead.

I'm from Texas and have spent my fair share of time in Memphis as well. I can say that this place is legit. They have great dry rub ribs and moist brisket. The sides were every bit as impressive as the BBQ itself. I had the BBQ beans, which are a meal in themself, and the mac and cheese - both were awesome. I went in a large group of people and heard the same impressive feedback on the peach cobbler. Try Smoque, you will not be disappointed.

Whoa Mamma how I love Smoque. The smoky goodness starts the moment you walk in the door and smell the meat. 蔒y god, the meat. Growing up in the South, brisket wasn't really a menu option. 蔅oy, did we miss out. 蔜he brisket here is delicous, with a wonderful ratio of crunchy bits to juicy ones. 蔜he St Louis ribs are chewy (which is a good thing), a little fatty (also a good thing) and spiced just right. 蔈veryone raves about the macancheese but honestly, I wasn't that impressed. 蔔ow the cornbread, on the other hand, is impressive. Sweet, with real corn and a slightly crunchy top, it goes well with the spiced meat. And they have real sweet tea. And though I may not be a foodie by any stretch of the imagination, I am a teaie. Well, 蔭n iced sweet teaie, anyway. 蔄nd it's so freakin' good here. What are you waiting for? Also, if you love a man in uniform, then you have another reason to try it. Every time I've visited there have been at least 4 of Chicago's Finest feasting on the smoked meats.

Outstanding food - made with care, well-thought-out recipes, good value. Wonderful staff/owners - they really do care and they're down-to-earth. So yeah, they're SO great that the line can be long and sometimes they run out of food. 蔋ey, you can only smoke so much meat in a day, ya know? Let's just pray that they can expand soon and buy more smokers (smoquers). 蔍n the meantime, let's all start eating dinner at 3:00. There...problem solved.

I'm no BBQ connoisseur, but dang, I could easily tell that is some pretty awesome BBQ. Easily the best I ever had. We went on a Friday night around 7pm. There was a decent line out the door and it moved relatively fast. About a 20 minute wait in total. Completely worth it for the awesomeness ahead. If you want the line to seem faster, bring some drinks with you. Its a BYOB which makes the awesomeness ahead even better! We tried a bit of everything. The pulled pork platter, the 1/2 chicken platter, mac and cheese, peach cobbler, baked beans and a small tasting of the brisket. We came away with amazing tastes and very full bellies. To me, the highlights were the pulled pork and brisket. So delicate and so amazing. Accompanied sauces were amazing the sides were very good. My only complaint of Smoque is that I wish it was bigger! Tasting such awesomeness with shorter lines would probably equal weight gain across the city.

I must've been grumpy when I wrote my original review for this place.... Today for lunch I was in such a good mood.... (calling ahead helps too) My half-slab of lightly sauced st. louis ribs, with a side of fries, and mac and cheese just elevated my spirit into a new conciousness, that i overlooked everything else... Barq's root beer complimented the ensemble perfectly. Phone lady wasn't super nice when i called, but ikilled her with kindness. The elder lady inside was extraordinarily nice, and held a conversation with moi and mother for a while.... i was so pleased with this experience that i have to give it 5 stars.. sorry for my grumpiness in a previous review, smoque... forgive me.... i love you. :)

All the hype is true. Everything you have heard about Smoque is all real. It really is that good. A pack of friends and I decided to meet for dinner at Smoque last night. We got so lucky that the line was not insanely long when we got there. (By the time we left, the line was out the door with 20 people outside.) I had the baby backs with beans, slaw, and fires. My friends had the half and half plate, the beef, and the pulled pork. We ate like kings! Smoque is definitely the best ribs I have had in a long time (possibly ever).

Visiting old friends in Chicago. 蔕ne is a vegetarian and the other a repressed meat eater. 蔅BQ sounded perfect! The brisket was pleasantly or perhaps slightly over smoky. The slaw as crisp with vinegar. 蔜he beans also quite smoky with bits of brisket. I liked the smoke, but some might find it overwhelming. 蔍 think this is great BBQ for Chicago, but it really can't hold a candle to NC or TX BBQ. Bonus points for sweet tea being available with free refills.

Amazing food. Terrible wait in line. It's a shame Smoque BBQ isn't bigger. The whole line process almost takes away from how good their food is. What was going to be a quick lunch turned into a 2-hour adventure. Also, dress warm because the line leaves you waiting outside. I ordered the chopped brisket sandwich with mac and cheese. The sandwich is filling as well as incredibly tasty. I was really hungry and my watch read 4:20 but it was very high quality meat. The mac and cheese is even better. I want to fill up a tub with their mac and cheese and bathe in it. The girl who works behind the counter is attractive, although I think she might be under 18. Chris Hanson better not see this.

Not much more needs to be said here, but I will anyway. Got a pulled pork sandwich, it was delicious, and I guess it's cool that the sauce is on the side, it was the highlight for me, and would taste good on anything, sweet yet tangy. 蔒ac-n-cheese was good, kinda small portion, but included with the sandwich, and let's face it, I'd probably eat as much as they'd give me, so portion control is good. The slaw was the vinegar-but-no-mayo variety, decent but forgettable, and also comes with the sandwich if you get the 'deluxe' or whatever. Great meal under $9, and I got there around 4:30, so no line. 蔍'm not the type to wait an hour to get a meal.

This place may be the best BBQ in the city. 蔍've tried most nearly everything on their menu and my 2 favorites are their sliced beef brisket and pulled pork. 蔅oth are very tender and flavorful. 蔠hat really makes this place though is their side dishes. 蔣ou can pick from BBQ beans, Mac N Cheese, Peach Cobbler, French Fries and now Beef Brisket Chili. 蔜he fries are awesome, and you get a ton of them. 蔜he Mac N Cheese and Brisket Chili are really good as well. 蔠hen ordering a platter you get a choice of two, and I usually go with the fries and cobbler so I get something sweet to finish off the meal with. Overall Smoque is a filling and fair priced meal. 蔜heir BBQ sauce is very good, and you everything here really is homemade. 蔍ts a very informal setting and the only small issue is that the place can get VERY crowded around peak meal times, but that's usually the case with any good food establishment. 蔜hey don't have a ton of parking, but it's not hard to find a decent spot around the restaurant.

Some friends of ours suggested trying Smoque after seeing it on Food Network's "Diners, Drive-ins, and Dives". While don't think it qualifies as any of those, there is some decent BBQ here. Between my wife and I we got to sample a couple of mains and sides. She had the pulled pork, I had the brisket (sliced). We also had fries, mac and cheese, beans, and finished it off with some peach cobbler. The side portions are pretty small (well, not the fries) so it wasn't as much food as it sounds! I thought the sliced brisket was excellent. The pulled pork wasn't quite as good, but it wasn't bad. The brisket was just so tender and flavorful. Definitely the highlight, if you ask me. The fries were good: well seasoned and hot. The mac and cheese was good, not the best I've had, but tasty . The winner on the sides for me were the beans... they were excellent!! Seating is an issue here--you place your order at the counter, then find (or attempt to find) a seat. They did have a "host" helping people out, and trying to save spots for larger groups (ours was seven, so it was an adventure). The kitchen was also helpful, holding our order until we got seats, so our food was hot and fresh. That's a major kudos to them on service! Overall, Smoque was good BBQ and I would definitely go back, and if you live in the neighborhood, it would make for good take out anytime.

What can I say, what can I say, if I lived near Smoque I would redefine obesity. Ladies and gentleman, this is probably the best BBQ I've had at a restaurant, ever. True, better BBQ is available, but only in someone's back yard or at a cook-off. As for mass produced BBQ, Smoque is really not just a little better than the rest, it is much much better. I ordered the St. Louis style ribs, brisket, mac & cheese and corn bread. Holy cow the ribs were good, and you get two different kinds of truly fantastic bbq sauce. They don't serve the same old Cattleman's sauce, they have something different that I have never had before, damn is it good. It's BYOB, there are napkin dispensers at the tables, prices are extremely reasonable. The dining area isn't fancy at all...they basically focused on the food. Stop reading yelp reviews about this place and just see for yourself!

Sweet Carolina! This is the best Carolina style BBQ I've ever eaten, better than anything I've actually had in the Carolinas or east Tennessee. In fact, when comparing some east Tennessee BBQ to this stuff I was embarrassed to tell folks there where it was done better. I think I was more surprised than anything else that this wasn't St. Louis or Kansas City BBQ. Can you go down to North Carolina and teach them a thing or two? Please?!

Update: We went again this past Sunday night at 7:45pm, knowing that they closed at 9pm. We arrived and there was a line about 15 people long out the door. The staff there is great though; they keep things organized and the line moving. Warning: if you go near closing time, just know that they do run out of many popular items. "Sorry folks, we are out of Chicken" was posted when we arrived. By the time we ordered, they had run out of sliced brisket and only had chopped brisket available. Also, out of Peach Cobbler too. I wiped my tears away and ordered up some delicious cornbread instead. We live nearby, so grabbed our order to go to avoid sitting in other people's laps. Took about 45 minutes to order and get our food, but definitely worth the wait (and weight...gained...after eating another hefty/affordable meal).

Ok I give in. Returned for a third try. The baby back and the St. Louie ribs are pretty tender and tasty. 蔜he brisket is still by far the winner.

We went there on my birthday (April 18) because I read great reviews. 蔍t's a small joint, and you have to bring your own alcohol. But, the baby back ribs and brisket sandwich were incredible. 蔒y wife prides herself on making great ribs (she put them on the grill and then into an oven for hours over low heat). I couldn't believe that she loved the ribs here. 蔍t's replaced our favorite rib joint (previously held by Twin Anchors). This is a joint. 蕋he atmosphere is pure neighborhood with no fancy waiters.

This place... well, this is why I'm making a profile on Yelp. �When I was growing up in southern California, my dad, after leaving Tennessee, took it as a sacred mission to introduce me and my little brother to proper barbeque. 蔠hen we'd go back during the summers, we got barbeque there, but it took years of searching to find good barbeque nearer home. 蔋e finally found a really good barbeque place eventually, about thirty miles from our neighborhood, but it's unfortunately now closed. �So anyway, I take barbeque seriously. �Smoque is probably the best barbeque joint I have ever been to. �Now, the atmosphere isn't absolutely perfect, but it works, and wow, is that food incredible! 蔜heir menu is the basics of barbeque. 蔛o far I've had the brisket and the St. Louis ribs. 蔅oth are spectacular. 蔍 have never had ribs with better texture, they're just cooked perfectly. 蔜he meat is excellently flavored, but it's almost a side act to the sauce. 蔜his rib sauce is the best I've ever tasted, it is absolutely amazing. 蔜he brisket sauce is less striking, but it's busy taking a backseat to the meat. 蔜he brisket is almost falling apart, and can actually take a little work to eat with a fork, but is somehow not overcooked. 蔍t's got a wonderfully slow flavor, and my girlfriend will testify that I sat there just staring off into space as each bite worked its way on through to a perfect smoky aftertaste. �Now, there's the matter of the sides. 蔜hey're all incredible. 蔍'd like it if the place had potato salad, but I would be forced to take another couple minutes to decide on my sides each time if it did. 蔜he owner, who is constantly circulating, making sure everyone's doing well, stops to talk to customers constantly, and when he stopped by our table mentioned that they're working on a potato salad. 蔠ith as much work as they've clearly put into the other sides, I'm very much looking forward to it, since I'll be going back regularly. �The coleslaw is pitch perfect, tangy rather than sweet, and very simple. 蔍t cuts the flavor of the meat just right. 蔈very so often I'd swing over to the coleslaw for a moment, and going back to the meat was like taking a first bite all over again, and that's something you'll probably appreciate as much as I did. 蔜he mac and cheese is great, crusted with bread crumbs and dense cheese sauce, the cornbread is excellent, and the fries are simple quality, but if you pass up the ridiculously wonderful cobbler for them you'll regret it. 蔊et the cobbler. 蔜he baked beans are unusual, with an almost apple flavor and chunks of onion, but definitely good. 蔜hey're probably not for everyone, but I liked them a lot. �Oh, and get a sausage on the side. 蔜hey ship it in from Texas, and it's worth it. �The location is a little inconvenient, but it's well worth it. 蔜he place could use a better sign for anyone coming from the north. 蔈ven if you don't see it, just make a right on the first little street that isn't right up against the freeway embankment. 蔛till, the place is only a couple years old, the prices are reasonable, the service is good, and I'm looking forward to filling in any gaps when I go back yet again.

Anyone who doesn't eat meat, please stop reading.... Smoque BBQ is hands down the best BBQ I have ever decided to put in my mouth. 蔉rom the amazingly charred chopped brisket, to the incredibly tender and smoky pulled pork, followed by the heavenly pairing of beans and brisket pieces, to the sinful sampling of peach cobbler, this was the ultimate feast. 蔄nd don't forget the insanely low prices. Even on a dull Sunday afternoon the line was out the door, but moved rather quickly despite everyone savoring each bite. 蔜he owners know their food is this good, and are willing to accommodate any particular wish of their devoted clientele, helping everyone choosing to dine-in find a comfortable table. The famous saying, "Where there's smoke, there's fire," can now officially be changed to "Where there's smoque, there's happiness."

While most of the meat is amazing... and some background info before I write further: I don't care about fruit so much I don't give a damn about peaches I would eat ribs and bbq sauce every day 蔲or the rest of my life if i could I would bathe in that sauce, could I get enough ... I usually end up finishing that peach cobbler side at home, and get my hands messiest that way, trying to scrape out the burnt sugar out of the aluminum thingie... it's completely addictive, and... no... not ashamed of it, rather the opposite;-) Good call, Pall! Minus: that asshole on my left, talking my ear off, screaming to be heard (granted the place is busy and loud) Plus: BYOB, really can't beat that to go out cheap

Oh Smoque how I'm so glad I found you. Great BBQ, fair prices, my go to place for comfort food. Surprisingly I actually tried this place catered the first time around. I was blown away that catered food could be this moist and delicious. I'm a HUGE cheese lover, thus I always go for the mac and cheese and almost any BBQ joint. It's sad how my first experience with Smoque included a TRAY of mac and cheese. Sadly when I went to dine in I only got a small tin and ended up ordering 2. Get the St. Louis ribs, mac and cheese, and a side of pulled pork or brisket. You cannot go wrong.

I love BBQ and I love Smoque. 蔜his is by far one of my favorite BBQ places ever, it only receives 4 stars because I hate they community, picnic 蕋able seating that they offer for dine in. 蔍t is safe to say that I have tried everything on the menu by now. 蔒y two favorites are the BBQ pork sandwich and the chicken salad. 蔜he flavor of the pulled pork and the brisket in this place is crazy, it's ilke they have an old fashioned smoke house hiding in the back. 蔜he french fries are crispy, just greasy enough and salted to perfection. 蔆ornbread=delicous and the mac n cheese may actually have crack hidden in it. 蔜he grilled chicken salad has the smoky flavor as well and is crispy on the outside, juicy on the inside. �The small salad is enough for two meals. 蔍 recommend getting the small with an extra piece of chicken and saving it for later. 蔕verall Smoque is awesome, I prefer to do carryout because I find it hard to relax and enjoy a meal with the line going out the door and around the corner with such a limited amount of seating. � stars for food, 4 for eating under pressure.

We drive one hour to get to Smoque and it is so worth it! The brisket is the best I have ever had - including Memphis and Kansas City. 蔜he brisket is smokey flavored and very tender. 蔖ortions are generous, so plan on taking some leftovers home. Small place and sometimes you will wait in line, but it is worth it. 蔒ac & Cheese is awesome and the fries are the best in the city. 蔜hey have even run out of brisket at times. 蔖lan on arriving between lunch and dinner to avoid the crowds. The owners were passionate about grilling at home, quit their corporate jobs and opened Smoque. 蔔ow, if they would just open another location!

The greatest BBQ in all the land. 蔄lso, great service. 蔍 like how they seat you where it works out the best for all patrons. 蔍t gets around one of my all-time pet peeves - people who 'save' seat s while their friends are in line for food. 蔖eople! 蔍n the time that it takes your friend to order and get food, an entire other party could have eaten at the table you're saving. 蔣ou're messing up the flow! �The folks at Smoque seem to have figured this out - kudos to them! �Try the St. Louis ribs - they're like no others, and you don't even need to add BBQ sauce.

I dream about Smoque.......went a few weeks ago and it proved to me, once again, how amazing this place is. My memory isn't infatuated, this place just rocks! For god's sake, get the Sliced Brisket Platter, and make sure to get an extra side of pulled pork - holy jebus.

With its trendy spelling, I expected the inside of Smoque to be some kind of Nouvelle Barbeque experience. And am I ever glad it's not! The inside is that of a simple, functional joint: tables and chair a little too close together, a self-serve machine for fountain drinks, and a counter where you place your order, pay your money, and pick up the goods when they call your name. How's the food? Mostly fantastic. Since I live west of the city, I usually get my BBQ fix at Famous Daves (used to go to Robinson's, but they've really slipped). And while FD's ribs, sides, variety of sauces, and service are always enjoyable, there's something else going on at Smoque that really knocked me out: depth. Where some ribs might offer you mostly the flavor of its sauce, the St. Louis ribs I had at Smoque had a deep smokiness that permeated the meat, followed by a savory and spicy rub, before I even got to the flavor of the sauce! Oh, and though Smoque doesn't have a table-full of sauces to choose from, the one they give you is worth a table full -- it's excellent. So the ribs alone were worth five stars. Several of the sides were up to this same high standard. The baked beans were delicious and sweet, with flavorful meat and carmelized onions. The french fries were terrific. And the peach cobbler in individual-size tins looked small but turned out to be the perfect size after gorging oneself on meat. In our visit, there were only a couple of misses: the Texas Sausage and the Brisket Chili were both perfectly fine but not home runs. Service, by the way, turned out to be an unexpected surprise. When I was undecided between St. Louis and Baby Back Ribs, the unassuming mustachioed manager on the floor guided me to the former. And when the counter girl rang us out without beverages after mistakenly telling me they didn't have diet fountain drinks -- before I noticed that the fountain machine had Diet Coke clearly labeled -- Mustache Guy quickly gave me two cups. Thanks, Mustache Guy! And thank you, Smoque. I'll definitely be baque.

This place was so good! The pulled pork sandwich was huge and the meat had such a wonderful flavor. The BBQ sauce was uniquely a little more vinegar-y than most, but it worked. The fries, of which they give you a million, were very good and the homemade mac & cheese was awesome. This place is very unassuming--no sign of pretentiousness. The coleslaw, while not as good as my grandma's, was still pretty damn good. I can't wait to bring friends/family here.

I hate trying to find good barbecue. Usually. 蔍t never meets my expectations, and I just feel like a fat slob and really let down when I leave the joint. Usually. So the family walked into Smoque, which had been touted as all things gastrointestinally orgasmic. My fiance, he loves his barbecue. He looks at the guy and says, "What's good?" 蔜he dude behind the counter says, "Everything." So? We got everything. It's wrong how good it was. 蔍 want to go back, which says it all. The barbecue was amazing. 蔛aucy and perfect. Every bit of the meat was sumptuous. 蔜he fries were the best, tastiest, crunchiest fries I have ever had. The mac and cheese was fricking unreal. The damned beans were even good, and I usually won't even touch baked beans unless my mama made them. The slaw was great. The cobbler was fantastic. Jeeeeezus. 蔍 want it now. Yeah, so I would say go. And get everything. Really. 蔔ow. Are you still reading this? 蔊O!

FREAKING AMAZING! Brisket: tender, fall off the bone and full of flavor. The Sauces: brisket comes with a sauce, ask for rib sauce also. 蔅oth are out of this world and have a unique sweetness/hickory flavor unlike any other sauce I've tried. Mac and Cheese: GET IT. 蔜hat's all I can say. Peach Cobbler: 蔇essert heaven. 蔍f you even like peach cobler a little bit, you will go nuts over this one. Even the fries are pretty special! 蔙eal potatoes. Simple and tasty. I can't wait to go back and try more. 蔍'm sure its all good. 蔄fter years of using yelp to help me in my daily decision-making process, Smoque BBQ has single-handedly given me reason to create my own yelp account so I could review it. The verdict: GO NOW! Expect to wait in a long line (ours took about an hour...no exaggeration. 蔠e were hot and grumpy as hell but once we had the food...everything was right with the world.) 蔍 think you can order ahead of time for carry out and skip the line completely. 蔜he prices are VERY reasonable because you get a lot of food for the money. we spent about 25 dollars for both of our brisket meals plus 3 or 4 sides each PLUS dessert and a soda. It was insane. 蔜he place gets pretty packed so you end up in tight quarters with other diners, but its ok cause you're all sharing in the same mind blowing food experience. 蔍 think the guy sitting next to us summed it up best when he said: "This is so good...I've never been so annoyed to have to breathe." right on!

Fat worth having. Forget the sides, eat a salad earlier in the day, this should be a meat only meal. This small specialty bbq shop apparently always has a line but it moves quickly. Once inside, the humid smoky smell of roasting meat hits your nose and the anticipation of tender, juicy meat consumes all thought processes. With an assortment of baby back ribs, brisket and pulled pork, I made myself a custom napkin bib and rolled up my sleeves to indulge in this decadent meal. The brisket was my favorite and the bbq sauce was spicy, sweet, tangy. Just go.

There's just something about less-than-kosher Chicago restaurants operated by Jews; maybe it's true love that drives them to the forbidden fruit, or maybe it requires a necessary dealing with the devil to get into the business, but in my experience, my fellow tribal Chicagoans do excellent things with treyf. First Hot Doug's, and now Smoque. We arrived at ~7:40 PM on a Thursday, and the line was just barely out the door, which is always a good sign. Our food was ready before 8:10; despite the sea of humanity in this establishment, you still probably eat quicker after entry than at a sit-down BBQ restaurant. Every last morsel was divine. The pulled pork was moist yet surprisingly lean, without an atom of gristle to be found. The ribs had the telltale pink ring of meat just beneath the surface that signifies an expertly-smoked rack. The texas sausage was tender and spicy. And then there's the brisket. I apologize if you have a Jewish grandmother, because this is better than hers. It is perfectly seasoned and smoked to perfection, tender while still retaining its meatiness and shape. The side dishes (fries, corn bread, BBQ baked beans, mac and cheese, corn bread) were all delectable; it was clear that effort had been put into them, which is unusual for a barbecue place, especially a good one. Halfway through the meal I was preparing this yelp review, and realized that there was one thing that would hold Smoque away from a 5 star review: the sauce. This being a Chicago establishment, it was no surprise that the sauce was too thick and saccharine, as my fellow natives have an inexplicable penchant for cloying, barely-more-than-ketchup barbecue sauces. Still, I could not forgive this very average sauce; I wanted a sauce that packed more vinegar punch, with less tomato and a heck of a lot more heat. A fellow patron overheard my gripe, and informed me that they carried a spicy sauce in addition to the regular offering; I immediately went to the counter and picked up a sauce that (surprise) packed more vinegar punch, with less tomato, and a heck of a lot more heat. There went my lone complaint. I guess I could take off a star because the woman who took my order forgot to ask me if I wanted mild or spicy, but this meal left me in such a state of ecstasy that I'd feel like a scrooge if I did so.

I've had this place bookmarked for weeks and finally was in the area and hungry on top of it! Parking was a breeze - there is plenty of parking on Avondale, which is less than a block away. We came in at 3 PM on a Saturday. Seemed like a random time, too late for lunch and too early for dinner, but the line was out the door. The wait did not turn out to be very long, because Smoque is very well staffed. We ordered the pulled pork and brisket platters. Both were very tender and flavorful. The portions are not big, but keep in mind that the flavor itself is enough to satisfy hunger. Fries were decent as was the mac & cheese. The beans were a bit too sweet for me, but hey, it's just preference. The coleslaw was really nothing to write home about, but it seemed like a healthier option over the usual cream based. I wish I would have tried the peach cobbler everyone is raving about - maybe next time. The dining experience is cafeteria style. We jumped at the first available standalone table - I don't like eating next to strangers... Anyway, that's why I'm taking away a star. I wish the ambiance was a bit more comfy and it would be great if they found a way to incorporate some outside seating. Oh, the drinks come with free refills!

There are many great things about Smoque BBQ, it's an unassuming place located in a small neighborhood in Chicago. The food was great, with great authentic Texas BBQ taste.

Not Kansas City BBQ but by far the best I've had in Chicago. (Do yourself a favor and never go to Smokedaddy's, that BBQ made me throw up alittle in my mouth.) My usual is the ribs with a side of the mac and cheese. I will say I'm pretty picky when it comes to my ribs, and Smoque meets the challenge. I don't love their mac and cheese, probably cause it's too thick but I do like it enough to order it repeatedly. The beans are also delicious. Pick your meal times wisely, this place gets packed, quick!

The family and I really enjoyed this great BBQ joint. �I had a sliced brisket basket, and thought the meat was the best I've had in a long time. 蔍 tried a sample of my family's ribs and sausage. 蔜he meat was extremely well prepared and delicious, though the ribs weren't as tender as I've had elsewhere. 蔜he meat is definitely the main event here -- and it was wonderfully well smoked and delicious. The sides were good, but weren't as wonderful as the meat, but nobody's perfect, right? 蔜he beans were delicious. 蔍 liked the BBQ sauce, though it was a bit too sweet for me. �I generally prefer a bit more of a "zesty zing" 蔵n my BBQ sauce that wasn't present here.). The coleslaw and fries were both okay, but I wasn't as impressed with then as the meat. 蔋owever, the young children definitely enjoyed the fries. 蔍 liked the macaroni and cheese as a side, though the kids liked it less. The wait in line was well worth the wait, and probably consistent with great BBQ restaurants elsewhere. 蔜his is definitely not a place when you're in a rush, and finding parking may pose a problem a problem.

We finally made it to Smoque, and it was everything we had heard it would be and more. We picked up and brought home, and everything stayed warm and delicious after the 20 minute drive. We got chicken, which was so moist and smoky, and the ribs, which were really tender, and the pulled pork, which was also moist and full of flavor. For sides we got the cornbread and the mac and cheese, which come in little metal containers that they're baked in, so everything stays really moist. The bread was full of flavor and had pieces of corn in it, and the mac and cheese had a great topping. Now, the really amazing thing about Smoque is their customer service. When we got home, we realized we had gotten sausage instead of our chicken, and the people on the phone insisted on delivering the chicken to us, AND brought us a gift certificate for our troubles. So above and beyond, and we're definitely customers for life now! Totally worth the trek to support such a great establishment. Thanks, Smoque!

I'll start this review off with list of CONS and then PRO: CON: -Not enough seating capacity; can only seat 30 maximum. -On weekends, you WILL wait at LEAST 30 minutes if there's a line forming outside. 蔅ut expect one hour at least, in reality. PRO: -THIS BBQ IS THE S***! 蔅oth St. Louis and babyback ribs are VERY smokey in flavor and falls right of the !#@$@$#@ bone. 蔛imple AND delicious. 蔜he bbq sauce is sweet/tangy, as it should. -Pulled pork is very good, as is brisket. 蔜he brisket literally falls to pieces because it's been cooked so well. �-Mac n cheese is sooooo cheesy and crumbly; speaking of crumbly, peach cobbler is awesome too. -Corn bread is pretty decent; I've yet to eat a cornbread that blows my mind. -The staff is UBER friendly and helpful; there's free umbrellas outside for those who wait when it rains, while all the workers are attentive to your needs and passes out menu to those who wait. -The owner takes care of people, asking what they need, taking suggestions and overall being a top notch restauraenteur. �Conclusion: -If you want to step away from "corporate" ribs and get into small joint goodness of bbq heaven, this is the joint! 蔠orth every wait!!!

I'll preface this review witha couple of facts about myself: 蔍 was born in Houston, TX and lived between there and Dallas, TX until I was 16 at which point my family moved to Charlotte, NC where I stayed until age 21. 蔍 went to college in Wilmington, NC (far east NC) and lived there for 11 years. 蔒y younger brother and his family live in Savannah, GA. 蔒y father was on a BBQ team in TX for years before I was born and several years after. 蔍 know BBQ. So, we were in Chicago looking for an apartment and a local friend suggested this place. 蔋e went so far as to say the pulled pork was better than any he'd ever had in NC. 蔒y GF (raised in Raleigh, NC) and I decided to give this place a shot. It looks like a BBQ joint outside and in. 蔠e approached the ordring area and looked over the menu. 蔜here were at least 10 people in the "kitchen" - more than I've ever had on a hot line (I'm a chef) in my career. 蔍 ordered a 1/2 rack of baby back ribs, side of sliced beef brisket, BBQ beans, mac & cheese and cornbread. 蔒y GF ordered the pulled pork, cole slaw and mac & cheese. Our order was ready in 5 minutes (there isn't any cooking involved - it's all done and ready to be served). Neither the ribs or brisket had been sauced before the meat left the smoker; 蔮ig no-no in the BBQ world. 蔛auce should be applied about 30 mins before the meat comes out of the smoker and allowed to caramelize on the meat. 蔜wo sauces came out with our order. 蔔either was a Texas-style sweet sauce or a Carolina-style mustard/vinegar sauce. 蔔either sauce was appropriate for the meats we ordered. The dry rub on the brisket was good and would have been enhanced by the right sauce. 蔜he rib rub was heavy on chili powder and not complemented by either sauce. 蔜he pork had no rub flavor to speak of. Ribs should be fall-off-the-bone tender if smoked and held properly. 蔜hese were not - I had to cut them of the slab. 蔜he brisket was smoked and held properly - very tender and flavorful. 蔜he pulled pork came out just over room temp and had no texture. �Sides... 蕋his was not southern-style cole slaw. 蔍t tasted of vinegar and seasonings with a little oil of some kind. 蔆ole slaw dressing is mayonnaise, sugar, vinegar and seasonings - which seasonings depends on who's making it. 蔒y GF (initially very excited about eating slaw) took one bite and spit it out. 蔜he mac & cheese was the same stuff I got a Luby's Cafeteria with my grandma as a kid. 蔍 don't what BBQ beans are but we don't have them in Texas or NC. 蔠e have baked beans, which should be a combination of pinto beans, ketchup, brown sugar, bacon and seasonings. 蔜hese were swimming in a thin sauce with onions tasted like they had Liquid Smoke in them. 蔆ornbread was from Jiffy Corn Muffin mix - $1.00 at the local supermarket. 蔍t wasn't bad, I like Jiffy Corn muffins. Overall, the brisket was good- not great. 蔜he pulled pork was awful compared to the BBQ shacks in NC. 蔜he sides were nothing to write home about. 蔜he experience was sub-par at best. 蔒akes me think I should open a BBQ joint in Chicago.

I love Guy Fieri and Diners/Drive-ins/ Dives. 蔛o this place was definitely on my list to check out. 蔍 really enjoy this place for going all out on their sides. I'm a flavor junkie. I like to taste it all, but I don't have the stomach capacity for "all you can eat." So this place works! It's great to share with other people. 蔍'll usually split a full slab of ribs and share the small sides. I really enjoy what this place has to offer, but I feel sometimes there's a hit-or-miss feel. 蔕nce I've went and the meat was a bit dried out. 蔛ometimes the bbq sauce was too much tang and not enough sweet. Cornbread not quite as hot as it should be.... But still. I do like the place and it's definitely worth the check out. 蔎ust be forewarned. You may have a long wait for dinner hours, so try and head out to this place around lunchtime. 蔕therwise an early dinner (like 4-5). Seating is a little tight, so don't be surprised to share side-by-side seating like you would in a highschool cafeteria. I love love clean hands. 蔏inda too bad that they don't have little antibacterial hand wipes that other places do. Still. I've had some terrible ribs. 蔜his place is pretty good--- although not exactly amazing.

Sinfully delicious. After seeing this place on "Diners, Drive-Ins, & Dives" we had to try it. I got the chicken which was cooked to perfection, and mac & cheese which was heavy but amazing. There were only two downsides for me - no alcohol with your bbq and there was not a single vegetable on the menu.

Pulled pork heavenly as are the fries. Didn't care for the cole slaw (it is just DRY with no sauce) nor the St. Louis ribs. Beans were good as was the macaroni and cheese. B/f had the brisket, that was quite good as well. Disappointed a few times called ahead, they weren't accepting call aheads as their line was out the door. 蔔o longer in the area, but will make it back there some day.

Best BBQ in Chicago. Period. And when I say BBQ I mean a smokey brisket or dry-rub ribs, not the chain-restaurant, drowned in sugary-sauce, baby-back ribs that the midwest is plagued with. 蔙eal southern BBQ. I've known about this place since it opened and unfourtunetly it's ever-rising popularity keeps me from going as often as I'd like. 蔍t's not uncommon for them to be be out of pork and/or ribs some days shortly after lunchtime. 蔜he only 'real' authentic southern BBQ I've had in the Midwest and there isn't much more I can say that hasn't already been said.

Smoque BBQ is a good place for BBQ. 蔍've tried the St. Louis style ribs, baby-back ribs, pulled pork sandwich, and sliced brisket sandwich. 蔕f those, the sliced brisket sandwich is the one I favor as it is soft, moist, and has a nice smokey taste. 蔙ibs are so-so, sides are okay, nothing to be desired, which they serve little stingy amounts in these small foil containers...must be a cost cutting strategy. 蔆ole slaw has a vinegar based dressing which I don't care for. 蔅BQ sauce is eh, okay as well. 蔇efinitely try their sliced brisket sandwich...a must! Overall, okay prices, okay service, okay food.

Best beef brisket I've had. The crust and rub they have for that is second to none, and they really have the technique down. Same with the chicken--such a tangy and tasteful flavor without being salty. Even the white meat is fantastic and just as desirable as the dark meat. I'm not as big of a fan of the pulled pork though, as it fits the reasons why I don't like pulled pork in the first place--rather dry and tasteless, like eating twine rope. Try Honky Tonk in the south side for pulled pork... I've only ever had carryout from here, and during peak meal times I definitely recommend planning ahead and phoning in your order for pickup. They'll take your order up to an hour ahead of your pickup time. The ordering line gets very very long, and seating then becomes even more of a problem.

I'm sure Smoque is a meat lovers heaven - all I saw were huge piles of meat. Everywhere. Meat up to the gills! I however, am a vegetarian. We went here when celebrating a co-workers birthday. Naturally, I'm the only vegetarian so I was left with very, very few options. I ordered sides (which are the size of a baby food jar), so I had all these little tin foil containers in front of me. I got the slaw, mac N cheese and cornbread. Not bad, not bad at all. I also nibbled at a co-workers fries. Yes, the sides were good, but it was a strange experience eating my meal out of 5 tiny tin foil containers. I wish they could have just put them on a plate or something. My co-workers seemed to enjoy themselves . . . they ate until they couldn't anymore. I'm giving it 4 stars to represent their satisfaction, basically. I'm a fish eating vegetarian (a pescatarian?), so clearly this isn't the place for me.

You know a place is cooking up some mean BBQ when you can smell the smoque (sic) down the street. 蔜his place definitely lived up to all the hype! 蔜he brisket is very smokey with a perfectly charred exterior. 蔒ost of the sides come in foil cups (including the corn bread!?!) which was somewhat surprising but I'm sure helps them keep the line moving. 蔜he coleslaw was pretty bland, but the sweet and smokey beans definitely made up for it. We didn't realize it was a counter service restaurant, but we ended up liking it. 蔠e got there about 6:45 on a Friday night and were through the line is less than 20 mins. 蔜he line seemed to stay the same length while we were there, but seating was definitely becoming a problem by 7:30. 蔠hen we go again we'll definitely aim to get there before 7, and plan for a fairly short meal. 蔍t is BYOB which is nice, especially since beer is perfect for washing down smokey brisket. 蔜he liquor store down the street sold mostly American macrobrews and Polish imports, so my preference would be to bring beer rather than planning to pick it up when you're there. Favorite dish: 蔆hopped brisket with baked beans

Picked up some brisket and a half slab of the St. Louis style ribs a week ago. 蔍 think the brisket was great again. 蔍 actually thought it was better than the other 10 times I have gotten it from there. 蔍t did not have much of a smoke ring but it was so tender you could cut it with a spoon. I got the ribs just to see if I would like them, and again, I was not a fan. 蔜hey are dry and don't have a ton of flavor. 蔍 prefer ribs that are moist and I tend to like sauce a lot so please take my comment for what it's worth, it's not a bash in anyway.

The worst part about Smoque is over quickly: finding parking and limited seating. I had the 1/2 Brisket 1/2 Pulled Pork dinner with Cornbread and BBQ Beans with a Peach Cobbler to finish. The pulled pork was decent but the brisket was amazing. I feel like I had never eaten brisket before Smoque! The beans and cornbread were good, but have I talked about the brisket yet?? The staff is great - we had a larger group and they really worked to accommodate us during their dinner rush.

Very good BBQ, authentic St. Louis style. Loved the sides, BBQ beans and mac and cheese. I prefer the pork to the brisket (against popular opinion) but everything tastes great drenched in the sauce. I was lucky enough to go on Saturday before a rush hit. Check it out if you like BBQ. The only other things I would add to my experience is that my friend was a little surprised at the location/appearance of the place. I wasn't too shocked, especially when compared to other "BBQ Shack" places, but yes, we did drive past it before we noticed the little black awning that signaled we had arrived. The prices on everything seemed quite reasonable and would not say I left there hungry. The platter dishes (helping of meat with no bread) comes with two sides for $11 (incl. tax), and sandwiches (including one side) just a couple dollars cheaper. They also appear to have a robust catering organization if you needed another option for feeding the masses. If the #2 ranking on Urbanspoon for Chicago restaurants doesn't say it already, the line out the door at 2pm on a Saturday should be enough reason to check it out.

I came here almost a year ago, and apparently forgot to write a review! I had a pulled pork sandwich, which was pretty tasty, and some mac and cheese, which was super delicious. My friend had some ribs, and he seemed to enjoy them quite a bit. Came here cause it had appeared on Food Network, and I wasn't disappointed. It was cold out when I went, and unfortunately, the restaurant itself was still quite chilly. I don't like cold restaurants because then the food doesn't stay super hot for as long.

We went here before the lunch rush and walked right up to the register and placed our order. Since it was my first visit I wanted to try everything and they made the menu so you could by ordering "tastes" for $3 each. I ordered a full slab of baby backs and a taste of pulled pork and beef brisket. Yes I ate it all. My son got a brisket platter with 2 sides.The baby back ribs are so good no sauce is required. Whatever rub they put on the ribs would be drowned out by the sauce IMO. The pulled pork was moist and had a great flavor (the rub again ?) The brisket was lean and perfectly cooked but lacked flavor, this is where the sauce comes in handy. Next time I go I'm getting the mac 'n cheese that my son recommended to me. They cook it in it's own little tin container and it's so good. The Smoque BBQ sauce didn't work for me, but like I said it may not be needed. I love Heckys sauce. �This place was very clean and well run. If you dine in they will seat you so that say, two people don't hog a whole table for four. Yes you will be rubbing elbows with strangers, so what! Everyones there for good Q! I'm still giving this joint 5 stars even if I wasn't crazy about the sauce and the $3 tastes are a bargain add on.

I'm giving Smoque an extra star just for the delicious smell that permeated our car on the way home. If I could have eaten just that smell alone, I would have been satisfied for the rest of my life. So, I was a liiittttlllee disappointed when I actually got some of that food into my mouth. Just a little bit disappointed. Not ridiculously so. I got a 1/2 slab of the St. Louis ribs, which Smoque recommends as their "most authentic" smoque experience with sides of mac n cheese, corn bread and slaw (I know. You just gained 5 lbs thinking about that, didn't you?) My husband got the pulled pork with sides of the BBQ beans, corn bread and slaw. My ribs were good. I liked the tangy sauce, but I didn't need a lot of it because the meat was smoked well, so it wasn't dry. The meat was tender and while I find the description of meat as "falling off the bone" pretty disgusting, this meat did come off easily without being too fatty. They're really the only reason I am giving Smoque 3 stars instead of 2 (even with the extra star for smell alone). The pulled pork was just ok. I'm biased because my husband makes a delicious pulled pork and I didn't think Smoque's was any better than his. The sides were, well, meh. 蔜he mac n cheese didn't have much flavor to it, and I am not a fan of the bread crumb topping at all. Come to think of it, the corn bread didn't have much flavor either. It was pretty dry and I have had better from a box from Trader Joes. Husband said the beans were good, I thought they were just ok. Honestly, the slaw was pretty bad. I thought I would like it more because it's not too saucy, which is good for me considering that in my version of hell, everything is covered in mayo. But it just wasn't good. The cabbage pieces were too large and again didn't have a good flavor. I took two bites and offered the rest to my husband, who will eat pretty much anything, and even he declined. Oh well. We called ahead and picked it up, so I didn't have to wait in the line out the door when we got there. I just walked right up to the pick up counter, paid my $30 and got out of there. I'm glad I didn't have to wait very long. So, all in all, Smoque was just as the rating says, "A-OK". It's a good option for winter months when you don't want to BBQ yourself, and I prefer Smoque to other BBQ joints I've tried in the city. That being said, Smoque isn't putting Chicago on the map in terms of BBQ, but it will do in a pinch.

Who knew that good BBQ was walking distance from my house?! Smoque is not the best BBQ I have had, I will admit. I used to live in the Carolinas so I have a biased opinion on how BBQ should be prepared and sauced. I haven't tried the pulled pork here, but the brisket was pretty fantastic. It was flaky without being dry and the sauce gave it just enough zing to not be overwhelming. The beans were the highlight of the meal. I don't know what they do to give them that sweet but smoky but tangy taste but two huge thumbs up to the beans. I'll add that the last bit of brisket I had in Chicago, was twice the price and half the flavor, so if you don't have a favorite haunt yet, try this one out.

Little story. I went to Nashville for work and flew to Nashville Airport. On the way back home, I almost got a ticket cuz I was almost late, but somehow, once I got checked in 'n' all, I had plenty of time! So, since I didn't eat lunch, I stopped by this random bar that served food (remember, this is in an AIRPORT). I had their pulled pork, and while their BBQ sauce was about on par with Smoque, the pulled pork itself was DELICIOUS! But this is not a review about Airport Bar Food, this is Smoque. Then I thought to myself, there is no way that an AIRPORT, no matter where it is, can have better BBQ than an established and popular restaurant like Smoque. I've been dying to go back to compare, and finally I did... Tried: (My rating in parentheses) - St. Louis Ribs (8/10) - Pulled Pork (2/10) (Sides) - Mac & Cheese (7/10) - Smoque Chili (3/10) - Slaw (1/10) (Sauce) - Memphis Style (5/10) This time I got a 1/2 slab of St. Louis and the pulled pork. They had a special thing for Smoque Chili, so I subbed that for the beans. Now that I actually have something to compare the pulled pork to, I can safely say that Smoque's pulled pork is bad. It's try and tasteless. It's so bad that the mediocre BBQ sauce actually helps it a lot, but the texture doesn't change and it's just disappointing. Feels like sawdust, your mouth gets dryer eating it. With every bite I compared it to Nashville Airport's and it paled in every regard. Funny, because this is what people say to try when you go. St. Louis Ribs took a small 1 pt dive. Maybe it's because it's not new anymore, I don't know. 8 is still very respectable; problem is, I don't think I'll ever crave Smoque for it. The rib meat itself is great, but I don't want to have JUST ribs, I want sauce, and if the rib meat is good, but sauce sucks, then it just crapsizes the whole experience. All in all, I'm lowering my Smoque rating to 2/5. It really is "Meh" and I really have experienced better. It's not A-OK, and I'm pretty certain that I'll never have a craving for it. In fact, if I'm with a group of people and they all suggest Smoque, I won't adamantly refuse, but I will definitely be the first to offer a new suggestion. Add another one to the Great Chicago BBQ Failure. Next up, Honkeytonk BBQ.

We decided to carry out from Smoque Friday night and am I glad we did! The line was out the door but the hubs was able to walk right in and pick up our dinner. And it was still hot when we got home. I ordered the half St. Louis ribs with mac and cheese and fries and he ordered the full baby back ribs with fries and mac and cheese. In a word, delicious. We have been talking about going here for months and the built up anticipation was definitely worth it! The ribs were meaty and practically fell of the bone. The sauce was tangy and great for dipping fries. The mac and cheese was amazing. I am kind of a snob when it comes to mac and cheese. 蔍 can't stand the boxed stuff and this was far from that. 蔜he portion for the mac and cheese was on the small side but I am not complaining. 蔈ven with the half order, I still had lunch for Saturday.

It was ok, but to me a tad over - rated. I had the pulled pork and Chris had the brisket. It was tender, but without a ton of sauce, we did not find the meat to be particularly flavorful.

I have been here two times and both times ordered the bbq shredded pork sandwich. the pork is moist, delicious and they give you a side of bbq sauce so you can drown the pork in sauce as you please ( which if you are me is a lot). Sides are also delish, the last time i got the beans, perfect for eating on your sandwich, 蔭nd the mac and cheese. The beans were smokey with little nibbles of brisket mixed in. Mac and cheese was very good, but also very rich, i had to abandon ship mid way through. oh and they give you coleslaw with everything. hence the four stars and not five. cole slaw really? go here. do it. your tummy will thank you.

Smoque made me change the way I think about BBQ and I thought I knew it all. 蔍t goes down something like this: First, the type of meat is matched with a particular wood that compliments it (just like how certain wines are paired with different proteins). 蔜hen, the smoking technique comes in, which they have down to a science. 蔉inally, a particular sauce is dressed onto the meat (memphis style for ribs, carolina for pulled pork, etc.). And I thought it was ALL the sauce. 蔍'm wrong and I happily admit it. So I've been coming since it opened and have NEVER had a bad experience. 蔛ervice is quite speedy, despite the long lines, friendly; and the sweet tea (yes, sweet tea), mac n' cheese (just the right amount of sharpness), fries (crispy and not oily) and peach cobbler (sweet/tart) is incredible. 蔈ven the cole slaw has merits all it's own (mostly vinegar with some sweetness and mustard seed for an additional note). I love their BBQ so much it was catered for my 40th birthday party and everyone raved about it. Of all my Chicago BBQ experiences (Fat Willy's, Honey 1, Smokin' Woody's, Smokey Bear's, Gale Street Inn), I would say don't waste your time going anywhere else.

I was recently on a road trip that hit through the Southern part of the United States, and was understandably excited about passing through BBQ country. And indeed, several times we did stop, and have BBQ, whether in Memphis, rural Mississippi, or New Orleans. And through most of it, I was distraught, asking myself "Is this as good as it gets? This, America's most delicious, most celebrated food - this is as good as it gets?" I won't name the restaurants I frequented on this trip (well, maybe in a different review), but I will say that no, that was not as good as it gets, because Smoque was far, far better. Amazing even. I tried the ribs, pulled pork, the brisket, mac and cheese, and coleslaw, and everything was great. The brisket, especially, is a must try. And the smoke flavor of the ribs was phenomenal. Get there early, because there will be a line out the door. Go, go, go to Smoque.

While the staff and service are very good at Smoque, due to small table space, take out is the way to go for Smoque's deliciousness. 蔍 learned to call plenty ahead if you need to pick up your food at a certain time. �My husband and I were taking Smoque's out to a friend's house yesterday -- I called at 2:30 to place an order for a 5:30 pm pick up, and they didn't have any slots left at 5:30. 蔍 got a 5:15 slot, and it was done exactly on time with no wait to pay. 蔄ll the 55 year old guys standing in line waiting to place their orders looked longingly at my efficiently packed brown grocery bag of BBQ heaven. �Now, of course, the food is amazing. 蔠e tried almost everything last night, and my favorite is the brisket (chopped) with the North Carolina sauce. 蔖erfection. 蔛ides -- all great, get the mac and cheese and the cobbler for sure. �Thanks, Smoque!!

My husband and I are huge BBQ fans! I am more of a dry rub type of lady and he is a sauce guy. This place has it both! The meat is great- not dry at all and you can get the sauce on the side (if you ask for it that way) We have visited Smoque at least 3 times now and it is always BUSY!!! You need to get there right as it opens, to not have to wait, but if you are waiting, it moves pretty quick. You should give this place a try- it won't disappoint!

My review is based on the 3 times I have been to Smoque BBQ, By now you are probably thinking ok she liked it because she went 3 times so why did she give it 2 stars? �First of all I was not impressed at all with their BBQ ribs nor with their brisket. The first time I went I ordered the ribs and I did not like their BBQ sauce, it was too tangy and full of Smoque flavor that to be honest it was overpowering for me. Their meat was hard to come off the bone, i felt like i was fighting it off the bone and was more chewy than tender. I did like the mac and cheese I just wish they would serve bigger sides, you can literally pick it all up at once with a spoon. T he second time I had it, my family who lives 3 blocks away from there and heard the great reviews on it decided to order it for Christmas dinner. 蔍 thought hey why not lets give it another try. We called to place an order but they weren't going to be open Christmas eve so we ended up buying frozen ribs from them to try to warm them up at home. BIG MISTAKE. the already "ok" ribs were now awful tasting , to say the least it was not a happy Christmas. So the third time I had Smoque BBQ, my boyfriend surprised me by ordering ribs for pick up there on a Saturday night, we barely made it there before they closed their doors to pick up the food and this time the ribs were the worst i had ever had. I don't know if it was because they were about to close already and they just gave us the last ribs they had, but they were hard full of fat and muscle that you are obviously supposed to take off before you cook, I have made ribs before so I know its sucks and its hard work to take off all the fat and muscle (it also depends where you buy them obviously) We were so disappointed, AGAIN! We swore never to return to Smoque BBQ for ribs, they just were not ribs to be consumed by us, but hey apparently many other people do like them. This was just my experience.

I went to Kansas City on business last year and the one thing I took away from this city is my deep affection for KC barbecue. I had it both days that I was there, and I dreamt about it for months after. My gosh, I crave that barbecue like a crazy person. The delicious smoked flavor of the meat has lingered with me and refuses to let go. So I've bitten my nails, chewed gum, chugged water, and have pretty much done anything to stop myself from jumping on a plane just to have dinner there. Last night, though, I felt like I had returned to the Kansas City mothership when I ordered carry-out from Smoque. The sliced brisket is truly amazing, and both types of ribs are great. It really is smoked BBQ heaven. Also, the mac and cheese (piping hot) rocks and the peach cobbler is the perfect perfect way to finish off the meal. I'd have given Smoque 5 stars-- but I took off a star since I didn't find the restaurant, as a whole, to be perfect (though the food may very well be).

The pulled pork is probably the best I've ever had. I loved the brisket as well, but the last time I got it, it was a little fatty for my taste. Still, I love that you can get "tastes" of the different meats so you can try them all. I always have WAY too much meat when I go here, though. I can see why people say it's the best BBQ in Chicago. The vinegar BBQ sauce is absolutely amazing. The sides are really good too. The mac & cheese and cornbread are probably my favorites. This is not the place if you're looking for a really nice atmosphere. Everyone orders at the counter and the line is usually out the door. After you order, you're eventually seated in the cafeteria-style dining room and your order is put in to be made and brought out on trays. Definitely try to go on a weeknight or at an off time because the experience is just better overall. Plus, parking is a little spotty at busy times. It's BYOB so you can bring a few beers to have with your meal. The smoked meat is totally worth a stop.

I had heard about Smoque from so many people but since I don't have a car, I haven't been able to get there. So last Sunday my friends and I were going kayaking but it started to rain. I lay down on the couch and started to watch the Food Network and Diners. Dives, and Drive-Ins was on and they were featuring Smoque! I started texting...I got an immediate interested and we then got our friend who had just eaten, to drive us to Smoque. The line was out the door and we waited. A long time...about 45 minutes but had very good conversation with other patrons along the way. I finally ordered and sat, waited and then my number was called. Here is the run down: Babyback ribs: tender and moist and semi fall-off-the-bone. The rib size were smaller than I'd had at other places. The bbq sauce is really sweet. I prefer more spice. St. Louis ribs: more juicy, tender and moist and semi fall-off-the-bone. Ribs also smaller than what I am used to. Sides: NOT IMPRESSED AT ALL Mac 'n' cheese: cheese sauce was runny and the bread crumbs were raw. Slaw: seemed like it was just green cabbage, a hair of red onion and vinegar. Brisket chili: watery and the not cooked enough: beans were hard and the spices needed to meld more. I guess I was expecting much more compared to what I'd read (and after seeing the line). A good lesson learned here...I don't need to get all excited up just because a celebrity chef features a restaurant on his/her show.

The meat was excellent but I guess Texas style just isn't my favorite. I like the style of bbq traditionally considered subpar in which both the sauce and meat are integrated; here, they give you little buckets of sauce for dipping, pouring, whatever, and it's fine, but could be better. I also wish the menu offered more combination options, although it IS nice that you can order a "taste" of various meats for ~$3 (and they're pretty generous tastes). But really, overall it's very good. The baby back ribs were a little small, which was fine, and nicely cooked. The pulled pork and sliced brisket had excellent flavors, and the smokiness was balanced without being overwhelming. Parts of the brisket were really fatty, but it was a normal, not weird/gristly, fat. The texas sausage was my least favorite meat, although it wasn't bad. The chili with brisket was tasty but plain, and the macaroni and cheese was probably the best thing I had, and I'm not sure if that is a good or bad sign. Anyway, it's very good, the employees are great and keep the place moving, and we didn't have a wait a little after noon on a sunday but it was filling up as we were there.

WOW! 蔄s far as BBQ goes, Smoque has it covered. 蔠hat a fantastic lunch to have. 蔍 stopped in over the weekend to check it out as I had been wanting to ever since I saw it on "Diners, Drive-Ins and Dives". 蔍 came in with my GF and I decided to try the pulled pork, with a side of beans, then we also ordered a small order of fries and a large mac n cheese. I have no complaints whatso-ever. 蔄nd I have to say, the people around me didn't seem to either. 蔜here was a family of about 7 people, who ordered various items and literally made them disappear within minutes then decided to order a couple pounds of brisket and some ribs and various other items to go. ANYWAY - back to my food, the pulled pork was pulled perfection. 蔍 have never had a pulled pork sandwich that when you took the first bite, you get an explosion of smoquey-ness in your mouth, followed up by that nice subtle pork flavor and BBQ sauce. 蔖henomenal. 蔒Mmmm.. The beans, where could they go wrong, there was so many different flavors and chunks of meat that made these probably some of the best beans I have ever had. The mac n cheese? 蔍 cant even begin to describe. 蔍f you are used to eating Krap Mac N Cheese, this is going to blow you away. 蔜he parmesan crust on the top, and the warm cheesy soft macaroni's are what dreams are made of. And Fresh Cut Fries - how can you go wrong? 蔛easoned to perfection - and for a small, the portions were more then enough for me and the girlfriend. If you haven't been to Smoque, what are you smoquing? 蔊et off your butt and get there for some good eatin'!

Most of what you can know about this place has been summed up here a hundred times - but for my two cents, I have to say that as a Texan, I am happy to report this place is legit. Though the cooking staff isn't wearing boots or cowboy hats, and I was the only one in the joint saying "yall," I still felt like they had captured a bit of the Lone Star State without the 14 hr drive usually required for me to get my BBQ on. The brisket was charred just right, moist & juicy on the inside. 蔍 had it on a sammich with bread almost as thick as Texas toast (which is a good thing). 蔍 also tried the "Texas Sausage." 蔍t was as good as you could get it up here--- with flavor of mesquite wood and a bit of pecan.. it tasted the way I expected -- which is as good an endorsement as any. The sides were a mix of success & failure. My friend had the slaw on his platter-- only average. 蔍 had decent cornbread, but I'll never understand why Chicago bbq places serve their sides in little tin foil muffin cups. Who created this rule? 蔜he mac & cheese is a definite winner - and it's got a lot more flavor & depth than the typical elbow mac with Rico's cheese sauce.. I tasted at least a couple cheeses and the crust was excellent. The clincher? 蔛WEET TEA. 蔣eah, sure, this is probably the least exciting part of the menu to most people, but for me it is a mandatory to have either sweet tea or beer with bbq. 蔜hey had both on the menu. 蔜hank goodness I can count on this place for a bit of back-home goodness between trips to Dallas. Update: Turns out this place is BYOB. 蔛o bring your own Shiner or Lone Star...

Great Barbecue. 蔊ood Sides. The brisket is unlike anything that we are able to get in Milwaukee. 蔠e decided we wanted to go to Smoque, so we made plans to go to the Shedd Aquarium as an excuse to make the drive.

Closest you can get to New Orleans style BBQ. I've been to New Orleans and this is pretty close. We got the different ribs, chicken, and pulled pork. The sides are delicious. I also love the communal benches you eat at. Gives it a neighborhood vibe. I met some interesting people despite having BBQ all over my face. The line is pretty long, but again, the people help make the experience that much more memorable. Three thumbs up. Wait a minute...

What have you done to the fries? 蔍 know, according to your manifesto that you don't feel fries are a good match with BBQ but up until the last visit, they were great. 蔜he latest fries, while tasty, looked like they came out of the Ore Ida bag. 蔔o longer the heavy skin, dark brown, juicy fries that once were. 蔜ell me this was just a substitute due to some supply problem? 蔍 also noticed Barry wasn't around so maybe that had something to do with it. 蔕n the plus side, the brisket and candied jalapenos were outstanding as usual.

When I came here on a Sunday, the front door malfunctioned and managed to lock me out! The place obviously wasn't closed, but no one was interested in coming to the door. Luckily, I had YELP in my phone and was able to call the owner to have him let me in. I guess the 50 or so people inside were too busy slamming down ribs, brisket, and pulled pork to notice me at the door. I can understand why. Friendly people and great food awaits inside.

The food was great. I had the 1/2 chicken platter and it was some of the best bbq chicken I've had in Chicago. Super fast service and ample seating. I do have two complaints though which held back a 5-star rating. They lost one star for being out of pulled-pork by the time I went to eat dinner (around 8:45pm on a Friday). This is understandable as pulled-pork is delicious and in high demand, but they should really plan to have more cooked on a busy Friday night so they don't run out. They lost another star because of the price. The place is run like an upscale Boston Market, where you place your order, hang out for a while until your order number is called before you go get your tray of food and a couple of plastic utensils. I have no problem for this if I'm dropping $7 at a fast food restaurant, but if it's a BYOB self-serve joint I shouldn't have to pay $15+ for a meal. For these prices they should really have wait service and some real knives and forks.

THIS is more my favorite BBQ in the world, so far. I really love the ribs. In fact I was almost regretting I got the brisquit instead of the ribs after I had one of my boyfriends. They give you different BBQ dipping sauces to try out which are all pretty good (some are better than others but it all depends on your tastes). I love the taste of everything though. We got a little bit of pulled pork, which was wayyyyyyyyyyy amazing. I wish I had gotten that on a sandwich. The only ultra crazy thing about all the food is that it's smokey. And I'm talking ULTRA smokey, to the point there's almost too much smoke in it. But that's also what makes it amazing. Their mac n cheese btw? AWESOME! I wish they had bigger portions.

I really liked the food - Mac and Cheese, pulled pork, cornbred, cobbler... tasty tasty. 蔆an't wait to try the chicken. 蔛ome of the best BBQ I have had in Chicago - but I must disclose that I am a novice to this genre of eats. Typically, Carolina style sauce is not really my thing - I would rather a nice thick, sticky, sweet Kansas City style sauce - but this totally worked for me this time. 蔜he whole edible package was damn good. Overall, I can't say that I was excited about the atmosphere... the method of seatings straight stressed me out and it was so minimal I felt as though I were in a cafeteria at a tiny college. The BYOB feature is great, but they are obviously moving people in and out as fast as possible, you get the stink eye if you try to linger drinking beer for too long.

Wow. What can I say bad about Smoque. Probably nothing. Well, the location and parking sort of sucks, but worth the travel. Every time I go to Smoque I get the same thing - Chopped brisket sandwich, side of mac and cheese, and slaw. I have had their ribs, cornbread, brisket chili, and texas sausage in the past, and all were good. If you get the full brisket sandwich, you can get a combo of chopped and sliced. I am sure sliced is wonderful, but I have yet to try it. The meat has such a good BBQ bark that is fantastic. The mac and cheese is individually baked so you get a wonderful crust on top. However, eat this while hot. The deliciousness is directly correlated with the hotness factor. The slaw is great too - mixed with a vinaigrette rather than mayo. Nice tough Smoque. �You might have to wait to get a table, but it is worth it. Great food, great service, and good price for BBQ. Try the brisket chili if you get a chance - you will love it. They are very good about giving samples if you ask! Fries look to greasy for my taste, but I hear they are good ...

In love....I'm not a huge BBQ fan but I do enjoy it on occasion. My friend/co-worker and I needed a new place to go for lunch so we decided to head on down Irving and see what the fuss was all about. I decided to have a 1/2 pulled pork sandwich, fries and peach cobbler...I know..piggy me! I could barely finish the 1/2 sandwich 1/2 of my fries and the cobbler. The fries are those delicious fresh cut friends YUM! The pulled pork was to die for just absolutely yummy!! I like that it wasn't drowned in bbq, they put sauce on the side to let you choose how much you want. The peach cobbler was average but it was good. 1/2 sandwich honestly was PLENTY! They are very organized even though it gets packed!! The guy came and got us seats and everyone was cleaning tables. it's one of those places where you have to eat and go but it's no big deal! I just read a review about it being BYOB...really?? I'll be back many more times (not just because of BYOB) but that is a cool option. First thing I did was run back here to YELP about it.

Went on a Saturday afternoon after seeing this place on 2 TV shows. 蔅ad idea to go then. 蔜he line was out the door! 蔠e could hear everyone talking "I saw it on this show, I saw it on that show." 蔠e wait in line for honestly 30 minutes. 蔕h, and they have a sign on the door saying they are out of one type of rib. Anyways, we finally order then wait some more. 蔠e take the food home as there was no where to sit. 蔜he food was excellent. 蔈verything tasted awesome, right down to the sides. 蔠ell worth the wait, but to avoid the wait, make sure you call your order in first, then it'll be ready for you when you get there. Minus one star because I think the owner was kind of jerky. 蔍t's kind of an open kitchen and he was a real jerk to his employees, then he'd turn around and ask the patrons how they enjoyed their meals.

I'm not a huge meat fan so this wasn't a destination of choice for me until I heard they had award-winning mac n cheese. I'll be honest, the mac n cheese was good, but the brisket chili was the highlight of my meal! It's not a regular side, but they have a special side every day and that was it the day we went. I also had the baked beans which have chopped brisket in it too. Very very good. I must like brisket because I got the brisket platter a la carte too which was alright, but the boyfriend ended up eating it cuz I was too full after all my sides :) I really really wanted the peach cobbler and was told I got the last one! But then when my order came up they said they miscounted and I didn't get any. Boo. They did, however, offer me another side of my choice so I got some texas sausage and a corn bread muffin. The sausage had a hint of heat and was very smokey, I loved it! And the corn bread was a bit sweet but not too sweet and just the perfect amount of grainy corn meal taste. Overall great meal and I'd definitely go back again.

Pros: Excellent BBQ and side dishes (esp. french fries). Friendly staff, food comes out fast. You order at the counter, and then they call your number. Sodas are self-serve unlimited refills. Cons: Parking sucks during lunchtime--all the neighboring streets except one have NO PARKING between the hours of 8-5. Odd, huh? Parking during evening hours must be much better, though. There's a parking lot behind the restaurant that's free after 5 p.m. Also, there's only one BBQ, and it's a bit strong on the vinegar side.

Not sure what else to say that the previous 200+ reviewers have not already said. 蔍 love good BBQ and it is not easy to find good BBQ in the Chicagoland area. 蔍 saw Smoque on Food TV and thought I would stop in to give it a try. While this is not the best BBQ I have ever had, it is some of the best I have found in the Chicagoland area. 蔍 tried a bit of just about everything and thought it was all good quality. 蔜he St. Louis ribs were a bit dry, but tasted good, the pulled pork was good as well and the sliced beef brisket was fantastic and will be my choice next time I stop back in. �Notables are the fantastic sides that are available. 蔜he baked beans, corn break, mac and cheese and peach cobbler are all great. 蔒y only complaint on the sides is that they were rather small so if you really like any of them, you might want to pick up a couple. �One last thing is....be careful where you park. 蔜here is clearly a parking issue for this place as it is located along a residential neighborhood and there are lots of parking restrictions. 蔜here is a lot available behind Smoque bot also be careful there as it only available at certain times. 蔐ots of signs are posted so just read the signs and follow the directions and you should be fine. Worth the trip......good food at a reasonable price. 蔉rom my 1 visit, I suggest the beef brisket, mac and cheese and peach cobbler.

On the way back from spending the morning at the Shedd Aquarium, my husband had suggested we stop here for lunch. I had just bookmarked this place on Yelp after seeing them featured on Diners, Drive-Ins, and Dives Friday night, so I was excited to try the food. It did not disappoint. And keep in mind, this review is coming from someone who normally avoids BBQ since I'm not the biggest fan of it. I had the beef brisket platter with mac & cheese and cornbread. My husband had the pulled pork platter with baked beans and cornbread. Everything was delicious. Even the coleslaw was good, although I prefer the creamy variety (this is more vinegar based). We shared the peach cobbler for dessert which was out of this world. I'd come back here just for the dessert alone. We got there at a good time (noon) - it was busy, but they kept the line moving and there was seating available even though it is relatively small inside. You just have to resign yourself to the fact that your chair is going to get bumped every few minutes since it's pretty cramped. Everyone is in a great mood, though, so I didn't really mind. By the time we finished our meal the line was out the door. :)

This is a solid 4 star place. I have been here several times with 2-10 people. The Bad: The lines are annoying, parking isn't the easiest, and some of the items are not palatable to all people. For me, it's the Mac and Cheese* that is just meh... too creamy, not sharp enough, seems like they use oil instead of butter... the bread crumbs on top add nothing. The Good: On the other hand, I LOVE the lightly vinegared *Slaw. Lower the calories and add some zing! It has always been fresh too. As far as meat goes, I'm in love with the *Beef Brisket. I eat anything fatty and succulent and this perfect cut delivers. It is always tender and spiced well enough to eat alone. I get the sauce on the side. I think the pulled pork is pretty good too. Once, they had *Burnt Ends as a special, which essentially is the fatty end of the brisket cooked and sauced a bit differently. I loved it, but alas it isn't a regular item due to supplier constraints. The Average: The *Corn Muffins and *Baked Beans are average, as well as the greasy *Fries- I love that they use unskinned potatoes for them (think 5Guys). I used to go on weeknights and beat the crowds when I lived in the area, but now that it's a bit of a drive I think it will only be an occasional visit. It is certainly worth at least one visit, because if it is your style of BBQ (esp sauce) then you'll be in love!

Recently we went to Smoque for some carry out (our friends just had a baby so we figured it will be nice to bring them some good eats). One of the owners of the place (or manager) was kind enough to help us maneuver the menu (what to order and how much to order). We ended up having some ribs (both baby back and st. louis), some briskey, baked beans, corn bread and peach cobbler. He also gave us some complimentary texas sausages (he heard me saying how much i wanted to try it) Everything was tasty (esp the sausage and peach cobbler for me) but what impressed me most was how helpful and friendly the owner was. Definitely will go back and this time we will be eating in.

Love no bullshit, finger-lickin' good BBQ? THEN SMOQUE IS GUARANTEED ORGASM IN YOUR MOUTH. -Tender meat. -Out of this world BBQ sauce. -The best sides (they give you what seems like a pound of fresh cut fries that perfectly seasoned, their macaroni and cheese is GODSEND, and their cole slaw is PERFECTION) ...Smoque, can you be my new boyfriend? Tips: - Call ahead. And make sure you do this EARLY. The wait can be for up to an hour. - If you are picking up your food, don't forget to throw in forks, napkins, ketchup, etc...the staff doesn't do that for you. Enjoy. I've seriously never had better BBQ.

Really- I have been to damned near every BBQ joint in the city, as it is the BF's quest. I have my own opinions, but have become willingly educated in the ways of BBQ. And this is it, really. You may as well stop your quest here. Chicago Q's Kobe/Wagyu beef brisket *is* better, but it's from a cow that was massaged with baby oil and fed beer and cornpops or some such. For your non-gold-coast BBQ? This is it.

Um, HELLO? 蔠here have I been? 蔠hy haven't I tried this place before? 蔒y loss. 蔠ent to Smoque because my BF went to grade school with the owner. OMG, can I say DELICIOUS?!?! 蔛o we each order 1/2 sandwich & 1 side - I got the chopped brisket and fries and he got the pulled pork & mac-n-cheese. I have never had a better BBQ brisket sandwich! As we're digging into that we are treated to a full slab of ribs and some of the spicy texas saaaaaasage. I have to say that neither of us are a fan of eating meat off of the bone but the ribs were awesome! 蔜he rub had the perfect blend of sweet & smoky flavors. 蔜he sauce is amazing - If I could buy a vat of it to take home with me I would.

This place is all hype! 蔜hankfully we arrived around 5:45 on a Wed so getting the disappointing meal wasn't as hard as eating it. 蔖arked right outback, walked right in, ordered, and was seated in about 10 minutes. 蔜hats the positive. 蔔ow the food ...... Brisket, not Smokey nor juicy, kind of bland in fact. Pulled pork also lacked smoke and flavor. �Don't try to add flavor to the meat by dousing it in sauce either! 蔜he vinegar based sauce is the work of amateurs. Ribs were only OK. 蔔othing special. The beans had allot of smoke flavor! 蔜he chemical liquid smoke variety. 蔍t was obvious by the texture of the beans that someone was trying to make up for the lack of cook time.

I certainly wish there were half-stars. I took an adventure and went to Smoque, which is walking distance from the Blue line station (Irving Park). I saw the reviews for this place on Cheque Please! and they raved about this place being the best BBQ in the midwest. What impressed me most was the smell and the size of the place - not recommended for large groups during peak hours and very difficult, but doable for families with kids. The limited choices on the menu also told me that they took time into preparing these few things. We ordered the St. Louis ribs with 2 sides and the Half-Half Sandwich. Perhaps it was when we went (late afternoon), but the brisket (chopped only) was dry and the ribs was not as tender. The sides (fries, BBQ beans and Mac and Cheese) was good, but I can't distinguish between gourmet Mac and Cheese and Kraft's. I'm giving it a 3 star because of the potential and because of the home-style cooking (as opposed to pre-processed stuff). I'm hoping on my second visit, the food will be better. The pulled pork was good though.

It's been at least 7 weeks or so since the husband and I have had our favorite BBQ in Austin. 蔜hat's a really long time for us and while making dinner at home and watching DDD, we saved what we were making and headed over there. Unlike TX BBQ places, this one has baked beans, mac' n cheese, french fries, cornbread AND peach cobbler. 蔄 place that finally has sides I like, hooray! I ordered the chicken, mac' n cheese, french fries and a corbread muffin. 蔋oly lord it was amazing. 蔜he rub on the chicken paired with the sauce was perfect and tender. 蔜he mac was a great flavor. 蔄 huge bag of hand-cut french fries were awesome. 蔄nd, then the cornbread muffin, mmmmmmmmm, my god. The husband had their brisket and was loving every minute. 蔋e cleaned his plate, and mine. All this for only $25 in the city of Chicago, hell yeah, we're all up in that! 蔜hank god it's not within walking distance of us, we'd be gaining in no time! We both agree it's better than anything we had while living in Texas. 蔕ne of my best meals yet in the city.

Only one thing possibly captures the amazing experience at Smoque BBQ: OMNOMNOMNOM!!! The St. Louis Ribs were meaty, lean, and well flavored. 蔜he BBQ sauce comes on the side so you can slather as much or as little as you like, and the sauce is top notch so that makes it a hard choice when dealing with meat this good. 蔍 recommend trying it with none, with lots, and then everything in between. My favorite side so far is by far the mac and cheese. 蔠onderfully baked and tasty. 蔜he slaw is a vinegar base, not creamy, and very good. 蔜he beans were good, but not the best I've ever had, but again, they were good. 蔍 want to try the cornbread and the peach cobbler too next time, though I'm thinking I can live and die by the ribs and mac and cheese. For a place that has lines out the door at peak times, they were incredibly efficient in getting people seated and getting food in their bellies. 蔉riendly service at every step in the process. GO EAT HERE.

If you eat alot of BBQ, you know that when you get to a certain level, it's just a matter of preference. �For what smoque is going for .. i've never had better. 蔄nd i love what they're going for. I love the mac'n'cheese. 蔯reamy cheesy, but not too heavy. with some crunchy breadcrumbs on top. 蔍 love the BBQ Beans .. best side ever. 蔍 like the fries, corn bread, and cole slaw. 蔄ll done very well, and they all seem to balance with the meat. The brisket is AWESOME. 蔜he Pulled Pork is AWESOME (still need to try the ribs). 蔣ou can't go wrong. 蔍t's not as fatty as other BBQ's, meaning you can eat a ton and not feel to sick the next day. 蔜he sauce is good in a mellow way - i like it, but i would love if they had a spicer option. The price (value) is pretty good, too. 蔛andwich and fries for like $7 .. or split the platter with your girlfriend and get an extra side or two .. under $20 for both of you. Atmosphere is perfect - casual, but not dirty. 蔆an be a wait, but worth it. Beautiful.

I had high expectations for Smoque. I previously tried to visit the restaurant, but found a line outside and around the building. I kept going. On a Sunday evening at 7:00 P.M., I met friends there and found the line extending just outside the door. It took about 30-minutes to reach the cashier to place our order. There was an employee keeping tabs on the line trying to arrange proper seating for the groups. I counted at least 14-employees, which I find incredible for a restaurant of this small size. I would estimate the restaurant occupies no more than 2,000 square feet. I doubt the seating capacity exceeds 50 - 60 patrons. You place your order with a cashier, find a seat and wait for your number to be called. Once you place your order, there isn't much of a wait. Fountain drinks are self-service and located close to diners. I ordered a sliced brisket sandwich with cole slaw and baked beans. My wife ordered a pulled-pork sandwich with cole slaw and macaroni and cheese. We shared a small order of fries. The brisket was servied on a soft, dinner-style bun. The meat was flavorful, tender and smokey. It wasn't drenched in BBQ sauce, but we were each provided with extra sauce in a plastic container. The sauce is thin and vinegar-based--southern style. The cole slaw is also vinegar-based and very sweet. The baked beans were very smokey--much too smokey for my taste. The french fries were fresh cut and served in a small paper bag. They were excellent, except this batch was over salted. The pulled pork was flavorful with a nice crust of bark. Our tab was under $23.00. Perhaps my expectations were too high, but I had hoped for a better dining experience. With painted concrete floor and metal roof ceiling, the crowded restaurant was loud and difficult to carry on a conversation. Although a patron standing in line interrupted our meal to ask about the french fries. Barry, one of the owners, stopped by to ask how everything was. He was friendly and proud of his food and spoke about their efforts to maintain consistency. How to improve things (IMHO)... Find a larger location with adequate parking. It took ten to fifteen minutes to find a place to park on the street and another thirty minutes to reach the cashier to place my order. Cut back on the smoke a little--especially on the baked beans. My guess is they're using liquid smoke in the beans and it's overwhelming. While Hank Hill is at the other extreme with, "Taste the meat, not the heat." Smoque has too much smoke for my taste.

You'll have to wait in line probably, it's counter service. But it's very delicious. We split St. Louis ribs, pull pork, mac&cheese, fries, baked beans, cornbread, and the peach cobbler.

What can I say that hasn't been said?? I *always* get the brisket (usually sliced), cos if I'm eating out and paying, I'm generally gonna go beef over pork. 蔅ut don't get me wrong, the pulled pork is fab, too. My preferred sides are the corn bread and fries -- you get more fries than you know what to do with and they're a nice-thickness of fresh cut potato. 蔆obbler is good, as are the beans and mac & cheese. 蔆ole slaw comes standard with just about every selection and is amazing -- it's vinegar based with red onions in it; and one day I'm going to re-create it in my kitchen, I swear! Brisket frequently runs out on Fri-Sun nights, so I try to go either daytime or weekday evening.

OK, so was the food at Smoque worth the 45 minute wait? �..Kinda? 蔍 guess? 蔍 mean, don't get me wrong. 蔜he St. Louis style ribs were perfectly done--meaty, tender, and not swimming in fat. 蔜he chopped brisket (yes, I got ribs with a side of brisket--you wanna make something of it?) was moist and full of flavor. 蔅ut 45 minutes in line? 蔙eally? 蔠hen there are so many other great rib joints, even on the northwest side? 蔔ext time, I'm definitely calling ahead. 蔛ome things are worth the wait, but some things just require better planning.

Even a block away you smell the smoke coming from smoque! And it's simply calling out to you to go in . . . . I always go for the half and half sandwich of pulled pork and sliced brisket. Its just the perfect combination of heat paradise sandwiched in a bun. The brisket is cooked really slow and it simply melts in your mouth. The sauce has the right mix of tangy, sweet and sour mix that just complements the meat. One time I was shocked to see a line piled up outside the store and took more than 45 minutes of a wait. Was I pissed? Yes I was! I was hungry and I was going for takeout! But when I finally got home with my treasured meats in a bun, it was worth the wait. They should expand the store and open up on mondays!!!

Why can't Smoque be closer to downtown? There aren't many BBQ establishments downtown, so on a warm Friday afternoon I decided to venture North and West from downtown to find what this place had to offer. Consensus: It's amazing just as everyone before me has already stated. The meat was so amazingly tender. Cole slaw which I generally despise (ew mayo and cabbage?) was very very good as they use a vinaigrette. Fries? Awesome. Mac N Cheese? Just as you would expect. If you're driving definitely park on Pulaski because there aren't too many other options. Why oh why are you not closer to downtown?

We parked down the street in a residential neighboorhood and as we opened the door, we could smell the smoke. The food was delicious. I really wanted to try the St Louis ribs but there was a sign at the register stating "due to quality concerns, we are currently not serving St Louis Ribs", which totally bummed me out. I had the 1/2 slab baby backs meal with came with the best slaw I ever had and 2 sides. I chose the BBQ beans and mac & cheese. 蔜he beans were amazing. My husband had the pulled pork meal with slaw, BBQ chili, and corn bread. I also orded a "taste" of their brisket. The brisket melted in my mouth. The sauces were on the sweeter side and the brisket sauce was thinner and I even drank it out of the cup. I can't wait to go back. Dinner with 2 sodas cost us $37, but it was worth every penny.

Smoque is a slightly above average bbq joint. 蔜he brisket is phenomenal and the ribs are good. 蔍 even tried the mac & cheese and peach cobbler and they are both adequate substitutions to what I'm used to. It's difficult for me to give and fast food bbq joint high ratings since I grew up on the south side and my uncle made the best bbq ever so my standards are extremely high. 蔄lso, my granny makes awesome cobbler and my aunt makes the best mac & cheese hands down so compared to these, Smoque is OK.

Finally went there today for the first time. 蔠e've heard a lot of people raving about Smoque's and read the excellent reviews and couldn't wait to try it. �We decided to stop there for lunch today because we were in the neighborhood. 蔅oth of us were somewhat disappointed. I had the sliced beef brisket sandwich. 蔜he beef brisket had very little flavor. 蔍t did have a small smoke ring around it, but the smoke flavor and rub never saturated the beef. 蔍t also was fatty (fat makes me gag, so the 3-star rating, which should be 2.5.) 蔜he BBQ sauce was thin and didn't have much flavor. 蔜he meat was sliced thicker than I'm used to, but was very tender and falling apart. 蔍 think the fat made it juicy. 蔛o if you like fat, you may like it. My friend had the pulled pork sandwich, and told me that it definitely wasn't the best he's had. �The coleslaw was excellent. 蔜he chili side dish was also very good. Portions were plentiful, but we compared it to other BBQ restaurants we went to in the suburbs, and didn't think Smoque's lives up to its reputation. Atmosphere is nice for a city restaurant. 蔖arking isn't easy because of permit parking in the neighborhood (OK, I'm spoiled living in the suburbs!!) 蔜he staff was very nice and attentive. We were disappointed to spend $20.00 for lunch without drinks, and not thoroughly enjoy it. By the way, I've been to Austin, TX several times and have had the BBQ there. 蔔o comparison. 蔒eat there was smoked throughout, flavor was throughout the meat and the BBQ sauce was delicious. �Maybe we hit it on an off-day? 蔋owever, I don't think we'll try it again. 蔠e have several BBQ places closer to home that we think are better.

Me and a friend of mine went there last Saturday night night after hearing about the joint in a couple of papers and online. We drove up to the place and we could tell by the fine smells in the parking lot that it was going to be good. The line was out the door but moved surprisingly fast. We didn't realize until we got halfway through the line that it was BYOB, but luckily some nice dudes in front of us had an extra cold, six-pack of fat tires in their car they gave us.... i was sad to say they were out of most everything-- pork, st. louis ribs, and others-- they were kind enough to let us know before we got in line, but we stayed anyways. I got the chopped brisket platter and my buddy got the full slab of baby back ribs. the food comes to you on unpretentious trays and everything is nice and tidily packaged up for you. that is, until you eat. for me, my typical method of attack is to save the main entree for last and hover around the sides for a bit to warm things up. I got baked beans, mac n cheese and cole slaw... and it was good! baked beans probably some of the best I've had... they were sweet and tangy with huge chunks of meat and a great texture. I could have had a tub of those and been satisfied. 蕋he mac was pretty decent and the cole slaw was exactly the way it should be: fresh ingredients with a nice vinegary kick. on to the meat: my brisket was good. I wouldn't say amazing. It had a really good smoked flavor, even without the sauce. The meat was cooked well... but the sauce really added to the flavor. I believe they had a north carolina sauce for the brisket which had a great balance of sweetness but wasn't too tart, and didn't overwhelm the flavor of the brisket. I'd say for me it was more than above average for sure, but no grand slam however. but my buddy's baby back ribs and sauce: muy rico!!!! the lady said they used a Memphis-style sauce that had just a hint of spices that really hit spot and the meat was fantastic. I like the fact that the ribs had simultaneously a slight crispy outside and fall-off-the-bone quality 蔵nside. it was wonderful, even without the sauce. we feasted quite heartily and after knocking down a few beers left Smoque completely satisfied and hopefully I'll be back for a second visit sometime soon. a word on the service: it was really busy and since you order, get a number and wait for it to get called to go up to the counter to get your food, it had the potential to get really crazy and disorganized. But the few fellas that were helping guide traffic not only did a good job, but they were really friendly and genuinely wanted to make ur dining experience better. one of the guys got a bottle opener for our beers and opened the bottles himself... even though we would have done it ourselves. anyways, I'm not prepared to say just yet that smoque lives up to the hype, but so far so good. Its definitely worth checking out!

Went here yesterday with a friend who says the beef brisket was terrific. 蔍 respect my friends judgment in part 蔮ecause he has eaten bbq pretty much all over the US. 蔍 was excited to say the least. �The place is pretty minimal, which is good when it comes to bbq, you don't want to look around and see a pair of snowshoes or fake deer head with Mardi Gras beads on it (bad sign your in tgi Friday's). �The Brisket was great, it was moist, tender and had that ever important smoke ring all around the top. 蔜he smoke ring is evidence that the meat has been slow cooked throughout the day/night and that the beef will retain alot of the flavor. �I also though the ribs were pretty decent as well, very tender off the bone. 蔜he sides cornbread, fries, baked beans were good as well. 蔍 would recommend getting the brisket sandwich and mix and match some sides or maybe another meat dish. �Price was reasonable $10-$14 per person but you expect to pay that for bbq that is done well. Very good place, they get the food to you quick and the sauce is mighty tasty.

Some friends took me here after seeing it on Diners, Dives, and something on Food Network. 蔜he huge line going out the door and around the corner told me that it would definitely be worth the wait. �Order your food off the wall, pay, and wait for a table to open up, most likely next to some strangers, but that's ok! 蔛ervice is great. 蔜he workers are super nice and helpful and make sure you have a table when your food comes up. 蔈verything we ordered was absolutely great. 蔍 love bbq but usually am not a fan of pulled pork and brisket and the like because it's usually either too dry or too saucy, but it was excellent here. I tasted a bit of everything, courtesy of my friends and all of the meat dishes were good. 蔒eat was very tender, never dry and the bbq sauce is excellent, and I'm really picky about my bbq sauce. 蔜he sides were good as well- cole slaw, mac and cheese and baked beans almost trump the meat itself. 蔔o matter what you order, you will not be disappointed. �Food- Awesome. 蔮etter ribs, chicken, bbq than most steakhouses and bbq places Price- Decently priced- average Service- Surprisingly great service for a little hole in the wall place Parking- I think there was a small lot behind the building, also street parking

Now, one may be wondering what a personal trainer is doing at Smoque - right? 蔍'm also HUMAN! 蔖lus, the hubby makes some kick-butt ribs so I took him with me to see if we could find a suitable alternative for when he is tired or out of town... So, let me first say, the only thing remotely "healthy" on the menu is the coleslaw. 蔜hank the good Lord they make it with more vinegar than mayo (yuck -mayo?) 蔍 gotta say, all was good. 蔋ad the briquet (sp?) chilli which was fab, didn't dare touch the mac-n-cheese, the corn bread was perfect since it didn't have a ton of corn kernels in it (I hate it when it's like that!!), all the meat seemed to fall of the bone and into the mouth. Now, I didn't LOVE the bbq sauce but I didn't hate it. 蔍 just think that it coulda been better given it's a bbq place. Overall? 蔔ot worth the wait in those hideously long lines we see when we drive by (unless you're getting take out) and they seem to be creating some order out of the chaos of staying in to eat, but it was a very decent meal. Gotta go now...have to get my butt on a treadmill @ 6.9 mph minimum for 45 minutes. 蔖LUS the gauntlet stairmaster, level 10 for 20 min. PLUS, I will be tired as I have maxed out my caloric intake for at least 2 days....

YUM. There was a line to the door around 7:30 on a sunday night (they close at 9). No problem getting a table once we ordered. I had the 1/2 pulled pork and 1/2 chopped brisket sandwich. They were out of coleslaw, so they gave me my one side (really good crunch flavory fries) and threw in a peach cobbler for free. The cobbler may have been the best part of the meal - save room. As my friend noted, they use real peaches, not Del Monte fake ones. The pork was fantastic. I probably will get the sliced brisket (not chopped) next time, to have a better ratio of smoky beef to charred outer layer (though some will surely prefer more char). Definitely worth the trip, and it's a short walk from the Irving Park blue line.

Food was OK. 蔒y boyfriend loved the brisquet, 蔋is ribs were average. 蔒y pulled pork was just OK. 蔔o real complaints about the food, but the atmosphere sucks. 蔠e waited in a long line to eat at a place with as much personality as a Taco Bell. 蔍'd rather hunt for parking at Smoke Daddy's and have a beer and maybe listen to some music. I would have to submit this place as one of the most white washed places I've been to in a while. It felt really suburban. 蔕n top of that, we had to listen to two guys next to us use the phrase "amazing" at least half a dozen times. 蔙eally, amazing? 蔜hey must not eat out much. 蔍f you live nearby, go, and take the food to go. 蔕therwise, eat at a place closer to home.

I haven't been back to this place since shortly after it opened, as the line lately is too long to justify eating there. 蔠henever I want to go, I never seem to have the time to wait. 蔒aybe I'll make some on my birthday this year. I first heard about this place in Chicagoist. 蔜he review caught my eye when they called Smoque out for its pretentious name and painted-on faux-bbq shack chic. 蔜hey wanted desperately to give them a bad review, but had to remain honest when they tried the food. I couldn't help but get a bit everything the first time. 蔜he brisket was as good as I remember from Texas. 蔜he ribs came easily off the bone but weren't soggy with too much sauce. The chicken came out of the oven black as night but was as tender and white on the inside as Britney Spears. Throw in some crumbly corn-muffins and gooey, doughy, crusty-baked peach cobbler, and you have yourself a line out the door from open to close, every single day of the week. 蔅ring some Shiner Bock to this BYOB. I look forward to going back. 蔍 hope success hasn't changed them.

I know a BBQ place has promise when they serve BBQ on butcher paper rather than plates. Another sign that it might be good is a stack of wood in the back. Smoque is a very good BBQ place that doesn't try to do everything, but what it does, it does pretty well. Brisket, pork or ribs come in either sandwich form or just meat on paper. Sweet tea is always a great pairing with BBQ, so is BYOB...haha Parking however can be a little tough.

Smoque is BBQ done right! �The food I had - brisket, baked beans, and corn bread - was amazing. 蔍 know this is going to sound silly, but you could really taste the smoke...and that's a good thing! I was amazed by how much the staff seems to enjoy working there! 蔈veryone seemed to be having a great time. 蔜hey got a thumbs up in my book when I was waiting for my to-go package and made a comment to my friend that the fries looked amazing. 蔅efore I knew it I was given a little cup full of fries to eat while I waited. 蔜hat is great service, people! The ONLY downside to this place is that seating is limited. 蔣ou have to wait in line, place your order, and then find a seat. �In terms of BBQ in Chicago, I'm certain this place is tough to beat!

I'd have to say this is my favorite BBQ place in the city. Beats Smoke Daddy's and Fat Willy's. For the pricier amount, you definitely get large portions. I can't say I've had everything there, just the pulled pork and half chicken. However, both were mouth watering and could only get better if you were with someone who knew how to grill or getting the BBQ food on the street going towards a Notre Dame game. Sides are pretty large too and excellent tasting. For instance the large bag of seasoned fries you get, totally worth the money. Lines can get long, but they're pretty organized about seating. They've had employees direct you towards open tables. Also, BYOB. While eating there the first time, I saw a man waiting in line with a Heineken 蕀ini-keg all to himself, and not holding back the drinking while waiting. I'm meaning to go back and try that too.

Really, what's the hype? I would assume that most of the 5-star reviewers have never tried barbecue from Kansas City or Texas. On a Saturday afternoon, there was about a 30 minute wait for carry out, which wasn't too bad. I ordered a chopped brisket platter with mac & cheese. The brisket was decent, and had a mild flavored sauce that was a little too bland for my liking. The mac & cheese was pretty damn good, but seriously...it's mac & cheese. Kinda' difficult to mess up. Overall it was good...just nothing that I'd go out of my way to get. Will I return? Possibly, assuming I'm in the neighborhood and there isn't a wait. So, probably not.

Soooo, a group of friends decided to celebrate a birthday here on a Saturday night. 蔔ot the best idea since that is when this place is most busy! 蔠e arrived to find a line outside of Smoque and half way down the block! 蔊ood sign since that means it's loved; bad sign since we have to wait in that line. Thankfully the guest of honor (Hi, Nickolas!) was 45 minutes late so by the time we got to the front, they arrived. 蔍f you are carrying out, no worries: you place your order and leave. 蔍f you dine in, however, it's a bit complicated. 蔣ou basically wait for your seat and when you have a seat they then put in your order and food arrives in about 15 minutes time. 蔠ith a group of 10 in a place that seats 50 (max) and has a continual line of people, that is when it gets tricky. 蔅ut the workers were great and seated us as quickly as possible. Now to the good stuff: the food!!! 蔍 ordered the pulled pork sandwich which was amazing! 蔍 also tried the brisket which was pretty good (not a big brisket fan). 蔉riends ordered the ribs and FYI, there is really no difference between the St. Louis and Baby back (from what they could tell). 蔜he sides I tried were: 1) Mac & Cheese - This is not like the mac & cheese I am used to. 蔍t's different. 蔜oo different. 蔍 am not a fan. 2) Baked Beans - Good stuff if you like baked beans. 3) Corn Bread - Yummy for my tummy! 蔜his was my favorite especially since it is done correctly. 蔍t's sweet, just like me! :) 4) Peach Cobbler Pie - I thought it was great. 蔍t has oatmeal on top which gives it a yummy crunch. 蔍f that's not your style you won't like this (but I loved it!) Smoque is definitely the standard for bbq in Chicago!

I am not a BBQ fanatic, but I am a food fanatic. 蔍 have a good palate and have eaten everything and everywhere from 5 star dining to food trucks in 3rd world countries. And Smoque is just smokin'. I'm qualified to say this just after one visit while on a Business trip to Chicago because my colleagues and I literally tasted one of everything on their entire menu. Platters and platters of Brisket, Roasted Chicken, Lt. Louis Ribs, Baby Back Ribs, Pulled Pork, Sausage, Mac and Cheese, Baked Beans, Corn Bread, Slaw and Cobbler came out with delish BBQ sauce and the owner's private stash of candied jalapenos. The brisket was amazing with the jalapenos... so tender it was literally melting in your mouth and you didn't need any sauce what so ever. The pulled pork was utterly succulent. 蔍 ate this with a bit of their BBQ sauce with chopped up jalapenos. 蔠e finished this off entirely. Baby Back Ribs vs. St Louis? 蔍 thought they were both amazing, but I loved the St. Louis the most. 蔜he ribs had more meat on them and they were juicier. 蔜he Rub they put on the ribs are so tasty they barely need any sauce either. I didn't get to try the roast chicken, but my colleagues loved it. 蔠hen we realized we hadn't ordered the sausage, the owner brought our group a sampling of it. 蔄 little spicy, totally fatty and delicious. AND THE SIDES! 蔄ll I can say is fresh hand cut fries, baked beans with chucks of yumminess (bacon, onions, BBQ sauce, etc) corn bread with real corn, and cobbler to die for. The only suggestion I have is that Smoque start carrying vanilla icecream for the cobbler. Yum. 蔍'll be back.

Wow this place is great. Can they open in MA? I had the pulled pork sandwich with a side of chopped brisket, mac and cheese, and cornbread. 蔖ulled pork was great really meaty and good flavor. The sauce on the side was great, good flavor and a little tart. Great on the pork. The brisket was the best I've had to date. Not too fatty and very juicy. The flavor was wonderful. Cornbread was moist and wonderful as well as the hot cheesy cracker crust mac. �I just wish I had room to try the fries, chicken and ribs!

We were looking for a place to pick up food for my husband, the kids and myself. We came upon Smoque. I ordered the pulled pork sandwich and my husband had the 1/2 brisket, 1/2 pulled pork, and the kids had the mac and cheese. The meat was so tender and the sauce that comes with it was so good. My only regret was that I had to eat it fast and couldn't savor this tasty delight! The kids inhaled the mac and cheese and even my 1 yr old went to town on the stuff. I couldn't give 5 stars because I didn't dine in and my husband went in 蕋o pick up the food! Next time, I'm going in!!!

Best BBQ in Chicago - hands down!!! 蔠e talked to the co-owner Al who was totally awesome. 蔛moque goes through about 500 pounds of brisket per day so you know there are lots of fans of this establishment! �Al recommended the half-and-half sandwich which is half pulled pork and half brisket.... that way you get to try both! 蔍t was TOTALLY awesome, but I think I liked the brisket best. 蔊et both the BBQ sauces so you can see if you like North Carolina style (vinegar) or Memphis (tangy) better. 蔜he fries, cornbread and slaw were perfect accompaniments. 蔍 tried my dates mac 'n cheese and thought it was only so-so but I'm not a huge mac 'n cheese fan anyway. It's BYOB so be sure to bring a bottle of your fav wine/beer.

I think pretty much has already been said, that can be said about this place, but I'm going to throw in $0.02 anyway! No off-street parking, and on-street parking close to the door is prohibited by signs that say "No Smoque Parking". 蔜he side street had little un-signed parking as well. we however, drove around the block, through the alley, went South on Pulaski and parked in the spot closest to the door. 蔍 suspect we were pretty lucky. If you have read many of my reviews, you know that my once-a-week lunch buddy and I go after the lunch rush is over. 蔠hen we arrived, the place was full, but as soon as we placed our order, tables were available. Unfamiliar with the place, I appreciated the helpfulness of the host as far as the menu. 蔜hey have the menu on a huge blackboard, but he asked me if I would like a pring menu, which I did. 蔍 had already decided I was going to try the sliced brisket, so ordering was effortless. I ordered the fresh-cut fries for my additional side. 蔍 got my cup of ice water and was seated. 蔍 think within about 4 or 5 minutes of sitting down, my order # was called. I really haven't had any really good BBQ brisket this side of Amarillo,TX but I would say that Smoque came close to being like you find all over TX. 蔜he BBQ sauce was more TX-like than you get at most places. 蔒ost places seem to run to a Southern style sauce. 蔜he only thing wrong with the brisket was that it was over-done. I could have eaten it without teeth. 蔍 like my brisket to be a bit chewy. 蔔ot tough, but chewy tender. 蔜he slaw was over-vinegary. 蔜he fries were great! My buddy had the St Louis ribs, with mac & cheese and fries for sides. 蔋e said that the ribs were quite tasty, nice and meaty, and while not cooked so that the meat was falling off the bone, it was close to that. 蔋e didn't care for the BBQ sauce and said he preferred Sweet Baby Ray's. His thoughts about the slaw and fries mirrored mine. �For as fast as the turn over is, I didn't feel we were being rushed to leave as soon as we were finished eating. 蔛o all in all, I'll go 4 stars. Being a far-NW Suburb guy, I can't say that it was so remarkable that I'd go back any time soon though. 蔅esides, life is so short and there are so many other places to try.

Finger licking good. Call ahead and pick up your order! It's by far the best way to avoid lines that snake out the door and crazy crowded tables.

this place is the bees knees. the pulled pork and brisket are to die for and the sauce is drinkable. underrated part of the meal: their coleslaw. no one raves about coleslaw but theirs is the perfect twinge of tangy. only drawback is the location but if you have a car in the city -- this is a must do. don't expect any frills - this is down and dirty bbq at its finest.

Yea, so we fell for it. It was on tv, we had to go. Well, and at the time we lived like 2 blocks away so we were shocked to have never noticed the place before. At first it was exciting. The smells were good, the place was small but wasn't packed, and the prices seemed fair. Well, the brisket is good but not the 'omg best ever'. Still better than Famous Daves. The brisket chili, however, is amazing. The mac n cheese...doesn't even hold a candle to Kumas or even my own home made. I think the breadcrumb topping tastes like burnt grated parmesan more than anything. The bbq sauce itself is fairly good, but Im not sure I get the hype on that either. My dad thinks its the greatest bbq hes ever experienced and is always bugging me to bring it to WI with me when I visit. I think hes just fallen for the hype of television. Oh, and picking up an order is better than eating there. It may not be fresh but at least you're not eating in an extremely crowded tiny place on a wobbly sticky table.

My favorite BBQ joint. 蔠ell I guess at least until I try some down South. 蔅onus that Smoque is close to my neighborhood. Half and half sandwich (pulled pork/brisket), baked beans and peach cobbler is my regular order. 蔠ith bites of ribs off my husband's plate. Minus one eensy weensy star for running out of stuff. 蔄pparently their smoker capacity can't keep up with demand. 蔋opefully they will get more room for more meat asap. Most of the 4-5 star reviews have summed up my feelings about the place, so I'll just share some tips from my experiences: Mid afternoon here is the best time to dine in. 蔜hey will likely have short lines and all menu items available. �Call in for carry-out if you want the stuff at peak times. �Don't eat in if you don't like eating next to a stranger. 蔅ut you know, a stranger here is a BBQ loving friend you haven't met yet. �There has always been an owner there in my experience. 蔍f you have any problem, look around to find one/ask if you need to.

When you come to a place like this it is hard to decide what to get the first time. 蔠e have been wanting to come here since we heard about it and finally had the chance to go there. We arrived about 5pm on a Sunday and did get into a parking spot in the lot just west of the building they are in. 蔠e had to stand outside about 5 minutes before getting inside and then I guess it was about 20 minutes (maybe a bit longer) before placing the order. 蔅ut the time is welcomed as you are trying to figure out what you want. We decided on a 1/2 x 1/2 of the baby back and the st louis. 蔍 am not sure the difference but the longer chewier ones I liked better. 蔜he only thing I would knock on the ribs is that the flavor of smoke for me was slightly more intense than I liked but I would positively make the drive to come here just for the food. We also did the Add a taste for like $3 where you can get the brisket or pulled pork. 蔜he brisket you get a choice to have it sliced or chopped and we got chopped. 蔍 think I would have preferred sliced but it was good. 蔍 liked the pulled pork better than the brisket. 蔍t seems that with BBQ it is hit and miss on the pulled pork and brisket. We did both. 蔛ides we got: Fries (Excellent)/Mac n Cheese (Excellent but kids did not like) and the Corn Bread (excellent). 蔍 heard a couple of people by us saying something about the peach cobbler so I which I would have tried that but I guess it gives me a reason to go back. The service here was outstanding. 蔜he owner is constantly sizing the situation and planning where everyone will sit. 蔋e is also making sure that everyone is happy. 蔕thers are working to make sure the tables are turned quickly but in no way do you feel pressured.

After reading about this place on yelp, I decided to check it out, as I love BBQ. 蔍 got the sampler plate with pulled pork, brisket, and ribs. 蔍 found the brisket a little dry and the ribs weren't very tender. 蔜he pork, however, was very tasty. 蔜he sauce was good, with a nice smoky flavor. The service was very good. 蔄lthough there is a small seating area and it was crowded for lunch, the staff was very friendly and found a place for myself, wife, and son with a high chair. 蔕verall decent BBQ, but there are better places much closer to where I live.

Have you ever contemplated working at a particular restaurant just to be closer to the food you loved? 蔍've often thought of approaching the owners of Smoque and asking them if they would pay me in barbecue. 蔣ou can't go wrong with this place. 蔣ou can order anything off the menu and be salivating while eating because it's that good �Let's start off with the sides. 蔍 never was a baked beans fan, but now I'm a believer. 蔜heir brisket chili is killer awesome, their Texas sausage is spicy and delicious and their homemade mac-n-cheese makes me want to cry tears of joy. Main Course? 蔜heir St. Louis ribs are so tender and marinated to perfection that the meat just pulls away from the bone. 蔜heir brisket is just as tender and so wonderful. 蔔ot to mention, they do everything right with their barbecue sauce. 蔛ometimes I envision just slathering their barbecue sauce on everything I eat... The place is always packed, so you may be standing in a small to rather large line. 蔕ne time, we had called in an order to pick up at 5:30pm, but they told us it wouldn't be ready till 7pm. 蔠hen we got there, the line was out the door and around the side of the building. 蔍 was so glad we called for take out, but I would have stood in line for this barbecue. This place is a definite must. 蔄nd if you find out if they will pay me in barbecue, please let me know.

Hands down the best Brisket this side of Texas -- just make sure you get it sliced and not chopped. 蔜he brisket is already "fork tender" and that's with plastic forks so if you get it chopped it turns out a bit mushy. The sides are yummy as well; I especially like the peach cobbler and the mac and cheese. 蔜he fries are fresh cut and large enough to share with a friend. What's not to like? 蔍t's very busy -- especially during during the lunch hour so it can take quite a while to be seated. 蔍f you go with a group larger than 3 or 4, expect to stand around a long time (i.e. 30 min) waiting for a table.

We picked up some pulled pork and some brisket for a concert at Ravinia. 蔠e also got some baked beans and cole slaw. I can't say enough about how fantastic the pulled pork was. 蔍t was juicy and tasty and complex. 蔜he barbecue sauce was tart and vinegary and really perfect. 蔍 thought the baked beans were great too. 蔜he brisket was well cooked and tasty. 蔍'll pass on the cole slaw next time though.

I thought this place was going to be awesome. Me and my bf shared the baby back ribs and a pulled pork sandwich. Both were a little too fatty for my liking, but my bf absolutely enjoyed it. so to each his own. Maybe its just my personal preferences but... I do not enjoy the texture of fat. I've had ribs, pulled pork b4 that didnt have this texture and i enjoyed it, but not at Smoque. On the up side, the sides of mac n cheese and fries were phenomenal. I doubt i'll be going back

Smoque popped my BBQ cherry. 蔍 had had a little experience with BBQ before Smoque, but I'm offically a BBQ brat now. 蔍 mean if this is your first REAL BBQ experience, what the hell can POSSIBLY stand up to it? 蔜he brisket is so good, I'm literally drooling thinking about it. 蔜he staff here is great too. 蔕ne of my first times here we were asked to move for a larger party, and gladly did so. 蔕ne of the staff gave us free food (Sausage, that was pretty damn good though I'd never order it with the brisket on the menu!) for being so courteous! 蔄++! 蔣ou really don't find good service around very much any more, but Smoque delivers on ALL fronts. 蔆ome hungry, leave happy. �Their sides are ridiculous too. 蔜he mac and cheese is breaded on top, and comes in an itty bitty little cup, but I can't stop ordering it! 蔜he fries are really damn good too. ��My only complaint is that this place isn't in NW Indiana!

Ok, so after numerous recommendations to dine here, I finally did so. 蔠hat was I waiting for???? 蔛OOOO delicious. 蔣ou're definitely missing out if you don't take the time to try their St. Louis ribs! 蔍t will become the basis in which you judge the rest of the ribs you ever try in your life time! Seasoning is perfectly tasteful and meat so tender.

food 5 stars!!! I absolutely loves the food. 蔜he pulled pork was better than I have ever had at any Texas Style BBQ and let me tell you that is a whole genre' in the South. 蔜he beans where fresh and plump and their sauce was tangy. 蔉or somebody that rarely likes coleslaw I gotta say that it was fresh, light, and without mystery sauces that give me the heebie-geebies. 蔜he staff was friendly and curt. The seating was set up in such a way that my lunch partner and I had to sit on opposite sides of a very long row like were participating in a rib-eating contest. 蔜he decor is boring and unimaginative but the place is small and we did come for the food. 蔜hey also have created more traffic at the soda fountain than needed by providing people with 12 oz cups which boggles my mind in a "bigger is better" style of food. 蔜ake their food to an an investor and interior designer and this idea could go franchise.

Finally took a little trip to Smoque BBQ on a Sunday afternoon (11:45am) and it was busy but not lines out the door busy. 蔠as able to find parking in the back lot. Big blackboard for the menu. Boyfriend and I ordered the St. Louis Ribs and Brisket. I am in love with the Brisket! This was my 1st time trying it and not my last! Soo yummy and tender, melt in your mouth good! The ribs were pretty yummy too but I have had other ribs that I like better. Sides got the mac and cheese it was yummy, fries were good too! Tried the peach cobbler.. didn't really care for it but my boyfriend enjoyed it. The seating is kind of cramped but they do a good job of seating people.

Smoque is a great neighborhood BBQ joint. It has some very nice smoked food and a BYOB policy so you can leave without spending much at all. I would recommend the ribs and sausages. They are very nice. My wife really enjoyed their mac and cheese as well. Overall, this is a nice neighborhood joint and if you don't have access to your own BBQ grill or smoker a nice place to go.

After years of using Yelp, this is my first review because I was compelled to share how great my experience at Smoque was tonight. 蔍t was my second time there, and I'd been anticipating this meal for almost a year. In short, we ordered everything on the menu and everything was absolutely delicious. 蔜he brisket was juicy and smokey, though unfortunately, we ordered the sandwich, which soaked up most of the moisture; order the platter. 蔜he pulled pork was moist, soft and had just the right amount of sauce. 蔜he ribs were perfectly done. 蔒y personal favorite were the baby backs, which had the right combination of smoke and sweetness. 蔍 don't think we used the sauce more than once. 蔜he Texas sausage was a bit underwhelming, but went better with the sauce than the ribs did. The best part of the evening was that, near the end of our meal, another couple asked us (very politely) if we were almost done, so they could have our seat (the place was very packed and there was a line outside the door for seating). 蔄pparently, the staff thought that their intrusion was worth giving us 2 free peach cobblers to go, even though we did not complain or show any hint of being offended. 蔜his is service at its best. I would recommend Smoque to anyone looking for excellent BBQ and even better service (and that is saying a lot, considering that the food is absolutely amazing).

First my standard BBQ disclaimer: I lived in Kansas City for five years. 蔄rthur Bryant's is my Mecca. 蔍 get the Jack Stack Catalog in the mail. 蔐et's say I'm a little biased. �Smoque was ok, but i won't be going out of my way to get here again. 蔍 hate to say it, but suspect the meats were not fully cooked over wood. 蔜his is a deal breaker for any BBQ place in my book. 蔜he ribs we had were not very meaty and the sauce could have been better (honestly it was not memorable). 蔕therwise the ordering at the counter and sit down is a fine system, but the layout of this place is bad which makes for an uncomfortable dining room. 蔍 hear the line is typical - so why not change the layout?

BEST. BBQ. EVER!!! The chopped beef brisket platter is phenomenal, so soft and moist. The sauce has the perfect amount of zing, if its too much for you ask for their other sauce on the side. The mac and cheese is reaaallyyyy cheesy, basically melts in your mouth as you eat it. I hate coleslaw but their coleslaw is to die for I can eat buckets of it a day!

This is Barbeque perfection!!! 蔍 stopped by here because I was in Chicago and it had been featured on Food Network. 蔍 hopped on the L 蔭nd rode out. 蔠ell worth the the 15 min ride from downtown. �The brisket was fork tender & moist. 蔜he ribs melted in your mouth. 蔍 was also impressed with the sides. 蔜he Baked beans have real chunks of brisket in them. �The fries are crisp and hot and served in paper bag. 蔄lso the price is right I got out for under $20 bucks and I won't have to eat for the rest of the day. �REVISED: I went back a week later. 蔋ad the pulled pork and St. Louis Ribs. 蔜hey let me down compared to the Brisket and the baby back ribs. 蔛o I knocked off a star to 4 instead of 5 My one complaint is that the place isn't very green friendly. 蔍 ordered in and yet my food was all in to go containers except the meat. 蔜hey should work on this!

Ok, sure... it's more fun to get BBQ in a little run down place on the side of an old dirt road run by an old man or woman with smoke-stained hands... yes. I agree. Chicago has had a few greats that fit this category too (.. the original Hecky's on Greenbay, Leon's on the south side... Oh Edith! We miss you so!). Smoque is not this. It doesn't have that cinematic, "I've come across something nobody else knows about" thing. They won't cast Wilford Brimley or Bill Cobbs to play the owner in the movie about this place. But really, who cares? For me its about how the food tastes... period. I don't require the foreplay... just fork over the smokey meats please. THEIR SAUCE has a kick but is not too spicy... nice and sweet without being too sweet as Chicago places do often... sweeter than Texas style, more kick than KC style.... just right. BRISKET is great! Fatty where you want it fatty, flavorful, smokey, tender... this is great stuff. RIBS are smokey and pink... tender... dry served with sauce on the side for dipping... very meaty and very delicious! BEANS may be the best thing in the place.... smokey and fatty and onion-y... yum! COLESLAW is a very minimal vinegar chopped cabbage with a little purple onion and that's it... very fresh and crunchy... not huge on flavor and not for everybody... but good pallet cleanser and heat relief. PULLED PORK is good but I think the brisket is the better choice here. CHICKEN.... chicken? Who orders chicken in a place like this?! It did LOOK good but sorry... can't waste my plate space on chicken.... maybe someday I'll try it..... FRIES are great... crunchy, yummy.... not an afterthought as with many other pure breed BBQ places.. PEACH COBBLER will have you weeping... delicious!... and served piping hot... damn!... If it has a fault, it is that it's too small! THE BEST DEAL is getting a sandwich and fries on the kids menu for like $3.50 if you want a great lunch but don't want to have to take a nap after it... ALSO, it's BYOB which is a nice touch.... lots of folks were bringing in their own beer... makes for an affordable and delicious meal. IN ADDITION: I was just there with some friends... the place was packed but they went out of their way to make sure we ordered the best stuff... one guy gave us a consultation as we stood in line.. and man did it pay off! I will now always get the St Louis style ribs! Meatier than baby back. Who knew? He also went in the back and brought us candied jalapenos and an extra spicy sauce that they don't have on the table. He also dragged out a table for us to sit at... brought three chairs from the back. They really took care of us and we left totally satisfied! I LOVE THIS PLACE!

I spent three years in Chicago, desperately searching for a passable pork shoulder before my husband found Smoque. 蔍 had heard about it a few times, but passed it off, since I had been burned by a few recommendations for "the best BBQ in Chicago" before. 蔣ou see, I'm not interested in ribs AT ALL. 蔍 mean, okay, sometimes I like some ribs, but when I want barbecue, I really want pork shoulder. 蔍 didn't realize that this was weird until I left Kentucky. Anyhoo, Smoque has the best pork shoulder I have had in the city hands down. 蔊ranted, I'm still on a mission, but this place is a definite go-to until we get our own smoker. 蔛omething tells me that's going to be a few years since backyards aren't exactly easy to come by here...

Giving Smoque BBQ one star likely won't persuade many people here, so please consider this review a reminder to demand your food be properly prepared. I've been to Smoque three times -- two of which I was served meat that was very much overcooked. Ribs and brisket are supposed to be moist and tender, not DRY and TOUGH. After my second outing turned out to be quite yummy, I thought I would give Smoque another try. Not again.

I am from Austin, TX and the guys that started this place got much of their inspiration from there. 蔍n fact, their new sausage is made in Taylor, TX (about 30 min outside of Austin). 蔜hey are very true to form for someone that eats BBQ once a week. Good: - Ribs are the real deal - both baby backs and St. Louis - Brisket is just like home - Mac and Cheese is great - Beans are some of the best I have ever had - Brisket in the beans! - BYOB - cold beer! Wish they could improve: - Small seating but they seem to make it work - Outside of most of the tourist places so you have to make the effort to get to this place. I would highly recommend this place if you are not from Texas or KC and have not had real BBQ (Sorry Carolina, I have no experience there).

Soooo gooood! Everything was delicious. Really no complaints at all. The BBQ sauces were the best that I've ever had. I was so surprised by the differences between them. The one for my chicken was tangy and a little spicy, whereas the sauce for the pulled pork was citrusy but not too sweet. Fries, amazing. Even the slaw was great, and I usually hate cole slaw. It was light and again had a bit of citrus in it. Great place and amazing value. Truth be told I was a little wary when I saw that the bleached blonde gnome from the food network and chili's/Fridays had higlighted it. But, as I've written, a terrific restaurant.

Came in around 5 PM on a Sunday (scored the parking lot in the back that's only available at weird hours for Smoque customers) and the line was only a few people long and open seats. �0 min later (Bears game at night), the place was packed, consistent line out the door and no open seats. �I came in with a game plan - try the ribs and brisket along with the beans and macaroni and cheese. 蔉orgot to add the taste portion of the brisket (instead got the two half slabs of baby back and St. Louis style), BBQ beans, cole slaw, macaroni, and corn bread. 蔜he ribs were both awesome, finger lickin' good! 蔅aby backs are still my favorite, but the St. Louis ribs with the dry rub really grew on me by the end. Macaroni was amazing, the beans were pretty damn good, corn bread was just OK as was the cole slow - as other commenters noted, more vinegar than I was used to but was a nice way to cut through the saltiness of the meat. Overall very happy with my first Smoque visit - I'll be back for the brisket though!

One of the best BBQ places I have eaten at .... the place is not much in terms of decor .... It has cafeteria style seating (i.e. you share tables with other people) ... the plates and silverware are really ordinary ..... but the food will knock your socks off .... I have traveled to the south for work frequently, places that are known for good BBQ ..... I feel Smoque can hold it's own with any of them. �When me and my buddy got there, 蕋he line extended out of the restaurant 蔭nd wrapped half way around the block .... I knew right then that this was the place for me .... :) The lines move fast and the service is good so we were sitting with our food about 15mins later .....

First off full disclosure, let me say that I LOVE, LOVE, LOVE BBQ. I could eat it for breakfast lunch and dinner. I keep a gallon of my favorite BBQ sauce in the fridge. However with all the choices in Chicago it's tough to find one that hits all the right notes. Pros: Consistently good food. I have been going there a few times a month for a couple years and have yet to have a bad experience Reasonable prices. When you are addicted to BBQ like I am, getting a meal w/ 2 sides for $10.95 is a steal. Not to mention that fact that it's BYOB Easy to get to - it's right off the Irving Park exit of the highway, so w/o traffic I can get there in 10 mins from Bucktown Cons: As with any good restaurant it can get crowded sometimes. Many times there is a line out the door, but rest assured it goes quickly Tips: it's BYOB - so take advantage of that. But note it's not so much as sit down restaurant as a order at the counter sit down eat and leave type place. Go at off times to avoid the crowds I prefer the "thicker" sauce but you have to ask for it when you pick up your food. enjoy!!

Smoque has the best brisket sandwich in the city. 蔍've tried the ribs, the pulled pork, and then my experimenting stopped when I tried the brisket! 蔍 get it every single time and I never wish I got something else. 蔅elieve the hype, it is THAT good (the brisket). 蔜he rest of their menu is very good and the portions are generous, but the brisket truly is the one thing I've had that's out of this world. 蔒y favorite sides are the delicious mac and cheese and the slaw! 蔍 love slaw that's oil and vinegar based. 蔍've also tried their cornbread, beans, and the peach cobbler. 蔜hey're all very good, but there's a reason I've been going to Smoque regularly for over a year and I get the same order every time: 1/2 brisket sandwich with mac n' cheese and slaw. �Tips: go for lunch, it's less crowded! 蔜hey do call ahead orders for pick ups so that's what I would suggest if you want it for dinner, because parking is also difficult. 蔄nd wear comfortable shoes because chances are you will be standing for a long time in line!

If you're on a diet don't walk downwind from this place! 蔍f you have a craving for some sweet bbq goodness tho, then you must come here. 蔐et me restate that - if you want BBQ and you live anywhere near here, this place will have what it takes to hit the spot. 蔎uicy meat with delightfully smoky undertones coated in a sweet sticky sauce that ties it all together into what I call bbq heaven. �Its a busy joint, so be prepared to bump elbows with local workers, cops, and out-o-towners. 蔜he BBQ is smoked and falling-off your fork good.

I've been going to Smoque since before it got famous, and it's never let me down. Easily the best BBQ on the northwest side. Even when the line is out the door, things move pretty fast. I think we usually wait about 15 minutes to get to the register and another 10 minutes for our food. Mmmm, the food. The menu is short and to the point. My boyfriend and I stick to the ribs, pulled pork, and chicken. All amazing (though the chicken can be dry sometimes). The fresh-cut fries are my personal favorite of any fries ever in the history of fries. The mac and cheese is a close runner up. When I'm in a healthy mood, I go for the salad, but it's not my favorite. (I think they use marinated sun-dried tomatoes on it, and I can't get into the flavor.) The only ways Smoque could improve: 1) Move to my basement ... or add delivery service. 2) Have somebody redo that salad; it's not that hard to make a great salad. 3) Get a bigger space or a patio area (or both).

As a southerner, I am a fan of good BBQ and so far SMOQUE is the best I have had in Chicago! The brisket and pulled pork are mouth wateringly delicious... and their sides equally tasty. The Mac and Cheese is rich and creamy, the baked beans are flavorful (from the meat they cook it with), and the fries are phenomenal. Portions are huge... but no worries... SMOQUE left overs taste just as good the day after!!! Dont mind the long lines, they move pretty quickly and the food is definitely worth the wait! This place is no vegetarian friendly... unless you want a meal of fries, corn bread and slaw (which actually doesnt sound too bad)

The fam was in the mood for ribs so we ordered 2 full slabs to go. I didn't realize how popular this place was until we drove up to restaurant and saw a line out the door. 蔉ortunately, since we did carryout, we didn't have to wait to long. 蔎ust pick up and go - fastest way to get to those ribs in your mouth. You can taste the smokiness of the ribs and the sauce was so yummy. 蔍 like that they give you an extra sauce so you can add on as much sauce as you want. The ribs aren't tough at all ... nice and tender. I can't wait to try the other items on the menu!

I had a pulled-pork sandwich and it was DELICIOUS, so tender and succulent. 蔠ish I'd ordered the half portion though, because they give you a stupid amount of food. 蔛eriously, I've been known to put away my share of BBQ, but those portions are ridiculously huge. 蔜heir sauce is sweet but very good. We got there really early, around 6pm on a weekday, and the wait to order was maybe 35 minutes, then the food got out pretty fast. 蔜he place got packed with a line out the door by the time we left at about 7:15.

I'm never disappointed when I grab some grub from Smoque my typical order: -Brisket Sandwich �swap out cole slaw for corn bread) -Brisket Chili -- yes, chunks of brisket in the chili! -Peach Cobbler Fries are good too, but once you try the Brisket Chili or Peach Cobbler, you'll never go back. I've also tried the pulled pork, but again, the Brisket is too good to turn down.

Even though this place is no longer new it is amazing to me that there is still a line out the door on a Saturday evening at 6:30. Don't get me wrong the ribs are great but there are lots of places to get ribs nowadays. I think people go for the peach cobbler because it is out of this world tasty. We were told that Tuesdays and Wednesdays are the days to go. Street parking isn't too difficult and even though it is first come first serve seating the 4 guys working the floor make sure that no one sits before their order is placed.

God send for Chicago. In a place where you really can't authentic anything is Smoque. This is a real BBQ place that only serves what they know they can do right. Meats that are properly smoked, tender pork and brisket. Sauce that is real NC sauce - not that store bought crap that the rest of the Chicago "BBQ" joints try to give you. I've eaten BBQ around the country, and from some award winning pitmasters. This stuff is the real deal people. I hope they don't let their popularity get to their heads like Chicago places tend to do.

We expected a lot from this place, and frankly we were disappointed. The pulled pork was average at best, the sides were small and (other than the mac-n-cheese, which is delicious) unimpressive. Coupled 蕎ith the long lines and high school cafeteria ambiance it's unlikely that we'll be back.

As a fan of Mikaska's in Taylor TX (where the Smoque folks claim to get their inspiration), I found Smoque to be the best BBQ I've had in Chiacgo, although still a noticeable notch behind the places back in Texas. The sauce is suitably spicey although on the runny side. The Brisket is tender and juicy, although a bit bland. The Peach cobbler is OK, the mac and cheese is delicious, and cornbread is authentic. Worth the long lines for dinner.

i don't think i have ever seen this place with out a line...but to be scared by the line it moves quickly, seating seems to usually be sorta easy too, but i have never eaten there i always take mine to go but buy the time i get home its just as good as eating there im sure... Im from st. louis originally and this is deffinantly in the same vein, apply you own sauce, slightly spicy, not to sweet, goodness...people say the brisket is the best but i just love ribs, so im gonna say the ribs then brisket, haven't had the pulled pork but friends have they said its good, and the new texas sausage is great, just really good flavor all around... remember friends its byob, and nothing goes with bbq better than a nice micro brew stout porter, and/or an ale... Last note is the sides, personally not a big fan of the slaw but the mac n cheese is so good i will make up a word just for...scrumtalasint...

Smoque is happiness. Every time my boyfriend and I decide to travel north to have BBQ at Smoque, I can't help but feel excitement. I've had the BBQ chicken and the baby back ribs-both are wonderful. The chicken is surprisingly very moist. My boyfriend always gets the half and half sandwich, with pulled pork and sliced brisket. He ususally scarfs the whole thing down before I can get a bite. Although the meat is delicious, the sides are where it is at. The BBQ beans change lives! Seriously! I know that they have changed mine on several occasions. Even the fries are incredible. Yum!

I should start by saying that I'm a bbq enthusiast and smoke my own baby backs, spares, butts, and briskets. 蔍 wanted to try Smoque because of all the raves it's been receiving. 蔐et's face it, Chicago is not the place for good q, but hopefully that's changing. 蔍 tried everything they had and, for the most part, liked it (and it didn't cost as much as I thought it would). 蔍t's nice that they actually smoke the meat, on the prem, in their big ol' Southern Pride Smoker. Out of everything, the pulled pork was the best. 蔍 found the brisket a bit dry, but pretty good (although no smoke ring). 蔕verall, 蔍 was a bit disappointed in the lack of smoke flavor in the food. 蔍 also felt that there could be more of a bite to their rubs. 蔋owever, the sauce (especially the vinegar-based) made up for that. 蔜he slaw rocked! I would go back, but I have to say (in a completely biased way), that I much prefer the home version of low and slow.

YUMMMYYY!!!!!! Smoque is my new favorite place. I can't believe it took me so long to eat here. I always heard there was long lines to get in, so we decided to stop by around 3pm on Sunday and try our luck. There was only a few people in line, but all tables were full. Took us about 3 minutes to get a table, and I was glad we came when we did. Almost immediately after being seated the placed got packed and the line was to the door. It stayed that way until we left. The brisket is fantastic- tender smokey goodness. The sausage was also pretty damn good. The platter seams to be the better deal, as they come with 2 sides, and the sandwiches I saw looked a little puny. The got the brisket platter with mac n cheese and french fries. I have to say these are the best fries I have had in years, and they give you ALOT of them.... The mac was absolutely delicious!!!!!!! The coleslaw was not to bad, but nothing spectacular. God I love this place...

I have been here 5 times since the begining of January when I first heard about Smoque on channel 7. 蔠ow. 蔍t is the best BBQ you can get in Chicago. Everything here is good. 蔒y husband has had every type of meat on the menu except the Texas Sausage (that is being saved for the next trip). 蔋is favorite is the chopped brisket. 蔒ine is the pulled pork. 蔐ast time we went (for Valentine's Day) he got the best of both worlds 1/2 pulled pork and 1/2 chopped brisket sandwich. I have to have baked beans when I come here. 蔜hey have the perfect flavor and are infused with smoke. 蔜he macaroni and cheese is so good too. 蔍 like to eat a little bit and then wait for it to cool down so the cheese is not runny. 蔍t tastes like macaroni and cheese cake! �My husband loves the peach cobbler and eats it first because that is when it tastest the best. This place is also BYOB. 蔄nd though there is quite a wait at dinner time, many people just open a beer and talk with friends while waiting in line. 蔍t is totally worth it. The owners/managers are also extremely nice and make sure that you have a place to sit down when it's time to eat. 蔈verything is very organized and you know that once you get your food you won't have to wait to eat it. One problem that I've noticed, it seems as though at dinner time the only cashier has to ring up both to-go orders and sit down orders. 蔜his takes up a lot of time and causes people to wait more than they would have to if they had a separate person ring up only to-go orders. It seems to get bussiest around 5:30 pm on the Weekend nights and around 12:00 pm for lunch. 蔅usy means that a line has started that goes out of the building. 蔍 would try to go before these times to avoid a wait. Also, you get quite a bit of food and they put the sides and sandwiches in great easy-to-take-with-you to-go boxes.

Be prepared to wait in line for a while, this place is busy. 蔍s it worth the wait? 蔍'd say so. 蔜he food is pretty good. Of course everybody has their own opinion about what makes good BBQ, you're going to hear mine. 蔜heir Brisket is always great-- tender and flavorful. 蔍'm not really a fan of the giant sweet bun they use for the sandwich though, its kind of a distraction from the meat. 蔅aked beans and Mac n' Cheese are perfect! 蔍 get a quarter slab of St. Louis style ribs almost everytime I go because sometimes they are perfect (flavorful, smokey, chewy) but sometimes they can be a little dry and tough-- its a little bit of a crap shoot, but when you win you win big! 蔜hey use a dry rub that has a little bit of spice to it, and they pair it with a sauce that's a little more sweet. 蔖eople used to Chilli's or Applebee's boiled ribs will be in for a surprise!

This would be a 4.5 star review if the distance wasn't so great, about 45 from where I live. I have been here once so far and that day was the White Sox home opener after the game. I got the sliced brisket platter which came with coleslaw and 2 sides which I choose to be the brisket chili and the mac n cheese. I also got a taste of pulled pork. 1. sliced brisket Extremely tender, could barely pick it up with my fork. had good flavor. first brisket i've ever had so I didn't have anything to compare it too but It wasnt as juicy as I had hoped but it was by no means dry. Decent size portion with the slaw and 2 sides. 4/5 2. coleslaw DAMN good slaw. I believe I am the slaw nazi because I am always critical of it, and I don't like vinegar based so much, but boy do they know what they are doing. Simple. One type of cabbage chopped not shredded like crazy, and some thinly sliced red onion. Little bit of pepper the slightly vinegary base, can't go wrong. Not drenched not too peppery. Only complaint was that I wanted MORE! 5/5 3. mac n cheese Tiny portion, but ooooh so good. Nice breadcrumb crust on top and very creamy in the middle. You can tell its homemade, because of the color and flavor (real cheese), and can taste the love. Again only complaint tiny portion which i'm going to say takes half a point this time. 4.5/5 4. brisket chili Good spices, decent heat, nice sized bowl. Hardly any meat though just basically tomatoes and spices with a chili like broth. Tasty but not a chili that one should be proud of. The one low point of the meal. 2.5/5 5. pulled pork Good pulled pork. You can defiantly taste the smoke especially in the dark crust which tastes like a smokey bacon. The flavor was a bit one dimensional though. 3.5/5 Overall a pretty good place, might not go out of my way to get back there but after a sox game sure. Good price for lots of good food, about 12 dollars for all of that plus a drink. Slightly disappoint how the BBQ sauce had more flavor than basically everything, or at least the meat. 蔔ot much of a line at all when I went. Very organized I was very impressed.

I have eaten at the Salt Lick in Austin, TX more times than I can remember. 蔍 used to think they had the best BBQ in all the land, but now I must confess that Smoque is vying for that sauce-slathered place in my heart. 蔜heir brisket is amazing - it comes out hot and tender with a sauce that compliments it well. 蔜he sausage is delicious and authentically Texan. 蔜heir mac and cheese is wonderful, their cobbler quite tasty and their coleslaw is some of the only slaw I've ever liked. �So what's holding them back? 蔄 sad absence of pickles, onions and potato salad. 蔜hen again, the owner (manager?) said it's perfectly fine to bring my own jar of pickles next time, so bonus points for Smoque. 蔍'm serious about the potato salad, though - a Texas BBQ dinner just isn't complete without it! �Oh, and you may also end up waiting for anywhere from 10 minutes to half an hour depending on when you arrive, and end up sitting quite closely to some strangers. 蔅ut that's just how things are done when it comes to Texas BBQ, from my experience, so I didn't think too much of it. 蔛ucks in the winter to wait outside, but you can always call ahead for pick up or to check if they haven't run out of brisket (or whatever is your fancy).

Simplicity is the key. The owners have wisely kept their operation small and the menu limited - which takes a lot of self control when your restaurant becomes a gold mine. The food is prepared to perfection and is delicious. BBQ is amazing, the fries are fantastic, cole slaw is really good - try it even if you don't like slaw. (it comes with anyway) The atmosphere is nonexistent unless you consider metal prison trays and people yelling numbers atmosphere. But hey - If you go to a BBQ joint for atmosphere you are probably leading a disappointed life already. If you are getting the fries (and you should, the first time at least) it is better to eat there unless you live pretty close, they need to be eaten quickly.

After reading all the praise here on Yelp, I was really excited to try Smoque. I'm a BBQ fiend. I'm particularly fond of Texas style brisket, but I love all BBQ. I was very disappointed with the food at Smoque. The people were nice, but the brisket was possibly the worst I've ever had. I thought the pork was OK, but my wife didn't care for that much either.

I tried this place about 2 months ago and it was very, very good. It was a busy night, so I decided to do a carry-out order...and when I got there, I was really glad I did! There was a line out the door, but luckily carry-out orders are allowed to skip the line and go straight inside. I ordered the brisket basket and my wife had the baby-back ribs; both were excellent. We had the cornbread, mac n' cheese, fries, and bbq beans as sides and all of them were great as well. Overall, this is my favorite bbq place in the city. Everyone has their own preference (especially bbq foodies), so this place may not be for everyone, but it's definitely worth a shot b/c the food is outstanding.

I am not an expert on BBQ and we found Smoque on an Internet search and put it on the list to try. I checked out yelp reviews before we went and am thankful for the heads up on the wait to get in & order food. We were there on a Sunday and the line was not out the door, so I figured that was a good thing. It was around 7:00 p.m. and it was 15 minutes till we ordered and another 15 minutes to get the food. We decided to take it home instead of eating in. I am not an expert on BBQ. I've eaten it in and around Chicago at various places. I've eaten BBQ in St. Louis, and KC. I've can't recall any bad BBQ any where I've tried it, there are just variations of it. We got the pulled pork, which was very good. It was moist and had a mild smoky flavor. I loved the vinegar based sauce, it is not hot or sweet, the right amount of flavor to compliment the pork. The chicken was good as well, although a little dry. The chicken had a nice smoky flavor to it. The sauce that came with the chicken was thicker and sweeter, it was good. We got a side of brisket. I've only had BBQ brisket once before at a South Carolina style BBQ place in Maryland. This brisket was UNBELIEVABLE. When ordered we were asked "sliced or chopped" we opted for sliced. The flavor of the meat, the smokiness of it and the melt in your mouth tenderness was too much! The side portion of it was generous and I may be a brisket convert. The cole slaw was vinegar based. It tastes like rice vinegar, celery seed and has thin slices of red onion which adds a pop of flavor. The cole slaw is different - 蔵n a good way - 蕍ery refreshing. �I am an expert on baked beans, have had many excellent variations of them home made and out, but these rocked my world. The beans are smoked, have hints of brown sugar, chunks of bacon and onion and taste so good as I write this I want them- now!. I didn't believe how fast I chowed down my side order. I wanted to head back on the kennedy to grab more before they closed. I restrained myself. But from now on large side of baked beans, maybe 2, one to eat later in the week might be a treat. The side special of the day was brisket chili which I picked as a side. It was ok, not something I would get again. Overall, we thought the food was very good, the prices were reasonable, and their baked beans are perfect.

I don't like the over use of onions in a few of their dishes but if I liked onions then I would like those dishes too! Keep going back to Smoque...and it's a LONG drive! It's unique. The owners hang around all the time...which usually means that they care...and that the food will maintain it's quality. Did I mention that it's pretty easy to find parking. I will add more details later. Now go get yourself some SMOQUE BBQ!!!

I've been coming here for about two years now. 蔍t gets really busy during the rush periods... Your best bets are to call in orders and just bypass the line of people and go strait to the front. 蔣ou definitely can't be shy here. 蔜he barbecue is amazing. 蔍n particular the pulled pork and their nc-style sauce. 蔍'm from N.C and have been spoiled with great barbecue my entire life. 蔍 come here and reminisce about my North Carolina Day's. �This pulled pork is the BEST I've ever had. 蔜he brisket is awesome too....

Best BBQ I've had in Chicago... Might be the best BBQ I have had north of the Mason-Dixon Line... We ordered it for the Superbowl, picked it up earlier in the day and kept it warm until game time and it was still amazingly tender... Probably the best brisket I have ever had... Ribs were awesome too... Can't wait to try it again!

I don't quite concur with a friend who calls Smoque the best BBQ in Chicago, as I don't think their ribs really even compare to Carson's, but Smoque's Chopped Brisket sandwiches is one of my favorite sandwiches in the city. Accompanied by excellent fries, it makes for a great meal at a good price ($6.95/$8.95 with slaw & one side). Their Pulled Pork is also very good, and the ribs aren't bad, just not the best I've had. Their menu doesn't run too deep--only Chicken, Texas Sausage, Sliced Brisket, Side Dishes and a Salad beyond the aforementioned--but they do what they do well, their service is good, their take home packaging is excellent and they always seem to be doing a robust business. Deservedly so.

I LOVE barbecue. 蔇id I mention that I love BBQ? 蔠ell, I love BBQ. 蔕k, now that I mentioned that, I have to say that Smoque BBQ is just OK. 蔍 have heard raving reviews for Smoque from many friends, so I finally got there last Sunday. 蔉irst, a 90 minute wait? 蔙eally? ��I got there around 5 PM on Sunday and waited approximately 90 minutes. 蔅y the time we ordered, I was drooling! But then my disappointment started. 蔍 ordered the St. Louis Ribs (what they're known for) and they just ran out. 蔙AN OUT? 蔍 nearly cried. 蔍f this is your specialty, how can you possibly run out? 蔋aving to make a very quick, on-the-spot decision (there were about twenty people behind me giving me the evil stare of death), I chose a pulled pork platter. 蔜he pulled pork was standard. 蔔othing great, but standard. 蔜he mac-and-cheese was standard, and the fries were very good. Overall, I may have gone on an off-night and I'm willing to give it another try. 蔅ut, not on a weekend. 蔍'll try it during the week when there is a shorter wait.

Don't be discouraged by a line out the door at Smoque, it's there for a reason and it moves quickly. The food is delicious. One of the guys I ate with absolutely raved about how moist the sliced brisket was and the rack of St. Louis ribs was a wonderful tummy filler. Of course don't forget the sides in their little tins cups. The cornbread has kernels of corn, the macaroni and cheese is very cheesy and breaded on top, and if you order fries you'll get an entire bag full. Good luck eating it all. It's very good barbecue.

I'm a business traveler, so over the years I've been able to eat at many of the famous (and not so famous) BBQ establishments in the US. 蔋ere is what I know: 蔎ust because its famous, doesn't mean its good (duh); and a "hole in the wall" BBQ does not always insure you will have BBQ heaven on your plate. 蔛omething else: most places have a specialty - the ribs, pulled pork, brisket or perhaps even a side; beans, corn bread, etc., while the balance of the menu is only so-so. 蔙egional tastes dictate different preparation methods, but come down to sweet, sour, hot, mild, salty, peppery an/or various combinations thereof. �Smoque, in my opinion, is one of the best BBQ establishments in the nation. 蔜he balance they achieve between the rub and smoker is hard to beat. 蔜he meat stands alone; sauce is very good (there are two kinds, one peppery, the other vinegary), but not required (and they are stingy with the sauce, too). 蔄lthough I order their chopped brisket a little less than half the times I have been there, the ribs are excellent (baby back - I'm a Chicago guy), and the pulled pork is a great sandwich or platter, too. 蔍 have not had the chicken. 蔜he sausage is very good, with some subtle heat to it. The sides are uniformly excellent, although the slaw is not to my taste. 蔜he fries are double fried ala Al's Beef, and very good. 蔍n my close to 20 visits since Smoque has been open, food consistency has been to the same, high standard. Be prepared to stand in line, and sometimes they are sold out of an item (mostly, brisket). 蔛eating can best be called communal, but that's not a bad thing at a BBQ joint. 蔕utside seating would be great in the summer, but I'll not hold my breath on that. 蔛treet parking is as good as it gets, but I have always been lucky to find a spot.

For starters, the first time I saw Smoque, it was on the Hungry Hound. Not long after, I saw the Guy Fieri appearance on "Diners" and decided to check it out. Now I understand a thing or two about BBQ. I heard about the journey the owner's took that eventually ended up as Smoque. The when I saw that they served beef brisket, my first thought was these guys have a death wish. I can tell you first hand (as many others could as well) is that brisket is VERY difficult to do properly. There isn't much margin for error, especially when working with a Packer's cut brisket (both flat and point cuts together). I've seen so many people and places try to do it and fail terribly (under/over spiced, poor blend of seasonings & overcooked being most common). They did what most people should do- go to the people and learn how to BBQ properly. The brisket was moist, properly seasons (one spice didn't overpower the other- I wasn't trying to figure it out, I just wanted to eat). If you spend a few extra dollars, you can get a nice slaw and two sides. The mac & cheese was rock solid. I decided to go with fries and they were also very good (note- I don't eat fries much anymore, so someone else finished them off for me). If you say you can make a good brisket but whiff, news will travel FAST!! So my next visit, I decided to do something else. I bought the smoky Texas sausage (actually, I wanted to just take a bite and take the rest back home). Not too spicy but smooth (it could be spicy for others with much lower tolerance for heat). I had the St Louis ribs my next visit. These ribs are fantastic!! I could say they could stack up with the legends in this area. The ribs were not fall off the bone but nice and tender (I think fall off the bone took a wrong turn from what was originally meant; I believe fall off the bone meant pulling away from the bone NOT literally falling off the bone). For the record, I'm not a pulled pork fan (when I BBQ it, I prefer to slice it; pulled pork not bad but just prefer sliced). Bottom line. The spot is pretty visible and easy to get to. If you find yourself in that neck of the woods, stop by and have a taste. Sit down and eat it or take it home to eat later. You won't be sorry.

Reviewing strictly the tray of food that was in front of me: this was simply the best BBQ I've ever eaten. I had the pulled pork and the beef brisket, and from the first bite I was completely glad I waited in line. That's the truth. No atmosphere, very long lines, crowded seating in a small space, no service to speak of, inconvenient... and TOTALLY WORTH IT.

Overhyped I love BBQ, and I was happy when my friend John decided to treat my wife and I to dinner here 3 weeks ago. I had heard of the restaurant on yelp, and was eager to try their ribs. I never blame a place for being popular, but Smoque is too small (a picture taken in January clearly illustrates this). It can seat about 20 on the left, and about 40 on the right, but the tables and chairs are really close to each other. It's hard to move around when the place is busy (this is an understatement), and you may also find yourself waiting to be seated (there are some chairs by the restrooms, and people were constantly walking by my wife and I). A portly man (I'm going to talk about him some more in a bit) was less impressed than I was. He asked someone, probably the owner, if the restaurant could be expanded. He even suggested that the business next door be bought out (he was politely told that it's hard to buy out a dentist's office). �There are only 2 registers, and the line was almost out the door when we arrived (there were 5 of us, and I'm glad that other customers were respectful of John's daughters- he had 2 at the time, but 3 now). It didn't move very quickly, and it always reached the door or beyond while we were there (we were inside for a good hour). Anyway, it took us about 10 minutes to order. +The menu is small, but diverse enough (ribs, chicken, brisket, pulled pork, Texas sausage). I should have ordered some Texas sausage, but I didn't know that the sausages are really hot links at the time. There's a salad on the menu (a small is $5.45, and you can add chicken for $2.50 more), and John took advantage of the Kids Menu (it consists of 2 meals and Mac & Cheese). There are 6 sides to choose from (ex: BBQ Beans; Fresh Cut Fries), and 1 dessert item (Peach Cobbler). +You can Add a Taste (a meat to your meal or salad) for only $3 or $4 (the latter is for 3 or 4 St. Louis Ribs). +The staff works hard (one of the food preparers was sweating). When we came in, the cashiers were all business (I expected this), but quick and attentive, and some guys worked diligently to seat people. The food preparers also have a good system going. We ordered over $70 worth of food, but nothing was missing or wrong. +The prices are reasonable (ex: with slaw and 2 sides, a Half Chicken Platter is $11.45). +/-The portions are solid, but not great. Big eaters like me need to spend about $20 here. -There's very limited parking. Thankfully, we were able to park in front of a building that was just about a block away. -The selection of drinks is limited. The soda fridge contains bottled water and about 4 types of soda, and the soda fountain features 6 or 7 selections (if the restaurant is busy, it can be a pain getting to it- it's in the back). St. Louis Ribs (with slaw and 2 sides, a Half Slab is $13.45): 8/10. They're meaty and flavorful (they'll demand that your taste buds take notice), but I actually found them to be too strong in taste (my wife liked them more). Some of our ribs were also a tad burnt. The BBQ sauce we had on the side was pretty good, but light. They're a little more expensive (a Full Slab with slaw and 2 sides is $21.95), but Baby Back Ribs can also be ordered. They're smaller, but possibly better (they've evidently "been king in Chicago for years"). Pulled Pork Platter ($10.45 with slaw and 2 sides): 8.5/10. The meat is good and not overpowering in taste. I liked it more than them, but I know that the "kick" the St. Louis Ribs provide wows most people (this was the case with my wife). Mac & Cheese: 8/10. Different (because of the crust and crumbs, a container of it resembles a piece of pie), but fairly good. A popular side. Fresh Cut Fries (a large is $2.95): 7.5/10. Not bad, but not spectacular. They're easy to eat and enjoyable enough. Cornbread: 7/10. BBQ Beans: 7/10. Both sides are just okay. The portly man came in with his wife. He may have been a food critic (he came across as an uptight snob who wanted to be catered to- he and his wife were also overly dressed). The owner apologized to him (the man and his wife waited awhile to be seated), but to no avail. Anyway, the man was seated at our table, and he didn't like being so close to John's daughters (he may have noticed that they were sick, but I think this really had to do with them being playful- still, they were pretty quiet and didn't make contact with anyone). The final straw came when John was helping a guy bus our area. A napkin fell on the man (it landed by his hands), and he could barely restrain himself (the napkin, by the way, hadn't been used). Anyway, John and I knew that it was "time to go" (I'm sorry, but I hope his food gave the man the runs). The layout is poor, but Smoque lives up to its name. The meat is cooked "Low And Slow," and is very smokey. If you have to wait, your food will be worth it for the most part. Still, I don't see what all the fuss is about.

The best things about this place are the price and the smell. 蔜hey have good meat and decent mac and cheese, though it was not everything some people have propped it up to be. 蔜he sauce is way too thin though, and the cole slaw was so overly sweet that I was unable to eat it. 蔄s seems to be a common fallacy of Chicago's BBQ joints, they did not have Texas toast. 蔜hey did have a very good soft drink selection, which sounds weird, but they have a lot to choose from. 蔍 do have to say though that the staff was very good. 蔜he place just didn't wow me overall like I had expected it to after reading about it online.

It was very good. Smoque BBQ is a hole in the wall place- so don't be surprised to walk in there and say WOW, this is beautiful! Of course, most people look for food in a restaurant, not it's looks. So we walk into this place, and 蔵t immediately smells like barbecue. Smoky, too. I had a pulled pork sandwich, and some macaroni and cheese. I'd say it was one of the best pulled pork sandwiches ever. I tried the macaroni and cheese, and it was basically your average Kraft mac and cheese. 蔍t was a good restaurant, but just go for the meat, not the side orders.

Haven't had their fries or ribs, but... some tasty items on this menu. The pulled pork and cornbread are pretty good, the mac and cheese is really great, and the sliced (yes, sliced is always better and more tender in my book) brisket is YUMMY. Most places do not do brisket well, but for some reason, these guys have a handle on it. It's truly a disappointment ordering brisket at most BBQ joints after having had it at Smoque. Not kidding. Nice staff, too!

I have heard about this place through the book "Eat. Shop. Chicago". I have always wanted to go as soon as I read the review. I ended up going for lunch and I was no impressed. I thought it would be amazing, seeing how the line was out the door... but it was very standard BBQ. I am not going to totally knock this place for 2 reasons: it was PACKED, and I did not order their ribs [which i imagine are probably the best thing on the menu]. But the pulled pork sandwich came out and it was just luke warm.. ugh. 蔄nyway, worth trying, but get the ribs.. and tell me how they were. haha.

I love this place, been going here for about two years now. The first time we went there the line was out the door and around the corner, literally. So I said heck no and went somewhere else. Big Mistake, the ribs we had at the second joint were terrible. On a followup visit, made sure to get there earlier. There still was a line but it moves well and if you're eating in, they really do an excellent job of finding a table for your party by the time you've placed your order. 蔍 didn't think the family style seating was for me, but I quickly got over it just knowing we didn't have to scramble to find a seat that's so cool. And there was the food. The baby backs are excellent, never tough or drowning in sauce, it's served on the side, they're seasoned well and have the right amount of pink on the inside. The slaw is excellent, not that store bought crap that's been made days in advance and swimming in mayo. The BBQ beans, Mac and Cheese, Bag of cut fries, and cobble. OMG, talk about having to loosen your belt. My only wish is they were closer to my house. Oh hell, that's what I-GO car is for when I don't have a ride. You can even call ahead for pickup orders and they tell you exactly when the order will be ready. How sweet is that.

pretty damn tasty 'cue. i finally made it here a couple months back. we arrived on a saturday afternoon around 4 - no wait!! armed with an a la card and minimum $25 purchase to save $10, the boyfriend and i were faced with a carnivore's dilemma - how do we narrow down our options?? so we did what any other good carnivores would do...we ordered it all. oh yeah. a half slab of ribs. tastings of sausage. tastings of brisket. tastings of pulled pork. mac and cheese. biscuits. the meatastic trays were up a matter of mere moments after we were seated and the food orgy began. what were we thinking?? we came. we tried. but we didn't conquer. but that's what doggie bags are for! and that way, we were able to relive the experience throughout the week, bite after smokey bite. what i loved: the mac and cheese side. gooey yet crunchy. well worth it. the ribs. dry rubbed so you can sauce them as you see fit. personally, i think they're better unsauced so you get the full on smokey assault of flavor. the texas sausage. who knew? sweet yet smokey. it was the dark horse at the table and definitely our favorite overall.

I give the chopped brisket at Smoque - Five Stars. I usually go for pulled pork when it comes to BBQ, even chicken, but the Chopped Brisket at Smoque is nicely seasoned, charred, and lean. The sauce is thin and vinegary and adds to the flavor. The brisket is so good they put it in their baked beans, which are smokey and delicious. This place can get busy, so get it to go. It's worth the wait.

I've been eating at Smoque BBQ for quite sometime now. I imagine if you go to Texas and tell them the best brisket you've tasted is in Chicago, you'd be in trouble... you'd also be correct. The brisket is the reason to go to Smoque, the sides are a reason to stay. Smoque is authentic and actually uses a smoker to cook the brisket. You shouldn't need a knife to cut it and you don't. The mac & cheese, fries, and baked beans are excellent dishes. If you're really hungry, get the fries because they give you enough to hold you over. Everything is well priced, I either get the pop for free refills or take advantage of the byob. The other food is also of high quality, but if I have to make a suggestion, the sausage isn't spicy enough for me and I'd love to see them introduce a different bbq sauce. The current one is fantastic, but a variety wouldn't hurt.

Smoque BBQ is without a doubt the best BBQ joint you can possibly find in the Chicago area. Of course, that isn't necessarily saying much. Many Chicagoans have considered a full slab of ribs cooked in an oven and slathered in sweet and sticky BBQ sauce to be actual "BBQ". As a result, there are very few restaurants that serve REAL BBQ, which requires several hours of slowly smoking various types of meat (Pork Shoulder, Ribs, and Brisket) at a low temperature. While it can't be said that the food at Smoque can truly compare to the stuff you can find in, say, Kansas City, it's more than good enough to satisfy both connoisseurs and newcomers to BBQ, and you'll find a little bit of everything on the menu. How about a Texas style sliced brisket sandwich with a side of BBQ Beans? Or a slab of St. Louis style ribs with fresh cut french fries and mac and cheese? Everything, whether it was an entree or a side, was consistently fabulous each time I went. Unless you're not into smoky tasting food or meat in general, there's really nothing to complain about. The service was minimal (you wait in line to order and then pick it up when your number is called), but the staff was incredibly friendly. Prices are a tad on the expensive side and it can get pretty busy in the late afternoon and evening, so try to eat here early if you can. Unless you hate the concept of BBQ, you won't be disappointed.

This is clearly the best BBQ in Chicago. I ordered a slab of both Baby Backs and St. Louis style ribs, both were excellent! The tangy sauce is drinkable it's that good! Loved the Mac and Cheese and Peach Cobbler. Although the slaw and beans weren't to my taste, I would highly recommend Smoque.

It was a long drive for coming from the suburbs but the drive and the wait was well worth it. 蔍t was raining on and off but the owner/manager walked around and handed out umbrellas. 蔠e waited about a hour on a Saturday night just to order. Both my wife and I had the brisket. 蔜he brisket was moist and tender. 蔜he sauce was outstanding. 蔖erfection is the best way to describe it. 蔒y sides were the natural cut french fries and corn bread. 蔅oth were outstanding! 蔒y wife's sides were the mac and cheese and peach cobbler. 蔜hose too were fantastic. The location was very crowded but the line moved fairly well. 蔠e left after 8 and the line outside was just as long as when we arrived. 蔍 will say that once inside I didn't feel crowded nor did I feel rushed. 蔍 noticed people brought in their own beer and wine. 蔄pparently there is no corking fee. I was wearing my Sox jersey and even though I was on the North side everyone was gracious. �I can't wait to go back and try the ribs! 蔜hey should bottle the smell and sell it as aftershave!

A friend turned me on to this place and I love it. 蔍 am glad I don't live too close otherwise I would be 500 lbs. 蔍 love the brisket and ribs. 蔍f they ever have the special brisket chili try it and you will love it.

Alright, I'm going to state this up front first - I grew up in Texas, so I am accustomed to the Texas style of bbq and am totally subjective... 蔍 have been disappointed before with what has been touted as "great bbq" here in Chicago, and I am always on the hunt for good bbq, and this place did live up to its hype. I had the sliced brisket platter with cornbread and baked beans, and my bf had the 1/2 & 1/2 rib platter with mac & cheese and fries. 蔍 love brisket, and this wasn't as good as what I like (not as tender and soft), but it was tastiest as I've had in Chicago. 蔜he ribs were good -- the baby backs are smaller than the St. Louis style but meatier, and both had nice flavor. 蔜he baked mac & cheese was awesome! 蔜he fries are a huge portion too, and surprisingly good; they're the thick-cut, skin-on fries. 蔜he cornbread was good (can't really mess it up), and the baked beans had some meat in it, so I liked that touch. 蔍 probably wouldn't get the brisket again, but I would get the ribs again and would try the chicken and sausage sometime. I can't give it 5 stars because it just doesn't beat my favorite bbq joint of all time (the Salt Lick... drool...), but it does satisfy my craving pretty well.

There's no beating around the bush. Smoque is phenomenal. Best BBQ in the city. The food is as consistent as it gets. Every single time. The first 5 times I came here, I got the pulled pork. I've recently become a brisket fan. There's not an ounce of fat on the brisket. It's better than the pulled pork, which seems to get cold awfully quick. And even though one will not come here for the fries, they are absolutely delicious. Crisp and incredibly tasteful. Cooked to order too. Don't come here on a date or with friends for a "going out" night. You won't be able to stay at your table long because the next group will be waiting. In fairness to Smoque, the staff NEVER asks us to leave. We just sense it's time to go, so the next group can sit. But come here with friends, with the significant other, with the parents. Fantastic food for very nice prices. I can't say enough about Smoque. THE BEST.

everything was excellent.... so friggin' tasty!!! If I lived a block a way from this place, my cholesterol would probably no longer be at a descent 157 ;) ... drum roll.... and the list: - beef brisket. awww.... it just fell apart into juicy tender goodness. It was so good, it broke my heart. - the pulled pork. we just got a taste... I wish my stomach was 3x's bigger so it could handle more. - Best cole slaw I've ever had. Was crisp! very crisp and fresh. Can't beat that! - pork and beans were sweet and good... but nothing to go wow over. I've been spoiled by good pork and beans before... so it's just me. - mac and cheese... baked mac and cheese... was so good I ordered some to go after we left to bring to my sisters house for dinner later that night. btw, the best way to eat bbq here with your girl, is to share the delicious goodness between the both of you. My only gripe about this place... they should leave the bbq sauce's on the tables with labels so you know which bbq sauce you like and can add as much or as little as you want to your meal.

My favorite BBQ in the city! Ribs were tender and smoky and brisket was juicy and cooked to perfection. I love the sauce - tangy and not thick (more vinegar is definitely my preference). My 4 year old talks about this place all the time and recommends it to everyone he meets. The only downside of this place is the line! Come hungry but prepared to wait.

the best i've ever had? 蕁o, that honor goes to Blue Ribbon BBQ in Newton, MA ...but it was definitely very, very good. �Sliced brisket was very tender, I loved that - but I agree with what several people said, it lacked some flavor and definitely needed sauce. 蔊ood portion of meat....I was stuffed after eating maybe 1/4 of the meat. 蔍 wished I had a piece of bread or something with it though...next time I may just get a sandwich instead and save some $$. St Louis Ribs - Nice rub, fall of the bone, hearty. 蔄dd sauce if desired (which I recommend cause their sauces are tasty-see below). �One of us had a taste portion of the pulled pork - which in all fairness I did not try, but was told was very good... I liked both the vinegary sauce and the other thicker smokier/spicy sauce (for the ribs)... Fries were good, not greasy at all, and a pretty good portion I might add! Mac & Cheese - good - pretty small "side" - but not the best I've ever had. 蔵t was ok. �Cole slaw...I actually likes the cole slaw..I am not a fan of mayo and really like citrus so it worked for me. 蔍t was a nice light contrast to what was really heavy meal. �The line never went down, but we did not have to wait for a table either so it worked out. 蔍 never felt rushed to leave, in fact the guys were always good about telling us to take our time. �For three of us to eat it came out to be a little under $60..which was reasonable considering two of us had full platters and the other had 1/2 slab and taste portions, plus drinks. �remember, it's BYOB) I probably would not make this a nightly outing both for financial and health reasons, but I would definitely venture out to Smoque again, if anything to grab a sandwich or two and some of those sides we didn't get to try this time!

Really, really good BBQ - probably some of the best if not the best I've had. 蔉lavorful and wonderful combo of moist yet smokey, sweet, and crisp on the edges - BBQ perfection is what I'd call this. 蔄nd their coleslaw is the best anywhere - crispy with a wonderfully sweet vinegar taste - yum! 蔍 would have given them 5 stars but there is only so far you can go with BBQ food - that and the communal tables were a bit of a turn-off, but for BBQ this good - I'll be back for sure and I'll bring more friends next time ! 蔍f you are a fan of good traditional BBQ - you must try Smoque BBQ !

THE best BBQ in Chicago. No room to dispute this. I've eaten here numerous times and never have been disappointed. The brisket sandwich is absurd. When there's a line out the door on weekday nights you know the food is killer. Besides dining in which is always good, I bought their sauce for ribs I was going to grill. The price was right on par and my family flipped out when the had a taste. There is some great BBQ in Chicago, too bad they all have to stand in Smoque's shadow.

Great BBQ place. Clean tables, prompts service. Just order ribs and do not mess around with their sandwiches. Ribs are the way to go there. Very soft and smoky flavored � they are as good as ribs can be. 蔉or 2 people just get a Full Slab of St Luis Ribs and 2 sides that goes with it for free. That will be plenty for a dinner. Do not order any more additional sides. Their sides are nothing special.

I'm not a big fan or BBQ, but a few friends an I were looking for a place to try and one of them recommended this place. I did not know it was BYOB - so that's an automatic plus for me. That calibrates a lot of expectations, since value is already established. So, I ordered the brisket sandwich, which is advertised as "moist and tender" on the website. I found it to be neither, really. It was good, for sure, but nothing to salivate over.

Mmm...Mmmm...MMMM!! It should be illegal for anything to be this darn good! Let's state the facts. 1). I really enjoy BBQ 2). I really enjoy good BBQ 3). I really enjoy Texas Style BBQ 4). Smoque is the best place in Chicago for really amazing Texas style BBQ. I was expecting some fancy joint with pretty good BBQ. Well, that isn't what I got. Smoque is all about the BBQ, it isn't about the d巆or or being fancy. Smoque is BBQ all the way. I ordered the �/2 slab of St. Louis Ribs with baked beans and mac & cheese, my boyfriend ordered the sliced brisket French fries and cornbread. Let's start with the ribs, they were perfectly cooked. When I say perfectly cooked, that is exactly what I mean. Perfectly cooked ribs DO NOT fall off the bone. Instead they are tender and easy to bite off the bone. I don't like it when I get a rib and the meat falls off, I also don't want to hurt myself trying to eat tough ribs. Smoque's ribs were perfect. The brisket was equally tasty. Fork tender, plastic fork tender!! What? And the bark is amazing. The Mac & Cheese is fantastic, I wish the portions were bigger, it reminded me of my grandmothers Mac & Cheese (and hers is FANTASTIC), so to compare them is a real compliment. The BBQ baked beans were so good! They don't sell that goodness in a can that is for sure. The Fries were fresh cut and cooked to perfection and the cornbread was also fantastic. Next time I will try the pulled pork and the baby back ribs. Heck I might just order one of everything so I don't miss out! Yup, that good

I would like to give 4.5 to 5 stars. The only reason I give 4 instead of 5 star is I need to come back and try more other foods here. It was my first time here. 5:00pm on Sunnday afternoon. We arrived at a perfect time since after we sat down and started eating, the line waiting for order had grown to about 15-person long. I had Sliced brisket and ribs. The meat was tender, juicy and beautifully smoked 蔜he sauce was tasty. The most important thing is that the BBQ food was NOT COLD here, which made big difference from another 2 American style BBQ places I went to during last month. 蔅ut the sweet tea was a lit too sweet to me.

This was my first visit to Smoque in quite a while. The Brisket tasted better than it did on my last visit. The place was packed on the Sunday afternoon I made my visit. But they did a real nice job getting everybody seated. They held your order until you got a table so your food was served up nice and hot. I ordered the Brisket and a side of a Chili. The Chili was listed as the special side of the day. The Chili was fabulous. It was made with Beans, Brisket and onions. It had a nice kick to it. The Brisket was a decent sized sandwich. The Dry Rub they used was tasty. The sauce they use is decent but It could use a bit more heat. I added some Hot sauce to mine to give it a little more of a bite. All things considered, it was a pretty good sandwich. �The bottom line is that Smoque is a nice alternative to the more expensive BBQ joints in Chicago. It's a bare bones dining experience. If you are looking for a fancy night out, you may want to go elsewhere. The interior reminds me of a High School Cafeteria, just a bunch of tables, chairs and Napkin holders. But it was a $9.00 Brisket Sandwich, so I'm"m not complaining. Smoque is good BBQ at a affordable price. I can do without the Bells and Whistles. It's all about the food.

My benchmark for all things bbq is the Salt Lick just outside of Austin, TX. so I have pretty high standards when it comes to my grilled/smoked meats. 蔍 try to judge Chicago bbq by a different standard as it is a different beast and my personal opinion is that you can't really call it bbq if it's made north of the Mason Dixon line. 蔜hen I ate at Smoque... Smoque can hold their own with the best of them, and I'm not talking Chicago bbq standards. 蔜hese people are making bbq RIGHT, Mason Dixon line be damned. 蔜he very best ribs I've ever had in Chicago and, in fact, some of the best I've had anywhere, period. 蔍 got the combo baby back/St. Louis and, although both were excellent, definitely favor the St. Louis style. The brisket...oh...perfect pink smoke ring, gorgeous bark, tender juicy meat. 蔜here isn't a brisket in town that can top it. 蔜he Texas Link IS a Texas Link. 蔋oly moly, I thought I was at some German smokehouse in Texas when I ate that thing - beautifully marbled with fat, smokey, juicy, and a natural casing that gives it a fantastic snap. I'm a happy girl. Sides are also good, I particularly recommend the baked beans which are studded with chunks of porky goodness. 蔒y husband hated the mac and cheese, I loved it. 蔍n fact, I loved it even more on the 2nd day, it's good stuff. 蔜he coleslaw is of the vinegar/pepper based school, not my fave, but has very finely shaved bits of red onion in it that really makes it shine. 蔍n fact, the only thing I've had here that could even be qualified as a disappointment is the pulled pork. 蔇elicious, but not nearly as good as the rest of their menu. 蔜hat fantastic smokey flavor you find in all of their other offerings is lost on this dish. 蔍t's still tender and good, just lacking a bit of oomph/flavor. 蔍t is the one item here that I actually needed to put sauce on. The sauce, btw, is fantastic, but I definitely prefer the lighter Carolina based one. 蔒y one quibble is the lack of white bread - god intended us to eat white bread with our BBQ, dammit, could you just dole out a couple of slices of wonder bread with the cue, please? Pricey, but 1 rib dinner, 1 brisket dinner and a side of pulled pork and a Texas link fed myself and my husband for nearly 3 days, so overall a very good value. 蔆ompared to my beloved Salt Lick, this is a four star joint. That being said, this is Chicago and if you love bbq, you need Smoque in your life, ASAP. 蔍t surpasses the hype and truly raises Chicago bbq to a whole new level.

This place is great if you like barbecue with no soul. They have a good operation going here, consistent mass produced product. Maybe they're trying to be like Carson's or something. I personally like some music and ambiance with my barbecue, and sides that are more unique and authentic. I had some dinner there, meat was way too salty, and again, sterile and super blah ambiance.

This place is so good, I've had the brisket sandwich before but wanted something healthier when I went there today. Instead, I got the small salad (which was huge) with chicken in it. It was really good, and had lots of chicken, sunflower seeds, sun dried tomato, and cucumber. I got BBQ sauce for the chicken and used a teeny bit of the ranch, and it was perfect! I had to hold myself back from ordering cornbread, it's probably awesome though. I've had the mac n' cheese before, and it's really good as well. They were super quick and everyone was smiling and friendly.

Yelp reviews are screwing with my head. OK, now that I got that out the way. We are (wannabe) serious BBQ freaks that find just about any reason in the world to throw ribs on the grill. Although my country style ribs, tenderly loved and slow cooked, are the talk of family, friends and neighbors (straight southerners - which is a compliment), I have yet to get all into the "BBQing every part of a cow and pig" . I promise to do so this summer .... No, you are not invited. At work that morning I was going through reviews on Cuban food when for some odd reason, I ended up looking at a bunch of BBq reviews. I get home and tell my wife to pack up the lil hunie and we headed off to Smoque. I have to admit that the first reviews were given to us by my in-laws about 1 year ago. When we first walked in, I finally understood why people are always touching on the space issue. Yes, it is fairly small and thinly furnished, which is fine with me. Luckily we went around 4pm and it was pretty empty....Goood! The crew was all smiles and seemed upbeat, which is a plus when we visit a new place. Smiles make reviews like this, go up that half a star. The food - Places that get this much attention, usually worry me because they quickly forget about the quality and go for the profits. That was not the case with smoque. We ordered the full slab of baby back ribs, (sides-included) mac and cheese (of course), BBQ beans, cornbread and fries. First off , the mac and cheese is yummy. I rate my mac and cheese on crust only, which this one - had the best. The beans were good but my wife (the bean lover) did not have much of a reaction from them, so I will leave them as OK. The ribs were very tasty and cooked with just the right amount of burn to them. The ribs get a thumbs up from me. I ordered some brisket but in the rib eating frenzy, it got cold, I will leave that rating out. I asked my wife if she wanted to try the pulled pork and she gave a "I am about to explode" yes. The pulled pork sandwich is the best!!!! GO PULLED PORK SANDWICH! The pork melts in you mouth and the sauce (with a touch of Tabasco added by me) is killer! The only negative I have about this joint, is the serving sizes. I know what you are thinking "he is a big guy", but my wife is petite and thought the same thing. I can pop the serving of mac and cheese or the cornbread, into my mouth like a tic tac. I would (and will) go back only for the Pulled Pork sandwich and leave the rest to another BBQ joint or my back yard grill! I give it 3 1/2 stars

an antiseptic bbq for Northsiders (ie, white folks). no rib tips. no hot links. after ordering, i saw a diehard foodie bud who advised me to not bother with the ribs. we promptly changed our order from full slab to briskets/pulled pork and never looked back. the ribs were tinted with smoke tho lacked spices and the good ol porkiness of other ribs from the side south. yes, the fries are good, but if i wanted good fries, i'd just move back to LA and eat in-n-out everyday. go for a cheap beef brisket sandwich and avoid the rest of the menu. A slightly sweet, slighty tangy, barely spicy, not-to-thick/not-to-think sauce was the saving grace. Alas, the sauce is not the boss. Barbara Ann's, Lem's, Mack's, George's (on Sibley) even Honey1, all have better offerings.

My dad had raved about this place after seeing it on Diners, Drive-Ins, and Dives...so off we went on a random Tuesday afternoon. 蔍 was immediately impressed when, upon walking in, the uncle of the owner was right by the cash register to help us decide what to order (since my dad apparently wanted one of everything on the menu, ha!) 蔍 ordered half of a pulled pork with mac and cheese (SO good!) and cornbread, and my dad ordered ribs and a taste of brisket along with some fries and baked beans. 蔠hat really sold me, however, was not the delicious food (which is every bit as amazing as everyone says) but the fact that the owner's uncle checked in on us, asked my dad how his ribs and brisket were, and gave him a free new 1/4 slab of ribs when my dad remarked that his were a little dry! 蔜he "new" ribs that he was given were much better and we left with full bellies and a smile on our faces. �I rarely even eat meat, and honestly loved this place. 蔍'll definitely be coming back!

I'm usually pretty wary of barbecue served by people as pasty as I am, but Smoque went a long way towards assuaging my doubt. I was greeted by a line out the door, which I bypassed since I ordered ahead for takeout (recommended). The line looked like it was moving quickly; I'd guess people were waiting about 20 minutes to order at 7pm on a Friday, and there were a few tables open for people to sit down. The cafeteria-style seating looked serviceable, but Smoque clearly isn't a destination for its atmosphere. I sampled the pulled pork, links, and brisket. They were out of St. Louis-style ribs. A sign over the register indicated that they had been having quality control issues. The pulled pork was excellent. Not as juicy as I would've liked, but very good nonetheless, with a deep, flavorful bark. The meat was slightly sweet, with a good amount of smoke. Not the best pulled pork I've had in the city, but definitely up there. I usually shy away from BBQ beef in Chicago; we're a pork town. However, the links and brisket were both outstanding. Honestly, the first BBQ beef I've had in Chicago that I would order again. The links had a great snap to the casing, with a spicy, peppery, floral top-note over the sweet beef. Just outstanding quality meat, very juicy. The brisket was the first I've had outside of Austin that I enjoyed. Very, very tender and juicy, with a healthy amount of smoke throughout. Not too fatty, but not nearly as mealy as some of the leaner briskets I've had before. Great bark, as well. The only real let-down was the sauce. A cloying, citrusy mess. Like a mix between OJ concentrate and molasses. The meat was good enough that I enjoyed all of it without sauce, but I was surprised by the sauce. Seemed like they were trying to do something unique instead of just making a quality complement to the meat. Summary: Not my favorite BBQ joint in the city (around 71st Street is still the standard), but definitely one of the better options out there. Outstanding beef options in a pork-obsessed town. Ate my food with a good rauchbier. Smoky goodness.

How have I not reviewed Smoque until now??? 蔛weet Jesus, this place is unreal. 蔍t is mouth-wateringly delicious from beginning to end. 蔍 get the beef briscuit when I go and it makes me want to grunt and moan when I eat it, it's so succulent and amazing. 蔜heir BBQ sauce is perfection. 蔜he sides - THE SIDES! 蔕kay, so on paper, none of the sides appeal to me. 蔍 don't like mac and cheese, I don't like baked beans and I don't like peach anything. 蔄t SMOQUE, I crave all of the aforementioned foods. 蔈very single side is homemade perfection. 蔍 actually order every. single. side. when I go even though that's enough food to feed a starving family. 蔍 have to have one of everything. 蔜hese guys don't mess around and deserve all the accolades they've received. 蔍 live in the NW suburbs and truck ass all the way here to eat the best BBQ in the state. 蔣ou will not regret going to Smoque.

After all this time, I finally went back after much cajoling from the husband. 蔔ot likely to happen again. 蔛till as dry as ever and I am not interested in any of the sides that they have. �4 for a half sandwich of dried-out pork on a weird bun is not my thing. 蔋usband tore into his half slab of ribs with fries, cornbread and coleslaw and when I asked about why he was not eating anything but the ribs and fries he said, "I love the ribs and the fries are okay, but the rest I could do without." 蔄nd why do you come here all the time then? 蔉ind a place that has everything to offer.

I ordered the ribs and approximately 30 minutes later they yelled my name. I got up and retrieved my order from the counter and right away I could tell something wasn't quite right. The ribs were so dry, I thought I had mistakenly ordered beef jerky. All the mediocre BBQ sauce in the restaurant could not have helped me choke those ribs down. I am a big fan of smoke flavored BBQ, but this place took it to an entirely new level. The meat tasted like someone dropped a napalm bomb into a pig pen. The staff behind the counter was so aloof you'd have better luck carrying a conversation with your scorched meal. Very disappointing.

Ohhhh gawd.... Still drooling... Still full... and still wanting more of that delicious pulled pork sandwich in MA BELLAY!! I finally convinced the husband to brave Saturday afternoon traffic so we could head over to Smoque and have us a BBQ lunch. 蔠e showed up around 1pm to a full house--plenty of folks getting their Q to go, plenty of others sitting at tables with their BYOB drinks in hand, saucy smiles on their faces. 蔠e waited in line for a few minutes, not a big deal at all, and enjoyed the smoky goodness in the air. 蔍 scored a table while Justin ordered for us and a few minutes later, I was in hog heaven. 蔍 had the 1/2 sandwich of pulled pork, a pile of flavorful, tender meat with a bit of sauce on top, all on a very nice bun (we're not talking Wonder Bread buns here, kids). 蔜he sandwich was great, but even better when I piled my side of coleslaw on top. 蔍 love the slaw--it's not the mayo-laden kind, but a super crisp, fresh slaw with a bite--a perfect companion to the pork. 蔍 got a side of BBQ beans (oh man, these were good) and some peach cobbler so I could get the full Smoque experience, which of course wouldn't be complete if I hadn't stolen some of Justin's mac n' cheese. �蔋e said it was the best mac n' cheese he'd ever had and even though it hurts my ego to agree (I DO make a mean homemade M&C myself), it's true--I've never had such creamy, rich, flavorful mac n' cheese... By the time it was peach cobbler time, my tummy was already full--nothing a little "pattin' it down" couldn't help, though. �The cobbler was very good and even though my stomach was way full, I was glad I didn't have to share with Justin--his enormous brisket sandwich was more than enough for him. 蔠e stuffed ourselves silly for under $20. 蔄 delicious deal! Smoque is a hoppin' place, unpretentious (I mean, come on, it IS a BBQ joint after all), comfortable and lively. 蔍f you come during the rush, be prepared to wait a few minutes and to vie for a table. 蔣ou'll probably get to meet one of the owners if you choose to eat in--one of them was making the rounds, chatting up his customers and making sure everyone was happy. 蔊o now before it's even more packed, thanks to its mention in this month's issue of Gourmet... 蔍 can't wait to head back for some St. Louis-style ribs. 蔄nd more cobbler. :)

If I don't eat at Smoque at least three times in one week, I am not a happy girl. 蔜oo much Smoque? No such thing. Being from the south, I was hesitant when I first heard about this supposedly amazing barbeque restaurant in Chicago. However, I regret not going to Smoque sooner and regret missing out on their delicious brisket and warm, cheesy macaroni and cheese. This place far exceeds anything I have ever found in the south! I have brought countless people in front out of town to Smoque and am always thanked for sharing such an outstanding new world of barbeque with them.

I don't think I had ever eaten sliced beef brisket before in my life. 蔅ut my dad insisted that it is the best, so I ordered it. 蔍 inhaled the entire sandwich (after carefully adding their tangy, tasty sauce). 蔜he brisket was very nearly as soft and chewy as the bun that surrounded it. 蔍ncredible flavor. 蔠e also ordered the mac & cheese on the side, and loved it. 蔜he small side order of mac & cheese is not big at all, so don't plan to be all "healthy" and share it... get your own!! �It is very close to the highway, so it was very easy to pick up my order to go. 蔣ou MUST go here.

A few weeks ago, my fiance and I made our inaugural trips to both Detroit and Slows Bar-B-Q, returning home with glowing things to say about both. 蔍 posted a review on Yelp talking about our really positive (and delicious) experience at Slows, and almost immediately received a note back from another Yelper, telling me that Slows was good, but Smoque was "10x better". 蔛o, when I was in Chicago and my friend Keem suggested that we go to Smoque for lunch for delicious, delicious BBQ, I was suitably intrigued. 蔄ND also hungry. We met up with other lady friends at Smoque on a sunny Super Bowl Sunday afternoon, our mouths watering by the time we walked in the door. 蔄 number of people were in and out picking up Super Bowl catering orders while we made our selections - in fact, about half of the restaurant was blocked off for Super Bowl pick-ups - and justifiably so, as this is just the kind of grub I'd want at my Super Bowl party, were I to have one. 蔠e all settled on pulled pork sandwiches, available in the full or half size, with varying sides. 蔍 had a vinegary cole slaw and a very large bag of hand-cut fries that we all shared - in addition, the others tried the cornbread and the macaroni and cheese, both baked in little foil ramekins. 蔕ur sandwiches came with a bit of tangy sauce ladled over the top and a small cup of vinegary sauce to add at our discretion. 蔉or me, the half sandwich, shared sides, and a soda were just the right size for lunch - though I regretted not being able to try the brisket (available chopped or sliced) and the various ribs on the menu. How does it compare to Slows? 蔍n my non-expert opinion, I'd say they're just different animals. 蔛lows has a more expansive menu, but what Smoque does, it does well. 蔍 liked having more sauce options at Slows, but I also liked the simplicity of the Smoque experience. 蔍 felt like the meat was more flavorful at Slows, but I liked being able to get a half portion AND sides for a lower price at Smoque. 蔅BQ is something many people take seriously, and I am not one of them, but I am grateful that Slows is nearby, and that I can visit Smoque whenever I'm in Chicago.

After my girlfriend saw Smoque on DDD, we basically craved ribs for the whole of last week. We eventually made it to Smoque on Friday, and I have to say I was a bit disappointed. We ended up getting the St. Louis ribs and also a separate order of brisket. Maybe it's what I like about ribs, but I found the ribs to be slightly dry, and the brisket a bit too tough. Maybe I'm just being harsh, but I like my ribs to fall off the bone. The sides were similarly disappointing. The mac n' cheese and slaw was blah and the cornbread similarly dry. The only good thing was probably the beans which were quite delicious. I also tasted some of the fries which I loved but only wish I ordered. The service was quick and friendly, it's only too bad that there are so many people I feel like I have to leave right after eating. Overall, it was a good experience, but nothing to brag about.

This is some of the best BBQ I've ever had. Service was acceptable, food was ready promptly and taste was amazing. We had brisket- soooo tender, baby back ribs- fall-off-the-bone good and charred just right, pulled pork- good but not as amazing as the other two meats, Mac & cheese- perfect!, beans- flavorful and smoky good, fries-1 order is enough for 2 people and cornbread- very good. Cole slaw is served with everything and it was just okay (it's more of a vinegar based and we prefer creamy type). You cannot go wrong at this place!

If you dig vinegar-based BBQ sauce (which I do), then this is the place for you. 蔅risket sandwich (widely and positively reviewed) deserves the recognition. 蔜o me, though, you shouldn't skip the ribs, especially the spare ribs. 蔜hey have two sauces, and one is technically tomato-based, but even that has a pretty strong hit of vinegar. 蔍 love both sauces. 蔒y only wish is a spicy sauce option, which they don't have. 蔄s an added bonus, they have the best sides of any BBQ joint we've been to. 蔜he coleslaw has no mayo, the mac and cheese is delicious and plenty crusty on top, and the fries are fresh-cut and seasoned well. 蔈verything is super well executed. 蔠e will be back for sure!

Holy Smoque! After yet another fine meal at Smoque, I had to do it some justice and give back by writing a stellar review. Summary: It is a BYOB that serves BBQ - that's it! They don't have burgers, chicken wings, gyros, or hot dogs, because that is not what they do. I am tired of reading reviews that complain about not having a steak or a burger on the menu. Its a BBQ joint, not a steak house...get over it! Anyway, back to the topic I love and know well...BBQ! Smoque caters to the traditional BBQ lover. It has pulled pork, brisket, ribs (baby back and St. Louis style), hot links, chicken, and a few simple sides that are all outstanding. 蔅ased on what type of meat you order, they have a sauce type that is specific to each meat. While you can stray from this sauce, you should give it a try as it was specially designed to compliment the meat (not over power it). They cook and base their sauce on the geographic region that is most well known for the meat: Pulled Pork - Carolinas Brisket and Hot Links - Texas Ribs - St. Louis and Memphis They have done their home work because I have eaten at some of the best BBQ joints in all of those regions and can say that Smoque does a good, if not better, job than some of the best BBQ joints in that area. The best tell tale sign of a good BBQ is if the meat can stand alone and not require sauce. Well, I have to say, Smoque's meat stands on its own like a new graduate from the Marines. It has an outstanding rub and is smoked to perfection. The portions are very reasonable as is the price. And if you can't make up your mind on what to order, you can add a "taste" of any of their meats for a small charge. Food: Pulled Pork - Great! As with all of their meats, it is available as a sandwich or a platter. It is tender, smokey, and has a good mixture of juicy center pork with the crunchier, spice rubbed outer part of the shoulder. Classic pulled pork with a thin vinegar based sauce which compliments the meat well. Brisket - Smoque's most famous item and what they do best. The brisket beats almost all of the Texas BBQ places I have been to. It is available sliced or chopped. The sliced brisket is juicier and so excellent. The chopped brisket is from the end of the brisket and is much leaner and probably my favorite thing on the menu. The sauce is a thicker sauce that is pretty tangy and should be used sparingly. Ribs - The ribs are amazing. They offer both St. Louis style and Baby Back style ribs. The baby backs are a little smaller, leaner, and a tad bit more money, while the St. Louis ribs are a little larger. St. Louis ribs get a bad rap for being fatty, but not at Smoque. They are pre-trimmed and are almost as lean, if not leaner, as the Baby Backs. In fact, if you ask the owners, they will probably steer you to try the St. Louis ribs. I always order the St. Louis ribs unless they are out of them. They are meatier, tastier, and just great. The ribs are not the typical boiled/broiled Chicago style ribs that my Gramma can eat without her dentures. Rather, they have a little "tug" to them, as Smoque puts it, and a great texture; the way ribs ought to be. The outer part of the rib has a really nice crust to it from the rub and the smoking process. The ribs are one item I never use sauce for...I always eat them dry. If you prefer the sauce, it is a thicker tomato based sauce and is somewhat of a hybrid of Memphis style and Kansas City style. It is pretty tasty, but as I mentioned, good ribs don't need sauce. Chicken - Well, its chicken and tastes like chicken. Decent, but not great. Why go to a BBQ joint to get chicken with all of the other options. Pass on the chix and go with the beef or pork items. Sausages/Hot Links - These were ok. I am not a huge fan of sausage, but they really didn't impress me at all. They really tasted very simple. 蔛ee above regarding the my recommendation on the chicken. 蔍f you are a big sausage fan, then you might enjoy them. Beans - To die for! 蔜hey are so good! Smoque takes pieces of chopped brisket and onion and adds them to the beans. They then smoke the beans in the smoker to perfection. I have never had BBQ beans as good as these. Hands down! They definitely aren't your standard Bush beans from the can. This is the best side dish on the menu, in my opinion. Mac and Cheese - Well done indeed. They use fresh cheese and hand make it. They top it with bread crumbs and toast the top of it. I am not a huge Mac and Cheese guy, but if you are, this one will be a hit with you. Fries: Hand cut fries that are decent. 蔝nless you have to have fries, consider other options. Sauce: Overall, I will say the sauce is good. 蔔ot the best I have had, but it does its job. Finally: �If you haven't already, check these guys out. They are the real deal and have great food. If you don't believe me, check out their BBQ Manifesto on their website. They did their research and really know BBQ!

I'd give it 4.5 stars if I could. nothing was bad. I have been several times, and everything is consistently good. I just have a couple small complaints. Nothing special about the mac and cheese. The Beef Brisket is not as tender as it should be. But I would definitely recommend Smoque.

My boyfriend and I came here after hearing rave reviews that claimed BBQ that was BETTER than our beloved Fat Willy's. 蔕f course, we had to try it. �After a few drives down Pulaski, we finally found it. 蔍t's at the end of a series of brick storefronts and didn't have a very prominent sign or anything that I can remember if you're driving southbound. 蔍f you're driving northbound up Pulaski, you should find it with no problem because the restaurant faces south. 蔛moque lost a star because we got there at 5:00 p.m . Saturday hoping to beat the rush (ha!) and waited for 40 minutes (I get really crabby while waiting). 蔄lso, while we were in line considering just ordering for takeout, my boyfriend called and tried to place an order. 蔍 guess his fault was starting off a sentence with "I'm in line outside, but I would like to place a take-out order..." �Apparently the woman that answered the phone was really confused by the situation and told him she couldn't take a take-out order from him if he was in line. 蔜he boyfriend stepped out of line, as she had asked him to and then she hung up on him. 蔠TH?!? 蔠e didn't realize it was such an issue and no one explained whether or not the line we were in was for take-out or dine-in. 蔜here were some other people in line wondering the same thing and to this day, we still don't know. ��Inside, there's really not much room for seating and everything is packed really close. 蔠hen you see a good spot, you still can't take it until you've ordered, as we saw and learned from an older couple in front of us. 蔜he girl that took our order was really nice but the rest of the staff behind her in the ktichen looked like chickens with their heads cut off. 蔍t was very frantic. 蔠e were seated by the end, right next to the line of people waiting to order (Can you say totally uncomfortable?) and I kept getting bumped so much that we had to move. Onto the food, finally, after nearly an hour of waiting around! 蔍 ordered the ribs combo because I'm a ribs-kind-of-girl. 蔅ecause I wanted to try both, I had the St. Louis ribs and the baby backs. 蔠hile they were both delicious and came off the bone clean without being tough and were very well seasoned without being drowned in sauce, we both agreed that Fat Willy's was still better. 蔋owever, the Smoque St. Louis ribs were better than the Smoque baby backs ribs --much meatier, substantial and yummier by far. 蔒y boyfriend had the chopped brisket platter. 蔆ontrary to everyone's opinions, we didn't think they were all they had been talked up to be. 蔍 felt like it was a little too much of the sauce. 蔅etween the two of us, we had four sides--cornbread, baked beans, mac & cheese and coleslaw. 蔒ost of the sides come in a 3.5 inch diameter aluminum foil cup. 蔉or the mac and cheese, this was not enough! 蔒y favorite thing at Smoque is the mac & cheese because I seriously don't think I've had better. 蔜he sides portions are tiny--I think my mac & cheese may have been 5-6 bites at most. 蔅ut I think if I do decide to come again (at some off peak time so I don't have to wait an hour), I have to order 4 sides of mac & cheese or something with the St. Louis ribs. To conclude, we walked away with Fat Willy's still as our favorite because while the mac & cheese and St. Louis ribs definitely gives Fat Willy's a run for the money, we prefer not to wait for forever and prefer not to be 2 inches from other people eating.

Being a bbq fiend and a certified bbq judge, I had to seek out some barbeque during my Chicago trip. 蔇ue to my limited time frame, I was only able to hit up one spot and I decided on Smoque after a good bit of research. 蔍 got up early for the sole purpose of hitting up Smoque even though it was way out of the way (I used 3 modes of transportation to get there - very rare for an Atlantan). I managed to arrive a little bit after they opened and beat the crowds. �Due to a lack of breakfast, an intense desire to sample everything on the menu, and that sense of abandon you sometimes feel on vacation, I ended up with an absolutely obscene smorgasbord of food sitting in front of me (check the pics). 蔇espite the grueling task facing me, I totally devoured all of it like a boss. �The Meat: - �/2 rack of baby back ribs - These were pretty good - maybe B+/A-. 蔜hey had a nice smokiness and bark to them. 蔜he texture was solid (not extremely tough or "falling off the bone"), but they could have been a little more tender. Overall, they were tasty, but could've been a little better. 蔋owever, they were my favorite of the three meats I sampled. �- pulled pork - The pork was decent - a B-. 蔍t was nicely-pulled, had a nice bit of smoke and was tender. 蔋owever, it was probably cooked a little too long as some parts were borderline mushy. 蔍t also seemed to be a little underseasoned too me. 蔍t was also served with the sauce already on - which is a no-no (good meat should be able to stand on its own). �- brisket - This was fairly good - a solid B. 蔜he flavor was pretty good on the brisket, but it had what I've found to be a common problem with brisket - dryness. 蔜he brisket was a bit on the dry side. 蔍t was also served with the sauce already on which in nearly all circumstance I don't like but here it didn't really matter since it helped combat the dryness. ��The Other Stuff: - sauce - Not bad, but not really memorable either. 蔏inda sweet, kinda vinegary. �- mac & cheese - I love m&c that has a crumbly/crunchy top so I really liked that aspect. 蔜he rest underneath the crust was good as well, but didn't have the smooth gooeyness that I like. 蔉lavor was pretty good throughout. �- fries - The bag of fries the most impressive thing I ate there. 蔠ho would expect it, right? 蔅ut seriously, they were excellent - hot, fresh, crispy on the outside/soft in the middle, well seasoned. 蔍 wish everyone could do fries like this. 蔒aybe they were just really spot on that day with them though. 蔠ho knows. 蔇are I say - maybe the best I've had in '09? - cole slaw - Kudos to them for having a non-mayo-based coleslaw (mayo sucks). 蔍t had a lot of potential to be really good, but it was so sour/tart that I couldn't eat much of it. 蔐essen the acidity (lemon juice maybe?) and it'd be solid. �- peach cobbler - I didn't get a picture since I ordered it to-go afterwards and ate it later, but there is a pic of it already up. 蔄nyway, it was very good though a bit non-traditional for a cobbler (crumble top, somewhat heavily spiced). �- sweet tea - It was ok - better than I would expect for a Midwestern joint. Non-food Impressions - The staff seemed top-notch: competent, friendly, & helpful. - The restaurant is certainly nice enough for a bbq joint. 蔍 like the large menu on the wall. �- The layout of the restaurant seems problematic though. 蔜he arrangement of the line, the drinks, the food pickup, and the layout of the tables seems poor. 蔣ou have to go all over the place and through lots of people if it's crowded. 蔜here's no logic or flow to it. 蔍 didn't have the problem since there was hardly anyone there when I went, but I'd bet it's pretty chaotic when there's actually a bit of a crowd. 蔋owever, I realize that they might be doing the best they can with the space they have to work with so, if that's true, you can't fault them too much. �Overall, Smoque was pretty tasty and serves up some good bbq. 蔍 wouldn't be surprised if it's the best bbq that Chicago has to offer. 蔍t's better than quite a few places in the A even. 蔄nyway, hitting up Smoque was definitely an adventure - and a satisfying one at that. �Smoke meat everyday. 4 [Ed.

After dozens of trips here for the great BBQ and being well-acquainted with the controlled chaos that is Smoque, last night the chaos was frankly "uncontrolled" and we left feeling like we'd been abused. Normal sized line, yet after we ordered we then had to stand around for about 45 minutes waiting for our chow, vs. the usual 15-20 (this is after ordering). The place was jammed, shoulder to shoulder to the extent that you couldn't move. Want to get to the drink dispenses - forget it, hopeless. We were at the point of abandoning our $40 and just leaving when we finally got to sit down. When we said something to the staff they said "this is normal". Well, as I said we've been there dozens of times and it was NOT normal. At one point I counted close to 200 people in there, when the sign says occupancy by more that 45 is illegal and dangerous. Yes, it was. As far as we could tell the kitchen was in meltdown, and there were long pauses where no food was served up whatsoever. Then it became so out of order it was a a joke - at one point they were calling numbers in the 40's and the 90s at the same time. It finally became apparent that the problem was they'd run out of ribs ready to serve, when suddenly trays started flying off the counter. Only problem? The ribs we finally got were so dry and overcooked they could better have been served with a pickaxe. If they'd served them when they were done rather than overdone all would likely have been fine. There are hundreds of other rib joints in Chicago and I'm walking with my feet and giving some other places a try.

We have been hearing about Smoque for some time but it was just a little to far to travel. 蔠e were presented with the perfect opportunity this Sat to head in that direction. We arrived around 11:30 and the place was already starting to pick up. 蔛o we scoured the board for the goody details we were about to order. 蔔ow I have to say one thing really kicks off the experience is a very helpful and pleasant cashier/order taker. 蔜his lady was extremely pleasant and answered all of our questions with a smile. I ordeed the chopped brisket with mac and cheese. 蔇avid have the 1/2 and 1/2 with mac and cheese and baked beans. 蔒y meal was excellent, very tender and cooked to perfection. 蔜he mac and cheese was very good and just the right size. David said he enjoyed the pulled pork over the brisket but found both to be tasty. 蔔ow these bean he ordered had to be excellent as I thought he was going to lick the bowl when he was done. �They really have the process down and get you in and out of there. 蔍 rolled myself out of there and onto the Pulaski bus for a quick trip home. 蔍 am sure we will be back...we now have a reason to head in that direction again.

Smoque gets 5 stars when thinking about BBQ available in Chicago and a solid 3 stars for their BBQ effort overall when taking in competitors from other states/cities. �Probably not much to add to 466 reviews but will do so nonetheless: - Baked beans were fantastic...bits of brisket and chunks of onion? 蕋hese beans were almost as good as my Great Grandmother used to make and she made the best damn beans imaginable. 蔊ood beans are absolutely essential for any BBQ place looking for street cred. - I was happy with my brisket sandwich but not blown away. 蔒eat was nice and tender but maybe a bit too tender and I didn't distinguish a unique flavor to it. 蔄lso, I did not like the egg bun that was used. 蔒aybe I haven't had it "Texas style" but whenever I get great brisket in KC it comes with Wonder bread. 蔜he egg bun just created confusion. 蔖retty standard overall but the best available in the city of Chicago. - St. Louis ribs were outstanding. 蔉ell off the bone nicely but not too easily...just the way I like it. �- Cole slaw was outstanding...I much, much prefer vinegar-based slaw to mayo-based and Smoque did it right! - Sauces: thicker rib sauce had very good flavor to it. 蔎ust enough kick to let you know it's there. 蔜he more vinegary sauce that came w/ my brisket was also very good with a little more kick. - Scenery: A not insignificant number of hotties eating at Smoque. 蔔othing sexier than a hot blonde wolfing down a pulled pork sandwich. Overall, I'm on the Smoque bandwagon. 蔋ard to believe it took someone this long to come up with a good BBQ joint in this city.

Best BBQ I've ever eaten! 蔜he Brisket was tender and lean, the pulled pork melted in my mouth, the Texas-style sauce was tangy and thin, the best mac and cheese i've ever eaten as well (covered in buttery breadcrumbs). 蔜here's a bit of a wait now that the place has appeared on several local and national television shows, but its well worth it. 蔞ery Decent prices for BBQ, much less awesome BBQ. 蔜he pulled pork and brisket were each $10 and included coleslaw and two other sides, which amounted to a decent portion of food.

I have to admit, from the sound of things I expected a sort of quick sling, four-white-walled bbq diner. 蔕n my first vist I would say that this place is pretty good. 蔍 consider myself knowledgable in the bbq arts and believe that this place is worth frequenting. 蔍 am very happy that this place has opened up so close to me. 蔜he dining room was clean and had some color to it (definitely wasn't as harsh as I was expecting). 蔜he macaroni was awesome, I definitely could've gone for a larger portion but then again it was just a side; the slaw was more salad like than slawish... but was good to me. 蔜he bread they used for the sandwiches was pretty delicious. 蔖lus there is the choice of fountain drink or canned soda so you're set for either take out or dine-in. 蔜he bathroom was very clean, germaphobes would appreciate it in there. Here are my flaws with it: 1. When I eat b-b-que I expect large heaping portions. 蔠hile the sandwich I ate was reasonable, at 6.95 for just a sandwich I would've expected a bit more. 2. The meat verged on being delicious... maybe once they get their technique and recipie down better they'll achieve greatness, but right now i'd say it was good. 3. 蔍t was a bit chilly in the dining area... won't be a problem during the summer months, but I bet it will be nice and cool with the central heating and air. I look forward to coming back here and trying other things so that I can get a more well-rounded opinion. 蔄s of right now I'm coming back and looking forward to chowing down.

Smoque has the Best tasting bbq meat I've ever tasted. The only thing holding me back from giving it the coveted fifth star is the fact that I'm not really into the sauce. It's not a bad sauce , but I'm a smokey flavored sweet thick Kansas city style sauce. The sauce at Smoque is more of a vinegar based heavily spiced sauce, pretty thin. I have tried the baby back ribs (fantastic) and the pulled pork (equally fantastic). The baked beans are the best I've had and the cole slaw is very good. I even love the hand cut fries , great. The prices are lowish average , and the dining room is nothing to shake a stick at , but clean. This is my new official favorite bbq joint , if I pick up a jar of Heckys in Evanston's sauce and caramelize it a bit , I'll probably have a plate full of 5 star ribs. ... Had the brisket , I was not a fan of it until I had it here , I really like the brisket here. The peach cobbler was just alright , did the job. This time I got 2 different sauces , one with the brisket and pulled pork , thin and vinegary-y. The other sauce came with the ribs and was much better suited for it , way thicker , sweeter and enough to bag the elusive fifth star.

I've never eaten here in person, but whenever one of my friends hosts a party, Smoque is the place of choice for informal get-togethers. They have been pretty consistent with the taste and quality, which is alot to say when you have to feed 10-20 people. I am a fan of their dry rub ribs, no so much of their pulled pork, which tastes overcooked. The brisket is nicely done and juicy, and the mac-n-cheese puts the store variety to shame. One of these days I will get around to going there in person, but for now, my ribs come in a pan. Yes, I fight for the left-overs.

the best bbq i've ever had in my 30 years of existence. 蕀aybe it's cuz i'm from LA where bbq isn't as big of a thing as it is in the midwest? 蕎ho knows but i went twice in two weeks because i couldn't get those ribs and brisket out of my mind!!! 蔵 tried both the baby back and st. louis style ribs. 蔵 couldn't totally tell the difference between the two but i didn't care because they were both just so good. 蔭nd the brisket...melt in your mouth deliciousness!!!!! 蕎hat i loved was that all the sauces were on the side, not overslathered on the ribs. 蕋he peach cobbler is a must have. 蔒UST have! 蔵 wasn't the biggest fan of their cole slaw but soon realized it helps out to have a light veggie side in the midst of all that meat! the line can get long but it's a pretty quick turnaround for a smaller sized restaurant. 蔭nd even with the order at the counter and pick up your food style, the service is great! 蔵 had a man (maybe the owner or manager?) come up to our table to make sure everything was ok and made sure we had the hot bbq sauce and jalapenos to eat with the brisket! 蕋hey help you with the seating so you don't have to hover around people as they eat just to get a table.

consistent and price-conscious meat-oriented barbecue: + meat is good enough to stand on its own + friendly and attentive staff and owner + conveniently located off blue line + still relatively inexpensive as barbecue goes - closed monday - sometimes suffers from its own success through food shortages with all this corn going to subsidized ethanol initiatives, it's getting harder to get good beef at a reasonable price. 蕁evertheless, and despite a few recent forgivable inconsistencies*, smoque has managed to deliver a quality product while still maintaining value to the customer. 蕋he store keeps no inventory, and hence, their capacity for the day is their smokers' capacity. 蔲resh food at a reasonable price means long lines and when the food's out, it's out--this used to be a major issue, but has become more reasonable in recent months. i'm one of these morons that eschews barbecue sauce. i was so pleased to learn that smoque not only offered their meat without sauce, but that their meaty offering was actually good enough to stand on its own legs without sauce (contrast with tango sur or gibson's). the pork and the brisket are doubtless the items of interest here. 蕅uite frankly, they're the only items of interest at any good barbecue joint. 蔮ack ribs are also quite tasty, but aren't as good a value for your money as the boneless meats. �* i've had food from smoque about 20 times since it's opened, which has been consistently good. 蕋he few times it's fallen off i can treat as anomalies and hopefully not a sign of things going south.

Smoque BBQ Survival Guide 1. Parking The restuarant is in the middle of a neighborhood with not much around but houses so street parking seems ample with no meters. The lot directly behind Smoque is for another business during most of the day but becomes available to anyone after 5:30pm for no charge. 2. Times to go I arrived at 6:30pm and there was no line. Good time to go. After 7pm a line was out the door and was still there as I was leaving around 8pm. A not so good time. During the afternoon I'm not sure for I've only eaten dinner here. 3. Seating There are no servers but as you wait in line to order your food a nice employee will walk up to you and ask how many people you are eating with. He will then try to find a place for you and your friends to sit together amongst the bustling little seating area. This is not a great place for groups. The second time I went here I was in a group of 11 and we were split up at two different tables. Not a big deal but it will happen. Whoever you go with though expect to interact with your neighbors. The tables are close to one another and the seating area is usually full. It's kind of fun but it doesn't create a great atmosphere for long coversations or a romantic evening. If you come here you should come here to eat and little else. 4. Food The brisket is very tender. More so than I am used to but it is meaty and delicious and I think my favorite item on the menu. Their baby back ribs took me a second try to really like them. The main issue is that their ribs are blackened more than I've seen before and come dry with a vinager based BBQ sauce on the side. Their ribs are not the sweet, sticky, saucy, ribs I have come to expect when I order baby backs. But give them a second go at another visit or eat your left overs the next day and I bet they will grow on you. I did not try a side I didn't like. The fries were fresh cut and great. The macaroni and cheese was brilliant with a nice creaminess in the middle and a crunchiness on top. The coleslaw was a tasty vinager based one that really helped cut down all the meaty, creamy, and starchy flavors I was eating. For dessert I had the peach cobbler which was great and I don't even like peach cobbler. Food here is good and of the BBQ places I've tried in Chicago: Twin Anchors, Cooper's, Ruby's, this is hands down my favorite. 5. General Tips Be ready to be stared at. Because the menu is posted on a wall right behind you as you sit and eat, the people waiting in line to order have nothing to do but read that menu, stare at your food, and watch you to see if you are leaving so they can get your seat. Don't be afraid to talk to the employees. Yes, they are busy, but I had a worker get me some ketchup, answer my questions about BBQ sauce, and take my garbage. They are there to help and seem happy to do so. If you are coming to this restaurant because of the television show, "Diners, Drive-ins, and Dives" don't be afraid to say you are. They fully embrace their tv fame with a huge signed poster of Guy Fieri on the wall and books to buy at the cash register. A good neighbor ice breaker: What did you order?

I think I would be an idiot if I said their BBQ wasn't that good. It's good, we all know this. Could the experience be better? Hell yes....if I rated this place 3 stars, I would be adminiting that their BBQ is just OK, which it isnt. It's better than OK. 4 stars means I'm a fan... but is waiting in a long-ass line, lining up with the other sardines for your food, grabbing your prison platter of BBQ and sqautting at a small table all worth it? Some people may say yes, depending on the 'Que. Personally, I don't think it's worth all of the fuss. Next time I visit, I will be ordering to go!

Over the course of this past weekend, I've been there twice already. 蔍ts only Tuesday night and I'm thinking I should stop by before the weekend hits. �Due to always just seeing the restaurant in passing, I always thought it was a traditional sit down. 蔍ts not! 蔍ts just a joint. �Where can you find an awesome pulled pork sandwich for only $7.95. 蔣ou can also do a brisket, sliced or chopped. 蔕R try their 1/2 & 1/2, any two, how kick ass is that. 蔍've had both the St. Louis ribs and the Baby backs. 蔆an't decide... 蕐ou have to see which cut of meat you love best. 蔊et this.. you can add a side of say.. 1/4 portion of St. Louis ribs.. or a portion of brisket 蕂r pulled pork for just $3 bucks. �Now onto the sides. 蔅aked macaroni and cheese is DAMN good. 蔵ts baked!.. its got this crunchy coating on top.. and oh so moist. 蔣ou can't share a side of it. 蔣ou have to have your own. 蔍t sucks that their "large" order is just two smalls. 蔠hoopdedoo. Cole slaw is just alright. 蔍ts topped with a bit of red onion. 蔜heir fries are fuckin awesome. 蔄nd whats kick ass is that they reheat very well. 蔜he beans are also yum. 蔛weet with a bit of its own tang. Their sauce is smokey. 蔉or those of you that don't particularly take to smokey.. let me say.. I agree with you. 蔍 don't usually go for that flavor. This sauce however.. is smokey and a little spicy. 蔍ts got a lil' kick on it, you may grow to love. I wish they would offer a homemade lemonade.. 蔍 think that would seal the deal on this great eat. BYOB.

We ordered rib combo (1/2 slab of St louis and baby back ribs), sliced brisket, cornbread and mac & cheese. The best thing of them all was the brisket. It was tender, juicy, and melt in your mouth. Everything else was average. I would go back just for the brisket.

I admit, I am not a BBQ expert, or even fanatic. But this food is yum-yum-YUMMY. The price seems just a smidge high by typical BBQ food standards. But you leave feeling so full and satisfied, it's worth it once in a while. The order at the cash register then go find a seat system might make some first-timers feel a bit lost or apprehensive. The place is too small for its own good. It's so popular, there's usually a long line anytime, anyday. The rib portions are very small for the price. But the chicken is a pretty healthy size. The side dishes are perhaps what push this place over the top for me. The mac and cheese and peach cobbler are to die for! This may not be a good place for kids if you're carting a bulky stroller or have a picky eater. That means more mac n cheese for me! I suggest this place find a bigger place to serve more fans of their eats.

Oh Smoque. You are quirky and delicious. I have been to Smoque twice and can say that if you go during the primetime you will have to deal with the long line (although if you hate lines sooo much, than just order ahead). The problem with this line lies in the fact that this place is BYOB. Enter the fundamental problem.... You have what is some of the best brisket and ribs I've ever had, but in a packed small place that needs to turnover tables like it is going out of style... So before you pack up enough beer for a night of BBQ, realize that you have time but for 2-3 max before you too will feel the need to flee the scene. If you can come to terms with this than I think you will be able to enjoy what is some of the most fantastic BBQ and side dishes in the city. I highly recommend the brisket and the Baby Back Ribs. All the sides are pretty good and it just depends on what mood you are in. Thoughts: Get a Half Slab of the Ribs and 2-3 side dishes Bring your favorite beer and enjoy! I want more brisket!

We went to this place last weekend after hearing the great reviews about it. 蔍've got to tell you - 蔍 was not at all impressed. I ordered the 1/2 pulled pork sandwich w/fries. 蔋ad I known the sandwich was going to be so small, I would have ordered the full size. 蔍 couldn't stand the BBQ sauce - thought it was WAY too watery, and not very flavorful either. 蔒y husband ordered the 1/2 pulled pork 1/2 brisket sandwich and said it was dried out. 蔒y son ordered the mac & cheese. 蔠hile the mac & cheese was good, it was not served as I had heard it was - with a crispy breadcrumb topping. 蔍've heard the topping is the best part of the mac & cheese. 蔜he coleslaw was edible at best - nothing spectacular. 蔠hile we were waiting for them to call our number, I overheard what was going on at the counter. 蔜wo people returned to the counter with their trays of food, complaining about one thing or another. 蔄nother man was trying to order the BBQ chicken, but was informed it wasn't ready yet, and was still in the smoker. 蔋ello??? 蔜he place opened at 11:00 AM, and this was just past noon. 蔋ow can any good restaurant not have menu items available when the place opens? 蔕h - and the dining area. It leaves MUCH to be desired. 蔛uper bright sunlight coming in and bouncing off the huge metal ductwork on the ceiling; concrete floors, plain Jane tables. 蔔ot that I would expect Architectural Digest style decor, but this was just pitiful. My husband was born & raised in central Texas, and while I'm a Chicago girl through & through, I lived in Austin, TX for 5 years. 蔄fter living down there and being able to taste REAL BBQ, nothing will ever compare, and Smoque didn't even come close (The Salt Lick it isn't!!!). 蔝nless I'm in that neighborhood and desperate for something to eat, I won't be going back.

hot damn, that is one good ol' brisket! 蔍'm not a huge fan of the location being in the South Loop and all, but the food was well worth the trip! 蔍 feel like its hard to find good bar b q spots in the city and this place definately lived up to it's hype! 蔆lean, minimal, and sort of corporate looking in my opinion but dang good food. 蔍 wish they gave you more of the sides, but thats just the fat kid in me talking.

Smoque is absolutely delicious. From their smokey and savory brisket, 蔯reamy and crusty mac & cheese to the crunchy coleslaw everything there is just great. I fell in love with everything there. There will be a wait to get your food and to sit down. It is a deli style operation. I would suggest you try a little bit of everything, they offer such a platter, but if you are a fan of brisket skip everything else and get that. It is juicy, smoky, tender and the bbq sauce that accompanies it is vinegary, sweet and spicy all at the same time. Delicious! Once you get your food and sit down to devour this amazing food you will thank me for my suggestions.

It was fate that brought me here. I saw the place on the food network just a few days ago. Last night I was talking to my professor about it who highly recommended Smoque. She tried to go there this past weekend but the line out the door was crazy and they ran out of brisket! 蔔ow it was cold last Saturday in Chi-town but she talked about it passionately---it being the brisket. Today I was planning on going to Chinatown for dim sum. It ended up that I didn't feel like going through all the traffic and my own mother suggested to get off the next exit and head towards here. Guess what? That was my highlight for today! I had the sliced beef brisket sandwich, french fries, corn bread, and the cole slaw! Needless to say, I will definitely head back!!!! Just thinking about the whole experience is making my mouth water.

After several visits to Smoque, I've decided that a review needed to be concocted. 蔄m I going to tell you to not believe the hype? 蔜o stop wasting your time waiting in line for an hour to get a big pile of brisket? 蔍'm afraid not. 蔋owever, I do have some fundamental issues to address in terms of Smoque's food, identity, authenticity and ambiance. �Let's get down to brass tacks. 蔍 mean, after several visits, i've tried a large variety of things on the menu. 蔅risket, links, pulled pork, ribs, and coleslaw. 蔍 wouldn't dare say that any of these items are horrendous or poorly prepared. 蔄ctually, the brisket is quite tasty, albeit incredulously rich. 蔜he ribs and links were also pretty tasty. 蔔onetheless, I really have failed to have my mind blown as many reviewers on yelp have. 蔐ike I said, I would consider all of their smoked meats good, but nothing special. 蔄s for the sides, I will say the mac is delicious. �So identity and authenticity? 蔣eah, i've got a major bone to pick (no pun intended) with Smoque's whole business plan. 蔍 don't know about yourself, but Barbecue to me is the embodiment of cultural identities throughout America. 蔍t is localized and unique to each state, town, neighborhood and family. 蔍t is something that tells a story and encapsulates a particular history and identity of many people(s). 蔆all me crazy, but i'm just not getting that sort of atmosphere out of Smoque. 蔜o me, it is a truly Anglicized version of "barbecue." 蔍 mean, I really feel like the place and the food is very much contrived. 蔉rom the perfect little macaroni tins to the campy metal plate that you're served on, this place is on it's way to becoming Famous Dave's and propped up in every strip mall in Schaumberg. 蔍t's not that the food is bad, but it's the homogenizing of barbecue into one spot. 蔇on't get me wrong, you can get Carolina style in Chicago. 蔈xcept that the owner was originally born in South Carolina, they moved to Chicago and brought all of their recipes and traditions with them. 蔣ou see where i'm going? 蔜exas, St. Louis, Chicago, and Carolina styles all under one roof? 蔍t's just not right like it should be. �The atmosphere is also very much contrived. 蔍t's something between a poorly planned lunch room cafeteria and a Chili's. 蔜he wanna-be 'down-home' charm of rickety tables and too-close for comfort rib sucking is lost on me in a sea of table Nazi's demanding where you sit, excruciatingly blaring audibility and an overall frenzied environment. 蔍t always seems like nobody really knows what's going on and it's not uncommon for someone to be moving tables back and forth throughout the restaurant while you're eating. 蔄s well, it's nice that the owner walks around checking on his customers, but I am left to wonder: Is he strolling the restaurant to check on customers or is he just hoping someone still recognizes him from chillin' with TGIF-Friday's-Sling' Guy Fieri from the Food Network? 蔅urn. �What can I say? 蔍'm a bbq purist. 蔠ith that being said, i've had better food, authenticity, atmosphere both here in Chicago and elsewhere throughout this Barbecue-laden country.

Despite the daunting line, Smoque seems to have a system worked out pretty well where you put your order in and once a table is ready, your food is shortly afterwards. For the food, I had the baby back ribs, which weren't as tender as I'm accustomed to, but were very flavorful and delicious with the BBQ sauce. The cornbread was decent, but the mac and cheese...oh the mac and cheese. Absolutely fantastic! I would order extra mac and cheese next time because one little tin of it is not enough! From the crumbled cheese crunchiness on top to the slightly smoked cheesiness inside, this is a must get. I'll be back to get the mac and cheese again...oh and probably try another entree!

I have gone to Smoque since the week it opened and have tried everything on this menu several times (well, except the salad). 蔛moque serves both baby back and St Louis style ribs, but, they are on a mission to convert Chicagoans to St Louis style. 蔍've got to say, they're doing a good job. 蔄lso, I can't say enough good things about the brisket and pulled pork. 蔜he sides are delicious and despite consistently eating too much of the bbq, I always save room for the tiny peach cobbler. 蔜he only bad thing is that sometimes they do run out of menu items-- if that happens, just try something else, it's all great!

It never ceases to amaze me how BBQ is truly the great divider. 蔍 did lunch at smoque with a group of co-workers when it first opened. 蔐ike most BBQ places smoque specializes in southern style comfort dishes in this case memphis and texas. The brisket seemed to be a favorite and one of my coworkers was immediately in love with it. The sides are standard- mac n cheese, cornbread, coleslaw, bbq beans. 蔍 had the chicken entree- which was tender and moist. 蔜he sauce was great ( I'm no bbq purist). 蔜he baked beans were thick and sweet- really baked! 蔄nd the coleslaw was cold and fresh and tangy. �The service is fast and the food is fresh. 蔍 couldn't afford to come here for lunch everyday but it was a nice treat. It's a good meal that will leave you full, comfortable and ready for a nap. 蔄fter the meal I came back to work and made a cup of black tea to stay awake at my desk.

This is easily the best BBQ that I've ever had. 蔜he St. Louis style ribs here will spoil any enjoyment that you ever would have eating ribs elsewhere. 蔜he cole slaw, peach cobbler, and baked bean sides were all perfect. 蔜he mac and cheese side could be improved upon, it ends up having too many of the crumbs from the top on it for my liking. 蔍'm going to start bringing out of towners here to show off how amazing our BBQ is.

We just ordered lunch for 15 folks at my office. I faxed the order over to Smoque and included the names of my co-workers & clients after each of their orders, ie: (1 brisket sandwich w/slaw & peach cobbler - Pattie). When I arrived to pick it up, the food was in 3 big boxes with each order bagged separately & each bag had a name tag attached. It made our life soooo much simpler when distributing the food and made sure that all of the sides were included. We love you Smoque, thanks for the delicious food!

I am on the fence about this place....on one side I love their bbq sauce! Better than anything I've had so far......But on the other I was disappointed by the mac n cheese and by their menu. Its a very simple menu...Ribs, Chicken, Brisket, and some sides/salads. 蔜he cole slaw was fantastic, didn't seem to have any mayo at all. The cornbread was great, but I wasn't fond of their baked beans. Overall it was an OK experience. Prices are good. Location is not so good.

Given any day of the week, you can always count on a good line of patrons at Smoque. 蔛it in it and wait. 蔜rust me, it's worth it. The Chicken and sliced brisket are always a fail safe choice. 蔍n fact, you can't say you've truly had smoque bbq without even trying them. 蔍t is rare to see smoked chicken served so juicy and tender at other bbq joints. 蔛moque has it down to the science. 蔍 can honestly say that I enjoyed the chicken more than the ribs, sausage and both briskets. One shouldn't under estimate the sliced brisket though. 蔜he passion for real smoked barbecue shines with the sliced brisket. 蔍t will basically melt in your mouth. 蔜he sausage is pretty good, as are the ribs. 蔜hey stay to the chicago roots and offer the baby back, as well as the fattier St. Louis style. 蔅oth are great decisions. The side dishes are simply alright. 蔄 little bit small if you ask me. 蔜hey are all served in little tinfoil cups, except for the beans and cole slaw, which are served in the classy styro containers. The beans are made with chunks of chopped brisket and are definitely the best option of the few. 蔉or dessert, Smoque offers a peach cobbler served in the same tinfoil cup. 蔔ot bad, just tossed up there on the menu. Obviously with all the amazing reviews, their barbecue will surely make up for any lack of side dishes

I have been to Smoque three times, and each time I leave there satisfied, full, and knowing that I'll be back. Hopefully soon, very soon. *sniff* -- Pardon me, that was me smelling my shirt to take in one last smell of the delicious smoky BBQ. The St. Louis ribs are some of the best I've had and I'm pretty sure I could drink the BBQ sauce by the gallon. Do not leave here without ordering a peach cobbler. Let me say that again: Do not leave here without ordering a peach cobbler. Enough said. Its unfortunate that this place gets such good reviews and even such favorable media coverage, because even at 5:30pm the line is out the door. The line moves fast and the table seating is usually pretty quick. Do yourself a favor and go here when you're craving some BBQ but not at the same time I'll be going. Getting in the way of me and my meal at Smoque is serious business. Got it?

The chopped brisket is divine. 蔍t has just enough sauce on it, though they do give you an extra side of it. The Mac and Cheese is softer than Ive had in the past, probably because it's twice baked but really good. 蔜hey also have really good sweet tea for you southern fans. 蔍 would like to personally thank the owners of Smoque for opening near Portage Park (where I reside). 蔠e have NO GOOD RESTAURANTS.

I finally ate at Smoque after several tasty take-out orders. It was a Tuesday evening but the line was pretty long, but did not extend out the door. The ribs taste even better on the premises!

Glad the BBQ sauce wasn't too sweet (if you like it tangy) and glad that the meat wasn't inundated in sauce -- they do a 'dry' smoke and happily they provide you with a side of sauce so you can choose how much you want. Doesn't matter what you order here, everything is AMAZING.

This place is pretty good -- it will never unseat Honey One BBQ -- being a fan of Ribs, that place is the best in town -- but as far as pulled pork and side dishes, Smoque BBQ is very good. The restaurant is clean, and it's right off the 90-94 on the NW side of Chicago

Pretty much lives up to the hype. Spare ribs are well-smoked yet still nice and juicy. Best brisket in town bar none. Barbecue chicken is at the top of my wife's list, and she's picky about her chicken. Links are fine ground meat without the fillers found in many versions (which barbecue tradition considers acceptable but Smoque chooses not to go that route anyway). Some of the best fries in town and the rest of the sides are generally delicious. The only knock I can think of is that the side portions other than the fries are small. People complaining about the lack of ambiance apparently don't "get" that bare-bones decor is part of the "barbecue shack" tradition. You're there to eat great food, not look at pretty walls and curtains and crap.

Finally-Brisket I can LOVE. So far, the best brisket I have liked has been home crafted by true BBQ 蔿overs or a couple of joints in Texas, but the brisket here is actually the best I have ever had. Pulled pork was surprisingly sub-par. With all the place had going for it, it was a bit dry and tasted only like sauce (which is tasty) but not the porky goodness that I love. Served on a giant bun of Hawaiian bread that added a nice sweetness but was too fluffy and should have probably been a bit denser. The ribs (the larger St. Louis style) I love were great. Perfectly tender. There is this disgusting love for 'fall off the bone' ribs that makes people boil ribs to cook them then throw them in a smoker or on a grill. Boiled meat, people? What, are we English? no dude, it's gotta be smoked and thiers are amazingly tender but not sodden. really good and served with the Memphis style BBQ sauce. They have 2 sauces - Memphis style: sweet, molasses-y, thick and the South Carolina: thinner and vinegar-y. I usually prefer the tangier S Carolina, but theirs is tangy, but not much smoke or spice - The fell I was with said it was good on whatever he was eating. I found it to be 'meh' I actually really enjoyed the Memphis style - well balanced, smoky and not too sweet. Good texture too; stuck to my meat but not gooey. The baked beans...that was an odd story. My first bite was heaven. They were amazing. But I couldn't take more than 2 or 3 bites at a time before I was bored with them. It's an interesting taste, but they were almost too sock it to me and didn't have much of a 'beany' flavor. 蔛o it was nibble something, take a bite of beans. leave them alone for a while, go back to them, have a couple of bites etc. Weird, huh? mac and cheese had a delicious buttery crumb topping, but otherwise only a bit above mediocre. What most BBQ places do is make a couple of sauces and then douse everything int he sauce: all the meats, the beans, the sausages. Great if you love the sauce! This place had very unique tastes to all the food. The brisket, ribs, pork, beans, all were unique and that is a new thing to me in the BBQ world. Unfortunately some of them missed the mark - but not by enough 蕁ot to come back. 蔜he biggest thing is that everything is a bit too much, except the noble simple coleslaw which is simple and palate cleansing. You already heard it's crazy crowded with a few tiny tables. It's BYOB, but too busy to kick back and enjoy a brew. Eat and run style. Staff is friendly and helpful. Delicious brisket, seriously the best I have ever had, great ribs, and one very good sauce with sides that are passable.

Being a Texan, I'd have to say that Smoque BBQ is one of the best I've places I've ever been to. 蔜he meat was moist and great. 蔍 had the brisket and rib plate with macaroni cheese and beans. 蔄lthough I like to go to Barbeque joints to enjoy their meat and the occasional side dish that will most likely hit or miss, this place got it all right.. actually their sides shot my opinion about this place through the roof. 蔛eriously though, that Mac n cheese was ,, was,, freaking good. I'll be definitely going back when I visit the Windy City again.

I'd give five stars, except that I didn't get to try the baby backs, and that's gotta be my test. 蔅ut everything else we tried--the St. Louis ribs, the sliced brisket, and the pulled pork sandwich--was great. 蔜he barbecue sauces are awesome. 蔅oth have a very zingy vinegar taste, and I love that. 蔜he sides were incredible as well: 蕀ayonnaise-less slaw, baked beans, mac and cheese, and cornbread. 蔔one of it was bad. 蔍n fact, I liked far better than our other Chicago BBQ foray a year or so ago. 蔍 can say without hesitation that we'll go back to Smoque, and I had no idea I liked BBQ this much.

i've had a lot of friends tell me that i have to try this place. specifically, i've had a few rave to me about their chili, because i'm a chili junkie. they went on and on about the brisket chili. so, i decided i'd ride shotgun one day to check it out. first off i have to say that the chili totally underwhelmed me to the point that i thought it was just ok. i had expected so much more from all the raves. that being said, i sampled some of the saint louis style ribs (fantastic), went on to the brisket sandwich (damn good), and had the mac 蔯heese (just about as good as my wife's and that is saying a lot) and fries (tasty) on the side. is it the best bbq i've had in my life? far from it. though, it is a solid joint 蕎ith good bbq. just stay away from the chili and stick to the ribs.

My boyfriend had to try the place before we left. I thought the food was pretty good. I loved the peach cobbler. The meat was pretty good off the ribs. We had two kinds and it came off pretty easy. The tri-tip wasn't that great to me. It needed sauce. I'm not a big BBQ fan, but saw tasted it so at least I've had it. The owner seemed cool. There was a line for food and we decided to get just samples so we could try as much as we could.

This is how barbecue should be. 蔄 great rub, a great sauce, great meat, and great sides. 蔍 think the St. Louis style is their best one. 蔞ery meaty. 蔜hey don't fall off the bone, but to me, they're not supposed to fall off the bone. 蔜hat's a loser in the cookoffs to have the ribs fall off the bone. 蔜he standout sides to me are the fries and the cobbler. 蔍 always get corn bread instead of coleslaw, but I never seem to get to it. 蔍 always find it more important to eat the other stuff. 蔕ne of my friends said they hit the baked beans out of the park, also. 蔜here can be a wait during prime hours, so I either go a little early or a little late.

The wait sucked, the seating sucked. The food was great. I'm not a big bbq fan but this food was delightful. I ordered the brisket that came with a side of mac and cheese and coleslaw, even though I told 蕋he cashier no coleslaw was wanted. Boy i'm glad she gave me some coleslaw because it was great. It was vinegar based and I ate all of it, I usually stray away from coleslaw but it was great. The mac and cheese was some of the best i've had. The portion was small but it was amazing. The brisket was good and I had plenty of leftvovers for the next day.

Great barbecue favorites. People complain about the long lines and cramped seating, that's a sign that this stuff is legit and people want it. The pulled pork is some of the best in the city and the brisket is juicy and tender. Fries are great and you get a lot per order, same with the beans, absolutely delicious. Even the cole slaw is great. It's also cool to BYOB. The owner is usually there making sure things go smoothly as it can get kinda hectic. Nice guy. I'd recommend everything, especially the peach cobbler if you have room. It may be best to order it with your meal because you may have to wait in a long line again. The sauce is a tad watery but great flavor, works well with the fries too. Go here.

Long overdue review!!! Let me start by saying I don't eat very much meat, but when it comes to Smoque.....my mouth waters and I CRAVE it regularly!! My first of several visits to Smoque was sometime last winter, when it was freezing cold and miserable. 蔇elicious, creamy, homemade mac n' cheese, tender sliced brisket, and their absolutely AMAZING peach cobbler is just the kind of comfort food I needed to lift my spirits. �Fast forward five or so months to my graduation from college. 蔠e were planning to have a party at my apartment for 20-30 people, and I decided I wanted to have it catered. 蔛moque was instantly my first choice. 蔍 called, placed an order with their catering lady and everything was set. 蔝ntil..... we arrived 30 minutes before my party began to pick up the food. 蔍 tell someone at the counter that we are there to pick up our order that I had placed with the catering manager, and after running around for a few minutes, he returned only to tell me they had no record of my order! 蔍mmediately, I start going into freak out mode in my head (what am I going to feed all these people!!!), until the owner Barry Sorkin came up to put my mind at ease. 蔋e assured me that he would have the food ready in 15 minutes and that he would personally deliver it to my apartment. 蔈ventually, they did find my order, but for some reason it didn't make it onto their clipboard. 蔋e told me not to worry about paying, that we could take care of it later. �We get back to my apartment, and 15 minutes later, Barry arrives with my order, and kindly included many extras that I did not order, but that helped to make my event run much more smoothly. 蔍n addition to delivering the order for free, he included a $50 gift certificate to return to Smoque, as an apology for losing my order. 蔐astly, they found yet another way to extend their apologies when it came time for me to pay for my order. Amazing!! �There aren't many businesses like Smoque anymore, where customer satisfaction is truly a #1 priority. 蔅arry went above and beyond to correct the mistake and helped make a customer for life! (And many more who had the food at my party and heard just how amazing he was in correcting the mistake!) As far as visiting Smoque just to have dinner or something....be prepared to wait at least 30 minutes! I have never been there when the line wasn't out the door!

After seeing this place featured on Diners, Drive-ins, and Dives, was interested to see what kind of 'que this place served up. The disgusting pigs we are, we went here to check it out after already eating dinner (we were in the area!). The line to order was a mile-long and I almost wanted to leave, but the tantilizing aroma of smokiness clung to me. After a 20minute wait, we went with the sliced brisket and half rack of baby back/half rack of St Louis ribs with fries and beans. It was a tough ride home given how delish everything smelled despite a full stomach. When we finally got back, the food was fantastic. The brisket was awesomely tender and the ribs were soft and juicy. The bbq sauce was also very tasty. I ain't no southern gal but this place done BBQ right. A must try.

Best BBQ in Chicago! We've been eating at this place ever since we saw it on the Food Network show, Diner's Drive-In's and Dives way back when. It really is a "dive" in the sense that you stand in line, order your food, sit pretty close to others and go. It's a step up from a fast food place, but with WAY better food. I'm glad that the wait at this place has gotten better over the years. After it was on TV the line was always out the door, but it's worth it! We usually go for a late lunch/early dinner so that we can avoid the crowd. The BBQ here is just awesome. I've never tried the ribs because the brisket and pulled pork are just SO good. In fact, everything they have is good... Mac n Cheese, Peach Cobbler, beans, fries, even the side of coleslaw that you get with your meal is good. Its coleslaw with a clear dressing, not mayo based and its really refreshing and yummy. The sauce is really good too! YUM! If you are in the mood for a yummy platter of brisket or pulled pork (or even a sandwich) and great sides, look no further than Smoque.

One word: AMAZING! One of the best bbq places I've ever had and I am def. picky about my bbq. Got here on a Sunday night with some friends at like 5pm and the line was already out the door which shows you something about the place. When my hubby asked me what I wanted because you have to order first and then have a seat, I said "everything on the menu" because the place just smelled of pure deliciousness. We had the baby back ribs and the pulled pork as main entrees which were both melt in your mouth yummy. The sides were even more incredible, whether the cole slaw or the amazing corn bread or the mac and cheese. Oh and the best side of all was the peach cobbler, crunch on top and gooey on the bottom. Oh em gee, we will be back for sure. The only negative is that the tables are kinda on top of one another, I would suggest expanding and bring this place to the suburbs!!!

Heard amazing reviews so we tried it out! Lots of options--REALLY good food! Only one weird thing: the bones in the ribs were actually snapping and breaking apart when trying to eat the ribs. It ended up turning the ribs into a sloppy chunky mess because the bones weren't staying intact. Not sure if its because they cook the ribs so long it weakens the bone--but i've never had this happen before and it made it REALLY hard to eat! Not something that would keep me from coming here but it is curious!

i feel slightly guilty only giving three stars because the food was melt-in-your mouth delicious. here are the reasons i cannot give more stars: 1. the secret is out, waiting in a line out the door on a cold day in chicago is not fun (even if the food is worth it). 2. they did not have any pulled chicken (i felt discriminated for not being a true meat lover) 3. parking was up the street and around the corner (which means i had to drive to get there). 4. the food was extremely rich (almost too much to take) i'm not going to lie, my meal was crazy good... i had a quarter chicken with mac+cheese and i was stoked to see that the coleslaw was made with vinegar. the staff was amazingly friendly. the end.

When it comes to me and barbecue, consistency is KEY and Smoque certainly pleases. The lines can be crazy long, but the help orchestrates the situation like culinary maestros and breezes you through the queue ensuring that you'll have a place to sit once your food is up. The brisket is my first love, but the ribs and pulled pork are wonderful as well. You just can't really go wrong, so try a combo plate. The sides (brisket chili, beans, mac and cheese and cornbread) are a perfect accompaniment to the meal. Thanks for showing Chicago how it's done!

I was riding bikes around the northwest side the other day and a man at a bike store recommended Smoque, although I had heard about it before. 蔜he line was out of the door on a Sunday afternoon around 2:30 and stayed that way until we left. 蔇on't be discouraged though, the line moves pretty quickly. 蔜he mean was awesome- 蕇moked all day you could tell. 蔒ac N Cheese side was great and so was the cornbread. 蔜he sweet tea was a lot better than what they try to serve at Wishbone. 蔠hy not 5 stars? They only use the Western North Carolin BBQ sauce for the pulled pork. 蔍 think they should have choices, although I did like the sauce. 蔍 prefer more vinegar based but it was great BBQ and I will go back!

I went here a while ago so maybe things have changed. 蔠e were quite disappointed. 蔜he food had a great taste but the brisket was dry and everything was cold by the time we got it back to our table. 蔍 think the reason may be because the place is very basic in terms of decor w/cement floors, etc. and we went during winter. 蔜he door kept opening and closing and I think the place was a little cold and barbecue doesn't always hold its heat. 蔍 think the trick is that if you go here in winter, to get your food "to go" so that you can heat it up when you get home. 蔠hen we were there, the food did not survive the trip from the counter to our table.

I eat at Smoque every Friday night. 蔕k, not every Friday night but when I'm training for a marathon, I eat there every Friday night. 蔒y fellow runners out there will understand why I stick with this plan, when you find a good thing and it works, stick with it. 蔠ell, I found out 2 years ago that Smoque before a long run works for me! 蔍 absolutely adore that their ribs are dry rubbed and the sauce is served on the side, I'm not a fan of drippy messy ribs. 蔜he fries are incredible as well as the mac and cheese (and both offer some carb loading opportunities.) 蔜hey serve my husband's all time favorite pulled pork sandwich and I happen to love the brisket! 蔣ou don't have to fight for a table either because the wonderful gentlemen there help you out with finding a seat. 蔍 live close by (a 5 minute walk) so I'm lucky that I can get there before the rush and get my fill before it gets too crowded. 蔅ut watch out after Cubs games, the place is crazy busy with Cubs fans. 蔒y husband and I have tried many many other BBQ places and Smoque always wins for us....love the food and love the staff. 蔄nd I love that when we walk in, the guys always ask "how far you running tomorrow?!"

The food was totally AWESOME!!!! We both had the Baby Back Rib entree (1/2 slab) and 2 sides (French fries, baked beans, mac & cheese, and corn bread). All entrees are served with coleslaw. We also had a "taste" of pulled pork and chopped brisket. Don't laugh, but we like to try as much as possible. We did skip the peach cobbler which I regretted later. :) The ribs were extremely tender (came right off the bone) and had just the "right amount of smoke". The rub was so excellent, you didn't need the sauce. Though we did try it. It's not your usually thick tomato type sauce, but very vinegary (very South Carolina). An awesome dipping sauce for your French fries. I would say the same about the pulled pork. The brisket was EXCELLENT. After they put on the rub, they put on an extra coating of black pepper. It puts a deep black coating on the brisket. It was by far the best brisket I've ever had (next to mine of course, ha ha ha). All the sides were fresh and delish and complimented the BBQ just right. I especially liked the mac & cheese, it tasted just like my mom would make and the beans were to "die for". The restaurant is BYOB. It's not a place to sit down and really enjoy a meal. It's pretty much "eat and go" or "take it and go". The place gets kind of crowded, so rotating the tables is a must. There were like 2-3 men working to keep the tables clean and finding you a place to eat.

I just went to Smoque for the first time tonight and I have to say that I look forward to many more yummy returns! 蔍 went with a group of 4 and all of our food was A+. 蔠e were already talking about the next time we visit before we even left the first one! I'm not much of a meat eater .. so you might be asking what I was doing at a BBQ joint. 蔠ell, my dad saw them on the Food Network's Diners, Drive-ins ad Dives. 蔒y family loves BBQ and I live for mac and cheese. 蔛eeing that they had mac and cheese on the menu, I couldn't pass up a trip to try it out. 蔍 also ordered the 1/2 chicken and fresh cut fries. 蔍'm picky about my chicken and theirs was just awesome - very flavorful and cooked just right. 蔄nd the mac and cheese was to die for!! 蔜hey serve it up in small foil cups with a crunchy breadcrumb top. �Yum! 蔍 shared the fries with my group and we all kept reaching for more. 蔈ven though I am not much of a meat eater, my family is and they all loved their dishes (ribs, brisket and all the sides). 蔐ike I said, we started talking about our next visit before leaving our first and we continued to talk about it the whole way home. We went on a Saturday at 6:30. 蔜here was a short line out the door. 蔜he line was full the entire time we were there. 蔕ne of the men that works there said it had been that crazy since 11:30 am! 蔜hey do a good job moving you through the line and they help coordinate seating after you've ordered. 蔄nd if you have any left, they're happy to provide to-go boxes. 蔍f you enjoy a cold one with your BBQ, it's BYOB.

I have definitely had better pulled pork, which is what I ordered. The fries were good, but prices seemed high for basically fast food. I like that it is BYOB, but if you bring a big group, it will probably be hard to get seats. It is also noisy. I'd have to say that this place is average, overall.

Tony was craving for ribs but I didn't want to go all the way to downtown just for Carsons. So I went on yelp and found Smoque BBQ, read the reviews and was sold on coming here. First of all, I can't believe how close this place is to our house! Just 10 mins away. Second of all it's easy to miss this place when you're driving because it's at the corner and there isn't any bold sign illuminating out in front. Third, you will not regret eating here! When you come in, you're suppose to go to the counter, place your order, pay and find a table to sit at and eat. Everything is made to order and they will shout your number out when it's done. I had the pulled pork sandwich with an add on of ribs and their mac and cheese. Tamia had their ribs. Tony had their chopped beef brisket an add on of ribs and a side of peach cobbler. Goodness, my sandwich was just piled high with pulled pork. I took some of my cole slaw and add it on to my sandwich and spread their delicious bbq sauce on the bun. It was wonderful. Pure delicious! Their mac and cheese was perfect! Moist, cheesy and addicting. Tamia was loving her ribs and the bbq sauce so much that she asked her father for his! Tony enjoyed his food. He was very amazed of their peach cobbler that he decided to share it with Tamia and I. Bad news, Tamia and I devoured it without asking him if he wanted a second helping. =) The price is reasonable and the service is awesome. Also, this Tuesday we had order take out from them. We had their sliced beef brisket sandwich, ribs, texas sausage, peach cobbler (and order of 3 of course), and their side of fries. Again, everything was great..actually their sliced beef brisket sandwich is way better than their chopped version. The texas sausage was so good, smokey and peppery. Obviously, Tamia claimed her ribs and a side of peach cobbler. Everything was made right and nothing was soggy not even the fries when we took it home. Ah, now if only they would make bigger portion size of their peach cobbler or at least topped it with a scoop of vanilla icecream. *wishful thinking*

Northside/Southside...the BBQ Difference Tonight I drove from River North all the way to Pulaski and Irving and home to Edgewater to suit a craving for GOOD ribs. 蔍've heard amazing, glorious rave reviews about Smoque and had to give it a try. Over the years it's become apparent to me that there are two kinds of BBQ ribs in Chicago - Southside ribs and Northside ribs. 蔣ou could also say that there are juicy, perfectly smoked, saucy, meaty, succulent, GOOD ribs (Southside) and ribs that make me weep that a pig was slaughtered for nothing (Northside). 蔅ut I keep hanging onto the dream that somewhere on the Northside is some miraculous place that actually knows something about seasoning, smoking and saucing ribs. 蔛o when I hear rave reviews about a BBQ rib restaurant on the Northside, I eventually cross my fingers, dive in and try it out. So tonight I dove into Smoque... ...and into a disappointing, hot mess. 蔍 knew I was in trouble from the beginning when I ordered a half slab and requested the large end. 蔔ot only did the order taker not know what the large end was, but when asked she informed me that customers usually do not specify which end of the slab they want (note taken about the customers). 蔍 was also certain at this point that the fries would not be served nestled beneath the ribs or that 2 pieces of white bread would be found atop my ribs, but that is all forgivable. 蔍 also ordered the pulled pork taste and brisket taste. �Getting home with my bag'o'meat I hoped for the best and prepared for the average. 蔅elow average is what I got. 蔍 don't recall ever seeing such a skinny, scrawny bunch of ribs. 蔜he pig was obviously an anorexic with self image issues. 蔜he chewiness of the meat though was ideal - I don't believe that meat is supposed to 'fall of the bone,' I like something that fights back a bit. 蔜he seasoning was only on the surface, not throughout the meat. 蔜he smoky flavor tho was throughout the meat, and was quite nice. 蔅ut then there was the sauce. 蔍t's cute how the sauce was served on the side as if it may ruin the majesty of the rub that was used. 蔖erhaps the reason is that the sauce was so...bad. 蔍t was definitely better than Open Pit, but not as good as Sweet Baby Ray's, which is available on the shelf at Dominick's. �Still I was certain the brisket would save me. 蔠rong! 蔛ince when is brisket dry? 蔜his is actually the worse brisket I've had. 蔍 gave it to my cat but she wouldn't eat it. 蔋owever, if you like Smoque's brisket, know that the $3 taste portion is a generous amount. 蔜he fries were excellent! 蔍 haven't tried the pulled pork yet, but fear it may end up in the trash to keep the scrawny ribs company. �Sadly, Smoque was just another place in a long disappointing line that proves that Northside restaurateurs should just put away the sauce, turn off the smoker and travel a few miles to the South side to learn something about the food they are mocking with their below par efforts. 蔍f they don't want to go to the South side, then maybe a weekend trip to Jim and Nicks in Birmingham, Dinosaur in New York, Gates in Kansas or the guy with the BBQ grill in the post office parking lot in Waterloo, Iowa may help out. 蔜hese ribs are all different, but they are all good. 蔎ust please, I beg of you...go learn something so I can get good ribs close to home!!! Still there is one meaty reason for Smoque and their ilk to ignore my review and my advice... they have great reviews and tons of customers. 蔜his leads me to acknowledge that there is an entirely different way of preparing BBQ ribs which a whoooooole lot of people love and appreciate...the Northside way. 蔜o everyone who enjoys Smoque and their buddies - enjoy! 蔈at it up! 蔛op it up! 蔐ove it! 蔍 truly envy you in your bliss. 蔠hatever you do, do NOT go to the Southside and eat real BBQ, such as at Lem's on 75th, as you will find yourself in my position...forced to drive 18 miles for enjoyable BBQ ribs. If anyone reading this knows what I'm talking about and knows a Northside place that proves me wrong...PLEASE tell me.

This is probably the best BBQ I've had in the city. The meats are tender, the sauce is great, and the selection is amazing (even sidedishes). The only downside is how little seating there is, but you can just take yours to go. If I didn't live so far away, I would frequent Smoque more often. I would recommend trying their combinations to experience their various meats.

I'm from Dallas, Texas where BBQ reigns supreme so I feel like I'm a pretty good judge of what is considered fine BBQ. This place is the real deal. The Briskett is so succulent- it litterally falls apart on the fork. Even the BBQ Beans are perfect- made with a delcious smoky flavor. I also tried the Texas Sausage and again, was not dissapointed. The only knock against Smoque is the portions aren't as big as I would like. I'm used to eating, getting full and taking some home for later. I was able to finish my entire plate and honestly could've eaten a bit more.

While I didn't eat at the restaurant, I am currently falling into a food coma from horking down Smoque's food via company catering. The mac and cheese was my downfall; I sneaked extra helpings after everyone vacated the conference room. I've traveled through the south extensively, eating from roadside vendors under corrugated steel shacks dishing out the best BBQ ever ... Smoque is the next best thing. The cole slaw has the perfect tangy kick without being too vinegary. Everything was so tasty I just called my husband and switched our date night from a pricey suburban restaurant to Smoque. BYOB and scrumptious BBQ? Smoque BBQ found a direct path to this girl's heart.

Saying that you don't like Smoque is like saying that you don't like Radiohead or The Beatles. It's just lame. These dudes are BBQ scientists, and they've uncovered the secrets of perfect BBQ, and they make it the same way, every time.

What can i say that anybody else has not said? Well just a couple suggestions. Choose take out instead of dining in because that place is tiny and you will be elbow to elbow with everybody. I should have called in my order but the line wasn't that long and it still took 45 min to place an order. This was my 1st bbq restaurant experience and it did not disappoint. Tried brisket for the 1st time in my life and it was yummy, it also had a really good smokey flavor. The mac & cheese was the best i've ever had. Baked beans were good, I just wasn't a fan of the onions in them. My bbq quest has just started!

after menu surfing while doing laundry i finally decided that it was time to try smoque. called up the place and ordered ummm...damn near close to everything on the menu...it all started as a chicken platter with mac n cheese and baked beans on the side then i added a taste of brisket and ribs and i had to have dessert right? so i added on peach cobbler...the price of all that was pretty decent as i think bbq places tend to be on the more expensive side. well, when i went to pick up the order turns out they heard "sausage" instead of "chicken" so I had to wait a little while and they threw in some sausages for the inconvenience. SCORE! i think that if i had ordered the pulled pork you could have branded me a carnivore and just performed a coronary bypass right then. i have to say that the meat was pretty good, except i thought the sausage was a little lacking in flavor...the baked beans were good but a little sweet for my taste. the mac n cheese was good as was the mayo-less coleslaw. the cornbread muffin was rather moist and tasty and the cobbler was decent. overall it was a good meal if i keep in mind that their thing is BBQ and all the other stuff is just bells and whistles. i would def go back though, glad to get this one off the bookmarks!

i was dying for some ribs, my boyfriend & i ordered take out and we got the baby back ribs, mac & cheese, smoked beans, cole slaw, and corn bread. the sauce on the ribs was a little too tangy for me, so i mixed the sauce with a bit of sweet baby ray's.. perfect combo! the mac and cheese was good but a little too much bread crumbs on top for me.. the smoked beans were amazing.. the seasoning, the onion, the sauce.. the cole slaw was refreshing, not like anything i've ever eaten.. could have had a little mayo to balance the vinegar taste. the corn bread could have been a little more tastier, sweeter.. boston market cornbread is unbeatable. all in all, good food.

No ambiance here, but who cares? They treat you great! They make sure you get a table, they come around and ask how your food is, you really get the feeling they want you to enjoy yourself here. And the food....THE FOOD! Oh my gaaaaaaad, the sliced brisket is so tender you can cut it with a plastic fork. The ribs are fantastic, the sides are excellent (especially the smokey beans and mac & cheese) and I have to say it was the best cole slaw I've ever had. It almost tasted like cabbage salad with a vinaigrette. None of that soupy, creamy dressing. All in all this place was a smashing success with me and my dinner partner. We both loved it and plan to go back for the pulled pork and the hot links. I think I'll have to order them in addition to that brisket, though, because I simply must have that again!

The pulled pork is great. So is the sausage. Tender and tasty. The platters win over the sammies, because you get TWO sides instead of one. The sides are great. Mac and cheese and peach cobbler are at the top of the list. You get a ton of fries if you pick that one, so maybe plan to share that side. The cole slaw is really good- sweet and tangy but not creamy. Don't forget to BYOB if that's your thang. And don't forget to come at an off time, before the dinner rush. But even if you find yourself in a crowd - this place is run quite efficiently.

I love BBQ. Loved Smoque. Knew it was a treat when we saw the 20+ folk line out the door. �The service was fast provided the number of guests, the food was fresh and piping hot, the portion generous. We've sampled the pulled pork, brisket, and St. Louis + baby back ribs; and I would rate them best to good in just that order. The pulled pork was heavenly, brisket was tender, ribs smoky and meaty - but beware, they are a little more fatty then most we've tried in Chicago. The sides were nice, mac and cheese was down home style. Good things: nothing was over-salted or dripping with grease. The tables are very closed to each other, so if you are claustrophobic, get a take-out. It's BYOB with no cork fee, so take advantage! I wish we did. The area is pretty safe though appears a little sketchy, which made for great people watching (we sat by the window and were entertained by a scene of 2 cops arguing with 2 very bizarre looking individuals across the street for 15 mins or so). There is also parking on Sat afternoons! We were lucky to get a spot, but do not fear, street parking plentiful. Prices are very, very reasonable. I'd give the place 5 star if the ribs were less fatty and the brisket/pork was less charred (hello, carcinogens ;) But it was yummy. Great occasional treat.

Awesome sides at this place! 蔉antastic cole slaw and probably the best mac & cheese in Chicago. 蔒y only complaint was I wish the sides were bigger! 蔜he meat was just perfect. 蔊reat sauce and the meat itself was nice & moist. 蔜hey also have really great trays to put your food on ! 蔐ove that !

I think just the sheer fact that Smoque has been reviewed over 400 times speaks for it self. 蔣ou don't get this much attention for being bad or even mediocre. I always have my favorite, the Chopped Brisket Sandwich. 蔍 prefer this over the sliced because I feel I get a little more and better distribution of the charred rub....MMMMMMMMMMMM! I am not a big fan of their style of cole slaw...bygones! 蔍 just happen to like my slaw on the creamier side. 蔅UT their decadent and rich Macaroni & Cheese more than makes up for it....OUTSTANDING! On this occasion, my friend and I shared a half rack of the St. Louis Ribs and were not disappointed. 蔍 love my Baby Backs, but there's enough of me to go around. 蔞ery flavorful and tender. 蔄nd don't forget to incorporate the semi-sweet BBQ Sauce. 蔍t is not the same as the vinegar-based brisket BBQ sauce. In reality, their space is functional and simple. 蔔o flash in this place; down to exposed ceiling and no nonsense paper-covered aluminum trays. 蔅ut, it doesn't bother me. 蔜he hypnotic affect of heavenly BBQ aromas perhaps blinds my visual senses. It has gotten a little run down due to such heavy traffic, especially during football season. 蔇uring the football season, I call in my order and run in to pick up, much to the chagrin of the newbies standing outside in line exposed to Chicago winters. The hardworking staff is always friendly and the owners/management are approachable. 蔋eck, their office is the 2-top against the wall under the big chalkboard menu. My only complaint, they are not in walking distance to me! 蔍 can really use the exercise after devouring their fare. 蔆an't wait for a second location. 蔒aybe I'll get lucky....O'Hare area PLEASE!!!

Last weekend we decided to go to Smoque. Great reviews and all the fuss around it we decided to check it out. Well, parking was a little tough and we were greeted by a very long line outside but when we finally got there we decided it was worth the wait. I had the pulled pork and my other half had ribs he usually likes them a little less chewy but overall the experience was very positive. Next time we'll go during the week to avoid the crowds and for weekends there is always take out.

I finally tried this place after hearing about it. 蔍 ordered the pulled pork sandwich with a side of bbq beans and cornbread. 蔜he portions they give is just about right. 蔍 have not had the ribs or beef brisket and maybe I will give then more stars after I taste more items on the menu. 蔍 found the pulled pork to be average and the sauce was just ok. 蔜he best part of my meal was the bbq beans. 蔍 am rating this place solely on the meal I had, and I must say Ive tasted many pulled pork sandwiches better than theirs. This place is ok, but I wouldnt go out of my way just to have it.

Went to Smoque again, and keep waiting for it to suck since it's so popular. It does not suck. My hubby got the full slab, 1/2 St. Louis, 1/2 baby back. I always get the pulled pork. Just really good. Simple, nice and smoky. Good balance on the ribs of not TOO falling off the bone, but a nice chew. I like the fries. Some reviewers have called 'em mushy, I really enjoy them, and there's a hint of black pepper on them. Really yum. It still seems like a better system should have been worked out by now as far as the whole place your order/ some guy writes down if you're dining in/ huge line/ yelling a number thing. And we were asked to move down one table mid-bite to accommodate a larger party, which was fine, but still...weird? They gave us free cobbler which was not necessary, but delicious! I would go to this place all the time if not for the monster line. But a Sunday lunch? Worth the wait.

When people are willing to wait over an hour outside the restaurant for the food, that says a lot! My St. Louis ribs were sooooo good! It was tender, juicy, and exactly what I needed. 蔜he Mac & Cheese was surprisingly yums too! I'm very picky about my mac & cheese, none of that kraft easy mac stuff for me! 蔜his one came with a great crust and very cheesy on the inside. 蔜he pulled pork was super succulent and very flavorful, even without the bbq sauce. 蔜he brisket was almost too tender, I had the hardest time trying to pick up a piece with my fork. 蔜he Brisket Chili was their special side of the day, that was so-so, I'd probably try the beans next time..or just get 2 mac & cheeses! �My only complaint is the false sense of optimism when you walk through the door and order your food. 蔍f you're waiting for a table...prepare to wait another at least another 15 minutes for a table to eat all the yumminess at! p.s. their cold pulled pork/brisket leftovers were almost better than the original. Can't wait to go back and gorge myself senseless again!

Well I first saw this place on DDD, then met the very nice owner Barry at the NRA Show and my wife and I went that night...NOT a let down in ANY way. It is SO hard to find good BBQ outside of my backyard...(I just don't have the money fo rmy own building) His spices are his deal, and I love that. I use Birch Beer in my sauce, he uses Coke, his beans are THE BEST in the business. The ONLY small problem is the size of his dining room, and I think his ribs are a little flat compared to what I like. So trying to review BBQ for me is hard, cause I like mine so much. I won't review any others except a local over rated establishment in Michigan. Barry does it SO right, cobbler is the best surprise and the Mac n Chee is a model all should try to replicate!

My family has been raving about Smoque. Every time they've gone I've been out of town. So recently, on my birthday, I requested that we carry out from Smoque. The chicken is some of the best that I've ever had. The brisket and pulled pork were also very good, as were the slaw, beans and fries sides. What's more, this place is very reasonably priced, I would say about 30% lower in price than comparable fare. So get over there and pound down some bbq!

the quality seems to went down hill.. doesn't have that real smokey taste to it like it used to. the brisket and pull pork is the only things i order from there now since the ribs is either a hit or miss every time i go . the beans and mac and cheese also doesn't taste as great anymore, sometimes the beans is just to watery and the mac and cheese can get too dry.. i will look for a new BBQ place to go now.

AWESOME. 蔜he best BBQ I've ever had, hands down. 蔍'll admit I was frustrated after leaving here empty handed (and stomached) the first two times I tried to eat here, as the line was either too long or they ran out of beef brisket. 蔜o be fair, Smoque had just been featured on the Food Network so there was a lot of built up hype. 蔍 gave it one more shot, and wow was it worth it! 蔍 usually go with the chopped brisket (smoky, moist, and tender, with those great little bits of blackened beef evenly dispersed throughout). 蔜he BBQ sauce (Memphis style I believe) has great flavor and a nice acidic kick from the higher vinegar content. 蔠anna get your hands dirty? 蔊o with the St. Louis ribs. 蔜hey're, moist, tender and meaty. 蔛olid mac & cheese and fresh cut fries. 蔜op that all off with BYOB and you can't go wrong.

I *finally* made it to Smoque after how long? 蔍 will say this - it is the best BBQ that I've had in Chicago, so I will definitely be going back. 蔍'm happy to finally find a place that makes me want to say that. 蔜hree stars just because I have my BBQ favorites, all of which aren't in Chicago, but Smoque will do the trick when I have a hankering. 蔜heir sauce is a little bit more vinegar based that I'd like (I'm a sweet fan), but that didn't stop me from eating as much of my pulled pork sandwich as I could. 蔜he mac and cheese and cornbread (and my friend's fries) were really good as well. 蔠e go there around 6 on a Wednesday, which happened to be perfect timing - we got a table immediately, but by the time we were leaving, the place was really starting to fill up. 蔍s it work an hour+ wait on the weekend, maybe not, but you can call in your order for pick-up!

I'm not going to even bother writing a review - the 500+ reviewers who have already raved about Smoque have said it all. Service was good - the order line moved fast last Saturday around 12:30 pm. Seating was plentiful at that time. I had the brisket and yes it was the best brisket I've ever had. A signature Chicago experience, not to be missed.

This place is super busy at lunch! And this is why... The sliced brisket sandwich was so tender and juicy. Not a huge amount of flavor, but perfectly prepared. The st. Louis style ribs... Wow! Putting sauce on these would be a crying shame! Seriously delicious as is. The sauce is a thin peppery sauce with a light spicy kick, and the rib sauce looks to be a thicker version. Fresh cut fries are always good, and they give you a 40 can sized bag of them. The only thing I didn't love was the slaw. Way too oniony. Alraight Chicago, it looks like you do have a reall BBQ place. Hooray!

I stopped by for the first time on Friday. I tried the St. Louis ribs and the sliced brisket. I thought both were good but I didn't like the sauce on the brisket as much as the one on the ribs. Both needed a little more sweetness, somehow.. I know I must sound crazy to the loyal customers. I thought the fries were delicious but I wasn't into the mac and cheese so much. The cheese was good.. I didn't like the crumbs on top. Even though it wasn't spectacular, it was definitely the best stuff I've had in the city, in regards to BBQ. I returned on Saturday only to find an extremely long line outside the door. For this reason, I walked away. It was snowing, it was cold and I wasn't about to get sick for a sandwich. I hope they can one day accomodate the demand as they were also out of brisket (another reason I didn't wait in line).

Smoque was on my list of places to visit for at least 3 years. I must say the food was excellent. We went in the middle of the afternoon at 3pm on a weekday, thinking that it would not be packed, after a driveby of a packed Kuma's corner not too far away. We tried the ribs, which I wasn't too impressed with. 蔍t had a dry rub with sauce on the side, but I felt like I had better ribs at Famous Dave's and Portillos. 蔔onetheless, it was still good but not memorable. The beef brisket was probably the best brisket I've ever had, very tender, falling apart easily, just enough fat with a sweet sauce on the side. 蔜he brisket is a must have.

In a word, awesome! 蔍 am a firm believer that a BBQ place should be known equally for its meats and its sides, and both I can assure you were wonderful! 蔜he ribs were fall off the bone, the brisket melted in your mouth, all accompanied by a tangy, sweet BBQ sauce. 蔉or sides we tried the mac & cheese, creamy yet with a delightful crunchy bread crumb topping; baked beans, smokey with bits of bacon; french fries, absolutely to die for; and of course cole slaw that helped break up all that grease in my belly. 蔕h, and don't forget the peach cobbler for dessert... almost better than Mom's. 蔄t first I thought that perhaps the mac & cheese side was too small, but after eating everything else it turned out to be just the right size. 蔇efinitely an affordable outing, plus you get enough food to put you in a coma for the rest of the afternoon.

I was out shopping on the 18th in the 1987 Sprint, and I had to go to a grocery store to get a majority of the items. To minimize the possibility of impulse buying, I decided to eat something before then. I was motoring east on Irving Park Rd. and decided to give this venue a shot. The word here is that five barbeque-loving guys decided to pool their resources and open a 'southern-style' B-B-Q restaurant in an under-served neighborhood. I believe most of you already know about my preference to avoid pork, which generally significantly reduces my options at B-B-Q joints. But I was able to order Smoque's chopped brisket sandwich with cole slaw and brisket chili (Wednesday's special side dish) [$8.95]. Soft drinks (Coca-Cola products) are $1.25. I was here at 3:10 pm. There was no queue out the door, and lots of seating choices inside. The brisket was good. It needed the additional B-B-Q sauce (a sweet sauce - provided) to enhance it. I also thought that it seemed to get cold around the edges of the bun. The cole slaw is the vinegar-based kind, which is not my favorite, but it was fresh, and I finished it all anyway. The brisket chili was quite good. It had a meaty flavor, even before I scooped up the shredded beef which had fallen out of my sandwich and tossed that into it. Every day, there is one custom side dish. If this is available when you visit here, you should opt for it. I am giving Smoque a four-star rating because the food is quality, its prices are average, and it successfully conveys the atmosphere of a communal dining room, which is something you infrequently glimpse in metropolitan Chicago. Transit options: This is an intermodal venue. There are many ways to get here. I'll change it up this time by telling you something significant if you decide to drive here. Because Smoque is so close to the Union Pacific Northwest line, the Irving Park Blue Line "L" station, and the Kennedy Expressway; but is in a residential neighborhood; there are parking restrictions on Grace St. [one way westbound], and Keystone Ave. [one way northbound] Smoque's own parking lot is only six spaces. You want to approach Smoque from the northwest; either on Irving Park Rd., or off the Kennedy at Keeler. The avenue you want to wind up on is _Avondale Ave._ It is the diagonal street on the south side of the U.P. railroad tracks. _It is one way southeastbound._ After 8:00 am, there are no parking restrictions on Avondale. Cram your vehicle into any spot you can find. Then, you'll face a one-to-two block walk. Lest you perceive I am making a fuss about this; Smoque's own pamphlet illustrates the parking situation. Lucidly, transit is overwhelmingly available. The route #53 Pulaski bus stops in front of the venue. The Irving Park Blue Line "L" station has an auxiliary exit at Pulaski. (A 1 1/2 block walk.) Route #80 and #X80 Irving Park buses are two blocks north. The terminus of the route #54A North Cicero bus [pm rush hours only] is three blocks northwest. Even the U.P. has a train station here {for you reverse commuters entering the city on the Metra $5.00 Weekend Pass}. But make sure you don't visit here on Monday. (It is closed.)

If you're a fan of simple, no fuss food, and can appreciate pork shoulder or a brisket that has been smoked all day, then this place is DEFINITELY for you. Smoque is a no frills kind of place, and you can tell the moment you walk up (I'd say walk in, but chances of not standing in a line out the door are slim to none). Everything I had there was delicious, including the fries, which I usually try to avoid at places, but standing in line and watching people eat them convinced me otherwise. Smoque is earnest, straightforward Texas BBQ. My only REAL gripe about this place is the wait, but I suppose there is nothing that can be done about it. The product is amazing, and people will wait in line to experience it. I'd like to see outdoor seating maybe? But I guess it would steal from the line space?

We walked into Smoque's around 2pm on a Saturday and it was very crowded. No available seats. A guy asked us how 蕀any and said he would help us find a table. The line moved quickly to place our order. I ordered the pulled pork sandwich. My friend ordered the brisket. We had to stand around awhile aimlessly because there were no available seats. People were sitting around post-meal, which I understand but this is not the type of place to do so because seats are so limited. When I took the first bite of pulled pork sandwich, I was amazed! It was so good. The bread melts in your mouth and the meat is so tender and flavorful. The macaroni was AMAZING. Not a cole slaw fan--wish I would have substituted the macaroni for cole slaw. My date LOVED the brisket as well. He got cornbread which HE LOVED which is to say 蔿ot because his mother is a baker. The beans were wonderful as well. It seems you can do no wrong at Smoque's

Having previously been to Smoque, I decided it was a good choice for my niece. 蔄s a 9-year old, she is an admitted, "ribs snob" so I figured she would like Smoque. 蔜he minute she opened the door and got a whiff of what was cookin' her eyes got huge and she got a big smile on her face. 蔛he loved the baby back ribs but she didn't care for Smoque's BBQ sauce. 蔉or her, it was too spicy (she doesn't care for anything spicy). 蔍 once again ordered the pulled brisket and it was as delicious as always. 蔍've never been a fan of their vinegar-based cole slaw or their macaroni and cheese (kinda bland) but LOVE their french fries. 蔒y niece gave the fries 2 thumbs up as well. 蔍 like the no-frills attitude of Smoque but I have to ding them on not having any ice in the ice machine!

Best far the class of BBQ in Chicago. 蔍 haven't seen anybody else come close to getting the Carolina sauce this delicious. Tips: - Get the brisket sandwich. 蔜here is a reason all the magazines fawn over it. �- Corn bread is pretty spectacular. - Get there right as they open to avoid the line and crowded dining room. - The Texas Sausage has that perfect snap to it. - If you are with somebody else, you might try splitting an order of fries. 蔜hey are abundant. 蔄nd nobody really needs that much sodium.

Yeah, this is the place that was featured on one of Guy Fieri's shows, however, that is not the only reason to try this place out! I flew into ORD and was scooped and schlept to this fantastic place, as it is a great stop on the way back into the city. Super friendly staff, rub vs. a sauce (take it from a Texan, it is solid!) and served i a very stylish and "separate" way! I went with the brisket platter with 2 sides. I look forward to returning on my next trip back to this taste bud tantalizing town!

Sliced Brisket is the only thing I ever order here, there's no reason to mess with perfection. 蔜he beans are amazing! The cole slaw is delicious. 蔍t gets busy but they do a great job of keeping it organized when they seat you. 蔍f it's nice weather the outdoor seating gets you away from the hub bub inside.

I'm now a vegetarian so I will no longer enjoy their absolutely yummylicious pulled pork sandwich.. really go try it because it is soooooooooooooooo good! I need to think of new words for delicious .. anywho their mac and cheese is also good. Expect to wait for a table if you go at night though. They also have good desserts.

I can't believe how many times I have been to Smoque but I haven't yet written a review. 蔔ormally this is the type of place I would write-up. 蔍 think this is the best pulled pork in the city. 蔍t's the best I've had so far. 蔒y favorite order is the pulled pork meal with sides of corn bread and peach cobbler. �The price is as good as the taste. 蔉or the same price, you get more food with this meal than with Smoque's competitors. 蔜he only downside to Smoque is the wait. 蔜he line is almost always to the door. 蔅ecause of this, I call in my order and pick it up. 蔣ou can go to the front of the line to pick up and pay for carry out. 蔍t's much easier that way. 蔍f you want some good pulled pork, Smoque should definitely be on your list.

Rib fan here. Give me a bib and let me work! This place is in my hood and it is quite the find. Off the recommendation of my sister I gave it a shot. Ever seen the episode of Seinfeld with the Soup Nazi? Well this place is nothing like that but you will feel the pressure of the line of people behind you antsy to order, so when it is your turn to order make sure your ready. Great eating experience though I am not a fan of cafeteria style dining so for that I cannot give it a 蕇tar. but let me tell you the food is not to found elsewhere in Chicago. Dry rub smoked bbq is hard to find in the city. It has much more tang and zip than traditional wet ribs and it is not sweet and sticky either. The sides are also great. Beans and fries compliment the smoked pork like butter to toast. Me and wifey have been here numerous times and it has not yet disappointed. Look to the St. Louis cut over the baby back for a healthier slab. Trust the food will not disappoint.

So I've been dying to try this place forever and last night I finally got my wish! I had the sliced brisket sandwich with mac n' cheese.....my friend got the ribs with mac n' cheese & fries. Overall....yummy for my tummy.....but was a little disappointed that the brisket wasn't really juicy....I am a sauce fan and while I don't want the meat to be swimming in it.....I did have to use all of my extra sauce and then steal my friends to use as well....boo :( 蔒ac n' Cheese was awesome creamy and deeee-lish! Fries got the thumbs up as well......I will be back!!

I am not a BBQ connoisseur by any means and in fact I rarely crave it, but Smoque has converted me. 蔜heir brisket and pull pork is so delicious...and usually I don't eat either, but don't shy away from the chicken either. 蔍 ordered the chicken last time and I had to pry it away from my husband. 蔜he rub they use is delish and it's perfectly cooked. 蔜he mac and cheese is to die for, but honestly what I really love is their corn bread. 蔣ou really can't go wrong with a meal here. 蔄 plate can feed you for 2 meals, in fact it has in my case.

at smoque the menu is simple, so its easy to try all the things offered. the baby back ribs and brisket is our usual choice (platters of course), the meat is tender and juicy, but the bbq sauce is super vinegary for my taste. i would prefer if it was sweeter.. 蕋he half chicken looks juicy, the texas sausage is a bit boring compared to the other meats. as for sides: if i had my way the mac and cheese would be 3x as big, because its just that good, the sauce is creamy and the crispy crust.. oh yea. the baked beans are sweet with great chunks of tender pork, the corn bread is a nice side for the meats..cole slaw comes with all the platters, the dressing is light and acidic and has a nice crunch, but i hate the celery seeds (! personal issue). the fries have their moments, some stronger than others.. but i feel a bit too greasy after eating all the meat and fries. peach cobbler is a nice way to finish it all off, but really i just want more mac and cheese :)

I just can't love this place. I've tried. I 蕎as here the first week they opened I wanted to love this place so much. I thought maybe it was due to newness but now it has been long enough that 蔍'm finally certain that Smoque just doesn't do it for me the way Fat Willy's or Honky Tonk BBQ does. To be fair, I've never had the brisket, and from reading reviews maybe that's my problem. The ribs I've had have been just ok and all of the sides I've tried here were nothing to remember. At this point I just don't see myself coming back.

Waited in line, place was packed, order full rack of st. louis and baby back ribs mac n cheese cole slaw, corn bread, pulled pork, and fries. Shared all this with two friends. The bbq was good, but I will begin my review by saying I am more of a wet bbq than dry bbq fan when it comes to ribs meaning I like my ribs covered in bbq sauce while still being cooked. These ribs had an extremely smokey flavor which if you like is good. The dry rub left me so parched that I was chugging water well into the night. Mac n cheese was ok, but wouldn't say it was out of this world. Corn bread was okay but I like my corn bread sweeter. Fries were good but pretty plain. Pulled pork was good but a touch dry. Cole slaw was interesting and vinegar-y. BBQ sauce was good but i like having a choice of different sauces. Smoque is good but I wont wait in line for it again and fight the crowds to get a table. I think there are other better options in Chicago.

Wow, the food here is unbelievable. 蔍f you like Texas beef brisket, you will probably love Smoque BBQ. 蔜he baked beans are insanely good, the cole slaw great as well. 蔙ecently picked up two pounds of brisket, a quart of baked beans, a pint of slaw, and on the way home a loaf of white bread (yeah, good ol' American white bread, the kind that's not good for you, but is a necessity for Texas BBQ!). 蔜he food is so close to what you'd find in Texas, that during dinner I found myself saying 'dang' a lot, and afterwards had this ridiculous urge to go buy a pick-up truck. 蔝h, huh. 蔣'all gonna like this place.

Stopped for a quick lunch and had the sliced brisket sandwich -- very soft and flavorful. I'm no BBQ expert but I prefer mustard-based sauce, which is Smoque's feature. It was busy but the owner came by and asked if everything was ok, which I always appreciate. Only thing I thought was missing was a sausage sandwich (as opposed to platter). Hope to be back soon.

So although I have only had carry out from Smoque, the fact that ever since that day I have been daydreaming about the beef brisket renders it possible for me to give them a 5. 蔈ven the side dishes were phenomenal. 蔠e had some left overs and I tried my best to wait until lunch the next day to eat them, but i only made it to 10:30 A.M. 蔜he bbq sauce was no over powering and had a sweet vinegar taste, without tasting like sloppy joe (how bbq brisket often tastes). 蔍 can't wait to go back!!!

any place that offers peach cobbler as a free side is way ahead of the game. and if that cobbler is better than any i've had elsewhere, with a crunchy topping and just right, not too sweet peach filled center, well, that's five stars right there. it's just so good. luckily, the bbq was really fine as well. the sauce isn't the typical sweet molasses variety, but a blend of sweet and vinegary tanginess that is a welcome departure from my usual. the chicken had a nice spicy rub on the skin which added to the overall flavor. cole slaw here isn't held together with a mess of mayonnaise, and its fresher crunch of cabbage w/a touch of red onion offset the bbq nicely. the fries were how i like em, not too thick, well browned and crunchy. the rest of the group had the meat offerings of brisket and ribs and pork, and while i'm not a red meat eater, i had to take it on faith and their slurping and accolades that the meat is delish as well. oh, and everyone from the cashier to the busboys wore smiles.

I've been wanting to check out this BBQ joint for awhile and finally went last week. 蔅eing a backyard BBQ smoker and former Texan I had doubts whether they could pull-off similar luscious brisket compared to Rudy's of Austin. 蔍 was pleasantly surprised by the friendly and expedient service. 蔍 ordered the brisket sandwich with a side of mac-n-cheese and absolutely loved the combination of flavors and smoke. 蔜he brisket I ordered sliced and it came tender and juicy with a tangy side of their house BBQ sauce. 蔜he crusted mac-n-cheese was also delicious and I could have definitely used more. 蔛moque is by far the best BBQ place I've been to in the city of Chicago. 蔍 can't wait to go back and try the ribs and pulled pork. 蔍 also noticed they now have hot links which are imported from Rudy's in Texas. 蔠oo Hoo those are tasty spicy sausages!

We like Smoque better as a take out joint then eat in. The place always feels a little...sticky. But the food is good, filling, and the price is right. The brisket just falls apart in your mouth. I always get the sliced brisket sandwich these days. I like their slaw, but my husband hates it. 蔍t is too vinegary for his tastes. To be honest, the BBQ is just a bit too vinegary for my tastes (thus 4 stars instead of 5), but it is still pretty awesome.

Look the BBQ is pretty average but 蔮etter than most if you are in Chicago. 蔔obody here seems capable of good sauce or smoky meat texture. 蔜his was pretty decent but a little fatty in most cuts, brisket should not be so moist, its like a sponge but tastes ok. 蔜he sauce is woefully lacking with the sweetness of candy. 蔅ut on the plus side the fries are 蕆eally really good. 蔅ut above all the Peach cobbler IS THE TRUTH, 蔵t is insanely good, crunchy with a good glaze on the outside with perfect solid peach baked in to perfection. 蔍 would pay 12 bucks for that thing, 2 dollars is the deal of the century. 蔍 cannot overstate how amazing it is.The staff is also very friendly and the restaurant itself is very comfortable.

How do you get to be thought of as being the best around here? 1) Get a good publicist 2) Buy a top of the line rotisserie smoker 3) Differentiate yourself with very limited mix of regional sauces and BBQ. Hey man, what about the rub man? Well, every credible place by osmosis has some kind of rub. People that BBQ put a lot of love into what they do and I'll say it, pretty much use the same stuff. Going out on a loin, I've never had a dry rub that I didn't like. It really comes down to preference, sweet, hot, salty, mild or some kind of combination. What is your quest or shall I say, Smoque's quest for a distinct rub? Salt-n-Pepa, that wouldn't be interesting enough to market. They are heavy on the pepper and must be laying down more than a ten spot of ingredients. Beyond the Dr., the additional flavors are subtle and become indistinguishable even for the light FM dippity doer. They could reduce the amount of ingredients by half and the majority wouldn't taste the difference and please, don't give me that intentional blending of flavors between the rub and a sauce. Depending on the thickness of the meat, either the pepper or the smoke dominates over the subtleties in seeking the Holy Grail, I mean Smoque's interpretation of the perfect rub. Btw, was that an African or European swallow? The Seuss on sauces, I could find at least a dozen either vinegar, molasses or tomato based bottles in the grocery condiment aisle that you'd be going lady gaga over. They offer two, neither has a real kicker that will score a goal unless you're buying off the yelp ref. Interesting, making such a big deal about the Texas style brisket without any traditional sauce. It is closer to being pastrami than having anything to do with Texas. Remind you, this is an extremely subjective area, others will praise the sauces like some fricken fine bottle of wine. They will elaborate on how extraordinary the ordinary is. Oh, I'm sorry, one from each region, how intercontinental insensitive Sam I am. Anyway, I've labeled them thick and thin as opposed to the formally known as Thing 1 and Thing 2. The thicker adds upon the already peppery rub with its own peppy glow while the thinner doesn't stray far, however mildly masked, from tasting just like vinegar. Ironic, the thicker is hiding the vinegar with pepper and then you taste more vinegar than molasses for the thinner. 蔠ill the real vinegar sauce please stand up? Yep, heavy on the vinegar is more of an acquired taste in this region unless for the few of you that grew up on Russell's and some, not all, will be enlightened on how well it compliments select BBQ. Certainly no HFCS in these babies, good thing since your cholesterol is already shooting off the charts and you wouldn't want to add anything else that is negative. So, you really enjoy going back to places where practically everything on the menu is well over 20% in fat, 50% plus in fanny pack calories. Thumbs up, dirty sticky finger nails and all. Certainly not a fancy highfalutin steak place that has ribs, only possibly pretentious staff and owners behind the counter placing your POS on scrap yard friendly cafeteria trays. Anyway, you can at least sit down wearing your filthy grubs instead of rushing home or gobbling it up in the car. The prices are on par with the take out places, the supposed standard when getting sincere Q. Northsider, well maybe there's one in Evanston that's barely worth avoiding the southern comfort road trip. Don't be suckered into the allure of the take out being more authentic, unless you are more into the soulful Zen of white bread and fries soaking in the sauce routine. Instead of wasting your time and depleting your gas tank, take a load off and taste a couple of Popeye sized sides with your smoked protein. BYOB, maybe you might prefer that 40 oz. bottle without the brown paper bag you've grown accustomed to. I can't object to anything that they serve. Yet, nothing that I've eaten at this place has ever wowed me. A little something of this or that in the rub or sauce is not going to give me a woody. The meat and the right amount of fat from that meat put into the smoker makes it all happen, everything else is just icing on the cake. I'd tell you straight out if the BBQ is off or bad, not here. Give a lot and I mean a lot of credit to the commercial smoker, the real secret in providing practically effortless and consistent smoked flavor that is not dried out. Imagine the possibilities if every Jewel or Dominick's had a Southern Pride. Alright, the ribs are a tad on the skinny side and I can live without their sauce. As for the pulled stuff, it demands whatever sauce that is laying around to add flavor, contrast and moisture. Brisket, bring on the heat. A hodgepodge crossbreed of this and that for such a small menu, don't get me started. W-H-A-T, a mishpocha proprietor dishing out some top notch goyish BBQ. I was wondering why they had such an affinity with the brisket.

This weekend I was fortunate enough to experience the greatness that is Smoque. Prior to going, I had heard nothing, but positive feedback about this BBQ joint. Obviously, stakes were placed pretty high and in the end Smoque did deliver. I was absolutely blown away by how great this food tastes. While eating there I found myself in a trance and before I knew it my 1/2 pulled pork 1/2 chopped brisket sandwich with side 蕂f coleslaw and beans was consumed. Long story short, if you are a BBQ lover it's essential you check this place out.

FINALLY...I made it to Smoque. I've been trying to get here for months! Well folks, it was worth the wait and I've got the heartburn to prove it. Now, being my first visit, I only tried a couple things. I ordered the 1/2 and 1/2 sandwich with pulled pork and sliced brisket (in case you're wondering, it's a whole sandwich bun sliced in half; each half contains your choice of meat). I chose the fries as my side item and, might I add, they were some of the best hand-cut fries I've eaten. And no, I'm not exaggerating. The pulled pork ROCKED! It was very lean and flavorful and had a nice crust. The brisket was really good, but just a tad fatty for my taste. Sauce was tangy and a bit on the thin side (not a criticism, just a fact). I happen to love the 'slaw here. It's not the traditional creamy version, but has more of a vinaigrette dressing. I'm already planning my next visit, once this awful heartburn subsides...it's not because of the food being too something...except fricken' delicious which caused me to scarf it down way too fast thereby producing this painful side effect. Chew slowly please, if you can :)

OMG, killer mac and cheese, killer pulled pork...totally worth the wait, though if you call ahead for carry-out, you can bypass the line. 蔍f you actually want to eat in the restaurant, it can be kind of a pain, but if you plan ahead it's manageable. 蔅efore I went there, I figured it can't be *that* great if every likes it so much, but it really was, and the authentic smokey (or shall I say smoquey) bbq flavor is tough to beat. �Plus, their sauce is completely amazing. 蔇efinitely check it out!

This place is O.K. The ribs sure taste great, but the sauce is a little too acid for me. It's good, but not up to my expectations.

WHAT HAPPENED ??!!! you know.. I think when Time Out Chicago had one of Smoques Mouth Watering Briskett Sandwhiches on their front page, maybe then Smoque was pulling out all of the stops.. after they got the exposure, they have gone down hill. Now I'm from KC.. the BBQ Place and although I didn't expect it to be Gates or some other place, I wanted this to be decent. The beef sandwhich was OK but everytime i took a bite, there was a huge clump of soggy FAT on it. Like they 蔲orgot to Trim the FAT before they began to cook the meat. I know that they can't reach all of it but DAYUM!!! .. Their beans were just ok. and their fries were just ok as well. nothing to scream about and certainly not worth me paying $24 for 2 kids meals and an adult meal.. ohh and what GALLS do they have making sure that there is a TIP Jar by the Cashier.. WHAT are we Tipping for again ?

This is the best BBQ shop in Chicago. The pulled pork sandwich is perfectly delicious. The sauce is so good I get a quart to take home every time I go. The mac and cheese and cornbread are amazing additions to an already incredible sandwich. The sliced brisket is also a standard at this eatery; you must at least try it. When you go always be sure to "add a taste" of whatever you didn't order as your main meal--you won't be sorry!

Quite possibly the best restaurant in the USA. I guess for meat lovers like myself, anyway. Yes they will get your order wrong 90% of the time and yes bc they were on tv a while ago the line still snakes out the door, but it is so worth it, my friend. Try the brisket. Dreams, fantasies, voyages, treks were made based on this brisket.

Very good BBQ. This place is very good. They have two kinds of ribs. Everything is probably terrible for you which makes it all the better. It's very busy but the time I went we where able to get a seat right away. They won't let you sit down until you order so it keeps people from hogging all the tables and is first come first serve. It's not too expensive and everything I had I liked. Great place.

This place is really good. The meat is very high quality, the sides are excellent, the service was really friendly as well. As far as sides and overall quality, I would say its the best BBQ I've had in Chicago. My one major complaint was the sauce. I wasn't a huge fan, I would have liked to see a couple of varieties, maybe a spicier version.

This place is great! 蔍 heard about it on the food channel and had to go check it out for myself. 蔜he people working are extremely friendly and the owner was even walking around making sure everyone was doing good. 蔍 like the fact that they seat you, so you're not fighting for a table because the place is on the small side. 蔍t's definitely not a place to chill and hang out, you pretty much order, sit, eat and done, but it's so worth it! 蔍 had the half of a pulled pork sandwich (perfect size if you don't have a huge appetite), a bag of fries (fresh cut - huge portion and great seasoning), and the cornbread (substituted instead of coleslaw - also cooked to perfection). 蔍 was with several other people who had the brisket, ribs and chicken, and there were no complaints.

Finally got to try the fantastic Smoque and it did not disappoint. 蔍 tried the beef brisket and the Texas sausage and they were both great - not overpowering, just pleasant and tasty. 蔄nd the sides, oh man, the sides. 蔜he mac and cheese is excellent - next to Kuma's and Handlebar on my favorites list. 蔜he peach cobbler, slaw and corn muffins are also wonderful. 蔍 doubt you can really get anything bad on the menu. 蔠hat's funny is that this place is actually kind of high-end, but it is modeled after more earthy and grubby places with the trays and paper place mats (no plates) and tins of sides. 蔜he only problem is, like most above-average spots, this place gets really busy after 4pm most of the time, especially on the weekends. 蔍'd recommend going at off times if you can.

For what they are, I give them mad props. It's pretty good Memphis style que and gets better each time I go. I've not had the ribs yet, as I always go for the brisket (chopped more so than the sliced). The sauce is awesome, but it's all about the meat. Perfectly slow-and-lowed to melt in your mouth satisfaction. Which isn't easy. Especially with a sinewy brisket. The BYOB factor is key as well, that way you can have a couple beers while waiting in the super friendly line. Very nice. And don't go in a big group or you'll never get seated.

Best BBQ in Chicago. Not even a question. LIGHT YEARS ahead of the competition. Pulled pork is insanely good. So is the beef brisket. Even the cole slaw is good and I usually hate cole slaw. Theirs is not creamy cole slaw, it's more of a fresh/vinaigrette type slaw and it is delicious. The cornbread is good too, and it's BYOB. There is almost always a line out the door, but it's well worth the wait. Closed on Mondays.

traveling through the midwest and south, i've had a lot of BBQ, but had just about given up finding anything decent in the city. until smoque. TO. DIE. FOR. every single one of their meats was tender, juicy and with their specially-developed sauces, absolutely delicious. the brisket is my personal fave, but i'd slog through the coldest, most blustery chicago winter night for their ribs or pulled pork too. don't miss the mac & cheese or the peach cobbler. my only complaint is you gotta get there early to make sure they don't run out!

The place can't be beat for BBQ in Chicago. Most of the bad reviews seem to come from people who thought it was some nicer sit-down restaurant or people who base it off of their personal idiosyncratic tastes. The brisket is amazing, with the pulled pork not too far behind. The real gem is the Peach Cobbler, I'd eat it every day if I lived nearby.

I'd been wanting to try this place for a LOOONG time. 蔍 don't know if my expectations were too high or what, but this was a very disappointing meal. I had 蕋he sliced brisket platter with black beans, mac & cheese, and fries. 蔜he black beans were OK. 蔍 found the mac & cheese to be fairly ordinary (didn't like the crumb topping, though). 蔜he fries were good, but I can get better fries at Susie's about a mile away. 蔆ole slaw was underdressed, which I liked. 蔆ornbread was forgettable. But I came here for the brisket. 蔠hen I sat down, I was pissed that I forgot a knife. 蔜urned out I didn't need one. 蔜he brisket was cooked to the point where it was almost disintegrating. 蔍 doubt if it was sliced to order; if it was, whoever cut it has great knife skills. 蔜he slices were barely holding together. 蔍 was expecting great, and I got mediocre. 蔍'm no longer interested in trying out more of the menu. I'd return if I were with others who wanted to go, but I wouldn't suggest this as an option myself. 蔄 massive disappointment.

Quite possibly the best bbq I've ever had, this far north of Georgia. GREAT delivery on all of the food. The beans are incredible. The sliced brisket is mouth watering. The ribs are so tender, you'll think the bones were stirred in for good measure. The place gets PACKED and the neighbors seem to hate the place but go! Park on Pulaski and be mindful of the parking signs. Bring beer, an IPA would go well. Go, be hungry, let the chef pick for you but DO get cornbread and extra sauce.

The meat is still a bit bland. 蔍t could do with having a more pronounced smoky taste. 蔜he smoky taste is there -- I can make it out -- but it's too subtle. 蔒ight it be that the choice of wood isn't producing a terribly pronounced smoky taste? The owner/manager and staff continue to impress.

You all should be jealous, I work a block away from Smoque and get to smell the wonderful aroma as it drifts through the neighborhood. 蔔ow, I am not a bbq expert, but this food is consistently top notch. 蔜he fact that there are lines is a testament to the fact that the Exec. Chef. knows what he is doing. 蔄dd to that on many occasions he is walking around the dining room chatting with the customers. �As for those lines, I am not sure what these people do but they have a system that works. 蔜he lines move fast and they are excellent at getting you seated right as your food is ready. �The food is simply amazing. 蔍 have had just about everything on the menu and it always tastes amazing and fresh! 蔍t is no surprise that this place has gained national acclaim considering the quality of the food. 蔜he pulled pork is delish as well as the ribs and brisket. �Do yourself a favor, head to this out of the way establishment, wait in line, and then have a food-gasm as you enjoy your meal!

I have been to Smoque a number of times, and have always enjoyed the food. I think the Brisket is great. 蔙eally the only place in Chicago that comes close to the brisket I would get when I travelled to Texas for work. 蔍 also like the fact they have St. Louis style ribs. 蔕ne thing of note is the cole slaw.

I've been here a few times and have never been disappointed. I am a huge fan of their brisket. Don't leave without trying the cobbler. Normally, I am not fond of coleslaw, but theirs has changed my opinion with it's balance of crispness, light dressing and tanginess. The portions are perfect enough to leave full, but not having to take anything home.

Man-O-Man this place has good BBQ. When you go, please do me a favor and get the "taste" portion of as much as you can (its perfectly legal to get brisket, ribs, and pulled pork all on one plate), with the cornbread. Now, do YOURSELF a favor and drink water! the BYOB is nice if you're there to drink, but beer fills me up too much and i couldnt finish all my food. This Place is real cheap- you can get alot more food here so the bang for your buck is fantastic. My only cons: Virtually NO seating and NO decor. the place is made of stacked concrete bricks. Seriously, it looks like (from the outside AND inside) a bathroom you would find at the 9-hole turn of a public golf course that they spray down with a hose. Maybe its on purpose... but the place would make a 蔏ILLING with some investment in nice real estate closer to the city and some decor, or at least a mural on the wall.

These folks are the best BBQ in Chicago, no question! The food is simply awesome every time I've eaten here. The seating is more German house style where tables are set right next to each other. This makes it so you make new friends. I always overhear newbies talking about their food, then I butt in to open the conversation. The owners are almost always on site and will make the rounds to see how folks are enjoying their food. If there is a line out the door, be patient and wait it out, it's totally worth it. Also, for parking on the weekends, check out the wooden gated area just behind smoque, there is almost always a spot or two. BYOB.

Let me begin my review by lambasting that fat ass Food Network host Guy Fieri. 蔜hat guy sucks (seriously, who gives their own show a nickname?), and his show is disgusting, I hope its short lived. 蔠ith that said, kudos for Smoque being highlighted on "Triple D" (....and now I hate myself for just using that nickname). To date, I have not had anything but great experiences at Smoque. 蔜he brisket is excellent, as is the pulled pork, and they don't put up a stink or charge you extra if you ask for extra sauce. 蔛ides are equally excellent, the beans are hearty, the fries crispy, and the coleslaw is defiantly simple, almost to the point of being an afterthought (although that doesn't mean it isn't tasty). �I find it remarkable that the service doesn't collapse during the dinner rush, if I had to guess I would attribute that composure to the leadership of the owner who you will typically find standing guard sporting some nifty Zuba-esque chef pants, and ushering patrons to tables. 蔜he small dining room, BYOB, and counter service seems to be a disaster waiting to happen, but even with the line out the door, we have typically been seated at a table with our food within 15 minutes of arrival. Now that is now you do BBQ, Chicago!

In addition to all the great points made in the other 5000 reviews of this place, I want to make this one: The CHICKEN is phenomenal. 蔛o, if you're looking at the menu and want something ever-so-slightly healthier than the pulled pork, brisket, or ribs, then you can order the chicken with confidence. 蔵t was probably the most flavorful, delicious chicken I've had. �the salad - not so great. �I also had the pulled pork, St. Louis Ribs, and beans - all awesome.

Sheesh. This place has gotten to the point where you can't get their food anymore. The smoked stuff is ready or it isn't, right? They smoke it for 14 hours, or whatever, so they are not making it to order, so to speak. Nevertheless, two Saturdays in a row we tried to place a take-out order. The first was at 6:30 and they were not accepting orders anymore. The second was at 5:00 and they said it would be one hour forty minutes for PICK UP! Look, the food is fine, but this is silly. It just isn't that good. We have substituted a different place and have been thrilled so far (Smokey's on Northwest Highway).

Serves one of the best pulled pork sandwiches I've ever had north of the Mason-Dixon line. A visit to Mississippi back in 2006 introduced me to the heavenly pleasures of Memphis' Leonard's Pit Barbecue and Clarksdale's Abe's Barbecue. I lamented that while Chicago offers plenty of fantastic BBQ (Honey One BBQ, for instance), I'd probably never get a good southern BBQ place in my immediate area. Hooray for Smoque! Besides the fantabulous pulled pork sandwich, the sides are filling and fulfilling. Get the beans and mac and cheese, and end with the cobbler. One tip: order ahead to avoid the long lines on the weekend. Eating at the actual restaurant is fine, but bringing it all back home to enjoy at your peaceful leisure is better.

Wow!! Sliced beef brisket is to die for and the BBQ chicken is also outstanding. I highly reccomend the baked beans and cornbread for your side choices. Also if u have Any room for desert the peach cobler is a must. But again the the beef brisket and chicken are great and the cool thing is if your torn between the two you can order the chicken and add a (taste) of brisket which is a nice size portion or any other menu item on the side for a decent price. I've been there three times and never been dissapointed so I'd say there very consistent and if I didn't live almost 20 miles away I'd probably be there every weeken. If ur tryin to decide if it will be worth the trip if ur far away trust me it is.

We don't love BBQ in our house, but when we're in the mood, this is the only place we'll go. The place is a bit disorganized, but it contributes to the very casual atmosphere.

I have to say thank you to my friend Eric for introducing us to this place. You really can't go wrong with anything here. The brisket is my favorite, so tender and juicy and with the sauce just pushes it over the top. Thanks to the owner Al too. He was so cool and gave our friend a free shirt cause he's moving to Baltimore. The sides are ssooo good too. I'm not a big fan of beans, mac n' cheese, fries, or cole slaw, but there I will have one of each thank you.

Like many, we saw this on Food TV and decided that we had to come. 蔄s a disclaimer, my husband and my extended family are from the south, so North Carolina-style (vinegar-based) BBQ and slaw without a lot of mayo - which is mostly what Smoque serves - is right up our alley. Food was great - loved the brisket and pulled pork as well as the sides we ordered from the regular menu (beans, slaw and mac & cheese, which came out in its own little dish rather than just a scoop from a big pan of it), but the special side of brisket chili just didn't do anything for me. Service was friendly and as fast as could be for the line that was there at 2 on a Sat afternoon. 蔍 like that they request you order before snatching a table since it helps make sure the flow of tables works. 蔄lso, we overheard one of the workers advising someone on the phone to call ahead if coming late at night to make sure they still have what you want. 蔏eep in mind, brisket and pulled pork take a long time to make (as in overnight), so its not just something that they can whip up more of.

I'm from the South, and Smoque is as good as anywhere I've eaten, from trendy restaurant to BBQ shack on the road to the MS Delta. True, Smoque lacks the atmosphere of a Yazoo juke joint, but who cares??? Also, you ribs and brisket afficionados, don't miss the chicken - I finally ordered the chicken after several brisket and ribs only visits, and realized what I'd been missing - makes you lick yo fingas! I've stood in line in the snow, twice, to get into Smoque, and I would do it again and again.

The sliced brisket is tender and flavorfull, as are the ribs. 蔍f you go later at night they may be out of some items as they employee the "make it and sell it until we run out then go home" BBQ model. 蔅YOB is a huge plus and offsets the price as well.

Why 5 stars? 蔅ecause Smoque has the best BBQ ever? 蔔O! Let's set the record straight, Smoque is not the best BBQ restaurant ever! If you search really hard (and are willing to leave the Midwest) you will find better BBQ. 蔕r, if you have a little skill and a Weber Smokey Mountain you can probably make better ribs and pulled pork yourself. Smoque gets 5 stars because it is the best BBQ restaurant in Chicago. �I promise that you will not find a better BBQ joint in Chicago. Parking in the neighborhood is tough, the lines are long, and you will have to share a table with strangers, but Smoque is definitely worth it.

oh hell yes finally, some delicious fucking cornbread in this city... went here with the lady...we split a few types of pig and some sides...everything was solid... brisket...awesome...tender, dry rub was tasty, and not covered in sauce which i don't like...they give you that shit on the side, and even though it's quite tasty (memphis stlye, lots of vinegar), i don't need my perfectly cooked swine to take a bbq shower... st louis ribs...very meaty and again, the dry rub they use is excellent...perfectly cooked, and the meat fell of the bone... sides...i'm a big sides person...you can't call it a perfect bbq without good sides, so the same best hold true for a bbq joint...and the sides here didn't disappoint...mac and cheese, delicious...baked in a tin with bread crumbs on top...simple, elegant, yum...baked beans, a little sweet but still good...and i already sang the praises of the cornbread...hand cut fries were also good... best bbq in chicago i've had...although gale st ribs are still the perfect ribs and will never be topped...

This is a neighborhood gem. Best pulled pork and tender beef brisket. The mac and cheese, I wish the little round cup it comes in was bigger as it's deliciously cheesy. The platter is the best choice since you get beans, slaw, mac 'n cheese and choice of meat and very full by the time you're done.

Very good BBQ, very good service, great ownership, could use an expansion in restaurant size. Only reason I did not give 5 stars is probably just the size of the place, so SMOQUE really deserves 4.5 stars. I have had pretty much everything off the menu at this point and my favorite so far is the chopped brisket. As for a side, don't miss the Mac'n'Cheese, amazing.

Well I finally went to see what all the hype was and just like I expected, it was hype. The food is very good here for sure, I wasn't disappointed at all with anything they serve, but to claim to be the best is such an exaggeration. The ribs were not as "smoked" as could be,it tasted burnt and there was minimal meat on my slab. Without that sauce not much to mouth water on. I read reviews on all the amazing sides that come with the ribs but isn't it about the ribs? Chicago sucks when it comes to ribs so when a place pops up claiming best ribs everyone flocks there like wolves. Look around and see that other places do taste better, try moving to a southern state.

Okay. Not a big fan of BBQ but a buddy of mine is. He was raving about this joint and we finally went a couple weeks ago. This place is a bit of a hike from the downtown northside area but worth it. I recommend driving there. Public transportation will take you forever. The place itself is not very big and there was already a line out the door at 6pm but the line does move pretty quick. I do like you order and pay first at the counter then they seat you. It is not fast food style but not a traditional sit down where they come to your table and take your order. I think this turns the tables over faster. I got the half and half which is a half pulled pork and half brisket. The brisket you have a choice of chopped or sliced. I wish I would have gotten the whole sandwich chopped brisket because it was really good. The pulled pork was good too but not as impressive as the brisket. I also go the recommended BBQ baked beans and they were really good. The slaw was good too. Next time I think I will get the platter which is not a sandwich so I can make room for the peach cobbler or corn bread. Reasonably priced too. Will definitely go again. Oh this place is BYOB so in case you want to bring your own beer or wine.

First time visiting. Between the 3 of us we tried ribs, brisket sandwich, and most of the sides. We all enjoyed each part of the meal. Brisket was amazing. Ribs were unreal. Very very crowded but we all agreed to return ( and that includes our 4 yr old who is definitely a ribs kinda girl). I believe it's byob and parking is limited.

ive been here at least 20-30 times since ive known this place. in terms of food, meat, sauce and sides are 90% of the time consistent, and i would say its pretty darn good if you dont mind burnt food. sauce is just amazing (both vinegary and tomatoey), ribs are not fall of the bone type, but it has this wonderful texture you will enjoy as meat eater. service is pretty good as they have a lot of staff roaming around to assist you and take orders. it gets really crowded dinner time on the weekends, so recommend take out if you want some good bbq food. overall, food is one of the best bbq ive had, service/dining experience is below average.

The best BBQ I've had north of the Mason-Dixon line. 蔖eriod. 蔄nd quite a bit better than much if it south. 蔕thers have complained about them running out of food, which has disappointed us once or twice, but that also is an indication of HOW they cook their meat, "low and slow." 蔣ou can't produce good BBQ fast. 蔍 crave the sliced brisket - literally melt-in-your-mouth - 蕎hile my husband goes for the pulled pork (my sandwich choice if I am in the neighborhood at lunchtime). 蔜his may not count as health food for the body, but it sure is health food for the soul.

Finally got a chance to try this place. I ordered the half-baby back ribs, the pulled pork and a sampling of the sliced brisket. Thought the ribs were ok. I don't like my ribs charred nearly black at the top, so it wasn't for me. The two sauces were excellent though. Loved the thinner, more vinegary-one, though the thicker one was excellent, too. Pulled pork - FUHMAZING. Loved that. Still tasted great the following day as leftovers. Threw it on some toast and wah-lah! Breakfast, so good! The brisket I wasn't impressed with, but I've never tried it before, so maybe that's the best it can be? I thought it was dry with strips of redeeming fat on its sides to moisten and flavor it up. Coleslaw - so fresh, nice and tangy and just perfect with all that pork grease. One of the best ever. Cornbread - eh. Thought it was too greasy - it's cornbread! Why is it so greasy?!?!?! Wasn't thrilled with the mac and cheese, but the fries were right on. All in all, will go again! It's not the best BBQ I've eaten, but it's solid and definitely one of them. Don't go during the lunch and dinner rush. Way too overwhelming and you feel just a bit claustrophobic.

I'm rather shocked at how overrated this place is. Tried it one Saturday before it got crowded and was not pleased. The pulled pork was good. The BBQ-sauce (the one made with Coca-Cola) was just not there. Briscuit was tough and not much flavor. Mac and cheese was a joke and the cole-slaw was bad.

Not impressed.. heard rave reviews from co-workers and even saw a blurb about it on TV. But honestly didn't have anything that was "great" just kinda OK... not a fan of the runny BBQ sauce. Tried the pulled pork and the brisket.. brisket was mushy and fatty.. pork was stringy and tough.. The Brisket Chili was decent, although it was near boiling when we got it, couldn't eat it until almost the end of our meal.. Also the "shot glass" size Mac n Cheese was tasty, but seems like they could have had served a slightly larger portion. 蔒aybe it was a bad night for Smoque, but I've definitely had better BBQ elsewhere..

Go on a weekday around 2 and you won't have to wait long. The vibe is tremendous, the brisket is to die for, the duo BBQ sauces are yin and yang and the baked beans are magical.

Smoque was delicious! I ordered St. Louis ribs with mac n' cheese and fresh cut fries as my sides. I loved everything. The St. Louis ribs are really tasty with their bbq sauce and have a nice texture to them. The only thing I would have wanted was a more tender, fall-off-the-bone texture. Their sides were great too even the cole slaw and I usually hate cole slaw. Other than the ribs, i hear that the pulled pork is really good here so next time I must try that. My friends and I went during the week so it wasn't that busy, but I hear that the lines are usually out the door on the weekends and they even run out of certain items so get there early!

I grew up in Texas and am accustomed to top-notch BBQ. Smoque tastes like home. I love the "Add a Taste" option, which lets you add a small portion of any of various meats to your meal. Order take-out, and this gives you enough food for two or three meals. The chicken is good, (Texas) sausage is pretty great, and brisket is perfect. Unbelievably tender, moist, and perfectly blackened on the outside, this brisket tops 75% of the brisket I've had in the South. The peach cobbler is amazing, too. I can't wait to try the pulled pork and ribs.

Have been there twice and have gotten the ribs both times. The first time I got a 1/2 slab of st louis & 1/2 baby back. Both are excellent but I preferred the less fatty baby back ribs. It has a great crust! My 18 month old son also LOVES the ribs. Just pull the meat off the bone for him and he goes to town almost jumping out of the high chair because he was sooooo excited! My wife had the chicken and liked it very much. Second trip back I ordered only baby back ribs and they were excellent once again. They are not fall off the bone ribs. That is a good thing as fall off the bone ribs are boiled prior to smoking and then they lose flavor and actually become somewhat mushy....GROSS. reason for 4 stars is they are a bit pricey.

There really isn't much to say that hasn't been said. Simply put, this is the best BBQ place in the city. I had the pulled pork sandwich, the brisket sampler and a side of mac n' cheese. All were top notch Only drawback, like most great places, this place has a bit of a wait. I go weekdays after lunch and my wait is still usually 20 minutes to a half hour. Weekend nights...forget about it. However, great BBQ is worth the wait for some and this place is the best.

The St. Louis Ribs are juicy, tender, meaty and flavourful!! You can eat the ribs alone without the sauce. The sauce is a bit too tangy for me, but a little goes a long way and is necessary if you like to dip! The price is very reasonable for the tight budget that needs a little BBQ on those days when ur not grilling out. In fact, it's better. Best BBQ in town! Worth the hike even if you live in the burbs. You'll be very pleased with the taste, texture, and smell of the food.

I can't believe anyone would give this place less than five stars. I'm from southern BBQ country and this place has the best pulled pork, Mac n cheese, and coleslaw of any place I've ever been. We carry out at least once a month and have never been disappointed! The peach cobbler is amazing!

Went there around 2pm on a Saturday - barely any wait. Two friends and I ordered the pulled pork platter (coleslaw, peach cobbler, and mac&cheese) and the brisket. The brisket is amazing! Tender, full of flavor, slightly charred, and a little bit of fat on the edging. Pulled pork was good but not the best I've had. Cole slaw was vinegar based - lightly marinated, not to strong, a great accompaniment to the brisket and pork. Mac & cheese (baked) was typical. The cobbler was a comfort dessert - pretty sure they were made with canned peaches, however still really tasty. Their ribs were out of commission (issues with quality from the source) so I'll be interested in trying those next time.

I have heard so much good about Smoque from my family & friends. 蔍 tried it the other day & was quite disappointed. 蔍 had the brisket which was dry & burned. 蔍 then sampled my son's pork sandwich & that was much better & moister. 蔜he cole slaw was not very tasty either. The french fries were pretty good, but very greasy. 蔍 had the worst indigestion that day & into the next day. 蔕kay service & ready when promised, but afraid I won't be going back here.

When you have a bite of Smoque brisket in your mouth, it's impossible to imagine that better-tasting food exists anywhere in the world. 蔜he perfect order is: brisket platter with large mac n' cheese (large = 2) and peach cobbler.

I'm just throwing my hat into the big love (smoke) ring of Smoque. 蔅arry is a fantastic host, the counter help are so friendly and man... the food... it's my new destination spot for out of town friends just looking for an easy start to the night. 蔜he parking can stink, but it's so close to the Irving Blue Line that it's not a deterrent, especially with the lot in the back and the street parking in the neighborhood behind it at night. 蔍 love the southeastern-style vinegar sauce, both kinds of ribs are so fantastically meaty and juicy (and you can get a half slab of both to try), the pulled pork is pretty standard but still great, and the slaw is done perfectly. 蔍 love the baked beans, the mac & cheese - I have yet to try the brisket, but I fully plan to. It's BYO, and while I've done both wine and beer, I think that a Goose Island 312 goes perfectly. 蔍t doesn't compete with the flavor of the food and is easy to come by. 蔍 can't praise them enough, they are doing everything right!

I like BBQ. It holds such memories for me. Lazy, hazy summers, burgers, the charcoal, fun times with friends.... yea forget all that, I have a new one. For months I thought of Smoque. I heard about it, talked to people about it, wonder if it could ever hold up to my hopes and dreams. I went a little hog wild and had about half of the menu and it all good. I had the following: pulled pork sandwich, chopped brisket sandwich, baby back ribs, mac and cheese, fries, cole slaw, beans... and it was GOOD! Damn skippy it was awesome. I love how they put the sauce on the side, because I wanted to try the meat on its own, which was tender, moist, succulent and falling apart. I do have to vote for the chopped brisket as my favorite. The sides are limited to just the top favorites, but the beans win out as my favorite, how can you argue with beans that have meat in them?! Be aware, you may have to go early, they tend to run out of certain meats. I will be back, again and again and again.

The line was longer than the number of idiots who follow Kim Kardashian on Twitter. 蔋owever, the food at Smoque is very damn good. 蔍 must start with a major disclaimer. 蔜he baby back ribs were an epic FAIL!! 蔜hey did not fall off the bone. 蔜he meat was tough and difficult to bite off. 蔄lso the ribs were very boney. 蔜he meat was limited. 蔍 have had better ribs at Portillo's and Fridays. 蔍 was not a big fan of the BBQ sauce. 蔍 prefer something tangy and sweet. 蔜he sauce is flat and spicy. 蔍t does not make you want to lick your fingers. 蔔OW lets talk about what is excellent. 蔜he chopped brisket sandwich is beyond belief. 蔜he meat is very tender and flavorful. 蔜he sandwich is huge and the bread is very soft and melts in your mouth. 蔣ou must must must try the fries. 蔜hese are one of the best in Chicago. 蔍 fully understand why the lines were so long. 蔄lso, the mac and cheese is average. 蔍 did not hate it but I also did not love it.

Let me start by saying, I have hit the southern bbq trail in my travels. 蔍 have eaten at many of 蕋he legendary spots from North Carolina- Texas. 蔍 have also been to the popular "authentic" bbq joints in Chicago. 蔉YI- Smoke Daddy sucks. 蔍f you think Smoke Daddy is good bbq, you must think Pizza Hut is good pizza. 蔍f we are talking about the food, and only the food, Smoque is the best in the Chicago area. 蔛ure, there are lines, sure, they may run out of food. 蔜here is a reason why there is a line out the door on Wednesday night. 蔜HE FOOD. 蔜he ribs are awesome, don't bother with the baby backs though, the St. Louis are cheaper and better. �The brisket is great, the chicken is to die for...The only thing that I think is just okay is the pulled pork, but I don't order that when I get bbq much anyway. 蔜he sides are all very good. �I will admit, Fat Willy's has better Mac-N-Cheese, but that's about it. 蔛omebody went off about the peach cobbler being peach crumble, who the fuck cares what they call it, eat it, it tastes good. 蔍f you agree with me about the greatness of this place, you're right. 蔍f you don't you're a pussy.

I went into Smoque today with the highest of expectations, which is an attitude that usually ends up biting me in the ass. �Lower expectations generally equal a better overall experience in my book.) 蔆olor me impressed! 蔅oy did this place blow me away. 蔅eef Brisket so good I could weep... slow cooked and so tender that I did not require a knife for any portion of it. 蔠e also tried the pulled pork. 蔄gain, this stuff was so tender and delicious it just melted in my mouth. 蔜he BBQ Beans were some of the best I have ever tasted, with lots of onion and bacon that just made them heavenly. 蔜he mac and cheese was delicious, creamy, cheesy, with a great bread crumb crust baked on top. And, as crazy as this may sound... possibly the best french fries I have ever eaten. 蔄 side of fries comes in a large brown paper bag and as much as you think you won't be able to finish them - you'll devour every last one of these crispy, salty, heavenly fries. 蔜he sauce at Smoque is excellent as well - somewhere between a vinegary Carolina style sauce and a sweet smoky Kansas City sauce. 蔖erfect for dipping the fries into, I might add. 蔄ll of this at prices so reasonable you'll s**t a brick. 蔄 full brisket dinner with two sides and coleslaw for under ten bucks. 蔍 have never had better barbecue in the city of Chicago and can think of only one place in the whole country to rival this place (that would be Slow's BBQ in Detroit in case you're wondering.) 蔍f you haven't been here yet and you love BBQ... Go now! 蔒y #1 pick for BBQ in the city and #2 in the country. Just remember, they're closed on Mondays kids - which is usually a sign of a good restaurant in my book. 蔍f a restaurant isn't open seven days a week, it usually means there is someone there that gives a damn at all times and has to close to get a day off. 蔄nd if you don't like crowds, be sure to go at off peak hours like I did. 蔜his place is small, so I'm sure this place gets a bit uncomfortable if crowded. �((As an added note... I visited this place again last week and it was even better than the first time. 蔛eriously the best BBQ in Chicago, hands down!!!)))

Well here it is. I guess it's a common theme that people basically join Yelp just to review a place, and for me that place is Smoque. I've now been here three or four times, 蔳otten carryout probably 5 more times, and have officially had everything on the menu. The brisket is a revelation. Get the brisket. It is a little dry because it's BRISKET, and brisket is dry, but the chew, the flavor of the rub, and the sauce, oh my stars the sauce! The ribs are outstanding (I get St. Louis because I like meat, not just tenderness), and the half chicken is by far the most deeply flavored and moist I've ever had. My girlfriend raves about the baked beans, but I have to get two mac n'cheese and an extra side (it's like $2!) of cobbler. I can't even talk about the cobbler because there just aren't any words. The best is the taste menu. I can never settle on one thing, but since everything is so damn cheap here (a platter with two sides is $12 and change), I can get an extra side and then a bit of either brisket, chicken, or ribs (whatever I didn't order for the main), for an extra $3-4, and have it all. Surely I deserve it.

I came here yesterday, in the mood for barbecue. I read reviews about it and thought since I was nearby it would be a good place to stop by. I picked up a friend and even with the weather the place was really busy-I think there was a large party so it threw off the usual tuesday night place. Anyways, my friend and I ordered-she had already eaten but humored me and ordered the 1/2 and 1/2 sandwich (pulled pork and brisket) and I got the platter with 1/2 chopped brisket and 1/2 sliced brisket mac and cheese and corn bread. I have to say I wasn't too impressed with the place. The meat was good enough but I thought it weak sauce-literally. The extra they provided wasn't enough. I thought the portion size was pretty small too-we sat next to a small Asian woman who had two plates in front of her and she almost finished both. Not only was I still hungry but still in the mood for barbecue so I asked my friend if she wanted to go to Smoke daddy. Which we did, flip over to Smoke Daddy's page for a continuation of my adventures in Barbecue

This place will probably always have a line. 蔍'm not sure where else you can get this Texas style bbq in the city. 蔠e ordered the 1/2 baby back ribs and 1/2 St. Louis ribs with the cole slaw and 2 sides in which we chose the baked beans and the mac and cheese. 蔠e also ordered a snack size of the chopped pork. 蔜he meat is tender, but it didn't fall off the bone. 蔜here are 2 sauce options one that is vinegar based and one that is ketchup based. 蔅oth had a good tang, but disappointingly no spicy! 蔍 love how the baked beans had some chopped up meat in there as well. 蔍 don't usually care for mac and cheese, but I liked it here. 蔜he cole slaw emphasized the vinegar flavor in the sauce and was hoping it would be more different. 蔍t felt more like a salad than cole slaw. 蔜he prices are average from other rib joints. 蔍 may just come here to order the ribs again and just get sauce elsewhere....

I went first thing on a Sunday (11ish) and there was not a line at all. I got the chopped brisket platter w/coleslaw & got the baked beans & cobbler. My friend got ribs & a large mac n cheese (we split all the sides). My friend said her ribs were quite good. I thought my brisket was good, a little charred but that was ok. Good sauce. The portions for the meat were very generous but my friend and I both thought the portion on the sides was on the small side. We both agreed that the mac n cheese was great. The coleslaw is OK (it's a vinegar based dressing). I liked the baked beans & thought they had a nice smokey flavor....my friend thought they were just OK. We both agreed the cobbler was very good. 蔕verall I'd say the bbq was pretty good but I'm not sure it was the best bbq I've ever had. I think I expected a little more since seeing Smoque featured on the Food Network's Diners, Drive-Ins & Dives. I will say that they gave me a side of mac n cheese instead of baked beans the gal behind the counter just gave me a side of beans & let me keep the mac n cheese - which me and my friend were both thankful for because we really dug that mac n cheese. I'd give Smoque an extra 1/2 star based on that but sadly I can't. Pretty good bbq, it's worth a try.

Smoque has some of the best bar-b-que beef brisket I've ever had. 蔍 don't even like brisket normally and I crave this stuff. 蔜here must be drugs in it. 蔋ave the brisket! 蔈verything else is very good (chicken, ribs, pulled pork), but the brisket is great. � stars for the brisket. 蔜he mac-n-cheese is very good, but I wish it was bigger. 蔄 large order is simply two small orders, so my dreams of a large tray of mac were dashed. 蔜hey have a very usefull 1/4 st. louis ribs option, which is nice for the indecisive like me (brisket!). 蔍 do mostly take out, but as a sit down place the owners try their best to get everyone a seat. 蔜he inside is very informal, kind of cafeteria style, but is kept very clean and usually very busy. 蔍ts smaller than you may expect and usually the line is out the door for dinner. 蔛moque definitely has some of the highest overall quality BBQ in Chicago. 蔍t is not so much a dine-in restaurant that serves BBQ, but more of a specialty BBQ joint that you can sit in.

I don't know what ya'll are Smoque-in, but Smoque is a joke for BBQ. I went with a Texan and we both agreed the best thing we had was the sixpack of beer we brought in. He tried the brisket and I had the pulled pork... The pork was dry and flavorless. I tried their "BBQ sauce"... Well I actually mean their taco bell sauce. Seriously it really tastes like Taco Bell sauce. The owner could see I didn't like the sauce and brought me two other sauces. Still no better. Really runny and really bad flavor. The corn bread was dry and flavorless. The cole slaw was vinegary and soggy, but not a good soggy. The actual best part of the food we had was the BBQ beans. Was the only thing I cared to finish... All in all a bust. I would NOT recommend this place to anyone for any reason. Go to Fat Willy's. Even Twin Anchors is better, Even carson's.... �How there is always a line there, I don't know, but I guess you fans have never had truly good BBQ!

I had my hopes up very high I guess after seeing this joint on Triple D. And I love bbq. My fiance hit this dive up yesterday around 7ish pm & there was a small line one the door, but it moved pretty quickly. The place is pretty snug & is like a cafeteria style with the arrangement. It really looks like a dive.The smell was driving me insane, it smelled amazing. I scanned the menu quickly & decided upon a chopped brisket sandiwch & a half slab of st. louis ribs, my fiance (who didn't know the sandwich was going to be an acutal whole sandwich) did the half and half w/sliced brisket sandwich & pulled pork. We ordered for the sides, 2 drinks, a large macaroni and cheese, a large fry, and a large cole slaw. Total price: $46 dollars. We got seated by one the guys. It was packed inside. 蔠e didn't wait too long for the food which was a good thing. I quickly poured the sauce over the brisket sandwich and took a bite. The brisket itself was alright, I didn't get too much flavor from it, which I was surpised because I thought the guy put like a million spices on it. I did not like the sauce at all. I know this is because I am more partial to sweet sauces more than vinegar based ones. The fries were out of this world I loved them, I think my fiance only had a handful and I had the paperbag (which by the way is a great idea because the bag soaks up the grease). The macaroni and cheese was cheesy and I love the crust on top, it just needed a little bit more salt though. The cole slaw was deliciously tangy and refreshing. The ribs were amazingly juicy, tender, full of flavor, and literally fell off the bone. Pulled pork was alright, wish it had a better kick to it and the Texas sausauge tasted like a polish sausage! The drive for us and the price was not worth it for us unfortunately. in addition, the bus boys made me feel very rushed, they kept eyeing us and asking about taking our trays, it pissed me off & made me uncomfortable, it's not my damn fault the place is small & there's a big line, WTF you want me to do!!! I couldnt enjoy my food because of it even if it did taste ok. Better keep looking for a better bbq place.

Smoque is amazing!! I had the brisket sandwich and it was so good that I ended up placing a to-go order and took home more brisket and also the St. Louis Ribs, which were also phenomenal. The meat has so much flavor and its so moist. I would eat at this place multiple times a week if it was closer to where I live. This is a must for anyone who likes barbecue, and even those who dont!

If you enjoy Texas style BBQ then this is the place for you. I'm a fan of Memphis & KC style BBQ. I like the Brisket sandwiches and they're baked beans are great. Service is very good and there's usually a line but it's moving, so don't let the line scare you away. It's a clean place, BYOB and right off the Irving park & Pulaski Blue line exit (1/4 block south of the exit). Give it a go.

We just took my father and sister-in -law there for dinner. 蔍t was very busy in there, but the line moved quickly. 蔛itting is very limited, but they do a good job making sure you get a table, however it is totally a place to eat and go, not to sit and relax.

let's keep this short and sweet.......great place to get your bbq fix. 蕄ulled pork is nothing special, i suggest you go for the beef brisket. 蔵f you aren't going to order the fries, you should just forget about the whole meal. 蕋he fries are crispy little spears of perfection.......... let me explain: 蕄erfectly crisp on the outside, light and fluffy on the inside. 蔴urry up and go eat!

Sooooo Good! I used to think that BBQ was eaten only during the 4th of Juiy 蕂utside on the grass before I realized the are great BBQ restaurants hidden in the city!! 蔒y sister wanted to try Smoque, she had heard it was good so we went for dinner. 蔣ou order before you are seated, the staff is really helpful and nice, never mind this was our first time and we were asking the cashier a million questions and there was a long line behind us, she was really patient. 蔠e ordered the combo rib platter, pulled pork sandwich and texas sausage. 蔙ibs were juicy, tender and falling off the bone, the St Louis Style had a nice flavor to it, they offer BBQ sauce on the side , slightly sweet and not too vinigar-y. Don't miss the texas sausage, lots of flavor and well worth it, the sides are good too! Mac and Cheese, and beans were the favorites, all dinners come with slaw. 蔕nly dessert 蕂ffered is peach cobbler which has large chunks of peaches with a crumble/granola top served warm!

The atmosphere is very informal, rows of community tables and chairs. 蔜he meal is served on baking trays topped with parchment paper. 蔜he brisket is so tender, you don't need a knife. 蔜he pulled pork is also excellent. 蔜he mac & cheese is especially good and try the brisket chili if is available as a side. 蔜he BBQ sauce is thin and tangy so it doesn't drown the flavor of the meat. �The food definitely makes up for the lack of atmosphere.

Having been born and raised in the south, I've been dying for a decent BBQ place to open in this city. And while this place isn't great, it's the only decent place around. They smoke their meats unlike some places around here that think it's OK to boil it. The ribs are probably the best thing on the menu. I always go St. Louis style.

Wait: My husband and I arrived here at 7 pm on 7/2/10 and there was already a wait out the door. It was gorgeous out (yep, this was late summer when we went) so we didn't mind the wait. It took a 40 minute wait before we ordered! We were seated by the host after ordering and after a few minutes received our food. Ambience: crowded, feels like a lunch line and even has the lunch trays to compliment! Workers have a hard time keeping this place clean with so many people. Unorganized as tables get moved all over the place to accommodate groups, lots of kids- BLAH! Food:I ordered the chopped brisket sandwich with sides of the slaw and beans, plus an order of the cornbread. My husband ordered the sliced brisket platter with slaw and French fries. Everything was fine, but after hearing so many great things about it we both kind of shrugged like "thats it? this is what everyone has been talking about". I live within walking distance to this place and haven't bothered going back :(

We drove out from Schaumburg to try Smoque at noon on a Saturday. 蔍t was worth the 30+ minute drive. 蔜he line was shorter than expected. 蔜he available sides were varied just enough to make my husband, my thirteen year old son and myself happy. 蔍 had the beef brisket platter with fries and cornbread. 蔜he bark on the brisket was absolutely delicious! 蔜he hot, fresh fries were served in a brown paper bag with the perfect amount of seasoning. 蔜he cornbread was still warm enough to melt the butter. 蔍 was a bit disappointed at the temperature of the brisket though. 蔍t was chilly in the restaurant, so my brisket got cold really quickly. 蔒y husband had the pulled pork platter with fries and the baked mac n cheese. 蔆oleslaw came with the meal as well. 蔋e is a big fan of slaw and was pleasantly surprised at their simple, yet yummy slaw. 蔉inally, my son had a pulled pork sandwich with baked beans and the baked mac n cheese. 蔍 wanted to try what looked like a fresh, soft roll, but by the time I had asked for a bite, it was all gone. 蔋e wasn't a big fan of the breadcrumbs on top of the mac n cheese, but that was a first for him. 蔠e will definitely head back soon. 蔍 think we need to try the chicken, ribs and peach cobbler.

Finally tried Smoque because of the all the hype. I got here early so while it was crowded, the line wasn't astronomical yet. While the seating arrangement was a little too cozy for my taste, they are very nice and have an efficient process of getting you seated when eating in. Didn't want to spend more than $10 so I went with the pulled pork sandwich. The pork literally melts in your mouth. The coleslaw is obviously homemade and very tasty, so I slapped some on the sandwich. As far as the meat itself, these guys know their stuff. As far as the sauce, it 's vinegar based and thin, not really my style. Don't get me wrong it was good, but it didn't exactly have my taste buds dancing. Ever since tasting Sandy's sauce at Hog Wild, nothing compares. The fresh cut fries are good, salty, and plentiful. My main beef with this place is that if you want to have anything rib -like, it'll hit you up for close to $20. Considering the fact this seems to have become a staple of Chicago BBQ, in my opinion the menu should be a little more extensive. Would love to see pork tenderloin or rib tips on the menu as I'm sure they would be excellent. Can't give them four or five stars yet because I wasn't wowed, but I will definitely update when I try the ribs.

Best way to sum up Smoque for me is that it was a religious experience. Not sure I've ever had BBQ that was so amazing. The Brisket and Pulled Pork are unbelievable. I tried the sauce, but preferred it without any sauce. It's that good. Generally speaking, meat is not a huge part of my diet. But when I do indulge, I always appreciate high quality. This meal was perfection Their smoke flavor and seasoning are incredible. The meat is tender and moist. The Mac and Cheese is wonderful, too. More souffle-like as opposed to creamy. Beans are a bit spicy, but delicious. The Peach Cobbler is to die for. I could have made a meal out of that. What I found kind of cool is that if you look at the menu photography on their website, the food actually looks exactly like that in real life! 蔛moque was worth the wait. Can't wait to go back and try the Ribs and Sausage, although I'm not sure I ever want anything but their Pulled Pork. Crowded as hell, but they manage it well. �Highly recommended.

Probably one of the best lunches I have had in awhile. 蔍 ordered the half & half sandwhich with a side of beans. 蔜his was a perfect menu option for a guy who wants to order one of each. 蔜he brisket and pulled pork were awesome. 蔜hey weren't topped off with coleslaw like I have seen in the south but it was offered on the side. 蔜he bread was also a little nicer than I have seen at more traditional places butt I tried not to compare Smoque to the South because as other yelpers seem to have neglected I realized this is a Texas BBQ, not a soul food based place. 蔠e waited in line about 10 minutes to order and once we were near finished eating they weren't the least bit shy about moving us out of our seats. 蔍 enjoyed how they had fountain soda with free refills and didn't appreciate how small the portion sizes were for the majority of their sides like the mac n cheese. 蔕verall, some great food and cool atmosphere with reasonable prices.

The food is amazing, especially the perfectly smoked BBQ. Sides are great too, the beans are just awesome. Don't expect to sit and have a private, cozy conversation; the tables are pushed together and the dining area is small. My spouse and I enjoyed eating in but with the small, tight space we'd probably not bring our little kids here. We'll be back and probably do takeout. If you're thinking about trying it, do not hesitate, especially if you like BBQ (and know what is "good" BBQ a la Memphis/Texas)! 蔜he food is worth it!

MMMMMMM!! 蔜here's a reason why this place is famous. 蔄fter seeing it on "Diners, Drive Inns and Dives" we yelped it. 蔄fter reading all the good review we decided it's a must try. 蔛o we went there at 3pm on a Saturday. 蔜he place wasn't as crowded as I expected (yelp said this was the best time to come). 蔍 got the brisket platter with fries and corn bread. 蔜he bf got the pulled pork dinner with the mac n' cheese and baked beans. 蔠e also ordered a 1/4 slab of ribs. 蔠e wanted to try everything. 蔈verything was excellent. 蔍t's byob so we brought a six pack which went great with the Southern style BarBQ. 蔜he ribs had a great dry rub and fell off the bone. 蔍've never had brisket and pork this soft. 蔜he beans had a great flavor and the baked mac n cheese with breadcrumb topping was excellent. 蔉ries were great and came in a big bag. 蔍'd suggest trying everything when you go here, you can get small orders of all the main entrees. 蔕ur total bill was $26 which I thought was really reasonable for the quality and amount of food. 蔜he staff was nice even though they were extremely busy. 蔇efinitely a hidden gem worth checking out.

Holy COW. It's got to be since the brisket sandwiches are heavenly. Full of flavor and juicy enough that you don't need a drink to wash it down with. Juicy enough that you don't need any extra sauce. The sauce is vinegar based. I personally think it would be a little bit better if it had less vinegar but I think I will live. With a big smile on my face. The Mac & Cheese is awesome. Mind blowing. It's also tasty. I don't live too far from this joint and I have had it only a couple times. But I will be a regular at this establishment for a long time coming.

I am not really a BBQ person but I really enjoyed Smoque! This was my first time at the restaurant and it was pretty much what I had expected... counter service, long communal tables, and very casual. (A perfect BBQ joint.) I was lucky and got to try different things since I convinced my dining companions that we should just share. Unfortunately, they were out of pulled pork by the time we got there. We tried the brisket, both chopped and sliced, the chicken and the baby back ribs. The BBQ sauce was very good, again not a great judge of that stuff, but I know when I like it! The sliced brisket was so tender and melt-in-your-mouth delicious... the chicken juicy... the baby back ribs really succulent! My favorite, though, were the fries. Yes, I am a french fry connoisseur. And when you have a place like this, I think you need good, crispy fries. Yum! I also tried the mac 'n cheese, but I did not like it. It was too cheesy... like with swiss cheese or something that didn't taste right to me. And everything came with cole slaw, which I am never really a big fan of. Overall, it was a great meal! The portions are big so i would recommend to share. Also, get there early... there are lines out the door quite often. We got lucky and got there just in time...

Only giving 4 stars because I find the pulled pork to be pretty average. However, the brisket is amazing. The mac-n-cheese puts any to shame and if you catch the brisket chili on the menu, it's a must-have. Follow it all up with the peach cobbler and there's a dangerous meal.

nummm numm nummm.. Thank you Erin for taking me here for my bday. The best brisket I have ever had! So tender I didn't even have to chew because it just melted in my mouth! Be warned you will be waiting in a long line.. but so worth it! There is no waitress so you are waiting for a seat and your food! One of the owners acted like a host and made sure people were seated and enjoying there food. The menu is a giant chalkboard. I was lucky enough to find out they had a half and half sandwich that wasn't on the board yet. =D I was able to taste the brisket and the pulled pork! The sandwich portion allows you one side and Coleslaw and the dinner gives you two sides! I have to say I love the BBQ sauce and I am not a fan of the vinegar sauce that is how good the sauce is! Being an awesome GF I ordered Dan a half slab of ribs with corn bread and mac and cheese to go! (I sampled it later in the night.. and oh delicious). Oh yelpers this place is BYOB but I don't think they have wine glasses so bring your beer! Public transportation is not far, take Blue Line to Irving and walk South down Pulaski! When you see the line of people waiting and the smiles of people who are leaving.. you know you are there!

Just thinking about Smoque makes my mouth water and my hands shake. I started going there after seeing it on Food Networks "Diners, Drive-Inns, and Dives. Being that it is located less than 1 mile from my home also didn't hurt. Hands down their sliced brisket sandwich is the best BBQ item I have ever tasted in my life. Always hot, always fresh, always kick ass! I've also tried the Pulled Pork sandwich which was so tender it melted in my mouth. The BBQ beans are great as well as they add pieces of the brisket in there for a very smoky like texture. The Macoroni and Cheese is yummy with a crusted layer of parmesan on the top. Cole slaw is good and the ribs are to die for. But if you are going here for 1 thing it would be the sliced brisket (chopped brisket is OK but the flavor disappears for some reason). The owner Barry is always there and always courteous and genuine. Warning though, if you can go on a weekday after 2PM to avoid the killer lines. Also they tend to run out of food because they are so busy on Friday, Saturday, and Sunday. Chicago BBQ at its best. And its closed on Mondays.

I used to work in the restaurant business for 9 years and I have eaten here at least a dozen times, and have never had less than a five star food experience. It makes me irritated to read reviews where people are searching for something to criticize in this place. I understand BBQ is a very subjective experience, but nothing these guys do is mediocre. If their biggest sin is long lines, I can live with that. This place uses quality ingredients in everything they make. All of their sides a truly homemade from scratch-no food service prepared product here. Real mac-n-cheese (crusty on top), homemade cornbread, beans from heaven, crisp vinaigrette coleslaw, 蕄each cobbler is amazing. 蔍n my opinion, their prices are too low for what they do with food. 蔐et's hope they can keep up these high standards of food production. These guys could have sold out long ago, but have stayed true to their high standards of quality! Keep up the great work!!!

The food at smoque is great, the dining area is cramped. 蔍 really enjoy the food here. 蔜he sauce is tangy, and the ribs are great. 蔍 like the mac n cheese also. 蔜his place is byob, but I would caution you from going here to enjoy a dining experience. 蔍t is crazy busy, and they move people in , and out.

I am very discerning when it comes to barbeque restaurants. 蔍 have to say, Smoque is one of the best BBQ joints I have tried in Chicago. 蔜he restaurant is housed in an unassuming building right off of the expressway. �I went there at about 6pm on a Saturday. 蔜here was a line, but it moved quickly with people being efficiently seated. 蔣es, they could use more room, but they manage the space they have very well. 蔄fter ordering, the food was quickly prepared and the order was accurate. 蔜he staff was helpful and very friendly. �The food is portioned into full and half sandwiches and slabs of ribs, as well as $3.00 tastes of pulled pork and brisket. 蔜his allows you to sample many of the offerings through smaller portions. �I ordered half portions of sliced beef brisket, pulled pork sandwich and half a baby back ribs. 蔜he brisket was moist, juicy and lean. 蔜he pulled pork sandwich was one of the best I have ever tried. It was tender, moist and smoked/seasoned perfectly. 蔜hey don't put any sauce on the food, instead giving you a generous portion of sauce on the side. 蔜heir sauce is adequate, but not the best. 蔍t is watery and smokey. 蔍 prefer a thicker sauce, like Sweet Baby Ray's. 蔍 took my order to go and ended up using my own sauce at home. �Side dishes were pretty good. 蔜he fresh cut fries, perfectly cooked and seasoned were outstanding. 蔜he mac and cheese is very, very good. 蔒ac and cheese is a good litmus test for a restaurant and they passed this test with flying colors. 蔍 also tried the peach cobbler and was disappointed. 蔍t was not very sweet or rich. Lastly, it is BYOB. 蔜hat means you pay half price for the same bottle of wine at a non-BYOB restaurant. 蔜he prices are reasonable, you save on the liquor and they have great food.

Is it really necessary to even review this place? Just give Smoque five stars and lock it from ever being reviewed again. If you've never been, just go. Best Bbq, sauce, mac n' cheese, fries, beans etc. Flipping amazing.

I visited Smoque after seeing a good review in the Reader, and really liked the barbecue. We had a little bit of everything - St Louis style ribs, briskly, pulled pork , mac & cheese, and BBQ beans. The ribs, brisket and sides were great. Pulled pork, not so much. St louis ribs were meaty, not fatty but not too dry. The BBQ beans were really good, too. A vinegary sauce with just enough spice. The line to order snakes into the middle of the room, and seating is basically family- style. I'll definitely be back.

Unfortunately most people in the upper Midwest believe good bbq is made from boiling ribs. Not so. I have been to the best hole in wall bbq joints in the south, Smoque ranks at the top with Whole Hog in Little Rock, Lewling's in Houston, Sonny Bryan's in Dallas, Arthur Bryant in KC, Corky's in Memphis, et al. Smoque's brisket is the best of all..ultra tender. Pulled Pork is near the top too. Ribs are good, but Smoke Daddy may be better. Sides are great...mac & cheese, beans, cobbler. I have not tried the sausage. BTW...the sandwich buns are off the charts. Be smart about when you go. Weekdays @ 2pm would be a good idea. 蔜his place is for serious BBQ lovers who understand and appreciate smoke cooking. If you want boiled meat...eat a hot dog!!

Came all the way from Houston, Texas to check out this BBQ on the recommendation of our Chicago family. Sure... we saw it on the Food Network but who knows more about BBQ than Texans??? We were skeptical but let me tell you this is the REAL DEAL...ribs smoked to perfection, tender and delicious brisket, unforgettable sausage and even got to sample the Turkey which they will hopefully add to the menu. Excellent sides...don't miss the Mac & Cheese, just enough grease on the fries. BBQ sauces were perfect...I'd put Smoque up to any Texas BBQ in our state and we don't ever make those kind of claims. Don't tell our folks back home...but you got a great thing going Chicago. Smoque is AWESOME!!!

I went here for the first time the other night with a few friends. 蔉or my sides, I ordered the sliced brisket with cornbread and mac & cheese. 蔜he brisket had good flavor and was very tender, but it was by no means the best barbeque that I have ever had. 蔍n fact, I felt that the best thing that I was served was my side of mac & cheese. 蔍 didn't try any of the other types of barbeque which my friends had, so I don't know if I happened to order Smoque's least-extraordinary item. 蔍 also thought that the portions were on the smaller-side. 蔛ome of my friends ordered sandwiches, and I felt as though the amount of meat that they were served was comparable in size to my entr巈. 蔍t wasn't just my entr巈 that was small. 蔒y sides of mac & cheese and cornbread were relatively small too.

We came after hearing about Smoque for months. I had the smoked brisket and ribs. 蔜he brisket was very good and the ribs were well flavored but did not fall off the bone, which is the way I prefer them. Overall of Smoque is a good value and worth trying but it didn't live up to all the high praise I had heard about it.

Let me begin by saying.....I live on the westside of Chicago. 蔜here are several places with excellent BBQ ribs on my side of town, but I've heard rave reviews about Smoque so my husband and we decided to stop in when we were in the area over the holidays. 蔍 hate to say that I was sorely disappointed. 蔠e ordered Baby Backs and St. Louis ribs. 蔜hey were not to our liking. 蔄lthough very tender, 蔍 was not crazy about the taste. 蔍 didn't get that "smoqued" flavor I crave from the grill. 蔠hat happened to that? 蔜his is another place I can mark off my list.....I tried it.

I would say this is the best BBQ in Chicago.. Great Beef Brisket, Mac and Cheese, Peach Cobbler and Fries.. Service is great.. staff always friendly.. and it is BYOB.. not much seating, but we always take ours to go.. that way you don't have to wait in line.. call ahead and do it early as they sometimes run out of ribs..

My mouth waters just thinking about Smoque...best bbq in the city. The pulled pork is amazing, and the mac & cheese is to die for. 蔠e've been coming here since they opened a few years back, and every meal has been amazing. 蔜he service is always great, and the owner is usually around talking to customers. 蔍t's pretty busy now that everyone knows about this place, so the wait is typically an hour, even for carryout. 蔅ut the food is definately worth the wait!

Having been to Texas recently and eating some AMAZING BBQ, I was excited to try this place. And I wanted to love it as I'm on a never ending search for some good brisket in Chicago. Unfortunately, this one isn't as good as I need it to be. I'm not saying their brisket is bad but I don't believe it's as amazing as everyone says. Yes there was a smoke ring on it but it was tiny. If you got a bite with that, the flavor was good. But the meat in the middle was almost bland. I really don't like BBQ sauce and think the meat should stand on it's own so I can't comment on that. My boyfriend enjoyed his meal. I know he got ribs but couldn't tell you what else other than the brisket chili. This was pretty good but a really small portion. And it's not cheap either. 蔅etween the two of us, I spent almost $30 on lunch. 蔍 suppose I understand the lines out the door as there really aren't too many places that it's competing with. 蔍 would say that Chicago is starved for some truly great BBQ. 蔝nfortunately, this place isn't going to hold a candle to true Texas BBQ.

Absolutely a top notch BBQ pit. 蔜he whole package. 蔊ood brisket, sausage, home cut fries, and beans were very well done. 蔅risket was sliced from the point and had good bark and flavor and was done just right (the point is always more tender than the flat due to the extra fat in the point). Nice thick slices of brisket with large servings of everything, and smoked with apple and oak by people who know what they are doing. 蔍'm from out of town, but I'd eat here every time I come back into the Chicago area. 蔇idn't have a chance to try the ribs, but I will next time. 蔖rices are not cheap like Texas, but are reasonably priced for the quality food that you get. 蔇on't miss this if you like real pit BBQ.

I heard good things about Smoque so I had to give it a shot while in Chicago and staying close to O'Hare. 蔈xtremely easy to get to by train using the Blue line and Irving Park stop. 蔜hey are only 1 1/2 blocks from the station. 蔜his is a BYOB hole in the wall place where you order and pay, then give the number in your party and your order number to the "table guy" who will find a place for you at the lineup of tables when someone finishes and leaves. 蔞ery low keyed place; get your own soft drink or ice tea (sweet and unsweetened) and wait for the table guy to seat you. 蔙emember - it's BYOB. 蔣our number will be called and you will need to go get your trays from the kitchen area. 蔣ou will eat elbow to elbow so don't expect a romantic atmosphere. 蔜he sweet tea was just OK although they do it much better down south. 蔍 LOVE smoked meats and have a smoker at home which I have worked hard to perfect my recipes so I am discriminating when it comes to smoked BBQ. 蔋ere's my review: 蔜he chicken is off the charts - best damn smoked chicken I have ever tasted. 蔙ich smoky flavor, moist, tender, nice crispy skin and good flavor. 蔖ulled Pork, brisket, and St. Louis ribs were a disapointment. 蔜he meats were tender but the smoke flavor was not there. 蔍 would go back for chicken but not for the pork or beef. 蔅aked beans are spicy, contain meat, onions, and are tasty. 蔜hey could use some nice smoke flavor and tone down the spice. 蔜he spicyness overrides this dish. 蔛law is very basic - sliced cabbage in a non-creamy sauce, i.e. no mayo in it. 蔍t's on the sweet side which I like but the large slices of cabbage made it a bit messy to eat. 蔜he peach cobbler comes in individual portions the size of a cupcake. 蔜he top crust was harder than it should have been but was tasty. 蔕verall it's OK - not terrific. 蔜he fries are home cut and fried, and are served in a small brown paper bag to soak up the grease. 蔜hey were very good. They have a clean up crew that will take your tray and trash when you have finished and will wipe the table down. 蔍t would be nice to have wet naps 蕇o you could clean your hands at the table. 蔠hen it's crowded it's a struggle to get to the restrooms to hose off. 蔖rices were OK but they don't offer a half and half platter so you can sample two different meats. 蔍nstead you need to order one (like pulled pork) then do the "add a side" for $3.00. 蔍f you love smoked meats, you need to try their chicken.

visited this place during my trip to chitown. i never realized how popular this place was. i mean yeah, there was a line out front but i thought it was simply because the place was "too small" to accommodate the hungry crowds during dinner time. mind you that i didn't ask to come here, i was simply taken here and told that they had great ribs. as i stepped inside the building, i quickly realized how supposedly "well known" the place was. there was a picture of "that guy" i saw i think on food network? i was never a fan of the guy and never thought his attempts of being funny was working. anyway, so yeah the guy probably visited this place, big deal. give me the ribs and let me decide for my self. so finally we got up to the register, i got my self the saint louis ribs as i wanted to try something other than baby back. with that i also got the sides of coleslaw, fries, and mac-n-cheese. how did they taste? let's start with the sides. coleslaw... ehhh... never cared so much about that style of coleslaw although my sister seemed to favor that style. the mac-n-cheese? holy smokin' shopping cart! i love home-style mac-n-cheese! i'm a big mac-n-cheese fan, either home cooked or the fancy ones from restaurants so i've tried a lot of different maccies from different places and let me tell you (well, let my writing tell you) it was one of the best mac-n-cheeses i've had. it came in a smaller container (wish it was bigger; maybe next time i'll supersized the darn thing) and the top part was "baked to perfection". crispy bits and pieces of cheese... heck yea! and last but not least, the fries. i quite like them actually. i tend to prefer the thin cut ones but this seemed to go along with the ribs perfectly. so let's get to the ribs. was it actually good and did it represent the hype? well, it was one of the better ribs i've had and i could tell you that they've put some work marinating the ribs. i actually preferred them without the dipping sauce. this should tell you how much taste the rib it self has. one thing i was really happy about is the service. the workers are really nice and cracked a joke or two here and there. overall, i gave this place a 5 outta 5 because of the whole experience together, not just for the food.

went back to the hometown for the weekend and hit up smoque for lunch. we had the sliced brisket platter with mac & cheese and beans and pulled pork sandwich. now at first i was like WTF the portions got friggin tiny. few slices of brisket yet i remember the sides were on the smaller size. brisket was still delicious..meat falls apart and they got good bbq sauce. gobbled the platter up quickly but due to dipping in excessive amounts of sauce it made me content but not full. mac & cheese is crusty on top and gooey cheese delicious. baked beans here are prolly one of the best. they put bits of brisket or ribs so it's quite nice. can't wait until i go back home for some more!

amazing. 蕇eriously, there must be crack in that sauce. 蕎hen they first moved in, my family gave them a try. 蔵 kid you not that we were all pretty impressed by the food, but only mildly so when it came to the sauce. 蔭nd then... well, now i cant have enough of the sauce. 蔵 plunge my sammiches into it, so good. 蕋he food is great. 蔶uicy, delicious, and even the fat which i usually take off was too good not to eat - melts in your mouth. 蕂h, and the sides? 蕁o wonder there's lines out the door on a regular basis. 蕎e've even been told on several occasions that we cant order the food we want (for pick-up) bc they're all out (they've gotten better about having enough, but sometimes, you cant predict the mass amounts of people that show up... ) these guys are good!! 蔭nd, they're a pleasure to deal w; just about every time i've come there, the owner (or one of them) is always there. 蔵 think thats the sign of someone who cares. 蕀ay be pricey, but def worth it!
