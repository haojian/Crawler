The original hollenbeck is the best burrito ever made. The chunks of pork are tasty and the chiles and tomatoes they are cooked in compliment it very well. I've been going there for 30 years and only had three things--quesadilla, bean burrito, and finally a graduation to the hollenbeck when my tastes matured. I highly recommend getting cheese added to your hollenbeck and then maybe a sprinkle of salt. Perfect! Parking can be tough and there is often a wait outside in line. But it's always worth it!

Hahaha, like many others, I heard about this place from Man v Food. 營t turns out my Dad used to come here when he was younger as well. 燞e told me some funny stories about his interactions with Manuel, the owner. I am a man of value, and this place gives it to you. 營 get the Okie Burrito because it comes swimming in red sauce. 營 get the carnitas. 燭here are chunks of carnitas in the burrito AND on top of it. 燣ots of cheese. 燘eans. 燚elicious. That being said, have I had better tasting burritos and carnitas... sure, but not for this kind of price value. �Tepeyac is popular and it can get crowded at times, avoid high traffic hours, like lunch and after work. 燭he place is small, so if you can't find a place to sit, expect to wait in a line or take it to go. You will most likely not finish your burrito, so you'll have some left over for tomorrow. The Manuel Special is giant. 營 can't even finish the smaller Okie. �Anyway, this place is a LA staple and you need to come eat here. �Normally, I would give this place about 4 stars, however, I have to give it 5 stars because of the incredible value. 燭he food is good and there is a lot of it, and they deserve kudos for that. 營f the food were bad, they wouldn't be considered a value play. Definitely one of the ultimate WET burritos though, phew.

I always get the giant Manuel's Special burritos. (1 burrito is $20ish and will at least feed three men, easily). The novelty of such a large burrito is well worth the sacrifices in burrito construction which you lose. It's almost more like eating a whole animal family style than eating a burrito.

FOR NOVELTY PURPOSES ONLY I hate to be the negative Nancy but I'm telling you how it is! Yes... I gave it two stars because as a Los Angeles native I definitely have experienced better. Sat at the counter last night about 8:45. The waitresses are peaches but didn't get my order right. I wanted the #4 with ranchera sauce and not red sauce. I got the red sauce. I didn't take it back because I'm a good sport and I don't like to waste food. Fine, I'll eat it. The red sauce tasted like it was straight out of the can. The beans and rice were pretty much standard but I will say the chicken was tender and flavorful if and when I could get it out of that red nightmare of a sauce. The salsas on the table? El Tepeyuck!! Seriously the worst salsa I have had in my life. Both the green and red. I actually jerked back a bit in surprise when I had the salsa verde. How you can mess up such simple ingredients and have it taste like that?? So bitter! So spicy but with no flavor? How'd the sam hill did that happen? It seemed like I was nickle and dimed every step of the way for every little moco! $2.75 for Horchata no refills, $1.45 for a dollop of sour cream to try to mask that devil red sauce. More $ for chips, $5 for quacamole (which was fine)... No! The madness stops here! So, you want a gigantic burrito of mundane ingredients that was featured on a second rate reality food show? Take the instagram pictures and post them, say you did it and ventured into the hood. You will never be back unless you don't know any better. I say, 爈ob that burrito in any direction in East LA and find a better burrito with exquisite, certified abuelita made salsas for much cheaper.

We saw this place on "man vs. food" and decided to give it a try. (I also saw it featured on "Southland") If you're getting a burrito, get the Machaca over the asada. And man these burritos are HUGE! The place is small and the line to get in was HHUUGGEE!!! We just decided to sit at the counter and then the wait was only 2 minutes or so. So be aware. But this place is definitely a must try for sure!....it just isn't "amazing".

Ive been consuming Manuel's food since my mom got pregnant with me twenty two years ago. EVERYTHING is delish. When I go, I always spilt a Manuel's Special (massive burrito in guac., meat [beef or chicken], cheese, rice and beans) with my brother and father (its that big). Decent pricing, friendly fast service. I also reccomend their chicken taquitos, cheese or chicken enchiladas, Manuel Special (if you're a huge eater or eating in a group). Sometimes Manuel is there when the line is long and he'll offer you a free shot right then and there! Hahaha! I don't drink but most other latinos do so this is a pretty nice gesture hahaha

My friend's mom used to get the giant burrito here and it was one of the greatest things I have ever eaten in my life. However, the last two times changed it all from that first experience. We would kind of pitch in to get the burrito now and order it. The last two times I got it, it tasted a bit bland and the ingredients didn't taste fresh at all. Also, the drinks for this place is real pricey. $2.75 for a 20 oz is pricey and tasted ok. However, the good part is that the burrito is good to feed like more than 10 people and it's somewhat worth the price. A decent place to get a big share of food, but not a place I will go often.

I was on a roadtrip with 11 high schoolers and we were staying at the Boys & Girls Club in the neighborhood. We asked the employees and kids at the Club where we should eat, and everyone said "El Tepeyac." Being that we were a group of 13 black or white people, the guy who worked at the Club walked us there and ate with us. I'm not sure if any non-Mexican people have ever been in that neighborhood. It was a great experience, especially for my teens. The restaurant is basically an experience in and of itself. We got the Manuel's Special burrito and it was legitimately huge. What the actual fuck. It came in one of those big tin serving trays that could otherwise be used as like a baby crib or something. It wasn't just huge, either; it was really good. In ordinary fashion, I just asked the waiter what was best and we went with that. I got the Jamaica to drink and it was for the win.

I saw this place on Man vs Food, so I came here with some friends to try the Manuel's special. The burrito wasn't that great, and yes, it is for novelty use only.

I visited this place after seeing it on television. The guacamole/taquitos were what 燽rought me here but once I arrived, most people were wolfing down burritos and so that's what I ordered. I ordered the Machaca burrito with enchalada sauce. Now you can see from the photos above that these are as big as your forearm and somehow I managed to put away three-quarters of it. Afterwards I felt proud and disgustingly full at the same time. Since it also happened to be my birthday...they did not hesitate to pour me and my girlfriend each a shot of tequila (maybe moonshine because it came out of a Vitamin water bottle). On top of that, they played a Happy Birthday song on the old school juke box. It was so unexpected, but everyone was so incredibly 爅ovial and friendly that I won't soon forget it. Overall this place deserves five stars from me because of the friendly and fast service, good taste, big portions, and great value for what I ordered. Bravo!

So as my bf and I were leaving CSULA and we thought it would be a good idea to eat before we got on the freeway so he yelped mexican food and became super excited when this place popped up since he saw it on the man vs food...or some tv show..not sure. Anyways, we went in at about 3pm and there was not a lot of people. We sat ourselves and the waitress came over and took our order. We ordered a chicken burrito (it says it feeds 3-5 people or something like that). When the lady brought it out I almost had a heart attack!! IT WAS GIANT! We ate less than half and I was surprised because my bf is a monster and he eats like a pig. Overall, the taste of the chicken was really good. The burrito had beans, rice, chicken, and chili. I would come back and would recommend if you are around the area.

I've been coming here since I was just a teenager! Before the MvF craze! My dad, brother, and I would come here and share a Hollenbeck burrito with an order of taquitos. The stewed pork they put on and in the burrito is delectable. Juicy tender cubes of pork with this delicious tomato based sauce and tender onions top this massive burrito pillow they call the Hollenbeck! It's awesome! The taquitos are a little pricey, but when you get the plate and you see the mountain of guac which accompanies your 2 taquitos it all makes sense. Although I have noticed that the mountain of guac seems a little smaller than I remember when I was younger. Nontheless this place is def worth a try! I will continue coming here as long as Manuel is pumping out great food. Did I mention the Manuel Special is great as a birthday burrito cake? Pop a few candles in that baby and you got yourself a bday cake better than any real cake lol

The burrito was good and its carne asada was finely chopped. 燭hey were generous with both beans and guac. 燭oo much bean but loving its chunky guac. �I went back again 2 days later since I was craving its carne asada and guac bad. 燳ea..I ordered the same thing again. 營t was still good, but not as good as the first time. 燤y carne asada was chunky and this time I asked for less beans. 營ts meat wasn't as tasty as the meat I tasted on my first visit. Service was amazing!!! 營 asked for extra sauce and got it in seconds. 燬omeone was always checking to make sure I got everything I needed. 營 ate half of the burrito because I didn't want to be Ms. Piggy (even though it's hard to stop eating) and the worker actually grabbed a new tortilla and made a new burrito from the leftover. Funny how this place is so different compared to Industry location. 燭his place is like a neighborhood place and Industry place is so corporate. 燬ervice is efficient, fast and friendly here and the other location messes up all my orders. 燭he food at this location is 10X better too.

Went on a Saturday afternoon for a late lunch. A short line of people were waiting to be seated inside as expected from what I read in the reviews. The hubby and I decided to get the food to-go at the window on the side of the building. That line was pretty short and they helped each customer very quickly. We ordered the Hollenbeck - one of the most recommended burritos in reviews and I believe it was the one featured on TV?? and a side of guacamole and chips and a couple horchatas. There is a huge outdoor eating area, mostly covered overhead, and you can just get your food "to-go" and eat it there. Pros: -Burritos are as huge as people say they are. The two of us are big eaters, starving and needing food to pick us up after getting our pockets emptied (just had our taxes done down the street). -Guacamole was HUGE for a small size and you can taste the freshness of the avocados. -Tender, juicy meat. -Fast service. Cons: -Size isn't everything. Don't get me wrong- the Hollenbeck was delicious, but I've had better. The large size does not yield equal distribution of ingredients. My half had a ton of meat and some beans, my husband's side had some meat, little beans and a TON of rice. The massiveness of the burrito also makes you want a better tortilla-to-meat ratio. If I am in the area, I'd probably try El Tepayac again but I wouldn't drive there for no reason other than to have their food. -The menu board outside doesn't give much of a description of what is in the entrees. It is like they assume that you know what a Hollenbeck, Okie and Oscar entail.

The oversized burritos are overhyped. The burrito is huge but the flavor is lacking. It's super salty and that's about it. I'd say the only saving grace was the guacamole in the burrito - so chunky and yummy. This place is obviously well-known and worth trying once, but a second trip is probably very unlikely.

My friend and I were going down to Los Angeles for the day to do some shopping and whatever. 燤y dad recommended this place. 燱e thought it sounded good, so we went, parked, and waited... waited for 30 long minutes outside, in the hot southern California sun. 燼fter FINALLY getting a seat inside, we sat right next to the juke box, the server brought us our drinks and some chips, and we took a look at the menu. 燤y dad recommended the Hollenbeck burrito, so, we both ordered that. 燱hile we waited, we munched on chips and salsa, which was pretty damn good. 營 totally dig places that do chips in salsa, especially when it's free, especially when the chips are fresh, and especially when the salsa is rockin'. 營 then turned my attention to the juke box that was RIGHT behind me. 燗fter browsing through it, I found that Led Zeppelin IV was on there. 燦ot my favorite Zeppelin album, but they ARE my favorite band, so, I put the money in and played the entire album. 爂ood stuff. The burrito had finally arrived, and it was massive. 爋ne of the largest burritos I've ever seen... then... we dove in. 營 added some of that rockin' salsa I mentioned earlier to the burrito which was a pretty good idea. 燛verything on it tasted excellent. 燭he meat was great, and so was everything else on the burrito... it was quite incredible... but a bit TOO filling. 燽y the time "When the Levee Breaks" started playing, I had gotten 3 quarters of the way done. 燤y god. 燼nother bite could NOT be had. 燗 burp of satisfaction was had (in a mannerful fashion of course) and I then gave up. 燤y friend however, finished his burrito. 爌rops to him. El Tepeyac was excellent. 燫eally good food, great employees (our server kept our glasses full, which is a must for carne asada.

I had a chicken salad at El Tepeyac. I know. I'm probably the only customer that has ever walked through their doors and ordered, of all things, a salad. El Tepeyac is famous and beloved for their burritos of enormous proportions. The burritos have been well-reviewed by other Yelpers already, so I'll keep this brief. I've had the Hollenbeck a couple times and the Okie, and preferred the original Hollenbeck. Yes, the first time I came here, I ate the whole burrito for lunch... and then I didn't eat dinner. Never again. After that, I always cut half or 1/3 of it to set aside and take home for later. The burritos don't really taste that special to me... I think it's moreso that the ridiculous size is the huge draw. And now... the review you've all been waiting for... the chicken salad. El Tepeyac, or any Mexican joint, really isn't a good place to go to if you're trying to watch your diet. However, I came for a birthday lunch today, and was determined to stay my ground. Mission: To order something a little less heavy... so, the salad. The chicken salad costs $9.50, and comes with grilled chicken, iceberg lettuce, jack cheese, grilled onions, avocado slices, tomato slices, tortilla chip strips, cilantro, and bacon. I requested no bacon and dressing on the side. The menu advises that it takes 15 minutes to prepare. I really should have used the burritos to guide my expectations, however... because the plate came, and the portion was ENORMOUS. It's piled high, covers the entire plate, and is larger than any of the regular burritos. This thing would easily feed two, and possibly three people. So much for going light! Consistent with their apparent mantra of "bigger is better," they gave a plate of two huge containers of salad dressing, which looked like thousand island and some other kind of viscous clear stuff with red flakes... Italian? The plate also had a container of several lemon wedges, which I opted to squeeze over my salad instead. The salad was... a little ordinary. I'm not much of a fan of iceberg lettuce, although there really wasn't much of it under the huge pile of ingredients. I thought the onions were tasty, and the chicken was good at first... and then it started to taste dry. If I were to go back, I probably wouldn't order this, though it was kinda fun... which lends credence to my theory that at this place, it's moreso that the ridiculous size is the huge draw. This totally isn't the point of Yelp, but I did take all my leftovers home, and had it for dinner after adding spinach, kale, quinoa, chickpeas, and some of El Tepeyac's guacamole... and wow, I thought it tasted a lot better. But, personal preferences. Service today was great. We came in a large party of 11 at lunch and were seated outdoors, which I actually preferred to the inside. We were also treated to beer, tequila, or brandy! If I wasn't trying to be health-conscious, and it wasn't in the middle of a work day, I would have been tempted to imbibe...

My favorite restaurant, period. I've been coming here since I was born. I usually get the Manny's Special, all 8lbs of it. Glorious. If food was a woman, Manny's would be the most beautiful thing to ever grace the planet. I got to see Manny himself for the first time early this year. He gave me some tequila and was very friendly and chatted up my girlfriend (in a good way). He kicks ass. He's been running a badass joint forever.

This review is for take-out only. So I've lived about 5 min away from El Tepeyac my entire life, but the lines always kept me away. Thanks to yelp, I found that they have take-out, with it's seperate window around the corner! My next problem was this, El Tepeyac is known for it's huge meaty burritos, and I'm a vegetarian...but thanks to yelp once again, I found that they have a vegetarian burrito! That was it, nothing holding me back from El Tepeyac any longer...so off I went. It was a Saturday night, but it was raining, and there was still a line for people to be seated! Armed with my knowledge of the take-out window though, I confidently walked around the corner as if I had done this many times before (this is why I love yelp, never lets me look lost and foolish when going places for the first tme) There was a nice covered patio area with tables and a huge poster of the menu, but I already knew what I was ordering. I was greeted by a friendly young woman and ordered my vegetarian burrito. It came out to about $8. I took a seat and waited. No lie, my order was ready in less than 5 minutes, despite the fact that they were super busy. I couldn't wait to get home to see what the fuss was all about so as soon as I got in the car I opened up my box and was amazed at the size of my "burrito"! Let's just say it was BIG. and it smelled soooo delicious! The 5 min drive home seemed so long as I couldn't wait to try it. Well, about 1/4 into it, I realized I was stuffed! Beans, rice, guacamole, cheese, and some sort of tomato sauce were the perfect combination that made this burrito. My bf tried it and was also susprised by how good it was but couldn't finish it either. The next day, I had the leftovers for lunch and it was still great. I will definately be going back to el tepeyac, and probably try dining in.

My dad was super excited to bring me here for lunch. He has been eating here since he was in high school and he raved about how great it was. We arrived at a good time and there was barely anybody here, no wait. The waitress was very nice and attentive and helped us right away. I decided to get a burrito even though I knew there was no way I would finish it. I went with the Hollenbeck de Machaca - typical Machaca burrito, but also with rice, beans, and guacamole inside. My dad ordered a shredded beef enchilada and a cheese quesadilla. The food didn't take long to arrive. My burrito was massive, as big as my freakin head. It was delicious!! I ate half of it and took the other half home for my boyfriend. The meat was juicy and flavorful, the guacamole was fresh. Very, very good. My dad's enchilada tasted like it was made with Las Palmas sauce, which is good, but definitely not homemade. His quesadilla was really good, super cheesy and kind of burnt on the bottom. I love burnt cheese :) I ate one piece of that with the green salsa they give you. Very cheap meal, about $20 for lots of food and two drinks. I would definitely come here again.

The Hollenbeck burrito is quite the beast. 營 was sent here by Jonathan Gold and his "99 Things To Eat in LA Before You Die" list. 燙ame with a party of about 12, for dinner on a weeknight (so it wasn't too crowded). 燱e all pretty much got that burrito. 燗nd we all thought it was pretty mediocre. �This really is a Quantity over Quality type place. 燭he economics of a burrito that large make you understand that they can't be using great ingredients if they are selling it for that cheap. 燛verything stuffed inside of it reminded me of the burritos at Cafe 84 at USC when I was a freshman in 2003/2004. 燬o basically what I am saying is that this is a larger version of dorm food. If you are in the neighborhood, then sure stop by. 燘ut don't bother making a trek all the way out here from Silver Lake like I did. 燭here are far superior burritos around where you live.

We must've smelled like bacon, because Manny's first words to us were, "are you guys on duty?" 燱hen we told him we weren't, but his instincts were damned close, his next question was, "well, then, you want some margaritas, right?" 燱e politely and regretfully declined, but not before Manny sweet talked the females in our group. 燝uys, lock up your girlfriends and wives because Manny is a smooth operator and his place kicks out great food. I had the Hollenbeck carne asada burrito with cilantro and onions. 燭he waitress waivered when I ordered, and asked if it was just for me. 燱hen I answered in the affirmative, she just giggled, and told me okay. 燭hat's because this burrito was enough food for two people with regular appetites. 營t hit the spot nicely, and even though I didn't finish more than two thirds of it, I was in a food coma for a good two hours afterward. 燘efore we settled the bill, our playful waitress made sure to rub in the fact that she knew I wouldn't be able to finish the burrito, but was kind enough to package what was left of it for me to take home since she said she could tell I was one of those guys that needs a woman's help. 營 tell you, the people who run this place are sharp cookies. �-) As we were leaving, we walked past a guy who had ordered the Manny's Special burrito. 營 told you that I thought I had done alright by finishing most of my burrito, but, let me tell you, if that dude finished one quarter of the Manny's Special, I would've been owned. 燭hat burrito is almost the size of a football. 燦o joke. I was going to give the place four stars for the long wait and cramped quarters inside, but I think that Manny and our waitress deserve better. 燙heck it out the next time you're in East LA - just plan for some nap time afterward.

If you live in LA, check this place out FOR SURE. I had a road trip through Cali last October, and this place was a definite pit stop, after seeing it on Man Vs Food. 燨n television the portions looked huge and delicious -- and the owner seemed like a very nice guy. First attempt: We drove through east LA on a weekday night, and realized that we were near the restaurant. 燭he restaurant is in an area that looks a little sketch, particularly at nighttime, but that doesn't bother me. 營n fact, it probably adds to its appeal. �As I approach the restaurant, I notice a lone car parked in front of the restaurant. 營 pass by the car, and I hear "psst, hey man." 營 turn, and quickly try to remember all my very useful tae kwon do moves I learned when I was 11. 燣ucky him -- I didn't need them. He explains that the restaurant just closed, and that it will be open tomorrow morning. 燞e proceeds to tell me that if I come in the morning, before 12 I can meet the owner, Manuel. 燭hanks, random sketchy guy. Just the info I was looking for. Next Morning: The neighborhood looks a lot nicer in the LA sun and smog. 燱e approach the restaurant, and I notice the dark silhouette of an older man standing outside, enjoying the first rays of morning pollution. 營t's Manuel. I recognize Manuel, and when I say, "Hi Manuel" to him, he greets me as though I thought I just saw a family member I haven't seen in a while (ie, a positive response). 燞e wasn't fake at all. 燞e genuinely likes people. My friend and I talk to him for a bit, and after he realizes I'm visiting for my birthday he has us sit down at the counter in the front and gets us free shots, and later comes around and tells us we should drink more so he gives us some beer. 燞e stops by and checks on us throughout the meal to tell us interesting stories. We ate the hollenbeck burritos which were large, and I thought quite tasty as well. 燛veryone who works there is either family or close friends of the family. 燭he waitress came around later, after we were full, and forced us to eat some machaca (sp?). 營t was some type of beef/egg/cheese medley. 營t was so good, I cried. Overall: Everything contributed to this experience to make it perfect, but for me this was the best restaurant experience I have had to date. 燳our experience may be different, but at the very least, go to this restaurant and visit these people.

I could have killed my boyfriend for taking me here. 燭his is his favorite place, he swears by the 'hollenbeck' or something like that (which looked unnaturally juicy and disgusting). �First, I'm vegan. 燬o...there are not a lot of options for my particular choice of diet. 燬econd, after watching a stray dog run up and pee on the outside table area, I wouldn't have ate anything anyway. 燭hird, is this place even safe?! 營 was cat called and 'holler'd" at by the church go-ers across the street. 燬eriously. 燯gh.

Revisiting my roots is certainly not good for the waistline, but my tummy hasn't been happier! The decor and the ambiance has not changed over the years. If not mistaken, they have been open since 1955. This was THE place to go after football games and just because. This is truly a LA icon that has weathered and survived the bad times. Seated at the counter were the locals that frequent the place, in "Cheers" like fashion http://www.yelp.com/biz_� 爃ttp://www.yelp.com/biz_� Conversations about family and friends were our background noise. The task at hand of ordering was difficult for me and hubby. Mom was easy and she ordered the bacon and eggs $7.50 http://www.yelp.com/biz_� I finally decided on the Huevos con chorizo $7.50 nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/ZefFhlg3YlP2mG0Z6璚Vc0A?select=j2T3tHJkPBOQc8yzH16YHw and hubby decided on the chilaquiles $13.25 http://www.yelp.com/biz_� Interesting how they indicate on the menu that certain burritos feed 4 - 6 people, but absolutely no warning about their other items! Each of the plates included a massive amount of rice and beans and of the main item! Their flour tortillas were the size of a flying saucer! Mom did her best with her plate eating some of the rice and beans, 1 egg and half of the bacon. Quite impressed! I THOUGHT I could eat all of the huevos con chorizo, NOT! I cut the tortilla with my hands into pieces and scoop the chorizo with the tortilla. Since the tortilla is humongous, I was only able to eat half of my chorizo and a small minuscule taste of the rice and beans. 燤ight I add it was comfort food fit for my tummy... Not greasy, just sheer happiness. On to hubby's mondo plate of chilaquiles! 燬itting regally on a bigger plate was this massive amount of chilaquiles. It was quite daunting. His eyes widened and he started his attempt to make a dent. 營t was quite tasty with the scrambled eggs on top of the fried tortillas, chiles and massive amount of cheese. He ate around the perimeter and was able to whittle the 12" round of comfort food down to 11". 爇udos for his valiant effort. As we sat there wondering how we were able to do as well as we did, Manuel himself came in and greeted us at our table. 燞e shook hubby's hand, kissed Mom and me on our hands! Wow... Chivalry isn't dead and the gesture would make any woman swoon. He said he loves Nihongenes (Japanese). How the heck did he know? Impressed once again. He then asked my hubby if he wanted a brandy. Hubby loves brandy and after recovering from the initial shock, he accepted the kind gesture. His belly was quite happy! We kindly asked them to box our five pounds of leftovers and gladly paid the bill, and vowed to be back! Food - 5 Stars Service - 5 Stars Ambiance - 5 Stars - thanks for bringing back the memories of late night football game eating extravaganzas! And for Manuel's kindness. Anyone have any ideas for the leftovers?

Manuel's Tepeyac is an East L.A. classic! I've tried many items from the menu and there's never been a letdown. My favorite is the Huevos Rancheros plate for breakfast!

Been wanting to try out this place ever since I saw man vs food where Adam chowed down a 5 lbs burrito ... went on a Sunday around like 2pm waited in line outside to be seated for maybe like 15minutes and went I got inside i was shocked to see how small the place is. I ordered the carne asada burrito while my partner ordered the wet carne asada burrito . we ordered some chips and salsa also and I really enjoyed the chips it was fresh and the salsa was really good too ! when the burritos came, I was shocked to see how big it was ! their very generous w/ the guacamole on the side too ! when I took a bite of my burrito, I was immediately disappointed as to the quality of the carne asada was not not very good at all... you can just tell they did not use charcoal or grill it and they also didn't use ranchera meat whatever meat they use was chewy, hard and mostly fat it's so disgusting! I hate poor quality and tasting meat... my burrito was $9 and yea sure it was good value but I rather take quality over quantity any day ! my partner and I both agreed we rather have gone to chioptle and got a barbacoa burrito where we know the meat quality and taste is much better ! I had way better carne asada burrito from other mexican restaurants this place was a disappointment sorry to say !

Came in on a lovely Wed. at 11:00 am & this restaurant was already fully packed! Luckily, I had already called in to order, so there was no need for me to wait. I bought a carne asada hollenbeck burrito, split for 2, and it was more than enough for my brother and I. By far theeee best burrito that I've had in California, and I'm not from around here. The only ones I've tried before were: King Taco, Alfredos, & Albertos??? And they're all hmm...not as good as Manny's. Maybe it's because they add the guacamole inside the burrito that makes it all gooey and yummy? Since the texture wouldn't be as thick as beans? I don't know what it is exactly but it's a lot of goodness up in that burrito. I will definitely come back for more! :-)

Yep, gonna start this with... "I've been eating here since I was a kid." 營 still remember when the Hollenbecks were shy of $3. 燗 testament to how long I've been gorging myself here. 營 miss the window server with a very distinctive voice - c'mon y'all know who I'm writing about! 燘ut, I miss the flavor of the Hollenbeck from "back in the day" even more. �Met a couple of my old friends from Evergreen Elementary and Hollenbeck Junior High the other day for lunch, and was anxiously awaiting to sink "los dientes" into a savory Hollenbeck. 燱TH, the chile verde was tomatoey and there was too much of the chewy meat! 燝ranted, the meat has always been somewhat chewy, but in small quantities I was able get it down. 燗nd, they forgot my lechuga y tomates a lado!!! One buddy ordered a Hollenbeck w/ Machaca and was very disappointed in the lack of eggs, onions, jalapenos, and flavor. 燤ostly dry shredded beef. 燞e said that the last few times he's been here, the quality has been on the decline. 燞owever, that did not stop him from devouring the entire burro! My other buddy ordered the Hollenbeck and seemed to think it tasted the same. 燬orry dude, I think you left your tastebuds behind when you departed "da hood." Perhaps, Manuel should exercise a little QC on his menu items and bring back the wonderful flavors from my memories. �On a side note, enjoyed my ghetto soda de fresa y chile roja con chips - glad to see some things haven't changed.

All I will say is Hollenbeck burrito! It is huge and flavorful. The beef is so damn tender. Definitely a knife & fork burrito which can be shared by 2 to 3 people. This place is small, holds no more then about 15 people. A lot of people just order takeout on the side because I heard this place can get super busy. I went on a week day around 11am so it wasn't to bad. My coworker and I went as she had been bragging about their burritos And oh boy she was not lying ! Customer service was excellent.

Was greeted by the infamous Manuel who was working the floor by greeting patrons and leading them to their table. I was really excited to try this establishment after seeing it on Man vs. Food. Decided to try this place for some post-race grub (LA Rock N Roll). I wasn't in the mood for the 5-lb burrito. I was actually looking for my usual Cali burrito, but was bummed that I didn't see it. I opted to order the carne asada burrito ($9.25). It was noted that it would take about 15 mins for the order to come out. I was ok to wait for deliciousness. Less than 5 mins later, my order came out. It was massive!!! When I took one bite of the carne asada, I was disappointed! The carne was dry, hard, and tasteless. Did I place the wrong order??? I finished about a quarter of the burrito and took the rest home. The chips were good and crisp ($1.75), however, the salsa was too spicy for my liking. The service was prompt and friendly and I got to talking to Manuel. We even took a picture together! What a sweet old man!!! There is a parking lot next to the restaurant with street parking available in the neighborhood. The restaurant is small, and can only hold about 40 patrons. Be prepared to wait if you decide to come on a weekend.

Manuel's Special ($20) can feed 3 really, really hungry people to the point of "OMG, I can't eat any more" or 4 people to the "satiated, just right" level. Or, it can also feed 1 person to the point of explosion. (When I was here on Saturday night, two guys ordered one each!) On the menu, it says carne asada will take an extra 15 minutes, but we didn't wait any longer than if we'd ordered a different meat. The chips here are thick and crunchy. I didn't really like the salsa (too much chipotle?) but the verde was good. Sides of guacamole are HUGE.

I've been visiting College BFF (CBFF) in Eess El Ley for a decade; I hate that I'm just now discovering El Tepeyac. The bottom line is--if you top my nachos with a heaping helping of chunky guac & use thick, non-greasy tortilla chips--you get five stars. The shredded white meat chicken was a bonus & I can even forgive the ungodly blanket of cheddar cheese because it was easily pushed aside (can we say instant artery clogger?!) $9.95 for a portion that fed three. The rest of our order was equally gigantic & equally five-star worthy. My cousin & I shared a two taquito plate ($7.50, again, with generous scoops of guac); shredded beef for her & shredded chicken for me. The bf ordered a Carne asada burrito called a Hollenbeck ($9.55, no idea where the name came from.) El Tepeyec has its own parking lot, a cozy, comfy dining area & quick (but not always accurate) service. As if the CBFF wasn't reason enough to visit this part of LA, now I've got a nacho joint to look forward to. And you know how much I love nachos...if you don't know, check my ample nachos list (now you know beybeh beybeh uhh.)

After eating at Manuel's for over 15 years, I am sad to say that I most likely will not be returning. Over the past few years, I have been gradually getting annoyed with the exponentially rising prices; but since I still craved their addictive huevos rancheros, once in a while I would break down and eat there. However, over the past year I've noticed that the flavors just aren't the same any longer. Last Saturday, during Memorial Day weekend, I took my in-laws there, and we all agreed that the food just didn't taste the same as we remembered it, and it no longer warranted the absurdly high price of $8.50 for eggs with salsa on top. The machaca was flavorless and bland, and they even forgot my husband's order. I think many other long-time customers agree with me because I've been there twice in the past four months, and both times there was no line on a Saturday! Usually there would be a line out the door every weekend, but such is not the case any longer. I gave the place an extra star for nostalgia, since Manuel's is an institution, but honestly, I'd rather frequent the million other LA Mexican restaurants that serve huevos rancheros for half the price, or my husband can just make it at home. I'm sad to see an institution like Manuel's go down like this, and maybe I will still be back once in a great while for old-time's sake, however, I'm sorry to admit that it just isn't the same any more.

I lost some respect for my fellow Yelpers on this one. It's not as if this place was really bad, but with over 700 reviews and an average of 4 stars, I expected a whole lot more. I hate leaving a bad review when everybody there was so nice, but I gotta keep it real for the sake of my Yelpers. Like I said, the service was great. The people were super nice and friendly. However, the food was less than okay. We ordered the Chili Verde burrito and Taquitos, which we were told was their specialty. Yeah, the servings are huge, but the meat for both the burrito and taquitos was really dry and hard. The sauce for the Chili Verde was nothing special. In all honesty, it tasted like a simple canned tomato sauce. They do give you a generous amount of guacamole, but it didn't make up for how bad the meat was. So, if you're really all about the size of the burrito, then this place is cool, but 燼 giant plate of crap, is still just a plate of crap at end of the day. I honestly would have given them just 2 stars based on the food alone, but gave them an extra one because they were so friendly and nice.

I read the reviews... well I saw the ratings on Yelp and decided I need to check this place out. 營 wouldn't say I was disappointed, but I don't think it lived up to it's hype. Whenever I can, I like to try new Mexican places. 營'm on the hunt for the perfect carne asada. 燭hat is how I gauge any Mexican restaurant. 營f you cannot make me good Carne Asada, then I will most likely not be coming back. I ordered two dishes, the Hollenbeck Carne Asada burrito (at the suggestion of the cashier) and Carne Asada Nachos, which is sort of my litmus test for whether or not a place makes good carne asada. First the Nachos: The steak itself was kind of dry, which I was not a fan of. 營t was also sort of bland. 燭he way they do their nachos there is kind of plain. 營t comes only with guacamole and sour cream, no cilantro or pico de gallo. 燗lso the texture of the chips they use bothered me. 燭hey weren't stale exactly, but they were not crisp. As for the Hollenbeck Burrito: 燭his one I liked a little better, but again the steak was not that great. 燭he mixture of rice and peppers and what not inside the burrito made it a little better than it's nacho counterpart. �I will say this of both dishes. 燭hey are BIG. 燭hough I guess for $10 each, they'd better be. 燱hen I go on an eating binge, I usually eat a LOT, like a large pizza at a time. 燱hich is part of the reason I ordered two dishes. 營 ate them for 3 meals that day and still have leftovers. 燳ou definitely get your value that way. �I don't know, maybe I should've tried different dishes, but I was unimpressed with Manuel's. 營t was not bad by any means, but after all the hype it received, I expected it to wow me a little more. 燤y search continues for a carne asada that will eventually dethrone the current King in my book, Chano's Drive Inn on 30th and Figueroa.

This place is the real deal. 營f you want good, authentic LA-style mexican food, huge portions, and not looking to spend a lot, you cannot get any better than this. 燭here might be a wait, and you might feel rushed or cramped in their tiny, East LA dining room, but if you're willing to put these small inconveniences aside for a burrito like no other, then El Tepeyac is worth the trip. The only thing that's truly worth ordering off the menu is the Original Hollenbeck Burrito, but get it with pork. 營 got mine with shredded beef, which was really good nonetheless, but was blindsided by the promise of accompanying ingredients (e.g. cheese, guacamole, jalape駉s, eggs) to complement the beef. 燭he pork burrito in comparison looked way more delicious and had larger chunks of the meat inside instead of scattered out and around the meal. But you really can't go wrong with anything here. 燡ust expect large portions and a doggy back to take back the half of your burrito that you end up not eating. 燗nd if you come here on a good day in the middle of the week: a line to get in.

This place is great for groups, and the food is massive. 燳es the "Regular burrito" is 9 dollars, but it feeds 2 to 3 people. 燭he portion sizes are massive for all their orders, and I have always enjoyed the taste of all their meats! 燳ou cannot go wrong! 營t has gotten busier but that's because of its popularity. 營t was always this packed even before Man vs Food. Go check it out with your friends and make sure you are prepared to eat a Thanksgiving Mexican Meal!

Just because this was featured on Man vs Food it doesn't mean that is good! Mediocre Mexican-American food! Huge servings! Decent prices! Meat was hard, dry, and too salty. 燭he rice was too salty. 燭he chips had salt grains all over. 燬alt! Salt!

Went to El Tepeyac for the first time in over a year last night. 營 was happy to see there was a new menu board at the take out window. 營t was easy to read and find what you are looking for. 營 was however a bit disappointed to find the prices had gone up across the board. We ordered a Manuel's Burrito with machata for the family to share. 燱hen we got it, it seemed to be smaller than it use to be. 燬ince we had to drive back to Inland Empire, we didn't break into it for another hour. 燗s soon as we got home we opened up and dug right in. 燭he flavor was fantastic as usual but as suspected, the burrito was smaller. �Now I know if I want to feed my HUGE family of 11, I need to buy 2 of them but at almost $25.00 a piece, it's not going to happen anytime soon or very often.

Saturday afternoon spent with two of the biggest burritos in the world (with 5 other dudes)! The 6 of us ordered two Special burritos (Steak Picada and Chile Verde) and sodas/horchatas. 燩rice is definitely affordable since it came out to about $60. �The food was mediocre. 燭he size of the thing is amazing and even while you're eating it, it's heftier than it looks. 燭hey drench the burritos in sauce and cheese and extra chunks of meat. 燘ut I feel like the size of the thing works against it. 燭he flavor was okay at best. 營've had wet burritos that were more flavorful. 燘ut overall, the burrito is still delicious and easily fills you up. I'd give this place 4 stars but the waitress was .... not nice. 營 specifically asked the lady behind the counter for a receipt because the meal was going to get comped, and she happily said they always give receipts. 燭hen the waitress comes and tells me to sit down at the table in a snappy tone so she could help us. 營 didn't even know they have waitresses at the outside tables. 燭hen the waitress took my receipt and ended up losing it. 燬he tried to lie by saying that they don't give receipts. 燙ome on now.... ruined a perfectly good trip to Manny's....

After hearing so many positive things about El Tepeyac, I was excited to try it out, and I was very hungry. So my friends and I got there and waited in line for about 30 minutes. Once 爄nside we were shocked at how small it was. I asked for chips and salsa and had no idea that they charge 3.50 for an order. That is ridiculous. I've never been to a Mexican restaurant where they charge for chips and salsa, that is usually complimentary. My bf and I ordered the chile verde burrito to share but ended up getting a burrito with red sauce instead of green. It was good, but not great. I definitely recommend ordering the guacamole on the side because there was a disgusting amount of it inside our burrito. So much to the point that it overpowers the taste of anything else. The burrito was large enough for us to share and both be satisfied. My friend asked if there was any hot sauce such as Tapatio or anything but surprisingly, they didn't carry any hot sauce! So make sure to bring your own. The service was awful. Our server took forever to bring everything. Once she brought the food, she never came around once to check on us. We had to flag her down to ask for refills. Then once we were all done, my friends asked for a small box to go it took about 15 minutes to get that, then she never came back with the check. We had to flag her down once again. Overall, the food was OK. I've definitely had way better burritos. I think this place is overrated. Don't buy into all the hype.

If you want a REAL MEXICAN burrito... you HAVE TO come HERE!!! I've been coming here since I was a little girl with my parents. Never left unsatisfied. This place is soo small and has not changed since I can remember. Friendly staff. Come with a big appetite. I order the chile rellenos and I took the rest for left overs. The waitress made my left overs into a burrito. :) So i had a burrito for left overs the next day. :))

Split the Hollenbeck with Carne Asada. Good amount for two, but way too much for one. The meat was honestly kinda greasy, but the peppers made up for it! Definitely a dive and definitely out of the way but a fun LA experience none-the-less. And, you won't walk away hungry.

How can you not fall in love with a little, old man that offers you a shot of tequila right when you sit down? Manny you are so adorable I just want to put you in my pocket!! I couldn't turn him down and that's how my experience at El Tepeyac started. Shots shots shots! I got the Steak Picado burrito and it was so good. The steak was so tender and the sauce was amazing. The thing was massive and I could barely gobble down half. The only bad thing I can say is that I felt like crap after. Food coma like a mofo. I knocked out in the car and could definitely feel my heart slow and blood thicken from all the unhealthy food I consumed. There's no way you can eat anything after. Despite the near heart attack, I do want to come back and try something other than a burrito. I wonder how Manny stays so thin with the food he serves...

I came here with my family one day and it was PACKED as usual! If you're ever planning on coming here, don't expect a 5-10 min wait cause the norm here is approximately 20-30 mins on a GOOD day! El Tepeyac was one of the restaurants featured in Man V. Food, and as a result has gained a reputation for its ginormous portions of food! The best option I recommend is that you order take out! There's a separate line for "dine-in" and another line around the corner for "take out." The take out line is a lot faster and it's a lot more efficient especially if you're always on the go like myself! But let's get to the food. The portions here are HUGE and the prices are decent for the amount of food that you are getting. The people who work here are very generous and they are so friendly that they even let you sample some of their wide array of meats so that you can have a better "feel" on what you would want. I would highly recommend trying their Hollenbeck Carne Asada burrito though! It is jam packed with succulent pieces of Carne Asada steak, with fresh pico de verde, onions, salsa, and fresh guacamole! It was so delicious! You should also try the Manuel Special but be warned because this is ONE HUGE BURRITO! It literally fed 4 grown adults and 2 kids and there was even a little bit leftover afterwards! Everything about the food here is great. The meat is nice and juicy, the salsas are fresh and there isn't a better place in East LA where you can get quality style burritos with these kind of portions! It's definitely a MUST TRY for any fan of Mexican food hands down!

This restaurant was amazing. The servers were friendly, the draft was cheap enough for the pitchers, happy hour is great, and the atmosphere is friendly for family and friends. The Hollenbeck burrito is amazing in that it's gigantic for ten dollars. It doesn't get better for the price. I tried to eat it all to myself, and simply couldn't. I should have split it with one other person on the table. The only reason that I gave it a four star instead of a five is that the carnitas wasn't as flavorful as I wanted. By no means was it bad, I've just had better.

If it's on TV, of course everyone will flock there... Including me. A buddy of mine was visiting me in LA, and we were watching Man vs. Food: Los Angeles. Being a 'Barney Stinson', he of course proclaimed "CHALLENGE ACCEPTED!", and we headed out to try the Manuel Special. We decided to eat outside, where the line was minimal rather than to wait for a table inside. The line moved quickly, and a couple minutes later we were at the window to order our gargantuan burrito. Each of us ordered one, as my buddy was not willing to share. He was determined to eat that burrito himself. When asked how many plates I would be needing, I scoffed and went "PLATES?!". The lady gave me a "You can't hang.." sort of look, and proceeded to ring up my order. It took a little while for our food to be ready, but we expected that, considering how busy the place was inside, and the quantity of animals they would have to slaughter to fill that burrito. When we got our food, it was shocking to see the burrito up close. I knew this would be a self-imposed challenge even my buddy couldn't win, and I think he knew it too. The burrito was delicious, the perfect ratio of meat to fillings, and I very quickly was defeated. It was a good defeat, as I was satisfied in my choice to get the mainstream burrito. I wish now that I had ordered something that wasn't featured on a "how to get fat quick" TV show, and rather tried something else, but... live and learn. Just means that I will be going back again. The embarrassing part was going back to the window to ask the same lady for a box, at which she laughed at me and I sauntered back to my table with my tail between my legs. P.S. My buddy couldn't hang either..Challenge failed...

My soul cries every time I hear someone trash this place because it's not "authentic" or because "for Mexican food in LA, it sucks." I mean, even if those are true (an opinion that likely changes from person to person,) I don't really understand how at this stage in the game, people don't know what they're getting here. El Tepeyac is not about being on the cutting edge of Mexican food, or even really about being the best burrito in LA. It's about the atmosphere, the family feeling, the serving of Mexican comfort food (if you will) to the community, and of course, some damn huge portions that will feed one person several meals or a family of four all at once. Now, I'm not Mexican, so maybe I should shut my mouth, but really, there isn't a lot to not like here. I've been a lot, and sometimes the quality has been inconsistent, but never so much so that I wouldn't go back. I think people may hear all the hype about this place, and if it's not THE BEST THING EVER they are exceptionally disappointed. I feel that if people went to El Tep not expecting the Biblical experience that Adam Richman made it out to be on Man vs. Food (sorry Adam, but I do think you kind of oversold your performance a bit,) their expectations would be much more in line with what El Tepeyac is actually serving -- above average, but not stellar, Mexican food, and LOTS of it. Who can really argue with that?

I've been coming here with my parents since I was a kid. As I got older, the burritos got smaller. Nonetheless, I still can't finish a burrito by myself. My favorite is the machaca burrito, which I always share. It's full of shredded meat, beans, it's cheesy and delicious. Sometimes it comes with a salad, sometimes it doesn't. I don't understand why the cooks aren't consistent. I will be honest, I have not tried much else on the menu but I believe you can't really go wrong. The food is ready fairly quickly which is a bonus considering that this place is ALWAYS busy. Chips and salsa are not free, regardless of whether you eat in or take the food to go. That's REALLY lame. I went today and our waitress was kinda nice but at the same time made you feel like you were inconveniencing her by asking for....water. Yeah water. The food was delicious, but the experience could've been more pleasant. �Overall this place has good food at somewhat decent prices. But like my sister said today, it is overrated...just a bit. I will admit however, that my experience was soured because of the customer service INDOORS. The food itself is delicious and I realize that is what people want. PS. I really wish the people who live next door would sell their house. That way the restaurant could expand and perhaps improve the eat in experience.

Me & the Mrs shared the Original (with pork) along with a single chicken taco + guacamole & chips. Everything delicious. Great food. HUGE portions! Very nice service. There's not much to this place I can share, which hasn't already been shared on the Travel Channel. (Thanks Adam). The place is exactly as advertised. It's small and quests need to wait outside, but that wasn't an issue for us. We actually met Manuel briefly.. he seems just as eccentric as I'd have expected. If you'd like to mark this off your 'Foodie' check-list, you can do it pretty cheaply and in-out pretty quick (all things considered). It's worth the revisit if you have out of town guests.... ALTHOUGH - the food wasn't beyond this world spectacular and not any different than the majority of other 'quality' Mexican restaurants in the LA area. Enjoy!

I first came here in the 70's and was pleasantly surprised and enjoyed my time there. Known for the Manuel's Special, gigantic burrito. Not much has changed. I haven't been here in a long time. The majority of their burritos are extra large and made to be shared by several people. I offered a suggestion for them to make a single person version of the various burritos for people that don't want or need the extra sized burrito. That would work well for them and give them added business but I have yet to see it. Their burritos have more beans than necessary and less of the other ingredients. They don't give you chips and salsa like other places with your order, not good. I hoped they would have progressed and made things better in time.

This place is great. It is a real L.A. institution. There was a line out of the door, but the wait wasn't that long. Everyone was friendly and we had great conversations. Some people might get scuuurred because of the different types of people, and it is in East Los, but to me these are normal people. I had the Hollenbeck de pollo, and my fiancee had the Hollenbeck de carnitas. I found the chicken to be tender and flavorful. This burrito lasted me 2.5 meals, and I am a big eater. My fiancee loved the carnitas, she said it was tender and tasty. Since I don't eat pork, I can't tell you. The chips were fresh, and I loved the salsa. If your cooooollll, Manny himself will give you a shot or two.... or three or four of tequila.

Authentic, historic, and deliciously large portions! The location is amongst residences, across the street from a church. It looks like this was a home that has since evolved into a restaurant. The seating is cramped with some bar stool seating and a few tables scattered around an older jukebox. The kitchen sits between a walk up window for to go orders and the dining section. If you go to dine expect to wait. With plenty of family photos this places gives you a homey feeling. The food is excellent. I would not say it's the best Mexican cuisine I have ever tasted but it's very fresh and comes in large portions. Every menu item is delicious so you can try anything with confidence. If you have a party you can share their famous Manuel's Special or go it alone and earn yourself a t-shirt if you finish. The red salsa is particularly addicting with a unique heat that will keep your mouth watering for more. The chorizo breakfast burrito is hands down the best I have ever had. With your usual selection of coffee, juices, and Pepsi branded soft drinks they also offer horchata. The service is exceptionally friendly and the food is prepared in a timely manner, even when very busy. They have accommodated large orders on game day with ease. Overall this place is a must try if you are an Angelino.

So one of my co-workers made me a list of Mexican places to try, and this was on the list. He seems like he knows what's up, so I decided to hit 爑p one of them, and that one happened to be Manuel's Original El Tepeyac Cafe. I phoned in an order for a Hollenbeck carne asada burrito, and picked it up on my way to work. The parking lot was packed, but there happened to be one last spot, so I parked in between some nice big black sedans. I could feel people watching as this Asian girl hopped out, passed a line of people waiting to get in, picked up her food, and drove off. Considering how popular this place seems, the restaurant is a little small, but it feels pretty homey, and the staff were really nice! All smiles and one worker opened the door for me when I entered and left. The burrito itself is gigantic! All my co-workers who passed by literally said "WOAH. You eating all that?" No, it was way too big for me, but it was delicious! Packed with meat and beans and rice and a ton of avocados in their guac! Talk about generous! And all for about $10. If that doesn't fill you up, go for their 5 lb burrito special. Pero tu eres loco if you can finish that!

You know that saying "Bigger is always better" in this case Manuel has made it his passion to surprise and make many people fans for his burritos. In no way do I come here and get a large burrito all by myself but they are delicious and very tasty! I like how much meat is packed into each one and the right amount of flavor is put in it! This place is tiny but I felt like I was actually in someones home sitting on a kitchen table. I really enjoyed that and having this experience. It makes me so happy that a small business is doing great and yes it is really good! I have tried both my friends burritos that they each ordered and boy they were awesome. I know some people like to have it by themselves but I just wouldn't be able to even get a 1/4 of it down. I like how fast the service went and the food came to us in a matter of minutes. If you are looking for a giant burrito with loads of flavor this is the place to come and check out! :) Manuel might be inside cooking up a storm or greeting customers soo check him out.

Manuel's wow thats an original! ..... thats the only place we wanted to go after playing little league down the street! As kids we would order the Hollenbeck or the Manuel's special burrito. The lines were always too long so we usually ordered to go! Each burrito was large enough to feed my family and a friend or two! This is an old school classic Mexican American place with a lot of history. Just like anything else there are now new and better tasting restaurants. Back in the day this was "the place", 燼nd I still get cravings for those 爀xtra large sized meals ! 燭hey even used to offer a free burrito if you could eat the "Manuel's Special" 爄n one sitting. (do they still offer that? and why would you ever want any more after that?? haha ) The flavors do tend to taste kinda the same, but the taquitos with fresh guacamole as well as the tacos are always a hit. If you try a burrito, know that its is a little more about "mass quantity" 爐han best flavor! However its still really really good. Compare it to a Tommy's chili burger".... there are many better hamburger places now..... but sometimes you just gotta have it!! 燨n a side note I was having breakfast at the counter, and a man who seemed to be the owner came over and started talking to me. He seemed 爐o have had one too many cervesas (one in hand) � but he wanted to "thank you people" for the support over the years!!?? Well I can only imagine all the Japanese baseball leagues and Japanese Buddhist temples (Mexican and Japanese lived together for many years in Boyle Heights ) that had many a catered event from this classic eatery. Well I said to him ( representing all Japanese Americans feelings i'm sure! haha ) We have been coming here for years, we love coming here, and the feeling is quite mutual!...... thank you!

I saw this place randomly when I was chanel surfing and landed on the show "Man Vs Food" on the travel chanel. The episode is all about places in Los Angeles. As I was watching, I saw this place and their Manuel's special (their 5 pound buritto)!!!! Their food in general looked amazing. And the owner, Manuel, look like a major flirt but super sweet because he greeted you with a shot of tequilla! Cant ask for anything else. So I grabbed my girlfriend, and we went on a mission to this place! When we arrived, let me say the neighborhood wasnt super clean but i expected that. The owner wasnt there but we did get our shots! Yum! And my girlfriend and I ordered their special. Yes, it was 5 pounds but at $18 it was a bargain. We were stuffed, and couldnt move. Everyone was super friendly. The place itself was tiny, but had many tables, which was all filled. What do you expect from a random LA eatery?! The place was clean, but needed someone to just clean the tables because the empty ones were dirty. At the end, on the way out, we ordered another one of this massive buritto because we had to have our family try this...or have it be our lunch for the next day LOL. All in all, if you are in the area and want an amazing low key experiance then I would stop by.

Shredded beef taco was OK, nothing special. Carne asada burrito was filled mostly with rice, the carne asada was bland and in short supply. Toward the end of the burrito I found chunks of avocado, but it would have been nice to have it throughout the rest as it was pretty dry. Not sure if I was just there on an off day, but I won't try here again. Service at side window was prompt, polite and helpful. Very expensive, $28 for 2 burritos and a taco.

Went there for the first time last week! Small,little restaurant with a sit down bar.Came there around 1:30 in the afternoon and it wasn't crowded, so we got seated right away. Looked at the menus, but we knew what we were there for already. I wanted to try to eat that Manuel's Special Burrito! Wasn't sure how big it was 'til they brought one out for a family of 5 to share. Kinda looked doable at that point. I started getting excited about getting mine, so we ordered it, along with a taco apiece as our feast. Cameras came out of nowhere and everyone was taking pictures of the next tables' burrito. I swear not 5 minutes later, out came our dinner. I marvelled at the sped at which I got my food! So, there it is in front of me, so, naturally, I gotta break out my camera to record this mega event. It was huge and covered with more pork and cheese sauce. Looked like a postcard! Then, the tacos were the hard shell type stuffed with real steak, lettuce, and cheese like you wouldn't believe! Picture time again! Wow, we thought as we studied the humongous pile of guacamole there! Never got that much anywhere ever before! As I picked up the burrito plate to test the weight of that thing, I immediately knew there was no freaking way I was gonna be able to do it! The waitress, Little Mary, 爓ho was all of four feet something, said it's 5 1/2 lbs. It felt like 8 to me! And the separate guoc was like 1/2 lb. too. Got a couple kinds of salsas and was ready to dig in. The taco was incredible, one of the best I've ever had! By the time we finished eating all we could, there was more than half a burrito left and figured my daughter at home might want some! Our fantastic and caring waitress packaged everything up and it STILL was really heavy! Man! It was so reasonable price-wise too-only $30 and change! I was so happy with the experience I gave Mary a $10 tip! She was a sweetheart, and we thoroughly enjoyed everything! Can't wait to come back and try something else! Outrageously recommended by me, you gotta check this out!

So I love the whole East Los culture, so I had to come here to try one of their huge ass famous burritos. 25 bux and it feed "2-4" people. More like 4-6! It was huge! Yes the Manuels Special carne asada wet burrito was good, but!...I prefer King Tacos wet burrito in the Maywood location. The meat just didn't taste like asada, it just tasted like regular meat. Don't be discouraged, I would still go back but I would get something else instead. I'll update when I go back and try something else!

Just another LA Institution to add to my list of reviews. 燗gain, I will keep these short and sweet to minimize the obvious. Manuel's is a special place, especially if Manuel is there pouring out shots of Presidente into your coffee cup in the morning. 燭hat'll make your breakfast extra special! The first time I came here a while back, I was sitting at the counter with my brother when I learned of the Hollenbeck and Manuel Burritos. 營 ate a whole lot more back then and didn't blink an eye at the calorie count because it didn't stick around. 燨h how I miss the metabolism of yesteryear. 燗nyway, I didn't even want to try it back then even though I could probably put a pretty good dent in the Manuel's if I really tried. �So while eating my regular burrito, this older lady comes and sits next to me at the counter and was an obvious first timer like me (very starry eyed and kinda wandering around). 燬he ended up next to me and was asking the waitress all kinds of questions that I don't remember what they pertained to. 燭he one I remember was when she asked what the Manuel's special was and the waitress said in broken english a lot of descriptive words about the burrito but the one that caught the customer's ear was the word FREE. 燬o the lady ordered it thinking she will get a free burrito if she finishes it even though I know for a fact that she didn't really understand the description of the burrito. 營 couldn't wait for that burrito to come out. �When the waitress brought out the Manuel's special, the customer's eyes popped out and she looked for a moment that she didn't believe she had ordered what was in front of her. 燭hat burrito was spilling over the sides of the plate and was just massive. 營've never seen anything like it. 燬he then backed away and said to the waitress that she didn't think it would be that big. 營 laughed out loud because it was funny, period. 燭hen she did what I felt deep down inside someone like her would do. 燬he sent it back and said she didn't want it because she didn't want to pay for it. 燱hat a *#&%*@! �She instead got the Hollenbeck and ended up eating half of it and taking the rest home. 燗ll the cooks were giving her the stink-eye after that so I think she got a booger or 2 in her Hollenbeck. 爃aha. Jk. �Anyway, I thought it was a funny story. Go to Manuel's, the original location and enjoy the atmosphere. 燱hat have you got to lose? 燗s a consolation, if it's too busy, you can go to Ciro's across the street and enjoy their food because it rocks over there as well!

In my town there is nothing but cookie cutter Mexican food places that are worthless and not even worth an honorable mention. But if I go to my grandmother's 爏tomping ground where she was a crazy and wild young woman cruising Brooklyn Avenue looking for men who looked like Desi Arnaz, I would have Manuel's El Tepeyac to eat. El Tepeyac will forever remind me of my grandmother and all her stories about Manuel and El Tepeyac that goes back many many years. Hi Grandma! Anyways, I love to hear her stories and it makes me like the restaurant even more. OK back to the food. It's the best Mexican food you can find. The best I have ever eaten. I love the Hollenbeck with cheese (yes, it comes with cheese and this is the way you should order it). It is glorious and the guacamole along with the meat and ranchero sauce is delicious. I love the food--my mom ate nothing but El Tepeyac when I was in her stomach so I am forever doomed to love it hahaha. When I went the other day with my dog friend LUCY aka LUCIA, Tracy the outside waitress was just about the nicest waitress I have ever come across. She is so good to everyone (even the cholos) and deserves an honorable mention.

El Tepeyac? More like, El Tepeyuck. Overrated, over-sized burritos. I tried chicken, steak and pork. All the meat was dry, and the sauce for the okie style was not appetizing. A friend threw up after lunch and another threw away half a Manuel Special because of the dry meat and lack of taste. This restaurant is for those seeking quantity and not quality.

After a meeting this Friday afternoon on the Eastside my friend and I stopped at El Tepeyac Cafe because there was a small line. Long lines kept me from sampling in the past so I took advantage today. Our lunch included: A side of guacamole and chips. The guacamole was flavored with fresh avocado, onion and cilantro layered on a basket of their deliciously-greasy-crunchy chips. The Manuel Special - this ginormous burrito is a beast. Inside included beans, rice, carne asada, guacamole, and cheese. On top, mounds of chili sauce and cheese. Seriously, the burrito is the size of Lebron James's forehead (that's big!) Trying to eat this thing in a car is ridiculous. WTH was I thinking?? You cannot pick it up so that meant knife and forking it. The flavor of this large burrito was good - not bland like some of the reviewers noted...messy, but good. �Trying not to look like a pig in front of my friend, I only finished half of the thing. 燬till a feat if you ask me. My friend is from the area and shared her usual enchilada plate. The red sauce over the enchiladas was tasty and not watered-down. It had a strong, dark chili taste to it that I liked. The depth of flavors the sauce had was quite refreshing. Underneath all that sauce and cheese were huge chunks of beef - tender and moist. I enjoyed my first visit to El Tepeyac Cafe, the food is good but nothing stellar except the portions. The owner's personality alone earns them high marks - over 50 years in business says a lot.

Split the Manuel's Special with two others and destroyed it. We had to get the guac on the side because it will kill me. I wasn't really paying attention to the taste. It was good enough. I was just trying to see if I could do the challenge, so I was concentrating on pace and being a fat ass. I had about half of it and I felt good. I think next time, I'm going to try the challenge if they'll let me sub something for gauc, on account of it killing me and all. The place is tiny so be prepared to wait.

The Hollenbeck is superior to the Okie burrito. Lettuce in a burrito is just wrong. I thought the guacamole would be enough for me not to notice , but no. Take home your leftovers and feed a family of four. Special thanks to Tracy who waited on us on the patio where my dog not only was welcomed but received a water dish, cuddles, attention and a little asada. Two paws up!!!

Ive been coming to Manuels El Tepeyac for over 20 years. Unfortunately, ive decided to stop going there since the prices are now too expensive. My wife and I were yhere last week and the bill for 1 cup of coffee, taquito plate, and machaca plate came out to 32.00 without tip. The Machaca itself tasted very bland, normally I usually order the okie burrito which is fantastic. Very Sad :(

So for a while my friends from Pasadena wanted to try some authentic mexican food north of the country itself. So being from east LA i though of El Tepeyac. Suprisingly i had never been there so i was actually looking forward to it just as much as they were. I think we went on a Sunday evening. Being a popular place of course there was a line but 爋nly waited 15-20 min(not too shabby). We ordered the massive burrito everyone talks about and let me tell you: that's one BIG burrito. Despite the size it was really good, cooked just right and the seasonings/herbs were on point. I definately recommend this place. The price was reasonable and the service was good. The only setback is how small the place is. We were a group of 8 and were crammed in the corner. I wish they expanded the place but chances are is "what you see is what you get". I do suggest you get there early on wknd's since chances are you'll be waiting outside for a while. Enjoy the food and my backyard known as East LA!

So i ventured to this place only because i wanted to be greeted with a shot and have really good Mexican food... double negative I had the Carne Asada Hollenbeck beans, rice, sauce, guac, and was mildly enthused about the flavor... it was bland and lack pop My friend had the chiliquiles and these were enormous and bland as well...basically the first time I've ever seen him put salt on anything. I did order the chips and guac- and those were d lish! nice and salty and greasy and the guac was filled with flavor and the cilantro hint was perfect. Our service was not friendly when we sat at the bar top it was like pulling teeth or flaggin someone down, the ladies were almost pissed we were there eating. I had the horchata which was watered down and not enough cinnamon in it to give it that zing. As we sit the gentleman which look like Manuel's son was hugging all over the waitresses and well never said i once to us. I was disappointed in this whole experience, i don't know if I would be back to try something different.

I like the food if they serve you what you ordered. Usually it's wrong. Toss a coin. Either the place is great, or it really sucks. Service can be slow and indifferent. Sometime really good and fast. If Manual himself takes the order expect it to be 100% wrong.

Ok...so after watching Man v Food, I needed to put this on my list as well to try. I sure as hell wasn't going to attempt the challenge, but was going to try one of their famed burritos. First, driving through East LA...my husband said - "Where the hell is this restaurant? We're in East LA!" 營 didn't know where I was going, I was just going where Adam Rich ate! When we got there, there was a line waiting outside for inside dining. 營 told my brother-in-law to peek around the corner because I saw several people going in and out there with bags...and yup - there was a take out window where you can choose to eat in the back patio or take your food to go. The menu was exactly the same! I needed to know the difference between hollenback and okie style burritos. 燨kie was apparently red sauce, and the hollenback was green chile. 燬o you choose your prefrence. I ordered a regular burrito which was still enormous! 燤y husband and I shared the okie machacha (tender shredded and flavorful beef). 營've never seen a burrito so loaded with meat. 營 almost didn't see my rice and other stuff inside because it was so full of meat. 燱e both barely finished the burrito because it was so big...I can't imagine the size of the manual's special! My sister ordered the beef stew burrito that again, had chucks of savory and tender beef. 燤y son had the carne asada, my brother-in-law had the chicken okie (but his chicken was a little bland). In addition,we shared a small order or menudo that was so delicious. This is a must for mexican food in LA. 燳ou have to try it...and see it to believe it. 燩ortions are huge! 燾ome with an appetite or plan on sharing.

I got the Hollenbeck de asada. One huge burrito I must say. I felt like everybody was looking at me though because Im not hispanic, I just look like it. I only came here because I saw it on Man vs. Food and although it was a worthwhile experience, because I was starving, it wasn't the best mexican food i've tasted. Kinda salty and oversized. I guess Man vs food guy just likes size over taste. Gotta find a Guy Fieri spot to try. maybe JB's BBQ

This place is a Los Angeles icon. 燱hile most people think of the Hollywood sign or Grauman's Chinese Theater or the Watts Towers as Los Angeles icons, this place defines Los Angeles to foodies in more than one way. Manuel was an awesome guy when I met him. 營 can't recall if he gave me tequila (he probably did, but I forgot), but that is his welcoming tradition here - that and the line that always goes down Evergreen Avenue at every waking hour. 燭he interior is small, but it historic - it shows Manuel's humble beginnings as well as his restaurant's rise to prominence. I tried Manuel's Special, which is a five-pound burrito topped with salsa and stuffed with pork. 營 wasn't too thrilled with pork after I finished the burrito (I couldn't finish the entire plate, but I was happy that I ate what I did), but it was a decent burrito that failed to separate itself for anything else I've ever had until about 2/3 through the burrito. 燜rom there, the burrito was horrible, especially the salsa. 燣ooking back, it wasn't too bad, but I don't understand why it's so revered in East L.A. If you want to dine here, prepare yourself for a wait. 燞owever, I've tasted better pork burritos here in Ohio (unfortunately). 營'd go back just to see if the 5-pound burrito with steak would taste any better (knowing my love of steak, it should), but the challenge will only count if you eat the whole burrito with pork - just a heads up. 營 respect Manuel as a person and respect Manuel's restaurant for what he's done, but it unfortunately was unable to take me to culinary nirvana.

Wanted to go here for over a year before I went. 燭o try their legendary burritos! 燭ried to go a couple other times, but the line was too long to reckon with. 燜inally we got lucky enough to get there when there was no line at all! Yay! 燗lmost as soon as I ordered and sat down, our burritos were brought out. 燭hey must have a production line in back and get the tortilla out as soon as the word burrito crosses your lips. 燗mazing, only thing is I wished the burrito's were hot. 燭he meat was warm, which made the whole thing kind of lukewarm. 燘ut I like my food burning hot to start off with. 營t was about the temperature I'd have expected when I was halfway through the thing. 燘ut whatever, it was awesome to try my hand, with a partner of course, at a burrito the size of my torso. 燚idn't even come close to finishing. 燳ay, love me some yummy leftovers!!! 燩lus then I could get those as hot as I wanted! 燱ould definately go again, and again, hopefully soon! Lol, have to share this, but the other day I noticed that the name sound's a lot like El Tip-N-Yack.... which is exactly what you feel like might happen after you attempt to stuff that much burrito into your stomach.

I honestly have to say that I don't have any issues with the restaurant, and I really liked the down-to-earth ambiance. But the food itself was a little bit of a disappointment - what it offered in quantity, it didn't make up for in quality. For two we ordered the Hollenbeck de Machaca burrito and the 2 Enchiladas in Red sauce combo. The Machaca wasn't as flavorful as I had hoped, and the sauce that topped the enchiladas was just too overpowering. There wasn't much guacamole in either of the entrees. Overall I'm glad I tried the place. As an FYI there are two lines - one for eating in the restaurant, and one for getting take-out, where you can eat at one of their outdoor seats if you want. The food comes out pretty quick in the restaurant, so it really just depends on which line is shorter, and if there's outdoor seating available.

Learned of El Tepeyac through a friend. I wasn't aware of the publicity it received from Man vs. Food until researching it. I support independently owned restaurants getting a lot of attention from the food & travel shows. �I hadn't actually seen the show though, so I was still surprised by the size of my small, basic Original Hollenbeck burrito. 營 had stayed clear of the Manuel burrito's that say they are good fro 2-3 people or the Foot Long Manuel burritio's that say good for 6-8 people. 燤y small,basic Original Hollenbeck burrito was easily large enough to feed two. The Original Hollenbeck has pork chile verde topping the burrito (the other Hollenbeck's have the meat on the inside. 燛rin ordered an Okie Machacha (shreadded seasoned beef) burrito and Marc ordered a Hollenbeck Carne Asada burrito. I didn't learn what Hollenbeck and Okie mean, but the Hollenbeck is a wet burrito with a green sauce and Okie is a wet burrito with a red sauce. The Okie Machacha was the big hit at our table and I recommend you try it. 燢elly ordered a chile relleno that was tasty too. No cervezas at El Tepeyac so that helps keep the bill down. 燭he house made tortilla chips were appreciated. We were fortunate and arrived immediately before a long line (4-5 tables, 10-14 people) queued up behind us. 燱e ate on a Sunday night. 燝o expecting a wait. 營f you do not want to wait to dine in, El Tepeyac offers a take out window.

Saw the giant and delicious looking burritos on Man Vs. Food so had to stop by when I was in town. I went in for dinner on a weekday and had to wait in line outside the building for about 30 minutes. I was by myself so I was able to get a seat up at the bar much quicker than most of the larger groups that were with me in line outside. I knew I was in for a treat was that I was the only white person in line outside and the only one inside of the restaurant the entire time that I was there. Very friendly people and my server suggested the Hollenbeck burrito. It was a tasty burrito that was filled with carne asada, beans, and rice. It was also topped with red sauce and shredded cheese. The burrito was massive and I was barely able to finish it. Can't wait to go back and try some of the other things that I saw on other peoples plates.

No frills, not extremely clean but the food is OK. Would I go here again, NO! I went here with my friend (Blonde haired pretty girl) a table of latino guys stared at her throughout our meal while making remarks to one another in spanish. I gave them a look which stopped their BS for a few minutes. Once we exited this joint she got cat calls from a few guys across the street. Seems like natural blondes are a rarity in this part of LA, so If you hit this place up def get a burka (I'm kidding) for any blondes accompanying you.

5 pound burritos. Had to come see for myself. 燨kay so, the neighborhood isn't so great and the place looks small and old, 爊onetheless, there was still a long line of people from different backgrounds waiting patiently to get in. 燬o, we waited with them. 燭hey have a small outdoor seating area and a section where you can order food to go. �When we were finally seated, after waiting 45 minutes, someone came to bring us menus immediately and we were able to place our orders. Before we knew it, 燿inner was served. My bro had the 5 lb burrito - he chose the pork in chile verde with the works. 營t was enormous! Big enough to serve a family of ��four. And then, not only that, it is also topped with generous amounts of the pork in chile verde! I had to take a bite, I tried a big chunk of the pork topping, and well, I became a fan. The meat was so tender and juicy and the chile verde was just delicious with a little bit of a kick to it. 燱e were there for one hour and my bro ate about 3/4 of it and just couln't eat any more of it after that. The rice, beans, cheese and veggies along with the meat was a great combo. I had the regular carne asada burrito, which I could not finish because the portion was just too big. It was really good- the beef was soft and tender and flavorful. 燨ur friends had the carnitas burrito, which they also enjoyed. The only part I didn't enjoy about the meal was the drink - we all had horchata and we all asked to send it back. 營t was so gritty that the bottom of our glasses were filled with rice flour/sediment - about 1/4 of the glass. 燱e asked the waitress about it and she insisted that horchata is supposed to be like that - really? 營 may not be Hispanic but I have had horchata before, not the kind sold at Raplhs but from mom and pop Mexican restaurants and from my trips to Mexico. 燗fter arguing with her, she finally decided to take them back and brought us sodas. So, the experience would have been better had the waitress not done that. 營 enjoyed the burritos and have definitely gone back. I've just stopped ordering horchata.

Definitely the place to be for if you are craving Mexican food. I came here with some friends on a Saturday night and boy was this place packed. Be prepared to search a little bit for parking. I ended up parking on one of the side streets after circling for several mins. We stood in line for another 5 mins before realizing they had a take out / patio area on the side. I guess its convenient if you plan on just picking up or sitting outside. We ordered the Manuel's special pork chile verde burrito. Being my first time here I had to see what the fuss was about. The burrito came out in a massive party tray. For the $21 we paid it was well worth it. The ingredients were good and plentiful, the pork was well cooked and the whole thing had the right amount of spiciness to it. You might be initial put off by the cost, but you do get what you pay for, massive amounts of great tasting mexican food. Next time I plan on trying the carne asada version.

This was one of LA's hidden gems until Travel Channel ruined it by exposing it to the rest of the world! This little caf�is situated across from a Catholic church in an unassuming Boyle Heights neighborhood. Even at 7am it's crowded, lively, and the staff is ridiculously friendly. I've actually never attempted a lunch visit, as I hear it's impossible to find a seat. Now for the food - you can't go wrong with the Manuel's Special Burrito (Pollo, for me). It's gigantic and filled with tons of meat, rice, lettuce, beans, and guacamole - and is enough for 2 or 3 people. 燭he extra large 1 footer is great for a potluck or party and easily feeds 10-15 people. I just picked one up for a work party and the smells of meat and sauce are making my stomach growl! Ok, so it's not the best Mexican food I've had in LA, but people are definitely the nicest. It's family owned, full of regulars, and worth a stop if you're in the area.

After seeing El Tepeyac on Man vs. Food, I knew it was too close to me not to go. Can I just say I live for the Machaca. 營t is my ideal Mexican meal: slow-roasted beef chunks with onions and peppers, served with melted cheese on top, some guacamole and pico de gallo. 營 got it a la carte, but I'm sure it's also available with rice, beans and tortillas. My fiance got the Hollenbeck burrito, which is HUGE! 燞e loved it though. 營 think it's safe to say we want to go back, next time with elastic waistband pants.

Hollenbeck burrito with shredded beef egg and red sauce. Bland. Need salt. Small little space with one large burrito. This is definitely a place you go to share with at least 3 people per burrito. If not more

LOTS of hype about this place. Adam Richman and his Man vs Food has came through here. I mean, they even have pictures of Danny Trejo, the star from many Robert Rodriguez flicks including Machete stopping by. My buddy picked up some take out for us for Super Bowl Sunday. What better else to have bomb Mexican food while watching one the greatest sports game played. Unfortunately, El Tepeyac didn't execute like a champ. It's more like a playoff team that gets knocked out in the first series. The portions here are ridiculous. When you pay for a $10+ burrito, you're probably going to ask wtf are you paying for? It's a damn a burrito. They rationalize the price with the amount they give you. Even a giant lineman would smile. I shared a burrito and we both weren't able to tackle it. The taste to me was a bit bland. I had to douse my food with the different salsa and hot sauces. It just didn't have that real Mexican street food magic that I was hoping to find. Maybe they went too mainstream? I wouldn't be able to tell you. Personally, I rather pay $10 for a bomb smaller burrito than a ginormous bland burrito that I lost my appetite for in the middle of my meal. I can now say I have tried this place & knock it off my bookmark list. It wasn't out of this world nor was it horrible but I can surely live without it. Back to the Mexican street vendors where they hardly speak a lick of English. Orale'.

So I don't eat pork, sue me. We got to El Tepeyac a little after the lunch rush but there was still a line out the door. �So I ordered the Hollenbeck but with chicken and apparently it changes the whole chemical composition and deliciousness of the burrito. 燭here wasn't anything special about it except that it was the size of my thigh and could feed me for the next week.

Not a huge fan, but it's still not bad. The food seems to be a lot more bland than I remember 10 years ago when I used to go, the ingredients, although not bad, used to be a lot more different, maybe even fresher and the meat was tastier and juicier. It could be because now they have a whole lot more clientele which means more demand and with the way this shitty economy is they may have had to cut cost and turn a profit who knows. Any way like I said, not too high on the food, but the service is great, the tequila while you wait in line is great and the prices are pretty good too.

My friend had just come back form a trip to Thailand and was leaving again to got to Mali and Boston for several months. We were desperate to see her so she invited us to join her for dinner here. I read the reviews about this baby sized burritos and didn't think it was possible. Well that was sunday, today is tuesday, and I am still eating the burrito. Be ready to wait, and wait outside, but it is totally worth it. We had 10 people in our party and they did their best to accommodate us. The table was a bit small for all of us and our food, but it was cozy and that is ok. The food itself was amazing. I got the Hollenback De Chile Verde. YUMMY! There was the right mix of guac, rice, beans, and chile verde. The chile verde itself was delicious. The pork was well seasoned and just fell apart in my mouth. What also makes this place great is the price. It is like 8.95 for a burrito and I have made it last three days. You could easily split a burrito between two people and probably have left overs. I will totally come back here as it is well worth the drive and the wait.

I like this place. There was a line outside the door when we arrived, but luckily some spots at the counter opened up and we nabbed them since no one else wanted them. We walked inside to find that this place is really small and crammed full of bodies lol. Literally every possible spot was taken up by chairs and tables, leaving only the minimum amount of space necessary for walking around. The counter was nice though. The stools are fixed to the floor, so each person has his or own set area (I have personal space issues lol). We ordered the Hollenbeck de Machaca and Okie de Asada. The Okie came out kind of cold and the Hollenbeck was barely warm. My wife likes her food piping hot, so she was a bit disappointed, but "barely warm" is good enough for me, so I was a happy camper. Even though the burritos look ginormous, ours were mostly filled with guacamole (like half, no joke). I like guacamole, so that was okay with me. As a result, we were full, but not overly stuffed when finished. Service is great. Its a really friendly atmosphere and the service reflects that.

It's HUGE. I ordered the special machaca burrito, and shared it with 3 other people. It was enough to stuff me (full) and satiate the boys, okay. The value is pretty nice. 燱hen we cut it into forths, each piece was about the size of a large burrito, only less tortilla and more stuffing. There is a lot of meat, which I like, but some parts of the meat was the cheap tough/ fatty bits. 營t also came with an okay amount of bell peppers, beans, rice, and guacamole, and came topped with tons of cheese. Overall the flavor was pretty good. 營 personally like more spice in my burritos. 營 would have liked some hot sauce, salsa, and lime, personally. There was no line when I went (6:30 pm) and lots of street parking. 燭he seating area is a bit narrow and claustrophobic. 營 wouldn't recommend large parties hang out here. �Overall, it's a must try experience. 營f anyone can finish this on their own, kudos to you!

I don't usually like to share my food, but I'll make an exception here. I came here for a friends birthday...note to everyone out there, this is not a good place to go if you have a large party. How they arranged the table was a fire hazard. It was crazy. The person at the end of the table had to keep moving because people needed to pass by to go to the restroom. Not good. The whole hype is about the size of their burritos, which really is giant. Its burritos on steroids. The tortilla has to be massive to wrap this thing. They must have gallons of sauce prepared as well. It's insane. In my opinion the burrito was good. It wasn't the best. I was expecting worse just because of the monstrous size.

Always great food. Hit-or-miss customer service. I grew up for the first 13 years of my life in Boyle Heights and El Tepeyac (and subsequently the Manuel's Special) was a staple on Sunday mornings. I've always loved the food, and given the reception of all the Yelpers, I don't think I need to go into further detail on that. Today I tried the menudo for the first time here. It's only made Friday evenings and on weekends, so hop on the opportunity if you get the chance. The broth was very deep and rich, with striking notes of lime and herbs. The "nasty bits" of pork were very tender and flavorful. The hominy was cooked to perfection and added a nice foil to the other melt-in-your-mouth flavors. The horchata, as always, was on point. I can go on and on about this place, but the reason it doesn't get a 5 is because I've had numerous experiences with the staff forgetting orders or not being very attentive. Today, my friend's order was forgotten (he ordered a Manuel's Special to go) and after 30 minutes of waiting (the dining room was completely packed, as was the to-go line, so we gave them the benefit of the doubt that they were just busy), we asked them how much longer the food was gonna be, and found out they never started it. This wasn't the first time, and it sure isn't the last time they'll mess up the order. Luckily for them, the foo speaks volumes about the quality and care they take in executing their recipes and that's enough for them to still get a 4 in my books.

Ever see a 4 lb burrito? Well if you have, I bet you haven't seen many. El Tepeyac is the home to the "Manuels Special". This 4lb colossus is packed with the meat of your choice beans rice cheese wrapped in a warm tortilla. Many people have taken up on eating this whole burrito in one sitting and have failed miserably as well as succeed. The Manuel Special has been displayed on tv on the entertaining show Man vs. Food.

I haven't been to Manuel's El Tepeyac in like 8 years, and I don't plan to especially if I can go down the street to Ciro's and have a tastier meal with complimentary guacamole, salsa and chips. Or better yet, just drive down like a mile Southeast to Los Cinco Puntos on Brooklyn, oops, I meant Cesar Chavez and take it to go! I had enough El Tepeyac over my life and realized every time I eat there, the food is way too salty and just overly spicy...and let's not forget that it's a religious experience for the loyalists, because it's tradition to eat at Manuel's. Don't get me wrong, I love spice! I believe El Tepeyac does too much of the aforementioned because they are masking their otherwise bland food. Everyone knows when you add tons of salt, the food 'seems to' taste better. Add in a ton of spice and your taste buds are thrown outta whack...therein lies the perfect concoction for a food masquerade. Oh how dare I review El Tepeyac in such fashion! Look, I used to eat here a lot. Even been able to pound a Manuel's Special all by myself. I just got tired of having to drink 5 gallons of water to offset the salt intake! Does Manuel's serve huge portions, heck yeah! Would I go there for an out-of-towner? Perhaps...but I can think of many other restaurants to dine at and relish in the substance of the meal than the folklore of a fabled East LA gem.

Everything is very well done. This was first time having machaca (the platter), the meat was tender, juicy and very flavorful. The combination with refried beans and tortillas somehow accentuates the meat, turning the machaca into a potentially addictive habit. Seriously consider adding a serving of the guacamole; that extra flavor will guarantee you clean your massive plate (way past your stomach's fill point). The highly-recommended hollenbeck carne asada burrito was very large but did not meet expectations; the sauce on top was not as rich or flavorful as anticipated. Especially after tasting the machaca, it was near impossible to go continue eating the burrito. I think Okie style seems to be a more tasty option. Topped off with a cup of horchata, spiced with a bit of cinnamon, it was a very satisfying and VERY filling meal.

I came here with my cousins to eat the jumbo burrito from man vs. food. It was raining and the line was out the door. Definitely worth the wait, especially if you've never eaten here. There is also a to-go window so if you dont want to wait in the long line to eat inside, the to-go window is fast and there are chairs outside to sit on. On tv it looked pretty big, but in person it was HUGE! They put the burrito in a extra long silver tin platters people usually use to cater. The lettuce and tomatoes took up half the platter length wise and the tortilla, beef (we got the beef burrito), cheese, and sauce was took up the other half. Overall, burrito was delicious!!!! It's a definite fork and knife type burrito which is different from the Cali burritos in San Diego. The marinade of the beef was delicious and 爈oved all the vegetables that you can just add. There was 7 of us that ate the burrito. Definitely would be good for 8-9 people. We were already full and there was still some left. We did eat chips and guacamole with the burrito. Highly recommend. The guacamole was delicious and when I got tired of just eating tortilla, I put some of the beef filling with lettuce and tomatoes on the chips. Delicious!

My buddy is a hardcore biker and I am a marathon runner so consuming large quantities of food isn't necessarily bad for us every now and then. This place was on Man Vs. Food, so you know the quantity is going to be there. AMBIANCE: The place has a homely diner feel to it. There's a counter with stools on one side and tables on the other. Rustic wood walls brings out a more countryside feel to the area. It was somewhat loud but was tolerable. FOOD: We shared the Manuel's Special with Carne Asada. This thing is a beast. This thing could easily feed 4-5 people. It tastes great, too. Thank goodness. Otherwise, our meal would've been hell. Juicy meat and a good amount of guacamole, beans, and rice. Can't beat that. PRICE: Value!! For $20, we had our fill and some leftovers for a second meal. SERVICE: Our waitress was pretty cool. She explained the differences between the different Manuel Specials. Food came out quick! THE BOTTOM LINE: If you're like me and more cautious regarding nutrition, ignore that part of you for one night (or go for a nice workout prior) and try this place out! Food is great and you will NOT go hungry.

From order to the counter in less than three minutes! My favorites are the chili relleno dinner and the Hollenbeck burrito - both of which are to die for. Love the taquitos, too, as they really pile on their thick, homemade guacamole. If you get here at the right time of day, there's usually a parking spot waiting for you in their lot.

The orders here are huge so if you don't each much I recommend you share your order. I had ordered the Carne Asade Hollenbeck the sauce it was in was okay, it seemed a little bland for me. However, the meat and guac that was inside was really good . My dad had ordered the Okie Carne Asada Burrito and the red sauce that came with that was a lot better. During our meal we decided to order a side of chips and salsa. The salsa came right away but our chips never showed up. We even saw the basket of chips sitting at the pick up window and no one went to get it. We had to ask a few times before we finally got a chips and this was about 20 mins after intially asking for some. We got lucky when we got here we were seated right away.

A burrito the size of your face... and larger. I've only been coming here for about a year and I honestly haven't had a bad meal. The first couple times I tried to finish the entire NORMAL-sized burrito (successfully) and was punished later for it. My favorite burrito is the Machaca, minus the avocado. I can't eat more than this. It just isn't possible for me. My friends have tried to complete Manuel's especial to no avail... I feel like less than 0.1% of the population can finish that one. Be aware that you will probably be waiting a long time to sit down and eat especially if it is peak hours (lunch time) and don't expect completely attentive service. Enjoy your giant burritos, and pay respects to the memorial in the parking lot afterwards... you're going to feel like you have to after attempting to eat even the most meager burrito that they offer.

Best hole-in-the-wall Mexican in East Los! 燚o you like guacamole? 燘ecause this place drowns you with it and I love it! 燞uge portions, cheap prices and a family atmosphere. 營 used to attempt to eat their regular burrito, but it's so incredibly huge that I could never (I'm a pretty small girl), so I've found other options that allow me to enjoy the food for longer than two bites. 營 usually switch between the chile relleno and the Torta de Guacamole burrito. 燭he chile relleno is the BEST I've ever had. 營've ordered it at other places wondering if they could top Manuel's, but I have yet to find a better chile relleno. 燭he Torta de Guacamole is filled with guacamole, egg, onions and other yummies, but no meat, which means I can eat more of it. 燤y husband and I usually get a side of beef taquitos and guacamole, just to make sure we get our fill. �Besides the food, what I love about Manuel's is the atmosphere. 營t's a tiny place, but there are pictures of the family all over, a juke box in the corner and Manny greeting people at the door. 燞e'd typically punch my husband in the shoulder and then give me a wink. 燚efinitely one of my favorite places to eat in Los Angeles.

This is probably the best Mexican food I ever had. I rarely eat Mexican food, and I'm not a big fan of it, but man the Manuel's special was pretty awesome. My first time having horchota and it was amazing. The only CON that I can think of is the price, and the drive to get there. Man is it expensive. $10 for a burrito is a bit much for me. However, screw the price, the taste is what matters. Me and my friend shared a Manuel's special with asada, and both of us felt like we just ate a buffet. Pretty good Mexican food I have to say, will go back if I get the chance.

I visited this place yesterday for lunch with a co-worker. Unbeknown to us, yesterday was their anniversary so it was super busy! I am very finicky when it come to Mexican food but was pleasantly surprised. I had chicken enchiladas which were pretty good. The vibe in the place is nonpretentious and cozy but the place was a bit chaotic - every table was taken and there was a line waiting to get in. The owner �an adorable little old man) ran around talking to as many patrons as possible. This is truly a little jem in LA and worth the trip. I will definitely be back!

So much has already been said that is quite accurate about this place so I'll just say that the food is good (not the best in town but good), service is very friendly, you can't go wrong... although when it gets super packed I find it hard to justify waiting. If you like huge portions then you'll love the selection of their huge burritos.

The hollenbeck, the quesadilla and the occassional guy selling the DVDs are the reason why I come here! (for the record, I do NOT purchase these DVDs). The burritos are really good in general but the Hollenbeck really does make this an experience to remember. The location is kinda ghetto, but it feels safe... you get me? Like you know, feels like home kinda but not really... yeahh, you know what I mean ;) What I would recommend is to get the Quesadilla, and the Hollenbeck and split both w/ a friend. 燳ou get the perfect amount of variety and portions. The guacamole and rice is really good here... the shredded meats are flavorful, overall a decent dining experience... and a place where everybody should try.

Not as amazing as I hoped, but not bad!! THE ORDER: 1/4 guacamole with chips: 3 stars.....nothing to write home about, but good and chunky, like I like it. The greasy, crispy chips could have used some salt. Chile Verde: 3 stars.....Brite Spot in Long Beach has the best I'vge ever had. Pretty hard to beat. Carne Asada Burrito: 3 stars.....we ordered it with cilantro and onions, but it had neither....bummer :( THE SERVICE: Ummmm, well. It was attentive, in it's own special way. They came by, but really didn't check in unless they were dropping something off. Also, Our main waitress was like Xanax'ed out or something like that..... OVERALL: There was a slight wait, but no biggie. I really just thought it'd be TASTIER. Maybe I'm spoiled having been raised in Long Beach, which is loaded with many great Mexican spots (specifically Super Mex!). Prob will not be back...too many other great options!! Enjoy! xo- andrea

Amazing value (lots of food). Decent taste. Good service. Line stands outside. Private parking lot. Not the best tasting Mexican food, but... They... Give... You... A... Lot. It was about a fifteen minute wait, they have a pretty small restaurant inside. What I ordered: Okie de Chile Verde Burrito the size of face: $9.00 Carne Asada Nachos doused in cheese: $9.00 Horchata: $2.50 All that + tax + tip. Took half of my burrito home, split the Nachos with a buddy. The summary: Everyone walking out the restaurant either say, "I'm stuffed," or leave carrying something to-go. Besides the amazing amount of food, the taste is slightly above mediocre. They do have the Manuel's special challenge, eat a burrito designed to feed 2-4 people within an hour. Granted that their regular burrito seems to be designed to feed 2 people, that means you're eating a burrito designed to feed 4-8 people, in one hour. If you win, free shirt and photo on their wall of fame.

This place really had the homemade feeling to its food. I recommend the pork Hollenbeck burrito. It was tasty and the portions were huge. I also recommend their shredded beef taquitos. They are generous with the avocado throughout :) My husband tried the steak okie burrito. The sauce they put on top was not our favorite - it was oddly sweet. The actual meat was pretty good, so we wished that the sauce had lived up to the potential. Manny, the owner, was there and he was a total sweetheart. Is it the best Mexican food I have ever had? No. I leave those spots to my mom, grandmas and t韆s. However, it's pretty good and worthy of at least one visit.

I have this thing, where I prefer the Mom and Pop shops, to larger Corporations, so I am constantly looking for new eateries (-shot out to http://Yelp.com). However, after going to El Tepeyac Cafe, for the second time, I have concluded, that I no longer need to utilize yelp for Mexican food in LA, EVER again. I took a friend with me last night, who is a self-proclaimed Mexican Food Connoisseur, and he NEVER stopped praising the amazing-ness of his Okie de Pollo burrito. I don't know if I was more amazed with his ability to pretty much devour his burrito in less than 15 minutes without chewing, and never shutting up about how good it was; or if I was just amazed with the size of the thing. So imagine measuring the length of your forearm, and doubling the width- that should give you a pretty good visual of how large their burritos are. They're flavorful, they're stuffed with the best of rice, beans, your choice of meat, cilantro, onions, and guacamole. Either way you go, Hollenbeck de Asada, which is like a salsa and cheese combination on top of your burrito, or Okie de Pollo, which is a red enchilada sauce with cheese on top of your burrito, you are never going to want to go anywhere else for a burrito. And the service is awesome!! ;-)

Okay, it is man vs. food and food won on this trip. The Hollenbeck De Chile Verde is simply too big for one person and if we better knew what we were getting into we would have shared on of these. The pork inside of one of these is amazing -- large chunks that I would have thought to be only found in a chili but here they are in a burrito. Another one of us at the table had a simple Cheese Quesadilla and it was just as huge as the burrito! Service was great and it certainly has a wonderful family feel to it. I do not know much about the neighborhood but going there for lunch and being able to park in their own lot made us all feel safe enough.

The bf and I drove all the way here from Orange County and starved ourselves knowing already what we were going to order- The Manuel Special. 5 friggen pounds of pure burrito... But NO. This burrito was not pure. It was soggy and stuffed with iceberg lettuce and sourcream in the middle. Where the hell was my carne?

Lets just start with.. Omfg, they're burritos are huge! I remember in middle school coming here with my classmates, and yet again in highschool. The mexican food is good but the top notch item is the burritos. Not only are they crazy big but they are stuffed to the max with beans, guac, cheese and tons of meat. Atleast 4 people can eat it i'd say. If your starving or have a large appetite then maybe two people. This is a small restaurant so be prepared for it to be packed. Everyone is so nice and friendly. Even if its your first time there they'll act like youve been a customer for the last 50 years. Parking you can smell the food. Yum! Your tummy with immediately begin to growl. If your looking for a place to blow your mind and good left overs for the next day this is your place. Now mind you not every item on their menu is big so be prepared and ask the waitress fi you arent a regular.

My friends and I decided to try out this place after seeing it on Man vs. Food. Arrived there at 11:30 on a Saturday morning and the line was already building up. Waited for about 30 minutes until we were seated. First impression of the restaurant inside was very cramped. Sat down and ordered the Carne Asada Burrito. Two of my friends shared the Manuel's Special and another friend had the Bean and Cheese Burrito. My Carne Asada Burrito was very good and the meat was very tender. It came with a side of fresh guacamole and when I say fresh I mean you can see chunks of avocados that was just freshly cut because it still holds its nice green color. A lot of other places that I have been to, their guacamole tends to be more runny, but not at this place. The Manuel's Special Burrito was ginormous!! The rice and meat was oozing out with deliciousness! I was very impressed to see that my two friends were able to devour almost the whole burrito. The only thing that bugged me the during my entire meal was having to sit very close to someone else and every time I would use the knife to cut my burrito I would always bump into his elbow and vice versa. It got kind of annoying after couple of times of bumping elbows. I will definitely recommend this place to my friends and will be coming back soon to try their other yummy burritos.

Manuel's oh how I love you so. I have been going here since I was a little kiddo and you have never let me down. You are always there when I need some comfort food. Manuel is always there himself to give me a hug and kiss and make me smile when I am waiting in line. The food is always fresh and delicious. Huge portions. I know everyone loves the big burritos but I prefer the tacos, taquitoes and chilaquiles. Their guacamole is fresh and homemade and they give you a mountain of it. The service is good. The waitresses have worked there forever. It is nice to see the same faces every time I go. When you are done with your meal and pay your bill Manuel always gives you a tootsie roll pop, a tootsie roll, and a bubble gum. If he really likes you he will give you a extra special treat. :)

I saw this restaurant on Man vs. Food and I was so excited to try this place because I love grungy hole in the wall mexican places with amazing food. The show made my mouth water, so I was like alright, I HAVE to go. I called up my favorite foodie (also my best friend) who goes to USC and asked him if he had heard of it and he said no. We hung up, and 10 minutes later he called me back and told me he had yelped it and we were going this weekend. I believe we went on a Saturday at like 3:00 PM and there were 4 people ahead of us in line, outside. We wanted to eat there to get the whole experience, so we chose to wait in line - the line took about 20 minutes and let me tell you, it was worth the wait. You could also opt to order from the to-go menu which was outside on the side of the building. It was a little odd that they kept the door to the restaurant closed until they had a table ready. I felt like a kid on Christmas morning. Hahaha, and when they finally opened the door, it was amaaazing. The restaurant itself was tiny, but not cramped. I was kinda hoping Manny would be there forcing tequila shots on people, like on the show, but he wasn't (I wasn't really expecting him to be, just on a whim). Our hostess seated us at a table, but there was also counter seating available. I ordered the vegetarian burrito. OMG, soooo good and HUGE. I ate about one quarter of it and was full. Someone at the table next to us had ordered Manuel's Special - which is a 6 lb, burrito loaded with all kinds of 爂ood stuff on top. Aven referred to the experience of eating the burrito as "eating a baby" because it was the size of a new born. He ordered the nachos which were piled high with an insane amount of cheese, guacamole, etc. Definitely not for the health conscious. This tops the charts of my favorite Mexican restaurants. I will definitely be back many times. The drive from Irvine was well worth it and so was the wait in line. I'm hungry now!!

So I saw this on Man Vs. Food I went for my birthday, (on my birthday i went on tons of food adventures) And I got the 5 pound burrito. I dont like the area much. The place was small. But it was really fun in there. The customer service was great. Manuel is awesome. The burrito was HUUUUUUUUGE!!! It was definitely the largest food product I have ever seen. It fed my whole family of 5, and we still didnt finish it all. The taste was pretty good. The meat was juicy and the guacamole was awesome. The downside, everything else was bland. But I had a good time. I probably wont go there again till they build the second one in City of Industry. Just so I can get it again with my friends.

So my lil lady buddy was complaining about how hungry she was, and I looked on Yelp! for the closest thing to CSULA. The place had interesting name and that alone is enough to attract me to a location, so I didnt even bother reading the reviews. Had I though, I would have known beforehand what amazing little and popular place this is. We order tacos, enchilladas, quesadillas, and taquitos, and while we waiting we saw people ordering some monstrous burritos. The menu says it feeds a group of 8 people, some people were going at it in groups of two. The food tastes straight out of a home kitchen. Good quality, fresh, comes to you right from the grill all hot and full of flavor. If you see a big line of people outside, thats because theyre waiting to sit down. You can order food for pick right around the corner no problem! They have their own parking, but theres always a bunch of street parking. Some old guy sat down next to us and started going off and off about something...and then my friend turned around and she said, "so, they say the 3 candies they give you have an innuendo to them...one you suck, one you chew, and one you blow." Naturally... food and sex go together... Ill be back for that 8 person burrito!

It's not completely authentic, but neither is it completely Tex-Mex. You would imagine a place that serves massive portions of food to stack up average ingredients, but not Manuel's Especial Burrito. The burrito is 5lbs of goodness. The burrito is so big that even an average family of four wouldn't finish the burrito in a sitting (we tried, but failed). We ordered the carnitas burrito (we didn't want to put in the extra cash for carne asada) and it was so delicious. What makes El Tepeyac more especial? Manuel Rojas! I would add a bonus 6th star because the owner greets you with a shot of tequila. He is a very sweet man, such a charmer too.

My friends and I ordered the carne asada Manuel special. The burrito was at least as long as two forks and stuffed with a ton of meat, beans, rice, and guacamole. It was topped with salsa (that was unfortunately really watery and made the tortilla a bit more soggy than we wanted it to be) and mozarella cheese (when we really thought cheddar might have been better). Probably the best part of the meal was just the sheer size of the burrito. The three of us were barely able to finish it. The rest was just A-OK. The restaurant has a really cozy home-like feel. Our waitress was really sweet and laughed at us & told us we'd never be able to finish it! Overall, it was fun to try, and I might come back when I'm up for another burrito adventure.

"Wow" is all I have to say. I would not have figured this hole in the wall to be so good. Absolutely massive portions. For ~$12, my girlfriend and I shared one of the manny's special burritos and we each had our own drink. The burrito was obscenely large. It would be enough food for 3 very hungry grown men. Like lumberjack men. We didn't even get through half of it. And best of all, it was good. the chile colorado was perfectly cooked and tender. lots of real guacamole. lots of gooey cheese. and it wasn't soaked in oil. The service was great too. The waitress was very quick, and refilled our drinks multiple times without needing to be told. The only reason I give 4 stars and not 5 is because of the limited seating and lines. It's a crap-shoot trying to get in here. I've tried eating here 3 times, and I've given up twice after waiting in line for 30 minutes to get a table. Go on a sunday in the early afternoon. Don't go on a friday or saturday night or you'll be waiting forever.

I've been waiting years to try this place. 營 was one of many who came to this restaurant after seeing it on Man vs Food. 營 was glad I tried it out! 燱hen we arrived, there was a line of about 10+ people. 燭he line moves really quickly and it is worth the wait. 燭he owner (Manuel) was at the front of the line talking to people as they came and left. 燞e's a very funny man with tons of energy! Our table ordered the Hollenbeck Burrito (pork with chili verde) and the carne asada burrito. 燭he portions are HUGE! 燭he original size can feed 2+ people. 營 ended up only eating 1/3 of my dish. 燘oth the pork and beef burritos were delicious, but in our opinion, the beef was a tad bit better tasting than the pork. 燭hey gladly wrap up the food for you to go. I also ordered the 1/2 lb of fresh guacamole and chips. 燭he chips come with two sides of sauce - red chili and green chili. 燘oth are delicious and home made. 燭hey give a LOT of guacamole! 營t actually looked like it was closer to 1 lb of the guacamole! 燭he chips are home-made and fresh. Also delicious was the fresh horchata (rice drink). 燭asted fresh, clean, and nicely sweetened (not like a packaged mix). 燭he waitress was very fast and friendly. 燛veryone made you feel like home. �She was very grateful and even left us with some bubblegum and candy with the final bill. The restaurant also has a take-out window at the side of the restaurant. 燰ery very helpful and the food is quickly prepared. 營t's kind of helpful, as inside the restaurant, there are ~12 tables and ~10 counter seats. 燦ot too big area. Great food for the money. I especially liked how the waitress yells the order to the back kitchen. 燤akes it even more authentic! �營'll be back!

Roll up your sleeves, ready your stomachs, and prepare for glory. This place is the cat's pajamas. Lacking in aesthetics, but don't fret, the food and price make up for it in leaps and bounds. You may catch an occasional line out the door from time to time, but the wait isn't terribly long. (A little tip for you moguls on the go) If you don't have time to sit inside, there's a pick-up window just around the corner. �Pretty good Guac and EVERY burrito is exceptional. Wet, Dry, Hot, Mild. The sheer massiveness of these behemoths make chipotle burritos look like droopy eyed armless children... It's rumored that, "if you eat the Manuel's special outdoors, it would blot out the sun." �And for all you heat seekers out there, try the hot sauce. I love spicy and this stuff plucks my heart strings. ��All and all, a staple of Los Angeles cuisine. Eat well, Live well, and surround yourselves with ones who do. ��Cheers

Warning **For the true mexican food enthusiasts only!** One very warm Sunday afternoon I find myself driving down Whitter Blvd in ELA with a car full of my cousins including my little munchkin, and I find myself flooded with memories of my teenage years. Landmarks of the hispanic culture I was once surrounded by in my youth that I learned to love and embrace. At that minute as the sun begin to set, we decided it was an El Tepeyaks kind of day. �This place is one of those places that no matter the success they never change their roots or their origin. So with that being said, yes you pull up to an original building, across the street from an old church, on a Sunday afternoon, smack in the middle of East Los Angeles, and you will find yourself waiting in line for a heaping serving of heaven. Once your in, anything on the menu will not displease. My all time favorite is a tie between the chicken tacos (loaded with all the trimmings) or the chicken fajitas cooked with jalepenos .... aye papi! I promise this place is worth the wait, and if you're there on a warm afternoon there's nothing wrong with grabbing a table in the patio! p.s. bring your own wipeys for sooooo many reasons I won't publish here publicly ;-)

What brought me here? Watching the Los Angeles segment with the awesome, gorgeous, and foodie... Adam Richman from Man vs Food. The place was small but easy to find cause there is a line out the door. We luckily found parking in the little lot and waited in line for about 10-15 minutes. Manny greeted my boyfriend and I at the door and showed us in. I practically started drooling as I inhaled all the aromas in the room. The boyfriend ordered the the hollenbeck and I the Okie de pollo burrito. Oh... my... goodness... I don't know why I was surprised at the size of this burrito when I had seen the episode on MvF. 營t was so mouthwatering with the kick from the red sauce poured on top and you could definitely taste the love made into this burrito. My boyfriend consumed it all. I had to stop two-thirds in but when I heated it up in my little toaster oven the next day, it was even better. Manny offered us a drink in the form of alcohol and reluctantly turned him down. I only gave the 4 stars because I've only been there once and can't wait to go back to try new things and take that shot or beer waiting for me there. Hasta la pr髕ima !!

Been here once to try the Manuel's Special Carne Asada Burrito. The price was $20 at the to go menu and $30 if you dined in. I took it to go and was fairly surprised in the variety of ingredients included in the burrito including the massive amount of home made guacamole. This was not the best burrito that I have ever had and by far the worst. I was just expecting larger slices of asada, charred and perhaps marinated a differently. For $20 this meal sure provided a better value than ordering 4x $5 at just about anywhere else. This burrito included 7-8 salsa containers, red and green. Personally I preferred and enjoyed the green as it had flavor and heat. The red was heat only. FYI the neighborhood might feel a bit sketchy to those unfamiliar, lost and traveling at night :P

Good lord they give you an insane amount of food! I had the regular carne verde burrito. This monstrous burrito was approximately a 1.5 feet long, half a foot tall and buried under a mountain of meat. The quality was excellent but was not a sophisticated dish. Rather, the food here tastes home cooked. It is the kind of food that makes you feel warm and happy inside. Be forewarned, there is usually a crowd outside. Be sure to poke your head inside and make sure they are out of space before you stand outside like an idiot.

Having see El Tepeyac Cafe on Man vs Food, I knew it was a place that I must try. I still haven't ate there but I was luck that one of my co workers brought a GIANT size burrito from El Tepeyac. The burrito was BIG enough to feed 15 people with enough left over to feed 10 more. It was stuff fed with tender shredded beef, rice ,beans, cheese and guacamole. It was amazing. They served two types of salsa, both were tasty and full of flavor, the darker red one packed quite a punch. I can't wait to stand in line and experience what it's like to eat at a true Los Angeles classic. I will be there soon.

I had high expectations of this place but I left feeling like we just wasted our time and money, thats the main reason I gave this place a 2.0. Too much hype. Overall, the only thing I enjoyed was my chile relleno. The chile relleno is battered in egg and smothered with slices of green peppers, tomato, and yellow cheese and salsa; it had NO QUESO in the middle like I was expecting but it was good. The beans taste like CANNED BEANS so that was another dissapointment. All items are definitely OVERPRICED. The horchata tasted like rice mixed with water and sugar; no real horchata flavor, it should be creamier and have some cinnamon. We should not pay for salsa and chips! Most all mexican places give you chips and salsa, no reason to charge for this! So we didn't get them. Not coming back here, don't come here if you like real authentic mexican food. Big let down!

We got the pork only to find out you can get it in chicken and beef (I think). There is so much flavor going on in this giant burrito. The only thing is the pork was kind of chewy (been in the pot a while I think) so next time we go, we are getting the chicken.

Honestly, this is great Mexican food. Most definitely the best I have been able to find in Cali. The prices of all the dishes are fair. You get what you pay for. Go to any chain restaurant and tell me that you get a better quality and quantity for the same price. Just for those of you complaining about the price. The carne asada is great. It has a crunch that cannot be forgotten. Tacos are greesy, but it's Mexican food come on that's a given. Overall great food and great service. I will say the area is rather "sketchy". Don't be supposed if you get "holler-ed" at. Regardless I will continue going here. Two thumbs up.

I've been going to El Tepeyac (or "Manuel's" as we know it) since I was a fetus. 營t wasn't until decades later that I realized that many people viewed it as a novelty Mexican restaurant. 燱hen people outside of East L.A. talk about it, they speak of it like it's the prototypical Mexican restaurant. 燝eez, what pressure! 燭he food is great. 營ts notorious burritos are amazing. 燘ut like anything else, it can be over-hyped. 燬o try to temper your anticipation and don't build unrealistic expectations that can't be met. �I usually don't order the burritos. 燭hey're just too big, and I'm gluttonous, which results in an awful stomach ache. 燗nd besides, everyone already knows about the burritos. 營 like the taquitos. 燞ard shell filled with chunks of pork (or chicken if you prefer) and fresh guacamole. 燬ometimes I get the Kiko's Special, which is a plate of red chile enchiladas with a fried egg on top ...fried eggs make everything better!. �Expect a line (outside, so bring a jacket). 燬ervice is usually rushed, but you'll totally understand after having stood in line. 燦o alcohol (thank goodness. 爋r else you'd be standing in line outside forever!). ��My only complaint is that they charge for chips and salsa. 營t really pisses me off that chips are extra even when you order a side of guacamole. 營 love avocados but, c'mon, I'm not gonna eat it with a fork. 爋r at least not in public. �P

Man vs Food and Food won and will always win at Manuel's. 營've had Manuel's bookmarked for a while after seeing the Manuel's Special on Man vs Food. 營t's a Chile Verde Burrito that weighs 5 lbs. 燦ow they do have a challenge where you get a t-shirt if you eat the whole thing. 燘ut on the menu it does say for 2 to 4 people. 營'm guessing this is their version of a legal disclaimer. 營 also noticed they have a shrine of Guadalupe out in the parking lot, just in case the Manuel's Special takes another customer to the great beyond. OK, so this Original Manuel's Special is 2 large flour tortillas filled with rice, refried beans, fresh guacamole, and lots of chunks of pork in a Chile Verde sauce. 營t is then topped with shredded cheddar cheese and then more pork and Chile Verde. 燭he burrito itself stands about 18 inches long, 7 inches wide and 5 inches high. 燭hen add on a few more inches in each direction for extra toppings, and sidings, and bottomings. 燭his is not a lonely burrito, you could just eat everything around the burrito and be full. �The chunks of pork were deep fried ahead of time. 燦ot breaded or anything, just put into a fryer to crisp it up a bit. 營'm not a big fan of this, and it's the only reason I'm giving Manuel's 4 stars rather than 5. 燩ork is such a succulent meat, but by deep frying it, it got dried out a little bit. 營t still had a great flavor however because it had been sitting in their Chile Verde sauce for a while. 燬ince I'm a gringo, Verde is one of the 50 Spanish words that I do remember from Spanish class. 營 can also say cat, dog, pen, and pencil. 燳o speako Mexican very well. 燬o I can officially say there is nothing Verde about their Verde. 營t's actually Rojo (I will assume that something as manly as this burrito is masculine and go Rojo rather than Roja). 燭hey use lots of tomatoes in the Chile Verde rather than tomatillos and thus turns it red. 燘ut the flavor of those chiles is amazing. 燦ot as hot as you would think by any means, it's a very medium spicy Chile. 營 love hot and spicy food, but lately I am really enjoying places that can pull out the flavor of a spicy food without all of the heat. 燳ou don't get to taste those flavors that often, because the heat covers it up. 營 also really enjoyed the guacamole inside the burrito. It's very chunky and the big pieces of avocado don't get lost at with all the other bold flavors. 燗t some places the rice and refried beans are just fillers, but not here. 燛ach was top quality and very flavorful. 營t's some of the best rice and refried beans I've had. So how did I do....I finished about 40% of it. 燤y wife ate about 25% of it. 燭he remaining 35% is taking up an entire large styrofoam container in my fridge. �I've been snacking on it as leftovers and it's holding up very well the next day. 燭he flavors may even be better today as they've had even more time to mesh together. 營t's the burrito that just keeps on giving as I'm sure I can get today's lunch and dinner out of this thing.

Well, here we are in ELA again and we just made another trip to El Tepeyac. 燭his place has been around for more than 50 years and 營'm sure most of the customers have been going here since they wre kids. This is my standard for Mexican restaurants---down-home, huge portions, lots of locals and families, friendly staff, fun ambiance, and fantastic juke box. It is still teeny but if you go on an off hour like we did you can walk right in and have a seat. This time it is just the hubby and I. 燞e ordred his usual-a veggie burrito (massive). 營 got two taquitos that came with at least a cup of guacamole plus lettuce and tomatoes. We also ordered chips and quacamole. I had to take one taquito "home" (motel home) with me. 燨ur sweet waitress gave me two tubs of salsa togo with it.

Dang, I can't believe I haven't even heard of this place until recently! I'm up in LA pretty much every week and wish I woulda found out about this place before. My friend seen this place on the food network and went to check it out and he was ranting and raving a lot of good things about this place so I decided to give it a shot myself last Monday. El Tepeyac isn't too hard to find as its right in the middle of a residential street in the 'hood of East LA, so that was a good sign that this spot will be good! 燘eing a native San Diegan, we are spoiled with taco shops all over each corner of the city and the ones in the 'hood are always a lot more bomb and hooked up fatter! ;P I came here around 8:30pm-ish and noticed this place still had a good amount of people inside. 營 was on the way back down to SD and decided to just grab it to go at the side window outside the restaurant. Looking into the kitchen from the outside, it appeared this place was family owned from everyone who was working. Seemed like chaos inside, as they were stacking order after order of burritos for people dining in and for some peeps waiting outside. They made some of the biggest burritos I've seen in quite a while, prob enough to feed 3-4 people, LOL! I knew I would not be able to finish that so I opted for the Hollenbeck burrito. 營t was also quite large and I barely finished half of it before getting bloated. 燤ust have been the smooth and thick horchata that I downed before I started to eat the burrito. I have to say that their horchata is one of the best I've drank in a minute! It wasn't watered down and powdery like others and went down good! If your in LA, this place is a must visit! ;)

Let me get this straight: 'HUGE portions' merit the authenticity-stamp for Mexican joints?? *sigh* This place is as authentic as Knott's Berry Farm's Montezuma's Revenge snack-bar. Maybe I'm spoiled by the regional Piasa joints that don't cater to LA nostalgia but I don't trust any Mexican restaurant that doesn't serve Asada, Carnitas or Pastor meat. Iceberg lettuce!?? *shakes head* After all the hype from my newly extended East-Los familia and fellow die-hard Dodger fans, Its safe to say I was disappointed by TepeWac's condensed, portion-friendly menu. I agree, not ALL 'authentic' Mexican joints serve the same type of food, but they DO serve a protein other than thawed-out chicken strips and Shredded beef(Machaca).

It was established in the early 1950's, but serves up some of the best burritos of all time. �The burritos here are huge, packed with quality ingredients, and are smothered in a wet sauce. 營 like the Hollenbeck Burrito, which is packed with rice, beans, guacamole, and pork. 燭he Manuel Burrito is another signature item. �The menu has been expanded and includes additional items such as enchiladas, chorizo and eggs, tacos, and menudo. 燭heir taquitos with guacamole are among the best taquitos I've ever eaten.

I've been coming to Manuel's now for 20 Years and while it's not totally authentic Mexican food, it's some good home style cooking with good size portions, and don't get me wrong it's not the WH-EXICAN chain restaurant food crap either. So I've come here today for one main reason!, their are RUMORS on the street and I found it hard to believe, here are some and they are NOT my words ***........ ***Apparently some transition going on there, The family that owns the restaurant also owns the property. And now they have put the real estate up for sale under a proposed long term lease-back arrangement. I assume that the day-to day operations are being turned over to the posterity of the original owners who are now seeking to retire and cash in on the property value is my guess, probably. So when Manuel passes it will be cleaner to deal with stuff. This and many other crazy RUMORS have been flying around so I decided to get to the bottom of this and hear it from the horses mouth!.....So this morning I paid Manuel a visit, when I told him what the word going around was he just laughed and said I've been here 55 years where am I going to go!. He also told me he had some issues with "Uncle Sam" and refinanced the property at a good interest rate took care of "Uncle Sam" and all is well, hands me a Shot of Don Pedro, YES Manuel all is good! So I ordered my Huevos Rancheros http://www.yelp.com/biz_�and my glass of Milk, and enjoyed it knowing Manuel & El Tepeyac are not going anywhere soon!

Manuel, your burrito is so special to me. It's so big I don't think I can even wrap both of my hands around your massive girth. I thought two mouths would be enough to take you down but I was wrong. You are just too much to handle. Way too juicy and way too hot! They say you are big enough to feed two people, but you are massive enough for three mouths. It's just so muy grande! The way your juices dripped down my hands as I was taking you in my mouth... I was so relieved when the cream finally came. And such a mountain of a load you unleashed onto my table with a thud, commanding attention. You gave me a full scoop of your lovely sour cream! You looked just like a bowlful of vanilla ice cream on a hot summer day. We order this monstrous burrito suited for 2-3 people and they must weigh about 2 pounds each. I should know I couldn't breathe after eating here and my already loose dress was suddenly two sizes too small. I want to say the Manuel's special burrito base is a thick and rich meat stew. The beef was absolutely tender and slick with juices: a delicious stock made from beef, tomatoes, bell peppers and other veggies. Amazing! 5 Stars! The tortilla chips were stale. Boo! 1 Star. Side of sour cream was seriously a bowlful but the perfect accompaniment to the burrito! I like my burritos a little creamy. Manuel, you were just so good that lazy Sunday afternoon. I have to see you again... Burrito for two, one soda, a side of sour cream and a side of tortilla chips came out to $30.

Was a decent place when prices were cheaper and you got value for your dollar for bland tasting food, but since the prices have risen i don't think its worth eating here. Overhyped burrito has chunks of meat that look like Alpo - what someone would feed their dog. �cheap quality I know lots of people will disagree with me on this opinion, but i'm 'real talk.' 燪uantity doesn't equate Quality.

Used to come to Manuel's a lot. Had not been for a couple of years and brought a friend of mine that had never been. When he got his order, after tasting the beans and rice he said " this is boring" . I tasted as well and what I tasted was canned beans and boring rice that was not with flavor. Seems since Manuel does not run the place anymore the quality has gone down IMO and prices have increased. If you want a place that serves up quick and large quantities of boring Mexican food this is the place. The only item I will recommend is the taquitos . They are great! You will pay 7 bucks for them but they are good.

There's just something I love about fried eggs, especially when it's fried to the point that the white edges are browned and yet the yolk still retains some of its liquid gold. Sometimes a fried egg sandwich on lightly buttered toasted bread is all I need for a satisfying meal. Why all the egg talk? When it comes to dining out, I always seem to be drawn to dishes that feature fried eggs, whether it's fried quail eggs on scallops or fried eggs on pizza. So when I was out with friends to dinner at El Tepeyac, a restaurant icon in East LA, I had a hard time deciding what to order. Finally, something finally caught my attention and made my palate say "Ole!" Do you know what that was? Well, it certainly wasn't taquitos. My one dish quickie at El Tepeyac were the Beef Enchiladas topped with Fried Eggs. When I finally got my order, I looked down and then I immediately looked around to see who'd be willing to share this dish with me. It was huge, but so were a lot of the other dishes ordered by my companions. I was definitely on my own. Fork in hand, I cut into egg and enchilada and was happy to see the yolk gushing out. My first bite was delicioso. Granted, your doctor probably wouldn't recommend a steady diet of melted cheese, beef and eggs, but for that moment, I didn't care. Now is this the best enchilada I ever had, even with the fried egg? Probably Not. Would I go out of my way to return to El Tepeyac just for this dish? Not really. But for that moment, it was tasty, filling and hit the spot. Of course, whenever I go to into a Mexican restaurant in the future, I just might have to see if the chef would be willing to take a special request - fried egg on enchilada, anyone?

Meh. Yeah, it's huge, but my burrito seriously had no flavor. Tasted like store-bought guac and canned chicken. No hot sauce or salsa to doctor it up- and the staff was pretty rude. I saw this place on Man v. Food and thought it looked amazing. Unfortunately El Tepeyac didn't live up to the hype- at all.

After seeing this place on Man vs Food and seeing that massive burrito I had to try it.So this is how the story goes 4 guys with a dream of finishing this monsterous burrito.Manuels is located off of green leaf...in the middle of no where.Kinda like a dont blink or you will miss it.If you want to sit inside you better be wiling to wait because theres a line outside waiting to get in. As for the burrito,it was huge if your wondering about trying to eat it on your own...heres some advice dont even try it.If you do take some prilosec and take the day off of work.The burrito aka Manuels special feeds about 6-8 people.It cost around 28 dollars and you get alot for what you pay. The taste of the burrito was ok...wasnt OMG and it's something that i dont think i would crave anytime soon.I just wanted to try this massive burrito and say i somewhat ate it..you know just for the Kick the bucket list.

It's been a while since we've eaten here. My husband's a foodie channel watcher. 燞e saw El Tepeyac featured on Man vs. Food (one of his favorite programs) & has had the Manuel's Special on his brain the last few days. I'm a sickie today, so he went to get take-out. 燭he Manuel's Special for him & the veggie burrito for me. 燞e said the owner, Mr. Rojas, was out on the patio being personable with the crowd. 燭here was a young asian couple who he suspected were Yelpers because they were taking pictures of everything & posing with the owner. 燛ven at 2pm, the place was busier than usual. 燩robably because of the TV exposure? I don't remember the veggie burrito being THAT big! 營t's going to take me until tomorrow to eat this! 燬o good, lots of guacamole. 營 forgot to tell my husband to ask them to go light on the cheese. 燬o our doggie got a treat too. My husband got through 3/4 of his burrito & is now lying down on the couch, rubbing his belly & groaning about over-eating. Price-wise....Almost $26 for the two burritos. 燦ot complaining though.

HOLY BURRITO. So, yes, I'm obsessed with Man Vs. Food. I have a crush on Adam Richmand. I find him freakishly attractive. So, yes, I ended up here, since he was feeling the love. I did not order the Manuel special, I do not have the stomach to handle that. I did order the Okie burrito, in hopes that it would be smaller. Um, psych. Their "normal" burritos are still literally bigger than both of my hands and are gigantic. �Really guys, really? Ah, but then, I managed to take a bite, and the clouds parted. This is effing awesome. This is one of the best authentic wet burritos I've ever had (and I had two today... I'm pretty sure I'm just made of burritos and beer at this point). �The meat is perfectly marinated and the way it blends with the rice and everything it's just... perfect.

This place is the SH*T, I kid you not.

Guacamole Torta burrito- basically a guacamole omelette in a flour tortilla with beans. =D Machaca burrito =D and..the taquitos!! Some of the best taquitos ever with a huge glob of guacamole =D The only bad thing is that the prices have gone up. 2 taquitos for $7? Burritos for 8? 1 taco $3.50?

I finally got to try the famous El Tepayac. My friend had raved about the burritos from this quaint restaurant that sits on one of the East L.A. Hills (yes - east l.a. has hills too!). So we're driving, driving, driving and I'm telling her, "tell me when ok?" Then she says, "Ok, it's here, where that huge line is." Quickly, I turned into the small parking lot and parked right next to the little worship garden. We went up to the "to-go ordering" spot and it took no more than 5 minutes before we took our babies home. Babies. The burritos were like the size of a 4-5 lb baby. good lord! I think I got the Hollenbeck Steak Picado burrito (came with beans, rice, onions, cilantro and big chunks of steak with sauce) without the sauce topping (ironically, i'm not much of a wet burrito gal). When I opened the box, the burrito was so huge and it went from corner to corner. It was really good! I only got to eat about a quarter of it and saved the rest for later. When later came, we managed to make dinner out of it for two people, one including a growing young man. We were stuffed! So you know how when you go to your momma's house and she's packing up food for you to take with you and she puts all these things in containers for you, salsa, cheese, lemon, ketchup packets, really anything she can find in the fridge. Aw, what? You're not your mom's favorite? Ok, well my mom does this for me all the time and I felt right at home at El Tepayac because when I got home and dug in to the bag, I found that the lady had put the wet burrito sauce in a container for me, along with tons of green salsas (I guess she overheard me tell my friend I loved green salsa), and lemon. Woman after my own heart, I swear. I plan to make chilaquiles with that salsa!! On to the salsa -wow! They must have the spiciest green salsa I've ever tasted! It's really good, but it did give me heartburn later and made my nose run. Sinuses CLEARED! �Overall, El Tepayac deserves all the accolades it receives. I can't wait to go back and try their breakfast burritos! Imagine?

Tasty, dirt cheap, and ginormous quantities. 燛l Tepeyac is a shining example of why we all worship the hole in the wall. �I challenge every other Mexican restaurant I've been to in the greater Los Angeles area to serve taquitos like these: they're fat with tender, shredded beef and not skinny and dry like most others. 燘ut the beauty of it all is the mound of chunky guacamole that tops them. 營'm not talkin' tablespoons here--y'know, the kind of tablespoon that gets lost in a bed of shredded lettuce (anyone else share my disdain for that?). 營'm talking about a heap of guac that's typically shared between 4 people at every other restaurant in town. No lie. 燱hen was the last time your guac ran out of taquito? For that matter, when was the last time your burrito ran out of tortilla? 營 ate a quarter of my Manny's special burrito and had to order tortillas to go. �The beef tacos are so loaded with shredded cheddar cheese that you'd swear you made them at home. �Not my favorite Mexican food, but the quality, quantity, price, and homey service (you can tell the same people have been working there for decades) is one in a million.

I have been coming here since i was a kid and every time it is soo good. Prices are a little expensive; more than you would expect for a mexican food cafe, but you get your dollars worth in food. This is one of the only places where they are not stingy on the guacamole. Gotta get the hollenbeck or okie burrito. So friggin good!!!

Prolific! Never before has there ever been such a great burrito as the `Hollenbeck` for a spicy beef burrito drenched in a red chile sauce. You will need a knife and fork and a designated driver. Not for every day eating, but certainly to be remembered as the day you ate at Manny's El Tepeyac Cafe . Make the trip and say hello to Manny who personally sits most of his guests. He will remind you of your grandfather.

I have a hard time handing over all five stars. I guess I think of five stars as "now that I know this place exists, I can't live without it" and want to reserve it for serious, serious food love. We were in the market for a cheap meal. We got there at five pm and there was a line of people on the sidewalk. You wait outside until a table opens, then an empolyee will come out and invite the next group in. I was starving, having saved myself all day, so the wait felt eternal but was probably 25 minutes. When seated, we realized there was no liquor or beer. Well, fine, even cheaper meal! We split a "1/2 guace with chips" as the appetizer and settled on sharing the Hollenback muchaca (shredded beef) burrito. The guac came first- good thing I resisted ordering the "full guac with chips", the 1/2 was huge! For $5.50, it was crazy good deal. It was also crazy good-tasting guacamole! The problem was the two of us could never finish it, even if we drowned our burrito in it. Not being able to finish an order of guac just felt wrong. I'm more accustomed to licking the little bowl than leaving any behind. We didn't really dent our huge guac mound before the burrito showed up. It was, as promised, enormous. Stewart divided into two very large burritos. We ordered sour cream to go on top and melted cheese, extra charges fyi. It wasn't as pretty as I expected it to be, and it tasted a litle different than I would have thought. The meat was very good- tender, juicy, flavorful. The red and green bell peppers on top were a very predominant flavor, along with a tangy tomatoey sauce with a zip. The Rice and Beans, which I had read were excellent, were sort of drowned out, couldn't really discern their taste. I sort of tried to order an extra side of each for this reason but the waitress looked at me like I was insane and warned me "Is very big! Burrito is very large!", but next time I would, even if I couldn't finish everything. The sour cream and guac did their thing on top and did it well. Over all, it tasted very good, in a comfort food kind of way, not in a "how did the genius chef achieve this?" kind of way. It was very tasty and a great price- our entire check with sodas, oversized guac, and tricked out burrito was 21 bucks. Even with the tip it was still slightly less than our Arclight movie tickets! And even splitting the massive burrito, I left STUFFED. They gave us a handful of double bubble and tootsie rolls (the long skinny kind, horay) which was perfect for the movie were going to. It was hike from Culver City, but I'll come back some day. I'd like to try some of the other dishes. Oh- when we left at 6 pm, the line was looooooooooooog, yikes.

At the take-out window, once I asked for the price of the large horchata ($2.99), I felt it was high. 燗 large horchata in this location should be $1.50 to $1.80 max. 燘ut then I asked for the price of a small one ($2.55), I decide not to order ANYTHING. 燘eing a businessman and a good mathematician, I smelled a very greedy man behind the operation. 燞ere's the game theory for this. 燳ou see $1.99 would have been greedy enough for the location but smart enough to hide under the 2 dollar mark. 燘ut the guy 爄s not 爋nly asking over $2 but actually over the 2.50 mark at 2.55 not 2.45. 營 smelled the heavy stench of greed.

I've dined at El Tepeyac numerous times and found it to be very good each time.....until recently.

The burrito is huge. HUGE. It's like all of the world's burritos joined forces to form one giant superburrito. It must've weighed as much as a small infant. Seriously, it is that big. I got a vegetarian burrito for the low, low price of $7.35. Considering that one burrito is like three or four meals for me, that's a fucking bargain. There was no line, and my take-out order was ready in five minutes. I was under the impression that "vegetarian" meant veggies, but I think it just meant no meat; there were no veggies other than in the salsa. But the generous amount of guacamole did make it delicious (and perhaps the avocados in the guacamole count as vegetables?).

First, I dare anyone to navigate the streets of ELA to get here. It's not easy and requires a lot of courage, unless you live here of course. I used to live off of Rowan and Cesar Chavez Bl. Basically, this was an illegal house to restaurant conversion that eventually received a permit to do business the legal way. Who's gonna deny this place a permit anyway? Fat ass Councilwoman Gloria Molina, The Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa, countless cops, firemen, and other politicians frequent this joint I'm sure. I park around the corner on a public street because I don't want to deal with the hassle of the little lot. In most cases, I have to wait out front until the folks inside start slowly exiting. Upon entering this restaurant, you have a slim choice of a bar stool area, and some dining tables. Room in here is very limited. I wasn't joking when I said this was a home to restaurant conversion. Manny still works this place and you can identify Manny by his distinguished raspy voice and large prescription glasses. Nice guy all around. I usually order the Hollenbeck burrito. Feeds a family of twenty. Picture two of Oprah Winfrey's thighs wrapped in a large flour tortilla and you can visualize the size of a Hollenbeck burrito. Just a masterpiece that you can't possibly finish. They also have a walk up window that I was completely unaware of until my last visit here. I cannot wait to go back!

I've been here quite a few times now, but it has always been take out. The place is old and nostalgic, but I'm not the sentimental kind of guy (hence my poor review of Clifton's Cafeteria). However, unlike Clifton's, the food here are worth coming for. Since I live 5 minutes away, I just get it at the outside take out window and eat at home. I first discovered it last year when they put it on the market after being in business over 20 years. Before a new owner could ruin it, I thought I better try it. As far as I know, it still hasn't sold. If you like wet burritos and have a big appetite or family and friends who like to share, this is an excellent place. I've tried the Hollenbeck de Pollo (fed 3 of us) for $9.20 and Manuel Special de Pollo (fed 4 of us) for $19.50. We are a skinny Asian family so the prices come out well for us. Mileage may vary for you and your family. I am not Mexican, so I can't vouch for authenticity. Most of the clientele are Mexican, so that gives me some indication that it is authentic. But I don't really care who the other customers are because the food speaks for itself. One thing I generally think about this kind of Mexican food is that it lacks contrast - so that is another reason I like take out. Along with these incredible delicious sauce-heavy burritos, I make a nice spring mix salad with a vinaigrette dressing to balance it out. They lack a side salad on the menu, instead offering french fries, rice, beans, cheese, sour cream, tacos, taquitos, etc. See what I mean. Lack of contrast. They have tostadas, quesadillas, sandwiches, and various dinner plates, none of which I have tried. After all, they are known for their burritos and I go there when I'm in the mood for a burrito, so that is what I get. So what are you waiting for? Go there and try it!

We went on a mini Man Vs. Food tour and ate here after Orochon Ramen. Ladies and Gentlemen DO NOT ATTEMPT TO EAT THIS BURRITO BY YOURSELF. you will fail miserably. I had the Hollenbeck and the pork was perfectly tender. We went late on a sunday and the wait for a table was pretty short for a party 0f 7.

The staff is friendly and the service was fast. I was curious about the giant burritos that were featured on Man vs Food but came to find out that they don't live up , they lacked flavor and it was just too much with nothing to offer. The steak nachos were better. Never get the chicken burrito it is awful and yes they are huge and could feed multiple people. There is parking and the menu offers many choices.

Visited here a couple times for lunch, I was surprised by the effort my friend had in venturing from her office in downtown LA. 燘ut with it being right next to the 10 fwy. the parking was the only hang up... 燱ell, the seating was a bit of a challenge too, it seemed like every detective from the LAPD was here, as well as Fire Chiefs!

I confess I learned about this place from Man vs Food (a digusting yet alluring show) during the LA episode and you know what? 燭hose were no camera tricks when they videoed those burritos. They are damn HUGE!! Luckily for me this little E LA diner is a quick drive from my work, so a few local street turns and 10 mins, I was there. 營 decided to go with the first thing I saw on the menu, the Hollenbeck burrito with the chili verde pork. 燨MG for something costing less than $8, I was in heaven and as I stared at this massive tortilla wrapped thing larger than my two fists put together, I took a deep breath, picked up my fork and knife and got to work... The lady sitting next to me at the counter was staring at my food and asked if I was going to finish it right then and there, but I told her 'are you kidding? 爄'm taking the rest home'. 燽ut before I knew it I finished almost 3/4 before I safely threw in the towel and decided to finish the rest later that night. Service is really friendly altho I didnt see that crazy owner, although maybe I needed to be a female to draw his attn. 燱ith prices that cheap and food that good i'll definitely be back. 燚efinitely come prepared with as empty a stomach as possible.

I HATE LARD! And guess what? everything here is swimming in it! Especially the tortilla chips that felt like bombs to my stomach--as I write this now I suffer from the effects (aka explosions). The food is served in industrial portions. First adjective that came to mind: grotesque. It just looks like wacatelas!!!! I had the enchiladas rojas con pollo. Couldn't finish half of it... And no way on earth I could handle their burrito, which looked like the meal for an army. Best thing of the evening: will.i.am. He was there eating, that being a close place to eat in his childhood as he grew a few blocks away from there. Other than the random celebrity sight-seeing, El tepeyac offers cheap, vein-clogging food, that might make you happy, if you survive the heart attack...

A+ on history, they've been cooking since the beginning of time. A+ on nostalgia, it looks like they've been so busy, they never had time to remodeled. A+ on no nonsense service, have to be with such volume. A+ on portions, absolutely huge!!!!!! No grade on food from me. Gosh, I just wish I liked boiled shredded beef. If it were the seared grilled beef, it'd be an A+ too. No such options. That's just me though, the line that stretches way outside says the food is just fine the way it is.

OMG. My boss took me here when we were up in LA for a work meeting. He was so excited and raving about the place and grew up eating it. The inside is small with maybe 8 tables and counter seating. He said we were lucky because we got there early and the line wasn't out the door yet. There were 3 of us that night and we ordered 2 hollenbecks. A male co-worker and I shared one and my boss had the other. The portions were enormous! I ate about 1/4 and so did my co-worker. I took the rest home to the boyfriend who made it into two meals! My boss somehow managed to eat the entire thing. I was almost disgusted watching him though. The hollenbeck burrito had big pieces of carnitas inside and around the outside. It was covered in red sauce that 爓asn't too spicy. Inside was refried beans, rice, guac, and cheese if I remember correctly...You could tell the pork had been cooked low and slow because it just fell apart. Yummy! Service was quick and very friendly. Prices are good here for the amount of food you get. Unfortunately, I probably will never eat here again since I live "behind the orange curtain". But if I were in the area by some odd chance I would definitely stop in.

Have you heard of Burrito Dos Manos? Psssh... This is Burrito Ocho Manos y Dos Pies! Holy guacamole! Forget the U.N. World Food Programme -- a single El Tepeyac burrito can feed a small nation. It is seriously the biggest burrito I've ever laid eyes on. Ok, you get the picture. But while it's not the best I've had, it certainly leaves me content (and gasy... but mostly content). Tips: Don't attempt it on your own, unless you're the hermano gordo.

If you ever hear people talking about "Manuel's" in East LA, that's this place. 燭he locals call it by the name of the legendary owner. Sinfully delicious Mexican fare that has NOT made any concessions to veganism or to the American Heart Association ... they still drench everything in lard, just like any traditional Mexican grandmother does. 燘ut that's why it tastes so good. Burritos are HUGE ... you can easily feed a family of four with some of those monstrosities. 燳ou can never go wrong with the taquitos and guacamole with refried beans either. 燚iet be damned. 燗nd if the owner is around, and he takes a liking to you, you might get slipped a free shot of tequila as well. 營t happens every time my Mom (a long-time customer) is there with us. Lines can be long, as the place isn't very big at all, but if you don't insist on a waitress and real dishes, just go around the side of the building and order from the to-go window. 燭here are picnic tables out there for you to use, so it's not like you'd have to eat in your car. CLOSED ON TUESDAYS! But no matter how many times you're told that, you'll still probably show up on a Tuesday anyway. 燬o if you didn't listen to your fellow Yelpers, and you drove a long distance to get out there, just head to Ciro's across the street. 營t's not quite the same, but decent enough.

It's the original and it's the best. I defy anyone to find a better wet burrito anywhere else in LA. Recommendations: Hollenbeck, Manuel's special, Hollenbeck de Machaca. Basically any burrito. Careful when ordering 爐he Chicken burrito ( it is simply chicken meat wrapped in a tortilla) and not a good representation of the wonders that embody all their other burritos. Breakfast is also grub. Used to be cash only so make sure to stop at the bank. Prices are very reasonable. Massive portions so come hungry.

This place is soooo awesome that it hurts. theres always a line to get in but its soooo worth it. the Manuel special. My family has been ordering that for 20 years. the guys love my dad so much that they sneak him beers from their personal stash. the Manuel burrito consists of a burrito the size of a plate, filled with marinated pork and all the in-burro goodies. then its topped with more chunks of pork. then as a tease, they put a little bit of beans and rice on the side for looks. hahahahahhaha. no joke it took 4 of us to eat this, and we still had a 1/4 of it left over. this is the place to go if you want to see what the inside of an emergency room looks like 2 hours and 3 shocks after the meal. gotta 爈ove that cardiac delight special....!!!!

I've been holding off on tackling my first Manny's Special for no good reason, so today I decided to get off my ass and drive to EasLos to meet the monster. After learning about my plans, my dad wanted to tag along for the sake of reminiscing. The last Manny's Special he attempted was decades ago when I was a mere pup, so we decided to make this a father/son challenge. Once we arrived, we waited for about 10-15 minutes outside, which wasn't bad at all considering it was around 1pm. Once we were seated, we placed our orders and the food arrived in no time flat, piping hot and bursting full of flavor. My dad, being the old man that he is now, couldn't handle the burrito, so he only had a small sliver of it. I, on the other hand, ate about 3/4 of the plate at the restaurant (the rest would be consumed at home later). I have to say that I was deeply satisfied with the dish. I'm sure there are other places out there that offer better food, but honestly I was happy with this spot. Coming to El Tepeyac is about the experience, not just the food. There are few spots where the owner will come outside to meet, greet and seat you. The service and atmosphere here was warm and friendly and of course the food was delicious. Would I come here again? Most definitely.. Now that I've tackled the Manny's Special, it's time to see what else is good on the menu. Plus my stomach and toilet can't handle another offering like that for a while. Recommendations: The Chile Verde Manny's Special was pretty good.. Most of the meat was juicy and tender, but there was the occasional dry/tough chunk which would ruin that individual bite. On a side note: the guacamole here is THE BUSINESS.. Seriously, I was fixing to order a whole side of it to supplement my burrito.. Perhaps next time? Warnings: I was lucky for my first experience here to find parking and wait only a little bit, but from the looks of it, this place can get packed and the wait and parking can potentially be enormous headaches.

Loved it!! My friend took a shot of tequila with Manuel, and that old man is quite the riot. So full of life, and oozing with exuberance. God bless that mans soul, and let him live another 100 years. My friend and I split Manuel's Special burrito (chicken/pollo). So so so good! It was juicy and flavorful. The guacamole was so good, and the chicken was in strips. Oh man my mouth is watering just thinking about it! The service is also extremely amazing, but it helped that my friend knew Spanish. I just stared in amazement and confusion.

Manny was a little aggressive when I first came here. One of the waitresses had to calm him down! Other than that, the food was delicious! You really get your moneys worth here.

I am still feeling the after effects of eating a Manuel's special and drinking a crap load of beer. But it's a good thing. I have been going to El Tepeyac for years and I just found out that you can special order a Manuel burrito. They call it a foot long. So me and my pure genius thinking their foot long burrito is pretty much the same size as their Manuel's special, order 2 footlong's. Christ, the burrito was the size of Shaqs foot. Who knew they make tortillas that big, it was the size of granny panties, yeah I know not a very good visual. The cool thing about ordering a foot long burrito is that it comes in it's own little special aluminum container. And if any one has ordered a Manuel's special then you know that it usually comes on a cardboard plate wrapped in foil. Not the best way to take one home. The worst part of the night, was that I was at home watching the Lakers blow a 20 point 3rd quarter lead. I don't know if I will be able to look at a Manuel's special the same way. Ah well at least the food was good!

So, being that I work in Downtown Los Angeles I find myself eating alot of different types of mexican foods, asian foods, and at various burger and sandwich joints. Manual's aka el Tepeyac is one of the few places that I actually enjoy returning to from time to time. It's a great blend of flavors. To address the issue of flavor, I agree that this stuff is not a packed punch when you take a bite...and frankly I think this is one of the reasons why I enjoy this. I think we sometimes confuse "too satly" with flavor. perhaps a bit of salsa would help, but the more you add to it..the more your gonna take away.....as some are stating...the food has a lack of flavor for them to begin with. but the flavor of the sauce, meat, beans, cheese, guac, and rice are more than enough for me to enjoy. my only problem with this place is the cost of things...very pricey place to dine. i still think it's worth it to grab a burrito.....in fact our favorite thing to do is buy those HUGE $20 Hollenbeck that feed seriously more than 4 people here... I say go in there not expecting much and you'll be more surprised...i find when i build myself up to something too much I tend to disappoint myself. but this place is for sure one of the many spots that i return to often... it is a legend of los angeles after all!

I have been going to El Tepeyac for * years *... since around 1980. Some of the employees who worked there then are still working there. My favorites have always been: The taquitos with guacamole. Some of my mexican friends call these "tacos enrollados". I have tasted taquitos in many places over the years. I have never had any better than at El Tepeyac. Burrito de Machaca - this is shredded beef, mixed with onions, green peppers and eggs. Burrito de Chorizo - chorizo is a delicious mexican sausage. They mix it with scrambled eggs. I always tell them to hold the beans. I don't like burritos with beans. Torta de guacamole - this is a burrito with an omelette inside. The omelette is stuffed with guacamole. I think I have never seen this on any menu. Has to be an El Tepeyac original. I didn't read all the other reviews, but I am sure somebody mentioned MANUAL'S SPECIAL. 燭his is probably the most legendary burrito in the united states. If there is a more famous burrito, I'd like to know. I don't even think I have ever even SEEN this thing ordered by anyone, that's how rare it is. They take two flour tortillas, the size of elephant ears. They make a burrito out of those flour tortillas. The thing is so big, that it hangs over the side of the plate. The legend is - if you can eat one of these things, they meal is on the house. Something like that! 燭hey should keep a tally of how many people have actually been able to finish one of those things! Again - this is a truly legendary place in Los Angeles food lore. When you go there, you see people from all walks of life. You'll see nurses and doctors from Los Angeles County hospital which is nearby. You'll see police officers and firemen on their lunch breaks. You'll see local folks enjoying the food. You'll see people from all over southern california. And the mark of a truly hot spot - you will usually see a long long line snaking along the side of the building. HOWEVER - definately think before you look in the kitchen. If you look in the kitchen you might not want to eat there. I have taken friends there, and when they saw the kitchen they told me "NEVER AGAIN"... Never phased me! they're busy! They'll get around to cleaning it up when they have time! they're working fast in there! I highly reccomend this place. If this place ever shuts down, it's going to be a black day in Los Angeles history. Long live El Tepeyac Cafe

This restaurant is the reason I made a Yelp account. El tepeyac has a lot of hype and I treated my parents, girlfriend and I for a new years dinner here. 燭he wait was worth it as once you're in we were greeted by our lovely waitress. The place has tons of regulars as well as new customers. I had the Okie De Pollo which was A+ with a cup of Horchata that anyone else would charge 4 bucks for was $1.50. A kid at the table next to us finished the Manuel special and was given a free (And very fashionable El Tepeyac t-shirt) The food had great fresh and tasty ingredients and was served so politely, I must say this was the nicest waitress I've ever had. Anyone who says the food here is novelty and "quantity over quality" is insane, its delicious. Definite return! Definitely recommended! Come hungry!

a group of us waited outside in the freezing cold (judge however you will, i dont care if it was only 50 degrees out. It froze my nipples) 爄n the beginning of january. El Tepeyac was packed with people, it was at least a good 20 minute wait. A man stood outside, in line with us and asked how long the wait was. We told him 20 minutes. He said it was worth it. he wasnt kidding. We just wanted some delicious mexican food. AND WE GOT DELICIOUS MEXICAN FOOD. amongst the 6 of us, we shared the bigger manuel special. it was served on a aluminum party tray. it was glorious. bigger than my arm. The burrito was filled to pulsating-proportions of chile verde. It was then TOPPED with more chile verde. It came out in like 10 minutes. Goodness, the cooks are quick. The waitresses were just the friendliest people ever. They made sure we were happy and our cups were filled with water. really, what more could we have asked for? There's no doubt we're coming back. Can i take down a manuel special by myself? we'll see. But food challenges aside, this place is a go-to staple for anyone in LA. Hell, it's gotta be on everyone's bucket list.

I first heard about this place on man vs food. Thus, i decide to make it my mission to try it. Intially i wasn't expecting much since their specialty is an oversized burrito i though they were going to focus on quantity instead of quality. Luckily i was wrong. I got there and the place seemed really simple and 爏mall, 爄t kind of reminde me of the dinners that come out on movies. 營 was seated right away. When the moment came i decided to order the manuel special (that oversized burrito i was talking about) with steak instead of pork. The burrito was pretty big i think it can feed about 3 people. The service was nice and friendly and although the burrito wasn't the best it was pretty darn good. I would highly recomend to at least try it once.

Manuel's Special - Asada for $23 the taste of the burrito was okay-good... maybe we should have ordered a different manual's special. we saw another table ordering a different special and it looked pretty good. the fun part was just seeing the plate of 5 lb. burrito being served. we split it four ways..it was filling. I wish they have more cheese. The meat itself was kinda bland. But eating it w/ the sauce and other ingredients was good. It was quite heavy.. w/ all the beans and guac in the burrito...it was a bit too much .. like i'd be eating and enjoying in the beginning..but towards the last few bites..i was ughhhh.... i saw other tables in which they ordered just a reg. burrito.. omg..it was HUGE! yes, i'll come back here again.. but definitely not anytime soon... i'm burrito-out.

In Scottsdale the other day I was talking to this white guy who was from East L.A. (bizarre, I know). 燬o we started talking about what else -- El Tepeyac. 燱e talked about how we were raised on this shit. 燱e debated the merits of the Hollenbeck vs. Manuel's burrito. 燘ut ones thing is certain - El Tepeyac IS THE SHIZ! �The food is the BIZ-OMB and is almost TOO MUCH. I'm surprised that there's even a sprinkling of negative reviews. 燙learly you can't please everybody, 爏o don't be surprised by its distinctiveness or by long weekend waits, and plan accordingly. These burritos put San Francisco burritos to shame. 營 love the machaca burrito in particular. 燘ut even more I love that's it's far away from the Westside and Hollywood so it's not overrun by slummin-it hipsters. 燨nly the TRILL MOFOS make the pilgrimage for the Tepeyac.

El Tepeyac. The Original. This is an institution you MUST try once and return often to! Actually, I come here only for their addictive taquitos (preferably with beef) and the phenomenal guacamole that they generously furnish in abundance. I don't think this review needs to go into too much detail. What I'm recommending is very straightforward, will be well worth the trip (I live 30 miles away) and, well, let's just say it's DAMN GOOD! Besides, you can't be from L.A. and NOT have at least a passing acquaintance with them! So haul your fat a$$ there and eat up. EAT!

If you like your Mexican food authentic and your Mexican-restaurant decor tacky, then El Tepeyac is the place for you. The portions are massive, and the service is usually pretty quick. 燭here can be a wait to get in at times, but it's well worth it. 燤ake sure you're hungry, though. If you're afraid of the neighborhood, you aren't very familiar with East L.A.

My parents have been coming here since they lived in the 'hood back in the 1950s. To this day, Manuel still remembers them (or at least pretends he does!) and they adore this place. The first time they brought me here (their pocha suburban offspring!), I could see why. Look no further. This is authentic, Southern California Mexican food. It's pure East L.A. and it's AWESOME! �Get there early for a seat or you're gonna be waiting till lunch for your breakfast. If you're lucky, Manuel will come around and offer a shot to start the day right.

I LOVE LOVE LOVE El Tepeyac!!!! 營 was first introduced to this wonderful place by my fiance who grew up in Boyle Heights and I have loved it ever since. 燭his place is small so there is always a line, usually doesn't take too long to get a seat, but we usually sit at the counter and there is no wait. 燭hey also have an outdoor patio open for dining a take out. ��I need an El Tepeyac fix at least once a month so I have sampled many things of the menu...and they are all good. 營 usually get the Okie De pollo. 燭his is a huge burrito. 燛asily 8 or 9 inches long, 5" across, and 4" thick. 營 am a big eater and in my fatter daysI have come pretty close to eating the whole thing, but now I limit myself to half. 營t is stuffed, and I do mean stuffed, with tons of fresh real guacamole, chicken, beans, cheese, jalapenos, rice, and onions. 營f that is not enought it is smothered in cheese and enchilada sauce....MMMMMMM, I can taste it as I write this(note to self:must go to El Tepeyac soon). 燭hey also have two very good salsas and really good Horchata.

Called in for a pick up order of the Manuel's Special and Nachos. We got there 20 minutes later and the order was ready. My boyfriend's family and I were all excited to try the famous Manuel's Special since we've seen it on Man vs. Food. The burrito was huge and smothered with cheese and salsa, which was good. I excitedly took a bite only to taste the blandest burrito I've had!! It lacked taste and was too greasy! It was just like a huge pile of meat, rice beans and salsa, nothing more. The nachos were as greasy and not even crunchy!!! I don't know what's the hype but what I know is I got the worst heartburn ever after eating that I had to force the burrito out of me to feel better. Did we order the wrong things in the menu as I see a lot of 4 stars here?

I am so glad that El Tepeyac (or Manuel's, for those on the "inside") is on Yelp. I've been going there with my family my entire life...literally, my parents started going there since college & it became a family staple ever since. My parents will drive 2 hours round trip on a weekend just to stock up on burritos that will feed them for a week. Top Choices: Hollenbech Burrito - can definitely feed two, so decide beforehand if you want enough leftovers for a meal and a half or if you want to share � just take one (or two...) home with you. No point in splitting it to save money, however...the entire menu is extremely low priced. (burritos average $6-$8) Machaca Burrito - what can I say, it's like a bit of burrito heaven(there's also an equally delish Machaca tostada). Densely packed with meat and flavor, it's even more amazing with extra extra sauce upon request, and that goes for the Hollenbech burrito too Taquitos - Not only are the taquitos themselves uber fresh and delicious, it's enough to order them just to get the absolutely delish guacamole that comes with the plate. OHGOODNESS, so good! Enchiladas - my fave growing up until my stomach grew enough to accomodate even half of one of the burritos. The cheese stays melty and Ranchero sauce is perfection. Cheese, beef or chicken, never dissapointing. Things to know: *It gets super crazy and super busy, especially on Sundays, since it's across from a church, so be prepared to wait outside in line, first come first serve(service is super fast though). *They don't take reservations, but they do take to-go orders *Not in the best or most well-lit area, so be aware and mindful when going, especially later at night. *Wheelchair accessible outside (inside is densely packed but sometimes has room to accomodate & they are definitely willing)

The staff is very friendly and nice. The portions are huge. But that would be a deal if the food was good. This is your classic overly hyped place that is assessed on nostalgia and fond memories rather than the quality of its food. The food quality is not good, so the huge portions is a moot issue. Just because there are gunks of cheese on food you order does not make it a tasty and good Mexican dish; quite the opposite actually. If you go here, go for the legendary iconic status it holds. If you are going here looking for great tasting quality Mexican faire, it's not the place.

Probably the only place where I haven't been able to finish a burrito when I wanted to. 營 was at a loss for words the first time I tried a burrito but could not for the life of me eat it all in one sitting. Lately (by lately I mean the last three years) I've been particularly enjoying Machaca con huevo, a delightful dish of shredded beef. �Be sure to avoid going there on Tuesdays. 營've made the mistake of forgetting which day of the week they were closed to pull into an empty parking lot and feeling an dreadful pit of despair in my stomach for being such a knucklehead.

Rarely does a place meet the hype, this place does. It's not fancy, it's not gourmet, it's just good food, lots of it, and great service. We went here at 9 Pm (they close by the way at 9:45 during the week), we had seen it on the Travel Channel and thought it looked interesting, there is plenty of parking right next to the building but the inside is tiny, so if you go during the day, plan plenty of time, since I get the feeling that a lengthy wait will greet you. The service was fast, extremely courteous, and very attentivve. I had the 2 enchiladas (cheese and beef) with rice and beans and it was a massive amount of food, sour cream was on the side and they doled it out with an ice cream scoop. My friend had the Hollenback, and although it is not the 6 lb Manuel special it still weighed about 3+ lbs and was filled wiht pork and covered in chili verde sauce, the burrito took up an entire oval plate...and my friend had to finally push it away as he was stuffed to the point of near explosion but could not stop eating it. 燱e also had the chips and Guacomole and it was very good, with again bening a very healthy portion. As I said before the service was great, we were clearly not regulars but you would not have known that by the way that both waitresses treated us and made sure that we had everything we needed. So to sum up, these are the types of places that we should all go, it' not about name dropping, the latest crazy food fad from somewhere else or weird service. This is neighborhood place that welcomes anyone, anytime they are open and fills thier tummies with yummies and does not empty their wallet while doing it. Go get a big burrito it will cure what ails you.

GOOD LORD. I heard about this Manuel burrito about five years ago and it turns out I needed all five years to get my stomach ready for this bad boy. 燦o, wait... I take that back. 營 needed those five years to get my stomach ready for HALF of this bad boy. My cousin and I split this and I barely... managed... to finish my half. 燭hat last bite sat there for a good 15 minutes before I forced it in my mouth. 燦ow I know what Adam Richman feels like when he's down to the last bite in his challenges (apparently he shot an episode here as well). 燤y cousin, unfortunately, came up about 4 bites short. After a 20 minute wait Friday night, we ordered the Manuel and got everyone's attention when it came out. 燭he funny thing was, while we were waiting for it to come out, we saw other people's burritos and thought, "I wonder if that's the Manuel. 營f it is, it's not as big as I thought it would be. 燨n the other hand, if that's a regular burrito, it's freakin' huge!" We found out soon enough. 燳ou'll know the Manuel when you see it. 營t's over a foot long and its girth is no joke. 營 cut it in half and put it on my cousin's plate and it honestly felt like it weighed about 3 pounds (reminder, this was HALF the burrito). Covered in cheese and salsa with huge chunks of pork on the outside, and filled with more pork, cheese, rice, beans and guacamole inside, we're not just talking quantity... it actually tastes really good! 燭he pork was tender and everything else was very flavorful and made it enjoyable... at least until the last few bites. In my prime, I probably wouldn't have finished more than 80% of this. But then again, you never know.

To know El Tepeyac is to know burrito perfection. This little cafe hidden in the outskirts of E.LA has established itself as Burrito mecca. People from all over the county come to this place for one thing only. To enjoy the best burrito's in L.A. I have never actually conquered a full burrito. The massive size of these tank like beef wraps are just to much for me. 燚amn this feeble stomach of mine! This is no regular burrito my friends, this is infact the mother of all burritos. Theres usually a long line on the weekends, but if you call your order in you'll save yourself some trouble. SOme people are a tad hesitant to visit the area, but rest assured you'll be safe.

I'm not the biggest fan of Mexican food, period. But seriously... I have to say .. this place kind of blew my mind!! My bf was not kidding or over exaggerating when he described the Manuel's Special. I've never held a burrito on my lap like it was a freakin' large pizza... The thing was huge, delicious, cheesy, meaty, I could go on and on... But then I remembered I didn't like Mexican food (mainly because of the wierd mushy texture and smell of beans and taste of certain flour & corn tortillas...) all of that thought went out the window the minute I laid eyes on what my bf aka "The Burrito King.." calls "Burrito Heaven!"... He claims if he had to pick a death row meal.. this would be it. And that he could finish it all by himself in just one sitting. Although, I may disagree (just because I'm a true-to-my-roots-noodle-rice-spicy-loving-Asian-璯irl), I can defintely understand why! ;) Needless to say this was a pretty awesome experience and I was very impressed! I would defintely go back there again.. and recommend it for others to try! There is a reason why places like this have been in business for so long and their parking lot is always packed with people lined up around the corner. Good job, Manuel! You have won me over! O! And we also had the carne asada quesadilla! To die for!!! =)

I used to go around searching for the Chipotle that is most generous with their portion sizes because that meant I got a bigger burrito. No need for that now. Chipotle ain't got nothing on El Tepeyac Cafe's Manuel's special. Their XXXXL burrito was delicious. Me and my boyfriend shared the chile verde burrito and we gave up after eating half of it. We were defeated by our giant burrito and had shame written all over our face. Reason why I say this is because our waitress checked up on us every so often and i'd catch her smiling as she was walking away. She probably thought we were naive for thinking we could conquer the burrito like Adam Richman had. The wait wasn't bad for a Wednesday lunch. Decently packed though and there was a small wait. The owner, Manuel even came around and kicked out a table that was just sitting around after they had finished paying for their food. I wasn't too impressed by that but he redeemed himself afterwards by offering my boyfriend and I free tequila shots that we kindly turned down. Definitely try this place out when you're in the area but make sure you come on an empty stomach or with a big group of people!

Two enchiladas de pollo (or your choice) served with beans and rice and topped with huevos!!!! Protein heaven! The parking sucks usually on the weekend, but Manuel is really good at kicking people out once they are done eating if there is a line outside of patrons waiting to get their grub on.

We love Tepeyac! The food is pretty good but most people come here for the portion sizes. The burritos are bigger than your head! I ordered the Hollenbeck burrito with pork. The pork chunks were just too big to be enjoyed. My mom ordered the Hollenbeck de asada and the steak was chopped to tiny pieces. We ended up sharing hers and took mines to go (my dad ate it later). So hands down the hollenbeck de asada is my favorite. Word to the wise. Prepare to wait for at least an hour! Unless you sit at the counter. There's always room there. There's this cool guy who gives you free beer. I forgot his name. But he's nice. Ask for a "cervesita or tequilita" and they'll hook you up. Gracias tepeyac for yummy in the tummy food!

Good lord they make an enormous burrito. The pictures here really don't do it justice, and that's not a knock on the photographers it's really just that big. Me and two of my friends, one who eats a lot and one who doesn't, tried to conquer Manuel's Special, Machaca edition and were punished for thinking that we, mere mortals could challenge a god in burrito form. The damn thing was like 14 inches long and 6 inches wide stuffed with beef, eggs, rice, and beans topped with hella cheese and sauce. We probably got through 2/3 of it before he had to tap out. What's crazy is despite how ludicrously big it was, it really tasted pretty good. We also got the half order of guac which is alot of guac and some horchata, both foolish ideas considering how indomitable manuel's special was. The guac and horchata were both quite good though! check it out, get the giant burrito but make sure you have atleast 4 people with you and know that even then it will still be a bit of a challange what's crazy is the menu says serves 2-4. WHAT TWO PEOPLE COULD EAT THAT?!

I have to agree with most of the reviews about this place. Sure the portions are huge but the food is bleh. It could be that I'm extremely picky about my mexican food but when food is covered i a mountain of cheddar cheese and shredded iceberg lettuce it makes me question the flavor. Three of my friends and I ordered the Manuel's special and yeah it was huge... but I couldn't eat more than a couple of bites because it had little to no enticing flavor. 燭his place is way to hyped up for what it is, it's not worth the drive to East Los.

If I could give this place more than 5 stars I would give them 10. I had to wait in line to be seated (they do have take out, though) but it wasn't for long. I had the most delicious plate of enchiladas. My boyfriend said that you can always judge a Mexican restaurant by its rice and beans (just as you can judge an American or Italian restaurant by its bread). Everything was exceptional.

All I have to say is this place is AWESOME! I had the Hollenbeck burrito with chucks of Pork covered over the top with a green sauce. My girlfriend had the Hollenbeck De Asada burrito. Both burritos were huge and delicious. Price was correct for the portion of food you get, not to mention home cooked goodness. Parking lot and establishment are on the small side, and could very well have to wait outside to be seated, but all worth the wait. Service was prompt and Manuel himself tends to help out a lot. One other good thing about this place is sometimes you get a shot of tequila from Manuel who I think is the owner. ROCKIN! The location might detour some folks, but they don't know what their missing. If you like Mexican food with home style mom and pop cooking with a spontaneous atmosphere....this is the place!!

Named recently by ABC 7 as one of the seven best big portion places to hit up.. I checked it out last night. Man, I thought "Ten bucks for a two taco dinner plate? That's SO EXPENSIVE!" ...and then came out the actual plate. My jaw dropped. My boy J ordered the Hollenback which of course, even a triathlete couldn't even finish off. Poor guy had to take home a doggy bag. I say even if the place is as crammed as a sardine can (it's not that big), check it out Saturday night. It wasn't even that busy. We had to wait about 5-7 minutes, but no big. Portions definitely a PLUS! If I'd go back just for the food..ehhh.. maybe if the situation had arisen...and if I was in the area..and if I was with another person.. and if I had a craving for Mexican food. Lotttaaa 'ifs'. ---Update: 01/31/08--- Went here again last night on my boyfriend's whim. I stuffed up on some instant ramen before but sure, hey, why not get some big portions? The service here was SO much better than last night. Our waitress was extremely attentive to our needs. Instead of a small glass of water, we got the big coke glass worth. Because I was not so impressed with the tacos last night, I decided to try the "Hollenback de Pollo". Not liking guacamole, onions, or even excess beans, I expressed my wishes to the waitress. She went above and beyond and even suggested a few tips; like, instead of ordering extra guacamole, I should just have my guacamole on the side so J and I could share it with the chips. Smart. Why didn't we think of it? When she came out (much faster than I thought it'd take) with our food, she also supplied the salsa on the side because she remembered I didn't like onions - so if I wanted to, I could leisurely and at my own discretion pour the salsa on the Hollenbeck. She really impressed me. So half a Hollenbeck later, my full belly was about to burst. J was no better - only 2/3s finished with his. So this incident made me change my mind about the if's. Still it's preferable to have a companion since it is in East LA AND also depressing to eat that much alone. Probably another visit will cement my goodwill to the place. And while the Hollenbeck isn't the PERFECT burrito, it should be the epitome of Burrito With Huge Portions. P.S. Our bill came out to $20.02. I didn't have any change on me and neither did Jeremy so the cook simply waved it off. After all it was only two pennies. I know of places that would crucify you before coming to that conclusion. So for that this place rocks even more!

I guess the first thing I want to say is that the neighborhood didn't look the safest. I felt kinda uncomfortable only because there was lots of sketchy people hanging around the restaurant entrance. There was some creepy looking kid who kept looking into the main door (transparent glass) and obstructing it. That was sort of annoying. Although, when we entered the restaurant, the staff was friendly and the customers looked like "normal" people. The point of this paragraph is just be cautious. Be sure to park in the main parking lot (to the left of the restaurant) or on the street right in front of the restaurant--don't park far. Like I said, the neighborhood seems a little dodgy. Anyway, we ordered the Hollenbeck Burrito de Machaca. It was a good sized, wet burrito. It tasted pretty fresh and I only wished that it had a little more cheese, that would have made it perfect. It's also a portion fit for two people, especially if you're not the biggest eater like me. We were thinking about ordering some side dishes, but based on the reputation of huge portions, we thought we'd just attack only the burrito and be satisfied. So like other people, we came here because it was on TV. It was worth the trip and I would come back. This cozy restaurant does bring a family-owned feel and I believe it's high quality Mexican food. I wouldn't listen to the people who bash on this place--it's well worth a visit.

I went here with two friends that can put away their fair share of large meals. We ordered the Manuel Special, a huge burrito filled with pork and topped with, you guessed it, more pork! Usually, with large portioned food, quality is sacrificed with quantity. Not at El Tepeyac. This was a delicious burrito that is worth the trip to East L.A. The parking lot has a corner shrine to the Virgin Mary and I guess it's there to pray for your soul if you tried to finish the Manuel Special by yourself. My two friends and I ate two thirds of the burrito and we were full. We took the other third home and it took two more people to finish it off. A $20 burrito that fed 5 people is an awesome deal. If you are in LA, you gotta give this place a try!

As per recommendation of a friend's mom, we decided to have a culinary adventure and go here. This place is out of the middle of nowhere. Yes, this place is the size of a shoe box, but holy mole, was there a line out the door for both the take-out and dine-in lines. The take out line was going much faster, so we decided to stay there. I didn't seem like the dine-in line was moving much. The menu is LONG and extensive. It's a little overwhelming for first-timers. Prices are pricey at first glance, but considering how much food one gets, it's cheap. I order a Chicken Quesadilla, and my friend ordered some gigantic burrito. I have no clue what he ordered. So, we ordered, and grabbed a table outside. The weather was nice to sit outside. I think we were wating about 15-20 minutes for our food to be ready, and it was served to our tables. I'm completely shocked on how huge my quesadilla was. It was absolutely delicious, but I could finish half of it, and I saved the other half. It warmed up quite well the next day, but I ran out of sour cream. :\ Oh well. This place is well worth coming again. Bring your appetite AND your patience. Wait times might be long, but well worth it. Tasty tasty tasty, and if you eat like me, you can easily stretch out one meal into 2.

Others may rave about the Okie, or the Hollenbeck, or crispy tacos, but for me, El Tepeyac is all about one thing: the Machaca Burrito. This is the tastiest burrito anywhere. Shredded beef, tomatoes, onions, a little egg, beans, and I'm afraid, a good amount of lard. No healthy Mex here, just delicious authentic old school burrito served up with no pretentions and some good guacamole. Now I can't recommend this place without warning you about a couple of things: 1. Do not eat the whole thing. You will explode like the guy in the Monty Python movie. 2. Do not plan on staying awake, as you will need to sleep this burrito off. Could it be the lard? I live in Berkeley now. We have some good eats up here, but what wouldn't I give for a El Tepeyac machaca burrito!

The husband finally took me in this past weekend after talking about it for years. The line outside went pretty fast and the neighborhood is not that bad, but maybe I'm used to it from growing up on the hard streets of Rosemead. Yes, that's a joke. Real cozy and tiny inside. We were seated at a table in between a group of middle aged construction workers and a girl with huge boobs in a tube top. The giggling, whispering and turning of heads constantly kind of distracted me from my food a little bit.. I mean, I love a nice set just as much as anybody, but sheeesh..trying to stuff my face here. If you go, do not make the mistake I did by ordering a 1/2 side of guacamole (huge bowl!) with chips, and then the taquito plate. We barely made a dent in the stuff in front of us when she brings out the taquitos with the gigantic pile of quac on top. Yikes! Yes, the portions are huge. The rice and beans were tasty and the chicken in the taquitos was all white meat and they were the good fat ones. Next time, I'll try one of those burritos everybody is going on about.

Besides its huge portions, food is not that great. It doesn't matter if they have been around for 55 years....food is just mediocre at its best. 燘urritos and tacos all lack flavor.

Quite possibly the greatest burrito I ever had! All the ingredients were fresh and tasty: the carne asada, the rice, the tomatoes, the guacamole, the sour cream, the cheese, the red enchilada sauce, and of course, my favorite, the cilantro. This restaurant is a really nice, small tidy place located in a little neighborhood in East LA. Adam Richman once ate a 5-pound burrito, all by himself, and has a Manuel's Original t-shirt to prove it. Lo and behold, 3 friends and I ended up ordering the 5-pounder special burrito (which got us admiration from a table of females next to us). We obviously finished it (barely). I requested a t-shirt, but was generously denied. Oh well, I tried. On a side note, the salsa in the burrito had a hint of spice, but the good kind of spice that even a 5-year old can handle. Overall, this place is a 5-rating in my book because of the quality of the burrito. The service was also very friendly. The wait for us wasn't long at all since we came early. Ignorantly, I downed my Horchata beverage as the only downside in ETC - MO is that there is no bathroom. But with food that great, who needs to go to the bathroom? I can honestly say that I can give a 5-rating because after I ate my 1 1/2 pound portion of the meal, my stomach was not even bothered the whole day. I can't wait to go back.....

When I used to come here as a little kid I hated it. Why? Because I had to wait so damn long. I was a kid so I'd get bored and I was hungry and there was always a wait. But when we'd sit down I'd forget about that because I then focused on the biggest burritos I'd ever seen. My brother and I would always ask if we could get our own Manuel's special and, with a firm "NO" we would end up sharing it and still not be able to finish it. My dad would eat everything it seemed, including what was left of our burrito. Sure there's other stuff on the menu. But who cares. You need to come here, order a big ass burrito, lay back in your chair upon eating what you can, take a deep breath, hold it for a sec, then exhale. You have just completed consuming a piece of Southern California history.

After 200+ reviews you know this is a sacred place. It is literally, a whole in the wall joint that attracts all types of people. After watching the Man vs. Food my family decided this was a place we had to try. We drove up to East LA last night to watch my sister play vb and after all 10 of us caravaned over here. Warning: NO PORTION CONTROL HERE! My sister and her bf shared the Manuel's special to realize that the thing was bigger than her head! I had the chicken taquitos and took half home. Wonderful all white meat chicken and the beans and rice, just like my gma used to make. My mom had that Chile Rellano and my husband and dad had the Gringo burrito (i think that's what it was called), my brother in law had the enchiladas. Everything was delicious!!! Even took home enough for lunch and dinner that next day. The only reason that I gave it 4 stars is that there should be a warning outside telling you that will commit a sin coming into this place! Tip- Order from the Take Out window and sit outside. The line to eat inside is way too long. And be careful if you bring kids bc its not in the safest neighborhood. All in all- it is something you must experience. Delicious homemade Mexican food, but on steroids!

El Tepeyac Cafe is not just a great place for food, it's a whole dining experience. 燗s the other reviewers stated, you will probably wait about 20 minutes to get inside. 燞owever, that need not detract from your visit. 燭he friendly owner, Manuel, came out and was greeting guests. 燱e found that while in line you can order drinks and my friend even got a beer on the house. My husband, friend and I split a full order of guacamole with warm tortilla chips and a Manuel Special burrito with the Original Chili Verde (pork shoulder). 燭he three of us barely put a dent in the heaping plate of fresh guacamole and managed to finish nearly 3/4 of the DELICIOUS burrito. 燗ll pork should taste that good! 燱hen we asked to have our leftovers wrapped up, Manuel himself insisted on putting the remainder in a new tortilla, and we left with a burrito hefty enough to satisfy all of us for dinner that night as well! 燯pon paying our check, each of us received a few pieces of candy to finish off the meal. 燨ur waitress told us that it was tradition. El Tepeyac Cafe (especially it's friendly owner) gives customers the feeling of sitting in the middle of a great family reunion...if your family makes the most amazing Mexican food ever. 燳ou can't fake the kind of atmosphere, and for that alone I highly recommend that you visit. 燱ell, that and the chili verde. 燡ust trust me!

The buritos at El Tepeyac are more renowned for their size than their quality but that doesn't mean this place isn't worth a trip.

Wow that was a big burrito, It was huge! but way too much rice in it. I am not a fan of rice in a burrito. There are alot of other things to try on the menu that are good. I know this because I tried everyone elses food. Its fun to order something you see on tv show. After taking pictures of this monster. I dug in, Its like a plate of food rolled into a burrito. Actually a couple plates of food. Overall the service was great and other peoples plates were better. I also had a great time sitting on my vacation and going somewhere with my family to experience something new. Try the Chile Rellenos. Try the tacos, they are all good. But for fun if you are with a bunch of people try the big burrito but tell them not to pack it with rice. Unless you like rice burritos.

I don't eat here as often as I used to (something about not wanting to have a heart attack...) but I still indulge at least once every other month or so. The plates are huge, and the burritos can feed a small army any day of the week. I live about two blocks from here and when I'm running especially late for work, I always make up for it (and distract my boss) by bringing in a Machaca Manuel's Special as a breakfast treat. The food is authentic, and they offer all the traditional options, all of which are pretty good. It sucks that there's always a line, though. If I don't feel like waiting, I opt for sitting in the patio section even though there's no waiter service.

I ate at El Tepeyac earlier this year on my birthday with my family. First of all, it really is a hole in the wall type place. Thats not necesarily a negative. Its popularity and the fact that it is tiny means there will be a wait, most likely a very long wait outside on the street. Again, its all good. Its what you expect from a local mom & pop type place. The Good part is that the staff was very friendly. The prices are dirt cheap. The food really did have a homemade taste and of course the portions were enormous. The So-So part is that the food tasted only OK. In fact it was a bit of a letdown. Nothing tasted bad, but with all the buzz and hype we were expecting something that really knocked our socks off. It wasnt bad, just not worth a trip to Boyle Heights. Maybe if i lived in the area i'd frequent it. The bad part, and the reason i knocked it down a star is that the dishes were very inconsitent. Four of us ordered the same dish: the Hollenbeck Burrito with pork. Some of them were mostly meat and little avocado and some were mostly avocado and little meat. You'd think that four exact burritos ordered and served at the same time would resemble each other.

Manny's! 燭he first time I came here, I came with my PE coaches from the nearby High School. 燭he second time I came here, I got lost looking for a sign that said "Manny's" instead of "El Tepeyac Cafe". 營 had to pull over and ask someone where to get my Hollenbech burrito. �) 燭he man pointed and said Manny's is that way. �Everything has already been said. 燭he portions here are huge. 燗nd for a little Chinese girl like me, it's enough to feed me Monday-Wednesday, lunch & dinner. 燘ut you've got to try it at least once. 燭ostadas are good too... and I'm usually not a fan of deep fried hard shelled stuff like taquitos- but duuuude. 燭he taquitos here are good. 燗nd the guac? 燨ff the hook. 燡ust be willing to share because you'll need to.

I've never dined inside, but I'll never forget the shaded alleyway leading to the takeout window. I'm happy to see how popular this place has become. True East L.A. atmosphere, novelty burritos, and some really good guacamole. Have eaten here since I was in diapers. Listen to some oldies while you eat your taquitos for the full effect.

This is a small neighborhood restaurant. It gets raves for it's burritos, hard shell beef tacos, taquitos, and chili relleno. The food is basic "East Los Angeles." Home style "Chicano" food, 爀verything is served with refried beans and spanish rice. Most dinners are served on big platter style plates and the meals are generous. You'll want to stick with the basics here. Don't get fancy and you won't be disappointed. Stay away from the seafood.....order a burrito or a basic combo plate. Come hungry and eat lots of chips. They also have some of the best guacamole in all Los Angeles. This is not gourmet mexican food. Its not "upscale" food. You won't find this stuff all over the city. Just some places. It's meaty, cheesy, greasy, fried, 燾hili drenched, comfort food goodness. The place is small, cramped, and can get noisy. The jukebox is sometimes too loud with horrible mexican music coming out of it, the waitresses have been working here for years. Pictures of family and locals line the walls...as well as photos of certain Boyle Heights cultural touchstones. This place is historic...its part of the fabric of the city. You either "get it" or you don't. If you do...and love a good wet burrito, order an Okie or a Hollenbeck. 燳ou'll be coming back for many years.

There was a wait to get in the restaurant, which many have detailed, but it was all a part of the experience. Each person in line had their own story- how they found the restaurant, whether it was their first time, and what they were wanting to try. The waiters and waitresses were all so friendly. I sat at the bar with a friend, and we enjoyed the hollenbeck burrito, as well as the cheese enchiladas. My friend raved about how great the enchiladas were, especially since they had real cheese. My friend liked the rice too in that it had a very authentic taste to it. The hollenbeck was great. Who else tops a burrito with meat (and sauce)?

Large portions, well seasoned meat, friendly staff with quick service, and reasonably priced for the portion size. The burritos are ginormous. 營 tried the "okie de" and "hollenbeck" burritos. 營 prefer the okie de because the enchilada sauce added some sweetness to the burrito. 燭he guacamole is flavorful with the right consistency of creaminess and chunks of avocado. 燭he chips are crispy and perfectly dusted with salt. I came in and immediately found seating at the counter, but when i left (around 4pm on a Monday) a line of at least 10 people had formed.

Man vs. Food. 燭he reason we came here. Walk in and you see a very small dining room that would probably remind you of a small bar in the middle of Mexico City. 燦ot saying that's a bad thing, it adds the the ambiance and the feeling that you are truly eating something authentic. 燱e went with the sit down service (you can get walk up window service right next to it) on a Sunday afternoon. 燱e went at the right time because 10 minutes after we were seated, there was a 10 person line. �So... what did we get here? 燭he Manuel Special 燱hat else? 燨n Man vs. Food, he describes to us a huge 5 lb burrito that he states, is "full of flavor". 燦ormally you'd expect not very much taste or not a great quality burrito out of something so monstrous, but they do not fail in delivering this novelty of a blow to the gut with a decent flavor. �I will always love and be biased towards Lolita's 燭aco Shop in SD, but this place still delivers with something enjoyable. 燱e had 4 people share one burrito and all walked away stuffed. 燦ot only was the Manuel Special HUGE, but the normal burritos are also a pretty decent size. 營f you got 3 people, go for the Manuel and share it, otherwise, go for the normal. The Asada leaves a little more to be desired without the hot sauce but still not bad.

OK....so I know not a lot of people agree with how good this place is. 燘ut I love and miss going here. 營 work in a hospital near the neighborhood. And maybe it tastes wonderful to me since I was introduced by the people who grew up in the same area and love this local spot. 營 guess it's almost like watching a movie. 燬ome might get the humor and some just find it cheesy, so if you're watching it with the wrong person, you might end up seeing it the way they did cuz they'll keep commenting of how bad the movie is. 燛veryone who comes to this local spot, grew up in the neighborhood. 營t's almost like a sense of tradition. My favorite is their signature "Manny Special". 燘ut I always buy the chicken since I don't like pork. 營f it's your first time trying their burritos, it's a bit on the wet side since they serve it big and the meats are soaking in it's juices. 營t's prepared differently! Of course! 爄sn't that what you expect from any other restaurants you go to? 燬till....I miss this place. And watching Man Vs.

I agree with fellow Yelpers: The wait was awful and very long 45 min-1hr. But, after sampling the taste bud glory of the Hollenbeck Burrito, I am completely satisfied. I couldn't even dent this thing, and I mean it's huge; People aren't exaggerating that it won't fit on a plate (it takes 2). The flavors explode in your mouth, the meat is tender and juicy, the beans and cheese ooze from the tortilla - it's just sloppy perfection. If you haven;t been there - GO, if you we're told it's not good - GO, if you are skeptical - GO!

My girlfriend and I saw this place on Man v. Food a while ago and finally got to try it. Not the best Mexican food I've had but it's good. This place is a true hole in the wall diner. The service was so friendly and the atmosphere so genuine I felt like a child eating mama's Mexican food (even though I'm Chinese). At first I thought the prices were a bit steep, but then I saw how generous the portions were. $9 for the BIGGEST burrito I've ever seen in my life and $7 for two decently sized taquitos plated with a HUGE mound of guacamole... yum... definitely worth it.

I've only ever heard tales of El Tepeyac Cafe. Burritos the size of an infant child, etc.. 燘ut as a K-Towner, its hard to get me to leave my little comfort zone. But this weekend, we made the drive to East LA for burritos. I did my research and thanks to the recommendation from Los Angeles Magazine, went with the machaca burrito (the standard size- which is still larger than burritos from most other places!) 爄t was DELISH! shredded beef & scrambled egg mixture with beans. 燬eemed more of a breakfast-y type burrito to me, but delicious nonetheless. my boyfriend went with the chicken burrito in the larger size (the size of a cafeteria tray!!) Shredded chicken, tons of cheese on top. He liked it, I thought it was just ok. Total was about $30 which seems INSANE to me to spend on burritos. but then again, we had enough leftovers for the remainder of the holiday weekend. �go with the machaca burrito! will not disappoint!

5 star for the people that work there... we were fortunate enough to have an awesome waitress who popped our cherry since it was our first time there... SA-WEET... 3.5 stars for the food... it's aiight. Averages around 4.25. It's like I stepped into a set of the Land of the Lost since all the portions were bigger than a Black Man in a room full of Asians. What to order: The Manny Special (Pork): $16.00 bucks. The only bigger will be the turd that comes out later... About 5lbs of pure MEAT MEAT MEAT that will make you NOT want to be on a Lo-Carb diet... evvvverrr. This burrito was just OKAY... not too much flavor and the meat was kinda dry and flavorless... the only reason this is worth buying is to see if you can bet your friends you can finish it and hopefully win some money. The taquitos: *sidenote: i didn't order these, but the dood next to me sitting at the bar had them, and they looked so good and huge. These looked like my obese aunt's fingers... wide and chubby. Even the crunch sounded appetizing and I sooo wanted to order it... too bad I had to worry about preventing a F*CKIN' HEART ATTACK from trying to finish my Manny Special...

This is where you take your friends who don't know a lot about LA if you want to impress them. This is where you take the uninformed, the inexperienced, and you overwhelm them with the sheer magnitude and power of FREAKING GIANT BURRITOS! The place is usually crowded, but if you can make it for lunch, you'll usually get pretty good service. The food is, as everyone else is saying, enormous, but not without flavor. For the price, it's really a good deal. The two best burritos are the Hollenbeck and the Manuel Special, which you should definitely order if you want the best experience (because other reviews have said the food is somehow lacking, and I'm assuming they didn't get either of these two) Anyway, it's a good place to eat if you're hungry, and a GREAT place to take your friends if they somehow haven't heard of it, or if they're not from the area. (so the 4-star rating would be 5 stars in the latter scenario)

This is my favorite restaurant. The Hollenbeck, as has been mentioned, is nothing less than mythical. What makes this restaurant great is the attention to detail. With the Hollenbeck, you not only get tender, delicious pork, but rice and beans of a quality that rival those of the best home cooks, tasty guacamole flavored by fresh avocado and cilantro, and, the huge portions for which this restaurant is famous. I highly recommend adding cheese-they use fresh cheddar grated in such a way that it melts perfectly over the burrito and under the chile verde. Other gems on the menu are the machaca and chorizo burritos, the Hollenbeck de asada and Hollenbeck de pollo, and the tacos. I very highly recommend this restaurant not only for its food but for the atmosphere, exceedingly friendly and expedient service, and the fact that it is a true staple of Los Angeles dining. Anyone who knows of a better Mexican restaurant, please let me know as I'd love to try it. Best wishes and God bless.

The title of this review should be the best, because, Manuel's is the best. �Not only have my parents been taking me to Manuel's since I was a little whippersnapper in diapers, they used to go to Manuel's when they were dating 30+ years ago. 燭his place is truly classic and among the elite landmarks for eateries you must try. �Where to start? 營 guess with the tacos folded since those are what I religiously order. 燭wo freshly fried corn tortillas filled with the best shredded beef around, fresh sliced & diced lettuce and tomato (always super fresh and crip), and some fresh shredded cheese. 燭hey might sound simple but these are the best tacos ever. 燫ice and beans are also served with the tacos and they are not your ordinary rice and beans either. 燗s you know by now, El Tepeyac has been around for days, they have rice and beans down to a science. 營 hate to keep saying they are the best, but seriously, everything about this place is so fn good.

I still don't understand what the big deal is with this place. The day that I came there was a line to get in. I ended up sitting at the counter. This place is very small. I believe I had the Taco plate. The food was fine but I wouldn't say it is great or the best Mexican food I ever had. My moms tacos are better then the ones served here. I think this place is highly overrated. This is one of those LA places that everyone need to try once so they can judge for themselves. Personally I didn't think it was anything special.

Everything on the menu is MASSIVE! I'd suggest to share any plate with someone in your party. We first started with the 1/2 guacamole with chips for the four of us. I shared the Hollenbeck de Asada burrito, minus beans, and also the small size of menudo. The guac was legit. It was straight up barely but good enough mashed avocados with minimum amount of tomatoes. For me, it definitely lacked flavor. It was just the strong avocado taste, I like a little lime and salt in my guac, so it was average for me. I know some people who love guac the way its made here then it is most definitely off the hook. You won't find a place with generous amounts of avocados like that in your guac. The burrito was huge. It is the size of my fore arm. Dear Lord, it was a lot to take in. There was a sauce over the burrito, with some asada on the side, with cooked veggies (onions and tomatoes). Taking the first bit of the burrito, it was mediocre. The flavors were good but nothing that screamed amazing. Most of the burrito was just rice, had really less meat. I felt like I ate a whole bucket of rice. I wish there was more meat and some salsa in the burrito. I tried the menudo. It was good. My first time trying it and there were all kinds of crazy chunks of I don't know what exactly. The flavor was the hominy flavor, rich corn tasting. I liked that they gave you a plate of onions, cilantro, and lemons to add to the bowl. It was alright, I didn't know what it would taste like and now I finally tried it. I wanted it to be more sour though. Next time, lime and more of it. We also ordered Horchata. It was YUMMY! I love horchata but this one was exceptionally tasty. No refills. You have to savor every bit of it. Overall, it was a good experience but like I said, it was not amazing. There is always a first for everything. I feel like here is about the quantity rather than quality of food. They need to specify or describe a little more on the menu of the sauces they put on the burrito. If its spicy but a little chili pepper next to it or something. -Well, Give it a try. Judge for yourself. P.S. Wait outside the door if there is no seating. They don't take numbers or names, you just wait by the door and they just take whoever is next in line.

This place makes me proud to say that I have some Mexican blood running through my veins. In all their delicious enchilada sauce, gigantic burrito, beautiful guacamole splendor I can say I am a big fan. I have been coming here all my life and can honestly say that I believe Manuel's is the BEST place for Mexican food. (Other than my momma's kitchen.) I don't care if I have to wait outside to be seated inside. I don't care if the thugs in the parking lot are scary. And I don't care if the hungry people ahead of me in line are getting rowdy. All I care about is when I am finally seated and that plate of beef enchiladas and eggs sunny side up are placed in front of me, I am in Mexican food heaven. It is impossible not to leave satisfied. The food and service live up to the hype, and if you don't think so, go ahead and get your head checked. Go on, i'll wait.

We waited over an hour for a table, but we were told it was worth the wait. The food was good, it would have been better if we had ordered a couple of burritos and shared, the serving sizes are huge, the burritos are huge, everything was huge..except the place, very small, only a few tables and a counter. The service was quick, we had our food within 15 mins of ordering. It would be a good idea to order ahead of time and take out if you are from the area, there is a walk up order counter and tables outside to sit down to eat, that is a better idea than waiting for a table inside.

If there was a reason why the stereotypical view of a Mexican is a fat bearded fella with a sombro sleeping under a tree it's because they just finished off a Manual's Special from El Tepeyac. Now with a couple other locations the original still holds strong as one of the best places to eat in East L.A. But that's only because Yelp doesn't have the technology to follow all the movements of the 'roach coaches' that wander around the land serving up tasty tacos. I'm reading a lot on here that folks are afraid of the area because it's those mean streets of East L.A. Maybe I'm just used to the area living near it for the majority of my life but I really have never seen anything bad go down near here. So pay no mind to the warnings of the area. Besides, after eating here you'll be well prepared to meet your maker. The place is small and you will have to wait in line outside at peak hours and even most non peak hours. But it's worth it. Tuesday was when it was always closed but I swear the other week when I drove by there was a line outside on a Tuesday. Maybe they couldn't read a closed sign? The burritos are great, have they be on the super human portions that you have no chance in hell in finishing off. That's not to say that large portions make good food. You're not losing anything in the quality when you're bumping up the quality. Forget the outside dinning here. It's really taking away from the experience and from my attempt to try it once, the taste in the food was slightly different.

El Tepeyac is located on the border of a residential part of East LA, near a cemetery and some of their main streets. 燭here is street parking available without meters. 燭here is indoor seating with tables and chairs as well as a counter. 燭hey've also got a small patio available outside. 營t's not a fine dining experience, but it is an experience to eat there. 營t's a community favorite. I've only tried their Manuel's Special One Foot burritos. 燭hey taste ok, but nothing amazing. 燩eople I know love them, but really... I think it's the novelty of the size. 燭he burrito contains rice, beans, and guacamole. 營t's topped with lettuce, cheese, sauce, and tomatoes. 燭he cost varies depending on which meat you pick, if any ($20-36). They have an extensive menu including several vegetarian options, however after my visit I confirmed that they use lard to cook their rice and beans. 燜or that reason, I would not recommend it for vegans or vegetarians.

1 star for the service 2nd star for being on man vs. food 3rd star for the portions Tried the manuel's special with the steak picado, and it was okay. Sadly we didn't know that the burrito was going to be really saucy, which kind of ruined the burrito for the bf and I. My bf and I shared the burrito, and barely could finish a quarter of the burritio and we eat A LOT! The burrito itself was 25 bucks, but it was worth it for the portion. I would recommend the manuel's special, because it's an experience worth experiencing.

I grew up eating El Tepeyac. My mom used to bring home the Okie burrito for me OR their yummy tacos. There's a smaller location in Alhambra off Palm (near the Costco there). So, I already knew what I was getting myself into by FINALLY visiting the OG location in East LA. There was a line going way around the building... its a small little "mom and pop" shop so its hard to get a table especially during those popular eating times. We got a table probaly within 30 min. I ordered the Hollenbeck which is TO-DIE-FOR. It is very moist and tender and oh so yummy with all the fixin's inside. The guacamole adds an extra nice flavor to the burrito. The hot sauce is very good as well. Everyone else had the hollenbecks as well.. one other person ordered the Okie. Everyone with us was pleasantly surprised and satisfied. My mom will come to this location to pick up the Manny's Special for office parties and such. GREAT idea to share it (like a party sub). Perhaps I will do that for my work when we have our next event! Carne Asada, Machacca, or Carnitas all the way! I'm craving it... perhaps we'll take another visit tonight!

I ate at Manuel's today for the first time in years...it's almost as charming as I remember. The service is affected greatly by the size of the dining area and how busy they are. Also, they charge for chips and salsa- serperately!!! Considering where they're located, that should be a crime! I had the nachos. They were delicious- layered perfectly, not a dry chip on the plate! Though, the chile verde was a bit dry. Next time I might opt for the chicken instead. Also, they have a famous local challenge. The Hollenbeck special burrito. If you can finish the family size (serves 2-4) in 1 hr, it's free, you get your photo on their hall of fame and a cool t-shirt!

So in Chicago, there's this taco joint called La Bamba that proudly claims that they have "burritos as big as your head". They clearly haven't seen the burritos at El Tepeyac. It's guaranteed bigger than your head and could be mistaken for a log. I have yet to stray from the Hollenbeck. It's hard to tear myself away from such a good thing. Chalk it up again for my former coworkers back in the day...they really knew how to take care of me when it came to lunch. I love the dining room!

Ok so here's the thing. Went to El Tepeyac for my 21st birthday. My friends and I were alll excited because of the huge burritos. I got a simple bean and cheese burrito but they attempted to split the Manual Special. It was good for a laugh but the food itself is only just ok. I mean as fast as our food came it's obvious that they just have vats of refried beans, cheese, etc. sitting in the back and it's more assembly than preparation. I tried to eat more of my burrito the following day and it was just not good. I got a bit nauseous actually. Good for the *experience*, but probably won't go back.

This place is famous for Manuel's Special. It's a huge ass burrito that feeds about 5 regular sized Asians and 3 very hungry Asians. The Burrito is like the size your your head and I believe it's 5+ pounds. The Guacamole Chips are also very good. It has a very fresh taste to it. Parking on the other hand is a pain in the butt during busy hours. They do have a private lot but it does get packed and if you're not a very good driver you might run into some problems because it is kind of tight. There are plenty of parking around the neighborhood though. We had a group of 7 people and we had to wait awhile. It was about a 20-30 minute wait. Well worth it though. If you come here with just one other person it'll be a quick wait. Manuel seemed like a very nice guy. He was joking with us when were in line and when we sat down. I even saw him offer some shots to some regulars.

After begging me for over a year, I finally obliged my husband and let him take us to El Tepeyac Cafe for dinner last weekend. 營 wasn't stoked about the neighborhood from the get go, and it was not any better than I imagined. This restaurant does a major business!! 燭he tables were full the whole time we were there and there was a line outside waiting to get in. 燨nce we finally made it inside, I felt totally cramped. 燭hey have tables back to back and it's claustrophobic. Now on to the food... my first impression was that they don't give you chips and salsa while you wait!! 燗las, I ordered a combination with a taco and enchilada. 燤y plate was messy looking and I really didn't know where to begin. 燭he taco and enchilada were good...the beans and rice were bland. 燘ut man do they give you a ton of beans and rice!! My husband ordered the Hollenbeck burrito and he enjoyed it well enough, but he felt the chile verde lacked verde. �After seeing all of the great reviews we may give them another shot. 營 think I need to skip anything with rice and beans and have a taco and taquito ala carte because the meat was really good. �Service was friendly but very slow and the prices were reasonable.

Went to this restaurant on a Sunday afternoon to sample their hollenbeck burrito. I ordered the beef one and my wife ordered the chicken. Both plates arrived in a timely manner smothered with lot of salsa. Almost to the point the burritos were floating in that salsa. I gave my wife a half and she gave me a half. This way we sample two for the price of one. The portions were very generous. The service was bare minimum (no refills offered on our soft drink or water). The price was very reasonable. And that's were the positives end. Both burritos contained a very small portion of shredded meats. Barely enough to fill a soup spoon. The meats were tasteless. Our burritos were mostly filled with rice. Very little bit of re-fried beans. Ended up by scooping the meat out and leaving much of the rest of the burrito on the plate. We declined the doggy bag! Since we left this place dissatisfied, we headed to El Taco Llama and had their burritos. We enjoyed them much better than at this place. If we are in the area, we might give this place another try for fairness. However, we will not make a major effort to go there.

I have been going to EL Tepeyac for some time now and the only thing i have tried is the machaca burrito. The reason being that i simply love this burrito. The taste never gets me bored or tired. 9 dollars for a burrito sounds expensive but imagine a burrito that barely fits in Chinese take out plate without the borders or slots or separators whatever they call them. The salsas for the burritos are green and red with unique tastes but both compliment the burrito very well. This place IS kid friendly and adult friendly as well ( being that the owner himself gives shots of tequila to those who look old enough and candy those who dont). If you go during peek lunch hours or weekends be prepared to wait inline for at least 30 mins not including the search for a parking spot.

We saw this place on TV, of course, and decided to try it out since my BF lived in LA for 20 something years and never went there (or heard of the place.) 燱e've been there twice now, and the first time there was no line as it was in between lunch/dinner times. Yesterday we went around 1pm and there was a line, but it went quick. The dining area is very small. Do not attempt to take a huge group and be seated quickly because it's just not going to happen. Unless they have some secret seating area there, which I didn't see. 燩icture a room about 30feet long, 25 feet wide, with a bar seating area, that's it folks. �The Food: Their specialty of course is Manuel's special. A pork chili verde burrito with guacamole in and their ranchera sauce. Hmm...now thinking about it, there are two sauces, red sauce and ranchera. I ordered the two cheese enchiladas and they were perfect! 燘F ordered the hollenbeck (pork w/ red sauce) and he loved it! The portions are huge. Yesterday we brought along his niece and they split Manuel's special. They served it in a lasagna pan and brought it on a cardboard box!!!! 燭he two of them only ate about a quarter of it and we took the rest home to Vegas where we live. 燳esterday, I had the vegetarian burrito which had rice, beans, cheese, and guacamole. Delish! I was only able to eat about a quarter of it. I'm not lightweight, I can easily put down 4 slices of pizza, so you can imagine how big the burritos are. Yum! We'll be back!

I just got back from lunch at Tepeyac, where I put my body through the cardiovascular equivalent of a triathlon. As I type this, I'm debating whether to close the door to my office and sleep it off for an hour, or just call it a day and head to gym to atone for my gluttony. To be fair, I have no one to blame but myself. I come here every couple of months for lunch with coworkers, and we all gorge ourselves beyond the point of discomfort. It's a barbaric ritual that I'm not entirely proud of. The funny thing is, I'm not a fan of burritos and the food here is inconsistent at best. So why keep coming back? For the same reason that I serve dry turkey every Thanksgiving -- it's comforting. A couple of words of wisdom. First, order the machaca burrito or machaca plate. Machaca is the name of the game at El Tepeyac. Secondly, and it's clear that I'm incapable of following my own advice here, draw a line down the center of your plate and eat only half. 燭ake the rest home. 燭here's no shame in restraint.

The only place where burritos are to be savored. El Tepeyac makes enormous burritos. The Hollenbeck burrito is in a class all by itself. I was first introduced to this little cafe by friends form Long Beach who'd family makes the drive on a regular basis just for dinner. There is no other place like it.

I had my doubts because just because it's big doesn't always mean it's going to be good. i actually expected it to be bland but surprisingly it was very flavorful. we ordered the pork (recommended by the waitress) and split it in two... it did not disappoint. unfortunately i couldn't finish my half... came up several bites short. i know i know... maybe next time.

Like many things and places in Los Angeles, El Tepeyac is really more about memories than realities. . . . . . so one day back about 1967 or 68 one of my Dad's truck drivers is telling him about this great place to eat on the East side. �Great Burritos Frank, big with anything you could want." �"OK', my Dad said, 'pick me up two each for the boys and one for me and another for the wife." "These Burritos are big Frank, people usually split 'em." My Pop tells the guy fine, just pick us up three, the kids are big eaters. 營 don't know what he told the driver when he saw the standard paper supermarket bag half full and requiring two hands to handle, but I do remember the thing came complete with a stack of paper plates, about ten plastic forks, and enough napkins to diaper a baby rhino. 燚ear Lord, were those babies amazing. 燜ull of beef and pork and cheese and avocado and, zoweee! My first personal visit was a couple years later acting like an East Side College kid in the mid 70's. 燛l Tepecyac was always a grand place to take an out of town visitor to demonstrate my street creds as an LA local and a veterano of all things east. 營t was also pretty safe due to the fairly steady stream of LAPD cops from nearby Hollenbeck 燚ivision. Things started to change a little during the Clinton Administration although I'm not certain it's fair to attribute the changes specifically to slick Willy. 燭here was a time back in the day when Manuel would offer some of the diners a belt, usually tequila, (no booze on the menu), just as he probably would have at home. 燭he last time I was there, maybe three years ago, Manuel was still around but the jug had been replaced with a plastic jar of candy from Costco. The chow, while still fresh and quite good, wasn't quite the world beater I recalled either. 燭he big Manuels Special seemed filled with rice rather than meat, the Machacas dry and the enchiladas stingy. 燤y fave, the Hollenbeck pork, was still terrific; saucy and full of pork chunks. 燩rices, a little high for what you got compared 爐o other places serving the same basic fare. 燨verall a worthwhile experience at least once, but not one I go out of my way for any longer. These days, I take visitors to La Golondrina or 燛l Cholos, (either location), for "atmosphere", and maggies. �If they are foodies, we head to La Casita in Bell. �If they really want the "experience" we do a taco truck or hit King Taco after a Dodger game.

Manuel's El Tepeyac on Evergreen... Makes me full just thinking of those monstrous burritos. If you're in the Boyle Heights area, GO and you won't be disappointed. Expect a line because it's a pretty popular place. Especially since Man vs Food ruined it for all of us who've been going there for years... Oh well. I always get the machaca burrito. MY FAVORITE. Shredded beef, eggs, onions, rice and cheesy goodness. This burrito can cover me for TWO meals. No lie. And I can hold my own... And this isnt even the Manuel's special machaca which probably would feed me for 5 meals. It's good. Try it. Respect the tried and true joints of Los Angeles. There's a reason they have withstood the test of time.

I have yet to actually eat inside the joint. We usually just saunter up to the takeout window and either eat at the little side tables or take our spoils to go. After my dad took my bf and I to the Giants/Dodgers game (go TIMMY!) we headed to El Tepeyac, because I knew a big guy like my dad would LOVE some cheap and good eats. Ended up taking everything back to my parents' hotel and shared a nice family style meal. Even their "normal" size burritos are huge...the Manuel special is pure crazy.

The food is good, and it's a nice family atmosphere. A group of us finished off a Manuel Special Burrito, which is a feat that the average human should not try by himself or herself. The burrito itself was good but not great. It's kind of located in a place that's inconspicuous, but that's part of its charm, I suppose. There's nothing bad about this place. It just wasn't spectacular for me in any sort of way.

I'm so lucky that I live very close to El Tepeyac. The food here is just amazing and you could never go wrong with any item on the menu and 爐he prices are very reasonable. Also they now accept credit cards. My favorite has always been the Manuel Special burrito. You can feed a small family or in my case feeds 2 very hungry guys with that. My best friend and I came here last night and took one home plus a 1/4 order of guacamole and chips. We totally consumed the whole thing in a matter of minutes.

We were excited to go to El Tepeyac ever since we saw it featured on Man v Food, because my husband couldn't resist the temptation of taking on one of Manuel's Special burritos. I like Mexican food, but he could eat it for breakfast, lunch and dinner and still love it. That said, he got about a fifth of the way through his Machaca burrito and couldn't eat a single bite more. Not because of the size of the thing, but because it was so tasteless and dry. We waited outside for that? I got the Carne Asada quesadilla and the meat quality was really bad. I had about five mouthfulls and two contained chunks of gristle and fat. The flavor was pretty bland although the best thing about it was the cheese. This place was a huge disappointment. I think we'll be sticking with our local SFV Mexican joints from now on.

My best bud took me, El Burrito Aficionado, to this spot a couple of months ago. The indoor dining room is really tiny, so naturally, there was a line that formed outside. It didn't help that people celebrated birthday parties here, hogging all the tables and taking their sweet time, singing, laughing, taking pictures (posing w/ the giant burrito or remnants of it), opening presents and so on, but I digress. Being a party of three, we waited about 30+ minutes until we got sat. While waiting, we were entertained by a couple of hood people fighting over parking. One of them started yelling at the parked car and started to spit on it. I found that very entertaining especially since the car couldn't defend itself. But I digress. This place is known for their HUMONGOUS burrito, which according to their menu, feeds about 4 average size civilians. Of course we ordered the HUMONGOUS Manuel Special de Machaca and the regular size Hollenback Burrito. The food was seasoned well and everything tasted great. I have no complaints about the quality, and I sure as hell don't have any complaints about the portion. Goodness, I couldn't breath after eating, and we still had quite a few leftovers. I only give 5 stars to places that I frequent, so I can't give this a 5 star yet. If I'm in the neck of the hood again, I'd definitely drop by and try the other stuff on their menu. Oh, I failed to mention that their wait staff are really nice ladies. Make sure to tip them fat. Salsa Rating: 4/5 PRO: El giante burrito, friendly service, great price, good portion, other items on the menu look good for future trips. CON: El peque駉 comedor, long wait outside, in the ghetto.

EAT TIL YOU EXPLODE! This place serves burritos almost the size of a Shoebox! I always work up an appetite for a few days before coming to this great ICONIC Mexican joint. Even then my husband and I have to share a burrito. Nothing fancy inside, no focus on decor, but great food. Tender meat, soft tortillas, and spicy sauces. The waitresses aren't too friendly, however I can overlook the attitude a little as long as service is good. Try the Manuel's special (a burrito that can literally feed 3-4 hungry men! ) if you dare! You have to try this place at least once while in LA.

This place is so so. There meat was mediocre. I went there last weekend to try out this place. Saw so much reviews and on TV about this place. I had to come. Ordered a Burrito with eggs and steak. Forgot what it was called but the shreds of steak that was in the burrito were soo tough I felt like I chewing on some dried up beef jerkey. It was not easy. The salsa was good though very flavorful but the steak was really dry and stringy. I was not impressed. They also use a gang of lard. My friend ordered a cheese quesidilla cuz he wasn't super hungry and that sucker had more oil coming out than iraq did. The staff was coo and there seemed to be a bit of the die hard people there. The portions won't let ya down and i'm all for portions as long as they're damn delicious. But I felt like my shit wasn't fresh. It seems like there's a lot of filler. There wasn't that much meat in my burritto and definately more beans and cheese then there was of anything else. The people next to us had the manuel special which is pretty ridiculous in size. I wasn't interested in it after I had the steak shreds. It wasn't horrible but I had wayyy better mexican food at other establishments. sorry to do this.. really wanted to like this place.

Yes, this is the El Tepeyac that is featured on "Man vs. Food" as well as the Travel Channel's "101 Tastiest Places to Chowdown" (#23). It's also an LA institution, having been around for 55 years and if you live anywhere in the LA area, it is something that must be tried. True, there are other fine Mexican restaurants that have similarly amazing and delicious food but I dare you to try and find another establishment that serves baby-sized burritos. And no, I don't mean that there petite and cute, containing the inexplicably charm of "silver-dollar pancakes." I mean that they are the size of a healthy, chubby baby. In fact, it is wasn't for the pounds of cheese and enchilada sauce, I probably would have mistaken the giant tortilla for swaddling cloths. The place has an always-filled parking lot but there is a quick turnaround so you can usually find a spot within a minute or so. There is also always a line to get in. Unless the weather is terrible (rare in this part of the world), or unless you would prefer the convenient way they serve extra plates and the burrito at the center of the table with a knife (needed due to the aforementioned burrito massiveness), I would suggest ordering at the outside window which has a much quicker turnaround. You can snag a table on the outside patio, or get the food to go -- which sometimes isn't a bad idea as several of the patrons appear to be regulars that are a little too regular and appear to take on some of the massive qualities of the burrito. I usually opt for either of their classic burritos, the Hollenbeck (served with chunkier salsa and a little drier) or the Okie (served drowned in a sea of enchilada sauce). Everything appeared to be good though -- including the guacamole and chips which make a great side to share. Keep in mind that all of the portions are enormous and you can either get something for yourself and eat it for your next four meals, or you can share between about three people. Similar with the guacamole -- they give you enough to ballast a ship and a half-portion is large enough to share between a good sized group. Viva El Tepeyac!

Heard about a 2lb burrito and it caught my attention. As far as taste goes. Its pretty good, but it costs allot. 18 bucks for some but the asada burrito is 23. I mean definitely worth a try. Feeds 2-3 people depending on how hungry you are. Place is really small. I guess getting seated depends on how lucky you get. Parking lot is ok neighborhood is... well its not scary but its definitely not beverly hills. If your local stop by every now and then, service is good, food tastes good too. But I'm from the OC so the drive here and back is a little out of the way. Probably wouldn't get that burrito again tho haha i mean for 23 bucks you can get like 4+ regular burritos depending on where you go. So that's about the same if not more.

I am so glad I only work 2 miles from El Tepeyac! My life changed today. I just had my first Machaca experience, as well as my first Manuel experience. We had to wait in line for about 20 mins, but to me that's the sign of a good restaurant. Manuel is a rad old guy who schooled my husband and I on how to age gracefully and stay active into your 80s. Apparently all it takes is about 25 shots of tequila every day. Sounds good to me! We both ordered the Machaca Tostada after we saw them pass our table. The Machaca is probably the best Mexican beef dish I have tasted yet. And it was HUGE. I am pregnant and hungry, but I could only get half of it down. I am already fantasizing about the other half... I forgot to mention, my husband and I had told Manuel we were expecting when we were in line. When we left and thanked him, he jumped up and yelled, "they're having a baby! They're having a baby!!" The whole restaurant cheered and clapped. It was pretty awesome.

This place is an old family favorite. I remember coming here as a kid whenever we were hanging out with la familia on the East side. We'd all pile in the caruch and trip over to Evergreen. Enter, say hello to Manuel Sr. and get our grub on. Manny was always hospitable and awaiting you with a shot of brandy or whatever lit you up. I was here recently and things are the same.

The horchata is perfect. 燤any places have watery horchata, but not El Tepeyac. 營t is perfectly strong and sweet. Come here with a big appetite, and be prepared to wait in line. Also, if you dont want to wait in the long line, just go to the side window, and either get your food to go, or eat it in the patio! �This weekend I was craving it on the way to meet some friends at the beach, so I got an Okie to go. 燬itting on the beach with an El Tepayac burrito may be the best combo ever. �Everyone was jealous.

I grew up down the street from this place, and some of my family lives across the street from it now. I can't find anthing bad to say about Manuels (what tepeyac is known as) I live their machaca burritos, and their large plates. the inside is small, that's why there will ALWAYS be a line and if you're smart you'll call your order in and just pick it up. During lunce I will never show up, too smart for that. If you want to try some good food this will be the place to go.

If you haven't been to this place, GO GO GO! RIGHT NOW! It is Fan-freaking-tastic! Best burrito I've ever had... and I've spent a good deal of time in San Diego (the self-proclaimed burrito capital of the world). I haven't really tried any of their other food, but all I can do is rave about the Hollenbeck and Okie burritos. They're massive, cheap, and mouth-wateringly delicious. I've never been able to eat one by myself. I always split one with a friend. Seeing as these burritos cost about $8, it is easy for two people to eat for under $15. The guac is good too. Whenever we go, we have a 1/4 order... and it is enough to please a table of 4 爀asily. I LOVE the service at El Tepeyac as well. They're always super friendly, accommodating, and down-right fun to talk to. El Tepeyac is a MUST SEE/TASTE for out-of-towners who really want to taste the flavors of L.A. and SoCal. Heck, it should be and is a staple for locals... the place is always packed. If you haven't tried a Hollenbeck burrito, you're missing out!

Wow, what a disappointment. I went here because I had heard that this was one of the best mexican restaurants in LA. It was a Friday night and the restaurant was full but not too busy. Friday-Sunday they offer a dish called menudo (tripe soup kinda thing). I was in the mood for something special so I ordered it. Biggest mistake EVER! I have been eating menudo since I was a kid. Sometimes homemade, sometimes store bought and once in a while out of a can. I thought the stuff out of the can was the lowest of the low until I had El Tepeyac's. It seemed as if they had made a big batch the week before and it didn't sell so they put it in the freezer for next week. When my food arrived I immediately noticed something odd. Typically the broth is light, red and full of flavor. El Tepeyac's was almost like a stew and it tasted like it looked, horrible. The meat was completely over boiled, probably from the reheating. I ate about 1/6th of the bowl and could not go any further. When the waitress brought the check she looked at my bowl and didn't even ask if I wanted to go. She did, however, offer to box up everything else. �The guacamole seemed like it was from the costco frozen food section. The salsa was a complete joke, I've had more flavor and spice in rice cakes. I think the popularity of this place is due to the giant burritos. Big hairy deal.

Manuel's special really is good. And for that amount of food, $15 was a deal. Could feed 4-5 girls comfortably. There's a line to get seated, but once you're seated, the service is swift. Go to their take out window to get your food quicker.

The ambiance: Quaint and has a lot of character - you may have to wait a bit though because lines can be long. I really love these seemingly hole in the wall places to eat. =) The food: Pretty good - though the pollo was a bit dry and the asada was also a bit dry. The chile verde was very good though! The service: Very friendly and courteous. Perhaps it's just me but I always judge by 爓hether or not the waitresses come around to fill up water. I also love that they saw the group, knew what we were going to do and happily served our food, as if they were watching this "feat" for the first time! The price: very reasonable - a 5lb burrito is $15 -$18 and feeds about 3 people (depending on who you go with I guess!) I give it a 4 star because I'd come back, if motivated again. =)

Huge portions and cheap prices. I have been attending this place since I was a little boy. 燤y main dish are the Taquitos with a ton of guacamole. I have also gotten the eggs with Chorizo. The place is small and usually a line. This place is pretty famous as its not just attended by Hispanic people. I see all kinds of people coming to eat here.

The Manuel Special Burrito was the biggest burrito I have ever seen. 燭he food wasn't spectacular, but it was good. 燗s I looked around I noticed that the portions tend to be on the larger side regardless of what you order. You can sit inside and be waited on or order from the side window outside and seat yourself in the patio. 燭he lines weren't too bad either way considering it was lunch time. The Manuel was big enough for four people to share. 燭he price kind of reflects that too. 燙hips and salsa were $2 more, but the drinks are refillable. 燭he prices aren't what you would normally expect for Mexican food. 燨ne ginormous burrito, chips and three drinks set us back nearly $27.

I have to represent since Manuel's Tepeyac is in the heart of East Los. Up the hill and across from a church you will find this tiny little gem that cooks up authentic Mexican food at reasonable prices. I can vouch for their chilaquiles and beef taquitos w/guacamole. Portions are HUGE and prices are reasonable. It's a place definitely worth trying out! Oh, and if you're in the area and in need of an affordable flower arrangement made to order hit up Carmen's flowers down the street on Wabash (you can check out my review for that place). I have gone in several times with $25 and they have made me some pretty spectacular arrangements.. definitely recommend.

What else can be said about El Tepeyac Caf�in East Los Angeles? The place is definitely an institution - 55 years in business - impressive! Manny, the owner is awesome. After we passed on a free shot of Tequila he offered us a Twinkie and a glass of milk. He's a trip, super friendly and he definitely adds to the down home atmosphere of the joint. Overall, the service was excellent. The wait staff is friendly and polite and it's fun to watch Manny interact with each of the customers. The dude probably kissed 50 girls in a one hour period for crying out loud. �The food portions are ridiculous (especially for the price) and the food quality and taste are definitely above average. We ordered the chips and guacamole and it was literally served on a giant platter. The burritos (we all ordered the Hollenbeck) took up the entire plate and with the hot salsa were yum-yum-yum good. I got about three-quarters of the way through mine before I tapped out. The rolled tacos and enchiladas looked amazing as well and some couple next to us ordered nachos so big that they're probably still eating as I type. Honestly, I didn't go there expecting 5-Star quality but more so because it was featured on one of my favorite TV shows, "Man versus Food." It certainly didn't disappoint and I think people that rated it less than 4-STARS are basically clueless - seriously. I mean, you go to El Tepeyac Caf�for the culture, the tradition or even because of Manny himself - the food is simply a bonus. At least that's how I see it.

Theres too many good Mexican food restaurants out here to rate this past 3! Maybe my gripes is more with the CUSTOMER SERVICE than it is the food! I guess if your with a large posse than this place will do the job, jus slam a few coronas first, to fool your taste buds. I came here the other day with a friend and ordered the hollenback burrito I opted for asada instead of pork... 爄t came back just a plain burrito nothing on top of it, I said I didnt order this, the guy at the register says " oh wrong order" then he hands it back to the cook on the line and he throws pace picante on it and hands it back. Ooookay... so I stared at him for about 6 seconds and my stomach yelled "jus let it go fanon!" so my friend and I sit down with looks of misery on our faces and dig in( mind you we were kinda ok not kinda really hungover) to this pile of rice and peanutbutterthick re-fried beans, the meat was abysmal the pieces that were in there were fat & gristle, no flavor no salsa no cheese just a piece of I dunno on a plate... My freind who's puerto rican says "the guacamole's the best thing on the plate, I said " I was gonna say the same thing", we both looked at each other again and couldn't take another bite of the nonsense. We walked away angry and unsatisfied. Ended up going to Tamale Liliana's btw :)

Holy guacamole is all I have to say. Their guacamole is made fresh daily so it tastes so much better. If you get the chance to see them make it, you will be amazed as well. It's literally grinding hundreds of lbs of avocado a day in a gigantic cauldron. The 5lb burritos are no joke, good for competition but not for single person meals. The quality like most people rated was not the best meat you can get. you rather get there regular burritos that will taste much better. Chips and guacamole, ginormous burrito, and a large horchata, really filling. Next time go with your stretchy pants.

I have been going to El Tepeyac since I was a little one. 燤y dad started going there back in college and became good friends with Manuel, the owner. �If you get to meet him, he is a riot. 燗nd he loves the pretty ladies. 營 took a work group one day and he came out with the tequila wanting to do complimentary shots with us. 燞e said, "the shots will make an old man like me look better to you beautiful ladies!" ��If you are looking for an upscale restaurant; this is not the place. 營f you want good food, for a good price, and a home-like environment, check out El Tepeyac. �You can never go wrong with the huevos rancheros, the hollenbeck burrito, the chile relleno burrito, or the one you definitely have to share, the Manuel Special. �The only two problems that I ever have with El Tepeyac is: 1. There is ALWAYS a line outside! 燭hankfully, it moves pretty quickly. 2. It's a CASH ONLY place. 燭hey did install an ATM machine, so that makes things a bit easier.

A delicious and cheap place to dine on interesting Mexican food. Their claim to fame are their ginormous burritos... as big as your head! I've been here twice. First time I had the Hollenbeck burrito. Excellent. Second time 4 of us shared the monster Manuel Special and a 1/2 order of guacamole which was awesome as well. Some Yelpers wrote that they allow byob and we brought a bottle of tequila, but they wouldn't allow us to bring it in to drink. Thus, 4 stars. A great place for those with huge appetites and the curious.

I always called this place Manuel's even though its official name is El Tepeyac.I've eaten here several times and all of them have been very good. It's cramped in here, a little dark, and sometimes smells funny. I can't even think of everything I've eaten here but they were all decent. What sticks in my mind though is their large portions guacamole (served with their taquitos) that's the best I've ever tasted. I don't remember the name of their huge burrito but if you do order it, share it with someone. I tried to eat it all myself but towards the end I was just shoveling food into my mouth instead of actually enjoying it. Now that I think about it, that applies to nearly everything that's on the menu, well of course, except the guacamole. This place is rated as cheap but if you're like me, you can't only order one dish. It's always taquitos w/ guac and something else for me.

If you are craving a big wet burrito then El Tepeyec is the spot. You should be cautious with your expectations because it is not amazing, it is highly mediocre. I had the Hollenbeck and it satisified my needs for cheese, rice, beans, salsa and heavy amounts of carnitas, but although it is not quite the size of the Manuel Special, it still proved to be a task to eat (and digest). On flavor alone, El Tepeyec could do better, especially being located in the heart of great Mexican restaurants. This place clearly establishes itself with a memorable experience do to their portion sizes. The staff is friendly and the place is popular so you may need to wait in line. If you must eat your Mexican food with a fork and knife then this place will suffice, however there are far better burritos and tacos across the LA metro area.

Alright alright, I already know this is going to be perceived as blasphemous (Although "I've experienced better" isn't really that damning) by most and I'm a little ashamed to do it because I hate that people have been ripping them off and its a shame that other places are doing so (it is a landmark without question). BUT, with that said.. I had the 'carne asada'/steak burrito, it was unquestionably mediocre by SoCal standards. The style of beef they use is definitely not my cup of tea. They use cubes of stewed beef, not the 'normal' carne asada style at most Mexican restaurants. I've lived in SoCal my entire life and this flavor and quality does not measure up to what I'm used to. Now, I know there are obviously people here who are fans of this 'style' if you will, but all 3 of my friends were in agreement that there was absolutely no reason we would ever go back. It's not that the food tastes bad per say, but it's just unique and not in a good way IMO. I would equate it to someone's home cooking wherein you realize your grandma does it better (so, totally subjective). The BIG burrito is really impressive though, obscenely huge (albeit $25). My buddy finished all but 3 inches of it (he's 6'6). Its like eating a small dog in terms of proportion and the regular burritos are already too much for most. Again, my friends and I only had the steak so maybe my review is skewed slightly.. but honestly, that's the bench mark I measure all Mexican restaurants by anyway so don't be surprised if you're let down too. I warned you. *Puts on flame retardant suit*

This is the Original! 營 remember back in the day after our "Turkey bowl" at church, gathering food for the hungry masses after our game. 燱e got the call for the "Burritos" 營 had no idea, we hopped into a car and off we went for some Burritos? 燱ell, needless to say, we stopped off at Manuel's and came away with 2 or 3 burritos, which was a lot; of course this was only a portion to feed 2 teams fresh from our gridiron at Wilson HS. Fried Chicken from down the road at Dodger Stadium, and Burritos from Manuel's it was a feast to be remembered. 營 was initiated, that fine autumn day! Over the years, Manuel's had held a warm place in my heart, not just from the heartburn! 燞eehee! 營've had fond memories, and whenever I need to be humbled by a "real" burrito, I come here.

Well what more can I say about this place that hasn't already been said..... I'm so tired of Mexican food man! I am. But here the food is very good. For you white folks, this is as close as authentic as your going to get. All dishes are great but I recommend you try the famous HOLLENBECK. It is a giant burrito with tons of tasty ingredients. I don't know of anyone who can finish it all. �REMEMBER: you can take it home.... I have white friends that take a few to go and freeze them for later or parties. Manny is the Owner and he is a cool old man. I've known him for decades and he is always in good spirits. If you see him in the morning tell him "George said you'd give me a shot for the hang over"... He will bring out the bottle of tequila or presidente... But you better drink it! Great place to visit.

We got here at 10am on a Saturday morning and there was already a line to dine inside. Thankfully we noticed that there was a separate, over-the-counter service for those who didn't mind outside tables. Anyways, my sister and I ordered a steak burrito with the idea of sharing it. When we got our order I was flabbergasted. MY STEAK BURRITO WAS THE SIZE OF MY EFFIN' HEAD. Once I got over that initial shock and dug into my food, I wasn't too impressed. Maybe I'm just unaware of genuine Mexican cuisine, but I don't really like gloppy burritos with tough, dry meat. However, their horchata was great!

I wasn't rude or being an asshole, we spent our time there being ignored by the waitress most of the time. Had to wait more than 30 min just to get the bill but meh... Anyway, had the Manuel's Special w/ carne asada and it was GREAT. I should have gotten it without the salsa though, I hate soggy burritos. The carne asada wasnt anyhting special, but the beans/rice in the burrito were good. Will definitely come back and try out the rest of the menu.

Is that a 5 lb burrito or are you just happy to see me? Finding El Tepeyac was a bit of a trek, especially if traveling from OC. If you use a gps navigator, it will weave you in and out of streets that you have never been too. When you finally get there you will see a restaurant that stand out on its own across the street from a church and a school. I not sure if the locals visit this place, but I am positive that there was a lot of anticipation going in to El Tepeyac. I think everyone in line was a Manuel's virgin and everyone watched Man Vs Food. I tried not to fear the hype and give this restaurant a fair chance. I was praying that Adam Richman would not let us down. Mr. Manuel was very nice to greet all his waiting customers and insure that he would take good care of us. After about 30 minutes of waiting (not bad), I was finally inside! (no pun intended) On the menu, the legendary Manuel Special was staring me in the face. I thought I should know my limits and just order a regular. Everything look good on the menu and everything was around 8-10 dollars, except 20 ish for the Manuel Special. I saw a family of 5 try to take on this, but failed. I'm pretty sure I could finish it with 2 or 3 people :P. I took on the Hollenbeck Chili Verde. The 2.5 lb baby version of the famous 5 lb. Man o Man was it good! The only reason I didn't finish it. I wanted to save a small portion for a friend to try. Honestly, I excepted it to blow my socks off, which it didn't, but man did it bring back memories of going to a friend's house and getting homemade slow roasted pork at a friends birthday party. Everything in the burrito went together perfectly. MMMmm Cheese, gucamole, beens, and chili verde pork MMMM. I think I just made myself hungry writing this review. The service was exceptional. It was a little busy, so don't except 5 star service. The El Tepeyac staff made me feel like they actually wanted to serve and please the customers. Unlike, most restaurant where the servers have a "I hate my life" look underneath the fake smile. If I am ever in the LA area and my friend offers to drive. I will definitely go back. If you are trekking from OC, I suggest Maybe going... Highly recommend to locals. The best in LA? That's for you to decide. I barely scratched the service of fine Mexican food dinning in LA. Best MVF restaurant so far... Orochon Ramen and Philippe The Original were okay. Damn I want a 5 lb burrito right about now. :) Happy Yelp Year! Thank you Yelp fans and people that read my reviews. Thanks for my shinny new Elite '11 badge. SYOY

It's a pretty small place, but it seems like everyone gets in & out pretty quickly, so the wait isn't too bad. My boyfriend&I split the Manuel's Special burrito, chicken/pollo, and thank god we did. I saw a regular burrito, and that looked pretty big too, and this one was double+ it's size. We got chips & guacamole too, the guac is delicious! The service was really good too, we got our food like right away. We didn't finish the burrito and took 1/3 of it home + most of our chips. For the quantity+quality, the pricing is pretty good/cheap.

I've been to El Tepeyac about a dozen times. The first time I visited, I sat at the counter and ordered the chili verde plate. What came out was a good-sized portion of chili verde, arroz y frijoles. I was surprised though that the chili verde was red in color. It was good and I left stuffed. Since than, I've had their chicken taquitos with lots of guacamole on top and hard-shell beef tacos stuffed with lots of shredded cheddar cheese. I've never ordered their burritos. The portions are generous, but that's because you're paying for it. When you pay around $3 for a hard-shell taco, it better be stuffed. Oh and I can't stand El Tepeyac's red and green salsas. They just taste nasty to me. After the first few times waiting to get crammed inside to eat, I now choose to order at the takeout window and dine on the right side of the building.

I have read about this place for years. Seeing it on Man v. Food convinced me that I had to make the drive to try a Hollenbeck for myself. After having a couple days between me and the experience I feel like I can write a review that is honest and not fueled by shocking disappointment. I dragged two friends along for the adventure. After the three of us sat and ate our Hollenbecks I felt compelled to pay for their meal. I guess I thought of it as reparations for making them drive an hour out of our way for such an unmemorable meal. Maybe I expected too much? This burrito seemed perfect on paper and through a Panasonic plasma filter. It simply does not live up to the hype. I loved Manuel and the free shot of tequila. I loved the local neighborhood vibe. I loved our friendly little waitress. I loved the description of the Hollenbeck at the top of the first page of the menu. Unfortunately, I did not love the Hollenbeck. I love spicy food, but I am perfectly capable of enjoying a meal without spice. The Hollenbeck's problems didn't simply stem from a lack of spice. It's problems were rooted in a total lack of flavor what-so-ever. Did I go on a bad day? Was it just one bad batch of chile verde? Does this stuff always just taste like hunks of tough deep fried pork stewed in water for thirty minutes? I mean, seriously, is this really what all the hype is about? Do people really just love bland food in mass quantities? I wanted to love this place so much. It actually kind of pisses me off that it was so blah. I am sure I will give it another shot at some point. I will have to order something completely different, like enchiladas, and then I can decide if El Tepeyac is a lost cause

You can't eat here a lot because they cook everything in lard apparently. That's probably why it tastes so good. Well I guess you could eat here a lot, but it wouldn't be good for your arteries. I ordered the carne asada tostada cuz I wanted something smaller. I still couldnt finish it. It was decent but I've had better meat. My co-worker ordered the machaca quesadilla, and damn that was goooood. It was cheesy, meaty (and oily) goodness. I am ordering machaca when I go back. The burritos are as large as advertised and I was appalled when I saw a woman order the Manuel special for herself. I thought it was for the table of 4 she was at, but everyone else got their own dish. Talk about artery clogging! I couldn't watch her eat it. Minus one star because they made a mistake and brought out a carne asada quesadilla instead of machaca, and then charged us for an extra horchata...and the lady didn't know how to remove it from the bill and we had to wait 10 minutes before she gave us money for the horchata, instead of taking it off the bill.

Giant portions are only a blessing if the food is something you actually enjoy eating. How a restaurant managed to make a cheese fiend like me complain that there was simply too much cheese in the cheese enchiladas is beyond me -- but it happened. The chips were good, but the salsa was so smokey I thought maybe I'd accidentally been dipping into an ash tray. The service was personable, friendly, and quick -- reason enough to return, but the painfully large portions of Blehxican food I can do without.

My bf who grew up in the hood took me here, insisting that this was the best place to get a wet burrito. He was right! The first time here, I ordered a chicken burrito and could only finish half way. The bf managed to eat his entire carne asada burrito, but he definitely had a food coma afterwards. I can't even imagine what it'd be like to chow down that famous Manuel's Special! I saw a couple digging into that thing the other day and it was jaw-dropping enormous. Scary! Would love to try it though, some day with a group of friends. I can now understand what all the hype is about. Prepare for a long wait on a weekend, this place was packed, even around 10pm. There are outdoor seatings on the side, if you don't bother to wait. The last time I came here, I tried the beef enchilada and chicken taco combo. I was expecting a soft taco but they only had hard ones. Boo. Beef enchilada was tasty though. I'd say just stick with the wet burrito afterall.

So my fiance went to go pick one up (we now live 40 minutes away so dont get them as often). 燗lso if you are a meat eater order them with extra meat (oh also it taste better with Machaca? not sure if thats spelled right, but its not the shredded beef). Mmm I could almost taste the delicious slowed cooked meat, guacamole, and melted cheese! mmmmm Cant wait!

I've been here twice and have been very pleased on both occasions. The staff is very courteous and polite from the moment you step in... till the moment you step out. Now the food: Awesome! I've only had their hollenbeck burritos which are phenominal by burrito standards. Aside from my beloved burrito... I had a bite of shrimp from the camarones al mojo de ajo plate which was quite tasty. Always an enjoyable experience.

So my girlfriend was telling me that she only eats mexican food from 2 places. Her moms kitchen and El Tepeyac. The place is small and can get packed!!! Everyone there is really nice and quite energetic so expect a nice conversation if you sit at the counter. Looking around I saw a lot of Burritos and they were pretty huge but that's not was I was in the mood for. We ordered a side a guacamole for our chips and it was just made in the back not just scooped from a tub, but the salsa was a little bland. Luckily that was the only downside of the night. I ordered The Machaca dinner plate and the portion was pretty huge. I've had machaca at other places but I can honestly say this was one of the best I've had. Just writing this is making mouth water!!!! Anyway, I tried some of my girlfriends chilaquiles and lets just say my own step-mom could never make chilaquiles like that. We couldn't even finish our dinners because of the portions. We left saying those famous words after a really good meal, "I cant brief!!!" On a side note, on the wall I saw a photo of Manuel and the guy from Man vs Food ( I just barely started watching the show so i don know his name) All I cans say is that the Manuel Special looks tasty and I wanna split it with a couple people. Who is down with me??

El Tepeyac has some of the best Mexican food in LA, especially the burritos and chilaquiles. If your'e feeling brave one day go and have a man vs. food moment of your own with the Manuel's special burrito. This burritos is huge enough to feed 2-4 people , loaded with guacamole and topped with mounds of slowly cooked Chile Verde pork and cheese, and not that bad for around $18. Just don't go around lunch time (1-3pm) because you'll be waiting outside in line for a while. Oh!..and as soon as you go inside expect to take a shot of tequila with Manuel himself!.

Don't even bother to chow down on this burrito with you hands, because it is too big to be held. It was my first experience where a burrito cannot be eaten without a fork and knife. The burrito was almost the size of my face and it wasn't even the Manuel Special. The portion was very large and heavy. We ordered Hollenbeck and Pollo Burrito. Hollenbeck was everyone's favorite choice. It was packed with pork, guacamole, beans and rice. Pollo burrito was good too and it looked like they threw in half of a chicken , with saut閑d onions, and beans. Both burritos were so large that we had to to-go it home. Service was amazing and helpful. A waitress came to us few times if there were anything we needed. Lastly, she brought us a to-go box along with candies for us. I am definitely going back to this place with my other hungry comrades to finish the Manuel Burrito, which serves 4 to 5 people. Five stars for the portions, service, satisfaction, and creativity of serving the biggest burrito in southern California.

I remember coming here as a kid and in high school. It was where my friends and i would split a meal and talk endlessly about high school issues (HA!). I believe the 251 or 252 drops you off right in front or something like that. perhaps because my mom is such a good cook or because most food is pork based(ewl), it was always a hit or miss for me. They have really big burritos (that's what she said!) dry or swimming in some sort of sauce 燼nd that is what they are famous for. I do have to say that i am a sucker for guac. Total sucker. And let me tell you that El Tepeyac has the best around, maybe that is why i kept going back because i would even buy some to take home. avocados=god's gift to mankind.

I've been coming here since I was a little girl growing up in Boyle Heights.... 20 something years later I'm still a fan and always make my way back home to El Tepeyac! As soon as you walk in you get that welcome home feeling! Eating here is like going to your Tia's on a Sunday afternoon. Manny is still walking around flirting with the ladies and serving tequila shots! Expect to be called "mijo or mija" by the waitress. You'll definitely get your moneys worth (you'll have the leftovers to prove it.) I usually order a bean, cheese, and rice burrito (with all the fixins) and don't even come close to finishing half!

My boyfriend and I went to El Tepeyac Cafe because we saw it on Man vs. Food. We went on a Saturday afternoon and we had to wait in a line. After waiting for about 10-15 minutes, we went in and sat down. The place is very small. So if you want a big party, I doubt they can accommodate you. We ordered the Manuel special chile verde burrito, the one that was on the show. It was a five pound burrito. I really don't like mexican food that much, though I am half mexican. It was really very big. It was very good. Of course, there was leftovers, but I will eat it again. If and when I go again, I plan to try the guacamole, it was very good, but it was inside the burrito, so I couldn't taste it as much. The place is in East Los Angeles, the parking was adequate, the horchata, which I NEVER like, was great!!! It was also very reasonably priced. I would recommend this place.

Grew up in the neighborhood and I've been going there for YEARS! Being a big guacamole lover, I highly recommend theirs. Before committing to a big order, try their taquitos with guacamole. They are STUFFED with meat. Their guacamole is fresh and doesn't have that lemony or onion-y flavor other so-called Mexican restaurants have. For vegetarians, they have an awesome guacamole burger. My all-time favorite burritos in order are: #1 -- Hollenbeck Burrito (pork in red chili sauce, rice, beans & guacamole with cheese and more red chili sauce on top) #2 -- Machaca Burrito (shredded beef, jalapenos, onions, cheese & egg) #3 -- Red Chili Burrito (cheaper, with red chili pork meat and beans) You can split a regular burrito between two people if you're not that hungry, OR you can split a Manuel's Special Sized Burrito with two others if you're starving! Here's a tip-- if you want to avoid the line, order outside and either take your order to go or find a spot at an outside table. For even faster service, call your order in for pickup and they will have it ready in 10 - 20 minutes, depending on how busy they are. -PicoChick

This place is a very fun place. I recommend coming here if you want huge portions. That being said, if you want flavor, then you should go elsewhere. The biggest advantage this place has is the fact that its relatively cheap and very generous. If you are like me and do not eat that much, you should share a regular burrito with someone. If however, you are feeling very confident and do not have to drive back, then share the Manuel's Special with someone. The experience is worth it for the first time. I would only come back if I wanted to feast and/or had friends to feast with.

i am a fan. Key points... 1) very original and fun.... giant size portions. 2) flavor is good not great...With the huge size of the portions, food can cool down and mix together. 3) if you wanna awesome flavor, I would go somewhere, but if you want pretty good flavor and a original experience I would go here. Manuel's special is so big is feeds 4 people, but its so big, the flavors can get lost together. Taquitos are the size of corn dogs, definitely try those. Tasty tortilla chips and giant guacamole. Go check out this place for a fun and unique time and go to a taco truck for mexican food that you can feel in pores.

Save the carne asada and al pastor for your taco truck stops or backyard BBQ.

I agree with the statement of "large portions, small flavor." Unfortunately, my memory of my friend's leftovers from this place, years ago, were better than the meal I had over the weekend. :'( It was cool that they let me put potatoes in my veggie burrito. But it was sad that their salsa wasn't very good. Also, their cheese enchiladas were too dense, so the cheese was hardly melted. But in the end, their guacamole dominated all.

The only thing I was disappointed with at El Tepeyac was my own performance. I had my heart set on conquering Manuel's Special (Machaca), but came up pretty short. Other than that, no complaints. My mouth wanted more, but my stomach would not agree. My favorite part of the visit had to be Manuel himself. He's a true host. After a party of me and three other guy's were seated, he walks up to our table and explicitly states that "This is a man's restaurant, and here men drink Beer or Tequila. Which will you all have?" and so, we had a round of beers on the house. He then told us a story of his younger days, I couldn't fully understand what he was talking about because I was all euphoric over the massive amount of burrito I had consumed; But something about him being only 125 lbs. and was able to eat a 5 lb. burrito. Manuel is clearly a bigger man than I. So to sum things up: Good times, Good (and gigantic) burritos, and Free Beer. Well, I don't think it would be fair to give this place anything less than 5 stars.

We also saw this place on Man vs. Food. I love LA's hole in the wall places, like El Matador, Chano's, and the taco trucks in Eagle Rock, so we decided to check out the 'Yac. First, Many, the owner, meets you at the door. The staff is friendly. The place is small, so the long lines outside are misleading--there is seating for only about 35 people. There was plenty of seating at the counter, but it stinks because you watch the staff washing cups. It is loud inside. The restaurant has a "B" rating, which can be a deal breaker for some. The portions are huge and the food is priced accordingly, around $8.50 per burrito. I had a Hollenbeck burrito (chile verde [in RED sauce, mind you], rice, beans, guacamole, and more chile verde on top) and my brother had the Okie machaca (shredded beef) burrito. I ate the whole burrito for lunch and have not been hungry for 10 hours. The food was just ok, nothing special. The pork chunks in my burrito were inconsistent--some were succulent, others were tough & dry, as if they had been sitting around. The taste was normal, just like any other burrito. Remember, you pay for the big portions--other places have smaller portions but you pay $2-$3 less. I would probably not come back. It's one of those restaurants where you go back just because you forgot the food is nothing special. Give it a try, but don't expect a life-altering experience.

Been here for the first time yesterday. We ordered the Manuel Specials Burrito as we are 4 hungry people. The Manuel Special is the same as the Hollenbeck burrito. It's just the size that is different. If you grew up with the Asian food portions, I think The Manuel Special burrito is enough to feed 5 people. After tasting its burrito, I think the burrito was just okay. I could not find the "WOW" factor other than its size. For those who like Guacamole, Try it!! they have a very good Guacamole. They have their patio style next to their dining room (No Table Service - No Tip), so you don't have to wait for a long line. I would really recommend for you to try Tidal Wave in Sunset and Gower - Hollywood. Here is the yelp page http://www.yelp.com/biz/�� Order their Burrito with Chorizo and Egg. It is a "WOW" burrito in my opinion. There are 2 Tidal Waves on the complex make sure that you go to the correct one.

OMG! I love Manuel's... for the uninitiated El Tepeyac is Manuel's if you are on North Evergreen in Los Angeles. Don't accept any lesser El Tepeyac. There is almost always a line to get in but I haven't had the wait be so long that it was not worth it. :-) Talk to the people in line and you will understand that you are in for a treat. I always find people from more that 20 miles away or greater! Often from other states! Manuel's is truly a destination for Mexican food lovers. I love the Machaca and always get it extra spicy, that means extra jalapenos. I always get it. I know that others swear by the other menu items but I just can't bring myself to not have Machaca! Yes it is that good. It is not a fancy place but who cares. The food is Awesome! Eat here!

I tried this place out with my boyfriend because we both heard great things about it. We decided to eat outside as the inside had a wait and we were pretty hungry. Food: My boyfriend ordered the hollenbeck of course. I shared. It was BIG! But not that great...the sauce was pretty weak and did taste a bit watered down. The meat was a also a bit dry and some pieces had excessive fat on them. My boyfriend was satisfied. I wasn't. Service: Friendly. Our order came out fast.

Where can i start...larges portions, mediocre meats or crowded location...well on the positive side at least i didn't leave hungry. The television show "Man vs Food" made me come here so when i did i got the Manuel's Especial...let me just say that it was the biggest burrito i have every eaten. But the damage was not worth it. I ad a stomach ache for days it was not worth it. Im glad i visited but its a once in a life time place for me. They also refilled our drinks but didn't tell us about the "hidden fee" so i would recommend it but have the Pepto ready at home

I am a NorCal San Francisco girl at heart, but I do love me some L.A. food...I'll give them that. Thanks to Trisha and BT for an over-the-top awesome trip-- it was practically my birthday present too!! First up, El Tepeyac courtesy of the BF's request/suggestion, which ended up being BT's suggestion too for our arrival lunch. We promised each other we would "snack only" since dinner was a mere four hours away. What a mistake. You see, if you have ever seen "Man Vs. Food", you know where I'm going with this...we got the Manuel special with El Pastor....to share. It fed my BF, BT, Trisha, and I for that "lunch" and the breakfast Saturday morning. The thing was HUGE. I could have swam in the juices that were surrounding the beast of a burrito. And you would think it would be too much, too overwhelming for us, but it was TASTY. Like, really, really tasty. It has just enough spice for my taste, which is more spicy than the usual, but not as spicy as Cancun, and each individual aspect-- the guac, the rice, the pork, has its own unique flavor that layered so nicely upon one another that every bite was something different. Oh, and their cheese was cheddery and salty and pungent, just the way I like it. We also had this drink- jamaica. Fruity and sweet and refreshing. It kind of reminded me of hibiscus juice.

So I heard about this place and how legendary it was and couldn't wait to try it. 燤y girlfriend, her sister, and I headed to east LA on a beautiful Saturday afternoon with great expectations. 燭he area surrounding El Tepeyac is a bit shady to say the least and I would not be caught there after dark, but the long line of people made me feel much more comfortable. ��After waiting a good 45 minutes we got our seats. 燭he interior is fairly small and intimate. 燗 guy that looked like a day laborer went to the counter, spoke some spanish to the lady taking orders, and soon was rewarded by a tall plastic cup, filled with Jose Cuervo Gold. 營 found this to be a bit strange to say the least; especially considering Cuervo Gold is about as bad as tequila gets, so I sat and stared with a mixture of marvel and disgust that someone would actually find pleasure in such an experience. The first thing to come was our guacamole. 營 am a big fan of guacamole, but this stuff was very bland. 燱e added salt and pepper to try and make it more palatable, but I brushed it off in hopes of greater things. �I ordered their house special which is a massive chili verde burrito. 燭his burrito is giant; probably enough to feed three people. 營t was okay; not great. 營 wasn't dying to get my next bite in; like I do when eating really good mexican food. 營 forget what the girls ordered, but it was also huge and bland. �Having been to a lot of Mexican restaurants throughout Southern California, I've got to say that this pretty mediocre. 營t certainly isn't worth waiting in line, or going out of your way to get there. �My honest belief is that the reason people love this place so much is that their portions are huge. 營f you are fat and or want to be fat, then this is your place.

If it looks like canned beans, and tastes like canned beans, ITS CANNED BEANS. This place is WAY overpriced! For two people we paid $38 with tip and thats really high for mexican food. I ordered 2 taquitos for $7!? and they were dry and not really good at all with bland flavor. I also ordered Chili Verde and when I got it sure enough its not real chili verde its completely red. The taste was descent but I've had much better. The one thing we did like was the Flour Tortillas and the Chile Relleno...but thats it. The rice and beans do not pass the test. For a really amazing experience try GLORIAS COCINA MEXICANA in Downey Ca. Glorias is beautiful, large, much cheaper, and WAY BETTER Food. Try the MOLCAHETE at Glorias and forget about El Tepeyac. At Glorias me and my girl can share a molcahete for $12 and the taste is divine. El Tepeyac failed miserably especially because I've seen better many times over. Sorry 500 people don't know whats up on this one. By the way they charge you for CHIPS and SALSA! We paid $38 with tip WITHOUT buying the chips and salsa...And the Service is just plain non-existent, they serve you and forget you. El Tepeyac = Ugly overpriced and Bland, food factory... Glorias = Beautiful and cheaper and taste is GREAT!....real restaurant! My Mom's Food = The best, no equal yet and possibly never. RESPONSE to my reply: Mislead by my tastebuds? Your beans are not canned!? Thats just embarrassing because those are the worst fresh beans I ever had in my life. And thats the worst fresh RICE and BEANS I've had in a while. Your cooking skills there don't compare to other experiences I've had. That TOMATO based Chilli Verde is not properly named. Chilli Verde uses Tomatillos not Red Tomato. Your place is not authentic and is barely edible. Try a real reastuarant like Glorias so you can swallow your lame pride. Look don't be offended by my higher standard, I know better mexican cooks within my own family. I myself can beat you guys. My tastebuds are telling me I've had much better and WILL NEVER try you out again. I live much closer to some amazing places and went to try you out because of Man Vs Food (which I realize his understanding of mexican food is not comparing to mine, he's a white guy. My Mom's from mexico and cooks real Chilli Verde not Chilli Rojo)

The burritos are wet inside. 燭he flagship burritos are huge and contain beef stew, rice, beans, etc. wrapped in a flour tortilla. 燭hey don't cover the burritos in anything. 燭hey're not 'wet burritos', which usually are slathered in cheese and red. If you like typical LA-style burritos (lots of refried beans and cheese), this will confuse or disappoint you. However, if you ignore the fact that it's called a burrito and think of it as a new way to eat beef stew, then you may be happy. Service was excellent and parking was ample (nighttime)

They're known for their massive Manuel Special Burrito which I witnessed but did not partake in. It looks like it could feed about 5 hungry people. There menu consists of your typical Mexican fare, burritos, taquitos, tacos, enchiladas, etc. A couple interesting things to note "Burritos can be made up to 6 feet long when ordered 24hrs. in advance deposit required for boards/refundable upon of board with receipt." They also have a special Lent menu that has items such as Taqullos De Papa (potato taquitos served with rice & beans) or Fajitas De Eamoron (shrimp with grilled onion, tomato, jalapeno & colored bell pepper served with rice, beans & tortillas). I ordered two tacos, one carne asada, which was your basic corn tortilla taco, and one pollo, which was deep fried. The carne asada was easily one of the best tacos I've ever had. The meat was beyond words, it was seasoned and cooked perfectly. Piled high as can be, it really should have been two tacos. The onions and cilantro were the perfect accompaniments and just the right amount. The pollo on the otherhand was sub-par, the chicken was somewhat gamey, it was shredded and there was about 4 times the amount of cheese then needed to be. Had I not order this abomination I would have had a much much higher opinion of El Tepeyac. The chips were good and they served a green and a red salsa, both were good but nothing to write home about. I have photos and a more in depth review on my personal blog.

My girlfriend's brother introduced me to this place. They said they had a 5 pound burrito they 5 people share and I decided to see how big this monster really was. The inside dining room was packed and there was a line outside, so we decided to eat outside. I ordered the Manual Special and it came out pretty pricey. Food was made quick and I was ready to tackle this monster. I ate 80% of it then got tired of eating because all it had left was beans. Very good food, kinda pricey, when you get the Manual special ask for a little beans because they pack it on. Very satisfied would come back again.

THE HOLLENBECK --living one block away, I grew up stretching my stomach on this burrito. Chunky pork chile verde counterpoints generous layers --of chunky guacamole, rice & refried beans --to easily fill any hombre hambre. COMPLAINT --my first Hollenbecks were tongue-stinging-ho t--an acquired-taste rite of passage in East LA. But in recent years--the sauce has dipped into a chile-Recession. Some Yelpers said "Bland." A waitress claims the jalapenos are not ripening as hot anymore. I say Manuel has kept the real chile on the grassy knoll. Recent visit--the carne was tough. MANUEL'S SPECIAL --bragging rights--I beat 2 Cal Poly classmates to devour my own 5-pounder --without camping in the head that night. But now--quiero this bad boy to feed four for 2 days.

My bf and I are fans of food shows, so we were excited to go to the same place Man vs. Food. We had read the reviews on Yelp and after much reading we decided to go when we weren't hungry and can be patient with the waiting, crowd and noise. It wasn't too bad!!! We got lucky and found parking right across the street. For a party of 5 we waited 30-40 mins in line. We had a great waitress who brought out our food and drinks quickly. She constantly checked on us and gave us excellent service. We ordered nachos and they we're awsome!!! So now we we're hyped about the burrito. My bothers are huge so they ordered 1 Manuel's special each, I split it with the bf. Talk about presentation!!! I was blown away on the size and weight of this thing, the taste was ok, not mind blowing like I hoped, my brothers and bf all agree. My brothers were able to finish half of it, we ate about a quarter of it. We took our left overs home and had some for dinner that night and for lunch the following day. So for a $25 burrito you get to eat 3 times for 2 people, not a bad deal at all. We would go back to show our friends and share the whole "world famous burrito in an a bad neighborhood" experience, but other than that we wouldn't go out of our way just because we crave a burrito.

The food here is very good, this coming from a true Mexican-American who grew up in the San Fernando valley. It is not at the premier level of some of the drop dead delicious food of some hole in the walls in the SFV, but is well worth the 35min drive. The service is a bit dodgy sometimes though, the servers inside are very very good. Nice, pleasant and attentive, hell you even get to choose from a basket of candy after your meal. Now comes the rub, the exterior walk-up counter staff, hardly seem to care how long you wait and usually have a sarcastic attitude.

I love you, Manuel. He's so nice and friendly. We came as a party of 4 and had a party of 4. Manuel is very liberal with the tequila. The best part of the whole concept is that Manuel does not have alcohol on the menu. We came as a group of 4 to conquer the Manuel's special. We almost failed as a group of 4. Normally with quantity, the poor quality becomes evident but this is not the case here. It just means more tender and juicy pork stewed in a savory sauce, plowed on your plate, with a tortilla blanket containing the deliciousness. Ready to be eaten.

First off let me say the portion size on "manuel's challenge" is a b. Five pounds of burrito is no joke. Two full grown men on this thing and still can't finish it. Burrito was kind of bland, so you should get guac/salsa to help ease down all the cuts of pork you'll be scarfing down. The atmosphere is fun, and the service is very prompt and friendly.

For Mexican food its authentic! It took me too long to finally make it over to this place. I love Mexican food and it was awesome to find a place that knows how to make it right. There was a line and we waited about 20 minutes. A couple behind us cut in front of us which made me mad. The owner Manuel looked friendly but he did not engage us in conversation, you could tell he was there to favor his returning clients. Once we were seated the table was small but it was enough for the three of us. The small location was full of movement as orders were taken, people were talking, and food was being delivered. I ordered the Veggie Burrito with the guacamole on the side, it has rice, beans, cheese, and is topped with ranchera sauce. The rice was nothing special, the beans were very tasty, the cheese was gooey, and the sauce was spicy enough to enjoy. Overall it was a good burrito. Its similar to one I can get near my home in Bellflower. The guacamole I ordered on the side because most of the time it has raw onion, which this one does. I took a small amount of it and bit straight into one, which nearly ruined the meal for me. I also was able to try a chicken burrito which was very wet and it made it unpleasant. I think this place is good but i can get good Mexican food near home, specially a bean and cheese burrito. I would probably not go back just because there is a line, the place is small, and its further away from home. I'll stick to real Mexican food at home.

This by far has been my favorite in Boyle Heights, well in all of Los Angeles! They have the best guacamole, burritos, tacos and everything. My first visit here I was shocked at the size of the Manuel's special with hollenbeck. Sure its a hole in the wall and its no good for groups but you get to choose the outdoor or indoor dining with la chistas handing you the food. Service is top notch, people are friendly, and at the end you get a tub of candy. Its a real homey place and they don't charge too much money. You can go and walk away stuffed WITH leftovers.

I first went to this place a few years ago after hearing about their massive burritos. 營'm more used to "Mexican" food like Tito's Tacos, so I wasn't sure what to expect. 營 also have very particular tastes when it comes to my burritos. 燨ne thing - NO AVOCADO! 燭here was just something about the texture that I didn't like. When you get to El Tepeyac, you notice that the menu doesn't really tell you what is in the burritos, but the cashier is more than happy to tell you (over and over again, in my case, since I have a short memory). 營 ended up getting the Okie with chicken, which has beans, cheese, lettuce, and salsa (as far as I can remember). 營 specifically asked for no guacamole. When the burrito arrived, it looked more like a pillow covered in red sauce. 營 dove in, and was amazed at how awesome it was. 燭hen, I saw it. 燬taring up at me was a giant piece of avocado. 營 contemplated taking it back, but this burrito was so massive, I would have felt like I was wasting something that could have fed a family for a week. 燬o I ate it. 燗nd it was awesome.

My first thought: meh, Chipotle is better (and let me tell you, I don't really like Chipotle). The second time I went was because a friend saw it on Man vs. Food. We get there and I order something different. Same thing: meh. I made the mistake of going there a 3rd time. I order the shredded tacos and an horchata. Tacos: flavorless. The horchata was so sweet I couldn't drink it. I really want to give it another chance just because it's supposed to be an LA gem. Sorry Manuel, I won't go back.

Wow if you want traditional Mexican food this place is it. 燙rowded and small. 營f you get there during lunch or dinner expect a wait. 燦ot good for big groups that is for sure. 燭he hollenbeck burrito is huge! 燱e had 4 people share one and there is even a larger one that feeds more. 燝reat food though, very fresh, don't feel like you just ate junk food like you do at the other Mexican places. 燭ry the rice water when you are there.

I only got a few words for this place: delicious, gianormous, and did I not mention delicious? Well, this is a little place near LA County Hospital and I guess it seems fitting if you have a heart attack from eating. Oh well, the hospital is near by. LOL. My buddy and I came here one day to get some burritos and there was a line that stretched around the restaraunt just to get a table inside, so we ordered from outside on the side of the restaraunt. We got the hollenbeck de machaca burritos for like $9 bucks. And let's just say for one of the very few times, I actually could not finish my food. It's big and delicious!

*****Disclaimer, although the following review is just that -- a review -- 爌lease be aware that it also contains a significant amount of hostile ranting and raving. 燫eader's discretion is advised. 燭hank you ***** Whoa Nelly!!! 營'm not the biggest fan of this place, but reading Nik d.'s review geared me into the defensive. 燙omparing El Tepeyac to Baja Fresh and Chipotle is the dumbest thing I've ever heard...for MANY reasons. 燜irst off, I freaking LOVE Baja Fresh, and I eat the ghetto food in the "barrio" with the rest of my cholas on a regular basis. 營've had "real" Mexican food from "real" Mexican restaurants and in the kitchens and backyards of "real" Mexican people. 營 think it's insulting and naive to label the fans of El Tepeyac as incapable of recognizing the difference between a hole in the wall and an American chain. 燩uh-lease. 燞ow self righteous can one reviewer get? El Tepeyac IS a hole in the wall. 營t is run by a man from Mexico, not an American from Mc Donald's who decided to go undercover with a fake authentic eatery. 燭he place has been open for 50 years, for Pete's sake! 營t didn't spring up overnight! 營 didn't even know about this place until my MEXICAN friends raved about it and dragged me over. 燭he food is NOTHING like Baja Fresh or Chipotle. 營f it was, I'd immediately love it. 燳et, I'd also realize it would be from an American-like Baja region with a corresponding style. 燭his is not the case at El Tepeyac. Now, for my review. The wait was long. 燣oooooong. 燜rom what I gather, it wasn't as long as normal, which scares me, but then again I wait half an hour for freaking frozen yogurt at Pinkberry, so who am I to judge? 燭he only difference is, I'm not exactly "hungry" when I go to Pinkberry, so I can manage my irritation more easily. �I ordered the wrong thing. 營 got some Oklahoma burrito that was filled with chicken and not much else. 燱hen I read other reviews describing guacamole and onions, etc., I feel like going back and trying another burrito. 營n fact, maybe I will. �My three stars is based on my poor choice of ordering and the fact that you have to pay extra for chips and salsa. 燭hat's lame. 燭hat should come standard. 營 think this stems from their popularity and their sudden boom of success and media recognition. 營f they can charge for chips, then let them charge for chips. 燦ot everyone can do that. 營t just makes me pause and flick off a star (cuz I likey me chipsies). People love this place. 燩eople of all ethnicities. 營'm going to go back to try something else. 燤aybe I got it wrong the first time. 營 prefer the super burrito at Taqueria Jalisco in Bell/Maywood. 燞owever, "if you can discern the difference between american chains and mexcian" (Nik d.) I won't say "don't waste your time." 營 say try it out, you might like it. 燳ou'll realize it's not an American chain, but a Mexican restaurant. 燡ust realize you might not like it, because NOT ALL AUTHENTIC HOLE IN THE WALL MEXICAN RESTAURANTS SERVE THE SAME TYPE OF FOOD!!! 營f all authentic hole in the wall Mexican restaurants served the same food and had the same standards and were 100% consistent, then that would symbolize a chain. 燤aybe they should join together and come up with an authentic Mexican food experience Constitution that all should follow, as well as a blueprint for the design of all their hole in the wall establishments. 燭his way, all us idiots out there could recognize the difference. Or maybe not. Realize that I am a Chinese-Swedish-Scottish-German gal working in the barrio with an authentic Mexican boyfriend and an authentic Chinese mother who occasionally likes her Panda Express. 營f this denies me credibility, go read another review.

I like this place. It has nice homey feeling to it. Maybe it's because the place is tiny or our server was really nice. Anyways, If you want to get a full stomach without breaking the bank, this place will hit the spot. The servings were huge and it was only $10 a person depends on what you order. My group shared the food so it was hard to distinguish what was what after. But I can say that the meat to pick is the carne asada which was really good. Based on what I ate, the food was good but it lacked freshness. Overall, a nice place for some good Mexican food. Good portions at a good price. Exactly what I am.

El Tepeyac Cafe is what Yelp was born for. 燭his is one of those hole in the wall spots that 爉ost every East LA'er knows about and then slowly trickles down to everyone else who loves good filling food. 燬ince it looks like the "Hollenbeck" burrito is the topic of discussion by everyone I will talk about their breakfasts. 燭he Chorizo is amazing...the heuvos rancheros are mouth watering. 燛specially if your hanging over from the night before. 營f you show up on a Sunday you might have to negotiate your arrival on the Church's schedule. 營t seems like they get a flood of patrons before and after each Mass. 燘ut if you dont care about waiting in a 5-10 minute line then just GO....GO NOW! 燤y mom and dad used to tell me a story that Manny the owner opened up his restaurant next to the church to get God's blessing. 燗lthough, I have my own beliefs now, I think he made the right decision. 燘ut I think its the amazing food that brings the peeps...you be the judge. �I dont know if it should be mentioned on this website but there is a suprise on certain sundays when Manny is in a good mood. 營 will let you find out....its especially nice if you havnt stopped partying from the night before...(you bad kids)

Fresh from viewing the L.A. episode of the Travel Channel's "Man vs. Food", my Yelp-vision was set on El Tepeyac as an establishment of high potential for my continuing search for Food Victories in the Los Angeles area. Now, I might be a little late in the game when it comes to El Tepeyac. 燬ure, I only know of it due to my healthy television-viewing habits. 燤aybe if I were a bit more natively Angelino, it'd be old news. 燭his place is hefting a solid 150+ Yelp reviews at an impressive average of four stars. Oh dear, oh dear. Let me knock that shit down a bit, shall I? Certainly TV has a way of glamorizing things. 燱hat I saw on my screen was a fun, traditional, homey little place with a cheerful old dude handing out shots of Tequila like the Santa Claus of alchohol, with a staff jammin' away to churn out some delicious looking burrito-tastic fare that had the whole patronage grinning and munching away. What's difficult to reckon, then, is how I could stop in on a sunny Thursday, ready for this great experience, and instead find: -Inattentive window-girl half-assedly taking orders and trying to snap a price at us and get us out of her way after each item we asked for. �-Pickup window-guy screaming our number repeatedly as if he'd been waiting for us an hour instead of the ten seconds it took to push through the crowd and get to the pickup window. -Same guy more or less throwing our plates into my arms and turning away. 燭hankfully I've carried plates as a job before, or I'd have had difficulty trying to juggle these without dropping. -Chips and Salsa served with no salsa, no salsa bar available to get ourselves, and staff pointedly ignoring us politely asking for some. -The blandest-ass burrito I've ever tasted, including goddamned Rubio's. 燗 Burrito de Pollo at El Tepeyac is, apparently, two or so cans worth of shitty pulled chicken, unflavored, with a tablespoon or so of refried beans, in a tortilla. 營f there were any hint of salt, peper or hot sauce available it might have been salvaged, but again, staff ignores inquiries on where to find anything of the sort. 營 ate about half the burrito waiting for it to get good, but there's only so much plain-ass, flavorless pulled chicken with a scrap of tortilla a guy can eat without getting depression from boredom. I really wanted to enjoy this place. 燤aybe the experience is different inside; we used the outside ordering window/line. 營 don't know. 燭o their credit, a guy did come down the table line outside asking if everything was okay, and at the time having not tasted the food yet, I said it was. 燭o their discredit, we wanted to bring our food home and try to salvage it here with some spices and sauces, but the staff (to no surprise at this point) wouldn't acknowledge us asking for any take-home container. Sorry, El Tepeyac. 營 don't know if I came on an off-day, or what, but that was some bullshit, you guys, especially at a price-tag of 8+ bucks per entree. 燤aybe I'll give you another shot someday. 燨h wait, I can still get the most delicious mexican food ever from a friendly staff for a quarter of the price at Huarache Azteca. 燳eah, never mind, fuck you.

But be forewarned its in the ghetto, as soon as we arrived off the of the free way a Ghetto Bird was in the air (Police Helicopter).

And it wasnt that expensive either only $30 for our large burrito and it fed four in half people no problem with a lot left over.

Ok, this is my first time here so please take this into consideration. When we got there the line was up the very small parking lot. We had to park on the street (no biggie though), we were being entertained the the owner Manuel (he's really adorable). We waited almost 1 hour because it's that small. You could eat outside and order there (there was not much of a line) except it was cold and rainy so of course everyone wanted to eat inside where it was cozy and warm. We sit finally, tiny little place, like 8-9 tables and a booth. The waitress comes, takes our orders, we get guac/chips, Mom gets small menudo and coffee, Me and Hubby got the famous Hollanbeck Burrito. The food comes out all backwards with several minutes in between making the stuff cold. The waitresses are all family so they have this could give two sh**ts if they get fired cause they won't (kind of attitude). �Eventually our waitress leaves, (not saying bye or anything) we are left with no refill offers or anything! Ugh! Just leaves?? The food was medioce, my mom thought her re-heated menudo was good. Our burrito's were gigantic, with 80% rice and beans then some chile verde pork, I kept digging for meat and when if finally came it was good, not the best but good and tasty. Guacamole was all avocado, no taste? Needed some lime and salt at least! Come on how hard is it to make guac? We left with an Horchata (was just ok). Would we come back? Honestly, NO. But at least we could say we tried it. On to the next...

No, this is not authentic Mexican food. One does not come here for mole', tacos, seafood, or any of the ordinary associations. But they make by far the biggest and best burritos around. I've been coming here with my parents since I was a kid, and my personal fave is the steak picado burrito, which is spicy with large chunks of beef inside and topped wet with sauce and steak. Delicious. Also good are the machaca and oki. And the orders of guacamole are perfectly done, too, make sure to get one for the table. The waitresses are always kind even when hurried, and though the line outside may look daunting, it never seems to take too long.

Last time I frequented this establishment was in the 80's. Nothing changes in Boyle Heights. The service was fast and efficient. The chips delicious with a side of guacamole. The salsa's tasty (two different types). Then the major attraction came out, we all ordered burritos, four to be exact. The damn things didn't fit on the table. They we're really good, but the size impresses you more then the quality. I'd go back just to try and eat the grande burrito( i think its called Manuel's) but I've had better Mexican food.

This place has the East-Los ambiance and location that you want in an authentic LA Mexican joint, but disappointingly the food is underwhelming (minus 2 stars), and not that cheap (minus another star) to boot. We had the Carne Asada and Hollenback (still not sure) burritos, huevos rancheros, and a taco combo plate. 燗ll were extremely average. They have a window and outside tables along the side for overflow from the small dining room. Why hit this place when there are so many better choices for Mexican in LA? 燭he only reason I can think of is if you need some of those jumbo family-size burritos for a party or something, which we did see some people take away. 燨therwise, nothing special here.

I went to El Tepeyac this past Saturday because I saw them on "Man vs. Food" I think trusting a television program where the host was given free food was my first mistake. 燭hat being said... �The first problem was that we waited out side while they allowed people that came after us to jump in front of our party. 營'm not saying it's because we were the wrong ethnicity (black), but we were definitely the only individuals there that had no south of the border backgrounds. Secondly, there were flying ants flying around inside of the restaurant. 燱ere repeatedly had to ask for new water because they were constantly flying inside of our glasses, not to mention in to our food. 營 don't like eating insects but it took everything in my being to stay and complete the meal. 燣ooking back at the situation I should have complained in a loud voice and stormed out. Third, the place was FREEZING!!! 營 understand that if the restaurant is cold then people won't want to stay and chit chat so they can get more people in, but seriously. 燘ecause it was so cold the food quickly froze. Fourth and finally, you better know "Espa駉l" after asking for fresh water numerous times the waiter finally understood what we were trying to tell him about the insect in the water and reluctantly gave us another glass (or just poured out the water and refilled it). Never again will I let a food television program lie to me and make me believe that they found some gem in the rough. 營f I haven't heard of it it must be rough, and doesn't deserve my patronage. You have been warned...go at your own risk.

El Tepeyac has to be one of the best eateries in the Los Angeles area hands down. Its definitely in my top ten list of best places to go for the best Mexican food without crossing the border. No I don't mean Taco Bell (remember the slogan). There may not be the blood and hair on the walls as I expected but good food and good times are in abundunce. First up, a platter of carnitas. Tender juicy steaming pulled pork loaded on a warm tortilla and eaten immediately. The hot juices running down your chin while the briightly flavored salsa hits the back of your throat is tolerable. Hey, why don't we have a shot of tequila to go with our meal? Why sure, why not? The only problem is that alcohol is not served here. Happy hour down street does serve some great Mexican beers however. Another tasty treat is the fava bean and cactus soup or sopa de nopales con frijoles. Its delicous and made only by request. It helps to know the staff on a first name basis. I like to call El Tepeyac a cross between great street food and sit down food. You can get the best of both worlds. Here is an example. Any great Mexican joint in any geographical location is probably going to serve the best tacos, sopes, gorditas, tamales, enchiladas, posole, burritos (not very Mexican) etc. ever. At El Tepeyac you will see some entrees on the menu that are usually served street side in most parts in Mexico, however at El Tepeyac its served in a nice comfortable restaurant setting. Just look for the streets for the good stuff and stay away from the fast food crap. Follow your nose and carry your ass to the Yac. The Yac's tacos with asada and pastor are described in one word only: sublime. If you have the stomach as I do, try some tripe, tongue, stomach and brains because you will be surprised on how good the nasty bits taste. I could go on forever and before you know it I've written a novel on how good Mexican food is. Go seek and explore El Tepeyac and you will not be disappointed. If you are then I will buy your meal personally.

I've been hearing about this place for months, and decided to finally try it out. So, when I got there, I at first thought it was interesting how there's a church right next door. Or something that looks like a prayer section. Anyhow, I went on a Saturday morning, and of course, it was packed. My friends and I decided to eat outside. Ordering through the window, I got a peek inside (where the stove is at)...and what I saw was nasty.. but yummy. Nasty as in, all the pots and pans had cheese and other stuff oozing out, and yummy because it smells sooooo good. The food here I'll admit, is very cheap, but as for health.., um... might want to consider another place to eat. Only reason I'm giving a 1 star is because I ended up ordering something, which is totally my fault, that wasn't the greatest. Well, there was no taste because it was just a rice and beans burrito. But what my friends order, looked yummy. So, FYI, don't order the rice and beans burrito. Order a authentic Mexican breakfast.

Growing up in East LA there is nothing better than a place with good food and makes you feel like you never left home. Manuel is so hilarious seating people, cracking jokes and having a good old time with his wife in the kitchen. While we were eating a song come on the speakers and he grabs his wife from the kitchen and starts dancing and didn't care who was or wasn't watching. The food is just a gargantuan plate of flavor. The Manuel special could feed about 5-6 people in my family and its perfect for sleepy Sundays when you just want to stay in and relax. The location is tiny and there are lines out the door if you don't get there early enough. Or else just go to the side window that provides a carryout option if you don't want to dine in. This is a quintessential LA spot that I Hope will never die out.

to say that the portions at el tepeyac are "generous" is a severe understatement. they're gargantuan. even colossal. example: the guacamole comes broken down in fractions. you can get a whole, a half or a quarter order. and a quarter order will feed two with room to spare. i was there last night, and one of the first things i saw was two dinosaur-sized hollenbeck burritos making their way out of the kitchen. they were seriously the diameter of a human neck, and around twice as long. proceed with caution. and dexterity. the flavors are always fresh and complex. the enchilada sauce has the tart edge of tomato with the spicy aroma of chili powder. the chicken is fresh white meat. the rice is tender and fluffy, and when mixed with beans and cheese, 燾reates a savory taste sensation. crunchy tacos are layered with fresh, chilled tomato and lettuce and around as much shredded cheddar as half of one of those bags you buy at the grocery store. i kid you not. they have several salsas. there's a chile arbol that is awesome when spooned into the guacamole, a salsa verde that provides a nice tomatillo bite, and this other one that they seem to have sometimes and completely deny others. it's a red salsa with green chiles in it. i have plenty of friends who prefer the tacos al carbon stylings of every other place in town. a friend of mine professed that only people who grew up in california crave family-style mexican food, and he may be right. all i know is that when i'm really hungry, and it is mexican food that my mouth is watering for, el tepeyac is the place to be and the place to go.

I have been on Yelp for awhile and have never been so compelled to write a review about any place I've been to... until now. Ok, so I have been coming to El Tepeyac for as long as I can remember. I remember being a little girl, and looking forward to going there with my parents, and the owner, Manuel, giving us candy. My family has been going there for decades. So of course, I ranted and raved about this place to my boyfriend, and after a trip to Lincoln Heights to try Mom's Tamales (and finding out it was closed at 1pm due to running out of food), we decided to go to Tepeyac. OMG, it sucked! Seriously, a disappointment. My boyfriend was not a happy camper as this was his first time. We ordered from the outdoor window as there was a line to eat inside the restaurant. 燭he service was terrible.They lagged at taking our order. My boyfriend and I were at the window for awhile before the girl decided to take down our order. She was too busy talking crap about one of the customers to one of the guys in the kitchen. I was appalled by this. I also didn't remember the food being so terrible! I ordered the #8, the torta de guacamole. Usually, a torta is a sandwich... umm.. tell me why it was basically a GUACAMOLE OMELLETTE!. OMG.. gross... My boyfriend ordered the Hollenbeck Burrito with Carnitas. It tasted like dog food. It was too wet, juices were all over the place. He was pissed because he had been craving carnitas all day, and that was NOTHING close to that. I text my mom to tell her that it was the worst experience there that I can remember and even she was surprised. Needless to say, I don't think we'll be coming back here which sucks because it brings me memories of my childhood.

So this place was Boyle Heights at one point. The food was great and you tasted the mexicano status in the flavor and salsa.the lines are still long at the door but the food is not all that good any more, the meat is chunky and rough the beans taste out the can. At one point this was the weekend spot but it has now become just one more burrito place. the food has gone from being home grown to cater to the masses, its still a spot to eat, but not like before, try the tepeyac special, or the hollenbeck they are great if your a first timer.

Everything you've heard about Manuels is true. The owner is one of the most colorful people in LA. If you are into Big Burritos then you have Hit the Lotto. But while the portions are huge, the quality is not going to make Golden Sparks fly out of your Butt. Now I'm not saying it's not good it is. But its a Burrito and a $12 plus burrito at that. I have always favored the Steak Picado. Really Really Good and the Steak Picado Manuels Special is off the hook. Did I say that? There are alot of places that you need to try in LA, some because the food is just that good, some because it's so different. This place is an Experience.

Located in the hood Manuel's is the real deal authentic Mexican restaurant. I can't eat a whole Manuel's special to the neck but I the Holumbak is a smaller version super delicious. Even if your not feeling a burrito everything else is bomb like the Chile Verde and I say AL their breakfast plates. Small place so you will probably have to wait but its worth it.

I give them 5 stars for their beef taquitos and huge portion of guacamole, rice and beans. Some of their food, like their carnitas tacos, could be much tastier. I'm giving them 3 stars, however, because of the B grade and a couple of months ago, they jipped me on the chips I ordered. And, the last time I was there, they didn't give me the drink I ordered. They are on time out and I won't be going back for a good while.

Oh, how I crave the Hollenbeck burrito. This burrito is the King of all burritos in my book. It has succulent chunks of pork braised in their version of chile verde, but it's not green. It's a fantastic tomato based stew filled with onions and seasonings. The burrito is filled with the pork and sauce, rice, beans, and guacamole. My mouth is watering just thinking about it! I make the trip to E. LA every time I visit my parents, who live in Chino. I live in Vegas and there is nothing like El Tepeyac out here. I started going to ET when I was a freshman in High School, which was 23 years ago. Nothing has changed about this place. The service may not be the friendliest but you go there to eat and get out. I've observed they may tend to be a little friendlier to the latino patrons but overall have never had a horrible experience here. Seating is very limited on the inside but they also have self seating on the side of the restaurant. You go to the order window, place your order, pay, and just seat yourself. The food is abundant in all their dishes. The Manuels Special, which is the much larger version of the Hollenbeck but with cheese on top, runs 17.99 and can feed 4 people. I've also had the taquitos(huge shredded beef filled), chicken tacos, carne asada, and other dishes and they are ALL good. The guacamole is fresh, meaning not watered down and runny. Very chunky with large pieces of real avocado. I also like their style of rice and beans, never hard or greasy. This place is definitely reliable for good eating so bring a HUGE appetite!

normally, one of my favorite places... unfortunately, after standing in a 20 minute line last week we were asked to leave because the health department was shutting the place down in the middle of service. the hostess/waitress told us they had "several health code violations." i will consider the bullet dodged. however, i'm not sure i can heartily recommend any establishment that has been closed in the middle of service for MULTIPLE health code violations. ick. i'm splitting the difference and giving 3 stars because i really did love their food before i knew about the nastiness going on behind the scenes...

When I used to work at Cal State L.A., we would go here at least once a month - we would have gone more often but the portions are HUGE so we braced ourselves and limited our visits to once a month... Warning, the line can be quite long when it's prime lunch or dinner time, but it's worth the wait. The dining area is very small, so it gets filled up quickly. I've tried several things on their menu - the taquitos, the burritos... one of my faves is the machaca burrito- so delicious! Their guacamole should not be passed up either. The owner actually greeted us during a long line one day and offered us shots of tequila on the house as a thank you for waiting so long! This is definitely one of my favorite holes in the wall in L.A.

Came here after watching man vs. food... It was a really cold day so waiting outside in line sucked, and it took about 20 minutes for us to get seated. As my boyfriend and I were deciding on what to order, the table next to us was just getting our food. I saw this enormous burrito pass by me, covered in melted cheese and sauce. I knew i had to get that one! Turned out it was a Hollenbeck De Asada, which we decided to split. Also ordered horchata, which was HUGE. The burrito was amazing! The meat was tender and the red sauce on top had just the right amount of spiciness. I actually couldn't finish my half..that's how big their burritos are! Service was great. They were really good at recommending stuff on the menu and worked really quickly to make me forget about the cold, long wait outside. The location isn't the greatest but the food definitely makes up for that. I would definitely come back if i'm ever in the area :)

I learned about this restaurant from TV show Man vs. Food on the Food Network and wanted taste their food. So along with my husband and couple of friends we went there one Saturday afternoon. It was line outside the place and we had to wait about 45 minutes. We ordered Chili Colorado Burrito and Chili Verde Burrito (Regular size). It was the bomb. The regular size was huge enough for my husband and I to share. The place is smaller than I thought but staff were nice. The price was reasonable also. Needless to say we will visit here again.

What can I say? If you go to East L.A. (which thanks to the new gold line is super easy!) you must stop by El Tepeyac- its an East L.A. staple and for good reason- BURRITOS! Now, you can't eat here all the time, alas diabetes is not cute nor good for you, but man do they know their burritos. Try the Hollenbeck burrito and share with all of your co-workers, or a wet burrito, (share it with 2 or more friends). Oh, and don't forget the horchata- You will thank me!

You may call me the Gringo of East LA, if you wish. I still say, I look good in a sombrero though. I have logged more miles, consulted more maps, acquired more frequent flier miles, painstakingly tracking down a multitude of over the counter food establishments, rummaged through an amalgamation of hole-in-the-walls, I have tested a thousand and one, so called ethnic places; scurrying forth with nothing more than a scant word of the mere reference of a good Mexican restaurants. I love them and they stretch forth as far as the eye can see. We may have more Mexican restaurants in Southern California than American restaurants? 營t is Heaven on earth for this Restaurant Reporter. 燱ith so many restaurants the options are limitless but too many have above average food and drinks that remind me of cough medicine!!! 燨r the drinks are good but the food is uninspiring!!! 燱ell my friends, since I am observing temperance with liquor to begin the New Year, the food part of this story will be central. This past week, I dined with my friend Janice, (who claims to be a restaurant critic that is soon to be discovered), I trekked down to the Original El Tepeyac Caf�on Evergreen, in the heart of East LA. The restaurant has a modest space twelve to fifteen seats plus a with a counter and ample parking. 燭he atmosphere is lively and the patrons like Los Angeles itself, come from a cross-section of our colorful city. 燱hat brings patrons from all parts of the city to this Caf� 營t's the food, and it's muy excellente. 燩ortions are large and you'll always seem to leave with half of your food in a to-go bag. 營'm telling you, I unwisely tried to order the whole menu so I could give a full report on this restaurant, but I failed, the portions are too big. I asked the server for a few suggestions and I went with the Taquitos with Guacamole ($7), as soon as saw this plate arrive, I realized that I ordered for a whole team and not just for the two of us. 燦ext was the Manuel tacos, my friend Janice wouldn't share, but by the look in her eyes, I can tell she was pleased, or was it that I am handsome? 燱hy does it always have to be one or the other? Okay it was the food!! Next, I tried the signature dish at El Tepeyac, the burrito, my selection was the #2 A chile Colorado at ($10) this is a great dish and is pork slowly simmered in a red chili sauce. 燭hat is Mexican Heaven! You know it is good when the men in blue (cops) are dinning there on a regular basis. 燭he Hollenbeck Burrito is a favorite of the police and is ($8.25) and comes with chips and guacamole. 燦ext time I'm going to order the Okie de Pollo...shredded chicken breast at ($8.50) It is a curious name, what does El Tepeyac mean? It is the hill that the Virgin Mary was sighted on!!! 燭his place is a shrine as well! No beer or wine.

5 lbs burrito? Come again? You read it right. Me n my brother decided to try this place after watching man vs food, it just looked amazing on TV so we had to try it. We ordered the El Tepeyac special and when it came out we couldn't believe our eyes. We ate n ate and didn't even get through half of it.

By far, the biggest burrito I have ever had in my life! Cheap price, good service, EXCELLENT food. Remember to give the fries a try. I shared a burrito with 2 others and we barely skimmed the half way line at the end of our meal. This is how good their burrito is- my sister who has been a vegetarian for well over 2 years was one of those 'others' who shared the BEEF burrito with me. MMHMM! That is ALL I need to say. Try it and you won't regret it. I promise you. BEWARE! Lines are long! So if your planning on a quick meal, avoid El Tepeyac. I suggest you give this place a try when you have friends(who can eat :P), time, and a mighty appetite.

This place is amazing. Great food, decent prices, a city landmark and the place is literally world famous. I can honestly recommend anything on this menu to be great. I've seen some people post about Glorias in Downey, Ca. At best that place comes maybe at 60% to Manuel's Tepeyac. And of course their prices are cheaper, its cheaper quality food. All and all, hands down, Tepeyac is a great, authentic place to bring the family whether you're just sharing some taquitos with a friend for a light lunch, or bringing your family for some true mexican food feasting.

Went earlier today with my brother, and as always, the Hollenbeck served its purpose. 燚elicious, spicy, tomatoe-y broth filled with chunks of carnitas and 爌ockets of guacamole throughout the burrito. Service was fast as always. I guess ever since this place was featured on Man vs Food, business has shot up for Manuel. Good for him though, he works there ALL the time, he was even there today and offered me a beer.

moving to east LA meant (among other things) that i had to be introduced to el tepeyac, or manuel's as some call it. the first trip here i was underwhelmed, i think i had a burrito of some kind. the second time, however, i got the chile relleno. jackpot. every time since then, i get the chile relleno. it's HUGE, and if you get the dinner version (with beans & rice) it's definitely enough to share with another person, and STILL have leftovers. my suggestion- ask for an extra flour tortilla before you leave (they will charge you 75 or 90 cents for this, but it's worth it) and use whatever beans, rice, and chile you have left to make a burrito. then you can take your leftovers to go and have them the next day, when you're still craving manuel's but don't want to drive there again. also, their guacamole is awesome. and get the horchata. for a chile relleno dinner plate, plus 2 horchatas and a side of guacamole, we spend around $20, including tip. and it's really not in a dangerous area, just don't go snooping around in the yards of the houses on that street. as long as you park in the parking lot, eat, and leave, you have nothing to worry about.

This restaurant is majorly over rated. It is a perfect example of a home favorite who got to popular for its own good. They were on the travel channel and the food network and I went back after seeing them on T.V. to go and reminisce on an old favorite. 燘ut I was so disappointed with the quality of the food it was flavorless and I had better food at taco bell who doesn't even use real beef. Manuel needs to go back in the kitchen and do some quality control on his product. I feel like instead having people return because of the food he is now putting his faith on his customer's loyalty and his television appearances. So don't think I am some rookie either because I have been coming to this spot with friends and family all my life and slowly they have been getting worse till I stop going all together. But try it out because it might be your taste in food because people on TV sure act like they like it.

The first time I came here, it was a hole in the wall, and it still is. 燘ut the food is great and there's always a 20minute line, but worth waiting for. 燭he giant 6 pound Manuel's special is worth ordering, comes in pork, beef, or chicken and easily satisfies 4-6 adults. 營f you don't want to wait in line, go to their side window and eat at the covered outdoor section. If you see an overly friendly short old man chatting it up, your seeing the one and only Manuel, who started the place 50 years ago.

I found out about this place from an episode of Man vs Food where a ginormous burrito could be tackled. I tried to tackle it, but I hit my wall. I ate the whole burrito, but there were a lot of burrito guts leaving the burrito, so that didn't count. The service was great. Our server kept checking on us after we hit our walls. I guess she could see our struggle. There was a little line to come in, but we didn't wait that long. Manuel came out and greeted us; he gave us a little offering before seating us. He was a lot of fun.

First time coming to El Tepeyac, waited in line for about 45+minutes. 燳ou could see people outside taking pictures with an older man, whom I think its Manuel. 燗fter that I was seated in an over crowded restaurant, all the tables and chairs to close for my personal taste. Yes its big! Yes you prob can't finish it all in one sitting! I order the chicken burrito, My only complains are they present the burrito a bit too bland looking. 燤y had ranchera sauce which was good, but it had no sour cream, 爋r guacamole on side. No cheese on top of the burrito. So i was a bit disappointed at that. The hot salsa was okay, could of been better. The horchata was decent to pretty good, not too sweet. Doesn't taste artificial. This place is better as 爐akeout than to eat 爄n, since you have the feeling that the staff want you to hurry with your meal and go, since other people are waiting in line to be seated. Can't wait until they open the new one in City of Industry, hoping for a better experience.

I've heard a lot about this place for awhile so my b/f and I decided to finally go. We went in with high expectations, but we were a little disapointed. It's a friendly enviroment, quaint but the food was ok. I've had better food (and I am not talking about Taco Bell or that other crap), and it didn't seem that the food was fresh. We got there around dinner time and the food came out a little too quick. A little bland and chewy for the most part, but hey can't beat an $8 burrito the size of your head.

Huge, bland burritos. Really that's it. The place is an institution, but the food his HIGHLY overrated. And not cheap either. But it has a cute atmosphere and everyone that works here is really friendly. If you want to soak up the east-los vibe without getting sketchy, come here for dinner. Just don't have high expectations. Actually, come to think of it the guac is pretty good, but it is expensive too.

Unfortunately this is a somewhat of a BASHING!!!!!!!!!!!!! Hello everyone, I am here to write about a place that I have been eating at for about 28 years, and my parents visited before they were married. The place I am talking about is Manuel's El Tepeyac in Boyle Heights on Evergreen across the street from Assumption church. As a young boy I walked through two different gang territories to eat at Manuel's because I loved the food so much. I was even jumped and robbed on one occasion in front of the Evergreen Cemetery. I loved the beans, I would order a plate of beans and eat it with a tortilla, or I would order a plain bean and cheese burrito. As I got older I ventured out, and tried other dishes on the menu. The item that I became attached to is the Hollenbeck, I love this burrito and have to satisfy my craving every now and then. Unfortunately I have noticed a change in the place I risked my life to eat at as a young boy. It seems the home style food I grew up loving has turned into a fast food Mexican restaurant!!! Those of you that think it is authentic and delicious now, you would be mesmerized at how good it was back in the day. The food had so much more flavor to it. The beans, the rice, the salsa, and the guacamole all had their distinct taste. Now it seems the taste level has been turned down on everything. The guacamole even looks different! It was fresh before, and now it looks and taste like pasty store bought guacamole...YUK!!!!!!!!! Yesterday 4/13/09 I ate at Manuel's with my girlfriend, and as usual I ordered a Hollenbeck. We were at the outside patio, so I was able to look in the kitchen and watch the cooks prepare the food. I was surprised to see young new faces working in the kitchen. The service was terrible, the food usually comes fast, but yesterday, we were waiting and waiting for our food. Once we picked up our food, and I ripped into my burrito, I noticed the taste was not the same. I opened up my burrito, and inspected it, and to my surprise, there was no beans!!!!! I have to admit, I have been frustrated and disappointed with Manuel's for a while due to there reduction in flavor. For me this experience was the straw that broke the camel's back. I love the place and will give it another chance, but I can't help to dislike what it has turned into. I feel it is a tourist attraction, and filled with people who order a Manuel special because they seen it on a TV program, or have read about it on some food review site. Manuel's has lost it's comfortable, home style Mexican food feeling and taste!!! On Fridays I would go to Manuel's, take a shot of tequila with Manuel, listen to good music, and eat good food. Now I wont go near the place on Fri evenings, or Sat, due to the long lines. Don't get me wrong there has always been a line outside, but now they are longer and the food is not as good. I am happy the place is making good money and is known and enjoyed by so many people. On the other hand, I also feel it has a responsibility to maintain the good quality food that gave the restaurant such fame popularity. I have NOT joined this site to tell everyone about my favorite restaurants, and secret jewels where I like to eat. I don't want these places to transform into tourist attractions and loose it's identity like Manuel's has. Instead I am here to inform people of the places I have tried and do not like. As a young boy I risked my life to eat at Manuel's because I loved the good food, but now Manuel's is breaking my heart...

I've been coming here since 1971 and I only recently found out that it's real name is El Tepeyac, since everybody always called it "Manuel's." Definitely not a place for nouvelle palates. Like Proust's madeleine, one whiff from the kitchen is enough to push a thousand nostalgia buttons. I live in New York, but I try to make the pilgrimage whenever I'm in L.A. 營 have a vague memory of Manuel offering a cash prize to anybody who could eat a "Special Burrito" in one sitting. The stuff of legends.

I went with a bunch of co-workers to try out this famous place. Everyone at work always said how good this place was. When I got there I realized we were eating at a house...literally its a house that has been I guess the best word is "mex-family-style converted" into a a little restaurant. Its surrounded by residential houses. The menu is a giant plastic board fastened to a neighbors fence. The prices I remember being kinda pricey and it looks like they are constantly changing from all the different writing alterations on the board. A crappy building... fine, high prices...no big deal I can live with those minor set backs all I really care about is how the food tastes anyways. I shared 爐he biggest burrito they have with a co-worker, I have to say it was effin gross, I had about 3 bites and had to tap out due to my gag reflex. The chili is just watered down and has more spice than actual flavor, the meat is chunky and also lacks flavor. Maybe I prefer my Mexican food white boy style but If I want good Mexican food I'd rather go to King taco & Carambas. The Guy from Man Vs Food is a liar when he reviewed this place! LOL. This place however still has a lot of really good reviews so I still recommend to try it out for yourself and you be the judge. Disclaimer: Some of my more seasoned LA relatives have informed me there was another Manuel's in Lincoln Heights & it was closed down due to using horse meat in their food. Thats right Sea Biscuit was spending his final days rolled up in a damn tortilla.

One of our pastors at church got the $31 burrito from this place for our friend's birthday. I think it was the party size of the Manuel's Special. It was so good! We had enough to serve a party of 15, and we had some left. It was so delicious. It was hot and fresh, and it was filled with flavor. It' was absolutely fantastic.

All I remember is waiting in line for about 1/2 hour and wondering if my car parked in the neighborhood across the street was going to get jacked, eating a huge plate of something that was pretty good, seeing the wait staff walk by with burritos the size of babies, and not paying a lot for all the food.

This is my favorite Mexican Food on the planet! I've been eating at "Manuel's" since I was a kid. That's over 30 years of consistently good food! The Hollenbeck Burrito is my favorite, my wife gets the Taquitos and we always get a half order of guacamole (which feeds 2-3 people). I've only dined inside a handful of times, I always opt for ordering and sitting outside to avoid the wait. Definitely worth trying if you enjoy authentic Mexican food.

To clarify, five stars for the service, history, and character of the joint and three stars for the quality of the food. We get there and line up and Manuel himself comes out to chat us up and entertain us. We get to the front of the line where he talks to us a bunch and suddenly we find ourselves with four shots of a particular Mexican beverage to kick off our dining experience. 燭he total wait time on a Saturday afternoon was about 15 minutes. The host mistakes our party for a party of four instead of five. When we tell him we can squeeze into the table he brought us to he insists that he just combine the table nearby and we get more than enough room to spread out. We each order a burritos and they're out in no time. 燳ou do not need to order a burritos each. Unless you are or want to be obese, one burritos for two people is more than enough. 燗lso, don't expect to eat with your hands unless you're Shaq. My Hollenbeck burritos is giant of course. It tastes ok and is pretty soggy with sauce. 燭he cuts of pork that are inside and outside my burrito seem to be stewed. 燭he whole burrito seems like it came out of a slow cooker including the sauce. 燭he guacamole is really tasty but there wasn't enough on my plate. My co-eaters had plenty though. You will probably have leftovers in which case the waitress will gladly pack it all up for you. No mess on your hands. The meal came out to $10 a person and we all had almost 3/4 of a burrito to take home with us. 燗 great deal.

After seeing this on Man vs. Food, i had to try it. We finally had a chance to go there yesterday. It was totally awesome. My daughter and son-in-law had the hollenback burritos (they were huge) and i had the koko special (beef enchiladas with eggs of easy). The food was great, the service was great, the people were fun and friendly. Manuel is so funny. He's a wonderful man. Everyone needs to go here. Warning, it's a small cafe.

The best Machaca in the Universe! You must eat here! I went to college in LA in the mid 1970s and we used to come here at 2 AM in the morning for late dinner. This is by far the BEST MEXICAN Food I have ever eaten in my 56 years on the planet. I eat Mexican food for about 5 meals a week for the last 30 years, I even dream in Spanish and changed my name from William to Guillermo. LOL Anyway, Manuel, the 75? year old owner, is the happiest little Hispanic leprechaun. He pops in and out with a bottle of tequila and gives patrons a free shot and some kind words and thanks for coming by. The Manuel Special Burrito is a GIANT version of their best sellers. The Special weighs in at about 5 LBS and can seriously feed 2 or 3 hungry people. Their Guacamole is chunky and creamy and fresh. Everything you eat here will take a few days off your life, but oh is it worth it. If I could only eat at 1 place for the rest of my life, El Tepeyac would be that place. It would be a short life, but a very happy one...

If you are looking for something cheap, with huge portions. Go to El Tepeyac!!! Nestled away in the heart of East LA, you can find yourself waiting in line for a table. But if you don't have time, you can go on ahead and do a phoner(short for phone order). FYI make sure you give them enough time, or you will be waiting for 10-15mins. Hollenbeck De Asada, a must try!!! Or if you're having a party/group event go for their Manuels Special which will serve about 8 ppl.

My friend treated a few of us to the Manuel special burrito that fed three men (all can hold their own when it comes to food) and me. He ordered taquitos as well, which comes with a generous amount of excellent guac, lettuce, and tomatoes. The burrito was the hugest I've ever seen, probably one of the best I've ever eaten, and came smothered with melted cheese, tomatoes, sauce, filled with rice, lots of meat, and yummy flavor! I enjoyed every bite. We got there around 1pm and for some reason, there was a long line on the inside, but not the outside. We found a table outside right away, and the weather was perfect to eat outdoors. The private lot is convenient.

What a great experience today. Got a chance to visit the legendary location that I've heard about forever. Went as part of a group. Was greeted in the parking lot by the man himself, Manuel. He treated us as if we were long lost family members. This man is quite a character! Happy, upbeat and funny as hell! Ordered the famous Hollenbeck. Holy smokes! Although it's not as big as a Manuel's Special that was two seats down it's still quite a challenge to power down. Asked for extra Jalapenos in and on the side. Like my food a bit on the spicy side. Gotta say..... this was a pretty good burrito! The pork was tender and flavorful, the green sauce was tasty and the jalapenos gave it a little kick. Tried but couldn't put it away. Chased down every piece of pork though.... couldn't leave that behind. What really made this experience one to remember is the stories that Manuel told us during our meal. What a great person. It's like talking to your uncle at a family gathering. Made us all feel right at home. You can go to restaurants and get great food but it's not too often that you get a great meal and feel like you're really appreciated as a customer. 燤anuel made me a fan for life! I'll be coming back to try his taquitos. Man did they look good! Get by El Tepeyac, say "Hey" to Manuel and ask him about his little twinkie and ding dongs.

I thought the price for the monster was a little high, $23 to be exact. 燘ut I guess it was worth it because of all the hype and notoriety it got from Man vs Food. �I would definitely come back and go for a smaller burrito like the Hollenbeck, it's actually big but not as big as the almighty Manuel burrito!!

One of my all time favorites. 營 love this place and look forward to every visit. 燭he owner Manuel Rojas is a good guy who enjoys interacting with his customers. 營f he likes you, he might even offer you a drink ; ) 燭he food is consistently good. 燳ou definetly need to try the famous Hollenback Burrito, which is their claim to fame. 營'm a fan of their home made Menudo and Huevos Rancheros. 營 enjoy these three dishes so much and rarely deviate to other menu options. 燜INAL VERDICT: Food 5/5 comfort food, Ambiance 4/5 old school diner, Service 4/5 if you run into Manuel and it's not too busy, he'll treat you well. 燘e careful though, he might try to sneek in to hug and kiss your lady.

not really Mexican food, more like Chicano food. Its not the cuisine my Tias execute in Guadalajara or Tepa. Its the food found in that hole in the wall that places like Claimjumpers blew out of. Do not go if you are on a carb, a-kins, moon, wait watcher, johnny creg, metubullife, vanity, healthfood, veggie, low cholesterol, high protein, or any kind of diet. Please,,, the guacamole side alone will make you all misty eyed!! Large portions. $10 will fill you for the visit, and leave leftovers that will either call your name in the middle of the night or scare you off every time you open the fridge. This will continue for about a week. By the way,,, youre welcome!

I have enjoyed El Tepeyac for 35 years. I now live out of State but when I am in town I always stop in a few times. I would and should give El Tepeyac 5 stars but they don't have Lengua or cabesa. Manuel is a rock star and still slinging Tequila to a few lucky customers :-) Food can be magical when it fills our stomach with nutrition and memories.

Our waitress messed up the order but, I think it was me mumbling & maybe her thick accent which combined for mis-communication (and we got free food so who's complaining)!

It's a far drive, but worth a try. Remember - there IS a parking lot. So park there. We automatically looked for street parking, walked up the hill, and then found out there was a parking lot, FREE too. Very good information to have. The burritos are also HUGE, like MASSIVE. They're known for their 5lb burritos, which was on Man vs Food. It's a good size, so if you get one, you can share between 4 people at least. If you get a normal burrito, you can DEFINITELY split it between two people. The burritos are enormous and meaty, it's not the best burrito I've ever had, it's just more amazing to see the size of them.

I have been looking forward to eating here for a long time. Ever since I saw this on the Travel Channel I knew it was the place for me. We waited a while to get in because our party was very long. Our waitress wasn't pleased with us because two of our party were late. Which I understand sucks, but we tip well and she didn't appreciate her being so rude to us. She was very pushy, but we felt bad so we dealt with it. The burritos were just as big as everyone says but so delicious I have no words. Few of us in our group were able to consume our entire humungous burritos. We had an amazing dinner. One problem is, (besides the extremely pushy waitress) was that Ted ordered a burrito without beans and his came with beans. Oh well, he sort of ate around them. We would totally go back again (but with a smaller group to ensure quicker seating). Needless to say, it was amazing!!!!!!!

It was around 5pm on a Friday my girlfriend and i took the trip to la to eat MANUELS SPECIAL BURRITO DE POLLO. We ordered to go because it was pretty jam packed. I gave the place a four star because the burrito was good the service was fast however id like it if they were a little bit more sanitary. I brought the food to glendale and it was still hot. We enjoyed the burrito but couldnt get passed half of it. The food sat pretty nice not like other mexican restaurants. I will go back time to time to enjoy Manuels special burrito and then some.

After several years of abstinence from "El", a friend invited me here and the food was much better than the last couple of visits. 燭he machaca was meaty and flavorful, 爐he flautas large and crunchy with the cooled homemade guacomole, the portions large, and the waitress was efficient and friendly! 營f I got this all the time, I would bump them up to a 4, but the lack of consistency make them a 3. 燭he problem is that they seem to cook whatever they get--if it's old and stringy, feed 'em; if it's tender and flavorful, feed 'em--quality control needs to be better.

oh, el tepeyac - you are glorious. and you never, ever let me down. being that el tepeyac is around the corner and down the street from my grandma's house, i've been feasting on this stuff since i was a kid. whenever someone asks me where they can get good mexican food, i always suggest el tepeyac and say "it's not the same anywhere else." the manuel's special is GINORMOUS and absolutely delicious (so is the smaller hollenbeck). i suggest you get it with extra sauce as it makes it extra delicious - the meat gets more tender, it's more wet and just amazing. it's the perfect combination of rice, beans and yummy guac! speaking of the guac, it's the FRESHEST guac i've ever had. i love getting the taquitos here because of the fact that it comes with a heaping of guac, and it's sooooo delicious! i also love the hard tacos - the shell is pure crispy perfection, and the veggies and cheese in it are super fresh. the shredded beef in there is done to perfection as well. i also enjoy the chicken quesadillas. now that i live up north and far away from my beloved el tepeyac, i find myself having regular cravings of this stuff. and of course, i find that i must stop by every time i come home!

I heard about this place and was in the area, so I stopped by. Had to stand in line outside for 30 mins to get in. It's a small ma and pa Mexican American place with room for just about 30 people inside. Food comes fast once you get in and everyone leaves with a box with their leftovers. Plenty of food. Burritos covered in red sauce and cheese. Monstrous portions leave you leaving good and the prices aren't that bad.

The food is okay, but not great. Not to mention the long lines. El Tepeyac is located in the heart of Boyle Heights where is has been for the past 50 plus years. It has become very popular over the years so that only means that the quality of the food also goes down. It became even more popular as it was featured on an episode of Man Vs. Food. I remember as a kid that the food was delicious, but now the food is nothing out of the ordinary. Last time that I went, the lines were ridiculously long! People of different parts of Los Angeles come to eat at this restaurant. The menu has grown over the years and now features other popular Mexican items. Tried the chile verde burrito as well as the carne asada burrito. The burritos were really expensive, so I was expecting something big and delicious. The burritos were big, but not as big as I imagines. I wasn't trying to compare them to the Manuel Special burritos, but I was expecting them to be bigger than most burritos. The chile verde burrito was really sloppy, not in a good way. There was more watered down beans in the burrito than the carne con chile verde. The carne asada burrito was pretty dry. I really regret not going to smaller hole-in-the-wall Mexican restaurant near by that is not over rated. I don't think that I will be going back to El Tepeyac.

Completely agree with others about large portions, small flavor. (But not that huge). Got one of the burritos as takeout and took it home to eat with g/f and once we finished it, we were still hungry, mind you we were already really hungry.

HUGE burritos. The burritos come with guacamole which is a rarity. Split the burritos if your not a huge eater otherwise you will have left overs for days.

I am not a newbie to Tepeyacs's food. I was born and raised in neighboring Echo Park;but only came to know the famous "Manuel's Special" while hanging out with my buddies from Salesian High School during the '80s. And now that I work in Boyle Heights, I have had the great pleasure of reacquanting myself with the tried and true deliciousness of Manuel's food. I was fortunate to run into Manny, the famous and beloved owner of Tepeyac, this morning. He greeted me as if I was an old family member and was truly gracious and funny. He claims that the reason he has been so prosperous is that he lives each moment to the fullest and is happy to share his food. That being said, I -along with my coworkers received a bounty of goodness from him: 燼 footlong Machaca burrito, several plates of taquitos (with shredded beef) and authentic guacamole, the Hollenbeck burrito, fresh tortillas chips and of course, their red hot salsa and the milder salsa. We were overwhelmed with his generosity. Besides the food being always delicious and very fresh, the owner Manny is a true gem!

I love Tepeyac!!! I can not stress that enough. 燤y family and I have been eating here for several years and I have never been disappointed. The flavors and quality of food have always been consistently great. 營t's a staple in the community and has been feature in several TV segments for its large portions and down right yummy flavors. 燳et with all the acclaims it has received I love how it has maintained the same hole in the wall appearance and atmosphere. 燭he prices are reasonable and are well worth the quality and large portions. My absolute favorite there is anything with machaca (shredded beef with egg). 燭he machaca at Tepeyac is the best I've had and is the standard to which I compare machaca at other establishments....they never even match up. I will say that in the many years I have eaten here, I have never once actually had my meal inside. 燭here's always a wait to get seated. 燤y family and I just automatically go to the outside window. 燱hich is quick and easy and we usually have good luck about getting a table. 燬omething that they have started outside is the table service. 燳ou still order at the window, but once you find a table and seat yourself you just hand your receipt over to the waitress/waiter and they will bring you your food, which I think is great and has helped to alleviate the normally congested window and blocked wall menu. 燭his is a place that has been around for over 50 years and could easily last another 50 years with the great product it is producing.

I love mexican food. Who doesn't? But there are tiers of mexican food out there such as high quality amazing , high quality crappy , 燾rappy quality but amazing and crappy quality crappy food. I would say that 燛l tepeyac falls into the category of fair 爍uality and UH MAZING food. What a find. Setting: really low key, busy inside and busy outside. Im not saying this is Uhmazing food if you like Craft or AOC but it's good honest food. I like getting mine to go and picking up a bunch of El goya ginger beer, going home and gorging till I am in pseudo coma. This is not a place to go and dine. It is a pig out joint. My favorite!! Chili Relleno. Hands down. But i'm just that type of girl. I have had two burritos the hollenbeck, Everyone on here suggested it. It was good but I like more stuff in my burrito and not on it. The chunks of meat were delicious but I like a more fluid burrito. Every bite proportionate to the goodness. I was in search of the one that I had seen a girl order ( i was a dumbass and didn't go up and ask her... I still have no clue which one it was but i'm determined to find out) The next one I had was the oki chili verde. This one was really great. I would get it again if I wasn't now stuck on the relleno. When I am allowed back in the country I will be trying more and submitting some pictures! Till then I hope this 爏uffices to make you go here and try this place.

Finally ... 燜inally, after all these years ... Finally, I know exactly what my future baby will look like when I dress him up as a burrito for Halloween. 燱hat am I talking about? WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT!!!?? �.. 燘ecause I'm talking about the ginormous, mouth-watering burritos being served up at Manuel's El Tepeyac. 燭hanks to our GRUB buddy Steven A, it was one of the first GRUB-suggestions we got back in the day when we started up this crazy journey ... and after Jim R. gave us some more encouragement towards the mayhem-of-Mexico ... the time for a GRUB-revolution was finally upon us. 燭his hole-in-the-wall over in East LA is definitely a local institution ... packed on a Sunday night, we patiently waited 爓ith enthusiasm in a line outside ... for the opportunity to dine on the soon-to-be-yum being devoured inside. 燱e started out with an order of their cool-n-creamy guacamole and layered it on a basket of their deliciously-super-fried-and-crunchy chips. 燭hey're those deep-fried, not-from-a-bag, I'm-a-little-nervous-they're-actually-a-trap chips that make my knees weak and my belly strong. 燭o go along with the guacamole, they served up a couple dishes of homemade salsa ... one a tangy verde and the other a fire-breathing roja ... both amazing ... and both just prepping our taste-buds for the monster lurking around the corner. 燱e all knew of Manuel's reputation. 燱e thought we were prepared. 燗fter all, there were three of us ready to battle the beast ... and a battle it truly was. 燗s we gazed at the menu, our first challenge was to pick between the several varieties of the Manuel's Special ... ranging from carne aside to machaca, or seasoned ground beef, to our ultimate pick ... chile verde. 燭he burrito is not only huge ... it's damn tasty. 燣oaded up with tender chunks of pork, bathed in a green chile sauce, paired up with rice and beans, all topped with a healthy layer of salsa and shredded cheese. 燗ll the ingredients melted together as we ate and each bite brought a giant smile to our faces. 燱e did our best, and only took down about two-thirds of the baby-sized burrito ... nothing to be ashamed of. 營t wasn't until after we finished that we noticed the free shirt you'd get if you finish it all by yourself. �So with the GRUB-nation as my witness ... I will be back. 燭he gauntlet has been thrown down ... the challenge made ... a war will be waged, and we will rise victoriously through the GRUB. 燗nd screw it, even if we don't ... it'll be amazing. 燘ecause that's the sort of place Manuel's is ... the giant burrito is no gimmick ... they've just got the goods ... and lucky for us ... they've got a lot of it.

And I wouldn't be surprised to hear "Hey I'll be back I'm going back to Manuel's to pick up another one." 營 don't know what it is about the chile in these things that makes it so damn irresistible! The melted ooey gooey cheese, the cool guac and the hot-perfectly spiced-fall apart tender meat and the sauce on top, seriously, you can't deny it.

Five stars, baby. This place is money. I prefer the Reuben burrito, but the Hollenbeck is awesome, too. Do yourself a favor and order your burrito wet- it's gonna be a little slice of heaven. Tacos, taquitos, enchiladas, salsa, chips, guacamole-everything is good in this joint, and it has the crowds to prove it. Don't be fooled by imitations- go to Manuel's Original on Evergreen.

I absolutley love El Tepeyec!!! It is the best and most authentic Mexican good you can ever have in Southern Cali. This resteraunt has been apart of my family for over 50 years. My parents ate there before they left on their honeymoon. You have to try the Hollenbeck de Machaca...absolutley delicious! If you're up for it...try the Manuel's special at least once in your life.

Been going here for over 30 years. This is a LA must. It is a love hate relationship with good ol Manuels. I've been going there with my family for over 30 years. The food is the best Mexican-American food out there. I say Mex-American because of the choices of cheese and portions they offer. You go to Manny's for the food, not the ambiance and part of the city. They have not changed the decor and 爐he wait staff since I've been going there. 營 would suggest Manny's for a late breakfast, you will probably not finish the plate and will likely not be hungry for the rest of the day or week! I thoroughly enjoy and can't seem to order anything else but 1. Machaca dinner (or burritto), 2. IIuevos Rancheros or 3. Enchiladas Rancheras. 營 seldom order anything else because those are the definite best plates. That is why I love this place, why I might hate it a little is that it is this insane quantity of food that makes it so unhealthy. Do your self a favor and order a dish amongst friends and share.

A Classic! I love the owner Manuel, my family and I have been coming here for years, he always makes you feel like your his number one customer from the sneaky pour of presidente or cuervo, to us placing his bets at Santa Anita. He makes this place as enjoyable as the beef enchiladas of which have the best 爎ed sauce 爐hat I have ever had, topped with graded cheese, they are truly delicious. The taquitos are topped with gobs of fresh guacamole! The classic Holenbeck is named after the local police station � no wonder the main ingredient is pork' This classic has however gone a bit skimpy on certain things but still a wonderful place.

breakfast was too bland, salt it up a little bit pops! to pricey for an Okie and some breakfast. The burrito is tons of beans, rice, sour cream, beef or other choice of meat, with a tortilla wrapping it, blanket style....not impressed, thanks for the $ to quantity ratio but i guess we compromise flavor.

Largest and best tasting machaca burrito ever! So big, it is actually two meals for the very, very low price of one. This is one of my all-time favorite restaurants in LA. It's perfect for friends and dates. Seating can be limited, and I have frequently seen long lines form outside to get a table. Try sitting at the counter, if you don't mind. It's family owned, so it looks and feels very mom-and-pop - super cozy. 燛l Tepeyac has been in LA for generations. My parents used to go on their first dates here. My dad remembers Manuel (the owner) serving everyone in the restaurant free shots of tequila. The food is the epitome of Los Angeles Mexican cuisine. Love it! Love it!

If your hungry, and I'm not talking about, "Oh I din't have lunch today" hungry, I'm talking about "I'll seriously kill a cow with my bare hands" hungry, then get the Manuel's special.

Well, I finally got a chance to try El Tepeyac. After seeing it on Man V Food I thought it would be a good place to check out so I put it on my list. Well I was in L.A. last weekend so I thought I would check a few places off that list. I tried Phillipe's for lunch and El Tepeyac for dinner. And yes I was a bit to full to move after those two meals in the same day. ��I ordered the Hollenbeck burrito which I was told is the "small" version of the Manuel's special. I have found that "small" is in the eye of the beholder. This thing was HUGE!!! 營 was headed back to my hotel so I ordered it to go. When I got back I opened the clam shell to find that this thing filled the box completely from corner to corner. It had to weigh at least 3lbs. I started in and found it to be very good. The meat was tender and delicious. The green chile sauce was a very good compliment to the overall flavor. I will have to say that it did have a bit to much rice for me. It looks like that's how they make it so huge, Lots of rice filler. Over all I was pretty happy with my Burrito experience and would definitely go back for another round.

Came here with my gf after we saw it on TV. The Manuel Special is definitely one of the biggest burrito's we've ever had. It ended feeding my family of five. The inside seating was full and crowded so we just ordered outside; it took about 15 minutes. We ordered pork... it was okay. Probably should have tried the beef or chicken instead. Sure, I'd go back again.

When I attended CSULA and lived in the SGV I would often eat at Manuel's since 1968. 營 hadn't been there for years as I migrated away. 燞owever, the other day I was passing by the area and decided I had to stop by the best Mexican cafe I had ever eaten. 燨ver the last 42 years its menu has remained 爐he same. 燭he only difference I 爊oted over the years is a change in the machaca. 燦ow it is almost all meat with some onions, egg, and cheese. 燨riginally, it had more eggs, cheese, 爂reen peppers, tomatoes, jalapenos and, I think garlic. 營 don't know why you would change the original recipe which I preferred. 燘ut it was still good but not as tasty and a blander version of what I remember. 燭he Hollenbeck 爎emains the same as I recalled it but with more pork and less guacamole, tomato, and was just not as good as the original. 燬till, the food is better than any other Mexican I've found in my life. Returned to my favorite Mexican cafe and ordered the machaca dinner. 燤anny must have seen my review because the machaca had some jalapeno although it was sliced very thin and there wasn't much but it gave the machaco some punch. 燭here were other adjustments back to how it was prepared as I remember it back to the 60's. 營t was tastier than the last time but still not as much taste as I remember the original recipe. �http://www.youtube.com/w�I don't know why I go back to El Tepeyac since it is not as good as it was in the 70's. 營 suppose it's for the nostalgia. 燱hen we were in school, it was a reasonably priced local diner. 燬ometime in the 80's they bought the house next door for a parking lot, doubled the prices and lowered the quality, if not the quantity. 營 can't understand why I would pay eleven dollars for a burrito of five dollar, or lessor quality. 營 know there are better burritos out there for half the price, such as, King Taco. 燤anny's has been gouging his patrons based on the reputation of his early years. 營 feel foolish since I am not paying for good food, but for memories. It's a lot like having a chili dog at Pink's for three dollars. 燳ou could have the same thing at home for a fraction of the price. 燩eople go to some places because they have somehow become monuments to ancient history.

Love..... love love love.... what else can I say. We went on a sunday around 11am and wanted to sit inside. The wait to get a table did not even phase us since we had the best entertainment in the world- Manuel himself! We love this guy. He is so sweet, so funny, so knowledgable, and just a real joy to talk to. We just enjoyed how old school he is and how all of the big time stuff does not even phase him. He is great with kids and my son says that "he still has the moves". Once we got inside, we felt at home. The atmosphere was so wonderful, it reminded me of having a family party. My husband and I kept saying how much our family would love the place. The people are so friendly and a couple of the staff even bring shots around, even Manuel himself. Every item there tastes like heaven. My husband and son loved their menudo and I had to taste one of the world famous burritos. I am soooo glad I did. It was heaven, every bite was perfect. It reminded me of something my family would make, except HUGE and so much tastier (sorry family). I will also be enjoying it for lunch shortly. I also ordered the chips and guacamole, which was sooo fresh and sooo good. I also brought that back home and finished them last night and was still in heaven. My kids had cheese quesadillas and they were definitely authentic with cheese gooing everywhere. My husband also HAD to try the huevos rancheros and the bites I stole were amazing! For the food you get, the prices are so inexpensive. The experience was definitely worth more. As people leave Manuel like to shake hands with the guys and 爂ive the ladies pecks on the cheek as well as handy out twinkies or ding dongs to the kids, as well as candy. This place is our new home away from home, any trip to LA is not complete without a stop to the El Tepeyac Cafe, the original one!

Alright so i think it was pumped up a bit too much by Adam (Man vs. Food) but i must say it was pretty good. I had a mixed Manuel's Special Burrito which is not on the menu, but thanks to the great service staff they hooked it up, the gigantic burrito was being placed on the table as i returned from the restroom and since i was starving this gets big props from me for fast service. It was two of us and we thought we could finish the Burrito, man we were wrong. El Tepeyac states that this Burrito feeds about 4, I know for a fact, it can "stuff" 4 people. so they get credit for the huge portions as well. People kept coming in non stop while i was there and everyone came in with a smile and ready to pig out, im sure..... The restaurant is small, but it seems to be kept very clean and the prices are more than fair. ($16.50 will stuff 4 adults with the Manuel's Burrito) I am definatelly looking forward to go back to try some of their other dishes.... by the way, we arrived around 3:30pm on a Thursday and walked right in and sat down... no waiting..

Order some chips to start. 燱e were given a cup of green and red salsa for dipping. 燗sked for second cup of the red salsa as we both like red. 營 was told "no" and was a little surprised by the blunt response. Coworker ordered one of the pork burritos and said he pretty much didn't like it from the start. 營 ordered the chicken burrito mainly because it listed just three ingredients - chicken, tomatoes an onion. 燭hat is what I like! 燘ut it came stuffed also with beans and rice - which I don't like. 燗ll other burritos mention having refried beans but not this one. �Oh well. Portions were huge. 燘ut overall the taste was just sort of bland. 燙ertainly an odd and interesting place, not only the location but also the staff. 燘ut I wouldn't go back. Also, we looked at the window on the way out. 燭he health inspection rating was a B! 燭ried to look online and see why they had a B rating but no luck finding the health report. I would say if you want to check out the hype, give it a try. 營 don't think you'll be blown away by anything other then the portion size, but the rest is just OK, and the service seems like a bit of an inside joke. 燣ike if you don't know that they are rude, you'll be upset. 燬ort of like the soup nazi on Seinfeld.

So that is a big plus that this place is consistent so its delish every time you go. i got the oakie which was so big....i had some trouble later that night if you catch my drift. I was extremely satisfied with this food. the sauce was not to watery or too thick. The beef was tender, and the portion... insane! The price is great for what you get... a 2-3 pound burrito easily feeds two maybe three....in my case... just me...lol the wait is sometimes a hassle, but the line moves surprisingly fast.

I ordered the Okie Asada Burrito which says to allow 20 min for prep .. it came out in 5 min, it was not even temp hot.. it was cold.. and there was absolutely NO FLAVOR, there's no spice nothing! We even orded jalepenos just to add some kick and those weren't spicey at all. My friends also ordered different burritos and they had the same complaints. There's nothing authentic about the sauce I do believe its from a can. We also had the guacamole which was also horrible tasted old ... I wouldn't go back or recommend it to anyone.. i was so disappointed especially with all the hype that I heard.

If you are in the mood for some heavy Mexican food then this is the place to eat. 燞owever, I would recommend you take it to go because the place is small and always crowded. 燭he restaurant is very popular. 營 had the cheese enchiladas with red sauce and rice and beans. Originally, I thought I had ordered chicken enchiladas, but read the menu carefully and it read choice of cheese, chicken, or beef. 營 order jack cheese with chicken. 燘ut the enchiladas came out with jack cheese only. 燤inor misunderstanding on my part. 燭he plate had extremely generous portions.

After watching Man v. Food, I though I found a good restaurant, that I otherwise would have never visited. The food really is not that good, it smells and tastes bad. I ordered the burrito. My friend ordered the fish tacos, which were deep fried frozen fillets, god knows how old. When we complained about them, they suggested the beef tacos, which were plain nasty. Mystery meat meets oily hard shell taco. The service sucked, rude waitresses. They made me feel bad for correcting their mistakes.

A word of advice, if you order the enchilada sauce on your burrito or anything for that matter check and see if you need to clean your face, chin, hands, even your forehead, everything before leaving... that shit will stain your skin an orange color and you will look like a fool walking out saying thank you with an orange mouth and chin.

Good but not great. Maybe I expected a little too much after reading such raving reviews, but I found El Tepeyac Cafe to be no more than satisfactory. 燭he first time I came here I tried the acclaimed "Hollenbeck" and was just short of disappointed. I thought I'd give the place another chance and returned a second time but came to the same conclusion: the portions are absolutely overwhelming and its mexican authenticity, questionable.

Not bad, but not the Holy Grail of Mexican food. Yes, the food is plentiful, but what good is that if it's not over-the-top delicious? Even though I lived in Mexico, I'm not such a stickler for authenticity that I'll take a good place out of the running just because it uses cheddar cheese. Tastiness is king.

El Tempeyac is big on size and small on taste. I just got back from El Tempeyac and it motivated me so much to sign up for yelp and write my first review. Like many of you I saw this on 'Man vs. Food' and from the reviews below my friend and I decided to make the trip since it was close to work. To it's credit, the place definitely has a local authentic feel. We went around 12pm on a weekday and it was packed but were able to find a seat immediately. The waitresses were nice but I thought it was funny how one of them used the soda fountain to wash her hands! El Tempeyac exemplifies what is wrong with Los Angeles Mexican cuisine like Tito's Tacos: It's all about a gimmick and not about taste. We ordered the Hollenbeck burrito which is a smaller-sized version of the 6 lb special. Sure it was huge, but it tasted bland. The asada was just chopped up steak and the ranchera sauce was just watered down. Do yourself a favor if you intend to visit the area for mexican food go to King Taco (or El Taurino) around the corner instead. The quality of the food is better but if you just want to take a picture of a big burrito and send it to friends on facebook, then El Tempeyac is the place to go. However, if you are fixated on getting incredible mexican food and are willing to travel, take a trip to San Diego and order a California Burrito from Lolita's Taco Shop.

So my bf and I finally tried this place too see what all the fuss is about and seriously with all honesty, I didn't see anything special about the place. Granted that the size of the burritos are overwhelming but that's about it! There's a line to get into the place (which I got all hyped up about because I was thinking, wow this place is going to be really awesome). The place is small and you literally have to bump elbows while you eat. The service is okay ( servers kept passing by in front of us and we were sitting at the counter too before someone finally took our order). Food was mediocre (I found a bone in my Okie de pollo burrito (gross). Overall, I've had way better food than this.

First of all, I came here with a friend and it was packed, but Manny offered us a free beer while we waited. That alone deserves 5 stars. We got a table within 5 minutes and ordered the Manuel Special. It came out about 3 minutes after we ordered and it was delicious. Too big to eat alone, but perfect for 2.

At first bite I fell in love with the "Burrito de Machaca." I've never in my life felt a burrito taste so good. It wasn't at all too complicated but it still had a very good kick to it. The salsa is fresh the way it should be. The small enviroment makes it feel more home-like. The workers are nice but wondered why they wouldn't talk to me in spanish. Fresh "aguas" and worth the extra dollar. This is a good place to bring a gf/bf when you only have $20 and starving. =].. Order the "Burrito de Machaca," its melted just right everytime.

This place is by far " The greatest mexican food in California!" I only wish there was a place like this in the inland empire. While visiting the restuarant i was honored to meet the owner manny. very friendly guy. What people dont realize is that this place has been around for year... It looks like it was built from someones home. People are so used to going to chain restuarants (like chipotle) where every thing is spick and span. Screw that. keep it original, dont change anything. If you dont like the restrooms, piss before or after you go to the restuarant.

Excellent Mexican restaurant in L.A. a bit tough to find on my first visit because they hide themselves to new comers. 燘ecause of Man v. Food. 燤y friend and I tried the Manuel Special with carne asada as the choice of meat. 燬o it came out to be a 5 pound burrito, covered in sauce and cheese (Hollenbeck). 燗 table next to us with 6 people ordered two manuel special like we did, and stared at us with awe.... I would say this it was the best burrito I've ever had up to today, they certain one up Pepe's in Alhambra. 燭he sauce was very flavorful but not salty or heavy at all, but the cheese on top, they can do without, I love cheese so that didn't bother me. 營nside the burrito was a perfect melody of carne Asada, beans, rice, a lot of guc, and cheese. 燗fter we successfully finished the Manuel Special, the store manger at the moment gave us t shirts, and even took one burrito off our bill, SO we paid for only one Manuel Special =D I will definitely be back to try the rest of the menu. -Out of Five- Revisit Value - 5 Taste- 4 Satisfaction-4

I decided to go here after reading the numerous positive reviews on Yelp and seeing the pictures of the monster sized burritos (can they even be called 燽urritos, more like burros). 營 went here with my friend Daniel after class to check it out. To start off with, I really liked the look of the restaurant as it gave off the feel of an older established place that has a long history. 燭he photos of Manuel and patrons that have visited was a really nice touch. 燗 very clean restaurant and the service was very friendly. 營 had expected there to be a line but surprisingly there was none and the inside was maybe about half full. Prices were pretty decent, a bit higher than I see at some of the other Mexican places I usually go to; but this is offset by the huge portions they give you. 營 especially liked the jumbo sized aguas frescas they offer--Daniel had a horchata while I opted for a jamaica. We ordered a Manuel's Special with chicken as the carne asada wasn't available. 燱hen it arrived, we hadn't really expected it to be as large as it was. 燗las, we were met with disappointment as the burrito was really rather bland. 燭he only part of it that had a strong flavor was the whole clove of garlic that I found mixed in to it. 燭he included salsa wasn't all that bad either, I got the mild and Daniel got the hot (his salsa tasted pretty bland too though). 燤aybe it was just an off day or something. In conclusion, our visit to El Tepeyac was okay--not something I'd write home about or some place I'll probably go out of my way to go to. 燭he burritos are nice if you're looking for something to fill the hole in your belly or have a large party (not too large as the seating is fairly limited) who aren't expecting anything fancy; but I've had burritos that tasted far better than what I got.

I love this place, and emotionally would give it five stars; it is and will always be a favorite. Manuel has no peer among restaurant 爋wners--he makes everyone feel like one of the family. The food is really good and actually kind of unique. The Hollenbeck burrito is king. The guacamole is some of the best. I have had better Mexican food, but rarely a better experience. I prefer slightly dryer Mexican food; El Tepeyac 爏tuff can be pretty wet. You will eat with a fork, I promise you; nothing will hold together in your hand. The taste is very good, The prices are justified by portions alone. The rellanos are ordinary; the beans are good. They are not terribly generous with cheese. But if you like Chile Verde and Chile Colorado and Guacamole and big portions of much better than average food, it is great. I like the food, and love the atmosphere because I have a lot of fond memories of the place, and you just feel good supporting a business like this. EVERYONE should eat here once. A five star could be justified, but I want to be really honest--VERY GOOD, not great.

I've been to Manuel's in City of Industry at least six or more time. Each time at different time of day and each time I've had horrible service. Last night was especially bad went in to order to go. No one wanted to help me. When I finally got someones help, he ignored me most of the time. Waited 45 minutes to find out he had put the order in for dine in.

I had to really ask myself if this was worth 5 stars AND IT IS! I'm not saying I'm a hard guy to please, but this generation of customer service has really been influenced by the all mighty dollar. Having said that 爐here was a point in time where people took personal pride in their work. From shining shoes to managning a department store, every American put their personal stamp on their work. Now it seems as if customer service has fallen to a cost efficent, who will do it the cheapest so we can charge more to make more way of life. But this is not that type of restaurant. Just go see the line out front. You really have to ask yourself "Can all these people be wrong?". Located in East LA its full of history. Just hope you catch Manuel when he is there. You can not only get a complimentary shot of tequilla for your wait in line, you can also get a whole bunch of cool stories about the place. 燭he food is awesome, and in true Mexican fashion they serve portions that could feed a light infantry platoon. Just get anything. Its all good. My personal favorite the Hollenbeck. Make sure to be hungry if you dont want to waste food. The portions could honestly feed two or three. The chili verde is a small slice of heaven. This place is like going back in time. A time when you not only got your money's worth but you felt good about the service you recieved. And only a 15 minute drive to Dodger stadium, it's always a place to get full on before a game so you don't fall victim to stadium prices. This place wont break your wallet but it might break your pride if your into eating competetions. Well worth the drive in your in the LA area.

El Tepeyac is my favorite Mexican restaurant in L.A. Now it is not the fanciest place or the most authentic food so don't go there looking for something like La Serenata de Garibaldi, Border Grill, Monte Alban or Guelaguetza because there are no white linens on the tables and there are no moles on the menu. It is simply amazingly tasty Mexican food in large (or sometimes huge) portions, covered with tons of cheese and sauce and guacamole, served up by a very friendly family. This is an old-school East L.A. locals place that is worth getting to know. I thought it was a little on the expensive side when I went there for the first time and ordered some taquitos from the window for around $5 and a burrito for over $8. I changed my mind when I got the order and realized the taquitos were covered in about half a pound of guacamole made from fresh avocados that would cost $6 to $8 in most other restaurants all by itself and the burrito was filled with meat and big enough to feed four people. There can be a line for both the restaurant and the take-out window whether at night or on the weekends but they usually seem to move fast and if you are by yourself, there is often an open seat at the counter. Bring your cash and your appetite because El Tepeyac is popular for good reason.

I started going to this place in the late 60's, and have gone there pretty regularly until a few years ago...it was always great, loads of tasty food at a decent price, definite 4 star material...the last two times the place looks the same as ever, but the food has gone waaaay downhill...my favorite was the freshly made machaca dinner, even for breakfast...these last times the food was not fresh, the machaca burnt on one side (I mean black and sticky, ugh!), and even after slathering the only medium tasting salsa on, it was bland and tasteless...its not just my taste buds are fading with age, my friends all found the food unacceptably boring and just not worth the trip to the barrio any more. Unfortunately Manuel (who is still tottering around) has let the place go foodwise....an example of universal entropy? Anyway, I have regretfully stricken this once outstanding restaurant from my favorite's list.

First time I ever ate at Manuel's was about 25 years ago when his son Pancho took me there. (I had never heard of El Tepeyac Cafe up to that point.) I had Huevos Rancheros and it stuck. 95 times out of 100, I'll order Huevos Rancheros. I also enjoy Kiko's Special. Quite frankly, I really like their enchiladas (with sour cream, gotta have sour cream) and their tacos. Ever since that fateful day many years ago, no other Mexican food will do, NO OTHER!

I took my wife to Manuel's Tepeyac the other day because she wanted to see the place after seeing it on t.v. 營t had been a long time since I last went. 營t's changed alot, the dining room, and now there is a parking lot that I don't remember ever seeing. 燗nyway we pulled in to the parking lot going into the wrong way. 燬orry Manuel I didn't know, but Manuel was outside walking towards his house, and made a point of letting me know I was driving the wrong way in and the wrong way out. 燬orry again, but you don't have to yell at us. 燬o we went in without in effect on our dinner. 燭he salsa was spicey but we had to pay for the chips????? 營 had a chicken quesadilla, it was big and ample. 燤y wife had the infamous Hollenbeck Burrito. 燨f course she could not finish so she took it home. 營 love leftovers, so the next day I started to eat her burrito and was startled with what I found. 燭here was a rock in the burrito, about twice the size of a pebble. 營 was appauled. 燱e have eaten at this place since my dad worked for RTD in the 70's. 燤anuel, just because we came in the wrong way doesn't mean to have to contiminate my food. 營 can not forsee myself ever coming back or even recommending this place. 燬orry again Manuel, but customer service is a priority in my dining experience.

Tepeyac was delicious! Usually big ass burritos are crap rapped in a huge tortilla but not in this case :D everything about it was good. I definatly going back to try the chile verde burrito. I tried both the asada and the machaca..asada was good, have had better but I'm not complaining :D the machaca burrito was delicious! And manuel was the most friendly owner I've ever met, and I've been to vicious dogs on lankershim.. If uve been there u know what I mean lol. Over all I give it 4 stars and I recommend it! :D its been DAN-O-PROVED!

I chose this place as my first review since I currently moved to the LA area and am in love with this place!!! First let's start out with the fact that I live 30 miles away and do not hesitate driving this distance with bumper to bumper traffic. First time I went I had the Carne Asada Okie....Oh my god!! Soooo good!! The burrito was very tasty which I was surprised since most places with a burrito this big end up tasting like crap. The guacamole was very tasty and the meat was just right. Can it be any cheaper? No way!! $9 for a burrito that makes a 燙hipotle burrito look like a rolled taco...Can't go wrong. With all this being said there is something that I love even more from there...Their Chilaquiles are amazing!! Haven't found better anywhere!!! Huge portion and two eggs on top and so crispy. Okay so all in all this place is worth every penny. I would even pay double the price for their food. It's that good!! Go NOW!!

In a friend of mine's quest to find "all things mexican" she decided to go find this spot in East LA that she saw on Man vs Food. 營 did not realize that we were meeting them @ a "hot spot".(literally it was about 100 degrees outside & a popular place) 燭hey waited in line 45 minutes to get in this place. 燨ur favorite part was the owner coming outside with "apple juice" w/ a slice of lemon & salt.(they do not sell alcohol so it was a treat) After we were seated we watched the waitress serving a monstrousity of a burrito to neighboring tables. 燜ive people could eat off that thing or one person will have leftovers for 3 days. 營 did not order that but my friend's hubby did with the intent of sharing w/ wifey. 燣et's just say the after picture still looked like a WHOLE burrito was there. 營 was more reserved and ordered the Hollenbeck, because Anthony Bourdain and I are kindred when it comes to ALL THINGS PORK! 營t was a spectaular burrito and the salsa verde on the table was a kicker! 燤y hubby ordered the t-bone steak. It was tender and full of flavour. When he asked for jalapenos the owner came back with a fresh tomato, onion & jalapeno pan fried and it was the best. 燱e also ordered the horchata which was refreshing and not overly sweet. Recommend it? 營 say venture out 爐o East LA and get your grub on......the owner's personality alone earns them high marks and we know why his business has lasted 54 years.

Wow! This has got to be the worst mexican food I've ever had...there was absolutely no flavor! Just some red gruel poured over my enchilada that came straight from Acapulco's or something. Maybe I was expecting too much because I was starving and my co-worker was raving about this place and how the dishes were huge and delicious. Well...they were huge! The size of the burritos my co-workers ordered was absolutely monstrous! It was the size of a small pillow...yikes! Now if it was filled with what Yuca's puts in their burritos, then I could just eat it for days but this one...it not only looked unappetizing but judging by the carne in their enchilada, I would have probably given it away. As well, the place isn't even cheap...go elsewhere for cheap and delicious mexican food...just because it's in the 'hood, doesn't make it good!

super low key location across from a church & right in the middle of a working class super latino (mostly mexican as this is boyle heights) neighborhood. the tiny SUV-shunning parking lot is always full but streets parking ample & not intimidating. lines are always annoying long (think The Pantry on a sun morning) even for takeout! theres probably 20 tables & its small inside so celebrity fit club will NOT be taping an episode in here any time.. yes the manuel special burrito is $17 & yes its huge & no its not enough for 4 people as the menu suggests.. me & my bf inhaled this thing in 15 minutes... yes, we're stuffed right now, & desperately wanna nap the afternoon away but we just scarfed down a pound of mahatma rice it seems like so i'll sit on my cozy computer chair for a half hour or so till the bloating-ness leaves me.. any whooo if youre a native angeleno then you've been here.. if you just arrived from ohio and barely moved into your fountain ave/western blvd studio well come down here cuz its not the viper room & weekday auditions that will authenticate your LA status.. its a meal at El Tepeyac....

The first time I had El Tepeyac was at work. 燱hen someone gets a promotion they would buy like 10 manny special burrito and feed like a 100 people. 燭heir tortilla chips are extra thick and crunchy. 營t's an experience going to this place, I always gotten my food to go and called my orders in. 燭he Okie or a hollenbeck burrito is what I usually order. 燭he okie is exactly like the hollenbeck but with a red enchilada like sauce. 營've been coming back to this place when I have a big party and need to feed an army. 燭he regular burrito can definitely feed two. 營f you are around the boyle heights and have time to kill, stop by El Tepeyac.

I too learned about El Tepeyac from Man vs Food and couldn't wait to try the place. 燗s everyone says, the burritos are huge. 燱e were disappointed to learn that huge burritos don't necessarily make for a good dining experience. 燩arking lot is very small, but we circled around a few times and found that spots open up easily - there was also parking right on the street. 燱e got there about 3:30 Saturday afternoon, hoping to be there after the lunch crowd and before the dinner crowd - no such luck. 燱e waited for an hour outside for a table inside, 燬ervice was good; prices are OK. 燗fter reading so many reviews, I tried the Chile Verde Hollenbeck, daughter tried the Chile Verde Okie, husband tried the Hollenbeck Machaca - shredded beef (sans eggs ?? and cheese). 營 love Chile Verde, but this was not what 營 expected - Chile Verde is usually tender pork chunks in green sauce 燞ere it was in a tomato based sauce, and the pork chunks were TOUGH �in both pork burritos). 燭he Okie was covered in thick (almost bitter) red sauce that tasted like it was from a can; it had very little meat - only a few chunks. The shredded beef burrito was very good (the waitress told us they had just made a fresh batch of machaca). 燦o kid's plates offered on the menu. 燝uacamole was good, but expensive. 燭he most fun we had at El Tepeyac was watching the items coming out of the kitchen - they definitely look a lot better than they tasted! 燭hey are opening a new location in City of Industry soon (much closer), and we might try it again ( just because so many people love the place), and hopefully based on what we learned at our first visit, we might enjoy it more.

There is a reason that there's always a line down the block! 燭his place is a Boyle Heights classic for its' huge burritos. 燤y favorite is the machaca with red sauce and cheese on top, but be sure to share! 燭he only downside is their guacamole, which varies in freshness.

this place is so damn good, on the way to la we detour just to come here for dinner. the manuel special is by far the best deal you can get. it can easily feed four people! this place IS tiny, and you will be lucky not to wait a few minutes for a table. the staff is wonderful and really nice, and when you're all done and ready to go, they come by and offer you some candy. if that aint good customer service i don't know what is. although it is situated in a dodgy neighborhood, most of the time you won't run into much trouble. i have seen people of all races waiting outside and never once seen anything dangerous. this is definitely a plus, since i have seen a lot of tourists flock here for dinner and boyle heights has always been talked about as dangerous. you don't gotta trip when you're at el tepeyac :)

I saw the man vs food episode and had this place at the top of my hit list. 營 make a special trip to come here and there's a line out the door (a really good sign). 營 finally get my burrito and it was so damn weak i couldn't believe it. 營 had a smile ear to ear when I got it, tasted it and felt like crying. 燙hicken was way overcooked, super chewy and had no flavor. 燝uacamole was garbage......flavorless green mush (needs salt at least), the beans were like brown/gray paste with absolutely no flavor or texture, rice was overcooked, crunchy and flavorless as well. 燨nly thing that made it somewhat edible was the sauce on top. 營 ate about 1/2 of it, picked it apart with my fork and threw the rest away. 燤y girl had a taco and an enchilada. 燭he enchilada sauce was pretty good but the meat was the same (overcooked and flavorless). 營f you like real, good mexican food, dont come here. 營f you like huge quantities of overcooked mush then by all means, have a go. 燛xtremely large quantities of food do not make the food taste any better. 燬mall amount of crappy food is the same as a large amount of crappy food. 燳ou just get more crap. 燛nding on somewhat of a high note, the Horchata is awesome!

my friend and i woke up hungry today. he told me this place has awesome breakfast and he's been going there with his parents for ages. i'm being very serious when i say that i trust this guy's folks. ok enough about me, i've got two words for you : BREAKFAST BURRITO. this thing comes out and i can't help but make a face like "this thing is going to kill me!" and it did but it was worth it. eggs, re-fried beans, bacon and potatoes - very simple but there's definitely something special going on here. obviously a knife & forker as the beans were spilling out the underside of it, as if to send the message "don't even bother trying to pick this thing up, brave one". they had excellent chips and salsa, which i'd call a must with what i got, but that's me. the service was quick and cheerful and the owner made his way around the place, saying hi and shaking hands. i'll be going back soon with my girlfriend, to try and tackle that 5 pounder i keep hearing about.

My wife and I ordered the Hollenbeck de Asada. 營t's pretty solid, nothing great though. 營 don't understand why so many Mexican places in LA don't season their meat. 營t makes the food taste more bland. 燭he burrito has the potential to be awesome with more seasoning. 營t's easily big enough for two people to get really full. 燭he guac, chips & salsa were good (not the red/hot salsa). 營f you're in the area, it's worth stopping by, but I don't think it's worth going way out of your way for it. 燭he owner is awesome! 營t's definitely worth going to at least once.

My friend told me that we were going here to eat a child to which I cringed because I am a children's social worker and that would be considered MAD abuse! What he meant was the child-SIZED burrito... I told him to stop saying that or I would have to report him to children's services. Anywho, this place has huge @$$ burritos. We ordered at the window and then it got cold so scurried inside. It was pretty packed, and people were enjoying their food very much. So this child sized burrito was $20 and could feed about five hungry people. I ate 1/6 of it and was full and could feel all the NaCl flowing through my veins like the way blood flowed down Luke Wilson's wrists 爄n The Royal Tenenbaums. Ugh, not sure why that image is in my head. Anyhow. The food is good. It's piled with cheese, guac, tomatoes, sour cream, rice, beans, and the meaty goodness. They were really busy, but it's busy for a reason. Next time I'd probably order something smaller though....something the size of a chick, not a child.

This place has the biggest burrito ever!!!! OMG!!! the burrito was bigger than my head! hahaha!!! when the bf and i first got to the restaurant (which was around 11 AM) there was already a line that was formed outside for people waiting to be seated inside the restaurant...some people didn't feel like waiting so they went to the the take out line which was on the side of the building...while waiting, Manuel (the owner) was greeting and conversing with his customers...he was even sweet enough to get a chair for an elderly lady so she wouldn't get tired of standing...once seating inside we decided to order the manuel special since we read other yelpers reviews on it and it was also shown on the tv show man vs food...once our food was brought to our table we couldn't believe how huge it was...other fellow eaters at the restaurant even took pictures of our burrito cause they have never seen anything like it before....supposedly the burrito could feed 2-4 people, but the bf and i only ate 1/8 of the thing...hahaha!!! we ended up having a huge take out box just for it....i would recommend people to come here and get the manuel special if they are with a huge group....maybe like 4-8 people...hehehe....the taste of the burrito is good as well....if u do go by urself and order the manuel special, just make sure u come very very VERY hungry...hehe =D

ever since the location off of paramount closed down , ive been pretty depressed... but little did i know that the original El Tepeyac was not too far away!!! my boyfriend and i came here on a saturday night around 5 pm thinking we would beat the dinner rush but as soon as we pulled up, there was a pretty insane line (noooooo!!!) It honestly felt like we were in those christmas movies where we were standing outside in the freezing cold while looking inside at the warm, happy people indulging into hot chocolate by the fireplace.. except that the hot chocolate is substituted with a mouthwatering burrito! we were starving but i told him that everything would be okay and it would be worth the wait! haha~ 燼fter about 30 minutes in line, the owner? said there was a booth available and we did not hesitate for one second to take the offer. We were seated and the server took our order right away. The only thing that I noticed was different from the other location is that this spot doesnt give you chips and salsa :( oh well~ but we ordered the hollenback burrito and chicken taquitos and it honestly felt like.. HEAVEN!!! oh man... it seriously felt as if we just ate at an all you can eat buffet and at the end there was still a massive amount of food left over. This would honestly be my favorite wet burrito spot for sure!! The only complaint I have about El Tepeyac, is that I didnt wear bigger pants! =P We are definitely going to come back soon and try to conquer the Manuel special *gasp*

I must review this dump once again... as I've said before. I've been coming to this place since I was a kid as many of you home grown east LA'ers have been proclaiming. So I gave it yet ANOTHER try last week just to please my bf (mind you, the last time we came he was dissapointed... I was so excited). He decided to give it another try to redeme itself. So we hit the spot on a Friday night, not as crowded as usual.. hmmm.. a sign that others have realized what I have?? So we have a seat and I decide to have the Kikos Special w/ enchilada sauce. The Kikos Special is 2 enchiladas w/ meat or cheese (I had cheese) rice and beans, what makes this special is they put a fried egg on top. Nothing new to me, we'd have enchilada left overs w/ eggs for breakfast as a kid. So I take a few bites of everything on my plate and am once again NOT IMPRESSED. NO FLAVOR, flavorLESS. The enchilada sauce was so bland, there was oil flowing all over my plate. Rice was dry as can be, beans tasted like mush. Do they need me to go back there and give them a hand??? Oh and to top it off, the complementary chip that came along standing in my beans tasted like it had been fried in dirty old oil. So I remained mum about how I felt about my meal in order to not spiol my guys small feast. He had a Hollenbeck of course. So when we got to the car I turn to him and said "so how was it?" he replies "I dont think I ever want to go back" oh lord jesus I screamed I was so happy!!! Over joyed and extatic that he had finally matured his taste buds to mine and realized that it has gone down the drain, all the way to the sewer. He was sad that something he had loved so very long (since childhood as well) was no longer on his top 3 resturant list anymore. What more can I say, I do not wish bad things on this establishment, I only wish good things for busniess' in East Los Angeles and for them thrive and become the best they can. Manuel's stoped striving to be the best years ago and is solely reliant on the hype and tourists word of mouth. Farewell Manuels...

I've been going here since I was a kid since I used to live down the street from this place. 燭he parking lot is small but there is always plenty of street parking unless church is going on across the street. 燭he line out front is their seating system if you want a table or you can sit at the bar if it's open. 燭hey only take cash, which is old school, but that has always been the case. 燗ny plate you get is always a pretty good helping of yumminess. 燗s other reviewers talked about, they have the Manuel's special that feeds at least 4-6 very hungry people. 燭hey do have a smaller version called the Hollenback burrito which is just the same. 燭he taquitos are bathed in guacamole. 燭heir machaca is delicious. 燗ctually, pretty much anything you get is pretty good and pretty easy on your wallet. 營 love it! 營 just miss those damn shots of tequila or whisky in my coffee courtesy of Manuel.

We had seen this place featured on "Man vs. Food" on the Travel Channel and were anxious to try it after a Dodgers game. 燭his is one of those places where there is always a line waiting to get in. 燨ur friends ordered their favorite, the renowned Hollenbeck burrito, to share (they chose the chile verde pork which is what I'll order next time!) 爌lus an order of taquitos (2) with guacamole. �They were only able to finish half of the burrito and took the rest home. My husband and I shared an order of guacamole and chips and we each chose a combo plate with chicken and beef enchiladas. 燭he portions were "ginormous," piping hot and very good, and the prices were really cheap. 燭he service here is friendly and efficient. 營t would have been nice to have a Corona or a margarita but they don't serve alcohol; however, their iced tea was very good. �As we often do when we find a place we really like, my husband and I each bought one of their colorful tee shirts. 燱e'll definitely return here on another trip to L.A.

probably the best place to eat a authentic mexican burrito, packed with lots of ingredients and the portion of the burrito is massive! mom and pop shops are the best you can eat!
