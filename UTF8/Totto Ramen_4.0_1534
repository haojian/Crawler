I didn't think I'd have time to make it out to Ippudo to try their famous ramen, so I decided to settle for something closer to the areas we were visiting. The boyfriend and I were attending a taping of the Daily Show, and we had about 2 hours to kill. Totto was a short walk away so we stopped by here for lunch. The restaurant is super cramped and tiny. There were a few people ahead of us on the list, but the wait seemed to be pretty short. Even though its so small inside, they're very efficient with their seating. They are also quick to take your order and deliver your food. I got the Spicy Totto Ramen with pork. It came out seemingly right away. The presentation is very aesthetically pleasing, and the taste... is even better. This is the best damn ramen I've had in my life. I didn't realize a bowl of noodles could taste so good. The broth was packed with flavor. The noodles were perfect. The pork was charred beautifully. I seriously feel like all other ramen is ruined for me now. It seemed to be a little pricey, but I don't think $11 for ramen is too bad considering I've paid more than that for mediocre ramen.

I'm thoroughly confused as to how anyone could compare this place to Ippudo. ?They don't even have the same types of broths. ?It's like comparing apples to oranges. ?You can't. ?The broth here is ALL chicken based, while (aside from the veg option) Ippudo's all has some pork component. If you want to try different varieties of what their different ramens, then don't do any of the spicy with the paitan. ?The paitan is the basic broth, and the spicy is just a spicy oil added to that. ? The 30min wait on a Thurs @ 7p was not so long considering the other reviews here. ?You sign in on the clipboard hanging from the door. ?One of the staff will call you. ?Sometimes, he will step outside to look for you, other times, he won't. ?So it's best to stand inside the enclosed area if there is room. ?Once you are seated, service is prompt. ?They forgot our eggs, and offered to give one free to us, but we declined. I read some of the reviews where they felt underwhelmed by this inexplicably popular joint. ?I share their sentiment. ?I've only started frequenting ramen places, and the majority of them are better than Totto.

At this moment, Totto ramen is the best ramen in the U.S., I think. but they used to be better! ?Actually the first time when I went to this place with my friend(she told me totto ramen is good) I was so happy and excited! Because, imagine! you can eat great ramen in the place where I live! it couldn't be better in my ramen life. First few times were very good overall, I tried few kind of ramen and found out Miso is the best(I do not recommend other kind), then I've keep ordering Miso ramen. However..., I don't remember exactly when, but Miso ramen taste getting worse(but still #1 in NYC), inverse proportionally, the line getting longer and longer. Everyone! just let me tell you something. Coolest style at ramen place is just order, eat asap because you should eat before the noodle absorb soup and gets dull! don't chatting so much, then pay and leave. ?This is the manner at ramen place just like you hold your fork in your left hand and knife in right hand:) I understand some ppl will think we are not in our country so do not force you to do our custom but I think this will make less/shorter line. 2hrs standing and waiting in NYC cold weather is not worth for $10 ramen....

I'm sorry Totto Ramen, but I'm taking away 1 star. Although I love your delicious creamy chicken Paitan broth, if your lines are SO long that I can never actually GET a bowl of soup, then its not worth 5 stars. Consider the following: - There is no takeaway/to-go - There are no reservations - The restaurant seats 20 people at one time - You expect people to be present, in line, for the duration of the wait! Something has got to give! ...Ideas: - take people's numbers and CALL THEM when its about 10-15min before their reservation. - take online reservations for dinner times or only on the weekends - offer take-away or delivery - open a second location, or a bigger location. How about the place on the corner of 9th and 56th?!

Hmm.. I'm not a fan, not a fan, just not a fan. I was there close to 12am on a Saturday night. The line was about 15 mins long. First off, the keep-customers-out-in-line is lame. If you can't take that many customers, just expand your place. I avoid going to all those places that make you wait. I personally think the soul of ramen is the soup. That said, I can't say Totto Ramen has good soup. The meat I had was half fat too. It could be a 4 star but I'm downgrading it by 1 star for it being overhyped.

If I gave Jin Ramen in Harlem, three stars, then I have to give Totto Ramen four. I feel like it's hard for me to rate this place because there are SO MANY delicious ramen joints in California. Just in my neighborhood in SoCal, there are at least three or four decent places and the waits are not typically long at all (if there even is a wait). But the standards since I've been in NYC seem to be different, so the rating is relative to the city. The first time I tried this place was on my birthday. I had been doing some reporting that went late into the night. Friend and I came here because I wanted noodles on my birthday (as per Chinese tradition). It was past 10 pm when we arrived and it was sprinkling wet and cold. The wait for two of us was over an hour. I ordered the miso ramen with pork and she ordered the chicken ramen with spicy sauce on the side. ? The broth here is chicken broth, not tonkatsu pork broth. I tend to like the richness of tonkatsu while eating ramen. But after trying Totto Ramen twice, it's nice to have the lighter (chicken) broth as well. I guess I have come to appreciate it after becoming so accustomed to tonkatsu. For both times, I didn't find the texture of the noodles to be too soft or hard. They were chewy in the right amounts. I enjoyed the (half) egg that came with my miso ramen--too bad it wasn't a full egg! My pork slices were surprisingly tough to break apart though, which really disappointed me. I was overall expecting more, especially with the long wait. But my friend (who doesn't eat much ramen) really really LOVED hers. It really made her happy, and afterward she was dying to go again. She also mentioned wanting to bring her family. The second time, I came with the same friend, also later at night at 9:30 pm. She had wanted to come so I figured this was my chance to give it another shot. The wait was about 30 minutes (so not bad at all for Totto wait-time averages). But then again, it was snowing and sprinkling outside...sleet. She ordered the same, and I ordered spicy Totto ramen this time, and with chicken. Because I was particularly hungry, I also ordered the avo-tuna for an appetizer, which came out almost immediately. The avo-tuna was delicious, particularly the seared tuna sashimi. Some portions were too drenched in soy sauce though (like the avocado), making it taste too salty. If they had just been a bit neater or easier on the sauce, the dish would have been perfect! I also enjoyed the minced garlic on the side. I would order the dish again if I'm craving some sashimi with my ramen. I was surprised that my spicy ramen was tastier than I remembered my miso ramen to be. I'm not sure if it was just because of the rayu hot sauce or because of a different broth, or maybe both. The slices of chicken were surprisingly tender, which I appreciated! They were better than the pork I had the first time. I think I had read some reviews to get the pork, but I actually felt like the chicken was better. I realized today (the day after the meal), that I didn't have an egg with my ramen. So I guess that's one-minus for ordering the spicy Totto ramen rather than the miso ramen. I enjoy this place, but again, I'm wary (and weary) of the long waits...particularly because I don't think this would happen in California. But I think I would come yet again if I were craving ramen because there aren't as many (good) ramen options in NY, particularly midtown and above (at least not that I know of right now). And the wait is still shorter than Ippudo, whose wait is an entirely different story...

I am now a ramen fan. I've been craving it hardcore ever since Ippudo but I couldn't do another 2 hour wait, so I decided to try Totto. Since being converted to a ramen fan, I've heard a lot about Totto - some love it, some not so much. I held off forming any judgements until I had it. When we first came to Totto, I didn't really understand how small it was until we got there. It's literally just the bar and a few tables. There's a sign up sheet instead of a host. My bf and I waited 5 mins before we were seated. (It was 3pm on a Monday) I ordered the Raiten ramen with extra pork, my bf got the spicy ramen. We also ordered two smiley buns. Verdict? The noodles and the broth were on point. When I asked for extra pork, they REALLY came through! The pork was good, but it wasn't great - it was a bit chewy and not as melt in your mouth as other places I've had. Ippudo is better but Totto is a shorter wait and a good contender.

Good tummy-warming ramen, but I don't know about the wait. I've had just about every ramen spot in San Diego, and I didn't come away thinking that this was memorably better than the best I've had. We got here around 2:30 and didn't eat until 3:30 or so, and were starving by this time. Got a pork bun hoping it'd be reminiscent of the one at Ippudo (which was the most memorable thing there), but while it was really flavorful, it was a bit too fatty for my taste. As far as the ramen goes - the soup was good but you'll definitely be reaching for water for the next few hours. The boiled egg (which you have to add) was fantastic - it's pre-marinated (reminds me of a tea egg) and is delicious! The char siu is very good as well, but as in the bun, really fatty. Twas a good meal, but wouldn't classify this under "must return next time in the city".

Bleh... Nothing this far beats any Daikokuya location in LA. This might be picky, but they did not allow to to taste the spicy ramen broth before I ordered it, they did let me have the chili on the side though. Also, I like my bean sprouts raw and the waiter came up with BS that all the bean sprouts have been cooked, even though I sat right in front of the guy blanching the RAW bean sprouts. I also prefer the curly/wavy noodle than a straight noodle. The broth was not that flavorful, and the pork was rubbery and hard to chew... I wonder if it was because they charred the pork with a torch...

Fun, crowded, too Japanese,,,,,not really a place to hang.....can be a bit intimidating because of the line and just the overall energy. That said this is really good ramen/food like all the restaurant's in this mini empire. They take the time and the care to make all their offerings the same every time. ?The great ingredients and the execution is always the same. ?This vigilance is what separates average ramen shops from the best ones..........

The wait was ridiculous. Crammed in this little protected area outside the restaurant for 1.5 hours. It wasn't even lunch time by the time we got in at 2pm on a Saturday afternoon. The food was awesome though. Although that fact that I was starving with anticipation may have made the food taste better. The spicy tuna don was delicious. The miso ramen was good, but the Totto extra spicy was really flavorful. I would get the latter next time... Even though the food was great, deserving of a 5 star, the overall experience dragged for the first hour and a half and brings it down a notch. The food was worth the wait this first time. But its going to be my only restaurant I have given 4 stars, that I will never go back to again, even if presented with the opportunity.

The best ramen I've ever had. Not only is the broth flavorful, but the noodles are amazing! I've been to several other ramen houses and the ramen there tastes store bought. However, the noodles at Totto are made in front of you, and they are the perfect consistency and flavor. There's usually a long wait, but it's worth it.

The ramen is amazing. Definitely deserving of its reputation. I had the Totto Spicy Ramen with pork and it was the perfect amount of spicy without making my nose run crazy. It's a shoebox of a place, which is why the wait is so long. My party of 3 waited for an hour and a half at dinnertime on a Tuesday. But once we sat and ordered, the food appeared very quickly.

Is this place delicious?... Yes. ? Is this place worth the wait?.... No. ? Here's my theory on how to avoid the line. ?I walk by here all the time and I've come to the conclusion that week days from about 4-5:20 is the the shortest line. Wednesday usually being the best. I've actually only seen 2 people waiting at five, on a Wednesday. ?5:30 is when it starts to get obnoxious again and you can forget about lunch. ? The Ramen itself is absolutely tasty. Their chicken broth tastes like it's sweetened with Mirin.(sugary rice wine sauce) It's important to continually stir it ,though, or you'll get an acrid mouthful of ?spice and all the sweetness will go to the bottom. The egg tastes like It's also marinated with the sweet rice wine and I think this is the best part. The yolk is mostly hard with a small touch of runny. But you have to order this as an extra. The pork Belly is braised with a flame torch. It's slightly charred and well done. Not the supple pork belly I'm used to, but tasty nonetheless.So, definitely try this place, but don't wait in line.

I feel almost guilty writing this review, but for how long we were waiting I was expecting MUCH better. Maybe its the tremendous hype on here or something, but I set my expectations high and was let down. We waited a long time too. I left this place with the feeling that I missed something because everyone raves about this place. I got the Paitan ramen and the avo tuna appetizer. Both were meh. I will credit the ramen though that the broth was nice and light, not oily and greasy. If this place had no wait or a little wait (half hour or so) id come back again, but no way 2 hours. But I dont think this 2 star review is gonna sway anything from all the 4s and 5s haha

We waited for Totto Ramen for about an hour and half. ?We killed some of the wait by going to the sushi place next door (pretty bad...but the tea kept me warm). ?Everyone was crammed into the little box outside the restaurant and it was really hard to get in and out. ?We were finally seated and the chefs were very friendly. ?One offered me a rubberband to use as a hair tie and the waitress was very nice. ?I got the spicy ramen with extra spice on the side and my boyfriend got the mega ramen. ?He had already been here before and said he liked it, but not nearly as much as Ippudo. ?I thought the rayu..the spicy stuff was great, and I really liked the garlic pieces inside, but I don't think chicken broth can ever beat pork broth. The chicken broth was a bit thick, just a tad gravy-ish and it tasted slightly grainy, which really put me off. ?I thought the flavor was good - the egg was very tasty and the noodles were cooked well, but I strongly prefer tonkotsu and a more liquidy soup. ?That topped off by all the people crammed inside, the ordeal of even trying to get in, and then feeling a bit rushed to get out because everyone else is just miserably standing in the cold, made me unlikely to come back, at least not on a weekend. ?I can see coming here for lunch and waiting maybe 20 minutes, but I think I'd still prefer some tonkotsu at the end of the day - chicken just doesn't cut it. Also, it's cash only, your name goes to the bottom of the list if you're not there when they call you (supposedly), and no take out containers. ?I bypassed the latter by going next door and getting a container. ?I understand they probably have no take-out containers because they don't want anyone getting their food to-go, but it's still wasteful to not let customers take leftovers home.

Protip: Don't plan on getting seated anytime soon if you are coming here with more than 2 people. I think that is the ideal amount and you can expect to wait over an hour if you have 3+. My boyfriend and I came here to eat during our last night in New York. It was really cold out and we had to wait outside and walk around a lot, so there were definitely many moments when we questioned how worth it this bowl of ramen would be...but oh man was it worth it! This is probably the best ramen I have had in my LIFE thus far. It is the first ramen place I've tried in NY - haven't gone to Ippudo or Momofuku yet but they will have to be tremendous in order to beat Totto. The ramen is so creamy and delicious and authentic. The portions are huge. ADD $1 FOR CORN because it is so worth it! I got the spicy ramen and it was not even that spicy, so I was very pleased. I hate when some places overpower the soup with the spicyness and then your tongue is so numb that you can't taste anything. Once you are seated, you are served pretty quickly and people can usually get in and out within 45min - 1 hour. Unless you are sitting at the bar, you will probably have to sit in a 4 seater table with another couple, so get cozy.

Japanese cuisine is by far my favorite type of cuisine, so I've had my share of ramen in the states I've lived in: New York and Hawaii (which is essentially New Japan). Totto ramen is among the best I've had. Had both the niku and paitan bowls, and I prefer the latter. (The niku became overwhelmingly heavy with sodium toward the end of the bowl -- I feared for my blood pressure at that point.) The ramen noodles are delightfully chewy, the broth perfectly seasoned, but what sets Totto apart for me is the pork: quickly blow torched to juicy, slightly crispy-on-the-outside perfection. The price is fair, in my opinion. Another plus is the intimate, hole-in-the-wall atmosphere. I love sitting at the counter and watching the chefs, who so clearly enjoy their jobs that they sing while sifting through noodles and wear adorable "I Heart Ramen" tees, prepare my food. Unfortunately, the trade-off for this level of intimacy is a long waiting line. I recommend coming here around 5:30pm for dinner lest you burn through one to two hours for a bowl of Totto ramen. (And yes, you should be present for the entire wait because they are not very forgiving about seating you if you're not present when your name is called.) I also advise against parties with odd numbers of people -- priority will always go to parties of two (and consequently, multiples thereof). Two of my friends and I once made the mistake of coming here on a Friday at 7pm, only to have to wait an excruciating two and a half hours for our food. Let's just say we cycled through a range of emotional extremes. Another menu highlight: char siu mayo don with yuzu mayo if you're hankering for more blow-torched meaty goodness.

One of the best bowls of ramen I've had in my life. ?Who knew chicken broth ramen could be so damn good. ?The noodles were the perfect texture, the pork had amazing flavor and the egg was perfectly seasoned and soft boiled. ?But the star of the bowl is that broth. ?Gives the ramen a very clean and unique taste. ?Between here and ippudo, NY has their ramen game down. Only drawback is the wait. ? Came on a Saturday during primetime. It was packed but we decided to brave the cold and wait. ?One bit of advice is to make sure you are there when they call your name. ?After waiting about an hour and 45, I checked the list and there was a solid 15 names in front of us. At their rate of calling one party every 10 minutes, I figured we had a few minutes to step out of line to grab a snack. ?Came back with snack in hand and checked the list to find out we were already called. ?Explained the situation to the chick but she said we had to put our name back on the list. ?At the end. Not budging. ?I lost it. Food is one thing I don't play with. ?I flashed on her and made a scene. ?Luckily my friend was cooler about it. ?He played good cop and made up some story. ?We eventually got seated.

The noodle, pork belly, and broth were amazing. Really, really amazing. The noodles were at the perfect level chewy-ness, the pork was a prefect blend of fat and meat, and the broth just complimented everything. Totto Ramen was so amazing that it was worth the hour-long wait on Wednesday night, and I'm the type that goes the opposite direction when I see lines. Go check this place out, fellow Yelpers! PS. This review was started back in 2011... I've been raving to everyone I come across about them. Haven't been back since and really need to make time for it.

Great hole in the wall good cheap ramen! ?A wait for a party of three was about 45 minutes around 10:30pm. The restaurant is really small so expect to wait longer if you have larger parties ?(not recommended if you want to sit together) but parties of two or less got seated sooner than my party even when coming after us! ?Seating right at the bar feels like a treat since you get to see all the cooks in action. ?I got the paitan bowl while my other two friends got the spicy ramen bowls! Everyone loved their dish! ?I would come back just to get my ramen fix! Each ramen bowl was savory and broth very flavorful. Perhaps it was a combination of the cold weather that prompts such a wonderful delight in such simple and delicious dishes.

This place is amazing and always packed. Its got some great neighbors in hell's kitchen like lucky burger and danji. I would eat this very close to daily if it weren't for the wait; it's incredibly important to get some of this stuff either late night or right when they open. Pork belly buns are really what many go there for. It reminded me a little bit of fish fillet because the texture of the fatty pork belly somehow took on a cod-like consistency; it's paired with tartar sauce, and interesting choice since I normally think of a sweeter hoisin-like topping. I must say they are delicious and the bun puffs are just right. The combination of the thing can be a little messy if you're not careful. The chicken-stock based ramen is truly amazing. I drank every last drop. I had the spicy version with a little bit of the chili oil--it transformed the soup and I couldn't stop. Topped it with bamboo, more sprouts, extra char siu pork, and scallions; hardboiled egg is a must, poached egg if not. There are some other adventurous toppings available on request too; for example, corn with the miso style is pretty popular in Sapporo Japan I thought the noodles were the right texture and consistency--very appropriate for a certain style. They don't have Tonkotsu ramen which is my absolute favorite--imagine drinking a broth that has the flavor but not the oiliness of bone marrow... Anyways if you havent, you must.

It was a snowy New York afternoon and what better way to warm up than to have some hearty Ramen. I had high expectations for the place reading the reviews by people who share my love of Ramen. Unfortunately, Totto did not live up the hype. The line was pretty long to get in and there really isn't anywhere to wait that fits more than 10 people. They have many rules, you have to sign up a certain way, no parties larger than 4 people, and cash only. I tried to add some veggies to my Ramen, they said no. I wanted a to go container, they said no. So basically prepare yourself to eat here on their terms. There are large pots of broth boiling in the ever so small kitchen given a B rating by the health board. The one filled with raw meat just sitting there was particularly not appealing. Techno music plays and within seconds of sitting your soup is in your face. That's not a bad thing but the music combined with the service really makes you feel like you need to eat and get the hell out. The soup itself was thick-- I used to live on a farm and it smells like it did on slaughter day in the chicken coup. As you can imagine, that's not the image you want in your head while eating your lunch. You could say that means the meat is fresh but by the looks of the place, I highly doubt it. The noodles themselves were homemade but felt more like a spaghetti noddle than a Ramen noddle. The pieces of chicken they put in my soup where slices of white meat but tasted like unwashed chicken. It wasn't delicious but it was edible. All in all, I understand why people come here, the food is cheap and it's fast. But the flavor profiles weren't interesting in that thick chicken stock and there is much better Ramen to be had out there.

My party was hustled into a table where the previous guests were still paying, and the adjacent table was quarreling with the waiter about a tip. ? So far, it was a classless and tasteless experience; we weren't offered menus or drinks, yet received noodles within five minutes of sitting down, along with our check (we didn't ask for it). ?A little put-off I tipped 'only' 15%, and headed for the door with my party. ?We were BOXED-IN by waiters until I gave them a larger tip, and accused of cheating them in front of the entire 350 sq ft restaurant. ? We/I probably won't be back. ?Thanks Totto for making that an easy decision.

Getting over the use of chicken broth instead of the more common Hakata-style pork tonkotsu was about as difficult for me as getting in the door at this hole-in-the-wall. The soup was convincing though, replacing the earthiness of pork with a brighter sparkle characteristic of chicken stock, nicely amped up with a distinct sweetness. Rich, with the right amount of oil to coat each chopstickful of springy noodles and raw scallions. Doughy, sweet, meaty, salty, pungent -- get the quantities right and that mouthful is ambrosia. The pork, you ask? Man, the pork!! The mega ramen is deluged in a borderline insane quantity of pork cuts. The thick-cut char siu undoubtedly stood out for being blowtorched before serving, resulting in a beautifully seared surface, fat melting dreamily over the tender meat. Large chunks of shoulder and belly were very tasty as well, if slightly stringy -- but this added welcome texture to the near overdose of meaty succulence. Not yet perfection, but this isn't Japan. They go right up there with the best I've tried so far in New York (I'm working on it...!), and try very hard to please.

No. They give you two options for broth: vegetarian and chicken. You can add char-siu pork to your chicken broth, but that doesn't reconcile the whole no-pork-broth thing. Just...no. The actual noodles are good and the perfectly boiled egg help push Totto up on the star scale, but I don't think I'll be returning for their ramen. Plus, the place only fits like five and a half people at a time, so the wait is just ridiculous. I know everyone loOOoOoves this place, but their broth really doesn't do it for me. Their uni don, on the other hand, is a must-order at $6. I wish they had a separate line for that.

The ramen was great. The wait was terrible. I passed by alone and asked the guy at the door how long was the wait. There were about 10 people waiting. He said that it will be quick because I was just 1 person. OK. I waited about 30 min. Most people who came before me were gone. Anticipating that my turn was coming soon, I noticed that he called someone definitely came after me. I asked the guy if he called me. He said No. After the 2nd time someone who came after me was called, I told the guy I was here before them. He said that it has to be 2 people. The same thing happened at least for the next 3 pairs. At the point, I waited for 1 hour total and at least 5 pairs of people who came after me went in. When I finally was seated (after a single person left), I was furious. It must be visible because the manager in the counter who cheerfully greeted me asked me what was wrong. I told him what happened. He apologized and told me that the guy at the door was new and he was going to talk to him later. He offered me beer or sake. I declined since I don't drink. He gave me a small dish of appetizer and gave me a can of hot tea when I left. Yes it was a freezing cold night. The ramen was delicious. I think that the manager made sincere efforts to make me feel better. Otherwise, I would have given 1 star and was never going back. I would have been fine if the guy told me that he may not be able to seat me soon because I was alone or if it were just 1 or 2 pairs went in before me. I was alone and looking for a quick bite. I probably was in the store for less than 20 min. Some pairs could be still ordering. I would go back if I have a company (seems like a pair has the best chance to get in with least amount of wait) and if someone else is at the door.

Came here on a chilly, rainy day and it hit the spot. They serve amazing food out of the little bar sized ramen "kitchen" near the front. ?The atmosphere was cozy and warm. ?The guys making the ramen are so great at what they do, and friendly, despite churning out a crazy number of bowls of deliciousness. Even the veggie ramen bowl was packed full of flavor. ?Randomly good jams going on in the background. ?Great for a quick meal solo, or a slow meal with friends. Cash only!

Holly motherfuckin shit balls is it good.... You get a front row seat to experience one of the best and perhaps the best bowl of noodles in NYC... With a wait time that averages an hour you will dine an have others look upon envy as you eat one of the best flavor combinations on the east coast. I know what you're thinking that nothing beats ipudo but you're wrong. Just the perfect amount of flavors in their broth trumps ipudos salty bowls any day. It's a whole in the wall crammed and unappealing but that in essence is the sole of noodles.. What they put in front of you is heavenly in every spoon full . Get here early put your name down you won't be sorry

I used to come here since the wait was usually around 20 mins, but recently it's been almost an hour. ?I came here because Ippudo's wait time is unrealistic, but now even Totto has become so popular it is inveitable. ?This tiny & cozy hole in the wall place can probably seat up to 15 people max, probably attributing to the long waits. It actually looks exactly like real authentic Ramen shops in Japan that I've been to. I prefer Ippudo's char sui over Totto's. ?The broth is not as thick or flavorful as Ippudo's, so if you prefer lighter soup bases, Totto is the way to go. ?Overall I like Totto, but love Ippudo's intense flavor of their broth. Try their Avo Tuna if you're a avocado fan.

my first introduction to ramen .... and now i won't be able to go anywhere else (i heard they're as good as it gets....) i've heard my brother rave about this place, calling it "food from the heavens" and in his top three favorite places to eat in the city. needless to say, my expectations coming here were sky high. the wait was horrible. we wrote our name down at 6 and weren't seated until close to 8. this can be attributed to two main things - the place is popular, sure. but more importantly, this place is TINY. they have TWO 4-person tables, and everyone else is sitting at the "bar" (like ~10-ish ppl). i recommend not coming with more than another person because it will just take forever. anyway, once we FINALLY sat down, we ordered the teriyaki chicken sandwich appetizer (sorry, i can't remember the names). this was DElICIOUS! you bite into this savory and sweet and perfectly seasoned meatball. really great! and a perfect little bite before diving into the ramen. for the ramen, i had the extra spicy chicken. so before i even get there, the thing that stands out about this ramen place (okay i know - i started this review by acknowledging my COMPLETE lack of knowledge related to ramen... BUT i did have a rather lengthy conversation about this with people who really know their ramen) is that they use CHICKEN broth! they have these gigantic pots that are just slowly brewing this delicious soup. the ramen came with this "extra spicy" oil based sauce. not severely spicy, but definitely gives the ramen a kick. the BEST part of the meal, though was the EGG. WTF i have NEVER had an egg that tasted that good. they marinated it in something (soy sauce based?) and it was PERFECTLY cooked. my mind was BLOWN. DEFINITELY GET THE EGG!!!!!!!!!!!!! so yeah. best ramen i've ever had....and probably will ever have.

DELICIOUSNESS!! I finally got to try this place my friend had been recommending to me! I came here solo while I was waiting for a taping nearby. It's a good way to use the wait-time, and get delicious ramen. I honestly don't think anyone should come in a group greater than 2. 3 is pushing it. They don't take people more than 4 - they'll split you. The noodles...are ok. They're a little thin, so it didn't have the same kind of bite to it that the thicker noodles have. I think I have a preference for thicker noodles, but these weren't bad. ?I would probably bump it to a 5 if they had the thicker noodles. The broth is delicious. Like...delicious. I don't typically drink my soup (call me weird), but I did drink a fair amount of this broth. ?I LOVED watching them flame those pieces of pork though! Servers are also really fast and nice. I asked the guy if I should get chicken or pork, and he immediately said pork. Then asked if I was vegetarian. When I answered (aghast, mind you!) that I was NOT vegetarian, he cheerfully explains that some people ask for recommendations and are vegetarian. Umm...if you're vegetarian, please never ask about meat. Just wrong man. The service is quick. The space is small. The food is cheap. The wait is LONG. Seriously, don't come if you're already hungry. Or if its cold out. Or, if you hate waiting.

Totto has GREAT ramen. I've used the 'top 10 ramen spots in NYC' list to make my way here and it's on my personal top 3 list. The noodles are cooked just right - chewy and also plentiful. The serving size of their ramen is perfect. I ordered the miso ramen - I like pork but this time I had chicken- and thought it was delicious. 4 stars because there is always a wait - I went on a Thursday at 3pm (weird time) and still waited 30 minutes for a seat at the bar (for 1 person). But once you're seated, the staff is VERY friendly.

I've been to Totto Ramen maybe 3 times and it's the place that I point most of my friends to go if they are seeking authentic Japanese noodles. I've been to Ippudo once but they seem more overrated and overpriced, so I prefer Totto. It feels like I'm in Japan when I eat in there instead of corporate-America's bastardization of Japanese authenticity as interpreted by capitalism. But also because Totto has that more Japanese feel, it's pretty much the size of an actual Japanese restaurant - freaking tiny. Seriously, there's like room for 20 people in there, max, which explains the huge lines outside the restaurant most evenings. I hear that it gets crazy at lunch too, but I wouldn't know much about that. It's a bit hidden from view because it's actually located on a street with pretty much only apartments, so you wouldn't expect a restaurant there. There's a small doorway and you step down into a basement-like room where you have to sign a note pad with how many people in your party, and then wait about an hour to get seated. Usually there's a crowd of people outside, so you'll be able to see it from a block away. I'm from Torrance, CA, which is a mecca for Japanese ramen noodles. There's maybe around 20 different ramen bars in my city, so I think I have a pretty good idea of what constitutes good ramen (I've also been to Japan, if that helps). Totto has a style very similar to Eboshi Ramen (famous place in Torrance), in which the broth is made from pork, so thick and creamy white. Totto's soup base is AMAZING. You can taste the meat in the soup and the savory liquid is never too salty. The noodles themselves have that handmade/homemade feel to them and are chewy and flavorful. I've ordered the Paitan Ramen and the Niku Ramen the times I've been there and both are great! The Char Siu Pork on the ramen is juicy and delicious, but only if you get the pieces with the fat on them. The non-fat pieces are sometimes a bit dry and stringy, so I rip them apart and let the soup soak into the pieces, which helps a lot. Overall, the dish comes together with the soft ramen, the juicy pork, and the thick base. I definitely recommend this place, but because of the wait and the stringiness of some of the pork slices, I took off one star.

I've been here like 10 times now ?and I think it's finally time for a review. Start off with the wait. My wait times here have varied from 10 minutes to 2+ hours. It really depends on the weather and what time of day you go. Even on a typical working weekday when you go at 3PM it might have a long wait time, but generally that would be the best time to go. Moving on. The space is small but no one really cares because you are here for the RAMEN. I usually get the Totto Extra Spicy Ramen or the Mega Ramen if I am really hungry. I usually add in Kikurage Mushrooms, Spicy bamboo shoots, extreme rayu (only for the mega ramen as the Extra Spicy ramen comes with the extreme rayu), and boiled egg. The extra spicy ramen is always good. Love the slightly more cooked than al dente noodles that they use. The Mega ramen uses a different kind of noodle (they use the same for the miso ramen as well). I personally like the texture of the extra spicy ramen noodles better. Char siu pork buns are okay. They were hit or miss for me. Sometimes if you get a newly seared piece it tastes great, but if you get one that has been sitting out for awhile (which is usually the case) then...not so great. It comes in tartar sauce and a couple pieces of lettuce. One of my favorite appetizers is the Char siu mayo don. This thing is unbelievably yummy! My favorite part about this dish is actually the rice. Theres something in the rice that is super flavorful. Highly recommend you get it. So I used to think that this place beats out Ippudo and Zutto Hands down. I'd say it still slightly edges out Zutto, but I am beginning to like the ramen at Ippudo more now. But I think this is solely due to the fact that I always end up stuffing my face at Totto more than Ippudo which leaves me feeling bloated lethargic and uncomfortable at the end of my meal... All in all...love this place and definitely coming back.

After waiting for 2 hours and 10 minutes in freezing cold 7 degree weather, our party of 3 finally got seats at Totto Ramen's bar. I never met a noodle I didn't like, and the Vegetable Ramen I ordered was no exception... it was delicious, comforting and quite filling. I would highly recommend this place to anyone seeking a tasty Asian meal. With that said, carefully plan your arrival time because the long waits can be brutal. Normally, I would never dream of waiting anywhere close to 2 hours for any meal anywhere (call it my Midwestern sensibilities), but my companions (New Yorkers) really wanted to eat at Totto Ramen, so we hung in there. And remember, Totto Ramen doesn't take reservations, doesn't accept credit cards, doesn't do take-out or delivery and no doggy bags are allowed.

We got to Totto Ramen at 5:10 and still had to wait 20 minutes for a table. BUT the ramen was completely worth the wait. When we left there must have been 40 people crammed into their small waiting area. The spicy ramen was some of the best I've ever had. I'm a little sad that I will need to return to my suburban life where the ramen cannot compare. Anyways, arrive early and know you will need to wait. Bring cash. When you arrive there is a clipboard hanging on the door in the small ante room where you write your name and number in your party. The service isn't really friendly, but it is good. They are helpful and will assist you in making the best food selection.

As if they need another review, but I have to get my 2 cents in. ? Location: within walking distance to Times Square. Wait: ?arrived at 1:20pm. ?1 hr. wait. ?I was by myself and parties of 2 - 4 were seated before me even though they arrived later. Space: very limited seatings at the counter and a few tables. Broth: ?the spicy broth was not overwhelmingly spicy. ?it had a nice kick and was so flavorful. ?The best I've had so far. ?Haven't been to Ippudo yet. Noodles: ?just right in thickness and texture. Toppings: ?chashu pork was too thick and a bit chewy, not melt-in-your-mouth tender like I've had elsewhere. ?Half-boiled egg was perfectly cooked. ?The kikurage mushrooms added a nice crunch to the bowl. Value: ?CASH ONLY. ?Best $17 (with 2 additional toppings, tax and tip) spent on a meal in NYC or anywhere. ? Why not 5 stars? ?It was so close to perfect, but the chashu pork could have been better. Bon appetit!

Ramen doesn't get any better than this in NY. A small, mom and poppy spot in Hell's Kitchen, who knew the best ramen in the city would exist here!? Like many popular spots, it's wise to come earlier to forgo the wait during dinner time. ?We waited for thirty minutes before getting seated at the bar to realize that we had the best seats in the house. ?Not only were we entertained by the cook staff, we had a nice view of the ramen preparation process. ?Given that it was our first time (this was around Sandy period), I ordered the original pork totto ramen and my friend ordered the one with chicken. ?Loved the al dente ramen noodle, char siu pork and portion size (not too small, not too large). ?Our experience was also enhanced by the fact that the cook staff were so merry to be there cooking and serving us. ?Simply put, happy staff makes for happy dining experience.

I chose to make Totto my very first yelp review, because sit is truly as good as Japanese ramen can get. ?Before I start singing all their praises, I must warn you that this restaurant is very very small. ?They make you write your name down on a list right outside the door and the wait can get very long. ?I tend to get there about 45 minutes before it opens so I can get in with the first round of people. ?Either way, you better prepare yourself to wait AT LEAST an hour to get in here. ? I've tried many different ramens, and none of them compare to Totto. ?The broth is just so rich and creamy (even though it's just a homemade chicken stock) and the pork belly is just purely delicious. ?My usual order is the mayo-don and the extra spicy pork ramen. ?Just pure magic every time!

Fun experience, great for a tourist - but there's too many people. I was lucky enough to not even wait to get a seat, but by the end of my lunch, the stairs were packed and it felt like I was rushed out. Add in the frenzy music, which I am not opposed to, but it gave me pressure to eat fast. The ramen was good, but I wouldn't say it's fantastically better than other places I've been to. That being said, just being a good ramen shop is awesome, and they pull off being rad well too. I have no grudge, but I wouldn't wait in the lines. ---- and another thing! With the ramen lunch specials, they don't make the price of a bowl cheaper, they allow you the ability to get something additional for a decent price. So, because I thought this would be my only time eating here because the lines are always prohibitively long, I went mondo and ordered the accompanying rice lunch special too. It is so much food! I'm still stuffed 4 hours later. The rice was really good though, I would totally just get a bowl of that for $4.5.

been a while since I've written a review, hopefully this will help me redeem myself. as a Totto virgin, I must say...this took me back to Japan. ?all the yelp elites are spot on with their reviews however, my story goes like this... after drinks with my lovelies, I was heading home and walked past Totto around 11p on a Thurs night. ?there was still a line! but only 3 groups of ppl (1 single, 1 couple and group of 4)...this is a rare opportunity so I put my name down for 1 and got seated less than 10 mins. at the bar. ?everyone was super friendly and noticed the big smiles on their faces when the bowl of ramen came presented to them...at that time, I knew I was in for a treat. ?I told the host, it's my 1st time, pls recommend how my 1st experience should be. ?I was open-minded and just told him I like spicy and can handle it. ?He looked at me and didn't doubt it but said...I know what to do for you. he suggested the classic Totto Paitan Ramen and their signature spicy Rayu on the side. He said I want you to experience the true broth flavor without the noise then add Rayu on top as needed. ?He was spot on. ?The broth is rich and hearty, ramen al dente, char siu plump and juicy. ?the Rayu was unique...spicy sesame oil with bits of crunchy garlic. ?boy, it was spicy! ?loved it. service was friendly and he asked me for my feedback and took it with good grace. I said Ippudo and Totto are my tops and they are two different species. ?It wouldn't be fair to say which is better. ?he agreed but did say one advantage is that they are cheaper than Ippudo. ?he was right! ? next time I need to try the Avo Tuna...everyone was ordering it and it looked refreshing. note: cash only & would come back.

I been here at least 10 times. I have tried most of their ramen, but my favorite is the Totto Spicy Ramen. It is only mildly spicy. This is their only ramen that impresses me. Warning: If you sit by the front, it can be a splash zone (nothing serious). Advice: Arrive before 12PM on weekdays as the line gets long during lunch. If you want to stop by for dinner, you should get there before 5PM as there will be a long wait.

I give 4 or 5 stars for the ramen, but the service bring my rating down. -1- There is a long wait. That's a good sign for any restaurants and it should not be a big problem. However, they told me it's a 20-minute wait and we ended up waiting for 90 minutes. That's not accurate or honest. -2- The ramen is great and taste is heavy, so I needed water. My waiter never refill my water, so I only give 10% tip for my $30 bill. -3- When my friend and I walked out of the restaurant, the waiter ran out and told me I did not give enough tip... "You have to give me $6 for the tip".... Wow... first time in my time. I heard it happens in some so-so Chinese restaurants, but never imagine it at a Japanese restaurant. I did pay him up without saying much. I had great respect for Japanese people. Well, not anymore.

It's good. I'm not going to lie. But the wait is just ridiculous. I mean, listen, I'm all for great ramen and stuff. But I just really don't care much for waiting an hour or more for ramen. In any case, I got the one with all the different types of pork in it (the $15 one). Definitely couldn't finish it because they don't skimp out on the meat. But I knew my husband would be able to finish his and still be hungry, so I opted for this huge ramen. In any case, it was pretty good. No huge complaints, but i've definitely tasted better soup base (ippudo anyone?) than this one. But I have to admit that the different types of pork cuts were one of the best I've tasted. I liked that they didn't skimp out on the meat here. 5-6 huge chunks of pork and you've got yourself a pretty full customer almost forgetting she waited forever to eat in a really cramped table with two other people who were actually pretty nice at least. Almost. I'm all about the experience of it all, but at least I can have some of my own little space at some other unnamed ramen places. In any case, this is a pretty good ramen place. Go for the experience and then you will either love it, or if you're like me, know that at least you tried it and it wasn't too bad, but will probably for elsewhere later.

Totto is a really small Japanese noodle restaurant that has an incredibly long wait for a seat almost all the time. And no, you cannot make reservations. Why the heck would you want to go to a place like this? Well, it's really all about the ramen, and if you haven't heard about it, then I don't know where you've been. It's unbelievably good, and they have the ramen down to a science. There has always been the long debate about which restaurant serves the best ramen in the city. So far, Totto has my #1 vote on this. It's also actually voted as having the best ramen in NYC. Why is that? Well, I'm not going to spill too many of the details because that would only spoil the surprise. You're going to have to come to Totto one day, endure the long line, and discover for yourself what the ridiculous hype is about. Yes, when I say long line, there is a long line. You might want to get a coffee because it's going to be a long, intolerable wait unless you come here during lunch early in the week. I'm not a big fan of long times, and this is probably one of the worst lines I've endured (outside) for food. If I could do it though, you can most certainly do it. The first time I was here with my husband, it was a cold below 30 degrees outside in the middle of December, and I'm waiting in line for a stinking bowl of ramen. There are at least 25 people ahead of me. The wait system; you scribble your name down on a clipboard, and the waiter comes out every 15-20 minutes to call out the next guest in line. Luckily they have an enclosed area by the entrance so you're not standing entirely outside. You unfortunately may have to suffer watching the customers already inside slurping down their ramen. Finally, 2 hours later, toes almost frozen and fingers numb, my name was called. When you enter, you're greeted by a friendly Japanese waiter and the aromas of ramen. It helps that they have Japanese waiters/cooks here because that shows the authenticity. The menu is not large and is strictly focused on ramen selections, but there is a minimal selection of small side dishes that you can order. One thing to note though is that you better bring cash because it's cash only here. Since I love spicy food, I had to get the Totto Spicy Ramen which is actually one of their most popular choices on the menu. This ramen has a spicy sesame oil added to their original Paitan ramen. The original Totto Chicken Paitan Ramen has homemade noodles cooked al dente style in a whole chicken and soy sauce based soup topped with ingredients like scallion and char siu pork. My husband and I also order a side of the char siu pork buns to start it off. If you score a seat at the bar/counter in front of the cooks, you can witness the ramen lab in action. I like to call it a lab because they really do cook the food like it's science. They have giant steaming pots of chicken broth and endless slabs of pork. They filter the heck out of that broth and stir the heck out of it with a giant wooden paddle. They grab a blowtorch and blowtorch the heck out of that already juicy looking pork. After we place our orders, we turn around and our ramen and pork buns are already in front of us. It looks amazing, like pictures depict. The first bite into the pork buns is like taking a bite into heaven. There are not too many foods out there where I can say this. The bun itself is super soft, and the pork is the perfect level of chewiness. My husband and I dig our chopsticks into our ramen and slurp up the broth. The one thing about Totto ramen that makes it assuredly amazing is the broth. 95% of what makes the ramen work so well is the chicken-based broth they use. It's quite creamy and flavorful, rich in whatever magical ingredients they are using. It's also surprisingly very clean. Their aren't globs of some oils or mysterious floating elements in this broth. They filtered the broth numerous, endless times so it comes to you in its most clean but rich form. There is also the char siu pork and scallions sitting in the broth that adds color, texture and added flavor. The noodles are in a perfect wavy form and made al dente. The broth is surprisingly not too spicy though. Even for people who may not like spicy food will find the broth to be rather mild. I actually think it might have a needed kick that the Paitan ramen doesn't have, but I have yet to try the original ramen to determine any difference. As much as I want to sit there and enjoy hours of ramen, the experience lasts for only 15-20 minutes. You'll be surprised by how fast you eat because it's so good. Was it worth the 2 hour wait though? Without a doubt. I came here with a lot of speculation and doubt, but once I took a sip of that broth and a bite into that noodle, I was a fan. Highly recommend you give Totto a try if you have not. Just make sure you come here with some cash, a not too empty stomach, and a lot of patience.

I really cannot stress how AMAZING this ramen was. Hands down, no comparison, single best ramen experience I have ever had. How good you ask? It was worth the 1.5 hour wait the first time and worth every minute of the 3 hour wait the second time we tried it! I have yet to find a place that can create ramen with the depth of flavor, balance of ingredients, and right level of spiciness - and still be vegetarian! The meat options looked pretty awesome, but the vegetarian ramen bowl (extra spicy) was incredible.

Totto Ramen serves perfect ramen, is cash only and a long wait. If you're looking for a full bar or a trendy ambiance, this isn't the place. Come here for the ramen! The wait here for dinner, is by far, the longest I've ever waited for a bowl of ramen. It was 1hr 20mins for 2ppl on a Friday night at 8pm in mid 20's degree weather. When we finally got inside, you will see that the place is a little bigger than it looks on the outside, because you can't really see the tables from the stairs. My guest and I were seated at the bar, right by the big pots of ramen broth and directly in front of the char siu pork where you can see the chef blow torching it to sear. Ordered a Char Siu bun for $3 each and the Totto Spicy Ramen at $10.75 which you choose either Chicken or Pork as the meat part (I chose Pork). The pork bun itself was so fluffy and not rubbery. The char siu pork was meaty with just the right amount off fat to balance it out. It's complimented by tartar sauce and topped off with lettuce (see photo). When the ramen was served, I stared longingly into the bowl, got my spoon and chopsticks ready, appreciating the art that went into making this bowl of piping hot ramen. It's like a tiny universe, first the chicken broth is the ocean, then the noodles follow, char siu pork x2, sliced scallions, fried garlic (so crunchy), bean sprouts, home-made raiyu (spicy oil with just the right amount of kick!), and a piece of nori (seaweed). The noodles are cooked al dente here, you don't have to tell them how firm you want it, they just know. The chicken broth is rich and creamy, no MSG, and the perfect balance and amount of flavor (have tried some ramen where it's way too rich and salty). They won't mess it up like other places do. You waited in line for over an hour here and for them for throw it all away like that won't make this place successful. I'm coming back, I need to have that moment where I get an extra order of noodles and finish off all the broth!

I'm so glad we ate a snack before coming here, or else we'd be some grumpy folks! Came here on a Sunday around noon and the estimated wait was 45 minutes. Since we had a snack beforehand, it was tolerable. There were a bunch of people waiting outside and about 10 people waiting inside their little canopy thing. When you write your name down on the waiting list, make sure you're filling it in correctly because they're two columns. If you put your name on the next page without filling in the columns on the current page, you'll be waiting a LONG time. The wait turned out to be a little over an hour. We ended up sitting on the bench right outside the door the last 30 minutes so it wasn't so bad. WELL WORTH IT and if you were wondering, it's better then Ippudo. - Not thick not thin noodles - just perfectly sized. It tastes hand made and stretched. - Broth was excellent. I got the spicy miso, it was so flavorful. The kind of crack soup you want to drink over and over again. - They put alot of sprouts in it (you can ask for without if you dont like them)

Totto Ramen, Totto Ramen! This place is GOOD. I got the Totto Miso Ramen for $10.75. The broth is smooth and creamy. The noodles are chewy and perfect to the bite. The miso is not premixed in the broth. It comes as a dollop like one of the topping and you mix it in the bowl yourself...interesting concept. I went to Totto Ramen with three friends and we waited over 1.5 hour. We all finished our ramen in less than 15 minutes. I suggest you go with a party of 2 or smaller in order to be seated faster as this place is tiny tiny. Was it worth the wait? YES Will I go back in a heart beat? NO (I'm from out of town and waiting for over an hour isn't ideal for a short weekend trip) Thank you for the delish bowl of ramen, Totto!

My friends have been telling me about Totto for years, so I finally decided to make the trek and deal with the wait. It was snowing and people were STILL waiting outside. I had the extra spicy totto ramen, which I was kinda worried about, but they gave me the spicy on the side so I could decide how much I actually wanted. Their spicy sauce was delicious. It was more black peppery than red peppery spicy and smooth and amazing and that was before I even got the ramen. All of the components of the ramen are done very well and with thought. They smoke their pork belly until it is slightly brown. Their broth is carefully made- not so salty, which is common to many other ramen joints. The texture of the noodles was perfect. Don't even get me started on the egg. You MUST get the egg as an add-in. IT IS SO GOOD. The biggest downfall of this place is obviously the wait, but you can put your name down and come back in an hour and you should be good to go. The place is tiny, as many people have mentioned, but it's definitely a place worth trying out. I wish I hadn't waited so long! *TIP: cash only.

What 2 hour wait? ?Come in the middle of the afternoon and you'll be seated right away like we were. Ordered the Chicken Paitan Ramen. ?Broth was light and chicken-based. ?If you're a fan of chicken noodle soup, you'll love it. ? Char siu pork seemed slightly thicker than normal and a bit more firm. ?Added the char siu chicken as a topping, but it was thinner and tasted very ordinary. ?Noodles were great - al dente as described and that's how I prefer it. ? Overall impressions - tiny place, inexpensive and tasty ramen, house music playing in the background and cash only. ?Service was quick, but I also felt rushed. ?The other minor annoyance was an employee kept opening the back door and letting the cold air in (it was about 20+ degrees that day).

Things were slow at work today, so I decided, at 12:30, to make a solo trip to the famous (or at least Yelp-famous) Totto Ramen. ?I grabbed my coat, draped my scarf around my neck to achieve the deliberately-arranged haphazard look that I'm assuming is cool but may not be cool, popped my headphones in and started the 4.5 block trek. Gentle reader, you may think that there might be no line for ramen at 12:30 pm on a Friday, as I did. ?YOU WOULD BE WRONG. ?AS I WAS. ?When I arrived, there were about fifteen people hanging out beneath the stair-covering canopy outside the restaurant, teeth-chattering from the cold (it was like 50 degrees also I made up the teeth chattering). ?The protocol is that you write your name on a list, hanging on the front door, from which the hostess will call names. ?I signed my name and waited, standing among strangers huddled underneath the canopy, trying to avoid the rain. ?Would be nice if they served drinks or something to people waiting, like a certain other well-respected NYC ramen place whose name I won't mention but it rhymes with "I'm-a flip you, dough," but no such luck. ?Which is probably for the best since, you know, it's the middle of a work day. An hour later (sorry, boss), after the hostess crossed out the names of a half-score malcontents unwilling to wait for ostensibly illustrious noodles, I was finally granted admission and told to sit at the bar. ?The place is tiny - sits 15-20 people - and actually reminded me very much of a couple of places I visited in Tokyo a few years back (well-traveled AND SINGLE, LADIES). ?Also, they were playing house music, which is cool if you're into voguing at the bar while waiting for your food like I am. Immediately upon sitting, I was asked if I was ready to order. ?I wasn't, since I was too busy taking mental notes of the place for a Yelp review, but I've panic ordered before. ?I can do this, right? ?I CAN DO THIS! "Uh....uh....uh....TOTTO MISO RAMEN, PLEASE" "OK." She remained there, perhaps expecting something more? ?I thought I was finished? ?Was I not finished? ?Crap, don't blow this. ?DON'T EMBARRASS YOURSELF. ?DON'T LET HER KNOW IT'S YOUR FIRST TIME HERE. (Editor's note: what?) ?(Authors note: huh?) "And, uh...the char siu mayo don?" She left, apparently satisfied that I had ordered properly/enough. ?Phew. ?Wait. ?Crap. ?WTF did I just order? ?Pork, ok, rice, ok...and yuzu mayo? ?Huh. ?Well, Schnippudo rocks mayo on their pork buns, so maybe this will be solid! It was ok. ?Sort of solid, like Jell-o, maybe, which is solid but you can crush it in your hands and let it shoot out through your fingers. ?I don't know. ?The mayo was a little too tangy, for me, which I guess is to be expected from yuzu but I wasn't feeling it. ?The pork was cooked perfectly, but tasted sort of like charred nothing. ?Bummer, since I had more pork coming. The ramen came out while I was still scarfing down my porky rice bowl and I switched my attention to it immediately. ?The miso ramen comes with an impressive ice cream scoop of Miso, which I honestly didn't know how to address. ?Maybe an instruction booklet for westerners like me who are unaccustomed to being given huge globs of miso paste on top of noodle soups would have gone a long way. ?I just mixed it in with everything (is that wrong? PM ME AND LETS ARGUE ABOUT IT) and went to town. I was, how do you say....completely and totally underwhelmed by the bowl of food with which I had been presented. ?The noodles were a bit too al dente and the (chicken) broth was pretty bland. ?I lowered my right ear to just above broth level, to see if the noodles were laughing at me for having waited an hour for fancy cup noodles. ?They weren't, which was polite of them, but the graciousness of this act of withholding noodly laughter did nothing to ameliorate this lunchtime disappointment. Would I go back? ?Yes. ?Would I wait an hour? ?F to the no. ?Would you wait an hour? ?Maybe, in which case let me know and I'll meet you an hour into waiting and cruise right in there. ?For my time, though, I'd rather be waiting at Ippudo.

Totto Ramen rocks and yes, the long wait is worth it. I usually put down my name on the list and mosey on over to Kyotofu to grab some gluten free Japanese baked goods. My usual is the vegetable ramen: Konbu seaweed and shiitake mushroom based soup, topped with seasoned avocado, seasonal vegetables, spicy Yuzu paste, sesame oil, salted kelp and lime. Nothing quite satisfies the soul on a cold night. And I love the Japanese chefs, super sweet especially the one I always catch crooning along to reggae. Cutie. A few months ago they changed their noodle maker who couldn't quite replicate the taste of the noodles, I hope they've since rectified the issue!

I vacationed in New York for a week and during that time period my boyfriend and I consumed A LOT of food. This was, without a doubt, my favorite meal. I've been home now for almost two weeks and I still think about that damn ramen! We arrived shortly after opening (12p) and put our name on the list. We waited around 45 min to enter, but from what I've read this is pretty common. The restaurant is tiny and consists of one long counter and a few tables off to the side, so expect to wait no less than 30 min -- and that's a conservative estimate. But let's get to the food. That spicy ramen is so much better than I could have imagined it. Just the thought of those chewy noodles, the tender char siu pork, and the spicy sesame chili oil makes my mouth water. Don't be afraid to liven up your bowl with additional fixins (I got the kikurage mushrooms, soft boiled egg, and bamboo shoots). My meal came out to just under $14, which imo is not cheap for noodle soup by any means, but in this case I would highly recommend splurging for the extras. My boyfriend liked his miso ramen but said it lacked any spiciness and wish he'd gotten mine instead. Plus, if you sit at the counter you'll be close enough to see the action up close. And I mean SUPER close; I could have reached out and poked the chef on the back. Maybe it's just me, but I really enjoyed seeing the giant vats of broth bubbling away, the thick steam wafting just inches from my face. If/when I return to NYC, this will be one of the first stops on my trip.

My first time in New York and I think this was the best food we had there. We waited about 30 minutes but they had a cover for the waiting area at least. And they had a heater outside but it was cramped with 15 other people waiting. I didn't think the wait was that bad since I read the reviews saying the wait was terrible. I anticipated it already. We got seated at the bar and it was a little uncomfortable because it was in front of the big pots of broth and super steamy. But it was okay since the staff was friendly and will chat it up with you. I had the miso ramen. The broth was good. The noodles were decent. The meat was awesome. My boyfriend and friend got some super spicy ramen and they absolutely loved it. My boyfriend thinks its the best ramen he's ever had. If I ever find myself in NY again, I'd come back!

I wrote a review about a ramen restaurant in NJ that I thought was really good. However, upon eating at Totto Ramen, I've come to realize that the ramen I've been eating in NJ is actually FULL of msg. That is the only reason why it tasted so good. Totto Ramen is a restaurant run by Japanese folk. Although the wait can be rather long and the inside atmosphere is rather cramped, if you get a bar seat (i guess it's called), the servers are actually really nice and smile to you, even though they might not understand english that well. This is the most authentic tasting ramen I've gotten, and I got the large Niku Ramen - very delicious. Just a heads up, although the items on the menu look really good, I think those pictures are taken from the restaurant in Japan, it never looks that good in real life.

This place has some of the best Ramen Soup in the city. it has become very trendy lately. We had to wait over an hour for a table. There is only 1 option for vegetarians, the Vegetarian ramen. Its delicious. My ramen came in a big bowl and was topped with spinach and lots of vegetables. I pushed it all into the hot broth which made the toppings tender. Waitstaff was incredibly polite, friendly, and accommodating. My friend ordered the pork ramen. She ordered an extra pork toppings and they were generous in he amount they gave her. She loved her dish as well. As amazing as the ramen is, its not worth the long wait. I'll try to hit this place up again during a weekday lunch hour.

The ramen is good, although not good enough to merit the more than one hour wait during dinner hours. ?Go right when they open, and not 20 minutes later. ?I used to live in the neighborhood and would walk by for lunch or dinner, and I'd always see the big crowd outside in the heat/cold waiting for a bowl of ramen. ?My stomach usually got the better of me and I would go to one of the many other fantastic restaurants in Hell's Kitchen. ?The roast pork is tasty, though pricey for how much you get. ? I really like the guys working behind the counter though. ?They are pretty cool to talk to if you sit at the bar.

5 star for the food. ?It's everything you want from eating Ramen and having eaten and almost every hole in the wall to gourmet recommendation I can find, I can say with confidence that this bowl of tummy warming goodness is in the top three. I had to only give it a 4 star rating though due to the overall experience. ?A very small space that's poorly ventilated and overcrowded. ?We waited over an hour after writing our name on the list in pencil. ?There's no warning system or speaker to announce who's up, so you're standing around with 30+ other people trying to understand the guy at the front with a lisp/accent so thick you're really unsure of what he's saying. Given their popularity, how hard would it be to invest in a simple deli number system where you pull a ticket and then your number shows up on a board? ?It's so unrealistic to expect diners to stand around for over an hour in the cold without so much as a to-go bar for us to grab a drink. ?If you're not standing at attention when they call your name, you're back to the bottom of the list, so no chance of keeping warm next door and grabbing a roll or two at the sushi place. The bathroom isn't something you want to experience as it's a closet off the kitchen and an afterthought. ?The busboys keep extra broth above your head at the table on shelves and will be pulling down stainless tubs overtop of your date as the meal goes on. Service is quick, food is awesome, experience is like a 3rd world country. ?Go with a roadie or two and prepare to wait. ?I'm sure you'll agree the food is worth it, and maybe that little bit of a challenge actually makes that goal of the first spoonful of broth that much more special.

What can I say that hasn't already been spoken by other true Yelpers? ? We waited 45 minutes on a dark, rainy Tuesday evening. ?Huh? ?This must be good... The "Host" was cute, let us to our table in great spirits. ?How could we not get pumped up about this?? Luckily the menu is small because I was ravenous and could not deal with indecision at that point. ?Ordered pickled cucumbers as an app (recommended - fresh & zesty) and spicy veggie ramen. ?Surprisingly, this was excellent. ?Broth was definitely comparable to the miso broth, except not as creamy. ?Great flavor & spices. ?There were a ton of veggies in there that were extremely fresh and unique. ? I did make one sad realization. ?Avocado does NOT belong in ramen. ?This is a first. ?I eat avocados in every way, shape, and form on a daily (or near daily) basis, and this is the first time that I haven't liked an avocado in some sort of food concoction. ?It hurts me, but skip 'em.

Is it worth the wait? My friend and I waited for about an hour, which I guess isn't that much of a wait if you compare it other reviews here. But it was rather chilly out and I swear my toes were going to fall off before I would even make it through the door. We were both also hungry (and tired) and you know what they say about what you eat when you're starved. Everything seems to be edible and delicious by then. Still the ramen here didn't disappoint me. I wouldn't say I was floored either. I ordered miso ramen with chicken as opposed to pork. The thick broth did its job and provided a lot of flavor to accompany the noodles, and drinking spoonfuls of it seemed to do wonders for my already cold and shivering body. Would I ever want to visit again? I kind of want to, just to see if I still think the same way but not after starving for hours.

Pretty awesome ramen house :) the waiting time really sucked... you need to put your name on their list and hour or so ahead of the time you would like to eat. Their lunch time starts at 12pm and they only let you start putting your names down 11:15. i thought that 11:15 was a bit too early so I signed up later at around 11:40. There were already 10-15 slots ahead of me. I thought... no biggie. Wrong. I ended up still waiting for about an hour with another friend. i wasn't such a fan of their noodles since they were a bit hard for me... but the broth and toppings were EXCELLENT. the Char Siu Pork was so thick, tender, juicy and flavorful! the seasoned egg was cooked so perfectly by having its yolk on the runny side which is just the way i like it! I ordered the totto spicy ramen that comes with either pork/chicken. I chose pork which was damn delicious :) There were also some bean sprouts and scallion which i wasn't a big fan of, but honestly, it all blended in with the ramen lol. The interior design is alright. All in all, this place was very very small... literally a basement of some apartment. there were about 10-15 seats lined up in front of the ?chef which is usually where a 1 person sits, but i ended up sitting there with my friend. You can see the giants pots of broth cooking right in front of you lol. There were only about 2 -3 tables that can seat a part y of 3 or 4. So the space over here is VERY limited.. The spice level was pretty strong. At first you don't feel it so much, but it really catches up in the end. As i was eating it, i felt that my stomach was getting upset since i was eating it too quickly and it was so spicy, but i just couldn't help it because it was SO GOOD. I would definitely come here again and be on line by 11:15am to avoid huge lines and waiting time :) I want that cha siu pork again really badly as well as the egg :) must get those toppings!! :D

3.5 stars. First of all, this place plays some great hip-hop music that gives you good vibes. Secondly, their Ramen is tasty and good, but I honestly can't say it was better than their more popular competitor. However, I do like Totto Ramen because although there is a bit of a wait, it is not as ridiculous as the other well known competitors location's wait and the ramen is still delicious at half the price. I ordered the Totto Extra spicy ramen at $10.75 plus a seasoned boiled egg for an extra $1 and was very happy and content with my stomach and the price. However, the ramen wasn't as spicy as I was expecting. (In comparison, at the other infamous ramen spot in NYC, your bowl costs $17 + $2 for an egg which brings your bill up to $20+ with tax and tip etc.). All in all, a good spot that I would visit again if I'm in the area, because the food is good, and the price is right, BUT I have had ramen with broth that is a bit more flavorful

4 stars might be generous, but 3 felt stingy. ?Totto is mostly overlooked, but it's solid. ?It's another rich tonkotsu broth in a nice basement hole in the wall, which is a non-food attribute for restaurants I enjoy. ?I generally feel like "non-sexy" establishments with good food produce better quality product because they *have* to try harder since they're not selling you ambiance. ?People who live near Totto seem to overrate this place, but I think its just because they like imagining that they live in the best neighborhood so they mentally adjust their ratings for proximity. Good location, not worth traveling for. ?Drop in when you're in the neigborhood.

Can I give minus stars? I'm a foodie. I don't mind waiting outside in the cold weather to get a decent bowl of ramen. I don't mind getting not so perfect service when I already know the place is famous and busy. So waiting in line for an hour in the freezing cold weather or B graded dirty places didn't matter at all. This review is entirely about the food! Seasoned avocado was too salty I had to spit it out. The vegetable ramen soup was meh itself. Vegetables didn't go along well with the soup. Spicy ramen was so oily I couldn't continue to finish. I also tried their uni don and cha shu don with mayo, which I felt like I'm so stupid spending money on those. And again, avo tuna also has that SALTY seasoned avocado in it. Plus, cheap taste of unfiltered sake that I usually find from Chinese sushi place. It took long time to calm down myself from my frustration and anger toward this place. I can't believe New Yorkers still go here when there're many good ramen places in the city.

This is the second best ramen place I've ever been to, the first being Daikokuya of LA. However, this is decidedly the best ramen place if you're up for a 3 hour wait in the frigid New York cold. Totto is tiny. T I N Y It seats no more than 23 at most, and even then, you're elbow to elbow with the next person. But the meat seared with a mini blowtorch? The delicious melty fat dripping off the meat? The delicious rich, hot broth that makes Totto amazing? It's worth it. The price? Chapped lips that didn't heal until I went home to the Bay Area, and being in the freezing cold, huddled against everyone else waiting eagerly for a spot at Totto. Price: 4 [Really nice for NY Ramen] On the expensive side for someone from Cali. About $12 Ambiance: 3 Ramen: 5 Unf.

Wanted to bring some friends here to try my favorite ramen in the good ol' USA, and I feel like I should write an update, because others might find this information useful: THEY DO NOT ACCEPT PARTIES GREATER THAN 4. With that being said, they were so nice to us to accommodate our party of 6 via breaking us up into 4 and 2 :) I know, I know. I want to bring everyone and their moms here, have my birthday party here, or buy ramen for every ramen skeptic, but only 4 at a time, please. And you will understand why when you get there: the biggest table here only seats 4 people. After about 30 minutes of waiting on a Friday night (the list was dauntingly long, but lots of people put their names down and give up, so the wait wasn't more than an hour), 4 of us got seated, and the other 2 got seated 10 minutes after. We were even lucky enough to have tables right next to eachother! :) Anyway, I just wanted to add that eating ramen here while swaying our shoulders to reggae music was the absolute highlight of my entire 6-week New York visit. Thank you, Totto. We even took a friend here for the first time who, for whatever reason, has pre-decided that he didn't like ramen, but Totto ramen changed his mind. Thank you, Totto :)

Prepare for wait for like... EVER! Unless you go there early enough before they even open the restaurant ;) This place is tiny, yet it's so famous that everybody want to try. After having my lunch there, I would say -- it's as good as ippudo! I ordered the first ramen on the menu, and the pork bun. OMG you have no idea how much i love their pork bun. The pork was very tender and juicy and the bun was moist. I don't even have to say how good the ramen was.. since everybody else already pointed it out. The only thing I want to add is: the side -- spicy bamboo shoot was very very very very spicy!!!!!! be careful with it... Overall, it's such a great place! I will definitely go back there again.

OMG you are so yummy! I got the spicy ramen with cha shiu pork and corn. The broth is spot on for a rainy New York day. Chicken based broth with the spicy sesame oil is a great balance. Not to mention the garlic bits in the spicy sesame oil. The best part a friend of ours offered to wait in line early so we didnt have to wait for a seat!

After walking by their long lines time after time, I finally decided to see what all the rage is about. After an hour of waiting in the cold, I was finally seated at the bar. Warning: Totto Ramen is very small. I ordered the Totto Chicken Paitan Ramen and added a seasoned hard boiled egg. After ordering, I was in for a treat because I got a front row seat to the ramen-making show. There are 3 ingredients that dictate my rating: the noodles, broth, and char siu (meat). 1. The noodles were perfectly cooked to al dente. 2. The broth is SO delicious - by far my favorite part of the dish. It's savory, almost velvety-smooth, and perfectly seasoned (most tend to experience death by salt). I wish I could have ordered a bowl of broth on its own! 3. The char siu pork seems to be pre-cooked - they were laid out on a wire rack. Right before the meat takes its turn on the assembly line, it's seared with a mini blowtorch. The pork is good though I thought it was a little on the tough side. The seasoned egg lived up to its name - I couldn't pinpoint what the egg is seasoned with but it was darn good. And the runny yolk... you can't go wrong there. The added shredded pork, nori, and other toppings complemented the dish well and heightened the overall flavor. I thought the portion was perfect. This is one of the best ramen I've had so far in NYC. After leaving quite satisfied, it was definitely worth the wait!

So have you ever come across a large group of people milling about and wondered what was going on? You may first try to dismiss it but curiosity, doubt, or regret begin to creep in on you. For instance, like that time you came across a donkey pi?ata with a broom stick next it and a crudely written sign that says " FREE BEER INSIDE!". What does one do?!? Well that's how I discovered Totto Ramen. I saw a large group of Asians amassing on the side walk and started to think what has all of these Asian millennials waiting in this long ass line? Maybe I TOO should be waiting in this line! After writing my name down on the clip board and 75 minutes later, I sat down and ordered something that was not on the regular menu at one point. That bowl of ramen was the mighty Niku Ramen and its awesomely pork centric and amazing. The pork belly meat and pork chop pieces pairs well with the scallions and noodles. Its more expensive than the other bowls but that's because you're getting more food. The ramen had a texture that was not as slippery as say the flat noodles found in soup bowls or Thai Rad Nar but seemed to resemble a freshly made pasta noodle that was only dipped in boiling water for 5 seconds. I also suggest adding an egg to make it that much more protein rich. When I ordered the Niku, I received a head nod that conveyed, "Ah, yes the Niku Ramen, you know what's up". After I was done, there was still a good deal of broth left. So I naturally did the next logical thing, and that was to order another side of ramen to emerge in that broth. I'm telling you, everyone should consider ordering that extra side of ramen. Think about it, you just waited an hour for this. You should probably savor it some more. Unless you get there early to sign up, be prepared to wait. Also, there was no free beer in that pi?ata. Just lots and lots of partially open ketchup and mustard packets. Gotta love frat guy humor.

Came here twice during my stay in NYC. The first time I waited about an hour while being rained on in 25F weather. ?This was at 11pm on a Wednesday night in January. The second time I came I waited 45M. At least it wasn't raining this time. Bottom line, the waiting here sucks, and the waiting area sucks as well. ?There is nowhere to sit while you wait unless you are one of the two lucky people who can fit on the bench outside the entrance. ?Everyone else gets to stand on the steps the whole time. After I sat down the first visit they took away the board for people to put their names down and yet the four people who actually got to the place after it had technically closed were all seated and fed. ?So you might want to try coming right before or after it closes and see if they will seat you. This place is very small and very cheap. ?Where else can you get a huge bowl of ramen with chicken or beef for dinner for $11 dollars in NYC? ?There are only about seating for 20 people, which explains the wait times. The food is very good. ?I ordered totto spicy ramen. ?When you first get your bowl the sesame oil is put in the middle of the bowl so you can taste the chicken broth without the spiciness. It is very flavorful. With the sesame oil it just gets better. ?Though I will say that the type of heat the oil brings is at first a pepper like heat that hits you at the back end of your throat. ?I would prefer a more even heat but oh well. The chicken or beef that comes with your food might as well not exist. ?Does anyone really come to a ramen shop for the meat? The noodles are good and soak up some of the broth flavor. ?They don't absorb the broth the way store bought ramen does (I don't know why) which really makes the broth the clear star of the meal. Overall, some very good ramen. I would recommend eating a snack before you come here to make the wait easier.

I could definitely say that this probably is the best Ramen that I have had in my life. I cannot profess that I am a ramen expert, but I have eaten it at the supposed greats in San Francisco and San Diego, and this I think beats them all. I don't know what they do, but the broth of the Totto Spicy Ramen has some special stuff in it that gives it a lot of dynamic. Can't put my finger on it, but one of them is that they use a different type of pepper in the broth. But OMG this stuff was amazing. And the actually carmelize the Chashu. They say over an hour wait is totally worth it and should be expected for this place. Was skeptical at first, but now I understand. Heck, I could easily wait 2 hours in the cold for this place. Make sure you add a boiled seasoned egg to your ramen, because they are cooked perfectly. Wait is long, but the service is super fast. The time of ordering your food to getting it I would probably say is 3 min.

Expect a long wait. At least 1 to 2 hours! The service is pretty quick - food comes out about 15 minutes after ordering. Ramen is pretty damn delish. Be prepared for spicy 'cos they sure as hell mean spicy! Definitely take advantage of the add ons. I recommend getting the avocado as an add on. The avocado is flavored subtly but you still get an enhanced rich flavor of the avocado melting in your mouth. The ramen has that crisp texture that you expect from fresh ramen. And the char shu? Oh my! Just let it melt in your mouth (trust me, you'll thank me for this tip!). I've been to other ramen places & I've gotten mostly fat but Totto offers real pieces of char shu. So good! I'll be coming back but not at a busy time. I dream of Totto. Yums!

This was my first experience with ramen and I definitely loved it. ?I got the extra spicy totto ramen and it was excellent - delicious, salty broth that had a peppery kick to it to really warm me up. ?I added the extra pork char siu and hard boiled egg which really added to my enjoyment of the dish. ?Definitely add the egg to your order! Now I love eating soup - any kind of soup - in the winter to warm me up. ?However, I do not think there is a soup out there - ramen or otherwise - to justify a two hour wait in the cold. ?We put our name in and then went around the corner for a drink to wait for our table. ?When we returned, we still had a twenty minute or so wait. ?Although they attempt to keep their doorway warm, it just doesn't suffice on a cold day with so many people coming in and out. ? Would I eat at Totto Ramen again? ?Absolutely, but only if I had a way to circumvent the line and not wait in the cold.

Finally I made it to Totto! For all the "rumors" I've heard about this tiny tiny place, I'm happy to say that it definitely lived up to its reputation. ?The line was long, the service was friendly and fast, and the ramen was pipping hot and delicious! I had the Spicy Ramen with pork chashu. The broth was flavor, thick, and creamy; noodles was just the right tenderness; chashu was juicy, soft, with the perfect proportion of meat and fat. Now I understand why people insist on waiting 1+ hours for a bowl of ramen. I can't wait to go back!

A great lunchtime experience. The music is a little intense and the staff is a tad brusque, but it was delicious. ?You have to go at 11, put your name on the list, and show up at 11:55, brush past the standing room only crowd of annoyed people who were just quoted an hour wait and sit down. ?The hassle alone is worth the disappointed frowns staring at you from the other side of the glass.

The most harrowing thing about this place is the wait. It's super small. So you list up and then will have to wait for your name (lots of people leave, come back and check periodically) I got the mega ramen. It's huge, lot of meat, no disappointments. The ramen was a great texture, the chicken soup broth was delicious, and presentation was great. I definitely would come back.

I love that they char their pork belly! makes it extra tasty. The most I've ever waited here was 20 minutes but I always try to come close to their closing time. I think they have a pretty fair system except the guy who manages the list has a bit of AF (if you know what that means). I always catch him ogling the Japanese girls. So I love the broth here, the tonkotsu is porky goodness. The spicy is FIRE BREATHINGLY HOT. Last time I had it, I couldn't really taste anything else. I don't knw how people get the extra spicy. I don't love their noodles, they are the squishy, thick and wavy type. The mega bowl is not that intimidating. I was able to finish it even when I wasn't that hungry. But the extra pork is NOT charred - it comes in big chunks, which makes it a bit unappetizing. And the extra scallions and garlic paste are unnecessary, as it overpowers the porkiness of the broth. This place is tiny (though not as tiny as Rai Rai Ken) and a bit dingy, so don't be surprised if you're asked to share a table or sit at the bar, which gets pretty claustrophobic.

Hummina hummina... Totto was hyped to no other before we came here, so I was hoping for the best. We unnecessarily waited in line for 1.5 hours (you can sign in and come back later, although you risk losing your spot in line), and it was a bit nippy outside. But in the end I think it was definitely worth the experience. Brags (+): I had the Totto spicy ramen with extra noodles (of course) and loved it. The broth was intoxicating, making the noodles so tasty and awesome. I had a food buzz while eating it, a strange sensation to be elicited by eating food that doesn't happen too often. That's how much i liked it. Beats (-): Of course the major downside is the line, but like I said you can probably sign in, go do something for an hour, and come back and only need to wait 30 minutes or so. Oh, and cash only, that's always annoying. Variance (~): I think I saw another review that said the cramped environment makes for an authentic Japanese ramen house experience. Take it or leave it I guess...

If you love ramen, you definitely have to come here!! My friend and I visited New York not too long ago and woke up early to hit up this spot for lunch. Try to get there right when it opens or before so you don't have to wait too long. We put our name on the list by the door and discovered that this place is CASH ONLY! Therefore, we ended up having to walk to find a nearby Chase to get some cash and then stopped by Starbucks to get a quick drink before coming back to Totto Ramen. Surprisingly, like a few minutes after we came back, they called our name!!! The place is really small and cramped. You can see the guys making the ramen by the counter and you're like an inch away from the next table... So I suggest coming here with like one other person. Keep your party small. You're going to be mainly focusing on the food once it comes out anyways. We ordered a char siu mayo don to share. And for our entrees, I got the totto miso ramen and my friend ordered the chicken ramen with spicy bamboo shoots. EVERYTHING WAS DELICIOUS. Like mind blowing good! The broth was really flavorful! The noodles were cooked to perfection! And the meat was so tender! This is the only place where the ramen was soo good that I actually forced myself to finish the entire bowl!! Broth, noodles, and all... The char siu mayo don was also really tasty. The rice and mayo and pork all mixed together in a bite was delicious! The only thing about us ordering so much food for two tiny girls was that this place does NOT let you take home leftovers!! FML so we stuffed our mouths and had food coma for the rest of the day. But IT WAS WORTH IT. Like two weeks after my trip, another friend and her boyfriend went to New York and asked me for some recommendations. Totto Ramen also turned out to be their favorite meal in their trip as it was in mine. :)

We walked by Totto Ramen at least a dozen times and every time, there was a gigantic line. ?So we just had to see what all of the commotion was about! ?We finally stopped in at 2:30pm today when there was no line. ?We got seated right away and served right away. ?Our waiter was super nice. ?But we have to admit that we were a wee bit disappointed. ?It was good, but not outstanding and certainly not good enough to wait for 2 hours like others have. ?We'd go back if there was no line, but we definitely would not wait even five minutes to sit down with all of the other great restaurants nearby.

So even though I usually hate going to places where I have to wait more than an hour (or let's be honest, 20 minutes), my best friend is leaving NY and this was on her bucket list. Plus I conveniently have a friend who lives down the block from this place so he was kind enough to make a reservation for me...so all in all, we waited around 20 minutes by the time we got there, to the annoyance of others. Oops. Anyway, this was much better than I expected. We both got the spicy ramen (+egg, mushroom, & spicy bamboo shoots). Pass on the spicy bamboo, yes on everything else. I probably won't be going back unless I know I won't have a long wait, but the food was some of the best I've had, especially on a cold snowy night. No take-out, no delivery, no to-go boxes for leftovers.

Hands down best ramen I have ever had. I am from California and I visited New York last winter and I still have cravings for totto till this day. However, my opinion should be taken with a grain of salt. I have never been to Japan so I can't say that it is better than ramen there as I would have no idea. The place is literally in the basement of a building and the wait was outrageous. However, I honestly believe that it is worth it. You can see the broth being made in front of you and boy does it smell good in there. The broth of the ramen was so good I wanted a second bowl regardless of the fact that I was about to keel over and explode from a mouthgasm.

Everybody loves this place and I have been trying to go for the longest time. Maybe because of the hype / expectation, I did not find this place "amazing" like everyone else says... I got the spicy ramen and shared some pork bun thingy with my friend. The pork bun was delicious - really juicy and flavorful. The broth for the ramen was a bit too salty for me. And there were a ton of (really) scallions in there, which I am not a big fan of. Also, I think I was still hungry afterwards? To be honest, I am not sure if I'd go again for a few reasons 1. the wait is ridiculously long 2. there are many other amazing noodles places nearby 3. i'd rather go to ippudo if i really crave ramen

I'd been to Totto Ramen numerous times in the past, only to walk away with my friends and go elsewhere because the wait was just too long (according to them anyway). And yes, the wait is always long. It's a tiny place (seats 16-19 I think), and I'm sure many who have sampled the food come back often and keep this place consistently crowded. So it took me a few years to actually finally get to eat here, when we got lucky with a wait of only 30 minutes for a group of 3 (would not recommend going with a group larger than 4 people, you'll get broken up). In any case, the wait is worth it because they serve up arguably the best ramen in the city (right up there with a certain other establishment on 5th Street), and I've been back several times since. The broth is phenomenal, with deep flavour that seems to get better the more you have it, and it has just the right bit of kick that keeps things interesting without ever overwhelming the taste (referring to the Totto Spicy Ramen here). The char siu is thick and tender (soft enough that this chopstick-noob had no trouble tearing it to manageable bits), and the egg (which you should definitely ask for) is absolutely perfect. They clearly have this down to an exact science, and then elevate it with a bit of otherworldly magic. And if you can bring yourself to stop drooling over the ramen for a couple of minutes, you'd do well to order the avo tuna, which is beautifully executed. The tuna is very fresh, and oh so lightly torched. It actually might have even been among the best sashimi I had last year - and that includes some heavyweight competition. If I had the time to kill, I'd go every week.

Not sure if it was worth the 2-hour wait but boy was it good. I ordered the extra spicy ramen which had pretty good broth. I also added corn which gave a nice contrasting sweet tone. My only gripe was that the spice used to make the broth "spicy" was almost all black pepper. This doesn't make the dish spicy but rather harsh. The noodles were cooked well and were better than ippudo's imo. The pork buns were also ordered but these were strictly average. I wouldn't order these here again.

This place upsets me bc it is extremely over-hyped mediocre ramen. I am all for waiting for food if it's worth it, but there is nothing special about it. Broth is chicken based, which tastes generic and synthetic. Noodles are chewy but nothing remarkable. Would not go back, even if there was no line.

I went with the standard miso ramen while my friend had the spicy. I really liked the noodles in mine, but I favored my friend's spicy broth more. The standard miso ramen just fell a bit short. We both agreed it was a little salty though because we were THIRSTY. The norm when it comes to ramen *shrugs* Totto is a great destination spot - when the line isn't long. tips?

I waited 2.5 hours to eat here. Be careful about leaving and coming back. The host does random roll calls to check if people are still around. If you're not, then he moves you to the bottom of the list. The savory hot soup really hits the spot when you've been waiting in the winter cold for 2+ hours. But, once you make it in, you reward yourself with a big bowl of tasty ramen. The broth is so amazing. The ramen tastes even better as you stare outside at the crowd of people who are still waiting to get in.

Simply the best ramen in the city. You can watch the chefs make your food including the homemade noodles. I actually give this place a 4.5 stars (but rounded up because so delicious!) because the place is so small and you have to wait for hours at times. It is best to arrive before 5:30 pm for dinner in order to minimize your wait time to 20 minutes or so. Otherwise, expect to wait for hours in the evening out in the cold. There is always a long outside this place. Don't go in groups (impossible to get a table), best to go in pairs. Groups of 4 is max, otherwise expect to be broken up.

To be fair, my review is probably a tiny bit biased since I have fond memories of street ramen from Japan for $5, and was excellent beyond belief. ?Ok so if you want to go, make sure to show up an hour to 45 minutes before they open and put your name on the list - then go do something else - or else you'll be stuck waiting forever. ?It'll take them probably an hour or so to get through one side of the page of names. Ok now to the food. ?Nothing but quality, for sure. ?They make their own soup stock with chicken in a bag cooked in a stock pot. ?Ingredients were fresh and the noodles were spot on. ?The pork was also excellent and flavored to perfection. ?Pricing is a bit steep, especially when you consider that they don't invest much in service, decor, etc. ?Waitresses were very nice and courteous and we didn't feel rushed (ok I rushed myself because I was starving). ?Definitely worth going once - maybe again if the line isn't too long.

Totto is my favorite ramen place in New York, and I always get the Meat Lovers' Ramen (not on the actual menu, but there's a picture on the wall of it). ?I also always get it with a boiled egg, so protein overload right there. ? If the wait wasn't always over an hour, I'd go here all the time. ?It's a very small space, but the atmosphere is reminiscent of ramen restaurants in Tokyo. ?Thus, if your group has too many people, I highly recommend ditching your friends and eating solo for a shorter wait time. ?Isn't eating delicious ramen worth losing friendships?

Best ramen ever. Can't find a flaw with it. One note, be prepared to wait. It's a good restaurant and it's worth the measly hour. I've waited 2.5 hours for unmemorable food. This is nothing. Put your name down and wait like everyone else. I'd honestly skip the Spicy Totto ramen and go straight for the Paitan ramen. Reason being that the spices hinder the flavor of the broth, and the broth is so good. The pork was better than the chicken too, so get paitan pork ramen. I would go back everyday to have the Paitan ramen. The noodle consistency is perfect and the kitchen is so polite and friendly. They'll get you anything you need. The avo ahi app was super salty so skip it.

I'm somewhat torn on what to give Totto, but in the end it simply wasn't worth the 1.5 hour wait in the freezing cold. The place is indeed miniscule with barely enough space to fit a midget-sized restroom towards the back. ?Thankfully, the front steps are enclosed so you can stay warm provided that you're okay with feeling like a sardine in a can. ?But anywho, onto the food. My friend and I began with a pair of seared pork belly buns. ?The meat? ?Delicious. ?The tartar sauce it was topped with? ?Did not fly. ?Japanese chefs using tartar sauce on pork belly...really? The Char Siu Mayo Don, however, was outstanding with its succulent braised pork and bright, bold yuzu mayo atop perfectly cooked sushi rice. Next, the Mega Ramen. ?I thoroughly enjoyed the lighter weight of the chicken and soy based broth and slew of pork meats. ?Unfortunately, the ramen itself was quite a letdown - overcooked and far too reminiscent of thin Chinese egg noodles. I'd consider returning to try the other broth varieties, but the weak link is far and away the ramen itself. ?It's just not a good sign when the rice bowl is the highlight of a ramen shop.

It's no Ippudo. Not very sure why this place has a line 24/7. I almost rented an apartment upstairs from here so perhaps it would've been my go-to eventually. But I feel like Ippudo, and another favorite (secret...ish, I have a review for another ramen place I frequent...frequently! :p) Very standard ramen. I'd pass if you have to wait longer than 30 minutes.

Well, decided to finally give this place a try after seeing crowds for months in front of it. ?When I got there, there was already again a crowd waiting, I put my name down, waited patiently in the line and close to 70min later got a table. So the Ramen are ok, wasn't thrilled, couldn't see any good reason for the crowd except that we're close enough to Times Square and a lot of tourists/hotels which might help to keep the hype up. ?For all the rest of us, spare yourself the wait - there are better and easier options here in town ;-)

All I have to say about his ramen joint is that I've found the HOLY GRAIL! Sweet jeebus it was a long line coming here for dinner on a Friday night. My friends and I put our names down and left to find some nearby happy hour drinks. After 1.5 hr wait, we came back buzzed and we were seated at the bar. We might have been a little overdressed (we were going out after dinner) because the manager asked my guy friend if we Ashley & I were actresses! Funniest thing I heard so far for our first night in NY. On to the ramen...I ordered the Totto Extra Spicy Ramen $10.75- yea, cause I like it hot and spicy til I burn my tongue off. The good thing is they give you the spicy chili flakes in chili oil on the side. I dunked the whole ramakin in and wasn't pleased with the level of spiciness because I needed more! The chef was wide eyed wondering if I was crazy because I guess not many people ask for 2 more ramakins of the chili! My broth was pretty red compared to my friends. The broth is amazingly good. The first sip is the best. The bamboo is perfect, egg delicious (not as good as Orenchi of course) and oh, the noodles, my heavens the ramen noodles were YUM! I enjoyed every last bite of my ramen bowl. If they ever had a spicy challenge, I'd like to be the first to attempt it. Adam Richman would have to compete with me if this ever happens.

In a just world, there would be six of these tiny ramen houses all in a row, each interchangeable with the other because when you're jonesing for homestyle ramen, any shop should do, right? But this is not the Ginza, it's the Theater District, and luckily, Totto Ramen does it right thanks to owner Bobby Munekata's focus on the quality of the broth and the freshness of the ingredients. Truth be told, it's not quite up to the platinum standards set by Ippudo and Momofuku Noodle Bar, but the hearty goodness compares favorably to just about anyone else in Manhattan serving ramen. And since there aren't five other ramen houses nearby competing for business, Totto appears to be a magnet for the Yelperati and masses of Japanese tourists looking for a taste of home. Be prepared to wait as the place is beyond tiny - a row of counter stools, a table for two and another for four. That's all I could see through the crowd after waiting for a blessedly brief twenty minutes out on the steps with the rest of the hungry noodle slurper wannabes. Once seated at the counter, I perused the small menu, which presents a choice of seven ramen bowls - plus quite an array of toppings and appetizers. I decided to go full gonzo and order the $15.50 Mega Ramen billed as the bowl "for Char Siu Lover", i.e., extra pork for the porkers among us (see photo). The chicken broth was velvety-tasty and not too salty. Topped with several slices of char siu pork, the bowl also features a mound of shredded pork, minced garlic, onion, bean sprouts and julienned scallions. The true test is the quality of the homemade noodles, and they had that perfectly al dente texture and a flavor steeped in chicken and soy sauce that truly marks a genuine ramen noodle. Flat-out delicious. As a side, I went for the $4 Pickled Japanese Cucumber, which looked nothing like the picture in the menu insert. It was just a straightforward cucumber peeled, pickled and sliced and topped with shredded nori. It provided a fresh crunchy nosh that complemented the savory ramen broth. Gee, I think I was done in about twenty minutes, which was just as well since there was a growing army forming outside waiting to get in like a scene from "Soylent Green". Alas, I exited wondering why there can't be more ramen houses like this in San Francisco much less Manhattan. FOOD - 4 stars...really solid working-class ramen nicely executed AMBIANCE - 3 stars...it's a subterranean walk-in closet SERVICE - 4 stars...really attentive...they have to be to turn their waiting list around with haste TOTAL - 4 stars...tiny, high-quality ramen house that I wish was in my neighborhood

Good but not worth the 3 hour wait. Not only was there a 3 hour wait but you lose your spot if your name is called! So the guy's "1 hr" wait turned into 3 and I was too scared to kill time elsewhere b.c I didnt want to lose our spot. The noodles were a nice surprise. They were fresh and medium in thickness, almost spaghetti like. The spicy pork broth was flavorful. However, I didn't find it amazing. I'm much happier with Ramen Dojo in California.

I've been like Goldlilocks in search of the perfect ramen and, for me at least, Totto Ramen is just right. I loved Ippudo the first time around, but came to realize that their pork-based broth while yummy, was just too rich for me. So then I tried their vegetarian broth, but it was lacking complexity. I was beginning to think that eating ramen would always be about making trade-offs and settling for something that was never quite right. But then Totto Ramen came along. Their chicken-based broth is just right, perfect even-- rich without tasting fatty, salty but not too much so, with an indescribably deep and nuanced flavor (umami?). And there is just something so comforting about chicken broth. Besides the chicken rather than pork-based broth, another thing that makes Totto a little different from the other ramen spots I've tried is that all of their ramen comes very basic (little more than straight noodles w/ broth) and you have to order the add-ins separately (e.g. wavy noodles, bamboo shoots, mushrooms, egg, etc.), with each being about $1 extra. I could see how this might bug some people, but I didn't mind as the ramen itself was pretty cheap and I like to be able to customize my bowl. As much as I loved it, I'm not going to pretend it wasn't a huge ordeal to eat here. Coming to Totto Ramen is not for the faint of heart. We had to wait for almost 2 hours, until close to 11PM, on a cold, rainy Saturday night. By the time we got a table (which we had to share with a couple of strangers), I was chilled to my bone, starving, and starting to get crabby. After one slurp of my Spicy Ramen, though, I was a new woman. I do wish they could develop a system like Ippudo's where you can leave and hang out somewhere else until your table is ready. If I were the owners, I'd open a bar on the block and have patrons wait there..They'd get extra income, and we'd get to stay warm and dry. Just a thought.

I can't believe I haven't reviewed this place yet! ?It is one of my top 5 places to eat in Manhattan and well worth the wait. The ramen noodles are perfectly cooked and the spicy rays is wonderful. I can't get enough of it. The wait can be long but the host is very friendly usually. Tip: ?go right at opening and sign. To be seated within an hour. Also, make sure to do the Kai dama. There can never be enough of those delicious noddles!! ? As a side note, it is much less scene-y and less expensive than Ippudo. These people are serious about their ramen, unlike Ippudo which feels more like a club that happens to serve good ramen.

We trekked something like 15 blocks to get here. We wait outside with a crowd. It's 3 PM on a Thursday. C'mon. Wait is short, though, and we're sitting at the booth. We get our ramen-- I don't know what she got-- I got something too spicy. It's crowded. I feel hot and cold at the same time here. The guy is "drying" the noodles very, very close to my face. They use a blow torch for the pork. Take this with a grain of salt. I think I just don't like "real" ramen.

We queued for 3 hours to get in on a Friday night after hearing rave reviews. Better than Ippudo (which actually isn't that good a benchmark), they said. Was it worth it? Not at all, definitely not better than Ippudo. Actually, the long queue time was probably because the place is incredibly small. I had the extra spicy ramen and we also got the avo tuna. Both were very average; flat. Well, one of my friends (out of 4) preferred this to Ippudo, but we all agreed the tuna wasn't great. Not bad, but I was expecting something a thousand times better to warrant the wait. The standard was more like something I wouldn't mind - i.e. I'd go in again if there wasn't a queue. It just tasted like sesame oil, and the broth... well maybe it's a personal thing, but the pork bone broth just didn't work for me.

I have been to Totto Ramen once and I do not plan on returning there again. On a cold winter night, my friend and I waited an hour and twenty minutes outside until the waiter seated us all the way in the back where it felt as if they had turn on cold air conditioning. I could not take off my jacket since it was too cold. Just sitting there, waiting for my food, shivering. However, it did not worth the wait. The noodles weren't well prepared for the first time - it was hard. When I asked for extra noodles, it was meh, okay. I got the whatever "mega" one cuz I was starving. The Cha siu in there were tender and great. But the other meat (which I couldn't tell which it was) was extremely difficult to chew... The soup base was salty as hell. I finished 3-4 glasses of water as I was eating the ramen. The third star was only for the mentaiko rice.

I truly did not think anything could make up for the extremely long wait time. ?Thankfully, for Totto Ramen, their food is REALLY good! The wait time is absurd, but unavoidable: ?word has travelled fast about this place, and New York is a big city, while Totto Ramen fits about 4 or 5 of my computer desks -- it's a small place, get over it! The staff is polite, and do a pretty good job (a difficult one, in fact) managing the queue. ?They will be as fair as possible, taking into consideration people who come in a group of 4 or solo. Speaking of groups of 4 -- that's the maximum party size. ?But believe me, you want to keep your party small. NO CREDIT CARDS, DEBIT CARDS, GIFT CARDS, OR CHECKS ACCEPTED!! ?Cash only!!! These people have ramen down to a science, and now we have a place to enjoy good ramen without withdrawing all of our savings. My ideal order: ?Chicken Paitan Ramen with a hard-boiled egg, AvoTuna, and hot sake!! "Itada kimasu!"

Ate here with my bf around 5-6pm. The place is small with only a couple of tables that requires sharing if you come with one other person. They try to rush you to get you to order asap due to the line. I got the miso and was not impressed at all. The one piece of meat on top, delicious it was, but one skimpy meat and a hand full of noodle for $14~ . The broth was a bit salty and the noodles were tough; it didn't slide in easily when eating. It was good but would I go back again? NO.

Great ramen spot. One major caveat-- The wait blows. Doesn't matter what time you go, there are hordes of people standing around the small entrance awaiting their $15 bowl of ramen. Even on the coldest or rainiest of days. That's dedication for some noodles and broth. I will say though, it is very flavorful and rich. The vegetable ramen is one of my favorites---they just load the thing up with all the vegetables you'll need to eat for a week. The small dishes are not that memorable--stick to the ramen. If only there wasn't such a damn long wait...

It's been a few years since I've come here and I finally had the chance to come back here today. ?My experience today was a bit disappointing and lackluster, unlike the time I came here previously. ?Those were the good old days...long gone, long gone. ? I ordered the extra spicy ramen (last time I had the spicy ramen). ?Spicy-anything here means you're given a little cup of hot chili -- it definitely adds a kick to whatever you add it to. ?It definitely brings out the flavor of the ramen. ?Overall, the ramen was salty, the noodles tasted a bit undercooked and had a starchy film around the noodles -- that sort of film you get when you cook pasta and don't rinse out the noodles properly. ?I ordered corn with my ramen, and it was canned corn. ?Not very impressive. ?Last time I had ordered corn with my ramen, they gave me a slice of corn on the cob. ?I guess this time around, corn on the cob isn't in season so they've substituted with canned corn? ?I really was hoping to get that corn on the cob... but alas, not this time around. Service was hit or miss -- you basically get your order, some water, you eat your ramen, and you leave. ?No such thing as water refills here -- you have to ask for it. ?You'll need it though because the broth was pretty salty. ?Watch out if you have high blood pressure! This place is still cash only. ?So bring your dinero! Probably won't be coming back here again... sad. ?This was my favorite ramen joint in NYC, and today's experience just killed it for me.

For food: I would give 4 stars(for the price, I would even consider 5 actually) For service: 1 or 2 stars I've been to Totto Ramen several times now and I had always thought the food was worth the wait and never complained... until yesterday. Before I start saying anything negative, I want to say that their food is cheap(for New York standard) and delicious. However, their service is a different story. I don't expect the waiters and waitresses to throw flowers on my way to the table, but I do expect them to show me the table and give me respectable amount of time to look at the menu. Yesterday, my sister and I went to Totto Ramen and when it was our turn to go in, the waitresses waved her hand to go inside and I was lost because there were four seats open and I didn't know where to sit. I politely asked one of the waitresses where I should sit and she pointed at one of the seats and sighed. Rough start, but I was okay with that. Totto Ramen is a busy place so I guess the waitresses get annoyed with customers asking questions... I get it. However, as soon as we sat down, another waitress came and asked what we wanted to order. Really? I just saw my ass down and you're asking me what I want? I was a little bit irritated but I ordered one ramen and one unidon for me and my sister(we had light dinner and it was going to be our second light dinner) and the waitress lingered and asked if we wanted anything else. I told her we would share the food and we had already eaten so we don't want anything else and she suggested we order drinks at least 3 times. I politely told her that we didn't want any drinks and with an attitude, she took our menus. Although we were a little annoyed with the waitresses giving us attitude, as soon as we got the food, we were okay. However, the real problem started when we got the bill. We had a lot of coins and we wanted to get rid of them(mostly quarters). We took out 20 dollar bill and couple dollars for the food on the table but as soon as we started counting the coins, we could hear the waitresses complain and sigh behind our back and one of them actually came up to us and said they don't accept coins. Really? I have paid with coins before(not like a crazy lady paying with pennies, but maybe add couple of quarters just to add to the tip) at Totto ramen never did I hear such a thing. I didn't even want to argue so I just left the place. I left 20% tip and I'm still a little bit upset that I did, not because I am cheap but because they will never know what they did didn't deserve a 20% tip. Last time I went there(before yesterday) was about a month ago and all the waiting staff were male except one girl. They weren't particularly friendly either but they were polite and accommodating. Now all the waiting staff are girls and they aren't particularly rude but they sigh and give attitude to customers and lie to their faces. I love their noodles so I'll probably go back but it won't be anytime soon.

CASH ONLY Totto has definitely overtaken Ippudo as the hippest place to go for ramen in Manhattan. Unfortunately for everyone who wishes to patronize this establishment, the result of popularity is hour-long waits at all hours of the day. I thought arriving shortly after opening would beat the lunch crowd, but the crowd outside was visible from two blocks away. The place only has space at the bar, two 4-tops, and 2-top. The sign up list basically says if you've brought a party larger than 4, forget about it. More precisely it states that you need to split up your party. I ordered the totto spicy ramen and was blown away. The chicken broth is refreshing and completely different. The slices of pork included are on the fattier side, but that just added to my enjoyment. The prices are completely reasonable compared to the other place. And although the wait might make it seem like service is slow, the ramen came to the table right away. If you have time to spare, more like 2+ hours, and aren't extremely hungry, Totto is well worth the wait.

Definitely one of the top ramen places I've been to. First off, it's a very authentic Japanese ramen place. ?The guys working here all are of Japanese descent and they have HUGE pots cooking yummy ramen broths all day here. ?Second, I always say that it's the little Japanese places that are the best. Yes, it is small but go to Japan and tell me if you ever find any good restaurants bigger than that. Majority of all the good Japanese restaurants I've been to has always been small. So to see Totto Ramen this size, not surprising. Third, their broth is very very flavorful. ?Every bite was so good. One of the reasons why I really like Totto Ramen is their chili oil for their broths. ?This was a first for me for a ramen joint. ?I've seen places where they give you a spicy miso paste but never oil. ?You would think the oil is disgustingly spicy too but it's actually a very flavorful oil that gives it a good kick. It was a very fun experience eating here. ?The guys were really nice and super attentive and always polite on asking for refills and stuff. ?I was glad I had a chance to try it here on my visit to NY. It was either Totto or Ippudo but I haven't had the chance to try Ippudo yet so I can't make any comparisons yet. ? However, as good at Totto Ramen is, I definitely have to say Shin Sen Gumi is just as good or even better compared to Totto.

Decor: 3/5 -tiny tiny bathroom -seats maybe 15 at most? Service: 2/5 -For a party of 2 @ 1.5 hours...I would not come here again -Service is meh, they only came twice: to take our order and to give us our check Food: 3/5 -Eh, I went with Tiffany S.'s recommendation of the Spicy Vegetable Ramen. Don't get me wrong, you get ALOT fo content. The seasoned avocado were great and you get about 4-5 slices. -I added the Char Siu Pork (+$2) but regret it. The cuts were thick and the meat to fat ratio was way off. -The noodles were decent and the broth wasn't too spicy yet slightly more oily than I prefer. Maybe I ordered the wrong ramen or I came at a bad night but I wasn't impressed at all with Totto. Jin is still ranked as my favorite ramen bar.

this place is totally overblowed!!! We arrived at 11 and were told not to wait inside, so we went to a grocery shop nearby to spend the time. When we got back there at 11:20, there were already people waiting, so we signed up. we waited for about 40 minutes. We were seated beside their kitchen, but my grandmother didn't feel comfortable so we asked if we could seat somewhere else other than the bar, and we had no other choice even if my grandmother didn't feel comfortable sitting there. We had a Totto Chicken Paitan Ramen, Miso ramen and a spicy ramen. Really? Is that what we waited for? It is totally not worth spending hours to wait for. The taste was so ordinary. ?The soup was good, but the ramen itself was tasteless. The pork was very ordinary too. I don't think I will experience this place ever again.

I didn't have to wait too long since I went right after work. 10 minutes? But after eating here, I think it's worth a wait, at least once. This place is tiny! I remember once I tried coming on a saturday afternoon and there was a massive crowd hovering outside (at least thirty people camping out in 30 degree weather, such troopers). The wait was estimated to be 2 hours.. Be sure to write down your name on a clipboard and run, not walk, past the other couple who is also headed towards the same clipboard. I had the Miso ramen. Broth was very flavorful, cha siu was tender, juicy, mouth watering.. Great stuff. Could have eaten more veggies if they threw it in but I was so satisfied with the broth that I wasn't really complaining. My date got the spicy ramen, which was also great, but more unique. ?One of my favorite things about this place was that as we were eating at "the bar" seating area, we got to watch them stir these huge vats of broth. I know it's compared to Ippudo, but I would say it's a completely different experience. If you liked to be stroked and petted while you eat your bowl of noodles in a room filled with trendy lighting and fancy walls, then go downtown. But if you like a 'bare bones' experience of just ramen, then come here. Honestly, I prefer the more down to earth variety, but to each their own (we are still talking about noodles here, right?). In any case, the ramen is good at both places.

The broth is chicken base. ?UNIQUE, right? ?I don't know other Ramen restaurants that use a chicken base, or at least I've never noticed before. ?It's not as fatty, more watery....but you know that pork belly will grease up the sauce and mix in the miso and you have yourself that thick savory full flavored broth that we love so much. Their noodles are fresh and I loved the texture. ?They serve within 10 minutes of your order and it comes out HOT AND STEAMY.... ?Don't dive in too quick or you'll be sure to burn your tongue. ? There is someone who is constantly firing up the pork belly with a torch. ?Smells like the BBQ burn smell but it does not have that flavor, AT ALL. ?The fat melts in your mouth, the meat is soft and juicy. ?The flavor is delicious! ?They are very plentiful with the meat so you may want to consider getting in a run later in the afternoon. ?

My fav chicken-based broth bowl of ramen. Came here late one cooler night w/ friends last year; it was worth the wait that time, and you will wait since it's a skinny hole in the wall. Now this is some food for the soul! Watching them prepare it all at the bar is also a lot of fun. However, I did come back another time for lunch, and the broth was just ok, not as rich and hearty as the first time I visited. Was it merely memory coloring my first visit, or does their broth get tastier as the day goes on, with every subsequent chicken they dunk into their baths?

It doesn't get any better than that! it's all about the broth-the broth was full of flavor, or should I say flavors, the minute I tasted it I was in broth heaven! I had the Totto ramen: the noodles were springy and fresh, not your 99 cents variety, it came with the most delicous pork pieces (skin on for the food prudes), half an egg with the yolk in a semi-cooked jellyish consistency, a ball of the best miso ground pork, and lots of scallions and sprouts! I ordered the spicy rayu on the side and it wasn't all that spicy, next time I am trying the very spicy! And yes there will be lots of next times, I am already dreaming of what am I having next time! The only cons: 1)the broth is a bit salty, and 2)cash only.

Yummy! 5 stars for food, one star for service from the server, but the chefs are really cool! but I'll still give 5 stars on yelp ! Bascially any ramen is good. I still don't know if I like Ippudos better or Totto. two completely different flavors their sea urchin with rice is the best!!!!!!! Seared sea urchin, must try!!!!!!! Service: okay So my boyfriend didn't type exactly 15%. ?We sat at the bar, the server just sat us. ?Didn't serve us or refill water. The chefs gave us our food, drinks, etc. ?I'm from cali and i'm not sure if TIP is standard, but where we come from, we believe tip is based on service. ?We are not cheap either, but we bascially didn't feel like we receieved any service. ?I think we tipped 10%. So after the bill, the server pulled us aside and said "You didn't tip 15%" and we were like oh okay? and? and my boyfriend said, "we are not done with our dinner yet, don't rush us" ?Then we left and the server said you still didn't tip 15%. is there a problem? ?and i was really mad so i said "Now, there is!" I guess in NYC, it is mandatory to tip?? we normally give everywhere 20%, but felt like this place the chef should get the tip! anyone have bad service here with that short asian man with glasses?

Had their Miso Totto Ramen. Apparently it's the best thing they serve according to a friend who frequents there. The wait was about 30 minutes since I came alone. For others who came as a pair++, the wait was longer. Once you enter, you proceed to put your name on the sign up sheet and they will call you out as the customers trickle out. I had the privilege of sitting at the counter and had the fun of watching the chefs doing their magic making the wonderful ramens. The music playing was upbeat and ?it was clean. The ramen was excellent. The pork broth was savory and not excessively oily, the noodles were thin and cooked to perfection, the buta slices was juicy with just the right amount of fat. I remember just smiling after eating the half boiled egg as I haven't eaten a half boiled egg in so long or a ramen to this standard. I usually don't go for miso ramen, but I'm glad I did here--it's no where near the diluted miso soup flavor. The servers were really nice, all smiled, and they never rushed anyone despite the crowd outside. The waitress even prepared the spoon and napkin for me during the wait time even though I was planning on doing it myself once the bowl of goodness arrived. So glad to have finally visited this landmark :) Thanks Totto for bringing back happy memories and for being up to standards!

Every time I've attempted to come here the wait has been forever. The line is always ridiculous that it crowds the sidewalk. But one night my friends and I decided to will the line to see what all the fuss was about. The wait was 2 hours! Maybe because it was a Saturday night, but come on.... The only time I've ever waited in a 2 hr line is maybe the DMV. My rationale for sticking around was "well, this ramen must be out of this world if everyone else is still here and waiting" so I waited.... More curious than hungry. Each time the clipboard guy comes around to call a customer's name to tell them their table was ready, everyone on the sidewalk would hush and SHH so they can hear the clipboard guy better. Each time he'd come out, our hearts would flutter with hope that our names would be called - it was always a brutal tease. It was nonetheless a people-watching opportunity. After waiting for 2 hrs (!!), my friends and I ran inside with excitement. The menu isn't very extensive. Pretty basic ramen bowls. It was about $10 per bowl (I think) and it's cash only. My ramen was pretty good. Can't say it was out of this world but it definitely hit the spot. But was it only because I was really hungry after waiting 2 hrs? Hm. Needless to say, that entire experience took a huge chunk out of my Saturday night. Perhaps the wait isn't as brutal on other nights. All in all: It was really good ramen, can't say it's the best I've ever had. Definitely the best I've had in NYC though. Make sure you're willing to wait in a long line (clear your schedule and don't be super hungry!) and bring cash!

After visiting Totto Ramen multiple times, I am now giving them five stars for the following reasons: -Somewhere along the line they switched from hard-boiled eggs to infinitely superior soft-boiled eggs. -During my most recent visit, I finally tried the plain chicken paitan ramen. ?The depth of flavor in this broth is incredible and in my opinion much better than the Totto spicy ramen or miso ramen. Until Ivan Orkin opens a restaurant here, this is by far my favorite bowl of ramen in NY.

It's a pretty small restaurant . My friends and I had to wait for about one hour. At least there was a heater that kept me warm. Service was pretty decent. ? Totto spicy ramen (original rayu, spicy sesame oil, paitan ramen, scallion, bean sprout, nori for $11) with additional toppings of char siu pork ($2.5) and spicy bamboo shoot ($1) - Broth (without spiciness) has a great flavor and after-taste. Noodle and char siu pork are above average. WARNING - spicy bamboo is REALLY spicy. I basically dumped spicy bamboo topping into my ramen bowl and the broth just got too spicy. ? ? Avo tuna ($6.25) - Overall, it tastes very silky and smooth. Garlic gives the flavor an extra kick. Hmmmm yummmmmmy! Few more notes: - Cash only - Their biggest table can only fits 4 people. So any group that's bigger than party of 4 will need to be separated This little ramen joint is just as good as Daikokuya in Los Angeles. However, if you are going to stay in NYC for 1-2 days and get to try only one ramen place - I would recommend Ippudo over Totto.

I'm falling into blissful food coma so i'll keep this short and sweet. Though the wait was two+ hours, I've gotta say: after tasting Ramen from the West coast/LA to New York, this place won hands down for best broth. I actually got more noodles so I could inhale every drop. The pork was perfectly torched around the edges and fatty all around... delicious. That is all

Hands down the BEST RAMEN I'd ever had. I was visiting NY from Cali and I knew I had to try some Ramen places. A friend recommended this place and also Ippudo NY but I didn't get a chance to try Ippudo. Will do it next time. We were here around 8 and had to wait about an hour and a half. This place is small, I think they had 5 small table and they also have the bar that seats around 9-10 people. It was well worth the wait! Everything about the Spicy Miso Ramen was perfect. The broth was hearty, full of flavor, perfectly blend in with different flavors as you sip it. Noodle were great, meat was tender. This is the only Ramen place that I'm able to finish the whole broth. Most Ramen places, when you get halfway through the broth, it starts to get salty. This broth was so good that I was able to almost finish the whole soup before I got stuffed. I am constantly going to try Ramen places wherever I go, and although some are really good, nothing compared to Totto. I am craving for it as I'm writing this review lol I can't wait to go back to NY to eat at this place and also try Ippudo.

There is no better ramen. ?This is one of the few places that truly lives up to its reputation. ?I pretty much refuse to wait in line for any club, lounge, restaurant, etc, so after I waited over two hours to get in here, nothing short of the absolute best would suffice. ?I was not disappointed. Great food, authentic ambiance, amazing service. ?I will gladly wait in line again to come back here.

I waited 2 hours before I got into Totto Ramen so my expectations were rather high coming in. but confident they would be met as dozens of New Yorkers were willing to go through the same wait. There's just no way people would lineup for a bowl of ramen for hours if it wasn't mind blastingly good, especially in a city like this with countless of other great ramen options. I understood why so many people lined up once I saw my bowl of Spicy Vegetable Ramen sit in front of me. The generous portion of toppings looked tantalizingly good. But it's only after I mixed them all together and took a sip of the broth that I really got it. The intensity and depth of the flavor is like nothing I have ever experienced before in a bowl of ramen. It is so so good, so bold yet so balanced, and despite my lips flaming up from the spice throughout the meal I could not stop shoving the bowl's contents into my mouth. So much pain yet so much pleasure. I'd have to say it was one of the best single dish I've ever had, and to me Totto ramen is a perfect example of what a great ?food spot is all about. A small hole in a building somewhere, a long line to get in and inside a set of clearly passionate chefs that have perfected a ?seemingly simple yet very complex art: serving delicious, succulent ramen bowls. Eating there was an extremely satisfying experience not only for my taste buds but also warmed my soul as every new bite did not come quickly enough. I very highly recommend the spicy broth options and the extra noodles. ? No frills, no pretentiousness, no high-end price tags. Just great tasting food. You will come out of Totto Ramen wanting more of it and you will crave the amazing depth and artistry that goes into each one of its bowls, until the next time you are willing to stand in line for it, which, if you're like me and my wife, will be the day after you first have the priviledge of having your name called in. Vegetarian food: 5.0 (see above) Service: 4.5 (Adequate and friendly - Note: they are quite strict about calling out names and you not answering, they WILL cut you) Value: 5.0 update: Went again the following day.. waited another 2 hours. Still worth it and this time I added sake to the experience... Really adds to the punch of flavor! update #2: 4 days in NYC, 3 visits to Totto. This time I added the spicy avocado topping. Highly recommended :) I don't know what I will do in Montreal, 8 hours away from this place. I will miss it.. sniff.

Totto Ramen offers some of the best ramen in NYC. Get here before you're hungry, put your name on the list, and look at the menu so you're ready to order when you sit down. Wait times can be up to ~2 hours on busy nights, and there's limited seating so I wouldn't suggest going with a party bigger than 4. Once you're inside, you really can't go wrong with any of the ramen choices and toppings, and the prices are reasonable.

WHERE HAVE YOU BEEN ALL MY LIFE. at least that's how i felt when i took my first slurpy bite into my original paitan ramen. despite the fact that i had just gotten off the plane (suitcase in tow!) and waited 2 hours like a sardine with other diners under the heat lamp, it was worth every bite of this ramen that is as close to the awesome ramen i've tasted in japan. the broth is made of chicken?!?!?! no way!!! it is just as every bit as creamy as pork broth, and the velvety mouthfeel is spectacular. i'm not a super fan of the straight noodles that came with, but i didn't realize i probably could have asked for wavy noodles, which i prefer. added a bunch of toppings (wood ear mushroom, bamboo shoots, lots of bean sprouts, PERFECT TEMPERATURE EGG), and i had the best welcome-to-NY meal i could ever ask for. the staff is really friendly as well and their japanese chitchat punctuated with the occasional IRRASHAIMASEEEE really made me feel like i was back in tokyo. the only thing missing is the ramen ticket vending machine. lovelovelovelovelove.

Ramen should be eaten fast and with no talking. That's according to my Japanese friend. I agree! We were in and out in 15min. Probably because we did all our talking while we waited an hour for a spot. But people who went in before us were still there when we left. I guess in US they don't treat ramen joints as they do in Japan. Totto ramen is a small spot and I believe meant to be a quick in and out. Oh well. We were seated at the bar and my friend said the cooks are wasting time chitchattig rather than gettig the food to the customer. ?yes she is very picky ?especially with things that are Japanese. Regardless the ramen is delicious! The soft boiled egg was yummy. I got the spicy ramen. But next time I will get the main ramen dish. I tasted my friend's and it was delicious.

This review is for the food only. The staff is largely the same, friendly four-star bunch, who were simply heroic on the occasion when my friend had a medical emergency here. So I've continued to frequent Totto and I must say that the food quality has dropped remarkably. I stick with the yooj, Chicken Paitan, with wavy noodles and seasoned avocado. Sometimes it's overly salty, and has lost that creaminess that can only come from stewing whole chickens all day long (they're now open from noon instead of just for dinner). The wait is getting unjustifiable. And they're trying to do too much with their new whizz bang special daily ramens like Kimchee Ramen and Superboy and whatever the else.

I'd been recommended this place for ages so I finally decided to make the trip to Totto. I signed my name on the list and was seated in about 1 hour. This place is quite small and the lines are insane. I ordered the pork buns which was so disappointing. The meat was dry and the sauce looked and tasted like mayonnaise which was horrible. Momofuku has much better pork buns. I ordered the spicy ramen which really wasn't that spicy but I was struck with horror when I saw that the spicy sauce was the same one that came in a packet of ramen I used to eat. The sauce is a Chinese spicy sauce that is very black-peppery and not so much spicy and flavorful. The sauce is not bad but it doesn't appeal to me at all. I will not be returning to Totto.

This place is delicious. If you are a ramen lover this is the spot to hit up in NYC -- the only other place that compares is Ippudo, imo. The wait is obviously insanely long, expect to wait at least an hour usually, 2 hours if you go at peak times. Pro-tips-- * Go and put your name on the list at 11:30AM, and you'll usually get in right when they open at noon. * If you're considering the spicy vs extra spicy ramen, just get the extra spicy, the extra spice comes on the side and you can add as much as you want (be warned, it's reallly spicy). * Cash only

One star short only because of the wait but if you're looking for a fast dish once inside then you can't go wrong. ?The broth is pure chicken not watery with chicken bouillion cubes. ?The noodles are the right consistency for the dish. ?Not chewy, not soft. ? ?If they could only accept credit cards and have a bigger space then this would merit 5 stars.

Maybe I ordered the wrong thing, but really, if this was a fantastic ramen joint then everything would be good. And it wasn't. I made it out to Totto while I was couch surfing at a friends in Hells Kitchen so we figured, why not finally see what the buzz was all about? Put our names down around noon on a Friday, went back to the apartment and waited about an hour & a half before venturing back & were seated within 5 minutes. Totto is VERY small, very traditional/authentic Japanese style dining which I liked. What I did not like was the ramen, unfortunately. Ordered the miso because it's my all time favorite ramen. Mistake? Possibly. The flavor really wasn't there & throughout the meal I couldn't help but compare the entire dish to Ippudo's (which, trust me, I was trying really hard to not do). The broth was "meh" at best, and the pork was nothing memorable. Does Totto not make their own noodles? I hated them. Resembled and tasted like the kind maruchan instant noodles are. My friend ordered a pork bun, which she ended up regretting. Did not look appetizing so I refrained from taking a bite after being offered. For the wait time & quality of food, I will not be coming back even if it is more affordable than Ippudo or the like.

They. Do. Not. Mess. Around. Well actually they do, the ramen chefs are quite a lively bunch, but when it comes to ramen, Totto is the authority. Their broth is rich and creamy without being greasy; their noodles are perfectly chewy but do not have an alkaline aftertaste. They do not sully the basics with stinky bamboo shoots or hot pink ginger--they offer crisp sprouts and fresh scallions. And should you choose pork (or if it chooses you...), it is caramelized to a smoky perfection. This is one place where I did not regret waiting an hour in the cold, Ippudo be damned. Side note: I once worshipped at the house of Momofuku pork buns, but am now a true believer in the unctuous pork belly and pillowy steamed bun goodness from Totto. Get one!!

The chicken-based broth!! That magical raiyu (home-made spicy oil)! I don't even like chicken and I'm singing this - that's the magic of Totto Ramen. Delicately rich with a clean, black pepper finish, they know how to do simplicity at its best for the chicken broth. This isn't your mom's homemade chicken soup; it's more like essence of chicken cooked into broth for the royalty. I got the extra spicy totto ramen as I love spicy food (cue ten thousand chili peppers dancing on the menu hahaha), but I didn't end up using all the chili oil. Don't get me wrong, I can definitely handle it and more (dear child, my palate originates from Szechuan), but I didn't want the spiciness to topple the delicate balance of the exquisite broth. Oh, and that raiyu...fried piece of garlic gives it the addictive touch, and it works flawlessly with the ramen. However, 1 star off for the noodles. I always enjoy my noodles al dente in Italian cuisine and on the firm side for Japanese ramen, and these noodles were pretty well-done. The last thing I want is for the starch from overcooked noodles to ruin my soup, and it was teetering on that dangerous borderline. The char siu pork didn't stand out, for although I appreciate the char (literally and figuratively) on the pork, I like mine softer, somewhat seasoned, and more "melty." While Ippudo reigns supreme in the pork-based broth (as well as heartier, heavier flavors), Totto rules over the lighter chicken-based ramen. Indeed, I will brave the wait time again to enjoy that bowel of ramen and ask for firmer noodle, if that's possible. I might even stick to the original totto ramen minus the spiciness, just so I can really enjoy their workmanship of flavors to its fullest extent.

I must admit that after reading about this place numerous times in Time Out and always seeing a long line when I passed by, I have been intensely curious about this restaurant. Finally, my friends and I decided to commit to the line (which took an hour on a Monday afternoon at 3pm, so I can't imagine how long it is at an actual mealtime). There were five of us, which was a big mistake because there is no table larger than four. In fact, there are only two tables for four, a table for two, and bar seating. And that's it. If you go, only go with one other person. When we were finally seated (at two separate tables), service and food were extremely prompt. I had the Avo Tuna, which was extremely delicious, and the Vegetable Ramen, which I really enjoyed...but I was sad that the waitress didn't have it made without onions as I requested. There were no forks, and I'm a bit clumsy with the chopsticks, but even struggling with my noodles, I still finished my entire meal and paid the bill (cash only) before I finished my beer! I think we were inside for only twenty minutes. It's not a place you can really linger. When all was said and done, all five of us enjoyed the food immensely, but only one would brave the line a second time for another taste. He worked in Tokyo for a year and thought the food and atmosphere were extremely authentic. The others felt that they could get food that was almost as good at restaurants with shorter lines and more elbow room.

The ramen was good, but definitely not worth the 45 minute wait on a Wednesday night before our M83 concert. I was freezing, starving, and 30 minutes late to the concert. I'm one of those who prefer Minca's Spicy Basic pork ramen because I loOoOooOoove (yes, I just typed that) roasted garlic and thick, springy ramen noodles. In comparison to Minca, Totto only had one kind of ramen noodle (the regular kind) and far less veggies. I had the spicy which wasn't spicy enough so I was given a small dish of chili oil. Couldn't believe I had to pay extra for mushrooms and an egg when it's free at Minca. I also like ordering a side of cabbage at Minca which wasn't offered at Totto. I think when it comes to ramen, everyone has their own preference. I'd come back here again but wouldn't wait more than 5 minutes. However, I'd wait an hour for Minca. (:

I tried Totto Ramen after the mass amount of rave reviews on Yelp. ?I waited until I tried Ippudo again to refresh my mind and taste buds on the differences. I'm probably one of the few here that think Ippudo is tastier. ?But not to totally knock Totto Ramen- it still is a pretty darn good ramen. ?

Although the wait in line was an hour and 45 min when we were told to wait only 45...our whole entourage of 3 people decided to brave out the long wait by looking at people's parking, taking pictures of a dead chicken in front of the restaurant dropped by the store manager transporting ingredients, etc. ?When they called our names, they said "REALLY?

I had high hopes for this place but it seems a bit hyped up /: Miso ramen was alright, it wasn't like "OH WOW DID THAT JUST HIT MY TASTE BUDS?" ?it was more of a "oh.. ok" kinda taste lol The toppings: avocado, extreme rayu, char siu pork, spicy bamboo The thing that I would say makes this place unique would be their seasoned avocado. Most people wouldn't really consider avocado as a nice topping for ramen but this place makes it work. If you like avocado then you should definitely try it out. Everything else was just average. The extreme rayu and spicy bamboo weren't spicy at all either. I'm not sure if it's because my tolerance for spicy things is high or if it was just that it wasn't spicy. Regardless, this place has left its mark on me with the avocado so if I ever come back to NY I'll make an effort to try them out again.

Noodles - Good and chewy Broth - although not Tonkatsu, they somehow bring out the milky smooth texture in a similar way Cha Siu - Braised and then torched......my favorite kind Cha Siu Bun - (repeat above) Poached Egg - ahhh the on sen egg, how I love thee Aside from Ippudo, which I've forgotten how much I like it, Totto brings out a new Ramen fascination that I can't recall the last time I've had. ?Long gone are the days of flat cha siu which has just been boiling in the pot and thinly sliced. ?This cha siu is the way of the future! ?And with noodles which are soo damn tender and chewy, I've got to say, Totto is legit.

I have lived around the corner from Totto for about 7 years, and I've never stepped foot inside their doors. The line outside was always too discouraging. So, it would make sense that on the first 30-degree night of 2012 that I would decide to try it out, right? Right. After waiting for about 1.5 hours, my party of three was seated at the bar, where you get a (slightly disconcerting) view of your ramen being made. If you're looking for a romantical space to impress a date with your swift chopstick stylings - this is not the place. I ordered the Vegetable Ramen and was less than impressed. Nowhere on the menu did it say that my ramen would be topped with an entire house salad. I was, sadly, looking forward to vegetables, of which there were none. I'm talking pounds of lettuce, people! I sat there in awe/noodle envy of those around me who had made a better choice. The Miso Ramen looked like heaven, especially when topped with corn. If I ever decide to wait that long again for a $0.35 package of noodles, that's definitely what I'm going to order. Jealousy aside, I sampled my friend's ramen and was actually impressed. It's pretty good. Oh, I also stained a shirt flopping my noodles all over. I'm such a messy eater.

My absolute favorite ramen place in New York. I've tried Ippudo's before I came here and Totto's is definitely better. THE ETIQUETTE Come to the place. See the long line snaking out to the street. Go to the door and sign up your name on the list there. Wait patiently for your turn, like everyone else there. Keep the sidewalks and stairs to the apartments clear (seriously, keep to the sides). Pay in cash (they don't accept credit cards). THE FOOD Come here for the ramen, don't bother ordering anything else. The broth and the noodles are what you want to focus on in this place. Enjoy the firm chewiness of perfectly cooked ramen noodles. Slurp up the perfectly seasoned broth which was cooked for hours on end. Sigh in satisfaction. Lament over the pork which kept it from being the perfect bowl of ramen. I know most people will order the pork over the chicken in these places. In this case, however, I recommend the chicken. The pork is usually chewy, fatty, and slightly burned (from the torch that they use). The chicken, while nothing to write home about, is usually more tender and doesn't distract you from enjoying the perfection of the noodles and broth. Try adding an egg. PS: If you're really craving pork with your ramen, try smuggling in Momofuku's deliciously melty pork. Haven't tried doing this but it should make for the perfect ramen experience. CAVEAT I've had only one bad experience at Totto's thus far. I'm not sure whether this is universally true but I wouldn't recommend coming here late night. When I went here at 10pm on a Wednesday, the noodles were slightly overcooked and the broth was too thick and salty (from being boiled all day). WAIT TIMES Expect to wait anywhere between 1/2h to 2 1/2h depending on party size, crowd size, and time of day. The best time to come here is during lunch or in-between lunch and dinner on weekdays. During these times, people usually come alone and finish their meal faster, so your wait time is lessened. Come either singly or in pairs for faster seating.

Now I moved to 52/8 and I went to this ramen place more often. The least crowded time is late in the night before it closes. Usually I went there signing my name, then I went back home taking a shower. After the shower, it would be about the right time to head out again and have a $10 noodle there. I think the tastes would be different ?between a 15min waiting and 75min waiting. Maybe I should rent my shower place for the poor people waiting for hours in front of this restaurant in the cold NYC winter night...

Tried Ippudo last time I was in New York and this trip it was time for Totto! I would probably give 4.5 stars more than 5 stars but I will round up this time. Really glad I was able to eat here, had a great experience eating by myself here despite the horrible rainy weather. After reading (and hearing from my friend) about the awful wait times (Peter K's 2 hour wait) I decided to stop by the restaurant 30 min before opening (Friday 11:30 am). There was a waiting list posted on the door, and I added my name (was maybe 6th on the list) and then wandered off to see if there was any nearby respite from the rain. I gave up and came back around 11:45, and there was already a sizeable crowd that had formed, all hunkered under umbrellas, waiting for the restaurant to open. At noon sharp, they started calling people from the wait list. If you don't answer, your name is pushed back to the bottom of the list. I was called to be seated amongst the first group of diners. Woohoo! Sat at the bar, got to watch them cook the ramen in front of me. I ordered the chicken paitan ramen (which was pretty reasonably priced and comes with onions, nori, char siu pork), and I added on an extra egg and bamboo shoots. The noodles were cooked perfectly and were springy, not overcooked at all. The broth was delicious as well, chicken based broth, no msg, not greasy tasting, relatively simple and delicate, not too salty. The char siu pork is torched, and I thought it was a tad tough and underseasoned, but not too bad. Loved the egg and bamboo shoots. Before receiving my bowl of ramen, I thought I would want kaedama (more noodles), but by the time I finished I changed my mind because I was pretty content and full. So all in all, delicious noodles and broth. Would subtract half a star for the pork and the hole-in-wall-ness. Didn't have to wait super long like some others so that wasn't personally an issue. My hubby can make equally good (or maybe better?) ramen, but this was pretty damn good for eating out. BTW, I think Totto is better than Ippudo.

Spicy ramen broth is super delicious. ?Noodles are fresh and toothsome. ?It's hot in there and really tiny. ?Very authentic feel with the men behind the counter bantering with guests and asking where they're from. ?$11 for spicy ramen so it's not super cheap, but I'd gladly pay it again,

This was excellent ramen, but I'm not sure it's really worth the wait. My friend and I got to the restaurant around noon on a Saturday, and there was a huge crowd of people already waiting. We ended up waiting 2 hours to get a table just for the two of us (Not going to lie, we ended up getting slices of pizza from a little shop to eat while we waited.). That said, the ramen was delicious. We both had the Totto Miso Ramen, which was very welcome after two hours of waiting in the cold. The noodles were pleasantly chewy, but softened in the broth. The Koji miso dollop on top was delicious and added lots of delicious savory flavor to the noodles. I thought the dish was perfect, but it may be a little too rich for others. My friend thought it was a little too much, although still tasty. The service was surprisingly good and attentive for such a packed house. The hostess calling the names was very polite and helpful, and the waitresses inside were very efficient at filling our water glasses and getting our bill. I would easily give Totto Ramen 5 stars for the food and service, but a 2 hour wait? Seriously? I'll probably just hit up a different ramenya if I want a noodle fix.

Comparing Totto and Ippudo is sort of like comparing Apples and Oranges. They're both fruit but they're both completely different because Ippudo is modern ramen and Totto is more traditional. Totto Ramen is also made with chicken broth and not pork-bone so the flavor profile is completely different. Personally, I don't love pork and I love the homeyness of chicken broth. This was literally the ramen of my dreams. Hands down. It is completely worth the wait. I suggest going simple with the ramen. My boyfriend got the niku ramen which has a ton of meat and a garlic sauce but I thought it was too complicated. The basic chicken paitan ramen knocks it out of the ballpark. Simple, homey, rustic with a good amount of shredded chicken and seared charsiu pork: heaven. The unidon was amazing as well: slippery, fresh uni on top of warm, seasoned rice, green onions, and cucumber. Onsentamago (hotspring egg) was perfectly done, topped with a warm broth that slides down the throat easily. It was beautiful.

If you don't mind waiting ridiculously long, then this is the place. I'm not a big fan of japanese ramen but I like this place. Food is great. i always notice the sushi place next to it staring at the line with the look of WTF" lol Since the waiting is inevitable, try around 9-10pm ish? This place is very small and sometimes they make you join the table. In summer time, beware that there is no AC, even if there is, it wouldn't be cool becuase they are boiling this broth all the time. I always get exterme spicy ramen that comes with a separate hot sauce so you can decide how much to put in. You can also customize your ramen with many choices of toppings.

I went here for the first time last week. It has a nice interior design, typical for a ramen restaurants in NY. Its not too spacious so theres not as many seats, if you go at a busy time you're likely to be waiting for a bit. Around the afternoon (2-4pm), shouldn't be too bad. I found this place from a blog I read online which reviewed the best ramen entrees in the city, and this one was mentioned as #1. I tried the recommended dish, Totto Chicken Paitan Ramen, with extra chicken and egg. It was quite delicious, the chicken was nice and tender. The noodles are the best you could try anywhere, a bit chewy and not too soft. The only complaint I would have is the chicken broth, it was good but the taste I would say is similar to Campbells Chicken Soup broth. Overall I was satisfied with the ramen. My friend went with the vege ramen, also said it was good. Definitely will give this another try, perhaps try one of their pork entrees.

A long line up in the cold but worth every second. I've been waiting for about 15 min. Very good noodles in a very rich (maybe too rich) chicken and soy. In a nice portion. The pork is too fat, almost only fat... I recommend the chicken. Nice spice with the extra spicy version.

I love the Niku Ramen, although they have cut down on how much Niku they give you. The Spicy Tuna Don is delicious as well. However, if you don't eat pork (I eat pork, my girlfriend doesn't), go with no Niku instead of substituting chicken. They use white meat chicken and it was very dry. Not a good look. Also, the server I had had an issue with my Uniqlo-bought t-shirt, probably because he couldn't read the kanji on it. Maybe he was so upset by my shirt, he forgot to bring me my beer, so I had to ask another server for it. I have been working in the restaurant industry for 14 years, and this is more common sense than anything, but don't get cocky with customers. It doesn't do anything positive for the reputation of your restaurant.

If you've got the time this is such a great experience. We showed up about 25 mins before opening on a Tuesday. Thanks to a cancelled flight we had the afternoon free, and this dovetailed perfectly into another visit to Totto Ramen. We were high on the list so we knew we'd have a spot once they opened. People that got there 10 mins or so after us were not so lucky as the sidewalk got PACKED! Part of what makes it so fun here is the anticipation and the whole system of waiting for your name to be called. As usual in NYC, great people watching. Anyway, the ramen lives up to the hype. I prefer the Spicy Ramen over the miso ramen. I would add an egg to whatever ramen you get. You will want to buy me expensive gifts or provide me sexual favors to thank me later. There's plenty of Char Siu pork in the normal serving I would say, but I've added extra and enjoyed it. Overall, delicious, even for chicken broth. Clean and tasty, and counter seating is a plus if you get the chance.

OK, I'll give it to everyone; their ramen is pretty tasty, but having to wait not 1 ... but TWO & A HALF HOURS just to grab a table on a cold Friday evening is RI.DIC.UL.OUS. I actually came at 5pm on a Friday to put my name on their waitlist and the line itself was about 20 minutes (seemed like no big deal) but in order to be seated, all parties must show up. Needless to say, I had to come back when all of my party was able to show up. Fast forward 2 hours later (7pm), we come back to put our name on the list again and we're bombarded with 2 pages of names. The restaurant itself was super small already and the line out the door definitely was greater than what the restaurant could accommodate. My NY friends really wanted me to try this since it's so popular; I abided. I don't mind waiting if it's amaze-balls, but factor in long lines outside on a cold cold night does not make for a good impression. We didn't get our seats til about 9:30pm, but what made me really furious was when the guy SKIPPED our name on the list & seated another party of 3 ahead of us (the nerve! well, turns out he placed our names on the top of a new page but forgot it.... argh!) FOOD - yes, their ramen was good. I enjoyed the "niku ramen" I ordered (lots of pork meat & favorful broth) but they do not serve any hot tea ... just cold water (on a cold night... thanks) Overall, the ramen was good, but I'm still left with a bad memory of this place. If I ever return & have to wait even an hour to get seated, I'm out. It's TOTALLY not worth the wait!

I always find it amazing how wonderful and excellent food come from little kitchens and hidden gems around the city. I've been wanting to try Totto Ramen for a while especially after my boyfriend & I tried Ippudo NY. I came here with my boyfriend and our friend for a make-up birthday dinner. The wait for a table wasn't long at all since my friend arrived first and made a reservation. We got seated within minutes of arriving. The staff here are super friendly and welcoming. The menu is small, but after taking a quick look I knew exactly what I want. I ordered the Totto Chicken Paitan Ramen because I wanted to try something different other than the typical Miso and Soy sauce Ramen. The Totto Chicken Paitan Ramen were cooked al dente in a chicken and soy sauce based soup. It was topped with scallion, onion, char siu pork, and a nori. Of course I ordered a seasoned boiled egg for an extra topping. The chicken was slightly overcooked, but still good. The bowl of ramen was heavenly. ?The broth was rich with flavor. Truly and amazingly tasty! My boyfriend ordered the Niku Ramen which was topped with a variety of pork meats, garlic, onion, bean sprouts and scallions. It was like a pork paradise on top of ramen. I totally forgot what my friend ordered, but all of our ramens looked amazing! Definitely excellent quality and worth the wait! If you're visiting NYC or live in NYC, definitely try out Totto Ramen because this is a restaurant that you simply cannot pass up.

As a ramen enthusiast I have visited most major ramen places in the US. I must say, Totto Ramen is fantastic. The chicken broth makes it really unique, and the additional options are as well. I have never had avocado in my ramen before, but it was really, really good. The spicy ramen was perfect, just the right amount of heat. Overall I'd say this place ranks #2, just behind Daikokuya LA but slightly better than Ippudo. My only critique is that the service was just alright. We had to ask to get more water which even then took a while. Nothing about the service was memorable in a good way. I love the tiny hole-in-the-wall atmosphere. No nonsense, just ramen.

Delish ramen that is way more affordable than Ippudo NY. // WAIT // Be prepared to wait, this place is smaller than a NYC apartment. Wait for 2 people on a Thursday night at 6:30 PM was 30 minutes. We were lucky most ppl ahead of us on the list gave up and left. // FOOD // The broth at Ippudo wins slightly, but you cannot beat the price and value you get a Totto (way more food for way less money) ? ? + Totto Miso Ramen: Came with wavy noodles (as oppose to their standard straight noodles) and miso paste you mix into your broth. The broth was creamy and my small bowl was packed to the brim with goodies including tons of bean sprouts and green onion. The char su was melt in your mouth perfect as well ? ? + Mega Ramen: A huge bowl with tons of chunks of pork. The broth of this bowl is chicken based and slightly more flavorful than the miso based soup. It is amazing to sit at the bar and watch the chef blow torch the pork into melty deliciousness. The bowl will definitely fill up any hungry big eater!

Been here twice... once with a group of friends (Saturday 2 tables for 4... took over an hour.) and went here by myself (on business)... was seated immediately. Case in point... it's rough to go with a huge group. The largest tables they have seat 4. They also have bar seating. For some reason, not having to wait makes my experience a zillion times better.... Ordered the spicy chicken ramen with corn. Delicious. I don't think any of the appetizers are worth mentioning... and don't recommend the char siu, unless you like fatty pork/big slab of bacon (I hate, hence don't recommend). The chicken is great though. Worth the wait... if you get to sit at the bar, you can see them make everything too. kind of neat. Great price for NYC. Very conveniently located near times square... note they take CASH only... Can't wait to come back!

One of my favorite ramen places and worth the wait. ?Relative to Ippudo, I prefer Totto since it's more traditional style (although Ipoudo is still good). The restaurant is tiny, hence the long wait. I was advised to line up early before they open for lunch to get the first seating, but I was a little late & got there around 12:15pm (on a weekday). My friend & I were waiting in the Japanese place next door and missed our names getting called. ?They have a strict policy so our names went back to the bottom of the list... Luckily for us, the wait the second time around was actually a lot shorter. ?The first wait time was about 30 min, the second wait time about 15. ?All in all, the wait isn't terrible and didnt draw away from my dining experience. I ordered the totto miso ramen with extra char siu pork & nori. During the summertime all of their broths are lighter and chicken based. ?I had never had chicken based ramen broth before but it was delicious. ?I also love that their broth doesn't have MSG, so I didn't get that painfully heavy, stiff feeling afterwards. I was hesitant to get spicy sesame oil in my ramen because I wasn't sure if it would be too spicy & take away from the flavor of the broth. ?However, I tried some of my friend's spicy ramen & thought it was delicious but tolerable, so I ordered an extra side of their original rayu. ?Now don't get me wrong, if you dump the entire side of rayu into your bowl, it will be super spicy. ?But I liked being able to add the rayu to my liking, and I think it really complemented the flavor of the ramen broth. I highly recommend getting a side of rayu if you like a little extra spice (and try the extreme rayu if you are a spicy foods aficionado) So MSG-free, yet flavorful broth...check. Noodles are hand made and delicious, check. ?But perhaps the greatest thing about Totto Ramen: the char siu pork. ?It was perfectly fatty and the best char siu pork topping I've ever had. ?Together, all of the ingredients combined to make one of my all-time favorite ramen bowls. Service is efficient - they are understandably busy, but still nice and helpful. ?Prices are decent. Sitting at the counter gets hot, but it's fun to watch the chefs work their magic. ?Overall, I really enjoyed Totto Ramen and will be back again.

Okay, my BF may not agree, but I thought their spicy ramen was amazing! The broth was delicious and there was fried garlic mixed in there (you put fried garlic in anything you make for me, and I will probably love it). It wasn't too spicy, which is nice, because although I love spicy food, I like to enjoy my food and not have to down a gallon of water. The wait for 2 wasn't too bad on a weekday for lunch. We didn't realize it was cash only so we had to scramble to a nearby bank (surprisingly, at least for me, many places are cash only in NYC... totally not used to this!). Anyway, the ramen is amazing. It's nothing I've tasted before, which is a good thing. It was different AND amazing. Amen.

My neighborhood standby when i'm craving ramen. I've been here the first week it's opened and now have seen the clientele get larger and larger with the wait lines get longer and longer as well from all the buzz and now in every foodie publication and tour book. I miss the day i can just walk up and grab a seat and chat with the folks behind the bar space. ?I don't fault it though it's great ramen and ramen broth. You can definitely get the boney broth that just elludes flavor. It's also great that as the months pass they expand out the menu as well. I've seen great salads and rice dishes that appear along with new ramen specials. The Mega ramen 3 kinds of cha sui is a favorite with its huge bowl and portions along with the cha sui bun. Tip: come by at 5:30 pm or late at night and you might be able to grab a bar space without having to wait. Though if you do wanna come around peak hours and wait outside along the stairs and sidewalk, i have to admit its a great place to meet girls. Plenty of single college girls and up waiting for the same ramen and gals from out of town. Skews asian girls so ramen must be the new bar scene.

Summary- straight awesome bowl of deliciousness served in no nonsense atmosphere. Long waits appear to be the norm but I got lucky and waited maybe 10 mins at 1:05 pm on a Tuesday. Food- 5 stars I got the spicy ramen with chicken. Pork appeared to be even more awesome, get that. The bowl was just all around awesome, tons of flavor, perfectly cooked noodles, great combo of flavors. Want more, now. Service- 4 stars No nonsense but efficient. Sign in on the clip board at the bottom of the stairs and wait. Atmosphere- 3 stars Nothing special, but I wasn't here for that anyways. A little tight for sure. Value- 4 Stars Not cheap but oh so worth it.

Wife, daughter and I went to Totto to give it a try, and had to wait 1 hour in line before getting in. ?If I was rating ONLY the food, I might bump my rating up to "4". But in rating the whole experience, I'm sticking with "3". The Food - in general, the food was good. I liked my soup more than my wife and daughter liked theirs. They got the basic, and I got the spicey version. That might have accounted for why mine tasted better. ?We started with the pork belly buns - good, and I'd eat more. The ramen was tasty. I prefer a milky pork broth, but Totto only serves chicken broth. And they do a nice job. The Experience - Totto is so small, there is not much seating. Only 2 tables that seat 4, a couple tables seating 2, and the rest must sit at the bar. My wife, daughter and I had to sit at the bar. You sign up your name on a clip board and wait. Standing on the sidewalk. Waiting. No indication when your turn might come up. Parties of 1 or 2, got in more quickly, in fact, some arrived after us, and got in first. That bothered us. Once inside, the staff was friendly and attentive (good), but it's so tight and crowded, it's not really a place to sit and relax and enjoy your meal. You feel like you need to get in, eat fast and get out, so they can get the next folks in. Bottom line: I won't go back. It's not worth waiting in line for the food or experience. There is better food, and better experiences to be had elsewhere. ? On the other hand, there are long waiting lines for a reason. So maybe you should decide for yourself.

One of my two favorite ramen places in nyc (the other is ippudo). They take each step of ramen making to precision in this dimly lit, tightly packed ramen bar, with lounge-y light techno music in the background. The broth is cooked with rice to thicken, then with chicken for 6 hours to infuse the broth with all that goodness, and char siu is torched on the outside for crispiness which gives a bit of the burnt look. I had the miso ramen - the ramen is cooked al dente for the right texture, scallions super fresh laid on top at the end, and the soy egg with perfect soft texture inside. One couldn't help but add a poached egg (can be consumed as an oden as well) as a topping - the most slippery poached egg that i ever had, the egg white dispersed into the ramen soup to give another layer of whimsical nature in the soup. Japanese pickles I ordered were a bit too salty for my taste, and sea urchin don was done well but not spectacular. Beware of long waits. I showed up on christmas day with line of 14 people, left when there were 22. Luckily i was a party of one, so I walked straight to the counter for an available seat right away.

damn. as i sit here writing this review i am salivating at the thought of this delicious ramen . . . needless to say, i am hooked and everytime i think of ramen, i will want to go to totto. and seeing as how i'm the type of gal that just goes after what she wants . . . many a night will be spent waiting in line to slurp down these delicious noodles! before my first glorious rendevouz with totto, i had walked by the venue numerous times and figured it was something special, what with the crowds of people waiting to enter the pearly gates of ramen . . . it took one night of FOMO (fear of missing out) and an empty stomach to get me to this place. myself and two of my dining companions waited well over an hour in the freezing cold for the experience. umm. WORTH IT. i opted for the spicy ramen with pork. i can't even begin to describe the magic that was taking place on my taste buds . . . when i scooped up that delicious broth and tenderly, somewhat apprehensively, eased it into my mouth. WOW. the spice was something special. a concotion of flavors and spiciness married to the broth, enhancing it without taking away the bold flavor foundation. the noodles were a perfect al dente. my only complaint - not enough of them. i'd prefer my noodle to broth ratio to be 2:1. the pork is cooked on a wire rack with a blow torch and my ramen came with two perfectly tender slices of it . . . just enough. and while i can't recall many of the other ingredients, i will just say that my bowl of ramen noodle soup was a total home run. and it was ridiculously filling. definitely a winner at just $12. also, the staff are ridiculously friendly and incredibly entertaining. i have only sat at the bar, and i think i would prefer it to the tables as it gives you an intimate glimpse into the ramen-making process. i know there is an intense world of ramen critiques out there - everyone trying to figure out which is the best ramen place in the city. notwithstanding that, totto ramen is just simply good. if you're in this hood and have a knack for patience, try totto! you won't be disappointed.

The place is just overrated, especially, you have to wait over hours to get in and turns out just an "not bad" noodle. I don't like their chicken noodle, the noodle itself is too soft w/o any special feeling. The noodle soup is also not concentrated. Overall, it's quite far away from my expectation and it can not compare any ramen place I tasted in Japan. Ippudo is better, although, they are both not in my top ramen choice. However, BETTER THAN NOTHING, you can not expect more in the city.

I was expecting more. ?From the 4-star rating on Yelp off of 1000+ reviews (and counting), the 1 hour wait from 5:15 to 6:15, and the quasi-religious level of hype that seems to get bestowed at Totto. ?Here's my breakdown. Service: Clumsy. ?Ordered Spicy Pork Ramen, and had the waiter bring it over insist it was chicken....huh?? ?Chicken Broth perhaps? ?Anyways, I decided to eat whatever was in that bowl. ?Also forgot to bring the kaedama portion of noodles, for which I had to remind the waiter about. ?Finally, mid-way in the meal, we are served a pork something-don which we did not order and had to send back... Avo Tuna Appetizer: Quite visibly brown slice of avocado, arrangement very hastily slopped together. ?Tuna was decent, but could have been more tender. ?A sad looking and tasting dish overall. Spicy Ramen: For the good, noodle texture and consistency were excellent. ?Also the side of egg is poached to a yolky perfection, beautifully executed. ?On to the bad. ?Broth surprisingly lacking in depth of flavor, almost bland. ?I have been told from some more frequent-goers that the broth can vary widely in flavor, depending on how long the meats have been cooking for a particular pot, so it's likely I got unlucky. ?Pork belly pieces had some slight char marks, but did not translate to any sort of textural crispiness , still tasted like the meats had been straight boiled. ?The vegetables in the soup are quite forgettable. ? Spicy Tuna Don: In the description, this is advertised as tuna sashimi served over rice. ?What is served resembles a very unappetizing orange paste over rice. ?No slices of fish whatsoever. ?Everything tasted too rich, and the texture is almost slimy. ?Did not like this dish one bit. ? In the end, I felt like I had been let down...badly. ?I'm curious whether I just had an unlucky experience, but probably not curious enough to go through the wait again. ?This honestly felt like a below average to average ramen experience and not particularly noteworthy. ?Based on my experiences, to even mention this place in the same breath as Ippudo is preposterous.

I got the miso with seasoned avocado. It was quite good except it wasn't piping hot. It was only semi-hot. I like my ramen really hot. I think the avocado was a bit much. The broth and pork was very tasty. We had the seared tuna app and that was pretty good. We were lucky and didn't have to wait that long, but I've heard wait times can go up to 3 hours. I think I would only wait up to an hour.

I've only got one thing to say about this place. Please get a hostess that can pronounce names properly. I was listening to her butcher names all night. "RIIIIIIIII-YEN??? RIIIII YEN?" A moment later I realized she was calling for RYAN. Jesus if my name was Ryan I'd definitely ignore her. I noticed my name was crossed off the list without being called and when I spoke with her she claimed she called it. I swear she crossed off my name just because she couldn't pronounce it. Or she butchered it so bad I had no idea she was calling for me while I was sitting 2 feet from the entrance. Great ramen. Expect a long wait. Kind of smells like piss inside.

I like the no-frills at Totto. You write your name down, you wait, you eat, you go. TINY place. A lot smaller than Ippudo, but they have pretty fast turnaround. I went on a Monday afternoon around 1:30 PM, and I only waited about 15 minutes, BUT it was only me. Singles get in MUCH faster, so if you want ramen for lunch, ditch your friends. It'll be worth it, I promise. $11 for a Spicy Ramen. I loved the broth of this ramen more than Ippudo's, and I think I like the texture of the noodles at Totto more too. So... yeah, I think I like Totto more than Ippudo. Don't get me wrong, Ippudo is great. I think it's winning with the majority of Yelpers, but Totto definitely gives it a run for its money. I like Totto's broth more, but I do like the toppings at Ippudo more. Hm, it's a tough call. I think I'll have to return to both restaurants. Darn. ;)

Ramen nirvana. The noodles are freshly made and cooked perfectly al dente. Broth is flavorful. Pick any of a number of toppings. Totto Ramen and Ippudo are neck-and-neck for best ramen in the city, but I lean towards the simplicity and pure flavors of Totto Ramen. If you're going for lunch, I would advise stopping by around 11 am to put your name on the wait list. You can then wander off wherever you want as long as you're back by 12 pm. They start calling names precisely at 12 pm when they open, and if you miss your name, you go to the end of the list! I think they seat somewhere between 20-30 people in total.

OMG. ? Totto Ramen was off the chain in a major way. ?Typically I like Momofuku better than Ippudo. ?I rarely make it up to the UWS so this was a special trip. ?I came up on a Wednesday at 5:30 PM and was seated immediately at the bar. ?Good hip hop playing in the background. ?Where else can I get an extra tasty bowl of ramen noodles with real Japanese folks and hip hop playing in the background?! ?I love New York. I ordered the Paitan pork ramen with extra char siu. ?For me, it was the broth that did it - it wasn't watery. ?It had a thickness and with pieces of pork mixed in, it was really filling. ?Typically I go straight for the noodles but the broth was the star here. ?Everything about this bowl of soup was amazing and I was 100% satisfied with it. ?The ramen chef behind the counter asked me three times if I liked it and that was a mark of good service. ? In a previous posting, I noted the weakness of the ramen at Slurping Turtle in Chicago. ?That place does not even come close to competing with Totto. ?I'm sticking to the fact that I'm not having another bowl of ramen til I'm back in NYC. ?'Nuf said.

MEGA Ramen! 9 pieces of melting chashu heaven along with nicely prepared ramen noodles! Tip for eating here with a big group: Go early and put your name down, then go to the sushi joint a couple feet away and have a couple of drinks while periodically checking back to see if your names are about to be called. My group of 19 did that and was able to be all seated together (took up the whole restaurant) Ramen Chef's chatted with our group and was very amused that we took up the whole place, made it a great ramen experience in NYC!

First of all, I admit the ramen and the pork bun are really good. But the store is too small and the waiting time is forever. I understand the popularity so nothing to be upset. However, the thing that makes my only visit unpleasant is the forced 20% tipping rule, and no credit card policy. I dont know if it is something tax related.

0. Skip Ippudo, head to Totto. 1. Bring a book or your iPad/Kindle - the wait can be prettyyy long. Make sure you are present when your name is called so someone else wouldn't have the opportunity to pretend to be you and steal your place in line. (Yes I actually witnessed this today.) 2. Get the char siu miso ramen with rayu on the side, if you can handle it, then get the one with gazillion spicy peppers next to it on the menu. 3. Accompany above ramen with a cold Sapporo. Now you know all the steps to a great meal!

Totto Ramen is yummy for sure. It's a tiny restaurant that serves ramen with a chicken based broth. I ordered the Miso Ramen and added bamboo and nori. The miso and pork scoop that was on top was soooo good, I really enjoyed that miso paste. The soup was thick and flavorful, you could definitely tell it had been brewing for a long time to get it that way... and a plus, they don't add any MSG, yay! The noodles were perfectly done and the char siu was nicely charred (and sliced thick, woohoo!). The prices are definitely cheaper than rival Ippudo's, but the wait is probably just as long, if not longer because it's such a small place. We got there around 6:30pm and waited quite a while before getting seated. Overall, I'd go back, but during low-traffic times so I don't have to wait long.

this is probably my favorite place in the city. the ramen is ridiculously amazing. always get extra pork. and spicy bamboo shoots. this place is a wonderland and its not pricey at all. so, of course, there's the wait. people are such babies about the wait. come here with a good friend. come here on a date. put your name down and go to vintage or arriba arriba or any of the other bars around the corner. have a drink or two. go check if its almost your turn. if it isn't, go back for another drink. if your name was called and you weren't there, then write it down again (it's that good) and go have another drink. if you miss it yet again then this time you might want to sit and wait. you'll be drunk enough where the wait won't feel as long. this place is a good test of character - is your date patient? are they fun and adventurous? do they appreciate good ramen? all your questions will be answered.

BOWL OF PURE DELICIOUSNESS = CULINARY HEAVEN Totto has the best ramen in NYC. It is well worth the wait. I advise not eating at least a day prior to visiting. A day after eating at Totto, and I still feel like I might explode. WORD TO THE LADIES- wear a flowy dress to allow room for extreme stomach expansion, and don't wear tight jeans for the next few days...and if you do, just unbotton the top button...that's what I'm doing right now at work. Oops! Make sure to sign your name down on the clipboard and don't miss when they call you to be seated or else you'll go to the bottom of the list! Parties of one get seated extra fast. Food comes out really quickly and service is great- everyone is super friendly. Shout out to Spike! Oh, and CASH ONLY! I ordered the spicy ramen with pork, egg, and avocado. I asked for extra spicy sauce on the side and ended up dumping the whole bowl on top of what they give you already. And OMG, I can't even describe how good the broth was- there's a perfect amount of salt and pepper, not too much to make you feel like you're slurping flavored saltwater. It's not too spicy (I kind of wanted more kick to it but whatevs- I'll try the extreme spicy ramen next time) and the noodles are perfection. Totto is definitely one of those meals you have to "walk off" instead of taking a cab home, trust me you'll feel way better. Once you're home, lay horizontally for a few hours before making any fast movements. I can't come here regularly because I am soooo uncomfortable after eating, but it's soooo worth it.

Excellent ramen. ?Flavorful broth, noodles with good texture, tender and deliciously fatty chashu, perfectly cooked marinated soft boiled eggs. ?The ambience of this restaurant is very similar to that of a typical ramen shop in Japan. ?Expect to wait a while to get in unless you get there at least 15 minutes before the shop opens to put your name down on the sign up sheet. ?Probably the best ramen I've had in the States so far. ?Cash only.

Long lines. My friend used to live across the street from this place so we'd put our names on the signup sheet and paint our nails in her apartment while the line moved along. We eventually got seated at the bar where you can watch them assemble steaming bowls of noodle goodness, spooning liquids out of scary looking vats and plopping miscellaneous items into the bowl. I got the Spicy Totto Ramen, which was delicious. I have a pretty high tolerance for spice and this was just slightly out of my spicy comfort zone. I imagine that the EXTREME SPICY ramen tastes like gasoline and sriracha. They slice some pork into it, which is very good, but I didn't care for the nori. Servings are huge. Overall good meal, but doesn't exactly live up to the hype.

Ever since I was a young child, I loved ramen. My mom used to cook it in a pot with poached egg, vegetables, and Chinese sausage. Starting in college, ramen ceased to be a nice meal, but instead, became a late night comfort food that would tide me through the last ten pages of my paper or few hours of studying. It also made for a cheap, yet delicious meal. But once I moved to New York, my friends started telling me about gourmet ramen cafes and I started seeing them all around town. Totto Ramen seems to be the legendary place to check out so a couple of friends and I came here for dinner on Tuesday. From down the street, you can see Totto Ramen. Not because it's a big place, but rather, because there are an insane number of people waiting outside. Optimistic that the line would move quickly, we added our names to the list around 6:30. The host said it would only be an hour. 30 minutes pass by and we're still pumped. An hour and we're really pumped. An hour and a half we're starving and considering going elsewhere. Two hours and we're grumpy and really annoyed that the line seems to have not moved. The chefs seem to sense our impatience (or are intimidated by the fact that we're standing right by the door almost glaring at the happy people slowly eating their ramen) and apologize for the wait, but since it's such a small spot, all we can do is wait. Finally we are in! We start off with the Char Siu Pork Buns, which had field greens and tartar sauce in it. It was interesting and my friend and I agreed that it might cater more for people who didn't grow up eating pork buns, especially because of the tartar sauce. I then had the Totto Spicy Ramen with pork, which was delicious! The noodles were perfectly cooked and the broth was amazing! Not very spicy, but peppery and with lots of scallions, just the way I like it. Yum! My one complaint was that the pork meat was super fatty, which I'm personally not a fan of but it made my friend happy. I got full after eating half the bowl but it was so good I couldn't stop. All in all, Totto Ramen did not disappoint. I'll be back, but I would definitely not wait another two hours to get food. People mentioned that something in the kitchen was broken which is why the wait was so long, but the host could've said something instead of telling everyone that it would only take an hour max. I now understand the Totto Ramen hype and can't wait to come back (and maybe next time, if my wait is shorter, I'll add a star to my rating)!

Delicious, hot, savory, fresh. Om nom nom. I could eat this every week. We waited for about 25 minutes (less than the 40min they said it would be) on a Thursday night and were lucky enough to be seated at the bar, so we were front and center for all the ramen-making action. Spicy pork ramen was super delicious. Just wish I had kicked in the extra $2 for a soft boiled egg in my soup to round out the richness of the flavors--salty broth, silky noodles, good level of spice to wake up the taste buds. BIG bowl but I managed to finish it, like a champ. The pork was really fatty--I know this is a thing but it's not my style--next time I'd go with chicken. Just FYI to those who, like me, prefer the leaner cuts. My friend had the Thursday 'Hellboy' special and WHOO was it SPICY! Not a huge fan of the texture of that one--something about the spices made it feel a little grainy on the palate. We also tried the seared tuna with avocado appetizer--yum, yum, YUM. Responsive service and satisfactorily friendly, no-fuss host and servers. Go here if you want to love yourself with food.

Everyone likes to compare this place to Ippudo, but the two are worlds apart, and not in terms of quality. Totto is designed like a traditional little street-side ramen shop (idk I'm talking out of my ass here, I've only been to one ramen shop in Japan in my life), whereas Ippudo is a pretty big ordeal; the restaurant is pretty damn big and the bar seats only make up a small percentage of the total capacity. I recognize that I can't make an unbiased review of JUST the ramen, because of course, ambience/environment/surroundings/whatever you want to call it has an effect on your perception. Totto Ramen is amazing, but I just prefer Ippudo because I like the restaurant design more. To the food specifically: I had the Miso Ramen. It was great - I doubt the miso is made in house, because I believe that's really difficult to do. But that notwithstanding - great, full flavor. The flavor of the broth was really enhanced by the miso. However, while it did add some nice flavor, I wasn't a huge fan of adding onion to the broth - it just doesn't seem very traditional to me. Edit: Looked up "how to make miso." Apparently it's actually pretty simple, so I take back my statement about it probably not being made in-house. I have no idea whether it is or not.

Just like the other big gun in ramen in NYC, Ippudo, the ramen here is awesome and you are going to have to wait extremely long to overpay for a bowl of noodles. But it's still delicious and I still waited at both places, and it was definitely worth it and very satisfying. This place is way smaller though, and you can only come with a maximum of a party of 4. I recommend this if you are coming here by yourself or with one other person. And also not in the middle of a heatwave in the summer, like when I came. Seated at the counter, literally a few feet away from the huge pot of cooking noodles and the grill with the pork belly constantly cooking, I was dripping with sweat for my entire meal. I also figured the wait finally wouldn't be too bad since people wouldn't really be in the mood for hot ramen and soup on a 90 degree day, but no such luck - I arrived at 11:30 AM on a Saturday (they open at noon), and there were already 5 people on line ahead of me. But even with all these gripes, I still say it's worth it, as long as you don't have to wait an insanely long time. I got the Totto Miso Ramen, one of their most popular choices, which comes with either pork or chicken along with a cold scoop of ground pork that cooks in the broth as you eat it. I also got the broiled char siu pork side dish, which happened to be excellent as well and pleasantly was not pure fat as this dish tends to be at a lot of places. You can tell this place is legit - aside from a few hipsters and white boy/girl food snobs, the mob lined up outside is almost always entirely Asian, with many of them straight outta Japan. And even better - as I was standing right outside the door waiting for them to open, the entire staff sat together at the counter before opening to all eat their lunch: fresh bowls of ramen they just cooked. That's always a good sign when the staff is digging in their own food that they're about to serve you. To maximize your enjoyment, get here early (before opening) on a cold winter day and you will have an extremely satisfying meal and a fun experience at one of the best authentic ramen joints in NYC.

Even at 5:30 there was a line and wait list for this tiny, packed ramen place. We got in after a wait of 20 minutes. Totto has stools along a noodle counter and a few small tables in the back. We chose to wait an additional 10 minutes for a table, after a fellow Yelper said the counter could be VERY hot if you got seated across from where they heated up the ramen. The place was hot enough.. the door was open and there did not seem to be any AC. No wonder all the staff seem tiny and or lean! Now about the noodles. Both our noodles were perfectly cooked. I had the spicy vegetable ramen, which was a rich flavored broth packed with spinach, sliced zucchini, a few mushrooms, and spiced avocodo. It must be a Japanese thing but all the veggies were raw...I guess they were expected to cook in the hot broth. I'm Chinese and we want our veggies precooked in our soup! Sis had the chicken ramen soup. Like Elizabeth L. she said the abundance of onions detracted from the deliciousness of the broth, especially as the onions were raw. All in all, excellent ramen noodles, okay broth. The noodles can stand on their own with the standard soy dip. Perhaps Totto should consider serving all cold ramen in the summer. Sis almost passed out from heat prostration! The ramen noodles cold would probably rate a 5 star! Yelpers, get there early. When we left at 7 pm, there was this HUGE line outside!

I went on a trip to New York with my best friend two summers ago, and her mom brought us here. I had no clue where we were going except that the restaurant we were headed to had good ramen. When we arrived, I took one look at the mass of people waiting outside and thought "...Great." We waited for about 30-45 minutes (or maybe even an hour) until we got some sort of seating since our party got split up. After waiting for so long, the last thing I would want is nasty food, but thank goodness the ramen here is PERFECT. My idea of "perfect ramen" is when the soup has a lasting flavor, the noodles are not soggy but not too hard - crunchy, and the meat is cooked just right. If you love spicy food like me, then you'll love all the spicy noodles they serve here. Love it.

* Extra spicy ramen - $11 * Miso ramen - $11 The chicken-based broth tasted good on its own, but I didn't like the addition of the spicy sauce or the miso. The spicy sauce was not very spicy at all. * Tuna sashimi - $6.50 The marinade tasted funny and made the tuna unpleasantly chewy. The marinated avocado was interesting. * Kimchi - $3 Regardless of the wait time, I was not that impressed with Totto. Add in the hour long wait on a narrow sidewalk with not much to see or do nearby, and I would not recommend Totto over other ramen joints. The space is extremely cramped and makes you want to get your food and get out ASAP.

Noodles are good, broth was decently spicy. Now that I'm back in the San Francisco cold, I could totally use some Totto. Pass on the pork bun, it's just not as good as that other place. Optimize.

Tasty soup with option of super spicy noodles and delicious pork! Oh, of course, it's cheap (for NY standard)! I dare you to try their EXTRA SPICY noodle on the menu, the only one with seven plus stars of spicy level! The menu is very simple, with maybe 10-15 different ramen choices (mostly pork). The place is the smallest restaurant you can find, probably fits no more than 15 people. I went there on a hot summer day, and ordered their EXTRA SPICY ramen. As a result, I went in sweating, and come out sweating even more (I did sit next to their big boiler). But if it's winter time, I can just imagine how nice and satisfying it would be to go in for a bowl of ramen noodle soup. The downside to this place is the forever long wait (no reservation) and cash only. And when ?you have a bazillion people putting down their names, please pick a unique name for yourself, or you'll find yourself getting over excited alot when they call others before you that share you name.

Totto Ramen is deserving of its title as one of the best ramen joints in NYC. The atmosphere here feels just like the way ramen joints should authentically be: casual, quick, unpretentious, and incredibly fulfilling. Started with the broiled char siu pork. The pork was wonderfully grilled with the aromas of a high-grade charcoal grill. There was a nice ratio of meat to fat, which was marbleized nicely. The presentation was simple with a touch of slightly sweet sauce over a bed of veggies, which served to highlight the quality of the pork slices. Had the much-hyped spicy chicken paitan ramen next. The broth was superb. It was not as rich as a tonkotsu pork bone broth, but then again chicken bone broth is not supposed to resemble that. Instead, it had a umami-filled yet light flavour with a really clean and pure chicken essence that tasted of free-range chicken without any MSG added. The rayu (chili sesame oil) gave the broth a nice kick as a complement, with hints of a Chinese-influenced peppercorn type of spiciness. The noodles were thinner than most I've had, although thinner noodles are a better complement to chicken only broths compared to the richer pork bone broths. Nevertheless, they were cooked as perfectly al dente as they can be. No complaints here. The toppings for the ramen were basic but solid. The egg was perfectly poached to a liquid-y perfection. The nori was unfortunately soaked in the broth which made it lose its crunch. I liked how the green onions were cut nice and long to cut out the richness of the broth. The chicken pieces lacked flavour though and appeared to be simply for producing the broth rather than eaten as a topping. Totto Ramen makes an amazing chicken bone broth ramen with a Chinese spice twist at reasonable prices (basically much cheaper than Ippudo). The two types of ramen are so different that the two are hardly comparable, but I will say that Totto does its specialty better than Ippudo does theirs. Definitely a must try for ramen in NYC despite the waits! - Roger the Pig

The best ramen I've had in my entire life. I love the chefs sooo friendly, funny, I'd be the crazy chef's wife. Sitting at the bar makes it so much more fun. Make sure you try a cheap and flavorful pork bun. I'd wait in the pouring rain for Totto Ramen again. Cuz their spicy ramen??? is a slamdunk TEN!

The only thing we'd change if we were harry potter would be the hour and half Friday night wait. ?Other than that, please don't change a thing. Super nice staff greats you in this tiny step down restaurant. ?The ramen is at your table moments after ordering. ?The broth is what wet dreams are made of if they were made of rich, smooth, perfectly flavored chicken stock. ?They do side dishes good as well. ?We tried a raw tuna over rice that was tasty and inexpensive. ? For the ramen aficianados, this is a reining champion in NYC. Cash only so bring the bank roll.

I had a short trip in NYC and went to this restaurant following a friend's suggestion. All my travel companions could not wait in line for a long time here, so they went to another place for lunch. ?But after eating the Ramen, I felt lucky and happy and threw away all the bad feeling for longtime waiting. I had Totto Spicy Ramen with egg and broiled char siu pork, which was the best noodles I had in the US. Amazing chicken soup and wonderful broiled pork. If I get a chance to go to NYC, I will absolutely try this Ramen again.

Not as memorable as Ippudo, but still impressive. It was our last night in NYC and we had just finished watching Mama Mia on Broadway. ?I wasn't ready to hang my hat on our vacation just yet - I wanted one more taste of NYC. ?Totto Ramen was bookmarked on my Yelp app and it was only 2 blocks away from our theater. ?We hurried to the restaurant, only to find a bunch of people waiting outside of the restaurant. ?Amazing. ?New Yorkers sure like to eat late. ?We were 8th on the waiting list, and I'd say we waited about 45 minutes until we got a table. ? Unfortunately they were already sold out of the Niku-Ramen, which is not on the regular menu but is advertised on the walls. ?I wouldn't have ordered it but the hubby certainly wanted to. ?So he settled for the Totto Spicy Ramen and I ordered the Totto Miso Ramen. ? There is definitely no shortage of flavor in their broths, and their pork is nice and fatty. ?Mine came with a big 'ol scoop of miso, a little too much for my taste, but I'm sure miso die-hards will enjoy it. ? If you're staying in Times Square and love ramen, check these guys out.

Excellent ramen shop! ?Chicken broth base was different but was very good! Definitely have to be careful about timing - hit the wrong time of day and you will wait 1.5 hours to get in. ?Service is quick & attentive. ?Not a place to bring a group - great for a 1-2 person dinner.

We arrived 20 minutes before they even opened and we still missed the first seating! The wait is no joke here and this is really only for true ramen lovers. I wasn't blown away the first time I came, i think waiting the 2 hours just really kills any experience, but I knew I had to come back and I'm so glad I did. If you want spicy, this is the place to go. I had the Spicy Ramen and barely made it out alive. The broth could be a little saltier, but I just like my thigns super salty. Good amount of noodles, but I still ordered extra noodles and split it with my friend. I added the fresh seaweed and that really made the noodles. The torched char siu was amazing and left the meat flavorful and moist. Yes, I will of course be back for more, but it'll have to be an early morning lunch because waiting 2 hours, just isn't my cup of tea.

I go for the extra spicy chicken paitan ramen. It's a very happy bowl of soup. Extra spicy isn't that hot, its actually a huge serving of rayu (which is mildly spicy) packed with black pepper. Sometimes I get Kaedama (extra noodles) but I usually forget and don't leave enough broth accommodate the extra al dente noodles. I eat here at least 2x a week. I only go at an off hour to avoid standing in line. It's also nice to walk by before the shop opens to put your name on the list... if you are in the first 20 people then you know to come back a few minutes before they open at noon. If you are a few spots after #20, come back at 12:20 when the first seating is just finishing up. Going solo makes it much easier to get a seat during lunch. Sitting at the bar is fun, some of the chefs will chat you up if they aren't too busy. At night you can catch the noodle guy singing some terrible pop songs from Z100. It's quite entertaining.

RAMEN AND BROTH IS DIVINE!! Menu shows: $11 TOTTO SPICY RAMEN (2 chili pepper signs) $11 TOTTO EXTRA SPICY RAMEN (9 chili pepper signs) Knowing that I was going to be out for the rest of the day and that public restroom may not exactly be as accessible as I'd like should I need to take care of business, we opted for the spicy ramen instead. The broth tastes like no other ramen dishes I've had before. The flavor was very unique and not watery at all. I was expecting a little bit of kick, but I didn't taste a lick of spice so we asked our waiter if we could take it up a notch. He brought out the chili oil for the extra spicy ramen which we poured into our dishes. It provided just a tad of spiciness, but not a whole lot. Whether you're bold or not, order the extra spicy ramen. The chili oil comes on the side so you have the freedom to add it to taste whereas the spicy ramen comes with the spice mixed in the broth. The place is very small and narrow, but what do you expect in New York? The service was prompt and wonderful. There's usually a long wait list, but if you come during the afternoon hours, the wait isn't too bad. We were seated in less than 10 mins with 5 parties ahead of us. This will be on my list of places to visit during my next trip back to the east coast.

Damn, every time i come here the more and more I like about this place. I got the miso ramen with miso on the side today. The broth was really clean tasting, very natural! The noodles are cooked to perfection! I got the chicken instead of pork, why? because I'm all about #EATINGHEALTHY once a week lol and today was the day. Only complaint i have about this place is that the chicken was rough... Other than that, the broth and the noodles are LEGIT. Oh yeah, I was there at 4pm, so no wait for me SUCKAS! I also sit by the bar by my lonely self, heck half of the people who sits at the bar are also eating by em self. So I do not feel so LOSERISH about that. Now for #CONFESSION My very FIRST time coming here was a failure. I got out of work early so i decided to go to this joint. I usually do not like to eat by myself so when i do, I let the waiter know i have a friend coming. So I would order my food and "her" food as well. And in the middle of the meal, i would say "Darn, she ditched" and get the remaining to go and eat it as lunch the next day. #KNOWHOWTOPLANFORMEALTHENEXTDAY So anyways, I was going to order two bowls of ramen, one for me and one for "her." (Luckily that day i had my tupperware in my bookbag from work if they do not provide take out box, otherwise i would have to eat two bowl of ramen #ALWAYSPREPARED.) However, the waiter told me that they would not seat you until your whole party arrives. It was my first time there and a lot of couples were behind me. I did not want to sit in between any couples and i freaked out.... So what did I do?! I WALKED THE FUCK OUT AND CAME BACK THE NEXT DAY WITH MY GIRLFRIEND!!! Yeah, I DID! #GETMYRAMENONTHENEXTDAY. #LOSTTHEBATTLE #WONTHEWAR

Would come here over Ippudo any day just because the wait is shorter. I recommend getting here early on a weekday and just having an early dinner because I am not sure if ramen is worth waiting hours for. That said, Totto Ramen does have really good ramen! It's really good, really affordable, and a fun place for a ramen craving. Be warned, this place is small, packed, and loud.

Came here to eat on a Thursday night and to my surprise there was actually alot (about 12-14) of people waiting outside. However, that was probably due to the fact the restaurant is pretty small with the ability to seat approximately 25-30. With that said, the wait was around 45 minutes. Although it is a small restaurant, the limited space did have it advantages. I loved the fact they had bar seats closely overlooking the cooks who were mixing the ramen, cooking the meats and stirring the huge bins of broth. The noodle was very flavorful, although I will have to say that it didn't set itself apart from other great noodle shops. With all the hype and positive reviews I was expecting it to really stand out, but to my disappointment it was very similar to some of my favorite noodle restaurants, such as Menkui Tei, near St. Marks Place. I ordered the Totto Miso Ramen Pork Broth, with the addition of Shredded Char Siu Pork and a Seasoned Boiled Egg. The noodle that came with it was wavy, which is the noodle I do like. Some noodles do come with a flat noodle so beware of that. The broth had a bit of spice to it even though it was not stated to be spicy, not that I had an issue with it because I love love love spicyness. The broth was really good, had a nice strong pork taste to it. The noodle was wavy to perfection and the char siu pork was exactly the way I expected, chewy but soft. In summary, I loved the noodle, the intimacy of the restaurant with the bar seat viewing of the cooking action, but ultimately I felt Totto Ramen was like other "good" noodle shops as nothing really stood out for me. However, if you love really good ramen this is still a restaurant you should visit and come to as there probably aren't too many other ramen shops better than this one in NYC.

this place doesnt take reservations, is cash only and the lines here on a weekend are ridiculous!! but the ramen and food are delicious, so i can see why people would continue to wait. ?at one point, i ?almost thought, i should just go eat somewhere else. the space is small and crowded but seemingly authentic. ?foodwise, i loved the miso ramen (with pork). ?the seasoned egg was so delicious i should have ordered an extra. ?terrific flavor and broth. ?the fatty pork and avocado tartare appetizers were also noteworthy.

I came here around 12pm on a weekday, and was on a time crunch because I had to get back to school for class. I asked the door-person how long the wait would be, and he told me 15 minutes. Turned out to be an hour. Ordered the ramen right when I sat down, and got it on my table in about 5 minutes. The quick service (slightly) redeemed the negligent door-person-dude. The ramen was good, although not amazingly-fantastically-perfect like everyone said. I got the Spicy Totto Ramen w/ a poached egg & added extra hot chili. It was super spicy, just how I like it. The broth was dense, I would say. It had a lot of flavor to it. It's definitely one of the better ramen joints I've had, though I'm not sure if it was worth the wait. Perhaps I'd be back again, if I'm dying for ramen and I'm in the neighborhood.

Came here at 11:50am on a Saturday, before it officially opened at 12pm, and already there was a crowd of people waiting outside. Very small place a few steps under ground, but the sign "TOTTO RAMEN" is inviting and will catch your eye. When you get there, go up to the door and sign your name on the paper waiting list. You can walk around the streets if the wait is long, but make sure to get there when they call your name or they will cross it off. This seems obvious, but when it opened the first three names called weren't there. Sucks... The place is very small, and you can't have a preference for seats, either on a booth or a few tables in the back. If you sit on the booth, you see the workers preparing the lamen, cooking the meat, making the buns, which is a plus that you know where your food is coming from. I ordered the Miso ramen with chicken, while my friend ordered the Spicy totto ramen with chicken. The broth was yummy but the noodles were thin but wavy, chewy, and thicktasting (the different ramens have different noodles). I wish the noodles were softer like in the Spicy totto ramen. My server recommended that the pork was tastier with the miso ramen, but trying to be healthy I chose the leaner choice. Chicken came in a few big strips and were alright, but maybe a dry complement to the ramen. Perhaps if I got pork I would have liked it better. The long wait for this restaurant means this place really is great, so I shall return to try the spicy totto ramen (which seems to have more likers) with the pork. I saw that they now have pork buns which look delicious so I will try that next time as well. Overall a great find with great service and likeable theme! Also this small restaurant makes me think I'm back in Korea which I really enjoy:)

Heard about this joint from one of my foodie friends and dropped by for some eatins with my brother around 6:00PM on a Saturday evening. As expected, we waited for an hour, which wasn't half that bad, and then were seated at the bar. Before I even received my food, I was digging this place. ::: Cozy, no frills space and dope japanese hip hop music playing at just the right level in the background ::: The four guy cooks were super down to earth. One of them asked my brother about his antique watch. They're all friendly and throughout the meal, at least one of them was chatting up the customers. And they gave me a booster seat for my bowl! FOOD: I had the Spicy Vegetable Ramen - Konbu seaweed and shiitake mushroom based soup. Topped with seasoned avocado, seasonal vegetables, peppery Yuzu paste, sesame oil, salted kelp and lime. Oh man, I savored the crap out of that meal. Noodles are cooked to perfection. The broth was spiced well, as to not be overbearing. The lime and rayu (spicy sesame oil) were good accents. My brother had the Niku Ramen - Topped with a variety of pork meats, garlic, onion, bean sprouts and scallions. They give you A LOT of meat. You definitely get your money's worth. I had to help my brother finish his own meal. Cash only, but totally worth a go. Gotta stop by this place again.

I came here with some friends and my brother. The wait time was crazy, but in the end, the ramen was pretty good. I had the spicy ramen with pork - and then had more ramen put in my broth. That was awesome. My only complaint is the small portion of pork included (2-pieces) :(. I will be returning to Totto again, but only if I make it before the huge wait time starts.

**cash only** Don't be intimidated by the long line ... 30-45 min max! I was visiting a friend & she lives literally 2 blocks from totto. I'm not a ramen person. Even if I'm at home & I'm starving I don't even eat instant noodles/ramen. I rather eat scramble eggs & white rice. I was in NY for a few days & each time we walk by during lunch & dinner there's always a line. It is a small joint but ppl are in & out. After yelping & my curiousoity got me drooling for this joint. My friends who recently visited NY ?suggested me to check out Momofuku & ippudo. Since I was staying with my friend in the hells kitchen area, I was not in the mood to eat at the touristy place...haha I don't even live in NY but I was getting annoyed of the tourists. I guess the atmosphere I was in made me felt like a NEw Yorker. Not sure if momo or ippudo is popular from all the hype or something my friends never tried, & got them to be a fan. I think it's the hype, & a new taste to their pallets that we don't have back in TX. My friend who was a houstonian now resides in NY told me not to go to momo or ippudo. It wasn't great & overrated. I can see where she was coming from. Ok back to totto. It's feels like a mom & pop joint. I ordered the totto chicken paitan. Omg it was so freaking yummy! The rich flavorful chicken stock with char boiled pork belly. I order a side of japanese Kim chi & the perfect condiment! It was quite spicy but spicy good! Ughh I'm drooling for some tottos right now! My friend ordered the spicy ramen, she was satisfied as well. Just what she wanted with bean sprouts..

OVERRATED. I've realized the restaurants that are truly exceptional worth going to or waiting for are really the ones that are 4.5 stars overall. Didn't wait too long. If you miss your name called you'll have to be put on the waitlist again. My friends and I probalby only waited 30 minutes. Sat at the bar, we all got different kinds of ramen (I got the spicy ramen which was most recommended by 2 of my friends who loved this place) and I didn't even finish my bowl because I just was not impressed. I think the broth could've been more flavorful, though the noodles were cooked perfecty. I think the hype is because NY doesn't have a lot of ramen places. Would not recommend to friends. My other friends who went with me were not impressed either.

The first thing people want to know is: is this better than Ippudo? Yes. My wait was around 30 minutes (if you hate waiting, you should eat with more exciting people!). I ordered the spicy ramen with pork, it was $11, from what I remember and I have to say, the noodles have a stronger texture, which I loved, and the broth was rich and almost creamy? Thicker? It wasn't watery, but it was denser? I'm horrible at describing these things, but it was surprisingly delicious. The meat was savory (though I think Ippudo gives a bit more). I also liked it felt like you walked into a home instead of a restaurant. It wasn't trying to be too modern or too cool or too clubby. It's a nice little restaurant that serves amazing ramen. No gimmicks.

If you like spicy, definitely get the extra spicy ramen. ?It comes on the side and so you can adjust how much you want to put it. ?The fried garlic bits inside the spicy oil is out of this world. ?The broth is also on the greasier side. The miso ramen is also quite good though I enjoyed the extra spicy ramen more. We got the pork bun app - interesting with the tartar mayo sauce but can skip next time. I wish I can ask for less salt but didn't feel comfortable asking... the Sapporo helps with the heat, spiciness and salt.

Oh beloved ramen! Now I have an alternative to Ippudo and not have to travel across the city to get here. Sadly, the wait is just as intense as Ippudo. Now here in Hell's Kitchen, we have great food from all over the world, but it's not so much known for ramen. Well well, let me tell you, Totto is here to change your life for the better. When you decide to come here, please come early because the line really does get out of hand. On a couple occasions, I've waited for over an hour just to get seated. That sucks when your total meal time is just under 30 minutes. To solve that problem, come here 15 minutes before this place opens, and you'll basically just walk right in! At Totto, there are tons of awesome noodles to be devoured. If you want to go with their signature ramen, order the Totto Chicken Paitan Ramen. This is a chicken based bowl of noodles, that offers up a clean meal. If you're looking for something that isn't so heavy, then this one is for you. Instead of chashu, you get pieces of chicken. I've actually liked this ramen on occasion because it's so different than what you usually order at other ramen shops. It's not too salty, but at the same time, it has tons of flavor in the broth. ? If that is not for you and you want something a little heartier, then go with the Totto Spicy Ramen. This is your straight tonkotsu based ramen, with splashes of layu in there to give it a nice little spice. Loaded with your usual ramen goodies, and topped with a couple pieces of chashu, the Spicy Ramen is also damn tasty. Aside from their choices of ramen, there are some sides that you can order as well. I don't really pay attention to them because they aren't really the star of the show. I guess if you're really hungry, you can get a bowl of rice and pork, but why not just help yourself out and just either get extra noodles or the epic Niku Ramen. What's the conclusion? Everything here is amazing, and you can not go wrong. Whether or not you can tough out that hour wait is the ultimate deal breaker for here and Ippudo. Sadly, these places do not take reservations, so the masses are going to have to pile up around the entrance. Even so, this place is so damn good that you have got to make the trek up to Hell's Kitchen and try this baby out!

I love Totto! I come here for lunch all the time and the trick is to put your name down before 11:40. This will ensure that you get seated in the first round. It's a really small space but the service is fast so it's a pretty quick turnaround. I'm a huge fan of spicy food so originally, my favorite ramen was the extra spicy ramen. However, I also love miso so now I've switched to the miso ramen with a side of exteme rayu (spicy sauce)--it's the best of both worlds. I also like getting extra mushrooms in the ramen. The uni over rice is a tasty side but perhaps unnecessary since most people are stuffed after just the ramen. I think if Totto and Ippudo had a ramen-off, it would be a close fight but Ippudo would come out victorious. Although Totto is quite solid, Ippudo has their Hirata buns, which is a huge advantage. Still, you gotta give Totto credit for its location. It's not often you find such a great place in midtown.

The ramen was good and the broth was fantastic but the positives end there. I had to wait 2 hrs to eat here on a Sunday night. The line was insane and we actually went to Merilu, an adjacent pizza joint for a bite first. When we finally got in, we ordered the avo tuna, the pork buns, the paitan ramen and the miso ramen. The pork buns had pork that was really flavorless and the tartar sauce on it was a weird touch. The avo tuna is very salty, contains only two pieces of rather tough tuna and was not really to our liking. Onto the ramen, the chicken paitan had a fantastic broth that was chock full of flavor. It tasted like it had been cooking for days. There is also no MSG, so despite my finishing most of the broth and ordering extra noodles, I did not feel sick and bloated afterwards. The noodles had just the right amount of bounce, a lovely texture. The toppings however consisted of bean sprouts and the aforementioned tasteless pork slices. The gf's miso ramen also had good broth and noodles with the same toppings as mine plus an egg. Overall, the broth and noodles stand out as some of the best I've had in NYC. It is rather unfortunate that the rest of the toppings and side dishes fail to shine in comparison. I can say that despite the strengths of Totto, it is not worth a 2 hr wait for me and as things stand, I will not be coming back regularly. Ippudo is comparable in tastiness but uses too much MSG. I am still waiting to try Minca to see how it compares.

In short, 3.5 stars. ?Great ramen, but the noise, heat, and the WAIT = I can't bring myself to give it a 4. ----- For some reason, I've heard so many NYC-ers rave about this ramen place. ?And it's really good ramen, I'll give you that. ?But a 2-hr-wait good? ?Unfortunately, probably not. ?Perhaps I just don't love ramen enough? THE RAMEN: I'd give this a 4, maybe 4.5. ?The ramen is darn tasty, but very simple--I got the chicken paitan ramen, which is basically just noodles, broth, a square of nori, two small slices of pork, and ton of scallions. ?The broth is wonderful--very flavorful, but still a "bright" flavor. ?Noodles were perfectly done. ?The pork was a little tough, which detracted a bit from the experience, and the scallions were overpowering! ?I really feel that my ramen was missing an egg. ?I had considered adding one, but really? for $1, I could get almost a dozen eggs. ?wth. THE VIBE: It's LOUD. ?It's CROWDED. ?and it's HOT. ?Perhaps this was only because I was sitting by the bar area, right in front of the three giant stockpots...and maybe because it was the beginning of September on the east coast--but it was hot in there, and I didn't even order anything spicy! ?I hate places that are loud and crowded (how am I Taiwanese?!?!) so...eh. ?Very hard to have a conversation in here, so...if you're looking for a sort of "intimate" setting, keep looking, this isn't it. THE WAIT: ?is the main reason why I don't anticipate going back. ?I don't think there's any reason to wait for 2 hours for any sort of food ?(yes, yes, blasphemy, I know...sorry guys, my limit's something like 45 minutes). ?We put our names down, went to Kyotofu and had some dessert, wandered around, and came back...and still had to sit around and wait. ?We eventually split our party of 4 into 2 + 2, just so we didn't have to wait any longer -____- Good ramen, but the noise and super-long wait = I probably won't be back. ?Hey, think of me as one fewer person ahead of you in line.

So we waited like an hour and a half in the cold for some ramen. This place has been compared to Ippudo. So I was a little bit anxious to try it but I don't know if it's worth an hour and a half wait. The place is super small though - literally just the counter area and like 3 tables. Two of the tables are four-tops so don't even think about bringing a large group here. We were a group of three so I feel like we could have fit at either the bar or a table but I feel like the parties of one or two were moving quickly. Many groups that were waiting with us, came and ate and left while we waited. It was a little disheartening but I was determined not to give up and try it at least once. Now I know we need to come right when it opens to be in the first couple waves. ?Anyways, I tried their totto miso ramen. It was either this or the chicken soup base one but I wanted to go with something that had their namesake. Anyways the food came out relatively quickly. At this point, I was just happy to be inside and warm. It did very between too warm (which I'm not complaining too much about) and cold (like the air was on). So that was odd. On to the food, there was a giant ball of miso at the top of bowl of noodles. I had a feeling it would be too much but I mixed it all in there. I wish I would've added part of the miso it to taste since it was a bit salty. But I was starving and just dug in and there wasn't any place to put the extra ramen. Anyways overall I think I liked the broth more here and the noodles are a bit better at Ippudo. Lots of toppings of pork, bean sprouts, half an egg, and veggies. It was delicious but not necessarily worth the wait. They def need to expand or move to a bigger location.

It's more of a 3.5 star. The bad No pork broth. Only chicken. Miso paste not dissolved in the soup. Super long wait with no waiting area. Stand in the street. Pork was slightly burnt leading to a bitter taste. The good Tasty broth. Well cooked noodles. In Los Angeles I think jinya and daikokuya is better. I'm glad I went I didn't hate it. It just gets less stars because I've had better and there were the cons listed above.

I love ramen. Even the cheap stuff. Yes, I realize it barely counts. To be honest though, even I wouldn't wait in line for 2 hours to eat here - not because it's not worth it, but more because I'm extremely impatient. My boyfriend and I have always gone here at really awkward times (between 3 and 4 in the afternoon) and have never waited for more than 5 minutes to be seated. The broth is AMAZING. My boyfriend is a vegetarian and always orders that miso broth. I cheat a bit and get the vegetable ramen with the regular broth. Yes, I know, but it's sooooo good. It's not just the broth - the noodles are chewy, filling and delicious. I wish that they did take out, I'd get it at least once a week. Next time I can dip out of work for an hour at 3, you know where to find me.

Living in the area, I ALWAYS see the hour long line to get into this tiny, 20 person-fitting hot spot. And when I tell my friends where I live, many of them rave about the place and assure me how lucky I am to live so close. Did it live up to the hype....ehh... Look, this place is definitely a good Ramen place. The broth is something to talk about but other than that, I felt a little jipped. The chicken was pretty good but two tiny pieces doesn't cut it when I'm paying over $10 for a bowl. Or maybe throw in some more veggies? One piece of sea weed and some bean sprouts aren't going to cut it for me. I did enjoy the hot oil though, even with such a high tolerance for spicy food. Luckily, I went when it wasn't crowded at all (still had to wait around 10 minutes). I would NEVER wait an hour in line for this ramen: it just isn't special enough.

There is a reason why there is always a wait at Totto Ramen. Seriously, I think just in the last year, the wait time has gone up from 30 mins for 2 to 1 hr for 2 during the weekday dinner rush. I attribute it to all of you out-of-town yelpers invading this small little ramen joint. The wait is almost as bad as Ippudo these days... Noooo!!!! :( Go to the door and write your name on the clipboard. Don't be a first time noobie and stand around looking for a host to write your name down. You have to be aggressive if you want this amazing ramen. ;) Also, you better be there when they call your name... otherwise, no soup for you!!!! The ramen is delicious. Note that Totto uses a Chicken Paitan and not a Tonkotsu broth like most people may be useful. A clearer, sweeter broth compared to the richer pork broth, the broth at Totto is great. Spicy Ramen ($10.75): By adding the spicy sesame oil, it makes a great bowl of ramen even better. The heat is not overwhelmingly spicy, but adds a pleasent zing to the ramen. The noodles are cooked al dente the way I like it and it comes with a fair amount of scallion, char siu pork (2pc), bean sprouts, and nori. 5/5 Miso Ramen ($11.50): When you first get the miso ramen, you might be thinking, "What is this ball of brown stuff on top of my ramen." It is just a scoop of miso and ground pork. Their wavy noodles are also perfectly cooked and it comes with a perfectly cooked hardboiled egg, scallion, bean sprouts, onion and char siu pork. 5/5 Uni ($6): I'm a sucker for Uni. Slightly seared with brulee torch, I appreciate the rich creamy texture of sea urchin. 5/5 My favorite place for ramen in NYC, as they are actually reasonably priced and deliver an excellent Ramen, though the lines make me sad as these day as I can rarely ever go there. Overall, 5/5

Totto is amazing. Totto vs. Ippudo - who comes out on top? You can't compare the two. Totto is good ass home/traditional/country style ramen, and Ippudo is more of a modern/trendy/bold flavored ramen. Get it? They're both great, seriously. The thing I loved most about Totto was sitting at the bar area and chatting with the ramen chefs. Taku is the man. What a G.

Totto Ramen has probably the best bowl of ramen in the city, and even the country for that matter. Hands. down. Every time I go, it is a superb experience, aside from the wait. But hey, you have to expect that, especially when the ramen is that good. Something that makes this place unique is the stringy noodles, very different than the other ramen places. The piece de resistance however, is the broth. Whether you get chicken or pork, it's to die for. My tastebuds are not extremely accustomed to spicy food so I would order the basic ramen they have and then have them give you the spicy stuff on the side to add as needed. You'll come to realize that you'll be adding the spicy sauce as you eat through the bowl. Oh my goodness, I'm getting hungry! They know how to make a good bowl of ramen, and truly a cut above. A must for any New York trip.

I went by myself around 5:30 PM on Friday and waited 40 minutes. ? It was well worth it -- the best ramen I've EVER had! The place is super small so it gets REALLY hot & steamy in there, especially if you sit at the counter... I was seriously sweating. ? I swear I lost a few pounds of water weight by the time I left. ?Dress accordingly :) I ordered the miso ramen with chicken. ?They put a scoop of miso paste mixed with minced pork & it made the broth extremely flavorful. ?The noodles were perfect... everything was amazing except the chicken. ?The chicken was pre-cooked and thrown in at the last minute. ?It was really dry even after sitting in the broth for a while, however I think it's my fault for not going the traditional pork route. ?Next time I will definitely order the miso ramen with pork.

Summary: good chicken ramen, wait involved Came here at 9 PM on a weekday night by myself and waited for about an hour to get a seat at the counter. Service was fast and friendly once I got seated. The focus here is on chicken ramen, which I'd never tried before. The broth was impressively rich, and the char siu pork was great (then again, braised fatty pork is rarely bad). However, I thought the chicken was a bit dry and overcooked, and that the noodles were ok but not great - a little underflavored for my taste. I'm glad I came to try it out and would come again, but I prefer Ippudo, Hide-chan, and some other ramen places more. (Might just be personal stylistic preference.)

The food is fantastic. I've lived in Japan for years and I love good ramen. This is the best ramen I've had in NYC. It's authentic and delicious. I haven't tried any of their spicy ramen, but everything else that I've had has been excellent. The only downside to this place is that it is small and popular. Expect long waits. However, part of the problem is with the customers. Most of them don't seem to realize that ramen is basically Japanese fast food. You eat and leave. Every time I've been there, I'll see people who are done eating, but then sit there chatting. That's not what you do at a ramen place.

I hate waiting, especially if my belly is telling me to feed it. This place was packed. It was 4 in the afternoon; an in-between time of lunch and dinner. And yet I was starving and there was a mass gathering and an expected over an hour wait for a bowl of ramen. Seriously? How good could this place be? Ugh, I took my chances out of curiosity and fear of losing my name slot after signing my name on the wait-list. I was locked in. After all the waiting and debating of leaving, the hostess calls my name. Finally. Inside, the place is tiny, with a bar and two or three tables that fit up to 2-4 people. If you sit at the bar, which I got the chance to, you will get to see all the cooks make your food in front of you. The place itself is casual, low key and loud. The staff are pretty fast and attentive. The menu is very limited with a few choices for broth, sides and additions. I opted for the spicy toto ramen with additions of corn and soft boiled egg. As a side, I chose the seared tuna with avocados. So tasty! The ramen was stringy, not too thin and not too thick and with a good enough chew to it. The broth had a robust flavor to it and some kick, just the way I'd like it. Corn and soft boiled egg just made it more complex with a blend of sweetness from the corn and some texture and custard from the egg. How good was this? Seriously good. And good enough for the hour and twenty three minutes and forty four seconds wait.

I dropped in to check out this Japanese ramen hot spot on one muggy afternoon. Lawrence L and several of my foodie friends had raved about this place so naturally I had to find out where they stand in the line of ramen giants like Santouka and Daikokuya. I was hoping to skip the wait since the humidity was almost unbearable. To my surprise, the wait was still very long as many of the people came with the same idea in mind. Interested diner should first look for the wait list located on the front door upon arrival. They don't have a wait area so the line usually requires one to hangout by the narrow sidewalk with a view of their open kitchen where each bowl of ramen was assembled before they are handed out to the tables. The venue is small, rustic, dark, with dispositions of a perfect ramen hole in the wall. There was a line of people that sat at the counter facing the chefs while others rubbed elbows at the tightly arranged wooden tables on the other side of the wall. I ordered the Totto Spicy Ramen ($10.75) that came with al dente egg noodles, thick and creamy pork broth, spicy sesame oil, thin and long slices of scallions, char siu pork, bean sprouts and nori. I then added a soft-boiled egg ($1) and firm bamboo ($1) for additional flavors and textures. I don't believe ramen should ever cost more than $10 a bowl but it was well worth it. The egg noodles could use more flavor but it embodied an excellent bite and texture. The broth had an excellent baseline of pork flavor with lifts and depths underscored by a rich and striking garlic and black pepper in every sip. ?I loved the addition of bamboo as they were plentiful, firm, fresh and moist. The egg was a bit more well done than expected but it was still superior than those provided at Santouka. Comparatively, the support cast was superior to the likes of Daikokuya and Santouka on the counts of freshness and texture. They gave the broth a nice lift on the flavors but it was a bit too salty towards the end. This became evident when the black pepper flavor emerged from the background and started to dominate the broth at the bottom of the bowl. The broth was not as creamy as Daikokuya and Santouka, but the pork flavor was superior to go along with thick, succulent char siu pork that was clearly the best I have come across. Lastly, I also appreciated the rayu, or chili oil, as the level of spiciness nicely complemented the broth without hijacking it. In light of all the 5-stars qualities, I had to be able to finish the broth in order to consider this place the best of the best. Unfortunately, the strong black pepper flavor at the end had precluded me from completing such mission but all else was truly excellent. Service was friendly, responsive, quick and efficient in light of the persistent crowd in and outside of the restaurant. I have come to terms with the price, and believe this is one of the must visit places for ramen enthusiasts. I would absolutely love to come back again. Cash only.

Totto Ramen is a good, solid ramen house..just nothing extremely out of the ordinary... It's a cute, "underground" ramen hole-in-the-wall with just a few tables and a bar area. The wait can be lengthy due to the limited seating, so put your name on the list and walk around the neighborhood! The ramen broth and meat here are good, but I felt that the noodles were chewy but nothing special - pretty thin noodles, actually. Had the Totto Spicy Ramen - it wasn't overwhelmingly spicy..just a little bit. Great pork buns, too!

Word on the street is that Totto Ramen and Ippudo are the top two ramen places in the city. So after dining at Ippudo a few weeks ago, I simply had to give Totto Ramen a try. By all accounts, though, these two restaurants are not really comparable. Ippudo offers a fine dining experience while Totto Ramen is very bare-boned. Still, Totto Ramen did not even come close to meeting my expectations. The Totto Miso Ramen lists ground pork as its second ingredient, but the amount of ground pork in the bowl was miniscule. I only saw / tasted a few globules after draining my bowl of the broth. The broth itself was pretty good for a chicken broth, but the scallions overpowered the entire dish! They cut the scallions lengthwise into 2"-4" strips so that, if you eat a few with a spoonful of broth and noodles, all you taste is the onion-y flavor. I much prefer scallions cut the short way - there's a reason why everyone else does it that way. The noodles were hearty and al dente. I even ordered extra (kaedama!) after finishing my first bowl. However, within that first bowl, there was a big clump of undercooked noodles! I tried not to focus on the atmosphere (or lack thereof) in this review. But I do have to say that you cannot help but feel rushed at the end of your meal - the space is so small that the waiters are hovering over your shoulder, watching you as you try to finish your Sapporo...

I don't believe in the best ramen ever until I came to this place and it really really really really is THE BEST RAMEN EVER. The soup is so flavorful and the noodles are of the perfect chewiness. Got their super spicy ramen before -don't do that if this is your first time, you want to enjoy the original soup as much as you can. They use a flame torch on their cha-shu which makes it so toastily yummilicious. I like their original the best but can't imagine any of their dishes being bad. I just want to live on that street so I can go in when there's no line. The wait can get ridiculous. They told us ~30 minutes when we put down our name -1.5 hours later was still anxiously waiting to be called. But it's so worth the visit, just try to go earlier at around 5:30 and the wait should be better. I love ramen and this place is The Best. hands down.

Perhaps the line is only long only because the place is so tiny. Cool to sit up at the bar and watch the chefs cook. ?They are friendly, happy guys serving the food up incredibly fast. Had high hopes for this place but the $11 bowl of miso ramen was quite a letdown. ?The broth lacked any real flavor or substance. ?The wavy noodles looked and tasted just like the 25 cent package of ramen noodles in the supermarket. ?The tastiest part was the perfect soft boiled egg. ?The 2 pieces of pork were just about pure fat I couldn't even eat. Tried the broth in the spicy ramen and it was tastier but still nothing at all delicious. ?Tasted too much black pepper. Pork bun was meh. ?Again, very fatty. The best dish was the small bowl of sliced pork with a delicious mayo sauce served over perfect white rice. ?Was pretty delicious except again the pork was much too fatty but not the pure fat slices that were in my ramen. Super fast service. ?Cash only. ?But even without a 40 minute wait, it is certainly another place I would never return to.

Don't get me wrong, I love ramen. But Japanese street food should never warrant an hour and a half wait, even if it's worth it. Totto could easily expand seeing how popular they are, but whatever. Their tiny restaurant works for them, and service is relatively fast so the wait was bearable. Plus they had everything set up (including water) when we were seated, which is how I wish all places would be. As for the food - great! I got the spicy chicken ramen with onsen tamago. The broth was rich yet not fatty, and definitely just the right amount of salt. The egg wasn't perfectly poached but the yolk was still runny, so it was good enough. The noodles of course were perfectly chewy but not too cooked. Best of all, the ramen was only $12 which is a lot better than Ippudo. I'd come here again at a non-peak hour.

Contrary to the online article, this is not the best ramen that I have had in NYC, but it's definitely not bad either. The chicken broth was tasty and not overly salty. Go for the pork option, not the chicken. I ordered the chicken once because I was intrigued by how they could make the chicken taste just as fatty and delicious as the cha shu. The answer --they don't. The chicken tasted dry and made the bowl tasted more like pho than ramen. The spicy ramen with pork though, was very good. You have to embrace the fat. The fatty meat does make it taste extra flavorful. The thin noodles went well with the spicy broth. Tip for the wait: either come here at 11:45 or after 1:15pm for a shorter wait.

This is what I recommend you do if you want to eat at Totto Ramen. Leave your name ?on the waiting list, go for a happy hour at any bar nearby (It's HK. I'm sure you will find one!) and come back like in an hour. Well, this depends on how long the list and how big your party is. This place is really tiny. You need a lot of patient if you want just to stand outside and wait! Totto Extreme Spicy Ramen topped with Extreme Rayu & Spicy Bamboo Shoot ($12.25) is a must-try and so worth the wait.

Best chicken-based ramen soup I've had to date. However, there are entirely waayyyyy too many onion bits in the soup. I'll have to remember next time to tell them I'm allergic or something (I'm not actually lol), because the amount of onions is obscene. I have to pick all of them out and I can't enjoy the soup, because I'm so busy picking all the effing onions out. Granted, I really do hate onions, so this might just be a personal gripe. At the many other ramen places I've tried though, onions were nonexistent in the soup, so not sure what Totto is doing. Okay...moving on. It's about as expensive as other ramen joints ($9 to $11 per bowl). Wait times are kinda insane, given that the restaurant itself is TINY. Do not come in a party greater than 2 or 3. You will be waiting for the rest of eternity. Finally, ventilation is very poor, so expect to sweat your @$$ off in the summer time.

I don't get it. People wait 2 hours for the ramen here, and I just can't see why. We tried coming here a couple times but the wait was always ridiculous. Last time (on a weekend), we put our names down and then went to eat around the corner at Pure Thai Cookhouse. When we came back, our names were still on the list! So we thought, why not, let's just wait and try it (my stomach is able to expand on will, haha). So we waited another 20 mins and were finally seated at the counter. The restaurant is really tiny, so aside from the counter, there are only a few small tables that line the side. ? The main draw of Totto is their Paitan ramen, which basically means the soup base is chicken instead of the usual pork that most other ramen places serve. We tried the original chicken ramen and the miso ramen, and I thought they were both just ok. I was almost tempted to give this place 2 stars because it's so overhyped, but that's not really Totto's fault. The soup was nothing special and just tasted well... chicken-y. LIke chicken noodle soup! I actually thought it was fairly plain. The noodles were decently chewy and flavorful (I guess, considering the soup). ? If i had to actually wait there for the whole 1.5 hours I'd be angry. And hungry, so that's major RAGE/HULK mode. Totto's one of those places I would have as a "backup" for when I'm craving awesome ramen but don't have time to go further; unfortunately, because everyone else loves it so much and I am impatient as hell, I probably won't be back.

I don't know if there's much I can add given there are 1196 reviews already, but I'd say the Spicy Ramen was pretty damn good, even for a snobby long-time ramen connoisseur like me. Only off-putting thing was the service. Dude with the sumo wrestler hair bun had major attitude. Yes, I am well aware of the fact that there is a line out the street on a Sunday afternoon, but you do not need to give me any of your flavor. I came here for hot black chill peppers, not you.

I don't really see what all the fuss is. I have been wanting to come here for a while so today I made the jaunt. Got there at 5 I guess they open at 4 on Sunday so I think I waited about 30. I had the Spicy Totto with pork. The noodles were kind of bland but the were cooked al dente which I like. The pork had good flavor and the broth was peppery and spicy. The portion is smaller than most of the authentic noodle houses that I have been to, but for 10 bucks it's not bad. I have had a lot of ramen in my life, I thought this was better than a lot of them, but not amazing.

I don't like to wait on lines. Airport security lines have me groaning and grumbling, event lines have me wondering why I'm there and waits at restaurants have me thinking where else I should be going. Personal pet peeves were gladly thrown out the window for Totto Ramen. Co-worker suggested we go to a place for ramen on a rainy weekday. I didn't object and quickly tried to guess where exactly in Midtown we'd be trekking to. Heading west and one wrong turn later, we finally landed at our subterranean stop, noticeable for the anxious crowd waiting entry. It's like an Ellis Island for ramen. We braved the forty minute wait, spirits always high, though tempted by the wafting beefy smells from nearby Lucky Burger. Paranoia eventually set in as we eyed up with increasing suspicion the people who were called before us. Where they really on line before us or had some sort of bribe been paid? Was that party somehow a member of a secret society of ramen raiders and knew the signal? Just in the nick of time our counter space was ready. A hole in the wall really does describe Totto. The counter top is the best area to sit or so I deduced as you will have access to the greatest show on earth-- food preparation! Watch the noodles cook for your eating enjoyment and marvel at the efficient operation that churns out bowl after bowl of earthy, slurpy delights. The menu isn't all that large as it's all about the ramen. I opted for the totto spicy ramen, with a choice of either pork or chicken. I obviously went with pork. One could also add in various toppings so I decided to up the protein count by adding in a boiled egg. The spicy kick makes all the difference as I could feel the sensation of broth on my lips, a gentle burn that reminds me of what it is to live, a rising temperature that mimics a racing pulse. Within minutes of ordering, my bowl was ready and the great slurping began. Conversation screeched to a halt as the bowl of wonder required all of my attention. Ramen topped with scallion, char siu pork, bean sprouts and nori greeted my slurping as I relished it all. I just wish there was more pork to enjoy as my bowl had about two pieces in total. (in totto?) Was the bowl of ramen worth the wait? Unequivocally yes. Will I return? Undoubtedly.

Even in the height of a hot NYC summer the lines are still LOOOOONG. But the ramen addicts sacrifice sweating in the sun and then sweating while slurping up ramen goodness. Oiishi!! If you love pork go for the Niku/Mega Ramen. They load it up with a ton of really tender and flavorful pork. So good you want to make love to it. Did I just write that?

Finally! A competitor to ippudo. Off of a recomendation, I got the spicy broth with chicken and pork. My friends got the original and I loved it wayy more. The broth was so flavorful and pork-y, but when you add the spice, it covers it all up. The chicken is definitely not at all delicious either. We came at 6:30 on a weekday and the wait for 5 was less than 30 minutes - part of our lucky run the entire week! Also love that you can watch them prepare everything and torch the pork.. which leads to viewing all the fat drip :( Halfway through our meal the music seemed to get loud, signaling less conversation and faster eating so they could seat the waiting customers. Don't forget the soft boiled egg!

Dining tips for newbies (which I was one) 1. ?Arrive 1.5 hours early and put your name down. ?I waited for 2 hours (from 7:15 PM to 9:15 PM). ?Totto is TINY. We sat at the bar and saw our food being made. ?Thankfully the food came out pretty much immediately after being ordered. ?Sitting at the bar is a good experience because you can see the food being made in front of you and the chefs using a blow torch to crisp up the char siu. ? 2. ?The appetizers are good. ?My friend and I ordered the char siu with rice as well as the Tuna sashimi with avocado. ?Both are super tasty. ?However, apps were a mistake because they were filling and therefore i could not finish my Mega Ramen. 3. ?The Mega ramen is huge and is definitely for the char siu lover (which I am). ?Plentiful meat, a tasty thick broth, and an abundance of veggies. I will definitely be back and I will be a smarter Totto diner.

Totto Ramen is the best ramen place on this side of the world. They make their own ramen (egg noodles and fried so that the noodle has crunch). Their broth is made with chicken bones from their sister kushiyaki restaurant. How could it get any better? Oh, yeah, the roasted juicy pork!

Now I know what all the hype about Totto Ramen is. Considering myself lucky, my boyfriend and I only waited around 30-40 minutes to be seated. A lot better than waiting at Ippudo, it also helps that the staff was so nice and quick with what they do. None of the chit-chat, just order what you want, then you're given the ramen and go ahead and zone out into ramen bliss. The menu is small but the only thing that matters is that the food delivers, and it sure did. The Avo Tuna was delicious, thick and big slices of tuna that was lightly seared over avocado with a citrus tangy sauce. Both of us ordered the Spicy Totto Ramen even though it was 90 degree weather outside. The bowl of ramen was heavenly, there was a kick in the broth but it did not overwhelm the taste. The noodles were cooked al-dente, perfect! The slices of pork had actual fat in it, now that's the right way to serve. A bit charred on the surface which gave it a slight crisp and smokey flavor, absolutely amazing. Tempted to try the extra spicy next time but with the 5+ chili peppers next to it on the menu, I'm starting to wimp out. The Spicy Totto Ramen had only 2 chili peppers next to it... I don't want to be screaming in the bathroom the next morning if I get the extra spicy. Overall, excellent ramen and worth the wait if you have the time. Definitely a place you wouldn't want to pass on if you visit or live in NYC.

Very good ramen and the pork is done to perfection! ?Lean but with a strip of small strip of fat so that it is succulent and melts in your mouth. ?The wait is always long as the establishment only seats 20 or so people. ? If there is one critique about the food, it is that the ramen was pretty salty. ?So be-warned for those that have issues with high sodium!

This is where I sound off on the longstanding rivalry between Ippudo and Totto: Ippudo has good ramen, but is more style than substance. Totto is where you go to eat the best. Ippudo is where you take a group of out-of-towners, Totto is where you go to eat alone (or with one other). I love ramen, all kinds. I've tried Minca, Setagaya, Hide-chan, Momofoku Noodle Bar and Menkui-tei. I find that I prefer the smaller, more authentic-feeling joints like Minca and Totto. Cramped, intimate, where you can watch the chefs prepare your food--that's what I like. If you're not into that, that you'll probably have a more pleasant experience at Momofoku or Ippudo. The wait is a factor, of course. Don't be intimidated by the mobs of people outside, the line will move a lot faster than you think. I waited around 45 minutes on a Monday night during peak hour, but it wasn't terrible. As for the ramen at Totto, the broth is what sealed the deal. It's so rich and flavorful but not too salty (I'm looking at you, Minca). The noodles are also a perfect, firm texture. Proportions are just right, smaller than Minca but larger than Ippudo. Worth the trek and worth the wait if you're craving top-notch ramen.

What you need to know. Anytime before 5:30pm on a weekday, you can get a seat within 10 minutes of writing down your name on the clipboard hanging on the door. After 5:30pm, prepare to wait 30 to 45 min. On the weekends? Forget it, better be there 20 mins before they open. My Spiel... 1) Best come in group of 2. Max group seating is 4. More than 4, they will separate you. 2) I have a very sensitive palate, so when I ordered Miso ramen, I like to have the miso on the side so it would not overpower the broth. 3) The broth is chicken based, very clean but not too flavorful. 4) Meat Lover?... I dont know about that. I would say at least 50% of the meat is pure fat. And the meat is nowhere near as tender as SANTOUKA RAMEN IN MITSUWA, EDGE WATER NJ, but more about that later. 5) Add corn for only $1? Sure at first! But then I noticed it was from a can as I sat looking behind from the bar. Overall, its a pretty decent ramen place. I would not get any of the "extras" other than the egg.

Totto Ramen is easily my oldest Yelp bookmark, but I had avoided a visit due to the stories of two-hour waits. ?But when I was assigned to work just a few blocks away on a Friday - the day I always treat myself to dinner ?- and would be able to get there by 3:15 p.m., I couldn't resist a visit. ?(I am fine with an early dinner). ?The wait was a mere two minutes. ?Verdict? ?Very good, almost worth the hype. Ordered the spicy vegetable ramen, and wanted kikurage mushrooms with it, but was told they were sold out. ?Got bean sprouts and corn instead, along with the kimchee appetizer. The kimchee was the best I have had in a long time - spicy and delicious. ?It's freshly prepared, which is essential, and I recommend ordering it if you visit. The ramen had an excellent assortment of vegetables - avocado, red and yellow peppers, zucchini, mushrooms, and the sides I ordered. ? ?The broth was spicy and the noodles were firm and chewy. ?The tofu was a larger than usual portion, and had a firm consistency. ? The corn was a generous portion, so worth the extra dollar. ?I don't usually go for additional toppings, I figured it was worth it, as I had waited so long to visit. The counter seating is fine - ample room so that you won't knock into a fellow diner. ?Also gives you a view of the food being prepared. Service was polite and helpful. ?Received the kimchee within a few minutes and the ramen about ten minutes after being seated. ?Water was refilled and check was given quickly after being requested. The bathroom is truly pre-kindergarten sized, but it thankfully has an internal shelf to temporarily store your pocketbook, jacket, etc. ?Otherwise, it was fine. Totto Ramen is a place which should be experienced, but try for the off-hours. ?I would wait thirty minutes for a seat here, which is my usual limit. ?Can't think of any restaurant where I would wait two hours, but that it me. ?The counter seats opened fairly quickly, although a large party had to wait for some time. ? And the kimchee is a must!

Way overrated!!! Service and food are just so so, the place is way too small and uncomfortable..I've definitely had better ramen noodles elsewhere. Someone said this place is better than ippudo, I think it's totally the opposite. They are not even comparable. For ramen noodles, definitely check out st. Marks.

Pros: Great broth, great ramen! Love the spicy sesame oil! Cons: Cramped up space Ippudo UNDERwhelmed me and Totto OVERwhelmed me! Be mindful that this place is really small. Fits about 20 people max at a time? I waited almost an hr to get in @ 3:30pm on Sat afternoon. Was the wait all worth it? YES! I ordered their Niku Ramen(Meat lover's ramen, $15) with the spicy sesame oil and the pork bun($3) and my bf got the Extremely spicy ramen ($10? $12?). The bun came out fast so it's a good starter to order to fill u up before the ramen comes out. If you are some serious meat lover, try the NIKU! It's got some serious loads of thick pork slabs and although the slabs may look tough, they are super juicy and tender! To the disgrace of all the meat lovers out there, I had to give up some of the meats to my bf... The portion is HUGE too. I mixed in their so-called extremely spicy sesame oil stuff but to my taste, it was NOT that extreme. Just enough heat to kick ur taste buds but that was about it. Don't be scared and just go for it if you like things spicy. :) The broth is definitelly impressive. Very rich, deep in flavor. It was worth all of the $15 and more. Would I come back here? Oh yes! and I will get the Niku Ramen AGAIN! :)

I was told to try Ippudo but it was just too far away for our schedule. Fortunately, I found that there's a rival called Totto Ramen that was closer to us. We got there at 5pm and we were the first to put our names in (for a table of 4). Soon after people were pouring in to get their names on the list. The two tops were seated before us. We waited for about 30 minutes. When we sat we saw why - there are only 2 tables for 4. There is 1 table for 2. And the rest is bar seating. While we were waiting there were a lot of Japanese speaking employees running around. I was thinking, "oooh, bet this will be authentic" Though, I guess I wouldn't REALLY know because I've never had ramen in Japan. I got the miso ramen, my mom got the vegetable ramen, and the other two in my party got the chicken paitan ramen. The noodles were perfectly al dente. The broth was ok. I think it was a red miso. Can't say it was the best broth I've ever had. The others had a chicken broth, which my mom loved.

This place has become nothing but a mill for money. With customers ravaging to get in and the employees trying to serve as many bowels as possible per hour, this has become a pure factory. I came back here, against better judgment, because I wanted to bring a friend there to try this "hot spot". It was a Saturday night, got there at 6:30, knowing that the wait would be long. Went walking around, got back at 7:45. There were still over 10 groups ?ahead of us then. So we waited outside, with the huge crowd of people. At 8:00, I went back to check since I didn't want to violate their "policy" and it was fine, still there. ?As I was chatting with my friend, I went to check at 8:25 and our names were crossed off. I politely asked the waiter/doorman about it, and he insisted that he called it 4-5 times and even went out to find us (which I doubt, as I was watching his every movement). I calmly explained that we were there, and he asked "Where?". I pointed by the car right in front and he said, "sorry, policy". I said, we ?were there for at least 35 minutes prior (yes, it takes almost 2 hours), and that I even saw him JUST walk around. He pointed at the one line on his clipboard which said, if you aren't there your name is crossed off. I didn't feel like arguing the point, but we were there, just didn't hear him. He refused to budge and called the next group of 2, who eagerly walked in. We left and went to chicken and rice. Now... this is just terrible customer service. Whatever happened to the customer is always right. It's not like I was lying. It was an honest mistake on both sides, but I guess when your restaurant has people who wait 2 hours eagerly and without question, then it just becomes a money mill. So much for that. I'm tempted to call the manager/owner, but I'll probably have as much luck as trying to reason with a nightclub owner.

Best. Ramen. Ever. The food here is superb, and the pricing is just right considering it's in New York. ?The only downside to eating at this restaurant for most people would be having to sign a waiting list, and waiting outside for up to 45 min. ?The place is tiny and can feel cramped, but the food is worth it. ?The ramen I ordered had about 20 pounds of pure meat. ?Oh joy. ?Don't forget the Sapporro on the side, it completes your meal.

It gets busy, so expect a wait -- even during off hours. Solid ramen, good portion sizes, decent prices, and a friendly staff. One of the better ramen joints in the city, though Ippudo is still probably my favorite. I'd go back. They also have their own take on the Momofuku/Ippudo style pork buns. The pork is thinner and they use a tartar sauce with it, which is interesting. Worth a try for $3.

spicy ramen ahi tuna 18 seat house. write your name to get the wait started. chicken broth, spicy oil added. pork pieces charred with blow torch, sashimi-grade seaweed. less heavy than pork based broths, hence a uniquely different flavor. perfect al dente noodles slowly soften as you work through the bowl.

Now that's a bowl of ramen you remember. ?The general principle is that you "always remember your first time with anything" and that you always "remember the best you've ever had" until it is subsequently replaced. ?In this regard, I will certainly remember my first visit here, and until I've had a better bowl of the stuff... the ramen here was honestly the best I've ever had. I've heard (and read) stories about "oh the line is so long..." and truth be told, I mentally prepared myself for a 30-40-60 minute wait. ?Had my Beats on and had my Ramen Line Waiting playlist set to the first song (not really). ?The joint was packed upon my afternoon arrival yesterday, with a crowd of bodies surrounding the entrance. ?I gave a bewildered look, and the host (who was the man BTW) reassured me that it wasn't as bad as it looked; regardless of how bad it looked, I was staying. Five minutes upon signing my name onto the waiting list, I heard my name called. ?I could feel the eyes of those who'd been there 3x,4x,5x as long stare daggers at me... "lucky bastard" or "handsome devil" were the thoughts that were probably plaguing their minds at that point. ?These are the pros (and cons) of going at it solo. Promptly got the spicy ramen upon my seating. ?Tender chunks of pork and flavor soaking hard boiled eggs and noodles, swimming in a sea of flavor was quickly served to me subsequent to my order. ?As soon as it was there... it was gone (in muh belly). If I have any regrets about this place, it's that I ate too fast.

Crazy small place with a crazy large crowd of patrons. There's a reason for that...RAMEN! Serving some of the best bowls around town Totto definitely sits on top of the list among the rest of the restaurants. Decent prices, amazing flavors, good service (albeit sometimes forgetful due to high capacity of customers at peak hours) and great music. Besides their yummy soups and ramen there is also their char siu rice bowl that deserves attention because it's literally delight in a bowl. Tender pork pieces accompanied with a poached egg makes it easier for you to fork over that six bucks. Yes, it's small but hello taste buds! I hate the wait and even had to wait for 30 minutes for a table in the friggin' rain but that only tells you just how delicious this hole in the wall can be! Note: The facial haired fella that calls out the names is rather rude and display signs of aloofness when customers are asking where they are listed waiting to be seated. He didn't bother to answer me when I asked and went about mumbling Japanese to himself. Ho hum, sir, you need to be nicer to your patrons because your attitude make the experience slightly unpleasant because we feel discouraged and not welcomed.

Expecting an hour and a half wait had me wondering if I should scratch off this location for my food crawl, but I had to know. I ordered the miso ramen and at first tasted like chicken soup then I realized I had to mix the miso in that was at the bottom of the bowl... Duh... But even after that I can't say I was wowed by it. The spicy find in a bowl was ok- the cucumbers and the veggie mix helps add a fresh crispness to the tuna and was probably the favorite part of the meal. My friend ordered a ramen that apparently isn't listed in their regular menu, the garlic and ginger was interesting but somehow the flavors didn't translate all that well with the broth... Maybe if the raw edge wasn't there. Oh and fyi when the eggs have a grey film or layer around the yolk, it's been overcooked. I have to believe that I've come on an off day however I don't I will be curious enough to find out

So, it has been approximately 3 hours since I tried Totto and I couldn't wait any longer to write this review that will only contribute to the overflow of outstanding reviews that already exist on this page. WHATEVER. I got the EXTRA SPICY PORK RAMEN which I think was perfect because they give you the spicy sauce on the side so you can add as much as you want. Speaking of the spicy sauce, it is damn good -- they add bits of crunchy garlic with the chili flakes/oil uggghhh delicious. The PORK was fatty and amazing, and you can watch the cooks blowtorch them while you're slurping down your noodles. My bowl was $10.25 and it was filling for me (small Asian girl), but if you have leftover broth you can ask for extra noodles for like $2. CASH ONLY! Also, be ready to wait about 30 min-an hour for your table. I got there right when it opened (noon) on a Monday and there was already a crowd of people waiting outside. I know you're all hearing "IPPUDO, IPPUDO, IPPUDO" when you ask for good ramen places. But really it's all about the Totto.

It is at least 40 minutes wait, that's what I heard. Thanks to yelp's tip, I came alone during lunch time, around 12.20pm and the wait time is only 5 minutes! Yay! Then I was hesitate to order between ?niku ramen (lots of pork) and miso ramen. Due to the heat I can't eat as much, so I ordered miso. Ramen came within 10 minutes, FAST! Check out the broth, no grease floating on top, NICE!! It's because Totto use chicken broth, instead of pork. The broth is so light and I finish the whole bowl, without feeling so guilty. Well, it could be deceiving, after all, it's ramen u know. I did not mix the miso paste with the broth, as it would be too salty for me. But I played around and saw minced pork were mixed in miso paste. Man, no wonder it taste do flavorful!! This place is totally worth to try! If it was not so far from my office, I'll be here twice a week!

When you find a dozen of people lining up for a restaurant thirty minutes before it opens, you know that it's gotta be good. The fiance and I arrived at Totto Ramen around 11:30 AM on a Saturday, just half an hour before it opened its doors at 12 noon. Already, there were names written on the clipboard that was fastened on the door. Luckily, we were part of the first party that was welcomed in - thank goodness! - and were seated towards the back of the restaurant. Almost immediately, we were tended to and put our orders in - I had the miso ramen with pork and the boy had the spicy ramen. We were famished by the time the orders came, and our ramen bowls were definitely worth the wait! (Not to mention, I was fighting a cold that day, so it made it even the more tasty) The broth was savory and FRESH. You definitely can tell a difference between Totto Ramen's ingredients and those of a subpar ramen restaurant. I snuck a taste of Ben's spicy ramen and it had to be one of the best spicy ramens I've ever had. Sorry Ippudo, I think Totto's got you beat.

Definitely great ramen in nyc, but the reasons why I give only 3 stars are; first, it has been always painful to wait in the seating line outside on the street for at least 1 1/2 hour; second, it is in semi-basement with only 5~6 tables and there are still a bunch of people in line outside so that waiters won't let you take your time to enjoy food fully with your friends. I felt they implicitly force us to leave as soon as we finished our dishes. I was much satisfied with their food. Spicy pork ramen with cold Sapporo beer was perfect; the broth was really good, not greasy and not overly spicy. But the service and waiters' attitudes were very disappointing. Will not come back here again.

The Ramen here is legit!

This was my first ramen restaurant experience and I wasn't sure what to expect. Good thing I went in without any expectations because I was still undecided if I had liked it after my meal. I've eaten packaged ramen for pretty much all my life growing up (the good stuff, not the Top Ramen variety, which I'll admit I also find good, but in a different way. Asian household -- you [might] know the deal...). So I removed myself from the whole "why pay $10+ for ramen when I can get perfectly good ramen for around $2" mentality. I know, restaurant ramen is different -- fresh noodles, the broth, etc. Ok. Ordered the spicy ramen. Completely different than packaged ramen. Better? No, just different. They're both good given what they are. Tasty broth, noodles could've been a little more plentiful (I left still mildly hungry), and the char siu was good, but at this point I was still undecided if I had loved it, but it was good.

The purpose of this review is to get awesome ramen into the belly of reader/s Don't be fooled, the ramen's real and it's spectacular! 1. Google-map the directions from your location to Totto Ramen if needed. 2. Arrive on site and write your name legibly on the wait list near the door. 3. If you're lucky, find a free space on the stoop next to Totto, tenants might hate you but your legs won't. 4. Don't wander too far, or you might lose your ?place. 5. Wait the allotted time, (~1-1.5 hrs), pass time with good conversation, picture taking, music, book, or watch a horse eat out of a bucket in front of Lucky Burger. 6. When your name gets called, you have gained access to Totto Ramen. Congrats! 7. Sit down and enjoy the ramen smell, and order your choice of ramen. (I ordered Totto Spicy Ramen w/ pork) 8. Obtain ramen, try awesome broth, and slurp ramen like a ravenous glutton. 9. Enjoy meal, pay for ramen, and tip the ramen masters at Totto. 10. Mission complete. Happy Fooding.

I love ramen and I was totally excited to try out a bowl in NYC. ?My friends told me I should skip Ippudo and try out Totto Ramen and I'm glad I took their advice. ? The place opens at 11 and my friends and I get there at 10:45 and there's already a line of people waiting on a Thursday afternoon, the entire first page was full already. ?My first thought was...DON'T YOU PEOPLE HAVE WORK?! ?An hour later we get seated. I ordered the Niku Ramen which was jam pack full of meat, it's definitely a meat lover's ramen. ?While we're on the meat topic, I watched as a cook took a blow torch to slabs of pork and you could definitely taste it in the meat...I was a fan. ?But I feel the most important part of a bowl of ramen is the noodles and the broth. ?The noodles, i personally thought, were perfect. ?Perfect texture and thickness. ?The broth was really creamy and was packed with garlic flavor. ?It wasn't my favorite broth in the world but it was good. ?5 Minutes, if it lasted that long, my large bowl of ramen was gone. ? I totally dig the atmosphere they have here and, although there could be a decent wait, I'd definitely come back. ?I'll probably grab a different bowl of ramen, just to try something different but I'd recommend the niku ramen to anybody, except vegetarians, vegans and anybody that doesn't eat pork. This isn't my favorite ramen joint but it's definitely top 3.

If you like uni like I do, do yourself a favour and order the uni bowl!! Totally worth the $6.50... it was fresh and creamy and comes with cucumber slices and these little pickles which complements the warm fluffy rice so well. The tuna avo is good too if you like tuna. And of course the ramen.. I like both the spicy and miso ones. After waiting for so damn long, you better stuff yourself with whatever you can eat!!

..:*..:* judging on the 5 stars i gave this place y'all can probably guess wat wrote up there. this place, oh my &*$%ing god. We came here last Saturday afternoon because a friend of ours told us we HAD to go here. Got there, wrote our names on the little clipboard outside the entrance door, and waited. and waited. and waited. Actually compared to other people we probably didn't have to wait that long lol. ?After 50 minutes the lady called for us and shivering we went inside. ?Jesus, I thought Jin Ramen was cramped; this place is smaller than my bedroom lol. ? We sat down at the counter (warms you up like no other), my bf ordered the spicy ramen and after a quick recommendation from the server I decided to go with the extra spicy ramen which had 8.5 peppers next to its name on the menu. ?We ordered 2 bottles of warm sake since we were freezing and within 10 minutes our ramens came. ?The noodles were just simply amazing. I had one bite and I just kinda stupidly smiled across at the guy boiling the noodles in a silent show of gratitude. ?The pork belly was tender and yummy, although my bf was expecting the shredded pork belly (which was a separate addition). ?Neither of us got to try the shredded pork belly but i'm sure it's amazing. ?The spicy sauce came in a separate cup so you can adjust the spiciness on your own accord. Now I'm not one for spicy food (people know me as the japanese chic who can't handle pico de gallo), but for some reason I ended up using the entire cup of spicy sauce and drank almost all of the broth. ?The egg was just the way I liked it, half done half runny. ?Adds the finishing touch to the ramen. All in all, this place made my weekend. ?I will definitely come back here again when I have the patience to wait an hour. ? TIP: While you wait, look at the menu on the wall so you know what you wanna get cause once you go in it's like BAM ORDER BAM FOOD BAM CHECK. WARNING: this place is NOT for sitting down for a long period of time and chatting with friends. there was this group of korean chics who were just sitting at the table after their food was done, chatting and texting on their phones. Don't forget that there are always a shit ton of people outside freezing their asses off. Be considerate and get in, indulge, get out.

As a life long vegetarian, I have always struggled to find purely vegetarian ramen. My friend had been raving about this place for a long time so finally we decided to try it out. Be prepared to wait well over an hour. There is always a long line! As a vegetarian there were only two options I could choose from, one was just a spicier version of the other one, so really it's just one- but I'll take what I can get. We got the spicy vegetarian ramen and it was delicious! My only complaint was they were a bit stingy on the avocado. It's supposed to come with avocado, but we couldn't find any in our entire bowl of ramen! The vegetarian ramen is made from a mushroom soup base, which I really appreciated. I love when restaurants take vegetarians into consideration. Can't complain much about this place, just wish it didn't have such a long wait. To their credit, the food comes out surprisingly fast.

I can see how this place fills up quickly and the wait can get long. It's a very tiny restaurant with a bar area, 1 table for 4 people and 2 tables for 2 people each. When we got there, we wrote our name on the list. We must've come at a good time cause we didn't have to wait long at all. The service was super quick (probably to get the customers in and out as quickly as possible.) The waiters weren't the friendliest but they weren't rude either- indifferent I guess. We had the Spicy ramen and the Miso ramen. The miso ramen was ok, a little bland for my taste. I would recommend the spicy ramen if you go. It had more flavor and tasted better than the miso ramen. If I could give half stars, I probably would've given 3.5 stars since I wasn't too impressed with the Miso ramen, but the spicy ramen was pretty good so I rounded up.

Meh. Not disappointed, but underwhelmed. So many have compared Totto to Ippudo, and I just had to see for myself. Unfortunately, I waited an hour for a meh bowl of ramen. The noodles were good, the broth was good, but my meal wasn't GREAT. It lacked the satisfying oomph (or crack?) you get from Ippudo's ramen. The waiting list is no joke. I got there about ten minutes before opening, and there was already a huge list that took an hour to get through. Never again -- it just wasn't worth it, IMO.

It took me two years to come back here and I won't let that ever happen again because even with a two hour wait... TOTTO RAMEN is my favorite Ramen shop in New York City. No question. Food: SO. FREAKING. DELICIOUS. I'm not even just talking about the ramen, which we all know is amazing. The appetizers are delicious and priced great too. Yaki-uni-don (Sea urchin over rice).... melt in your mouth yummy. Service: Fast and to the point. They take care of you as soon as you walk in the door. Music: Their urban hip hop playlist is really good and it's mixed with some random J-pop so you don't forget this is a Japanese joint. I effing love this place! I'm going to start coming here by myself so I can get in the door faster. By the way, people should stop bringing groups of 3+ in this place for dinner. Go to Ippudo or somewhere else with more space! This restaurant is a hole in the wall, so don't get pissed when your group of six has been waiting outside for the longest time; Totto can accommodate singles and couples much easier.

Totto Ramen lives up to its pegging as principal of New York's Ramen scene. Accompanied with the establishment's tendency to blare jazz standards for the duration of your meal, it's a colonialist juxtaposition that's actually tolerable. The broth alone here has become a golden standard of which to compare other establishments' attempts at similar, soup-based fare. It is the sort you wish your homemade chicken noodle soup would start off with; a translucent, flaxen, liquid, boasting a prevailing chicken liquor. The noodles which mostly sink, but bob from time to time, are gratifyingly chewy in their uncomplicated way. Standard accompaniments are dried seaweed, scallions, garlic, and slices of chicken. The spicy variation comes with a ladleful of chili oil, infusing each bowl with an energetic kick that's bound to clear up those sinuses. In a place where the temperatures are low for most of the year, it is no mystery why many prescribe the precious broth here for the winter chills, or even a broken heart. Sadly, as with any establishment that gets a good write up or two come the crowds and queues of irritability.

1 year later and I am still dreaming of this place... Before Totto Ramen, I always thought ramen was a yummy food item, but I never craved it. That changed after eating at Totto! Ever since then, I have tried so many ramen places in San Diego, trying to find one that matched up to Totto's standards, but I still haven't found one yet! I seriously dream about traveling back to NY just to eat here!

This is what Ramen should be. ?Tried this place out after reading an article where Eric Ripert recommended it. ?I trust his opinion and I'm glad I listened. ?However, I'll never be able to eat them out of a bag ever again without longing for these. Went for a late lunch, around 3 or 4 I think, so there were no lines and getting a table was no issue. ?I can't imagine coming here when it's packed though, super, super small and cramped inside. ?The food is cooked right behind the bar and the whole place smells awesome. ? Decided on the Spicy Ramen, even though it was a warm day, I couldn't pass it up. ?Just the right amount of kick for me. ?Just a little burn without masking the flavors of the dish. ?Of course there are spicier options on their menu for those of you with no tastebuds. ?Delicious broth, awesome noodles, and Man oh Man two big ole chunks of braised pork belly. ?Heaven. ? If you've never had real Ramen, or if you are already a fan of it, check this place out.

I was a regular customer when it's newly opened, the line was around 10-15 mins. now it's ridiculously long. it's a good ramen place, but waiting for an hour just for ramen only(their menu is very limited), well thanks... I'd rather go to Ippudo, at least they have a bar area, the environment are nicer( Ippudo feels like a restaurant where you can talk and enjoy the time, Totto Ramen is somewhere you finish the food and you leave), also there are a lot more other dishes add up ramen that you can choose from.

My dining partner and I waited an hour for a table on a late Saturday afternoon. ?After getting a seat at the ramen bar, we ended up ordering a bowl of ramen, the broiled char siu pork, and pork buns (which weren't on the official menu but were listed on some of the specials posted around the restaurant). ?The pork bun was pretty good but there was too much mayo. ?The broiled char siu pork ended up being almost the same as the pork bun except it had lettuce and rice; again, there was too much mayo. ?The ramen noodles were absolutely delicious. ?The pork was disappointingly dry. ?Overall, the ramen was pretty good, but the most special part was certainly the noodles.

Not really sure what all the hype is about. ?Came here at 4 pm on a Saturday and waited 45 mins for a table. ?Wasn't too hungry to begin with but thought we'd stop by since we were in the neighborhood. ?After we got seated, service was fast. We started w/ the pork buns, which i thought were good. My wife on the other hand, didn't care for all the fat. ? Now on the ramen, which was disappointing for sure. ?Me and the wifey both got spicey ramen, with some extra toppings. ?All you could taste was pepper. ?In fact, it went to the back of my oropharynx every time i took a sip of broth, and made me want to clear my throat. ?Wasn't really appetizing at all. ?Next time, we'll stick w/ ippudo or ?Chuko in prospect heights. ?Definitely not going back here though.

Got here at 5PM on a Tuesday, and must've just beat the rush...only waited 5 minutes, which was spent in hardcore menu deliberation mode on the steps. ?I was really excited as this was my first NYC ramen bowl, and I had heard so much about this place. ?I plan on hitting up the other big guns of noodles (Ippudo, Minca, Noodle Bar, etc.) in an attempt to catch up on this craze and see which reigns king. The place is very reminiscent of St. Marks downtown LES..it's pretty much a dive and its tiny, 14 seats maybe? ?It's clean though, and the waitstaff were very friendly. ?We sat at the bar and watched as two chefs were slinging noodles and blowtorching pork belly. ?They were helpful and fast at their craft, as I saw bowls made to order with stylish precision. ?Hip hop blasted through some dated speakers and hand written signs and notes plastered the walls. ?It really was a stark contrast to the blazing lights and sounds of the Theater district only a few blocks away (in an awesome way). ? We ordered a miso ramen, a reg ramen (both pork)($10 and $12 I believe), extra char siu pork(+$2), and the avo tuna app ($7). ?It comes in a nice big bowl, filled with thinly sliced scallions, a big portion of broth, noodles al dente, two big sheets of nori, and whatever extra toppings you desire. ?They were both delicious and you can easily order "kaedama" for an extra serving of noodles. ?I was really surprised to see that the broth was both chicken and pork based, as to my knowledge, most places use solely pork. ?It was cool to see the Japanese chefs blasting a tray of thin sliced pork belly with a blowtorch, crisping edges and cooking it perfectly. ? As the first stop on my planned ramen noodle tour of Manhattan, I left happy and satisfied. ?I think the hype may have exceeded my taste buds the slightest bit, but in the end I had to remember that hey, it's ramen, dude. ?Definitely worth a visit if you're in the area. ?I'll be back to try the extra spicy and maybe the meat barrage variety next time!

And the quest for the best ramen continues. I'd been looking forward to coming here, and even showed up at opening to beat the crowd. So I'm disappointed to report that I wasn't wow-ed by this place. My mom loved the Spicy Ramen, and upon tasting hers, I was immediately struck with the dreaded menu remorse. I ordered the Chicken Paitan Ramen, figuring it was the most basic so it was probably done perfectly. However, I found the broth to be lacking. All the flavor came from the raw white onions...and plenty of them. There were so many raw bits of onions that it felt so arbitrary, like they were thrown in there as leftovers from something else. I do love the atmosphere. It's very casual, but not for claustrophobics or anyone who gets irritated by the host screaming names over your conversation. I liked sitting up close at the bar and watching them flame torch the pieces of pork, one by one. We sat at the first two barstools up front, in danger of rear crack exposure to the long line of hungry patrons. I guess I would try again.

Honestly, I'm not sure why there's such a long line. I arrived 45 min before they opened, and signed my name on the list. At that time, I was already like the 6th on the list.

My friend and I were the first batch to go in, given that we got there so early, phew. Ramen was decent, but honestly, I'm starting to feel like all the ramen I've had feels the same. WHY?!

I had the spicy tuna don and the spicy totto ramen - both really good. Spicy tuna don was rich and flavorful. Had sesame oil and cucumbers. Very good. Spicy ramen was great. The spicy sauce they used was some chili sesame oil with xo sauce ?? - whatever it was, it was tasty. Noodles and soup were very good. Soup is better than Ippudo just because it wasn't as salty as theirs. Char siu is also better than ippudo but still 2nd fiddle to Minca. I went around 1pm on a Wednesday so 10 minute wait maybe.

Really, there's only a few things better than getting your spank on, and one of them is eating ramen here. The noodles had the perfect texture, cooked perfectly, which absorbed the spicy and consistent broth prepared here. Major thing in the restaurant world: consistency. There's nothing worse than going somewhere you went initially and not getting that same experience, especially in terms of the food and gustatory effects. This place, whether your high on PCP or sober and primed to get in your girl after the meal, brings the flavor every time. The spicy chicken paitan ramen with mushrooms and spicy pork ramen are legit. I give this place 3-stars, mainly because the price is that damn perfect for this type of meal.

Totto Ramen serves up some of the best Ramen i've ever had. ?I'm no ramen expert but I've tried ramen places in SF and in LA and Totto is up there with some of the best. ?I had the Miso with pork, which was AWESOME. ?Miso broth was flavorful but not too salty. ?Pork had a perfect char on the outside, but it melted in my mouth and had a great flavor. ?Noodles were cooked perfectly and all the other garnishes blended well together to create a tasty bowl of ramen. ? The only knock on this place is the wait. ?Because this place is really small, the wait can take awhile. ?I suggest getting there as early as possible. ?They opened at 11am, I got there at about 11:20am and there was still about a 20-30 min wait. ?They also don't take parties larger than 4 because the biggest table they have only fits 4. There's only about 4-6 tables i think, the rest is bar seating. ?Staff was very friendly and nice. ?Service was quick, once you order your food comes out pretty quickly. ?

Ramen isn't my favorite type of noodle soup goodness, but I do crave it once in awhile. Totto Ramen did the trick. Great pork and soup that never tastes bland. Perfect portion and perfectly cooked noodles. My sister highly recommends the pork over rice appetizer thing. It's the same pork you get in the ramen, but has this mayo sauce. Pretty good too. Service is friendly and quick (we came in the afternoon on a Thursday so there was no wait).

wow. this is by far my favorite ramen place in NYC, that says a lot coming from me since ramen is probably the only other staple food in my diet besides rice. Beware of the long wait- and don't try leaving the line, unless you know for sure there are 2190129 people in front of you. Don't make the bad decision of leaving the line after 30 minutes..because you will surely get thrown to the back of the line if you're not there when they call your name. The wait is normally 1-2 hours, so be sure not to come hungry or when its cold out because you will surely freeze/starve. The place is also quite tiny- makes you feel like you're actually in a street stand in Japan- so I don't recommend going with a large party either. So..if you're there for two and you wanna try both- I recommend getting the Spicy Pork Ramen and the Niku Ramen and for appetizers get the avo tuna- melt in your mouth tuna with creamy avocado. The broth is amazing- its like they never wash the pots, and the meat is so fatty and delicious. Instead of Ippudo, go for totto, but remember to bring cash!

This is a brilliant ramen shop. The food is delicious, and the price is right. The reason I'm not giving it 5 stars however, is because this place is literally tiny. You have to sign in at the front so that you can get a seat once your name is called. This place is popular, so you might be waiting anywhere from 20 to 40 mins. And depending on where you're seated, it can often feel cramp. One time I was seated towards the back, and my table was literally two inches away from this couple on a date. It was awkward dining experience. And with the waiters running around, it easily feels like a hectic environment. Still, with the food so delicious, it's hard to find a cheap place like Toto Ramen. I'd say give it a try.

I don't know why you would ever compare Totto to Ippudo. Ippudo is pork, this is chicken. Why is Ippudo such a standard anyway? Whatever, I'll pick my battles for a more worthy cause. The broth here is ridiculously good, in my opinion. The noodles are pretty standard but I prefer the noodles at Setagaya. Too bad about the wait though.

The broth is fabulous (I would not like to be the person who has to stir the cauldron of stock all day, especially in the summer). ?I think the noodles are good - not fabulous.

Here you'll find the holy grail of NYC ramen. The first time I came here and tried the Spicy Ramen it blew me away. They topped it off with a chili oil mix that gave it a nice kick. But tonight was epiphanic. Along with my ramen I ordered a small dish of the Extreme Rayu, a super-spicy version of their hot chili sauce (highly recommended). The ramen is topped of with a couple of pieces of "char siu pork". It's nothing like Cantonese char siu, instead it's more like a grilled pork chop marinated in a tasty soy sauce with the fat perfectly seared and lightly crisp around the edges (whoever the chef is they're so pro). Remember to savor these morsels the moment they arrive because they have to be eaten hot and crispy. Don't do what I did, which was eat one, mix everything in my bowl, then eat the second one and realize that the soup ruined it! The only downside to this place is that it's run like a 3rd world medical clinic. There's about 100 people waiting outside on any given day at any given hour, restlessly pacing the sidewalk, glancing at the entrance every couple of minutes. Anyway you should do plenty of ass-kissing to the surly host. Always stand to attention when he is calling out names on the sign up list. If you do not respond in time, your party's name will go to the very bottom of the list and you'll need to wait another hour to get in. This now applies to singles and couples as well--expect up to a 2 hour wait to get in.

So be prepared to wait an hour and a half to sit and eat your Ramen in less than 20 minutes. Yeah the seats turn over fast, but like seriously, you still wait FOREVER! Don't get me wrong, the Ramen is good, I'll give it 4 stars, but it is still up for debate whether it really is worth the wait.

You know that little yelp review section... yeah, you know... the one that says that you have unfinished reviews? ?Well... This is one of those reviews. ? Going back into the WAY back machine (to July of last year), my friend and I went to Totto Ramen. ?Why? ?In New York, one of the culinary capitols of the United states, I'd have chosen anywhere else, but when you're with two other girls, the guy always gets outnumbered. ? We waited about 35 minutes for a table in a basement of a building. ?Small, quaint, and kind of forces you to have a conversation with the Ramen Chef. ?An excellent and very friendly Ramen Chef I might add. ?He was so nice he offered us his gummy bears as a treat to help cool down our mouths since we both were thinking the stuff was really hot. ?Piping hot actually, always a good sign of any food dispensing venue. ? The one thing that stood out to me the most was the soup. ?The soup was based from chicken stock, not beef or pork, but chicken. ?In all the Ramen places I've been to in LA, San Francisco, San Diego, Hong Kong, and China, this was the only place I've had it with Chicken stock. ? So what does that mean? ?A lighter less oily broth with a different taste. ?I got the Ramen with spicy oil. ?It was very spicy and it was very ramen'ey. ?It was good. ?Not amazing but good. ?If it weren't so dang hot outside, I'd say it "hit the spot" since I was so famished. ? In the end, I'd give it 4 stars. ?But in the end, this is a one book story. ?I'd probably not go back. ?Not because it's not good, but because I dont' live in New York. ?Next time I'm out there, I want to try something different and new. ?Also, while we waited only 35 minutes, we went at an off hour and as soon as we walked out, we clearly saw the line was double the capacity of the restaurant. ? TL:DR - Good but not great. ?Prepare to wait.

HOLY GUAC, i wanted about an hour just to get seated in this hole in the wall japanese ramen place. but you know what, it was absolutely delicious and worth it. standing out in the cold new york wether with a very empty stomach might have added to my deliciousness rating. Anyways, it is cheaper than ippudo and it's slightly different broth, but it's delicious. i love how chewy the noodles are and chashu is nice and fatty. :) the chashu bun is delish as well, you can never go to a ramen place without eating their buns. space is tiny though and their restroom is smaller than harry potter's room under the staircase. it's great though. if i ever visit new york, definitely going back! :)

I really like Totto Ramen and it's probably my favorite or tied with Ramen Dojo in San Mateo (I've tried some popular ramen places in L.A., S.F./Bay Area). Their broth is flavorful and didn't leave me thirsty after I left, which is usually a sign of too much MSG or salt. So that was good. Noodles were decent, not outstanding, however I didn't think they were bad and didn't taste like instant ramen noodles like some other restaurants I've tried. Pork had a nice mix of fat and meat. Not too soft or tough. I'm a big fan of slightly undercooked eggs in my ramen, and the egg at Totto is fully cooked (just fyi). ?One surprise for me is that they had roasted avocado as a topping. As an avocado lover, I tried it and really liked it. Had a slightly salty taste to it and brought a nice flavor to the meal. Oh, and if you like spicy ramen, the hot spice they give to you on the side will do the job. I have a pretty high tolerance for spicy food (I use Sriracha like ketchup) and I was actually able to taste and have a kick from adding the side shot to my bowl. If you like ramen, give Totto a shot. The place itself is very small, so go early if you can to avoid a long wait. I think I counted 20 people are able to dine in at a time. Service was nice and quick. Good serving size as well.

Totto ramen is chicken based rather than pork based like other ramen places. ?I was hesitant at first since I love the pork base so much but I was surprised by how flavorful the chicken broth actually was! ?The noodles are similar to Ippudo, both al dente perfectly cooked. ?The pork is charred which adds a nice smokey flavor but was a little too fatty for me. ?I ordered the extra spicy where they basically give you a little cup of szechuan hot oil with peanuts and garlic that you can add to your noodles. ?It was very spicy but very good! ? I also ordered the yaki uni don, torched uni rice bowl, that was sooo good! ?The uni was perfect, torching it made it slightly smokey, served in a small bowl of rice with pickled salted cucumbers and seaweed. ?It was delicious and unexpected at a ramen place. ?There is always a line outside, but the wait was not too bad on a Tuesday afternoon but it's tiny inside (largest is group of 4) and definitely feels like Tokyo. ?love it!

I've come back here a few times since my initial bowl of ramen, and this is the best place in New York right now for ramen. ?The spicy ramen is the best, but you can't go wrong with any of the options. Worst part about Totto? ?The wait. ?However, it only goes uphill from there.

the wait and (un)friendliness of the host does not outweigh the food. ? just because your place has a line out the door doesn't give you the authority to be mean to the customers who have questions. ?eventually, they might stop coming back.

4 stars for ramen- pretty good, although I think shin ramen made at home is more satisfying. Negative stars for crappy service. ?They sat 5 parties who came after me before me bc I was a party of one...didn't make sense since counter seats were open, yet they filled the counter seats with parties of 4 or 5 who came after me...whatever- I stayed and waited anyway, so I guess they win. ?Had the extra spicy ramen...didn't find it to be spicy enough but it was still good, ?spicy gobo was disappointing, uni rice was pretty good.

My bf and I were in the area and in the mood for Ramen so we decided to try this place. When you arrive make sure you list your name on the clipboard on the door. It's a very small place with not a lot of tables, so the earlier you arrive, the better and if you can, try to avoid this place at peak times. We were here on a random weekday during the early afternoon so didn't have to wait very long. By the time we left there was a crowd of people at the door. I'll emphasize that it's a very small place and the tables are very close to each other. At a table of 2 we were against the wall and the table next to us was literally right on top of us. The guys next to us were talking so loud that I felt they were screaming in my ear. We ordered the Avocado Tuna for starters ($6). I ordered the Miso Ramen ($10.75) and asked for additional toppings of Corn and Bean Sprouts ($1 each extra). My bf ordered the Niku Ramen (meat lovers) ($15). The Tuna was just okay. The Ramen was just okay as well. Flavor wise, I've had better Ramen elsewhere. I don't know if I'll be returning since the city does have a ton of Ramen places.

A tiny but well organized noodle shop with a friendly staff. I got off work a half hour early by myself and arrived at about 5pm. There was already a long queue but luckily I only waited 30 minutes because I was by myself (I got in before 3 parties of 2 that signed up before me hehe). I started off with the avo tuna appetizer, which is torched tuna sashimi with avocado. Normally I don't spend 6 dollars on a few pieces of fish but I just got my paycheck and I'm so glad I indulged because it was delicious. A MUST try. My miso ramen was also quite good. The yolk in the hardboiled egg was the perfect texture and the soup had just the right amount of flavor. Not too salty, not too bland. The pork was cooked perfectly as well. I can see where the hype comes from. Though it was certainly not worth the whole 11-12 bucks, this bowl of ramen was a great experience.

So warm, so comforting, and so delicious. My friends and I arrived at Totto Ramen 15 minutes before opening in order to secure a seat. The place seats less than 20 people, so we knew we had to get there early. By the time 12pm hit and the restaurant opened, the list was already full and people were waiting outside. If one day, people are ever waiting outside of my (hypothetical) restaurant BEFORE it opens, I will be an extremely happy camper. We were greeted by a very friendly Japanese man, who made entertaining conversation with guests as he called them up and directed them to the seats. I loved the lively, cozy ambiance of the room. And now for the food... Totto spicy ramen with pork ($10.25). The broth was comforting, and this restaurant touts NO MSG, which is a huge plus for avoiding the sluggish post-MSG feeling that comes with most soup meals. The noodles were deliciously chewy, with the perfect amount of green onion, seaweed, and bean sprouts laid atop. I could have probably eaten two more bowls of this. I slurped every last drop of my meal. Now for Ippudo vs. Totto...both delicious, both wonderful, both 5 stars in my book, and both very different. Ippudo has more of a fusion taste - I have truly never had anything quite like their Akamaru Modern. However, for me, Totto for a small intimate party when you want a clearer, "cleaner" broth. I love both. Tips: 1) Cash only. 2) Max parties of 4, or they will split you up. 3) Come 15 minutes before opening to get the first seats, or you will have to suffer the infamous wait. 4) They don't do take-out/carry out.

Some of the BEST ramen I've ever had (well, maybe second to Na Ni Wa in Dusseldorf, Germany). This is such a tiny place, so like everyone else is saying - be prepared to wait! I must have gotten really lucky because I didn't have to wait at all. (Come right after they open for lunch, maybe?) I got the Totto Spicy Ramen. Again, I reiterate: SO GOOD. I can tolerate really spicy stuff, and I was sweatin', but I don't regret my choice since it was just so good. Reasonable prices, great ramen, great service - what more can you ask for?!

I came here with two friends on a random Wednesday evening and waited about an hour and fifteen minutes in the cold before hearing out our name called out in a heavy Japanese accent. After careful consideration (and reading a lot of yelp reviews), I chose the Totto Spicy Ramen with extra bamboo shoots. We didn't have to wait long and because we were seated at the bar, we got a front row seat of seeing our ramen being prepared. The ramen was cooked just enough without being too soft and the broth was delicious. The cooks (especially the one with the whiskers) were outgoing and super funny, which made our meal even better. Overall, it was a great meal but be prepared to wait an hour even on a random week night (unless you go by yourself) because the place literally only has 20 seats. Do yourself a favor and don't come with a big group (2 is the easiest size to get seated) because there are only 2 tables that can sit up to 4.

TOTTO RAMEN IS THE ABSOLUTE WORST, MOST OVERRATED RAMEN RESTAURANT IN ALL OF NYC, PERIOD. ?Whoever these so called "food critics" are who are posting their laughable "Five Star" ratings of this place, they should get full frontal lobotomies. ?After freezing outdoors in the dead of winter for over one hour to get in this overcrowded clip joint, the results of the ridiculously stupid wait made me all the more disappointed. ?Let's start with the noodles. ?They were undercooked and had the singularly worse "mouth feel" and horrible taste of soda I've ever experienced in any ramen bar, anywhere. ?The broth was as boring and uninspired as you'd find anywhere. ?The ?tuna appetizer was second-rate, as was just about everything about the entire experience. ?How and why this place ever got the recognition and horrifically long lines that this gip joint has received is utterly beyond my comprehension. ?To be forced to suffer such an interminably long and uncomfortable time, only to experience food this inexplicably bland is an experience I wouldn't wish on my worst enemy... or perhaps I would. ?For a far better bowl of noodles, with a minimal wait, a far friendlier staff, ?much more reasonable prices, a tremendously more extensive menu, AND open 7-day-s a-week, I'd chose "Tabata Ramen" on Ninth Avenue in Hells Kitchen. ?No comparison on any level. ?Compare for yourself, then tell me that I'm lying.

The bf and I enjoyed our meal here, but we agreed that it was just not on the same page as Ippudo. Totto is tiny, seating maybe 12 people. I got there before 6pm on a weekday and put my name down for 2 - luckily I had just beat the crowds and we were able to sit within 20 minutes. We both ordered the Spicy Ramen with extra char siu pork (I also ordered avocado and kikurage mushrooms with mine). For sides, we got Avo Tuna, Char Siu Mayo Don, and Seaweed Salad. The sides came out immediately and were all delicious, albeit a bit on the small side. The ramen was, as the name implies, spicy! The broth wasn't as rich as I'd like, and the noodles didn't have that same chew that I love in the noodles from Ippudo, but the flavor was still very good. The char siu pork was also tougher than I am used to (I enjoy the fattiness of Ippudo's char siu pork), I think simply because it was leaner than usual. Overall, we enjoyed our food here, but we simply prefer Ippudo's richer-tasting ramen to Totto's, as well as the additional elbow room you can get at Ippudo!

What the F is this stupid S? ?I waited an hour and half for this place (cuz the person I went with wanted to try it). ?That is right, an HOUR AND A HALF WAIT! ?For what? ?For tickle me elmos at christmas time? ?No, for fricking ramen. ?Ramen. It's just ramen people. ?Is it honestly worth it to wait that long? ?No. ?There'a ?billion ramen places, and I'm sorry if you disagree cuz you think you're anthony bourdain; but I got news for you, you're not. ?Ramen is never worth this long of a wait. The food IS good though. ?THe guy that calls your name is a douche bag but the other people that work there are friendly, helpful and nice. ?The down side is they nickle and dime you for what normal ramen is supposed to come with (like bamboo shoots) and only give you one sliver of seaweed. ?The Char-su (pork) is excellent but so small in portion. Though the food is good, you can get pretty good ramen most anywhere, especially in a city as cosmopolitan and multicultural as NYC. ?I'll not waste my entire night waitng for soup and noodles, and if I'm going to get ripped off on food I can do so elsewhere. tltr; good food but nickle and dime you and the wait is a waste of your life.

I was very excited to try this place as I'm a big Ramen fan; and the reviews here have been great. I have to say, it wasn't quite the 4-star experience. We got there Monday a little after they opened for business so there was already a wait. You have go down the stairs and sign-in on their clipboard. The restaurant itself is very small so try to come as early as possible or you could face a long wait. Given the lack of space, the food is being prepared right in front of the bar, so in the summer it might be kind of warm if you are seated at the bar. Our Ramen came out very fast, while flavorful but really nothing special IMHO. It was very much a just-eat-to-get-full place. Their serving is smaller than Ippudo but also cheaper. Even though service was great and our food came out quickly, but I won't return to Totto on my own unless someone else wants to.

I finally got to eat here, having patiently waited in line for 45 minutes on a Saturday afternoon and it was worth it. This place has been on my Yelp list for several months, and it is about a 10 minute walk from one of my clients. ?I have tried to eat here during lunch, but after a dozen attempts could never get myself to wait in a line with about an hour wait. ?Usually we would go to Manchenko Tei. ? This past Saturday I had met a friend in the area and made it a point to go in. ?My friend was intimidated by this line and offered plenty of other alternatives. ?Either way we got a seat, and luckily it was a beautiful spring day so standing outside was not a burden. Food: (5/5) Dare I say it! ?I think the ramen here is as good as Ippudo. ?The only reason that Ippudo still wins as best ramen in NYC is the pork belly buns, but otherwise the ramen here is just as good. ?We ordered the Totto Spicy Ramen, and we would again. Venue: (3/5) It's small, maybe 15-20 seats in total. ?Nothing fancy but it's a ramen place. ?

I am a ramen lover so when I visited New York I yelped and had couple places in mind that I NEED to go try. I was lucky that Totto ramen was in a walking distance from my hotel. I was there around 3ish almost 4pm so i didnt have to wait, but about 10mins later there was a line already. I ordered the spicy ramen with onsen tamago. It costs about $13ish with taxes, which it definitely not that bad compared to Ippudo. The noodles and the broth were perfect together. The chashu pork was soft and i felt like it would melt in my mouth. I had really good experience and will definitely go back to try new thing when i go back to NY.

Problem: Obscenely long lines, Ramen too good to pass up. Strategy: Arrive the day after National Fatty Day (aka Thanksgiving) 30 minutes prior to opening and snag an early spot on the wait list (2nd to be exact). Go grab a cup of coffee to shake off post-Thanksgiving sluggishness. Then, return to Totto Ramen just in time to hear your name get called. Walk past the waiting crowd with a smug smile and proceed to stuff your face with the best ramen you'll ever eat. OK yes, this is a tiny itty bitty place with enough seats for maybe 20 people, but if you can, sit at the bar and watch the ramen master get to work! I tried the spicy ramen, which was flavorful with just enough kick to get the blood pumping. Also, for so much flavor, the ramen was relatively low on grease, which is good because excessive grease + pumping heart = heart attack. However, their pork belly was to die for, so maybe the low grease makes no difference, but it's still worth it. I love that they cook thick slices of pork belly with a blow torch so that it's cooked all the way through but the fatty parts are just melty enough. On top of the fantastic ramen, service here is polite. I was pleasantly surprised that they weren't breathing down my neck to hurry up with the massive line outside. Somehow good service makes everyone a little bit happier and makes the ramen a little tastier. Well played Totto Ramen. Well played.

3.5 solid stars for service and quickness. My east coast trip was mainly focused on food and meeting up with friends. I was so eager to try this place, but was quite disappointed. The ramen was good, but not great. We arrived at 11:45am, and the place opens at 12pm on Saturdays. My friend and I put down our names, and came back at 12 when it was opened. Fortunately, we were the last people to go in, before the next wave of people. The venue is fairly small--probably seats about 17-20ppl. Tip: If you're coming on Saturdays: 1) Arrive around 11:30am to write your name on the clipboard. 2) Walk around the area, and come back around 11:55am. The food comes out rather quickly, so you will probably be in and out within 45 minutes. We were trying to be considerate by not lounging around since there were patrons anxiously waiting to be seated. We both ordered the Totto Spicy Ramen since we were on a food adventure and had to save room for desserts!

Mmm.. It's such good comfort food on a cold or rainy day. As everyone says.. the line is cray-z. Just go to a bar next door to kill about an hour or so, but be careful because if you're not there when they call you - bottom of the list you go. Don't let the Totto Extreme Spicy Ramen with the gazillion spicy peppers scare you. That one comes with the spice on the side so you can put in as little or as much as you'd like. It's actually a good option if the regular spicy one is too spicy for you! My go to here though is the Spicy Vegetable Ramen with a side of Char Siu Pork in it please! They put sooo much veggies in it - tons of lettuce, avocado, mushrooms, a lot more that I can't remember - and a lime to top it off. 100000x better than just the Spicy Pork Ramen. The Spicy Tuna Don is damn good too. Made the mistake of getting the sliced tuna app before and it was mehh. Something about the noodles here are soo good. Chewy. And the broth has a clean taste to it. Save your broth when you're done - for $2.50 you get an extra serving of noodles. Come if you have patience, like good food and don't care too much about ambiance. Don't expect fancy schmancy like Ippudo or an extensive menu like them. Writing reviews makes me hungraay :/

This place is Ramen heaven. This was how my friends and I had our first experience. We were driving down 52nd street to get into the city and out of the windows, we saw a huge line of people waiting on the sidewalk. Lines are intriguing, especially in NYC. It means good food. And true enough, when we saw Totto Ramen as the shop name, another famous ramen shop we have yet to try, we quickly found parking. The line was long. They're open for lunch at 12p.m. We got there at 12:30 and had to wait an hour. It was worth it. So wait it out! I had the spicy miso ramen. Boy, it was way more spicy than I anticipated and I didn't even order the one with the 9 chili peppers in front of it. Since I like spicy food, it was perfect. Totto vs. Ippudo Totto is very small, way smaller than Ippudo, so seating is even more limited. Also, Totto is not a restaurant like Ippudo. It is but a small ramen shop. The price is cheaper. The quality: hm, it's different and hard to compare. They're both good. I like the spicy kick and the pork flavor of Totto better but Ippudo has the pork buns, more choices, and it's more comfortable seating and better atmosphere for a date. Who am I kidding, I'd be so happy to have my date at either place. Now that I've added another must-have food to my list for NYC, I'm afraid I won't be able to accommodate all these places in future visits. Sigh, I wish I live in NYC.

How good can a bowl of Ramen really be? That was what ran through my mind as we stood outside the spot waiting nearly 45 minutes along with quite a few other people. While we waited a group of guys walked by and one of them was telling his friends that the Ramen at this place was among the best he has ever had. He even asked us how long we were waiting and when we told him he said "See! thats how good it is!" (jury is out on if he was drunk or not). When we finally got seated inside I have to say I liked the atmosphere of the place. It was kinda like a tiny lil dive spot, a little basement level hole in the wall where everyone was kinda packed in but all were in good spirits and just enjoying a good meal. The menu selection isn't huge but thats irrelevant because the only thing you have to care about is the Ramen...the Ramen....the Ramen! I ordered the Spicy Totto Ramen with chicken and really didn't know what to expect since my prior experience with Ramen was the stuff you buy from vending machines that came in a styrofoam cup. Let me say you are never prepared for just how good the whole things is. The noodles were cooked perfectly, the broth is unbelievably good and everything else just ties it all together so nicely. I just could not get enough, I didn't put my spoon down until it was all gone. If you like food (yes I'm going that far) in general then you owe it to yourself to have a bowl of Ramen here at least once in your life :)

Is there such a thing as Totto overdose? When I work in the area, I lunch here. My company provides free lunch, but I come here. I've lunched here three times this week, consecutively, each time ordering something different, but always adding Extreme Rayu (their special, spicy sesame oil). They know my face. They know my name. They know my Rayu! Commentary: Niku Ramen: I thought I wanted more meat. I do want more meat! This maybe was a bit more than I could handle. He warned me this was a huge bowl. I told him to bring it. I loved every chunk and slice of fatty pork, but then I couldn't finish the ramen. I was ashamed. He told me it was okay, "It's not a competition." Miso Ramen: Loved every bowl of ramen here, but this might be my fave. The miso is top notch and served in a scoop on top of the bowl. You can really taste the awesomeness of the miso as you blend it into that already bangin' chicken broth. Spicy Vegetable Ramen: As a carnivore and an admirer of animal fat, I thought I would miss the pork. I didn't miss the pork. This bowl held its own with a smooth shitake mushroom broth topped with loads of veggies! The noodles were different and were the perfect match for this broth! Totto Coma!

Totto Spicy Ramen. Go. Get. Some. Now. I am a ramen fanatic. ?I will go to any ramen spot that Yelp says is at least 4 stars and thankfully, I came here. ?I will go out on a limb and say that I even like this place better than Ippudo - keeping in mind the fact that Ippudo clearly wins with a wider menu including a better selection of appies and beer. ?I mean, pork buns and shisito peppers Totto cannot provide but this broth...the Paitan broth. ?It's light, it's tasty, it's got depth. . . .umami rings in your mouth. ?Who would have thought that a chicken-based broth could appease me as much as pork bones. ?And, the "spicy" - it is the perfect amount of added spice. ?It doesn't overpower the true flavor of the broth; it is just perfect enhancement. ?Surpasses my sip sip sip until you realize oh my goodness I drank all the darn broth in my bowl test. ?Mmmmm. ps. pork lovers - there pork belly is equally delicious. ?The ramen chefs actually finish them off with blowtorches, in case you were wondering how they get that char of beauty.

Lost a star for the long wait, but that is just a testament to how good and worth it this place is. ?The ambiance itself has an awesome busy energy , and on a cold November Saturday night, the food was fantastic, I got the vegetarian option. ?The broth was comforting and the noodles were perfect, I also liked that the vegetarian option included avocado. ?In addition to quality well priced food, the entire dinning experience is some thing unique and worth checking out.

I've been here a few times, so it's about time to give them some props for being consistent and being the best ramen joint in NYC. Each time I come here, I keep being impressed by their ability to put out good ramen with so much demand. They don't err on their consistency and the noodles are always the perfect al dente while their broth is always done to perfection. That means they have the two most important aspects of ramen down. The pork they put in their ramen is also done very well, although I wish there was more. The only negative is that they always put too much scallions, and as much as I love scallions (and I really do), there comes a point where there's just too much. Haha. Remember, come here with CASH. And definitely not on a first date in the winter unless you want her to freeze. The wait here alone can have her be tired of you by the time you eat your ramen.

This place is so crowded!! It is also very good, so I'm not surprised. ?It's a small ramen shop with a bar in front of the ramen chefs and a few tables. ?it is not good for groups.. you're better off coming here on your own so you can get seated relatively soon. ? They get 4 stars because I couldn't eat all my ramen, and I wasn't allowed to take it to go because they did not have take out containers. ?I didnt want to waste the ramen, but lastly it went into the trash.... sucks!

I don't even ?usually like ramen to begin with, but I absolutely LOVE Totto Ramen! Unlike other places, which are overhyped for decent ramen (cough, Ippudo, cough) this place is definitely worth the wait. The cost is also much more reasonable ($10 vs the $15 at Ippudo). I usually get the miso ramen. The ramen noodles are just the perfect chewy consistency, the pork is fatty but taaaaasty! I also like the tuna and pork appetizers. They use a handtorch to fire up the pork on the spot! BEST RAMEN IN THE CITY!!

Waiting time: 1 hour Soup: very different from pork bone brooth, at some level the sweetness of chicken maybe better than pork. Is less thick, less heavy and yet it content is still fullof flavor. Noodle: both me and gf didnt like the noodle, is too hard and it kinda ruin the whole ramen experience. We both love the spicy tuna don.

Never had ramen like this before and was very pleased with what my belly discovered! ?Despite the long wait (~1hr), the food came quickly and contrary to how small the bowl looks, like a clown car, the bowl seemed never ending. I had the spicy totto ramen which although was tasty was nowhere close to spicy. Overall the experience was super fun. Only cons were the wait and the creepy, staring busboys. But I guess you gotta creep in order to get tables moving...

Why this place gets at least 4stars: -Solid ramen - smooth and springy, perfect for slurping -Pleasantly surprised by the richness of the chicken broth, bravo -Miso ramen soup FTW Why this place gets no more than 4 stars: -It's a long wait - we waited 45 minutes during lunchtime on a weekend. -$11/15 for ramen is pretty steep -They put much way too much garlic in the mega (or niku) ramen -Yes, it's a hole in the wall place and that adds to the "classic Japanese ramen bar" feel, but the tables/seats are quite small and the bathroom is "converted storage closet" small

I came here around 12:30pm on a Wednesday. Since it was peak lunch hour, the place was crazy busy. But fortunately, we waited for no more than 20 minutes. Three of us sat at the counter so we got to see the three chefs making our ramen. Being the friend of a friend of a person that works there won us a complimentary dish of bean sprouts, bamboo, mushrooms, egg, pork and tofu. They were lightly flavored but they perfectly complimented the pork ramen soup that was on the saltier side. The soup infused ramen was so creamy, and the green onion punch on top balanced out the saltier soup. And the char siu pork they're known for. Absolutely HEAVENLY. It's slightly grilled so that you can taste the smokiness. Sadly, there was only two pieces in my ramen. Such a tease. So I'd say the $2 for extra pork would be worthwhile the next time around. The waiters here are so nice and smiley, maybe they could tell I was a visitor foodie. It might have been the big smile and the clasping of hands that gave away my excitement of good ramen.

First, a disclaimer: My breakdown of ramen places is considerably different than how I would evaluate any other restaurant, and is as follows: - 70% Broth - 15% Other Ramen Components - 15% Other Stuff (Price, Environment, Service, etc.) Totto gets a 80% from me. In actuality, it's probably closer to 85%, but I'm rather limited by the integer-based star rating that Yelp allows me. I met my friend here Thursday night for a quick dinner after work. Although I don't find myself heading north of 34th Street since I've moved downtown, this was one place that is definitely worth the trek up. On 52nd and 9th Avenue, Totto is fairly easy to get to via subway. Although the entrance is small and easily passable, you can spot the location nearly a block away thanks to the perpetual line of people waiting outside. At a little after 7PM, the line was only about 6 or 7 people long; as a warning though: after I left around 8PM, it had nearly doubled. So, plan your dinner accordingly. There are a smattering of tables and bar seats, and pretty much only one narrow strip of floor for both servers and clients to walk on. Needless to say, it's crammed and it's bound to get warm, especially during the summer. Once you've put your name on the waitlist and finally get to the front of the line, you'll be seated depending on your party size (smaller is better) and the seating availability. My friend and I opted for a table, but if you do get seated by the bar, you can actually see the chefs making your ramen. The menu is small and straightforward - you can opt for some starters/appetizers like pork buns or fried rice, but the main attraction is the ramen, of course. While my friend decided on the regular Chicken Paitan Ramen, I wanted to try their version of the Spicy Ramen. (As a heads up, they also do offer an Extra Spicy Ramen, but I would caution the likelihood that the pepper would completely overpower the nuances of flavor in the broth.) Our orders were taken quickly, cups of ice water were brought to our table, and we waited in anticipation. I don't know if there's anything quite as glorious as a steaming, aromatic bowl of ramen, especially on a chilly day. Our bowls were delivered promptly, and they were nearly picture-perfect: three slices of pork belly with fresh scallions and bean sprouts, neatly placed over a rich, opaque broth and finished off with a sheet of nori. The broth was mind-blowing; despite being chicken-based, it almost bordered on being creamy, but not as cloying as a pork-based broth. You could tell it had been simmered for a substantial amount of time, and the seasonings were pretty much spot-on. The generous spoonful (or two) of chili oil made it even more delicious, though it did change the flavor profile of the broth substantially more than expected. The toppings were adequate, the bean sprouts fresh and crunchy, and the pork belly fatty and nicely seared. The noodles, on the other hand, could have used some improvement; they didn't quite have the "chew" I was hoping for and too closely resembled the ramen noodles you'd buy in bulk back in college. Service was okay as well; I would have liked my water to be refilled at least once, but we were treated courteously and were in and out in half an hour. So would I come back? Yes, but just for that broth.

I've had the pleasure of coming here a bunch of times. ?Located in Midtown, you may have passed Totto Ramen and saw a bunch of people waiting outside, thinking "why is everyone waiting at this very small spot". ?Do not let the small space deceive you, this place serves some delicious ramen! Before you decide to go in here, be mindful that this place is CASH ONLY. The main thing you have to worry about here is the WAIT, as the wait here rivals a place like Ippudo. ?As you can imagine being a small place, there are a lack of seats, as there are a couple tables and a bunch of bar seats. ?Once you get here, there is a hanging list at the entrance with a pen; write you name down and party number on this. ?(No calling ahead allowed) Do NOT come in with a party more than 4 people, as this place does not have big tables to seat more than 4. ?As a tip, it is best to go with just 2 people, since if you have four, you HAVE to wait for a table and it will take much longer to sit. ? So if you decide to come with a good sized group, expect to be separated. ?Also, try to have a good idea on when you expect to be seated, so if you decide to leave for a bit, make sure you come back at a good time because if they call your name and you are NOT around, they WILL cross you name off and you have to sign up on the list all over again. Once you finally get in though, be prepared to order and eat some good ramen. ?As for appetizers, The Spicy Tuna Don is a good starter, as it is pretty much spicy tuna served over rice; simple yet good. ?In addition, the Char Siu Maya Don is also a good treat, as its their char siu pork with mayo sauce over rice. To be honeset though, if you have a small stomach, just go for the ramen, as the ramen can be very filling and you do NOT have an option to take food to-go here. ?For drinks, they have normal drinks and soda with option to get some beer and, sake, and even some soju. As for the ramen, I've had the following from their menu: Totto Spicy Ramen - Straight ramen noodles with Char siu pork, scallions, bean sprouds, and nori with a spicy kick. Totto Chicken Paitan Ramen - Straight ramen noodles in a chicken-based broth with char siu pork, scallion, onions and nori. Niku Ramen - Ramen with TONS of pork meat! with onions, bean sprouts, and scallions. ? Totto Miso Ramen - Wavy ramen noodles in a miso broth with char siu pork, hardboiled egg, scallion, and bean sprouts. Being a spicy fan myself, I liked the Totto Spicy Ramen the most, it has a good kick of spiciness. ?You are also able to get an extra spicy version. ?Not as many places have an option for ramen in a chicken broth, and I was also a fan of the chicken paitan ramen. ?The chicken taste with pork added a good combination of flavor. ?They also have vegetable ramen for you vegetarians out there and cold ramen if you want to change it up. As for the extra toppings they offer, I usually like getting extra Char siu pork, bamboo shoots, and a boiled egg. ?You cannot go wrong with a boiled egg in your ramen! ?I am also a fan of char siu pork so I usually tend to order extra pork when I go to a ramen restaurant. ?If you sit by the bar area, you'll see they use a blowtorch to cook the pork, which adds a good little visual while you are casually chatting and eating your meal. Even though this place is very small, the turn around is pretty fast. ?Try to know what you want to order when you sit down since you have been waiting for so long already. ?Once you order, your ramen should come within just 5-10 minutes max. ?The service is quick and to the point. ?With it being a small place, it is easy to flag down a server if you have to for a drink refill or kaedama (extra order of noodles, and yes you can do that here!). ? Solid tasting ramen with a long wait for it, but hey, at least it's in NYC, there are tons of things you can do around the city while you wait, just don't miss your spot on line when they call you!

We waited an hour for a table, and I can't really say it was totally worth it. It was good,but not great. Portions are average, prices are average, and the broth was average. The allegedly super spicy order was maybe level 6 out of 10. We were seated in the back because it was one of only two four-tops in this closet-sized restaurant, and it was unpleasant to feel as though we were in the kitchen. There was also a drip from the ceiling and they had to put a bucket right next to me. This was also the worst bathroom in NY; I would have slipped and fallen the instant I stepped in, but the walls caught me because it's literally the size of a solitary confinement holding cell.

I went here in a group of three on a Monday early evening, at about 6:00pm. ?No line! ?Yes! ?After hearing about the popularity of this place, it was really nice not having to wait. We were seated at a table for four. ?The place is very small and intimate, but it felt like we had enough space. ?I opted for the chicken ramen with curly noodles. ?I added an egg and bean sprouts. ?A friend recommended the curly noodles, which are more al dente. ?My friend got the same, and my bf got the spicy ramen. ?It took a little while to get our food... and I don't think all three of us got it at the same time. The first thing I noticed, was that I did not have bean sprouts in my ramen :-( ?I thought, oh well, I'll save a $1 and make sure they don't put it on my bill. ?After that small setback, I dug into my ramen, and it was definitely delicious! ?The broth was very tasty and flavorful, and the noodles were perfectly al dente. ?The chicken was just okay. ?It was white meat, which I guess is good for health reasons, but of course not as tender as dark meat would be. ?I tried my bf's broth, and the "spicy ramen" had a nice, peppery flavor. ?Different from my standard LA Daikokuya experience, but it was a pleasant change. ?The portion wasn't huge, which isn't a complaint, since I was a tourist and not taking home leftovers. ?But at other ramen places in California, I'm usually able to squeeze two meals out of a ramen order for the same price. When we got the bill, they charged me for the bean sprouts, but I told them about the mistake, and they kindly fixed it. ?The bathrooms weren't too clean, which always affects my review a little more than it should. ?But Totto Ramen deserves a solid four stars for their food. ?I'd like to try other ramen places in New York for comparison, so I'd probably not return here on my next New York trip. ?Too many places to try!

Not worth the wait or the hype. I waited for 45 minutes on a saturday at 4:30pm. Finally got a seat and ordered the miso ramen with extra pork. The pork was just all fat and i've had better at ?Minca or Ramen Takumi. The soup was truely good but that was it. The noodles seemed undercooked and not as good as Ippudo. Would i go back again? probably not.

Four stars for the thick chicken soup. I enjoy the depth of flavor in the broth but miss the complexity of ippudo's. By then end though there was just too much salt even with an extra side of corn. I found the pork to be just okay -- it could have been more tender and fattier with less salt. I wish I ordered the chicken with the chicken broth instead. Moreover, the noodles were undercooked when I was first served the bowl but after 2 or 3 minutes became edible. I liked how it was just the right amount of noodle. The meat lover's ramen had nicely cooked noodles but an overwhelming amount of garlic which completely over powered the broth, and thereby us, for the rest of the day. With the added comments about their pork, I would not recommend the meat lover.

Another place that I find to be over-hyped. I have eaten at numerous Japanese and ramen restaurants and I really do not understand the hype. The ramen are ordinary. The food are nothing special. Its ok and edible, not bad or good. The one of the reasons for the one star is the extremely long wait. I got there at 4:50pm when the store was suppose to open at 5pm and waited until 5:50pm to be seated. Another reason is that this place is not the cleanest and got a "C" health rating. But the main reason for the one star is the below par service. Our waited on 2/12/2012 Sunday at 5:50pm was this Asian guy with long bleached and wavy hair who did not attend to our table well so we gave him a $7 tip for a $65 bill. He had the nerve to come back and say "$7 is not enough, you need to give at least 15%". First of all tips are called tips because they are based on the service and it is NOT something you have to give. If you feel like tip should be enforced, then just increase the price of your menu and give the waiters an extra pay. *(FYI for everyone, even if a place charges you an automatic 15% or whatever tip, you are NOT required by law to pay for it. It's still optional, hence the word "tip")* Second his service was below par. I could honestly care less about paying an extra $5 but it's the principle. I just hate it when places feel that tip is something that they deserve and not something they earned. So if you are a worker there reading this, please let this guy know what he did was not right. And if he wants to earn the "15%" then easy, give better service. But to all those that have to go here and wait in line for 1-2 hours, then DO NOT get the pork chunks or Niku ramen, its gross and full of fat. Just get the spicy ramen and the pork don. Go with 1-2 people, you are seated A LOT faster than 3-4 because there are only 2 tables seating 3-4 people. This place is cash only. Overall DO NOT come here and wait in-line for ramen that taste just the same as anywhere else. But if you have to come here, then you will see why I posted this.

I won't compare it to Ippudo, both are exceptional and worth a try. This place is truer to the ramen spirit. Ramen isn't a gourmet dining experience, it's a delicious and greasy fast food; you get in and you get out. Totto is that kind of place. I didn't enjoy the spicy ramen as much as I loved their miso ramen; their miso has exceptional depth of flavor. The noodles are freshly cooked in front of you and are just perfect. There isn't much of a menu outside of ramen, but I like that.

Hey guys!!! You need to wait in line... Don't leave when you think there is more than an hour wait.. because the person in front of you might just write their name and leave... That's what happened to me on my 2nd visit.. my friend wrote his name on it around 7++.. When I reached half an hour later... there were approximately 10 people ahead of us.. I was so hungry and decided to leave at first.. but I don't know where to go... I just want good food.. so when the waiter came out and call everyone in front of us.. I am so glad that everyone left.. :p I don't even have to wait for more than 10 minutes!!!! YEAH!!!! this is way better than lottery.. hahaha.. Tried the miso ramen and the first chicken ramen... My friend ordered the spicy ramen.. So I wanna try the vegetable ramen.. There is something about this place.. I really love Totto.. I prefer Totto to Ippudo.. They are both good.. but I just love this small place.. which you can't even have more than 15 people in the restaurant.. It feels like the street stall in Japan.. and the person who made the ramen is hilarious.. Always greet his customer.. I love him.. I downgraded a star because I don't really like the vegetable ramen.. It's just a bowl of ramen with the salad greens.. It's as if I soaked the salad into the soup.. But I love the lime, avocado and the mushroom in it.. :) The spicy miso ramen that my friend ordered tasted really good.. He said that the portion is smaller this time.. He used to get 4 pieces of pork and he only get 2 now.. :p Come on Totto... Offer some extra pork.. :p I will still head to Totto for sure.. This is the place where I don't mind waiting!!!! :)

I'm not an expert on ramen, so it's hard for me to judge. ?I waited an hour and a half, and would I do it again? No. ?The char siu pork bun was absolutely delicious, and I would love to have it again but I can't wait on that line for it. ?The ramen was good, and I enjoyed slurping it on a cold day. ?But I wouldn't stand in line for it again. ?It's not a great experience because service is rushed. ?They want you to know what you want the moment you sit down, and because the line is so long, it's hard to dine comfortably. ?However, if you're going with fun people, the wait is an adventure.

OMG! Totally worth the FORTY FIVE minute wait for this place. ?Mind you, it was 1:30 on a Saturday afternoon. ?I kept thinking to myself, this better be some life changing ramen in order to justify the wait. The place is super small. ?The max they can hold is like 15-20 people at a time...hence the ridiculously long wait. ? But its sooo amazing and so worth it. ?The broth is light and flavorful. ?Its not full of MSG or salt but just tastes natural without being bland. ?I ordered the NIKU Ramen which is $15 and supposedly enough for 2 people because of the massive amount of meat they put in. ?Well I guess the wait did the restaurant some good because I ordered and ate it all. ?Partly because I was super hungry but also because it was just so good. ?I love the way they burn the pork with a torch to give it that extra smoky crispy flavor and texture. ?Place that on top of a bed of soft ramen sitting in a bowl of amazing broth and you have a LIFE CHANGING DISH!

THANK GOD FOR TOTTO RAMEN.. i was beginning to think new york didn't have good ramen after my experience at ippudo get here for an EARLY meal because the long wait starts early too!! can't expect much from the maybe 10 seats at the bar & 3 small tables.. so don't bother going w/ more than 4 in your party! write your name on the list at the front door & wait to be called! we got to sit at the bar and watch all 3 of the chefs work on our food so METICULOUSLY!! the staff is so nice (expected from japanese hospitality) ----the broth is good! the guy stirring constantly knows what he's doing! ----spicy ramen has white ramen noodles with the more al dente texture i like! (you can ask for the spicy sesame oil on the side so you can control the level of spicy!) ----miso ramen has yellow ramen noodles & a REAL scoop of miso paste on top ----FLAME-TORCH SEARED PORK BELLY much tastier AND cheaper than ippudo's ramen!! (although neither beats ramen in Southern Cali) NOTES:CASH ONLY & they have coat hooks in the middle of the restaurant & purse hooks under the bar!

ADHD Snap Shot: ?5 for the food 5 for the seated service, 1.5 for everything else. Make sure to get the appetizers. Totto Ramen brought even my most avid, mild mannered, Noodle Soup addiction supporter bf to his limits (beyond his limits) on patience and willingness to suffer for good food. ?Even mention of how I should rate, appears to bring back war veteran, shell shock-like agitation. ?Hence, I struggled on the rating and settled on a 4 as I think - given adequate strategery and expectation management the food can overcome some of these downsides. ?But seriously, Yelpers.... you need a plan of attack. This is where you use the Yelp website to create a master plan on how to approach dining at this restaurant. ? First the food: ?Absolutely excellent! ?To give you a sense for how excellent the food is, my bf, traumatized by the dining experience, lobbied hard to get my rating all the way down to a 1 based solely on atmosphere. I just couldn't in good conscious do it. ?The food is actually that good.The Ramen broth is amazing. ?The noodles were excellent al dente, The mix of stuff is fantastic. I added an egg, but also suggest adding corn to the Spicy Ramen with Pork. For those considering the Extra Spicy, Single Spicy was spicy enough that my bf said it was perfect and I was indifferent as to whether I should continue adding (both of us can take pretty spicy). We also got the Cod Roe rice bowl (not on menu), seaweed salad (not on Menu), and the Avo Tuna. The seaweed salad was ok (you can skip this). But the other two were delicious. ?Incidentally, the girl two seats down from us got a spicy tuna and rice dish (not on the menu). Here's the "take-away" yelpers. It is a mistake to only eat the Ramen here. ?You should and have to try the appetizers. ?If you only have the ramen, the grouchiness of the wait will stick these noodles around a 3 out of spite (they are a 5 if no wait), but the appetizers accentuate the experience and really highlight how much talent is involved at this lovely noodle shop. ?The noodle soup is filling enough, but I'm sure after the wait, stomach room is easy enough to find for these must try apps. The Wait: I signed up at 8:40pm on Friday night and was not seated until 10:30pm. Ouch... They have very strict policies at Totto. ?You have to be there when they call you. ?If you are not there, you are skipped and go to the end of the clip board. ?They also stop taking names at some point. ?Around 10pm, they count the final names and then do a calculation of how many they can serve and still close effectively at 11:00. ?You either do or do not make the cut. My advise is not to put your name in after 9pm. The Atmosphere: ?The first 3 seats at the bar are no good during the winter. Don't even bother taking your jacket or hat off. You're going to need them. ?The problem is adequate ventilation. ?The door to Totto Ramen has to be open or else this place will turn into a humid swamp of ramen. ?For me, that's not so bad... I kind of like the idea of bathing in ramen miso broth like air. ?But I think other would take issue.Additionally, there is a big fan right next to you circulating the cold air into the kitchen, and around your eating area. In the cold of winter, I suggest taking the hit of waiting longer and trying to get a seat farther back on the bar. ?if you have a group of 4 (btw... groups greater than 4 will need to be separated), then try to get the tables in the back. Also - ladies... there is no place to put your purse at the bar. ?Really. you're squeezed in and they have not installed hooks underneath the bar - as far as I can see. ?You've got to put it in your lap and balance precariously on a fairly uncomfortable bar stool. ?Realize though... this is 4 stars even though I loathe this ?kind of unthoughtful seating. ?Once the appetizers arrived I could care less. Service: My love of process and efficiency can't rate this aspect of the place anything under a 5. Wow, Totto Ramen. You guys know how to serve people quickly. ?If - during your massive wait - you are ready to order, then they are ready to take your order as soon as you sit - which - I contend - is greatly appreciated by those waiting. The wait staff and chefs are the absolute nicest. ?Seatings do tend to be in lumps - given the nature of things. The chefs are like a machine to watch. Even the best companies could learn something by watching them work together as a team. Final Details: ?Super cheap aps at around $5, noodle soup is the typical $10-15, but worth adding the extra $1-2 for extra stuff like egg and corn. ?Also... yes... this is a long review, but you've got long wait ahead of you, if you're in line reading this :)....

Let's rehash my three tenants of what ramen is supposed to taste like: 1. ?Are the noodles cooked perfectly? ?(Al Dente) 2. ?Bomb ass extra ingredients in the broth? 3. ?Is the broth tastier than Jessica Alba's bathwater? I first bookmarked and tried Totto Ramen at around 200+ reviews. ?My laziness has now rendered my review pretty much useless. ?I am going to write it anyways, because on cold nights like tonight, nothing feels better than a warm bowl of ramen...except for spooning. I've been to Totto and total of 5 times over the course of the last year plus. ?Yeah the wait sucks balls. ?So does the cramped seating, the crappy getting skipped in line part if you're not there when your name is called, and so is that "C" rating for the health inspection. ?WOOF. ?Do yourself a favor and don't look at what it got a "C" rating for. ?Be prepared to wait 1 hour plus after 6. In terms of ranking of best ramen i've had, this place falls as either 2nd or 3rd along with Ippudo, and just short of the best ramen ever (Ramen Dojo - San Mateo, Bay Area http://www.yelp.com/biz/…). I usually opt for the Totto Spicy or Totto Extra Spicy ramen depending on how hungry I am. ?The spicier it is, the more I drink and the less I am able to eat. 1.) ?The noodles here are always perfectly al dente. ?Nice chewiness. ?The only downer is that it's not as fun to Kaedama to get extra noodles like it is at Ippudo. ?Nevertheless, perfectly cooked. ?Probably the best part of Totto. 2.) The extra ingredients are nice, but nothing out of the super ordinary. ?I've never sat at the bar to watch the cooks, but I believe they hand torch the char siu pork. ?Very well flavored. ?The big piece of nori is a nice touch. ?There are a number of extra ingredients you can get. ?I do wish there were more egg options. 3.) ?Finally, does the broth taste like Jessica's bathwater? ?Although, the broth looks relatively clear and simple compared to other places, it packs a lot of flavor. ?I think this is another strong point of Totto, and I think something they do better than Ippudo. ?Slurp slurp. No surprise a really legit place for ramen in NYC. ?The wait time and the "C" rating do bring it down a notch for me, but it's pretty much splitting hairs between the other NYC ramen champ. Will have to come back before winter is up.

I am among those in the "Totto greater than sign* Ippudo" camp. Both of my top two NYC ramen joints share the 4 star rating though. I'm just not in the business of giving away 5 stars to ramen places that I have to wait 1+ hrs for at this point. I love the Totto Extra Spicy Ramen because I like it hot. I like it so hot I can't feel my lips. When my nose starts running and my eyes start watering, that's when I experience my own utopia. It's like an addiction, the spicier the better, just pile it on. Few places can bring me to that special place, and the extra spicy ramen at Totto does. It's special.** _________________________ * Really, Yelp, you won't let me use the greater than sign in my review? ** For those who actually can relate to me and order the extra spicy, I have one extra piece of advice - Use separate napkins to wipe your mouth and your nose. And remember which is which. Because... well, if you wipe your mouth first and then your nose, you'll nose will know why.

Ok so I am not a ramen expert, actually my first time eating ramen was last night at Ippudo and it was so delicious that I decided to try Totto bc so many people were raving about it too. I ordered the Totto Miso Ramen.. the setting was cool, felt more like Naruto-style, and the ramen itself was pretty good! But it wasn't as good as Ippudo in my opinion.

I came here during lunchtime, which was a mistake. It was way too crowded and there was actually a wait. When we got inside, we were seated at the counter. I chose the Totto Miso Ramen. It was not bad - a flavorful broth and adequate portion size. They were a little stingy with the char siu though. Once we finished, the waitress grabbed our bowls and pretty much wanted to get us out for the next customer. This place is too rushed for my tastes.

here's another five star review to add to their collection. despite the ridiculous wait, this is still my favorite place for ramen. how is it even possible to make broth so rich and full of flavor? no matter how full i am, i still end up drinking every last drop of the broth. well, whatever i can manage to scoop up using my spoon - as informal as it is, i'm keeping it classy and stopping just short of picking up the bowl and drinking the remaining broth. i'm undecided on whether i like the paitan or spicy ramen the best. the paitan is the same thing as the spicy ramen, just without the spicy oil. it does come with a little more meat than the spicy (shredded pork in addition to the two pieces of char siu pork). i like the miso ramen but it's not my favorite. the pork buns are good but not the best in the city tip - if you have a name that is hard to pronounce, as in every one of your teachers mispronounced it during roll call, adopt an easy to pronounce name so that you don't miss it when the host calls the next group. i actually overheard him tell a customer that - "use an easier name next time, we're japanese." also, time it properly! if you walk away and aren't there when your name is called, they WILL skip you and you have to go to the bottom of the list. been there, done that. who waits in line twice in one night for a meal?! clearly we really REALLY wanted ramen.

The ramen was only okay... What can I say. With a wait of 1hr+ I was truly expecting to get blown away. I know there are a lot of variations on ramen and I generally like all sorts - salt based, pork based, miso based etc. I wouldn't say I have a favorite but I really enjoy good broth and good fillings in the ramen. UNFORTUNATELY I thought that the totto ramen was only okay. The noodles were good, cooked perfectly but the spicy totto ramen tasted like.. cajun ramen. There was something interesting in the actual spice used. It was not at all an asian-spice flavor. It wasn't bad but I guess different??

We arrived at the place around 6:30pm and waited for nearly an hour to be seated. The ramen joint is small; most customers are seated at the kitchen bar and there are a few tables in the back. The restaurant received an A from the department of health. Since I received a food protection license, I have been aware of what's right or wrong in the kitchen. Not everyone follows the regulations. We ordered the Avo Tuna. I really like how the ingredients played out. Only if the chefs add less soy sauce, it could have been perfect. I'm still thinking what's the crunchy stuff on the top of the tuna. I ordered chicken paitan ramen while my boyfriend had the spicy ramen. I found my ramen to be very creamy, but the sliced pork was juicy. When I tried my boyfriend's ramen, you can taste the spiciness and the powder. He also found the ramen to be creamy too. At the end, my stomach didn't feel that well. I'm lactose intolerant, I wonder if the creaminess is milk.

I have a love affair with ramen, and Totto Ramen satisfies all of my cravings! It's hard being pescetarian and still be able to find good ramen, but I was quite impressed by the mushroom broth here. I love the vegetarian spicy ramen, and I get it with a side of spicy bamboo shoots. The wait can be a bit long as this place is way too popular, but they tend to move people in and out fairly quickly. So bring a book to read!

Totto ramen is a synonym of authentic perfectly cooked Japanese ramen in a great deep-flavored chicken broth, accompanied with succulent pork belly pieces. Plus, they're also super cheap! The only rason why I don't go there every other day is the usually long wait. In addition, the waiting staff is also particularly clueless as far as basic logistics (they won't always be able to figure out how to free two 2-seat tables to seat 4 people) and managing of the line list (they are absolutely incapable of estimating the waiting time). TIP: A strategy that sometimes pays off is to leave your name on the waiting list, approximately estimate the waiting time, go for a beer in the neighborhood, and come back, hoping that your name hasn't been called, yet. If it works it's a win-win!

After an hour and a half of waiting in the bitter cold, I was not impressed by Totto Ramen. ?The inside is very small with very little breathing room. ?We were seated at the bar and I was really grateful for the hooks underneath. ?Even so, I felt super rushed throughout the meal. ? We ordered the Miso Pork Ramen and the Niku Ramen. ?We also got the spicy tuna over rice. ?It's pretty awesome watching the guys cook the food and everything came pretty fast. ? The spicy tuna over rice was really tasty..sadly I enjoyed it probably more than the ramen. ? The miso pork ramen had a mild taste but was salty. ?The noodles were decent but a bit undercooked for me. ?The Niku ramen was enormous; hello MEAT! ?The charsui was okay...yes it was fatty but not very flavorful. ?And seriously, why was there so many greens in my bowl!? ?I had to search for the noodles. ?The Niku ramen gave us horrible garlic breath afterwards... Overall, the service was nice but the food wasn't remarkable enough for me to want to wait an hour and a half in the cold for ramen.

My friend and I decided to try Totto for our girls night out since we knew it would involve some waiting and we are both plagued with boyfriends who 1) dislike Japanese food and 2) refuse more than a 15-minute wait. Well! Insofar as to waiting, we were not disappointed. It was not a 1 hour wait, nor was it a 2 hour wait. It was a 2.5 hour wait! ?Absolutely amazing...fortunately it was a pretty nice night so it wasn't torturous and I came prepared with a kashi bar which was consumed at the 2-hour mark. The food itself was a little bit of a let-down. The char-siu pork was too thinly cut, 75% fatty and there was none of the charring or crispiness I was expecting. Just two sad little pieces of essentially soggy bacon floating in my bowl... The sole redeeming factor was that they lay the scallions on really thick, and boy do I love scallions! Unfortunately, they don't really have any other vegetables in the standard bowl, just a few bean sprouts... Everything else you have to order separately. It's not so much that the food was a big let-down. It's just that the sad pork compounded with the long wait left me more disappointed than I normally would feel.

When I learned I was coming to NYC for my birthday weekend, I was beyond excited. A huge part of that excitement was due to the food - Chicago is an amazing food city, however, they have several food 'voids'. One of those food voids is honest-to-goodness ramen. I wanted the real deal in New York, so my husband and I hunted down the top two Ramen joints in NYC - Ippudo and Totto. Totto was closer to our hotel, so once arrived in Manhattan (and checked in) we marched straight over to Totto. Even though it was the butt end of lunch hour, it was still about a 30 minute wait. NO MATTER. WE WERE ON A RAMEN-ESQUE MISSION. Once our name was finally called, we sat at the bar and were given all of 90 seconds to decide what we wanted. It's not a huge menu, so there's not a ton of deliberation involved. We both chose the Totto Spicy Ramen. My husband got a side of corn and I got a side of seasoned avocado. The chefs work in front of you, and once our order was put in they hit the ground running. They piled fresh ramen noodles, savory meaty broth, spicy sesame oil, scallions, char siu pork, bean sprouts, nori and the avocado. It Was Divine The broth was fragrant, meaty and spicy, the noodles were cooked al-dente (perfect!!), the avocado was savory and the vegetables added a nice crunch. The pork was fatty and tender with a nice char - this was definitely a highlight. It's a richer cut of pork, for those who are curious. I was absolutely blown away by this soup, we both left stuffed and extremely impressed. I highly recommend this place to anyone jonesin' for noodle soup. Cash Only.

The group of friends that I was with are....let's say...picky. And cheap. We were all irritable and hungry, but decided to wait it out to be seated at Totto. We waited an hour. My friends were pretty upset at me. We couldn't even get seated together (understandable - very small place!). When we were feed and happy, my friends told me that was the best ramen they ever had! (YAY!!! I'm saved from burning at the stake!) I enjoyed being able to control the spiciness by adding the spicy bamboo shoots.

I got some nice tips from a few regulars. 1. Get there 10 minutes before it opens. 2. Put your name on the list. 3. Enjoy anything and everything on the menu I got the Spicy Chicken Totto Ramen. It was really good, but next time I think I am going to get the regular version. It wasn't too spicy but it was peppery. The chicken and ramen noodles were insanely good. Once I got to the broth I was actually able to taste the broth without the spices by swirling my spoon and then eating the non spicy broth in the center. I know that was a little weird to say. Everything tasted great and the staff was very friendly. Can't wait to try new things!

I'm white and I've never had ramen that I didn't make out of a package until now. I can't claim that this is the best ramen place in the city and comparing it to Maruchan ramen is just silly. But, wow. I had the Spicy Totto Ramen with char sui pork, with the addition of corn and a boiled egg. We sat at the counter and got to watch the chefs make all of the dishes. I can admit that seeing the chicken feet boiling in the chicken broth threw me off for a second, but it didn't deter me. The broth was incredible and the rayu (spicy seasme oil) added a wonderful kick of flavor. I really don't like fat on my meat, but the fatty pork was delicious. I got the restaurant around 5:30pm on a Tuesday. By 5:50 when my friends arrived there was a good crowd waiting. We were a party of 3 and I put our name on the list once we all arrived and we only had about a 10 minute wait. I actually said when I was leaving, "I can't wait for it to be cold out, I'll be here all of the time". I take that back. I'll go anytime but I would prefer if it didn't get cold again, ever.

Make sure that you check your place at the list from time-to-time. I would say it varies, but seems like 10 parties ahead = 1 hour. The gate keepers claimed they called my party, but they did not. Same thing with another party. Really? I waited here for two hours, and I am not going to let you just skip us over. Why the 5 stars? Once you slurp the ramen, you will be food drunk, and the Totto Ramen gate keepers are forgiven. Oh, and the ice cold Sapporo helps, too. Get the char siu pork chunks!

I know a lot of reviewers here say this is even better than Ippudo...which was part of what led me to try this place out, and I'm going to put it out there right now: It's not as good as Ippudo. It probably boils down to personal preference. Totto's ramen soups are all chicken based, which is a deviance from the norm (generally, it's more pork based) and interesting, but it doesn't have that...creamy, "fatty" feel to it. I got the Mega Ramen, which was delicious and incredibly filling, so you're getting a good amount of food for your money. Protip: Go about 10-15 minutes before they open for an early dinner. Put your name down. You'll be in there in a flash. In general, I find that doing your research about wait times are popular restaurants pay off. You KNOW this place will have a line. Beat the line. Beat the crowd. You win.

I came when it first opened and thought the ramen was just OK but not worth the wait. My second visit confirmed it. Their soup is flavorful but not very rich because it's chicken stock and not pork. My preference for ramen is a rich heavy stock with thick chewy noodles. Totto had neither. Their soup was light and the noodles were thin and very al dente. The extra spicy comes with a cup of chili oil on the side. I dumped the whole thing in and it was barely making me sweat. The fried garlic in the chili oil was very tasty though. Almost burnt to a crispy char. We put our name down around 12:30 p.m. and went down to Cafe Zaiya only to find out it was closed on the day after New Years. We headed to Sunrise Mart next door for a "snack". Which was a bowl of soup, 2 macarons, and 2 onigiri. Went back uptown and we still had to wait another 30 minutes. This place is way hyped up and at least half of the people eating here are tourists. For me the best ramen is at Mitsuwa in Jersey. It'll take you less time getting there than waiting at Totto..

This place doesn't really need another review but I will try to sum it up quickly. ?One of the best ramen places I've ever had but it makes a big difference when you go because they have different chefs. ?Maybe it was because we were hungry or because of 1.5 hour wait, but the ramen we had on a Friday night was absolutely de-ricious. ?We both ordered the spicy ramen and additional char siu pork, which was just the right amount of fatty chewey tender goodness. ?The broth was complex and not overpowered by the spices and the pork was hearty and added a nice touch. That said, we were so excited and kept talking about the ramen all night. ?Just like a good date, you got to make sure to go back for seconds and see that you weren't hallucinating. ?Well we went back on a Monday since people said there was no wait at 3 p.m. ?Indeed we only had to wait 20 minutes to get in. ?This time however my spicy ramen was way too spicy to taste the broth and the pork was a bit overdone. ?I suspect this is because the lunch crowd has different chefs than the dinner crowd and maybe the broth hasn't been as developed. Bottom line: if you are willing to wait (put your name down and come back every 20-30 minutes depending on what day of the week you go), this is consistently delicious ramen. I'll be back for a 3rd time, with baited breath and hoping for a repeat of the first. CASH ONLY.

Oh my, so delicious. Worth the hour-plus wait; put your name down early and sightsee in the area for 30 minutes to kill time. I got the miso and was blown away, but tried others and they were just as good. And the price is great for NY!

Long wait as this place seats about 20 people. ?Don't come with more than 4 people in your party! ?Came at 830P on Sunday and it was a 45 min. wait, fast turnaround tho, took me about 15 min. to order and finish ?my bowl of ramen. ?We ordered the Totto chicken paitan ramen with pork and the Totto extra spicy ramen. ?Both were the same, except the spicy ramen came with a side of spicy sauce. ?It was very spicy to my liking. ?The broth was delicious, not salty and the noodles were al dente perfect. ? My only gripe is they don't give you enough stuff! ?Not enough noodles as I was still hungry afterwards. ?It came with 2 slices of very thin pork belly, one piece of seaweed, some beansprouts and lots of green onions. ?No egg, no corn, no pickles... I felt like they could have cut their pork belly a lot thicker considering how cheap pork belly actually is. ?If I were to order all the extra stuff that normally comes with ramen, I'd pay about $15 a bowl. ?I would give it four stars if I didnt care about all the extra stuff that makes ramen good...

The big question: is the wait worth it? I was in town visiting when my brother and his fiance kept raving about this new ramen place. Of course, being a lover of food, I HAD TO TRY IT! After making everyone wait for 2.5 hours outside on a cold cold day, we finally got seated. **NOTE: there is no call ahead, you must be there to put your name on the list. There is limited space to stand around and wait, you'll probably be hanging out on the sidewalk in front of this place, and if you miss your name when it's called, they'll put you all the way at the end of the list again. If you ask the host, they'll always quote you an hour wait regardless if it's more or less, don't believe him!** THE RAMEN: I'd have to admit. The ramen is amazing. Ever since I visited Korea and has the "best" ramen in my life, everything has been held up to that standard and nothing has come close to beating it. This was pretty amazing. The pork was melt in your mouth. I decided to get extra pork because most places don't give you enough, but trust me, the two pieces that originally come in this ramen should be more than enough. They cut it so thick. The best part, and I beg you to not forget it. GET AN EGG IN YOUR RAMEN!!! It will change your life. So yes, the ramen was good. Yes the ramen is soooo much better than Ippudo but imagining waiting another 2.5 hours for a bowl of ramen... I'm not sure it'll happen again

Waited about an hour on Easter Sunday night and was rewarded with bar seats right in front of where they prep the ramen and torch the cha siu pork before serving. The guys had some kind of private syncopation going that involved banging the bowls with chopsticks and slamming the refrigerator doors in unison. The sound track is key (some kind of Japanese techno) and in fact one of the chefs spent some time in the back room while we were there reloading the playlist. Overall these guys have way too much fun but it's okay because the ramen is so good... actually the ramen broth... a LOT of chickens went in there. One weird thing, or maybe not, you can't take out your left overs (unless you sneak in a thermos of course). The food is so good and fresh I can see they wouldn't want somebody to judge them based on reheated ramen. But still... it's my food, I paid for it, shouldn't I get to do what I want with it?

Worth the wait. Totto spicy ramen is the way to go. The ramen noodles were better than ippudo but ippudo's pork buns are way better. Gave it 4 stars because 5 stars for the ramen & 3 stars for the pork buns.

I guess the ramen craze goes on and I still don't get it. Came here on an early ?weeknight after work, was told the wait is 45 min. Still more reasonable than the wait at Ippudo, but eh at least it wasn't that cold. Got seated after 30 min and handed the simple menu. So I guess its the spicy ramen. Food came promptly but I mean comon, ramen is ramen. Personally I have not been to Japan but can't say how much more special the broth of a ramen can get. All is said and done, it wasn't worth the half hour wait and $25 bill for two bowls of noodles.

Updating to mention that the last time we were there, we ordered the side of char siu and just as we were about to dig in, we definitely found a clump of hair. GROSS, but when we pointed it out, the serving staff were crazy apologetic and felt terrible, whisked it away immediately, gave us a new plate, and then gave us a complimentary dish of pork to make up for it. I'm a sucker and that made up for it. ?I do, however, need to take away 1 star b/c in the end it's still pretty gross.

Perfect place to eat. Waited 45 mins to get in. They open at 4pm on Sundays and there was a line out the door. Ordered the spicy ramen with pork and egg. Pork was very tender. The broth was excellent. The spiciness left a tingling feeling on my lips :). Fast service. Authentic food! ?Definitely a place to check out. Btw- no sitting on the steps nearby. Neighbors will get mad.

Call me crazy, but on a fifteen degree night I was actually excited to see people standing outside Totto, huddled together and waiting for over an hour to get called in. I knew it was bound to be good. I joined this slightly crazy group and after 45 minutes my friends and I were called in (right before my pinky toes would have fallen off.) The host was incredibly nice and thanked us for waiting. We took a seat at the bar and were instantly comforted by the sights and smells of ramen. Our chef was hilarious, singing and dancing to the odd playlist of obscure funk music and gushy ballads, thanking each and every customer who left, and pounding out some fast and delicious bowls of ramen (we were in and out of the restaurant in less time than it took us to be seated). The menu is very straightforward-- three types of ramen and their spicy sister dishes, stuff you can add on, and three different appetizers if you want to order one (totally unnecessary, though). Everyone gets water, and you can order soda or beer if you want (again, unnecessary). Everything was prepared exactly as ordered. I got the veggie ramen with spicy sesame oil on the side (to control the spice)-- each flavor got the spotlight at some point-- seaweed, greens, pickled vegetables, mushrooms, yuzu paste, lime, sesame oil, noodles-- and it all came together perfectly. I could not have asked for a more delicious bowl of ramen. While it was not fine dining, the experience was definitely five stars. Some hints for when you visit: -Show up early -Bring cash -Know what you want -Come by yourself if you don't mind -Get the spicy sesame oil -Dress for the weather outside -Try to sit at the bar (watching them prepare the bowls is the best part!)

The spicy chicken ramen was outstanding, the noodles, homemade and cooked al dente. Buy the Chef (he is always on the left, and he is the only one touching the noodles) a glass of nigori, it got me some kim chee and mad love. Expect to wait at least an hour, I was visiting from LA, and it was worth the wait.

Not as good as Ippudo. Broiled Char Siu Pork (House specialty pork broiled and placed over a bed of vegetables): Thick pieces of juicy pork belly. Didn't really taste the Char Siu flavor, but it was decent. I wouldn't get this again, though. Miso Ramen (The finest Koji Miso and ground pork in a scoop atop slightly wavy noodles in original Paitan soup. Topped with a seasoned hardboiled egg, scallion, bean sprouts, onion and char siu pork): I got this with Extreme Rayu (spicy sesame oil). Broth is more umami, more woodsy mushroom flavored than Ippudo's. Noodles are more like ramen noodles: curly, and a bit softer than Ippudo's. Pork belly pieces are also thicker, juicier, and more flavorful than the ones at Ippudo. Totto is significantly cheaper than Ippudo, so that's a plus, but the ramen from Totto and Ippudo are comparable; it just depends on what kind of broth and noodles you like. I prefer Ippudo's broth and Ippudo's overall dining experience. Waiter gave us major attitude towards the end of the meal when they charged us extra for Mayo Don. I told the waiter we didn't order the Mayo Don and to deduct it from the bill, but he insisted that we ordered it and that my friend had eaten it. I'm sure it was an honest mistake, but it was still annoying because he kept insisting we had ordered it, after I repeatedly told him that we didn't. Thank god I took pictures of all the food we ate to prove to him that we did NOT order the Mayo Don. He finally deducted the Mayo Don from our bill, but he seemed pissed about it and complained about us to the other waiters. Restaurant Rule #1: The customer is always right; don't argue with the customer! 1/2 star deduction for this annoyance and disrespect toward me and my friend. Totto is tiny, there is barely any space to move around. Service overall was subpar and not as friendly or helpful as Ippudo. I'm glad I tried Totto, but I'll head to Ippudo for ramen from now on.

I was pleasantly surprised when I came here! ?It's a really small place, had to wait in line for about a half hour on a weekday night around 8. ?Make sure you sign in on the sheet at front! ? The Totto Spicy Ramen was awesome. ?Not too spicy, just perfect. ?The chair siu was a little chewy the day I went, but I will give the benefit of the doubt it's good every other night. ?Not bad at all for the cheap price though!

Is it annoying that one has to wait typically at least 45min? ?YES. Is it normal for one to have dreams about the ramen here? ABSOLUTELY! ? I hate you Totto Ramen for always making me wait out in the cold. But once I take the first sip of your thick tasty broth and the first bite of your perfectly al dente noodles, all is forgiven. Have I cheated on you and had affairs with the likes of Ippudo and Minca? ?YES. ?Although Ippudo looks pretty and offers wonderful ambience and Minca doesn't make me wait...I always come back to you Totto Ramen! ?You are the one for me!

I'm not going to be as harsh as I originally planned to be, but my experience here essentially solidified that I am a Minca fan thru and thru. Totto doesn't even come close as a competitor for me. I ordered the regular spicy ramen, which wasn't spicy but rather all black pepper! And I am that person who is not in love with black pepper, so I couldn't shake the bad taste of this the whole time. I now understand why the broth here was so different than other places. So taking it as a chicken-based broth, it was good. Clean and clear and complimentary to the noodles, which were on point. But after waiting in line for so long on a rainy day, I wanted creamy, fatty pork broth to warm my bones! The other thing that sealed their case for me was the lack of tenderness in the pork. Mine was surprisingly tough for ramen meat and not charred in all the right places (possibly tasted dry?), which is just a no-no. We also ordered the Avo Tuna on recommendation of my friend who was with me and had visited before. While the tuna itself was kind of good and the crunchy garnish was a nice touch, the bed of avocado it sat on looked old and tasted sour to me. All in all, I won't knock others who feel this spot is ramen heaven on earth, but really it's Minca, and then Menkui-tei, all the way for me. Nice try Totto getting me to THINK your food was worth the nearly 1.5 hour wait. However, your staff is super friendly and there should be more ramen spots uptown, so keep on doing what you do. (*Just think of a better way to handle the lines and crowded sidewalk. An angry old lady ran over my foot with her shopping cart she was so annoyed. Those are the kind of people who might manage to get "cool" places like you shut down in the Uptown hoods.) (Visit: Dec/11)

TOTTO RAMEN...I LOVE YOU AND THINK OF YOU ALL THE TIME!!!! ?Ok, maybe that is too much...actually no!!! ?Seriously, I do think about Totto Ramen every time I am having ramen! ?I don't live in NYC, but I make sure that I go there everytime I am in town! ?I really like the options and extra toppings that you can choose from. ?Also, the straight homemade Paitan noodles and the wavy yellow noodles are both really good. ?I always get the spicy ramen with the best chashu (die!!!!) with corn and boiled egg! ?Extra spicy sauce on the side please! Only things that you should keep in mind: 1) Cash only 2) There will be a wait if you do not go early to out your name on the board before they open to get first seating! ?No joke! Last weekend, I went by at 11am to put my name on the board when the restaurant opens at 12pm. ?There was already 3 tables ahead of me! ?By the way, there are only 3 tables (2 four seaters, 1 two seater) and bar seating! ?Totally worth the wait...your palette will thank you over and over again!

Hands down the best ramen in town. The broth is ridiculous. It hugs your throat as it slides down, all collagen-y. It's like getting the warmest hug from the inside out. ?And their chili oil makes me drool. That they played Nujabes over one of my meals earns an extra point.

LOVE Totto Ramen- HATE the wait. ?I've waited nearly 2 hours before for this... and generally wait about an hour. ?There's no good area to sit/stand when there's a large crowd waiting either and no cover if it starts raining. The food however is not only affordable but super addictive. ?I've been like at least 5 times now despite hating the wait so much. ?Can't say I really switch it up though- every time I get the spicy ramen with the pork (but ask for the stuff that makes it spicy on the side so I can adjust myself).

The search for the best ramen in New York continues with my recent visit to totto. You would think coming by yourself would mean a shorter wait...nope. Waited about an hour and a half -___- came at around 12:40 and got seated at 2pm. oh dear. Got seated and they immediately took my order. Lovely cause at that point, I had no more patience...Decided on the extra spicy ramen and added an egg for an extra dollar. Needed my protein! My order came in literally a few seconds! I noticed that you get served WAY faster when you're by yourself cause the couple next to me got their order like five minutes after mine even though they ordered around the same time as me...makes eating by yourself less lonely? Anyway, the extra spicy rayu+onion+garlic was given on the side and I made the HORRIBLE choice of dumping that whole ish in... Oops. But it's okay because I was still able to taste the broth...I think? Even the worker was concerned for me, asking if the spiciness was okay. I mustered a "Daijyobu" (I'm okay) but seriously, I was sniffing like crazy. *tear* Next time, I'll learn to use my spoon to put the garlic bits on top cause I mixed it all up and got soggy, losing its crunchy texture :(( I found three slices of pork in my ramen - I THINK the standard is two pieces (?) Did the worker feel sorry for me??? Or was it cause I ordered in Japanese??? Either way, I'm not complaining ^^ The ramen was delicious but nothing to write home about. And the wait definitely affected my rating. The broth was decent, the ?noodles were the right texture, and I definitely enjoyed the large amount of green onion :] Oh btw, cash only!

Totto Ramen is a MUST-eat when I come to NYC from CA...long wait times be damned! It's worth every minute!! (Just don't sit on the apartment next door's stoop...angry man will go into Totto to scold them) I've had the Miso Ramen and the Spicy Ramen. Both are delicious and excellent. I think I like the miso better just because I love how they serve it with a dollop of miso paste. Also a must, the spicy tuna donburi and the pickled garlic...delish!! I tell people not to even bother going to Ippudo, I hate that place with all their douchy waiters/hostesses. Totto's staff are friendly, funny, engaging and JAPANESE! (bonus!)

I finally decided to come here because the 2-3 hour wait (as told on the phone) for Ippudo was just too much. ?After calling Totto, I was told our party of 4 would be approx 40 minutes, so we head on over and put our name down. ?The 40 minute wait ended up being a little over an hour. ?We were so hungry that no one spoke a word to each other when we got our food, but let me rewind a bit. ?So we got seated at the counter which ended up being pretty cool because you can see all the magic happen. ? The place holds about 8 at the counter and maybe 8-10 at the tables...yes it's tiny and they can't accomodate more than a party of 4, you'll be split up for sure. ?Also, CASH ONLY. ? Okay, so people weren't kidding about them having you order in 90 seconds or whatever. ?It was literally more like 30 seconds, I was overwhelmed. ?Got the spicy ramen with extra corn and bamboo topping. ?Like I said, my friends and I barely spoke a word to each other....either because we sat at the counter or because we were so hungry or because it was tasty. ?My husband said it was okay but I came out a fan and thought it was really yummy. ?Their char siu pork was probably the best I've ever had (with the perfect amount of charred fat mmmmmmmm). I don't think there are many good ramen places in New York, but this will definitely do....although I do need to try Ippudo still.

Okay, Yelp. I trusted the reviews and waited for an hour and a half in the cold. Our party of four was separated to save time, and my sister and I perched on the bar, which was about ten feet from the chefs, who were all tan and muscular and gossiping in Japanese while they cooked. We ordered two spicy ramens, one chicken and the other pork. Sitting basically in the kitchen, I could see how this place got a C grade for sanitary issues. Nothing was covered, everything was out in the open, and one of the chefs sampled some noodles from a bowl. At least they were wearing gloves. The ramen. It kicked my ass. It wiped the floor with me. It was so wonderful. The char siu was great and fatty. The noodles were hard but chewy. Get a hard boiled egg. I don't like eggs, but that egg in my ramen changed my life. No joke. Don't believe me? Prove me wrong. Get it. I had some of the pork from my dad's meat lovers ramen. Now this, my friends, alone earned Totto five stars. So good. Tender, fatty, cannot keep my chopsticks out of my mouth good. Convince your friend to get a bowl and steal half the meat. You could easily get sick of the richness of the pork, so be a good boy/girl and share. I give in. Five stars. It was delicious. But I'm no ramen expert. I'm just a little Chinese girl looking for noodles in the theater distinct. Try it yourself. Yum yum. But some suggestions, Totto. Work on your sanitary-ness. Get a larger location. And get a freaking heater.

Very rude service today. We waited for our turn for an hour and half to get into the restaurant. We didn't hear our name called even though we were sitting right by the door. Our name ended up being crossed off without us knowing it, so when I confronted the guy about it he just told us to write our names again at the bottom of the list, which meant another hour wait. We ended up leaving disappointed. Very sad we couldn't get our ramen.

This is my favorite of the places where you consistently have to wait 45 minutes to an hour (Ippudo, Momofuku Noodle). The good: flavorful broth that's not too salty, noodles are never bloated or soggy, and for those who like an extra kick, get a side of spicy bamboo shoots and drop one into each spoonful of soupy ramen for just the right amount of heat. I love going by myself and sitting at the counter where I can interact with the ramen masters and watch them do their thing. The mediocre: the char siu pork, I prefer it sliced thinner and with more of that blowtorched char that you get at Ippudo and Minca. It's crowded and stuffy inside and less than ideal for a party larger than two, but not quite right either for a date. Despite the mediocre, given the number of bad and ugly ramen joints in this city, I definitely consider myself a fan of Totto.

After waiting in line for 1.5 hours my party of two was seated and i ordered the niku ramen (garlic, ?scallions, lots of pork) with an added seasoned avocado topping (topping was good). The broth. ?You can never have too much garlic i always say, that is, until i had the niku ramen, which included a healthy lump of garlic paste. ?it is a strange day indeed when I'm complaining about too much garlic, but the garlic paste completely overpowered the broth. ?all i could taste was the garlic. ?That, in addition to this joint being a chicken broth place, made this just an okay experience. ?I prefer a pork based broth, but i know that some people may be okay with and may even prefer chicken based broth. ?Different strokes for different folks i guess. ?I will say that, unlike a lot of other ramen places, the broth was not over poweringly salty (that goes a long way in my book). Aside from the broth, i thought the char sui pork was delicious. ?It was really tender, had a great char, and was seasoned well. ?It's much better done here than at ippudo, where their char sui is not tender and doesn't have that rich flavor to it. ?Aside from the char sui, i did not like the other pork cuts that came with the ramen. ?Some were extremely fatty (which I'm actually okay with since it adds flavor to the broth, i just avoided eating the fatty parts), but i had big, tough pieces that were dry, overcooked pieces of pork. ?Each bite I really had to tear at the meat, and then it took me a while to gnaw at it. The noodles i am neutral about. ?I have nothing really good or really bad to say about them. Overall, i think the ramen here is just okay. ?Char sui is flavored well and is tender, other pork cuts, not so great. ?Not a super big fan of the broth. ?So I'd have to say a 1.5 hour wait for this place is not worth it.

This was some of the best ramen I've ever had! In fact, after getting home to the Bay Area, I visited my favorite ramen place and I found myself wishing I was back eating at Totto Ramen again! I had the Totto Spicy Ramen with Pork and it was amazing. The broth was delicious, the pork was tender and flavorful and the noodles were perfect! I only wished there was a hard boiled egg in my ramen... that would've made it perfect. The wait to get in was long, as the place is tiny. I think there were six 2-seat tables and about 8 or 10 seats at the counter. I enjoyed that when it was time to order, the cook asked me what I'd like and offered suggestions. Staff is extremely inviting, friendly and attentive. I can't wait to go back here again on my next trip to NY!

Totto's makes a very nice bowl of Ramen, with rich broth, and perfectly done al-dente ramen noodles. They also have spicy or VERY spicy versions available as well. They didn't earn a 5 star rating with me because I've traveled enough and sampled enough ramen to know that it COULD be better. There was only one choice of noodle type, whereas top shops offer several choices. And the lines at Totto's which are usually anywhere from 30 minutes to 2 hours are ridiculous! However they serve up a very good bowl of ramen that is hot and satisfying, and the waitstaff are very pleasant. If you don't mind waiting, you will certainly get your money's worth and have a pleasant ramen meal. Very small place, few tables and they're small, don't go with a group of more than 4 people.

I heard rave reviews from my boyfriend that Totto is superior to Ippudo. If you know Andrew K, you'll know that anything he speaks highly of is something to take note of. I stopped in at 11pm thinking there couldn't be any wait at this hour (they close at midnight M-F), but the wait was still about 40 minutes! The menu is pretty limited (chicken, miso, spicy miso, extra spicy miso, veggie...) and focused on ramen; they also have side dishes like tuna poke. It's interesting that they use different types of noodles, the miso ramen came with yellow curlier noodles, and my spicy miso came with straighter white ramen noodles. Both cooked perfectly al dente. The spicy miso is the perfect amount of spicy, you could still taste the miso. ? What makes Totto stand out is their rich broth, I imagine the pork fat from cha siu thickens the broth (mm delicious fat....). A regular sized bowl filled me up, I couldn't even drink all the broth because it was so rich. The price is pretty standard at around $11 for a bowl, $2.50 for extra noodles, and only $1 for extra corn, and $1 for extra kikurage mushrooms (they charge way more for that in SF). Can't wait to come back!

I believed the people raving about this place only after seeing customers standing in hungry anticipation for an hour to get inside. I had the spicy chicken ramen (I tend not to like pork), and my boyfriend had the pork-packed ramen bowl. His came with three types of pork--one was admittedly very pleasantly flavorful. He definitely enjoyed his as much as I enjoyed mine. The spicy kick on a cold night was well worth the wait. Oh, and the Sapporo beer to gulp it all down was no doubt the finishing touch.

Got here at 12:05 ... only f i v e minutes after opening and we had to wait a good twenty-five, thirty minutes to get in. Totto Ramen is definitely your class hole in the wall. It's dirty both inside and out so you don't know what to expect. I ordered the Totto Chicken Paitan and added a boiled egg + bean sprouts. Good food, good prices. We have a four star here.

Totto Ramen is a place you plan for. You eat breakfast at a very strange time so you won't want lunch until after 3. You hold back on the sodium for a day or two. You dress in layers because there is no telling if you'll be freezing by the door in line, comfortably nestled in a corner, or receiving a complementary steam facial directly in front of enormous, boiling pots of ramen. Even with all of the advance planning, today's lunch was well-worth the wait. I sat (immediately! go at a random time!) and ate non-stop for about 30 minutes and still could not get to the bottom of my bowl. Excuse my terminology (I am a ramen neophyte), but I can't imagine anything more delicious than the pork blob atop that delightful miso ramen. Another reason to love living in New York.

I was excited to try some of the best foods in NYC as soon as I arrived. After hearing word that waits can take up to two hours, I decided to try it during a time between lunch and dinner times. My boyfriend and I got there, and it was ridiculous that there was still a 30-minute wait at 3pm. The torched sea urchin was delicious. My boyfriend and I both had the Totto spicy ramen. We were unfortunately seated next to a party of two who were obnoxiously loud and talked about inappropriate topics. It is a shame how small the space is, so if you sit next to someone annoying, your chances of changing tables is virtually nonexistent. I was not too pleased with the service. We were seated first, but the party next to us were able to order and receive their food first, which I found annoying. I also found the spicy ramen to be mediocre in broth. There were not as many noodles as I had hoped, and it did not feel worth the wait or price. Will you see me back here when I am back in NYC? Probably not. It was overrated, in my opinion.

God, this place got so freaking busy and popular over the last 2 years. No wonder, because it really rocks. The soup will just make you go to heaven and the cha siu will blow you out of your mind. Order the side dishes, they are usually good. Ramen goes well with beer too. I just wish it wasn't so busy. This place is a tie for me with Ippudo - they are about the same level in terms of taste and busy-ness, although slightly less busy than Ippudo.

Hands down, my favorite ramen place in the city. It really tops Ippudo. Sure, I'm waiting about an hour to an hour and a half each time outdoors. Sure, they don't save your spot if you miss them calling your name. Once you get a seat and bask in the rich smell of ramen broth and bathe in the warmth, all that is forgotten. Get the spicy ramen with extra cha siu and a seasoned egg. I've never tried it not spicy but that's just my personal preference. (Next time, I'm going to get some extra hot oil on the side for a bit more of a kick.) This order stuffs me to infinity and beyond, even when I'm complete ravenous. The broth is perfect and the cha siu is so fat and it just almost melts upon consumption. The bf tried the spicy tuna and that was just alright. (I much rather prefer it at Udon West in St. Marks.) Just make sure that if you go somewhere else to loiter, keep track of the time and come back! You have to stick your name at the bottom of the list if they miss you and that plain sucks, especially during their busy hours. They should really expand!

Pros: -about $10 a bowl -flavor is good -i like the extra spicy option Cons: -not enough noodles for $10 -wait is WAYYy too long (waited over 2 hours) -cramped space (whole restaurant can only seat about 20 people max) Overall: For the 2 hour+ wait, it wasn't worth it. Their ramen is good, but not 2 hour good. Plus they barely give you any noodles. I think my bowl had just as many sliced green onions as it did noodles. disappointing. Also the restaurant is TINY. not nearly as big as Ippudo. Ippudo is a larger restaurant and provides you with a larger quantity of food (of course Ippudo costs more) I won't be coming back. Make it $6 bowl and 5 minute wait and then I'll think about it.

Best ramen that I've had so far in NYC! Love it! Arrived there around 12:15pm on a Saturday, and waited for about one hour to get in. It opens on 12:00pm! So be early if you don't wanna wait. Ordered the number one ramen on the menu, with choice of pork $9.75 (the other is chicken). Friend ordered the spicy ramen, with chicken $10.25. We also had the seaweed salad side, which was not on the menu $4.5. The soup is really delicious. Service is okay, the waiter didn't smile, and the restaurant is way too small. Altogether including tax was $26.95. Will definitely go there again.

I have been to Totto Ramen several times. ?The staff is always unfriendly and the line is ALWAYS long, but the delicious spicy ramen always kept me coming back. Until now. I was COMPLETELY DISGUSTED by the lack of sanitation. ?I sat at the front counter last night where they prepare the food and saw every disgusting move they made. ?The prep chef was blowing his nose all over the food (In all fairness, the space is so small there is nowhere else to do it). ?He would wash his hands--without soap--and then dry them on a dirty rag that must have been used and reused over and over again for weeks. ?Oh and it also doubled as the rag they used to clean the work surface. ?Gross. After watching this guy blow his nose while manhandling food, I couldn't take another bite. ?No wonder this place has a "C" rating from the Health Department. ? Oh and the neighbor who was yelling at the manager about how disrespectful Totto is to the neighborhood really made for lovely ambiance.

55 minute wait at 5:20pm on a cold Saturday night. Insane!!! The place can only seat 20 so be prepared to wait... The ramen here is much better than Ippudo's in my opinion - the broth at Totto is more flavorful and the noodles were cooked perfectly al dente. Don't be a cheapo like me... Get an egg or some sort of topping to soak up the flavor of the broth. I also ordered a char sui appetizer - not worth it. Oh and be warned - they charge an extra dollar and change for extra spicy sauce on the side! Would I come back? If only the wait wasn't so long :( Side note: the bathroom is ridiculously small and smells disgusting.

Tip: Go there around 3 pm if you're there on a Monday; might work on other weekdays too. I went Sunday ~8 pm then again ~10:15 pm, both long lines/waits. Then went on a rainy Monday at 11:55 am before opening and there was already a long line of people with umbrellas! Freakin' a, people come prepared to this place. I decided to swing by again at 3 pm not expecting anything (hotel was not far from the place) but the rain had cleared and amazingly so did the crowds. Waited only like 5-10 minutes thanks to a couple of others ahead of me who did not answer the calls of the staff. Anyway, the ramen was rockin'. Such flavorful broth, good noodles, almost a chewy texture, delicious pork (come on, don't come this far if you're from out of town to get the chicken). The fat on the pork was so tender and tasty that I ate every bite of it. Not rubbery or nasty fat like you have tasted in some places. I got mine spicy and if you can handle some spice, don't worry, it's actually not too spicy. Should have gotten the extreme spicy. Also added some bamboo shoots, good call. Super bummed no mushrooms available that day, I think it was crossed out on the menu for whatever reason. All in all, this is a high quality bowl of ramen, good portion, reasonably priced and as others have mentioned, do yourself a favor and complement it with some Sapporo

Best ramen in NYC. The line may be stupid crazy, the fanboys overzealous, and the meal unpretentious - but it really is as good as everyone says it is. Now, don't go believing that this ramen is going to be caviar topped or super awesome in delivery - it really just is really good, authentic, perfectly executed ramen in a comfortable portion for a great value. Do not bring dates here, or your mom unless she's a diehard ramen fanatic, because chances are, they won't be impressed. The noodles are hands down, the best I've had at a ramen place. They're perfectly al dente and they will let you order extra portions. The spicy ramen is perfectly hot enough to slurp without giving you heartburn, and the broth is amazingly flavorful. The best part is the char siu - no place is going to give you as amazing a piece of fatty porky barbecued charred goodness as Totto. If the line is short, you seriously won the lottery of food and get your butt in there. If the line is long, well, I'll keep you company.

What I like: The Ramen (btw this is very important if you are a Ramen Soup restaurant) The Broth (flavorful and not overly greasy) Spicy Ramen Soup ?($11)- two chilis on the menu - has the right amount of spiciness Seaweed Salad ($4.50) - very refreshing and tasty - good complemt with spicy ramen Near the northside of the theater district (had dinner here Order magically appears within 10 seconds of ordering it Prices are decent for a restaurant in Manhattan Satisfies that salt craving (without the MSG, but my date had her doubts) Bathroom, although tiny, was surprisingly clean What I don't like: Long lines (How long should I wait to get a bowl of Ramen Noodle? My wait time on a Thursday evening at 5:30 was about 15 minutes. ?By the time, I left it was 40 minutes) Lack of personal space when eating (They really cram you in here!) While efficient and attentive, the wait staff does rush you out (Hey, if you want to talk to your date go to one of the 4 Starbucks within a 2 block radius of the restaurant when you done eating) Limited menu (don't expect anything fancy, you come here for the ramen soup)

What I've tried: pork ramen, spicy ramen, extra spicy pork ramen; vegetable ramen, avo tuna. So far my favorite ramen shop in NYC. Fresh handmade noodles and broth -- you can see them making it if you sit at the bar. ?They use chicken broth so the broth is not too heavy, but will complement whatever ingredients you choose to add to the ramen (in particular, I find the spicy oil works better with the chicken broth than with a pork broth). I recommend the extra spicy pork ramen. Ask for the spicy oil on the side so you can control how much goes in (I find the regular spicy ramen doesn't have enough kick). ?I've tried getting both the chicken and the pork and the pork beats the chicken hands down. ?The quality of the grilled pork they use is higher than other ramen shops in Totto Ramen's price range, and it is fatty, luscious, and charred just right. You can't get that kind of deliciousness with chicken. I suggest getting the wakame seaweed or kikurage mushrooms as extras. The vegetable ramen is vegetable broth, which is excellent for the beloved vegetarians in my life...it includes a lime, advocado, and fresh vegetables. There is also a spicy version that seems to come in a smaller bowl. Be prepared to wait at least 45min, even at random times of the day, like 4pm on a Saturday afternoon. I've found that the lines defy any sense of logic. ?Also, not a place to go if you're claustrophobic, as the noodle shop is reminiscent of the tiny shops in Japan. CASH ONLY.

The holy grail of Japanese ramen street fare in New York. The ramen is to die for. Expect to wait 45 mins for dinner, and more if it's especially busy (there's a great Mexican place a few restaurants down where you can pass the time - they've got excellent guac and frozen margaritas). When I was finally seated with my accompanying friend, I was already feeling good from said margaritas, and as such as in a sort of blissful stupor as I breathed in the soul-warming aromas. I knew I was in for some heavenly perfection, and that is indeed what I received. The broth is rich and hearty, sprinkled with flavorful green onion, and the pork is seared with a torch and cooked to succulent perfection. The entire staff is Japanese and speaks Japanese, so if you have been to a ramen shop in Tokyo, then you will feel right at home. And when my group of 5 walked outside, the initial indifference to the entire experience (they had never heard of it) was now one of giddy satisfaction from a totally unexpected meal (undoubtedly one that forever altered their perception of ramen, a food most associated with Cup Noodles and similar instant ramen brands). Go there next chance you get.

CASH ONLY. I know this place got a 'C' for sanitation in 2011 but that must be why it tastes better than all the other ramen places. I know, I grossed myself out just by writing that but this place is legit good. Like everyone else said, the wait here is crazy. I've come here MANY times on different days and different times. I've also come here with no more than 3 people. It's probably best for you to NOT come with a party more than 3 because seating will take EXTRA long for you. On a random Tuesday night, the wait was 1hr 45 minutes. SMH! I always get the first one on the menu. I think it's just the standard ramen. It used to be only with pork meat but recently they added the option of chicken (I don't like pork so yay for totto for accommodating to ME. haha). They're quick, the waiters are friendly, and they yell out something in Japanese when you leave. For $10-$15 a bowl, it's not bad and clearly, worth the wait.

like this place because they proudly state there is no MSG! Maybe I ordered the wrong thing because it was too overwhelming for me to enjoy, got the NIKU ramen, which was a whole lot of pork bits and a TON of garlic and raw onions. ?wow, definitely not kissing anyone, let alone talking to strangers in public after that meal!!! the chasu they make is delicious, however, on the way to the tiny slit of a room known as their bathroom, i saw clear blue bags with raw pork being tossed among staff members. ?Guess that ruined the magic, but seeing all ?that pork being manhandled that way was pretty gross!

The food is definitely worth the hype! I got the totto spicy ramen (which was actually not that spicy at all), along with some extra char siu pork (fatty and delicious) and the extra spicy bamboo shoots (wasn't as crazy about these, but they tasted very authentically Japanese at least!). The ramen itself came in a broth that was absolutely amazing. I could drink gallons of that stuff by itself, and I wish they sold just bowls of that! The noodles were very traditional-tasting, and though I'm generally not a huge fan of noodles, there was just the right amount in the bowl for me. The only downside was that the two of us waited two hours starting at around 7 on a Friday night...for a meal that took us around twenty minutes to finish. The food was good, but not sure it was worth a two hour wait. If you do decide to go (and you should!), you should aim for off-peak times.

Waiting to eat at Totto's for more than an hour & constantly checking up on the status of the clip board was truly horrendous. I have never tried Totto, but I can tell that Totto must taste really good because there were so many devoted individuals who were waiting for a VERY LONG time just to eat at this hole on the wall restaurant. Even a single person party who was waiting by themself to be seated on the counter was waiting as long as we were to eat there. I praise individuals who can wait for more than an hour just to eat by themselves. I don't know if I have the patience and stamina to wait that long for food (especially if I was super hungry). We ordered the Miso Ramen & the Spicy Ramen. I liked the Spicy Ramen more than the Miso. The soup (miso & spicy) were very savory, and the pork belly meat was very tender and delicious. I liked it, but my sister and I debated that we still thought Ippudo had the best ramen in NYC. Ippudo's ramen soup was more savory than Totto's, and their pork meats were of better quality and taste than Totto's. Nonetheless, we had a great foodie experience eating at Totto's. We were happy that we tried it.

Ramen isn't as prevalent in many cities outside of NYC, and with the many restaurants to choose from, I'm glad I tried Totto Ramen. While you will have to wait, the service is fast and efficient. We arrived before they opened at 5pm and put our name down for a table. A number of people waiting didn't realize this at the time they arrived and ended up having to wait longer, so MAKE SURE to put your name down! ? I don't recommend this place for groups larger than 4 since seating is very limited and will make the wait time even longer. Our 20 min wait was well worth it- the noodles had just the right amount of "chew" and the broth was the real deal- I could taste hints of chicken stock even through the strong miso. The cuts of pork were fatty and melted in my mouth, just how it should.

While a great addition to the Hell's Kitchen area, Totto Ramen underwhelms for those who have tried ramen elsewhere, particularly the East Village area. ?Setagaya has been a favorite of mine for a while, even if the aesthetic is less bar than kitschy japanese joint (replete with ridiculous japanese commercials and game shows!). The broth in the Chicken Paitan is a little too chicken noodle soup for my taste, and the miso ramen -- eh. Pork is seared, but could be juicier? Haven't tried the spicy ramen yet, which apparently everyone loves, so I'll update soon! Overall, VERY reasonably priced for the area, and an okay introduction to ramen-virgins. Make sure to get there ahead of time to put your name on the list -- It's a very small joint with a very long line!

You know a place is doing something right when they have a line out the door at 8:30 PM on a Wednesday night even with a big fat "C" rating from the health department. ?It took 45 minutes to get a seat but it was worth it. ?Kinda peeved me off though to watch some girls lounging around pretending to drink their soup while there were about 30 people waiting outside. ?Seriously people, if you're done eating GTFO so the hungry people waiting on a cold, windy, night can eat. ?Anyways, back to the review :P They play some old school 80's music and the kitchen staff is very lively. ?The guy who was cooking up our ramen basically was dancing and singing the entire time. ?The pork was awesome, practically like bacon, fat, meat, fat, good! ?I ordered the extra spicy totto ramen and it honestly wasn't that hot. ?They basically just gave me a small cup of their hot sauce and warned me about how hot it was. ?Very tame stuff but basically turned my soup into one of those korean ramens after I mixed it all in. ?The ramen was cooked perfectly although I do wish I was given more than the cursory two pieces of pork. ?I also added the mushrooms and their "seasoned" egg, which is really just a tea egg. ?So for $13.00, I left happy, full, and hopefully without the runs tomorrow! ?We'll see how that "C" rating pans out.

After all the rave about this place, I decided that I MUST have some Totto Ramen. After a long long LONG wait standing outside, I was famished by the time I was seated. Unfortunately, after I visited the restroom to wash my hands, my appetite was quickly subdued by the wretched mess of a tiny bathroom with a slippery wet floor and foul smell. Not cool. I ordered the Miso ramen with chicken. Food came out in a timely manner, but failed to live up to the hype. The noodles itself were indeed delicious with perfect consistency. However, the broth blandly lacked character, and the chicken was dryly reminiscent of week-old deli chicken breast. I was forced to discard the meat after just one taste. I have not yet fully given up on this place, though. Perhaps I will give it another go in the future, and try a different dish. We will see.

This place is decent but I'm not sure what the hype is since I think Ippudo is better. Ramen = noodles + broth + toppings to a lesser extent. Noodles are good, but it's a ramen joint- so if they weren't then that would be unacceptable. The broth was ok.

After being disappointed by ippudo the day before, we waited in line for 1 hour for this hole in the wall on the sunday afternoon. We sat and quickly ordered niku ramen - SO MUCH MEAT! the noodles are AWESOME and the soup base is awesome. totto miso ramen - SO good and miso blended so well into the soup. totto spicy ramen - subtle spiciness that accents the flavor of the noodles I love this place! it was what i expected and came close to what I tasted in Tokyo. The soup was perfect, the noodles were perfect, the meat was perfect and so was the poached eggs! WILL COME BACK!

Whenever my Mom's family goes on vacations, it's my Dad and my Uncle Tony, who are always looking for that food icon of whatever city/town we are visiting. However, it's my Uncle Tony that's forever scanning the streets for that hole-in-the-wall. For those of you, who don't quite understand what a hole-in-the-wall is, look no further than Totto Ramen. With its questionable health grade of a C, those supergermaphobic folk like Ms. Pillsbury (pop culture reference...see Glee) should probably stay away. But for many, this health grade is just reinforcement of its hole-in-the-wall charm, only to be forgotten once your bowl arrives in front of you and you start slurping up those al dente ramen noodles. PS - Go with "a" friend, not 2 gazillion people literally. PPS - Keep in mind that if you arrive after 5:30pm, you're probably going to be waiting for at least an hour. The swarms of Manhattan are aware of where the hot ramen spots are. PPSS - Their broth is definitely one of the top broths in the city and for the meat lovers out there, you have to get that char siu pork, torched right in front of your eyes if you're able to get that choice seating at the bar.

Comfort is important to me when dining out. Reservations make me comfortable as I can't let extreme hunger influence my judgement on the food after waiting an hour for a table. Elbow room makes me comfortable since I'm awkward with my chopsticks. A place to put my jacket and purse makes me comfortable. Regulated temperatures make me comfortable. Not having patrons hover over me while I eat makes me comfortable. So what was I doing in this teenie ramen house that doesn't take reservations? Well, a girl needs to get her ramen fix every now and then. On a wet summer afternoon, the timing was right, as a friend and I arrived at Totto after the lunch rush and even still on this warm, muggy day, there was a short wait to get into this little place. We sat at the bar closest to the door and while I could feel the scorning eyes behind me of those still waiting to be seated, I was excited to witness the cooks in action. With my jacket and purse in lap, I watched the cooks torch my tuna sashimi and squid skewers. Good predictable appetizers but I really just wanted the ramen.. and then it came, piping hot, spewing steam into the already hot, muggy air inside. This was the first time I've had a chicken and soy sauce based broth and while I missed the feeling of having oil slicked lips after sucking down collagen loaded pork broths, this was a nice lighter alternative in the warm weather. However the peppery, spicy sesame oil that's added to the spicy ramen succeeded in making my eyelids sweat anyway. Complete with bouncy noodles, torched pork pieces, scallions, bean sprouts, and the obligatory nori piece, this was quite a satisfying bowl and at a wallet friendly price of $10.50. Nice to know that ramen can be found without having to trek downtown as I do enjoy a good bowl closer to home. The 30 minutes I did spend inside being totally uncomfortable was sure worth it.

Ramen lovers are split into 2 types: (1) Broth-lovers, and (2) Ingredient-lovers. Obviously anybody would say both are important, but you either lean towards one or the other. I'm a broth-lover. That means that if the broth is out of this world, then I'm okay with having mediocre ingredients (noodles, pork, etc.). Totto Ramen is for BROTH-LOVERS. The broth here is probably the best I've had in NYC, and definitely stacks up to the broth I've had at ramen joints in Tokyo. The fresh pork-bone flavor is evident throughout every drop of this fatty, milky broth of pure deliciousness. It comes out piping-hot and if you get the spicy Totto Ramen, it has the perfect amount of spice. When you make the Totto vs. Ippudo comparison, Totto's broth is definitely superior to Ippudo's. Where Totto falls a bit short, however, is in the ingredients. The noodles could have been a little more al dente. The chewiness made the ramen feel a little cheap. The char siu pork is just okay -- the fat isn't fatty enough, the meat isn't tender enough. The boiled egg was horribly boiled -- the yolk had a greenish layer around it, which is the #1 faux pas for a restaurant to have when it comes to hard-boiled eggs. In all of the ingredients, Ippudo is definitely better. So I'm torn -- was the deliciousness of Totto's broth enough to trump the mediocrity of its ingredients? Since I'm a broth-lover, it definitely does for me and I still thoroughly enjoyed every bite of my ramen. If you're an ingredients-lover, then I say proceed with caution before you end up waiting 2 hours for a ramen that you'll be disappointed with. In the epic battle between Totto and Ippudo for the best ramen in NYC, I'd have to give Totto the edge for its broth, but it's definitely close. Bring the battle to California, however, and both Totto and Ippudo lose miserably to the best ramen that Cali has to offer.

For the people who complain about the place being too small and the wait is too long for ramen, well guess what? That's what people do in Japan. It's part of the experience. Go to a popular ramen place in Tokyo and you'll be guaranteed to wait for awhile. This is the cultural difference between the Japanese and Americans. ?The food itself takes 10 minutes to eat, so most Americans would not consider waiting an hour for it. Learn some patience people! As most reviews have already stated the chicken broth yada yada yada, I'll spare you my descriptive review of the ramen. ?The only thing I have to say is I love the miso ramen here. ?The soup here is far more my preference than at Ippudo which is a tonkotsu based and heavier soup. Sorry for my rant about being patient about waiting, but I had to give my two cents on that. If you're not much about the wait, then go home and make yourself some instant ramen.

Well, if you have a bucket list - Totto Ramen belongs on it. Had the Totto Spicy Ramen - and it was just heaven. The noodles was pure ecstasy as it slowly chewed in your mouth. This isn't the soft type but more of a firm type like Minca. Ippeudo would be in between. But the noodles itself was amazing. TIP*** Order 'extra noodle' too for $2.50 it is a GREAT DEAL. The broth - WOW - you can literally just drink it like soup. You will find yourself uncontrollably drinking the soup without mixing it with the noodles. It just THAT good. And you know there's no MSG when you don't drink the ice cold water they give you. However, for people who don't tolerate spicy as much - you will drink water. Once of the most amazing broth ever, the spicy part is added to it, not cooked with it. But the spice part is not as 'natural' as the broth. You get to add chicken or pork. STICK with the PORK. The chicken although very fresh, can not compare to the taste of the pork. It just fixes much better with your ramen. Remember, there's a WAITLIST - don't just stand there aimlessly without signing in! If you plan to come at noon - it is a good idea to come at 11:30am(they open at 12pm) sign in first and then walk around and come back at 12pm. I counted the seats - they can only fit 8 people by the bar(individual stools), they have two 4 seater tables, and 1 two seater table. Groups more than 4 will be sit separately. Generally it takes 30 minutes for time food comes and you finish eating. The food comes less than 5 minutes after you order.

1.5: hours waited 20: seats available in this hole in the wall 3: times I said that I love the flavor of torched meat. ?They torch the char siu pork here! ?While some of the noodles come with it, I strongly suggest ordering the side. ?It comes over a bowl of piping hot white rice, with some yuzu mayo also. ?MMM! 1: ginormous bowl of noodles we each could not finish. ?This is comfort food if I've ever seen it. ?Freshest ramen I've ever had. Bottom line: expect a long wait/bring a snack. ?I'm not sure I would wait another 90 minutes to eat here.

Came here on a Saturday morning and got in with the first seating at noon. We were seated at the counter and while it was cool to watch the chefs cook ramen and stir the broth, it felt like a broiler in there. I literally could not stop sweating during the entire meal (gross, I know). We were right in front of two huge pots of boiling broth and seated far back enough into the restaurant that even with the front door open, no fresh air reached us. Despite the extreme temperature conditions, I would still love to come back--in the wintertime or on a not so hot day. But onto the good stuff... Ramen-wise, the noodles were nice and chewy and cooked perfectly. The broth was flavorful and made with high quality ingredients. I got the spicy ramen and let me warn you, it is HOT. The hot pepper-oil concoction was already poured into my bowl so I had no choice but to mix it up and brave the heat. It may not seem that spicy at first, but after a few big gulps of broth, you'll feel the heat. I definitely did, in more ways than one. After a while, I'm not sure if your tongue just gets use to the spiciness or some prolonged chemical reaction occurs in the broth, but it starts to taste less spicy and more sweet. Overall, it may have been a little too spicy for my taste, but still delicious all the same. Next time, I would opt for the extra spicy ramen. It's exactly the same as the spicy ramen except the spicy oil is on the side so you can add it to suit your taste. The interesting thing about this spicy oil is that it doesn't leave your tongue burning for a long time afterwards or a bad taste in your mouth. Surprisingly, your mouth feels really clean. Despite the 45 minute wait and the sweltering heat once indoors, I think Totto still deserves 5 stars. For the limited seating they have, they do an excellent job of moving customers in and out. Fast and efficient service and superior food gives Totto 5 for 5! If you're smart about it, you can minimize wait time and for me, that's where I think it's worthwhile to go. Either try to be the first round of customers of the day or go during the week during off peak times (avoid the lunch or dinner rushes).

Oh Totto, Why are you so packed all the time? I come here at least twice a month. When I am craving ramen. I've tried a few ramen places in the city (Ippudo, Momofuku, Sapporo,..) and this is by far the best. I like Totto due to the fact that is no MSG and not as salty. I recommend the Totto Miso Ramen. You have the option of choosing chicken or pork. If you're really hungry you can also get a side of extra noodles. I also recommend adding seaweek & spicy bamboo shoots as a side. Soo good for that extra kick at the end. Get here early as the wait can be up to 2+ hours. Off peak is usually a 45 min wait. If it's cold outside I get a beer next door at Aki Sushi, it sure beats standing in the cold. Bring cash! Lots of it, as I always wanna get my wait worth in my belly.

I've traveled pretty extensively in Japan (and lived in Asia for a year for work), so I've had plenty of great bowls of ramen and Totto Ramen definitely doesn't measure up. The food is underwhelming in almost every way. The broth is just okay, the noodles are weirdly thick and starchy, and the toppings are downright bad. It's a nice nod to authenticity that we have the option to add a seasoned boiled egg to our ramen, but it sure as heck shouldn't be hard boiled all the way through. (The yolk is supposed to be kind of runny, like this: http://bit.ly/nM3qz9). Don't drop a hard boiled turd in my soup and tell me it's a ramen egg, Totto. I was so disappointed the first time around that I came back a second time just to see if I had come on an off night, but nope -- the food was still mediocre. The only improvement between my first and second visits is that we now have the option to get chicken char siu on top of our ramen instead of just pork. Other than that, it was the same mediocre stuff I remembered from before. It's a mystery to me why New Yorkers will wait in such long lines for this place. I feel like a crazy person for having such a minority opinion here, but seriously: Ramen Totto is just not very good. This emperor has no clothes, people.

5 stars for the broth. Awesome. Refined, homey and comforting all at once. 3 stars for the pork bun. It seems like everyone is making a version of this Taiwanese classic. ?This does not stand out. ?Tuna don was delicious as the sauce and tuna were both light and vibrant. The star dish of course was the ramen. I ordered the spicy but I did drink my friends plain broth and mine own before I mixed the what I am guessing is good old Chinese spicy sauce with a lot of pepper. The three slices of pork were wanting in tenderness and perhaps potion. The scallions with the ramen were refreshing. All I can say is next time I am getting the everything ramen with more meat.

In the battle of Ippudo vs. Totto, Totto WINS (by a slight margin in terms of ramen... Ippudo has my heart when it comes to pork buns though). ?After enduring the obligatory 90 minute wait between the standing area outside the little plastic hut on the steps and the standing area inside the little plastic hut on the steps, it was finally Totto time. One similarity that I find between Totto and Ippudo is that they both always have inordinately long wait times... but they're both worth the wait - every time. It had been a few months since my list visit to Totto, so I ordered my go-to, the Totto Chicken Paitan Ramen. ?As is tradition, it was fantastic... though I promised myself that I'd try the Totto Spicy Ramen next time, as I've heard great things about it. ?I added the Kikurage Mushroom and an extra helping of Char Siu Pork to the ramen, which hit the spot - though next time I will try the Shredded Char Siu Pork, as the Char Siu Pork was a bit thick and unwieldy with the chopsticks (which are quality chopsticks, btw). The reason I think the ramen at Totto is slightly better than the ramen at Ippudo is purely based on the broth... the flavor is phenomenal at both, but the flavor at Totto just suits my palate a bit more... which is tough since Ippudo is a 3 minute walk from my apartment, but Totto is worth the hike IMO. I give it 4 stars only because I wish it was more easily accessible (i.e. that I could get it any time I wanted without waiting 60+ minutes outside), and I wish there was more space in there so that you could relax for a bit after your meal instead of feeling like you should get up so the next group sitting outside can get in and eat... but for ramen, Totto is tops in my book.

It was a hottttt day but I will suffer in a tiny bar-style ramen joint for some legit noodles + broth. Worth it! Totto spicy ramen with corn. Noodles were well cooked, and were fresh. I like the straight (non curly) noodles so this was a plus for me. Flavor explosion in your mouth. SO lucky that there was NO wait. It seriously was hot as balls though inside. The die hard ramen fiend in me doesn't care.

Awesome! Now that denying the arrival of winter is no longer feasible it's time to explore the avenues in which one can reasonably keep warm despite snowstorms and below freezing temperatures. Sure, staying indoors wrapped in a cozy blanket with a hot cocoa in hand is always a good option. But for those who prefer not to turn into a temporary hermit ramen houses are an ideal venue for getting together with friends. In most of Japan ramen is a quick meal. You'll find ramen shops near train stations where commuters will have a bowl on their way home after a long day at work. Often these places won't even have seating. All you see is a line of 'salary men' in their business suits behind a low curtain hungrily slurping down steaming bowls of noodles. And then there are cities like Hakata, where ramen making is an art form and ramen houses are destinations. Tonkotsu ramen is one of Hakata's claims to fame and it is this flavorful pork bone based broth that has become widely popular even in New York. There are talks of Ippudo opening a Midtown location but until then Totto Ramen on the west and Hide-chan Ramen on the east serve the best ramen north of Ippudo. And in some ways, Totto Ramen, more so than Ippudo, evokes the typical ramen experience from Japan. Unlike the flashy interior of Ippudo, Totto is cramped and rustic, so much so that the steam from the kitchen practically serves as the restaurant's main source of heating. Here the star is chicken instead of pork and the resulting broth is lighter, smoother, but equally flavorful and satisfying. The wait on any given evening will be more than an hour and the best strategy would be to sign up for a table and hang out at a nearby bar while you wait. Despite this, a bowl of Totto's spicy ramen is undeniably worth waiting for. Aside from these three ramen houses in New York, there are many more that have popped up in the last few years. Some can trace their roots from Japan and some rely on its celebrity chef for its popularity. But only these three deserve to be mentioned among the best. So take advantage of the cold weather and check out each mentioned in this list. Only then do you have the right to name which ramen spot you judge to be best.

I would give it a 3.5 if I could. So I heard a lot of things about Totto Ramen before being able to try it. Unfortunately the first thing I always here about is the wait. And yes, I also waited 1.5 hours. I would recommend getting there about 30 minutes before they open and putting your name on the clipboard in order to get in. The door greeter was a bit curt with the customers waiting in line, which I guess is understandable given there are a lot of customers waiting in line, but at the same time... kind of unacceptable... I guess not for New York. I ended up with the Niku Ramen (the one for meat lovers!). Totto Ramen is known for the chicken broth, and actually the broth was pretty good. I enjoyed the crushed garlic, the saltiness, and the onions in the broth. The ramen noodles are done al dente and are a bit thicker than the ramen I'm used to, which was fine. I actually appreciated that the pork came in chunks and they were definitely quite generous with the pork. The char siu was also flavored very well. Some of the pieces of pork were a bit tough though. The side of marinated avocados were good... I used to eat avocado that way when I was young. Not a bad place for ramen, but I must say a bit hyped up... and the long wait? Bring your Kindle.

Not as expensive as Ippudo and a slammin' slice of what I imagine can only be called "samgyupsal torchon". Slices of pork belly, similar to what you can get at Korean BBQ, par-grilled in bulk and then finished off with a couple seconds of attention from a searing hot can of fire. Noodles are nice and fresh, they get them daily in long trays full of little noodle-buns. The nice thing about this place also is that toppings tend to be cheaper than at other places. Avocado, egg, and bamboo shoots, and more run for only $1 each for a generous side helping. The only thing that isn't mindblowing is the broth, because there's only so much you can do with an old mother hen. But it's perfectly serviceable stuff. Back where I'm from, Orenchi Ramen in Santa Clara gets the same kinds of lines, has the amazing tonkotsu soup (but maybe not so amazing pork), a free goopy egg (but more expensive toppings), and a larger seating area. It's all about tradeoffs ... man, first world problems are hard. Tip: There's no shame in coming here by yourself, and you're actually likely to get seated much sooner for obvious reasons. I always hesitate to make ramen an excursion with more than about 4 people. It is, at its core, a traditional fast-food choice. Eat there at the counter, slurp the bowl until the dishboy can just put it back in the closet 'cause it's so clean, and get the hell out!

I was born and raised in Japan and have an affinity for ramen. ?Authentic, good ramen is not easy to come by in the States but Totto Ramen definitely fits the bill! ?I stopped in for a late lunch one Thursday and was able to walk right in and sit down at the counter. ?Everyone was very courteous and the service was prompt. ?The bowl of miso ramen with chiashu pork and corn was incredible. ?If you're at the counter you can watch them preparing the order and then appreciate how much work actually goes into preparing what most believe is just a bowl of noodles (like watching the chef cook the pieces of pork using a hand held blowtorch). ?For NYC this lunch was very reasonably priced and well worth any wait you might have. ?They have wifi as well but the place is very small/cozy. ?

Wow... this place has a lot of hype. Touted as one of the best ramen places in NYC, I waited hungrily outside the ramen shop with the highest of expectations. My wife and I strolled over from the MoMA on a relatively frigid Sunday and got there 15 minutes before the shop opened, only to see the plastic tent packed with other early arrivers and another handful of people already standing outside. We realized a bit late that we needed to put our names on a list somewhere inside the clutch of people who were probably the worst part of the experience. Not to hate on fellow ramen lovers, but some of you are douchey little fucks who need to get your mouths punched in and you do not deserve to eat food that is fit for kings. Have some courtesy people and stop trying to think that you are more privileged than anyone else. Anyway, once we got through the whole process of waiting in line (bring headphones, a Kindle, an iPad, whatever you do to pass the time), we sat down at the bar area and was greeted with the rich aroma of simmering broth and the crackling of hand torched char-siu. Immediately, the misery of the cold melted away and I was more ravenous than I was before. My wife astutely noticed a sign at the door that advertised an off menu ramen called the Niku Ramen, for the hungry and for the lovers of meat. If I belonged in a gospel choir I would have stood up right there and sang Hallelujah. The Niku Ramen is $15, served in a large bowl. In it are chunks, literally 2"x2" chunks, of deliciously soft fatty pork. They seriously took care of meat lovers... our side of char-siu was rendered completely unnecessary and almost overkill (still ate it all though). The ramen is served a bit al dente, with just the right amount of springiness and give, and swimming in a creamy, full-bodied broth that you can drink as a hearty soup. On top, you get a nest of soybean sprouts and green onions. The ramen here probably does deserve the title for best ramen in the city, but I don't know if I'm qualified to make that call. I'll just say its pretty damn good, and if you don't mind waiting an hour or more for Japanese fast food, you should definitely stop by and check it out.

Top notch ramen. I came here on a Thursday at 11pm and there was still a 30 minute wait. We considered ourselves lucky because both times my sister came, she waited 1.5-2 hours AND because we were the last customers of the night! Their hours say they close at 12am but, keep in mind that since they're so busy, they do cut off the wait list around 11:15pm in order to seat and serve everyone before closing. We both got the Totto Spicy Ramen with pork. The noodles came perfectly cooked (we ordered it to be firmer than it's usually cooked) and it was spot on. It came with two slices of thick cut fatty pork *drool* that was charred using a mini blow torch! The pork was so tender and the fatty bits just melted in your mouth! oh man..a moment on the lips and forever on the hips. BUT, never regrettable. I loved it. Hearty broth made with chicken stock rather than the traditional pork served with bean sprouts and some seaweed. You better believe we ordered an extra side of noodles! Prices were about $10/bowl. Definitely not cheap for ramen but, it's not like it would break the bank (at least I hope not for you). The spicy ramen definitely gave a nice kick to the noodles..I was sweating bullets after I finished and my mouth was on fire..I would hate to know what the extra spicy pork ramen was like! Service was so-so, food was great. I can see why this place has a line out the door!

Perhaps the finest ramen I have eaten in the United States; on par with anything I've had in Japan. Had the spicy Totto ramen. Waited half an hour to get seated, but the bowl arrived in less than 3 minutes. Sinfully fatty pork, noodles cooked to al dente perfection, sublime broth. A near-perfect bowl of ramen.

Was not impressed. Thought the broth was rather bland (and I like mild food), especially for ramen. Noodles were decently al dente, but char sui was nothing special. So why do people love this place? I don't understand the raves and the long lines. Honestly, I would not venture this far uptown and west to get Totto Ramen when there are more accessible and better ramen in St. Mark's.

Food was Great but sitting at the bar and watching the cook in the front, eat from the spatula, pick his nose and other disgusting things, just grossed me out.. Will probably never go back... This changes my mind of sitting by the stools next to the cooks.

Yummy ramen noodles, nice fresh with good ingredients on everything. The bowls are not the biggest but manageable, and not the most pricey. There seems to be a wait for 45 mins no matter what hours you go. Only a small bar seating which i'm sure is a heavy contributor to the wait. Probably one of the best ramen in the city, although i have to say there hasn't been a bowl of ramen that i've encountered that i absolutely hated ( i'm a ramen whore). Definitely a must try for any ramen lovers, if not only for the experience.

In our never-ending quest to stuff our faces with as much of New York's ramen offerings as possible, my girlfriend and I came here on a Tuesday night, hoping to catch some dinner before a show. ?Little did we know that Totto Ramen is notoriously busy, and even at the early bird special hour of 6pm, there was already a massive wait for a table for dinner. ?Since we had time constraints, we ended up at Kyotofu (http://www.yelp.com/biz/…) instead, vowing to return to Totto another day. Fast forward to this afternoon, when we made our way to 52nd St. at about 11:45, hoping to beat the lunch crowd for a coveted seat at Totto. ?Of course, there was already a line snaking nearly halfway down the block, and it was a good hour before we actually found ourselves seated at the bar. ?Undeterred by the "C" grade given by the department of health and determined to put these noodles -- which surely must be made out of gold -- into our mouths, we ordered a bowl of vegetable ramen and a bowl of spicy vegetable ramen, and waited. Lunch arrived quickly, and everyone attending to us was super-friendly, but we sort of felt like it wasn't worth the hoops we had to jump through. ?The broth was tasty, though there wasn't nearly enough of it, and the seasoned avocado was delicious, but otherwise? ?Some bamboo shoots, some enoki mushrooms, some bland tofu, a fistful of salad greens (what? ?really?) and a pile of al dente ramen noodles. ?Nothing to write home about, and certainly nothing worth waiting in the cold for an hour. ?Not in a city that Ippudo (http://www.yelp.com/biz/…) and Cocoran (http://www.yelp.com/biz/…) also call home.

Totto is one narrow hole-in-the-wall, even for New York: expect to rub elbows with fellow ramen lovers, or even pound shots together.* First time here? Add yourself to the wait list, then ask how long the wait is. Wander the neighborhood, but get back 15 minutes before the quoted time. If you're away when you're called you have to start over. Of their menu choices, their Totto Extreme Spicy Ramen ($10.50; cash only) is a treat. Its broth is rich and fatty, with scallions, savory char siu, bean sprouts, and nori mixed in. Their spicy sesame oil (brought on the side) makes the ramen more pleasing than piquant; thrill seekers may find their "Extreme Spicy" downright mild unless they double-up on the oil. In any case, I've never had ramen so deliciously peppery anywhere else, and that fact keeps me a regular here. Totto gets two chopsticks up. * Even the bathroom reminds me of an airplane lavatory. Want to join the Mile High Club (on the ground)? Hurry up, there's only one bathroom!

I never really got the hype around this place. ?I've been there 2 times already and each time I'm liking it less. ?I just don't like the fact that 1) you have to wait forever to get in, typically over 45mins, because they just won't expand the place 2) they always under cook the ramen. ?which makes it taste floury and nasty 3) they barely put any toppings in the ramen, which makes me think that they're really over charging you for just under cooked ramen, which is totally NOT cool 4) Ippodu and Sapporo are way better... at least they fully cook the ramen Not going back there again...

Totto Ramen. We waited an hour and twenty minutes for a bowl of springy curly ramen soaked in pork rich broth. (For reason see: http://www.yelp.com/biz/…) Yes, we sat and shivered as the chilly 30 degree weather forced us to huddle next to other hungry patrons while the inner door slammed onto the bench that we sat, we waited. We waited to try famed ramen that friends and strangers raved, that people scaled mountaintops for, that people would fight another for, that sort of ramen, we waited. When the long anticipated wait ended, we scurried to the inner confines of the tiny room, taking off the gloves to feel the fingers, we order. We slurped down the broth, the curly kinked ramen with crunchy bean sprouts, garlic sauce or miso mound, with torch seared char siu pork and looked at another. And we grinned. Several notes - Next Time- wait when it is warmer than 30. -The food comes out fast -Ippudo's tonkotsu broth has more flavor than to the miso pork ramen at Totto Ramen -I prefer Ippudo's noodle to the 'slightly wavy noodles' of Totto Ramen -I would like to try Totto Ramen's homemade noodles to compare

I'd travel to NYC just for this ramen. I'd get sick just so that I can sip on the broth. The ramen is simply scrumpdiddlyumtious!!! The broth was so creamy, flavorful and just delicious (I'm salivating as I am recollecting this). The place is quite small so exect to have quite a wait during busy times (-1 star). Everything is made in front of you and you know this place is authentic as the server writes his orders down in Japanese. I tried reading the order to see if he write down the right things but no such luck. Haha. I preferred totto to Minca.

My fave ramen spot!! It's definitely serious. I had a fling with Momofuku when they first opened but their broth has gotten significantly saltier and we've grown distant! It no longer feels homemade and fresh! I was never a huge fan of Ippudo, especially not of their huge dollops of ginger! I'm glad I finally found the right ramen spot for me. I just wish it didn't take forever to get a seat! I would suggest going there, writing your name down, getting their card (their number is saved in my phone) and then going elsewhere for some drinks. You can call them back periodically to see where you are on the list. This definitely beats standing outside for 1.5+ hrs. If you love the pork belly like I do, get the side order of it and watch them torch your meat to the perfect degree of deliciousness!

Came here on Thursday in the afternoon and I ended up waiting 45 min to an hour to be seated. ?The restaurant is small and can seat maybe a max of 20 people, but for the amount of the wait, the ramen just wasn't worth it. ? The hot soup was good in the cold weather, but it wasn't something i thought was worth waiting for. ?I only came because my friend said she really liked it here and had to come back, but i could have seriously ate at ANY other ramen place and would've been satisfied more than this place. ?The noodle was hard and tasteless, while the meat was overly chewy and overall.... it wasn't the best experience. ?The only reason I gave it an extra star, was because the hot soup made me feel better in the cold weather.

It might be a slight exaggeration to call Totto Ramen magical, but their spicy pork ramen did do more to cure a lingering throat cold than a week's worth of medication. I was almost persuaded away by the accounts of epic waits and rushed service, but as a party of 1, I was seated in about 10 minutes, and given all sorts of enthusiastic attention by the ramen magician behind the counter. I generally prefer a bit thicker style of noodle, but with such a rich, meaty broth complemented by the spicy sesame oil floating in a puddle in the middle of the bowl, I wasn't going to complain about, well, anything. I left in that cloud of comfort that only a really great bowl of soup can provide.

After waiting for a little over an hour, our names were finally called. I was starving... but boy, the wait was without a doubt worthwhile. I absolutely l-o-v-e TOTTO RAMEN! We started off with their apps and had the broiled char-siu and the avo tuna. Both dishes were delectable and modestly priced at $5. Then came our ramen.... The "totto spicy ramen" was amazingly flavorful. It had the right touch of spiciness to it (not too much where it overwhems your tastebuds). The bowl of ramen was topped with scallions, char siu pork, bean sprouts, and nori. The savory broth and the toppings combined made the perfectly cooked al dente ramen noodles ?taste like heaven's dancing on your tongue. I just wish they could expand their restaurant because then the wait wouldn't be too bad. ?I think they could only ?seat ?22ish people at once... Still, I'm coming back with the anticipated wait times and all. For the record, Totto is better than Ippudo.

Oh Totto Ramen..you are the only food establishment I have willingly waited for in the blistering east coast weather. I always ordered the spicy totto ramen and avo tuna appetizer. The charsiu pork they give you here is the BEST I have ever tasted. The slabs are thick! Eat it right away and you can taste the crispiness of the fat after they torch it. I hate avocado, but their avo tuna appetizer is amazing. The flavors are so clean and simple, but everything balances each other so well. The avocado is fresh and mixes blends with the crunchy brean sprout and spring onions. The spicy ramen has such delicious broth I'd drink the whole thing! I was a huge ippudo lover before this place came along. Highly, highly recommended. This place is one of the main reasons I hope to return soon :)

Totto Ramen, let me count the ways I dislike you. 1. Whose bright idea was it to house a restaurant in a place the size of my apartment? In New York! Where we truly discover how many people there are in Manhattan when the cowbell rings for dinnertime. 2. Disorganized service. ?Everytime I come, someone messes up my order. ?Today's service was no exception, as one of our orders was forgotten, and the waiter topped it off by chasing after us to ask us to put more tip, when we had already put down enough. 3. Food. ?I honestly think Ippudo, Minca, and Hide Chan are better. ?The torched meat is a nice touch, but it's really not 90 minutes worth of a wait. ?Even if the $15 ?Niku-Ramen (meat lover's ramen which has about 3 different types of pork) redeems Totto Ramen for its stingy seating space, I'd take the above three restaurant's ambiance and hospitality over it, any day.

Easily the best ramen I have ever had. ?EASILY. ?And this is having been to ramen places in Japan, that locals recommended. Get the uber pork meat special. ?It comes with char siu (actually torched to get that awesome bit of smoke), some stewed loin chunks the size of a kid's fist, and some belly. It is a LOT of meat. ?And all of it is perfectly tender. Then there's the noodles. ?They have a great chew to them. The broth is excellent. ?Very meaty. ? On the side you MUST get the rayu. ?It's a spicy, peppery sesame oil. ?Add it to your bites of meat. ?It's easily worth the dollar extra. ? As far as the wait, put your name on the list, and go somewhere for a drink.. ?Each half page takes about half an hour. ?You'll be much happier going in than if you waited out front the whole time. And even if you do wait out front the entire time, it is completely worth it. ?Thank god Winter Is Coming.

Not really sure how this place has $$, really its more like $. Guaranteed you will wait in line. Even if it's raining. Luckily they have a covered doorway before you enter. MAX PARTY= 4. DO NOT attempt to come with 5 people. There are about 5 options of ramen soup on this menu ($9-13), all of which you can add additional toppings too. ($0.50-$2 extra) SOO many waiters, everything goes by fast. When you sit down, you will be asked what you want. ?It's great you can see the wait staff cook as you eat at the bar. One complaint- the chicken that came with my ramen was not good. it was overly dry and it had been sitting in broth for 15 minutes. I heard the pork is better. be prepared to eat your soup with a Japanese miso soup spoon and chop sticks. GOOD LUCK

Totto Ramen, located 2 blocks from my place of work is one of my favorite indulgences for the lunch time hour. ?The only problem is the wait is 45 minutes making my 1 hour lunch break inadequate.... Thankfully, I've figured out a couple of ways to get around this (run, add to list, come back 30 minutes later) and eat here for a special treat every few weeks. Ignoring the queue issues, this place is pretty adorable. ?It seats only 20, 8 of which sit right up against the kitchen bar where all the food is prepared. ?Not only do you get lunch, you get a show of blow torching char siu, large drums of violently boiling soup, and a finely tuned team of ramen-makers. ? Once you've finally scored a seat and taken in your surroundings, a tremendous flavorful bowl of al dente noodles will be set in front of you. ?The portions are generous, the food is delicious (and not just the ramen, try the squid or tuna appetizers), and the service is fast and with a smile. ? The only reason Totto gets 4 stars instead of 5 is the long wait time (is this a ramen thing? ::cough:: Ippudo ::cough::) and that they don't serve soft boiled eggs in their soup. ?Other than these two mini-qualms, I'd highly recommend Totto to anyone with some extra time and an empty stomach.

I've decided to pick Totto Ramen as my first yelp review among many others because this is the best ramen place I've tried so far in NYC. I am a huge ramen person, and Totto has what I am looking for-- great taste, reasonable price, and good portion. I like the Totto Spicy Ramen and the Totto Miso Ramen. Here's a tip on Totto Miso Ramen-- it comes with some sort of bean paste topping. I'd put that aside and add only what is needed, simply because you can taste and enjoy the broth better without over-masking it with additional flavors. I've also been told recently by another yelper, (thanks Lili), that you can choose between straight or curly ramen. Of course, with any great places to eat, you'll have to wait... and I mean wait! Average wait time for me in the past-- somewhere between 1-2 hours. I wouldn't recommend going there with more than 4 ppl, or they will have to split you into different tables.

Yum. Just got back from a really wonderful, satisfying meal here. Perfect heart warming dinner for a cold and rainy October day! My friend and I got here at 5:30 on a Sunday and we waited 1.5 hrs in line for a table. The wait was pretty painful, it would be hard to come back here again with such a long wait, but the food was really fantastic and cheap. We shared an (side) appetizer of the Char Siu Mayo Don- WOW. Such an interesting mix of flavors. I really enjoyed it, as much if not more than the Ramen. My friend and I both ordered the Totto Spicy Ramen. I really loved the spicy sesame oil. YUM. We were super full by the end of the meal and could barely finish our Ramen! Next time I would avoid the long wait times by putting my name down before they open! Also, FYI they don't have to-go containers, so bring either a large appetite or bring your own! Cash ONLY.

Eat it and believe. Totto Ramen is a crowded, busy restaurant spitting out tasty bowls of chicken-broth ramen to the clamouring crowds. ?I like the creaminess that a little miso adds. ?My dining parner got the "extra spicy" bowl (which was fairly spicy but no one would be injured by eating it). Good quality ingredients and the add-ons look to be less expensive than the competition. One of my favorites.

This line is insane, this place gets so much hype, etc., there's no way it could live up to expectations right? ?Well, I was still intrigued, I just HAVE to try this otherwise my opinion will never matter in the office cooler ramen conversations. So on a day off, I actually went back to midtown (I usually avoid it at all costs when not working) just to try out the ramen. ?Despite getting there before lunch opening, I still had to wait another 30 minutes since I didn't get into the first wave of customers. I finally get my seat and the waiter comes over, I eye the menu, I love lots of meat, so the Niku was an easy choice. ?I ask him if there are any appetizers he recommends with it, he says "no way man, it's a big ass bowl." ?Okay, good deal, he didn't try to upsell me. When it came out, uh, yes, it was a big ass bowl of meat and noodles. ?I dug into it and what I noticed immediately was the texture of the noodles. ?Out of all the popular ramen spots in NY, the noodles here had this firm texture which made it my favorite. ?I thought the meat was good, but not quite five star quality; maybe it was diminishing marginal returns because it was so much. ? Overall, if you're a ramen fan, this place needs your attention just for the noodles itself. ?If you're lukewarm on ramen, then waiting in this line isn't going to make you like it more... And for the record, I did finish all the meat and noodles and was immediately in a food coma. ?Walking back to the subway I felt like I was going to puke it was so much...

Disappointing. I came here mid-afternoon on a Sunday. I was surprised to find the restaurant situated in a sub-basement (few steps down from the street), is ?cramped (I got to know my neighbors well), and the decor is more attuned to St Marks than midtown west. I ordered the Totto Spicy Ramen and Char Siu Chunks. Given the reviews and the 25 minute wait, I expected a lot. When I received my ramen, it was like they took already salty ramen and poured on a pot of salty chili oil to make the soup spicy. In other words, my ramen was super salty with a layer of chili oil floating on top. The Char Siu Chunks were mostly fat and not as tender as I'd have expected - my friend and I ate one piece and left the rest. I hear the Broiled Char Siu Pork is amazing, but did not try it. Next time I'm in midtown Manhattan and am dying for ramen, I'll probably go to Menchanko Tei instead.

I had to come here because of the reviews I've seen, ranking Totto Ramen among the best ramen shops in NYC, even hitting the #1 spot on a few lists I've encountered. My top two had always been Hide Chan and Ippudo. I'd been meaning to come here for over a year to see if it matched, but I just never found myself out in this area. Plus, I heard the waits can be pretty tough. I finally made it. My top two are still Hide Chan and Ippudo. Totto falls in the top 5, maybe even clinching the 3rd spot, but a distant 3rd. I came on a Tuesday at 7pm, and the line was only 20 minutes. Not bad, so chalk that up as a win as compared to Ippudo where I've never seen less than an hour wait at most normal eating hours. I ordered the char siu pork, the spicy ramen, had a kaedama (extra noodle), and then ordered the chicken ramen as well. Yes, I'm serious. You'd think that was because the food was so delicious I couldn't stop eating, but overall it was good, but not the best. The pork was interesting; they used a blow torch to put the final touches on it. It was tasty, but I wouldn't shy away from a bit more fat on it. Also, the slices were cut a bit thin and I think this may have made them taste a bit dry to me. Also, they presented it on a slice of lettuce with some bean sprouts. I don't know what to think of that. The spicy ramen broth was interesting. I optimize for porkiness in my ramen broth, which is why I love Hide Chan and Ippudo. There was definitely pork flavor, but more striking was the spicy flavor they added. It was garlicky, peppery, and spicy, although a bit overpowering. Tasty, but I prefer stronger pork flavor. The chicken ramen was okay. I liked the strong chicken flavor, but the chicken itself was dry which I suppose is expected. But the part that really brings them down a notch to me is the ramen consistency. At my top 2, I get perfect noodles every time. At Totto, each of my noodle servings was slightly different consistency, ranging from slightly mushy to slightly too al dente (don't forget I got 3 servings between 2 bowls + kaedama). This is something a top ramen shop has to get right. I'd come back here again, but only if I was in the area - which is rare - and the line was less than 30 minutes. Like I said: it's a top 5 ramen shop, but I've got my top 2 already.

I found myself and a friend waiting for over an hour for ramen here on a Tuesday night around 8pm....yeah, who would've thought I'd grow up to wait this long for RAMEN! ?Ok - don't expect (good) appetizers, this is truly just for ramen. ?There are 3 apps on the menu, we got them all - and I didn't like any of them - the pork may have been OK. The noodles were as great if not better than Ippudo. ?The broth was different and they had more of an interesting selection for additional toppings., I got the spicy ramen with bamboo shoots & egg. ?I just wish they had better apps! ?Maybe I'm just spoiled by the buns at Momo and Ippudo...

WARNING: wait time for this place is silly. go on a night when you have some time to kill! I went on a night where my boyfriend and I walked around and browsed the amish farmers market around the corner for about an hour. It was a Tuesday night, and there was only the two of us, and it took about An hour and half to sit at the bar. It is really tiny inside, so no wonder the wait is so long. The waiters and cooks were very attentive and friendly, actually conversing with us while we waited and asked how we enjoyed our food while we ate. Hey, they actually care! I ordered the Totto Miso Ramen ($10.75) with extra Rayu ($2, spicy sesame oil) and my boyfriend got the Totto Spicy Ramen ($10.75). We watched the cooks prepare the food and were amazed at how swift they moved at preparing each order! It was actually entertaining. One little splash of hot water that the noodles were being cooked in hit my arm (which did not burn me at all) but the cook felt so badly that he gave us a complimentary plate of Char Broil Siu Pork... I'll take it! The broth was really savory, not too salty, and the ramen was cooked to perfection. I've been to other competing ramen places (Ippudo and Mitswa in NJ) and this places wins! :) REMEMBER... CASH ONLY!

Been here 3 times in the last 10 days, but only ate twice. The only reason it wasn't 3 times is because their ramen is SO GOOD, that they ran out and closed early at 9pm. Whyyyyy?????? I've had both the regular Totto ramen & the Spicy Totto ramen both with char siu. The noodles are cooked al dente and have a nice chew to them. The char sui is blow torched to the perfect sear and is to die for! So good that the hubby said he wants Totto ramen to be his last meal on earth. Yes, the wait is long, but so worth it. Instead of waiting in front of the restaurant for 1 hr, put your name down and go run an errand so you don't feel like you're wasting time. Don't be ashamed to come alone, chances are you'll get a seat much faster and will get to watch the cooks in action from the bar. Totto ramen, please open up in the San Jose / Bay Area!

Was pretty average ramen. ?I had the spicey totto ramen or whatever and the soup was very light and bland. ?I suppose if your into that kind of thing you could check it out. To me however, the wait of upwards 1.5 hrs is not worth it. ?The guy never filled my water after the initial cup on the table, was thoroughly let down. Stick to Ippudo, Men Kui Tei or anything for that matter, bc the wait here is a waste of your time.

Went there on a Saturday night after watching a Broadway show. Got in the door just as they were accepting the last 2 or 3 people for their waiting list before they closed. Stood outside in the little alcove space for about 20 mins or so before being seated. But once seated, service was great! Everything was on the table in minutes. The brothful was flavorful but not as good as Ippudo in my opinion. The noodles were great and overall, I loved the experience and would definitely go back! The highlight of my meal was the torched pork belly.

It's good for its chicken broth as suppose to Ippudo with it's pork broth. Beware, they skip you in line if you're not there when they call you. Ordered the pork buns which were okay. Not as flavorful as I would have liked them to be. They claimed that they don't use MSG but I'm sure they use the chicken powder which is similar to MSG. It's good ramen, not the best, and they have very limited options. Tiny place but really crowded. They don't accompany more than 4 people. ?Don't be scared of the long lines since many people ?get frustrated and leave.

Spicy Totto Ramen. Glorious, glorious spicy ramen. More, please! The wait is indeed long so put your name down, which is a task in itself, and once done, get yourselves a drink nearby. This spot is tiny so limit yourself to 4 people max. I recommend sitting at the bar, where you can watch them work. Flame-torching the pork is quite a sight! Just go, already!

Totto Ramen, there is so much hype over this place for what I got out of my experience. ?Got there around 4:45 to already be 15th on the waiting list then waited an hour and a half to get seated. ?The place itself is quite cozy and small. I had to try the extra spicy Totto Ramen. I found it strange that you had to mix in the amount of spice yourself and really the bowl was definitely not up to par with the joy I thought it would bring. Was craving more spiciness and more veggies inside. ?I am crazy over Ramen but Totto fell short. ?I did try the ahi and avocado appetizer which had its own interesting flair. All I'd have to say is "been there, done that" -- Have to try some Ippudo to see if it up to its hype.

I don't know about you but being up all night with rip roaring diarrhea is not my idea of fun. This is what happened after dining at Totto. I wanted to try this place for a long time because there is always a long line out the door and it is conveniently located close to my apt. I ordered the spicy ?ramen. It was overly greasy. It was pretty much fat floating in a bowl with noodles in it. It is about as fatty as the broth from Ippudo ( which I think is overrated). Anyway, after eating the whole thing(I was starving) the diarrhea ensued. Will not be returning.

4.5 stars How long would you wait for ramen? We waited an hour and a half! Thank God it was one of those perfect evenings in NYC when you wouldn't mind standing outside. Just. Standing. And waiting. Everyone that came out of Totto Ramen had smiles on their faces and with each name that got crossed out on the paper list brought me closer to my ramen bowl. This place has a seating capacity of about 20-22 (including counter style seating in front of the kitchen) so I wouldn't advise big groups to come here, or if you do, expect to be split up. The avo tuna was to DIE for. Coming from California, I've had my fair share of avocados and this appetizer had big slices of avocado and lightly seared tuna, with yuzu garlic sauce and garlic pieces, this is surely not to be missed, even though the sliced chives were too overpowering. The grilled ika (squid) had a nice char to it and again topped with garlic. This place loves their garlic and I LOVE that! the squid was very tender. Now, for the ramen. WOW. I had the Totto Spicy Ramen which had the tastiest broth I've ever had in ramen to date and they don't use MSG! (unlike Ippudo) It's a chicken based broth, with scallions, onions and slices of char siu pork. I requested the chili oil to be served on the side as I am a wuss when it comes to spicy things. So, it all boils down to the question: which is better, Ippudo or Totto? I grew up with MSG in my diet so it doesn't really bother me, but for people who are sensitive to it, Totto would be the clear winner. It's also $2-$3 cheaper. ?I slightly prefer Ippudo for the ambiance and they have more choices on the menu, but I wouldn't wait that long for ramen again.

Oh boy. ?The Ramen here is delicious. ?I don't even know where to start. ?You know that feeling when your mouth waters just from thinking about something good? ?Yea. ?I'm doing that right now writing this review at work. ?Good thing I'm in a cube, or someone might think I'm staring at something fishy. I ordered the Totto Spicy Ramen (always gotta order the item with the restaurant's name on it right? ?That's just the most accepted option? ?I don't know, shut up! ?i'm no restaurant connoisseur, Just a yelping ninja.) ?This Ramen is good man. ?The broth is really peppery (which i like), comes with a bunch of ingredients you would expect to find in an authentic Japanese Ramen bowl. ?The PORK, oh man. ?Nice and thick fatty piece of pork makes this bowl of love... excellent. ?I'm a stickler for noodles, and these noodles are of good size, dexterity and consistency. ?They're not Angel hair pasta style, nor are the Pad see ewe thick and greasy. ?They're real ramen style and size noodles. ?The bowl's also got a slight kick to the broth (not spicy at all really) that leaves a refreshing after taste on your palate. ? We got other side dishes, like a Tuna bowl (delicious). ?A chashu prok appetizer (damn, more pork? ?hells yes.) ? You're gonna be hard pressed to find better ramen in the city. ?Honestly, I think it's better than Ippudo. ?I wasn't really impressed by Ippudo, but my goodness. ?Totto left me very happy. Here's the absolute only reason I can't give this place 5... The insane wait. i've been here 3 times, I've waited an hour 30, an hour 15, and 45 minutes. ?That's insane. ?It's just a bowl of ramen. ?You can't justify waiting that long for food....

This place is amazingly good. Were it not for that BEATCH of a line that creeps along like a hot sleepless summer night, you'd be reading a 5 star. Still, after waiting 60 mins by myself :( i finally got a seat at the bar. Having read the 5 item menus multiple times over the prior 60 mins, I knew quickly what to get. EXTREME SPICY NOODLE. It was extreme, it was spicy. And to add to the misery of spice, I had them add extreme spicy bamboo. HOLY CRAP. I was sweating, I was slurping, I was salivating, I was LOVING. I also had the tuna tartar appetizer which was delicious. And 2 Sapporro beers. All this? Only 23 bucks. Hell yeah.

The Ramen is very good here and is priced well. A few provisos... 1. They have a 'C' for their restaurant sanitation grade. for what it's worth, the details are: Cold food item held above 41? F (smoked fish and reduced oxygen packaged foods above 38 ?F) except during necessary preparation. Evidence of mice or live mice present in facility's food and/or non-food areas. Tobacco use, eating, or drinking from open container in food preparation, food storage or dishwashing area observed. Food contact surface not properly washed, rinsed and sanitized after each use and following any activity when contamination may have occurred. Non-food contact surface improperly constructed. Unacceptable material used. Non-food contact surface or equipment improperly maintained and/or not properly sealed, raised, spaced or movable to allow accessibility for cleaning on all sides, above and underneath the unit. 2. Wait times. You are probably best off getting to the restaurant at 11:30a, sign your name(s) on the wait list and wait until noon to get in. We got there at 11:45a, and had to wait another 45 minutes. Consider this before you trek over at 1p and expect to get sat right away, it won't happen. 3. Portions. Probably on the small side, if you expect a huge bowl of ramen, the size of many pho soups, this place does it on the smaller end. I'd recommend getting something in addition to one of the ramens. Still, I would definitely recommend Totto.

I love noodles - most of all Totto Ramen's noodles!! It's a very simple set-up: you get there, scribe your name on a clipboard list and wait nearby for your name to be called. WORD OF CAUTION: if you step away when they call your name, it's game over and your wait has to start all over. As for the food, the veggies are fresh and the soup is delish. ?I LOVE the fact that they have a true vegetable option, loaded with greens and healthiness. ?Believe it or not, this is kind of hard to find.

I love Totto Ramen! In terms of the vegetarian ramen, Totto Ramen is definitely better than Ippudo. For a tiny place, the restaurant handles things very well. There were several waitresses, two people making ramen, and 1 person managing the waiting list and cleaning up tables. My hubby and I waited for over an hour, so we were going to the "hangry" mode. We decided to order rice bowls in addition to ramen.Totto Ramen has delicious rice bowls. I highly recommend them since the portions are large and for a reasonable cost. We tried the spicy tuna ($5.50) and the uni rice bowl ($6). The spicy tuna bowl was huge! They used a large ice cream scooper for the spicy tuna. I'm glad I got more since the spicy tuna was delicious. My hubby liked the uni rice bowl since the uni was very fresh. As with the ramen, I thoroughly enjoyed the vegetable ramen ($11.50). It came with various vegetables, seasoned avocado, mushrooms, and a konbu seaweed and shiitake mushroom base. Delicious broth. The flavor was so clean. My hubby approved of this dish. He liked it better than his own. He ordered the chicken paitan ramen with pork ($9.50). He said that the ramen was good, but the chicken broth was too much "chicken" flavor. Cash only place.

So good! Seriously the noodles were $11 each (way cheaper than Ippudo) and the line is only about 30 minutes on a good night (week night, Wednesday). They don't take parties more than 4 people so be prepared to split up - definitely worth it! Place is small/dingy, but service is ridiculously fast...it seemed like they were hurrying us, but I didn't mind because the noodles were so good.

There are a lot of things that you feel like you just have to try once, so you ?tried, and then what? I enjoyed the ramen while I was not particularly impressed with it. The broth was not that greasy, the taste was well-balanced, but is it really better than instant ramen I occassionally cook at home? Absolutely NOT. So please, set your expectation low. I waited for an hour and 20 minutes, but that's ok, I was reading a good book and listening to Exile's songs while waiting. And I tend to not judge too harshly and just chill. Totto is so tiny and the seating was super tight and uncomfortable. Seriously Totto belongs to East Village not Hell's Kitchen. I would rather go to Momofuku in EV though. Waiting for over 1hr was an experience, however bitter and spicy it was, I will not come back again.

My wife and I love Japanese food and Ramen is a big part of it. ?Being spoiled by our numerous visits to Japan and the high standards of Santouka back in LA that closely resembles the taste of authentic Japanese Ramen, we weren't really expecting much when we visited Totto on our NY trip. ?It was a cold day, we're starving after a long walk, and the line has been LONG... ridiculously long. ?The restaurant itself is tiny and we had to wait til the end of the 2nd round til we could sit, well, pack ourselves into the bar, which I really enjoy 'cause that's really is the way in Japan! :) We were then greeted with the freshly charred smell of torched fatty pork. ?It's an indistinguishable smell that makes you drool. ?That smell alone should be good enough to convert a vegetarian over and down a plate full of it good. ?I ordered my usual miso ramen and my wife got her chicken stock ramen, and both were nothing short of amazing even with our high expectations regardless of the long wait and everything. ? It is now officially on our list of MUST GO places when we're in NY and easily worth a trip there when we're in town. ? SOLID 5 FULL STARS without hesitation

I thought this was the best ramen I've had. We went to Ippudo the day before and liked it, but after coming here...I gotta give the award to Totto. We waited a loooong time (a little over an hour) in the freezing rain + snow, but let me tell you...it's worth it. The broth is so delicious, and I really liked the noodles here. I got the spicy ramen, which was excellent, but definitely spicy!! We also got the Spicy Tuna Don, which was surprisingly good.

Think of it as the best Chicken soup you'll probably have. It's a chicken based broth - that makes it different from all the other ramen joints which are typically pork based broths. Expect to wait - even at noon when they opened, there were 25 people outside (only seats about 20 people). ? Do not come in groups larger than 4 - they will separate you. Put your name on list - but be there, else you go to the bottom of the list (or so their sign says) if ur name is called and you're not there. It's a very clean chicken broth - they strain out all the nastiness. ?Frankly, I wish they had a different dirty fatty-goodness version of their soup. ?I saw at the beginning the guy scooping out some darker colored soupy goodness from the vat to discard - frankly, I wanna eat THAT. ?That looked good. You can add toppings at 1 or 2 dollars per to customize. If you're not sure you want the spicy, get the spicy topping on the side and add in to taste. I wish Totto now would make a pork broth too, since I still prefer pork based broths. ?Now that would be sick. ?That might even garner my oh-so-coveted...FIVE-STAR rating.

Honestly, this place is all hype. ?People think that the long line means it's amazing and exclusive, but it's so not worth waiting more than an hour for a bowl of noodles that is decent but not in any way remarkable. I actually thought the noodles were underdone (and yes, I'm familiar with the Japanese style of noodle which tends to be cooked firmer, but there's a difference between that al dente ramen style and being undercooked). ? The chashu was 90% FAT, which is far from the ideal meat-fat ratio. ?The miso broth was good but lacked that signature dimension of saltiness-- I could taste more of the sweet alcoholic fermentation of the miso and not the prominent salty note that's typical of miso ramen. I understand that the kitchen was probably trying for a more refined version of miso than the typical salt bomb, but I think they missed the mark a bit here. ?Minus points also for their menma, which had a weird (indescribable) aftertaste and their rough diagonal cuts of scallions, which just looks sloppy. ?Bean sprouts seem to be in every bowl, and for me, that is the mark of cheap filler. Sorry Totto, you need refinement.

The last time I was here (bubbling with excitement) - the wait was an insane 1.5 hours. Gave up and left, like an absolute reject. This time round, with more scheming, I returned with two friends 30 minutes before its opening (brimming with excitement). Felt really proud being the second person to place my name on the wait-list (remember to add your name to the wait-list, may be go do some shopping in times square, and it will be your turn to dine). Camped outside of the ramen bar, thinking about how awesome the Totto Spicy Ramen would taste like, in such a cruelly cold winter day. 12 noon - finally got into the ramen bar. Were the first to place our orders. Ramen promptly served (quantity slightly smaller than expected). Started eating - the broth tasted heavenly. The chili shrimp paste added a rich flavour to the broth. The noodles were chewy enough. Chicken slices were tender enough. Nonetheless, towards the end of the meal, my emotions had not reach their epitome. How sad. Perhaps, I was expecting too much from Totto Ramen. At least, I could tell my friends that I have tried the much-raved-about Totto Ramen.

This was the first Japanese restaurant I tried after spending over five months in Tokyo. ?I was honestly pretty tired of ramen when I was in Tokyo because I had so much of it in the beginning, but I was pleased with this place. Wait: about 1 hr from 8 PM on Saturday night, pretty reasonable. Soup: very rich broth. ?"Umami" would probably be a good word to describe it. Ramen: nicely cooked Pork: I ordered an extra serving because I was hungry, but it really wasn't that good Egg: was pretty plain, was expecting a little more from the egg Green onions: not good, would not get this again Basically, the essential ingredients were good, and all the toppings were disappointing, and I'll skip them next time. I ate about 1/3 without any hot sauce, and then I may have added a little too much, as I couldn't taste much of the soup any more. ?I think I'll go for plain next time. I'll probably go back at least once.

I can't stop thinking about this ramen after I had it last night. The broth, the homemade noodles, and crispy pork slices. Scrumptious. There will be a line. (apparently there is one at all times) But I really think it is worth the wait. It is very narrow as people have said so watch out if one is claustrophobic. Now, all I kept thinking was how perfect this would be in the winter...and how agonizing the waiting would be in the snow...but when you sip that spicy broth, your body will thank you.

Two reasons why I knew this place had to be good before even sitting down: 1) People were exiting the restaurant sweating with soup stains splattered all over their shirt. 2) The people waiting outside for a seat started clapping each time someone finished their meal and left the restaurant. THIS WAS THE BEST RAMEN I HAVE EVER HAD. Granted, I've never been to Japan, but I am a ramen lover and I know good ramen when I taste it. Totto makes you wait. My bf and I went on a Friday night around dinnertime and had to wait over an hour for a seat. The wait was well worth it and you don't even care that this place is tiny and really hot and poorly ventilated inside. The broth is thick and almost gravy like, the pork is super soft with amazing fat. I ordered the Spicy Ramen and I usually douse my soup with sriracha, pepper, lime juice and fish sauce for extra flavor but did not add a single thing to my Totto ramen. It's perfect. I took pictures of it on my phone just to remember how perfect it was. If I lived in NY, I'd be a regular.

I'm still licking my lips. Sorry ippudo. Its not you it's me. Well, it's really totto ramen. What got me was the addictive hot sauce. I hate plain ol' chili oil that delivers nothing but painful heat. Not so at totto! The little unassuming ramekin contains stuff dreams are made of, my dreams at least. There's a bunch of cracked peppers and mysterious bits of yummy things at the bottom, that creates this symphony of spice and slow spread of flavor in your mouth. I cant be positive, but I see black pepper (and lots of it) which would be what produces this unbelievable warm heat in the back of the throat that I can't get enough of. Or it might simply contain crack, which would explain why I'm still high from this bowl of ramen. Mmmm. Oh, and get NAMA WAKAME on top. You can thank me later.

Yea yea yea, I had the Extreme Spicy Ramen. Definitely didn't love the spaghetti-like texture and thickness of the straight noodles, and I almost never have a point of contention with a good ramen house's noodles. I don't care if they're wavy, straight, hakata style, or whatever else you can throw at me, but here, I finally met a noodle to avoid. I also thought the chicken shoyu broth was just interesting at best, and the "char sui" was a little tough. ?BUT. Let's face it, this place has like a million reviews, and it's a matter of personal taste, plus I think that chicken broth is the kind that'll grow on you. Now let's talk about the freaking glorious Yaki Uni Don. Sure, the lightly torched Uni was about the size of my thumb, but it was sweet, fresh, and damn. What a wonderfully constructed little bowl for $6. So what to do? Loved the Uni, thought the ramen was mediocre, the wait was long, but the service was good. Let's stick with a 3.

Good ramen. ?Love the broth, it's rich, but not too oily. ?We waited about an hour and half to get seated because we thought it opens at 5pm on Sunday (website hours). ?It turned out it opens at 4pm! ?I am rating it 4 because I didn't enjoy the meat as much. ?The Char shui pork was not to my standard. ?I had much better ones elsewhere. ?Otherwise, everything else was good.

The ramen was the best ramen I've ever had. ?AND the food was actually cooked by Japanese people! ? So I knocked off a star because of the itty bitty portions. ?I mean, I was full after eating, but for $9 - $15, I would expect much bigger bowls, you know? ?My bowl came with three pieces of chicken (not hating, but if you can eat like a beast, this will definitely not fill you up). ?The two extra char siu "chunks" (aka pork belly) that the boyfriend got were a buck each in addition to his ramen - which by the way were very fatty, but tasty... although again, not worth $2. ? Also, I knocked off another star because they ran out of tuna. ?I didn't get to order the Spicy Tuna Don OR Avo Tuna. ?If you know me or read my other reviews about sushi, I absolutely love tuna. ?But get this, two people who came in after us were able to get it. ?I'm not sure if one of the owners came back with more tuna when we were unfortunately done with our meal or what, but we were seriously disappointed we didn't get any tuna (particularly because we had to wait 30 minutes to be seated). ? Speaking of the wait, it is insane. ?You sign your name on the list and wait with a bazillion other people in the front until the next table is available (which typically varies from 15 minutes to 30). ?When you get called in, seating is absolutely uncomfortable and space is teeny tiny - arm and leg room is little to none (communal, almost, which I don't really mind). ? I suggest going here NOT with an empty stomach and with just a friend or two because apparently the biggest table seats only four people - any party bigger than four have to split up. ?One more thing is to get here earlier in the day, so if you are like me and want the Spicy Tuna Don or anything with tuna as a side, it will hopefully be available for you.

I've experienced a lot of great ramen places and this place is definitely on the same level as the rest. I ordered the Totto Spicy Ramen with extra pork. The noodles were firm, fresh and not overcooked. They were a little firmer than the average ramen noodle. The pork was not as fatty and soft as some might like but it wasn't a negative difference. I liked that the pork was not the same old melt in your mouth variety. It required a little more chewing and had a little bit of char on the outside suggesting it spent some time over a flame. I would have to say that the broth was the best part of the meal. I rarely finish my soups to the end but I found myself with a dry bowl. The broth wasn't as oily as I'm used to so I left the restaurant without the typical wretched feeling of a heavy meal. This place is very small! It can probably hold 20 people when full. I heard it gets packed so I headed over at 12 pm but still waited about half an hour to get seated. There is a clipboard on the door where you leave you name and party size. I didn't know at time of my visit but apparently you can come before they open and leave your name. I wouldn't suggest dining here if you expect to be in and out quickly. There is bar style seating right in front of the "kitchen" and a couple tables for the larger parties. The largest party they will accommodate is four, they will make you split up if you have more. Also make sure everyone is present when they call your name. There was a group getting kicked out because they didn't have everyone there at the time of seating. Even though I ordered extra pork the amount of pork was not that large. The bowl wasn't that large either so if you're really hungry you may want to pre game or post game somewhere else.

This has to be my favorite ramen joint in NYC. Yes it is DINKY and the wait is LONG, but it's totally worth the wait. I've waited anything between 30 minutes and 3 hours (on a freezing/rainy night). Yes it is THAT good! I always get the miso ramen because the small pieces of pork in the miso combined with the spicy sesame oil are so perfect together. A little bit of the sesame oil really goes a long way so I'd recommend sharing it between two people or three (if you only want a pinch of spicy).

I actually had a draft of this review soon after eating here last week. ?But then I woke up at midnight sick to my stomach, feeling like everything was going to just fall out. ? While the extra spicy totto ramen that I ordered with an added spiced egg was delicious, the seared pork definitely made me sick. I came here around 4 pm on a Thursday. ?I was a party of just one, so there was no wait, as I was seated at the bar immediately. ?I ordered aforementioned. ?The broth was very flavorful, the tasty, spicy sauce was served on the side, the fatty pork was delicious (again, my thoughts before it made me sick)! and the spiced egg, was just okay. I will enjoy ramen again, maybe even from this spot. ?But I will NOT being having the pork, nope, never ever. ?And if there is a next time, I'll do it up like the women next to me did-- pickled goodness as appetizers to yummy noodle soup, with frothy beer to share.

Went at 5:30 to avoid a lineup, and friend and I ended up waiting roughly 15 minutes, which wasn't bad. They also expect your whole group to be there before seating you, so my friend and I were pushed forward, because a few groups originally ahead of us were missing people. I ordered the original chicken with pork, which came with shredded chicken, but only 2 slices of pork. My friend ordered the pork miso ramen, but his came with no meat inside, except for a little bit of what seemed to be like grounded pork and paste. Not sure if it was an accident, or of that was the way it was supposed to be. In any case, we both enjoyed the meal and finished every last drop of soup. Unfortunately because of the small to moderate portions and lack of meat, we got hungry a few hours later. Next time we will probably order extra toppings

Fabulously worth the wait and better than many other highly-rated Ramen style restaurants in the city. I tend to order vegetarian at these restaurants (lame..I know, but hear me out) and often the options and quality are lacking. Here, the vegetarian dish was absolutely delicious...in fact, many meat-eaters may even prefer this dish. The combination of avocado, tofu, sprouts, noodles, mushrooms, and more in the perfectly seasoned and spiced miso broth made every bite unique and scrumptious. You can add various toppings for a little bit extra (I highly recommend the boiled egg), and there are many sides to choose from, as well. Even more, they don't rush you out of the place! The service is not bad considering the crowd they are dealing with, and just come off of "peak time" if you want a calmer experience. Just bring cash and no more than 3 friends.

I'm always hesitant to give a full 5 stars, because that would mean that I can find no fault with the establishment. ?So I'd prefer to give this place 4.75 stars... there must be something I can pick on this place for! :) We arrived on Saturday around 1:30. ?There was metered parking right on the street, even in front of the shop. ?Already we could see about 10 people waiting in line, and the shop only opened at 12pm. ?We were prepared for a longish wait; luckily the metered spots are up to 2hours. When I get to the shop, there is no attendant in the front so I'm standing at the door looking around for some kind of clipboard or a person to tell. ?Hubby points to it hanging on the door so I quickly signed my name. ?I noted about 10+ uncrossed names before mine. ?However, after about 10 minutes or so of waiting, the list grew so long that it required a second page so we must've gotten there just in time to beat the rush. ?There is no seating in the area, just steps leading to townhomes which you're not supposed to sit on so it may get uncomfortable if the wait is too long. There are about 15 seats, both at the "bar," which is very Japan, and there were I think two tables. I think we waited not more than 25 minutes? ?It was a quick wait, that's for sure. The menu is very small -- there are about 3 varieties of Ramen, all based on their chicken broth, with 2 more varieties of spicyness. ?There are 3 sides and a few beverage choices. ?I like Ramen shops that don't get all fancy and fusiony and just concentrate on the noodles; afterall, that's what your specialty is. I got the Chicken Paitan and hubby got the Miso. ?We also ordered the Ava Tuna appetizer. ?This was one of the freshest sashimi plates I've had in all my time in New York, and it could very well hold its own next to our Tsukiji fish market experience in Japan. ?The fish was extremely fresh, not frozen, seared slightly on the outside and marinaded just right. ?We would definitely order this again next time we come. I loved the chicken broth that my ramen came in; sometimes pork belly broth/tonkatsu broth can get extremely thick and oily which is a big turn off for me. ?This broth was just the right consistency and flavor. Hubby really liked his miso version although I'm not a huge fan of miso. We ate fast, as we always do and cleared out of there within 20 minutes. ?There wasn't an excruciating wait for the ramen neither, unlike Ippudo. ?Two ramens, one appetizer and one beer came out to a little under $50 after tax/tip. We left happy and fulfilled. ?I'm glad we took the trip out! Totto definitely trumps Ippudo :)

I had a little time between shopping + meeting a friend for HH so I popped into Totto around 3:30pm on a cold, wet, rainy Tuesday. Turns out that that's the perfect time to come by! I signed up by the door (after only 1 other party of 2) and was whisked in right away. I sat at the counter and ordered a Miso Ramen with char siu pork + spicy sesame oil (the waiter said that was his fave combo.. win ;]). My order came out super quick and it took me about 45 mins to finish the bowl bc there was so much in it! I was stuffed afterwards and also dying a bit from the salt in the broth. They are cash-only but I did see them let a girl go back to her apt to get money bcus all she had was her CC and she didn't want to pay the extra ATM fee just to get $10 out. I thought that was extremely nice of them (and the girl offered to leave her ID in case they were scared she wouldn't return), but they don't do that on the regular so make sure you bring cash monayssss!

I came to Totto Ramen once during the summer. There was a wait outside in the hustle and bustle of midtown Manhattan. To me, it wasn't worth that wait for ramen and to eat in a small narrow restaurant and having to eat on the bar for two people. I had regular ramen with pork and egg and seaweed. It was okay. I've had better at other ramen places. You can see my other reviews for other ramen spots for more information. The line is ridiculously long for this place, especially when the weather is nice. It is too small, but it's just like all the other ramen places. Maybe I wasn't in a good mood that day or something or maybe I didn't like the heat in there sitting at the bar where they were cooking. Check out the other ramen spots in the city where you don't have to wait as long and you can get a personal table and have private conversations.

This is one of my favorite ramen places in New York, but unfortunately I do not make it there often enough as the wait is usually 1-1.5 hours! I'm pretty sure you cannot find a ramen shop like this anywhere else in the United States though. It's a quaint shop with very limited seating, and chefs cooking the whole shebang right in front of you. It always makes me feel so toasty when I finallyyy get to step food inside. Definitely recommend the original flavor, and ask for the spicy sauce on the side. Broth is perfectly done, and the noodles are just the way I like them. My friend discovered the Nikku ramen which is a bit more expensive but basically comes with a MOUND of different meats. I tried some, and everything was so tender. I'm usually stuffed by the end of my meal, which is a good sign after starving from waiting so long. The extended hours now will hopefully help with the wait, but I would suggest putting your name down on the list... walking around the area and then coming back. Parties of 2 or less are definitely much easier to seat. I believe they restrict the group to 5 or less. Happy eating!

From a C to an A, the place doesn't look much different than before. Ramen is still excellent. There is still a ridiculously long yet worthwhile wait. ?But they have certainly increased the variety of appetizers. Char siu buns were AH-MAZING! For $3.50 each, I'd say it's totally worth it. The way they marinated the char siu makes you keep coming back for more. Come here hungry and leave here happy. That's how all good restaurants should be.

We waited two whole hours and had to negotiate seating with the waiter who was so obstinate about seating. Just split our party and let us eat, dammit!! The largest party that they can seat is four so plan accordingly if you came in a big group. The ramen was so worth the wait though. The broth is so fresh and fortifying. The noodles have this great al dente bite to them. I got the totto miso ramen. It was simplistic yet disgustingly good. I dream about this ramen. The restaurant itself is so small and hot due to the kitchen in full view. Plus, since space is an issue, be aware that you'll be rubbing elbows with another party sitting right next to you. If you can look past the long wait and small space, the ramen is worth it .

I'm thinkin' Totto Ramen wanted me to make sweet, sweet love to my noodles because they were pumpin' some Goddamn sexy, baby-makin' R&B joints from the '90s in there. You could've told me our waitress was in one of those shiny pajama numbers with the one button buttoned a la that TLC "Creep" video, and that the dudes behind the ramen bar were actually those puppets from Blackstreet's "No Diggity" clip, and I would've totally believed you. That's just how tunnel-vision-focused I was on my bowl of Totto Spicy Ramen and just how far removed I was from the real world. And quite possibly this decade. I was pretty much face-down in my ramen bowl for a solid, non-stop twenty minutes, mainly due to the following exceptional two components: 1) The Broth - This was such a spectacular base for the entire meal, it could've been a soup all its own at some lesser establishment. Full of fantastic flavor, and with an addictive kick that really transitions nicely into a wonderful aftertaste (as advertised), the chicken-soy sauce broth owes most of its praise to their original rayu (spicy sesame oil), which has been given a two chili pepper rating on their spiciness scale. For reference, the Totto Extra Spicy Ramen has a nine (!). I bow before those who can tackle this monster. I'll take my measly two peppers and keep my tears, thank you very much. 2) The Char Siu - An especially thick, super-soft slab of salty pork, this is the one ingredient you want to finish entirely once you take that first bite, but know you've got a whole bowl of ramen to consume, so you should probably just submerge it under a bed of noodles so that you can keep re-discovering it. Yes, I played hide-and-seek with my pork. But this wasn't just any pork - this was quite possibly the best char siu I've had served with ramen. And you can quote me on that one. While you will most likely wait roughly an hour during dinnertime to get a table (you must sign yourself up on the clipboard hanging from the door, you must be present when your name is called, and you must have your entire party there or else you get bumped to the bottom of the list), the wait for your food will be minimal once seated. I literally placed my order with the waitress, excused myself to go to the restroom, and when I came back, a giant, steaming bowl of ramen had sat itself before my empty chair. And despite this seemingly Nazi-style set of house rules, it's really to keep everyone on their toes and the line moving, because the staff was totally all smiles inside. With a little En Vogue, Boyz II Men, and (if you're lucky) possibly even a cameo by Bell Biv DeVoe accompanying some of the absolute best ramen in the city, you'd be smiling, too.

Minus one star, because the other ramen dishes weren't as good as the original *chicken paitan ramen*, which was out of this world. After you've tried the chicken paitan ramen, nothing else really compares. The broth has an undeniable chicken flavor, probably from the many hours it's been boiled with chicken. Tastes like it would be great if you caught a cold! Anyway, this broth is the real deal. Check out the restaurant website for photos of the ramen, because there aren't any photos on the actual menu there. http://tottoramen.com/?p… If I had seen this to begin with, I probably wouldn't have ordered the miso ramen, which has an interesting ball of koji miso on top. This tasted like ground pork spiked with some liquor (was not a huge fan). The wavy noodles, however, were very much to my liking, and I would give that two thumbs up! I've also heard that the vegetable ramen is very flavorful despite it seeming like ramen topped with a bunch of raw veggies. I might venture to try this the next time. Of course, waiting an hour for food is never ideal, but I think the chicken ramen is worth the wait. Another friend advised that around 3 or 4pm, there is virtually no wait, so I would look into going around that time instead of prime lunch or dinner hours. If any of you think Ippudo is the best ramen out there, but haven't tried this yet, I would strongly urge you to try Totto. You may change your mind!

Extra spicy ramen - do it! Broth isn't overpowering and I didn't feel thirsty after! Portions are just perfect as well. I find that when I go to Ippudo I can never finish a whole bowl of ramen, and I often feel bad wasting the rest. But I finished it here and I felt fine after! I went during labor day - went there at 5pm sharp and there was already a line. Unfortunately we had to wait 30 minutes because the first wave of people already filled the space. But it was worth the wait! I would recommend getting there by 4:45 to put your name on the list.

There are a lot of restaurants with a lot of hype that I go to try, and they dissapoint me like nothing else. This is one of those examples. I am very generous with how I rate places, and a 2 is generous for this place... I am serious. I wanted to like it so much, me and friends tried to come here over 10 times and everytime the wait is too long. Today, the stars were aligned (or maybe they werent?) and the wait was literally 5 minutes. When we walked in, our table was ready with water on it already. The place smelled wonderful. I was so excited, and giggled out loud to my buddies about finally being here. Before I continue, I would like to say I never had Japanese Ramen, I have had a lot of Pho though, oh and a of chicken noodle soup at diners (which I love). Anyway, I ordered the spicy ramen, and my friends ordered vegetable ramen and miso ramen. They also got squid skewers as an appetizer. The squid came out and it was 3 pieces on a skewer, and it tasted OK. It was drenched in soy sauce, and I think it would have been better with much less. I am confused, was I eating the same ramen as everyone else or what? I love spicy food, but this spicy ramen did not taste good to me. It literally tasted like broth with A LOT of ground up black pepper. I am not a huge fan of pepper and rarely put it on my food, so I did not like it at all. My friends broths were OK, but again nothing special. However, the small amount of pork that I did have in my soup was very good. Very good flavor and I wish I had more of the pork. I know they advertise no MSG, but damn, maybe I should have requested a bit on the side to add to my soup.

This was apparently Top 3 in NYC (it was #3) and apparently, comparable to Ippudo. Now that I've finally gone to Ippudo...I can make the thoroughly assessment. This is my first experience of ramen in NY. I got the spicy ramen: original Rayu, Spicy Sesame Oil, adds a spicy kick and refreshing aftertaste to our original Paitan ramen.Topped with scallion, char siu pork, bean sprouts, and nori. It's definitely different from Ippudo which was a little creamier and a better broth. However, I kind of like that this broth was a little clearer. I definitely like the part that it was spicy. The noodles were not as awesome. The price was much better at $10.50. It's teeny tiny space. This is hard...I definitely want to try Hidechan now.

So, i came by on a Friday at 9:00 pm. It was packed. There was still a wait list and I ended up eating 2 hours later. Is there ever a time when it is isn't packed? Even when I left around 11:30 pm, there were still people waiting. Btw, the chefs are pretty cool. They had some gummy bears as a snack and they asked if we wanted some. If you sit at the counter, definitely chat it up with your cooks! The restaurant is small. I am only 5'3" and 108 pounds, and I could not fit in the bathroom. I could not turn around or even pee properly. I know TMI, but I need to let you know how small this bathroom is! Anyways, the counter can fit about 10 people, and they have about 2 tables for 2 people parties and 4 tables for 4 people parties. There is not a lot of room here. Was the ramen that good? I don't think I can be unbiased. I was pretty miserable by the time I got a bowl. My tummy hurt and I was freezing, not an awesome experience. The miso ramen was interesting since they put an ice cream-sized and shaped scoop of miso on top of my ramen. The miso tasted a little like beer, haha. Afterwards, I just mixed it in. The ramen was good. It was pretty delicious. NO MSG, just an authentic bowl of ramen with some fresh ingredients. I would love to eat this stuff any time. So, why 3 stars? It's just the wait, I can't wait 2 hours for food, I need time in life to do other things, like write yelp reviews. Anyways, this is good to try at least once, but don't make it a habit or you will spend your whole life waiting!

Usually when I eat ramen, I never drink up the soup at the end, just coz, even at my favorite ramen shop in the bay area. I got the miso ramen here, and it was SOOOO good that I slurped the bowl dry!! And it was SOO good that I came back here 2 days later and tried out their vegetable ramen. The broth wasn't as flavorful as the miso, but the bowl was FILLED with veggies. If you sit at the bar, the chefs are really friendly. They informed us that it takes 6 hours to make their broth. Also, they're MSG-free. Yay. Love this place!

Properly evoking the bustling, workaday ramen dining experience of Japan, Totto ramen is a cramped eatery where most seats (and THE best seats) are along the bar where you can watch the noodles being made, barely 2 feet from you. ?Don't expect to sit comfortably, don't bother to dress up, just expect to be wowed by one of the best ramen in NYC. Well worth the hike to Midtown west, but try to get here early. ?Those legendarily long lines are real because this place is small, takes no reservations, and is deservedly mad popular. ?They don't accept parties bigger than 4 because there aren't any tables larger, so our group of 5 split in two. ?By serendipity, we ended up seated all together at the bar. ?Cheers! Once settled into our seats, I examined the menu, a very basic affair but a good ramen place doesn't need to stray far from their basics. ?On my first visit (because there will be more), I tried the Totto spicy ramen. ?In a blink after ordering, it arrived, steaming with so much topping I couldn't see the noodles. ?It was a delicious ramen, springy straight noodles, chicken-y rich broth with a clean aftertaste, and very good char siu pork. ?Not super spicy, just a nice kick, without overshadowing the broth flavor. Everyone in the group, including the ramen virgins, loved it. ?I can't recall much conversation as we devoted ourselves to our ramen. ?I haven't yet hit up the other highly regarded ramen places in NYC besides Ippudo, which does tonkotsu best but doesn't replicate the traditional ramen experience. ?I loved the dining experience at Totto, and their chicken broth was a winner. I suspect I may upgrade my rating to 5 after a second visit.

3.5 stars Waited 1.5 hours on a Friday night for a bowl of Totto's spicy ramen ($10.25). Walked away satisfied, however, not sure if I would be willing to wait in that line again. It's good, but unfortunately I couldn't make a great assessment.. I came here with a cold that I've had for about two weeks now, and so that means my taste buds weren't in great working order.... Wompwomp. However, I still was satisfied as the noodles were cooked perfectly and broth was not overly rich. Meat was super tasty and not too fatty. Unfortunately, I didn't like the avo tuna appetizer much (too salty) and I usually prefer more toppings on my ramen without having to pay extra for them. Overall, prices are reasonable though. To be fair, i should probably come back for another try once I'm all recovered. However, I don't know when that would be.. II think I'd accompany a friend who really wants to go, but I don't know if I care to make the trek and wait so long anytime in the near future.

Since I can never seen to get into Ippudo (a 2.5 hour wait for dinner on a Thursday?), I get my ramen fix at Totto Ramen or Momofuku Noodle Bar. Anytime I go to either, I only wait about 30 minutes (although many friends say they've experienced much longer wait times at Totto) and the ramen is absolutely worth it. At about $10/bowl, the people at Totto know exactly how to fill you up with perfectly cooked noodles and a broth that makes you pause to reflect on how wonderful life can be sometimes. A few potentially helpful hints: 1) If you're a n00b at eating ramen, then don't go on a date. It WILL get messy and it WILL be embarrassing, but you won't be able to stop yourself from continuing to attack your bowl. 2) Cash only. 3) They don't have Sriracha or anything to add spice to your dish (they handed me a powdered spice but it didn't do much for me). Either enjoy the flavor or order spicy ramen. 4) Go again and again. I've tried 3 different types of ramen here and enjoyed them all including the vegetable ramen (I was raised to believe that having dinner without meat was considered somewhat blasphemous).

During my last work trip to NYC, I woke up one morning after a long night of drinking and was craving a bowl of spicy ramen. ?Hot soup is always the best remedy for a hangover...whether is pho, ramen or just your average chicken noodle soup. ? We walked from our hotel (the London NYC) to the restaurant, which was only several blocks away in Hells Kitchen. ? When we arrived at our destination, it certainly wasn't what I had expected and surely wasn't Momofuku or the like. ?But what I loved about this restaurant is that it reminded me of being in some neighborhood mom-n-pop in Tokyo or Kyoto . ? The patrons that were waiting outside the restaurant consisted of elderly Japanese folks, Japanese businessmen and even a group of firefighters from NYFD. ? When I'm looking for an authentic experience, I judge the restaurant based on it's audience. ?I knew right away that we were going to have a good experience. I've already been to Ippudo and Momofuku several times before, but was never really impressed with their ramen. ?In fact, I'm pretty picky when it come to ramen and between Tokyo and NYC, I have to say this is as good as it gets! I ordered the extra spicy miso ramen and although it wasn't as spicy as I had hoped for, it was still very tasty and satisfying. ? The pork broth was delicious! ? Even the appetizer and side dishes we shared amongst our group was scrumptious. ?I would definitely recommend all three side dishes - Broiled Char Siu Pork, Char Siu Mayo Don and Avo Tuna. ?Tip: if you like spicy, be sure to ask for more chili sauce to add to your soup. ? Kanpai!

THE WAIT WAS RIDICULOUS!! It was about 45 minutes - 1 hour. I don't remember fully because my brain froze outside. The restaurant itself is really tiny and because their menu really only consists of ramen, the turn over was pretty fast. So while the wait was long, the restaurant was definitely making bank. My friend recommended Totto Ramen to me and it turned out pretty good. We sat at the 'bar' and watched as the chefs were preparing the ramen. The soup was amazing and if anything - that really was the reason for this 4-star review. When it comes to ramen, not many places get it wrong, but the soup here definitely beat the competition. Pros: Soup Music - was amazing, they played a mixture of house, hip/hop and top40's Cons: The wait

Pros: Good ramen. Cons: 1 hour + wait. Not worth it unless you are a die hard ramen fan and can't sleep until you've tried all in the city. Super cramped conditions. You feel like an inmate while you're eating because you are literally rubbing elbows with the people sitting next to you and you are rushed to get out. This place NEEDS to be cleaned. No excuse, its downright gross. Explains the C rating on the door.

Totto Ramen has evolved quite a bit since it first opened with no appetizers yet on the menu. Originally, the ramen broth was much simpler and cleaner with the spiciness level only upped by some hot chili oil. Now, the broth has become much richer and more savory almost as if the bones had a longer time to cook than before. This can put people off as my friend loved the simplistic flavors during its opening but I much prefer its more well rounded taste that it currently has. As well, the spiciness has changed by actually having spicy peppers with the oil. I got the spiciest option with the 10 chili pepper icons next to it and it wasn't that spicy. The spice used is very similar to Szechuan cooking with that subtle numbing effect so this isn't one that is like sriracha or wasabi that has a higher impact. The addition of appetizers and other dishes is very welcome. I ordered the spicy tuna rice bowl and it was so delicious. Definitely worth sharing considering all the carbs you are already inhaling when you order your own bowl of ramen but I will tell you I enjoyed it so much that I was sad that there wasn't more left and wished I hadn't shared.

The wait: around 20-30 minutes - you basically have to write your name down on a clipboard and stand outside on the stairs/block people on the sidewalk before you get seated The seating: don't do what I did and sit at the bar - you will sweat your ass off, especially on a hot summer day. ?Yes, avid noodle soup lovers still eat hot noodle soup on a hot summer day. ?There are some small tables towards the back of the restaurant. The service: the guy behind the bar gave us extra pieces of meat, free of charge :) ?very funny, energetic, sweaty men. The food: ?I got the spicy ramen. ?It wasn't the kind of spicy I enjoy in ramen - it was more of a lots-of-black-pepper overly peppery kind of spicy. ?That part was disappointing. ?The broth, however, was rich and delicious and the ramen was just the right texture and firmness. The cost: around $14ish dollars. ?Average for NYC.

This is one of those "worth the long ass wait" places. So they say this is the #1 ramen joint in NYC, better than Ippudo. Comparing ramen to ramen, I wouldn't say this is better than Ippudo. I would say this place has better noodles than Ippudo and provides an overall slightly better Japanese authentic experience. It feels like one of those noodle shops you see in the anime Naruto. ? Got the Totto Miso Ramen with a buddy and we both loved it. We got extra pork belly slices (kinda thin, but still good) and they really added to the ramen experience. I remember the specific eggy/floury noodles. The broth was very rich, but I think Ippudo's has more layers of flavor and sophistication. All in all, I think Totto ramen has more of an authentic, dive-y ramen experience, whereas Ippudo is more sophisticated and more high end.

I waited a little under 40 minutes to get a seat. It's well worth the wait. The only reason I'm giving it a 4-star is because I can't help but feel a bit cramped in there. They also split up your party if you have more than 4. I would def recommend the spicy ramen and the spicy tuna don. If you like your foods with a kick but not too spicy, you can request for the spicy sesame oil on the side.

Bowl of heaven! Totto Ramen lived up to all the hype and well beyond. Located in Manhattans' Hell's Kitchen area it truly epitomizes "hole in the wall" eatery! Located a few steps below road level, takes no reservations no call-ins and their biggest table seats 4. You enter and there is a board hanging outside with paper and pen, you write your name and people in your party and wait to be called. I was alone on a Thursday evening around 6, called in 10 minutes. Got seated at the "bar" aka kitchen island, literally, kitchen island! ?My view was overlooking the kitchen which has three person standing space and three large pots boiling away broth! The menu is... well, Ramen! Done six different ways. I got the Totto Spicy Ramen, comes topped with spicy sesame oil. It was hot! Even for this Indian who has been raised on chilies and spices. The chilled Sapporo came in handy. But, the flavors were spectacular! Ramen were cooked perfectly, gliding in with every spoonful! There were two pieces of pork, boiled, cut in squares and the dude fired up his blow torch to char them and dropped them right on my bowl! They melted on the first bite. ? Sweat falling from my brow I soup'd out every little drop and gave that bowl all the respect it deserved! If you are in the area, do yourself a favor come and pay homage at this Ramen Mecca!

Rounded up, 4.5 stars This place is packed for a small place with a que of people waiting, and I can see why. I was part of a party of 8 and we managed to all sit at the bar. The people are really friendly and as we walked in they quickly greeted us. You get to see your ramen prepared infront of you, and that's part of the fun of going to this place. The char siu pork is heated with a blow torch and you see them preparing the broth in a big bowl. The guys basically put on a show for all of us. I like how they had a conversation with us while we were eating to keep us entertained. Had the Totto Spicy Ramen and it was yummy. Maybe I was craving for something salty/spicy at that time that made me think what I had was really delicious, but it was really delicious. I wouldn't mind coming back ?sometime.

This place is heaven. Forget about the 1.5 hour wait, because you will find out it's worth it. It was the first restaurant that we went for our first day in NYC. I did my research online about this place, so I was very positive to take my friend here. We ordered the Niku ramen, the one for mean lovers. The soup base was rich and yummy. Doodle was okay. But the meat, oh am gee, delicious! We also ordered the Uni don. The cook at the counter suggested it to us. Yummy! Even thought these two Cali girls could not finish everything they ordered, but they enjoyed this place, the experience, and of course, the food. By the way, the cooks at the counter were really funny and nice :)

The avo tuna was a true highlight of the first experience, but my second time the tuna wasn't fresh at all and tasted salty nasty. Don't order the spicy ramen. ?You'll be sad to find a flat broth, and STRAIGHT spaghetti-like noodles. ?Be sure to order the curly noodles. ?Why the eff do they have two different types of noodles? ?One of which isn't even good?? I was so let down. And forget about actually eating here during meal hours or the weekend. ?The wait is ridiculous since the place is tiny. ?Only 20 seats (10 bar, 10 table seats)

Like my boyfriend tells me, I like to go to popular places on busy nights (friday), and act surprised when there is a huge line and we would have to wait. This is the story of Totto Ramen. I must mention that it is a little bit unnerving that they have a C DOH rating.. still it is the first (probably will not be the only) time I've waited over 2 hours for dinner somewhere. But it was bearable because you could put down your name and phone # on the clipboard by the door, grab a drink nearby and they will call you when your table is ready. Perfect! We killed time by making an ATM run ( they only take cash) and drinking way too much at MacCoy's Pub around the corner, and by the time we sat down at Totto I was sufficiently buzzed. Oh. my. The broth was so tasty. The Ramen just enough give to be chewy and springy. The pork! with all the tantalizing fat attached. It was heaven! and coincidentally really good drunk food. It just too bad that the next time I'm drunk I will probably not be up to waiting 2 hours for my Ramen... Thank god for Mickey D's.

Decided to try this place since bf really likes it. Place is really small so limited seating. they have about 4 tables and then theres the bar area. If u're in a rush, don't come here and expect to be seated right away. You have to have patience. We waited almost an hr and half to be seated but that can be nexus it was a Fri night too and I didn't mind cuz I wanted to try it. Once seated, we ordered spicy vegetable ramen and the pork on the side. Both was soooooo Yummy. They loaded our bowl up with veggies. Mmmm.. Do try this place if you have time to kill.

Been wanting to try this place for some time so headed down here around 5PM, thinking that I would avoid the wait. Well, apparently, other people thought they'd avoid the wait as well. I waited about 30 min for a table of two. Once my name was called, we headed in and got a table. I ordered the spicy ramen ($10.50) which was more peppery than spicy. The broth and flavor of the noodles was not overpowered by the spice factor. I got 2 good-sized pieces of pork and there was plenty of green onions and bean sprouts. Service was fast and efficient. Bathroom small, but clean. The only thing I didn't like was if you've signed up for a table and your entire party isn't with you, you move to the bottom of the list. Will have to come back and re-evaluate... *Note: cash only

The totto miso ramen with pork was delicious! The pork was really soft and the soup wasn't too oily. I sat at the bar and you can watch the chef prepare your food behind the counter. The only downside is the restaurant is very cramped and small. Try to get there right when the restaurant opens and you can get be one of the first few people to get a seat! Other than the lack of space, I really enjoyed my ramen noodle and would definitely go back for more!

We just came out from having after-theater desserts nearby at Kyotofu, but since hubby was still hungry and we were nearby we decided to check this ramen house out. It was ~10:30 pm ?on a late weeknight and there were 4-5 parties ahead of us. We waited for about half an hour before we were seated at the table. I need to correct one gentleman's Yelp review mentioning pork broth ramen here: there's NO PORK BROTH anywhere here at Totto Ramen, ONLY CHICKEN BROTH To validate one lady's comment about the hype: I agree with you. The ramen at Totto Ramen is not that good, not worth the price and the line. I've had much better ramen for less in Bay Area (Orenchi), LA (Daikokuya), and Tokyo, Japan Hubby tried the Paitan ramen with chicken, requested the noodles to be harder/boiled less (we both like chewier, harder ramen noodles): (+) soup was really good, it's got a very strong, highly concentrated chicken flavor (-) it's chicken soup, not pork broth. I always prefer pork broth to chicken because it's richer and more flavorful (-) it came with straight noodles, which I didn't like because it's thinner than the wavy noodles on my miso ramen (-) the only garnish was green onion and seaweed, which I thought was quite strange. I have had countless ramen before in California and Japan, and they always have multiple garnishes including bamboo shoot, some sort of long black mushroom, which were missing from the bowl (-) chicken pieces were white meat, I personally prefer dark meat because they are more juicy, tender, and flavorful than white meat I got the miso ramen with pork, requested noodles to be harder/boiled less as well: (~) pork slices were OK, too thick for my taste, but still flavorful (-) again, the only garnishes were hard boiled egg and green onion (-) not a fan of the broth, basically the difference was a blob of miso paste in the middle of a sea of Paitan chicken broth, the miso has strong alcohol taste to it, which I personally don't like (+) I love the wavy noodles, it's thick and boiled less as I requested so it's really chewy

They need places like these in Chicago! People recommended this place for ramen so we came here for dinner. You write your name and party size down on the clipboard on the door. It's a very small place so the wait can get a bit long. MORE THAN 4 PEOPLE IN YOUR PARTY AND YOU WILL BE SPLIT UP. We didn't know this so I sat at the counter with my bf. I don't mind though since I like to watch them cook. The bf got the miso. DELICIOUS flavor. I got the spicy. Unfortunately I didn't read the description correctly because I thought it was a spicier miso. I was disappointed that I lacked the miso flavoring but my bf offered to pour some of his broth into mine and vice versa. PERFECTION!!! omg. Miso broth with spicy on the side next time! The meat is perfect and the little sides we added (bamboo, seaweed, egg) were great as well. I feel like you should get out as soon as possible (from the long wait lines) which isn't a pleasant feeling but whatever.

Had the extreme spicy totto ramen (7 chilli symbols) and the chef even warned me about the hotness, took a bite and a sip and asked "can I add more hot sauce pls?" Good broth base but definitely not spicy for a hot gal like me! I went there late in the evening around 10pm and waited for a good 45mins and I also added a boiled egg to my ramen, the egg was a little over cooked or it might be cooked in the afternoon, simply too hard.

Every time we walked passed this place there was a huge line out the door. It's super tiny and only seats about 20 people at a time. We finally got a chance to eat here right before closing time. It was still packed, but no wait. I'm not a ramen aficionado, but I've tried a decent amount of ramen. I always thought no place could beat Santoka Ramen in Mitsuwa, but this place proved me wrong. Their spicy ramen was A-mazing. They do something special with the broth because it's so flavorful. It tasted like they were cooking it for hours. I added bamboo and a boiled egg with my ramen. I basically inhaled the bowl and the soup. I was sad that I wouldn't get a chance to eat there again until some time in the future when I visit NYC. Although it's a bit on the pricy side, I would definitely pay $12 for their ramen again.

If you don't mind waiting a while outside for a really authentic Japanese ramen meal, this place is for you. ?The place is tiny, down a short flight of stairs from street level. ?There are 23 seats in the entire place (I'm pretty sure I counted right.). Sit at the bar if you can. ?You'll get to see your dinner made in the traditional Japanese style. I have either the miso ramen or spicy miso ramen every time I go. ?For business travelers on a budget, is place is a top spot. ?I get out of here for $25 with genereous tip any time I go. ?Less if no beer or sake. About the wait: ?sign the clipboard, and don't get impatient and leave for a few minutes. ?Chances are that people on the list in front of you have bolted, making your wait shorter. ?The place lives up to their posted promise to skip people. Those skipped go to the bottom of the list, and the list is routinely an 8-1/2x11 2-column page long. Also, unless you want evil stares, don't be casual about your dining pace. ?Eat, enjoy, then go. ?You don't have to wolf down your food. Just don't hang around unless you order more. Finally, don't bother asking for favors to get moved up the list unless you want to get told off by the staff (which is a total crack-up if you get to witness it like I have.) They always have interesting music playing. ?It's been R&B every time I've been. ?It adds to the funky no-frills ambience. Totto Ramen is a staple when I'm in Manhattan.

This place is amazing! ?Rivals Ippudo (maybe even better, because this place is actually a little cheaper than Ippudo). The Totto Spicy Ramen is very rich and pretty clean (as in not too many random vegetables or anything - I like my ramen with just soup, noodles, and maybe some meat). ?The sesame oil that is with the Totto Spicy Ramen really adds a nice flavoring to the soup. ?Delicious delicious delicious, although extremely fatty. ?Noodles are pretty chewy, and my friend thought that the noodles here were pretty fantastic. ?The totto spicy ramen bowl (without any extras) is $10.50 while the same bowl at Ippudo can be like $16! There's a super spicy ramen here (it literally had like 10 chili peppers on the menu next to its name, while the Spicy ramen only had 2 chili peppers), I'm kind of curious if my taste buds can handle it or not. ?The cooks apparently just dump tons of spicy sesame oil into this soup.

Now I finally believe there is good ramen at reasonable prices in NYC. In previous visits, I had been to Ippudo a few times. Don't get me wrong, Ippudo's ramen is pretty good, but the prices just drive me up a wall. And every time, I return there because someone else wants to, but after my first visit, I already wrote it off because of the prices. I think I am so hateful of the prices because here in the Bay Area, we have fantastic Ramen places at normal prices ($7-$10 a bowl). During my last trip, my cousin's friend took us to Totto, and I'm very glad that we went. I love the restaurant itself - small, intimate, and you can watch the chefs make your ramen, and in this restaurant's case, watch them torch the Char Siu too! What I loved most about Totto Ramen's Ramen was their broth - they use a chicken broth and it tasted unique to me compared to other Ramen joints. Good stuff!

Noted to be the best Ramen in New York City, I was forced to try this place despite the warnings of 2 hour waits. Let's just say, I was determined not to be the ones who wait 2 hours for Ramen. Arrived at 5pm and awaited about 15-20 minutes for a table for 4. It wasn't so bad. But to be honest, it's not worth a 2 hours wait. The place is TINY and most likely you will be sitting at the bar if you don't have a huge party. Do not come here on a rainy day or you will be miserable and cranky. The staff is nice and very Japanese, duh. Me and my 3 other friends ordered the Spicy Totto Ramen. But before we got to the good stuff, we ordered an appetizer, well I think it was. It was braised pork belly with a hardboiled egg. It was very savory and delicious. Reminded me of Taiwanese style pork belly you eat with rice. It came with a side of hot spicy oil dipping thing. My friends asked for extra -unknowingly getting charged a dollar each for "extra toppings." The spicy totto ramen wasn't spicy enough for my Korean buddies. All in all, the broth was fatty and delicious. The cha siu pork was cooked to perfection. The noodles were yummy. The egg wasn't at all as good as Ippudo, but it was okay. All in all, I was a bit disappointed. I wasn't sure if it was because I like my ramen more flavorful and salty, but the totto spicy ramen didn't match up to all its rave. But never-the-less it's still a top runner in the Ramen world of New York City. I would definitely come back to try the miso -I heard great things. Cash only. Bleh, that sucks. Small. Long wait. Try to come before the place even opens.

This ramen definitely competes with the ramen powerhouses of NYC, but it falls short in critical areas. ?The broth was SLIGHTLY better than Ippudo's, but not my favorite, but the rest is kind of ho hum. ?The noodles were probably the weakest part of the ramen concoction, followed by the meat, which were not nearly as good as the other places I've been to. The biggest problem is the wait time and the spacing, and there's no real space to wait there for your spot, so you just kind of have to stand around waiting. ?The spacing inside is very small, so you can't really take larger parties here if you wanted, my party of 5 had to split into two separate groups in order to get seating. ?That knocks it down a bit, I'd only go over the other ramen places if I felt like I needed to give it another shot.

Line is freagin silly, but its probably because of the limited seating. Came here with Dani, we waited for a min outside, first they didnt open until 5pm....No issue we walked around the streetfair then timesquare went back around 5:30 and we waited for like an hour for a seat at their bar...... At this point i was so hungry i could have eaten my own butt! ?Mind you this place is totally worth it. I love good Ramen and this was the best ramen i have ever had. Miso broth perfect, the pork was flavorful and im not a big pork fan. When u have a limited menu like they do you need to have ur game to a science and let me tell you, they have theirs down. ?they do the damn thang and they do it well. ?I thanked the cooks as we went because they deserve their praise. Try it and you'll agree.

we came here monday night at around 630pm and waited about an hour and maybe 15 min for a table for two. coming here was totally out of the blue and we were still hungry from not being satisfied at kyotofu (see my review) so we thought why not? ? we always wanted to try it. when you get there, you have to walk down the stairs and there is a clip board next to the door hanging. ?you sign your name and put how many people you have. ? we had a party of 2. ?i don't advise coming here with large parties, anything larger than 4 is a no no. ? i saw a few parties of 6 try to get a table and when they were called, they were told they had to split up. ?i mean, do people not read? ?there were several signs (well at least one) that clearly stated parties more than 4 would be split up. ? anyway, we finally got seated and i was very lucky to be given the choice of sitting at a table for two or at the bar. ?i chose the table since it was more roomy. ? there are hooks on the brick walls so that was very convenient. ? we ordered the seared tuna (with avocado), two miso ramens and had one add-on of the curry don. i wanted to order the tuna after seeing pictures on yelp. ?i'm a huge tuna fan and try to try tuna when ever i get the chance. ? the tuna was $6.25 and when it came, i was disappointed. ? i know i judged it before i took a taste and i was disappointed. ?the tuna didn't look appetizing at all. ? i took a bite and it had some crunchy stuff sprinkled on top. ? it was meh. ? tasted like any tuna and nothing special at all. ?it definitely didn't warrant waiting over an hour for. ? the avocado was okay, didn't look too fresh, but it was okay. ? there aren't too many reviews for this appetizer on yelp so here is my honest review on it. ? save your money and order a different appetizer like the pork buns (which i didn't try). ? so on to the miso ramen. ? i love ramen and i am willing to pay a premium for it. ?heck, i traveled all over tokyo looking for must-eat ramen spots all the while not knowing how to speak or read japanese. ? the ramen portion is kind of small compared to places like ippudo and naruto. ?be warned, they give you a ton and i mean a TON of scallions. ?it's not even diced up or anything, it's shreds of it, sort of like like thick shredded carrots. ? on top of that, there are diced raw onions mixed in. ? now i get why the scallion was in there, but i've never seen such large amounts of it and i definitely have never seen diced raw onions in ramen. ? this was a huge turn off for me since i hate scallion. ?i usually just scoop it out, but since they gave so much and it was mixed in with the onions, i had a tough time doing so. ? my bf who doesn't mind scallions or onions even made a comment about the large amounts in his bowl. ? ?if you do order this, make sure you tell the waiter/waitress to go easy on it or tell them you don't want it. ?IF i return, i will definitely be telling them to hold off on both. aside from this, the broth was really good. ? i wanted to drink the whole bowl, but i didn't for fear of becoming really thirsty. ?i had a long way home and i didn't want to have to go to the bathroom. ? the broth is different from other broths. ?this is chicken broth. ? they gave you two slices of pork, which i found was on the cheap side. ? it wasn't memorable. ? the pork at ippudo and naruto is better in my opinion. ? it was good, but not melt in your mouth goodness. ? they also gave you scoopful of meat that looked like bean paste. ? that was interesting and i mixed that around. ? the ramen is wavy and not the straight kind and that tasted just the way i wanted it to taste. lastly, the curry don was an additional $3 and it came in a small bowl. ? it was really good. ?there was just the right amount of spice and it had a few small pieces of potato and chicken. ? i think i'd order this on its own and just be satisfied eating that. ?believe it or not, i think the curry don was better than the ramen. ? i think my ramen experience was marred by the enormous amounts of scallions and onions. if you are reading this review before you're about to wait on line and eat at Toto, please stop reading my review now since this might ruin appetite. ? So before eating, I usually wash my hands. ? the bathroom is located in the back and is really tiny. ?i'd avoid it if i were you. ?anyway, when i went in, i saw a huge roach crawling on the windowsill. ? i didn't know what to do - wash my hands while panicking or just leave and not wash my hands at all. ? i chose to wash my hands while panicking. ? i saw this before i ate and i decided to suck it up since we waited over an hour and just try the ramen. ? i know there are probably roaches in all restaurants so this shouldn't keep me from coming back, but based on this one experience in the bathroom, no matter how good the food was, i don't think i will be coming back. if you are a ramen fan however, i would suggest trying it at least once.

Planned on meeting my friend here for an 8pm dinner. ?Anticipating the wait, I arrived at 7:30pm to put my name down. ?Yup, it's true....we waited a good hour for a table on a Tuesday night. ?Still well worth it! ? I ordered the traditional chicken ramen with pork and at the last minute had them throw in the avocado topping. ?It's marinated in mirin, and it was fabulous! ?Added an entire new dimension to the ramen in both texture and flavor. ?Order that, and you will not be disappointed! The two of us also started off with the ahi appetizer, which came on a bed of green onions, raw sprouts and sliced avocado. ? The ahi was fresh and sweet, almost melting in my mouth. ?Great taste and texture with the creamy avo, zing of the green onion and crunch of the sprouts. Well worth the hour long wait!

The chicken soup base is so creamy yet sweet and refreshing. The spiciness is a perfect add on and it's not making you uncomfortable. The egg is awesome with crystal-like egg yolk! The noddle is so fresh and delicious!! This is totally worth a long wait!! HAVE TO GO

There was spicy ramen and extra spicy ramen, we got the Spicy ramen thinking it would be spicy. ?It was not even spicy, so we had to ask ?for some more spicy sauce, which we didn't know they would charge us extra $2.00 more each. ? Avo Tuna was good. overall was not bad compare to Ippudo.

I love noodles so when I come to visit a friend in NY. I just had to come here. We came here pretty early, around 6pm on a Sunday. We waited around 45 minutes before we got in. 45min is a long time but it was worth every second. IMHO, every bowl of noodles can be separated into 3 main parts. The noodles, the meat, and the soup. The most important part to me is the soup. The soup makes the bowl of noodles I think, and the soup at Totto is unbelievable. I wouldn't mind just drinking the soup. The soup has so much favor in it, and you can tell that they've been cooking the soup for hours. Not overly salty and doesn't make you thirsty afterweres either. I want to fly to NY just to get a bowl of this stuff. Phenomenal!!! -Newbs-

This place is like crack. If you can't handle that, don't go. But if you can stand the subsequent insatiable cravings, definitely go and definitely order a side of the broiled char siu pork because whatever they give you in the ramen bowl is not enough. It will never be enough. It's that amazing. I've never been to a place that puts such care into every aspect of the ramen bowl. The noodles are cooked inside a whole chicken. The broth is rich and flavorful but not greasy. The char siu pork... perfect. If only there was something remotely comparable in Boston. I would eat Totto Ramen at least once a week because, yes, the lines can be a deterrent for the impatient and hungry--but seriously, well worth the wait.

4 stars only because i have not tried other famous ramen places like Ippudo or momofuku noodle bar. However, on a freezing afternoon-evening, me and my date decided to make a stop at this hyped up ramen place. Being a Korean, the extent any Korean would make ramen better in any way would be my adding some ingredients here and there to the packaged dried noodles or make budaejjigae, which i admit is delicious. I never knew how good a ramen could be and be talked about as AMAZING. then i tried Totto. I wrote my name on the waiting list and waited in the tiny plastic covered space for approximately 40 minutes before called in. The inside was incredibly small, with a bar and a few tables on the side. Of course, we took the bar seats. Why wouldn't you ever take the bar seats?! the experience, conversation you get out of the meal is priceless! We ordered the chicken regular and the extreme spicy with the sauce on the side. The extreme spicy sauce is definitely a flavor enhancer to the ramen and the broth! get it! It was very oily-spicy (?) but yes..we had to get another serving because the flavor it brought was delicious. We also ordered an extra helping of the pork. that you must do...the pork is char broiled right in front of your face. It's fresh and most importantly, delicious and succulent. It truly was an astounding meal on a cold freezing nyc night. I definitely would be back some time in the future with a buddy of mine. enjoy!

Almost as good as the top ramen places I've been to in the US. ?The wait was pretty long for lunch on a random weekday. ?The clientele was almost entirely Japanese. ?Lots of businessmen, school aged kids and older couples all speaking Japanese as we waited outside. ?A good sign. ?Cash Only establishment. ? The extra spicy ramen wasn't that spicy but had a nice kick on the back of your throat. ?The broth was a nice creamy rich porky broth that you could just drink like tea. ?Noodles had a nice spring. ?I like the fact that you could order additions into the ramen and customize. ?A good bowl of ramen always hits the spot.

Extremely tiny store. Went here on a Friday at 4:50pm, where the store was nearly empty. Good sign! Usually the line is towards the next store by 5:30pm. Had the Totto Chicken Paitan Ramen - the simplest one in my point of view. Loved it! Ramen was cooked just right, the broth was perfect, and the chicken tender. Yum!

I could be slightly biased because I had to run to a Wells Fargo ATM and back (they only take cash) to ensure my appetite, but it was as good as authentic Japanese ramen gets. I don't think their noodles are made in-house, but their broth makes up for it. Get the spicy pork and a Sapporo (they only have super premium).

Ben & I starved ourselves all day for this meal. ?Well, not on purpose. ?Freaking moron (Ben, not me) didn't check the hours before we trekked up here. ?So yeah, they don't open til 5 on Saturdays. ?Make note. Although there's only about 20 seats in here, the food is so good (especially after the ridiculous wait) that people come in & out relatively quickly because they eat so fast. ?In fact, I don't think Ben & I exchanged more than a few words, as we were throwing back our bowl of ramen like it was liquid, edible sex. Noodles are al dente goodness, and the veggie ramen was overflowing with avocado, mushrooms, seaweed, tofu, peppers, all kinds of veggies. ?Small menu, a little limited for my fellow almost-vegetarians and you're limited to sake as far as booze goes.

My favorite ramen place in NYC. ?Better than Ippudo. Shorter waits than Ippudo. Cheaper than Ippudo. ? And that will be it for my comparison of Totto to Ippudo. I believe what makes Totto Ramen so freaking good is the broth. ?It's rich and flavorful and delicious on its own even without the noodles and pork. ?The noodles are served al dente and became appropriately softer in texture as the time went on. ?I ordered the Totto Spicy Ramen ($10.50) which had just enough chili oil to add a kick, but not enough to send virgin chili mouths sweating. ?The charsiu pork is tender and flavored just right. Totto Ramen is small inside and contains probably 8 bar seats and 10 other tables inside. ?Because of the goodness and word of mouth of how good Totto Ramen is, the wait may be long--ranging from 30-60 minutes. ?Although waiting sucks, for many of the good restaurants, like Totto Ramen, it's something you would just have to suck up and do it.

Even though there was a short wait when we went there on a Friday afternoon before 5pm, it was definitely worth it. The ramen broth was amazing. I actually like this place better than Ippudo which I thought was too high in sodium. With Totto, the broth was really good and can be addictive.

As other yelpers have mentioned as well as what I've seen As I live practically across the street from this place, it is packed from open to close so expect a wait unless you show up before it opens. I came here with a friend and I had the spicy ramen while she had the miso ramen with boiled eggs and char-siu. The broth is very tasty and it's interesting to see them sear the meat using a blowtorch. ?Being as I'm not a huge ramen fan, I don't think it's worth the wait if you have to wait longer than an hour but I would recommend it to others if they wanted ramen in NYC.

By far better, way better, than ippudo. no comparison. ordered the miso ramen and spicy bamboo shoots (HOT!) and wakame on the side to add into the soup as I was wanted spicy flavor without the chili oil. it was so good!!!

This is really 4 1/2 stars because i take half a star off for the wait (at least an hour during most hours of the day/night). ?That being said... I love their spicy ramen. ?The broth is awesome, the noodles are perfect and the char siu (pork) is perfect parts juicy, crispy,tender and fatty. I don't really order any of the other ramens so I can't comment on that but the char siu mayo don is also awesome. ?It's basically a heartattack of mayo, pork, scallions and rice, totally perfect to start off a meal. The service is friendly, maybe cuz i'm there so much they all seem to remember me now but the older guy behind the counter is really funny if u talk to him. ?Part of the fun's watching them cook. Wish the space were bigger and the wait shorter but the line is worth it if you're in a ramen kinda mood. Hands down best in the city for me over ippudo, minca, hide-chan, sapporo etc etc etc.

Great ramen and pretty quick service once you are inside, but that's the problem. Totto has maybe 10 seats at the bar and 10 regular seats, so the lines outside can be huge. We came one night when it was not too crowded and waited maybe 20 minutes. The cooks are blowtorching the pork slices as you wait, and the added items are fine. A great place but you have to wait.

Somehow lucked out and immediately got a table for two around 4pm on a Tuesday. The ramen here is good, but not outstanding. I ordered the Chicken Paitan Ramen, but the noodles were slightly undercooked and pretty chewy. The chicken itself would have been dry had it not been swimming in the broth. I enjoyed the broth; it was a simple salty and oniony concoction that's incredibly satisfying on a chilly day. If you've never been to Totto Ramen before, please keep in mind that the place is TINY. It's essentially a narrow hallway in a basement. No joke. Don't dare bring a group here. The place is CASH ONLY, so leave your cards in your wallet and hit up the ATM. Despite my less-than-spectacular experience here, I would actually go again, and hope that I can once again slip in without waiting.

The ramen was absolutely amazing, best I've had in my life (although I've only really tried ramen places in NY, LA and SF and I am still young.) I was never able to finish my ramen soup because they always taste very saucy or salty, but I had not a drop of soup left in my bowl today. The spicy ramen was almost perfect, although for me, it was not spicy enough. Maybe next time, I will try the super spicy ramen.

I am a Japanese Noodle addict. From Soba, Udon.. Well, to be specific, I am a Ramen whore(WTF?). There isn't a Ramen shop where I live, but luckily, I travel/work in NYC quite often so I tried most Ramen spots. From Ajisen(meh),Hidechan, Ippudo, Menkuitei(east Village&original, midtown), Menchanko, Minca, Momofuku, Sapporo, Setagaya,.. To Zuzu... So, yeah.. I am a bona fide Ramen whore, for sure. That said, I believe this place has the BEST Ramen in NYC. No, it does not have a art deco interior like Ippudo, or a star chef like Momofuku, or innovative creations like Zuzu; Straight up gangsta Ramen served here. I had the Paitan Ramen, which was creamy, rich-but not overwhlemingly so, with a hint of Sesame and aroma of Sake or something.. Amazing broth. The Charsius are blowtorched and adds a touch of smokiness to the bowl, which I love! (I need to get one for Xmas, damn it). The noodles, are apparantly made in house, but I didn't really get the difference. It was cooked a bit soft than I liked, but nontheless- The broth, oh the broth! It tops all others. Also had the Charsiu musubi, which was ok, nice and spicy.. and a extra side of Charsiu... Excess? maybe, but I did say I was a whore-! The decor is no frills- teeny tiny noodleshop with a counter and a couple of tables. The few times I went, there's always a long wait here- Write your name on the clipboard, and wait... Don't go anywhere! Or you'll lose your turn. Service is, well it is a Noodleshop, so not overly gracious( more like order, eat and get the F out!), but Iam not here to get pampered... I am here for the Ramen, and oh.. the Charsiu. I need to get out of New Rochelle and move next door to this place!!!!!

Ippudo is yesterday's news, Yelpers! Totto Ramen is THE place to get perfect, al-dente ramen noodles. I waited 45 minutes in the rain for these babies, and it was worth it. I went with my cousin, her Japanese boyfriend and Mr. Mix ?- and here's something to satisfy people who are concerned about authenticity: ?our Japanese friend said their Miso Ramen was the closest to the real thing that he's tried outside of ?Japan! Even my cousin, who doesn't like Japanese food, ended up ordering a bowl and LOVED it. Of course, Totto isn't just limited to ramen. Their special appetizers like sliced pork belly and squid yakitori are de-lish as well. The pork belly wasn't overly fatty, and the squid wasn't chewy at all. There was also this fresh, yuzu paste on it, which made it all the yummier and tangier. With your meal, you can add sides like spicy bamboo to mix into the soup, or a seaweed and tuna salad served on shisho leaves (yum!). The drinks menu is not so varied, however, with standard drinks like Sapporo beer, sake and soju. All in all, Totto over Ippudo anyday. Totto wins, and I'm giving it five stars for being the best of ramen in NYC.

After a whole day of travel we checked in, threw our bags down, and just wanted some good comfort food nearby without too much hassle. ?Pull out the trusty Yelp app and typed in "ramen." ?Totto was within walking distance and like Nathan W alluded to: ?'Ippudo's for white people, Totto's for Asians.' ?Well, fine by me. ?So naturally as we're already tired and starving, we approach the place and it's got this big friggin crowd already in front of it... You have to sign up on the clipboard near the front door when you first arrive. ?To their credit, they try to go sequentially first come first serve based on party size; ?lot's of 2's and 3's, ?I would say 4 is tops realistically. ?You take a chance if you think you can sign up and walk away because if you miss your calling, they just cross your name off. ?It's no wonder why there is always a crowd in front of the place waiting. ?We add our name to the list, there were no fewer than a dozen couples ahead of us... We finally get in after about an hours wait, no different than my beloved Hakata Shinsengumi back home (shameless plug). The place is small and narrow, typical Hell's Kitchen. ?There are a couple of small tables, and a counter right behind the chefs preparing the meal, we didn't mind sitting at the counter, I mean do you really want to wait longer for a table? ?I don't think so... Btw, as part of their music loop, they were playing music out of the 70's and 80's pop and R&B, ?what we used to call soul, funk, and even... disco... We pretty much contemplated what we were going to have while waiting so they took our order right away. ?Two Totto Chicken Paitan Ramen, in mine I asked for extra corn and bamboo shoots. The broth was nice and hot (temperature). ?It was fatty, but not as fatty and rich as some of the other ramen places that I've been to in LA (e.g. Santouka, Daikokuya...) ?I think that it was seasoned just right, not too salty for us but not too bland. ?Beasted that sucker right down. ?I saw that she was about half way through hers when I asked for Kaedama: ?an extra order of noodles to be added to my existing bowl of broth. ?My only complaint is that they charge $2.50 for this when I'm spoiled by Shinsengumi where they only charge $0.95 and ask you what the degree of doneness you prefer (firm, medium, soft...) Also had their an order of their "O-inari-san" or just plain inari to us; ?two sweet tofu pouches stuffed with sesame ginger rice. ?We used to affectionately refer to these as "footballs..." Prices were a bit high for what we're used to paying for noodles, but considering where we were, we didn't mind. ?We were very satisfied with our meals, ?it's probably the best ramen in the area, and don't hate me but I think LA ramen is better. ?4.5 stars...

I went to Totto Ramen yesterday with the lovely Ms. Dina, and decided this is worthy of a video review. For all those that have never watched Parks and Recreation, please do yourself a favor and click the link while it's still live: http://www.hulu.com/watc… Totto Ramen uses a chicken based broth for all of its noodles, and has a pretty cool logo of a chicken in a bowl. I actually didn't know this when I walked into the restaurant, but soon as I took my first bite I was all the alarms went off in my head and I realized something was wrong. The noodles themselves are alright, and the broth is good for what it is (which is why this is a 3 star and not a 2)... but come on, let's not kid ourselves. Also I saw the chef take the bamboo shoots out of a vacuum sealed bag, and the egg was WEAK. Turkey can never beat cow, and chicken can never beat pork. There's too much collagen that you're missing out on when you use a chicken broth, which translates into a tremendous loss of flavor. My condolences for all my halal brethren, although my buddy (who shall not be named) did break halal when we had some ramen in Tokyo.

Seems to be an ongoing battle between Totto and Ippudo on which place serves the more authentic/tastier Japanese ramen. In my opinion, Totto wins. Both places have horrendous waits, but Totto consistently provides al dente noodles with an almost creamy miso broth that does the body right. I've had both their chicken and pork ramens and both are equally as good. Their appetizers with tuna (unfortunately, I forgot the exact name of them...) are also very tasty; the generous portions of tuna is well worth the affordable price and ties up the entire experience. Ordering sake is a bit unusual here though... you'll see what I mean. Personally, I prefer Totto's hole in the wall feel over Ippudo's atmosphere.

Loved this place. Sure, we went on a weekday, late evening, and there was a semi-ridiculous wait, but hey, must mean people really want this stuff, right? :) The place is small, a handful of tables squeezed together and a bar area, where you can watch the food being prepared. If you're claustrophobic or you have an exaggerated dislike of people being all up in your space, this is not the place for you. My buddy and I shared the grilled chiashu appetizer and squid yakitori. Chiashu was very tasty, loved the greens and vinaigrette that added a nice contrast. The squid was alright, probably wouldn't order it again. We then got our ramen. I got the original and added some chiashu, corn, and shiitake mushrooms. It was pretty amazing. The broth wasn't as heavy as pork-based broths, but it was very full and hit the spot. For the price, this place is up there with Ippudo. If you're looking to try a new ramen house, I'd definitely recommend Totto Ramen. Bookmark this place!

oh totto. i finally had the pleasure of visiting this place. my sisters and i arrived around 11:45 and there were already 20 people in front of us. in total, we ended up waiting about an hour, but thankfully the weather was nice out so the wait went by relatively quickly. they have a sign-in sheet on the door and they call your name when your table/stool is ready. i went with the chicken paitan ramen with pork. dude, that's some good shieeeet. i've never had ramen with chicken broth and the flavor was intense but not overpowering. it seems a bit counterintuitive to me to order pork toppings in a chicken broth and i do admit the combination of tastes isn' perfect,. my brain kept getting confused and asking me why i was doubling up on meat flavors like a fatass. maybe it's not a home run, but it sure is damn good. the pork slices were tender with a nice char on them for texture so that they weren't pieces of absolute mush (im looking at you momofuku!). i like their noodles which are the perfect amount of chewy. don't get that extra serving of noodles btw, you won't need it. (although i learned that too late). am i dying to go back? not really. i'm glad i got to try it, but i'm more of a salt-ramen type of girl and they don't offer that at totto.

Ramen here is amazing. I've been all around the world tasting ramen everywhere, and up until now, Katanaya in SF was my favorite (this is after travelling to Japan and having ramen there). However, Totto Ramen is now in the fight for number one on my list. The bowls were huge, the food came out quickly, and it is always busy! It's a little bit off the beaten path, but the trek out there for me from the Upper East Side to here was well worth it. The place is a little bit cramped, so I wouldn't recommend going with huge groups. Also, since the noodles are made practically in front of you, the place can get a bit hot at times. Combined with having spicy bowls of ramen, you could get a little uncomfortable. However, it's well worth it. I would definitely recommend it to all the people I know.

Though the wait is long, your belly will thank you ... I've usually been wary of noodle places for two reasons: (1) they are usually overhyped and (2) I can hardly find one that has non-pork broths. ?In this case, neither was an issue. While the logistical process is interesting for those, such as myself, that are used to reservations and immediate seating, the waiting for a seat is really only a hassle if you're starving. ?Gladly, I wasn't when I went. The food is good...perfectly cooked ramen with a decent variety of toppings (though some expansion in this area would be welcome). ? Prices were reasonable (even with the giant sake servings) and my stomach thanked me...so until my next meal at Totto Ramen, I'll be mentally preparing to wait on line.

As the saying goes: "Ippudo's for white people. Totto's for Asians." After hearing that the ramen here was better than reigning champion Ippudo, I knew I had to come. I'm something of a ramen fiend -- I live for a good bowl of steaming ramen, soft and charred chashu, hearty broth, and springy noodles. Totto meets my expectations. For one, it passes the line test; if people are willing to wait a long time outside a small, cramped restaurant, you know it's gotta be good. The service is alright, the decor isn't much to look at, but the food. Quite possibly the best ramen I've had in New York. I tried their Chicken Paitan Ramen, a bowl of ramen with chicken/soy sauce broth, chashu, and generously garnished with scallion and onion. The flavor of the broth was rich, the noodles were springy enough (although a bit too thin for my liking), and the chashu was just toasted enough. If you like fatty slabs of chashu, this place is for you. Every piece is half fat, half meat, all gorgeously charred. And all this for about $10. Try getting that at Ippudo. As for which is better, Ippudo or Totto, I'll have to say that for now the scales are just about even, perhaps tipping a bit towards Totto just for the value and the cleanness of the ramen overall. Compared to the Akamaru Modern at Ippudo, Totto's ramen is simpler and overall more satisfying. However, it'll probably take a few more trips to both to name a champion. I'll keep you posted. Some quick notes: Don't expect to stay a while, it's definitely not the place for a long lunch. You are expected to get in, eat, and leave; although the servers aren't pushy, it's best to not screw up the system. Also, the wait can be very long, so it's best to get there when they open. (Edit: Okay, so I've been here about 5 times in total. The only times when there wasn't a 1.5-2 hour line was when I got there when they opened. You have been warned.) Tables seat four people max. Oh, and it's cash only. And don't make the mistake of going for lunch on Sundays -- they're not open. I think that's it.

WOW!! ?I totally wasn't expecting this at all. For a party of 3, my friends and I waited almost 2 hours on a Tuesday evening. ?I was hungry, cranky, hungry, tired (just arrived on a red-eye flight that morning with no sleep) and just plain unpleasant I must admit. However, as soon as we got our Totto Spicy Ramen, everything went out the window. ?Definitely one of the best ramen houses I've ever been to, and yes even rivaling Ippudo. ?The joint is super tiny (hence the insane long lines), but it's definitely worth it! ?Absolutely amazing, I kid you not. Cash only.

I had the spicy veg bowl, with egg and sprouts thrown in extra. ?These ramen places probably are not best judged by their veg options, but I don't eat pork, so. ?I liked the look of this place a lot, and the appetizers (tried the tuna sashimi and the inari) were delicious, but the ramen itself was only okay. I was here on a Friday at 3:30pm and there was a line. ?Don't these people work?

Totto has definitely upped their game as of late. Lots of new items on the menu, and despite even longer lines, the staff is still very friendly and amenable. The noodles are better than I remember them being the first time I went, and the flavor of the broth seems to have improved as well. Some of their new appetizers are really great as well. Again, the wait is really long, but we went right upon open this time and were served almost immediately. Certainly worth trying out.

Came here on a Tuesday night and waited close to two hours in line. It's a small establishment with about 14 seats, half of which are at the counter. Service was prompt, and water was already on the table by the time we were seated. I got the Totto Extra Spicy Ramen. It's basically the house special with a small receptacle of chili oil served on the side. I tried the broth before putting any chili oil in and it was pleasantly chicken-y. It's very different from all the other pork based ramen's broths that I had. While I was sitting at the counter, I saw the chef take out a huge piece of raw tuna that looked extremely fresh. So whatever tuna dish they serve might be worth a try. Definitely come here and leave your name and go for a walk around the area as the maitre d' offers to call you back 10mins before your table is ready.

My foodie friends claimed this place had replaced Ippudo as the best ramen-ya in NYC. After an hour long wait, we finally got seated at the bar. Unlike your more common miso, shio, or tonkotsu based broths, Totto serves a chicken-based double broth which is lighter but still has a nice depth of flavor. The noodles are nice and chewy, and overall a nice bowl of ramen. Totto is a solid 3 star ramen shop, not great, not bad.

I taste the pork fat in my soup. Mmm. Waited almost an hour on a Thursday night for a party of 2. Expected. Worth it. The spicy tuna over rice was better than I expected. I'm drooling onto my laptop right now as I'm typing. I don't even like spicy tuna. The avo tuna is good too, appeared to be fresh. Of course I got the first ramen, pretty standard. Added an egg because well... it's the #1 rule in the Rule Book of Ramen. It came with 2 flimsy slices of pork but daaaaaaymmmmmme those were some mouth-watering slices. Gahhhhhhhhhhblahblahbooooo [excuse senseless gibberish here]!!@$%^&*(&^%$#@! This might just be... dare I say it, my favorite ramen place in NYC? 5+stars for everything (+ is for the outstanding service despite busy crowds and endless hungry monsters staring at them through the door)

Totto Ramen is a really cute hole-in-the-wall ramen shop. It'd be easy to miss except for one thing, the huge mess of people waiting outside. Totto is always crowded, so make sure you budget in lots of time for waiting, unless you happen to come just as they open. I've never come here and waited for less than 30 minutes. The ramen is decent and portion size is pretty good. They also do have a pretty good selection of add-ons. I really love the spicy bamboo shots, just be warned that they are VERY spicy! Broth is okay, it tastes a little watery when you compare it to the richness of the broth you get at Ippudo. This may be partly due to the chicken base they use instead of pork. Aside from the wait, my only other complaint is that it's HOT inside, like really hot. But it is a tiny ramen shop after all with an open kitchen so you really are right in the thick of things. Pretty fun to watch your food prepared if you sit at the bar.

Hole in the wall, one of the best ramen places on the east coast. I don't have bad thing to say about it except the line and the soup natzi type line and waiting system. Super fast, Super small, Super delicious. We tried the spicy ramen, miso ramen, and a side of spicy tuna don. All three we prepared in front of us as we sat at the counter. Get there early and know what you are going to order. Largest table they have is for four. If you are not there when they call you name you get moved to the end of the list.

I love this stuff. Spicy totto ramen with extra char siu pork and boiled egg, hits the spot. Yeah the wait is long because the place is super small, but whatever, you forget about how long you waited as you slurp up the noodles. Go around 5pm (right after work) and there's actually not much of a line. Not gonna lie, a little on the pricey end..$13 for a bowl of ramen is kinda ridiculous, but I'd still do it any given day.

I heard from a local that this place was on par with Ippudo but with lower prices. ?It's a small establishment so expect to wait in line. ?I came in about 11 PM (not late for me as I"m coming from CA) and didn't have to wait. ?I've heard of people waiting an hour or two which is a bit much. ?And you must be present when they call you or you'll be sent back to the line. Anyhow, back to the Ramen, ?I ordered the Totto Spicy Ramen and the Ahi Tuna appetizer. ?I'm usually not a spicy type of person as my other half likes to call me plain and vanilla when it comes to food. ?The ramen came out and I will agree that it was pretty tasty. ?The broth was flavorful and while it was spicy it wasn't over the top. ?The Ahi Tuna appetizer took 30 minutes to come out. ?Apparently they forgot about my order. ?The guy sitting next to me, they forgot about his appetizer as well. ? Overall the ramen was good, but the service needs to be improved. ?There was an water glass from the previous guest. ?I had to keep making sure that I wouldn't mix it up as they did not take it away. ?It also took awhile for me to get my check as the servers were busy chit-chatting with guests. ?Also, don't announce it to the world, that you are going to hook up a customer with a free appetizer just because he ordered it late. Ramen - 4.5 stars Ahi Tuna - 3 stars Service - 2 stars Overall ?3.5 stars.

In the quest for the best ramen in NYC, Totto puts up a very good fight. ?We were lucky to have virtually no wait (around 7pm on a weekday). ?The restaurant is very small, but that's about right for a ramen joint. ?However, the day we were there, the a/c was either not working or not working well. ?The problem with going on a summer day is that eating hot ramen in a hot restaurant does not make for an enjoyable experience. ?That said, we are talking about ramen here. We shared the Avo Tuna (a tuna/avocado appetizer) to start, which was quite good. ?The tuna was seared (I think, actually blow-torched), but still mostly raw, and it came with a yuzu garlic sauce that was a great addition to the mild fish. ?Those who are breath-conscious, beware. ?Between the garlic sauce and the large amount of scallions, this one is a killer. After that, I had the Totto Chicken Paitan Ramen. ?Totto did a very nice job with this dish. ?The noodles were cooked well, the pork was delicious, and the portion size was good. ?I could have done with some more in the ramen (and a pork broth over a chicken broth). ?However, based on what was served, this is a solid bowl of ramen...just not the best in NYC.

Loosen your belts because your belly's going to need the space! haha. ?Totto Ramen receives two chopsticks up! I've seen pictures and trailers of the place, but you need to just go and experience it straight up! Sure there is a wait, but trust me, it is completely worth it. ? ATMOSPHERE: A very intimate, close quarters store. ?Probably could seat only 20 including bar and table seating. It is very homey and has a family vibe to the place. ?All the cooks and waiters seem like really good friends and they all have cheery and great personalities. ?The place is clean, casual and small. SERVICE: Great personalities. We ended up getting to know 3-4 of the guys really well. They are nice, hilarious and gave us great recommendations. ?Not your usual all business and dry places. FOOD: Holy Moly! I could eat ramen the rest of my life. They make their own stock from scratch and you can just taste the flavor. The flavor was exploding and so oishii! There is no msg and they just build all their flavors one on top of another. I have heard first hand stories that people prefer this over ramen places IN JAPAN. ?I had the Miso Ramen and it was delish. They gave you two pieces of the softest pork in the world, I would order an extra topping of that next time for sure. The miso they put right in the middle so your whole bowl doesn't taste like miso right away and you can slowly add it to your meal. ?The portions are generous and large enough and the price isn't over the top or ridiculous. Great overall deal for taste, price and portions. ? SUMMARY: If you want arguably the best ramen in New York, look no further. ?However expect an average of 30 minutes to 1 hour wait. ?That is the only downside however your belly will be grateful afterwards. ?We came during a less busy time on a less busy day so the wait was only 20 minutes at most I believe. ?Also, don't bring a party more than 3, 4 is ok too. It is really hard to sit together with that many people, its meant for small parties.

The best Cha Siu pork out of any Ramen place in the city. Their pork is torched with a bit of char and the fat seems to be more jelly like; fat and meat is evenly distributed and I can honestly finish all of the pork even with all the fat. ?Can't say that about the pork at places like Ippundo and Kambi. ?As for the chicken broth (no pork broth at this place), all I really taste is salt, garlic and pepper so not too special. ?I would like to go back but for the 2 hr wait, it is not worth it.

Last year, I spent some time in Japan and fell in love with authentic Japanese ramen. Since I got back to the states, I've been unable to find a bowl of ramen on par with what I had in Tokyo. As any ramen lover will attest to: good ramen is a dish that both fills the stomach and warms the soul. The ramen here at Totto does just that. If you'd like an authentic slice of Japan, definitely check this place out. Expect to be waiting outside for a while (1 - 2 hours), but don't worry, it's well worth it!

After two very satisfied spicy ramen meals...I decided to try out the Veggie Ramen. I was a bit skeptical when what looked like a salad appeared before me, but OH man the best salad/ramen ever!! Add two pieces of char-siu pork and a little extra broth and this dish is PERFECT! I got it spicy of course, and the broth is so clean and light. I still love the spicy ramen...and I am having a seriously hard time deciding which is my favorite but I came back to this cramped little restaurant twice in the same week to get another taste of the veggie ramen. Mm..i wonder which one I will try next. Never disappoints me :) I love you totto Oh, I forgot to mention the spicy tuna donburi is quite good as an appetizer!

Finally I can proudly say I have been to Totto Ramen! It is so tiny and packed that I never manage to get a table without a long wait. Luckily today I walked here right after 5 PM and discovered there were 2 available seats at the counter! I was so thrilled to sit down even though the boiling broth with probably one thousand onions were fuming in my face and I wanted to cry. I got the menu and I must say the price is surprisingly low! I ordered the EXTREME Spicy Ramen, thinking my stomach is going to have a riot in about 10 minutes. Then I got my ramen bowl and I was a bit surprised. The soup looked creamy but certainly not spicy. It is funny when the waiter gave me the hot sauce on the side. He absolutely underestimated my ability to tolerate spice. I decided to add half the bowl of hot sauce in my soup. Oh man.. the broth is to die for and probably the best I have had. It is creamy, savory and yet clear. I saw with my eyes they filtered out the foam residue from the chicken broth and that is why the soup is clear. you could taste right away it is chicken broth, not pork. So back to the spicy soup. It is by no means close to being spicy. My hobby is eating Chinese hot pot and trying every hot sauce but this is a JOKE. It is not spicy at all. Nevertheless, I still love it! The noodles comes with 2 big pieces of sliced charshu pork. It is quite tender and flavorful but I think Minca in East Village wins on the pork tenderness and flavor. I would be happy to come back (hopefully with no wait) to try other bowls of noodles soup.

It's not everyday, especially on weekdays, that I venture out of midtown for an errand. ? It then dawned upon me; there were some ramen shops to be explored in midtown (after exhausting all my options in the East village). ? As I scanned my iPhone for "Ramen", Totto Ramen displayed. ?Only 1.3 miles, kind of far for a cold day. Crazy or just a foodie who loves to eat ramen? ?I go with the latter. The walk wasn't too far since i had a goal in mine. Plus, I'm burning off calories in advance! Win-Win situation. 1. Ramen: ?1 point. The ramen was thick and freshly made. ?Bouncy, non-starchy, and perfectly cooked for slurping. ?Noodles were flavorful because it easily absorbed the broth. ?It was so good I had to order seconds. Kaedama oengaishiasu! I should have walked another mile. 2. Broth: ? 1 point Totto Ramen specializes in chicken broth. ?Initially, I was afraid that ?it will not be as good as the pork broth. ?However, rest assured, the chicken broth was equally as good. ?The broth wasn't too heavy and commanded a strong chicken stock flavor. ?The broth also glistened with droplets of chicken fat, which is a plus! I wish chicken noodle soup can use this broth as the base! This was actually one of the few soup base that I drank and didn't feel as I needed to drink a gallon of water. Flavorful yet not too salty. Perfect. 3. Egg: ?1/2 point I had to order a side of egg since it did not come with the ramen. ?My egg came whole and was not cut in half, nor was it one of those "runny eggs with slight under-cook yolk." ? Why Why Why? Perhaps that was their intention. The soy sauce flavored egg was pretty good but it was a bit on the salty side. Why is the quest to find a slightly under-cook egg so hard? 4. ?Toppings/Compliments: ?1/2 point Your standard pork and veggies in ramen. The usual vegetables (Wood-ear mushrooms, scallions, bamboo shoots) were good and fresh. ?Kind of a bummer that egg doesn't come with the ramen. 5. Side Dishes: ?1 point This is where the fatty pork shined. The extra sides of fatty pork was super fatty and delicious-melt in your mouth goodness. ?Be sure to order a side of that as these differ from the regular fatty pork that comes with your ramen. ?I guess if you pay a little more, you get a little more. Total Score: 4/ 5 Chicken broth ramen. Can I get a cluck cluck here and a cluck cluck there?

Ridiculously long wait for the best ramen in NYC. ?Will I come again? Of course I will but certainly at a time when the wait is under 20 mins and not 90 minutes. ?My husband and I are pigs so of course we had to have 3 apps before the main course. I got the ?uni don - not recommended. I'm a huge uni lover and this was a waste of space in my stomach due to the lack of freshness of the uni and blandness of the dish overall. The tuna and avocado app was good, however. Nice light ponzu sauce on it. The pork buns were disappointing. The pork wasn't a fatty, juicy, sizzling piece of pork like I had expected, more like a boiled, BBQ sauce flavored piece of pork. ?Ippudo and momofuku's crush totto's pork buns. The spicy ramen was delicious as was the paitan ramen. Make sure to get the soft boiled egg, it's the bomb. No need for the avocado and if u get the spicy sesame oil u can get one and share it with the table. Loved it so much I'm thinking of bringing a to go container next time. (I'm sure they'd love that!)

It was really cold last Friday and I really wanted something hearty and comforting. I saw Totto Ramen had vegetarian ramen on the menu and knew that was the place. I was running late, so the hubby put us on the list. When I got there, there were about 10 tables ahead of us, which I was fine with... until I saw how tiny the place is. I was a little worried, but more because I was cold and there was no place to wait inside. Total wait time for us was about 45 minutes, which wasn't too bad because we weren't that hungry when we got there. Hubby and I were seated at the bar, which was cool because we could see everything the cooks were doing. It's amazing they can put out such high-caliber meals in a space about the size of my own dinky little NY kitchen. We both ordered the spicy vegetable ramen. My mouth is watering just thinking about it - the broth was rich and spicy, the noodles were perfectly cooked, and the vegetables were fresh and vibrant. I was surprised at how flavorful it was, considering the broth is not meat-based. Service was fast and efficient. Not super friendly, but it's not really a sit-and-linger kind of place. More like a sit-your-butt-down-and-get-slurping kind of place. It's definitely worth the wait and we will definitely be back soon.

To date, this place has the best ramen I've ever eaten. ?So why only three stars? 1. Ridiculously long wait to get inside, on a dingy, supercrowded sidewalk with dozens of other hungry people - and I have a short temper, especially when I'm hungry 2. The spot is TINY, seriously one of the smallest restaurants ever - to shorten our wait time, we once shared a table with another couple - which ended up being great, thank goodness, but even so... 3. Cash only I can't tell you how many times I've waited on the line for at least 25 minutes, with five more names ahead of mine on the list, only to get fed up and head elsewhere. ?The plus side to this is that I discovered several places in the nabe that are also excellent (Pure Thai Shophouse, Danji, etc.) but I can't tell you how annoying it is to wait that long for a bowl of noodles - even if that bowl is pure excellence - al dente, chewy and delicious ramen noodles in the most perfectly balanced salty chicken broth, and delicious chunks of rich and fatty pork meat. ?The portions are huge and the service is also great - the entire staff is really sweet and patient. ?So, yes... the line is merited, but ugh. ?Try to get there before the dinner rush and on a rainy night - maybe the wait will only be 20 minutes if you're lucky.

I've heard lots of good stuff about totto and how it's comparable to ippudo but it definitely is NOT. I got the spicy ramen and it was nothing spectacular. Broth is heartier than some other places but had one flavor, no complexity. I waited over an hour and a half on a Tuesday night... Not worth it

This place gets busy even before it opens! Equipped with a wait list to sign in outside it's doors, make sure you get there well before it opens to get your name on there or else wait hours to get a seat. It's that good. Real authentic ramen makes the packaged ones a joke. Seriously good MSG free ramen.

First time having ramen that doesn't involve a plastic wrapper and a seasoning packet; blown away at the difference. ?Also the first time I've ever paid more than $6 for a bowl soup (I'm used to vietnamese pho, which is inexpensive by comparison (but much different)), the ramen was somethng like 14 or 15 dollars (but worth every cent IMHO). The wait was a bit annoying on such a hot day (as we missed getting seats by 1 person and had to wait another 30 minutes), so get there early and get your name on the list. ?Once we got in, we were fortunate to sit at the bar, definitely the place to sit. ?We had a very "interactive" dining experience with the laid back and crazy (in the good way) Japanese cooks, they posed for goofy photos, but were just very entertaining to watch (while not posing). ? Good: + cool and entertaining cooks who interact + great food + worth the price Not so good: - fills up FAST/small dining area - kinda of hot inside on a hot day (I think I'm just used to all places having A/C (like we have here in Texas)). - can't buy the awesome Totto Ramen shirts the cooks wear - located 1800-ish miles from my house

I just got back from a late lunch at Totto Ramen and boy am I happy. ?Arrived there at 2 and was seated almost immediately at the bar with my two friends. ?I ordered the Extremely Spicy Ramen which comes with scallions, pork belly, and a piece of seaweed. ?The hot sauce that makes the ramen spicy comes on the side so you can determine how "extremely" spicy it actually is which, I guess, is good. ?I dumped the entire container into my soup and it turned atomic red. ?mmm...spicy. ?The noodles and broth were pretty similar to what they have at Hide-chan (sister store). ? While the two stores are similar, I think what makes Totto better was the atmosphere. ?We sat at the bar and got to watch the guys make the ramen -- using the torch to char the pork belly, scooping the soup, dunking the ramen. ?It was all light-hearted -- joking around with customers and each other while were dancing to the pop music playing on the radio. ?Fun guys! ?Can't wait to go back! ?Who wants to come?

**This place gets an additional star for my main man chef Taquito. The Chef has a great spirit and jubilance about him and often works his magic on the noodles while singing and dancing to Michael Jackson tunes. I've had the pleasure of sitting behind him twice as he works into the night, and his cheery nature alone boosts Totto up by one more star! You really don't have a choice, but try to sit at the bar and you'll know what I mean! (photo attached) Furthermore, they've recently put up one of those protective thingies in front of the store that will keep people warm from the cold. Another nice touch for those who wait a bagillion hours in the cold to taste this yummy cuisine. Finally, next time you go, check out the staff. Is it just me or wouldn't they be a perfect cast for an EPIC samurai movie? **

I've been to several other ramen places in the city and Flushing, but this is the first one I'm reviewing (because they're that great!). There was a 40 minute wait, and the anticipation from all the rave was starting to get to me, but when I finally went in and sat down, I knew it was gonna be something special! 1st of all, these guys are actually Japanese. 2nd, they cook and prepare everything right in your face, which just boosts the experience level through the roof. Now, about the food, lol... IT'S FREAKING AWESOME!!!!!! I took my friend here who was visiting from Australia, and boy was he impressed. It was our last meal together before his flight out later that day, and we couldn't have asked for anything better. The menu isn't large or overly complicated, so decision making is pretty straight forward. Either you like it normal, spicy, or REALLY spicy. There are a bunch of sides you can get, which, to be honest, aren't even necessary. I finished every last drop of my bowl, and thank every single worker individually as I walked out with a huge smile on my face. They'll be seeing me again really soon.

Totto Ramen is like a Japanese diner. Food being prepared fast but skilfully before your very eyes, and you leave pretty much as soon as you're done. Honestly I still have a bit of a hard time justifying paying more than $5 for a bowl of noodle soup but I guess sometimes I just gotta suck it. Came here with a friend for dinner; already there was a waitlist at 5:30 pm. We got in quickly enough, and had waters ready at the seats we were directed to. I got the miso ramen, and my friend got the super spicy ramen. The ramen noodles themselves were very al dente. I'm not sure if I like that aspect entirely, I think I prefer a more QQ texture. The slices of pork that came with the noodles were pre-fired before being put in the bowl - a little too tough of a cut for me. My friend's spicy ramen actually didn't come spicy; it came with a little dish of chili you could dunk into your bowl. It really wasn't very spicy. It's very black-peppery, but not my-tongue-is-on-fire spicy. Verdict: I wouldn't in my right mind travel all the way here just for their noodles, much less wait in line, but I guess my meal was ok.

I LOVE THIS PLACE! The wait is sooo worth it. I have eaten at many many ramen places and this one tops them all. The chewiness of their noodles, the broth and the toppings are gratifying and perfect. It definitely hits the spot on a rainy day. I especially love their spicy tonkatsu ramen. You can ask for the spicy sauce on the side. Also, note this place is cash only!

After my lovely but ultimately less than earth-shattering experience at sister restaurant Hide-Chan, I wasn't sure what to expect out of Totto Ramen. Early on, it'd gotten a huge amount of mainstream food blogger attention, and if there's anything I'm reverse-racist about, it's when Americans get excited about Asian restaurants. Still, I worship the Totto empire, and getting off early from work one day, I decided to make the pilgrimage to the West side. Initial signs were encouraging: short staircase down into the narrow space, explosively steaming pots behind the counter, the smell of chicken heavy in the air, a couple of Japanese cooks in bandanas shouting their welcomes at me. It was the most authentic-feeling, friendliest ramen-ya I'd been in in NYC besides the old Sapporo (whose food couldn't live up to the setting, though I have not revisited since its renovation). I nodded at the cooks and took a seat in a stool. Less than a minute later, my order was in -- the options are few, and I went with the purist choice, the Totto chicken paitan ramen. Less than two minutes after that, the bowl was in front of me. The chicken-based broth was spectacular. I thought that deserved to be in its own paragraph. I'd always assumed that the sujebi soup at Arirang in Koreatown would be the most nuclear blast of capital-C Chicken I would ever have the privilege of tasting, but Totto's paitan ramen edges it out. It's so creamy, so chickeny that it's difficult to capture the experience in words: a burst of primary colors after a lifetime in black-and-white. Ramen is the most holistic of all noodle soups, so a broth alone cannot make the bowl. Luckily, the noodles are gorgeously springy specimens, easily better than those at Ippudo, Setagaya, and, oddly, Hide-Chan. And the char siu slices are as perfect as Hide-Chan's, not only standing tall in that dynamo of a chicken broth, but melding seamlessly with it in an indescribable melange of animal flavors. A single bowl of ramen is usually more than enough to sate me, but here I ordered a kaedama, i.e., an extra helping of noodles to dump into my leftover broth. It's virtually a second bowl for $2.50. I finished it just as quickly, then noisily slurped up the remaining soup, honoring Japanese tradition as best I could. I don't give five stars for a single visit very often. But Totto Ramen serves up a bowl of ramen that I like significantly more than the pork bomb at Ippudo or the tightrope-balanced hakata of Rockmeisha. Indeed, the only two ramen bowls I've had in the States that I like more are at the holy ground of Santouka in Edgewater, NJ, and [REDACTED NYC ESTABLISHMENT HERE; YOU WILL HAVE TO TORTURE ME OR BE MY ONE TRUE LOVE TO FIND OUT]. I'm going to go even further and put Totto Ramen in the upper echelon of best solo dinner spots in the city, period. You could bring a date here, of course, but you better be ready for her tongue to taste like chicken. As I got up to leave, the usual Japanese chorus of goodbyes caressed me. For the first time in my life, instead of just bowing my head slightly, I actually turned to my ramen cook and said, "Gochisou-sama deshita!" He smiled. "Arigatou." Arigatou yourself, Totto Ramen. Probability of return within 1 year: 100%

Few would consider ramen to be good hot weather food. ?However, when Totto opened, I felt compelled to schlep (schvitzing all the way) to the outer regions of Midtown to check out. At Totto Ramen, Mr. Muneketa (of Yakitori Totto, Aburiya Kinnosuke, Soba Totto, etc fame) has called upon the services of Chef Hideto Kawahara, who is allegedly a ramen legend in the Fukuoka prefecture of Japan. Here, Kawahara plies his skills in the form of chicken paitain ramen, miso ramen, vegetarian ramen, each with iteratively spicier doppelgangers available for additional cost. If you're lucky enough to score a seat at the bar, you'll be treated to dinner (or lunch) and a show. Before you, a trio of resolute looking cooks churn through service in the open air kitchen. The char siu pork shoulder is slowly braised, rendering the normally tough cut of meat into an unbelievably tender bite. Watch as the bits of pork are blow torched à la minute, giving the exterior of the pork a crispy charred contrast, while the interior remains ethereally moist and delicate. Collagen is a beautiful thing. Rich people pay a lot of money to have it injected into their faces, and at Totto Ramen, chicken collagen is gleaned to form a rich, gelatinous, hearty broth. The velvety texture of the soup was on par with what I consider to be the New York ramen all-stars - Ippudo and Minca. Watch as the cook manning the noodle station plucks noodles from a vat of water with an expert snap of his wrist, flourishing and flicking the noodles to expel excess moisture. The noodles were evocative of an ideal ramen noodle - thoroughly cooked, yet 'ha gotai' or al dente, springy, tender, satisfying. The ramen is completed with the obligatory strip of nori, crunchy scallions, and discretionary toppings such as bean sprouts, mushrooms, boiled eggs. I've always thought that the East Village held the uncontested edge in ramen domination. However, Totto Ramen deserves honorable mention in the hall of ramen fame.

My gosh..the wait was so long! 2 hours for ramen!! I don't think I've ever waited that long for ramen, let alone- food. The place is small and can only hold a maximum around 20 people at one time. I got the super spicy chicken ramen, so that I can have the spicy sesame oil sauce on the side. I didn't come close to using it all. I liked how I can control the level of spiciness. It was pretty delicious and broth was yummy on its own, but I felt like there could've been more noodles. ?The ramen overall was good though and tasted way more fresh than any "cup of noodles" and other ramen I've had. The wait was just insanely long though..definitely come when you're not starving. :P Also, place is Cash Only and put your name on that sign-up sheet right when you get there! If they call your name and you're not there, they said you go to the BOTTOM of the list! harsh, but fair. ?When we left, I still saw people who were waiting with us outside...

Delicious ramen (probably my second favorite in the city after Ippudo) and delicious sides (the spicy tuna over rice is great) and prices are reasonable but the restaurant is very small and the wait is not worth it. Twice went before it even opened and still couldn't get in during the first seating and waited an hour (and both times I was alone so I wasn't even waiting for a table or anything). Went a 3rd time with someone and got in during the first seating (but then again, we got there almost an hour early, so basically, you're still waiting an hour). Plus you always feel rushed especially with all the glaring eyes outside waiting to get in. The food is really good but not sure I want to wait that long again to get in. I'd rather just go to Sapporo then. Especially since each seating seems to take forever and for such a small place, it's not fast. Making the wait outside even longer.

My enduring memory of this place will be those 45 minutes when the three of us were packed in the little plastic-covered reception area - focused on the waiting list hung up on the door. ? You can cut the tension with a knife - you and the 12 other people packed into the small space are eye-ing the list...then eye-balling each other...how many are in their party? ?Will they give up and leave, allowing you to advance on this list? ? Are those people at table 2 leaving? Is the waiter walking towards us now? Is it our turn yet? Some lightweights, overwhelmed by the tension and the knife-like stares from fellow prospective diners, leave with a sheepish shrug of the shoulders. ?Every now and then a group is ushered into the restaurant casting gloating glances over their shoulders..."so long, suckers" they seem to say. Eventually, we too pass into the hallowed space...and are left feeling a little hollow. ?Was this worth it? ?I'm not convinced...the ramen was good...but not as good as Ippudo. ?Will I be back...I'm not sure?

Only had to wait about half an hour for dinner on a Saturday (got there a little past 6)..not too shabby! Definitely get there earlier to beat the rush! The place can fit maybe 20 people and it gets packed. Don't come here with more than a group of 4 people or you'll have to be split up anyway. Was it better than Ippudo? I'm not sure about that. I would say the two are on par though and delicious in different ways. The experience at Totto is definitely more authentic to what you would actually experience in Japan and not as trendy. The broth is also chicken based rather than pork based as it is at Ippudo. I got the spicy ramen and it was delicious! Definitely get an egg on top for only $1, so worth it! Cash only (which is unfortunate) so come prepared.

After several attempts at visiting Totto, I was euphoric when I finally got in (granted it was at 10:45 on a tuesday night). ?The hype was high to begin, and the 20 minute wait made it even more astronomical. ?There are no reservations as you approach the hanging clipboard at the door and hope that there aren't 2 pages of names that haven't been crossed off before yours. Totto is a dive like Minca or Rai Rai Ken, and it makes Ippudo look like a palace. There's a long bar that seats about 10 where you get a great view of the vats of pork and chicken ramen broth, and there are also a handful 2 or 4-tops in the really cramped space. Because of the ever-growing line of people who wait outside the door, don't expect to be able to have a leisurely meal full of witty conversation. Even my group of 3 was not so subtly rushed out once we finished our meals at around 11:45. With these expectations of the wait and rush, I let my spicy totto ramen with pork broth ?do the talking. Totto's spicy ramen is around $10, cheaper than ippudo or momofuku, but it also has less accoutrements--while it has scallions, 2 pieces of char siu pork, bean sprouts, and a big piece of nori, other things that I might usually see in a ramen like bamboo shoots and a hard-boiled egg were missing. At least those are all elements that you can get for extra on the menu. Enough about the way it looks, the taste was amazing yet different. While the spicy ramen had the porkiness of a good tonkatsu broth, there was also the spicy chili oil that floated on top which added a refined korean shin ramen flavor to it. That is a compliment. Noodles were chewy, the seared pork slices were rich, and the broth was comforting. There was little conversation except for slurping or sighing once the bowls of ramen arrived...definitely a sign of a good meal.

A belated birthday dinner for me and a friend who had no understanding of what Japanese Ramen was. I'll sum it up, just as I did for him. ? It's all about the pork belly, soup broth, and the delicious fresh al dente ramen noodles. Upon arrival the door was closed at 7 PM and we were told we'd have to wait til 8 PM. ?We put our name on the clipboard and when the hostess came out, we asked why 8 PM? ?We were told they ran out of their broth. ?Boo! ?I was about to cry, but alas she said to wait and we'd be served soon. ?This wait turned most patrons away, which made our wait even shorter. ?We only waited another 15mins and we finally got it. ? Along with our order of Ramen, we also tried the Char Siu Mayo Don. ?The lovely spread of pork belly on rice impressed my Ramen virgin friend. ?It was delicious, albeit I could've used less of the mayo. ?The pork was juicy & succulent and perfectly charred. Now to the ramen. ?It was perfectly wavy ramen served al dente. ?The miso broth is my favorite broth*. ?The egg complimented everything and held it all together. ?This is probably the first time I didn't question the portion sizing of the pork. ?They're very generous with the pork! ?My friend was surprisingly pleased with this new discovery. ?In the past he'd only had Sapporo (http://www.yelp.com/biz/…) near work. ?He had a ill-contrived idea in his head that all Ramen tasted like Sapporo. I wish this place was slightly closer to work. ?I'd come for lunch at least once a week. ?Service was a pleasure and the place is tiny but comfortable. ?They even have a place for the winter bags & clothing articles. ?There are metal shelves on the walls above the tables to put your stuff! *How come they don't have Miso broth hot pot?

Totto Ramen has done a stand up job in growing as they did from their first couple opening weeks where they were working their kinks out - to today's high standards. Allow me to illustrate. I had previously complained about way too much garlic in my ramen during my first visit (http://www.flickr.com/ph…). Now, the proportions are much much better and do without a full layer of garlic over the whole bowl. Totto Ramen has, in essence, redeemed themselves in my eyes. I really do enjoy the Miso Ramen. And although I cannot stomach spicy, they do offer an "Extreme Spicy Ramen" too (which I hear is quite enjoyable for those that enjoy a tasty fire in their mouths). One of my favorite dishes that can be found on printed signs along the window or walls is the Yaki Uni Don. If they are offering this and you enjoy sea urchin, I would highly recommend ordering it. As the description noted, Yaki Uni Don is torched sea urchin with the chef's special sauce served over rice, cucumber, and Kombu seaweed. I split this with my dining companion, but in reality, I wish that I had ordered one to hoard all for my own. ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? , ? . ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ?

And if you opt to wait in the little erected weather barrier, be prepared to feel like a sardine with many other people. During the really cold days, they will sometimes put a heater in there - which is great unless you get the freaks who take off their boots to warm their feet by the heater. Can you say, -gag-?

I am conflicted. . .40 min wait for ramen, but it was sooooo GOOD. ? This IS NOT a place you want to go for a big group. ?The max is probably 5 people for a table and the wait is at least 40 minutes. For 2, it may be a 20 minute wait depending on when you go. This is the first time that I had a chicken based ramen...heaven in a piping hot bowl! ?My add ons: scallions and spicy bamboo shoots. ? Definitely loved the spicy bamboo shoots. I am not a fan of spicy oil, but needed some heat. ?The bamboo was perfect because it was covered in a spicy paste. I will definitely come back, but probably during the less busy hours.

I did the unthinkable... I ordered the Vegetarian Ramen. o_0 Just to tease myself I also ordered a side of pork which defeats the purpose but like the great Ron Burgundy likes to say, "when in Rome...". To be quite honest, I didn't even need the pork. I was using it as a crutch. In the event the ramen was off or missing something I would shove the pork in my mouth and tell myself everything would be okay. That the $11 I would have to spend on vegetables was worth it. The broth had great flavor (I did taste a lot of sesame oil) and was really light but not watery. The fine assortment of vegetables made me feel like I was eating healthy...so healthy that I needed to enjoy it with a beer, then head to a wine bar afterward for some maple bacon ice cream with a glass of Sauvignon Blanc. What? 5 stars for the Vegetarian Ramen. I never thought I would say this but maybe I'll try to go down the vegetarian route. HAHA! Who am I kidding? But, I SHALL return and order the ramen WITHOUT the pork.

Ambiance: 1 Food Quality: 1 ? Service: 1 Value: 1 The Gist: Totto Ramen came very highly recommended by a friend of mine so naturally I had to check it out. In this case, curiosity killed the cat! This may possibly be the worst dining experience I have ever had in NYC. The only rational explanation I could come up with for the long line of people of people waiting to sign the clipboard to subject themselves to this terrible excuse for food is that the restaurant only seats about 20 people. For those of you interested in ambiance, the bathroom also houses the restaurant's dirty dishes!! For those of you interested in service, our noodle dish came out too spicy so we requested another and the waiter took our dish turned 360 degrees and put down the SAME EXACT BOWL! For those of you interested in value, two ramen soups and two beers came out to over $50! The bottom line is, If you find yourself hungry in hells kitchen you would be better off eating anywhere else than Totto Ramen!

AMAZING and totally blows ippudo out of the water! Came here for lunch on a thursday around 11:15 am and got seated by noon. There seems to always be a wait here, but it's well worth it, I tell you! I got the spicy tuna bowl and the chicken broth ramen with char siu. Both were excellent. In fact, the ramen was probably the best I have ever had in my entire life. The noodles were cooked to the perfect degree of chewiness and the broth (which had been cooked for over 6 hours!) was flavorful, hearty, not greasy, and didn't have visible pieces of fat floating around. The char-siu had a crispy outside and a tender center, which was a unique and refreshing approach to ramen meat. The spicy tuna bowl had a delicious sauce mixed in with generously cut chunks of fresh spicy tuna over rice. The best part of the whole experience was sitting at the bar and watching the chef and his assistant prepare each dish. My friend and I chatted with the ramen chef for a bit while he worked and we were both blown away by the pride he took in his work. He was also happily singing along to the Japanese pop playing in the background while he prepared our food. He also gave us spicy sauce to put in with our ramen, since according to him, "it makes the ramen taste better!" ?And it did! His friendly demeanor and the care he put into making each and every bowl definitely made the ramen taste that much better. Definitely work the wait and would love to come back if I am ever in the area!

Wow. ?I hate being one of those people who gives five stars to the totally hyped New York hole in the wall, but Totto Ramen is going to force me to do it. I had the spicy ramen (not the super spicy one, just the regular spicy one) with pork and extra noodles. ?The pork was both tasty and tender. ?The noodles were perfectly cooked. ?The portion size was awesome (and the guy even had me eat my regular portion before giving me my extra noodles so that he could fit more in my bowl). The ramen was great. ?The service was great. ?The atmosphere was friendly. ?The only criticisms that I could possibly come up with are that it was a very small space, and all that they do is ramen. ?Of course, that's probably why they do ramen so very well.

4.5 stars please!!!! Who knew Chicken broth ramen would be soooo good!!!! I didn't think it would be possible.... but for once, I didn't miss the pork broth at all... Ohhhhhh and they torch the hell out of those seductive pork belly pieces! though I wouldn't call them "char siu" (that's Big Wong's thing)... And if you like spicy, you're in for a treat! Their house made Rayu (spicy sesame oil) is tongue burning, garlicky goodness! No MSG, wow! really? Can it be this umami overload and no msg at all? amazing! love it. There's always a wait, unless you go before 6:30pm to beat the crowd, but even if there's a line, it's totally worth it... and tables turn around rather quickly.

I came here yesterday (6/7/10) with other Yelpers after the Yelp Country Club event. ?I have yet to try ramen from shops since all of the ramen hype. ? I have had ramen before at some place in the East Village, but it was a while ago and I forgot the name, or even exactly where the place was located. ? Anyways, we got here about 10:45pm. ?On the site it says that this place closes at 12am but really this place closes at 11pm. ? We were limited on what we could order. ?It was either the Chicken ramen or the spicy ramen or a side of edamame. ? I figured since they were closing, menu pickings were limited. ? I ordered the Chicken ramen. ?The noodles were okay, the broth for me was too salty. ? I wished there were more pieces of meat, (pork?, it tasted like pork) Anyways the meat was nice and flavorful and tender. ? I liked how they put chopped up garlic pieces, that gave it a nice flavor but be prepared for some major garlic breath. ? It was also garnished with nori pieces and scallions. ? I didn't get to finish it, I was kind of full from earlier before. ? The chicken ramen was $9.25. ? ?The servers were very nice and I noticed when there were customers arriving, everyone said something, maybe it was a greeting in Japanese. ? I read that they just recently opened. ?The place was small. ?They had seating at the bar, I didn't see how many seats. ? There were also tables. ?One table that could seat 4 and either two or three tables that seat 2. ?Our group had 6 people so we had to be split up. ? Since this place is in Midtown, I doubt I will ever come back here, unless I am in the Midtown area and there is no other place to eat and I am starving.

After this place has been opened for about a week, a few of us got here at 10:45PM on a weeknight to grab some dinner. This place was pretty small, that our group of 6 had to be split up 4 to 2. We've got seated and menus were given to us. Since I was not that hungry I wanted something small and this is how the conversation went with the waiter: Me: Hi, can I have an order of Pork Toro Buns? Waiter: No, don't have Me: Um...okay an order of Grilled Pork Toro Waiter: No Me: ?.... Waiter: (pointing at the menu) We have edamame, Totto Chicken Ramen and Totto Spicy Ramen. Everything no. Me: Uh...I'll have the Totto Chicken Ramen I thought because we came here near closing that their kitchen was about to close, so the menu selections were limited. Turns out it's because they were so newly opened that they did not have the rest of the items on their menu yet. I mean I feel bad for all their waitstaff having to tell all their customers repeatedly what is available and what is not available. The Totto Chicken Ramen was pretty good. I really like the garlicky broth. My theory is anything with garlic is already delicious! (Okay sometimes that is not true, but I still love garlic!) Although, it is called a Totto Chicken Ramen, it means it's chicken broth soup with slices of pork. The pork was very tender and flavorful, which I liked a lot. The noodles were springy, just the way I like it. It is not the best ramen I've had, but I wouldn't mind coming back here again to try other things on their menu. Hopefully, the next time that I return I will not be denied ordering any of the items from their menu.

CiCi's favorite: Totto Extreme Spicy Ramen $10.25 What to expect: I usually order extra Kikurage Mushroom, Boiled Egg, and Bean Sprouts with my Ramen. The Ramen is cooked just perfect. The soup is full of sweetness and fresh taste of chicken. It's very spicy, but at the same time, I really enjoy it - It feels like the moment in life where you just finished with all your final tests - the liberation! Side notes: The wait is always long, so either be there at 5pm on the dot, or 10:30pm before closing. Otherwise, your waiting time is about 1 hour. Full review: http://tinyurl.com/246n2…

Thick, hand cut noodles. Rich, savory broth. Charred, hand-torched cuts of fatty chashu. All topped by a heavenly scoop of miso and ground pork. This has got to be one of the best bowls of ramen I've ever had. I came here with a friend for a late lunch (which seems about the best time to go anywhere trendy in NYC--same food, shorter line) where ten bucks gets you a bowl of the afore mentioned goodness. Breaking up the ball of miso and stirring it into the broth elevates the deliciousness of the broth, while miso paste still clinging to the chunks of ground pork give the pork a fuller, more robust flavor. You also get a front row seat as you watch the ramen chefs prepare your food. It's perfect for building up the anticipation before delivering a perfect finish. Totto Ramen is a definite must in my book.

Last week when it was cold, dreary, rainy and miserable, Totto Ramen was my beacon in the storm. ?My two friends and I trekked the two blocks over, only to find a small wait at 11:58 - luckily we got the last three seats at the counter pretty much right away. Totto is just like a lot of the smaller ramen joints - teeny, narrow, no frills. We ordered two of the spicy pork and one of the chicken miso, plus a side of the "broiled" char siu. The ramen came quite quickly. My spicy ramen warmed me to the core, but it wasn't particularly spicy (I'd like to try the EXTREMELY spicy), however the broth was quite tasty. It came with two slices of pork. The pork is tender and fatty, and thinly sliced - I like my fatty pork cut slightly heftier, but the quality of the pork is excellent. ?While the soup was good and the noodles had the perfect amount of chew, I was missing the goodies that usually come in soup - I had a few garlic flakes, two slices of pork, and one slice of seaweed. My friends Chicken Miso fared slightly better in the broth department in terms of having a full bowl - she even got an egg (an egg is probably my favorite accompaniment to ramen). Her noodles were slightly different than mine, still good but slightly more mushy. The miso was not overpowering. The char siu was awesome, the same pork that was in the ramen but "broiled" (aka taking a small blowtorch to it). It's slightly more expensive and slightly less good than Ippudo, or Minca - but it gets a whole star from me for being near my office. I'm sure once winter hits I will be there all the time when it's freezing and I need me some comfort.

Totemo ii desu!! ?Very good ramen. ?Know that this is fatty, oily, salty food but if your stomach can handle it, I say go for it. ?The noodles are what homemade ramen noodles should taste like; firm and full of flavor. ?The char siu pork is seared with a blowtorch and placed on top of the ramen, and the spicy toto ramen boasts a cup full of roasted hot chili oil. ?It is easy to carb-overload here, so watch it. ? While the food is excellent, the wait is painful. ?No reservations are taken, and shortest line I have seen exceeds 45 minutes.

Just had the extra large ramen there and for me the Tonkotsu ramen should have a very creamy porky taste. ?The ramen I had didn't feel like a tonkotsu ramen but rather like a ordinary pork soup ramen. ?Without a strong broth which is a crucial component, I just can't rate it highly.

Yet another ramen shop pops up in NYC, I love it! NYC is seriously the ramen capitol of America. Unfortunately Totto Ramen falls a bit short. I stopped by after work just right after they opened on Friday. This little shop is built in the basement of row of restaurants near Hells Kitchen which gives it some charm. It's kind of a hike though for ramen. They could have chosen a better location. I guess it will be good for people live in the wasteland of mediocre overpriced food known as Hell's Kitchen/Upper West Side. The space is tight. There's only room for about 12 people at a time. So the best time to get there is right after they open. The place fills up pretty quickly. Totto Ramen specializes in chicken broth based ramen. They apparently don't use MSG in their broth. I ordered the Spicy Totto Ramen. The broth I have to say was ok. It kind of reminded me of Korean Ramyun instant ramen soup without the MSG. The noodles were chewy and reminded me of the ramen they use over at Sapporo. I was disappointed they didn't give me any toppings besides some scallons and the dinky pork slices they blow torch in front of you. They could have at least given me an egg with my ramen. There was actually a bowl of boiled eggs marinating in soy sauce teasing me on the shelf. I was like hey who gets those? Apparently not me. The ramen wasn't filling at all. I could have eaten two or three bowls easily. The Japanese guys that work here are super friendly but they didn't seem very experienced at making ramen. I noticed them fumbling while preparing my ramen. They got a lot to do here to make this ramen shop successful. Firstly they need to offer bigger bowls with more ramen and more toppings besides scallion and dinky pork slices (give me some of those egss you have marinating on the shelf behind you). Speaking of pork slices, they need to be bigger and meatier. Especially for the price I'm paying here. While not bad for ramen. Give me bigger portions for what I am paying. Totto Ramen reminds me a lot of how Setagaya (wasn't a big fan) was but with better broth. Look what happened to them... What a great time to be living in NYC. The ramen wars are heating up. Can your shop survive? Listen to your customers and we'll keep coming back for more.

One of my favorite ramen spots outside Japan. First time back in a while but nothing has changed. The Ramen's still delicious and the place is still very busy.

Great ramen should have three amazing parts: soup, noodle, toppings. The Totto Chicken Paitan Ramen might be the best in the city. ?Delicious soup, perfect noodles with a little chew, and amazing chashu pork! The Unidon (sea-urchin rice bowl) was also amazing...smoky and delicious. ?For you uni fans, this is a MUST order. Totto tips: - if you're hungry, save the broth for a kaedama (noodle refill) - go with a friend, groups of 4 will wait longer

Hoshiiii desu yooo!! Totto ramen doesn't have a very diverse menu.. a few bowls of ramen.. toppings.. and some appz. ?Most of which is just another excuse for you to order more of their delicious char siu. ? For appz we tried the following: Bamboo shoots w/ spicy mayo- ?nothing special but good texture.. light flavor with a crunch. Seasoned avocados- this is another vegetarian option.. the avocados were too ripe and salty. ?pass. Char Siu with bean sprouts- ?here's where the fun began.. ?fatty fatty fatty char siu.. so much that the bean sprouts actually absorb some of that pork oil adding to the flavor. ? yum. Char Siu with mayo, scallion don- fatty fatty fatty char siu with some scallion and mayo on top of some rice. ?again... the rice absorbs the pork oil and adds to the flavor. ?great dish... kind of reminds me of the chinese preserved meats on rice (but not AS greasy). Spicy ramen and Extremely spicy ramen. ?The difference? ?Don't believe the 18 chili pepper difference that you see on the menu. ?If you like spicy its really not that bad. ?The hot sauce that they use is actually very tasty. ?It's a dried shrimp and bean paste flavored sauce. ?In the spicy ramen they put about 2 spoon fulls.. in the extremely spicy they give you a separate ketchup sized dish of the sauce on the side. ?Go with the extremely spicy ramen as you can add to your taste. The ramen is GOOD. ?I prefer egg noodles over the white noodles and the noodles were "bouncy". ?The chicken broth was tasty but the mixed in spicy sauce was a little overbearing towards the end. Don't finish the soup! ?order the $2 extra char siu topping in the beginning and order the $2.50 kaedama (extra noodles) after you finish for a very inexpensive 2nd bowl of ramen! Best bowl of ramen in Manhattan. ?Tops Ippudo IMO

I came here during the first two weeks that it was open and I wasn't ?impressed. ?The chicken broth seemed bland and the slices of pork were unremarkable. ?However, I was in the area (ok, I work in this part of town so I'm ALWAYS in the area), so I decided to give this place another chance. Glad I did. ?The menu has expanded to include appetizers. ?We started with the blowtorch seared pork. ?It was delicious - tender and fatty and well, just awesome. ?I then moved on to their regular chicken ramen whilst my friend had the spicy one. ?It's funny that they offer 2 versions of spicy ramen on the menu - one listed with 2 chili peppers next to the name, and one with 10 peppers. ?Maybe they should find some happy medium. ?Regardless, my friend was very happy with her 2 chili pepper ramen as the spicy oil gave the broth a nice kick. Shoyu ramen at Ippudo remains my all-time favorite and first ramen love, but Totto Ramen is a good alternative when: 1. You're in Midtown West. 2. You're ok with a 20 minute wait, but balk at a 1 hour (!!!minimum!!!) wait. 3. You feel like saving a few dollars. I'll be back!

From reading the reviews, I decided to see if I could beat the lunch rush and get there at 1:45pm on a Thursday. There was still a good 30-35 minute wait. Be sure that if you have others with you that your entire party is there, they will not seat you unless your entire party is there. The place is really small - consists of a bar and about 4-5 tables that fit about 2-4 people at each table. I finally got seated at the bar. The menu is very limited but easy to order from. I ordered the Totto Pork Paitan Ramen ($9.50) which a suggestion from the waiter to add a boiled egg (which surprised me because other ramen places I've been include half a boiled egg). I realized that the egg was an additional $1.00. Not breaking my bank but caught me off guard that additional toppings (more seaweed, egg, extra meat, etc ranged from $1.00-$3.00). Overall, the broth is yummy, not too salty and not to bland. It's more of a cream (miso looking but not tasting broth). Most ramen places I've been to the broth is clear/translucent. Nonetheless, the noodles were good and the grilled pork slices are very tasty. The staff was really friendly and it reminds me of an authentic Japanese ramen house in Japan (yes, I've lived in Japan for 7 years). Small area, big boiling pots of broth, Japanese chefs, and very courteous staff. They don't get a 5-star because of their extremely long wait but it is worth it. BTW, this place is a CASH ONLY. So be sure to bring the green.

I've tried ippudo, and I must say I'm in totto team too. I ate here 4 times, last time is last Saturday night, we waited for one hour and forty minutes. It's a lot of time for ramen but I say it was worth it. I think lunch time would be better if you hate too wait that long. We came here by the time they open, there's already line there, we had to wait about 30 minutes or until "the first round" is finish. I ?always order spicy totto ramen, yumm... The noodle, broth, and char siu is perfect (just thinking about it makes me hungry ?) I've tried their miso ramen too, but it's too salty for me, spicy totto ramen is the winner for me, gonna try the extra spicy one next time!! The place is so small I wish they make it bigger, or open another location, so their customer don't have too suffer to enjoy their yummy noodle.

I assumed that since I was the only non-Japanese person sitting at the bar at 6pm, this place would be amazing. When I took my seat, I was greeted by the two guys behind the counter with an unanticipated degree of enthusiasm. It was like Two Guys Catering, but instead of Vinny and Jon, it was two bearded Japanese guys with black towels wrapped around their head, one humming in Japanese to the inexplicable reggae music on the soundsystem, the other strumming the ramen like an air guitar before dumping the noodles into the boiling water. OK, this place would be amazing. I saw reggae ramen guy stage the ingredients for the soup: Chicken stock? Check. Ramen noodles? Check. Scallions? Check. Pork slices, flame blasted? Check. Chili oil? Check. Seaweed square? Check. Spice, mystery? Check. After a slurp and a bite? What a let-down. Great ramen can transcend the individual ingredients that go into it. This is not to say Totto's wasn't good, but the broth failed to bind the unctuousness of the pork with the sharpness of the scallions, and the velvety ribbons of noodles; it was like hearing a classical symphony full of musicians who were playing their parts, but not playing with each other.

I hate to put a comma to the 4 and 5 star reviews Totto Tamen has, but my experience truly calls for it. We needed a table for five. After an hour, they say we can't seat everyone together. It will be 2-3. We agreed and the two lucky ones get a seat. 15 long minutes go by. I step inside to find out when we can start our sumptuous meal. The guy with the longish curly hair told me to get out. Yes, get out of the restaurant. I see two empty tables inside and dare to put forth a request. Bad move - we get pushed on to the bar stools for those who come to eat alone. Rude behavior and dirty looks are side dishes to my spicy veggie ramen so I don't enjoy. ? ? Yes their ramen is delicious, but its New York City and its not the only delicious ramen place you will find. I'm never going back, although its a stone's throw away from my apartment.

Totto Ramen totally hits the spot for me. ?Everybody has their own specific taste for what makes the best ramen. ?If you like the following, you'll probably like Totto as much as I do: Thicker broth: Even though the broth is chicken-based, I thought it was just as creamy and thick as tonkatsu-style ramen. ?This is my fav type of broth. ?If you like this, you'll like the Paitan broth here. Miso: The Totto Miso Ramen is very flavorful. Instead of mixing the miso into the broth, they place a scoop of miso paste on top of your ramen and you can mix in as much to your heart's content. ?The paste is of the darker variety and very robust. ?If you mix it all in, you can create a very hearty and savory soup. ?I only mixed in a portion of it because I really liked the flavor of the Paitan chicken broth and didn't want the miso to completely overpower it. ?You can create the perfect balance for your own palate. Wavy Noodles: The Totto Miso Ramen comes with yellow noodles that are slighty wavy and perfectly chewy. ?I prefer this type of wavy noodle to the straight ones. ?They do offer straight homemade noodles that are pretty good, but these wavy noodles are sooo great! ? Thicker slices of char siu pork: Some places are really stingy with their pork slices, but I thought Totto gave a good amount. ?Fatty, but also meaty and super tender.

Yet ANOTHER new ramen shop (in addition to Hide-Chan) that improves midtown's choices! ?Woo-hoo! I came here for dinner once and there was a pretty ridiculous wait. ?Oh, and the store didn't have A/C. ?Yes, this was during the heat wave. Ahh well. ?We finally sat (our group of 8 had to be divided since this place is TINY) and I ordered the miso ramen. ?It was not what I'm used to since the broth is extremely chicken-y. ?I don't think they even use pork bones in the stock. ?It was still rich and tasty, but lighter than usual, and not quite to my preference of tonkatsu broth. And the noodles are EXTREMELY al dente. ?I mean I prefer that to limp thin noodles (a la Ippudo), but they were so chewy here that it gave my TMJ problems. ?The hot broth cooked it while I was eating so it was better by the end, but when I ordered kai-dama, the broth was lukewarm, so nomming through the undercooked noodles was a less than pleasant experience. BUT the pork is amazing. ?It's not that fatty, but still extremely tender, and each piece is finished off with the loving kiss of a blow torch. ?Ah-may-zing.

As I immediately sat along the Ramen Bar watching full action, I went with the basic Totto Chicken Paitan Ramen($9.25). ?In the back of my mind, there was no way Chicken Broth can beat my fave Tonkotsu within the Ramen realm. ?At least so I thought... As the Cook presented the bowl of Ramen in front of me, I was dazed in amazement as if I was strike by GOLD. ?It shined and lit my face up as Gold tends to do, at least in the movies. ? Exaggeration aside, it was the Chicken Broth aromatic intensity that hit me first like no other Broth has been able to do for me. ?If my memory serves, this is the first Ramen Broth I'm able to CHUG emptying the bowl without any sodium repercussions.. ?Definitely opened up my eyes to what can still be out there somewhere least expected. Straight Ramen I'm usually opposed to and in this case I was still slightly disappointed to a certain degree but it still provided passable chew and slurpability. ?The Charsui Pork was more the likes of Pork Belly in both consistency and fattiness. It's got to be the best Chicken Soup I've had for awhile.

As Ippudo has set the standard of Ramen in this city, I suppose it's only fair that I compare Totto's ramen with Ippudo's. I have tried both the super spicy and spicy ramen here and the problem with the super spicy ramen is that it completely drowns out all the subtle flavors of the broth. The spicy ramen however does let you taste all the different flavors and even though it's a very good broth, I would still rank Ippudo's broth higher. Where Totto does rank higher in my books is the noodle and the pork. ?The noodle is more chewy and the charsiu pork is blowtorched which gives it the perfect texture and sweetness. So Totto loses out to Ippudo in terms of broth but ?wins in almost every other aspect including wait time and price. It's a tough call since the broth is such an important part of the ramen experience. I am going with 4 stars for both.

Since the Serious Eats review, expect to wait up to an hour for a seat at Totto Ramen. The restaurant is small, with less than a dozen bar stools and a few tables in the back. Unfortunately, coming solo won't guarantee that you'll get seated first. It's first come, first serve, and the staff will usually wait for an entire section to clear so that they can seat that 5-person party that came two minutes before you. Still, true to its character, turnover is really quick and the spare menu ensures that people will immediately know what to order. A fast as your steaming bowl of ramen is prepared, you will devour it in minutes. Most diners are in and out within 20 minutes so the wait passes by pretty quickly. Still- it's worth it. There are five or six types of ramen, including two spicy ones and two vegetarian ones. I ordered the highly acclaimed chicken paitan, which comes with the most perfect al dente noodles you can imagine. Despite the fact that its a chicken stock (and your only options are a chicken or a vegetable stock), the broth is every bit as rich and flavorful and as sweet and fatty as you can hope. Each bowl comes with two slices of char siu, which, if you sit at the bar, you can watch the chefs broil using a mini flame torch. These slices are thin and extra fatty and will literally melt in your mouth. Perfection in broth, noodles, and quality of toppings! If its your second time here, be sure to try the miso ramen. This miso ramen is unlike any I've ever had before. I'm usually accustomed to my miso being lighter than the tonkotsu base, but this miso is heavy, heavy, heavy, and every bite delicious. The noodles are wavier and- surprisingly- more firm and chewy than the chicken paitan noodles. I love that it comes with half of a seasoned boiled egg, char siu, and a scoop of ground pork. ?The broth is also more acidic, with a bit of a bite. Still, its strangely addictive and the flavor never gets repetitive. You will be tempted (like we were) to call out "kaedama!" and get another ball of perfectly cooked noodles to throw in whatever left over broth you have. Generous portions, terrific servers, and five-star food in the most casual, no-frills environment. The prices are also really really reasonable, arguably even cheap in this ramen-fad city (the chicken paitan is reasonably under $10-- ramen should not cost you $15!). Yes, I think it is WAY better than Ippudo (which I never thought was worth the wait). And yes, it is LIGHTYEARS better than Momofuku (which has pretty weak broth and noodles, that even the off-the-hook toppings can't compensate for). Come for dinner or even a weekday lunch and you won't be disappointed. Hit up Ippudo if you want to seat a large group, since you shouldn't even think about bringing a party of more than four or five here. Honestly, this is the bowl of ramen I have been waiting for my entire life!

I've been here twice so far. My first time - 4 stars. My recent outing - dropped it down to 3. Now before I go any further, i would like to note that the ramen technicians are absolutely awesome. Not only do they make great noodles, they make great conversation as well! As others have said before, the broth is great, the noodles have a nice chew..but its def not an ippudo. I do like this place, however the last time I was here, something gave me and a gf a bad stomach ache for about 2 days. Not sure if it was the ramen or the avo tuna app. Regardless, if you have an hour & half to kill for some decent ramen with a hint of danger...then go for it!

After having read Serious Eat's breakdown of the top ramen shops in NYC (Totto Ramen, Hide Chan and Ippudo were ranked as the best of the best), we figured we absolutely needed to check this place out. It's about a 5 minute walk from our temporary place, so couldn't have been easier to get there. ?When we arrived, we noticed about 5 or 6 people ahead of us. ?We put our names on the list and waited. ?One by one, people were called up. ?"We''re next, we're next!" I shrieked (to myself). ? When it was finally our turn, we were escorted to the end of the bar (right in front of the big fryer for all of the up to the minute action). ?"Two chicken paitan ramen, please". ? We waited in anticipation as we watched the chef prepare the pork belly, stir the large vat of chicken broth and assemble other people's orders. ? After a few minutes, our bowls of delicious noodles & chicken broth with 3 slabs of delicious pork floating in it arrived. ?I, needless to say, inhaled it. ?So so good. ?Perfectly seasoned to my liking - in fact I prefer it to that at Ippudo. ?Hubby and I still argue about which is the best we've had. ?But then again we haven't been to Hide Chan yet. :) We were in and out in under 20 minutes. ?Perfecto.

Don't be intimidated by the longg line. It's only "visually" long. Wasn't much of a wait which made it a plus. I've tried many ramen places but this has to be the best one of them all. Prices however were yay too high for a freakin bowl of noodles. Noodles were suppose to be a poor mans food, since when did it turn gourmet?! I give it 4 stars for being the best ramen ever. The 5th star is missing because the space is wayyy too small (which probably makes it more desirable and unique) and prices could go down a few bucks. Like please, you barely pay rent.

A date recommended we go here for dinner and my oh my what an awesome way to introduce me to the world of delicious ramen. ?You see, coming from a Cantonese background a friend of mine pointed out that us Cantonese folk has always focused on the noodle itself when we're talking about noodle soup, ie how chewy egg noodles are in a wonton noodle soup. ?We're not really programmed to actually drink the soup as our ancestors merely added sodium and msg. Japanese ramen, Vietnamese and Korean soup noodles however do in fact pays a closer mind to soup base and Totto Ramen sure made a fan out of me. ?It's thick but not too thick, salty but not like in your face salty but salt from the marinated roast pork, and rich but not too rich. ?FInished half a bowl of the soup and definitely wanting me to try out more ramen - the way it's meant to be had.

It's true, the wait is grueling - arrived at 8.30pm and waited more than an hour. ?Service is really good - I appreciate that they don't get stressed out even though it's busy. ?Take the bar seat, it's more fun and you can take pics with the chefs and the food before and after it's made. ?I ordered the spicy ramen - you can have them put the spice aside so you can control that. ?Char siu is fatty and good, we ordered extra five pieces. ?Seasoned egg (extra for spicy noodle) is not as good as Momofuku's. ?Of course, you should visit your doctor shortly after this to check your cholesterol level.

One hour wait for a party of 4 on a Saturday night (7pm-ish). Worth it? Maaaaaybe. Totto and Ippudo are definitely the 2 best ramen joints in NYC. So. I'd go back on a less busy weekday for more delicious Totto ramen. Get the egg (only +$1) and extra pork (which is flamethrower charred right before it is placed into your ramen).

Best Ramen in NYC, have been here for 3 times since I discover this place. ?The place is tiny and it can barely fit 20 ppls, and almost have to wait every time for 30 minutes plus. But the wait is worth it, I always get their Totto Extreme Spicy Ramen, the ramen noodles isn't chalky, it is very tender and fresh. And the BROTH, it is very full of favors. ?Unlike other noodles house, their broth isn't too salty at all. ?The noodles serve with 2 slices of roast pork, and right before they serve it, they torch it, which release the fat out and enhance the favorite. ?The best part is the Spicy hot oil. ?This isn't a common spicy hot oil, it have a burnt, sesame aroma and it doesn't burn your tongue, but bring in lot of heat. ?It is definitively worth trying as least once. You can always ask to have the hot oil on the side.

So, here is my take on the age-old Totto versus Ippudo showdown. I came here with a friend for an early dinner at 5:30 as an attempt to beat the crowd. Just kidding, there was a line already. We put our names down on the little clipboard on the door and waited patiently. After about 20 minutes, we were seated. There are about room for 10, maybe 11 at the bar. The chefs are literally inches away in front of the seats, fire-torching hunks of meat and vigorously shaking bundles of ramen. Feeling adventurous, I ordered the super spicy ramen. (Yes, the one with TEN chili peppers next to it on the menu!) The result? Disappointing. While I didn't expect the fire-red-burn-off-your-tounge spiciness of Shin ramen, my bowl spicy ramen merely came with a small side dish of peppery chili oil. The ten chili peppers definitely build up my expectations too high to be satisfied by some barely spicy oil. The noodles themselves were very al-dente, yet lacking the soft chewy texture I usually expect in ramen. The broth was rich, however, not too salty. Overall, personally, I would say that I prefer Ippudo. But for the price, around 12 bucks, Totto really isn't a bad choice either.

I am definitely a fatty pork broth kind of gal. I really didn't expect to not like Totto as much as I did. ?The chicken broth was very bland and the chasu pork pieces were lean. ?The noodles were very thick with an over abundance of flour as if it didn't cook off in the water. ?Wow, Totto... you do not deserve the praise to be compared to Ippudo! ? S and I made a mad dash here from work at 5:30pm, arriving a little before 6:00pm. ?Upon entering the 15 seat restaurant with a few patrons the hostess came by the front to confirm if I was a table of 2. ?I nodded. ?She then asked me to put my name on the cardboard list outside of the restaurant. ?I did. ?Then I tried to wait inside where the warmth of the broth oozed and then she quickly booted me to "wait outside, you can't wait inside". ?Weird seating rules, ok, WTF? ?I abide. ?I'll do anything for a highly anticipated bowl of premium ramen. My end result and verdict? ?Ippudo still reigns supreme.

Doors opened at five for dinner, but my friends and I were there at four thirty. We were the second group in line. Because of that, the wait wasn't very long. Totto Ramen is tiny, with just a few tables and a bar, but the service is very efficient. I thought I ate fast, but another couple left before we did. Because we were early though, I wasn't exactly very hungry and so I shared a side don dish and a ramen with a friend. The side dish we got was the Char Siu Mayo Don, and it was delicious. The pork was cooked and flavored well, and I loved the yuzu mayo sauce. The rice was moist and cooked in some special broth that gave it a faint flavor, though I couldn't exactly pinpoint it, but I enjoyed it more than regular white rice. The ramen I shared was the Totto Chicken Paitan Ramen, and we added the kikurage mushroom topping. This is one of the better ramens I have had in New York. The broth was properly salty but not heavy/oily, and the noodles were cooked to perfection - just right without being too chewy or hard. I would come back even though I hate waiting. Totto Ramen beats Ippudo.

Thank God the ramen here wasn't as greasy. But it also wasn't the best ramen I've had. We came here at 6:00pm on a random weekday and only had to wait 15 min. (so come early!) We ordered Totto Spicy Ramen, Totto Miso Ramen, Broiled Char Siu Pork, and a Tuna and avocado appetizer dish from the special menu. I also ordered Spicy Bamboo Shoot on the side for my ramen. Totto Spicy Ramen's broth wasn't as greasy as Ippudo's and Minca's, which I appreciated. I like to sip on the broth, and the lighter the broth, the better. However, the texture of the noodles weren't as tasty as I would've liked. It's too thin and rubbery? Can't really explain it. As for Miso Ramen, I thought the broth wasn't as flavorful as the spicy ramen. I also didn't like how they scooped the miso as if it's an ice cream and threw it in the soup. Just a personal preference. I like my miso broth to come well mixed. I took a bite of Spicy Bamboo Shoot thinking that I could handle it bc I love spicy anything- and it was INTENSE. I think I was suppose to mix it with the broth first to spice up the broth. A well, a couple sips of cold beer fixed it. The appetizers were also delicious. Broiled Char Siu Pork tastes just like Korean Sam Gyup Sal, but marinated with a different house sauce. Very tender and meaty. But added with the ramen pork meat, I felt like it was meat overload. Tuna and avocado appetizer dish were also amazing. The house sauce here is really delicious. I defintely recommend this dish! Overall, not the best I've had but good enough in the U.S.

I LOVE THIS PLACE so much that I came here two days in a row even after I spent the first day waiting outside in the cold winter night for 2.5 hours. It operates on a first come first serve basis and you sign your name in on a clipboard at the door to wait for one of 20 seats inside the place. There are two 4 person tables, one 2 person table and noodle bar seating. I'm actually surprised at how they can fit so many people in this hole in the wall since there are like 10 workers there too! With that said, there's really no space for you to put your things so don't come packing, the wire rail above your heads can only hold so much. The music in this spot depending on where you sit is the sound of noodles being made or Japanese pop/rock coming from the waiter with the afro's ipod. It really reminds me of an authentic spot in Japan that got uprooted and placed in midtown. Now for the best part, the food. The ramen is made al dente and the key to a great ramen soup is the broth. For people who can't take spicy foods like me, I highly recommend the basic chicken ramen broth, which is incredibly flavorful. And even better when complemented by the mushroom and char siu toppings. This and the rice ball had me more than well satisfied and the incredible thing is that it was so CHEAP! I spent less than $20 including tip and tax for an incredible dinner in Manhattan. The next day I wisely came before the dinner rush at 5pm with another friend and ordered a uni (sea urchin) rice bowl along with the other non-spicy ramen bowl choice. There are enough non-ramen options here too for people who didn't want noodles and they're also just as delicious. The uni-don is a MUST for anyone who likes sea urchin or wants to try sea urchin for the first time. It has a smooth flavor that's not too strong and fishy and amazing when mixed together with the rice and cucumber slices in the pot. I didn't realize that's how I was supposed to eat this until a waiter kindly advised me to mix it all together after seeing me pick each piece of the uni off by itself. And the amazing part is it only cost $5.50 for the bowl! I would definitely come back again and say it's the ramen house in NYC!

Went to Totto Ramen today around 5:30pm and it already had a 30 minute wait. ?The place is tiny so I can see why this place always has a line. ?Totto is so small that they don't seat any parties larger than 4 and they only have a handful of tables. I ordered the spicy ramen and the broth was really clean and flavorful tasting. ?The ramen was good but not anything that I thought was any better than Ippudo. ?For me the broth was definitely better than Ippudo and for $11 bucks alot cheaper than other ramen places. I would give this place 4 stars if it wasn't for my long wait. ?As a single diner, I waited 45 minutes for a seat at the bar. ?The host sat larger parties ahead of me even though I was next on the list. ?2 spots opened at the bar and instead of seating me, he seated the couple after me! ?WTH! ?I was next on the list yet he preceded to seat 2 parties after me which I thought was ridiculous! ?He gave me a lame excuse as to why I was not seated. ?Apparently, I had to wait for the single diner at the bar to finish before I could be seated. ?Are you serious??!! ?I was not happy. ?Hence the low rating.

Is Totto Ramen worth my 45 minutes wait under the shelter during the rain? I have to say YES! Would I be crazy enough to do that again? I have to say NO! But I am glad that I able to try one of Totto Ramen which are of Chicken Broth based... the taste and the smell of the chicken was so intense and rich! And it is NOT oily at all!! I did order the Extreme Spicy Ramen... but it was only the regular version with spicy sauce on the side. The spicy sauce is not intensely hot but more like a garlic hotness. Even as a spicy lover like myself, I will suggest just skip that and have the broth the way it suppose to be! The Ramen noodle itself was not bad, cooked al dente and it has good texture even when you slurping it at the end. But the star of the Ramen for Totto is not really the noodle itself anyway! For the side we ordered a Tuna Avo ($4.50), not bad but I will skip that the next time! Oh if there is a next time?! Who is going to wait with me for another hour for a bowl of Ramen?? The wait should have been faster if the staffs more organized. I felt like just ripping that broad from his hand and start calling the customers and seating them myself! (breathe! I am on holiday! I have to chill! And don't scare that nice Japanese boy!)

Hearing about the long wait, I stayed away from this place. ?Finally decided to give it a try, and I'm definitely glad that I did. ?It is definitely way better than Ippudo. ?Unfortunately, on Sundays, they don't open until 4. ?When we showed up at 4:30, there was already a long line of people in line. ?We waited a little over an hour. ?The place is very small, and can fit about 20 people. ?After waiting for so long, I was glad to find out that the food comes out very quickly. ?Started out with the uni don. ?It was average. ?We also had the pork buns.

So this one time, Brian M. and I got up at 5 AM in the morning, stood in the line for Jimmy Fallon tickets, in the flipping cold (15 degrees), made friends with an Australian man, watched crazy women (dressed up in pajamas) arrive for the Dr. Oz show, got stand-by tickets #1 and #2, got extremely excited for about 4 hours, then proceeded to get our hopes and dreams dashed as we were told that they were not accepting any stand-by tickets for that day's taping. True story. Can I just point out that neither B or I are tourists?! I don't know what came over me when I made this suggestion. Anyway, this day could also be known as one of the most miserable days of my life. Orrrrrrr...it could be known as the day I discovered Totto Ramen. Or what I like to think of as healthier, I'm on a diet, ramen! I got the Totto Miso Ramen with a side of Rayu (spicy sesame oil). I do admit, I am an Ippudoist. I live and die by Ippudo's ramen standards. It was hard for me to even consider ramen in a chicken-based broth. However, the lighter broth was incredibly refreshing, and made me a fan. I'm almost never in midtown, but if I am and I need a ramen fix, I know where to go!

This place is definitely a cute hole-in-the-wall. The space is very small, so the wait is a bit of a pain.

Very good ramen, like the different, lighter flavor the chicken stock adds. The miso ramen is subtle and seductive, the noodles nicely "al dente" (what is the Japanese term for this?) I wouldn't wait an hour for this stuff, though; luckily we found a way to get seated relatively quickly. I can't say it's "better" than Ippudo or Minca or even Rai Rai Ken... I feel like each place does its own riff on ramen, and I appreciate them all. The spicy tuna don and squid yaki apps were both awesome.

It's small inside so you better get there early (before 5:30 or so) or else you're likely in for a wait. I've been there twice and twice I sat at the bar, which is actually the kitchen! ?I love being right there while the cooks are at work. ?On both visits I sat directly in front of the noodle cook's station. ?I didn't get his name yet but he's fantastic. ?A few times he noticed my girlfriend and I looking curiously at something he was preparing, he seemed to know our questions without us asking and he took a moment to explain the dish he was preparing. Update: The first few times I had the Spicy Ramen and I really liked it. ?I had the Miso Ramen a few days ago and WOW! ?This is what's up! ?New favorite ramen for sure!

Maybe it was all the reviews I read here, saying that this place had exceeded people's expectations, unlike Ippudo. I, however, still like Ippudo better. My boyfriend and I waited in line (something I wasn't surprised for). It was our first time here, so we were not familiar with the menu, but the host wanted us to order as soon as we sat down and when I told him we needed a couple of minutes, he gave me a weird look! The water tasted weird and it had a piece of straw paper floating in it! My bf and I liked at the menu, and the first thing we noticed was that "kimchi" was spelled "kimuchi." Kimchi is a Korean side dish, not Japanese, so please do not try to Japanise the word! I got the Spicy Ramen and my boyfriend got the Meat Lover/Niku Ramen. I hated my ramen because I have no clue why, but it was bathed in pepper! I almost choked on my first bite! Don't get me wrong, it was NOT the spiciness, that thing was pure pepper! The Niku Ramen was really big and tasty! Too big for me to eat by myself, though. I also hated the fact that it was so damn hot in there. There was only one AC, which technically should suffice on a small store like this one, but with all the people in there, it clearly didn't! I should also say that our water did not get refilled AT ALL. My boyfriend literally got up, and took the cup to the waiter and waitress that were just standing there! I will go back again once more to give this place a second chance, maybe on a less hot day.

I have been here three times already, and boy am i hooked! I can't have pork based ramen so i've always had to make do with the vegetarian ramens around the city, and none of them have tasted remotely appetizing. The first two times i had the spicy ramen with boiled egg as my topping and i was blown away. The noodles are perfectly al dente and have a wonderful texture. The broth is super flavorful and the portions are extremely generous. This time when I went, i decided to suck it up and try the extreme spicy ramen topped with seasoned avocado and boiled egg. In my opinion this is the BEST combination at totto. The extreme spicy is surprisingly bearable. The spicy sauce isn't very spicy, it gives the ramen a nice smokey taste. I seriously can't wait to get back here. The staff is so cheerful and attentive despite the crowds. And here's a nice tip, try going around lunchtime when the crowd isn't so big. And if you insist on going at dinner time put your name down and go next door to lucky burger for some cheese fries and a sprite. It's the best way to kill some time.

Yes there's a long wait, but it's totally worth it...otherwise people wouldn't be waiting! When our name was called I couldn't help but do a fist pump and say, "YES!" I felt like I won the lotto or something. I thought nothing would be like Ippudo and it really isn't like Ippudo. Ippudo Modern ramen is amazing but the duck one I had there was just so so. ? I love Totto because it seems all the ramens are equally special...like your seven children or something. I had the miso ramen with the seasoned avocado. ?it was pretty perfect. ?Three guys next to us ordered the meat lovers ramen which had like twelve kinds of pork in it. ?They slurped down that ramen like their lives depended on it. ?Quietly and they didn't make any conversation with one another. My friend ordered it and we watched them torch...oh yes TORCH. some pork belly for the ramen. ?YUM. And I loved loved the staff! ?The were so fun!

Delicious, heavy, be prepared to wait. We got here around 10:30 on a week night and still waited about 45 minutes. ?Started with the tuna avocado salad, which had a nice combination of flavors and textures and was overall really good. ?I got the Miso Ramen with pork. ?THIS BROTH IS HEAVY. ?It was really good at first, but then it became almost overpoweringly flavorful. ?I didn't come close to finishing it and they do not have any take away containers. ?The texture of the noodles and the hard-boiled egg are absolutely perfect. The broth is rather thick and glistening with taste (fat). ?I'm salivating now just thinking about how tasty is was, but it's way too flavorful and heavy to have all the time.

I paid another visit to Totto Ramen and was glad to see the place now has a functioning A/C unit and proper ventilation. I chose Totto Ramen for a carbo loading session. First course: For starters, I ordered the Paitan Ramen (their house specialty chicken + soy sauce broth ramen). ?I'm usually not a huge fan of chicken broth ramen and usually do not like shoyu ramen, but the Paitan ramen here is very nice and creamy! ?I wish they included an egg though. ?Their blow torch seared Charsiu is hands down the best in the city. Second course: Upon a friend's suggestion, I tried the Pork Chasiu with Spicy Yuzu Mayonnaise and Scallions. ?Oh man, this was good. Totto Ramen is levels beyond better than Hide-Chan (even though they're under the Totto umbrella) and Ippudo. ?It's now one of my favorite restaurants in the city. Great news: Totto Ramen now serves lunch! FYI, it's cash only.

CASH ONLY! Friday night, around 5-6 PM, 50-60 degrees, and there I saw a mini line outside Totto Ramen. Luckily, I only waited 15 minutes. This spot is not for claustrophia people because this place is cramped and they use all the available space they can. I don't think you can fit more than 15 people in here. There are a few tiny tables (and I mean tiny) in the back, we were seated at the counter facing the kitchen and saw the magic of ramen preparation happened before our eyes. The ramen are priced on average around $10 (if you're paying more than $10 for ramen then something is wrong *cough* *cough* Ippudo), extra toppings are $0.75 to $2.00, and sides are no higher than $4.50. The ramen... one word, three syllables, DE-LI-CIOUS. We had: 1. Totto Chicken Paitan Ramen - Big bowl of smoothing broth, thin ramen, big pieces of pork char siu, topped with scallions, onions, and a nori. 2. Totto Miso Ramen - A miso broth, bean sprouts, seasoned hard-boiled egg, and ground pork. 3. Char Siu Mayo Don - Tasty flavored Japanese rice topped with char siu pork, mayo, and scallions. 4. Spicy Bamboo Shoot - Very spicy and adds a kick when you mix it into your ramen.

We used to leave work extra early to try to get here early for lunch and make the first wave to be seated. Most of the time, we didn't make it there in time and ended up being in the second wave :( There is one chef there that's super nice when we sit at the bar and if we let him know that we're in a hurry to get back to work (after having waited for almost 45 mins to be seated), he whips up our dishes quickly and we don't have to wait until a waiter comes to take our order! Their spicy ramen is my favorite because of the straight homemade noodles! The pork belly and the broth were delish as well. I always ask to have an egg added in because a bowl of ramen is not ramen without an egg. This is seriously one of the BEST places in NY for ramen, if not THE BEST. The wait is definitely worth it. Wish I could savor the taste of their ramen in my mouth FOREVER.

This place is delicious! ?I got the spicy ramen with pork. ?For toppings, I added corn and the seasoned avocados. ?The seasoned avocados were super yummy and I would highly recommend getting that. ?It sounds weird, but they don't put it in the soup. ?They give it to you on the side so you can eat it with your ramen. ?Totto is definitely better than Ippudo. ? My friend got the extra spicy ramen which they also give you ?on the side so you can adjust the spicy-ness yourself. ? In the soup they don't give you more than 2 slices of pork so if you want more you should order extra toppings. ?Finally, we got a side order the pork belly. ?It had this great sweet sauce which went well with ramen. ? Only down side is that Totto opens at noon and in reading the previous reviews about that wait, I thought that coming here at 12:20 wouldn't be a big deal since it's a work day, but I was wrong. ?We waited for almost 1 hour before we got seated. ?The place is super tiny so it's best to come in 2s. ?They only have 2 tables which can seat parties of 4 and one table for 2. ?Other than that it's just counter space.

Totto definitely does not need any endorsements from me! ?According to some 800+ reviews, they have the BEST ramen in NYC! And, after getting there at 4:45PM on a Sunday and waiting 1 hr 15 min in the cold, and snowed on at some points INSIDE the tent, I am going to have to say that I agree with these 800+ people. ?Yay, let's be friends! A small, cynical side of me wonders if they had served me a limp noodle with salt it would have tasted good after waiting so long, but deep down inside, I know that not only was the food good, but the service was excellent. ?Nowadays, we forget to remember stuff like that, because we all dine out so much, but I still place a lot of value in the whole experience of going out and having a good time. One of the reasons I decided to wait was because of the door guy. ?While I was in the tent, I saw him calling out each group's name. ?The patrons were rude, I kid you not, but he handled everyone with respect and professionalism. ?Each time he called someone's name and they got to the front door, he always Thanked them for waiting. ?Politeness is totally underrated in NYC, and something like that, really gets on my radar. ?While in line, ( I was in line for a long time), I also saw a customer yell at him for apparently skipping his name on the list. ?The door guy handled it with such grace, apologizing but also firmly saying that he was trying his best and that oversights like that will happen, but he will try his best to fix it. ?I have been to restaurants where managers do not know how to exhibit such grace. ?Kudos, door guy. ?Because of you, I decided to wait because I knew Totto would take care of me when I finally sat down to eat. And I was right. ?It was worth the wait. ?Before they seat you, they clean the tables and prepare each seat with a menu and a glass of cold water. ?They give you a little bit of time, and then a server is right there to take your order. ?Drinks were served promptly, and then while we waited, since we sat at the bar, we got to see the action first hand. ?Ramen on the far left, then a counter where the ramen bowls are prepared, and then 2 huge vats of their special chicken and soy sauce based broth. ?It's pretty cool to see the whole process. ? From then on the experience and food was amazing. ?The two cooks would occasionally check on us and our food came out immediately and piping hot. ?We tried the Niku Ramen and the Totto Spicy Ramen. ?Order the Niku if you are hungry and want a lot of meat, order the Totto Spicy if you want to give your chicken broth a little kick of heat. ?The noodles were done to al dente perfection, I checked out the cook doing a swirling motion when he cooked the ramen, and I too, will try that when I cook it at home next time. (Muhahahaha, secrets!) ?I also really liked the chicken based broth, people say it's creamier, but I actually think that it is lighter tasting than traditional pork based broth. ?I felt that I could drink a lot more of Totto's broth than I could at other ramen places. We also ordered the broiled char siu and the avo tuna. ?Both were really delicious. ?I definitely recommend trying them both. Overall, I had a wonderful experience at Totto Ramen minus the wait and some of the assholes waiting outside with me. ?I would love to go back again, but the wait is pretty insane and maybe it's better this way if I just remember how good it was the one time I went.

4.5. ? Miike Snow concert at Terminal 5. ?Where to eat beforehand? ?I've been meaning to try Totto for ages!! ?I heard it may give Ippudo a run for it's money. ?I can see that. ?The place is much more authentic seeming, and smaller. ? Zero wait on a Thursday night around 6. ?Perfect. ? I had the extra spicy ramen. ?They put the spicy paste on the side... too many couldn't hack it or something? ?Anyway not THAT spicy! ?I poured the whole thing in and it was perfect. ?Had the seasoned avocado on the side. ?Yum. ? WIsh I ordered more sides, as I didn't realize that the ramen would be pretty toppingless. ?Broth was excellent. ?#2 to Ippudo in my opinion. ?Noodles were great. ?Again #2 to Ippudo. ?Service was fine. ?Our waiter forgot our drinks and we didn't get them until our ramen but whatever. ?The annoyance was wiped out by the ramen. Loved sitting at the bar watching the ramen action. ? Will definitely go back if in the hood again.

Out of all the ramen places I've been to in NY, I like Totto the best. (Ippudo, Momofuku noodle bar, Ken, and Totto). But, expect to wait in a LONGGGGGGG line. I got the Totto Spicy Ramen w/ boiled egg & it was absolutely AMAZING. I was expecting the ramen to be pretty spicy, but it wasn't that spicy (still good tho). The char siu pork inside the ramen was super juicy! Because I waited for so long before I got seated, when I first got my bowl, I was pretty disappointed at how small the bowl looked....but, don't let it fool you! It will fill you up! :) It's pretty small inside, but it has air condition, so no worries! :) The workers are super friendly which is always a nice little plus! ;p

This place opened up down the block from me a few months ago and I immediately noticed the constant line outside this tiny little gem. I had to find out what the hype was about. Be prepared to wait an hour+ during normal meal times. The menu is simple and small and the place only seats about 15 people. Also this is CASH ONLY and does not take reservations. They service is fast and its a get in - get out once you are seated. Though I didn't find they pushed you to leave once you were done, which was nice. You would think $10 for a bowl of Ramen is not worth it, but I found the proportions extremely large, the noodles plump and the toppings to be savory and moist. Feel free to take the rest TO GO if you do not finish it all, which I did not. I had the traditional Totto Chicken Paitan Ramen with the Shredded Pork topping and a side of the Cheese Corn. The Ramen was excellent as was the Cheese Corn, but I was surprised to find this corn served cold! I think I would of preferred it warm but it was still good none the less. I say if you seen no one waiting outside this place, GO IN! But if you are in a hurry, skip it. But worth trying at least once.

I'm sorry but I wasn't a fan. Totto Ramen tries to be healthy with their ramen - i.e. chicken broth, all organic, no msg, etc, but its to a point where the decrease in yum factor does not offset the minimal increase in health factor. The wait is also too long, so i wouldn't call it convenient either. Right now they have people waiting outside on the steps since the place is so small, but what happens when winter comes around? The staff is very friendly, though a little on the inexperienced side. but if you are nice, i'll give you the benefit of the doubt. However, the food, I doubt will bring me back.

I believe there is a ramen war going on in NYC, as with the pizza wars, the ramen wars are heating up. As of late these small, unimposing, and severely delicious restaurants seem to be popping up everywhere. You have your upscale - Momofuku & Ippudo and then your more traditional ones Hide Chan & Totto Ramen. The question is ... who makes the best? As always, I believe those answers are mostly subjective. What you do get from Totto Ramen is an incredible bowl of almost perfectly made ramen with fresh noodles, succulent pork, a spicy kick and the atmosphere of a real "Salary Man's" ramen joint in Japan. It's most likely that you WILL wait up to an hour to get a seat here at Totto Ramen and believe me, it's absolutely worth it. Cramming 10-20 people in a basement, bench style restaurant is how most of these restaurants function in places like Tokyo & Osaka. Stepping foot into this establishment brought me back to my trip to Japan over a year ago and that cozy, intimate and (let's be honest) drunk as a skunk experience... and I loved every moment. The waitress was sweet, the host was kind, the cooks looked like they genuinely loved what they were doing and everything was cooked and displayed out in front of us within minutes, nay... seconds. Their prices are excellent, the service swift and the drinks abundant. Our group chowed down on the regular Totto Spicy Ramen and the "Rice Sandwich" which is a staple in most Asian countries. Everything was superb, I left feeling full and fulfilled. The ingredients were fresh and the soup was hearty. I would've preferred a little less salt, but let's face it.. it's ramen.. it's going to be salty. Besides, that's what my Sapporo and bottle of Soju was for!!! So hunker down, put yourself on the list and cram yourself into this establishment before all the tourists get wind of it. It's definitely worth the spice-induced coma you will most likely have walking out of it.

Im a huge fan of the Totto family of restaurants. ?Loved the ramen. For me the only thing that disappointed from food perspective was that they hadnt started serving the buns yet. I had the spicy ramen and loved it. Go early though. We got there at 5:05 and already had to wait. There was one couple in front of us and they waited for 5 min and bailed. We waited for about 20 min. When we left , the line was about 15 people deep. Im a big fan of Totto Ramen. I like it better than ippudo....though I wish this place had more seats to accomodate the demand!

I think compared with Ippudo, Totto is more traditional, and laid back. The soup in their noodle is less flavory but more natural. The service is great, although you do need to wait in a long line before getting seated.

This was definitely overrated. It was Saturday afternoon, and I got there around opening time. I still had to wait over a hour. I would have been fine with the wait if the food was superb. There was a bitter taste to the pork in my miso ramen. The avo tuna was a big failure as the soy sauce overpowered the freshness of the tuna. The spicy tuna don was by far the best dish on the table, but even then, the dish had too much black pepper.

Hot, steaming chicken broth with beautiful al dente noodles, succulent fatty pork scorched with a blowtorch before your eyes. ?It's a perfect lunch for a blustery day in midtown. The wait is a problem - a big one. ?If you go with 1 or 2 during off peak (read: 3pm-5pm or after 11) hours, you'll probably be fine. ?But otherwise, you'll be in for a long haul. ?As a matter of fact, don't go at all. ?You'd take up precious seating space. ?Why am I writing this review? The miso ramen is rich and satisfying, the spicy ramen even moreso. ?When you get the "extreme spicy ramen," they actually just give you the regular thing and bring the sauce on the side, so that might be the best option - you can spice it to your taste. ?I use all the sauce and have never really found it to be extreme, but whatever. ? Anyway, Totto stacks up nicely against Ippudo and always delivers. ?The apps aren't quite as impressive (the seared tuna is covered with an overly salty sauce, the uni is not what you would hope for, etc.) But the ramen is the star, and worth an extra visit or ten. ?Cash only. ? Ps, I always finish my ramen, but my more dainty female companions were disappointed to learn that it is never packaged up to go. ?Plan ahead.

I came here during lunch time on a Thursday. Arrived at around 12:30 and waited for 15-20 minutes. At first I was a bit worried when I arrived here seeing the bunch of people on the waiting list. I thought maybe I wouldn't make it to get in during my office lunch hour....! But, after 12:40pm, the guys inside gradually started to get out. Since this place opens at 12pm, the first round of customers tend to get out around this time. As for the ramen, I ordered the extra spicy ramen. The soup was pretty good and not too spicy. I ordered the shredded pork topping with it but I must say that the regular char siu was a lot better for me(so tender and delicious!!). Besides the ramen, side menu also looked really good and reasonable($4-6). Tuna rice bowl was especially tempting(but I skipped due to the tight schedule) The guy at the counter was really friendly and the service here is over all nice. Will i come back? yes!

yum. totto ramen is better than ippudo. the wait is long, make sure you sign the list downstairs. although there are no pork buns at totto ramen, i still love it. it isn't THE best ramen i have ever had, but it is still very good. fyi, i think the best ramen is in a little alley in seoul. but anyway, the spicy ramen with corn is tasty! add the spicy tuna don [almost as good as fukada in irvine] & avo tuna with avocado and yuzu garlic sauce- and it is a great meal~

I didn't like it. ( the first time. see below for my second visit review.) I didn't like it at all. Price, noodle, soup, taste, staff. I think this is absolutely over rated. Again, I don't like pork broth soup, so this chicken broth soup just reminded me that pork broth soup. OK, here is my second visit review. I went back and tried different ramen. This time I had a Miso Ramen. My review went up from one start to two. There was a scoop of miso on top of the regular ramen. You basically mixed up miso by yourself. Ok I can do that. Ramen noodle was different from regular chicken ramen. It was more thicker and firm and curly just as I normally expect it for ramen noodle. I like firm and wavy yellow color ramen rather than white and straight ramen they used for Regular ramen. ?Char- shu topping (port slices) were thick and very rich. I like thin port slices but many people like this thick pork cha-shu. ?Staff were well behave this time and very nice too. ?Maybe because they were very busy and they could not goof off. If you like pork broth ramen known by Hakata Ramen, you will probably love it but if you are like me, like traditional Shoyu ramen from Tokyo and Kanto area in Japan, there are a chance you may not like this place. Try it out anyway and let me know how you think.

The line is too long. The place is too small. The ramen is very good. Their main broth is a chicken broth, similar to Shōyu ramen, but heavier on chicken flavor rather than soy sauce. The Miso ramen is what I like best here. This isn't the best ramen in the city, but it's up there. _____

This place is totally out of the way and nondescript, but the food is awesome. Only downside is the long wait to go in. The Ramen was delicious. Noodles weren't too hard or too soft, and the broth was very yummy. Best part was the pork. It was flavorful and cooked perfectly. I got the spicy chili oil which added a mild kick, but i would definitely try the super spicy version next time.

I dropped in on Totto Ramen today at about 4:30 pm. It's a quaint alleyway of a restaurant that seats 20 people (most at the counter in front of the open kitchen). When I arrived one of the cooks informed me that the 'chicken broth' used in most of their dishes had run out and so I could only select from the vegetarian ramen, which limited me to two choices and also the most expensive items on the menu. I ordered the Spicy Vegetarian Ramen ($12) and had them add in an Seasoned Boiled Egg ($1). ?While I was waiting for my food, the cook told another customer that they would have more 'chicken broth' in about 30 minutes so she could wait or come back. ?I was kind of annoyed that he didn't give me that option. The Spicy Vegetarian ramen is listed as: "Our vegetarian Rayu, Spicy Sesame Oil, offers a spicy substitute to our Vegetarian Ramen - konbu and shiitake based soup with organic noodles topped with seasonal vegetables." After less than ten minutes, a bowl was placed in front of me on a charming little black stand. ?And while it was quite fragarent....well...it didn't really look like ramen. ?Ramen is a dish that has a great deal of flexiblity, but other than the noodles and the egg that I ordered all the the toppings were quite unorthodox. The vegetables included avocado, cauliflower, corn, zucchini and red and green peppers with a wedge of lime on the side. ? The only vegetable from that list that is traditionally used in ramen is corn, and even that was served in a unusual fashion ?Instead of the corn being a sprinkling of kernels, it was a strip of kernels still attached to part of the cob. ?This made it difficult to bite into get to the fleshy goodness of the kernels. ?I also had no place to discard the spent cob pieces, so I had to leave them floating in my soup and I kept ingesting them as I drank the broth. On a related note: all the vegetables were in large pieces and were difficult to wield or eat. ?However, all the vegetables were fresh and delicious. The egg was also good, but it was not cut in half, as is the norm, so it was also cumbersome. The noodles were thin and gritter than regular ramen and didn't have the elasticity that usually comes from the alkali water they're made with. ?The broth was excellent and the hot sesame oil they used added spice and flavor without drowning out the rest of the flavors. It just didn't 'feel' like ramen. It was a delicious noodle soup, and I would suggest it as an intriguing vegetarian meal, but since it lacked any elements that made up traditional ramen, it seemed a little bit off the mark.

I'm by no means a ramen expert, but this place was delicious. Get the extra spicy ramen (which still isn't that spicy, despite the excessive amount of chili peppers next to the title). $11 will you get you a generous bowl of milky broth, deliciously fatty charsiu pork and al dente noodles. We also ordered the charisu chunks - I don't know if its a Japanese thing but this was closer to hongshao (red-cooked) pork more than it was actually charsiu. The one knock on this place is the line. Seriously waited an hour to get seated in here since the place is tiny. Would recommend getting here an hour or so early to put your name on the list. In addition to a steaming bowl of noodles, you get to enjoy front row seats to watch an experienced team of ramen experts blowtorch pieces of pork and stir giant cauldrons of broth. Absurd!

Came here on my most recent trip to NYC because of all the raves i've heard about this place. We waited for 1.5 hrs in the cold and rain. I am not complaining about the wait since it is NYC and a lot of popular joints have at least up to 2 hrs wait time. I can't really say it was worth the wait for me. I mean it was good, no complaints there, but it wasn't GREAT! The portion, price, and broth were just average... nothing spectacular... Well, at least I can cross off this place on my list of must try places~

I love this place. I love it so much that I stood in line for 40 minutes the day after the blizzard with soaking wet toes to get my filling of ramen. The ramen is basically all the same except you can get it spicy or with miso. I like the spicy ramen with added bean sprouts and extra nori. Their appetizers aren't bad either but the ramen steals the show. I've been to Ippudo dozens of times, and nothing there beats Totto ramen..

Tasty little Ramen joint in Midtown. Cash only, long lines. Long lines are a problem, go super early or late. Hey management, can we do something about this? We arrived at 10- waited 15 minutes- enough time for me to trot down to my local bank and withdraw some cash. There's no sexy ambiance or chic decor here- just small tables and soup. You're not waiting for an incredibly complex dining experience, but rather quality food. Luckily, the food comes up super fast, so your rumbly tummy is quickly satisfied and your freezing cold body is quickly warmed up with a nice big bowl of soupy goodness. The vegetable ramen is delicious- but make sure you get it spicy, as I can imagine it to be rather bland without. I'm not the most experienced of Ramen eaters- but I just like good food. That being said, Totto did me well. ?I really enjoyed my added toppings- kikurage mushrooms, scallions (okay maybe a weee bit too many of these) and the ones that came along with my order- seasoned avocado (mm, mm good), tofu, veggies, and some salted Yuzu paste (I have no idea what that is). Only weird thing is that it also came topped with quite a bit of arugala, and my soup more so resembled a salad until i ate some of that green out and stirred my soup around a bit. I came close to finishing my bowl- but I had to quit when I made it through to the bottom. The good news is- I was stuffed, but not that gross "roll me home" feeling, and I may be wrong- but it felt guilt free! My boyfriend enjoyed his Miso Ramen- topped with extra Char Siu Pork, but he's a ramen virgin and kept comparing it to Pho. His miso broth was tasty, but of a much more simple, that could have ventured on the bland side... Maybe we'll venture to Ippudo soon and try and compare. I like you Totto Ramen, I'll be back... but maybe during lunch.

Be prepared to wait for at least 30 min if you decide to come right around dinner time! We had a group of 4 around 7:15pm and we waited for about an hour for a table. We even jumped into the burger place next door for some cookies (yes, cookies) partially because we were starving but mostly because we were freezing! We were seated around 8:30pm. Two of my friends ordered the Totto Miso Ramen with cheese corn. B. An and I both ordered the Totto Spicy Ramen and I got a side of spicy bamboo shoots. We decided on the tuna avo appetizer to start. The tuna avo consists of three thick pieces of seared tuna marinated in some sort of sesame ginger vinegarette on top of a bed of avocados. There's a side of finely minced garlic and some sort of salty something. This was really good. I'm definitely going to get this again the next time I come here. I used some of the garlic to eat with the tuna but I put most of it in my ramen (the more garlic the better!). I think I could have definitely handled the Totto Extreme Spicy Ramen but after waiting for an hour for a table, I somehow scared myself out of it. But ordering the spicy bamboo shoots was a good idea because once I put them in the soup, it boosted up the spicy level by 4 more chili peppers. The others really enjoyed their ramen as well but when I tried the miso ramen broth, I thought it was kind of bland. But I tend to love my soups super spicy and even garlic-y so I'm sure the miso broth is really good to others. I've been pretty skeptical about trying ramen in NYC because there are so many good places in CA where it's definitely not over $10 for a bowl of ramen (I still think it's ridiculous to pay over $10 for ramen which is why I refuse to go to Ippudo!) but I have to say, Totto Ramen was pretty good. I'll be back some other freezing night to try the Totto Extreme Spicy Ramen!!!

Let ?me first say, that I was not a big fan of Japanese ramen...until...TOTTO RAMEN CAME INTO MY LIFE! I haven't heard the greatest things about Ippudo or Momofuku, especially with their extreme price premium, it never seemed worth it for me to try them out. I just didn't understand the hype. At Totto, you're looking about about $11 a bowl, unless you customize and add extras (at about $1 a piece) I came here for my birthday dinner with a party of 3 at 9pm on a Saturday night...and probably didn't get to eat until about 10 pm. DEFINITELY not a place for large groups. There is a bar and about table room for maybe 15 people, so you're talking about a maximum capacity of about 30....and with about 30 more people waiting to eat. Now keep in mind, there's no room inside to stand and wait for a table, so you end up having to sit on the stoop out in the freezing cold (although they put up a makeshift sort of plastic thing to protect you from the wind). Trust me, it's totally worth the wait. Just huddle up with your party and/or your new friends that are also waiting for tables. So once they make sure you are properly frozen, and just dying for some nice hot broth, you finally get seated by the most ADORABLE waiters and waitresses!! Especially this super cute waitress who was rocking the Lady Gaga Hair Bow with her real hair! And the workers behind the bar working nonstop, diligently preparing your lovely bowl of ramen. This was already putting me in a better mood. Also, if you sit at the bar, they thoughtfully put your bowl on a little platform to make it easier to eat! AND they have these genius chopsticks that are extra pointy and extra grip on the bottom (the better to pick up every last noodle!) I ordered the Totto Spicy Ramen, with an extra order of the hot sauce. Turns out I didn't even need the extra hot sauce, since the broth was already perfectly spiced! I have a VERY high tolerance for spice, and I thought this was more than enough. I think the Totto Extremely Spicy Ramen would be overkill, and you wouldn't be able to enjoy the other flavors of the chicken broth. (this was a little confusing, we thought the $1 extra "topping" hot sauce would be in the soup already, but actually you get a little bowl of hot sauce, we accidently ordered 3 of these, due to the bit of lost in translation with our waiter). OH MY GOODNESS. I took a little sip of the soup...and an amazing explosion happened in my mouth. No more bad mood from the cold, I couldn't stop smiling through my entire meal. The flavors are just absolutely astounding. The noodles are perfectly cooked. The hot sauce is delicious as its own entity. We were eating the hot sauce mixed with white rice because it was just so good. AND to make this bowl of heaven even MORE perfect...TWO pieces of the most melt-in-your mouth delicious Char-siu pork. WOW. Perfectly made. Just fatty enough, just lean enough, just gelatonous enough. I would eat an entire bowl of just this!! We also tried the Grilled Sea Urchin rice bowl which at $5.50 is quite a nice little treat, but...definitely nothing in comparison to the deliciousness of the Spicy Totto Ramen. I don't think I will last more than a week before giving in and heading there again...EVEN with the prospect of having to wait over an hour in the cold! **EDIT** The Spicy Tuna bowl is SO good. The tuna is well seasoned and fresh. Has a very green oniony flavor. If you sit at the bar you get to watch the cooks lovingly craft your bowl of yumminess!

Why is there a long wait? 4. Limited seating. 3. The food is worth waiting for. 2. The food is worth savoring. And the Number One reason why you are waiting 1. Chopsticks! I've read a few complaints about how long it takes for people to eat a bowl of Ramen. I know how to use chopsticks, I'm just not a professional. And neither are most of the people who eat here. And that's ok by me. Since it was my 1st time here and as my profile states "more spice, less salt" I went with the majority of the reviews; Spicy Ramen, extra pork, (and to make it more authentic as I heard some waiting in line state), a seasoned boiled egg. The seasoned boiled egg in the Ramen was quite a surprise. I'm not a fan of boiled eggs because most of the time the yolk is really dry. Not here. The seasoning compliments the egg and the yolk is moist. Take a bite and dunk that sucker back in the broth for another bite = joyful flavor combination. Don't let the dried seaweed scare you. Just stir it in and let it sit there until about half of your broth is gone, then eat it. As I've stated, I'm not a big salt fan. It isn't that salty. Just kinda salty/earthy. Weird, since it's from the ocean. The noodles are really fantastic. Fresh and fantastic. Pretty much the same comparison one could make with fresh Italian pasta and dried. As far as the spicy goes, it's peppery, as in black pepper. I know it doesn't look that way because it's red. And I'm not saying that's what they use. That's just the flavor I got. And I LOVE black pepper (I even put in on my popcorn (along with fresh grated Parmesan cheese)). All of the people who work here are friendly. Even the cook(?) took time to talk. Just fooling around I asked if I could buy the secret herbs and spices that were in the bag, hanging in the stock. No secret they guy told me, just rice. I'll be back.

Pretty good ramen and it's a chicken broth, so for those of you who can't eat swine then this is your place. ?Just make sure to order the chicken one because they'll put some slices of pork on your ramen otherwise. Incredibly long waits if you come during dinner. ?Be prepared to wait for a couple of hours. This place is a hole in the wall-or ground. ?Don't come here with a large group. ?The most you can have at a table is 4 people. Overall I think they can't even have 20 people inside. The trick to enjoying this place is to come on a weekday in the afternoon. You'll have a chill time and not have to wait hours.

After much anticipation, I finally decided to try this place out. Compared to the likes of Ippudo and Minca, this place was just OK. I was expecting quite a lot from the great reviews and hype, but after this, I think I want to go back to Ippudo and have their ramen instead. Me and my friend basically had to wait for an hour and half, we were starving so we went to eat dessert beforehand. I did not want to sit on the stairs next to the place like a lot of other people. I feel kind of bad for those people living there always having people block their entrance haha. Not that I am dissing those people who do sit there since I know the wait is horrible. Anyways, so after the long wait, we were seated by the bar table. My friend laughed about how we waited for so long and we only took about 20 minutes to finish our meal. I ordered the miso ramen, while my friend ordered the spicy ramen and we ordered some extra pork (I actually did not know it was the same meat from the ramen). I liked how they flare the pork with the fire gun! But the taste was just ok, a bit fatty for my taste. The portion of the ramen was big and I was fulfilled, however, the taste of the broth was just ok. It was thick, but not it did not have as much flavor as the one in Ippudo or Minca. My friend's spicy noodle was ok, surely it was spicy, but I think that is all. The pork meat was a bit fatty and my friend couldn't even finish it. Overall, it was a good try, I would not go back there for a while. On the side note, the japanese waitress was really cute haha. And it was interesting to sit at the bar table to see them cook.

Ok, this review is coming from someone who doesn't love love Ramen. With that being said, I was very impressed and happy with the Ramen dish I got at Totto Ramen- it is def the best ramen place I have been to in New York. However, the service there is a little weird. When we arrived we had to wait outside for about 20 minutes, even after people had left and there were empty tables. The place is very small but cosy. The actual service once we were allowed to come inside and eat and order was pretty good. The servers were funky cool and all very personable. Once again, the food was good. Totto Ramen is a good place to find. Oh yes, CASH ONLY!

I LOVE THIS PLACE! I absolutely love ramen and have tried many different kinds from Asia to the West Coast. I recently moved to New York and am so happy I found an awesome ramen place just a few blocks from my apartment! The soup was full of flavor and the meat was definitely high quality. The scallions and noodles were also very fresh. I went to Ippudo recently and I like Totto ramen better. A bowl at Ippudo costs around $15 whereas a bowl at Totto cost $10 and, although both are very good, I you get more bang for your buck. I also thought Totto's broth was more flavorful, but Ippudo has more variety. I have tried the Miso one as well as the less spicy pork ramen they have. Both are awesome but I prefer the one that's a little spicy. One thing I noticed was that the workers are actually Japanese and there are so many Japanese people in the restaurant every time I go. I don't know if this is a West Coast thing but a lot of the ramen places in California are owned by Koreans, so the fact that the people running the shop are Japanese definitely added a bit of authenticity to it. All in all, I definitely recommend this place!!

Totto feels more Taiwanese or Szechuan to me than Japanese despite their Japanese staff. Their ramen deserves a 4 star thanks to their side of chili/spicy sesame oil. This reminds me a lot of the base of all Szechuan dishes and the Taiwanese coarse black pepper. However since Ippudo is in the same town I would probably never go back to Totto.

Killer Ramen. Killer Cooks. Killer Looks. This place rocks! Fast savory spicy ramen with some interesting sides, and the cooks and staff are fun and friendly. Be prepared to wait outside a bit for a table, but even in the dead of winter you will warm right up with one slurp of that soup. so slurpily tasty and filling.

This is the most awesomest ramen place I've ever been to! Granted, I haven't tried Hide-chan or Ippudo yet... but I love Totto Ramen! We got a bunch of stuff, so here's a breakdown. Look at my pictures to see what each of these look like! 1. Chicken Paitan. I was soooooo freaking impressed with the broth! I've never been fanatic about tonkotsu, even though I think it's really tasty. There's just something really hearty about a chicken-y broth, especially on a cold windy NY evening. The broth is really really rich, almost richer than you anticipate chicken broth to be. It's thick and full of flavor! If you sit at the bar, you can see the chef making broth (with a big paddle) for the next couple of days! The chicken paitan comes with 2 slices of pork, minced pork, scallion and a piece of nori. The noodles are also different from other ramen places. It's straight, not curly and had a nice bouncy texture. Yummmmmm! 2. Spicy Ramen. For those who like spice, this is a great choice. Though I would advise spice-lovers to still get the chicken paitan and get a side order of the spicy rayu oil. You'd want to taste the chicken paitan broth on its own first. Then add all the spice you want! 3. Tuna Zuke Don. This was one of the specials on the wall (thank goodness I read Japanese, lol!). I think it was for $4.50, which is a great deal considering you get a huuuuuge piece of tuna over a bowl of rice with tobiko, chopped onoin, slices of nori, cucumber, scallion, sesame seeds, wasabi, and a special sesame sauce which was deeeeeelicious! 4. Mushroom Takikomi Gohan. This is a great rice dish that I love to get at Japanese restaurants. Usually it involves steaming various vegetables (like mushroom) with the rice in a clay pot. I don't know how Totto Ramen does it (but Yakitori Totto brings it to you in a clay pot), but it's delicious! The rice becomes so flavorful with the veggies - you can smell the fragrance! 5. Pork Yuzu-Mayo Don. This is on the regular menu, I think. Basically you get two pieces of blow-torch seared pork over a bowl of rice with a yuzu-mayo sauce. I personally think the mayo is overpowering because the pork is already so rich. The yuzu definitely helps. I wish this rice bowl came with a thinner, grease-cutting sauce. It was, nonetheless, delicious though! The wait for Totto Ramen is infamous, but I actually didn't think it was too bad. Even if there are 10-15 waiting in front of you, you'll get in relatively quickly (compared to other restaurants), because Totto Ramen's turnover is so fast. They serve you within minutes! Sitting at the bar is a must. You get to see all the action before you eat! It's really awesome :)

After being impressed with Ippudo a couple weeks back, my girlfriend and I have decided to check out some of the other ramen shops in the city. Given that she's not a big fan of MSG, we decided to hit up Totto next (they have a nice big sign in the front window that says no MSG). It was a bit of a haul up to the Theater District from Murray Hill, and it was pretty chilly to be waiting outside for a spot (there's no room inside to wait, so if you're going to trek out in the winter, head to the Starbucks on 8th Avenue while you wait or wear lots of layers). It was around 9 PM on a Saturday night, but we got in 30 minutes or so. There's a bar with 10 spots, along with a few tables, so it's probably not the greatest idea to come with a group. The menu is straightforward - there are a few different types of basic ramen, along with various sides you can add into the broth. I ended up getting the chicken paitan, while my girlfriend tried the miso base. I also got a soft-boiled egg and a seasoned avocado (which worked very well in the broth). I also got a pork rice ball, which was delicious but not anything too out of the ordinary. The ramen, though, was worth the wait. I'm not sure how the broth is prepared - aside from the fact they have two or three giant vats full of broth going at all times - but it was so rich with chicken flavoring. The noodles were cooked very well - just right, and not too soft so that they were soggy. I'm a bigger fan of the pork at Ippudo, mainly because I'm a sucker for braised pork belly that shamelessly displays its fattiness, but the pork here was pretty decent too...aside from the fact you get to see it cooked (aka blowtorched) right in front of you. You also get less meat in the bowl, which was disappointing but not that bad, since it's not the main part of any ramen dish. All in all, we finished up in about 40 minutes, all warmed up and ready to face the cold weather. Make sure to bring cash to pay, but aside from that, this is a very nice, very cozy place to grab an awesome bowl of ramen. I'd say that Ippudo has more broth variety and better pork, but Ippudo sticks to the basics and executes very well. I'm also a huge fan of the avocado, which was definitely a highlight that I wasn't expecting. You may have to wait a little to get in, but the wait is most definitely worth it.

Aside from the ridiculous wait time, I LOVE GOOD RAMEN. And this place surpasses good...it's great. I would definitely just give Totto 5 stars based on the ramen alone. Unfortunately, I don't like that this restaurant is so small and cramped...and I don't like standing and waiting outside.

Good stuff. ?Came here on a wintry day about 30 minutes after opening on a Saturday night. ?Pretty packed, but an hour wait total. ?All you do is write your name on the outside clipboard, and walk away. ?Luckily, Bamboo 52 was a few doors down, so we sat down and had a drink. ?We checked back after 30 minutes and then after 15 minutes, so by the time we were done with Bamboo, we just waited a few minutes outside. Talk about good timing. ?If you're not there, they just move onto the next person, and they don't call your name, ever again. ?Whew. ?We got a table and everything was quick-ordered the pork buns w/ an egg (they were mediocre) and got the spicy and extra spicy ramen. ?The extra spicy ramen just had some sauce you could dump into it. We came here a few days later on a Tuesday afternoon, and it was empty. ?The workers were eating too, so we were able to sit at the bar. ?Our server was *super* friendly and was chatting with us a lot. ?We learned that all their soup's from chicken broth, and it was nice to see them cooking (or throwing noodles etc) away. Good noodles-you get more than Ippudo and it's cheaper by about $5. ?The place is tiny, however, and only seats about 20 people. ?Great to have on a cold night, though! Oh, and it's cash only, but you already knew that, right?

This is the best ramen shop in nyc that I have found. I have tried many places throughout the city and nothing comes close to this. This place is small and always crowded with a big line outside the shop. There is a clipboard in which you write your name down and wait to be seated. I am one of those people who never wants to wait for a seat at a restaurant no matter how good it is. This is nyc and there are so many food options that it seems strange to stand outside and wait for any place. However one day I decided to wait(about 20 mins), since there were only a few people outside. The ramen was so good I could not believe I passed by that many opportunities to eat here. The soup base(chicken one) is light and flavorful. The noodles have the best bite consistency in any of the ramen shops that I have tried. The ramen is pretty filling but I always order an extra side of noodles because the noodles are that good. If you get a chance and can stand the wait(sometimes its like an hour or more) try this place, you will not regret it if you are a ramen person.

AMAZING! At first I skeptical about the 45 minute wait on a Tuesday at 6 pm. However, I'm really glad I stuck it out. This is the best ramen I've had in NYC. Way better than Ippudo or Momofuku Noodle Bar in my opinion. The staff was friendly and super quick. The place is a bit cramped, but in a good way. You really feel like you are stepping out of New York and into Japan. I had two bowls of the chicken ramen, I never usually eat that much, I just didn't want it to end!

4.5, rounded up There is *always* a wait here! ?And I *always* wait for a table because it is totally worth it. ?It is regularly an hour+ before getting seated so come with people whose company you truly enjoy, sit on the steps and appetize on some good conversation. Go-to dish is the Spicy Totto Ramen. ?It is medium spicy in a complex, savory way. The spicy bamboo shoots are just regular bamboo shoots covered in spicy pepper flake/paste. ?It's just heat, not much flavor. ? I've tried the miso ramen once and found it wayyy too salty; also the miso+meat-ball scoop turns the soup thick and murky. I really enjoy the staff here. ?They're super busy but somehow manage to be attentive to everyone in a cool, easy-going and genuine way.

If only the wait was not so long this would be my regular evening destination. It is really very good, but 1 star off for not offering the rich delicious pork broth. ?Maybe the most complex flavor I've had in the city (the firm noodles really helped), but there's always southern CA to contend with, where this one would be a bit more run of the mill. Still, it was marvelous.

Come here before 6PM and you're guaranteed a seat. Anytime afterwards, and you're forced to fight off the ramen wannabes for the next available seating. I made the mistake of getting the spicy ramen. I should've read the details on the noodles! I wanted the wavy noodles and instead got the long, sumo style noodles. Nothing note worthy but my friends got the miso and other derivation, which they absolutely loved. Don't get me wrong, it's not that I hated it but I had such high expectations. And it made me feel even worse when they all kept saying, "Mine tastes soooooooo good." The spicy also doesn't come with an egg, which I forked over an extra buck. My sake was my best friend. Speaking of the sake, $6 for a glass, not a shot, a GLASS filled to the brim of sake. You guys are beautiful man. I HAVE to go back to try the chicken broth ramen and their miso. Oh, and to hit up Bamboo 52. Seriously, they should partner up for a major booze/ramen fest.

Don't come hungry if you are in a group of more than 2, otherwise, prepare to ditch your friends and opt for a seat by the bar. I know I felt the temptation several times during our 45min+ wait. Once inside it is completely worth it. Amazing miso ramen with the perfect chewy noodles, and there are great choices for people who like their noodles spicy. Also, a vegetarian choice! (I see those very rarely on ramen menus) Also good to get is the pork belly with mayonaise over rice. It sounds funky, especially with the mayonaise, but the grilled pork belly has a great smoky taste to it. Hole in the wall ramen joint, come for the food and slurp fast. I'm waiting.

Julie 3 1/2 Stars I'm not sure if I ?qualify as a ramen expert but I really do enjoy a nice hearty bowl and have tried my share of them including places in Tokyo. This place was highly recommended by someone and the wait seemed reasonable at 40 min. ?Put your name down and go grab a beer around the corner... ? We came back in 30 min and got seated around the bar shortly. ?The place is small. ?A few tables in the back and a ramen bar up front. ?It actually looks like a typical spot, you would see in tokyo. ? Started with an order of the pork app. ?5 pieces for $4.50 and basically the pork that you get in the ramen. It was good. ?Nothing outstanding but good. ?Plus I was starving. The ramen is made with chicken soup base and it's stewed with a delicious flavor that had me finish to the bottom. ?The bowl of ramen comes with large pieces of sliced pork and additional smaller chunks of what seemed like pork as well. ?You can get it in different levels of spiciness. ?I got it it non-spicy and asked for hot sauce on the side. ?Smart move as this allows you to control the spice to your soup. All in all a good meal with a feel of real Tokyo authenticity coming from a reviewer that's really only been to Tokyo once....

Finally went back at some point. ?I'm going to keep this update short: ?The broth wasn't as good non-spicy. ?Still a decent bowl of ramen, but the oil definitely makes the ramen here go from okay to great. The pork is still amazing though...if I ever come back, I'd probably get the spicy ramen with extra pork.

Really good ramen. I was doing my best to maintain ladylike manners in front of my date and not scarf it all down at once. The pork will melt in your mouth. The noodles are al dente. Oh so good. Points to my date for bringing me here. The wait was about an hour (on a Wed night, dinner time). Guys, if you're choosing this as a date spot, it's really sweet if you get there early to put your name down & save some wait time for your date (which is what mine did).

Ramen? ?What? ?You mean noodles that you eat when you're in college because of budget and convenience? That's what I thought as well. ?And then walking by one day, I saw this long wait for a spot here at Totto Ramen, and was wondering what the hype was about. ?Maybe free ramen? So one night, ?a group of us decided to find out for ourselves. ?And boy was I wrong. Point one...get there early. ?More than likely, there will be a wait. ?This place is very small. ?But trust me, it'll be worth your while. Secondly, the food is AMAZING. ?Big bowl of noodle heaven. ?And the sake is a great compliment for any cold winter day. And you must ask for the chili that goes with the noodles. ?It gives it a great kick!

I'm usually not a huge fan of waiting in line for an hour only to get a bowl of noodle soup or what so ever, but I decided to give this place a try since I heard so many good things about it from friends. We waited 45min on a Tuesday night, had the Totto Spicy Ramen (should have pork instead of chicken), my friend had the pork noodle, much better than my chicken noodle! But honestly, I think if you are a crazy Ramen fan, Ippudo is a much better choice than Totto!

How long's the wait? 40 minutes. ?OK, then I'll just go across the street and get a drink. ?18 minutes later: Hostess: "I just called your name" Me: "OK, can I get put back on the list?" Hostess: "I'll put you in the 2nd spot. ?There's one group of 4 that needs to go in before you." Me: "OK, that sounds good to me." 30 minutes and 5 or 6 groups later, we finally got in. ?At one point the hostess seemed to be having a mental breakdown when a bunch of groups that had all been told that they were "next" simultaneously realized that a conspiracy was brewing. ?I also heard the hostess asking people "how badly they wanted it", as though that was somehow going to determine whether or not they would get a seat... As for the ramen, it's chicken-based soup with lean grilled pork instead of proper fatty chashu. ?Credit to the Japanese chefs who still got some classic ramen flavors to shine through, which allayed my fears about the chicken broth. ?But still, this is a bad idea. ?It's ramen rebranded for the stupid American palette (I'm an American, so that's just healthy self-deprecation). ?They probably had hopes of getting a lot of Times Square tourists in there. I also hate the fact that it's a fad and they're playing that up. ?When people realize how non-legit the actual food is, the excitement will wane and this place will sink into ramen obscurity. ?Sorry, Mr. Totto.

First off, the b/f & I ate: Totto Spicy Ramen - it wasn't too spicy but still had kick. Totto Ramen is best described as a glamorous hole in the wall. I think it seats about 15 people at most and they don't take reservations (yes, its one of THOSE places) & I think it might be cash only (but i'm not 100% positive.) & because Manhattan thrives on mom & pop shops (especially the hole in the wall kind) that offer quality and character I can see Totto Ramen lasting against competitors. Overall, I think T.R. provides a solid ramen experience. Many have commented about the chicken broth, the no msg, the limited menu, etc but I don't think this takes away from the ambiance or the quality of the food just because its unusual in comparison to what many expect. I actually think the healthier alternatives taste just as good as the shops that add the preservatives. I actually appreciated that it wasn't too salty as a result of cooking w/out MSG. ?Other than the organic/ healthier nature of the food, the restaurant still offers a great tasting bowl with a juicy slice of pork that they slice and cooked with a butane torch right in front of you (that is, if you're sitting at the bar). That being said, you're still likely to leave hungry since they don't really fill up the bowl with much else other than a few slices of pork and a sheet of seaweed. So in regards to value I don't know if this is the best value for ramen but you certainly won't be disappointed.

Who does not know about Totto Ramen by now? Wholesome handmade Japanese ramen place in Hell's Kitchen in New York. I very much hesitated to post this since so many people have done it already. I kept asking myself. "What is news here?" I can almost hear my old editors yelling in my head. "But I want to write about Totto", my inner self insisted. Such an excuse would never work at a real newsroom, but it works beautifully in this editor-free zone. So here we go, my defense about not-so-breaking news-post begins. Since I was introduced to Totto by A Tiger in the Kitchen, this has been THE place whenever I crave for Japanese ramen. I try to go there at odd times like 3:30pm so I can avoid the crowd. Recently, I arrived there around 4pm and there was a long line, so sadly my trick doesn't work anymore. It seems like every New Yorker knows about this heaven. On a recent cold snowy night, we called them to ask how crowded it was. "Not much!" , waiter giggled. I calmed down my husband with this news. ? We arrived at Totto only to discover there were more than 10 people ahead of us. It's not CROWDED by their standard. Do you get it? About 30 minutes later, we sat down. We started with this rice bowl called 'Soboro Char Don'. This is basically white rice topped with shredded pork with soy sauce. Sprinkled scallion and chopped onion is refreshing and tangy working through salty meat. What a joy. We loved it so much that we asked for another bowl for take-out. One of ramen men responded. "Only if you bring your own plastic container." Well, we didn't even have a doggy bag with us. Unsuccessful attempt. This was a special menu on that day, so it's not offered every day. Spicy vegetable noodle($12). This noodle has less broth but abundant veggies from mushroom, bamboo shoots, red/yellow pepper, avocado, and torch-burnt tofu. It's a delightful bowl with such organic aroma. Spicy avocado tastes like grapes, almost. Even though the soup doesn't have full taste like chicken broth, it's nurturing in a healthy and light way. I wish they can reduce the amount of sesame oil, so I can have even clearer taste of the soup. Totto Ramen is specialized in thick hearty chicken broth. Once they told me "in New York, there are only 2 places offering chicken broth ramen including us", so where is the other? Kambi could be it. I tried Kambi's chicken broth ramen, but it's like weak Americano coffee to italian espresso. It's so milky that it's hard to believe it's not pork. Every time I go, I choose Totto Spicy ramen($10.25). It's just so good. Red spicy oil with toasted garlic is irresistible. To me, it's like instant noodle powder meets long-boiled ox bone soup taste, which I love to relate to. Wavy homemade noodle is cooked al dante. Broiled chars (pork slices) are finished with powerful torch blow like the top picture. It's soft , chewy, and crusty. Totto's big brother, Hide-Chan Ramen is on the other side, on East Side. They offer mainly pork broth oriented fuller menu. Hide-Chan is for more grown ups with business suit, minute to minute scheduled life style, and etc. Totto maintains a unique underground aurora, and they are literally underground. ? Now, a new high-end-traditional enough Korean restaurant, Danji just opened on the same block. Since then, the situation got a little more complicated. It's not ?easy to abandon Danji before I get to Totto. Conflict, conflict. However, if the conflict is about choosing between Danji and Totto, I will welcome it. Anytime.

Perhaps the best ramen place I've been to in New York City so far (but I know there are plenty more still to try). I went in without too many expectations since I was so sorely disappointed by other highly recommended places, like Ippudo. The place is very small and the wait to be seated was very long. We had to stand outside in the chilly night air for over an hour. But it was WELL worth it. I ordered the vegetable ramen and I was immediately intrigued when they brought me a pedestal for my bowl, but not for my friend who ordered a different kind of ramen. Apparently, my bowl was shaped differently from hers and needed extra height for me to eat from it? Whatever the case was, when my ramen came out, I practically melted to the floor from how good it was. The broth alone was heavenly -- made from a seaweed and shiitake mushroom base, which is one of my favorite mushrooms to begin with because of its satisfying umami taste. The ramen came topped with seasoned avocado (YES, AVOCADO! I never imagined avocado in my ramen!), seasonal vegetables, peppery Yuzu paste, sesame oil, salted kelp and lime. The balance of flavors was absolutely addicting from the first slurp and I was quite sad when even my soup was gone.

Oh the wait was definitely worth it! ?As soon as you're captured by the aroma you'll find yourself nodding to any wait-time they give you. This place specializes in chicken paitan (a chicken soy broth), which is a nice vacation from the normal broths of other ramen shops. ?They have great side specials (I had charred uni over rice last time) and the atmosphere is exactly what a ramen spot should be like.

After coming to Totto Ramen several times, I finally found a good task to pass the time waiting for a seat... Yelp it up of course! So we usually start with char sui, then move on to bowls of the mainstay ramen dish "chicken paitan", which is somewhat unique as the broth is based on chicken broth instead of pork. One option, to order it with super spicy sauce I also good, as it not thaaaat bad. Also you can opt to get the spice on the side and add it yourself. Overall I think this is right on our top three along with Momofuku and Ippudo. BUT then there's the times (more than once) where the host guy let's some random people in that weren't on line which is kind of douche. So that is minus one star.

Food: 5/5 Decor: 3/5 (Great because I feel like I'm in Japan) Service: 5/5 (It doesn't get better than a grinning chef who chuckles and bows when you say "Oishi! (tasty)) You can really tell he enjoys what he does." There really is no point for me to write any more about Totto Ramen. All has been said. Also, I'm only helping to increase the people on the waiting list every evening. Anyways, EXTRA SPICY RAMEN is where it's at. I asked the chef if I should add the spicy chili oil gradually, he said it was my choice, but he had a customer who added it all in one-shot and suffered the consequences. I would come back. again. for the 4th time.

Installing air conditioning was a fantastic summer-heat friendly move, especially seeing as how ramen is not exactly the first thing you crave when it's 90 degrees plus outside. Having said that, I still took advantage of the first lull in temperature to go back and re-experience the savoury goodness of their chicken broth, this time with their spicy ramen. ?Again, I loved being able to savour the entire bowl without feeling overly burdened by (admittedly uber tasty) pork fat, and slowly I feel myself being won over to the chicken broth camp. The spiciness of their spicy ramen was also "just right": enough heat to make make you notice, but not so much that your taste buds are scorched and incapable of tasting anything else. ?Note that this version was rated with only a few chili peppers worth of heat - I tremble to think what madness may ensue with the alternative super spicy version that had a chili pepper rating that stretched across the length of the menu... ?!?!

I lift the fresh, chewy ramen noodles out of their steaming bath of miso broth. ?Delicious meaty soy sauce miso broth fills my mouth. ?Also in my bowl of vegetarian ramen: two slices of surprisingly creamy and delicious seasoned avocado, a rare and yet enjoyable addition to hot soup. ? Ramen cravings? ?Fulfilled. My only wish? ?That Totto also would offer a cold ramen dish similar to the one at Minca. ?Non-traditional, but extra refreshing on a hot summer day when you want to feel cool And still get your ramen fix.

hmmmm ramen. I honestly need to go to Japan now and go on a ramen tour. Totto Ramen is a complete hole in a wall. Definitely seats about 20 people at a time. Came during lunch, and wait was only 30 minutes or less, so not too shabby. I definitely like the decor of Totto than Ippudo. Ippudo is chic and trendy, Totto feels more authentic, and even more so because the chefs were Japanese, instead at Ippudo it was very white. The clientle at Totto was predominantly Japanese, where Ippudo was trendy lower east-siders, so yea, go to ramen where there is actual legit Japanese people. So comparing Totto and Ippudo based on three categories: noodles, broth, char siu. Noodles - I think I liked the ramen noodles at Ippudo more. It was more of a chew, a bounce and a bite. There was a give when I bit down. Totto was good, but a different consistency, and I liked Ippudo more. However at Totto I got the Spicy Ramen, which seemed to be different noodles than the Miso, which may have been a better ramen. Broth - Loved the spicyness at Totto, not spicy enough, next time I would go for extreme. I didn't get the normal broth at Totto, whereas I did at Ippudo, so it's hard to compare the too. However, Totto's broth did have more fatty gobulars, which is yumsies. oh yea I liked how Totto used a sieve to pour the broth from laddle to your bowl, to take out the impurities. Char Siu - Hands down is Totto. All the way. The pork at Ippudo was too dry. I love how Totto had a hand flame torch to make the pork crispy. Loves! I would go back to Totto, I would go back to Ippudo, but not to wait over an hour.

Tutto Ramen v. Ippudo Or so it seems - the main ramen rivalry! And my friend picked Tutto Ramen. Why? "The noodles don't get soggy as quick!" How quick? I didn't ask - I was too busy eating their addicting char siu pork with the ramen. Oh, and by the way, get extra pork. It's really so good, and the ramen too. Best I've ever had, to date! And I'm not so sure if I can find better - their noodles are just ... firm, thick, strong, good-looking, mouth-drooling... Remember, I'm talking about them tasty noodles. They're SOOO GOOD! TIPS: - Go on an off-hour. During peak hours, you may have to wait an hour for a seat. And they don't take reservations.

Went here on a Friday afternoon/evening around 4:30. 10 minute wait, though the time from seating to food arriving was less than 5. That impressed me-- was on the edge about giving 3 stars or 4. ? Ordered the standard chicken ramen soup. The pork pieces were a little small and got lost in the soup, but noodles were nicely al dente, and the chefs were cheerful and talkative. Maybe too many onions for my taste though. Place is absolutely tiny, and cash only. 3.5 stars

OMG! The ramen here is amazing!! So it was our first time in NY and we went to go see the Statue of Liberty that day, but unfortunately, it was rainy and extremely cold (We just came from TX where it was really hot). My jeans were wet and my shoes were soggy. I was extremely grumpy...until we stopped at Totto. At first, I wasn't hungry so I kept telling my husband we should just share a bowl. But he didn't want to ?so I ended up getting my own. I'm so glad I did! It was so good I ended up finishing the whole thing and was actually debating on if I should get another bowl or not. Too bad it was our last day in NY. I wished we had known about it earlier so we could have gone again. I still can't find a place like this anywhere in Houston!

4-4.5 stars I had the spicy pork ramen with egg, bean sprouts, green onion and extra shredded pork. It was worth the 45 min wait at 9:45 on a Tuesday night (for 1 person). Totto is very small - I counted 20 seats. Staff are very pleasant and the food is delicious as well as very reasonable. I would say this is as good as Ippudo and maybe even better (and most definitely a better value)...though I think I need to go to both again to compare. Will return.

I scoped this place out early in my trip returning from another restaurant, and returned for a late evening bowl of ramen, which hit the spot. The atmosphere is more of what I am ?used to...a nice hole-in-the-wall feel with quality food, albeit in this case a tiny "neat" hole-in-the-wall joint. Since the rooster motif is used to represent this place I choose the "Totto Chicken Paitan Ramen". ?In any soup noodle dish, no matter the country, it's always about the broth. ?In this case, the freshly-made chicken both, with scallions, onions, and nori brought a smile to my little face, which continued throughout my meal. Their homemade noodles were also excellent...perfect texture. ? My only critique is that I would like to see more pieces of chicken in the dish. I will, however, miss getting my paws around this bowl. : )

Best ramen I've had in NY. The line is LONG and the restaurant is very tiny and stuffy. The pork broth is tasty, but not too rich. There' s pork slices and other tasty things on top of the ramen. I also liked the chopped up onion on top of the noodles, I thought it gave a nice texture. If you like uni, the uni rice bowl is delicious and a good deal. Easiest to go with just 2 people, there isn't a lot of room in the restaurant. The service is no nonsense and food comes out quickly once you get a seat.

Lucked out and didn't have to wait that long. We were here before 5pm. Tried the Ika-Yaki. It was tasty. I like the garnishes with the squid. It had really good texture. I ordered the niki-ramen which had a lot of bbq pork. ?I really enjoyed the flavor of the broth. ?It was meaty from all the pork, but also creamy and smooth from the pork fat. ?I also like how many ?pieces of meet that were given. ?There were a couple of different cuts of pork, more more fatty than others, but the meat they gave could make their own plate of goodness.

I noticed on the wall that they had a meat special ramen, which is their regular ramen with a bunch more pork. ?I decided to try that. ?The ramen was tasty. ?The broth was very good, not as rich as some others, but still delicious. ?The noodles themselves were good as well and had some bite. ?In terms of the meat, I got a huge portion. ?I love pork belly as much as the next guy, but this was ridiculous. ?Sooo much fat all over the place. ?If I ate everything I'm sure I would have felt disgusting for a couple days. ?The meat was good though, very fatty and rich. ?Next time I come back I'll just get their regular ramen.

It's only been a week or so but I was back tonight. ?This time I ordered the Miso ramen and since we were in a group, we were able to order the pork rice to share as well. ? The pork-don is simply 3 pieces of their ramen pork seared and laid over a bowl of rice. ?They also add some scallions and a yuzu mayo sauce. ?It's actually very good and if you really want to taste their pork in its most natural state, that's the best way to do it. ?I just wish they would give you more pork, haha. ? The miso ramen is served with a different variety of noodle. ?It's a curly noodle and while still good, I prefer the noodles they use in their regular ramen. ?Tonight, the noodles weren't served quite as al dente as previous but they were still very good. ?The miso ramen is a good bowl and this time, I was smart enough to order extra pork. I love their pork. ?I think I rank it dead even as a tie between Santouka, Totto and a local place in LA called Daikokuya. ?Each is uniquely different but I really love how Totto's pork is juicy without being overly fatty and searing the pork before putting it into the bowl makes a world of difference. ? The main negatives about Totto ramen is the wait time (about 30 minutes) and the price - about $10 per bowl. ?However, it is currently my favorite bowl of ramen in Manhattan. ?As such, I will have to fork over the $10 until I find something better. ? The search continues!

It was probably 100+ degrees outside and about 150 inside this tiny, cute Totto Ramen dining room and I still liked it... Their AC was out and after going through this type of sauna dining experience and still like the food its kind of impressive. I really enjoyed my vegetarian noddles, it was tasty, fresh and HOT in all senses... can't wait for the temperature to go down; I will be going back to try some of their other dishes. As for now, only limited menu, but I'm looking forward for their future additions and for a more cool dining experience.

While this place is good, it's definitely not as good as Ippudo. The wait isn't as bad as Ippudo. I definitely have to say that eating at Ippudo is more comfortable than eating at Totto. But the thing is, when eating at Totto, it feels more authentic, as if you were in a ramen shop/stand in Japan. The chefs were really nice and really cool to talk to. Don't dismiss this place. Have both places and see which you prefer. I'm just an individual that prefers Ippudo over this place but I don't discount this place at all. It's good fresh ramen - good broth - and overall a very enjoyable experience. I would definitely recommend to ramen / noodle / carb lovers.

Very Very well made noodles (both kinds). The wait was pretty long, and the heat was getting to me a little (No AC where I was. I think they had it more in the back because I was seated near the entrance). Other then those two things, it was totally worth it to try this place out. I got the miso ramen, and I loved it. The soup was not too oily or salty, and the staff was very very nice to us. It's pretty small though, but you KNOW that if a place is a hole-in-the-wall place and there is STILL a long line of people waiting outside in the summer heat, you KNOW that the food has to be great.

Dear Totto, I really like you, and I think you're a great bowl of ramen. ?But I just don't feel the love. ?Maybe your chicken soup base is just not enough for me. ?Or your "Extremely Spicy Ramen" is a little too peppery and not enough spicy (don't be offended, I am after all, Indonesian). ?Or I just couldn't quite get on board with avocado topping addition. ?I'm not sure... I guess the real reason I'm trying to say is: you leave me out in the cold. ?Literally. ?I mean, I read about you, I heard good things about you, I saw your wonderful pictures and I really thought we had something there. ?I thought it was going to be... love at first bite. ?But alas, I waited for over an hour (in the cold, drizzling rain!) only to be greeted nonchalantly and teased ever so unmercifully with just okay ramen. I'm so sorry. ?It's not going to work out between us. ?Maybe it's not you, maybe it's me. ?But then again, it is you. ?You are convenient because you're just a short walk away from Times Square, but really, I think I'd rather navigate the subways to go to my ex ramens. Good bye Totto. ?I wish you well.

I haven't given out 5 stars in a looong time! 5 stars for food, service, price, and atmosphere! Sure, it's kind of a dive-y place because it's a very loud and tiny space, but I think that's how you're supposed to enjoy ramen, no? Also, the ramen is the best I've tasted outside of Japan. In fact, it's just like the ramen one would find in Japan. I've only been here once but plan to come back again soon, for only $7-10 bucks for a big, satisfying bowl of delicious soup noodles. The last time I was here I shared a miso ramen and another ramen that I can't remember the name of but it was very garlicky. The garlicky ramen is definitely my favorite. The service was really quick and awesome too, and even though it was a tiny space that only seats around 15-20 people, they didn't rush us out. Perfect place for a quick dinner for one if you're getting out of work late and need a bite!

Had the spicy Lamen. It was decent. nothing mind blowing, actually my brain taste buds already forgot what's it all about. basically not that memorable in my book. Also went with a big group, I semi-purposely got there a good 10 minutes late, expecting there be some wait time....uh yea, we wait another 10 minutes. lame.

This is some of the best Ramen I've ever had. The flavor is definitely there, and you know it is fresh because pot after pot is being cooked right in front of you. I love the piece of torched pork they put in your bowl as well. Plus you can wash it all down with a nice cold Sapporo! The only problem here is that it is such a small place so you will most likely be waiting outside anywhere from 15-60 min. Oh, and I do not recommend coming in with large groups because you may not all be able to get seated to eat at the same time, I've seen it happen to people.

my totto ramen experience has been a long process in-the-making. i remember when this place first opened up a year and a half ago. my dear friend kevin c. RAVED about this place. i remember looking it up on yelp back then. roughly 30 reviews. solid 4 stars. ok that was that... bookmarked! and so i waited for an opportunity to try this place. and waited. and waited. apparently i'm never in midtown. at least not when this place is open. so FINALLY after 1.5 years, i found myself in midtown on a tuesday for lunch. sure enough, i rushed over here like a madwoman right before it opened.. and found a line about 35 people deep. i should've known better. totto ramen is now sitting at 800 reviews, STILL a solid 4 star restaurant. OBVIOUSLY i should've come half an hour before the restaurant opened to line up. DUH. so i ended up waiting an hour to be seated. didn't help that i was with a party of 4 and the place doesn't look like it can seat more than 20 people max. but was it worth it? HELL FREAKING YES. on a cold cold winter's day, their totto spicy ramen sure hits the spot. i've never had chicken-based broth, but it was a surprisingly delicious change of pace. it's not as heavy as the typical pork-based broth, but its depth of flavor is just as comparable. i was slightly scared off by the number of hot peppers displayed on the menu next to their totto extreme spicy ramen. but after talking to one of the chefs, i found out that it's only TWICE as spicy as the normal totto spicy ramen. next time! at about $10 a bowl, i find their ramen to be extremely affordable. for only $1 each, you can get a whole boiled egg or menma (my faves) or a bunch of other toppings. or for only $2.50, extra noodles. compared to ippudo (still my reigning favorite in town), the portions here may be only the slightest bit smaller, but a whole hell of a lot more affordable. i love the noodles here better, slighly less al dente than ippudo. but ippudo's tender chashu wins out by far. ippudo may have a slight edge overall in my book, but totto ramen definitely comes in a VERY CLOSE second.

If I could somehow eat here without waiting an hour plus I would give this place 5 stars. I haven't been able to frequent it as often as I'd like because quite honestly the wait is prohibitively long. I usually put my name down, go to a nearby bar and knock back a beer or so and come back - and I still end up waiting. However, given all the Japanese ramen joints in the city, this place takes the cake!! The ramen broth, the noodles, the char siu pork are all delicious and has none of that MSG taste that Ippudo ramen unfortunately reeks of (translation: you won't need buckets of water to quench your thirst and clean your palate afterwards). They use a handheld blowtorch to cook the char siu pork, and I don't know if this is the reason but the meat is amazingly juicy. All I want is for Totto Ramen to expand upwards or sideways so they can accommodate more than 15 people at a time.

I am big fan of Totto branding, and went Totto Ramen for the first time. ?It is a bit of walk from my work on 6th Ave, but who cares. I got there around 01:30pm, and had to wait about 10 min or so. In side is a typical Japanese ramen hub seems like. I ordered Gekikara Ramen, which means very very spicy ramen. ($10.72) The broth is very thick Tonkotsu style, and they put the hot sauce on the side so that I can adjust the spicyness which was good. ? The noodles are a bit firm, it could have been boiled a bit longer. I ordered Kaedama which is the side of extra noodle for $2.50. The chefs are very friendly and service was good.

Honestly the best ramen I've had. My girlfriend and I went to see Avenue Q one afternoon and immediately went to Totto. We got there at 5:11 (it opened at 5) and there was a large crowd already. The place is tiny and can only fit probably no more than 25 people. The wait will probably be better if you're going solo. Girlfriend and I waited outside for about an hour. I recommend getting there as early as possible and having an early dinner because you will be waiting for a couple of hours otherwise. Food was amazing. We both tried the spicy ramen and it was the perfect amount of heat. We also tried a squid yakitori skewer with garlic and it was delicious. Also no frills on the drinks, as far as I noticed. Just water which was kind of refreshing. Don't worry about slurping: it's normal and polite!

I've been on a ramen kick lately getting ready for winter, so of course I had to hit Totto. This is one of my favorite ramen restaurants in the city. A long long wait to get in, but a near perfect bowl of chicken ramen. Get with the spicy and your taste buds will love you all day long.

I have been coming here for a little over a year. I first came here on a friends recommendation as I am a huge fan of ramen. Almost every time we go, usually at night, there is about a 1 hour wait. The wait is no big deal since there are a few pubs and bars in the area so waiting goes by pretty fast. The place itself is quite small which is good in a way as you get to know the cooks a little better. They have seats at the bar and a few tables in the back. They have a pretty limited selection to just different types of ramen. I have tried all the different variations of ramen here and personally I prefer the regular miso ramen. The broth is amazing in all the different variations and they have options to select additional items to be put in the ramen. Overall, I cant find another comparable place to this place, and the best part is its cheap! PS If your friends are meeting up with you here, make sure they all show up before your name is called or else you most definitely get bumped from the list. Ive gotten bumped a few times, but they put us back on the list. Also there is a rack above the bar to put your belongings.

Holy Cow! Ippudo...move aside....Totto is coming right through!! Came today at 5PM(On a Saturday), right when they opened and still ended up waiting an hour until it was our turn. My gf and I both ordered the Totto Spicy Ramen... Most people who love Ramen knows that the first thing you taste is the soup...and let me tell you.....this soup base is pretty fuking amazing! Oh Em Gee! You can definitely tell that they spend a long time making the soup....cause its full of flavors! But i kinda didnt like the quality of the noodle..its rather square..not rounded like the usual ramen...but its ok...the soup base really has won me over!! As for the cha-siu, it was tender and yummy!! My gf and I were still hungry after we finished our Totto Spicy Ramen..and decided to order some more stuff.....I decided to go with Totto Chicken Paitan Ramen and My gf ordered the Vegetable Ramen.....our waiter was shocked after knowing we each finished a bowl of ramen..and still wanted more...his facial expression was priceless.....lol....we are such monsters! =X! Totto Chicken Paitan Ramen was pretty amazing as well....the chicken chunks, and cha-siu is juicy....and the soup! My GOSH! LOL~ Vegetable Ramen was ok....there were lots of veggies and they were all fresh...not bad... I need to come back and try their Miso...and maybe try their extremely spicy ramen....wooot ?woot....LOVE LOVE LOVE!

My first review in forever, so it'd better be a good one, right? I don't give five stars... and I don't know what it was about this place... but I think it deserves them! Maybe it's the enthusiastic chef/server who adorably sang along to every Michael Jackson song that came across the speakers (and compulsively perfected every single order of ramen)... or maybe the hollers of "IRASHAIMASE!" that echoed across the tiny tiny restaurant every time the door opened. Or maybe it was the 4 (or 5?) wearied Japanese travelers that look like they had just stepped off a plane (suitcases in tow and everything!) and made this place their first stop before heading home... anyway, I loved it. The food was incredible too. Ramen with the perfect amount of bite. Spicy broth that had just that perfect amount of body and mouthfeel that really makes a good bowl of ramen. And get any variation of "spicy." Their homemade sesame chili oil is incredible; you can taste all the flavors meld together and married with the scallions... ugh. It's disgusting it's so good. So you get a delicious, warm, and comforting bowl of ramen....really, what could you want more out of life?

I'm in love with Totto Ramen. I love the setup. The place is small but feels authentic! There was a line when we got there. There are tables and counter. Even though the day was a hot one we were so ready to eat some yummy ramen. The size and portion of ramen was pretty decent. However, I question about MSG free. Regardless, I'm going back! I got Totto Spicy Ramen. It was fabulous! I LOVE LOVE the char siu pork. It melted in my mouth and very tasty/flavorful. It's the BEST tasting char siu I ever had. I would pick Totto Ramen over Ippudo. I wasn't impressed with the ramen I had there. The price of the dish is very reasonable here. The cost of my dish was only $10.25. Next time, I'm getting extra char siu pork. My friend got Totto Miso Ramen and she totally enjoyed her dish. I can't wait for another round of ramen at Totto Ramen. I think it's the best ramen I've had. I've tried Momofuku noodle bar and I wasn't impressed. Paid hefty price for small portion and the soup was insipid. I've also tried Ippudo which was ok. I won't compare Sapporo to this list.

All I can say is I'm happy I noticed the sanitation grade on the way out. ?But Totto Ramen was a great experience, and I'm really glad I went. ?It wasn't too cold of a night so it was fine to wait outside and catch up with a friend, but I'm not sure I would go in the middle of winter. ?We probably waited about 1.5 hours. ?I got the vegetarian bowl with extra crunch seaweed on top and it was delicious! ?It was also presented beautifully and had tons of great veggies in it. ?Glad I finally tried this place - would definitely recommend.

At first I was very hesitant to try this place out because I am such a big fan of ippudo and never thought any other ramen would be as good. Well I was wrong. It was just as good, if not better, and cheaper. Totto ramen has taken it to another level. I had the spicy ramen and the broth was most impressive. It was layers and layers of flavor and kept getting better every spoonful. The place is small and there's always a wait. I was in a party of 4 on a Wednesday night and waited for about an hour. It was definitely worth the wait. ?It's an open kitchen and the cooks are entertaining.

I have discovered my second favorite ramen place behind Ippudo. ?Which is a huge compliment. ?Can you imagine a girl being the second hottest girl next to Scarlett Johannsen? ?Not too shabby of a compliment is it? Despite my hesitations behind the chicken broth, it works well, especially when mixing in the miso or spicy based pastes. And their pork, dare I say is the best pork I've had in ramen. ?Well again, it equals Ippudo's, but you don't have to pay extra. ? Not quite as good as Ippudo, but more accessible, cheaper, and damn tasty.

Thursday around 7pm Wait was 1:15 minutes. Half way through, I asked myself. If I leave now, the half a hour is going to be waisted......so I stayed. I asked the two guys behind the counter, "What should I have for a fist timer?" The guy with a torch said, "Miso Ramen!". I also asked for Broiled Char-ciu Pork on veggies. I thought I expected so much after reading good reviews AND the long wait to find my Ramen and broiled pork were okay. Visually, taste, texture and most importantly Umami weren't apparent. I rather spend my $20 for Ramen at Rockmeisha in West Village. Rockmeisha Ramen (they only have one kind Ramen) was rather smaller but it was solid! This experience might be due to very busy hours so I will give a try if I am around that nabe and hungry after lunch and before dinner time. I will try Chicken Paitan Ramen next time. Chicken broth used in Ramen is very unusual.

This place is always packed when I walk past. So the other day I finally gave in and waited in line to get a taste. The guy/host manning the door was funny and entertaining. He gave all of us waiting a good laugh a few times. The place is extremely small and no somewhere you want to go if you want to take your time and relax over food. The food was really good, fresh ingredients cooked right in front of you. It was very fast paced service with people ready to take your order before you have looked at the menu. The food is what wins my 4 stars. No MSG! I like the cute small aspect of it but it has room for growth in space, they would have the people to come.

Waited half hour / 45 minutes at 3:30 in afternoon. Liked the amount of scallions, bean sprouts and meat they added to the dish (more than other places) but the spicy oil in the broth was a little alarming at times. Took away from enjoying the flavor of the noodles. Maybe just wasn't expecting it and I do love spicy (korean) ramen. I most recently had been to Ramen Yebisu in Williamsburg and couldn't help but compare, thinking this bowl was just as good as the one I had there and did not have to wait.

Came here for lunch. ?As usual, it was about a hour wait. ?Advice to 1st timers, do not forget to sign your name on the clipboard. ?Very important!! ? We ordered their Chicken Ramen and Miso Ramen. ?I only tried the chicken ramen. ?First I would have to comment on the noodles. ?I thought the noodles was just okay. ?It was a little chewy and hard. ?Not sure if that's just inherent in the noodles they chose to use or they didn't cook it long enough. ?Best way to describe the taste is it was uncooked pasta. ?Reason I'm giving this place 4 stars is because of the broth. I absolutely loved the broth. ?It has a mild sweet taste to it and a potato/earthy taste. ?In addition, the broth was thick compared to other ramen places that I've tried. ?The broth is made with whole chicken, onions, and rice. ?I'm not sure how long the broth has been boiling for, but I would guess at least 5-6 hrs before hand. ?The rice is in the bag that is hanging/attached to the side of the pot. ?I am assuming that is what is giving the mild sweetness and "potato" flavor I tasted. ?I loved the thickness of the broth and the flavor. ?The pork that came with it was more on the fatty side. ?I wish the slices of pork were a little thicker. ?They add fresh green onions and a sheet of seaweed which is nice. When we left, they didn't even say goodbye. I would definitely recommend this place to others. ?Seems like an excellent place to go to during a snow day =D I would definitely come back here again. Service is just mediocre because they need fast turn around in the restaurant and they have extremely limited seating. The cooks are friendly. Ambiance and decoration is sub-par. ?It's definitely no date place.

I went to Totto when it was hailing out thinking the wait would be short. Little did I know, people will come here rain/snow/hail or shine. Waited for an hour before I had my first bowl of spicy ramen from this place. It was definitely worth the wait. The total Totto experience probably has to consist of 1. The wait with the teasing smell of the broth to 2. Whet your appetite so you can 3. truly enjoy and appreciate the entire bowl of whichever ramen you ordered. The noodles are cooked al dente. I ordered the spicy ramen with bamboo shoot and seasoned egg. Wasn't too impressed by the bamboo shoot. It was too salty for me. Besides the additions, the spicy ramen came with bbq pork. I wish it would be a bit thinner making it easier to bite. Overall, i was very satisfied with my order. The soup was definitely a lot more flavorful than other ramen places I have tried. Impressed that it didn't have MSG and I believe it since it did not make me super thirsty afterward. I will definitely go again but I am not too sure if I want to go through ENTIRE Totto experience, wait and all. If you are a ramen fan, definitely give this place a try. Great for warming up in the winter.

You would think that after a few drinks, a bowl of piping hot ramen would be heavenly bliss, right? I was wrong. I've heard and read rave reviews about this place so I was excited to try this last night. We waited about an hour for 3 seats by the bar which is kind of cool because you get to see everything getting assembled. I got the Miso Ramen ($10.50) with a side of Ryu(?) chili sauce ($1.50) and bamboo shoots ($1). Verdict: Broth was tasty ?but not very hot and my noodles were undercooked. I know ramen is supposed to be a ?bit al dente but this was just not cooked long enough. I was hoping that the broth would cook the noodles some more but it just wasn't hot enough to do that. Also, the broth was a bit salty and I kept having to drink LOTS of water! It was a disappointing first time but I will come back again just to give this place another try before I make a final judgment. I think it'll go for the traditional ramen next time and try some of their tuna appetizer as well (it looked delish!)

Tiny Place. ?This is how Japan feels people. Calm down. Came here on a pouring day .. after work on wednesday. No luck- still a long wait. People were crowded waiting outside the place under their umbrellas. (There's no room to wait inside). We put our names on the list and just chilled in the car and chatted instead of standing in the cold rain. So for me, the wait didnt feel TOO bad. -seared tuna appetizer- tasted really salty like they preserved the tuna. was not what i expected and didn't like it. -seared uni over rice- anything with uni is good to me. instant win. -spicy pork ?ramen- the spiciness was weird. not what i expected. instead of "spicy" it felt more like REALLY PEPPERY. So much so that it felt hard to eat the noodles and i felt my throat closing up and made it impossible to drink the soup. Idk, does that make sense? But other than that, it was really good. Will come back and try other things!

For me and my lack of Asian culture...I guess...I thought the broth was a little tasteless. That is not to say that it was not good. I do appreciate that the broth was not like a salt lick and I could taste the other flavors going on in the soup. I don not appreciate the 10 + times I wanted to try this place but there was no way I was going to wait in that crowd. I started out with the Ave Tuna Special which was the most amazing tuna I have ever tasted! If they put a few more slices of this on a bowl of rice I would come in here and eat this everyday! It was accompanied with a sprout and onion salad and avocado, with a special sauce. YUM! I tried the Totto Spicy Ramen and added the mushrooms, and boiled egg. The egg was very good and very flavorful and the mushrooms were sliced thin and crunchy. The pork in this soup is very good, I believe it is the pork belly which is a fatty piece that they blow torch before serving...its fun to watch. I wanted to ask for salt I must admit but I didn't want to embarrass myself or insult them. This type of Ramen takes some getting used to. Later I tried the Soy sauced rice with the mushroom (I love mushrooms) with fish and seaweed. It was good but you have to really like fishy taste. It was a bit much for me. The service in this tiny place is very very good. Very friendly. They guys behind the bar (if your so privileged to get a seat there) will talk to you and ask how you liked your food. Super cool! When I asked about the Spicy Bamboo the man who was cooking was happy to give me a sample to try. A+++ for that! The question is: Is it worth the wait? I would have to say no. Why? Well, honestly, if you go to the East Village along St. Marks Place there are several Ramen and Udon restaurants all of which have a minimal waiting time if any at all. Also, this place accepts CASH ONLY. On the other hand if you are a vegetarian or have a problem with salt this may be heaven for you.

Came here a couple of weeks ago, arrived about 15min after openning on a sunday evening, had to wait about 1 hour to get seated. (13 tables of 2-4 were ahead of me at 5:15). The wait is definitely comparable to Ippudo. The ramen was excellent. I had the spicy ramen, a little bit of a kick, but not too hot to destroy the flavor of the broth. The chicken based broth is not as heavy as the pork based broth at other ramen houses. I enjoyed both the atmosphere and the noodles. The only complaint would be the additional egg topping seems to be hard boiled. I would've preferred if it was soft boiled.....

Disclaimer: I haven't been eating ramen like I do burgers, so this might need a little rewrite after I hit up a few more places for comparison. I went to Totto right after work yesterday and my friend and I were able to slide in to the last two seats. This tiny ramen spot consists of nothing more than 10 or so bar seats and 3 tables. To sit at a table, you need 4 people. Since we were the last unlucky ones in, we were seated right in front of two huge vats of boiling liquid. I was laughing to myself about having spent two sweltering summer days eating in front of boiling water as I had Chinese hot pot the day before. I menu was simple, as with most ramen places. I got the spicy ramen and it came with some cha siew (pork), bean sprouts, a nori square and of course noodles. It was $10.50, which while not being expensive, is still a few dollars more than the other ramen places I've been to. On top of that, the other ramen places always gave me mores add-ins. At Totto, anything extra you'd like in the noodles is an additional charge. The noodles were good, but in no way spectacular. I think the discomfort that came with eating in a fog of hot vapor gave a slight decline to my experience. By the time we were done, there was a small crowd outside waiting for seats. I don't live or work anywhere near this place so getting my average rating mean I'm unlikely to come back. When I left, however, I did find out they own a separate location (Hide-chan Ramen) in Midtown East. That might have to be my next destination.

I absolutely adored this place and felt rightly justified for my 45 min wait after a bit of the spicy char siu musubi (rice ball) and first sip of the broth. ? First the musubi. It had all the right elements - moist rice, spicy and tasty filling, and crisp nori. ?YUM! ?I think I could easily down 3 of those so it's probably a good thing that they aren't so accessible. The classic ramen was delish! The broth was just perfect - tasty without over-seasoning and just the right amount of sodium content. ?The noodles were chewy. ?While I was impressed that they blow torched the individual char siu pieces, I did find mine a bit too fatty. All in all, I would go back when I'm in the area. ?YUM!!!!

They only do ramen, but by george, do they do it well. Oh so so so well. Seriously, this would be 5 stars if the place was bigger so i could take more people to this wonderful little gem. The guy behind the counter was super friendly and nice. My dining partner had asked for extra noodles, and the guy said just let him know when he's ready so he would have fresh noodles. The guy was super friendly with all the patrons and the banter between the staff was pretty entertaining. Love the pork and love watching them 'brulee' it with the torch. The broth is unmatched in my opinion, as well as the rayu (spicy oil). Now, I love the spicy ramen, but the real difference between the spicy ramen and super spicy ramen isnt so much 'spicy' as it is 'peppery' as in 'black peppery'. The first time i went, my date had the super spicy, but it just tasted more like a ton of black pepper hit the bowl rather than more spiciness. In either case, the ramen is amazing. I also love that they have ramen for everyone. Dont do pork? hit up the chicken ramen. Dont do either? hello vegetarian ramen. Want toppings? well theres a whole side of the menu for you. The ramen is fantastic, the prices are great, staff is amazing. But be warned - CASH ONLY! so hit up the atm before you go!

The ramen is great, but the wait is always ridiculous. Only at off hours is it even feasible to get in off a 10-15min wait - we're talking 6pm or 10:30pm...After missing my friends by 10 minutes the other day, I had to skip out on a dinner with them because they would only seat folks that were already there. When we asked if she could take away some ramen for me, they said we had to bring our own container. Sad :(

The menu is still a bit limited and the chicken in my soup scared me a bit, but overall - me gusta! (I would say it in Japanese, if only) Came in on a night when it was around 95 degrees still out at like 10.30 and so happen their AC broke, too. Woo hoo to getting off on the best foot ever. Our waitress was very friendly and efficient. Always bringing over water to try and compensate for the heat and always on top of our needs. I had the chicken ramen and thought that it was super delicious even though my chicken looked under cooked. I figured they knew more than me so i took a couple of bites. I am glad that I did. The space is small and cute just like their old location. And to add to it all the clientele followed which i think is a positive sign. Great addition to the neighborhood! Ready to go back, when it cools off.

A zillion points for having a bomb ass vegetarian ramen that's not pork broth based and not an afterthought! The presentation is beautiful- really brimming with colorful veggies that made it clear from the get go that Totto stands behind their veggie ramen. Given that 99.9% of ramen spots focus on having amazing pork and/or chicken broth, most give little to no attention to making an amazing all-vegetarian ramen, which makes trying to get ramen (one of my favorite things to eat ever) with my vegetarian boo a lame outing when they get stuck with lemmemakethisrealquick uninspired shoyu or miso or salt broth ramen. Totto Ramen changed all that! We came here after seeing a B-way show (otherwise, why would we be nearby?!) late at night a few days before the 'Blizzard of 2010'. The large cups of sake we had left no buzz but help extend the internal warmth that the ramen already had going for us. The combo of fresh noodles, simple, focused & limited menu, perfect sizes, and overall freshness definitely puts Totto on the top of the list for NY ramen spots vs. Momofuku/Ippudo/whateverelseusuallycomesin3?rdplace. YUM.

I was still craving ramen after an unfulfilled experience at Donburiya. My Husband finally got out of work at a decent hour so we were excited to grab dinner together. We waited about an hour, and we got there around 8 PM. When we left there were still people waiting outside. We started with the Yaki Uni Don appetizer. There was an unproportional amount of rice to Uni. I wouldn't recommend getting it unless you're really craving some Uni. It's basically a strip of Uni on top of a large bowl of rice. The wasabi is pretty strong so don't eat too much at once. I was really excited about ordering the Totto Spicy Ramen because it was just so delicious last time. I'm sad to report that it didn't hit the spot; for some reason it just didn't taste as good this time. Last time the broth was delicious and it was just the right amount of spicy for me. Also, I added a boiled egg and it was too salty. We sat right at the very end near the fridge and it was exceptionally warm so I guess dress in layers that you can peel off. I really wanted to love Totto Ramen. The chefs are just so friendly and nice. However, based on my experience, I think Ippudo is still better. I've tried Ippudo several times, and it has consistently been delicious.

Damn good chicken-based ramen - for those of us looking for a break from pork. Rice, and raw fish, also quite good. The wait, on another hand is horrendous. Good thing there's a burger joint next door - fries as a while you wait appetiser? Damn straight.

First thing's first - the wait during regular dinner times are about an hour long. We put our names down and we easily waited an hour before we got seated. Luckily the weather kept up and didn't rain on us. We ended up getting the avo tuna appetizer, the Totto Chicken Paitan Ramen, and the Totto Spicy Ramen. I was a bit disappointed with the avo tuna. It's a good concept to have the avocado w/ the tuna in yuzu sauce, but it was way too salty. The tuna also was a bit overcooked. I would've liked it less seared and less marinated. Sadly, I'd have to give it a 2.5 rating. As for the chicken broth, I will give it a 4.5 rating as it was pretty good - both the regular and the spicy broth. The rayu (spicy sesame oil) was a nice compliment to the noodles. The ramen on the other hand I would give it a 3 just because when it got to us, it was undercooked and was still a bit hard and chewy. It got softer as we were nearing the end of our meal. I also thought the pork could be a bit softer so I would give it a 3.5. I'm kind of torn between a 3 or a 4 rating as really I think a 3.5 really fits my opinion of the restaurant however due to the long wait and the less than optimal meal, I'm going to settle with giving it a 3 star rating.

I didn't know Ramen noodles could taste this good! ?actually, forget about the 'ramen' part - best noodles i've ever had, period! ? Miso ramen and the spicy ramen are both amazing. ? I love that they use a chicken base instead of the usual pork. ?This is one of the few restaurants that I will actually wait in line for -- which is the only downside. ?the restaurant is tiny and the lines are incredible. no reservations unfortunately.

Totto Ramen is sooOo good. ?There's been much comparison to Ippudo. ?I prefer Totto Ramen. ?If Ippudo is a bit heavy for you, and it is a bit for me, then you'll love Totto Ramen. ?Lighter, but still completely full on flavor--and bonus Totto Ramen is just a bit cheaper. ? You know when things are basically spicy for the sake of being spicy and not because they taste better that way. ?--This is not that. ? The Totto Spicy Ramen is great. ? And before I forget to mention... The atmosphere of the staff is like a close knit group of friends who are doing their thing and enjoying themselves.

I thought Ippudo was the only ramen place to have a line queued up before opening, but I was wrong. I was among the first group to get in today when the doors opened, but there was a line out the door (and in the snow at that!) before 5 p.m. Before coming here, there was a lot of hype. My wife said it was the best ramen in NYC. I had seen reviews pretty much agreeing to that point, and I'll have to say that they lived up to the hype. I think the char-siu here is the best I've tasted in NYC. The soup is pretty good too (I got the miso ramen). FYI, the place is super tiny. Probably can fit ~20-25 people at one time, hence the line. When you get there, make sure to put your name on the clipboard, as that's how you claim your spot in line.

I'm a fan of real Japanese ramen (not the packaged kind that you can get for a dollar at a super market). It's something I've tasted in abundance from various places and have thoroughly enjoyed time and time again. However, I'm taking the time to write something for Totto Ramen because it really is a step (or two) above the rest. The food is spot on and the menu is very easy to understand; your bowl of ramen will satisfy you in both taste and portion. I'd take away a star for Totto because there is almost ALWAYS a wait time of at least 10 minutes, even during off-peak hours. However, you can't really fault them for that, can you? They've built an enclosed waiting area outside of their door so you can wait there in the winter without getting hypothermia. They've also purchased space heaters for the area so you really can be as comfortable as you can be in the waiting area of a restaurant as small as this. You've got to try the chicken ramen or the spicy ramen. They're both delicious and I tend to switch back and forth between the two. They also have your standard Japanese beers - always a good cold one with the meal. I definitely recommend this place if you have the time to wait. You won't regret it and you will find yourself thinking about it at times when you're hungry.

I heard a lot of good things about this place but left a little disappointed. Maybe it was hyped up too much. The waiting area is outside, so don't go when the line is long. The waiting area also smelled kind of strange, like rotten eggs. It was either from the restaurant or someone (not it) farted in the area. Anyway, the service was pretty speedy. The place seats about 20 people. I read the cheese corn was good, but it's really just melted American cheese (taste like Kraft) on top of corn. And it was cold, which I'm not sure if that was on purpose or not. It looked like it had been sitting somewhere for a very long time. I also had some char sui pork w/ mayo and scallions on top of rice. It was good for the first few bites, but the pork pieces were very chewy and too big, so it was a little difficult to eat. Onto the noodles, the noodles themselves were great. They were cooked al dente and tasted good. I had the spicy ramen and it was good, but not spectacular. A lot was left to be desired in terms of taste. It's mostly pepper and garlic. I probably would hesitate to come back. Ippudo is still way ahead in the ramen game.

The crowds say it all. The first time I discovered this place was walking back from Hell's Kitchen around 9:30pm and having to dodge the giant crowd waiting outside the door. A quick glance inside, I saw a busy bar full of authentic Japanese ramen flavor. It was my goal to make it to this place soon. But that "soon" turned into 2 weeks as it seemed impossible to find a time to go without having to wait for 30+ minutes. Even a rainy Tuesday at 1pm warranted a 40 minute wait for lunch. But today at last I was able to get in. I got the miso ramen and it was delicious - fresh chewy ramen, sizeable pork strips, flavorful ground pork, and a rich broth that I sipped through to the bottom. The cooks - who fix the meals right inside the bar - looked like they were having fun and were catching up with the regulars on the latest happenings of life. As busy as they were, service-wise the person at the door came by at least 3 times to chat with us and give us recommendations and get to know us. She knew it was our first time and suggested menu items for the future. I haven't tried too many ramen spots, but for the fun, casual, authentic atmosphere, the friendly service, and a delicious ramen that lives up to the crowds that beg at its door every hour of every day, I can only give this place 5 stars.

It amazes me that this little hole in the wall has a crowd waiting outside greater than the capacity of the entire place. I've been here twice in the past 2 nights. But in their defense, the wait isn't that bad at all, people are in and out quick. It just looks like a long wait because the space is small. Although with all this recent publicity not sure how long they can keep up the efficiency. I tried the chicken paitan and the miso ramen. I have to say I like the chicken better for the flavor of the broth and also the chicken has the straight home made noodles which I liked better than the wavy noodles in the miso. That said, their broth is on the lighter side compared to other ramen places, but I like that. Less heavy, not as salty. I also tried the broiled char siu pork appetizer on on the bed of veggies. They have the best char siu pork around, and it tastes different when it's not in the broth. Service is quick, the staff is friendly and you don't feel rushed even though there's always people waiting. If you love ramen, you should check this place out.

Went the day after one of our many blizzards this year. ?There was a nice line of folks looking to warm up with a nice bowl of comforting noodles. ?The server said it will only be about 10 minutes... it was closer to 15. ?Considering over 10 people in 4 groups in front of us, they really turn over tables quickly. ? Service is good but as an eatery like this, you don't come expecting great telepathic service. ? The location is really convenient, right in Midtown but I'm probably guessing that there is always at least a short wait here due to the small space and high traffic location. This is not a ramen "restaurant" in the same vein as Ippudo... it's closer to your neighborhood favorite ramen bowl rather than a nice place to take a date. ?But unfortunately, they can't match Ippudo on flavor either. We both ordered the spicy ramen and the noodles I felt were pretty good but the broth didn't quite go that extra step. ?It was still delicious and portions were medium sized (not small like Ippudo). ?I most definitely need to return and try their other ramen flavors. SO you've probably noticed that I keep comparing this place to Ippudo. ?That's because their ramen is the closest I've had to some of the best shops in Osaka. ?Totto, is a good solid choice, and I'd gladly return to try more flavors. ?But it wasn't mind-blowing like some I had in Osaka. ?It's the very same reason why even Ippudo is NOT my ideal ramen shop. ? Totto didn't have gyoza either. ? Considering how they did the spicy ramen, it's at least a little better than Setagaya. ?And that's still pretty darn good.

Some ramen places make their ramens really oily... this place was pretty good. ?They have some good meat ramens, but I ordered the veggie ramen. ?If you like veggies, this is really good. Also had their sea urchin on the side, very good, can't compare it to Japan, but not bad at all! Good for late night snacking!! Careful though, this place is really tiny, so only 4 people a table, if you have more in your party, you WILL BE separated.

I love that the broth is made with chicken. ?Being the flexitarian that I am, I don't eat pork or beef and ramen is traditionally pork based. ?Back home in California, I'd always get the shio ramen (occasionally shoyu) which has a clear broth. ?I always steered clear of the milky soups of ramens that were deemed "the real deal". ?BUT... having lived in NYC for a while now, I figured I needed to start hitting up the restaurant staples. Totto... has a ridic wait. ?Just know before you go. ?If you are the type of person that just makes everyone's life a living hell for no other reason except that you're hungry, then do us all a favor and go elsewhere. ? As for the food, it's alright. ?I think it's just a matter of personal preference but I still miss (and crave) my shio. They DO have some pretty unique flavors going on though. It's worth a try if you're nearby but don't waste your time if you have to travel more than 20 minutes to get here.

My girlfriend and I had lunch here today. Being that it is a rainy, cool and dreary May day, ramen seemed like the perfect food. Totto Ramen opens at noon and we arrived at 12:15 to a line and on a rainy day, no doubt. There's a small bench under their overhang, but that's about all there is to keep dry. Despite the rain, everyone was standing outside, under their umbrellas. That's sign #1 that this place is good - people waiting in the rain. Anyways, we arrived and put our name on the list that's hanging on the door. There were two groups ahead of us - one was a single guy who got up and left and the other was a group of four. We were actually called in next, after waiting only 20 minutes. During our wait tho, we couldn't help notice that the majority of the people waiting to eat were Asian. My gf is Korean and noted, due to the languages some of the people were speaking, that a lot of Koreans were waiting to eat here. Sign #2 that this place must be good - a lot of Asians were waiting. There were also a fair amount of Asians inside. Once we were inside and seated, it's a very nice environment. While the shop may be small, it is by no means cramped and you have plenty of room. We weren't able to sit at the bar to watch the ramen prep and torching of the pork, but no worries there. We started off with the Avo Tuna (torched tuna sashimi with avocado) and the Ika-Yaki (skewered and torched squid). Both were yummy. For our soup, I had the Chicken Paitan Ramen, with a hardboiled egg added in, and my gf had the Spicy Ramen. Both were delicious and the noodles were cooked perfectly. The broth was rich and flavorful, while all the accompanying ingredients made the bowl a symphony of flavors. I'd say this place is definitely on par with Ippudo. The prices are a tad more reasonable and you get more pork in your soup, and their pork is more delicious than Ippudo's standard pork (you pay extra for the pork belly at Ippudo, here it was standard). The wait here is much shorter and while you have to wait outside, you often have to wait outside at Ippudo too, since their bar area gets insanely mobbed. Of course, Totto Ramen doesn't have pork buns, chicken wings or a lot of the other yummies that Ippudo has, but Totto is definitely unique in its own way. Totto's broth is a chicken based one, not pork based like Ippudo. However, if that hadn't been pointed out to me, I wouldn't have even realized. If you're looking for delicious ramen in the Hell's Kitchen area or don't want to have to go all the way to the East Village, this is your place!

Ever wonder what cool people do at 3 on a Saturday afternoon? ?They line up to get into Totto Ramen. ?And believe me, there are a lot of cool people in this city trying to fit into a hole in the wall that seats roughly 20. However, the long wait is the only drawback to this near perfection of a ramen restaurant. ?The vibe is great. ?Most people end up seating at the bar where they get a view of the chefs at work. ?This is one of my favorite aspects of the restaurant. ?The chefs love their jobs and occasionally entertain the customers who try to take pictures or order in Japanese. ?The waitresses/ waiters are pleasant too, even if it can be difficult to spot them in the close quarters. I had the Chicken ramen, the first one on the menu, and I have to say that every aspect of it was extremely rich in taste and quality. ?The ramen was tender and the chicken broth was so delicious that I can't even find a word for it. ?Same goes for the char siu pork which they cook with the torch right in front of you. This place rocks, even the cold winter weather can't keep me from lining up outside.

The best true Japanese Ramen place in NY hands down, and I've tried Menkui, Ippudo and many others many times. Waited about 30 minutes at lunch time (worth it!). Order the Miso Ramen for a rich complex flavor that's not overly salty and has great noodles with snap, delicious pork belly char siu. ($10.50) Order the Extra Totto Spicy Ramen for a great tasting complex spicy tasting Ramen that lets you add the spice at your own pace (has peanuts in their spice paste in case you're allergic). ($10.50) You can skip the appetizers like we do and order "KaeDama" another ball of Ramen for only $2.50 to place in that delicious broth! Cash Only, Do it!

The broth is amazing. It's all about the chicken carcass, yeahhh buddy. I can understand people who like the more traditional pork based broth (grease monkeys!) of other shops, but the cleaner finish of this feels more refreshing and you can almost trick yourself into thinking there is anything remotely healthy about what you're consuming. Bamboo shoots are hardly vegetables, my friend. (Shut up about high manganese, you tart. Also, MANGAnese? Really bamboo shoots?) The noodles are also perfect. Tender, but enough bite that they don't become soggy. The char siu is also quite good. The slicing is sometimes inconsistent, but when the guy with the knife and blowtorch is in the kitchen moving like Jagger, you'll take what you can get consistency wise. And it's never to the point of ridiculousness; you won't be getting a massive slab of pork (not that everyone would hate that), rather a few uneven slices. Chances are, after waiting outside in the rain for 45 minutes (why does it rain every damn time you go here?) the last thing you're going to care about is uneven pork slices. That said, if you want spicier ramen, this might not be the place for you. A chicken broth is a bit more delicate than a richer pork broth, and as such, the predominate spice is black pepper, which will never generate the heat of more exotic chilies. The girl I went with likes to cry from the heat of her ramen, and when she received her extra extra spicy (the real name of the heat level escapes me) she took two spoonfuls and laughed, reaching for the sriracha. As much as I love The Oatmeal, adding mountains of sriracha to this ramen would kill it. Seriously, go elsewhere. Or just eat food that doesn't burn through your insides. Lastly: beware all you neko-jita out there; this shit comes out hot! That's the closest thing to another complaint that I could come up with. Ramen is supposed to be hot, so it isn't even a valid complaint. If, like me, you can't handle hot liquids, fight your baser instinct to guzzle the contents of the bowl and let it cool for a minute. If you don't mind waiting (something true of most ramen shops in midtown anyway) and are in the area, go for it. Just don't come in a big group. I don't think groups over four are even allowed anymore, and coming with even three people is asking for trouble. This place is best friend only material.

I was torn between two and three stars for this. I wanted to like it more than I did, but I have definitely had better ramen before. ?On the other hand, that attitude is largely based on my recent trip to Japan so maybe I am biased. I had the spicy ramen and my husband had the chicken. ?We both agreed that, although the broth was good, its hard to compare chicken to pork. ?Also,the servings could have been bigger. ?However, a bigger bowl would have made the relatively small number of components more apparent. ?The roasted seaweed, green onions, and dried scallop were good, but I think of the most exciting things about eating ramen is the toppings and there weren't too many of them (Please add quail eggs!!!). ?The noodles were not fresh, either, which was kind of a disappointment. Also, perhaps the most embarrassing thing, is that I heard the couple next to me ask for togarashi but there was none to be had. ? So I hope Totto can pull it together quick, because I would really love to have a decent ramen spot in my neighborhood.

If you are reading this for a quick check on price-value-quality or a fast "what-should-I-eat-the-waiter-is-coming!", I'd say you are neither wasting wallet or stomach contents by coming here, and go for the Chicken Paitan Ramen, with the added Seasoned Avocado if you are so inclined. Read on for a longer review, stacks Totto against one of the best ramen of all of NYC - Ippudo. Totto Ramen (by the same people at Yakitori Totto on Broadway and 55th, reviewed) does not disappoint. On its own I would give it 4-5 stars, but head-to-head versus Ippudo (also reviewed) it loses out on several dimensions. Let's break it down: 1) Wait time: My dining companion and I arrived on a Sat 9pm, and waited about 45 mins. Put your name on the clipboard dangling on the door and when space opens up, someone comes out to call your name. This compares to about an average 1.5 hours wait at Ippudo. But at Ippudo you can go to the bookstore nearby, or wait at the bar to kill your time and liver. Not here, you gotta suffer on the steps in the cold outside. Verdict = Draw 2) Seating capacity: I counted 20 seats all in. Don't come here with groups of more than 4, you will have to disown your lesser friends. Versus Ippudo which seats easily more than 100, verdict = Ippudo 3) Broth: Who cares about how long you wait or that the place smaller than a dorm room, if the broth is good? In this regard Totto holds its ground. Ippudo does a thicker creamer style broth, as it is pork-based. Totto is chicken-based (so we aren't really comparing apples to apples here), hence a lighter texture and smoother style. The broth bubbles in a large metal cauldron, with sandbags of what I assume contains chicken+other secret ingredients hooked on the side. Verdict = Draw 4) Ramen: No fight, my humble $0.02 says Ippudo has the better noodles. Both are soft yet with body, separate beautifully in the soup and don't become bloated by the end of the meal (a sign that the ramen absorbed the broth quickly and hence was overly dried, like what you get with instant noodles). I feel Ippudo just has theirs a shade better. ?But we are really splitting hairs of ramen here, you won't tell the difference in a blind taste test. Because I am not blind (except in love), verdict = Ippudo 5) Char Siew (the pork slices): you see one of the cooks painstakingly grilling the char siews with a mini blowtorch, browning them here and sizzling them there. Quite in the genre of Yakitori Totto (see my other review), where they turn and prod the skewers the way you and I handle a newborn. The outcome is meat that is done just right - texture that is neither rubbery (sign of overcooked) or raw (unclean for pork), with the right amount of residual fat, dripping with juices neither too salty or savoury. Verdict = Totto 6) Egg: Fundamental in any good ramen is the egg. I spent hours in my amateur kitchen trying to get that solid-on-the-outside-runny-on-the-inside egg necessary to complement a good ramen. Ippudo does this to perfection, a proper poached egg. Totto does this as a boiled egg. Verdict = Ippudo 7) Price: For the difference in dollars it doesn't make a material difference, but it can add up. For example, the Miso Ramen at Totto is $10; at Ippudo it's $13. 2 pieces of char siew topping cost $2 at Totto; $3 for Ippudo. The egg is $1 at Totto; $2 at Ippudo. In this 10% unemployment economy, every buck counts. Verdict: Totto ? Bottom line: A carnivore may prefer Totto. A purist may demand Ippudo. A New Yorker probably won't give a damn.

Had the most bizarre experience here tonight that will make me never come back. (Not that I would have anyway) Firstly the ramen here is pretty good (which is not the reason for the one star, more on that later). I had the miso ramen which was yummy for a chicken broth based soup. At first it tasted like I was eating chicken soup which I wasn't used to but I adjusted to it after biting into all of the yummy components of the dish. The pork was succulent, the egg was fully cooked (some say it should be runny), and the noodles were good. The broth was a little too salty to me. I'd say the best part of the dish were the noodles, they had the perfect level of chewiness and nice yellow color. My friend who is averse to pork had the same dish with chicken instead and it was not nearly as good. The chicken had that leftover chicken taste and was dry. ?Was the ramen good, yes, was it better than any run of the mill ramen place on Saint Marks or anywhere else, no. It definitely didn't hold a candle to Ippudo. So here is why I'm giving this place a one star, after I paid and left, an employee ran out of the store and tried to force me to give a bigger tip in front of the crowd of people waiting outside. Maybe this was some sort of triumph for waiters everywhere but I found this extremely unprofessional and ridiculous. Admittedly, I left a bad tip. However, I think my tip was justified. After waiting for an hour we were finally bustled in and sat down. Oh, I forgot to mention they don't take cash so I had to run around the corner to the bank and take out money (with all the hype and business they get they can't upgrade allow credit?) There was water in cups already at our table. We ordered the food and when it was ready, some guy who wasn't our waiter quickly plopped my dish in front of me with his thumb almost in the ramen. I thought he was someone who just came into eat because he had a winter jacket and hat on then I realized he worked there. He yelled miso ramen in my ear and I asked him if it was the chicken or pork because my friend and I ordered both and he just yelled "miso ramen" again. Luckily another guy (I think our waiter?) had the next dish and said that's the pork and this is the chicken and more carefully placed it down. During the duration of our meal our water was not refilled. After we finished our bowls were quickly taken away and they laid down the check. I left my usual tip of just doubling the tax but then as I was putting on my jacket I realized they didn't even do anything. We waited for an hour in the cold only to be rushed in and have our food thrown down at us and be rushed out. So I subtracted a dollar from my tip bringing it down to an admittedly bad tip of around 12-13 percent. After we left someone who wasn't our waiter ran up to my friend and I (in front of the crowd of people waiting) and said something about how the tip was too low and he showed me the bill. I asked him if there was anything on the receipt or menu about a mandatory tip and he said no but in New York you usually double the tax and leave atleast 17-18 percent. I should have went off on him about how I'm from New York and the service sucked and I'm within my right to leave a crappy tip but I was so shocked I just said no and I didn't think the service was good. He gave me an evil look and walked away. Was I a jerk for leaving a bad tip, maybe, but I thought the service was bad and I'm within my right to leave a bad tip. I don't go around leaving bad tips everywhere. I leave a standard tip of doubling the tax and rounding up and I leave even more if the service was great. If you are a waiter you should ask yourself why the person is leaving you a bad tip instead of going outside and hounding them down for a dollar. Screw this place, the ramen is run of the mill and the employees are weirdos who don't understand the tipping system. **Also, I just read this place has a C rating in the other comments! Might not have even tried it if I knew that. Maybe health inspectors don't like it when you are hauling in bags of eggs from the grocery store and dropping the cartons all on the floor. Yes, I witnessed this while I was eating. If you read the other reviews here I think you'll find a pattern of poor hygiene and sanitation at this place.

Their soup is GREAT !!! I am a ramen fan but never ever had any soup this good. (more delicious than Ippudo) We went there at 3 PM and waited for 15- 20 minutes. (it was their slowest time. and do not try to come in a big group. They can accommodate only 4 people top.)

Niku ramen, btw, has curly noodles as opposed to the straight noodles in the other ramens. Niku ramen - chewy, fatty, flavorful, lightly sweetened chunks of pork and smoky char siu in smelly (in a good way) broth with springy noodles. All yours for $16+tip. Veg ramen - the broth is surprisingly fragrant with sesame oil; it looked a bit watery in the beginning so I was pleasantly surprised. All the vegetables, esp the tofu, go really well with the salty fragrant broth, and once you mix in the yuzu paste this bowl is a revelation. Basic ramen - just really good! I would add an egg and some scallion to it. Maybe some menma.

Holy crap. Easily one of the BEST MEALS I had in the city! I've been eating ramen (of the instant variety) since I was old enough to hold a pair of chopsticks. I love ramen, and have eaten it at several other nyc eateries, but this place takes the cake. Coming in - this place opens at noon for lunch, but you better get over there about an hour in advance just to line up.... usually there are about 20 - 30 people (and the restaurant seats less than that) at any given moment waiting to go in. You sign in the size of your party on a clipboard hung on the door, and you (and your entire party) best be there when they call you cause if you're not, then you're automatically tacked onto the end of the list. Onto the ramen: I was excited because they offer a vegetarian choice - other ramen places do not do this. They have the regular vegetarian ramen, and a spicy version - well, since I LOVE spicy, I opted for the regular ramen, with a side of their special spicy sauce... Holy cow, the stuff is hot! But is WELL WORTH IT, I think it brought out all the flavours together even better. The other ramen, with pork, was reported by my friends to be divine. They use a flame torcher to cook the pork right in front of you (that is, if you are lucky enough to sit at the bar!) In all, great experience. The staff is very friendly, and as I said, if you are lucky enough to sit at the bar, you will be further entertained by the native Japanese chefs... they'll ask you all sorts of questions, and even pose crazy in your pictures for you!

Damn. This place is good. The wait is not too long. Quick tip, you can literally put your name on the list, grab a drink at Bamboo 52, and come back for the yumminess that awaits. And if they skip over you because you stayed a little too long at Bamboo, you're simply just next in line ; ). The miso ramen was perfect on a cold evening. I couldn't wait to dig in to the warm goodness in my bowl. One sip of the broth. Magic. One bite of the pork. I wanted to melt. One slurp of the ramen. Is it possible to marry food? The broth is so good that you honestly don't even need to use all of the miso. I only used about half, and was able to appreciate the chicken flavor as well as get a hint of sweetness and some thickening from the paste. The pork had a perfect combo of lean meat to fatty goodness. The meat was so, so, so tender and flavorful. One bite and the texture hit me like an explosion of stars and rainbows and sunshine. It literally melts upon contact with your tongue, and somehow infiltrates into your tastebuds to give you a high that makes you feel like you are melting along with the meat into fantasy land. You just want to stay all night and eat this stuff. The only way I can describe it is.. think Salvador Dali's Persistence of Memory. I am that melting pocketwatch. Dilapidated. Melted. High, in a state of unconscious (bliss). So surreal. But then you wake up because of the rush of the server and the throngs of jealous next-in-liners outside in the cold. Somehow the nice Japanese atmosphere makes you feel bad for them and you eat quickly so they can experience fantasyland as well. The ramen. Ohh man do they have this al dente biznass DOWN. You can you learn a lot about the art of noodles from Totto. No wonder Marco Polo brought pasta as part of his Best of Asia package to Italy. (I don't think he went to Japan, but still, Asians can share the credit amongst our kind) When we do it right, we do it RIGHT. ?Obeyed the legislation of food and finished the night with no carb left behind. Delish.

the food and price are five-star worthy, but the wait and the ambiance knock a star off the overall experience. maybe it was the over-an-hour wait that made me hungry, but when i finally got that bowl of ramen it tasted SO good, possibly the best ramen i've ever had (though i wasn't starving before I had all the others, may not be a fair comparison). we tried the spicy ramen with pork, and the niku ramen. both were great. flavorful soup, generous portions, if it weren't for the miserable line i'd definitely come here more often.

I'm going to keep this short and sweet: -Expect to wait 20-30 min if you get there after 6:30pm (worth it) -Order any ramen, they alll good. Had the spicy ramen with pork... yummmm -Cash only, but it's not overpriced, easy under $30 (with no drinks) -Tiny, recommend for 2 people, not a big group If you are looking to go with a big group, I suggest Hide Chan on the east side, it has more seating room, but I still like totto better.

I admit, I had a mini debate with myself for this one. Four stars? or Five? Totto Ramen has been open for a grand total of two days. And on the 2nd night, there was an hour wait for dinner at 8pm. If that's not an indication of good things to come, I don't know what is. So my friend and I waited for 1 hour to be seated at this small 12 seater joint. 5 ramen options.. PERFECT. Not to be discriminant or offense at all, but the fact that the waiters barely spoke english was a really, really good sign. My waiter didn't ?understand me when I asked him where the restroom was, but I figured it out. haha. So let's review: we have authentic Japanese waiters, authentic ramen bar seating, and an authentic menu - all great signs. Now, I wouldn't consider myself a ramen expert, but I have had the privilege of eating at a few of the top ramen places in NYC (setagaya, ippudo, momofuku noodle) So, I'm not a complete noob. I would say that the broth at totto was THE best I've had in NY - it blew my mind. I officially had a MIND = BLOWN moment. The noodles were also perfectly cooked -bouncy, chew, firm, and not in the least bit soggy. I inhaled the noodles, toppings, soup, EVERYTHING. By the end of my meal, I could've worn my bowl as hat. I will be back many, many times. This love affair has only just begun.

Surprisingly rich for a chicken-based broth. Still doesn't beat Ippudo NY's tonkotsu, but the noodles and chashu pork are definitely better. The latter is singed with a blowtorch before being dropped in your bowl. The place is teensy and popular, so go alone on a weekday afternoon if you can -- I arrived at 2 PM on a Thursday and was almost immediately seated. The atmosphere is one of the best I've encountered on my ramen forays, and the guys behind the counter are as efficient as they are friendly.

DELISH! ? First, the place - I will agree that it's very small but totally has the correct ramen house feel with a bar where you can sit, eat and watch the cooks cook! ?I wouldn't recommend coming here with a crowd bigger than 4 people. ?The service was great and all the waiters were really friendly and didn't rush us at all. Now, the food - Broiled char siu pork appetizer - nothing to write home about but good (NOTE: ?I'm not a fan of the fatty portion of pork belly so perhaps my opinion is skewed on this one) Avo tuna appetizer - fresh and refreshing! ?The tuna was of really good quality and the yuzu garlic sauce was light and was not overpowering. ?Totally recommend if you like seared tuna. Spicy ramen - soooo hearty and delicious! The broth is not like any I've had before... ?At first taste, I didn't like it because I didn't expect it to be so rich, but with the second bite to the last bite, I thought it was so savory and straight YUM! ?The noodles' consistency was also very good. ?Warning: ?you WILL be full ENJOY!

Imagine a small, enclosed area the size of a one-car garage. Stick in three tall boys behind a bar furiously cooking noodles, flamethrowing pieces of pork belly, and spooning soup. Add four wooden tables in the back and a load of people on stools bent over bowls and you've got Totto Ramen. It's cramped, it's hot (thank God they have working AC now), but DAAAYUM it's good noodles!!! I love the chicken ramen, especially with additional orders of hard boiled egg, pork belly pieces, and SEASONED AVOCADO (don't worry, I don't order them all at once -- usually). No matter that avocado sounds a little weird with a bowl of steaming noodle soup; it's actually surprisingly delicious. Order it for $1 more, and I promise you won't regret it!

We were there after watching The Book of Mormon, on a rainy chilly evening, and still it was a 45 min wait. Well, what can you do when there are as many greeds as you in this city. appetizer - Yaki ika (grilled squid). Please do yourself a favor and order it! ..perfect pieces of squid lightly torched..served with some sauce and scallions. lovely, especially if you love squid like I do despite it causing your cholesterol to shoot skyhigh. $2 per skewer!! order it...pleaseeeee! When I saw this yaki uni don dish written at the door while waiting, I know I need to try it even though we are there for the ramen. They seasoned the rice, topped with cucumbers and seaweed, and a slab of uni. Then they torched it. OMG. So so so delish. Sweetness of the uni that carries a little smokiness from the fire. And all for another $5. Heavenly! I had the traditional paitan ramen on my first visit 2 weeks ago, and this time, I had the spicy. Love both, but I have to say I love the spicy one a little more. Think that will be my choice on my next visit. I live downtown in the east village where you're surrounded by too many japanese ramen places, famous and mediocre. But I wish Totto Ramen is here!

As others have mentioned, this place takes no reservations and is about the size of a phone booth. On any given night, there are at least 10 people waiting outside to be seated. On the three occasions i've been here, we had to wait 45min to an 1hr 30min to be seated. But the food is worth the wait. The menu is tiny, probably about 4 types of ramen, 3 appetizers, and an assortment of toppings for the ramen. The Yaki Uni Don is excellent with that charred sea urchin flavor contrasting nicely with the kombu and sitcky rice. Ive had the spicy ramen (the mild one) and the meat lovers ramen before, both times with extra noodles (the damn wait gives you hungry eyes when ordering). The portion size is large. The broth is milky and rich although i prefer the Ippudo pork broth better. The hand made noodles are firm and have just the right consistency that the noodles are enjoyable all the way though til the end of the bowl. The Char-siu pork topping is done right - the meat is tender and has the proper sweetness level to it. The food here is a 5, it loses a star due to the ridiculously tiny tables and long waits.

This little ramen place was so packed at 11:00pm so we thought their ramen must be good. And surely it WAS amazing!! first time having Paitan ramen. Their noodles were harder than other ramen places. They were perfectly al dente. The broth was awesome! The thickness of it was just perfect. Chashu... OMG. It was THE best I have ever had. ra-musubi was so so. It was too spicy.

Apart from the long wait (if you are those New Yorkers who will brave the cold just to wait for a good bowl of Ramen), the Ramen here is solid. My usual is the extremely spicy Ramen which can warm your soul and burn your colon at the same time. It hurts so good as they say it. The atmosphere is quaint, not too much drama, and the food is cheap. Yes, despite the popularity and long wait for a bowl of noodle, we will be back for more.

I was really disappointed by my meal last evening at Totto Ramen. My husband got the chicken ramen (which he thought was just ok) and I got the Spicy Ramen. The broth is tasty, but just WAY too oily for my liking. I know Ramen is a high fat item, so I'm not looking for diet food, but there was just way too much oil and fat in the bowl. By the end I was starting to feel nauseated. I will say that the pork was well cooked and the noodles were awesome. Unfortunately, I woke up at 2 am and started throwing up. ?My husband was also stomach sick this morning (more minor than mine, but he said he'd felt ill after eating it). ?I think something in what we ate made us sick because we both feel ok now. Either way, we will not be returning, as merely thinking about the soup is bringing back the queasiness.

A lot of reviewers are comparing this place to Ippudo, and I have to say that the comparisons are justified. ?Admittedly, it's been awhile since I've been to Ippudo, and the half-life of my tongue's culinary recall is on the order of mere days, but it's hard to imagine it being much better than Totto. We walked in at 7:30, narrowly beating the crowd an a hot July weeknight. ?Seated immediately in one of five tables in the back. ?Prompt, attentive service by congenitally polite Japanese waiters. ?Atmosphere is appropriately no-frills. Appetizers: Tasty, crunchy bamboo shoots dressed with just the right amount of spicy mayo. ?Good, but simple and not particularly memorable. ?Blowtorch-seared charsiu pork. ?Cooked to perfection, flavorful, with just the right amount of fat. ?The dish ends up being redundant, though, since their ramen showcases the same exact slices of swine. On to the ramen. ?We had the paitan and spicy ramen. ?The paitan broth was intensely chicken-y, but opaque, substantial, and delicious. ?The spicy broth was(I think) the paitan broth with spicy sesame oil for some heat. ?The nest of toothsome noodles were cooked perfectly al dente. ?The other toppings were pretty standard stuff--except the pork which, as described above, was exceptional. ?You can add specific toppings (egg, spicy bamboo, cheese corn, etc) a la carte if you so choose. ?If you're still hungry after your first bowl, order up kaedama to get an extra serving of noodles to go with any leftover broth. Overall a great meal. ? I'm starting to realize that all these Totto establishments (Yakitori, Soba, et al) are uniformly stellar. ? I'm fortunate to live so close to this place. ?Will definitely be back.

Just finished my bowl of Miso Ramen. The broth was excellent! I don't think it could've been much better. The char siu (pork belly) wasn't prepared in a way that I cared for too much, however. The noodles were a little more al dente than I prefer, but not a big deal. The fiance had the spicy ramen, which was good, but I'm not a big fan of the sichuan spicy flavor. Overall, these noodles are still great, and I would highly recommend. But make sure you sign the list on the door, as it serves as the wait list in lieu of a line. Edit: As a comparison, I just had the Momofuku ramen and it doesn't even compare to Totto's. However, the pork belly there was the best I ever had. Totto is definitely in my top two (Ippudo).

Like many of the posters here, I'm reluctant to give this place 5 stars because of the incredible routine that one must endure to actually get a bowl of ramen here. ?The best-case scenario is getting there before 11:45 on weekdays for lunch and waiting for 20 minutes to get seated. That said, the spicy totto ramen is very, very good. ?The deeply flavored chicken paitan broth mixed with the spicy-garlic paste is an incredible combination, which the bitey noodles complement perfectly. ?In my book it's worth the trouble. Instituting a reservation system, at least for larger parties, seems to be a great idea that no ramen shop even considers. ?It's as if they are sticking to the tradition of making people suffer for tradition's sake. ?It's not like they would require a large amount of staff to accomplish this, they already need one member of the staff to basically manage the chaos of the clipboard. ?I would much rather know that I'm not going to be able to get a table over the phone, than have to walk over to the restaurant and have to deduce that for myself. ?Nobody answers the phone, you literally have to walk over to the restaurant.

Came after hearing all the hype, waited nearly an hour on a Sunday at 5pm. ?We had the unni-don, tuna-avocado appetizer, spicy totto ramen (with chicken) and paitan ramen (with pork). ?The spicy ramen was overly peppery (i.e. black pepper), and it should be noted Totto uses a chicken-based broth (hence the chicken in their logo) as opposed to the classic pork-based one (a la ippudo). ?I personally prefer the patter, as it is richer and more flavorful, and the pork/char siu offered at Totto are thin slices that have been broiled separately. ?Noodles are just average. ?Good option for ramen in midtown, but wouldn't say stellar otherwise.

I'm not usually fan of ramen, but I really enjoyed this place! My friends lived super close to here so my boyfriend stopped here to try it out since we have heard a lot of great things. We had to wait about 45 mins to get a table on a Friday afternoon. We got the spicy ramen and the miso ramen. I def. preferred the spicy ramen--it had better/more flavor and the noodles were perfect! Miso ramen was good but it wasn't as flavorful as I wanted to be. Service is okay. Took a while to get our check but we were in and out in about 45-1 hr.

It was really good but we had to wait FOREVER. If the line wasn't so long I would probably come here all the time. The food was very fast and tasty with the noodles being particularly well made. The soup is full of flavor that made me super happy. Definitely check this place out but be prepared to wait. At least its worth it.

Ramen is decent but not worth the wait; three other places are better Okay: * Broth is not bad but not great as it's based on chicken and not pork * Chashu pork appetizer is a little better than the ramen pork as you get more of the char. Negatives: * Pork is too fatty * Wavy noodles are a little too hard for my preference * Wait is too long, about 40min. Ippudo's wait can be just as long but it is worth it. There are only 5 tables for 2 people each and 8 bar seats, would not recommend parties above 2 people.

This phenomena of waiting hours for this bowl of yumminess is really getting to me. They claim that if you put your name on the board, the wait will be very fast and soon, you will be slurping on bowls of heaven. Lets see, well every time I walk by there is always a line. Whether it is 95 degrees and steam bath like or 10 degrees there is somehow a wait of at least 30 minutes. Flash foward to one magical Monday evening, while I was walking home ( I live down the block from here), there WAS NO LINE. The NCAA basketball championship game was taking place that night. Hehehe finally a day with no line. Inside, the place is very narrow and cramped. At most 20 seats. It feels like your eating in the middle of a cramped back alley in Osaka due to the dim lights and the sub street level location. Ordered the Totto Paitan Ramen with Extra noodles along with an Egg and the instant I slurped the noodles, the amount of chicken and pork fat I injected into my soul was just simply amazing. The broth was heavily rich, very porky and very savory. ?Not only that, It was also pretty spicy too but not as spicy as the 10 CHILI PEPPER totto spicy Ramen. The feeling after eating this bowl of Ramen was also very good since I didn't fall asleep but knowing next time, If I order 2 bowls of Ramen, who knows what the result would be...

I love Ramen. Plain and simple. The fact I chose to capitalize Ramen is how ridiculous my level of infatuation is for the food. I have been to Totto enough times and tried most of the menu to where I can safely say I love their restaurant. Sure, the decor is dingy but it adds to the charm of the Hell's kitchen Ramen shop. Their broth and soup is so flavorful and tasty that after devouring the noodles, I always slurp down the bowl. Their portions are enormous. I rarely am able to pay the extra 2.50 for the noodles. The 1-2 hours waits are well worth it for what is in my humble opinion the best Ramen restaurant in NYC. Ippudo may have the decor and the nicer appetizers but they do not match the flavor and taste of Totto's Ramen noodles. What I usually get is the Miso Ramen- the flagship of the Totto empire. Their Char Su pork is delicious and I love how they flame broil it. If you want to avoid the lines- I have discovered there are generally two lull times- right before the dinner rush- 5pm-6pm: rarely a wait and 11pm-12pm: no wait. In case you have weird dinner/Ramen craving cycles like I do.

So...I don't really get it. The noodles were a great consistency, and I liked the scoop of seasoned, minced pork. But overall, I didn't think the flavor was that amazing. The char siu and the broth were both a bit too bland for my taste. And the spicy ramen is spicy, but not quite in that Asian ramen spice way. The pork broth is almost too fatty, which would be fine if there was something to cut through the fat, but overall...again bland. Miso broth was a little better, but I've definitely had better miso. I don't know, there's nothing really wrong with it, but I wasn't overly impressed.

One of the best ramen shop in the city. The ramen soup is sooo delicious. It is doesn't get very salty after you are half bowl through like other ramen places. The soup taste lingers in your mouth. It is so good. Be sure to try the extra spicy ramen soup. The spicy sauce comes on the side (you can get more sauce if you want). Spicy sauce doesn't spiced and numb you right off the bat. When you take a zip it the spicy taste slowly goes stronger. It is so good!! The only downside is that place is small so it is not good for group. Ramen doesn't come with everything you may expect from ramen soup, they available as topping addons however the ramen taste great even without additional toppings Definitely coming back and try the spicy bamboo shoot that was recommended by the friendly chef.

this place opens at 12, and we got here at 12.20 thinking it'd be a good enough time to beat the rush. boy were we wrong. we still had to wait an hour to eat here. part of it is because this place is SO tiny - only 2 2-tops, 2 4-tops, and then about 12 ?seats at the counter. coming in a group of 2 is probably the best way to go and the shortest wait. we had a group of 4 that made it very hard to get a table. i ordered the spicy totto ramen (comes with pork, nori seaweed, and scallions) and i ordered corn, mushrooms, and spicy bamboo. total came to 13.75 for this bowl. the noodles were cooked to perfection, and the contrast in the topping textures really made this dish awesome. the spicy bamboo is SPICY. spicier than their "extra spicy totto ramen" sauce, so if you want that extra kick, just get the spicy bamboo. we also ordered the pork chunks which were amazing. so tender and sweet. my one suggestion would be to cut the nori seaweed into smaller pieces or strips. while the presentation might be kinda nice, its hard to eat. be prepared to wait in line, but its worth the wait. WAY better than ippudo in terms of broth flavor. also - CASH ONLY!

Overrated. ? ? ?Period. ? ? Sorry; I had many ramen in my life, both here in US and in various cities in Japan, perhaps my expectation is a bit higher for ramen, especially after all the hype in the reviews. ?But geez, was I royally disappointed; the type of ramen is probably closer to Chinese noodles than Japanese ramen, and the supposedly nice broth was overpowered by the huge dump of miso. ?Save your $16 dollars after tax+tips for something more fulfilling and deserving! ?I believed other yelpers actually enjoyed the ramen, but if the kind of ramen you had in Kobe or Osaka is your thing, you'd better go elsewhere. ?Happy yelping!

!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!Ramen is AMMMMAAAAAAAAZING!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! ....I must say. I have been to Totto Ramen a couple of times and it ?definitely never disappoints. Although, perhaps the wait line will set you off just a little, only if you are an impatient person like myself...but the ramen here is so good that the line didn't bother me that much. Which is surprising!! The last time I went was on a Wednesday night and it was raining pretty hard... just absolutely horrible weather. It was around 10:20pm and when my friend asked if they were still taking reservations, the waiter said no(they close at 11pm on a Wednesday). Which was obviously a bummer. My friend reeeeealllly wanted ramen and so did I, so we waited around to ask again. I asked a different waiter after the majority of guests that were waiting were seated. I said ?" Can you please seat us, we are only two guests...and we are just going to order one bowl of ramen... tip you well!!!!"He was SUPER DUPER nice and he said okay!!! YAAYYYY!!! Both times I have eaten here I shared a bowl of Vegetable Ramen and the Avo Tuna. Both are extremely delicious and worth giving a try!!! I love love love ?tuna sashimi, and the Avo Tuna is just ?delightful and refreshing. It is torched tuna sashimi and avacado marinated in special garlic sauce. YUMMM:) The ramen will make you ?break a sweat!!! Ohhh the sweaty goodness dripping down your face...Especially if it is a warm day and you sit at the bar. The ramen is a pretty good portion and it comes with 4 to 5 different toppings (avacado,cauliflower,mushrooms etc...) Broth is light but tasty!!! FYI seating is very limited and menu is not extensive....

I'm not a ramen professional, but this was a great find! I loved the atmosphere where we could watch the ramen being prepared behind the bar, and even chat with the chefs when they had a spare moment. The place prepares their pork belly with a blowtorch, which I had never seen before--maybe they do this everywhere, and I just didn't know? Anyhow, very cool to watch. I had the spicy totto ramen, which was their original chicken with a spicy oil added to the base. It comes with pork, nori, bean sprouts and scallions. I also got the spicy bamboo shoots which were pretty killer! My friends and I got there around 5:30 on a Tuesday night and didn't have to wait very long at all. They added a nice entryway where people can sit and stay out of the rain during the wait time. Cash only, and be prepared for a wait! There was definitely one by the time we left the restaurant.

I've been here 4x now and without a doubt the ramen here is outstanding. ? Excellent chicken broth and noodles. ?This small ramen joint has a authentic Japanese feel to it. ?The base chicken broth is so rich and delicious. ?The flavors are so deep and complex. ?I'm in heaven when I am here. ?Don't bother with the spicy broth, it interferes with the lovely chicken flavors. ?Haven't tried the miso. ? Ippudo and Totto Ramen are the best in NYC.

So i lined up here on sunday at 4:45 with all the other delicious Ramen seekers. ?There was a wait immediately so be advised. ?However i was not totally dissapointed in my choice, but agree with a lot of the reviews. ?It was fun to sit and watch the chefs stirring the vats of broth with huge ladles and chopping the chicken and throwing the pieces into the wafting boiling cauldrans. ? With them in their costumes it was like watching magic being performed. ?And while I enjoyed my food I have a few complaints. ? They are a little inefficient (but they've only been open a few days) and the menu is not fully executed right now. ?The ramen was tasty, the broth was very flavorful and overly salty. ?i got the organic veggie and my friend the spicy veggie. ?Her's was a little greasy on top because the spicy comes from the spicy oil. ?The service was strange. ?I say that because no one actually came to get our order we had to flag someone down and when we did she didn't speak English. ?She went to find someone who did and thats when we got our order in, but the water was refilled frequently. ?There is also the sing songy hello and goodbye as a traditional Ramen shop which is nice, not nearly annoying as at Ippudo too! ? After the fact, I wanted something a little more substantial however. ?If you want more meat and protein get the miso. ?It has pork and an egg in it. ?It looked really good. ?Otherwise the organic ramen is meatless and quite light! ?So if you are looking for a big bowl of something filling this really isn't the place, I'd go to nearby Sopporo for that. ?Totto ramen seems to be a little more focused on pardon the expression when referring to ramen but "haute." My last complaint...the prices are a little high for the amount as well. ?It is $12 for the Ramen. ?But like I said i think the focus is more on presentation and quality rather than a filling meal.

The chopsticks here are fantastic. ?Beautiful, well balanced, textured at the end for easy noodle grabbing. ?Right from the start it is obvious: ?Totto cares about the details. ? I can't say as much about the other options, but the Miso ramen is beautiful. ?I don't think I even realized how badly I wanted delicate broth until I tried Totto's miso ramen. ?Really just a joy to eat and now instantly a staple in my ramen rotation. ?The noodles are tasty, the interior is cozy, and the staff are so friendly. ?They lose one star because they don't manage the temperature inside (it is hot out, make it cold inside so I can eat your ramen!). ?But the quality of that miso broth rockets Totto up just below Naruto and well above Ippudo. Think for yourself, try Totto, taste the quality, don't let other people tell you that you like Ippudo. ?Also, note the irony in me telling you not to let other people tell you what to think.... but it is ok, because I am more right-er

We came here on a Wednesday night. It's 10pm, still hot as anything outside, but we were up for some ramen, and didn't want to travel all the way to East Village for noodle goodness. Luckily when we arrived, there were two seats available near the door, and near the fan! Thus, whilst slurping our noodles, we were cool as cucumbers. My experience at this ramen stand reminded me for some reason an old episode of Hard Gay (http://www.youtube.com/w…). Hooo~! Could it be because I ordered the spicy ramen? There are two levels: the "mild" spicy, which is 2 peppers, and the super spicy, which is 10 peppers. I ordered the 2 pepper variety, only because I like my spicy food to have a bit of heat, not a numb-your-tongue-sweating-your-balls type of spicy. Despite having a chicken broth base, the soup was very flavorful, and may lead me to take back all the shit I've ever said about chicken pho. Not sure what peppers they used, but I ate one and it was sweet, kind of like ancho chilies. My boyfriend ordered the miso ramen. He said it was very good, but he prefers the texture of the noodles at Ippudo better. Our total for two bowls of ramen totaled to $20.50 with tax. Service was friendly and quick. The space looks like it seats about 15, including a few tables in the back of the restaurant. Please note: this establishment is cash only.

Totto Ramen is great. So great in fact, that there is ALWAYS a crowd of people waiting outside. The place is small and can accomodate about 20 people at a time. You can easily wait 30 mins on a random night for 2 people, or 1hour on a saturday night for a party of 3. ?I suggest coming in during off-peak hours, or dragging a friend to wait with you. BUT It is worth the wait!! Unlike most ramen, I didn't find the broth too salty, and didn't feel bloated or sick after finishing my bowl... it was just right. The char siu pork inside (and the appetizer of pork) is cooked to perfection and delicious. ?I have gotten the miso ramen both times I went here, and I love that they put a scoop of miso on top of your bowl so you can mix in however much you desire. The portions are definitely filling and toppings are abundant too! Did I mention the staff is sooo friendly? Even though there are tons of people outside, they won't rush you and always greet you with a smile. The food comes out extremely quickly! (and made right in front of you!) Minus one star because the extremely extreme spicy ramen was not that spicy!? That's unfortunate.

tried the miso ramen, the broth was thick and not too salty, very agreeable to my taste. They put a scoop of miso on top so you can mix it yourself. I saw the vegetable ramen other people ordered, looked very funny, maybe i'll try next time, although the noodles seem not enough though... also saw one of the chefs was checking the broth. He dripped some broth in a pipe and looked at it like we used to look at microscope in bio labs...

My favorite lunching spot when I get out of my class at 12:30. ?Have come to expect a wait to get into this tiny little place. ?But it's totally worth it. ? Usually get the Totto Spicy Ramen - With egg... And extra pork... It's spicy enough so that you taste the heat, but not so much that it over powers the other flavors... You can still taste the chicken broth, and the pork... the delicious delicious pork... And the veg... ?They also add some Nori in your bowl - I don't know if Nori is traditionally tossed into ramen, but I like it. Oh! and the noodles aren't overcooked and chewy - They cook them to an Al Dente texture. I'm drooling just thinking about this place.

Heading to Opening Night for the Metropolitan Opera and it was raining like cats & dogs. Ramen was definitely what I needed. My girlfriend, who's Japanese, recommended going here. Whenever it has to do with Japanese cuisine and she suggests it... I am all in! We rolled up and had to put our name on a list, but were seated within 5 minutes. Awesome because we were on a time crunch. I ordered the Totto Spicy Ramen and she got the Totto Miso Ramen( I think because we wanted to secretly share). It actually came out quick... even when the cook realized he forgot about us and became vocal about it. My ramen was pretty spicy, which makes me glad I didn't order the Totto Extreme Spicy Ramen. The char siu pork was fatty and very tasty. I love the broth they use as a base. I also noticed that they don't use MSG. I'm actually a fan of it and don't mind my meal being enhanced by it. Either way, this place was awesome and didn't really need it anyways. As I'm at home now writing this, I'm totally craving more. Lucky me it's raining the next couple of days to strike the mood :) PS. I think one of the guys from Takahachi works here now. I didn't want to ask, but I will next time.

Perfect time for Ramen, with chilling/breezy weather outside. ? I had the Totto spicy ramen. ?The ramen came out pretty quick after the order was placed. The broth was spicy as designated in the dish name. ?The thick broth gave it a different flavor, although I would have preferred a lighter less oily broth. The ramen noodles were a little hard, which my preference is for them to a bit on the softer side. ?It would have been nice to have a choice of broth style and noodle style.

This small ramen store draws a large crowd. There is always a long line along the sidewalk. I waited for 40 min even though I went even before the store opened. So get there early! When I was lining up, some TV station was there filming us, probably for a show about ramen or something. The inside of the restaurant felt like a real ramen shop in Japan. You can see the chefs cooking the ramen right before your eyes. I had the miso ramen. It came with pork belly and an egg. It was delicious. *Get there early, before 12 noon *The biggest table they have is for 4 people, so if you go in a large group, split up *This is not a place to eat slowly and chit chat for a long time. Just line up, then go in and eat your ramen, then get out! Then the next customer goes in... and repeat. *The chefs are very friendly, talk to them!

Well worth the almost hour wait in the cold. I like the idea of their outdoor sign-in sheet. But don't get caught drifting too far away. ?Maybe were not present when their name was called and were skipped right over. ?Once inside we were served promptly. ?Cold water and menus were waiting on the table. The restaurant is narrow and smaller than my living room. I like the bar that overlooks the small kitchen area which is fully exposed - huge pots visible where ramen is cooked. I started with a rice ball and has then the spicy ramen with a boiled egg added. ?The food was amazing and made me forget how cold it was inside the restaurant despite the heaters. I can't imagine being there when it is colder, although the ramen was so good that I would go back in a blizzard (hopefully there is no line then!) Pro: utter deliciousness Cons: long line, cold inside, no dessert Ippudo vs Totto: totto wins on spiciness of ramen and broth. ?Ippudo wins for more extensive menu, pork buns and bigger space.

it took me a moment to figure out the rating for this... and i'm firm in my opinion. There's a long wait, you first have to put your name on a clip board on the door outside. They have a pretty quick turn around but you'll still have to wait a while. (we waited probably more than an hour and got drinks at the japanese restaurant next door) you'll also feel rushed to finish quickly, seeing all the people wait outside and they serve the food quickly. i ordered the spicy ramen, which my friend recommended but the waiter recommended the miso ramen to my sister and her husband, which they both got and did not regret. the good thing about this place is that they offer you the option to purchase additional toppings, ie bamboo, pork, mushroom etc... unfortunately i ruined my spicy ramen by adding all the spicy bamboo, which made it too spicy. the ideal combination would be the miso ramen and ask for extra mushroom and spicy bamboo, but add the bamboo little by little to taste. they also had this great pork and rice special. it was their pork with scallions and mayo sauce. it was delicious!

Totto Spicy Ramen with an added egg is my most favorite in regards to ramen within NYC. The noodles are al dente perfercto(!) and I can't imagine the broth any more flavorful as it is here. As I am usually not a creature of habit, every time I visited, I never had to think twice about what to order. I love sitting behind the bar and slurping my noodles in utter joy as I watch the men behind the bar char the pork and put their magic to work. The only downside to this is that Totto is seemingly always packed during dinner hours until close. If you decide to come here even on a Monday night, be prepared to wait atleast half an hour for seats.

Yummm.. Totto Ramen Thurs. evening 8pm, 45 min, no bar area to hang out at but still worth it! ? ?Small space, limited menu, excellent noodles. ?Cheap sake (which I don't like) & not many appetizers. ?Dinner was done in less than 25 min. Will be back for more Ramen~ ?FYI extra extra spicy ramen is the same as spicy ramen except they give you more spicy sauce on the side therefore if I were to go again, I'd order the extra extra spicy.

It was a cold night and a perfect night for a hot bowl of ramen. I met up with a friend to try this ramen place that have been getting really great reviews. I think I've passed this place many times and always thought it was a bit out of its neighborhood of the Japanese restaurants on the 50's East side. The place is small and quaint. You know when it is a true Japanese restaurant when you are greeted with "Irrashaimase!" when you enter. We ordered the ?Char Siu mayo don to start and the Totto Spicy Ramen and Miso ramen. It was worth the wait of 30 minutes. The broth was deep and just right of fattiness unlike other places...minca ramen where the soup was so fatty it was hard to eat. I know some people like that but not for me. The noodles wasn't soggy and the spicy level was just right for me. The pork charred just right with the egg and corn. I recommend extra pork. Oh, and it is cash only but it won't bust your wallet. I know everyone will compare it to the other popular ramen in the east village and I prefer this one. Ippudo is wildly popular and rightly so because Totto will give it a run for its money. For me, I prefer the low decor, and little shops you can find in Japan over the overly hyped, yuppified, EV haunt wait for 2 hours.

It's no news flash that ramen on a cold day is one of life's greatest pleasures, so I'll skip to the food porn: My friend and I placed our order for two spicy pork ramens and a rice ball appetizer. ?Then I watched one of the chefs blow-torch sheets full of freshly sliced pork and it was love at first sight. ?Fall-off-the-bone, fatty (a good thing imo), succulent pork. ?Pork filling the rice ball and floating porkily in my ramen (hey, if any food deserves its own adverb, it's pork). ?Admittedly, I'm no expert on ramen, but I enjoyed the flavor of the broth as well as the consistency of the noodles enough to slurp down every last drop of both. We sat at the counter, which I would gladly do again because the chef was so generous and friendly. ?I asked for a side of scallions and the chef gave me a full bowl of artfully-sliced scallions, then topped it off with about another bowl's worth. ?I also ordered hot sake and he filled a water glass to the brim, laughing as he did so because he had heated exactly the right amount for the glass, to the last drop. ?Impressive! ?Not to mention $6 for a giant glass of sake is something to cheers - once you can lift your glass without spilling, of course. The half-hour wait on a cramped (but heated!) stairwell seemed daunting at first - go when you're starving only if you're into weird torture stuff - ?but otherwise, the wait is worth every second. ?The ramen is top notch, prices are totally reasonable for the quality and quantity, service is super efficient but still friendly...it really doesn't matter how tiny the place is, how long you have to wait, or the fact that the bathroom is through the kitchen and the door doesn't close (well, that was a little weird) - Totto obviously knows what they're doing, across the board.

Went for lunch on a weekday. Signed in for myself, several 2-person parties seated before my single self. Seated at the bar and watched the friendly staff do their thing. Ate the spicy regular w extra pork. Contrary to many other reviews, I just wasn't a big fan of the pork belly. Wasn't very flavorful to me, but it may have been an off day for them. ?One of the ramen dudes suggested the miso with the spicy side for next time. I plan to make a next time with a friend or two, but I can tell you that slurping ramen isn't exactly dateworthy.

A great ramen joint in midtown. ?The wait can be at Ippudo standards but with good company it can go by quickly. ?The wait is tough in the cold weather but if you manage to get in the enclosed hut with the 15 other people waiting then all that body heat makes the wait bearable. The soup is flavorful, not too heavy and noodles are perfectly al dente. I can't remember which soups I've tried but I do know that they were all delicious and hearty. If I were to compare this to other Ramen places in the city - its superior to Ramen Setagaya and Menchanko tei, couple of ranks above Rai Rai Ken and the overrated Ippudo and a baby step below Kambi/Minca. ?Totto Ramen has made its way into one of my top ramen places. ?The only thing that stinks is the wait but well worth it when you're in midtown and have a hankering for it.

YUMM. ?Thanks to a friend who recommended this place - we tried to go here on New Year's Day, but it was closed unfortunately. ?My sister and I tried again a couple wks later and were not disappointed. ?So the key here is to try to avoid "peak hours" ?and not to come with a large group or you'll be waiting for a while. ?We arrived close to 7PM on Sunday and only had to wait for about 10-15 min. ?As we were about to be seated, we noticed the # of ppl had quadrupled in size. ?Don't forget to put your name on the clipboard!!! ?The good news is there is a little plastic "tent" set up over the steps and they have a space heater for ppl waiting but once it's crowded, you're stuck on the sidewalk! We ordered: 1) Totto Chicken Paitan Ramen - delicious! ?The broth was good and the noodles were not overcooked (I hate that). ?I ordered a "seasoned boiled egg" since this ramen didn't come with it - it was everything I hoped for, but I wish they had cut it in half like they normally serve it in other bowls. ?A whole egg is kinda tricky...lol. 2) Totto Miso Ramen - also delicious. 3) Spicy Bamboo Shoots - my sister ordered a side of this since she heard it was good. ?To her shock, this dish came out and was RED. ?She thought it was simply bamboo shoots in a spicy chili oil (no idea where she got that from), but the spices were caked on! ?She took one and "washed" it in her ramen broth and she thought it was still spicy. ?And surprise! ?Her ramen also was spicy...lol. This place has a quick turnover, so don't plan on sitting around and chatting. ?CASH ONLY!!!

Once, I wasn't impressed by ramen. I went to "Samurai Noodle" in Seattle and thought ramen was just this overpriced noodle dish people ate because they didn't know better. Boy, did Totto change my mind! I always see a huge line here, so I told myself I'd come try it sometime. The opportunity arose when I had 15min to spare before my haircut down the street at Nica & Sam. So I thought, hey, why not? I was promptly seated at the bar and ordered the chicken ramen (the first thing on the menu). It was SO GOOD. The noodles were perfectly al-dente and nothing like the preconceived "cup a noodle" ramen. The pork belly was so deliciously fatty and juicy, the broth warm but light and not too salty. Served with a nice stick of seaweed and scallions, this was the perfect meal on a cold winter day. I managed to beat the rush of people who wait outside so I was very pleased with myself. Next time, I am going to get the spicy ramen with an egg--I'm craving it as I type this! Definitely going to be coming back soon.

ok, after two visits to Totto, I like it! I love it better than the ramen at Ippudo, Hide-Chan, Aji-sen, Momo-fuku, Donburiya,.... I think you get the point. It's GREAT! But, that's already evident by the "club list" at the door. Luckily, I live super close and can put my name on the list and return 30 min later. Yes, I'm a lucky ramen girl. :) tuna sashimi w/ avocado: like. Would like even better with soy sauce and wasabi. chicken flavored ramen: only ramen I've ordered personally and the one I'll stick to. The chicken broth is a combo (to me) of Japanese ramen broth and Campbell's chicken noodle. Or, at least the warmth and deliciousness of the broth bring such comfort to me that Campbell's simply comes to my mind! Ahhhh, goodness! miso flavored ramen: does not compare to the goodness of the chicken ramen. not a fan. pork over rice ($6.50): also just average. Wouldn't order again. Too much rice and too little pork. Yuuuum, I want to go again for those special straight, solid al dente straight from Japan ramen noodles! The ramen workers are so skilled and work so incredibly hard -- they should be making $50+ per hour!

And our quest for the perfect NYC ramen resumes. Totto was pretty good. Got there around 6:00pm on a Thursday and waited for about 20 min. Ordered inari as an appetizer (yummy, one of my faves) and miso ramen with extreme rayu (the hubby got regular rayu). The noodles were a little hard, the way I like it, and the soup was tasty. The pork had a nice charred texture on the sides, even though I prefer my ramen pork soft and supple. Only two pieces of pork though, and the portions are def smaller and a little pricier than I was used to in CA. I'm over it though. And I did like that it didn't taste too unhealthy (no MSG). I don't think I'd go out of the way to eat at Totto but would def eat there again if we were in the neighborhood.

Just ate here for lunch. ?The three of us arrived at about 1:45pm and waited for about 20 minutes for a table... it looked like it got a lot emptier around 2pm, but by the time we left (at about 2:45pm) the wait had lengthened again. ?The place itself was really cute, and we got to sit at the "bar" area and watch the food actually being made, which was really cool. I got the Totto Miso Ramen with no extras (although I did steal a bit of my friend's spicy sesame oil). ?$13 including tax and tip. ?It was pretty delicious, but I think Ippudo's broth is more flavorful. ?The pork was also not as good quality as Ippudo's. ?That said, there's a huge price difference between Ippudo and Totto Ramen, so I was absolutely fine with the quality. I would definitely return for a late lunch, and I really want to try the Totto Chicken Paitan Ramen. ?I would also come back in a heartbeat if I was getting a sore throat... I have a feeling this place is great for when you're sick! All in all, a great lunch. ?I'll return!

Totto is my favorite ramen place so far. It may be a long wait sometimes, but it's worth it after getting a steamy hot bowl of delicious ramen moments after the order is taken. I normally get the chicken paitan ramen, which has a rich, flavorful broth and goes well with the perfectly cooked, springy noodles. I came here recently and ordered it with chicken char siu. I thought it would be good to try something new as there wasn't a choice between pork and chicken the last time I came here. However, chicken breast is so easily overcooked and the chicken that came with Totto's ramen was slightly dry. It may be a good option for those who prefer chicken to pork, but I know next time I'll go with pork.

Third time I've visited for lunch. First two times I got the spicy ramen. Very good. This time I tried the chicken paitan ramen. I was expecting a little disappointment since I enjoy spicier dishes, but it was incredible. Noodles were perfectly cooked and the broth was soulful and complex. Also started with the avo tuna, which was a great way to whet the appetite. Went at 2:30 and waited for 20 minutes, which is testament to the quality and success of the place. Never a bad idea to supplement your bowl with an egg and some shredded char siu pork!

On a recent business trip to New York, the weather went from 100's and humid, to thunderstorms and lightening, and then to cold and rain. Needless to say, I craved a bowl of hot ramen. To avoid the long lines, I avoided the lunch crowd, and went straight after work at 5pm. I was by myself and seated right away at the counter. This place is small. Can only seat about 20-25 people at a time. You will get seated faster, if you have a small group. I ordered the Miso Ramen with extra char siu pork, and for an extra $3.50 got 2 smoked salmon onigilly (rice balls). Sitting at the counter, I got to watch the 2 guys behind the counter preparing all the food. There is no kitchen. Just 2 guys that probably speak very little english making your food right there. I was very amused by them singing to the american hip hop music they had playing in the background. What is also amazing is how they prepare the pork. Thin slices that they char with with a small torch, right before it is served to you. The broth in my ramen was delicious. I drank ever last drop. The pork was so flavorful, I almost wish I ordered more. The onigilly was ok. Not enough salmon in it for my liking. The reason why I only gave them 4 stars is because the noodles were a little bit more al dente then my liking. I'm sure if i just let it sit in my bowl of steaming hot broth a few minutes, it would have been fine, but I ate that ramen so fast, it didn't have a chance. If you love ramen, you must try this place.

The ramen here is so good that I slurp up every piece of noodle and every last drop of broth. ?Well, most of it anyways. ?I came here one night after deciding that the 1.5 hour wait at Ippudo wouldn't be worth it, and I am so glad I did. ?Totto is my go-to ramen shop every time I crave the noodles, and I usually get the Totto Spicy Ramen. ?The noodes are cooked perfectly; the broth is rich and fiery; the char siu pork melts in the mouth; and the nori, bean sprouts, and scallions provide a contrast of crunchiness to the soft noodles and liquid broth. ?I still haven't tried Ippudo, but Totto is too delicious for me to go anywhere else. My boyfriend also greatly enjoys the ramen at Totto. ?Before I brought him here, he thought ramen was only cheap instant-cooked noodles. ?He now has a newfound appreciation for ramen and usually gets the Totto Miso Ramen. ?We have also tried the Spicy Tuna Don, which I thought was good, but not even comparable to the ramen. ?However, my boyfriend really liked the dish, which is quite something because he doesn't generally eat seafood. ?He said the marinade completely covered the fishy taste. Totto is a small shop with a counter where you can watch the chefs make the ramen and cook the char siu pork with a blow torch, and there are a few tables. ?Don't come here with a party of more than 4 people. ?Also, the wait is usually quite long. ?I've waited anywhere from 30 minutes during weekday lunch to over an hour over the weekend. ?It's worth every second though!

AWESOME place. Great ramen and super friendly staff. Try to sit at the bar if you can because it's pretty awesome to see them cook right in front of you. ?The only downside is that you usually have to wait 30min to an hour most evenings.

Upon arriving, there was a line out on the sidewalk. Given that the restaurant was one of those small ones with a bar stand overseeing the kitchen and a couple of tables to seat 4 people, i can't blame them for not having a waiting area. The wait was approximately 45 minutes (on a Wednesday night! imagine what it would be like on a Friday? or even the weekends???) so I was hoping the food was worth the wait! Indeed it was! And the time to make the food made up for the wait too. Very quick but not too quick that the quality of food was compromised. I had the Totto Extreme Spicy Ramen because it was rated with a zillion spicy chilli's compared to the regular Spicy Ramen. If you want to CONTROL your own choice of hot/spicy-ness, get this dish over the Spicy Ramen because the quirk is that sauce comes on the side. The portions were perfect and the noodles and didn't resemble anything "instant" about it. Overall, I loved it!

Food gets 5 stars .. knocked off 1 star because of the wait. Got to the restaurant at 8:50pm on a Saturday night. Ended up waiting an hour and 40 minutes. We ordered the tuna avo, grilled uni don, char siu mayo don, totto spicy ramen and totto miso ramen. Everything was super duper awesome especially the ramen broth. I loved how every dish came with scallions too. I honestly think this was the best ramen I ever ate. Get the seasoned avocado on the ramen - It's a MUST! FYI: don't get double noodles AND a rice dish. You're most likely not going to finish it!

Waited about 1 hour on a Wednesday night for a table of 4 around 7pm. Bare-bones environment. ?Not a lot of glitz or glamor. ?Just good old Japanese waiters and food. ?Was seated near the back of the restaurant which was perfect because the air conditioner helped to cool down our noodles. I know that many people come here for the ramen, but I would argue that the spicy tuna over rice was just as good and I would return just for that! I ordered the Totto Spicy Ramen. ?Being that the Totto Extreme Spicy Ramen is the same price, I would've ordered that. ?They offer the "extreme spicy" on the side - so you can pour it in as you like it. ? The spicy bamboo shoots are really spicy - definitely order it if you enjoy having a nice spicy kick to your toppings. I would say that Ippudo is a bit better than this place. ?But I believe that whichever place you try first tends to be your preference.

We put our name down on the list, went around the corner to the Irish Pub, had a drink for about 30 minutes and came wait to wait another 40 minutes for a bowl of ramen... and it was worth every single minute and more. I'm kinda of fan of Ippudo soup, but not so much their thin noodles. Totto is the best of both worlds for me. They're slightly thicker, so they slurp better. Plus, I'm not sure if it's the fact that you get to watch the soup stock being cooked that makes it better, but their soup is awesome. There are only 2 negatives: 1. The wait and lack of a bar in the restaurant (unlike Ippudo), and 2. The heat in there. Holy cow, I don't know how you don't pass out working there!

Having lived in Asia for the most of my life and havent' been back for a while, I started craving Japanese Ramen which led me to Totto Ramen. Friend and I ordered Totto Miso Ramen with Rayu, Boiled Egg, Nori Seaweed and Spicy Bamboo Shoot. (Sounds complete!) However, the egg never came, and it was not until we walked out of the store when we remembered. Anyway, the soup tastes alright, very flavorful, yet my biggest disappointment is - it is not HOT enough. In authentic Japanese Ramen stores, the temperature of the soup is essential to the entire bowl of ramen. A soup that is not HOT enough is like chips not crispy enough. The rayu (spicy sesame oil) is spicy, but not spicy spicy. The two red pepper icons on the menu really says what it is. The noodles - Not the softness I expected, should have stated specifically what hardness/softness I would like to have if I come next time. Besides, I don't think they focus on their noodles that much since I don't think they are using high quality noodles. GO TO ASIA IF YOU WANT REAL RAMEN!

Happy happy tummy. I can't there was a wait on a Wednesday night 30 minutes before they close. I was hesitant as each minute passed by..would it be worth the hype. I can say yes. I am not sure I would wait 2 hours for it but who knows. The base of the soup being chicken gives it a different depth to the flavors. It's not as heavy but still very hearty. The char siu is so yummy. There is just the right amount of chew and crisp from being torched but somehow it's still able to melt in your mouth. The noodles were cooked perfectly with just the right al dente. I love onions so I was happy with the amount but I guess if you aren't a fan, it might be overpowering. The spicy sauce was so savory and glad we got it on the side. Just a bit adds the right amount I kick. Have your napkins ready to wipe away the beads of sweat that will be coming not only from the other customer's body heat but from the heat of the soup. It's a small and cozy space. Its simple home cooking. That's all you really need sometimes.

YUMMMMMM.............I am salivating and on the verge of running back to Totto as I write this review. Only a few blocks from my apartment, this is the place I suggest every time my bf asks where I want to go eat. By far THE best ramen place in NYC and just so. Much. Better than the competition. Especially the broth, which is perfectly rich and flavorful without being overly salty. The only problem is that the seating area is tiny, so there is always at least an hour wait unless you go super early. The side dishes are not very good, but who cares about those when you have a giant bowl of the most delicious ramen in the world in front of you.

Totto hits the spot like no other food joint in the city... When I go to Totto, I don't eat breakfast or lunch because not being able to finish the amazingly tasty ingredients put into every single culturally crafted bowl of blissfulness would do dishonor to the ramen gods. There is no doubt in my mind that this is the best bang for your buck in NYC... the appetizers and entrees are as cheap as they come, and the service is quick and alert. When I go, I get the Totto Chicken Paitan Ramen, with the Char Siu Pork, Kikurage Mushroom, Seasoned Boiled Egg, and the rayu sauce for some kick. The flavor combos work really well together... I do wish they had a poached egg option though. If they offer the grilled sea urchin special ($4.50) order it. While it is difficult to declare a clear winner of 'who has the best ramen in NYC' Totto gives Ippudo a run for their money. Ippudo doesn't have as much culture and soul as Totto, but has a more diversified and pricier menu... Bottom Line: Go to Totto, wait on the line, and brace yourself for an exploration the likes of which your mouth has never experienced. When you sit down in this restaurant you are no longer in America... you are in ramen country...

This is the BEST hole in the wall Ramen house by far. This is the 4th Ramen joint I've been to, (Ippudo, Momofuku, Minca) were the previous ones. This is a very small place and there is a substantial wait during lunchtime and gets crowded easily, so not good for a lot of people. Me and my friend sat at the kitchen bar area, where they freshly make the ramen bowls and char broil the pork using a butane torch right in front of us. The chef was a really friendly guy and down to earth, even said he was a former chef of Setagaya that got fired lol. As for the food, I ordered the spicy Chicken Paitan Ramen, although I wanted to try the Extreme Spicy one, but the chef said it would not be enjoyable, I also ordered an extra egg and kishuragi mushrooms. The ramen came from the chef within a minutes after ordering. The noodles were perfectly al dente, and the broth was phenomenal. The spicy oil provided an extra kick but didn't ruin the flavor of the broth. The toppings were also fresh as well. The pork was amazing with fatty and juicy goodness. The ramen was so good I ordered a kaedama (second helping of ramen-$2.50) with another order of pork ($2.50). Overall, I would say this is one of the best ramen houses by far, even though this place has only been around for 10 months. I can't say its better than Ippudo because the ramen here is chicken-based while Ippudo is pork-based, but they definitely would rival each other. If you are craving for a different ramen join other than the usual Momofuku or Ippudo, this is THE place.

To many, Ramen is a way of life. A religious practice. A ?Japanese cultural icon that has made its way all over the world into every college dorm room in the US in it's instant noodle form. I have been practicing Ramenism for a few years now since my first visit to Japan in 2008 and my life has been better for it. A hot bowl of Ramen on a biting cold night is the epitome of salvation and I've found a spot in NYC called Totto Ramen that will do a great job holding me over until the fall when I return to my favorite spot in Tokyo, Houran Ramen. It was freezing cold and my friend and former RENT cast mate Kyle Post and I just walked out of the theatre after seeing Book Of Mormon. We were so giddy from the show that we didn't want to go home. We were hungry and up for an adventure. The thought of a steamy bowl of Ramen warming our faces as the noodles slid warmly into our stomachs was the answer. TOTTO RAMEN -When we arrived at Totto Ramen there was a 30 minute wait. We put our names on the list and quietly froze outside teeth chattering. Every person that walked out brought us closer to the heat lamps. Luckily we ran into some of our favorite Japanese Rentheads who were watching Anthony Rapp's show down the street. Seeing them truly warmed my heart and after a quick hello and hug our name was called. We took a seat at the bar that had the prefect view of the kitchen right in front of us. As we had hoped, the huge soup caldrons of broth steamed the ice right out of our blood and moments after ordering, a beautiful bowl of Ramen was set before me.It was delicious. Perfectly tender noodles and rich Miso that drowned in a light but tasty broth. The toppings were fresh and complimented nicely as they spilled over the edge of the bowl at times (you can add extra toppings if you like at a minimal price.) ?Chopsticks in one hand, spoon in the other, I couldn't make up my mind which one to stick with so I alternated with every bite and slurp all the way down to the bottom of the bowl. In the end, I sat there full, content and happy as a Buddha. It was definitely worth the wait. If you find yourself in the Times Square area this winter, make your way to Totto Ramen, but be prepared to wait. http://www.bwaybites.com…

Simple, (comparatively) cheap ramen in a tiny basement in Hell's Kitchen. Be sure to check the walls for handwritten signs announcing that night's specials. The ramen was a healthy serving of firm noddles in a rich, creamy chicken broth. You had you choice of the house ramen, spicy ramen, extra spicy ramen, and some others. A good range of add-ins, I had mine with char shu and egg, my date had char shu and avaocado. Unless you eat ramen regularly, don't expect to order an appetizer and a bowl of ramen and finish both. This is a conservative size bowl of ramen, but it's still a lot of food. ?Ramen is $10.25, appetizers and beer are about $5 each. For two people the bill, after tax and before tip came to $45. Waited about 40 minutes on a Thursday night, putting own name on the list at 6:30pm. Waiting during cold weather sucks, but there's a small fought-over inner-sanctum area of the restaurant you can stand in to keep warm. The space was a little awkward and cramped. The long wait is really more due to the 10-person max capacity than the high demand for ramen. Sitting at the bar actually doesn't look bad, but the tables in the back are so cramped you have to ask the person at the next table to move so you can sit down (or maybe I've just been eating too much ramen). Since you're sitting right next to people at a bar, but not on a barstool, you get this sense of sitting really low, your eye-level is their ass-level. In the back, they were cutting 40 or so large onions, but the place is so small, the couple at the table next to ours were getting onion juice in their face. Their eyes were red and swollen, and they asked to move, wow. We didn't get it that bad. Never bring more than 4 here.

Why is it that you don't do "to go" orders? ?I wasn't even able to take my soup home! ?What a waste! ?I wonder if I brought in my own Tupperware if that would be a problem? ?I'll try it next time. ?Oh believe me there will be a next time. Thanks Totto! ? PS, say hi to your sister establishment for me.

So apparently, they DO have air conditioning, just not on the day that I went. The lack of ac on a crazy humid and hot summer night greatly reduced my appetite - especially for a bowl of steaming hot ramen. Truth be told, I'm usually a huge fan of ramen joints, but during my visit to totto ramen, I felt almost nauseated and could only manage 1/3 of my flavorful miso ramen. After about 1/3 of the ramen, I looked over at my dining companion with big imploring eyes, hoping that he got the message : dying of heatstroke, must leave now. Thankfully, he was understanding, or, just a quick eater, and we were out of there in record time. So i can get some fresh (garbage scented) air. At first, i was hesitant about giving this joint a second chance, but if i happen to be in the area, and the ac is working....i might stop by to give that miso ramen a second chance.

I THOROUGHLY enjoyed my meal here! The wait was long but it was worth it! -The noodles were cooked to perfection. -The use of chicken broth was cool and gave the food a much lighter taste than traditional pork broth. -The service was friendly (I thought they were going to be rude or act tired because of how many people they had to serve but they were very energetic). -The place was very clean! I just wish there was more seating but that cant be helped :(

Great ramen! Me and bf went here to try their ramen after a friend higly recommended it. We walked over and saw about 10 people waiting outside of Totto, so we put our names down on a waiting list on Totto's door and waited inline to be called. After a 20 minutes wait, 2 seats are available for us, so we sat right down at the bar. The chef at the bar happily greeted us and let us take our time with the menu. Bf went with chicken ramen and I went with their char su pork ramen. Both were delicious! Both ramen's broth are thick and flavorful, the noodles tasted perfect. While we were eating, bf kept on looking at the huge bottles of sake next to him, he couldn't resist them since he's an alcoholic =P so he went ahead and ordered a glass. It's a pretty good portion for $5. Normally the same size of sake would go for about $12 at other places. It was good sake, too, so I finished half of it, for him, of course. While we were sitting at the bar, eating, we saw that one of the chef was using a blow torch to slow roast slices of pork, which was very interesting. This definitely is a great ramen place, with fair prices.

This place is great actually - I was very underwhelmed with sister restaurant Hide-Chan and so pretty unexcited to check this place out. I was very pleasantly surprised and would recommend this to anyone in the neighborhood. The fact that we got there at 6pm and still needed to wait nearly an hour means I wouldn't recommend anyone go out of their way to get to midtown for this food, because the wait is already borderline not worth it. Also I like that the spicy items have a very specific number of pepper icons next to them, they mostly vary between one and three but the extreme spicy ramen has like seventeen which is pretty funny.

As a kid my culinary exploits began by boiling up a packet of 25 cent ramen and chopping up some hot dogs to add to the party. ?This is not that kind of ramen. ?I Came at an off time so there was no crazy wait. Seats are at the counter, alongside a couple friendly guys slingin noodles and crisping up pork with a blow torch. ?There were a couple of tables towards the back of this tiny space as well. So I guess you rate ramen by three aspects. ?Broth pork and noodles. ?Well the broth was chicken based and was excellent. ?Then there were two slices of porky goodness. ?A good helping of noodles were served a little too al dente for me but still good. ?Awoesome comfort food on a cold day. ?Ten bucks for the bowl was decent price but I eat like a fat kid so I was still hungry after. ?Would recommend this place and will be back just not when there is an hour wait.

Tip #1: Go when there isn't so many people. I should've had the chicken broth with the pork and eggs. But...I had the vege option. I gotta say, this was the best ramen I've had in the USA. My entire being felt healed inside this place. The moisture of the broth permeated the small space.

Ambiance: ?It has the wonderful feel of a small Japanese ramen restaurant - love it! ?It has the enhanced aesthetic of having brick walls, being underground and giving you the sensation of being a part of a hip secret. ?The space is made up of a couple four tops, two tops and a bar of lined single seats. ?While the space is incredibly small, that is part of the experience - tight seating and incredibly fast turn over. Service: ?The girl running the reservations was a little weird in her attempts to show the superiority of the restaurant that necessitated the long wait, while also trying to be funny with some unclever jokes. ?The waitstaff is very attentive as it is a small space so they can see all the tables at once, and it ultimately their attentiveness helps turn over the tables. ?The water and clearing table guy was unobtrusive. ?The waitress offered no information and assumes you are aware of the menu and the specials (as well you should be after the wait outside with the information blazoned on the walls). Food: ?The special of inari was the highlight for us! ?Sweet and soft tofu holding flavorful and sticky ginger rice with some asian mushrooms - delicious and my favorite part of the meal. ?There are many types of ramen, and this caters to a particular crowd. ?The broth fulfills its reputation as you can certainly taste the depth of its chicken flavor. ?The noodles are thinner than most ramen places (which I didn't like) and they were a little chewy (which I did like, but I also like softer and silky noodles too). ?We both ordered extreme spicy, which actually wasn't that spicy. ?If you are a real spicy eater (read-Sichuan food if your favorite type of Chinese food), then you will find the extreme spicy underwhelming and more than tolerable. ?The best part of the soup was the charsiu which fulfilled all your pork belly needs. ?It literally melted in my mouth and was amazing! Overall: ?I would definitely come back, but not if I had to wait more than half an hour. ?There are so many places to get ramen, as well as the ability to make excellent ramen at home. ?The real draw is the underground feel, the delicious charsiu, and the well executed specials.

I saw this server yelling at a guy who was just trying to charge his 5% battery-life iphone, which was approved by another guy.

Haven't been to ippudo, but I feel like I wouldn't need to with totto right here, and pretty close to the GWB. ?It's a very small place, with a bar and some tables set up. ?I can definitely see lines getting very long during peak eating hours, but fortunately I went in between lunch and dinner and got my food quickly. The ramen is beautiful...that's all I have to say. I had the chicken ramen (or was it the pork? my brother had the other), and it was great. ?Not too much meat to overwhelm the other ingredients, and the soup tastes fantastic.

I'm the type of person who calls ahead for a table whenever possible. I seriously dislike waiting to be seated for more than 15 minutes. And yet I've waited for a spot at Totto Ramen multiple times, for at least 45 minutes at a time. I generally dislike bar seating. And yet I've done that at Totto Ramen and simply dropped off the suit at the cleaners to remove that ramen smell (so good, but not exactly interview appropriate). That's an awesome bowl of chicken broth and noodles for less than $20. It's a very happy bowl of soup. 4 people to a group, max. Bring cash. Resist the temptation to slurp your noodles. Get a bowl of extra noodles and enjoy.

Few tidbits: - Super small; probably accommodates at most 20 customers - Only accommodates parties of 4 - if you have 5, decide who must eat alone or who must be ditched. - There is no "line" ; there's a piece of paper that hangs on the door that you must place your name on - DON'T FORGET TO DO THIS! (this is New York... if your name is not on the list, you are not getting seated no matter how long you've waited) My friends and I went right around 5PM on a Saturday and had to wait over an hour to be seated. ?We ordered the Totto Miso Ramen (which my friends later had to ask for spicy paste because it was a bit bland without it), Spicy Tuna Don, Sea Urchin, Char Siu Chunks, and Avo Tuna. ?I thought they were all prepared decently; the Char Siu Chunks weren't as tender as I expected them to be but not inedible. ?The service was decent; food came out within 10 minutes of ordering. ?I'd come back if I didn't have to wait.

Oishi Des!! I've had ramen everywhere from Kyoto station to dowtown LA, and Totto Ramen is truly something special. This tucked away little secret embodies everything ramen should be. From the tiny kitchen with huge stock pots to the eat-and-run vibe, this place is straight outta legitville. I had the original chicken ramen, so perfect. The broth was lightly seasoned with deep flavors, and not to greasy. The noodles deliciously chewy. I got mine with an seasoned egg. YUM. I went early, 6:30 on a Monday night and the place was packed! Be prepared to wait... but it's SO worth it. There isn't much else on the menu besides ramen, but really, why would you come here for anything else?

I am a HUGE ramen fan and I have to admit that I was SO SAD... After all the reviews and all the hype, this place did not pan out to be the phenomenal ramen place I thought it would be. I kept it simple and had the Totto Chicken ramen with pork...I was not a fan of the noodle/brother combination (maybe the brother should have been stronger?)... Maybe I just didn't like the noodles? Sitting at the bar was entertaining (I love watching people have a good time while they're cooking), but... Yea... The meat was VERY fatty... The meat lovers ramen was half fat... I don't know... I would eat here again, but there are plenty of other ramen shops (some in the area) that I would go to before this one.

This is a great place to go for a steaming bowl of comforting ramen. Broth was well-balanced - thick and tasty but not overly fatty like Minca or Ippudo (which are great in their own right but require a special mood for super rich foods). Portion size was perfect - you don't feel grossed out with yourself after finishing a whole bowl. Noodles - chewy, springy and of the slightly curly ramen variety; it was also slightly thicker in diameter than your usual ramen. Spicy ramen - this was very tasty and not too spicy. ?The 'spiciness' was simply from a ladle of chilli oil and plenty of crispy garlic bits. ?It comes with two thin slices of pork and plenty of scallions. Miso ramen - this was also very tasty, albeit a little bit on the too-salty side. ?The 'miso' was simply a big spoonful of ground pork that's been cooked into a thick paste with miso and placed on the ramen for you to mix in yourself. ?It comes with lots of bean sprouts. 2 thin slices of pork and a hard-boiled egg (which you can add to any ramen for an extra $1). Both times I was there was around 7pm, and there was no wait at all. ?The place is tiny (bar seating plus a few tables) and very hot in this summer heat - I don't think they've installed a/c units....so try to sit near the entrance to the restaurant for a bit of breeze. I'll still definitely come back when I've got the craving for a hot, steamy bowl of ramen, which is often.

The restaurant is small and the menu is limited, but that's not a bad thing. ?I'm not sure how crowded this place usually gets but coming in for dinner at 9:30 on a Wednesday was a breeze. ? As for the food, the noodles had a nice bite and the meat was tasty. ?I got the spicy ramen (which actually is not very spicy) and my boyfriend got the extra spicy ramen, which I recommend because they give you the hot sauce on the side and you can add as little or as much as you like. Ippudo is still my number one but given that I live on the upper west side and its a pain in the butt to get down to the east village, I'm pretty happy to have Totto Ramen as an alternative

Tucked down in the basement, Totto Ramen encompasses a small narrow space which looks like it sits about 30 people. I came here when it first opened since I am a huge fan of Yakitori Totto and I'm happy to report that this second visit confirmed that the teething pains are gone, with the AC now fixed, menu fully functioning and for some reason, the ramen tasting better than I remembered the last time. Perhaps it's due to the unseasonably cold day today, which always adds that extra flavor to hot, brothy dishes.. I had the spicy ramen (the one with 2 chillies sign) while my friend had the regular ramen with boiled egg. The chilli sauce addition suits the chicken broth really well and I would recommend it if you can take some spice. Otherwise, the noodles were ok. My issue is that the noodle texture is a bit stale and lifeless when you bite into it. Since I've had Ippudo downtown, this, unfortunately, cannot quite compare. Otherwise, touting the use of no MSG and producing good tastes, Ramen Totto draws the crowds, although not quite like its sisters Yakitori Totto and Soba Totto.. I waited for ~10 minutes at ~7pm on a Thursday which is much better since the initial opening crowds have thinned out.

On my first trip to NYC, apart of the agenda was to find a good ramen place. ?We had tons of suggestions from friends, but the reviews for each place were so mixed we just decided to find one on our own. ?We went around lunch time and it was packed, we actually got there before it was open but did not know we could have written our names down on the waitlist hanging from the door. ?So we walked around the block to kill time, and when we got back there were already 10 people in front of us. Granted this is the only ramen place we tried in NYC, but it was really good! ?We went 2x in 4 days. I wasn't a huge fan of the noodles but I'm all about the broth. ?I got the spicy ramen and it was the perfect spicy, not too weak but not too strong. ?The pork was the perfect texture and charred to perfection. Be sure to get the seasoned brown egg as well. ?You can order extra sides for an extra charge too. ?I would give this place 5 stars, if it were not so tiny inside. ?I like to have elbow room while eating noodles especially. ?The basement probably sits 25 people max. I can't wait to try more ramen places in NYC, but this place really wowed me about ramen. ?Going back to Houston, I fear I may never find anything close to it. ?Until next time NYC ramen...

Ippudo still rules in my book (and San Francisco is sorely lacking in awesome ramen digs), but Totto hit the spot. ?The mid-town/center of insanity location is an odd place to find a place like this, but I was happy to find it and thrilled the ramen was really, really good. Why not great? ?The broth, while very, very good, doesn't measure up to Ippudo's. ?The noodles were perfectly prepared, pork was very good and the usual ramen accoutrements were all there in good measure. The space is small and seating is predominantly at the bar facing the cook/prep area. ?Service is fast and accommodating. ?This is an awesome stop if you love ramen!

Went back the other night and I think the vegetarian broth recipe has changed. Big disappointment. It's still OK but not mouthwateringly delicious. I had to wait outside for 45 minutes with my friend, the entire time promising the best ramen she's ever had, and I felt terrible when it wasn't as good as the first time. Another friend (who was with me the first time) agrees that future visits were not up to par. However, they are now open for lunch, which will probably come in handy at some point.

Totto's ramen is creamy, steamy, pure dreamy goodness! Came here with friends after a lackluster (and expensive) experience at Ippudo and boy were we impressed! We especially love how they let you mix in the ball of miso into your soup for the Miso Ramen, so you can always adjust the flavor of the soup. My personal favorite is the Spicy Ramen (chicken broth based)--the noodles taste extra fresh and the soup's got a real kick! They also brown the pieces of pork in front of you with a flame torch--totally adds flavor and texture to the meat. Don't miss the specials posted on the walls: our fave was the sea urchin rice dish - super fresh, flavorful, not too fishy, and the texture was just melt-in-your-mouth amazing. The staff are so cute too, just like the ramen places in Japan!

I ordered the Totto Miso ramen with the Riyu (spicy sesame oil). ?The soup was OK, but I've definitely had better at Mitsuwa, Menchanko-Tei, and Ippudo. ?Even the noodles were sub-par.

Toto Ramen, the first time we went sure we had to wait two hours but they took our number and called us when our name came up. Second time again we waited several hours but this time because we hadn't waited outside of the 20 seater restaurant the entire time when our name was called we missed our name on the list by one person. We were rejected at 10;30 at night and treated rudely. DO NOT GO TO TOTO RAMEN. THEY ARE JERKS!!! NOT WORTH THE WAIT. !!!

4.5 stars. i think it's pretty telling when a place already has over 800 reviews and it hasn't been open longer than a year and a half. There's not much else I can say that hasn't already been said either. In the great Ippudo Totto debate, I personally am Team Totto. I think they do their broth better (doesn't taste like it has a gargantuan amount of MSG), and the Char Siu pork beats Kakuni at Ippudo by a hair. I usually get the miso or the spicy, just depending on whether I'd rather have some kick in my soup and get an extra portion of the char siu pork. Things to keep in mind are that the place is tiny and does not take reservations. You gotta get here either at 5 PM super early or go for a late night meal b/c otherwise you'll most likely be in line 1.5 hours+. Also, don't come with your entire posse expecting to be seated. I would say you could maybe have 4 total in your party max, but even that may be too much. 2 is ideal. That being said, it's definitely worth the trip out or the wait at least once. You will return fo sho. CASH ONLY!

Even though I got there at 4pm thinking there won't be much of a line for an early dinner, but I still waited for an hour. However, this was definitely worth the hour wait in the 30 degree weather. I got the Totto Spicy Ramen just like everyone else suggested, was not disappointed at all, it definitely lived up to my expectation. ?The meat was amazing, and the spice was perfect For sure going back again next time I go back to New York!

I was extremely skeptical of this place because most ramen broth bases are pork based, not chicken like here, so my skepticism was about the richness and depth of flavor. ? That being said, after my first sip of the broth, all my fears quickly eroded and I was in ramen heaven. ?I just had the regular ramen, with sliced pork, an egg, and mushrooms... so simple, yet so delicious. ?Broth had an incredible dept of flavor... the sliced pork had a slight char on it and had that unctuousness you would associate with well done pork belly... and egg and mushrooms were good. ?

This is it... The platonic ideal of ramen places... The bowl of noodles that you'll be dreaming about for months to come... The line is long, you'll be in for a serious wait no matter what time you go, it's cramped, hot, no one really speaks English, there are only about 5 things on the menu... And it is absolutely one of my favorite places in the city. Sometimes you don't need the glitz and classy atmosphere, you just need simple and delicious food cooked to zen perfection. So here's how it works: You show up and write your name on the list. If you're more than a party of two... I feel bad for you, it might be a long time... You might have to disinvite them. You have to do what you have to do... There will be a LOT of names ahead of you on the list no matter what time you go because this place has a line 30 minutes before it opens. SO what that means is that at exactly 5pm (or 12pm for lunch) they fill the whole place at once. THEN because Ramen is pretty quick, all of the tables generally turn over in about 30 minutes and another wave of names get called. So just be sure you don't leave too long if you go around the corner for a drink. You may think there are 6 names ahead of you so you're fine and then all of a sudden, 6 names get called, you're still having a beer around the corner and when you come back you might be really sad BECAUSE... they will not seat you if your name has been called and you weren't there. Under any circumstances. Ever. It would basically start a riot with the pack of hungry diners standing around outside. It's like a scene out of Les Miserables out there a little bit, a bunch of hungry people staring at people waiting for them to finish eating, if someone ever tried to jump ahead in the list I'm pretty sure they would get eaten alive. But don't worry, once you're inside you forget all about the hungry crowds staring in at you, BECAUSE IT'S DELICIOUS. Start off by sharing a tuna-don (spicy tuna over rice) with your one companion and perhaps a sake, gloating over all the hungry people still waiting outside. Then get the spicy ramen. I wish I could tell you about the other types of ramen they have but I crave the spicy ramen so much each time that I can't bring myself to order anything else. This is a chicken broth ramen which is different than the usual tonkotsu pork based ramen broth I get at other places. And it's awesome. The noodles are awesome. The pork is seared with a blowtorch (like one of those mini creme brulee torches). The only problem is that once you eat here. You will have to come back. Your friends will make fun of you for wanting to wait an hour in line to get noodles. And then they will try it. And they will have to come back. And then pretty soon you won't even tell them you're going because you don't want them to think that you're only craving ramen constantly. And then you'll see them there. And you'll both have to admit you have a problem. See you at the next Ramen Anonymous meeting. If only I could stop.

Good times to go would be Monday through Thursday from 3-5p. Otherwise you may be stuck with an hour wait...or longer! You can also go 20 min before it opens to avoid waiting in the small often crowded waiting area with only one small bench. But it was still worth it. The totto miso ramen was delicious, very creamy and porky.

I was waiting a really long time. ?i had to wait longer than I should have because a few of the cook's friends came and they were giving line-cutting privileges. ?How annoying. Once in, service was quick and efficient. ?Our bowls came in less than 10 minutes. ?The meat bowl ramen is huge though. ?My friend couldn't finish it and they didn't have boxes for take out. ?Bring your own box for take out if you can (you're allowed to). ?The broth is so worth it. ?No MSG, boiled for hours and completely delicious.

After three failed attempts (that line always seems too long), I FINALLY ate at Totto Ramen last night. I must say, it was worth the effort! In order to beat the crowds, I showed up at 4:45 for their 5pm Sunday opening. Maybe a little extreme, but definitely a good idea. We sat down at 5:10 at one of the small tables in the back. The decor is a little rough around the edges, but I didn't mind it. The overall atmosphere has a good vibe. For dinner, I ordered the totto spicy ramen with chicken. It was awesome. The broth was rich and flavorful. The noodles were perfect. My boyfriend had the Niku ramen (pork meats). It was outstanding. You must try it! We also tried the avo tuna side. That yuzu garlic sauce was so good. I can't say enough good things about our dishes. Now, I completely understand the long lines. I'll even wait in one to experience this meal again! Go ASAP!

I'm sorry but I am from Minne-snow-da and this is the best ramen I've ever had. Never been to Japan - but I am pretty sure this is as close as it gets. The pork was amazeballs! So delicious and the fat just melts in your mouth! ^__^ Broth is so good. UGH. I've been back from NYC for less than a week and I think about this place at least twice a day.

OH MY GOSH! SPICY RAMEN BLISS! My husband and I were in NY for about 5 days and we ate at totto ramen ?3 of those days, need I say more? Their spicy ramen is the best thing that you will ever eat. The wait wasn't that bad at all...but I am a big believer that if there isnt a wait, then the food probably isnt that good. Not to mention that the staff is super super friendly and sweet! ?If you havent had totto ramen, you REALLY need to! My husband and I are from houston but we did talk about flying into NY for the weekend when we are free just to eat at totto ramen LOL. It is just that good people!

The broth was very good, thick & rich But I do not like the noodle It is not the traditional ramen noodle that I had in Tokyo. The ramen noodle should be bit of yellow and bit transparent. Also it doesn't have any flour or doughy taste. The ramen noodle should be nutty, bit chewy, bouncy, it is very unique noodle that you can only find in Japanese traditional ramen I am not sure why totto ramen chose this doughy noodle Also the ramen seriously lacks in topping Unless you pay extra to add additional topping, it only comes with two very thin slice of pork fat and scallion.

As we all know, the experience of eating at a restaurant is not limited to just the quality of the food but extends to pricing, wait time, service, etc. In all these respects, Totto Ramen was a sublime meal. I've tried to get a seat at this restaurant on a Saturday night, and the wait is usually 45 min-1 hr. Sooo we cleverly arrived at 4:50pm on Sunday night (the restaurant opens at 5pm) and we were the first seating, escaping the chilly night into the warmth of the small restaurant. Score! The food was divine -- I ordered the spicy vegetable ramen, while my date ordered the spicy ramen with pork. Both dishes were heavenly. The broth was so flavorful, as were the ingredients. The seasoned avocados were SO, SO good (I would've ordered extra), while the egg was nothing to write home about. The char siu pork was amazing -- they char it with a blowtorch right in front of your eyes for a delicious, smoky flavor. And of course, the bill... for about $10-12 apiece, what could be a better deal? And mind you, people, this is a full-on meal. Remember, of course, that it's cash only. Can't wait to go back for some more... the colder it gets outside, the more I'll be dreaming about Totto Ramen. I'll just have to make sure I get there early...

I'm pretty sure everything imaginably positive has been expressed about this narrow and intimate resto. I would not suggest this to vegan/vegetarian types as the main ingredient, chicken broth is the foundation of this amazing soup. On the other hand, I would suggest asking for front row seats at the bar, of the chefs effortlessly throwing about noodles, blazing thinly sliced fatty pork, sprinkling spices and greens into the broth. Be sure to bring your own container so you can savor the rest of the soup for a midnight snack!

Been here 4 times now and last night was the first time I REALLY liked my ramen. I don't know what was different...but the soup tasted less greasy and more flavorful than usual. ?Anyway, I guess I am a fan now! -get cash, and make sure your friends have cash so you don't have to cover anyone. -go before 6:30. If you are a fool and get there around 7:30, you will have to wait 40+min -get the chicken soup. The miso soup is way too salty...if you have to have miso, get it on the side (then you are basically having chicken soup+ "add your own miso" -ask for the hot sauce. It's more like hot garlic oil...but it adds the necessary kick to make things poppin (what can I say, I'm Korean). ?There's fried garlic in the oil that I really like. -if you can, get a table. Or else be prepared to SWEAT...or blink in fear of getting hot ramen water splashed in your eye (I joke, this didn't happen). You will find me here at least once every two weeks...it is officially my new go-to ramen place in nyc.

Totto ramen is right up there with Ippudo as far as hype and long lines go. ?I had to check it out to see if it was worth all the talk. First thing you'll notice compared to other ramen spots is that it's a lot smaller space than an Ippudo, even though it gets massive lines and long waits. ?As a result you'll find yourself elbow to elbow with the other dining patrons while you're sipping your noodles. ?I'm all for cozy but sometimes you want a little more space and without having someone else's conversation directly in your face. ?Minus one star. With that out of the way comes the good parts. ?Totta Ramen surpasses Ippudo when it comes to the most important part of ramen, the noodles. ?Cooked al dente these thin, straight noodles have excellent consistency. ?This is some quality noddle. ?The soup broth is chicken based and is less oily and has a lighter taste than the usual Pork soup base used by most ramen spots. ?The toppings, which include scallion, onion and nori are all fresh and refreshingly crispy. ?The chashu is mouthwateringly good and melts in your mouth with a great bbq flavor to it and slightly crispy on the outsides. ?The only downside is that it's not enough of it and most pieces are just fat. ?I had the Totto spicy ramen which takes the shoyu ramen, adds in spicy chili-infused vegetable oil to give it a nice spicy kick and refreshing aftertaste. Totta also scores high marks for the appetizers. ?I had the yaki uni don which was seared uni atop a bowl of rice, very good. ?I also tried the marinated tuna sashimi atop rice with a generous sprinkling of tobiko (flying fish caviar).

Finally had the chance to actually try this ramen place with my sister after several failed attempts (actually once because I didn't read Yelp carefully enough to learn about the cash only situation). Now I totally understand why the logo of Totto Ramen is that of a chicken inside a bowl. I ordered the classic chicken broth ramen and the soup was awesome. I tried a spoonful of the soup and I felt like I being bathed with fresh chicken broth. It was full of flavor and really sweet (the sweetness of chicken, no MSG nor excessive soy sauce). It was full with generous freshly sliced garlic and two thick melt-in-your-mouth char siu and other fresh ingredients. The soup, no question, the freshest and as flavorful as it can get. My sister ordered the extra spicy ramen, which was basically the same thing accompanied by a small bowl of red concoction that needed to be mixed with the ramen. My sister loved it and since we were born in a country where spicy food were everybody food, it wasn't that spicy at all for her and for me, who tried a bit of the soup. As for me, I will stick with the classic chicken broth ramen to indulge myself in the goodness of fresh broth. We also ordered Inari (sweet tofu skin filled with sweet ginger rice) - really good, Char Siu Chunks - it was alright, I kinda expected the char siu slices that you usually got in your ramen, and Yaki Uni Don (blow torched uni served on a rice and seaweed) - really flavorful and enjoyable. My only concern was about the noodle itself. It was hands down to Ippudo for the softness and quality of the noodle. Totto's noodle was pretty stiff in my opinion, but I might be able to ask them to cook it more to make it softer next time, so I wasn't bothered since everything else is perfect. You might want to prepare to wait though. The place is small and you can only pay cash. It was raining when I visited with my sister. We waited inside for about 45 minutes before got seated (it was thursday night at around 10ish), but it was worth it. So, if you are a ramen fan, this might add to your favorite ramen place. Because sure it does for me. It is either Ippudo or Totto for me.

LOVE LOVE LOVE! Ok I think I might actually like it better than Ippudo, I know, that's like insane. ?I loved this place. ?The wait was a bit annoying (30 min Sat. 6pm) but kind of expected since Ippudo have 3 hour lines sometimes. So the place is extremely tiny, they pretty much have bar seats and only a few tables. The pork is amazing! It is fatty but it doesn't make you feel like it's too oily at all, just mouthwatering deliciousness. The broth is also quite good but not overwhelming with salt and fat. Compared to Ippudo, I liked the pork here better and the broth as well. ?I also tried their squid skewers which again was amazing. ?Very very satisfying all around. Side note, they don't do take out, delivery, or even doggie bags, so only order what you can finish. Very ODD! And cash only, which again, very annoying! ? It was also awesome to watch the cute boy work his way around in the kitchen because it is totally open to the bar so you can see everything. =)

Totto Ramen is the one ramen shop to rule them all. If you want simple ramen, go to the dozens of others in the St. Marks area, but if you want amazing, I can't believe ramen could be so good, come to Totto Ramen. And when you get there, make sure to immediately sign the board at the bottom of the steps, which serves as the waiting list. The steps leading down to Totto Ramen serves as the waiting area, with an enclosed plastic canopy to protect you from the elements and colder weather. If you are called and you're not there, they will bump you back to the bottom of the list. Parties of 4 are the maximum at a table, anything larger will be split up. My personal recommendation is to come with one other person or come solo, to be seated the quickest. When you make it in, you'll know exactly why, as there are only 10 stools at the bar, one 2-person table, and two 4-person tables. When you're finally seated, a cup of water and menu is standing on the table waiting for you. If you already had a chance to look at the menu by the entrance, good for you! Otherwise peruse the short menu or take a look at the specials plastered on the walls. When you're ready, raise your hand to get the attention of the waiter. In a few minutes, your order will be brought to you. I ordered the Totto Spicy Ramen ($10.75) which is their original homemade Paitan Ramen noodles and Original Rayu, which is a spicy sesame oil, that adds a spicy kick to an otherwise amazing ramen dish already. It is then topped with scallion, char siu pork, bean sprouts and nori (seaweed). There's so many words to describe the broth: divine, savory, rich, and most of all it's clean in the respect that it's not muddled down from the starchiness of the noodles and other ingredients. The homemade ramen noodles were amazing, albeit slightly chewy, did a great job absorbing the flavors of the broth. The char siu pork was fatty, tender, and very flavorful. Part of the that was the from the nice char that was created on it from the handheld blow torch. And back to that spicy sesame oil, unbelievably simple to add yet so delicious. That extra layer of flavor and heat, definitely upped the likability of this ramen dish tenfold. But if you don't like spicy food, their Original Paitan Ramen is just as delicious. If there is anything to dislike about this place, it may be NYC's Department of Health restaurant inspection, which gave it a C rating. I agree somewhat, as all of their food is sitting around. If you sit by the bar, you will have the chance to watch the staff work their magic, but you may find some of their methods a bit unhygienic. The huge pots of broth and the metal containers with ingredients (scallion, bean sprout, nori, etc.) are sitting less than 5 feet away from you with tops opened and exposed to whatever may fall in it. The char siu pork is sitting in an open-faced buffet tray on a top shelf near the ceiling, which doesn't look the most sanitary. When an order comes in, they simply pull the tray down, take out some pieces of the char siu pork and place it on a cooling rack. They then whip out their handheld blow torch and torch the pork to give it a nice char. When they were refilling one of the huge pots of broth, I also noticed one of the staff had sneezed. He had attempted to cover his mouth with his arm, but you could see that his arm had only got up to cover half of his sneeze. It's worth noting that he wasn't facing the pot of broth. He was turned sideways, but on one side, he had all the open pots, and on the other side, you have all the customers sitting at the bar. And if you need to use the bathroom, I recommend avoid using it here as it is the tiniest bathroom I've ever been to. There's barely any standing room in there, with the toliet on one side, and the small sink hitting you on the waist from the other side. Maybe that small ounce of dinginess could scare some customers away. But that didn't really phase me as I can overlook that and claim that Totto Ramen has one of the best ramen I've ever had. I'm salivating just thinking about this place. Prices are a lot cheaper than some more reputable places like Ippudo and portions are decent. Just remember to bring cash, as they only accept cash, no credit. If you can get over the wise-tale that ramen shops are simply no more than instant noodles (aka Maruchan), or are simply a ramen fanatic, Totto Ramen is where it's at. Unbelievably so good that I can't wait to come back again and again.

I am a regular here. Never think about to give a common here, cuz this place is always at the first position for me. There's always a line, unless there's snow storm, and if they opens. I was here in a heavy snowing day. I didn't wait lolll. ?I love the first ramen in the menu. Seriously, I can't remember the name because I never look at it and just point at it... Or the extra spicy one, they always put the spicy sauce the a small plate so I can adjust it on my own. The miso is salty for me, I won't recommend it. And I love the vegetable ramen too!

Busy crowds, even for a weekday lunch. ?The space is small, but cozy and the service is friendly. ?I had the avo tuna (didn't like this too much, don't really know why, the fish wasn't the best quality but the flavors were intense) and the miso ramen, which bordered on too salty. ? I guess I was supposed to distribute the mound of miso in the middle of my bowl, but didn't do this thoroughly enough. ?There was a meat paste in the miso, which was unexpected and may be off-putting to some.

I guess Japanese ramen is not for me. I couldn't have more than 2 bites. I ordered miso chicken soup (?). I didn't like my first bite, tried to like it having 2nd bite, then gave up. I failed three attempts before my first visit due to 1+hr wait each time; so I went around 3pm expecting no wait, and got a seat after only 15minute wait. What a disappointment. I thought I would like ramen since I love Japanese sushi/sashimi, and Izakaya foods; well, I will try at least one more place for ramen.

This place is the tiniest little hole in the wall ramen bar, but it serves an excellent, large bowl of noodles. ?My only criticism is that they could serve a bit more meat in the noodles...

I finally tried Totto. After hearing of this place from multiple sources it was time to go. I've hit all the main ramen spots around town (Ippudo, Hide Chan, Minca, Momofuku, etc..) and now I feel this is the last of the known "greats" in NYC. I was happy that I didn't wait that long. My friend and I arrived early on to catch a play nearby. Fearing we would be late, getting there at 6pm only showed a 20min wait time. ?Not too shabby. I ordered the main chicken broth ramen. I mean... its why you go there, right? ?To say the least, it was very good. My socks were not knocked off in any way, but I did enjoy it quite a bit. I much would prefer a pork-based broth like you would find elsewhere, but Totto's was very flavorful and not too heavy. ?The service was quick and friendly and in the end, we had plenty of time left over to catch our play and enjoy the night. I'd go back for sure, but its obvious this will always have a very long wait. ?So if you go... put your name down early and go have a drink around the corner at Bamboo 52.

Happy to see a ramen joint on the west side...yet another great cheap grub option pre/ post theatre. I was here with a friend around the time it first opened and almost immediately got seated (despite a looming crowd outside). AWESOME. I had the chicken paitan ramen, which I loved as I'm a hakata ramen fan and this was close to a tonkatsu. My friend had a different ramen with the more springy noodles which I loved! even though the paitan came with homemade ones. I just wished the place served more apps aside from the one dish wonder.

It was my first true Ramen experience and living in Boston which is a mediocre food city we don't get many true (insert food) experiences. Thus, I really enjoyed my meal here.

The broth here is amazing. I'm a tonkotsu fan usually, but the light yet savory chicken broth really made my day when I was here the other day. I've also never seen seasoned avocado as topping before, and was immediately addicted. Portions are Japanese-sized (ie small) but for $2.50 you can get another helping of noodles (kae-dama) and get full. And yes, it's small here so you will have to wait. People the other day were complaining and being dicks, which I never understand -- do they not realize that folks can and will mess with your food if you're an ass? I took a star off because they don't have gyoza. For a ramen place that's pretty much a sin.

Finally found an opportunity to visit when a friend was in the neighborhood for lunch last week. Totto is a Ramen Shop and don't expect much more. Perfectly executed, great flavors and the ability to "customize" your bowl. I loaded up my bowl with extra scallions, pork ?(char siu) and of course the Rayu spicy oil. ?Big fan and I will be back for more. Expect to wait for a spot as the space is small, however, turnover is quick and food is definitely worth it.

Note: ?Extremely smaller than Ippudo. ?It can only fit a handful of customers, so unless the customers are eating and moving quickly, you'll be waiting for a while. ? I say the wait is still worth the try. ?At least you have options in case you're not a fan of Ippudo. ? Oh Helpful Tip: Cash Only

How fortunate I am for yelp :) My cousin and I were visiting NY a few weeks ago and late one night we couldn't decide what to eat? Almost resorting to a diner for a quick dinner, I decided to yelp whats near and good. So, being that we were situated on 52nd St, guess what we found? Totto Ramen! which was literally a few minutes walk down the street. The business was about to close so we rushed to put on our coats and walked there. There was a very short (10 minutes?) wait since we arrived only 15 minutes before closing. Lucky us! as the average wait for this place is an hour+. I ordered the totto spicy ramen with a seasoned boiled egg: original rayu with spicy sesame oil and topped with scallion, onion, char siu pork, and a nori which for a wuss like me who can't handle spice, was the perfect amount. It gives it a refreshing kick without being overpowering. The broth and noodles really made the ramen. Very creamy and super yummy. Definitely, recommended. Came back again a few days later but was told the wait was 2 hours, yikes in NYC cold weather, no thanks. So, be sure to come super early, or half an hour before they close.

TOTTO RAM-YUM! This place is so great. I don't mind the wait because I live close by, but I do try to avoid eating at peak times. The noodles are satisfying. I love the spicy selections, and my vegetarian friends love the veggie ramen bowl too. The small starter dishes are good, anything with ahi tuna. Extra star for the great staff. The waitress with the hair bow and the ramen chefs that entertain me with the 'shake, shake, shake' of the ramen strainer. Not very expensive and great in the colder months. ? ^_^

Best ramen I've had in the city thus far (I've tried all the places in midtown). ?The menu is very minimalist (with really just a handful of ramen options), but quality trumps quantity/variety here. ?Totto's ramen is the straight kind and is firmer, springier and overall more chewy than the curly ramen staple to most other ramen shops around town. ?I'd go with the spicy ramen, which is amazing, and the miso broth can be a bit bland. ?The pork is extremely well flavored (Japanese bbq) and tender, though my favorite topping is, oddly enough, the boiled egg. The only drawback is, as others have mentioned, the limited space. ?I also didn't think the waitress was very friendly or helpful, though the ramen chefs behind the bar were always super attentive and nice. ?I've never had to wait too long here - if possible, try to get there earlier (such as when it first opens!) to beat the midtown lunch crowd. ?Later may be risky - a friend of mine had to wait an hour to get a table around 3-4pm. ?Definitely not the best place for a large group, though one time they did sit our group of 8 along the bar. ?Bottom-line: 5 star ramen, minus 1 star for "luck of the draw" wait and service.

There is nothing better than a bowl of ramen on a cold winter night when its in the teens outside. So that's when i ventured over to Totto after hearing the rave about their ramen and seeing their ridiculously long lines. ? It was about 10:20 pm when i got there but there was still a wait even for one person and i didn't get seated till 10:45. Having said that, i decided to try their spicy Ramen which was essentially their original version with spicy oil. ?The flavor was very nice but i thought the noodles were almost too al dente compared to other bowls of ramen i've tasted in the city. Totto uses a chicken stock which in the end, is never as flavorful as a pork stock esp. a la Ippudo. ?That being said, it was a good bowl of ramen and if you prefer the chicken stock which has the less fatty flavor and the lack of sickly feeling post eating. on a personal note, for the wait and price i'm paying, i'd rather go to Ippudo. Just be prepared for the long lines.

If you ever forget the address of this ramen joint, never fear as you can spot the crowds down the block. The perfect combination is the miso ramen and zuke don. Plus: the broth is not salty and wait staff is helpful Minus: the cramped space Would I come back? YES!

The line here is definitely super long. ?I waited for a long long time before we finally sat down. ?Once we sat down they took our orders really quickly. ?We sat at the bar and saw the chef make our dishes. ?The tuna appetizer is pretty good. ?Their prices are pricey for a bowl of noodles but it's well worth it. ?The flavors and noodles are different from Ippudo. ?They definitely have more toppings than the ones at Ippudo. ?The pork belly is really good here. ?Good amount of fat on it. ?Ippudo was very lean. ?Overall, it's yum!

Dare I say this? ?This might have been the best bowl of ramen I have ever had. ?Blow-torched chashu. ?Crushed garlic upon request. ?Chicken based soup. ?Oh goodness. Base rate for a bowl is $9.50, which is so much cheaper than Ippudo. ?Cash only. ?Small parties only - no more than 4 people. ?Fun to sit by the bar and watch them make the bowls of ramen and blow torch the meats. ?This is a must try for all ramen lovers. ?Worth the wait.

Is it worth the 40minute to an hour wait time? ?Unsure. ?Good, springy noodles, and flavorful, fatty char siu, but don't know that it's one-of-a-kind in NYC. ?Loved Ippudo and Menkui Tei just as much. The broth here is a bit thick and starchy (almost like congee liquid), which may have been due to the fact that we were there late in the day and it had been simmering all day. ?The avo tuna was good, but way too salty from too much soy. ?The mayo char siu bowl was good, not outstanding. ?Don't know if I would wait in this line again.

My boyfriend and I were hesitant to wait over an hour for ramen but since it was my friends choice we decided to suck it up and wait. Seating is first come, first served (if you are not there when they call you they cross your name off the list). There are only a few tables inside which is a big part of why the wait is so long. They only take cash so make sure you come prepared (there is an ATM just half a block down). Now that the administrative stuff is out of the way...the ramen is great! I really enjoyed the chicken ramen. The broth is nice and thick - think liquid chicken :) The noodles were al dente which was perfect. The meat in the chicken ramen was pork which I am not usually a huge fan of but they did a great job with it. It is very simple but very good. My boyfriend got the spicy ramen. He was a little put off by the fact that they only had two levels of spicy, hot and extreme, denoted by 2 chili peppers and like 10 chili peppers respectively. Regardless, the spicy ramen had a good amount of spice and was still tasty. I am definitely going to go here again, not sure if I want to wait an hour but I will probably do it anyway.

Authentic Japanese ramen! A small place. You put your name and number of party down on the pad hang on the door. Wait til they call you. Then go inside and sit around the noodle bar where they make your ramen in front of you! Order and wait, then your bowl of delicious ramen is there! Besides the usual miso ramen (~$11) and vegetable ramen, right now they're also offering others not on the menu: cold ramen (~$12) and niku ramen ($15, for meat lovers!). They also have spicy ramen with 2 levels of spiciness. The soup itself is not that salty. Right on. Char siu (pork) is good (too bad only 2 pieces). The marinated egg is good that the yolk has flavors too! Noodle itself, the chewy texture ones i like. Downside? Probably the wait, but in the afternoon it's okay. Hot! You're close to where they make ramen as you're eating. But it's okay for me. Price a little towards to expensive side as they don't give you much stuff besides the soup, which covers most of the bowl. Overall, this place is great! Speak Japanese to people there! They're legit Japanese! (CASH ONLY)

It doesn't matter what time of the day it is, this place is always packed with people. My friends and I went during odd hours hoping not having to wait, a few people were before us, so we waited anyway. We ordered Totto spicy ramen with extra spicy bamboo shoot and bean sprouts, best noodle ever! enough noodles to fill us up, but not too much that make us sick.

Totto Ramen is the ultimate winner of the ramen broth contests in NYC. Ippudo's broth is too oily, Santouka's is loaded with MSG and Totto's...oh my...noMSG used, so full-bodied and so many layers. Even better than Daikokuya in LA! Kudos to Totto!

Sometimes when I wait over an hour for a meal, I wonder if the food is actually as good as I am imagining it to be or if I am just so hungry that anything would taste good... Seriously though, the ramen here is amazing and worth the wait. I believe the most popular one is the spicy ramen w/ chicken. Of the sides, i would recommend the avo tuna (tuna sashimi w/ avacado). One of the times I went, they had a special that involved uni -- it was amazing. I normally don't like uni that much, but they prepared it really well. I thought the broiled char siu pork was nothing special. ?So yes, if you are a patient person, definitely visit Totto Ramen!

OMGGG - absolutely delicious!!! My boyfriend and I have passed by this ramen shop a couple of times but have been rejected because it was closing time. This place closes at 12am but the last seating is at 11pm which means you have to put your name down WAY before 11pm. Complicated, I know and we live a couple blocks away. I've been to few ramen shops in NYC and this has to be my favorite one. Ippudo has solid ramen and ambiance, but Totto Ramen has the light and savory flavor. Go with a party of 2 to Totto Ramen and leave the big parties to Ippudo. You can watch them make the chicken soup base. It was sooooo goood! The menu is simple so there's not much indecisiveness going on.

I really liked this place. I came when it first opened, so there was a pretty long wait for seating for 2 (at the bar). ?Maybe around 45 minutes? But it's in Hells Kitchen so my roommate and I walked up and down 9th for a bit and before we knew it it was our turn to eat! I thought the portions were good - the pork was delicious and the broth tasty (we both got the spicy one). But the thing I liked most about the restaurant was the atmosphere! We sat by the entrance and the whole restaurant is open and you feel like you're eating outside even though you're inside. Also - the staff there are SOOO nice, and I love that they cook the noodles in front of you. When we left the restaurant the entire staff turned and said bye and thank you to us. And it felt genuine! Like they were so happy to be working at the restaurant which had juts opened - and so happy that people were enjoying their food. Will definitely go back when I have a craving for ramen!

When I heard the name Ramen attached to a restaurant, I immediately blanched. ?All I could think of were drunk, freshmen college nights and eating microwave ramen at 3am. ?The Ramen here, however, is nothing like the prepackged salt block one finds in grocery stores. It was a cold and rainy Thursday. ?My friend really wanted Ramen, so we waited a bit and were sat at the "bar." ?I don't mean bar as alcohol; just a counter with stools attached. ?It was cool because you could watch the cooks prepare everything right in front of you. We both were starving. ?The food came out in less than 2 minutes. ?Not kidding! ?It was also packed, which is a double plus. ?Both of us ordered the spicy ramen with pork. ?Best decision ever and well worth the wait. ?The noodles were delicious and the broth was amazingly hot and spicy. ?They use a special hot, seaseme oil in most of their dishes. ?The menu has slim pickings, but honestly it has enough to pick and choose from as far as Ramen places go. ?My only complaint was that the pork was fatty, but that is to be expected. 5 starts for this place! ?Stop in if you are ever in the mood for some really good noodles!

I am a huge ramen fan and was quite excited when my friend mentioned this place to me. Hearing many good ratings on the Totto Spicy Ramen I decided to give it a try on my first time there. It did not disappoint me. The broth, which is the essential part of ramen, was made really well. It was quite spicy but very flavorful and not heavy like some ramen broths are. We also got the pork slices as an appetizer and that was very delicious as well. Most important of all, the prices are very reasonable. I will definitely try this place again!

I've been to Totto Ramen multiple times and since my first time when we asked the waitress for her recommendation on what to order, I haven't been able to order anything else. I'm shocked at the scarcity of yelpers who've talked about the seasoned avocado topping. When the waitress first told our group to go with the avocado, we were all baffled but very open-minded. Avocado?? With ramen?? But to our pleasant surprise, the creaminess of the avocado melts in with the chicken broth and makes the ramen THAT much better. I promise. Try Totto Ramen (waaay better than Ippudo or Hide-chan in my opinion). Get the avocado topping on the chicken ramen. This dish'll be something you crave all winter long!

Delicious Food and Great Service, what more can one ask for? My boyfriend and I came 15 minutes before the store opened (12pm), "reserved" a spot by signing the clipboard hanging off the door, and had seats when the doors opened. My boyfriend had wanted to sit on the bar stools instead of at the tables to the side and I am glad we did. ? At our seats, we had the honor of watching our incredibly friendly Japanese chef/waiter flame-broil our char-siu, add decadent ramen toppings, tend to the bubbling ramen stock, and serve us with so much care. ? I ordered the Chicken Ramen ($9.25), my boyfriend ordered the Super Spicy Chicken Ramen ($10.25), a shredded char-siu onigiri ($3), and an extra serving of Noodles ($+2.50). As soon as the bowl landed on the counter, my first priority was to sample the soup. ?And ohmygod, it was really, really delicious and flavorful without the help of MSG. ?The bowls look small, but I was full after consuming my meal. (Please note that I am a 100lb girl) I did not add extra toppings, because I felt the cooked minced onions, scallions, beef(or pork) bits, and char-siu were good enough for me. But maybe i'll try them next time. My boyfriend really enjoyed it too, but felt that Ippudo's noodles were a tad better (firmer). Thank you kind waiter-san! I'm sorry we could not tip you more, being that we are poor college students. ?:( Note: The spicy Ramen is the same as the regular ramen, but a dollar more for hot sauce on the side. Note2: The 5-stars is for the food and service. ?The restaurant is rather small and some may feel cramped in such a setting. If you stop by, come Early, or try to come alone--you'll get a seat quicker. If you like eating in large groups, try Ippudo instead.

eh... first of all, why is it grade C? that was a big disappointment when i first arrived and started waiting in line. the store is really small, so if you wanna try, make sure no more than 2 ppl prob. is a good idea. maybe the grading system in nyc is new and the standard is not well established, but i think it still says something ??? The broth i think is chicken based, hence chicken in a bowl on the logo? It's not as flavorful compare to the other raman shops, ie ippudo, momofuku. the broth was a bit on the lighter side, which may be better for your cardiovascular system, less fat. The spicy-sauce is really yummy i do have to say. The noodles are decent, need to let it sit in soup a bit when you first got the ramen. the meat is tender and flavorful. however, i don't know if i would wait another hour for this place though. If no wait, maybe.

as a rameniac, this place is not the best ramen i have ever had but it wasn't bad. ?im more a fan of tonkatsu broth, and unlike other ramen places, totto uses chicken broth as the base. ?it was ok but with ippudo in the city, i think i prefer ippudo over totto. ?although the menu indicates that this place does not add MSG, i assume this means the msg is already in the ingredients or something because everything was pretty salty and my boyfriend and i were pretty thirsty after we ate here.

Ramen....Yummm.... drooling thinking about Totto's spicy Ramen. ?It's the same as the Totto Chicken Paitan Ramen, but with a large scoop of spicy sauce on top of the ramen. ? The spice scoop on the side gives you a chance to taste the brooth, and then mix in the peppers as you like. ? The noodles are nice and springy, and the chashu are awesome. ?Like most of ramen places, you can also add side items, like additional egg, or spicy bamboo (very spicy). ?We also the tuna tartar, pretty good, but not great. ? The place is pretty small, and there's always a line. ?Best time to go: Weekday - Mon-Thursday, at around 4:30 -5 PM. ?This is when most people are still at work. ?We go there first, and then go back to work afterwards. ?No lines Otherwise take a late lunch - around 1 PM Don't try over the weekend.

Ok!

If you're Jewish and can't get pork belly off of your mind, this might be the place to part ways with your maker. The pork ramen is amazing here, prepared using the centuries old method consisting of a butane torch and rack technique. But even if you like veggies, you will find what you need. The shop is small and very authentic - you will think, in fact, that you are in Tokyo.

- @ 7:35pm put name down - @ 7:40pm wander aimlessly around hells kitchen/theater district wondering what there possibly is to do in the area for an hour -@ 8:20pm panic thinking they miraculously called our name early and we weren't there/head back (fully thinking it will be at least another half hour) -@8:30pm arrive back at totto and realize there is still a whole page left, much to our dismay -@9:15pm - exactly 1 hour and 40 mins (!!), get seated we got the char siu mayo don to start (as they were out of the avo tuna). it was very good. must say, that i love the use of the blow torch to get that nice color on the pork :) i had the spicy ramen with pork. my sister had the niku ramen (looots of garlic in her broth and a ridiculous amount of pork that she couldn't finish...luckily i picked up her slack :)) spicy ramen was delicious. noodles were perfect (probably the best ive had). i even really enjoyed the veggies they used (which im usually meh about). ?i tried the broth before mixing in the spicy oil and it was definitely v. tasty. must take one star off because i could only come back if i was prepared to wait. could never eat here spontaneously/if i was starving. but its really not their fault they are so popular.

OK, the wait is ridiculous (over an hour on a Wednesday night) because the place is super small and really popular, but once inside, the ramen is A-mazing at a really good price. Go and put your name on the list, then go and get coffee and come back after 45minutes!

We arrived pretty close to their opening time, so we didn't have a problem getting one of the three tables. ?There was still some room at the bar. I know a lot of people prefer the pork stock, but I have to tell you, the chicken stock blew my mind. ?I wish we could get ours to taste so flavorful at home! ?The pork belly over bean sprouts was amazing too. I went for the spicy ramen, and I was a little bummed that the spiciness came more from a black pepper flavor than a chile pepper. ?It was great nevertheless.

We had veggie, miso and original ramen. They were all good, I especially liked the miso one. But the wait and small place may not be friendly for those of us w/ kids. We went there on Monday around 4:00 and we still had to wait about 30 minutes.

I think this place is better than Ippudo. Its more authentic and has more of a ramen-house feel. Ippudo is weird--its like you are going clubbing to eat ramen. Regarding the ramen, its AMAZING. Their extra spicy ramen really isnt that spicy, its more peppery than spicy. Ive been very satisfied here each time I go. The place is very small so dont try to go here with a group bigger than 2-3. You'll have to wait a LONG time. The staff are very friendly and the cooks are entertaining to watch.

I'm not a huge fan of overpriced ramen so the thought of anything that doesn't come in a package or a set of 6, isn't dried, isn't cheap, and also isn't quickly made is not appealing to me. ?HOWEVER, I am willing to always make an exception for Totto Ramen after my experience here. Maybe this review is all situational since I had been running through the rain without an umbrella, soaked, for what seemed to be 30 minutes and the thought of anything warm was highly appealing but I think it was more than that. Totto Ramen is small... Really small, which is why you see people waiting outside all the time. It's really because there is no waiting area inside. I am lucky enough to have a boyfriend who lives right next door so all we really had to do was put our names on the list and then go back to his apartment while everyone else waited in the rain. When we came back down our seats were ready within minutes. What I love about this place is that there are only two or three chefs, all of whom work behind the counter and cook in front of you. (Secretly, I am in love with the chef named Taquito. My boyfriend doesn't know this. Secretly, I think he is in love with him too.) We had the chance to talk to him since we sat by the ramen bar and he is one of the friendliest men I have ever met even when it is late at night and he's been working all day. I would really recommend sitting at the bar. I think it adds to the experience. Normally I would say "never sit by the bar" but the Taquito's personality is infectious rain or shine, so do it.

Being new to the Asian Broth Game, I started a reconnaissance mission of sorts to find out what the big deal was. ?I didn't see what all the hype was over broth. ?If you've had one you've had them all. What do you mean Pho and Ramen are different? ?They are veritably the same thing. ?Like hell they are. ?Anyway(s), (pluralization of anyway is an Brooklyn Italian thing and really doesn't go here. ?Having said that, I'm going to leave it and let you be the judge. ?You're already judging anyway(s)). I went low end, high end and everywhere in between. ?Okay, so not really everywhere in between. ?I'm actually still on my mission. ?However, there is a difference. ?I get it now. ?I get what all the fuss is about good Ramen. ?When you find the broth that does it for you, it's kismet. ?Like this bowl of Spicy Ramen was made for me personally. ?The chef made this broth and noodles just for me and my palate. ?The flame cooked roast pork is just fatty enough without being too fatty. ?The extra hard boiled egg is the perfect addition. ?There's just the right amount of sprouts and my noodles are cooked but not overcooked. ?Imagine the stars aligning, or my ducks in a row. ?It's like that, only better. ? I'm not saying that Totto Ramen is the best Ramen. ?What I'm saying is that right now it's the best Ramen for me. ?My work is moving downtown so it won't be easy for me to get to Totto. ?Soon enough I'll have to find a new Ramen that's perfect for me. ?Until then I'll continue waiting forty five minutes for broth!

Love this place! The ramen here is awesome, my fav in the city. The noodles are really crisp and cooked just right. The chicken broth is so tastes a bit clearer than your regular ramen. Ramen usually feels really heavy for me, but I can finish this and drink the broth without feeling like it was too heavy or salty. The little rice bowls are a great alternative to getting the ramen. Sometimes I just get 2 of these and they're only $4.50! Amazing!~ One downside is the popularity of this place. I have to go at 11:40 to put my name down on the paper for when it opens at 12pm.

1) the NOODLES: AMAZING. perfect chewiness and springiness. best non high end ramen (eg: momfuku) 2) the BROTH: meh. i got the miso ramen. it's...different. a unique taste i cant put my finger on. not smack-your-lips-and-slurp-up-the-whole-bowl delicious, but good. 3) the TOPPINGS: ?love watching them char the pork with the mini blow torch. hehe. great tender texture, perfect ratio of fatty parts to meaty parts. as for everything else, they got the usual: corn, hardboiled egg, spicy bamboo shoots, etc 4) the PRICE: comprable. $10 ish. not a big variety of flavors (eg: Men Kui Tei) , but you MUST try their off-menu cold ramen. sesame dressing (no soup), cucumbers, shredded chicken (a bit dry), not unlike a chinese cold sesame noodle. got in a big debate with dining buddies over which is more important: broth or noodles? and since i am partial to the broth, i'm gonna stick to the cold ramen from here on out.

went here on a saturday night...and the wait is as long at ippudo.... ONE hour long wait.... when we nearly sat down, they had closed off their list. ? i was disappointed in one respect...the noodles were a bit on the thick side and a little starchy....this place does not reign supreme over ippudo. ?the broth is much lighter because it's made with chicken...and has it's own distinct flavoring. ?i do like the spiciness... and got it extra hot. ?(they basically give you hot sauce on the side so you can add as much as you want). ?on the flip side, i do like their char siu pork, torched on top. ? after waiting an hour, i definitely sucked up the bowl of noodles (but not all of it!)....and soup. ?What can I say, i was hungry. it was definitely worth the price....but for $5 more...i can get the best. ?good experience, but i don't think i'll be coming back here.

Horribly overrated - extremely long wait times and they don't call you so to make sure you don't miss your spot, you basically have to stay there for hours at a time. The pork was 99% fat, 1% lean meat and therefore impossible to eat; broth was similarly fatty and made me sick after. Way way overrated - not worth the 2 hour wait.

Long wait. I mean- really long and they don't even do take-out or let you take a doggie-bag when you're done eating but it's so good that I give it a 5. It's that much better than Ippudo and for less money. We live in Murray Hill so we have to cab it to get to this Hells Kitchen restaurant but it's worth it. We live near other Japanese noodle spots but nothing has impressed us more than Totto Ramen.

It's an authentic Japanese Ramen place in midtown Manhattan. Nothing surprise. the place is quite small that you may have to wait for table for 2 like 30 minutes during the lunch and dinner time. Soup is tasty but salty, so if you can't handle salty taste, tell them less salty and less miso paste on your Ramen order. There is a Okay Japanese restaurant own by Chinese right next door, where you can have some sushi rolls if a bowl of ramen can't make you full enough.

I had the Totto Chicken Paitan Ramen the other day. The soup base tasted clean and not too heavy but flavorful at the same time. I was surprised how perfectly tender the chicken was. Not tough at all! We had a party of 3, and had to wait a little bit but not too long.

The ramen here was delicious. ?I was able to try the totto miso ramen (a go-to broth for me) and my friend's totto spicy ramen (chicken broth with spicy sesame oil). ?The miso totto ramen included a scoop of ground pork, a few slices of char siu pork, scallions, bean sprouts, and onions. ?The ground pork was a little salty for my taste, but the char siu was delicious. ?It was very fatty, but the fat made it so tender and rich. ?The broth was possibly the best part of my ramen. ?It wasn't too salty, and supposedly made sans MSG- a healthy addition to this very unhealthy meal. As for the totto spicy ramen... it was quite delicious, just a bit too spicy for me. ?My nose started running a bit, and I stopped being able to taste the broth for anything other than just spice. ?It was also plainer than my miso bowl. ?There was an omission of the ground pork and the egg, though I would have missed neither. We also tried the char siu onigiri, which was the appetizer special. ?Not really worth mentioning. ?Maybe the ramen was just too good.

I've eaten here twice and it got better the second time round. I'm not a fan of pork-based broth so this place suits my place perfectly since it's a chicken-based broth. You can select the spiciness levels, which isn't a new concept but one I've missed tremendously. The noodles were springy and the broth was rich. Blow-torched char siu's just fun to eat too. I like the teeny tiny hole-in-a-wall setup of this place. Makes me feel somewhat closer to Japan. :) There was no wait to get in and the ramen chef was really friendly. My husband and I were entertaining ourselves with a conversation with him (and we were even offered more char siu because they made too much).

My only real experience with ramen is with the cheap packaged stuff that we all subsisted on as college students. While I'm not a ramen expert, I know what I like and I liked Totto Ramen quite a bit. Their signature dish is a bowl of rich chicken broth with homemade ramen noodles topped with some scallions and a couple of slices of heavenly fatty pork (pork belly, I believe). Along with some edamame and a cold Sapporo, this was a satisfying meal. The person I dined with had the spicy ramen, which has spicy sesame oil drizzled on top. The little taste I got convinced me that I'll have to try the spicy variety the next time I can get myself to NYC. Beyond the food itself, I really enjoyed the whole experience of the Totto Ramen. The interior, below street level, is energetic but intimate and feels like its own little world. I was ?a few yards from 52nd Street, but felt like I could just as well been in a ramen bar in Tokyo. The staff is busy and get to the point, but are nevertheless quite polite and friendly.

I highly recommend their Spicy Ramen for those who can handle spice pretty well. ?Their ramen is delicious ramen - not too hard and not too soft. Also, their chasiu pork is yummy! Add the cheese corn as topping, it's sweet and adds nice flavor to your hot and spicy bowl of ramen!!! Come slightly before dinnertime and there'll be no lines. ?Otherwise, the wait could be pretty long. ?It's a small place, so can't fit many people at the same time. ?Definitely worth the wait though! Great customer service. ?Even better if you're a regular =)

My favorite ramen spot! If you're looking for good ramen this place will not let you down. Except if you're going on the weekend expect a 45-1hr wait. Ever since it got popular several months ago the wait has gotten longer (still not as bad as ippudo). I always get the miso or the spicy ramen, it's a good time. **Update: The wait is now just as bad if not worse than ippudo. I went the other night and was slightly disappointed with the noodles (a little too al dente for my taste). Changing my rating to 4 stars due to slight lack of consistency and longer waits. By the way beware, they do NOT do take-out. I saw a lady who begged and begged only to get turned away.

After about a 30 minute wait for lunch, my friend and I sat down at the bar and ordered. ? While we waited for our food (I ordered the Spicy Ramen, which is amazing and surprisingly spicy for only 2 hot chilies! ), we watched the chefs broil the sliced pork belly with a hand torch. ? That was love at first sight. ?We knew we wanted extra and got it after tasting the fatty deliciousness in our own bowls. ?The guy heard it was our first time there and happily gave us extra slices! ?The pork is melt in your mouth, not in your hands goodness. ? All I want is to have a plateful of the pork. ? I'm already planning to go back tomorrow! ?Everyone who worked there was super friendly! ?This place is definitely the best ramen place around the area.

FOOD: I was disappointed that they don't have dumplings as an appetizer. Instead i found rice balls, which was kind of odd. For ramen, I ordered their signature ramen (forgot the name). It was the right spiciness, and nice "KOKU" (thickness) to the soup. The noodles were not "CHIJIRI MEN" (frizzy/curly noodles) which most ramen shops in Japan use and which I like because it has more "KOSHI" (Springy al-dente texture). Instead they use straight noodles. I liked the ABURI (torched) pork bellies, because they are fatty and just melts in your mouth. DRINKS: was there for lunch time, not sure if they have more than beer and some sake. SERVICE: No complaints. DECOR: OK, just a ramen joint. Very small. a couple of seats at the counter and 2-3 tables. that's all. OVER ALL: I went there for lunch, and there was a line outside at 12:05. It was a cold day and waited 30min to get in. But it was all I needed. warm bowl of ramen.

Okay, you've read the reviews by now. Yes, the ramen is yummy, the broth rich and creamy, the char su is to die for... But a 2 hour wait on a freezing Friday night? I love ramen but that love does not encompass a ?2-hour-long wait. I'll come back to this place during off-peak time. Also, I found the portions were much smaller than other ramen places. My guy friends all ordered extra noodles. Bottom line: 5 stars for the food (although portions are small) but 1 star for the long wait.

Ever had Ramen at a Ramen restaurant? ?I assure you, it is not the same as Oodles of Noodles or any other packaged Ramen you might have had as a child. ? I didn't know what to expect on my first venture to Totto Ramen. ?I had walked past this spot multiple times and was always intimidated by the line/crowd that seemed to gather around it. ?Today, I worked up the courage and waited. First of all, the wait can be considerable. ?I went at 12:40, the heart of the lunch-crowd, and waited 25 minutes before getting seated at the bar. ?The most important thing is to remember to Sign-In when you get there. ?Bring a book and wait it out, it's well worth it. My name was finally called and I took a seat at the bar, right in front of the chef. ?Warning: ?this place is small, it's hectic, and it's loud. I took a look at the menu and the specials that were written on pieces of paper and taped to the wall, then ordered the Spicy Ramen for $10. ?I watched as the two chefs quickly made my meal, pouring broth from a HUGE vat on the stove into a ramen bowl, then adding freshly cooked noodles, spicy oil, chopped scallions, bean sprouts, and a few slices of broiled pork. ?Within minutes of ordering, my food was steaming and sitting in front of me. I dove in immediately. ?This was without a doubt one of the best soups/meals I have ever tasted. The pork - delicious. ?The noodles - cooked al dente and perfect. ?The broth - wow. Seriously, if you have some time and are willing to sit out the wait, go here. ?It's legit and worth every minute of your time.

It's a small place but the waiting can take up to an hour just to get a seat. I don't mind it at all for as long as I can get good ramen in NYC.

The door guy sucks & is slow. The cook staff is quick & attentive. Not too sure if the food is worth the hour wait, but it is damn good. (Maybe a tad better due to the wait/starvation/cold weather.) I had the niku, which was huge and super meaty. The bf had spicy pork ramen. I found the spicy pork to be more peppery than spicy, but I kind of expected it based on reviews. I wish the ramen came standard with more veggies/corn/egg instead of it being all add-ons. The broth made the ramen, not the substance. It was just good to me, but my bf thought it was great. Since this is my review, only 3 stars. Hah!

First time I ate here the line wasn't that long but 2nd time? i had to wait for 1.5 hour. My friend was so curious about this place since he was told they had good food. The ramen for meat lover was just ok, spicy ramen was xoxo either...nothing special. The soup actually tasted like instant noodle. The service was not really fast and those servers should speed their work to make the line shorter. The place is actually not really comfortable...it's just way too small to keep a lot of customers. If you ask me whether i would come back to eat here again...I would say no if i have to wait that long. It's just not worth my time.

Lemme tell you about Totto's. One time I went here to get a late dinner and the line was super long and I didn't want to wait for food, so I left. The next time I went to Totto's, I went a little earlier and I didn't have to wait that long. I put my name on the list and in 10 minutes tops, my friends and me were in. Thanks to the recommendation of Haku behind the counter, I got the spicy ramen. I was scared it was going to be scorching, but it wasn't THAT spicy, but then again I can handle my spice pretty well. Next time, I'm getting the super spicy ramen. Awww yeah! Haku was quite a character and he was cracking jokes as he served us. I'm definitely going to be coming here a lot but before those crazy hours where there's hour long waits :(. But then again the ramen is really good, so who knows? I might actually be willing to wait for an hour for a bowl. That says a lot about this place especially since I'm impatient when it comes to my food.

I hate to be the one to say this, but I honestly liked Ippudo better. No doubt, this place has really good ramen, and when I was sitting there eating it, I thought it was so great (because the wait was an hour and a half, and I was starving by then). But now, thinking about it, I think I enjoyed Ippudo a lot more. I got the Totto Spicy Ramen (which was NOT spicy AT ALL by the way) with chicken. The chicken was super dry. But I think everyone should go here to compare it with Ippudo and see for themselves. Oh, and they don't call you when your table is ready like Ippudo does. So even though Ippudo's ramen is more expensive, I think I'd rather pay the extra money to not have to wait outside and have them call me instead.

Definitely worth the walk up from Times Square. I got the spicy ramen, which was delicious. The flavors were very well adjusted: just enough spiciness without overpowering the taste of the soup base. And the texture of the ramen was nice and chewy. The pork pieces were cooked and then touched up with a blow torch, which gave the surface a slight crisp without overdoing the inside. The portions are a bit small, but you can order extra noodles at the end to add to your leftover soup, i.e. kae-dama. There's not too much seating space, so it's best to come here early or at off times, though coming here at two in the afternoon didn't help in my case.

This place is amazing! My friends and I had a hard time finding it because it was raining and the place was tiny but we finally found it. The wait was long because we were a party of four but people who come in a party of one gets seats easier. The place is quite tiny but their food is amazing! Best ramen I've ever had. I'm definitely going back !

Oh my chicken paitan ramen! Yum yum yum! Have waited a while to come here because the seemingly never-ending line is pretty intimidating. But finally, one less than freezing day, I ventured out to brave the wait with a group for lunch at 1:30pm...on a Monday...stilll a 1 hour wait. ?I was so excited to finally experience what all the hype was about. I ordered the Totto Chicken Paitan Ramen. This broth is apparently made with whole chickens and it has insanely delicious chicken flavor. Portions were reasonable but not a lot of noodles. There are some extreme spice options on the menu that I'm sure will excite some people. But an hour wait...seriously? It would be 5 stars if I could sit down in 20 mins. Maybe I'll try coming at opening next time!

Cash only, no take-out, no delivery. Waited an hour and a half for a table for 2 on Friday night. Got the Niku Ramen, which is their special pork ramen. The soup was very garlicky but there was a lot of pork. The pork belly was tender and very good but the char siu was a little burned and bitter tasting. The broth was very good though. Add some chili pepper and that adds another dimension to the soup. The noodles were excellent, probably some of the best noodles I have tried in NYC. Also tried the torched sea urchin over rice and it was pretty fresh but burned on top. They seem to like torching things here. Overall if the char siu was better it would raise the stars to 4-5 range but if I am going to wait 1.5 hours for any meal, I want it to be spectacular.

I came here at 1145 am and there was already a line waiting! ?But with the cold and rainy weather makes it the perfect time to have some ramen. I had the totto spicy ramen with avocado topping. It was really good and I highly recommend it. The broth is very savory so the spicy sesame oil is a good addiction cause you won't get tired if eating it too quickly. The avocado was a nice sweet addition :)

Was craving ramen for almost the entire day and looked to yelp to give me a little guidance....I finally settled on Totto; and I'm so glad I did. There was a crowd of people waiting under the tent in the stair well area...so I did have to wait for about 25 minutes...but it was well worth it. Had the extra spicy chicken ramen with some veggies added (seaweed & bamboo too). It was delicious....and the service is impeccable. This won't be my last visit...

Maybe I was just too full to really enjoy what i ate but compared to Ippudo, the broth at this place just doesn't compare. ?The noodles are the same type as what they serve at Ippudo but for some reason, the night I had the ramen at Totto, it tasted undercooked. ?The waiter did not ask whether I wanted chicken or pork so it defaulted to pork (I figure since it's chicken ramen, it'll default to chicken, I guess I was wrong)....however I was glad that the pork came as I have to say, they try to set themselves apart from grilling the pork but it made the distinction between fat and meat more distinct...meaning it was more apparent that I was chewing on fat and thus less enjoyable. ?I admit I was suckered in by the long wait but after the wait, my expectations also increased only to be met with slight disappointment.

Knocked off a star for it turning me into frozen poultry and the guy butchering my name! Ordered the Miso and the Spicy Ramen Kaedama for both and we were stuffed! The pork was fatty but sooooooo friggin good. Two slices of it in my ramen was NOT enough! MOAR PLOX!!!! I would definitely return minus the hoard of people in my way to my ramen. Definitely way better than Ippudo!

Yes, a long wait. It can be tiring, boring, frustrating and almost kind of embarrassing to be waiting that long for something you can slurp up in less than 15 minutes but that's exactly what happened for me. We put our names down and after walking around, playing games, and people watching for a hour, we finally got a seat at the bar and immediately ordered so we can stuff our faces asap. I'm not that picky about ramen but I know what I like. Just based on what I witnessed and smelled, for some reason I was expecting to be let down. The aroma just didn't hit me with the same kind of love like other places but I was instantly proven wrong cause I didn't even stop for a sip of water until I finished the last drop of broth. I ordered the extra spicy pork ramen and the cook behind the counter was trying to warn me that it can be very spicy but I joked about how I was Korean and I can handle it. And I was proven right, it wasn't all that spicy at all. So maybe next time I'll ask for some extra spicy seasoning. The portion was near perfect and though the flavors were a tiny bit on the lighter side for me, I still enjoyed it immensely. Side note: bathroom is smaller than the ones on airplanes.

My favorite place for Ramen. Food and atmosphere make for this to be a great experience every time. All soups are great but the Meat Lovers is my favorite (If you like spicy soup then ask for a side of the spicy sauce on the side as you can make it to your liking and it can be shared with your party) Sea urchin over rice awesome, Some sort of squid on a stick was mediocre, The avocado to top off your soup is AMAZING! ?The waiting list can be a little annoying but it is worth it. ?I waited 2 1/2 hours once and it was worth it. Put your name on the list and go grab a drink at one of the area bars or even get some fries at the burger place next door as an appetizer.

Best ramen I've ever had. ?Other places come close but none can beat TOTTO.

I thought it was awesome up until the moment the cook sneezed in his hand and IMMEDIATELY picked up some veggies to put in someone's ramen. I almost puked right there. I was sitting at the bar less than 2 feet from where this happened. I already ate and paid at that point, but now will probably never go back. I realize this happens in restaurants sometimes, but not so blatantly! I will stick with Ippudo -much, much better.

I could tell this was a popular place from the crowd standing outside, but luckily, my friend lived nearby and was able to get a reservation an hour or two beforehand. I would say the wait was around 90 mins for a prime time on Saturday and they don't take reservations by phone so go early, get a reservation, and then wander around midtown. We both got the spicy Totto ramen and were full before finishing our bowls of noodles. The setting was perfect for catching up with a friend but the food and service weren't terribly memorable (the waiters wouldn't refill my water unless I stopped them). Ippudo still has my vote for best ramen!

Who wouldn't love jamming to Keyshia Cole while slurping an intense bowl of paitan ramen? The torched pork belly, the chicken miso soup, and the al dente ramen were key ingredients that triggered an existential foodie moment for me.

This wasn't my choice of Ramen from Japan. I give two stars because of their quality noodle, toppings and added A/C. Problem was thta their Chicken(Paitan) Ramen's base. ?Paitan means clear soup but this wasn't clear anymore. Ramen base is their life and whole thing, almost. I tried both Chicken and miso ramens. The concentrated soup flavor didn't work and stayed in my throat and stomach for a while.(Unlike Ippudo's Tonkotsu soup base) Probably, grease comes up on top of the soup should be removed little more or work on the smell. ?(I like fatty soup and fatty food, though) I ate all noodle and toppings but left most soup that I usually emptie it. Little later I had to go for second dinner. Their noodles are very good in flavor and texture as well as all toppings. ?However, the soup base killed all the good ingredients. I understand that "Totto(name) has to use chicken base" but it could be better. More problem was their staffs or related people. They were sitting on the entrance steps(outside) and eating and drinking. ?Also, some of the staffs outfit somehow improper as restaurants. This kind of restaurant can be very casual and staffs can be same but they exceed the border line. It is not too late to fix up this small problems and they could make this ramen place little better.

The first thing I notice is the atmosphere, but it's the last thing I care about. Efficient wait system, put you name on the list hanging at the door. Open cooking area that gives you a good look at the big vat of fresh chicken broth being made and roast pork being seared in front of you. Nice. The kitchen is small but they turn out the bowls fast. I ordered the Chicken Paitan Ramen For a chicken broth, this was excellent. Just the right fatty content for a chicken broth. There was some rice floating around, which was just weird and distracting. The pork was good, but could have been a little more moist. Searing shouldn't dry it out, such is the point of searing. There was a good fat content though, so that saved it a bit. The noodles were very good. Cooked just right, they start out a little hard, but that what you want. Quickly they start soaking up the broth and get perfect. If the start out soft, they are a soggy mess by the end. The seasoned egg was excellent, but should be served as two halves. Also, you need to order it as an extra, it doesn't come standard. At $10 a bowl, it should be included. Boo. Service was attentive. Rating: Will definitely be back. Hopefully they'll have a pork broth for the fall. http://nycramenaddict.bl…

I stumbled upon Totto Ramen recently while looking for another nearby place, which no longer exists, and it was an extremely fortunate discovery! ?This place exemplifies the expression of "hole in a wall," maybe even under a wall...but it is one of the best places that can be found in the area! To start, the quality of the items on the menu is amazing. ?There are six main items on the menu, and what impresses me is that half of the menu is vegetarian! ?Which is a factor that I think makes this a solid choice. In my visit I had the "Totto Spicy Ramen," it was delivered very quickly and was nice and hot, which was a perfect change from the cold weather outside. ?For the brave of heart I would recommend adding extra spicy sesame oil, though a word of warning: I have a good taste for spicy food and can certainly endure a high amount of spice, but with only a 2 chili rating on the menu, that is definitely very spicy! ? The only downside I can see, is that it would be very problematic to bring a large group to Totto Ramen since it is quite small and there is limited seating. ?But, this aspect to me is also a positive because it is a place that is perfect to have an intimate meal with somebody because it is quiet and personal. On a side, and very important note, only cash is accepted at Totto Ramen, so come prepared! ?For two, you can expect to have a full meal with drinks for $30, before tips. Overall I had an extremely positive experience, and definitely plan to return in the near future. ?I definitely suggest going to Totto Ramen.

I am probably in the minority here but I was kind of disappointed with this place. I was really excited about Totto Ramen because I'm a huge ramen fan as well as a fan of Yakitori Totto. Plus it's right down the block from where I live. But I thought the noodles were on the firm side for my tastes and the broth tasted kind of like instant shin ramen noodles (this is the spicy ramen). Maybe next time I should try something else but I haven't managed the patience to wait in line since. Take a pass on this place and try Ippudo downtown instead.

I was a bit bummed when I stopped by Pure Thai Shophouse with an out-of-town guest and they were not open, so I figured I'd check the line at Totto Ramen. ?Shockingly there was none, so we stopped in and immediately got a table (Wednesday, 3:15 PM). ?Now it was pushing 90 degrees outside which may have kept folks away, but we were not deterred. ?Two bowls of spicy ramen arrived almost immediately after we ordered them and we were in heaven. ?We were sweating like the proverbial lady of the evening in a house of worship, but we were in heaven nonetheless. ?The bowls are huge and the flavors are even bigger. ?Worth a visit for sure.

Totto ramen Tottora men Totora men Totoro men Totoro noodles? Grin. No longer able to avoid its magnetic pull for ramen-goers in the city, Scott and Mike decide to let natural forces do their thing and draw them in to eat some ramen. Of all the places I've been to so far, Totto has the most ramen-ya feel to it: a narrow space only a few feet wider than I am tall, dominated by a long bar along which customers are quickly tossing back bowls of ramen with quick flicks of their wrists. The décor is an afterthought, if it exists at all, which should be the aim of every good ramen bar. We started with an appetizer of seared tuna served over a bed of bean sprouts with sliced avocado and minced garlic. This was good, but not exceptional. Unfortunately Totto doesn't have tonkotsu on its menu, breaking my streak yet again, so I opted for the chicken paitan ramen while Scott ordered the miso. The paitan broth is a chicken/soy mixture; a little murkier and more textured than plain chicken stock, but nothing out of this world. At first the noodles were al dente, but by one to two minutes in they had already flip-flopped like a politician between a primary and a general election and gone soft. I know the laws of ramen thermodynamics are incredibly complex to even the most seasoned ramen veterans, but you'd think a ramen rocket scientist would be able to figure out how to make and cook noodles such that they could survive in broth for at least five minutes. They were also straight, which always makes me a little sad inside. The pork, however, was great. Although the shape is different from what you'll get at most ramen joints - more rectangle than oval - the meat is every bit as tender and as evenly distributed with fat as what you'll find at the best places. The remaining toppings were mostly standard. The miso ramen followed suit accordingly, save for the clump of miso that was served sitting atop the broth. Totto is a tiny place and it doesn't take reservations, so if you arrive fashionably late you can expect a wait of about an hour. Better to play it safe and get there squarely before 7 pm. If you come on a scorching summer day be prepared find it almost as sweltering inside as it is outside. To Totto's credit it's one of the few places that serves a decent bowl of ramen for under $10. It's ridiculous that I need to flag this when talking about ramen, but such is the New York scene. Totto left us satisfied, but puzzling over why it is hailed as one of the best ramen shops in the city as we returned to scouting out the remaining locations on our quest. In the meantime weekly ramen continues its pilgrimage along the manifold path to noodle soup nirvana.

Delicious Ramen. It's often a wait to get in. The menu is small. But the food is delicious. I don't know if I know of a better lunch in midtown. The noodles have a lovely bite to them.

I thought I'd try a new ramen place. Going by Yelp reviews, this came out near the top. But my experience here was horrible. First off, the wait is still 50 minutes, and that's if you get there right at 5pm. There is just one bench to sit on and you have to stand around if you didn't get a seat on it. Forget it if you're later than 5pm. Secondly, the vast majority of you will end up eating at the bar, on high bar stools. The ramen chef by the door was totally drunk and kept telling us he'd been drinking since 8am. And his behavior really showed it. I'm not sure it's a good idea to play it off as being cool by telling your customers this. Our waitress was sweet but really didn't speak English well, at all. I had ordered two beers and only received one. She never came back to us so you just end up asking whoever is around. What really got me was the fact that all the pork is pre-cooked. It's not cooked to order. You can see all the slices for the night stacked in rows on the counter. And the second chef from the door sits there with a blow torch, either warming the pieces up or maybe he's charring the edges? I wasn't sure what he was doing. They do that to a few pieces and then assemble your ramen in a bowl. It's like an assembly line. Not even close to what you would see in Japan. But the cherry on top for this night was when we paid the bill. This is the absolute truth, and I was completely floored by what happened, but after we put our cash in the tray, we were gathering up our stuff and the bus boy asked if we were done. I said yes, and he looked at the amount we paid and actually told me "It is customary to leave 15%-20% tip." The bill was $38.00 and we had left them a $5 tip. Considering how long we waited and how we were treated I actually thought we were being generous. He didn't think so and stood there waiting for me to actually give them more money! Seriously?!?! That is so rude!! I've never, ever had that experience at any establishment, here or in LA. It was really unbelievable.! And so NOT JAPANESE. In Japan, you don't tip anywhere in the country! To expect a tip is just plain ridiculous. I will NEVER go back to this restaurant. EVER. Wouldn't recommend this place to anyone I know. Would rather wait 2 hours to eat at Ippudo.

A few months back, I heard that Totto Ramen added a new addition to the menu that didn't exist during my initial visit. ?They now have something called "Totto Extreme Spicy Ramen". ?They rated it at 9.5 red peppers as opposed to their regular "Totto Spicy Ramen" which is rated at a puny two red peppers on their menu. ?In my initial review, one of the problems I had with the spicy ramen here was that they used a spicy oil that although tasty, was more oily then it was spicy. ?The Totto Extreme Spicy Ramen resolves that problem. ?Your ramen order comes with a shot glass amount of a oil based red pepper paste on the side so that you have control of the heat level. ?This paste is much thicker and less oily then the original recipe. ?It is also much more fragrant, spicier, and have a slight charred/black pepper aftertaste to it that was rather pleasant. ?If you love spicy ramen and could take more heat then most people, I whole heartedly recommend that you give this dish a try. Besides adding a spicier ramen to the menu, Totto ramen seems to have upped their game in many different other aspects of their restaurant. ?Here are a few I noticed: Whereby in the past when they put in two paper thin delicious pieces of pork, they now provide you with a much thicker cut of meat, although now it's one instead of two pieces. ?Still among the best ramen pork meat anywhere in NYC. I had a sample of my friend's miso based ramen and I have to say that it tastes pretty different from what I remembered during my prior visit. ?The soup base is now thicker and with a fuller body that is better at coating their excellent, springy noodles with it's flavor. They now have appetizers. ?Some are not on the menu but they have it. ?Just look at the wall area near the bar to see what is available. With all these improvements while maintaining their enthusiastically friendly and polite customer service, I am now upping the review to 4 stars.

This is actually my second time visiting Totto Ramen, and now I understand why people are willing to wait, sometimes up to 2 hours (T_T) for a bowl of ramen! ?My last visit wasn't memorable, but I think it was because I didn't get the extra extra spicy ramen, which has about 10 hot chili pepper signs after the name on the menu. ?The nice thing is they give you the spice on the side so you can regulate how much you want to put in, but i think i put most of the hot sesame oil they gave and the ramen was out of this world! ?The spices def gave the ramen a nice kick and I think it's fair to say the ramen is even better tha Ippeudo's! ?I have cravings for Totto's ramen already and it's only been two days..

I first tried to eat at Totto Ramen for dinner last Saturday. We put our name down on the list hanging from the door, and after waiting half an hour, we still weren't seated. We asked how much longer the wait would be and were told that it would be about 40 minutes more. Since we had a Broadway show to catch after dinner, we decided to go somewhere else for dinner. Fast forward two days later. My sister and I tried again on Labor Day, and as expected there was a wait. I guess it's not hard to be popular when the food is good and your restaurant only seats 18 people max. This time we lucked out and we were seated within 30 minutes. We started with the Labor Day special, RA MUSUBI (Japanese rice ball). At this point we were starving so the rice ball was the perfect size appetizer and had us anticipating our ramen. http://www.yelp.com/biz_… My sister and I love spicy food, so we both opted for the TOTTO EXTREME SPICY RAMEN. http://www.yelp.com/biz_… The Extreme had the appeal of 9 chili peppers next to it's name on the menu, while the Totto Spicy Ramen only had 2 chili peppers. When the ramen arrived, there was spicy sauce in the bowl but we were also given some extra spicy sesame oil sauce on the side (how thoughtful!). I usually prefer tonkotsu broth with my ramen, but Totto's signature chicken broth was very satisfying with the spicy sesame oil mixed it. The three thin slices of pork were perfectly fatty and tender and the noodles were al dente. I liked the addition of bean sprouts, which I don't usually see in ramen, but provided a good break from the spiciness. Even if you can handle spicy, I wouldn't dump all of the extra sauce in the bowl. Instead I recommend adding some sauce to each bite of noodles. That way you can really taste the spiciness and flavor of the sauce and you're not left with undrinkable soup at the end of the meal. All in all, I think Totto Ramen does a good job of standing out from the other top ramen places in the city. I like that their spicy ramen is a permanent fixture on their menu instead of an occasional daily special like at Ippudo. I'm still loyal to Minca but if there isn't a long wait I wouldn't mind stopping in for another bowl of Totto's Extreme Spicy Ramen.

I didnt love it. After all the hype and how it is SO much better than Ippudo, i didnt really love it. I had the veggie ramen with an egg and I thought that it was just regular. We lined up for over 30 mins and I am just not sure if i would go back.

THIS PLACE HAS THE BEST RAMEN EVER. my sister and i came here last week...i arrived at 5:30, and there was already a short line forming. i left the line because my sister was late, and when we returned at around 6:30, we had to wait for 20-30 minutes. but it's totally worth it. we both got the spicy ramen, and we shared a yaki uni don (torched sea urchin over rice). the uni don was amazing...the uni had its fresh flavor, but was also given a little bit of texture and smokiness because it was torched. perfect with the rice and seaweed. and the ramen...oh man. let's start with the broth. just the right saltiness and spicyness. rich chicken flavor. i drank all of it. now the noodles...just the right firmness! and the toppings...seaweed, scallions, and pork slices. the pork was so fatty and delicious! so if you're looking for a nice satisfying ramen, this place will go above and beyond. it's small though, so if you can, get there before 6! and cash only.

Holy ramen, Batman! This place is delicious. The boyfriend is convinced that Totto Ramen is better than Ippudo even though he's never had Ippudo and you know, I kind of agree with him. Don't get me wrong, Ippudo cranks out some delicious ramen, but now that I've had the chance to try other ramen places in NYC, I don't know if it's worth the money anymore. So, if you're in the midtown west area and are looking for a delicious bowl of ramen, look no further! Totto Ramen is your place. Sure, it's a small establishment and the wait can get kind of crazy sometimes, but the turnover is quick and the ramen is worth it. I ordered the miso ramen and it is so freakin' good. When I think of miso, I think of the super salty, watery soup that comes before you get your sushi dinner. But this soup is amazingly delicious. It is rich, flavorful and I couldn't get enough of it. It has a very deep flavor and I swear, with every spoonful the soup tasted better and better. Make sure to mix in that blob of miso and ground pork on top of your ramen completely to get the full effect of delicious flavors. The noodles are thicker and wavier; it has just the right amount of bite to it. But I think the star of the bowl was the char siu. It is fatty, tender, melt-in-your-mouth delicious. The chefs use a blow torch to broil the sides of the meat so there's a slight char to it. OH YES. Please remember to order extra pork belly because two pieces will not be enough. Trust me, it's worth it. You can thank me later. The boyfriend had the miso ramen for lunch the day before, so he ordered the pork belly over rice with yuzu mayo and a plate of pork belly. It sounds like a lot of pork belly, but it really isn't because it's just so damn good. You eat one slice and you find yourself wanting more and more and more. It literally melts in your mouth. The yuzu mayo was really good with the pork and the rice. Ingenious combination of flavors. The service was also great. Despite the cramped quarters, the servers are attentive and friendly. Even though everyone is bumpin' elbows and knees, we are all there for the same reason: a great bowl of ramen and Totto Ramen definitely delivers.

yumm! small tiny ramen place - the wait really wasn't that bad.. i went around 2pm? on a thursday and it was only about a 30 min wait. the ramen was not as salty as ippudo and the prices were a bit cheaper than ippudo. but those seats! were not comfy...i got the totto spicy ramen and found it had just the right amount of spice to it with perfectly cooked al dente noodles! i like this place more than ippudo since it seems less restaurant-y. def will be coming back when i get my ramen cravings!

Delicious and satisfying. You get to pick from a list of 5-6 base ramens that comes with its own topping but there is also an additional listing of toppings in which allows you to customize. Being the over-greedy ramen eating person that I am, I started with the Spicy ramen with Pork, added a boiled egg, spicy bamboo and extra seaweed. My friend and I also ordered the Ahi Tuna (marinated in sake maybe?), which was also really the bomb diggity. But be sure to go early if possible, with minimal seating areas in the restaurant, the line gets pretty backed up.

New ramen place that is near me..I finally got to go here and had to wait an hour. I guess the best way to get seated is go at 430 before they open and make sure you get in as the first round of people being seated. I think this place seats less than 25 people in general. The food comes out super fast and they don't rush you. The noodles are diff than at ippudo, and is more chinese than japanese ramen. They have small side dishes that are yummy for less than $4. The pork isn't as good quality as ippudo which is why ippudo still wins, but i do love the egg they put into the ramen (they should put slits in it to soak up the soup more) but the broth is really good.

Small place, long wait, simple menu, no dessert. ? I ordered the miso ramen and thought the broth was better than Minca. ?The miso wasn't as salty as I expected. ?I don't know if I went on a off night at Minca or not. ?I also ordered the corn with cheese. ?It was grilled corn with a slice of cheese. ? I don't think I would order that again. ?They got one menu item that has a lot of chili peppers on it, which I will try next. ?Even though this place was small I can relax in here.

It's like magic. ?They can seriously put a packet of top ramen in that broth and sell it for $50, people will still wait in line. ?You can tell there's a lot of heart and soul in the broth - and it shows. ?Even though the wait can be a bit atrocious, it's definitely worth the wait if you're fiending for your ramen fix.

the ramen war continues... as a lot of reviewers have commented, the broth here is less "porky" than ippudo's. ?it gives your ramen experience a very different taste. i think i may default to ippudo's simply because it's south of 14th street. ?hey if i have to stand in line an hour for ramen, i might as well do it downtown.

If you want to be hassled by your waiter for a better tip, this is the place for you! ?I've been to Totto a few times and absolutely love the food here, however, I will not be returning due to the treatment we received from the waitstaff on our last visit. ? If you have been here before you know that it is a very small space where tables are turned over very quickly to meet the high demand of the restaurant. ?In a place where the waiter gives you five minutes after sitting down to decide what you want, places a bowl of ramen in front of you another 5 minutes later and then doesn't come back until you are finished only to give you the bill, I do not feel like more than a 15% tip is necessary. ?On top of that, tips are at the customer's discretion, so for us to have our waiter block us in the restaurant and harass us in front of the other customers for another dollar is completely ridiculous. ?I also witnessed him harassing the table sitting next to us for more money as well, in which case they had to leave the restaurant to find an ATM to bring him the extra dollar he was demanding. ? This is absolutely despicable behavior and they have forever lost a loyal customer due to these actions.

I really don't enjoy writing a one-star review, but here goes... The one-star here should be considered representative of the service at Totto Ramen, not the food. ?Because I never got as far as having the food. ?Over the past few months I have made several attempts to visit Totto Ramen, but was always put off by the lengthy wait (obviously not their fault, of course). ?However, I was recently in the area on a weeknight and made the decision to invest the time to see what their ramen was all about. Outside the restaurant there was a crowd of eight or ten people, pretty typical for what I have seen there before. ?Figuring that there must be a waiting list, we entered the restaurant to put our names on it. ?And then... nothing. ?We waited. ?There was no host at the door and none of the countermen looked up to greet us. ?We waited some more. ?Finally I noticed a person with a clipboard standing in the back of the restaurant with the entire waitstaff talking to somebody at one of the tables. ?We waited. ?They talked. ?We waited, and started to feel self-conscious standing in the doorway of the restaurant as time ticked away. ?They continued to talk. ?This went on for about ten minutes. ?I finally decided to take more of a direct approach - after all, we were just looking to have our names put on the waiting list, something that should take the host about ten seconds to do. ?I walked through to the back of the restaurant to talk to him, but he waved me off, saying "In a minute." So we continued to wait. ?Meanwhile, more people were arriving and the front of the restaurant was becoming quite crowded. ?Eventually the conversation in the back ended and the host returned to the front, only to look right past us and put somebody else on the waiting list first, somebody who clearly was a regular and was greeted by name. ?Then the host looked past us again to bring a party to a table, then again to put another regular greeted by name on the list. And that was it, we left. ?Yes, it was only fifteen or so minutes of wasted time, but it felt like much longer, and it was awkward and uncomfortable. ?Who wants to eat someplace that just made them feel like that? ?There are restaurants that consider me a regular and where I am treated accordingly, but it's done with discretion. ?It's just not right to have a patron wait so long simply to put their name on the waiting list. ?As good as the ramen is here - I'm sure it's actually good, because most of the reviewers who were able to have a bowlful seem to enjoy it - there are many other ramen shops in the city that are also good and that are demonstrably better at professionally managing their crowds and long lines. Maybe someday if I am out with somebody who insists on having Totto Ramen noodles, I'll go back. ?But left to my own, I'll stick with the places that I know want and appreciate my patronage.

BEST soup ever goes to the vegetable ramen broth. it was so savory and delicious, my friend slurped up the whole bowl! we took shots with the chefs and man, can they drink.

Honestly, great ramen!!! I would say, best in town. So why the turn off??? The staff has gotten very cocky over the past couple years. I have witnessed the following - 1) Witnessed waiters chasing down customers and making them tip more. No joke. This happened 3 times while waiting in line outside. One guy was sent to the ATM while his girlfriend was told to stay - WTF??? 2) I'm not Japanese, but do speak. I've seen local Japanese walk up without putting their name on the list and getting the next table. They even call them on their cell phone. 3) Enough of the dirty looks from 'reservation man' when we are waiting outside for an hour to come in. Are we a burden to you or do you have a job because all of us? 4) Cash only = we don't claim our taxes 5) Why does all the staff there drink on the job??? Come on man! Get to work!!! Your lines are long. The last thing I need to see if your drunk a$$ having drunk talk with customers. 6) Wait staff takes cigarette breaks when tables are open and people are waiting outside?? Really!!??? Sure Totto Ramen is Japanese food, but have some respect. ?You are in the US and all clients should be treated as equal.

Bottom line, the absolute best ramen soup I have ever had. ?In fact, probably the best noodle, period, I have ever had. ?We had planned to go one evening only to find a 2-hour wait. ?Went somewhere else, and returned to try another day. ?Another 2-hour wait, but we decided to stick around. ?We were finally seated at the counter (the inside is extremely small, hence the wait times) and enjoyed some spicy ramen, sake, and a Sapporo. ?The wait times were forgotten. ?I still have dreams about this soup.

Yesterday was a disaster. ?I got my wallet stolen at Starbucks and my roommate missed the deadline to pick up paintings from art class. ?We were just in our shittiest mood ever. ? To ease our pain and forget our losses, we decided to go downtown to try out Totto Ramen to celebrate this very special occasion. I have heard many good things about Yakitori Totto and was excited to learn from Urban Daddy that they were opening a ramen place in Hell's Kitchen. ?We arrived at around 10pm and there was an one hour wait because there were only 10 (or 12?) seatings. ?So we just walked over to 50th and had some delicious mojitos at Seeda Thai (http://www.yelp.com/biz/…) first. We came back and were seated at the noodle bar. ?The appetizers were not available yet, so we settled with the following noodle soups- 1. Chicken broth with miso - $10.25 2. Chicken broth with spicy sauce - $10.25 Our orders had the same base soup, with miso and spicy suace added, respectively. ?It was interesting that the miso was placed on a spoon and you got to stir in the soup yourself (according to the waiter, this is the traditional style). ?The spicy sauce (which tasted essentially like the Chinese XO sauce) was also piled on top of the noodles. ?We tried the original broth first without the contamination of the miso and spicy sauce. ?It was a very solid flavored soup. ?We liked it. ?And we liked it even more after we mixed the goodies in because it added an extra richness. ?I believed that there was really no MSG like how they advertised on the menu and all organic-chicken-based (according to a waiter, hence the higher price). ?Then we tasted the noodles - very delicious - chewy and lingering. ?We each got two pieces of pork slices. ?I saw that they were flamed before they were placed on the bowl, it was a good move because it created a little smokiness to the meat. ?In general, the soup would be a little less oily and with less fried garlic, but they were still experimenting and trying to get a feel of the customers' palette. ?We were told that we could ask the chef and personalize our soups as we liked it. ? Overall, I could say the quality of Totto was up to par with Ippudo. ?I did like the atmosphere of this place a lot. ?It was small, cozy and got the noodle bar where one could watch all the noodle-cooking actions. ?The owner was very modest and spoke with us after about our experiences and ways to improve. ?The staff was incredibly friendly and was passionate to share part of their culture with us. ?The chef and cook were hired directly from Japan, so you could tell they are very serious about this business. I loved the noodles and would definitely come back again even just for the people. Totto managed to put a smile back on my face.

hmm, what can I say about this place? 1.) It's small and cozy, basically a bar and few tables 2.) There's only like 4 things on the menu right now 3.) Solid food, yummy, but nothing outstanding 4.) Feels like you've tele-transported to Japan...or St. Marks in the East Village.. We got lucky and walked right in at 6pm on a Friday. Since the place is really small, I can see an easy long wait so go early. We ordered the miso ramen and spicy ramen and were satisfied. To be truthful, there was a solid 5 minutes where I felt awkward and out of place because everyone was either speaking Japanese around me, or to me, and I really could not feel anything but stupid as I remained mute. The ramen is traditional, straight-forward, and chicken-broth based, unlike other pork-based restaurants. I overheard that they do have a vegetarian option though, fyi. This place really deserves 3.5 stars, and I started off with 3 stars, but I'm giving it 4, because of the awesome subtle dance moves one of the cooks was doing as he was stirring the stock and feelin the music.

This is a place you hit on a cold winters night. For my starter I ordered seared tuna and avocado; honestly nothing to write home about. Stick with that hot bowl of goodness, ramen. I ordered the chicken paitan, here's what I loved; the al dente-thin noodles (they're kinda crunchy) and the scallion overload (I'm a sucker for scallions). The broth was not too salty and warmed me up. I was indulgent and ordered the corn topping, which was not needed. I think I may favor Tatto over Ippudo because I can't justify waiting an hour for ramen!

I came to Totto Ramen in the hopes of finding gourmet ramen as good as Ippudo's (or close) with half the wait at a more convenient location. Unfortunately I only scored 1 out of 3 of those here. When I stumbled upon Totto Ramen for the first time on a Saturday night, the wait was an hour and a half. I passed it up but decided to return since good things come to those who wait. Apparently not in this case. On another Saturday night, I only endured a 40 minute wait but time seems to pass exponentially slower when waiting outside in the cold without a 2 for 1 Sapporo happy hour. Inside, Totto Ramen is reminiscent of what actual ramen shops look like in Japan - a spattering of small tables packed tight next to a ramen bar where hot noodles are served up to order. Now this isn't necessarily a bad thing but it's definitely different than the faux modern japanese decor at Ippudo. When you walk in you know ramen at Totto is served quick with no frills. I had high hopes for the ramen here, but I found myself seriously disappointed. Ramen here is served with one of two broths - a chicken stock or a mushroom stock (for vegetarians mostly). The varieties on the menu basically offer different levels of spiciness plus a miso option. Coming here, I had the preconception that spicy ramen was really just a way to add flavor to a bland base broth but with so many rave reviews I gave it a try. Unfortunately it was exactly what I thought it'd be - a bland broth with a spicy cover up. It was spicy. That's for sure. But it lacked the full richness and flavor that a true pork based broth would have. The same applied to the miso option. It had a bit more flavor because of the miso, but it still couldn't make up for the quality of chicken broth. As for the "extreme spicy" ramen that is supposedly 5x spicier than the spicy ramen according to the menu's chili pepper illustration, I'd rather just down a few habeneros and call it a day. Some people might enjoy the "lighter" chicken broth served at Totto but if I wanted something light, I'd just have a bowl of chicken noodle soup.

As probably most the people reading this review on a ramen joint know, there have been an almost infinite number of new ramen restaurants springing up everywhere in Manhattan. To be honest, I KNOW my ramen. I've been working at a well known ramen restaurant for over 2 years now (shall remain unnamed), and I've probably been to almost all the ramen places in New York now. Not to mention that I'm Japanese and born and raised in Japan. I reeaaally wanted to like Totto Ramen. I'm a fan of the Totto chain, and go quite often to Yakitori Totto and Torys...but I have to say that I was very disappointed. I had the Totto Ramen and Totto Miso Ramen. Noodles were made at the factory and then frozen variety, though I know its impossible to demand fresh hand-made noodles like the ones at Ippudo from all ramen restaurants. ? I do have to give them props for attempting to operate with no MSG, very impressive. However (maybe its a Japanese thing), I don't really care if my soup has a bit of MSG ( I do hate heaps of it though), and the soup if it had had some of that chemical kick would have tasted alot better. ? Pork topping was probably the best part of the ramen. Though it was a bit stringy like previous yelpers have mentioned, I think using a fattier pork would have overpowered the extremely delicate chicken broth. The worst part of the entire experience must have had to be the environment and service. I never got water until I asked for it even though the table next to us got water immediately after being seated. Guy cooking ramen obviously didn't know how to hold bowls of hot ramen, nearly thought I would get burnt by him knocking a bowl over, very surprised that he managed not to, though I can almost guarantee that it will happen to someone in the near future. I do understand that the restaurant is tiny and though I don't hold that against them, the place needs some kind of ventilation...my entire shirt was clinging to my body within 3 minutes of sitting down...you don't want to know what I looked like after eating hot ramen. Overall, I probably I won't be going back, though I might after they have appetizers just to try their buns, which every ramen joint seems to have to have now...do they really? Plus, portion was just too small for me, probably a third of what you would get at Menkuitei or Rairaiken. I literally would've needed three of the ramens to feel full. Word of advice: if you are a Minca fan and love fatty porky ramen, I definitely would NOT come here. However if you like places like Momofuku and Souen, with the blandish light flavors, would give Totto Ramen a try...after they install a fan.

I went to totto 2 days ago and had been waiting outside for an hour, even if there is outdoor heater but it wasn't help at all. My fingers and feet were dead. Anyway, I don't mind for the long wait if the ramen is very delicious. ?I ordered totto extra spicy ramen and my friend order niku ramen. The taste was just ok, not outstanding. Just like other ramen restaurants. Plus, the thing that made me very disappointed was the totto extra spicy ramen wasn't spicy for me at all. Then I asked for more sesame oil but they charged me $1.25 for a very tiny cup. I think 50 cents is reasonable , $1 is ok but $1.25 is unacceptable!!! I can eat spicy and the menu indicates that this ramen is very spicy( with 9 chilies). I went to Thai restaurant they gave me hot sauce with no charge. By the way, the service was nice. But the ramen wasn't worth the wait at all

I come here all the time for lunch. ?This joint is tiny yet quaint. ?The menu is simple and they have a few specials posted along the wall. ?Totto's broth is light but yummy. ?The pork is very tender and the texture of the ramen is just right (not too soft or hard). ?Judging by how spicy you like, you can ask for the spicey sauce on the side and add as you wish. ?Instead of sitting in the tables, enjoy your meal on the stools wrapping the open kitchen and you get to see how they prepare your ramen.

WHY?!.. my friend and i got here at 10pm. and of course, a line of people. the place is suuuuper tiny inside. maybe 8 ppl on the bar, about 5 tables for 2? after our wait, we were seated at the bar and greeted by a very fun, very loud, very quirky cook. i don't know what to say except how fun he was. he definitely made this dining experience even more memorable and interesting. and ahem, i don't know about you but i thought the waiters were pretty cute. i would definitely come back to totto ramen when i revisit new york city. :)

My friend and I went on a Thursday night at 6:45pm. The wait was about an hour. We were disappointed when we were told that there was no more grilled squid on the menu because it's seasonal. Avo tuna was not good. Tuna was sort of chewy. Avocado was too salty with the soy sauce. What making me to rate it 4 stars is really the ramen. I can eat really spicy food so I ordered the extra spicy totto ramen. Not too spicy for me. It matched my taste. The texture of the noodles was perfect. The broth was delicious. As the menu states, no MSG is used. I don't know if it's true, but I can say my friend and I didn't get thirsty after having the ramen. We were both satisfied. Definitely going back for more.

very nice, but not my fave. ?chicken broth is lighter and maybe healthier? ?of course, they have the torched cha siu (their signature)--it didn't add that much of an additional dimension as I had thought it would. ?got the miso version and sampled some of the chicken paitan broth. ?since i'm a pork fan, still doesn't measure up to say minca. ?the wavy noodles were very nice, good chew. ?long line at lunch even when it opens.

Are you looking for a hot, fresh and delicious bowl of ramen?? ?Perhaps with a tasty chicken broth and topped with rich slices of hand torched pork?? ?And maybe a seasoned boiled egg and extra nori seaweed?? ?Well then look no further!!! ?Although if you're starving, please note that there is always a wait. ?Get here as fast as you can, put your name down on the clipboard and patiently wait your turn. ?Once seated, enjoy the goodness that is Totto Ramen but don't forget your fellow man standing outside awaiting entry. ?They're starving. *char siu mayo don: house special broiled pork (hand torched for each order) with yuzu mayonnaise on a bed of rice. ?This is a rich bowl, very rich but yet oh so TASTY. ?You must love mayo to get this. *totto spicy ramen w. a seasoned boiled egg: original rayu with spicy sesame oil and topped with scallion, onion, char siu pork, and a nori. ?I like things hot, really I do but this definitely has a kick. ?No idea how people get the extreme spicy one. ?I've seen it but still... *totto chicken paitan ramen: straight homemade noodles cooked al dente style in a whole chicken and premium soy sauce based soup topped with scallion, onion, char siu pork and a nori. ?Very tasty bowl. *spicy vegetarian ramen: vegetarian rayu, spicy sesame oil in konbu and shiitake based soup with organic noodles topped with seasonal vegetables. ?Last time we were there they ran out of the organic noodles but they did tell us before they used their normal one. ?Mom liked this one over the one at hidechan. ?Plus they serve it in the cutest pedestal!! ?Like a booster seat for your bowl :) The guys here are super friendly, super efficient and make a mean bowl of ramen. ?If you're at the counter you get everything super fast. Note: this place is cash only so be prepared.

i guess this joint is so amazing that out of anybody i could bump into in this world, i bump into my ex coworker who defriended me on facebook 2 years ago because she thinks i stole her potential boy. what's even weirder is she had JUST moved to NYC like A DAY ago. how can this be such a coincidence. ridiculous. she tried really hard to pretend that she didn't see me and when i said hi to her she lifts her hood and starts laughing hysterically. thumbs up to the fire torched pork belly (is it what they call the char siu?)

I found out about this ramen place, when walking by and seeing a massive group of people (mostly asians at the time, which is usually a good sign) waiting. So I headed over on a sunday night to see what the fuss was about. We waited for over two hours until we were seated and it was pretty cold that night. Not only that, but the waiter in charge seemed to purposely keep spots open, as if to keep a good amount of people outside to show "how good business is". When we were finally seated, we ordered the miso ramen, which was ok. Although I had been waiting for a while and was extremely hungery, I still think that portions are very small. Overall, I felt that I could find ramen just as good somewhere else, like Menchenko, and could have been seated in less than half the time.

While not quite Ippudo it also doesn't try to be. For half the price you get good, quality ramen and you don't have to wait five hours to get it. This is definitely more family style of ramen that your grandma would make. The ingredients are fresh and the flavors are comfortable. I'd recommend going early especially on Sunday evenings as there can be a crowd. We waited 45 minutes to be prepared. However it emulates a traditional Japanese ramen shop in Japan where the turnover is quick. If you love Ramen definitely come here!

yep ?niku is da bomb. chunks of tender roast pork with springy ramen in flavorific broth. scallions, fried garlic, fiery chili oil gives it that punch, crackle and snap. packed, line out the door at 2pm but didn't wait long. get the avo tuna salad for a nice contrast and cold ramen cuz it's best i've had in awhile. noodle-wise, prefer Momo's but the broth here is somethin' else.

It's better than Ippudo in my opinion. ?There I said it. ?I've been here twice and waited more than an hour both times (during peak dinner hours on a weekday), so that's the only bad part about it. ?The miso ramen is absolutely fantastic. ?Another thing is that I much prefer the slightly thicker more squigly noodle that Totto uses (as opposed to Ippudo's more angelhair-like noodles). ?Broth here is amazing. ?Totto Ramen is more worth the wait if you ask me.

My absolute favorite ramen eatery thus far! This place is well worth the long wait (yes, even in the frigid cold). I've been here three times already and I just wish I lived right next to Totto Ramen. If you're wondering, this place is owned by the same people at Yakitori Totto on Broadway and 55th. My cousin found this hidden eatery and I've been raving and telling everyone about it ever since. For one thing, their soup base is one of the best I've ever tasted and it's made with the perfect balance of saltiness and creaminess. The service here is also very quick and the staff are friendly and helpful. I love this place! I would suggest anyone who hasn't been to Totto to order their Totto Chicken Paitan Ramen - the chicken based broth is delicious and flavorful. Their straight homemade noodles are cooked al dente style and topped with scallion, onion, char siu pork, and a nori (dried seaweed). I would encourage those who don't have a cholesterol problem to order an extra seasoned hardboiled egg to go with their bowl of ramen. Their Totto Spicy Ramen is also very good and not at all as spicy as it looks to be. If you are daring enough, you can try the Totto Extreme Spicy Ramen which is 4X spicier. I personally haven't had the guts to try it yet, but mainly because I don't want the spice to overpower the amazing broth! The Totto Miso Ramen is made with Koji Miso and ground pork. The noodles are not straight, but wavy and topped with a seasoned hardboiled egg, scallion, onion, bean sprouts, and their famous char siu pork. On the other hand, if you are a vegetarian or on a light diet this may just be the perfect spot for you, too. Totto serves two vegetarian ramen (one spicy and non-spicy): with mushroom, avocado, and seasonal vegetables. I've never tried them, but I've heard great reviews! For the sides, I would highly recommend their Broiled Char Siu Pork - their char siu pork are to die for and seriously melts in your mouth like warm chocolate candy. If you sit on the stools/bar table area, you'll see that the cook uses a mini blow torch on each pork belly before serving. The pork is served with the right amount of residual fat, with juices dripping out from the sides..delicious! I wasn't a huge fan of their Shinachiku Mayo (bamboo shoots and yuzu citrus mayo) - too plain and nothing out of the ordinary. Considering that they charge $4 for the dish, I wouldn't recommend it. The prices here are reasonable: $10 - $11 for a bowl of ramen (much better than paying a premium at Ippudo). In addition, everything served at Totto is MSG free. However, like any other small ramen shops, this place accepts cash only and only seats approximately 20 people. It is recommended to bring a small party, otherwise you'd be waiting forever! Overall: 4.5/5

Stopped by for a late lunch on a rainy day, a perfect day for ramen. Ordered the Misu Ramen and was not impressed with the flavor of the broth. It did not awaken any of the umami taste buds. The best part of the dish was the char siu pork, very tasty and tender. Loved the friendly atmosphere of the place.

New Yorkers hate lines - as I've discovered upon moving from the west coast - but this line is well worth the wait. ?Singles and doubles are seated faster than triples or quads, which is the biggest group that they will take. ?But once you are inside, you can enjoy the aromas of flavorful non-MSG broth, fresh noodles, good music, and hip waiters that will just make you feel cool in their presence. ?I had the chicken ramen, which was delicious in itself. ?But definitely try the spicy ramen. The only reason this place does not get a 5 is that they forgot to bring our appetizer. ?At the end of the meal, we were so full that we were glad they did.

I would have given this hole-in-the-wall wonderland 5 stars if only the wait wasn't so long. It was totally worth the 1.5 hour wait though, once you taste their pork and ramen. Their sliced pork melt in your mouth and their ramen broth is thick without being too heavy. Just right. Be sure to order the spicy sesame oil to put in the ramen, it really makes a delicious difference! The only thing I didn't like was their noodles, I wish they had a more smooth, soft texture. They felt kind of hard, and gave off that undercooked texture.

mmm finally, a ramen place I actually like. read about Totto Ramen on the Tasting Table daily email and wanted to check it out yesterday. I had the spicy ramen which I thought was really good. most ramen's I've had I found to be either bland or too salty; theirs was perfect for me. came w/ yummy pork but next time I think I will add extra pork and egg bc I'm greedy damnit! They also let me take out a few ingredients that I don't like and didn't look at me like I was annoying. Z had the chicken ramen which was quite tasty, also had a different type of noodle, the squiggly ones that come in the instant packages. the place is small but not too stuffy, we were right by the AC so it was all good, cooled me down from the sweaty summer heat and the spicy ramen ;) Ha!

finally an amazing ramen place not in the village!! it was DELICIOUS. on a monday night at 9:00PM, the wait was just about 30 minutes - not bad and definitely worth the wait. i tried the chicken paitan ramen since it had the word totto in it. i'm not a huge fan of chicken but the soup was the best chicken broth i have ever had. it was like chicken noodle soup, japanese style. however, i wish i had gotten the spicy ramen because i tried a little and it was SOOOO good. the broth is so thick and flavorful. i am dying to try the EXTRA spicy ramen now - i was a little afraid to try it with the number of chili peppers next to its name on the menu but now i definitely need to go back. one of the best parts of the menu was the uni with rice. that rice was the most perfect rice i have ever had in my life. i would love to try the spicy tuna with rice as well. the service is SO fast and the food came out so fast too. the menu is small but what they do have, they do it well. (and cheaper than ippudo). this is definitely one of those places where i will crave all the time now!

Upon waiting on a cold Friday afternoon I came across Totto ramen. I was intrigued with the line so I wrote my mine on the list. After the wait, I had a tasty chicken ramen with spicy sauce.

I think the only reason this place gets good reviews is because there just aren't that many ramen places in midtown (although I'm going to try Sapporo and see if that's any better). It's worth going down to the Village though and checking out the ramen places there (Momofuku Noodle bar was delicious!), they've never failed me! It's a C rating, it's a little saltier than I like and the wait really just isn't worth it.

Was craving some ramen at work so naturally I yelped the closest ramen shop. I think I saw Totto as one of the ones recommended on the NYC website so I battled the numerous tourists clutching their maps in times square to get there (I even had to deal with a lady balancing her checkbook right in front of the ATM I needed). ?First, as soon as you get there you have to put your name on the list outside the restaurant and then wait for them to call you. I thought it was weird because I at first missed the sign so I just walked in and was about to seat myself at one of the empty stools at the bar (true japanese ramen style!) but the waitress told me I had to go outside and put my name on the board. Didn't really make sense to me because she ended up seating me at the stool I was aiming for to begin with but whatevs. ?The style of the restaurant is bar overlooking the "kitchen" as the chefs made your ramen or you can sit at one of the few tables towards the back of the restaurant. I ordered the spicy totto ramen and it came a little while later. ?The ramen was the same style as Ippudo's but it only came with 2 pieces of pork. The toppings were definitely skimpier than those at Naruto & Ippudo. At least at Naruto (http://www.yelp.com/user…), $12 came with ramen AND gyoza. And the broth at Totto wasn't as spicy as I wanted. Service was slower than I'd like as well- which makes it hard for someone who only has an hour for lunch. ?Overall, hit the spot but there are better places (aka Naruto and Ippudo) Note: cash only!

I got there at about 12:10pm on a Friday and there was already 20 minute wait. It is a very Totto restaurant. I had the Spicy Ramen. I thought the spicy sesame oil was outstanding with lots of punch of chili and garlic. The chicken broth was good too but it gets pretty heavy after a while. I really like their aldente noodle - straight, not too thick, firm, and tasty. Overall, I think it's good chicken broth, but chicken ramen is not my favorite after all. ?I suspect they have a lot of chicken bone left overs from their yakitori restaurants and are certainly making good use of every bit of chicken parts...

I had the miso ramen which was excellent with freshly blow torch grilled pieces of pork. The broth was also very authentic according to my Japanese dining partner. ?The extra spicy ramen is also good for those who like a little kick. ?I also think it's a great place for those with shellfish allergies because the broth is made with chicken. ?For those who commented that the broth is too mild I suggest you add all the deep fried garlic flakes or try the spicy ramen. ?Totto is definitely a ramen place to check out!

so REALLY a 3.5 start at this point, but oh well. i really wanted to luv this place bc of the reviews....and i did think some aspects of it were done really well. we both got the chicken paitan ramen since this is their signature dish (although i would like to come back & try the spicy or miso ramen- maybe i'll up my stars =). i am definitely a pork person, so i was a bit hesitant, but the chicken broth was flavorful and creamy, every slurp was a tasty one. i think i still prefer the fuller flavor of pork broth though. the ramen was cooked to al dente, which i like as well. there was no egg, so i kind of missed that. but my friend go it and it wasn't soft boiled...as rumored. it's such a wonderful thing, that soft boiled egg. everyone should implement it! i actually think ramen setagaya does this the best. we also got for apps the char siu mayo don & seared tuna w/ avacado. the tuna was lacking in flavor and texture was a bit on the mushy side. i wouldn't get this again. i usu like my pork on the tender side so the char siu, was a bit tough for me, but my friend enjoyed it so depends on your pork preference ;) quick tips- there is no host, just write your name on the clipboard hanging on the door. it seats about 20 ppl, including counter space so there will most likely be a wait. we waited about 30 mins w/ 4 tables of 2 and 1 of 1 ahead of us. CASH only!!

This ramen is amazing. I got the Totto Spicy Ramen which I highly recommend. The ramen comes with three slices of cha siu pork, some sort of scallion or green onion, bean sprouts and nori. The cha siu pork has a great smoky flavor, though comes second to that of Minca. The cha siu at Minca as smoky as well as meltingly tender and flavorful. Totto Ramen's cha siu was a bit drier. The bean sprouts added a nice textural contrast for all the softer textures. The noodles were almost perfectly cooked and were springy but almost overcooked. However the main star of this bowl of noodles was the broth. The broth was so deeply flavorful. The chili oil added so much depth. It was not too salty, slightly peppery. There is no other word to describe this other than umami. I can't even describe how amazing the broth was. I normally eat all the noodles and then leave the broth, but this time I drank all the broth up that's how good this was. Honestly I really can't describe how amazing this ramen was other than to say that it's amazing and a must eat. Service is quick and the atmosphere is your typical authentically small and steamy ramen joint. I love this place and would come here again and again if I lived closer.

i dont understand why the wait is long here. totto has nothing on ippudo. the ramen is just fine, but not spectacular. only eating chicken and fish, i was hoping to get the miso based ramen with boiled chicken instead of pork. but they claimed that they didnt have chicken...so i settled with the vegetarian ramen. it was full of vegetables in a soy-based broth. good, but something i would go back for. the tuna / avocado app is amazing, though. hands-down the best thing any of us ate that day. the service is excellent - your food arrives pronto. a tip to anyone who wants to go for lunch - you can start signing up for tables at 10 am, so if you walk by on a coffee break, be sure to sign up early. but you have to be there right at noon, otherwise they give your table away.

Went on a Saturday afternoon and waited about 45 minutes - luckily, the clipboard sign-in sheet allows for you to walk around the area (not that there's much to look at!) so you're not standing in a cramped area the whole time. The ramen's broth is made of chicken (supposedly all the bones from the Yakitori Totto's chicken!) and mixed with some pork broth, so the broth is a little sweeter than you might expect. ?Not as savory, thick, and hearty like tonkotsu ramen. I got the miso ramen, and the mister got the original one. ?Some reviews said that the noodles were soggy, and I was nervous, but the mister and I try everything "the way it is" the first time. ?NO problem with the noodles! ?In fact, they were chewier and more delicious than Ippudo's noodles IMO. ?Perfect katamen! The only thing I found bizarre was that the miso ramen had diced raw onion thrown into the soup. ?It was a nice crunch, but the raw onion taste bothered me after a while, and I didn't really dig it. Once inside, the service is very very efficient. ?We ate the way people should eat ramen: sit, order, eat, pay, leave. ?Service was great - and I was given water refills constantly, which was awesome! One thing I wish they had was GYOZA!! :(

I had only tried top ramen out of a bag before this place. Got the extra spicy pork ramen, with mushroom. Bomb Diggety! Place is no joke! Ramen has a new found respect.

This place has great review, and I thought it would be worth waiting over an hour in the rain for, but definitely not. I got there with 3 other friends, and we put our name down on the sheet that's on the door to wait to be called. ?After about an hour and 15 minutes, they called my name, but then told us if we wanted to be seated now, we had to split into 2 groups of 2, unless you want to wait another 15 minutes to be seated together. ?Fine, so we said okay because we didn't want to wait out in the rain any longer. ?2 from our group go in and get seated, the rest of us get stopped by the host who says, "You have to wait longer to be seated", we said, "Wait, but you said to be seated now we'd all get seats", he said no. ?Fine, so we said okay well it should be real quick so we'll just wait right here inside at the entrance, nope, he told us to go back outside and wait on the sidewalk. ?Back outside for another 10-15 minutes and then he called us. ?Pretty pissed right now, this ramen better be good. ?He seats us at the bar, with a couple next to us, then our other 2 friends next to them. ?The couple was finishing up and paid their bill within about 2 minutes of me and my friend sitting down. ?We asked the host if we could slide over so we could sit next to our friends, he said no. ?A white dude working there asked him for us as well, he said no to him too. ?Is that not insane? ?I was about to get up and flip him the bird and walk right out, but my friend really REALLY wanted to try this ramen. ?I swear I should have walked right out. ?So the host who was also our waiter came to take our order, i asked for a substitution for the meat because the menu says they will make substitutions for dietary restriction reasons. ?He said no. ?I feel like that's all he knew how to say. ?So I just got mine without meat, and it wasn't bad, but it wasn't great. ?Ippudo and Minca totally kick this place's ass. ?I hate the wait for Ippudo so I don't go there much anymore, but at least they know how to treat a human being. ?If you are going to wait this long for Ramen, you might as well just go to Ippudo because it tastes way better and they don't have awful employees working there.

One of my favorite ramen shops is Naruto on 90th and 3rd. ?Totto also has mostly barstool seating and a really casual atmosphere. ?I appreciate when the shop is mostly about the ramen and not all the other fancy fixins. ?Loved the noodles here - the eggy kind that are kind of curly. ?While I was skeptical that chicken based broth would not be delicious, the spicy ramen and miso ramen were both totally awesome. ?Miso - really clean tasting and the spicy was just salty, flavorful goodness. ?A nice piece of flame grilled pork was dropped into each bowl and for $10.25 I had so much ramen that I actually left some noodles behind (unthinkable).

I have been trying the various Ramen noodle places in manhattan. Went to Totto ramen based on the reviews here. Waited for a couple of hours outside, but I thought- well I am sure it is worth it. Turned out to the worst of the many Ramen places I have been- left my bowl half-empty and left. Broth was non-descript. Still cannot figure how this place got 4 stars and the wait. Momofuku still reigns at the top of my list with Ippudo close behind. In terms of just the broth- Momo is hands down the best.

More legit than Ippudo. Yeah I said it - I think this place has an honest-to-goodness leg up on The Great One of the New York City ramen scene. Why? It's small, austere, lightly adorned, lightly staffed and serves kick-ass food without extra frills... which is how I imagine they eat ramen back in its country of origin. The signature chicken paitan is a party in your mouth, on your epiglottis, in your esophagus, and so on. Which should be saying something given how everyone and their mom lately rocks a perma-woodie for Kyushu pork broth. And the NOODLES. Not sure what more I can say except that I'm pretty sure these supple strands of chewy awesome are spun from powdered wool shorn from the bellies of baby unicorns.

Wow, now I know why there's always a line outside this place. ?I had the vegetable ramen noodles, and they throw in lots of fresh vegetables, and not just the cheapest stuff they can find. ?Instead of basic white mushrooms, they put in more expensive ones, and the noodles are great too. ?While a bit more expensive than it should be, this was the best noodle/vegetable dish I've ever had, so it's a good treat now and then. ?Just try to go at off times, or you'll be waiting entirely too long on line outside.

My go to and my favorite ramen place thus far. I keep going back!!! You have to get there when the door opens or else you have to wait until the first round of people clear out the restaurant before they let the second group in the door. They are fast and friendly so you just have to wait patiently. You can talk to the chefs if you sit at the bar and you can watch them prep the ramens. For the price and their special attention to the way they make their ramen, thumbs up!!! Too bad the place is small and cash only!!! You also have to get there early or else be ready to wait. There is always a line out the door so remember to put your name down. I always order the chicken flavored ramen and the spicy one is great if you can handle the heat.

* The broth is the creamiest that I've ever had. ?Tasted pretty good. ?Like most ramen, it is rather salty but not the insane saltiness found at Momofuku. ?Still, the broth might be too rich for some. * The toppings tasted fresh. * The pork pieces were tasty. * I find it ridiculous that "extra spicy" has like 12 chilis printed after it especially when it packs less heat than plain old sriracha. ?I think these people believe bell peppers are spicy. ?Or maybe they conflate saltiness with spiciness because it was basically a cup of salt-saturated red-colored oil with bits of gunk that hinted at chilis. * $2 for a tiny cup of kimchi topping. ?It was spicier than the "extra spicy" oil but it is a ripoff. ?Our waitress had no problems recommending items with the smallest bang for the buck; she must have thought she was such a smart businesswoman. ?They don't care; they know other naive people will come take our place. ?Shameless. * Ramen is like the Japanese version of American hamburger and fries. ?Both are junk food that appeal to our lust for salt and fat. ?Why the heck would I wait an hour for junk food? Although the ramen was good, it's absolutely not worth the wait. ?I'll leave the waiting to young people and tourists. 4 (ramen) -1 (price, wait) -1 (spice hype, upselling) ?= 2 stars

This is an excellent case study of word of mouth and hype. 40 minutes before they open the line starts. Is it worth it? It's good. But that good?! It doesn't piss me off as much as Ippudo (which i evokes swear words), but it's also not as good. ?I'm sorry to say it's tasty but not enough for me to shag my ass from my East Village apartment for.

Two of us arrived today (Saturday) at 12:45pm. ?I counted 30 people waiting ahead of us, and my name was about halfway down the second page when I signed up for the wait. ?We were called in half an hour later and were out again in another 20 minutes. ?I counted 10 seats at the counter and another 10 at the handful of tables, so our wait made sense. We both ordered the Spicy Ramen with Char Siu Pork and the Avo Tuna. ?The tuna was placed in front of us within several minutes, three pieces decent seared rare tuna with avocado slices and a savory sauce. ?Soups followed no more than two or three minutes later. ?The additions of egg and mushrooms probably weren't necessary in light of the quantity, but it all worked together quite well: ?well-balanced broth, spicy enough to notice but nowhere to the point of making sweaty me feel particularly hot, somewhat fatty but tender pork, bean sprouts, and impressively al dente noodles. Well aware of the C-grade for cleanliness, we didn't mind "risking it" and didn't see the kind of grime or creepy crawlies that the rating suggests. ?It's a cramped little shop, yes, but one that seemed just fine with food prepared in plain view of everyone. ?Will I go back this winter or would I wait more than 45 minutes? ?Probably not on both counts, but a tasty break from the normal Saturday brunch that's well worth checking out.

Yum. Yum yum yum. We were craving something light yet filling.. and this was perfect. PERFECT. Long wait list but moves fast. (this was around 6:30pm on a Sunday) There were 7-8 groups in front of us (mostly couples), and we waited maybe 20 min? Not even. People gobble up ramen fast, and move on. A lot of people seemed to have written their names down and decided not to wait around. It's a small restaurant. Cute, with a brick wall, bar and couple tables. Cozy. I liked it though my friends found it a little cramped. The servers were funny because they spoke minimal English. MINIMAL. Enough to take orders and thats pretty much it. I'll just say it took about 5 minutes to ask how long the wait was, and another 10 minutes to ask if the curly noodles were also homemade. Oh and another 10 to explain to them that no, "Christine party of 2" are no longer waiting here because we'd asked every group standing outside and all of them are accounted for in other groups on the waiting list. It made for a funny wait though. Great thing about ramen is it's relatively fast to make and our food only took a few minutes. Worth the wait =). Oh and I love that the menu is very limited and they don't go crazy w/ the selection - just a few items to choose from, and you know all of them have got to be good. We got: - Spicy chicken ramen (with mushroom side) - since they're known for the chicken. Although there were only 2 thin slices, and pretty fatty ones. Thats my only complaint.. well and they skimped on the seaweed too (only one small piece! I ate it almost right away and immediately regretted it because I realized there wasn't any more). The broth was excellent, delicious, the noodles soft & the perfect texture, not rubbery at all. Everything tasted so good together. The bean sprouts added a perfect crunch, as well as the scallions/onions. And there wasn't too much broth - I hate when you finish the noodles and end up with a giant bowl of broth at the end. I'm not incredibly tolerant of spiciness but this was just perfect - any more spicy and I wouldn't have been able to handle it (or taste it for that matter), this was just enough to add that kick of flavor. We were all blowing our noses because it definitely was strong, but we loved it nonetheless. Totto miso ramen (with mushroom & spicy sauce sides) - basically same thing but with pork. Also delicious. Oh my friends noticed theirs didn't come with the hard boiled egg and the server quickly brought it over as a side.

Let me be first say I am a die hard pork ramen fan. ?The only non pork based ramen Ive had was beef based which was at the ramen museum in yokohama japan. ?I have never tried chicken based ramen, and let me say that I was thoroughly impressed!! This place is always crowded!! The one time i was able to sit down with minimal wait was on a Wednesday at 3 pm!! ?This tiny ramen place seats 20 with stool seats thats right in front of the cooks making your food; very typical of ramen shops in japan. ?The best part was that it is closer to me since i live in the UWS. ?Most of the good ramen places are in the east village, so cutting the commute in half for good ramen makes me smile from ear to ear. On to the food: the chicken paitan ramen is their signature. ?Chicken based soup that comes with 2 pieces of char shiu pork. ?I ordered the extra spicy rayu oil and spicy bamboo shoots to add. ?They give these to you on the side and you can titrate your soup at the desired level of spice you prefer. ?For $1 the spicy bamboo shoots was a huge serving, well worth it. ?It does not come with an egg, but that doesn't bother me because from pictures, it looks like the egg is not soft boiled. ?which is a minus. The noodles itself were good, slightly thicker then ippudo's but less then that of ramen setagaya. ?The broth was surprisingly very good. ?Creamy, flavorful, and savory. ?I ordered an extra side of char shiu pork, because that is my weakness. ?For $4.50 it comes with 4 good sized slices of the pork with bean sprouts on the side. ?And yes they do blow torch it as they do at minca, it definitely brings out flavor. As far as rankings overall compared to other top ramen places: I would say it would fall under ippudo, setagaya, minca, santouka. ?Mainly because it only offeres chicken based ramen, if it offered more variety and if they had soft boiled eggs, rankings would be on par with the top places. I will be back!!

We showed up on a Thursday night a little after 11 pm and were immediately seated. ?There were still plenty of people in the place as well as patrons arriving after us. ?The Miso Ramen my bf ordered was quite delicious, but I failed on my mission to really taste what Totto has to offer when I ordered the Vegetarian Ramen. ?Now, before I start, let me tell you I have no problems having a meatless meal, but this ramen did not hit the spot. ?It was a beautiful presentation of vegetable broth, bell peppers, salty avocado slices and mixed greens. ?Albeit beautiful, the broth lacked body and was quite bland. ?I had to ask my bf for some of is miso broth. ?However, the prices here are about $1 cheaper than Minca in the East Village, but perhaps the bowls at Totto are a bit smaller. ?So with his tasty Miso Ramen and my not so tasty Vegetarian Ramen, I think this place warrants another (off-peak) visit...but I'm in no rush. P.S. Please don't be an a-hole and bring a party of 6+; this place is a tiny joint and is best for maybe 1 or 2 groups of 4, but that's it.

A solid 4 stars. I like that they're going against the grain by using chicken instead of pork as a base for their soup (which by the way does not in any way detract from the deliciousness!) and by setting up shop in Hell's Kitchen instead of the East Village. Love the casual and authentic vibe, the delicious food, and the prices. Thank you, Totto, for bringing delicious ramen to Midtown West! Now if only the lines weren't so long...

I came here on a cold snowy day in October(Saturday of Halloween weekend) around 5.30pm. And yes there was still a line. We only had to wait about 20 - 30 minutes though and it was so worth it! I got the miso ramen with pork. The meat was amazing. The pieces of meat were cooked using a flame. So good! Noodles were also cooked well, not too soft. But the broth was what set this place apart from other ramen places I've tried. It was so flavorful.

With my first spoonful of the hearty broth, I was transported to the the little ramen shops at the train stations in Japan. ?Sadly, I didn't pay at a vending machine or get to hand a ticket to anyone but I smiled and inhaled my bowl of the Totto Chicken Paitan Ramen. ?I didn't even mind the sweat beads dripping down my face. ? The noodle was cooked perfectly al dente, which gave it a nice chew while the char siu crumbled easily creating a perfect balance of texture. ?The scallions and chopped onions complimented the broth and didn't overpower the soy flavor. ?And yes, I drank my bowl. ? ?

When I was in college, one of the small pleasures I immensely enjoyed was boiling water, dropping in some ramen, and mixing in the seasoning to make brunch. This would take about 10 minutes and the pack of noodles was about 25 cents. Multiply that amount of time by 8 and add 10 dollars to the price and you would get the Totto Ramen experience. I have visited this place twice and had the Miso Ramen and the Chicken Ramen, and have been greatly underwhelmed both times. Ichiban or Nissin brand ramen were more satisfying than the so-so flavors Totto offered. They didn't even scream hello or goodbye the second time I visited. Whenever I make ramen myself, I always remember to scream "Hello!" before eating.

When I looked at the menu and saw that there were 10+ red peppers after the Totto Extreme Spicy Ramen, I had to try it. ? How spicy can it be? ? My friend recommend that I should order the sesame infused hot sauce on the side so i can adjust it to my own personal taste. ?Screw that. ?I dumped the entire thing into the soup and watched it slowly changed from a light beige broth into a hellish flow of flavor that would soon cascade down into my belly! ? You know what, it is freaking spicy. ?I mean it was so good that ignored the beads of sweat running down my face so I can continue to consume the amazing bowl of noodles. ? I love this place. ?Its a whole in the wall atmosphere . . . perfect during the bone chilling NYC winters.

Ok, I'll be selfish and say that I'm upset that Totto's popularity has increased exponentially since this past summer. It's seems that way to me at least. I love the chicken paitan ramen to death and every time I crave it I try and drag a friend or two there. But alas! I've always been thwarted by the never-ending list of names on the clipboard. I actually counted - it took 5 times before I finally got lucky with Larry L. (Get your mind out of the gutter, you.). It's not like I went on Friday or Saturday nights at 7 pm either. I tried Wednesdays. I tried Mondays. I tried at 5 pm. I tried camping outside in a tent like the desperate ramen addict that I am. There are just too many people now with the same addiction. Does this make me any less addicted? Hell no. But it does make me much more frustrated. And hungry.

This is ramen the way ramen should be. It's cramped, it's hectic and loud, and it's delicious. Totto is tucked away down a half flight of stairs, but you shouldn't have any trouble finding it thanks to the crowd of people waiting their turn. As with any great ramen joint, the wait can be insane. While we were eating, one uninitiated couple walked in and sat themselves down at the bar right after another couple left. Imagine their surprise when they were told they'd have to put their name down on the waiting list, which now had a wait tme of 2hr. (What did they think the other fifteen people were doing waiting outside, just kickin' it??) Half the seats here are at the bar, with a few tables crammed into the back. Unless you have a big group (big meaning more than 2), the bar is the place to be, since the buzz of activity is half the experience. We got two appetizers, the ika-yaki and spicy tuna don, and two bowls of ramen, a vegetable and a miso. The ika-yaki was perhaps a bit overdone and too tough, but the tuna don was terrific (and very large). The vegetable ramen was came with a huge assortment of veggies, but the broth was predictably weak. On the other hand the pork broth was great--rich and cloudy. If you're trying to decide whether to come here or go to Ippudo, I would always advocate Totto. Where this place is gritty and real, Ippudo is glitzy and slick. It feels more like a show there.

Quite a line for 2pm... a 45 minute wait later we go in for our table for 2. ?Once we were seated there was an empty table for two next to us that stayed open for at least 15 minutes before they let the next pair come in which seemed odd...The service once we finally got in was quite good in contrast, as we quickly got in our order and shortly after two delicious bowls of piping hot ramen come forth. Had the Totto spicy ramen, which as the menu accurately described was only a touch spicy - very tempted to go for the extreme version next time. The pork was tasty, the both was rich and clean, and the noodles had a good texture and taste. A solid option if you're looking for your ramen fix.

Gee whiz! What a line. Umami broth and a stand-out vegetarian bowl of ramen were the payoff here (nice that you can add an egg for protein), for me and my dining companion, but this isn't a place to linger over your dinner. Ambiance is minimal--Totto is bustling, crowded, and small; but the price and the location are right, and the product is very good indeed.

SO crowded(inside and outside), so small (narrow) , so cold (door can't be closed) but its worth it!! I've tried a handful of ramen joints and this place wins!! We sat in front of the chefs and they are so funnie!! He entertained us while we were waiting for our meal and during our meal! He danced, cracked jokes, and showed us tricks while doing his job! I came here with my friends because they had a vegan option for me. I ordered the vegetable ramen and I LOVED it!! The soup base was quite unique and it wasn't salty! The balance of the soup, veggies and ramen was perfect. Plus the avocado gave it a nice new kick. Other ramen places make their meat ramen taste phenomenal and concentrate less on the veggie ramen or decide to not even have the option, but totto ramen is different. They put in the same amount of effort as they do with all the other ramens and the veggie ramen is served differently! I got a special boost plate for my bowl and was able to turn it 360 degrees! ?My friends ordered the totto spicy ramen and loved it too! Our bowls were spotless.

as everyone knows, freaking crazy wait. ?i think my friend put our names there at 6 pm and we didn't get seated until 7:45pm. ?it's a super small place. ?do not go in big groups. maybe a max of 3 people. loved the avo tuna appetizer!! it had bean sprouts, avocado, fresh tuna and yuzu juice and more stuff i can't remember. but really loved how fresh it tasted. Totto Chicken Paitan Rameng (these straight homemade noodles are cooked al dente style in a whole chicken and premium soy sauce based soup topped with scallion, onion, char siu pork, and a nori.) ?i liked this dish but i have to say i do like ippudo's noodles a bit more than this place.

2nd only to ippudo. (cheaper, with a sizable wait because of the small space inside.) ?came here with my roommates and ordered the totto spicy ramen and the totto EXTREME spicy ramen. to our suprise, the spicy ramen came out red... but the EXTREME spicy came out with a little bowl filled with hot sauce that you could add at will. my best guess is that some people would order the extreme spicy and then not be able to handle it, hence the "add as you go" method. the broth is rich and smooth, noodles are the right amount of "springiness," the braised pork is fatty and melts in your mouth. my mouth is watering just typing this review. i also got the seasoned avocado because it piqued my interest - it's amazing. i never would have thought to add avocado to ramen, but it's delicious genius! CASH ONLY!

let me just say: we waited for nearly an hour in the cold, crammed in with tons of other unhappy people also waiting to stuff their faces with ramen. ?was it worth it? ? YES. totto's ramen is based on a chicken broth, which means it's going to have a different taste and texture and flavor than your tonkotsu or miso (also they do have miso, if you like your broth thick and extra savory). ?i had the chicken based soup and it did NOT disappoint. ?neither did their amazing boiled egg, seasoned to perfection, their perfectly chewy and pliant noodles, cooked to the right consistency. ? but the best part was the cooks behind the counter: wannabe reggae loving japanese young men who are countrymen to the core right down to their awful dentition. ?their humor and countertop conversations went hand in hand with their effortless dishing of noodles and i don't think i've ever laughed so hard eating ramen in my life. ?they also think that all people who eat there live in the neighborhood so when you tell them that you took a train to get there, they are really, really tickled. served up with an ice cold bottled sapporo, there is nothing really quite like it. i love that this place is in hell's kitchen and not in the east village. ?it's a little closer to home, but the same authenticity that you'd expect from ... say, ippudo.

I guess this place has a very good reputation out there because every time I passed by there, I could see a whole bunch of crowd waiting outside. But when I finally had a chance to taste their famous ramen, well....it was okay but not THAT good. The soup was way too salty. I don't think their noodle is as good as Ippudo in East Village. And the restaurant is very very small and cannot contain more than 20 people. You always have to wait for a LONG time before getting in, which I have to consider in rating. And they don't allow more than 4 people to eat together.

All Ramen all the time. Got there at 6 and only waited 15 minutes which is much better than I thought the wait would be. Holy hell is it hot in here. ?We were seated at the counter which was a bit tight but it was so worth it. ?The broth was cooking right in front of us and the giant pot contained onions almost as big. ? I cried the whole time I was there and I don't know if it was due to the onions or because the ramen was so damn good. ?I ordered the Totto Spicy Ramen (original rayu, spicy sesame oil, paitan ramen. topped with scallion, onion, char siu pork, and a nori.) and it was served to me probably less than five minutes later. ?The char siu pork is cooked with a torch and tastes even better with the broth. I'm a big fan of the broth, it was so savory I had to fight the urge to bring my lips to the bowl.

This was the fourth time I've tried coming here and finally ... SUCCESS! We put our name on the list and about an hour later (well, really, I lost track of time), our party was called! Having already committed to previous Yelp reviews on the place, we decided to go for an appetizer and two noodles. A tall glass of ice cold water came quick -- perfect for a hot summer NYC day as you are sitting in a small restaurant at the bar, facing the burner. Ahhhhh.... The Avo Tuna. Eh. The tuna was really uninspiring and did not have that high quality freshness to it. The tuna itself also lacked a certain crispy to it. I think you still need a certain amount of oil for texture. Maybe I had a bad batch of tuna -- I don't know. But the copious amounts of soy sauce was just too salty. I'd like to taste my food -- not have it drown in salt. The avocado itself was fine, albeit not huge chunks as described by other reviews. The spicy ramen was not very memorable. Ordered an extra side of noodles to go with it, just for kicks. I dunno, it tasted fine. But nothing extraordinary. Seaweed check. Garnishes check. Spicy flavoring, check. As mentioned in other reviews, the pork was somewhat thin. They just blow torch it. The miso ... now THAT was good. That was some tasty, tasty, TASTY broth. And the noodles were definitely better than the spicy ramen noodles. I'm not even sure how to describe it. A wonderful mix of seductive smoothness in your mouth? Cash only. What is this, Chinatown?! I'd have to rank Ippudo higher, if only because they have some amazing appetizers. I might even prefer Himiwari (in San Mateo) as their pork belly is tastier. But the miso -- I would come back for that.

Simply the best ramen in NYC! Ippudo has been disappointing for me because of the over-hype, but despite the high expectation my friend has given about this place, I simply cannot find fault about this place! The chicken paitan ramen (the original) has absolutely the best broth I've ever had; and the torched pork was wondeful, it's thick cut but tender with the perfect proportion of fat and meat, which I much prefer than the ippudo's thin-cut lean pork slices. And the off menu unidon (yes, uni as in sea urchin, not unagi) was delightful as well! Oh, and the obligatory note: yes, it's a long wait but it's worth it.

The Ramen here is great. But the line is ALWAYS ridiculous. The service is arrogant. One time, we went there at 12 pm exactly when it opened, and there was a 2 hour line already! Whatever, so we waited. Then after 1 hour and a half, we had to add more money to our parking spot so we walked away for like 10 minutes and when we came back, they had just missed us by 1 spot - and wouldn't let us in!!! They told us to go back at end of the line again!! wtf?!?!? They didn't care at all that we waited for 2 hours for this!! But, we pleaded. Yes, screwed our dignity and pleaded. They finally let us in after letting a few other people in and purposely yelled at us for not waiting. So, while the food deserves 5 stars, the service is probably 2 stars! Since this is a review on food, I'll still fairly give 4 stars.

Who knew chicken broth could taste this good? But, I guess if you're using a refractometer to calibrate your broth, it better be amazing. The restaurant is tiny so be prepared to wait a bit, but since most people are dining at the bar and the menu is limited to basically ramen, spicy ramen, and extra spicy ramen, it moves quick. I suggest having a beer and a bowl at the bar. It's great to watch the guys work with their extra long chopsticks and blow torches. If you live north of midtown and are too lazy to head down to ramen town in the east village,Totto Ramen will more than hit the spot. Also, before getting your ramen spicy, take some time to savor the umami of the broth. I love spicy food, but this stuff is almost too good to adulterate. I bet it could cure even the meanest of colds.

5 stars for sure. I personally think that totto ramen beats ipuddo, in terms of flavor and the overall atmosphere. We order ?veggie ramen & spicy totto ramen. Both of them are awesome. The veggie ramen definitely beats what you can get at ipuddo. The broth is clear and tasty. The broth for spicy totto ramen is very rich. We also ordered tuna as appetizer. Nice to have that as a starter. The only thing I can complain about is that the wait was too long. It took me around 1.5 hours to seat in. The store is very small, and waiting line seemed never moved. I arrived there at around 8:30pm. By the time when we finished (around 11:00pm), there were still many ppl waiting outside. If you plan to seat in and have a long conversation with your friends, then this is not the place, considering that there are many people waiting outside and desperately want you to move your ass out of this place.

Went to totto ramen on Tuesday night at 6:40 pm. ?Waited about 40 mins for two seats. ?I ordered the chicken totto ramen with pork and the broiled pork with mayo don. The soup had good thick chicken flavor even though they only use chicken for stock. ?It's not too salty or oily. ?The noodles cooked al dente. ?Liked the noodles a lot, it's not too thin or thick. ?The broiled pork mayo don was good. ?They use torch to sizzle out the extra pork belly fat so it's not as greasy. ?However, I wish the rice is not as mushy. ?Maybe I had the bad batch of cooked rice. ?The Avocado tuna had nice seared on the outside and rare in the center but that's all. ?I think the flavor was average, nothing too exciting. ?They used a lot of fried garlic for the sauce to add on top of tuna. ?In my opinion, it is a bit too strong of garlic and overpowering for the tuna. ? The meat lover ramen is the same ad chicken totto ramen except there is piles of varies type of pork meat. ?If you have average stomach like me, I suggest don't order anything else because it comes wirh a lot of meat. ?No kidding. ?Overall the foods were good and the staffs were nice. ?The priced for the ramen and side dishes were reasonable. ? Just be expected average wait was at least 40 mins.

my favorite favorite place in the city for ramen. this place totally beats out Ippudo hands down. here's why: - WAIT - given that this place is a LOT smaller than Ippudo, i give them props in the way they streamline traffic. simply put, there's a list on the door, you put your name on it, and wait to be called. they explicitly have it written that if you're called and not present, you will be skipped. luckily, i've been able to get around this once, and the waiter was totally accommodating :) there was, however, one huffy woman who tried to corner the guy once by asking, "WHERE DOES IT SAY THIS POLICY?? I WANT TO KNOW!" ....he politely pointed to the top of the sign-in sheet and said, "RIGHT THERE". LOL priceless moment. - QUALITY - you get top-notch ramen with all the customization you want! one thing (again) that irked me about Ippudo was that I couldn't get certain noodles with certain broths unless I paid extra for it. here, i can get the straight noodles with miso, or get the wavy noodles with the chicken paitan (HIGHLY RECOMMENDED IF YOU LIKE THICKER, CREAMIER SOUP BASES), and it isn't a problem! - PRICE - i can walk out of there paying $14, which includes splitting a cha shu mayo don (ANOTHER HIGHLY RECOMMENDED DISH!! MMMM!) ok, given that this is Manhattan, that price is pretty great for ramen. i'd totally come back cold night over cold night for some more! business hours are kinda weird though: 12pm - 12am Mon - Fri mid PM - 10pm Sat / Sun i guess everyone wants their sat night fun too...lol

Unbelievable. First of all, let me say that I live down the street from Totto Ramen and have seen long lines outside many times as I passed by...last night on the way home I finally decided to put up with the wait and see what all the fuss was about...Um, can I have the last 60 minutes of my life back please? The wait was long (almost an hour) but it was adding to my anticipation, as I chatted with a few regulars in line to get the low-down on what to expect. Despite the fact that it started pouring rain (and the host literally said "Outside! Outside!" to a few would-be patrons who tried to stand inside the door to keep dry), the mood was cheerful and festive as we continued to wait. Finally, once seated I ordered the vegetable ramen with several additional toppings. Came up pretty fast, and it was a HUGE steaming bowl. Good noodle soup. Nothing to do backflips about. I mean, come on, its clear broth with ramen noodles and raw fresh vegetables on top; not rocket science. But fine. Service was okay, again nothing to write home about, but decent. Ten minutes later I was through. Now here comes the good part: It's cash only, and after my experience as it was, I left a ten percent tip, hopped off the bar stool, and continued on my way (a bit disappointed, but at least full). About a block away, two employees from this place literally chased me down in the street and stopped me to confront me about the amount of gratuity I had left! No joke. I thought at first I must have made a mistake and accidentally not left enough cash or something. As I tried to understand what was going on, one guy kept repeating my bill total before the other guy informed me that "In New York, you tip 17 percent." What?! Are you kidding me?? I told him my tip reflected my overall experience, and as I said this, he literally waived his hand in my face, turned, and said over his shoulder "Don't come back." Don't worry sir, I won't.

4 stars for what it is, but not the same as 4 stars for other types of ramen. ?interpret as you wish. they were out of broth when we first arrived at 9pm :( ?bummer. ?they were making more but it would take an hour. ?the alternative was the veggie ramen. ?i'm sure it would be good but not exactly a fair ramen tasting based on veggie ramen alone. ?so cut to 1 hour later. good noodles in the ground pork & miso ramen. ?like the eggy-ness factor. ?the miso ramen had thin white noodles which i'm less a fan of. all in, good for non-pork based broth. ?giving some benefit of doubt due to yakitori heriatge maybe. ?might have to try again to gut check. literally :)

Of all the ramen places I've tried, this one takes the cake, too bad this one is in Hell's Kitchen. Broth isn't too salty, the cooks seem to enjoy what they're doing.

I finally had a chance to try Totto Ramen after 3 attempts of waiting but I am sad to say I am very disappointed. I ordered #1 with the chicken slices thinking you do not get chicken based char siu at other joints also given the fact they have a rooster is their store logo so I figured they must know what to do with the chicken. The chicken char siu was so bad that I could only swallow one piece out of the three super dry chucks floating on top of the white soup. It was pretty apparent that the chicken would not taste good when the bowl was handed over to me. I mean you can eye ball it and see it looked like someone just carved off some age old slices from poorly cooked frozen breast. It had absolutely no taste, no juiciness and just a total turn off of umami! I was expecting a juicy piece of chicken possibly with the skin still on to give it the right balance of seasoning and fattiness. If I were to review based on the chicken char siu alone I would give it a -.5 star because at first bite it tasted like stale rubber! The soup base was rich but nothing too special about it and a few minutes after I left the store my mouth started to feel dry so I would think it must had ton of msg. Hate for my last ramen experience in NYC to be so horrible but just make me look forward to ramen back in Cali so much more!

I absolutely love this place... even though there is a long wait for this ramen restaurant..it is worth the wait! I ordered the Totto Miso Ramen...and the taste is indescribable. It's a plus, if you have it with a Sapporo beer. I can't give this place 5 stars only because it is not the cleanliness place..if you're going to eat...try to avoid looking at the kitchen where they cook and what they step on. I wonder if they ever got inspected? Overall, even though there are pros and cons to this restaurant, the taste of the ramen makes you want to crawl back to this restaurant every night. It's so good...that good!

I'll break down to the basics. To me the epitome or a good ramen place is 1) broth 2) fresh noodles al dente 3) toppings.. all in that order. ?Totto is a bit like everything else Japanese, organized chaos at its best. ?You will likely wait for 45 minutes to get a table and easily over an hour for a group of 4. ?While i prefer miso ramen anywhere else, here it is indeed too salty. ?On my last visit, the spicy ramen with char-siu pork was excellent. I got the basic without egg or corn. ?I was seated with a friend right at the bar overlooking the never ending parade of bowls, noodles and soup and yes the nearly constant torching of the pork belly. ?My gripe with the constant torching is that it eventually lead to dry pork :( I was sooooo looking forward to a moist bite. ?Pork aside, broth and noodles were superb. ?As we were leaving, we witnessed a new pot being assembled. This is definitely a broth that tastes better and better the longer it simmers. ?Same applies to a good bowl of Pho, once you taste a deep rich meaty broth, the feeling is absolute food porn.

BFF and I arrived roughly at 3:45pm. ?There was about 15 parties on the wait list in front of us. ?We weren't expecting a long wait since preparing the ramen dishes take like 2 minutes and the turnover is fairly fast, unless the asshole customers decide to lollygag when there's a long line out the door. ?That being said, we ended up waiting about 1.5 hours. ?I know that's normal by NYC standards, but my stomach was talking to me. ?Once we got seated, I decided to go with the extra spicy ramen $10.75 (what a steal) and bff went with the miso ramen. ?The spicy sesame was mouth watering good. ?There was plenty of scallions and char siu in my ramen. ?Would it be wrong if I said, that this is better than Ippudo? ?My sister who's an avid fan of Ippudo nearly slapped me, when I said that. ?For now, Totto Ramen is one of the better ramen restaurants in my book. ?I will however make it a point to have Ippudo next time I'm in town.

One of my favorite ramen places in the city. ?Limited seating so plan to wait at least an hour if you come during dinner hours. ?The staff is friendly and the food is great. ?I generally go for the extra spicy ramen which comes with the spicy rayu on the side. ?The broth itself is fantastic. ?It is light and flavorful. ?The spicy rayu adds a great kick. I love sitting at the bar and watching them torch the chasui.

I came around 5 pm so I didn't have to wait. I hear some people wait over an hour to eat here which is completely ridiculous for ramen. I had the spicy totto ramen. It was good. Nice broth. The noodles was just ok and the egg I added was nothing special. The star though was the pork chasu. It was just flamed/grilled when I ate it. It was tender, juicy, fatty....mmmm! It's totally a different feel than ippudo. Its a small hole in the wall type setting where as ippudo is this modern, big, trendy type feel. Cheaper than ippudo. Overall I liked the ramen at ippudo a little better. But because of the price and atmosphere, totto is a place I could see myself eating at once a week where as ippudo would be like once every few months.

This place is SMALL but the broth was good. I'm used to the more traditional ramen instead of the straight thin noodles. The broth is chicken based and seems to be the only option. Their spicyness is NOT spicy at all and doesn't even break a sweat. Water is not needed. The broth is good and thick but the char su pork is nothing compared to what we have here in California. Price is good and food portion is perfect.

Not a bad bowl of ramen but not worth the wait or price. ?The wait wouldn't have been so bad if they were more efficient. ?I wasn't very fond of the noodles they chose either. ?I think a thinner and firmer noodle (like Ippudo) would have gone better with their thicker broth. ?They're pretty creative with the toppings though. ?I've never heard of avocado on ramen.

Most ramen shops within manhattan, have pork based broths, but Totto Ramen is one of only two shops so far that highlight a chicken based Ramen Broth. So can this soup base, contend with the likes of it porkier bretheren? You betcha. Their noodles are thinner than most, but you can request the wavier thicker noodles as well. The Pork Belly is melt in your mouth piggy goodness! The noodle cook told me that the belly varies in texture from swine to swine, but it seems that Totto doesn't skimp on the marbled goodness with each serving. Go there for a good meal, stay for some friendly banter with the cooks.

an hour of wait time goes by fast when you play the game of "check the clip board to see who's left in front of us" spicy ramen has 2 chilies next to it and the EXTREME spicy ramen has 10. i've had both-extreme should only have 5 chilies. you can control the amount of spicy oil you put in your extreme spicy ramen, so don't be afraid and go for the extreme. apps are just ok compared to the actual ramen, so 4 stars instead of 5.

Yes- it is small, there are long lines (unless you go between 3-4pm), there is very little ambiance, they only take cash, the appetizers are limited but delicious. Yes, people waiting eye you jealously and sometimes with pure hate as you are seated or if you languish for a moment while eating and dare to look back at them-did I mention the long wait? It can be hot at the bar, but damn- that's really good ramen! You'll come back again and again and... wait. The best use of $10.99 anywhere, and that's why there's always a line outside.

Lively and helpful staff. Perfectly cooked noodles.

Totto is one of the most amazing places to eat ramen in the city. I can officially say I have tried all of their ramen bowls and I have to say I love the Veg Ramen for it is amazing broth (and I am a meat lover too). Just add the meat if you really want it. I inhale the bowl every time and enjoy the odd looks for requesting an extra bowl of noodles (95 lbs girl here). ? I have a lot of trouble eating noodles when the ramen broth is too salty. This is most of my experience in most of the ramen places in the city I am sad to say. But at Totto, I have yet to have and discrepancy in getting a salty bowl. The ramen is amazing every time. I am so glad I found this place and you would too.

I didn't try Totto Ramen for a while after they'd open. First they weren't open for lunch.. I mean I love Ramen for a quick lunch or late nite snack after some boozing. And I recall that it was really hot, I didn't feel like eating a hot bawl of Ramen. I had Totto Chicken Paitan Ramen first, then Totto Miso Ramen weeks later. Totto Chicken Broth is so good. I have to tell my self not to eat it more than few bowl a week. Miso Ramen was perhaps the best Miso Ramen I've had all my life. I thought I wasn't crazy about Miso Ramen before this bawl, most places put too much Miso. Tooto has the best Miso, Ground Pork ratio that I've ever tasted. Becoz the base soup, chicken broth can stand on it's own. It's just amazing. I'm hooked on it. only problem is no gyoza!!!

On a tip from my sister and her best friend, we embarked on our ramen journey. ?My sister's best friend has eaten in most, if not all, ramen places in NYC as well as San Fran so I trust her judgement. ?She said Totto Ramen is where it's at. ?I'm told it's even better than Ippudo. She was correct, 100%. We got here around 4:30 on a Saturday night already to a line outside. ?On the weekends, Totto is only open for dinner. ?The line quickly doubled as we waited. ?A list is placed on the door and we were third in line. ?We were seated quite promptly inside this tiny, tiny place. ?We ordered the spicy ramen and the extra spicy ramen (upon finishing our bowls, spicy ramen is just enough) and added the seasoned avocado to both dishes (another tip from my sister... and more about that in a little bit). ?HOLY COW WAS THIS PLACE DELICIOUS. ?The seared pork was the perfect combination of meat and fat and was extremely tender. ?Go with the addition of the seasoned avocado for $2 to your $10 bowl of ramen - whatever it is seasoned with, it is heaven in your mouth. ?The avocado soaks up the broth as it sits in your bowl. ?Thinking about it makes me want another bowl of ramen from here. ?Too bad they don't do take-out. I can't even describe the broth but suffice to say it's creamy, hearty, and just damn good. ?It's pure magic. This place is small and not for ones that want to hang out after dinner. ?Eat and go. ?But savor as you eat because this is as good as it gets. Cash only people. ?And with that said, enjoy! ?Because I sure as hell enjoyed mine.

GO ELSEWHERE: The bowl of water with burned pork is passable fare, but over an hour wait on the sidewalk just to sit in an ugly, dirty, cramped basement, with rude, shouting waiters and kitchen help, and steamy, smoky, steaming exposed kitchen right in front of your nose ?is not conductive to a good dining experience! My daughter and I have had two bad experiences there, first , being moved to the bottom of the list after a 45 minute wait because I had to find a bathroom for 5 minutes. We replaced our names, waited over 35 minutes again, when our name was called and we squeezed in to the tiny eating bar and the list "boss" claimed the name on list ?was for one person only and the waiters tried to throw me out! They made a public spectacle of this incident, shouting and threatening and ganged up on us and made the entire experience very embarrassing and unpleasant. We tipped generously anyway. ?I will NEVER go there again nor recommend it. Daughter has returned and wait staff actually had the nerve to bring up the former incident while she was ordering, talk amongst ?the other wait staff while gesturing and glaring at her, and make it an unpleasant experience for her. With so many great restaurants in Hell's Kitchen, the service and mediocre food - GO ELSEWHERE.

Totto's vegetarian ramen is my favorite in NY and the chicken broth is just as good. ?Ippudo is awesome in its own right, but I can't seem to finish a bowl (soup and all) at Ippudo while I can easily down one at Totto. ?It may be because Ippudo is heavier? ?Anyhow, if you can stand the wait it's definitely worth it. ?Otherwise, try going after 10 PM or as soon as they open and you may get lucky.

Saw it several time from yelp and finally tried it today, and it was great. They use noodle imported from Japan, and for the extreme spicy ramen, you can adjust the level by yourself though it is still not spicy even I poured down all bowl of seasoning.

Different type of ramen broth than I've had elsewhere. Tuesday night 8pm party of 3, and we only had to wait 25m. There was always at least 15-20 people outside waiting in the freezing cold for this. I usually go for tonkotsu ramen, so Totto's was much lighter. They use chicken broth instead of pork broth apparently, and the chicken stock flavor is pretty pronounced. I ordered the Miso ramen with chicken and added spicy bamboo. The broth tasted like a rich chicken stock and then once you mix the miso paste in, it punches it up to make it just right. They give you a huge mound of miso too, so make sure you dissolve it well. The spicy bamboo was just bamboo coated in Japanese chili powder, so it was just ok. Also standard in the dish were curly noodles (thicker than straight noodles and cooked perfectly al dente), half a boiled egg, bean sprouts, scallions, and a little ground pork. They give you a substantial portion of chicken - 3 super thick slices of marinated lean chicken breast (tad dry but the meat was of a good quality). Overall, their ramen is truly satisfying, feels healthier yet still has a good chicken flavor, and doesn't leave you drowning yourself in water to counteract all of the sodium normally in ramen. The noodle boiling guy is also hilarious and incredibly dynamic, so he was entertaining to watch. I still prefer Ippudo over this, but I would definitely come here again for a less sceney, different style ramen night. Also, very small place so parties of over 4 have to split up. Cash only.

Was excited to find out a new Ramen place was opening up in the Hell's kitchen area...stopped by the 2nd week after it opened and on a rainy weekday night it wasn't too busy but still had to wait about 10 minutes. ? Decor - place is really small so definitely wouldn't suggest going with more than 3-4 people. ?probably best to go with just one other person. ?otherwise everything in the space itself is nice. ?very cozy, not enormous like Ippudo. ?nice view of food being prepared pretty much anywhere in the restaurant. ?sat at the bar and watched them put the flame to the pork pieces... Service - everyone was very friendly as service was fine but you really can't expect much from a ramen shop Food and Drink - Apps - when i went they still had a limited menu so still have no idea how their appetizers taste. ?would love to go back and try the pork buns. ?we did get to try the edamame and it was ok. ?no salt used so lacked some of the flavor i expected. Ramen - Totto Miso Ramen chicken based miso broth w/ sliced pork - was excellent. ?i liked the chicken broth but do say i probably prefer pork broth. ?the size of the ramen bowls are a bit on the small side. ?so with out any apps to fill up i was still hungry afterwards Totto Spicy Ramen chicken based broth & original spicy oil (garlic, onion, shrimp & scallop) w/ sliced pork - wanted to try both so my GF got this one and tasted better than the miso. Harushika Dry Sake - very good sake and they give a generous pour Overall - really liked its although admittedly i'm not a full fledged ramen specialist. ?i have had it in japan and can say it could match up to it. ?I would still put Ippudo at the top but i'll need to go back and have it again and do a full review of them before i can say its better than Totto. ?definitely will be back.

I consider myself kick ass at making $0.99 ramen so I usually refuse to pay for someone else to make this for me. ?Hey -- I actually learned something in college! ?But I ended up giving in at the insistence of a group of friends. ?Now I don't have much to compare it to. ?My only experience with ramen is momofuku. ?Regardless, I have to admit that this place isn't half bad. ?I'm pretty sure all soups share the same base but are served with different levels of spiciness. ?I got the spicy ramen, which was pretty tasty. ?It was lacking in ingredients, but the broth was delicious. ?While I'm not going to stop making my own ramen, I may come here again if I feel like splurging. ?Also, I have to add that due to a horrible cab ride there, I arrived extremely nauseous but somehow, after a bowl of ramen, I felt really really good...

Went here last night and had the Totto Chicken Ramen (Chicken base broth with sliced pork) / added seasoned avocado and egg. The chicken broth is so good! The avocado was so good but the egg was kinda bland but cooked to perfection. I truly enjoyed the ramen. We got there at 6:30 and it was packed. When we left there was a line to get in. It is really hot in there if you are at the bar. I will definitely go back!

I found the noodles a bit too undercooked, and the broth and pork too fatty. It is also a bit stingy as they only give 2 slices of char siu and no bamboo shoots. But the chicken-based broth is a nice change. If you walk past on a cold night and the line is not too long (however unlikely), it is not a bad choice.

I'd love to be able to say the hype is overrated, but Totto won me over right away with its spicy chicken broth ramen. I had spent days waiting for a good bowl and none of the other places I tried were quite up to par, so I finally braved the (apparently constant) wait list to get a seat at the bar. The broth was flavorful and delicious, soup/veggies/noodles balanced, atmosphere made me feel I could walk out the door into Japan... the memory of the flavor stuck with me (addictive much? are they putting something else in this soup ;)?) and if I wasn't in another city now I would definitely be on my way back :)

I'm only giving Totto Ramen 3 stars for the TERRIBLE wait time. ?We got there 6:30 on a Sunday night, and ended up getting seated around 8:40. ?Granted it was a Sunday night and the place is TINY-- seats maybe 20 at a time-- but it was ridiculous. ?One of the people we were waiting in line with joked that he'd been waiting for days, and it kinda seemed like it, especially when we hit hour 2 of the wait. ? Onto the food. ?I haven't had Ippudo, which is what most people seem to compare this place to, but I've had my fair share of ramen, and this was the best. ?Am I convinced that the ramen was worth waiting for 2.5+ hours? ?Not really, and I will never do that again. ?But it was truly delicious for what that was worth. ?We split the special seasoned pork and rice appetizer, which was a well-seasoned lump of shredded pork and scallions over a bed of rice. ?It was good, though pork at Totto is the best when it's the char siu (pork belly). My boyfriend had the Totto Spicy Ramen, which wasn't too spicy, but had a nice kick to it. ?He got his with the extra char siu, which was a great call cause its melt-in-your-mouth delicious. ?I ordered the Totto Miso Ramen, which was really good, especially if you are a broth/soup lover like me. I ordered it with the seasoned avocado, which was unnecessary- the real star of the dish is the pork. ?Our noodles were different-- the miso ramen comes with wavy ramen noodles, that seemed slightly thicker and harder than the ones in his spicy ramen. It is definitely a cozy little place with some delicious ramen-- just be prepared for some kind of a wait, especially at peak hours/days.

So I went here because my cousin told me that I wouldn't have to wait in line. I got there around 2 pm and ended up waiting until 3 pm to eat. Oh well. The ramen was delicious. ?The texture was just right. ?The noodles were thinner than the ones at Ippudo but still good. ?Is it better than the ramen at Ippudo? I'm not sure. I think I like the noodles at Ipuddo better but I like the toppings and broth at Totto better. I'll have to try them again soon! Totto's one drawback is that it is cash only.

Amazing ramen, super fast, simple and delicious. There is usually a wait, but the line moves quickly, you're in and out in 30 minutes. We tried miso broth and the most flavorful chicken broth I've tasted (look at the vat of boiling whole chickens). Like pork? Like watching it flame broiled with a blow torch in front of you?

I just had another great bowl of Totto Miso Ramen and a bottle of Soju at around 4:30pm today. ?The weather was pretty warm, not a typical March day, so I was hoping that I would be able to grab a spot at the bar without too much of a wait. I was right! Perfection. We got seated after waiting for only 5 minutes. ?Now usually my BF and I crave this when the weather is cold because it can get pretty steamy inside when you are seated at the bar right where the guys cook the ramen, but we were feeling particularly deprived so we went for it. We got a spot right at the end of the bar near the door and it was like the trade winds were blowing to keep us cool. Heaven! My BF ordered the pork with rice and yuzu mayo and it was so good we got another one to share after I finished off my bowl of Ramen. I love the guys who do the cooking and the staff. If you go at the right time (around 4pm to 5pm) you can have a really leisurely and enjoyable feast sipping soju or sake or sapporo and listening to the great music that they always have on the stereo system. I have been on the list for the long wait at night in the cold weather and it is still great, but not as good as getting in after only a 5 minute wait. This is pretty much my favorite place to eat in NYC. It's not just about the food. It is the whole atmosphere and the people. Just great.

We passed Totto Ramen, saw the crowd, read the Yelp review and decided we had to try this place out.

This is one of the best ramen places I have ever been to, including the ones I have visited in Japan. Their broth is super rich and flavorful, but it is not too oily. Their chashu pork is equally great. The only downside of this place is that since it is literally a hole in the wall, the line gets pretty long during the weekends. Although it usually goes a lot faster than Ippudo, it is still annoying that you have to wait for an hour just for a bowl of noodle. The service is usually good. Me and my bf once got there at around 6 for sunday dinner, but the place wasn't even open although they said on their website that their dinner is from 5. There was an insanely long line in front of us already but the people there didn't seem to be in a hurry at all; one of the guys was even drinking beer as he was kind of cleaning the tables. We ended up having to wait for about 45 minutes until we finally got seated. But I would go back , if the weather is nice and I am not too hungry.

We heard really good reviews about this place so we've wanted to try it for awhile. We went there yesterday around 2.30pm and there was still a 30 minute wait. The guy at the front looking after the wait list is a real character. The staff are all really friendly. I asked the wait list guy for recommendations and he said his favorite was the Totto Miso Ramen but the Spicy Ramen was the most popular so we ordered both. I had the Totto Miso with extra spicy bamboo shoots. My husband had the Spicy with extra pork belly. The Totto Miso broth was very flavorful but a bit salty for my liking but the noodles were good, very chewy which is the way I like it. The bamboo shoots were supposed to be spicy but it wasn't. If you're after something traditional go the Totto Miso. For the carnivores, there's the Niku Ramen which is an extra large bowl of ramen with lots and lots of meat. We didn't have it but the guy sitting next to us did and it looked really good. I think Ippudo is still better but this place rates second.

The mass of people waiting outside at 11:30 am for Totto to open at noon for lunch should say it all, this place has the best Ramen I have had in this city! My husband and I joined the crowded and waited for 45 mins to get two seats at the bar....we were happily rewarded with two giant bowls of piping hot noodles! ?Most patrons are Japanese, and the Japanese know their ramen... The restaurant is small, service is fast and the soup is to die for. ?This is not however the type of place where you linger over your food, the angry glares of the people waiting outside in the cold for a table is enough to keep you slurping fast....

When it comes to ramen, the soup base is the most important element for the overall appreciation of it. I ordered the spicy ramen with broiled egg and extra cha siu (pork). It comes with the chicken broth soup base that is EXCELLENT. Just take a sip of the soup before trying the noodles, you would just want to drink it all... And the cha siu is really good too. They use the butane torch to give the surface of cha siu a slight burnt and the melted fat is absorbed by the meat...taste soooo good. It comes with two pieces of cha siu and for extra $2 you get two more pieces. Boiled egg is okay, nothing special... The restaurant is very small and has only ~15 seats. It was about 1 hr 20 min wait from 9:50pm on Thursday. I would definitely go again even though it takes so long for the wait.

Totto (Chicken Man) Ramen is a little hole in the wall place, like many ramen restaurants in Japan, and an affiliate of Hide-Chan across town. Totto is chicken broth oriented, but they have several varieties to choose from. I've had the regular, the spicy, and the meat lovers' ramen. Beware the meat lovers' (niku ramen)! It has, like, an entire pig in the bowl, which is also extra large, so you are unlikely to need kaedama. I couldn't even finish it all, which must be a first in my dining history. Niku Ramen is really tasty and satisfying, though. The broth just really warms the heart. It's off menu, so you have to ask for it. $15. The other options are fine, too, though I prefer Hide-chan a little bit. At both places, you will probably find the ramen palette-killing salty, as it is traditionally served in the States. Unfortunately, going there requires a trek to the East side. There is almost always a line and a sign-up list at Totto, so you are likely going to wait. If you show up alone, you have a better chance at quickly getting a seat at the bar. Otherwise, be prepared to endure the retarded (literally) new New York dining ritual. I had lunch here yesterday and had to listen to the two guys next to me enthusing about how great the ramen is. I think they wanted to suck the chef's cock, they were carrying on about it so much. So that's a positive review for you. As far as I can tell, the ramen here is totally fine, but it's never going to satisfy a ramen purist who's been to Japan. But nothing can satisfy them. Comparisons to Ippudo, I should add, miss the point entirely.

I've been here twice now and the wait has only gotten crazier. For 2 ppl, we had to wait for over an hour at 8pm on a Wed night. However, their chicken ramen has never let me down. I always order the "extreme spicy" because they give you the hot pepper oil in a little sauce bowl and you can add as much or as little as you want. If you order simply the "spicy ramen", they add the hot sauce in themselves, so it's a toss up on whether you can handle it. The broth is delicious and the ramen is perfectly "al dente"... add some fatty pork, bean sprouts, scallions, and nori and you've got yourself a winner! The best part is the seasoned avocado slices - DEFINITELY GET IT! It's basically very ripe avocado marinated in soy sauce and ninja spices - which translates into deliciousness in the ramen. The chefs behind the counter are hilarious and good-humored, but the host and wait staff could be surly at times. I love Totto Ramen but I wish they were bigger (it's very cramped in there) and the wait time was less.

Frankly I think the food is better at Momofuku. ?The only reason I've ever been here is because my friend loves their vegetarian ramen, which apparently is the only one she knows of in the city. ?I did try the veggie ramen last time and it was better than the miso ramen I had the other time I came. ?I will also say that the noodles here are good- the right consistency. ?Other than that I wouldn't go out of my way to come here- it's not in a neighborhood I frequent, there's always a long-ass line, the place is tiny and lacks ambiance, and the service is a bit rude (which is the most off-putting out of all the above). ?Also it's cash-only, which I find incredibly inconvenient on top of everything else. ?If you've gotta have veggie ramen, I guess this is the only place you'll find it, but for other types of ramen I've had better elsewhere.

I came with high expectations - after all, a restaurant with a constant 1 hr wait must be good, right? I started my meal with an order of Broiled Char Siu Pork, which was simple enough and was okay, but could have been slightly more tender. I then chose the Totto Miso Ramen with chicken and was...sadly disappointed. The chicken seemed just like boiled chicken; I don't think they should even offer chicken as an option with the ramen. The soup was not spectacular, it was rather light and lacking depth; it kind of reminded me of Chinese noodle soup. After all the raving reviews I had heard of Totto ramen, I had really expected something great, but sadly I have to say this may be one of my least favorite ramen places in New York. Shame, because I really like Yakitori Totto...

I usually do not like going to ramen bars, as I had my right pinky chopped off by a Tokyo crime boss, Boss Taki, in a ramen bar in the Koto ward years ago. ?However, this past Friday, the day after Thanksgiving, some friends were meeting up at Totto Ramen, and I was intrigued enough to venture out on what was a very chilly evening. ?We stood outside in the frigid night air for 1.5 hours waiting for a table. ?Yes, 90 minutes. ?The young fellow taking names and organizing the seating was wearing Nike high-tops and had a haircut that seemed to be a cross between a perm and something else. ?Anyhow, the matter at hand. ?We were finally seated by our funny-haired friend, and let me tell you, it was worth the wait. ?I had the spicy ramen and it was easily the best ramen I've ever tasted. ?The broth was intoxicating, as were the strips of pork. ?Inebriated by the deep and bold broth, I excused myself and went to the washroom. ?As I entered, I heard a man using one of the stalls, whistling "It's a Small World After All" in such a way that I knew it could be none other than Boss Taki, the man who had robbed me of my right pinky years earlier. ?I will not describe what came next, but I will say the loss of my little finger has been revenged. ?What an excellent night: superb Ramen and vengeance!

As many people have mentioned in other reviews, you really have to be prepared to wait for a little while before getting seated. ?But it is totally worth it, since the warmness of the ramen really rewards standing in the unforgivable coldness of winter. ?I am a meat lover so I got one of the extra meaty ramen, and it was good!! ?The place is quite small so be prepared to listen on your neighbours or have your neighbours listen in on you, but it is NY so people really don't give a d**n about you anyways. ?But yeah, definitely recommend this place.

i traveled north past 34 street, past 42 street into the far-west of 52 to taste the totto ramen. the broth was decent, not too salty but watery and mild, ok noodles, pleanty of vegetables and meat. over all out of balance with all those raw vegetables. best ramen in midtown so far, but not worth a trip or a long wait. worth the price, can't complain about that of course. downtown still rules. it's minca, it's ippudo

I've had ramen all over SF and LA but this is by far my favorite! I ordered the original ramen and my friend got the spicy ramen. I love the rich chicken broth they use and charred pork they put into the soup! It's flavorful but delicate--almost to the point that I didn't notice the fattiness typical of ramen noodle soup. ?My friend got the spicy ramen and it was delicious as well!! Because we weren't sure how spicy it would be, they gave us the spicy chili oil on the side so we can add as much/little as we liked. The wait was long and the take cash only (had to walk about 5 blocks to the BofA on broadway), but the noodles were well worth it. Service is prompt once you get in, but as everyone else noted- prepare to wait about an hour to be seated. Note that they WILL cross your name off the list if you're not here when called. Please send me a msg if you have other ramen place recs!! Thanks!

It was a cold night and I was craving ramen, so my friend suggested we go somewhere in her neighborhood. She offered to wait since the line gets crazy..you definitely have to plan to come here since the wait is probably about an hour for two people since the venue is really small.. mostly bar seating with a few tables. We ordered some tuna appetizer served with avocado which was pretty good. I also ordered the cheese corn.. yep it's exactly what it sounds like. They take corn, put a slice of american cheese on it, and torch the puppy. I think if the corn was hotter to start with.. this would have tasted better.. but it was still good. We sat at the bar so it was cool to watch them cook the meat with a blow torch and boilng the noodles in single serving baskets. I ordered the spicy ramen, which was delicious. The broth is awesome.. not too spicy.. and the noodles were cooked really well.. chewy and not soggy. I have never been to Ippudo, but my friend says that Totto Ramen ranks up there with Ippudo for her.

Really impressed by the vegetable spicy ramen (almost positive it was vegetarian too.) Great broth/noodles with lots of vegetables--asparagus, avocado, tomato, shredded mushroom(?), lettuce. Tried the pork too--very good, but also much simpler. Pretty good wait already at noon.

5 Stars. Yes, the wait is long. Yes, I put my name down, went to the gym, came back, and still waited 45 min. But it was so worth it. 2 minutes after I sat down at the table, my appetizers were served. 2 minutes later, my Ramen was served. I got the Extra Spicy Ramen. Unbelievable, but make sure you are judicious with the spicy sauce they give you as it is no joke. You know its very authentic, when 90% of the restraunt is Japenese people. The only thing that struck me as odd, was the music. It was like hiphop/trendy/american music. It just didn't fit. But honestly, WHO CARES? Food is to die for.

Hands-down, the BEST ramen I've ever had!!! ?So good, that I had to have 2 bowls of it. ?I had the spicy char siu (pork) ramen and it was soo delish! ?This place gets minus 1 star because the wait is SUPER long (we arrived at 8pm on a Sunday and sat down 1 hr, 45 min later), they initially brought our order to another table, and the Avocado Tartare appetizer was just ok (3.5 stars on that). ?Definitely worth eating here tho!

This place is new so I had high hopes for it. I went there this past Friday, ordered the chicken totto ramen and actually enjoyed it, thinking it was quite tasty - not being a pork broth made it a suprsingly positie experience. Two hours later, I'm realizing something is not right and I'm stuck with food poisoning. Their meat was not taken care of well - either it was out too long, or just spoiled. I called them the next day to let them know and to my displeasure, had no luck with them - they can barely speak english so I don't know if they understood my purpose of my call. Needless to say, my weekend was ruined and I am now watching the Final World Cup at home, drinking water and burnt toast to get rid of any left over bacteria vs. watching it with friends in a bar drinking a nice cold beer. I get they are new but this has left a bad taste in my mouth and I probably will never come back again.

Totto ramen is authentic, simple, a slice of heaven in your bowl. ?The wait is outrageous but if you go in group of 2s I think it helps. ?We were 3 - kinda like a tetris piece that doesn't fit anywhere :( ? At any rate, we ordered the pork belly on a bed of bean sprouts and the pork just melted in your mouth. ?I was a little less crazy about their avotuna. ?But I felt that their main show, ramen, was simply unbeatable. ?Broth was light and clean, noodles were perfectly al dente, and the spicy sesame oil added just enough kick to make it very very flavorful. ?We devoured our bowls in 7 minutes and walked out of there thinking how beautiful life is. ?Addictive.

appeals to all senses: smelled heavenly as you wait patiently for your own bowl; sound of noodles being drained in coriander; combination of colors and presentation before you dig in; and finally amazing ramen texture, savory broth, and perfectly seared pork. restaurant had an authentic japanese feeling, mostly because the people cooking are japanese!

So one of our Japanese friends were raving about this place so we knew we had to try. ?This was realllly good. ?We are trying to decide if we like it more than Ippudo, the good part is that it is definitely cheaper!! ?A big difference is the broth in this is chicken based. ?We had the chicken paitan ramen and miso ramen. ?They ran out of the wavy noodles so we also had the straight noodles in the miso ramen. ?We really liked the broth, so flavorful and hearty. ?The miso ramen got a little salty because of the miso/pork scoop. We will definitely be back!

This has quickly become my favorite Ramen place in NYC. I must say, the anticipation probably doesn't hurt - it's very small, and I've never waited less than 1/2 hour to be seated when not by myself. However, it's never been more than 15 minutes between being seated and having my food. I've sampled most of the menu, and my favorites has to be the Extreme Spicy Ramen - it's a very complex spicy that still lets the amazing flavors shine through, and the spicy Rayu is served on the side so you are able to control your heat level. The broth is excellent on its own - not as porky or smoky as other places, but very flavorful and not too salty. The side of Char-siu chunks are also a must-have, but it's a huge portion - better for a couple to share. ?If you're by yourself, grab an Ika-Yaki - it's the most delicate squid I've ever tasted. The waitstaff is very friendly as well. I'd recommend this place on a nice day where you don't mind hanging around outside while waiting to be seated. (They do cover up a pretty sizable area outside during the winter.)

I love Yakitori Totto and noodles so it was natural for me to be curious about Totto Ramen. ?I came here with a friend who recently moved to NYC from the West Coast. ?We didn't wait long since we arrived before 7pm on a Tuesday. ?The restaurant is small and cozy with counter space on the left and about 3 or 4 tables in the back. ?The service is friendly and fairly attentive. ?I was surprised at how small the menu was. ?They only serve ramen - no gyoza - with toppings like boiled egg, spicy bamboo shoots, and extra pork. ?I went with Paitan which is similar to Tonkotsu but made with chicken rather than pork. ?It was really tasty and the noodles were delicious but I wasn't a fan of the broth's sweetness. ?I saw a lot of sautéed/cooked onions on top so it's probably coming from there. ?Other than that I like this place because the noodles have a nice texture and the ingredients are fresh. ?The pork is DELIC! ?It practically melts in your mouth. ?They blowtorch each slice which is fun to watch and listen to it crackle. ?I would come back if I am in the neighborhood but Rockmeisha is still ichiban.

The ramen here is very good, though perhaps just a little too salty. The meat on my ramen was of better quality than I usually find at ramen restaurants, so that earns them some extra credit though. The tuna sashimi and avocado side was a bit too garlicky for me.

The down low on this place is that the ramen is excellent and the wait is long no matter what time you go. What you can do is put your name on the waiting list and then go for a drink at one of the many bars in the area and then come back before your name get's called. I got the Totto Chicken Paitan Ramen on my first visit and then on the second visit I got the Totto Spicy Ramen, which I believe is just the regular Chicken Paitan Ramen with spicy sesame oil mixed in. Even though I usually prefer spicer food, I preferred the regular chicken ramen more. I thought the spicyness masked the hearty chicken broth flavor. The noodles were great and had a lil bit of that chewiness that I like. You can get an extra serving of noodles for 2.50. As for side dishes I have tried the Broiled Char Siu Pork and the Spicy Tuna Don which were both excellent. The pork is nice and fatty and the Spicy Tuna Don was seasoned perfectly. Next time I go I will try the meat lovers ramen which is the Chicken ramen covered by a layer of various cuts of pork for $15.

Was very excited to test out this place after all the ramen hype. ?Was just at Ippudo and was impressed. ? We did go a little early, around 6p and still had to wait about 45 mins. The place is super tiny, very Tokyo like, which was fine. But sitting at the bar with your legs dangling and no where to put your bag told you this is not a place to sit, take your time to hang out and chit chat. ? So we order couple of apps, the Ika (squide) skewers. Very dry and practically couldn't take it off the sticks without eating it like a caveman. Then we got the Avo Tuna, very very well seasoned with the avocado, pleasantly surprised. ?Now for the true test, Spicy Ramen. ?The ramen noodles were not the usual kind, more spaghetti like and not curly. Stil, it was good. Not great. The atmosphere is cool, with all workers prety much at arms reach. Overall, it was good. I think there are better ramen places out there without the wait. Back to Ippudo.

If you like ramen, you will love Totto. ?I got their niku ramen, which was just tons of meat (which you'd expect based on the title) in their chicken based broth with noodles and lots of the standard toppings. ?The atmosphere in here is lovely, and the food is DELICIOUS. ?It is worth the line, worth the wait, worth suffering whatever weather is outside that day, it will all be redeemed when you get your food. ?It is fantastic!

Char Siu Pork with rice was amazingly delicious. Tried some of their ramen it was pretty good too. I definitely would order the rice with char siu pork as an appetizer then get a bowl of ramen. Took 1.5 hours to seated because its like a hole in the wall and is very small. Service was great though. I ate 2 hours before I got here so I was still stuffed, if i was hungry maybe I would give this place 5 stars.

Being from LA, I think the ramen is actually better there than at Totto....also Totto is very small and if you happen to sit at the "bar" area in front of where they cook, prepare to SWEAT from the heat. Otherwise, it's a quick joint to get your ramen filling without paying the Ippudo NY cost.

hype can be tricky, but totto doesn't disappoint. prepare to wait 30-45 minutes, and make sure you put your name down on the list that hangs from the door. try to sit at the bar so you can watch the action in the kitchen, which is literally in your face. the giant vats prepare the broth while the pork belly is toasted with a blowtorch...always fun to watch. the food comes quickly, and disappears even faster. i've had the miso and the spicy ramen, and they were both delicious (add sliced avocado to everything, you won't regret it). glad to see some good food in what would otherwise be a dead area.

the spicy ramen is delicious. ?the broth is dense and flavorful but not heavy, and the pork is cooked perfectly-- some might not like it for it is not 'melt in your mouth' like a lot of other popular ramen places like to cook their pork, but i like it when a piece of belly tastes like a piece of meat that is fatty but not greasy, rather than globules of melty fat. ?if it weren't for the wait, i'd always come here for ramen.

OK, so I tried Totto since its constantly compared to Ippudo and I am obsessed with Ippudo so here is my brain dump on this place. I showed up around 7, expecting to wait, and we waited. There were a lot of japanese people there-a good sign. We waited and were seated at a teeny table, just far enough so that we didnt elbow the people at the next table. I dont really remember what we ordered but everything was covered in scallions. The ramen was good-didnt leave much of it in the bowl. I liked it. The service was fine. But overall I still like Ippudo better-definitely a more spacious and comfortable environment and I like the ramen better too. Totto had pieces of paper haphazardly taped all over the walls with different specials on them, so your head was turning in every direction trying to read them all. The menu itself I think had 4 kinds of ramen but none of them seemed much different from each other. Im not sure I'd go back here again except it is close to my office so you never know. Next time Ill tell them take it easy with the scallions.

step down into the tiniest of rooms, hot with char sui pork being torched and 6 small wire baskets of noodles being boiled al dente. the guys behind the bar are friendly and brisk, singing japanese songs while they work. less than 10 minutes after placing the order, a piping bowl of decadent chicken broth, noodles, char sui pork, chopped onions, scallions, and nori is placed before you. it is heavenly. it is an experience you don't want to end. and when it does, it is something you want to eat again, even if you have to wait in line for another hour and a half.

we are ramen fiends! we've tried ramen all over the city - ippudo, minca, rai rai ken, menkui tei, hide-chan, etc. - and ramen totto has now replaced ippudo as my favorite ramen spot. dont get me wrong, ippudo is still delicious, but i find ramen totto more delicate in flavor and not as overwhelming. since ippudo uses the tonkotsu pork broth, it tends to get a bit heavy towards the end--too rich. ramen totto's chicken broth doesn't have this problem, and stays perfectly savory and delicious right down to the last bite! the broth is the best part, and the noodles are good in thickness and density as well. i prefer mine spicy, and order the spicy bamboo shoots on the side for an extra kick of flavor. the price point is also a lot more manageable than that of ippudo! the only con, and it's a significant one, is that the place is TINY so there's ALWAYS a considerable line. however, the turnover is usually decently fast, so the wait isn't THAT bad, but is still annoying. recommended dish: spicy chicken ramen + bamboo shoots pros: delicious broth and ramen cons: tiny location and long wait

I'm a big fan of the chicken broth. Probably because it reminds me of the soup noodles I used to have back in the PRC as a kid. The taste is more delicated than the usual miso ramen at other ramen joints. I see people rave about the torched pork, it's pretty good but the catch is still the broth for me. The portions are pretty small but most people will be full if they get kaedama. If you like your food spicy, get the extreme rayu on the side.

Expect to wait. At 5pm opening time there is already a crowd converging on the entrance like vultures as the waiter holds the waiting list. Tiny place but has a great cosy authentic feel to it. I love how everyone tehre is actually Japanese. Chefs are super friendly and will happily chat away to each other and to you. Chicken ramen and spicy ramen are great, the chashu don (pork and rice) appetiser is amazing. They are also open till midnight which is handy, although have been a few times when they have closed early for some reason or closed for special events.

The best ramen I've had in this budget range. ?I had the spicey ramen for $10.50...the noodles were cooked just right and the broth and pork were very flavorful. ?We were digging how they cook the pork by blow torching it, giving it a nice crisp finish! ?They also have a plethora of different toppings (I wouldn't recommend the corn though. ?It's corn on the cob with a slice of bland cheese on top, and a pain to eat with the ramen; you basically have to eat it separately) and side dishes (Try the Avo Tuna!). If you eat at the counter, it's fun watching the friendly and animated cooks. ?The restaurant is small so be prepared to wait a little, especially for larger groups. Thankfully they have an enclosed waiting area with a space heater that keeps it warm. Basically, it's not the greatest ramen in town but a good deal for its price! I would definitely come back for my ramen fix.

My friend and I waited about 25 mins to get seated, but it was worth it. The ramen is full of flavor but not too salty. The broth is less greasy than some other ramen places, probably because it's made from chicken instead of pork. My pieces of the roast pork were a bit on the fatty side but it was very tender. I highly recommend the spicy ramen. Will be back!!

After trying, and failing miserably to get into Ippudo for a few weekends, I happened to drive by this little joint by accident one day with my son when we were on our way home from a day in Times Square. We stopped, hoping to get a seat...but at 5:30 on a Saturday, you better have patience and/or be VERY hungry...because you WILL wait. I don't and I wasn't so we left. We did, however go back the very next weekend at 4;30, (they open the doors at 5PM sharp) and we were number two on the list. We decided to sit at the end of the bar, right in front of the GIANT, smoldering cauldren of soup stock simmering on the fire, (BIG MISTAKE...unless you wearing a tank top and shorts). Anyway...the Ramen. One word...MAGNIFICANT!!! The stock was rich, and hearty flavored with supreme umame, the fifth sense of taste, according to the japaneese anyway. The noodles were cooked a teeny, tiny bit on the al dente side for my taste but I suspect if you let it sit for a few minutes...they will soften up. Good luck with that one because as soon as the bowl is presented to you...you wanna get right in, especially on such a cold night...as it was when we went.. The two slices of roast pork are singed by the chef with a blow torch right before they are placed in the bowl. And the whole concoction is sprinkled with a few bits of perfectly fried garlic pieces. All in all, a delicious bowl of asian soup that goes right up there with my all time favorite, Vietnameese beef Pho from Nha Trang. We will definately be going back soon! By the way, the entire staff is wonderfully friendly, and the chef even apoligized to me for the wait when I told him I tried to get in the weekend before and could not. It's OK chef!

Note this is chicken based ramen unlike the more typical pork based ramen at, for example, Setagaya. ?It's good but it's chicken based.

i didn't think that i would like this place. i didn't think ramen would taste so good! i got the chicken ramen and a squid special. it was delicious. you do have to wait in line for some time but it's definately worth it. it's best not to go here in big groups as the space is small.

This place is pretty damn great: kind of like a smaller, more neighborhood-y Ippudo. The style of Ramen is different ?(I honestly think the Ippudo style is a bit better), but the food here is quite amazing. The soup doesn't quite have the complexity of Ippudo but the noodles and toppings make up for it, I was originally thrown by the pickled avocado but if you only get a bit of it with a mouthful of soup, the tastes and textures blend in a marvelous way. I would personally recommend getting a ramen and a side of seared tuna and pickled avocado and putting most of the avocado into the ramen. As for the varieties of ramen, it's kind of hard to tell the difference between varieties, the spicy ramen isn't too hot but the original variety is definitely worth the crazy wait that you'll have to endure if you want to dine at semi normal hours. The service is good and the chefs are all really nice guys, which is a cool bonus as well.

35 min wait on a Tuesday night. Passed the time by getting a quick beer on 9th Ave. Ordered the Chicken Paitan Ramen with extra Char Siu Pork and the Avo Tuna. The chicken broth was velvety good and reminded me of liquid mashed potatoes. No broth was left behind. The ramen itself was perfect al dente. I expected the pork belly to melt in my mouth but disappointly it was a bit tough. If I ordered additional toppings like bamboo, corn, and kikurage mushroom it might have been a bit better from a texture contrast perspective. Ramen always makes me happy so it was a good overall experience. The Avo Tuna was 3 pieces torched tuna sashimi and marinaded avocado. There was a bit too much dried garlic on the sashimi which overpowered the dish. The yuzu mayo was a good compliment. Might go back and try the miso or the extra spicy ramen. One person needed extra broth since it was too spicy for him. I look forward to the challenge.

visited on a weeknight, arrived around 4:50 and had one couple in front of me. ?sat at the counter and i think the counter stools are a little small for my wide american ass. ?got the spicy ramen. ?it looks kinda plain, served with a sheet of nori, 2 fatty pork slices and scallions. ?i liked the texture of the noodles a lot and i even forgot to order them katame. they were chewy yet firm. ?broth had nice flavor. i wish there was at least an egg or something. ?i didn't see it on the menu but the night i went was ramen and drinks available only anyway. it's a fun setting but not sure if it's somewhere i'd wait in a long line to get in. it totally seems like a place that should have a ticket vending machine outside and you can go in and slurp up a bowl solo for lunch. ?i left around 5:30 (i think they gave my ramen order to someone else so i had to wait a little longer, so turnover could technically be faster) and there were still around 4 seats that hadn't filled yet.

they just opened up and are only serving ramen, beer and sake. the place is small. i came by myself so i was seated in a couple of minutes. i ordered the totto chicken ramen and a sapporo. i watched one of the cooks take a flamethrower to a platter of sliced pork while another one manned the noodles. the ramen tasted good, but the ramen to broth ratio was way out of proportion. i just like that its close to work. i might go back to try the spicy ramen, but not until winter.

45 min. wait on monday evening, got chicken paitan ramen w/ spicy bamboo. ramen was perfect, broth was sublime, but the bamboos, BE CAREFULL!! bamboos are covered in chili pepper flakes and will make your soup too red and almost ?ruin the perfect balance, which i did... but next time i will just go for the spicy ramen, which my husband got, that was very goooooood!
