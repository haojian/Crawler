I am a food network watcher, so I was pretty excited to try Morimoto on my visit to NY. Everything was great- service, ambiance, food. But I sooo enjoyed the Roasted Ocean Trout. It had a great, light texture, it was moist and had truffle flavor in every bite. The little white radish pieces on top tasted sweet like apples in combination with the rest of the dish. It was most likely the best piece of fish I had ever had. The restaurant is beautiful. Even the restrooms have a 3D garden in the walls! The servers were very nice and had great recommendations. the cocktails were yummy too- I think I had some lychee martini which really taste like a lychee in liquid form. I had a really nice time and I hope I can come back someday and try the tasting menu!

I came to this place with zero expectations. I heard decent reviews of this place and the whole Iron Chef thing just kind of makes people think this place is good. Well, let me tell you, this place is ridiculously amazing. Even the bathroom is awesome! The restaurant is very modern. Sliding doors, sleek furniture, amazing bar and just an overall clean and sleek look and feel. That alone already started my experience and the food really just sent me over the edge. I am in LOVE with this place and it is seriously worth the splurge. We started with the tofu and the spicy king crab legs. I am not a fan of tofu at all, but this tofu was amazing. The tofu dish was a show: it started with a bowl of liquid and they add some concoction to it and ten minutes later, it became tofu. They top it with mushroom soup and you can add rice crackers to it. When I say I hate tofu, I mean it, but I could eat this for days! The king crab leg was fish roe and spicy mayo mixed together and topped on juicy crab legs. This dish was pricey, but so worth it. I dreamt about it last night it was so good. On to the main dish, I had the sea bass which was a very good sized portion and so juicy and flavorful. I love fish and I love aquagrill, but Morimoto knows how to cook his fish. When I say flavorful, I mean it. Every bite is bursting with all the tastes from the sauce and it really is a party for your mouth. I will say, the table next to us ordered the steak and I was drooling. I really had to control myself from asking them for a piece. For a seafood restaurant, they know how to cook a steak. We finished our meal with the flourless chocolate cake and the red bean doughnuts. The cake was so rich and fudgy and is seriously a chocolate lovers dream. The doughnuts were good, but I liked the frozen yogurt that it came with much more. Of the two desserts, I'd go with the chocolate cake. Our server was a little slow and essentially forgot about us. While I didn't mind the 3 hours meal, it would have been a lot less if he actually paid attention. Minus 1 star for that, but food wise this is a 5 star restaurant. They also do make sure that their customers are happy. The table next to us had their steak cooked wrong and not only did they recook it, the manager came over to apologize and they comped the steak and threw in dessert and a glass of wine. Not a big deal for Morimoto, but they do value their customers happiness. All in all, I would definitely come back here. The food and experience is worth every penny.

You know, it's possible my view of this place is skewed because I was having a "bad day" (It was my 32nd birthday, and I was being a whiny little shit) With that being said! First and foremost, the staff was amazing. The hostess', the bar tender and our server were outstanding. During our meal, like in any good restaurant, the manager came over to check on us and even HE was memorable enough for me mention him positively here in the review. Staff is GREAT! Food: I hate to say this, because I really had high hopes, but I wasn't SUPER impressed. Was the food good, ABSOLUTELY. Was I confused by some of the menu items, ABSOLUTELY. The Miso soup btw, really not very good. Probably the reason I'm rating it three stars (and remember, it may have been four if my mood were different) All in all, it's VERY VERY expensive... so was it worth it? Would I go back? Probably... not.

We came here with our sales rep so everything is paid for! Lucky for us! Anyway, the restaurant is modern and chic. We were seated downstairs in the lounge area. It was fairly early so nobody was around us until later 7PM. I tried their Bluebell cocktail to start the night. It is amazing. I think every girl should try this. Don't get the Moritini because it tastes like sashimi. We got the Rock Shrimp Tempura as appetizer to share. They brought out two flavors of tempura. One is slightly saltier and closer to Buffalo Wing style and the other is lightly battered fried shrimp and a plate of Ranch dressing. It is definitely very different from your regular shrimp tempura. We also got the Lobster Fritters and again it is very unique and unlike any other fritters I have had. In fact, it is more like a takoyaki ball but with lobster inside. For sushi, we got the spicy tuna roll and eel and avocado rolls. They are both pretty good but honestly I think for the price, it should have been better. The sushi rice was not particularly outstanding. The sashimi platter we got however was very fresh and top quality. I had to leave the party earlier but the overall experience was pleasant and the service was attentive. Definitely a great place for date night and enjoy great sashimi

Firstly, let's begin with the obvious. This is a restaurant that is bolstered by the name of iron chef Morimoto. Thus, it is expected to be and actually is pretty amazing. However, I have been to the Philadelphia location as well and although both restaurants have a captivating ambience, I liked the decor of the Philadelphia location a tad bit more. The menu for each location is different as well. However, I do not prefer one over the other and think they both offer a great selection. The seafood is fresh and well-prepared as expected. Now let's fast forward to my personal favorite, dessert. The chilled cheesecake soufflé was impeccable, especially the green tea powder, which to my surprise ended up being my favorite part. It was not only visually alluring but a very light and lovely dessert that I highly recommend. Why four stars instead of five? The location is kind of odd, not only is it in the middle of nowhere New York (I didn't even know that was possible until this restaurant), but even when you are right in front of it, you cannot tell that there is a restaurant behind the awkwardly placed red curtains. Secondly, the tables are too close for comfort. We were seated in between two couples, all the girls on one side and the guys were on the other. It could have easily been mistaken for speed dating, you could hear the entirety of each others conversations. All in all, despite these minor flaws. I have said it before and I will say it again, the iron chef can do no wrong. An exquisite restaurant that will ensure a splendid dining experience.

This place is consistently fresh, delicious and enjoyable. Order: toro tartare, calamari tempura salad and lots of sashimi! I love this place. Every experience is enjoyable. The service is great, the interior is gorgeous, and the fish is fresh and delicious. You just can't go wrong. It can get particularly expensive when you are drinking cocktails, so be prepared!

OMG. I don't eat sushi and definitely don't eat oysters. After the 7 course Omikase, I must reassess both of those statements. From the tuna tartar to the mango soup, every course was just awesome. They recommend the 7 course tasting menu, and I would do it. Next time tell the wait staff you did the 7 course already and get 7 new dishes.

Many pros, some cons. I took my husband here for his birthday and made a reservation via OpenTable. We arrived exactly on time for our reservation, yet we had to wait 15 minutes while others came in and were seated immediately. Nobody explained why or spoke to us about it, so we were a little confused. I was feeling a little reluctant and we hadn't even sat down yet. COCKTAILS ($14 each): My husband ordered the Morimotini (wasabi infused vodka, sake, cucumbers) and it was very delicious. I ordered the Camellia but I am pretty sure they gave me the wrong drink - it supposedly had cranberry, elderflower and sake, but when it came out, it was BRIGHT red (like Kool-Aid) and I could not taste any of those ingredients. It actually tasted exactly like Hawaiian punch. ?I sent it back, the manager came over to help me choose another drink, and the Camellia was never added to the bill. My second drink was much better. MEAL: We went with the 7-course Omakase tasting menu. It was quite tasty, although the portions were TINY and for the price ($125) I would have expected a little more. We have done tasting menus at many high-end restaurants, including Per Se, and I think the Morimoto Omakase would have been better priced at $90 or $100 a person. Granted, it did include wagyue beef, lobster, sushi and foie gras, but... definitely not worth $125. Tip not included, unlike other restaurants' tasting menus. Seating was a little weird (bench on one side and chairs on the other) because you are SUPER close to other couples. I heard the whole conversation of the couple next to me. I'd want something a little more cozy instead of being crammed in like sardines. Overall, nice night. A little more money than I think it was worth, but good food. We had a slice of pizza afterward because we were a little hungry :-o

Morimoto Restaurant, eponymously named after it's creator Masahru Morimoto of Food Network's Food Network's Iron Chef , was near the top of my dining establishment hitlist during a short trip to New York City. Most popular with their Omakase menu, Morimoto also offers an a la cart menu that would please anyone looking for an Asian-fusion dining experience. DECOR: The decor of Morimoto is a confusing work of art. A maze of translucent Plexiglass shapes the room, separating the crowded tables. Scattered throughout this maze is an open kitchen, a pretentious looking bar, and sporadic fixtures providing dim lighting to the room. This place has a esoteric vibe, giving you the impression that this was where it's all happening. You are at the very center of it all and there's no cooler place to be right now, than to be dining at Morimoto's DRINKS: They have an extensive wine and cocktail list here, and after long deliberation we went with the Selbach Reisling. Sweet, frangrant, and went down like candy. FOOD: Yellowtail Pastrami ($21) - togarashi, gin creme fraiche, and candided olive The yellow tail pastrami was an attempt at an adventurous order, as you don't often see the words "yellowtail", and "pastrami" next to each other. I really had no clue what to expect. I personally wasn't overly amorous of this appetizer. It had a fishy aftertaste, which may be just the nature of yellow tail. A neat concept to serve sashimi fish pastrami style, but it didn't work for me. Hamachi Tartare($25) - osetra caviar, sour cream, wasabi, and dashi-soy The tartare is served on a flat tray with a dollop of caviar. To consume, you scoop a small spatula full of the fish, and dip it into the accompanying sauces. Almost felt like making a lollipop! Morimoto style Chirashi ($33) - 10-12 different fish and vegetables The chirashi is underwhelming at first glance, but as you work your way through it you realize it's a solid bowl of rice and fish. It's filled to the brim with perfectly made sushi rice and bite size cubes of fish of great variety. Duck, Duck, Duck ($32) - foie gras croissant, roast duck, soft duck egg, red miso sauce I ordered the Duck Duck Duck, as a result of successful menu marketing. I admit if it weren't for the name, it might not have ordered it. The dish came on a gigantic plate that literally took up my entire table space. The duck however was delicious! A runny duck egg, crispy skinned duck leg, and a duck breast sandwich. The style of this dish wasn't too far off from Chinese style roasted duck, but the meat was in fact much more juicy and rich. OVERALL THOUGHTS: Considering the location, the amount of food, and the wine that we had, this bill was not outrageous at all. Surprising, since I went in with the impression that it would cost me an arm and a leg. Mind you, not everything was spectacular, but decent enough to have me come back to this socialite haven.

TIME/DATE: March 4, 2013 @ 2:30pm AMBIANCE: Beautiful minimalist-modern interior with a slightly industrial touch, and clean light colors. Decent natural light. Fun bathrooms, too! Morimoto's entrance is located behind the curtains to the left of the door to Chelsea Market. SERVICE: Excellent. They were rather informative, and were kind and accommodating when we called 2 days in advance to see if the kitchen would be willing to make foie gras chawan mushi for us, a dish that's usually only available for dinner. PRICE: $30-$75/person VALUE: The burger was a bit pricey, but definitely worth trying at least once. This was, after all, one of the first burgers of it's kind that popularized the concept of the uberburger. (This "ground-breaking" foie gras burger was founded in 1991.) CHANCE OF RETURNING: 100% NOTE: We only ordered items that we hadn't seen in the Morimoto Napa menu. My personal favorite dish from the Morimoto Napa lunch menu is the Sea Urchin Carbonara and I was surprised that it wasn't available in NY. So, those of you who visit Napa, make sure you try it! It's to die for. ___________________________________ :::: THE FOOD :::: * OYSTER FOIE GRAS w/MARKET OYSTERS, FOIE GRAS, UNI, & TERIYAKI SAUCE - $21 ? ? ? ? ? - [5/5 - SO delicious. The oysters were quite literally drenched in teriyaki sauce, but it actually worked in this case. The flavor of foie gras and uni was a bit more muffled by the sauce, but everything just worked once the combination landed in my mouth.] * FOIE GRAS CHAWAN MUSHI w/DUCK BREAST SHABU-SHABU, FRESH WASABI, SWEET SOY SAUCE - $17 ? ? ? ? ? - [4.5/5 - Delicious, creamy, warm, comforting. The foie gras flavor isn't as prominent here, either, but the dish was incredibly tasty all the same. Surprisingly, Dieci's own foie gras chawan mushi (which I had just a few days prior) still makes a fair comparison.] * WAGYU CUTLET SANDWICH w/MORIMOTO SPECIAL SAUCE - $19 ? ? ? ? ? - [4/5 - ?Tasty sandwich.] * RICE BOWL: UNAGI AND FOIE GRAS BOP - $27 ? ? ? ? ? - [4/5 - Very tasty. I would've appreciated slightly less rice so I could've tasted more of the unagi and foie gras. The rice was crispy on the bottom, without being charred. Also, with as much rice as they included, we had to ask for extra teriyaki sauce on the side. (We used an additional 1/4 of what they provided us with initially.) Make sure you mix it up well with your spoons!] * APPLE BREAD PUDDING w/GREEN TEA CRUMBLE & BROWN BUTTER ICE CREAM - $12 ? ? ? ? ? - [4.5/5 - This dish really took me by surprise. The green tea crumble was delicious, and the combination of the three just turned this into a dessert I will (and do) crave long after I dined here.] ___________________________________ Three out of 4 of the savory dishes we had used Morimoto's teriyaki sauce, so for a bit I did feel a bit like they were "cheating".. I mean, who *doesn't* like a good teriyaki sauce? Funny thing, much as I used to secretly judge people who ONLY ordered teriyaki chicken at Japanese restaurants and sushi bars, I started craving teriyaki as SOON as I landed in the Bay Area the day after I had lunch at Morimoto NY. It was *that* good.

As a special date, my boyfriend made reservations to Morimoto and I was completely amazed by the decor of the restaurant. The ambiance is very intimate and the layout is very refreshing for the eyes. I would even tell you to check out their bathrooms! They have ?Japanese self cleaning toilets! When we were seated, we had really bad seats. It was to the left of the entrance and it felt really cramped. We decided to ask the waiter to check to see if there was a seat by the chef's bar. They immediately went to check for us and were happy to let us know that there were seats available! Always ask for the chef's bar because the tables are bigger for two person dining! Everything on the menu looked great so we decided on the Morimoto Omakase and had the tasting menu of 7 entrees. EVER-Y-THING. WAS. DELICIOUS. The waiters are super accommodating and the view at the chef's bar was entertaining. I definitely recommend: -tuna tartare -surf n turf -vegetable fondu -mango pudding You definitely won't disappoint your date at Morimoto!

I came here for my birthday dinner. I made reservations for 10 people and surprisingly, they did not ask me for my credit card to hold the table. I ordered the Toro Tartare, which was so amazing. The tuna was super fresh and the different sauces to pair it with was just beyond description. I also ordered the Duck Duck Duck and was a big fan. I know this is a pretty pricey restaurant, but I thought it was definitely worth it.

This is a review for lunch only: I came for the prix fixe lunch ($25) which consisted of a bento box with a fruit panna cotta desert. The bento box had about 3 pieces of nigiri and 3 roll pieces, some tempura fried veggies, a small salad, and a few pieces of wagyu beef. It wasn't a ton of food, so we ordered some additional rolls, which were surprisingly affordable at ~$8 each. I would've probably been happier just ordering rolls in place of the bento. Of course, the sushi was awesome, but nothing out of the ordinary. The panna cotta was very good as well! Overall, the meal wasn't mindblowing, but I'd imagine they save that stuff for dinner.

Here's an example why Yelp should offer 1/2 stars only because throwing around 5 stars devalues so called perfection. ?Unless you have tried every restaurant in the world, there's always potentially one better out there. ?With that in mind, Mori Mori moto was a solid 4.5. ?The decor and ambiance was great; a little getting used to @ first because the center section is very divided. ?Anyways, let's get to the food. ?We started w. the chef's 2nd tier sashimi combo. ?Oh my! ?Some of the freshest I've had. ?I'm still a relative newbie to sushi/sashimi so if you've had "much" better, I do apologize. ?We then followed w. the below appetizers in descending order from Fave to least: Spicy King crab: Tobanjan aioli, micro cilantro Toro tartare: Oestra caviar, sour cream, wasabi, dashi soy Oyster foie gras: Market oysters, foie gras, uni, teriyaki sauce Kakuni: Ten-hour pork, congee, and soy-scallion jus Crispy rock shrimp tempura: Spicy "kochujan" sauce, wasabi aioli Lamb carpaccio: Shiso buds w. scallion ginger dressing Don't get me wrong, everything was really good but the Spicy King crab is a must have. ?Btw. the micro cilantro makes this dish as it gives it the earthy/freshness that livens the spice. ?The toro tartare was very, very good however it was more of an A+ for presentation. ?The only issue I had w. this dish was the lack of caviar (charge more, I don't care) because it was not proportional to the amount of toro. ?Fine, if you don't want to charge $50 for this app then reduce the portion of toro. The taste of the oyster foie gras was outstanding albeit some citrus was needed to completely finish off this dish. ?The only issue I had w. this was texture. ?Oysters are soft and mushy, foie gras is soft and mushy, and uni is soft and mushy. ?Do you see the issue? Ordering the Kakuni seemed a bit weird but I wanted to see his rendition of a chinese classic. ?Wishing there was more congee because the pork was a tad sweet, this dish was nicely put together. ?Tender, Tender pork and a crispy frisee of something was really delicious. ? The crispy rock shrimp tempura was a bit confusing. ?Lightly fried, although a few pieces I had were still a bit flourish, in two different types of aioli's paired w. ranch dressing on the side. ?One, I was not sure why ranch could be used for either one and two, why it was presented in two type of aioli's w. very similar characteristics. ?Good app, but someone needs to the explain to me the thought process behind it. ?Finally, the lamb carpaccio was my least favorite. ?Flavor was great but the raw texture of lamb was too tough....it doesn't matter how thin you slice or pound it. ? For entrees, we shared the below, again in descending order: Whole roasted Lobster "epice:" garam masala w. lemon creme fraiche 20 oz australian wagyu rib eye: served w. sweet onion and garlic jus Surf & Turf: wagyu filet w. hamachi ribbons toosed w. citrus and avocado I think the Surf & Turf was the least successful because the pairing didn't make sense to me. ?Whether in flavor or texture, it did not complement that well unless the freshness and citrusness from the "ceviched" hamachi was to counteract the richness of the filet. ?I don't know.....The 20 oz. Australian wagyu was cooked beautifully as I requested it between rare and medium rare. ?They sliced and served it rare on a ?sizzling plate and soon after it reached to the desired temperature I wanted. ?The rest of my party thought it was underseasoned but I thought it was perfect because I enjoy the natural flavors of beef. ?Last but not least, the whole roasted Lobster. ?This is a MUST HAVE. ?Beautifully cooked lobster roasted in a garam masala rub (did wish it was a bit spicier) but what tied it together was the "lemon creme fraiche." ?I told the waitress that I could put that creme fraiche on my shoe and eat it. ?It was sweet, a little bit of tang, light and airy....perfect complement to the perfect lobster. ?However, if you are a true foodie, pairing w. the meat was not even the best. ?I asked her for a teaspoon so I could scoop out the yummy particles of lobster brain as it was decadent, creamy and amazing w. the creme fraiche. For desserts, we share the below, again in descending order: Chilled cheesecake souffle: ?strawberry red-wine sorbet, green tea lemon powder Warm flourless chocolate cake: caramel popcorn and rice crispies, sesame caramel sauce Apple bread pudding: green tea crumble, brown butter ice cream. All were so good but I like the lightness and refreshing flavors of the cheesecake souffle thanks to the strawberry red wine sorbet and dabs of some citrus gelee on the plate. ?The other two were not as memorable, not in a bad way. ? What I love most about this place is that I actually want to try everything on the menu. ?Most places I go, I order everything that interests me and usually it's 4-5 items. ?But this time, we ordered so much and there's still at least 1/2 of the menu I still want to try. ?Need to go back NOW

This is one of the best meals that I have ever had. The tasting menu with the sake pairings is definitely the way to go. It allows you to fully experience the mastery of Morimoto. My favorite was the sushi dish, and the needle fish in particular. In addition to the food and ambiance, the toilets can't be beat. I know it sounds strange, but I think it highlights the fact that this place is superior top to bottom.

All in all, you feel like you walked into a lavish kitchen. ?The bathrooms are definitely a must see (even if you don't have to go). Food: Wonderful, but a bit pricey for the amount that you receive. I recommend the Braised Black Cod bento box and the cripsy rock shrimp tempura as an appetizer (definitely more generous portions for appetizers). Bon Apetit!

Always happy with this spot. Good food, good ambience. Sometimes these celeb chef places can be cheesy but this is a really well put together spot. I have been here about 3 times in 2012 Q4. Lobster rolls area must, so is the martini with elder flower. On my last visit we had the tofu which was made and steamed right in front of us, it was made, poured, and let to sit at our table, whereas 30 minutes later (while we were eating other items) the server came to open it , slice it and serve it to us, and also serve the appropriate dressings on it. The service is hit and miss, sometimes when busy, the servers are not attentive and forgetful but when the service is good - it is really good. Overall - decor is beautiful, good to people watch. Not pretentious. Good food. I would always come back here 80% of the coming back would be for the food. Walking distance from some hot spots to party in meatpacking district...also a plus. NOTE: ?Yes, the bathrooms are MAGNIFICENTLY COOL.

Trendy as hell. Expensive as hell. Beautiful interior design. Good looking people all around. The food is still the best part. Indulge in Morimoto, then get chicken & rice for the next couple days. One of the best sashimi I've tasted. Highlight: Omakase (menu tasting for $120+ per person) Course No.1: Toro tartare. Not your typical fat slab of tuna or what you'd imagine "fatty" tuna to look like. But this thin sheet of toro is impressive. The creativity and unique combination of sauces are intriguing. Course No. 2: Sashimi. ? Course #3: Salad with Hot Anchovies Sauce. Nice idea. Fishy. Course #4: Uni + Kumamoto Oyster. Perfect. ? Course #5: Sashimi. Course #6: Wangyu beef + crab + lobster. I wish I had a bowl of rice to chomp this course down with. The spices and powerful taste on this course made the Omakase very memorable. Course #7: Dessert. Is this place a dessert specialist house? * I wouldn't order the ramen. Sure its hand-made noodles and the soup is epic. But its the size of a cup of noodle and there is so much good ramen in NY and LA that you don't need to come here to mess around with stuff like that.

My wife and I went to Morimoto way back in October but I still remember that meal to this day. It was absolutely incredible. We tried the Omakase menu and every dish was beautifully prepared and presented. Definitely a must try. If I had one negative thing to say, it is that the portions are on the small side especially considering the price but the quality of the food definitely makes up for that.

I wanted to give it 5 stars, but I couldn't. But come on...it's Morimoto (I'm talking about the man, not the restaurant!). So, it's restaurant week though really they were just offering their $25 prix-fixe bento box menu. There's 5 bento boxes to choose from and they all come with miso soup, salad, tempura, 3 pieces of spicy tuna roll and 3 pieces of nigri and the "entree". It was a great bento box and left me satisfied. I go the waygu beef, I didn't really know how to pass it up. All in all it was good, except for it was room temp-cold-ish and it ran on the salty side with no rice to balance out the salt. The miso soup had fresh tofu, which was awesome. The salad had the best dressing every and wasn't heavily dressed. The vegetable tempura had 4 pieces of deliciousness with an awesome sauce at the bottom. The waygu beef I already mentioned. The spicy tuna was good, lots of tuna. The nigri was awesome. This all came with dessert, which was strawberry panna cotta (awesome!). I'd say for the experience I didn't mind the $25 price tag. I sat at the sushi bar, but overall the space had a nice feel and atmosphere. The service was great. Not a place I would just come to, but a place I would take people to.

We came here on NYE 2013 for dinner. ?Our table wasn't ready yet so we were ushered downstairs to have a cocktail and were escorted up maybe 25 minutes after our reservation time to be seated. ?The decor is very chic and modern..I loved the displays in the bathroom and the igloo setup at the bar. ?It was easy to have our bar tab put on our dinner bill, which was great. What we got: 4 Stars - 2 cocktails - ?ume martini and cinnamon apple whiskey, both were pretty good 2 Stars - Junmai Sake - we weren't trying to spend big bucks on dinner drinks since we were planning to drink the rest of the night up until NYE, so we chose the low grade sake. ?Big mistake. For $22 you'd expect at least a decent tasting sake, but this one was harsh and difficult to drink. 4 Stars - Toro Tartare - I love interactive food. ?It doesn't disappoint in terms of flavor palettes, the choice between the many sauces including wasabi, seaweed paste, rice cracker, dashi-soy, sour cream, etc.. ?lends way to a really fun and interesting starter. ?It's much smaller in person than it looks in the pictures, but I'm not surprised since it IS toro and there's also caviar on it. ?I could've eaten that all day. 4 Stars - Foie Gras Oysters - Oh my my my. ?This was my favorite dish by far. ?The explosion of flavor isn't comparable. ?My 3 favorite things in one bite, what more could I ask for? ?The only negative was that there was too my teri sauce.. I would've preferred something less sweet. ?Flipside, I loved the berry palette cleanser, which was sweet and refreshing. 3 Stars - Chef's Selection Sushi - Nothing too special, just assorted nigiri of chef's selection fish. 3 Stars - Chef's Selection Sashimi - Again, nothing too noteworthy except for the maguro, which in my opinion was the best I've ever had. ?Normally maguro (tuna) is pretty tasteless but in this case, it was surprisingly very flavorful. 4 Stars - Flourless Chocolate Cake - Very unique dessert. ?It was a lava type choco cake accompanied by a pear sorbet and caramel popcorn, grapes, pomegranate, flowers, and other fruits. ?It looked like an array of opposing flavors but once I tried it, it went very well together. 5 Stars Service - Service was impeccable. ?I would have preferred a more private table since we were seated within touching distance of the parties next to us, but otherwise, our server and the bussers were great. Probably won't be back since there were so many other great places to try in NYC, but I would say my overall experience was a good one.

Came here dinner for 2. ?I loved the decor of the restaurant as you walk in. ?The bathroom was really interesting as well. ?It gives you the illusion that it's a long lit hallway. ?The toilets are quite fancy too, I didn't play with all the buttons. ? Anyways, onto the food. Appetizer: Oyster foie gras ?- loved it. ?The duck was the only part that was cooked, rest of the dish was raw but it felt like all the ingredients were cooked. ?It comes on a hot plate. ?Don't eat the white squares at the bottom of the plate, it's SALT!! only for decoration =P ?Oyster and uni helped cut the foie gras and the teriyaki sauce gave the dish more sweetness. ?Usually the uni is sweet but not sweet enough for this dish. ? ?I would definitely recommend this dish. ?I didn't taste any graininess or dirt in the uni or oyster. Main course: Seafood 'toban yaki' and Surf (yellowtail) & Turf (wagyu filet) ?- I enjoyed the Surf & Turf. ?Definitely better than the toban yaki in my opinion. ?One huge plus is that you can eat the meat and fish together in one bite. ?Of course you'll have to cut it into smaller pieces yourself, but the flavors complement each other. ?In my opinion, I thought the meat was too salty, but if you eat it with the fish, it balances it out and adds seasoning to the fish. ?The herbed potatoes was awesome. ?They were so small and cute. ?Also had a little sweetness to the sauce and I couldn't get enough of it. ?Overall, definitely a filling dish. ?- As for the toban yaki, all the seafood ingredients were fresh ?but if you've never had excellent seafood ingredients, you wouldn't be able to tell because of the way the dish was prepared. ?I asked the waitress how the lobster was prepared, she said it was steamed. ?I have a feeling it was steamed and then something else was done to it because when you taste the lobster, it's very soft, not crunchy. ?I've steamed lobster at home before and the meat doesn't turn out the way this restaurant made it. ?The sauce is excellent, gives you a balance of aroma and taste of the sea. ?The dish is not salty at all. ?Not a single piece of sand or graininess. ?Another thing to mention is that I felt the ingredients were overcooked probably because it was sitting in the soup bath. ?They probably messed up the timing. ? Sashimi: oh-toro = fatty tuna ?- it was really good but I definitely preferred the salmon. ? ?- not much of a tuna taste, which I think is what it's supposed to be and the fattiness gave it a more marbled texture. salmon ?- best piece of salmon I've ever had in NYC so far. ?I could taste the layer of meat, fat, meat, fat, etc. ?I mean, it was an excellent balance and it couldn't be more fresh. ?Superb way of letting the ingredient speak for itself. ?Just eat it raw! wagyu beef ?- don't waste your money on it. ?I have a feeling they blowtorched the meat a little bit before giving it to you. ?I was hoping for more black and blue. ?Disappointed in the dish. ?It was definitely marbly tender piece of meat but it wasn't impressive. This place has the freshest ingredients in my opinion. ? Staff was very attentive to our water level. I wish the booths for 2 people had more space in between them. ?When you squeeze in and out, your butt is practically in the other persons' face! I don't usually give restaurants 5 stars but I am giving it to this place mainly for their salmon sashimi ?but also for their Surf & Turf (to be able to eat both in one bite and have it complement each other). ?Until I find better salmon, this will remain at 5 stars.

Preface/Bathrooms ================ Been saving this one for my 300th review. ?The same way I was saving the contents of my bladder all the way from Jersey to use the crazy innovative bathrooms at this place. ?This is the insane genius of Morimoto. He doesn't stop at the food level. This Iron Chef gets down to the plumbing level. We are talking about toilets with embedded bidets that will leave your entire backside clean, massaged, and wanting more. This is what makes Morimoto an Iron Chef. ?Your mouth and taint will thank you. Incredible... ? Food/Drinks ========== Took us a minute to get our table, so we had a chance to explore the downstairs bar and drink menu. The Lotus Blossom came highly recommended, made with gin (Bombay), a Japanese citrus liquor called Yuzu (rumor has it this is very hard to find outside of Morimoto's restaurants), and a Japanese soft drink called Calpico. I could down these one after another. Not sure if I'd make it up the stairs back to my table though. Appetizers --------------- Once I did make it to my table, I was ready to attack the appetizers. Morimoto Sashimi is a 5x5 - 5 sashimi squares stacked on top of each other, with 5 sauces in tiny squeeze bottles for ultra precision - seared toro, salmon, eel, tuna, and hamachi. Melts in your mouth and the combination so carefully thought out that you should be able to distinguish each layer in the small sashimi square. The steamed scallop is marinated in XO sauce. ?Dry scallop sauce on freshly steamed scallops - doesn't take a celebrity judge on Iron Chef to recognize the thought behind this artistic pairing. ?This with the sashimi definitely set a level of expectation for the rest of the meal on which the Morimoto's kitchen delivered. Entrees ----------- The sea bass - marinated with sweet sake, served with Japanese eggplant, and miso. ?Full of flavor and super tender, this sea bass was incredible, just falling off the fork. Nothing more to be said about a beautifully prepared fish like this. Duck, duck, duck - get the f$*k out of here with that evil genius dude. ?Duck 3 ways - 1) foie gras croissant (suck it California) - good foie gras is good foie gras. Period. 2) roast duck - skin is as good as the meat - crispy goodness. meat is the perfect combination of tender, fat, and chewy. 3) soft duck egg - ok I'll go with it. ?I appreciate the art form. Dessert ----------- I see the words Warm Chocolate Cake and my stomach automagically makes extra room. Can't explain it. Put Morimoto's Iron Chef spin on it and you get it with Japanese dark sugar syrup, rhubarb sauce, a side of ice cream, and some sweet caramel popcorn. ?After this dessert, you will want to put on some sneakers and check out the running track along the West Side Highway. Although I didn't meet Morimoto during my visit, this menu iron chef'd the crap out of me. Everyone should experience this place at least once in their life. Also - toilets from the future.

Why am I not impressed? Every time I go here (b/c some out of town friend drags me) I really feel like I should have an out of body experience, but it is always just average and I stay very firmly planted in my body. The ambiance was nice, good looking people, average service but nothing amazing. I know many hole in the walls in the West Village with comprable food and even better service. Maybe next time around they will wow me...

*GASP* how did I forget to write a review for Morimoto?! My friend and I came here during restaurant week last summer. We both got the black cod bento box, which came with: salad, tempura, miso soup, black cod, sushi and sashimi, and cocounut and green tea panna cotta. The presentation for all the dishes was excellent, and of course, everything tasted as good as it looked. The sauce that came with the tempura was simply outstanding. I vaguely remember it having a hint of cream cheese or sour cream. I couldn't quite put my finger on what it was, but my taste buds were loving it. The black cod-OH MY GOD. The flavors were just amazing. It definitely was the star of the meal. The sauce had a sweet kick to it, but not overly sweet. The texture was perfection. My favorite part was definitely the panna cotta. Coconut and green tea - these flavors work so wonderfully well together. Light, sweet, creamy, and delicious; it was the perfect way to end the meal. I would go back just to have that panna cotta. The service was outstanding. Oh, and make sure you check out the bathroom; it's definitely worth a visit!

Definitely a must-try! Really liked all of our dishes. We got several sushi rolls to start off with and for our entrees, we got the Duck, Duck, Duck and the Sea bass. Loved the Duck, Duck, Duck and definitely one of the singular, most memorable dishes I have had. I have never had duck egg done like that before and it was so delicious.

For my last review in 2012 I decided to write about a one of the best meals that I have ever had in both New York as well as in my entire life. Came here on Christmas eve and I was pretty surprised the restaurant wasn't packed. The restaurant looks pretty swanky inside but the table we had was in a side room and some of the tables were very close together. Decided to get the omakase (DUH). It was $120 a person but very worth it. Course #1: Their infamous toro tartare. The toro was so fresh and I love how it was presented in a little bamboo plate with a variety of accompaniments ranging from guacamole to freshly grated wasabi and seaweed. Course #2: Sashimi of yellowtail. Very fresh fish as usual and came drizzled with a ponzu/soy sauce. Course #3: Very interesting fondue type with anchoives in hot oil dipping sauce. This was probably my least favorite course. They gave very strange things to dip in the hot oil like a tomato or green onion Course #4: Kumamoto oysters steamed with foie gras, uni (sea urchin), and teriyaki glaze. Normally i'm not a fan of oysters and uni but none of it had any fishy taste. Course #5: sashimi platter of 5 different types of fishes. Course #6: Lobster and Wagyu beef- one of my favorite courses. The lobster was cooked perfectly with a garlic asian taste and the wagyu beef was tender Course #7: Dessert: fig chocolate cake dessert. The chocolate cake was moist and wasn't overly sweet. It taste like those asian chocolate cakes you get. Came with a green tea ice cream Overall service was good. Drinks were always refilled and the food came out in a timely manner. They even have a japanese toilet downstairs. The only thing I wish that was different was that Mr. Morimoto would have been there but then again I wouldn't expect him to work on Christmas eve Come back again? For sure!

One of the biggest disappointments in New York. Be diligent with Soto or Yasuda reservations. The miso soup was a standout and would come back on a cold day to try their ramen. The Waygu Beef was dry. The unagi tasted old.The maguro was just fair. The tobiko and tako were just okay. The real standout were the sake, Nigori sake and the tomago. But it was all ruined by the cleanliness and hygiene etiquette. The head sushi chef kneeled down to the coolers blew into a napkin something fierce and drank some soup. Although he was wearing plastic gloves he didn't bother to wash his hands in case some snot or mucus went on them. He proceeded to touch fish and prep. Gross, lost our appetite and didn't order anymore. So if you were at Morimotos ?after about 1:20pm ?on 2/8/13, I hope you didn't get sick.

If 1,300+ rave reviews are not enough to help make up your mind, here comes another. I rarely say a restaurant is perfect in every aspect, but Morimoto proves itself worthy and then some. First thing i must admit is that i am pretty cautious with my money. I wouldn't say cheap, but when we decided we were going to Morimoto and i saw all the Yelp reviews relating to money, my heart might have skipped a few beats. Yes i was scared to spend half of my biweekly paycheck on dinner but i toughened up and we made the trip. My wife, brother in law and sister in law passed through the automatic sliding doors into the coolest place I've been to in a long time. We were 30 minutes early so our coats were checked and we were directed downstairs to the lounge. Empty liquor bottles lined the walls for some real creative decor and the blue lights made you feel like you were in a futuristic club out in space!. We had a couple of cocktails and were escorted to our table. Comfy padded chairs greeted us along with Carlo, who is one of the managers. He introduced himself, thanked us for coming and offered his services for anything we may need during our meal. He then introduced us to Freddy, who would be our waiter for the evening. Freddy told us about some specials and took our drink order, so here's the fun part: We decided to go with a variety of appetizers instead of the very popular tasting menu because my wife and sister in law are inexperienced with sushi. We really went all out with our order and I'm glad we did! We started with the toro tar tar, one spicy tuna roll, rock tempura shrimp with ranch dressing on the side, beef carpaccio and the best app if all, spicy king crab! I don't even know where to begin with these apps, everything was simply perfect! The girls loved the crab the most and my brother in law and I devoured the toro tar tar. Again, all i can say is that every app was made to the highest quality and our pallets were more than pleased! Both Carlo and Freddy were coming back and forth to check up on us, Carlo was answering questions we had about Morimoto that I'm sure he is asked 50 times a day, while Freddy was telling us a little about the spices used in the dishes (especially the spicy king crab), along with some of the stories he has while traveling through Singapore and China. Needless to say we were being treated real well and also getting a first class experience in fine dining. So next we went to the entrees: My brother in law and I went with the line-caught Halibut while the women went with the 'Angry Chicken.' The Halibut, once again, was the best I've ever tasted. It was as fresh as it could possibly be with a black bean glaze on top and it was all sitting in a fine miso broth with a tang that completed the dish to perfection. For dessert, we went all out again! We had a variety of sweets, including monkey bread accompanied by banana chocolate chip ice cream, chocolate cake filled with cream and topped with fruit and popcorn, cheesecake topped with raspberry sorbet along with yogurt and donuts. Once again, WOW! The clear highlight was the monkey bread, which had a syrupy glaze on the outside and an amazing warm yellow cream inside with mini sliced bananas on top! All the food went down with sweet White Lily and Hydrangea cocktails, which complimented the food perfectly. I guess you can say we went with the meal for beginners, we sampled a bunch of the menu but did not delve too deep into the sushi portion. After all was said and done, our combined bill for 4 was a touch over $320 before tip, which wasn't bad at all considering what i was fearing and the fact that we were chowing down at one of the best restaurants in Manhattan! The staff at Morimoto is simply top notch! Carlo the manager paid attention to every detail and made our experience seamless. Freddy the waiter and Cofield the bus boy were quick, kind and intelligent, you really can't ask for anything more. This was only the second time in my life that i had a perfect fine dining experience, with not one bad thing to report. If you are worried about spending too much money, just go in with the mindset that you are about to treat yourself to something better than you can ever imagine. Highest recommendation i could possibly give for a restaurant.

Only reason we came here was because we got a $100 gift card for Christmas. Don't get me wrong - the food + service was incredibly good. But for the price, oh the PRICE, I had to take off one star. Sure, there may be even more expensive restaurants in the city, but there are a LOT more restaurants with excellent food and good value. Morimoto is one of those places you save for special occasions. Food is great, no doubt about that. Service was also really excellent. Our server was lovely, knowledgeable about food & alcohol, had great tips, and made a genuine effort to make our experience as good as possible. While the main entrees are good, I believe the appetizers and "side" orders are what shines. Order the small plates, please, but not sushi per se, unless you really want it. Drinks were also excellent - as recommended by our lovely server! Just ask them what the most popular drinks are, or what their favourite drinks are. Can't go wrong with their personal recommendations.

Tried the Morimoto location in Napa and was very happy with my experience, so I came here with the expectation of having another delicious meal. By no means was this Morimoto bad, but for the high prices here I expected more. Food: Fresh ingredients and dishes are presented nicely in general. Omakase is available, although we opted for the regular menu this time. Highlights included the Morimoto sashimi, and the ishi yuri buri bop which is prepared tableside in a hot stone bowl. All the dishes we ordered were certainly good, The desserts also failed to meet my expectations; the menu had a high proportion of Western desserts. Our waiter informed us of a "monkey bread" dessert special which I opted for; it ended up being overly sweet and way too large for a dessert portion. Service: For a restaurant of this caliber, I felt that Morimoto fell short. Service just wasn't attentive enough, and on several occasions we had to ask for refills of water/tea, or for finished plates to be cleared. Our waiter also felt it necessary to continually come to our table to ask how everything was after each dish was presented - not a huge deal, but by the time we had finished with appetizers and gotten to the main dishes, it seemed a bit overbearing. The sushi bar left out a bit of our sashimi order, but when we pointed out the error to our waiter they promptly brought out what was missing. Setting/ambience: The restaurant is decorated in a trendy and somewhat minimalistic way; dim colored lighting, a folded-cloth-style ceiling, and Japanese toilets all make for a cool vibe. Unfortunately, the section we were seated in was fairly cramped, understandably so since it was a Saturday night. Overall, although I enjoyed the food, the subpar service and lack of anything truly memorable means I most likely will not be returning here. For the prices charged, I would have to say that the Napa location was far superior in terms of both food and service.

Took my hubby here for his most recent birthday. I really wanted to love it but $500 later it was simply okay, not spectacular. I don't mind spending that kind of money on a great dining experience but Morimoto fell short in my eyes. The service was okay at best. We got placed at a table away from the main dining area near the kitchen and bathrooms - not exactly ideal. Our server was friendly enough but overly casual and not super attentive (waited too long for more drinks or to have our plates cleared, etc...). We both got the omakase (chef's choice - I believe it was $125/pp) and there were some big hits and definite misses: Really good: Toto Tartare: This was by far my favorite course. Really delicious toro along w/ 5 different accompaniments (wasabi, caviar, etc...) . We found ourselves craving it for days after. Sashimi course - I believe it was yellow tail with a ponzu/soy sauce. Could have eaten a few more plates of that. The dessert - Mango pudding w/ passion fruit sorbet and yogurt power. Nice light and inventive way to end the meal. Sushi course: 5 different types of fish - all very fresh. Meh: The anchovies fondue - ? fondue was very, very salty. It came with an assortment of things to dip into it (soshito pepper, raw red pepper, cauliflower, mortadella, etc...). It was a fun idea but the saltiness of the fondue almost killed it for me. Kumamoto oyster with foie gras, uni and terriyaki sauce - I LOVE oysters, foie gras and uni. I was super excited when this came out. The terriyaki sauce was just way too overpowering. Maybe less sauce or a different sauce and I would have loved it. As it was, it was alright but a major letdown. Waygu beef & lobster: Meh. Meat was just okay - I was very underwhelmed, my lobster was undercooked and I wasn't a fan of the spices used. Would I go back? Probably not. There are way too many other Japanese restaurants in NYC to try.

This was the second time I've dined at morimoto with my boyfriend, and they are fortunate their food is good enough to wait 25 minutes after our reservation. We were sent down to their "lounge" area to wait "momentarily". Almost a half hour later they finally brought us up to our table. Now, I understand that most of their clientele are probably tourists or people just curious because Morimoto is associated with Iron Chef and Nobu, but I kind of felt like our server (despite being very nice!) was trying to over sell us. The food is worth all this. I had the Aji sashimi- amazing light mackerel flavor, expertly sliced, and I love that they have REAL wasabi, whose light peppery floral notes I look forward to. With the sashimi I also had the salmon skin roll with kaiware (daikon sprouts). As a sushi chef, this was hands down THE BEST I HAVE EVER HAD. The combination of the subtly flavored aji with the smokey crunchy bold flavor of the roll was perfect. For entrees my boyfriend got the angry chicken, and I had the toban yaki, which is basically a seafood hot pot with the most velvety delicious broth (lobster clam mussel ginger? I desperately tried to figure it out). We split a side of rice to pad out our dinners at the suggestion of our server, which was a wise choice. I am madly in love with Morimoto's Junmai sake. I will not share my carafe! So if you decide to go, get reservations, order with reckless abandon, but expect the bill to reflect that. ittadakimasu!

Morimoto... he is an Iron chef for a reason... I went with family and did the Omaskase - the 8 tasting course- the best chefs dishes of the day. We went through every course, each one beautifully crafted and aesthetically pleasing. Out of the 8 dishes these were my favorite: 1) The famous "tuna tar tar" - you have fresh tuna on the plate, with an array of 6 dipping sauces that perfectly compliment the tuna. ( I can eat this forever) 2) The kobe beef pairing with the Lobster- ?I don't think I need to specify how great this is. and the best part of the restaurant, as one yelper stated: is the bathroom! Out of all the restaurants that I have been to, I have never seen such a cool bathroom: there are glass surroundings with japanese style toilets.

Being the foodie that I am and a huge Food Network and Cooking Channel, I put it on my radar to stop at Morimoto. I'm also a Japan lover so that made it even more important! FOOD/DRINKS - 5 Stars: Here's a run down of what we ordered: Appetizers: - Eel and avocado roll (http://www.yelp.com/biz_…) - Crispy Rock Shrimp Tempura (http://www.yelp.com/biz_…) Entrees: - Seafood Toban Yaki (http://www.yelp.com/biz_…) which had king crab, scallops, shrimp, and lobster. - Surf and Turf with yellowtail sashimi, wagyu, and potatoes (http://www.yelp.com/biz_…) Drinks (http://www.yelp.com/biz_…): - White Lily, this was my favorite drink with yuzu and Calpis! If you're a fan of Calpis, this is definitely worth a try... I ordered two of these! - Hydrangea, which is lychee based. This was so much food, but oh so good. The rock shrimp tempura was an amazing way to start the meal. The eel and avocado roll was absolutely fresh. The surf and turf was a good way to get your meat fix as well as some seafood. The sashimi was mixed with avocado. It was my first time eating it this way, but it was absolutely amazing. The Toban Yaki was so good that all that was left was shell. All the broth and every piece of meat was gone! I don't think anything else needs to be said of how good it was. Unfortunately, we were so stuffed we had to skip out on dessert. =/ ATMOSPHERE - 5 Stars: This place is very Hollywood/NYC trendy. That might turn people off, but the setting is truly awesome in here. And even down to the restrooms. I literally had to stare at the stall because of the weird illusion... Ok... I know I'm writing about a stall, but you have to see it for yourself. Hahaha. The ambience was nice and it was very loungy and relaxing. We really enjoyed it. SERVICE - 5 Stars: The service here was impeccable. It was perfect from start to finish. Our server was awesome and did a great job. The evening was seamless and the meal had a nice flow. RECOMMENDATION: I recommend this restaurant to EVERYONE. Morimoto has done a great job with this place... from the food... to the decor... to just everything. I'll be back again at Morimoto's soon enough!

Alright here's your step by step if you are considering going to Morimoto's. 1) Stop considering and just go. 2) Call the restaurant and make a reservation. 3) Find your way to 10th Ave. Yes even if this means taking a flight to land at JFK/LGA/EWR and COME ON AN EMPTY STOMACH 4) Walk right through the massive curtain which covers the door ? 5) Announce you are here ready to have an awesome meal. 6) Order the Omakase (why would you go for standard rolls when you can go for an Iron Chef's own omakase 7) Get ready to be blown away with each bite of every dish. Kidding aside, the omakase is seriously bomb. This is awesome food with amazing presentation, plating, and creativity. My favorite from the omakase was the toro tartare as there were a few different pastes to eat with the tartare. The foie gras oyster was amazing. I really don't know how to explain the flavors I consumed. Seriously one of the best omakase experiences I have had. Yes it will cost you a bit but Iron Chef Morimoto's omakase is something you must experience. I have also had their lunch specials and other food items and everything has been solid but you just have to experience the omakase. Nothing like it. Oh the restaurant is very trendy looking also so a nice date night. Honestly the tasting menu is the epitome of amazing food with perfect presentation and creativity of combining flavors. What are you waiting for? Get over here and experience Morimoto.

Came here for a birthday dinner with the boyfriend. The decor was very nice but I would recommend asking to be seated near the open kitchen. We were seated in a small side room that lacked any ambience. What made up for that was the spot on service and delicious food. For appetizers we shared the toro tartare, rock shrimp tempura and spicy king crab. All were very good but the spicy king crab was the winner. My mouth is watering just thinking about it! The boyfriend got the Angry Chicken for his entree. The serving size was huge, even better, the white meant was moist and flavorful. I ordered the braised black cod. It was perfectly cooked and yummy flaky goodness. We also shared the soft shell crab roll, but don't expect it to be like the spider roll you get from normal restaurants. Down side, it fell apart very easily. We were so stuffed but being fatties, ordered dessert anyway. The sorbet comes with 3 flavors: raspberry wasabi (wasabi very noticeable), Fiji apple (favorite) and mandarin persimmon. PS: definitely recommend the blue bell cocktail!

Fancy New York City Dining. The hostesses welcoming you are the only negative experience you will have at Morimoto. They are either incredibility stuck up, or incredibly aloof. Either way, they do a disservice to their coworkers. The bartenders are friendly, the bus stuff is as well, and our waiter was almost as excited about our visit as we were. Our waiter actually made everything feel a lot less stuffy. He took his time recommending dishes for us and kept checking up on us genuinely caring if we were enjoying everything. My experience at other fancy-shamcy places like this have been that the servers assume everything is perfect, which as we all know isn't always the case. So the food was delicious, creative, but alas, not very memorable. Granted I was there a week ago and took my time to get around writing this review, but I expected myself to remember the flavors in a dish or two. I don't. But that doesn't mean it wasn't worth it. It just means it's delicious fancy food that's worth trying once, for the sake of trying it. The coolest part of it all though, I embarrassingly must admit, was the toilets. I will not explain any further, you'll all just have to go to see what I'm talking about.

So overhyped and overpriced. ?While the shrimp tempera was fab, the other appetizers we ordered for the table (oysters, tofu, gyoza) had no different quality and taste than a trip to Chinatown, just different plating and a few rice puffs thrown in to mix it up. ?The halibut was overseasoned. The waitstaff was dyslexic, mixing our order, and could not be flagged down to get items for the table. The bathroom is cool, but the iron chef could have done better.

Delicious but a little overrated. The interior is stuffy and all white like an ice palace. The food is nicely presented but on the scarce side. You can definitely get better sushi/seafood for your money in the city. Have to Get: Rock Shrimp, Toro Tartare, Morimoto Sashimi Downside: On the pricey end for something great but not fantastic

Tasting menu (Omakase) though quite a hefty penny is one of the best ways to go here. ?There was 7 courses total including a dessert and I loved 6 out the 7 which included the tuna tartar, yellowtail sashimi, oyster with foi gras and uni (OMG DELICOUS), the 5 piece tuna plate, wagyu beef/lobster and the mango/passion fruit sorbet with dried yogurt... literally every dish was delicious and i wish I had more servings of each. ?The one course that wasn't dying for, but still was good was this hot vegetable fondue sort of contraption. ?The sauce was good, but there were definitely better courses. The drinks and service was pretty spot on as well. ?I had this cranberry, sake, and elder flower concoction while a dining companion had straight sake that was really smooth and easy to drink. Love morimoto, obvi he's an iron chef right.

Horrendous service, unprecedentedly bad in my experiences dining at similarly upscale restaurants. Our main waiter made an extremely rude comment when we tried to ask him something as he was walking past us. Those who described the dishes didn't bother to articulate and just muttered something indistinguishable under their breath and scurried off. The food was not worth the price tag. Our underwhelming toro tartare was $30. The presentation is indeed unique but after that, there's pretty much nothing else to the dish. We also got the spicy king crab ... Worst decision ever. For $36, we got crab with spicy mayo... Fresh? Maybe a step above cafeteria boxed sushi. Thus, we spent over $60 on disappointing appetizers with the smallest portions (this is coming from someone who rarely clears her plates and is in no means saying quantity trumps quality... The quality here is just subpar.) Finally, the saving grace was the black cod which was soft and dressed in a delicious teriyaki sauce which was slightly too salty but the highlight of our lunch. Lastly, we had an incoherent apple bread dessert with ice cream on the side and a fun mousse and green tea crumbs. Decor was trendy and chic as expected but the bathrooms are nothing to wow about. Considering this was a highly anticipated restaurant for us, we could not leave more disappointed. However, Morimoto's fame will guarantee this restaurant many diners, but there are countless Japanese restaurants in New York City that serve the same, if not better quality food and definitely provide better service and lower prices.

Omasake (tasting menu): While we had a bumpy start with out pre-dinner cocktails (one of which had to be sent back because it was made incorrectly), we did the omasake and paired it with a daiginjo sake. Everything, especially the white miso and anchovy dipping course, was superlatively delicious. ?We added dumplings as an extra dish before the final (and mouth-wateringly amazing) "surf and turf" course, and were happily sated. In terms of cost relative to other tasting menus at top-tier restaurants in NYC, Morimoto is very reasonable and could charge more for what it offers. ?The food is very good, it's a good deal and the restaurant itself is a well-designed (if a little crowded and loud) space. ?4/5 stars

Believe the Hype! Stopped in on a Saturday night for Dinner. We walked in through the white curtains and found a large trendy space. We arrived about 15 min late to our reservations so we were punished and sent downstairs to the bar. :) We enjoyed a few of the potent cocktails while the knowledgable bartender educated us on the signature dishes to consider for dinner. For example, we never hear of the rare salmon (oh-torro?) and Japanese Beef that were delicasies. Sorry I dont remember the exact names. You can blame the cocktails for that. We started off with a few sushi rolls - spicy salmon and eel avocado roll. We followed that with the Crispy Shrimp Tempura. Our Entrees were the Duck Breast and the Austrailian Waygu Filet. Both were amazing. Last but not least, we enjoyed the Chocolate Cake with Caramel Popcorn and Coconut Sorbet. Ive been to a lot of GOOD restaurants across the country, but its safe to say that this is easily one of the BEST restaurants period. Service was stellar, food was out of this world. What was also cool was watching the Chefs prepare the meals via the open kitchen. Another entertaining feature is the sushi bar surrounding the kitchen. Patrons and waiters alike must remove their shoes as per tradition.

Pros: DELICIOUS food, wonderful ambiance, knowledgeable staff. Cons: long waits even with a birthday reservation for 3 (about an hour), some of the staff will look you up and down the entire time (not sure if it's admiration or judgment).

I was brought here for a special occasion and we both ordered the omakase. ? The location from the outside looked strange (curtains outside?) and the inside was (Japanese) simple, elegant, worn down a bit, and a bit pretentious. ? At first I thought the wait staff were going to be on the border of rude but i was pleasantly surprised that they all were polite and tried to make you understand what you were eating (some of them though were not easy to understand with their language difficulties) which is very important. ? Everything about the omakase was great. ?The quality was definitely there and the quantity was just enough to satisfy my taste buds. ?It kept you wanting more until the end when the main course (Wagyu beef and lobster with Japanese yams) came out. ?I was at the point that I might be getting too full but that's where it stopped and it nicely led to the dessert. ?The dessert (pannacotta) was also on that very same level of greatness but nothing overpowering - a very Japanese trait. ?Balance is key.

It is a easily over $150 dinner per person. The food is really amazing! They really put in effort to do every dish. Every single dish is amazing unlike some other restaurants, only the signature dish is good. I ordered the Omakase which is $125. It gave you a good variety of different dishes. It came with 5 to 6 dishes. It is pretty filling for me. It came with the toro tartare, artichoke fondue, sushi, entree and dessert. My friend ordered just the tuna pizza which was amazing too and the sea bass. The entrees were not expensive - around $30. However, the appetizer is a bit pricy - around $20-30. It really depends on what you want to eat. Everything is amazing - from raw food to cooked to dessert. However, one drawback was their cocktails - very limited selection. Overall, it is really good! I will go back for sure!

It was just fantastic. I took my family visiting from Japan there, and we all were very satisfied with everything. They really never experienced those Japanese fusion dishes and were very happy to get a chance to try. We all had omakase, which was a bit pricy ($130/person) but really worth it. Absolutely recommended.

Background: I took my girlfriend here for her birthday. Made reservations for 6:45PM on a saturday night. We were sat in the top right hand corner right next to the wall. Seating was a bit tight for a 6'0 guy like me. The interior was exquisite. Bathrooms were clean with interesting mirror decor. Service: Service was prompt and kind. However, there was an incident where a waiter presented me chicken ramen, which I did not order, and splashed a little bit of burning hot soup on my hand/clothes when trying to split the noodles for my table. Waiter must not have known of such incident, or if they did know, did not acknowledge it. Food: I ordered the rock shrimp tempura, oyster foie gras, yosetofu, and sushi combination. The rock shrimp tempura was quite tasty. The batter was light and delicate and the sauce on the wasabi aioli was delicious. The oyster foiegras was a very interesting combination. The oyster was a bit fishy for my taste though, but nonetheless delicious. The yosetofu was a very interesting concept, and the one thing I believe I enjoyed the most. Made tableside, the silken tofu was soft and gentle in flavor. Quite the delicacy. The sushi was quite a disappointment, however. The $45 sushi combination came with a tuna roll and 7-8 nigiri. The sushi rice on the roll seemed hard, old, and flavorless. The nigri was better, with one particular piece of fish tasting particularly more fishy than the rest (I don't remember which one it was). Personally, I prefer Washington D.C's Kaz Sushi Bistro. Drinks: Drinks were delicious. I ordered the Tokonatsu and White Lily. Both were extremely delicious. Overall: I would rate this a 3.8. I really wanted to say yes, but my palate said eh... I ?had really high hopes for this place given all its reviews.

My wife took me here for my birthday, and I'm so glad she did! At first, I thought this place was just gonna be a bunch of overpriced hype. While it was certainly overpriced, the experience was absolutely amazing. We each got the omakase, and just sat back as they set us on our food journey. We also got the sake pairing. Every single component of every dish was incredibly delicious and paired really well with every sake. I left the place with a really glazed look on my face. I was a very happy birthday boy. No words can do this place justice. You just have to try it for yourself!

Fantastic! i came here for dinner on a Tuesday night with my wife, my mother-in-law, and a visiting cousin from Korea. ?Had to make reservations even on a Tuesday. ?Ours was at 7:45 but the place really started filling up around 830. ?Now on to the review... Now for a place this expensive, i expect not only great food but also great service. ?Morimoto does not disappoint in either category. ?From the moment we walked in, to the entire dining experience, the service was very attentive. ?I was extremely pleased with the level of service and professionalism that the entire staff showed throughout the entire meal. The four of us had the prix fix meal. ?7 courses including the dessert of Morimotos finest. ?add a few drinks (just had some sapporo) and the meal was excellent. ?the sushi was very fresh and the right amount of zing from the wasabi, the lobster and steak were cooked to perfection, and the dessert (mango pudding) was delicious. ?The presentation of each dish was good and sometimes very clever. ? If you can afford it I would recommend getting the prix fix meal for $125 a person. ? To wrap this up, make sure you use the bathroom downstairs. ?pretty cool. ?Another plus was Morimoto was dining right behind us entertaining some guests. ?I know for sure their tab would have ran over a couple thousand with the amount of food and all the different types of wine they were bringing out. ?But hey, its his restauarant and he can do what he wants. ?I would really recommend this restuarant. ?its pricey yes but its worth it for a nice occasion. ?i saw a bar downstairs and it would be nice place to chill if you're ever in the chelsea market area.

You must know that if you go here with two people, you will spend about $350 - $400. ? This will get you the Omakase for both and enough good Sake for your entire experience. ?And "experience" is what it is. ?The presentation of each item is ridiculous. ?To get a salad where every veggie is the pick of the litter is special. ?It's like for every head of lettuce, Morimoto chooses only the best leaf of each head. ?Sure, I'll eat Toro Tartare by using a chisel on a hard plastic easel propped up by bamboo sticks. ?The flavors were delicious, the service - top shelf. ?For a special occasion with foodie friends it's worth the tab.

Restaurant is very modern inside. By the time we got seated, we were STARVING. -- Delicious cocktails -- AMAZING presentation -- Sushi (delicious) -- Yellowtail and toro tartare = awesome -- rock shrimp tempura (delicious) -- Spicy king crab (Z-OMG!) -- Angry chicken (my brother had to get it, quite good!) -- Black cod miso (sooooo good) -- Oysters -- Some rolls (forget which) -- I can't remember what else we ordered, but we ordered sooooo much. -- We ordered a fruit platter for dessert for the table (not on the menu) - they did an amazing job accommodating the special request and did it up with beautiful flowers and fruit arrangements. ?My mother was soooo pleased, so totally worth it. Would totally go again in a heart beat - maybe we a more adventurous dinner crowd (i.e. just family or our friends).

My boyfriend took me here for my birthday b/c I've always wanted to dine at all the Iron Chefs' restaurants. Just for the experience and hype haha. He made reservations for a Thursday night at 8pm I believe and we were seated right away. Its super dark in there so be careful people! We received our menus after maybe 5 mins or so. The waiter did explain to us about the omakase? Did I spell that correctly? It is a 7 course meal but all the portions were extremely tiny! My boyfriend was still extremely hungry after eating everything. Each meal came probably 20 mins after one another which was very unreasonable. Food was good but, the service and portions were lacking. I don't think I'll ever come back but if I do, never again will I order the omakase. Sorry waiter but... you were wrong. It was not an amazing experience. Check out the bathrooms while your at it. It's downstairs on the left. Pretty nice.

You can always count on great Japanese fusion at Morimoto, albeit at a steep price. ?I've been here a couple of times, and every time I go I always ordered the Wagyu Beef Carpaccio, which is a long strip of thinly sliced raw Wagyu beef topped with some veggie I can't identified, drizzled with sizzling hot sesame oil. The texture of the beef is so perfect, and the flavor is so amazing that I can't even describe it. Other then that, some other solid choice are: 1) Toro tartar 2) Oyster Foie Gras 3) Surf and Turf 4) Seafood Toban Yaki ( excellent choice ) Only thing I would steer clear of is the Smoked Salmon Ravioli, which was a waste of $16. ?And of course, since this is a fusion restaurant and not a sushi bar, I would recommend to save your money on the sushi and opt for the cold/hot dishes.

Came here for Restaurant Week with my husband and had chicken bento and the wagyu beef: - sushi - excellent, very fresh seafood, great flavours - miso soup - tofu was fresh and very silky, soup was slightly on the salty side - tempura - delicious! especially the sauce at the bottom (it was some sort of cheese/mayo sauce?) - salad - I think this was rocket with fried spring onions and a dressing which my husband liked but I found quite sharp - chicken katsu - again, delicious, the mayonnaise was especially great - grilled wagyu beef - this was only ok, in hindsight I would probably have ordered something else. ?It's served folded in half in a little bowl, so only the top side got the sauce, with the rest of the beef rather bland. - White Lily cocktail - a Calpico based cocktail, I loved it (but I am very much into sweet drinks) though my husband found the aftertaste a little too sour (no complaints here). ?Very refreshing. - Complimentary strawberry pannacotta - delicious! ?Very smooth, nice way to finish the meal Service was good. ?We went for a late lunch on a Thursday (2:15 PM) so the place was pretty empty, in hindsight we did not need reservations at all. May go again in future, but would focus on the sushi, sashimi and the seafood. ?Though with so many good restaurants in NYC, we'll probably try some other places before we visit again.

So honestly, probably more like 3.5 stars. ?I had huge expectations for this place and was very excited to finally try this place. ? Ambiance: 4. ?The restaurant itself is laid out and decorated beautifully. ?As soon as you walk in, you forget that 10th Avenue's shadiness is outside of those big red curtains. ? Service: 3.5. We had a great waiter who was very knowledgeable about the food and was super attentive to our table. ?The only nitpicky thing issue I had was at the end of the evening when we were given our bill, it felt like we were being rushed to provide our cards and so they could clear off the table. ?It was almost 11pm on a Tuesday night - I can't imagine that you had a party that needed our table of 4 to be emptied that quick that you needed to rush out people. Food: 3. The food was good. ?And if I were at any of the other restaurants in the city that aren't as 'acclaimed' as Morimoto, I would likely give the food a 3.5-4. ?However, with great name comes great expectation. ?And while everything we ordered was tasty, it seemed that we were more excited when we read about it on the menu. ? I'd come back here for the rock shrimp and the tuna pizza and the virgin drinks we had, but I don't foresee coming back here for dinner.

Overall, the experience was alright. ?There wasn't anything that really stood out or awed me to come back another time and the service was just okay. ?I had to make reservations several days prior since it was a busy restaurant which isn't a big deal. ?I didn't like the fact that it took nearly 30-40 minutes for our food to come out. ?I had the opportunity to try the roasted lobster, miso sea bass, and yellowtail in a stone bowl. ?Like I said before, the food was just okay.

Let's start off saying I'm very critical of this place, consider the price and the fame of Morimoto. Anyways, I loved Morimoto when he was on the original Japanese Iron Chef. He was my idol, and I always cheer him on during the battles. But man, this is the 2nd time he disappoints me. First time was at the Lucky Rice festival in NYC earlier this year. He personally made some lobster on a spoon dish. it was waaay too salty and you can't even taste the lobster at all. What the hell happened to the whole preserving the true ingredient taste that Iron Chefs so highly strives for? And now here at his restaurant. Since we weren't hungry, we only ordered the appetizers. Frankly, the appetizers sounded so much better than the dinner menu. The Tuna Pizza http://www.yelp.com/biz_… It's good, but it's not amazing in any way. Taste kinda like tuna salad you get anywhere else, with mayo. Tuna Tartare http://www.yelp.com/biz_… the whole reason why we were here in the first place. Supposed to be the best thing ever in the restaurant. But did they really use toro? the tuna is not fatty or concentrated in the deep, rich tuna flavor, it's bland! This is probably the least tasty toro I've ever had, and I'm comparing it to places in Miami. Oyster Foie Gras http://www.yelp.com/biz_… I can't taste the oyster, I can't taste the foie gras, I can't taste the uni. I CAN taste the hoisin sauce though, very very salty. not sure what the red fruit is in the center, but it's the best tasting thing in the whole dish. Wagyu Beef Carpaccio http://www.yelp.com/biz_… This is actually tasty. nice mixture of seasoning and sesame oil. But I've had real wagyu beef before, and this is not even close. it's too tough to be wagyu and not enough flavor. It tasted more like regular veal. Regardless the food, the service here is outstanding, so is the decor. But that is to be expected. I might come here again if Morimoto is in the restaurant serving his Morimoto Omakase.

Iron Chef Morimoto's self-named restaurant is definitely a high-end restaurant you want to check out if you want to experience "New York" style and attention to detail in both decor and food. The experience doesn't come cheap but if you're on vacation or have a special occasion, why not right? Your best bet here is to go with the prix fixe menu. If you don't want to do a full dinner, I recommend stopping by after dinner for dessert. Random highlight: The bathrooms are very interesting and have high-tech toilets that are more common in Japan than the U.S.

Came here for my birthday dinner, must say I left quite disappointed. The interior design of the restaurant is fantastic. It has a very modern look for a Japanese fusion place....you wont feel out of place dressed up or just in plain work attire. The service was immaculate, drinks were ok, the disappointment comes from the food. The food at Morimoto is good, but the fusion essence just didn't work for me. The dishes seem commercial. It was my birthday so we ordered a LOT of food, and to be honest, not a single one stuck out. They tasted fine, but I felt like each and every one was trying too hard to be different and sometimes these "spins" just don't work for Japanese. I hate to call food without soul... but that's what I got from morimoto. Don't think I'll be returning..

The best dinning experience I've ever had. Impressive decor, sleek, creative, and minimalistic. Needless to say the food was masterfully prepared and presented. Foie Gras infused tofu pudding, spicy king crab legs, unique toro appetizer, and the sushi was to die for. Haven't found any other Japanese restaurant to match this one, not even Nobu in Beverly Hills, or the other Morimoto in Napa. I'll have to come here every time I'm in town now!

The atmosphere was pretty nice, and the service wasn't bad. The While Lily cocktail from the downstairs bar was delicious! But not strong enough.. The place became packed after 8:30pm (Tuesday night). I ordered the Omakase menu because I always have trouble deciding when food descriptions come with more than 3 ingredients I'm unfamiliar with - and also because I wanted to pretend I was on the show, eating little spoonfuls of 8 random different things that supposedly all go together. Overall, the food was alright. I wasn't blown away, but maybe because I had my expectations set to high, and none of the dishes were really SATISFYING to eat. The drinks are good, make sure you order drinks! Tuna tartar was tasty and fun to eat too. I enjoyed my experience and would recommend others to try it out.

-sigh- I came here with high expectations! I read past reviews that raved about how great morimoto was! I came here today with my family in order to celebrate my brother's birthday. Ambiance and service seemed okay in the beginning. Food was great except for the toro. We order toro sashimi. One piece contained a giant bone along with tiny pieces of bones. I understand that fishes have bone but in a sashimi at morimoto's? I expected more. Manager came by and basically was like you know how it is. It's fish so it's normal. I mean he treated us to an extra piece but we didn't really want to eat it after that experience. Strike one. ?We decided to order a bottle of sake from the menu. When the sake came, it was 300 ml instead of 500 ml. My father noticed because it appeared a lot smaller. The waiter came and said that was as advertised on the menu. We checked it again and it was not the case which probably means a lot of people have been ripped off before. Strike two. As for strike three, waiter forgot to put in an order for one of our appetizers and served the birthday candle to the wrong person. All in all I was pretty disappointed in morimoto's. I would recommend the food (not the sashimi) and the ambiance is quite nice. They had an interesting selection of cocktails as well. As for whether or not I'd return, probably not since for the price of the food here I could have gotten better service and better food at other restaurants.

Truly a unique and unforgettable dining experience. First off, I was wow'd by the entrance. We walked up to an unmarked building and based on the red curtains in draped in a signature Japanese style, we knew it was Morimoto. The restaurant is very chic and modern and service was great. My only grip with this place is that our table was small and we ordered lots of food, so it got really tight. My bf ordered the following for us: Appetizers: Toro tartare Oyster foie gras Morimoto Sashimi Entree: Ramen Soup Seafood Toban Yaki Whole roasted lobster Dessert: Tofu hot and cold Can't complain about much, except for the fact that we were so full our stomachs hurt. The dishes were pieces of art and I can't get over the presentation. The toro tartare was a palette of extremely fresh toro and assorted sauces. The food was so delicate and fresh it melts in literally your mouth. The ramen was very simple and at first glance, I thought, "That's it?" But don't be fooled by the simple clear broth and noodles. There was something about that broth that was unlike any other. No need for spices and garnishes, it was perfect the way it was. The noodles were amazing. Yes, it's an expensive restaurant, but worth the try if you've never been. Definitely get the desserts! It compliments your meal and it's yummy. Minus one star for the space. Perhaps it's because it's NYC, but that's no excuse to cramp up the tables.

5 * for sure. I booked this place for my one year anniversary with a lovely little lady. Booked through open table weeks in advance since we were visiting from California. A friend recommended this place because she had tried the one in Philly. But this one is the one... the Iron Chef Morimoto himself was there the night we booked. Atmosphere: Fantastic design, from the curtain ceilings to the light piece in the middle, to the slide door restrooms. Very modern and simple. Nice lighting for a romantic night or a close dinner with family/friends. Service: Friendly staff that was more than informative and knowledgeable. I believe it was the GM that came out to greet us and asked if we needed anything else on top. After each course, the table was touched up and ready for the next. Food: I tried the Omikase (chef's tasting) which was highly recommended from the Yelp reviews. This was a 7 course, starting off with toro tartare, then a sashmi carpaccio, followed by oyster with foie gras and uni, an anchovies fondue with veggies, then a nigri plate, main course was a lobster in curry with a sourcream lime sauce?, and wagyu beef on top of sweet potatoes. Desert with mango mousse with passion fruit puree. I normally skip deserts but this one got me wanting more. Each course was made with perfection and came with a drink or a japanese fruit to help clean the taste for the next. I am for sure coming back next time, maybe ordering individually to try the other selections. But this is a MUST if you are in NYC. On top... located near Highline. A park on top of buildings which is perfect for a stroll after dinner, before hitting up any lounges.

I'm honestly a bit surprised with Morimoto in the sense that I wasn't really wowed by anything I had ordered. I never mind shelling out a whole lot of money for a really good or fancy meal but for the amount I spent at Morimoto's wasn't really worth it. I took two friends here for a late night dinner and for appetizers we ordered the ?Toro Tartare, Steamed Scallops, Foie Gras Chawan Mushi. The Toro Tartare was okay, I honestly wasn't sure exactly what was so special about it. Steamed Scallops were good and was cooked just right. The Foie Gras Chawan Mushi was.... interesting, I honestly wasn't sure what I thought about this dish. It was interesting, and tasted decent but there was something about the texture/feel in my mouth that I wasn't a fan of. As for our entrees we ordered the Spicy Salmon Roll, Salmon Skin Role, the Wagyu Beef Roll, and the Chirashi Bowl. All the rolls were okay, nothing special or out of the ordinary but for the most part the fish tasted pretty fresh. The Wagyu Beef Roll was a little bit plain in my opinion but was really tender and pretty good. The Chirashi Bowl came out and although it was beautiful and had a whole lot of chunks of fish, the fish didn't really taste all that fresh. I honestly couldn't finish the bowl (and this bowl was split between 3 people and we were still unable to finish it). Overall, if you were to ask me I'd say the food isn't bad, but it's not spectacular either and given the price I probably won't be returning again.

Over the holidays, I took my family of seven to this supposedly five-star restaurant. ?We all chose the omakase selection because we wanted to be wowed by the chef's own ideas and creations (like the late, lamented Sushi Nozawa, in Los Angeles, where the daily special was summed up by a sign that read, "TRUST ME"). ?Wrong move. The selections were so hit and miss that the entire meal suffered. ?A few of the seven or eight plates were good to very good, but the rest ranged from mediocre to poor, and even one "poor" is totally unacceptable, at these prices. We also gave the waitress pretty much carte blanche to select our sake and other wines, and she hosed us on the very expensive bottles. ?Look, I don't expect the waitress to steer us to the bargain basement items, but neither do I expect to get hit with $200 bottles of sake without asking. All in all, the experience was so disappointing we would NEVER go back. ?Compared to the meal served at Ouchi Ko in Austin, to which I gave five stars, I can only go two stars for this overpriced, underprepared restaurant.

Two reviews in one: Restaurant week and then the Omakase dining experience. 1) RESTAURANT WEEK --- I had my first Morimoto experience when I came here for lunch with two friends. I knew that the food wouldn't be the BEST that Morimoto had to offer, but I was still interested to see what kind of fare we would get. Among the three of us, we got the braised black cod and the wagyu beef. The lunch was served bento box style. Each bento box came with the following: 1) miso soup, which had huge pieces of tofu in it. 2) Salad. 3) 3 pieces of sashimi, 3 pieces of sushi with white ginger. 4) Vegetable tempura (asparagus and scallion) with a cheese based dipping sauce. For $24-ish it was not a bad deal at all. The best part of the meal was the dessert! The Green Tea Panna Cotta was freaking delicious. I think the dessert is what cemented my decision to return for dinner. 2) OMAKASE --- I came back a few weeks later for dinner. We decided to go with the Omakase menu, which is an extremely common practice in Japan. Basically in Japan, you pull up a seat and your entire menu is up to the chef. (but in Japan you can pay whatever you think your meal was worth... whereas you can't get away with that here!). The Omakase menu usually goes from lighter to heavier fare. For example, we started with some raw selections and worked our way up to the with surf and turf, finally ending with dessert. In my opinion, the Omakase is TOTALLY worth the price, and if you want the fullest dining experience at Morimoto's you need to get it. It's $125 per person. The chef included items that I would have never thought to order on my own, such as the oyster with foie gras. It was one of my favorite dishes that night. I saw some people ordering Omakase for the entire table... no no! That's just awkward. This is a 7-10 course menu, each plate is going to have small servings. Plus, it doesn't make sense to split a piece of sushi 3 ways! LASTLY, you need to use the bathroom there. Just GO even if you don't have to "go." The toilets are badays and are heated! I would totally stop by in the middle of winter just to warm up my patoot!

Service: (very subpar) To start off, my girlfriends and I had reservations for 11pm. OK i get it...we are coming in pretty late at night and the staff is tired. But that is no excuse for the poor service that we got. Right when we walked in, the hostess told us our table was still not ready...then just left it at that. we were left standing there for a good 5 minutes until one of my friends pointed out that there was a bar downstairs so we should go wait there. Then to make it worse when our table was finally ready..we went upstairs and looked around and saw that the whole restaurant was pretty much empty..why did we have to wait then?? Throughout dinner our drinks were not refilled, when asked for details to our dish...waiters did not know. we got no attention whatsoever throughout dinner. ------ Food: (ehh..overrated) All my friends and i got different appetizers to try... Beef carpaccio--OMFG..so amazing. it was melt in my mouth amazing. The best dish of the night. it was lightly drizzled with sweet garlic and soy ginger..the flavors were just right and you get that yummy wagu beef taste. Lamb carpaccio: another story...it was bland and unmemorable Toro Tartare: this is suppose to be their "famous" appetizer. It was average. I thought the mashed up tuna was silky and very fresh. the compliments that the tuna came with were all great pairs to bring out the flavor for the dish..however i just didnt think it lived up to the hype Shrimp Tempura: it was very good, it was light fried and the wasabi and spicy sauce were seasoned perfectly. -- Entree i got the main course for sushi/sashimi --average. I wont be judgmental about this because the raw fish were all fresh and besides that you cant really get that fancy with sashimi. However, i did get the sea urchin..and it was terrible. This was my first time trying sea urchin so I just thought this was how its suppose to taste like..but went to a few other sushi places afterwards and it did not have that weird chemical taste. not up to its hype.

We reserved a table Saturday night. We get seated at a quiet table. Are waiter Tristan was absolutely 100% professional. We started with a bottle Hakkaisan Sake. Very refreshing . Appetizer: Toro Tartare. Very fresh and tasty. Tuna tartare. what a great starter.Also looked fantastic. Main courses: Black Cod. Something to die for. Fresh, light, perfectly cooked. Yummy . My friends ordered Toban Yakii which was excellent dish packed with all kind of see creatures:) Crown jewelry of the dinner was the sushi and the sashimi combo. Plenty fresh tasty perfectly prepared sushi. The sashimi falls apart in your mouth. After our meal we experienced the bar down stars. The lychee martini was great. The design of the restaurant was sophisticated, modern basic but still very friendly atmosphere. I will definitely return.

Had an amazing dinner here with great company. - spicy king crab - delicious and fresh. like the spiciness. adds a kick to it - oyster foie gras with uni: the combination of different textures blew my mind. too much teriyaki sauce - toro tartare was very interesting, with 5 different sauces to have it with. presentation was beautiful - black cod was delicious. heavy on the sauce but very flaky. - uni sashimi was very fresh - had the camelia / watermelon soju cocktail. phenomenal. - conversation over dinner: priceless

I finally ate at Morimotos!! ?I've been wanting to go to Morimotos for such a long time to try their omikase that I've heard so much about. ?My husband brought me for a late birthday dinner. ? The service was impeccable, the decor was trendy, and the food was delicious. ?The dinner was expensive but you get what you pay for. ?There were 1 or 2 things that I wasn't crazy about but the entree was top quality. ?

Disappointing. ? I guess I expected too much? But is it wrong of me to? Considering this is a very pricey place with a lot of recognition. ?The best way to describe my reaction to this place is this smiley face ?: | Obviously it can't be disgusting, its Morimoto. ?But at the same time it wasn't good either. ?The food is what I want to focus on because all the money in the world can create a beautiful restaurant and a fabulous staff. ?The problem that I had with the food was that it was masked with flowers and cool plating and fancy things. ?Close your eyes and eat their food next time and you'll realize that its just mediocre. ?I love a beautiful dish, don't get me wrong, but only if its as equally as beautiful, chomped up in my mouth as well. ? The most disappointing thing however, was something so basic, the rice. ?Honestly, I've had better plain white rice at the local $6.95 General Tso take out restaurant. ?It was dry, hard.... just terrible. ?I am 100% positive that if Morimoto himself were to try this rice that I had he would shake his head. ?Maybe it was a bad night? But the sushi rice was like that as well and honestly a bad night is a bad excuse for any Japanese restaurant, their rice should always be good. ? I've skimmed through a lot of these reviews and yes, this place is stunning, yes you feel like a million bucks, yes the bathroom turns urinating into a whole new experience but focus people! The food! Imagine eating this food on your couch watching Teen Moms. ?Would it be delicious then?

I LOVED it here. A friend was visiting from Miami so 3 of us went out to dinner here before hitting the town. ?the atmosphere her was perfect. ?They had a little bit of everything. ?You could sit in an area that was set up with tiered seating. ?Each level had a few tables on it. ?The very bottom was a large table with about 16 or so seats. ?There's a giant wall that cuts through some of the restaurant from the lower level bar leading up to the ceiling of the restaurant area. It's covered in clear glass bottles and back lit. ?It sets the tone for an incredible meal. The other side of the restaurant has 2 or 3 tables grouped together and sectioned off by glass partition. ?The glass isn't completely clear. ?And it makes it so that you're surrounded by people, but there's enough of a barrier that you can speak softly and be heard by those at your table. There was also a rather large sushi bar in the back of the restaurant. And a bar/lounge on the lower level. The food is to die for! If you go, don't skip the Spicy King Crab Appetizer. You'll regret not having it once you know how good it tastes! the miso soup comes in a huge bowl and the tofu was the freshest I've ever had. ?It melts in your mouth. Drinks were strong and they were completely flexible about any adjustments to our orders.

I would have to say of all the restaurants I've been to in my life so far, Morimoto's will be number one on that list til the day I die. It is truly worthy of Iron Chef Morimoto .......who I actually met during the entree course. Service is unmatched with their attention to detail and client relations. I say client relations because that's what you feel like. You're not some customer that stopped by to grab a quick bite, you are there so that the staff can invest their time and effort into making your experience at this restaurant the best it can be. The hostess not only showed us to our seats but took the time to get to know us before our waiter even came. Then the manager came to introduce himself to us and asked if he could accommodate us even more than we were already. I didn't even try a single bite of food yet and I was already amazed at this place. I decided not to go with omakase menu so that I could choose for myself. So here are the things I chose to eat. I started off with some sushi selections. There are so many but I chose my favorites. Soft Shell Crab Roll, Spicy Tuna Roll, and Squid Sashimi. The crab tasted fresh and the outside was not overly fried or oily. The roll was rolled tightly enough so that nothing was falling out, but loose enough so that you could neatly see all the ingredients. The Spicy Tuna was savory and not overly spicy, the fish was chopped into small chunks instead of the usual paste that most sushi places do. The texture of the small chunks really made this roll very palatable as a starter. The squid was fresh and had no signs of being left on the counter or overly stored in the fridge. Next was the tempura calamari salad. When it came out I thought I had they had brought me the wrong dish because it was piled high with succulent calamari. They must have tenderized the calamari before frying it because there wasn't any hint of chewiness or being overcooked. You didn't look at the salad and think "I wish there was more calamari", no, you looked at it and said "damn! that's a lot of a calamari! The Morimoto Sashimi was my favorite. It's a layered wall of hamachi, eel, seared toro and lean tuna. Each section of the wall is topped with a small morsel of something special that enhances the already amazing flavors from the sashimi. If that wasn't amazing enough, you're given 5 pipettes of sauce to mix and match with the sashimi. Fun to eat, great to eat, even better to savor. I ordered the Seafood Tobanyaki, which is a seafood stew. It has lobster, scallops, king crab, mussels.... so divine. The broth is subtle enough so that every piece of seafood flavor shines. Each piece was also cooked to perfection, nothing was overcooked or chewy and they were cleaned and prepared properly. We also had the surf and turf entree. Kobe Beef with Hamachi, served tableside... amazing. The beef was perfectly seared and had great texture. The hamachi was fresh and tasted great with the herbed potatoes. Dessert comprised of Concord Grape Sorbet, Lychee Sorbet, and Green Apple Sorbet.... I wish they opened up a Morimoto's Sorbet Shop. I could eat an entire tub of each. As we were paying, the manager made sure to greet us and make sure the meal went well. Nothing could have made it better. Especially when we got to meet Morimoto himself. Eating at Morimoto's is like a wedding, you're most likely only going to be able to go there once, so might as well go big or go home. Be prepared to spend and you'll never regret what you get for a meal. Some people look at their wedding photos and go "Awwww...", I look at my photos from this restaurant and go "yum. I gotta go back there again".

Morimoto's Omakase was easily one of the best meals of my life. From the atmosphere at the restaurant (dimly light, modern, elegant and special) to the service and the food....it was an amazing experience. An evening full of wonderous suprises delivered to our table, one after the next :) Here's a breakdown on the courses: 1. Tuna Toro Tartare--oh my gosh. This course was delightful. Smooth, silky tuna with an assortment of delicate dipping sauces. Perfect way to start the meal, and left me craving more. 2. Eel Salad--Very, very thinly sliced eel with delcate greens and a light seasame- flavored sauce. Mild, fresh flavors and textures. 3.Anchovy fondue--Wow, this dish was extremely flavorful. A pot of ceamy anchovy sause with an assortment of dippables. Very playful and unexpected dish in the lineup. I loved it. 4. Salmon--One delicious bite of perfectly seared salmon. A bit crispy on the outside, buttery and tender on the inside. 5. Homemade Ginger Ale-- A little palate cleanser before the main course. 6. 5 pieces of sushi- easily the freshest sushi I have ever had. Simple, delicious. 7. Lobster & Wagu Beef--Wow. I usually find lobster tough, no matter how its prepared. Well, Morimoto's lobster was magical. I dont know what his secret is but this lobster was tender and fell apart in my mouth. The beef was the best I've ever tasted (and I dont say this lightly). Buttery and tender, I didn't want this dish to end. 8. I forget what this desert was called! But it was long cake-like brownies with two different kinds of sorbet, and covered with a sprinking of caramel popcorn. Like meeting an old friend at the airport after a trip around the world. We sipped two bottles of sparkeling Rose throughout the meal, which was a fresh and light compliment to all of the courses. I absolutely loved this meal. I can't wait to go back to Morimoto!

Food - 3 Decor - 4 Service - 3 Food relative to price - 2 Food poisoning for a week - 0 I had high hopes for Morimotos since many of my friends have dined here and loved it. Also, I am a big fan of Iron Chef so dining at the famous guy's place was a dream of mine. My table opted for the tasting menu. Lets start with a positive note- the mango custard dessert was tasty. The toro tartare was good because of the accompaniments it came with but I didn't think the quality of the fish itself was that great. The sushi was good, but again, I've had fresher fish. I was really looking forward to the oyster/foie gras/uni combo. But alas, I was heavily disappointed when a giant grilled oyster (not sure the type, but definitely NOT kumamoto) came out with a shriveled up piece of foie that could have been a rotten raisin. Furthermore, I'm almost certain this is the dish that gave me food poisoning. I didn't have anything else to eat or drink that night but I woke up at 2AM dashing for the toilet before I puked on the sheets. I threw up for the next 6 hours straight. I was immobilized and unable to keep food down for the next week. In addition to the horrible aftermath of my dinner, the meal itself took almost 3 hours. Not because we were taking our time, or because there were so many dishes. There was an issue with the kitchen that delayed our food. I appreciate that the manager came around to apologize since we hadnt even complained. But for such a famed restaurant, get your act together! This was obviously a very off night for Morimotos. I dont know what happened or if my dish was intentionally tampered with, but it was totally unacceptable. Morimotos was on the list of must try places this year in NY. I am a bit heartbroken since I had such high expectations but actually had the worst restaurant experience here. I wish I had the great experience that everyone seems to tell me about. But honestly, I'm too scared to go back again to change my initial impression. To put some salt on an open wound, the bill came o0ut to over $160 per person. Beware of the fish and oysters if you go!

Food: 3.5 Ambiance: 5 Service: 3 Morimoto is the quintessential NYC restaurant--Food Network celebrity chef, huge two floors, and the décor and basement bar are sleek and beautiful. ?While it is not the most authentic Japanese cuisine, it is definitely still a fun dining experience and I've always really enjoyed my meals here. ?This is a great place to take out-of-towners to really experience the grandeur of dining in the Meatpacking district. ? Great selection of cocktails. The fish is fresh here, so order rolls and sushi nigiri. ?All the appetizers are fun, small portions. I would recommend ordering a selection of cold and hot appetizers, since these are the most unique in combination of flavors and presentation. ?On an episode of Food Network's "Best Thing I Ever Ate" they suggest Morimoto's Toro Tartare. While the presentation is delightful, skip this dish--gimmicky and the toro tartare is mashed up so you can't enjoy the texture of the fatty fish. I love the Surf and Turf entree here as well as the Duck entree. Note: Ribeye Steak is delicious but HUGE. Definitely share with at least 1 or 2 other people if you're planning on ordering this. If you're looking for a fun environment that is not too loud, where you can dress up in a Meatpacking environment, extensive menu offering light food before a night out, then this is the perfect place.

What started off badly turned into one of the best meals I've ever had and my new favorite resturant, all thanks to their manager Patrick and simply amazing food. Good food is worth every penny, but my only initial hesitation with Morimoto was being afraid it was just another overhyped resturant. ?Our table of three had 10:15pm reservations on a Friday night (tip: book your reservation more then 24 hours ahead of time) and we arrived slightly before 10. We still had to wait til 10:30 to be seated, but whatever the cocktails downstairs made up for it. ?We ordered the hydrainga, white lily, and camellia. Worth $14 each, not sure but I see myself coming in just to head to the bar. They were yummy. After being seated things went bad. We were "greeted" by our waiter who didn't bother introducing himself, so I can't even tell you his name, or even looking at us when he rudely asked us what kind of water we wanted and walked off with his nose in the air. But whatever, he came back and again we dealt with his "I don't care" pretentious attitude but we gave our orders. ?At this point I need to point out that the three of us each ordered a cocktail, ordered 3 appetizers, and 3 entrees. In no way were we being cheap or looked like a mess. ?So when he didn't even read us the specials, spent all his time smoozing his other two tables, and left our water glasses without water for over 20 minutes while walking by us a few times and not even bothering to bat an eyelash at us, we had an issue. I apologize to the poor waiter who we randomly flagged down to ask to speak to your manager. I simply just wanted a new waiter, but the manager Patrick went far above that and sincerely apologized and vowed to make sure the rest of the night went well. We had ordered the tuna tartare, Morimoto sashimi, and spicy king crab as appetizers. The tartare is a lot tinier in person but the six different dips were perfect. I highly recommend it to everyone. Also ordered some uni and it was delicious. As an entree I ordered the duck duck duck. I loved the sauces that came with the duck, the duck was cooked perfectly, and the croissant was pleasantly surprising. They also don't skimp on how much food they give you on your entree plates. The desserts were perfect with some green tea. Ordred the apple bread pudding and the hold and cold tofu. ?The bread pudding was good but the tofu cheesecake stole the show. I absolutely loved it. Thank you for a great night to everyone who we came across Friday night, except to our first waiter of course. But all of you made this a meal to remember and I'm ready to come back soon! This was also an early birthday meal and the other ones I'll have for the rest of the week will definitely not compare. I'm calling it.

I must admit I expected something special. ?But It was so bad I honestly felt like there was a hidden camera on us. ?I used to live in NYC. ?Now in Chicago. ?I was embarrassed by how bad it all was in front of my wife. ?Maybe because I talked it up....or maybe because the waiter and I met eyes...and we both knew...this was a joke. ?Worst...ever. ? ? Servers were nice...but seemed embarrassed. ?NYC should be embarrassed too.

Their sushi freshness is unbelievable and their cocktails are pretty amazing too. Overall dining experience is nice and upscale and you can get a table large enough to fit 8-10 people altogether which is great for get-togethers like birthday parties, bachelorette parties or just a nice couples dinner. The Kobe beef is simply melt in your mouth amazing, while the sea urchin sushi and white tuna are both delicious and high quality. They have a white lily cocktail that is so good you have to try it. Morimoto is pricey, it can cost up to $150-$200 per person with cocktails but if it's a special occasion it's restaurant where you can really have a unique and enjoyable dining experience.

If you decide to come here for the restaurant week lunch special, DO NOT COME HUNGRY, or prepare to have a deep pocket to fill your tummy. The menu offers 3 bento boxes with the choice of grilled wagyu beef box, braised black cod box, and the vegetarian box. ?Each box comes with miso soup, salad, tempura, sushi, and seasonal fruit panna cotta. ?Each box costs $24.07. ?Though it sounds like a lot of food, everything came in bite size portions (see photo). ?There is only one thin slice of beef in the size of half a dollar bill in the beef box. ?The black cod comes in 6 slices in the size of a dollar coin. ?There are 3 pieces of tempura dipped in cheese, and 6 pieces of sushi. ?BF and I were hungry when we came in, so we also ordered a soft-shelled crab roll on the side. The tempura was quite outstanding despite of the fact that I don't like the cheese dipping. ?The crab roll was fantastic and actually with SOFT SHELLS!! ?Our waiter was friendly and helpful. ?The rest of the bento box was pretty looking and okay tasting, but really nothing to write home about. With 2 bento boxes, 1 sushi roll, and 2 green tea ($8 each), the total was about $85. ?Based on the sushi roll I had, I have a feeling that the food on their regular menu is better than the bento box. ? The restaurant week bento box is a 3.5 star in my book.

aaaaamaazing. I'm a big sushi fan so take me to any good sushi spot and you have me smitten. Morimoto is in a league of its own when it comes to this though. We ordered the Omakase and the toro tartare was my absolute favorite. Sigh, I can't wait to go back to nyc just to revisit this place.

I came here for my birthday dinner and felt a little out of my element because I had never been to a $$$$ restaurant before. ?Super swanky! ?However, the staff is nice and they didn't make me feel embarrassed despite all of my ettiquite-related faux pas (what's the plural of faux pas? ?Oh well). ? The wait staff was a little awkward, taking our plates all at once and trying to balance them instead of coming back, having to repeat our order back to us, etc. ?But I'd guess that was all because it's a busy place. The miso soup was fantastic. ?Sizeable pieces of tofu, as compared to the tiny cubes you receive in other places. ?I can't remember the names of what we had but one was a tasting of various fish (even octopus, which I will not be eating again, ha). ?We also had some medium tuna sashimi which was delicious. ?The other dish was supposed to be fish with veggies on a bed of rice but they didn't really give us veggies. ?It was a LOT of fish to handle in one sitting but we felt pretty healthy while eating it. ?I have to say that the fish was incredibly fresh, and the bottle of Proseco we ordered was very tasty. The people at the table next to us had the tuna tartare, which looked amazing and the presentation was very appealing. ?I'd love to go back and try it!...with some regular ol' rolls and that miso soup ;)

Be ready to drop some money at this one and make a reservation in advance if you want to have dinner there. We did the Chef's tasting menu for $125 a person (not including drinks) but it was totally worth it. They also completely accommodate both gluten and shellfish allergies. I did miss out on wagyu beef because it came with lobster but the rest of my dishes were amazing. Check out below to see what we ate! The first item was a tuna tartar with wasabi, sour cream, seaweed paste, chives, avocado and rich cracker dipping sauces. You used a little scraper tool to scrap off some of the tuna, dip it in soy sauce and then dip it in one of the six tasting sauces. Very simple but very delicious and obviously an awesome presentation. Next was suzuki white fish with aioli, ginger, garlic, mushrooms and olive oil which was probably the tastiest thing on the menu other than my yellowtail fried rice. The sauce was so thick texture-wise, yet light taste-wise. I don't like mushrooms and still loved this dish. The first warm dish was Bana Cota (Anchovies, Garlic, Chives, Lemon and Olive Oil) with mortadella peppers, tomato, radish, pancetta and crostini for dipping. The presentation of this was amazing too and the bana cota just bubbled away inside the candle. It had been made in such perfect proportions that the anchovies weren't overwhelming at all. Due to my shellfish allergy the next plate was a simple smoked salmon ravioli with sweet yam broth. Everyone else got an oyster. This dish felt like a replacement and wasn't anything special. The sushi plate consisting of toro, barracuda, smelt, yellowtail and mackerel was some of the best fish I've ever had. The toro literally melted - I didn't even have to chew. DELICIOUS. My main dish was yellowtail fried rice which is what I had instead of the wagyu beef and lobster tail. At first I was bummed that I was missing out on the wagyu until I started eating this. It tasted similar to bibimbap but not spicy. They bring it to your table with the fish piled on top of the rice mixture and then mix it in front of you. Smelled amazing. Tasted even more amazing. Slipped straight into a food coma after this dish. The final plate was dessert which was a pot de creme with Okinawa dark sugar, passionfruit caramel and sweet soybeans encrusted in sugar. It was good but not necessarily my favorite. I'm not a big pot de creme fan but it was a good mixture of flavors. Not too rich. Overall an amazing experience and I would definitely go back although I probably wouldn't pay to do the chef's menu again.

Awesome. Great food, good service, nice setting. I'd definitely come back. For those that ever watch Iron Chef and you drool thinking about eating that food, well, Morimoto's is the place to experience it. I ordered the 10-course omakase (3 more courses than the "regular" version). The waiter was very helpful describing each dish and answering questions. The slight nit I have on the service was that I would've wanted roughly 20-30% less time between courses. Overall our 10-course omakase was about 3 hours from the time we sat down. Others were out in about 2 hours. Here's how it broke down in chronology for the food with a 1-5 scoring, 5 being the highest. Note: all food was good at least, I'm grading on a curve. The worst dish, which was still delicious, gets a 1. (3) Toro tartar with a sampling of sauces: wasabi, seaweed, avocado, rice cracker, sour cream, chives, and soy. This is probably their most popular appetizer, and it certainly was tasty. The rice crackers were strong for the delicate flavor, so use sparingly. I also knock it down one rating because it was a bit challenging to eat between dipping the toro and the awkward triangular spoon. (5) Seared fluke with scallions, some sauce. I don't know what the sauce was, but it was delicious. Oily, creamy, slightly salty, but not overpowering for the seared fish. The light scallion was also a nice touch. (4) Sashimi. Very tasty; the octopus (tako) and abalone in particular were great. The tako was a part of the octopus that wasn't easily identifiable (not a tentacle). Toro was tasty of course. (1) Salad with anchovy dip. The dip was tasty, but the dipping options weren't very inspiring. They were cute, though. Baby radish, the smallest cucumber ever (looks like a tiny watermelon), bread, and a couple others... I would've been content with more basic veggies (spinach?) and using the dip as a dressing. Or just more of the cucumber and radish. (2) Oyster with foie gras and uni, covered in teriyaki sauce. Honestly, this dish would've been AMAZING if each ingredient were served separately and the dressing used sparingly. I asked, and they suggested I eat them all together. I got a rush of fois gras and teriyaki sauce, with an aftertaste of uni followed by a bit of oyster. Three flavor-rich ingredients that were dominated by one, and the sauce overpowered all of it. Great idea, weak execution. (2) Rabbit loin and sausage, in some sort of mashed vegetable. I thought I heard him say ramps? It didn't taste like it, though. More like a sweet potato, but that wasn't right either. I didn't care for the sweet and salty combo, and I'm not usually a huge sweet and savory fan anyway, but in this case I would've wanted to taste the smokiness of the rabbit sausage which was masked in the sweet mashed paste. Also, I felt the potentially delicious yet delicate rabbit loin was lost in the flavors of the sauce and sausage. I would recommend separating the flavors a bit. (3) Sushi. Good not great. I don't know how to differentiate good from great, honestly. I'll say that I really liked the mackerel with the horseradish. Toro (I never know if it's otoro, chutoro) excellent as always. Sushi rice wasn't overly moist or dry. Personally I favor 5-10% more moisture, but I don't know what's "right". (5) Grilled crab. So simple! Grilled yet succulent. No dried out crab, here! And the grilled flavor really carried through. They also covered it in a yuzu butter. The only disappointing part was that we got this baby lime to squeeze over the crab, but it was good for maybe 2 mL of juice. I guess that's good to prevent overenthusiastic lemon squeezers. (4) Surf and turf. This was wagyu beef over yam, and lobster in a garam masala with lemon creme fraiche. Wagyu beef is lost on me. I couldn't differentiate it from a medium rare kalbi. Yam was delicious; in fact, if they could pull off slightly more caramelization without overcooking - amazing. Lobster was succulent and tasty, and the extra flavoring was a nice touch. (5) Dessert 1: mango pudding with passion fruit dressing, green tea ice cream, cocoa biscotti, yogurt crumbs, and a few goji berries. AMAZING. This is the dessert in the regular omakase. It's delicious. Sweet but not overbearingly so. The passion fruit tartness helps balance the overall sweetness. (4 for souffle, 2 for doughnut+ice cream. Poached peach in ice cream gets a 4) Dessert 2: waaay too much. A cheesecake souffle topped with raspberry ice cream, a side of green tea crumbles and fruit (including a lychee you should absolutely eat first because it's sweetness is lost if you take a bite of any of the souffle), along with some fruit sauces on the side. They also (1) had a sugary covered doughnut filled with red bean paste that you were supposed to dip in a peach soft serve with poached peaches, that also had some fruit tapioca (boba). This second part was too sweet; I had to chase the doughnut with ice cream, if you can believe it. Poached peach - awesome.

The only bad thing was the dessert. Maybe they have a better one than we ordered. The people next to us had e duck,duck,duck and surf and turf; so did we. Turn out, the people next to them didn't love the tasting menu, maybe it was the price =p. but anyway great sushi, outstanding food ( even as leftovers ). Lovely atmosphere but not enough space to cuddle next to your date over dessert, which was not nearly as good as the food said it would be. The bathrooms, service, quality of food, and atmospheres deem this an outstanding restaurant.

I am in love with this restaurant, and it is worth every single penny. Every dish I've had is exquisite, and the quality of the fish they get is unmatched in NYC. One dish that I must always get each time I go here is the Toro Tartare. It comes on a board with a small selection of dips (crunch, whipped avocado, soy, etc.) and is truly excellent. The space of Morimoto is also exquisite and unique. It is a very modern, airy warehouse space. Clean lines, white and glass, with curved stairs leading to the bar. It is a great date spot.

The restaurant was gorgeous. You must check out the restrooms as well. We went there for lunch during NYC Restaurant Week. The selection was limited for Restaurant Week menu. There were wagyu beef, braised black cod and vegetable options. The braised black cod was amazing - the fish was tender and had a nice flavor with a bit of sweetness to it. It was served with a few pieces of sushi, salad, and soup. This would be great for a special occasion.

Came here during restaurant week. Food is excellent, but don't come too hungry since the portion sizes are quite small. Don't be fooled by the less-than-glamorous location- the interior tells an entirely different story. The restaurant's decor is modern looking and comfortable. Be sure to check out the bathrooms with the sliding doors and semi-hidden dryer. Sushi was fresh and delicious, but alas, the bento box only comes with 6 pieces. Miso soup was good- not too salty. The tempura veggies were the most unusual- they came in a creamy cheese flavored dip that tasted good, but was somewhat unnecessary. The grilled wagyu beef was thinly sliced, tender, and sauced just the right amount. The black cod with miso was soft, sweet, and had none of that unpleasant fishy flavor. The meal was finished with a delightful coconut and fruit panna cotta. Would I come back? Absolutely! Food came promptly and service was spot on. Just be prepared to pay for the experience- it is definitely on the expensive side. It would definitely be worth it to come back just for more yummy sushi and omakase.

what we ate- toro tartare, miso cod, maki rolls (eel, spicy tuna, spicy salmon), miso soup the first time i came to morimoto i brought my mom and aunt who were visiting. it was a perfect wow factor for them as they watch food network and recognized the name plus the interior is very chic and hip. drinks here are good. some of the martinis were on the sweet side for me but they definitely have some good options to choose from. since then i have come often and mostly for lunch. you can actually eat here very reasonably priced if you do their set menu at lunch and even add on some extra sushi rolls. it comes with soup, salad, veggie tempura, a few pieces of sushi and a choice of main (i always get miso cod and the bf always gets the beef), and a dessert. it is such a good deal and it is rarely crowded so we sit at the sushi bar and watch them work away. seriously do it!

Beautiful...unique...delicious. On the pricier side, but Morimoto is outstanding in its interior design (merging modern design with nature elements), service, and food. I was here last night with a couple of girlfriends to catch up over dinner. I waited for them downstairs at the bar, which looked like a slab of ice with imprints of leaves inside. Gorgeous. I had the morimotini while I waited, which was lovely and strong. Looking around as we were seated, I loved how smaller areas were sectioned off by semi-transparent glass panels so it felt private despite the fact that other tables were seated right around you. Great ambiance and the service was great. Water was never empty, and the waiters gave good recommendations on food. The three of us split a bunch of appetizers and a main dish: Tuna pizza - I was a little wary of this when I read the description, but I really liked it. The anchovy aioli was delicious. Wagyu beef carpaccio - Wish there had been more of this. Beef was of excellent quality, loved the flavor of the yuzu with sweet garlic. Sauce was great. YUM! Morimoto sashimi - Surprisingly, this was my least favorite dish. I found a couple of the sashimi pieces to be less flavorful than other sushi places I've been to. That being said, I bet the omakase features some great, fresh sashimi vs this regular menu item. Oyster foie gras - I think this could have been amazing if they had not been as heavy-handed with the teriyaki sauce. The sauce overwhelmed the delicate flavor of uni and oyster. A dab would have been sufficient (with some extra sauce on the side for those who absolutely need it). Ishi Yaki Buri Bop - It's like Korean bibimbop! But with yellowtail. It was fun to watch. The crispy rice with the slightly cooked yellowtail was great texture-wise. Flavors were spot on. Super filling - we couldn't finish this. All in all, a great meal. I definitely want to come back to try the omakase...for a special occasion though. Quite pricey!

Exquisite and up-scale restaurant is a MUST see MUST try experience. For restaurant week, I couldn't believe I was able to make reservations and enjoy the best of "Iron Chef" delectables. ?I'm sure his majesty no longer needs to make the food personally. ?The prix-fixe menu included bento box of either Black Cod or Beef. ?As a food enthusiasts, I would totally snatch a bite out of my friend's plate for taste testing. ?Which I did. ?I loved both dishes. ?The bento box included ?varieties of sushi, salad, miso soup, fried tempura. ?The dessert was the most delicious. ?It was green tea mousse with fruit topping. Amazing for $24 bucks, with tax and tips, we only spent $32. ? On the main level, the theme was bottles stacked up in a fashionable, artsy way. ?One of my girlfriend said the bottles were moveable. ?Imagine one wrong move. ?Collapse! ?: ) At high end restaurants, where is the most inquisitive spot in the entire restaurant? ?You guessed it! ?Definitely check out the backroom, even if you have no urges. ?Sorry to be so explicit, but make sure you sit on toilet seat. ?It was heated, in the middle of summer. ?he he.. ?Also, what was astonishing were buttons lined up on the left side of stall. ?Reading down the line, you can experience drying, oscillating fan, cleaning with water gushing, and flushing. ?I bet it was a Japanese invention. ?Those Japs really invest highly into their bathroom needs. ?Behind the toilet seat, you will see mirrors of cherry blossoms projected hundreds of times behind with 3d effects. I will definitely return to have a remarkable and pleasant meal again. ? Try for yourself! ?Well worth it.

Stopped in for lunch after a nice walk through The Highline. ?It's been nearly a decade since it's opening that I've been meaning to visit this iron chef restaurant. ? ?The pre fix lunch was a nice option and it did not disappoint. ? The hostess was nice enough seat us immediately to a not yet half filled first floor ( it is a Monday afternoon after all ) and made my wife and I welcomed. ?Not to our surprise, but no sightings of the Iron Chef. ?However, my wife did point out that the head of the food network was seated across from us. ?She was struggling for his name but knew he did shows with Bobby Flay to pick the next food network star. ? Onward to the lunch menu which featured what we expected, of course raw fish in all it's incarnations with prices from not cheap to very steep if we wanted to bathe in the full Morimoto experience. ? We were happy to see a solidly put together pre fix bento lunch box and priced well at around $25. ?We ordered some spicy tuna and spicy yellowtail and few pieces of sashimi to round off the raw experience and two bentos, one with braised black cod and the other with kobe beef. ?The waiter was pleasant young taking our order but I felt he failed us a bit when he did not mention the bento will include the same spicy yellow tail rolls as we ordered our supplemental pieces. ?I wound up eating 11 pieces of it- I suppose I could complain of worse things than to eat too many pieces of sushi, but the lack of variety could have been avoided. ? The sushi/ sashimi arrived first with some fresh grated wasabi, which is always welcomed but lacked a bit of the expected heat. ? California uni and scallops were very good, fresh and sweet. ? The spicy tuna roll is made with cut tuna and not finely chopped tuna which was nice. ? The bento boxes arrived shortly and was very pleasing on the eyes. ?The black cod was braised with a flavor similar to what you would expect from the sauce on grilled eel. ?The flesh was very soft but still held it's shape and did not disintegrate. ?The kobe beef was tender and flavorful. ?The miso soup was surprising amazing with what I assume to be house made tofu pieces, I just know it did not come from a box. ?Ate the soup the way it was meant to be by bringing the whole bowl to my mouth so I can smell the aroma of the soup, a spoon would fail to deliver that. ?The 3 sushi pieces with the box was each perfectly sized and proportioned for one bite, made with fresh melt in your mouth fish. ? Salad greens were lightly dressed and what you would expect. ?The tempura was a bit of a weak link to the box, it had cooled off a bit by the time I ate it, which I will often eat first to get the hot crunchy-ness of the batter. ?It was also sitting in a bowl of sauce which resembled a ranch type dressing which I didn't expect and made it taste heavy and forced upon. ?By the time I downed all the yellowtail rolls, I needed a pillow and a blankie. ?But, the mango panna cotta with berries dessert woke me up and capped off a great meal. ? ? A very good midday dining experience at a very fine restaurant. ?I would definitely return for lunch and should go back for the full speed experience. ?I just hope it won't take me til the next decade.

I'm a fan of Morimoto. I got to try things I wasn't able to eat on my 1st visit such as... Toro tartare - What an innovative dish! I totally did not picture it coming out the way it did, but it was good and the various accompaniments and garnishes complemented the toro, plus it was fun mixing everything to make different flavors. Oyster foie gras - With uni on top. Good, but the teriyaki sauce was kind of overpowering so I wasn't able to taste as much as I wanted out of this dish. Rock shrimp - Came out in 2 heaping portions - one with wasabi aioli and the other with this spicy pepper sauce. Both were crispy for having been tossed in the sauces and had a subtle but flavorful taste to them. Surf &Turf - It came with Wagyu filet, bok choy (they had no problem subbing the herbed potatoes that usually come with this), and hamachi "ribbons" mixed with avocado and citrus, which they mix tableside. My bf and I both agreed that we loved the hamachi and bok choy but could do without the beef. Of course, if we wanted good meat, we would have gone to a steakhouse. Sea bass - With Japanese eggplant, avocado, miso with a sweet sake glaze. Sooo flaky and delicious! I absolutely loved this dish. My only gripe is that I wish the fish portion was bigger. If I hadn't ordered the rock shrimp app, I would have still been hungry. I'm glad I came back. Good things come to those who wait.

Morimoto's cannot be overhyped. I'm not going to sit here and type the crap out of every dish my cousin and I ordered, because everyone else has already done that. But I WILL tell you that this place is amazing, and that no review could give you even the slightest idea of how wonderful this place really is. This place really lives up to the over-achieving Asian standard, and Morimoto isn't even trying. Plate after plate after plate, my cousin and I looked up at each other between bites with our foodgasm faces. We just couldn't bring ourselves to stop eating. Every bite was worth every dollar we paid for it.

Great restaurant week experience - Sat at the bar (yup, special privilidge for going alone, haha) and got the wagyu beef bento box, here's the rundown: Miso soup - fantastic freshly made tofu sitting on the bottom of what otherwise would've been normal miso soup - 4/5 Tempura - very delicately flavored with the creamy dipping sauce, and the veggies were well prepared - 5/5 Salad - great yuzu flavors, frie scallions adds a layer of flavor to the otherwise simple salad. ?Thought I tasted a hint of wasabi in there, but overall it could've used a little more ... something. ?Like trade the spring lettuce for the bite in arugla, or add a few thin slices of cherry tomatos. - 3/5 Spicy tuna roll - nice seasme scent, 4/5 Sushi - Good sushi, good fish. ?Your standard "good suhsi" - 5/5 Wagyu beef - Hmmm... I was sort of expecting the delicate, Japanese beef when I hear wagyu, but it was a bit tougher than expected (fully cooked), and strongly seasoned (felt more like stir-fry beef)... - 3/5 Dessert - green tea custard with coconut - tasty with a nice gelatin layer on the bottom :) 4/5

Morimoto is a beautiful restaurant with excellent service. We arrived 15 minutes before our reservation time but they kindly sat us anyways. Our waiter seemed happy to be at his job and came off as genuinely friendly. Our drinks were delicious. I especially enjoyed the "hydrangea" which was light and refreshing. We had a variety of sushi for dinner. Probably some of the best sushi I have ever had. Simple, but fresh and delicious. I loved the open and modern decor of the restaurant. The women's bathroom stalls were pretty cool, too.

Ever since Japanese Iron Chef, my brother and I have been dying to visit Morimoto's restaurant. For baby brother's graduation gift, decided to take him. A phenomenal experience and the restaurant lived up to our childhood dreams. We went with the omakase and the sake pairings. Out of our dishes, I would say my favorites include the toro tartare, oyster, sushi, and mango mousse. A multitude of garnishes accompanied the toro tartare and I loved mixing them all together to create this complex creation of flavor and texture. The oyster was topped with uni and seared foie gras, pure decadence in one bite. The oh-toro sushi was amazing. Fatty, fresh, flavorful, melted away seamlessly. The mango mousse was a refreshing finish. Topped with passion fruit and mysterious powders and garnishes (whatever, tasted delicious so I'm not going to question it), each bite was a different flavor profile. Favorite sake pairings were the plum sake that came with the oyster and Morimoto's special pumpkin sake that came with his take on the traditional surf and turf (lobster with wagyu beef and Japanese sweet potatoes, tasty but not my favorite). At first sip, the plum sake could be likened to a dessert wine, very sweet and almost syrupy. When paired with the overwhelmingly flavorful oyster, foie gras, uni combo, the sake and dish mellowed one another out. The pumpkin sake was smoky and rich, a powerful balance to the surf and turf dish. I really enjoyed the progression of the dishes. Started with the light toro tartare and the meal ended with the heavier lobster and wagyu beef. I think omakases are traditionally structured like so, from light to heavy. My brother and I thoroughly enjoyed our first omakase experience. Didn't see Morimoto (we were highly hopeful) so this gives an excuse to return!

Came here for restaurant week lunch and ordered the black cod bento box. The box came with salad, 3 tempura vegetables, 3 pieces of sushi, 3 pieces of nigiri and a small portion of the black cod. Dessert was a petite glass of green tea panna cotta with fresh blackberry and raspberry on top. Overall, the bento boxes were tasty, filling, but nothing out of the ordinary. However, we got two additional non-restaurant week desserts, and these dishes stole the spotlight. Our jaws dropped when the desserts were served. Apple bread pudding to-die-for with green tea crumble, brown sugar ice cream and fresh berries. ? Cheesecake with red wine sorbet and jam dots. The cheesecake was so light and fluffy. It was heavenly. I'd consider going back and only order desserts.

We came for the restaurant week special and we ended up eating that and everything else! We thought "oh it's just a spicy tuna roll" then when we ate it! We both looked in each other eyes with love and joy for Morimoto and wondered "Did that really just happen in my mouth?" That spicy tuna roll was THE best I've ever had. Everything we ordered from the oysters to the cocktails to the Toro sashimi made me feel so immensely, elated and excited about food (Which honestly is not classified as food. it should be called tiny gifts from God himself!) ?I just may go back and finish my degree in Culinary arts! Our servers were astounding and you can tell they take pride in their work. I have nothing but amazing things to say about the whole shebang! You HAVE to go there and give Morimoto a try. It's simply AMAZING!

I have always loved watching Morimoto's creativity and culinary skill on Iron Chef America, and going to this restaurant solidified my love for his cooking. For the afternoon I was there, I ordered a chirashi don on the recommendation of my amicable server. She told me that she's heard great feedback from the regulars who bring their Japanese business partners, and I can see why! The chirashi the restaurant serves is unlike any I've seen. Presentation-wise, the array of fresh sashimi- from the yellow tail, the mackerel, the octopus, (etc.; 10-12 different fish and vegetables) that is sprinkled with salmon roe- is uniquely cut into bite sizes and layered in a mix on a bed of perfectly cooked sushi rice. The dish was fun to look at and to eat, and I was perfectly happy with the recommendation. To drink, I ordered their Tiger's Eye cocktail (rye, ginger liquor, plum sake, and bitters). It tasted great and I definitely recommend this if any of you like the mentioned ingredients. It was very hot outside that day and this also served as an awesome refresher. Ambiance-wise, the place is sleek with a minimalistic design. Clean and simple. If I lived in nyc, hands down, I'd be a regular. :)

My good friend and food blogger (http://thenycmenugirl.com) was nice enough to bring me and a few friends here. We had an amazing time and tried almost everything on the menu. Walking in was a little confusing- the front of the restaurant has these billowing curtains, but then you walk in and the deco is very modern and sleek. One weird thing is that there is no bar area visible when you walk in, so you have to walk downstairs to the bar. I went downstairs and had a cocktail while waiting for my friends, and then we were all seated upstairs once we had all arrived. Everything we ordered was great and I highly recommend going with a group of people and sharing. We ordered the foie gras chawan mushi, black cod miso, angry chicken, the yellowtail buri bap, and five or six sushi rolls. The chawan mushi was like nothing I had had before, and it was delicious. The cod and the chicken were perfectly cooked and really flavorful. The sushi rolls were made with some of the freshest fish I've ever had. The sushi rolls are actually very inexpensive considering the quality- if you work or live in the area, I definitely recommend eating here for lunch or dinner to get your sushi fix.

I came for a friends birthday and decided to shell out some money. Dont get me wrong, I would shell out money if I thought it worth it, but I honestly thought that it could've been prepared better. In terms of the service, food, ambiance, I just wasn't impressed enough. I had the toro tartare and the chirashi bowl. The toro tartare was good enough, but the flavor mix that came with it did not really hit home. Then came the bowl, which looked amazing and was at first, until I tasted some bites that weren't the freshest......which shocked me. There was a lot of fish, but quality should come first......coming from an iron chef restaurant....... I didn't even finish the bowl, which said something....especially since I was paying for a nice meal(this never happens). The chopsticks looked cool and the bathroom toilet was bidet styled, but I really would have preferred simplistic style with quality in the food. Anyways, I guess I should be open to a second try here...but in a place like NYC....highly unlikely

We got the omakase here, and really loved the experience! The food is a mix of stables like sushi, as well as some of the more inventive dishes. The sushi was fresh and melted in your mouth, as I had expected it would. But what truly got me was how great the hot dishes were. Everything was truly spectacular. Additionally - I love the decor at this restaurant, rightbdown to the beautiful bathrooms.

Morimoto was - by far - one of the best restaurant visits I've ever had. Best splurge ever. A good friend and I trekked over to Morimoto and treated ourselves the omakase and some nice cold sake. My camera (and palette) were so overwhelmed - i a FABulous way - that it could barely contain itself. Plate after plate - tartar.. oysters.. sashimi.. palette cleaner.. grilled lobster.. prepared perfectly and just.. off the hook. We even got some face time with Iron Chef himself. The ambience was cool and sleek - with an interesting bar in the lower level. The service was very attentive but not overbearing. We were constantly entertained by the chefs as they worked; having been fortunate to have been seated at the sushi bar. They were all flawlessly skilled and visibly passionate. After the omakase, we actually continued our splurge and ordered a bunch of rolls suggested by the sushi chefs behind the bar. At the end of it all, our wallets were definitely emptier.. but it was definitely worth it; and definitely not a disappointment - Just a lot of fun. I will definitely return... after I make up enough for another great splurge.

My wife brought me here for my birthday and everything we ordered was memorable. ?My favorite of the dishes was the toro tartare. ?A close 2nd was the wagyu beef carpaccio. ?The chicken ramen was also good, the chicken was very tender and broth was salty and flavorful. ?Every dish looked elegant and refined. ?Very detailed in their work. ? The service was also on point. ?Usually when we are at a restaurant for a while we know it. ?The time flew at this place while trying all the great dishes. I was lucky and caught a glimpse of the Iron Chef in the kitchen. ?It's good to know Chef Morimoto is at his restaurant often and keeping his standards high. ? Splurge? ?Yes. ?Great experience? ?YES! ?Well worth it! Don't forget to check out the bathroom downstairs and press all the buttons!

When I planned my trip to New York, I wondered, where would I eat? What's the one place I could Yelp and drop serious cash on. I didn't have much time to deliberate the multitude of Japanese places that offered Omakase in NY, but when an old episode of Iron Chef came on, I realized the choice was easy, Morimoto was the right choice. When I called to make reservations, they were quite friendly and professional. However when it came to the discussion of Omakase I had to laugh: they offered the $125 8 course omakase and the more "specialized" 10 course for $250. Good LORD! Thats a lot of dough After a month of waiting we finally arrived here to celebrate my mom's b-day. I booked for an 8:30pm spot and was surprised to find this place PACKED with people. Then again its New York, there are people everywhere. Our waiter was nice enough to sit us to the more quiet place by the kitchen. It was a nice scene, having ?to watch everyone in the kitchen move around and prepare meals. They looked so classy and neat:) Our 8 course meal was a great experience. One of my favourites was their tuna tartare, which had several sauces for dip and even had rice crackers. I loved their surf and turf, which was lobster with wagyu beef. I was fascinated with wagyu beef and ordered their tartare on the side. It lived up to the hype of price and taste, but to be honest, a good cut of Alberta beef can serve as a good rival.Their take on the mango pudding dessert was amazing. Overall it was an pleasant experience with a staff that was very warm and accommodating. Ingenious dishes but in honesty, I wish I did my research and booked a more hole-in-the-wall Omakase experience

I came here with family so we were just able to order away, checking off everything we wanted on the menu. We got an assortment of apps, sushi, and multiple desserts. I got the New York Strip steak with a side of rice. I thought it was soo cool that they pour this juice on top of the steak while it is hot, on a stone plate as they are serving you. The steak was fabulous-- medium rare. However, my meat was sort of fatty-- I really wish they had a Filet Mignon entree for the steaks. My favorite appetizer was the foie gras oyster, and the spicy king crab legs. The other apps were okay-- the ?toro tartare with caviar and wasabi was an interesting dish that tickled my palate, ?the sushi I thought was mediocre, the lamb carpaccio was fresh and melted in your mouth.. I loved their bread pudding with whipped cream and ice cream!! Their flourless chocolate cake was good too!! I'm not sure a dinner that totaled to over $1200 (for the whole fam) was worth the money, but it was truly delicious!!

This restaurant has been on my list of places I'm dying to try after watching "The Best Thing I Ever Ate", featuring the toro tartare. My boyfriend surprised me and made reservations here on a Saturday night. At first, we had no idea where the restaurant was, and then... ?there were the red drapes! Everything was breath-taking. From the chic, trendy high ceiling decor, the $5,000 bathrooms, the lounge downstairs, the service, and of course the food! Appetizers: 1) Toro tartare (osetra caviar, sour cream, wasabi, dashi-soy) 2) Tuna pizza (olives, anchovy a?oli, jalape?o) 3) Yellowtail 'Pastrami' (togarashi, gin crème fra?che, candied olive) 4) Beef Curry Bread (panko crust) - they were all so good! The fish were fresh. Without a doubt, the Toro tartare is a must, and if you can, go for the pizza as well. Entrees: 1) Duck Duck Duck (foie gras croissant, roast duck, soft duck egg, red miso sauce): cooked so well & full of flavor. The croissant was my favorite of the three. 2) Sea Bass (sweet sake kasu, japanese eggplant, miso): definitely one of the best sea bass that I've had Dessert: Tofu hot and cold (soy milk soufflé, tofu cheesecake, maple ice cream): who would have thought tofu could be made into a dessert & taste so good? Definitely innovative & delicious Drinks: Morimoto beer pilsner: great light beer This place has made it to one of my favorite (up-scale) restaurants!

I work above Morimoto so this review is long over due. Love the food here. Great atmosphere and i don't mind eating at the bar downstairs. It's a great place to take out of town clients. the food and my favs: Apps: Tuna Pizza is my all time fav, have it every time i go and i doesn't get old Yellow Tail Pastrami - yum Crispy Rock Shrimp - while it's not my fav, everyone else loves it Beef Curry Bread - love it white fish carpaccio - is excellent Entree's:Duck Duck Duck - if you like Duck then this is your dish...i love duck Sea Bass in Miso Broth - Fish here is what i would suggest Line Caught Halibut - ditto Ishi Yaki Buri Bop - i love it when the rice is covered in some delicious sticky something...try it The sushi is outstanding and you should try as much as you can afford. Overall the place is full tourists,hedge fund guys and models. but i find myself enjoying the food every time i go. Note: years ago they had a Ginger Martini....now i'm not a martini guy but this thing was amazing....and sadly they took it off the menu because they had to infuse the vodka w ginger and it was too time consuming.they used to put this crystallized ginger candy on the rim. was so good

With a glass of Prosecco to start, the Iron Chef Morimoto does nothing but please the palate from the opening bite. We started our night having the Tuna Pizza, and I have to say that this was my favorite dish of the entire night. We also ordered the Rock Shrimp and a pastramied yellow tail. All were excellent and if you like pastrami you need to try the yellowtail this way. Four our main courses my girlfriend ordered the Duck, Duck, Duck, which is a duck served three ways, as a sanwich, roasted, and egg. The desserts here were also amazing, we had the Apple Bread Pudding and a cheesecake souffle. The service here compliments the hard work of the kitchen and gives you the neat presentation that you expect while fine dining. ?From the moment we entered the restaurant we felt our experience had a touch of class attached to it. I expected nothing less from a restaurant owned by an iron chef, but they exceeded my expectations.

My gf brought me here for my birthday and i cannot say enough nice things about it. Chef morimoto was actually there and so we ordered the $125 tasting menu that he prepares himself. ?Each and every dish was delicious, but.... if you are not that big into seafood you might find less enjoyment in the dishes. ?My favorite dishes were probably the surf and turf (lobster and australian steak) and chef's take on a salad which had this anchovy oil oil sauce that was to die for. The waiter was very nice, helpful, and knowledgeable on the menu. ?The bathroom has those japanese toilets you always hear about with all the buttons which was fun to play with. ?Think i sound silly? ?Go try it for yourself hahaha. ?The decor is very nice and the whole staff is extremely attentive. It's hard to find anything wrong with Morimoto's. ?If you can brook the price you'll find an excellent experience. ?Don't miss a chance to go... especially if Chef is there. oh yea... i forgot. ?If you're into cocktails try the orange blossom. ?It was awesome.

I've been to many restaurants, but my visit to Morimoto remains one of the best restaurant experiences I've had in my life. Design-wise, it has very few equals. It's modern, organic, and futuristic all at the same time. I'm a fan of the bottle wall, as I'm sure many people are. Also, the large space manages to pack in a lot of people but still spreads out all the tables in case you're going for a more romantic feel. You really can't go wrong with the menu, if anything you'll have a hard time just narrowing your choices down. My favorite dish, however, was the duck, duck, duck. Duck cooked three different ways, all of them delicious? Yes, yes, yes. Cocktails are made very well here and the service was top-notch. I also caught a glimpse of the Iron Chef himself as he was outside greeting a table. Make reservations, and get ready to spend, but it's worth it.

Morimoto is that interesting combination of causal and trendy. I feel just as comfortable walking in there in jeans and a t-shirt as I would in a dress on a date. The food is interesting and not your typical American Japanese restaurant. The menu has interesting, different appetizers and entrees on it. The fish is fresh and tasty, the tamago is delicious and is cut into large chunks. I like the private-ish seating when you walk in and the curtains separating tables. They have sparkling sake but don't sell it by the bottle. Things that bother me about Morimoto: 1. It's in the meatpacking district 2. It seems too trendy 3. It's pretty expensive 4. It can be hard to get a reservation Things that I like about Morimoto: 1. Intimate atmosphere 2. Comfortable in any clothes 3. really tasty food. 4. Good tamago I'll be back but only because their fish is fresh, they have sparkling sake and they have tamago.

Came here for restaurant week with the husband. The food served was average. ?Had a choice of 3 bento boxes: grilled wagyu beef, black cod and vegetarian. My husband and I ordered the beef and black cod boxes. The beef was dry and a bit tough. The black cod was good though. The cod was cooked well, the seasoning made it juicy and flavorful. The rest of the sides were average. The miso soup was ok. The salad was bland. It really needed dressing. The tempura was good. ?The sushi was fresh. The green tea panna cotta was average. Did not have a definitive green tea taste. For such an upscale restaurant, I really expected more.

Long time viewer, first time taster of any food network star. I was lucky enough to stop by here to try the cuisine of iron chef Morimoto. The moment I set foot into this restaurant, I got an ambiance of fine dining. The decor was very modern and the lighting was dim with many illuminating pastel colored lights. A total transformation from it's outside appearance. I was immediately greeted and seated (for lunch) by the hostess and attended by our waiter. He let us know of their specialties, including the restaurant week specials and answered all of our questions regarding the menu. Top notch service. I ordered the braised black cod bento box for restaurant week and my cousin the wagyu beef bento box. The food came fairly quickly as it wasn't very crowded within the restaurant. The presentation was beautiful as the food came in a gorgeous bento box set. The food looks wonderful as you can see the attention to detail they had put in it. I felt bad I was going to jab my chopsticks into it, but my appetite helped me get over it. The bento box had 5 components: a salad, tempura veggies, miso soup, regular and maki sushi, and the main dish. The salad was alright. I'm not much of a salad person so my input may be inferior to most. It was lightly dressed if at all and had some crunchy scallion garnish on top. It gave a nice texture but I felt it lacked a little something. The tempura veggies were delicious. I ate half of it before I realized there was a cheese based sauce on the bottom of the bowl. The tempura was crunchy while the veggie itself was soft yet firm. The cheese sauce was light and did not overpower the tempura veggies. Greatness. The miso soup was good. The soup tasted as miso soup should be and didn't have me reaching for my water. The freshly made tofu was delicious as well. The sushi was excellent! So fresh! It had 3 spicy tuna maki rolls, 2 snapper nigiri sushi and a salmon sushi. The maki rolls were delicious. Spicy tuna, special sauce, some scallions, nori, rice, and sesame seeds. Very simple and it works wonderfully. They put the right amount of sauce in the roll to allow the flavor of the tuna to shine along with it. The nigiri sushi was amazing! I usually stay away from this and sashimi but man does Morimoto know what he's doing. The fish was extremely fresh. A little goes a long way in terms of soy sauce and wasabi. The salmon nigiri sushi in particular had me giggling like a school girl. There was wasabi placed between the salmon sashimi and rice. It was the perfect amount. Huge amount of tongue tingle with none of the nose burn. Ecstasy stimulating both taste and touch. Last but most definitely not the least, the braised black cod. Simply stunning. Slightly sweet and salty. The cod was succulent and moist. The flavor was outstanding. It was impossible for me to wolf it down. I took that fish apart piece by piece like it was the last piece of food left on earth. Heaven. I also tried some of my cousins wagyu beef. It was pretty chewy, and dare I say dry? The seasoning didn't wow me, didn't taste much different from any other beef from an asian restaurant. Good thing I got the cod! Sorry Morimoto. I also got a surprise desert! A panna cotta using green tea, honey, and coconut with fresh berries on top. What a way to end this meal! You can taste every component of the panna cotta and the berries give that much needed tang. Not too sweet. Just perfect. Great meal, great service, great times. Thanks chef Morimoto! Wish I coulda seen you in your element and not on a TV screen. PS. Check out the restroom. No restroom experience will beat the one I had here.

Because this place is in the meatpacking area, I left it towards the bottom of my list of places to try. I thought it would just be another pretentious, expensive, average tasting restaurant in the area... I want to slap myself for making this assumption. The rock shrimp was really good, they bring two flavored types.. I did like the non-mustard one better...The ramen soup was surprising really delicious... and the sushi rolls we had were great too. I was pleased that they had eel sauce...I prefer it over soy sauce. Anyway, this place is great.

The Duck Duck Duck was Crap Crap Crap. One of the duck servings came in a croissant and, in the words of Rob Schneider, "they go together like lamb and tunafish" (ie it sucked). The seafood toban yaki had a tasty sauce but it really wasn't worth the price. Our waitress gave off a pretty 'holier than thou' attitude especially when she realized we weren't ordering drinks and only getting entrees. The place went from feeling 'trendy' to feeling snooty pretty quick after that... The inside was very nice to look at...but I can't eat a pretty ceiling.

So... I love sushi and I love Iron Chef. The place is cool, the food was pretty good but the waiters and waitresses were really snobby. \\ -- Food -- \\ 1. Tuna pizza appetizer -- not particularly great, lots of japanese mayo on it, not enough flavor. 2. Spicy Tuna roll -- good sesame seed mix on the outside, fresh and not too spicy 3. California Roll -- too much mayo overpowered the crab 4. Drinks were a little too sweet (I got the lychee martini) \\ -- Service -- \\ I hate mayo in my california roll, yet 2 people immediately dismissed the fact that there's mayo when I asked. FINALLY, someone asked the chef -- yes, there's mayo.. I hate when places disagree with customers, especially when they're right! The place is cool for a date, but for the price, I could probably find a similar place for cheaper (and with better service)

I went here with my girlfriend for a post Valentine's Day dinner. ?If you're not sure what you want here and you have people willing to spend some money, definitely go with the Omakase. ?Essentially, it's a seven-course meal encompassing the Morimoto experience. ?To go into detail would spoil it, but I highly recommend it. ?They go into detail with each course and explaining what you should do. The service here is excellent, water is always topped off, our table was even wiped down, even with nothing in sight, midway thru the omakase. ?My drink was empty, they promptly asked if I wanted another one. ?I like that, I don't want to hail down a server, you see it empty, you ask. ?The way these servers work, that's how you'll get a 20% tip from me. ?I'm usually a 15%-18% tipper, but if you bust your ass, I got you. ?Not every form service deserves it. It does get loud in here, so if you want a quieter date experience, get there early. ?I have nothing to complain about here so if you did, it was probably an off-night or you needed something to nitpick about.

The amibience is breath taking but yet simple. If you are looking for freshness, this is the spot. I have been here on several occassions. How they plate the food was simply art. The service was really good. I usually get the maki, sashimi, and tuna pizza for appetizer. Next time I would try the omakasa.

Good food, excllent decor, great service. My wife wanted to try Morimoto since we were visiting NYC. ?We showed up with 7pm resos. ?Restaurant is beautiful...from the cool downstairs bar to the intimate tables to the sushi bar...love the look of this restaurant. Best thing on the menu for me, tuna pizza...inventive, cool and interesting. ?A must-try. I love oysters, foie gras and uni, but this was my least favorite dish; somehow the three combined doesn't work well especially when served cooked...I would have preferred the oyster be raw and for the foie to be served cold on top like a foie gras terrine. ?Didn't love the Duck Duck Duck either...not bad, but so much better in classical high-end Chinese restaurants. Sushi was done in classical style, so nothing to complain about here, but it also didn't wow me. ? Overall, good experience, but I have had better sushi and Japanese food in Vancouver. Will I come back to Morimoto's...probably not, but still needed to try.

3 stars and I'm being quite generous. I love Morimoto, but I was completely underwhelmed by his entrees. We had dinner there on New Years Eve, it was packed, we were seated right away with reservations. The decor was minimalistic, very modern. Loved it. For appetizers, we had the toro tartare, it was great combined with the various condiments given, however, by itself, it didn't seem that "fresh". Who really minces toro anyway? I'm glad I tried it.. (Morimoto made something very similar to this on an Iron Chef America episode.) Does it live up to the hype? yes and no. Do I love guacamole, sour cream, those little rice crackers? yes, yes and yes. Would it taste great paired with almost anything.. YES! ?See my point? We also had the tuna pizza which was a nice surprise, all the ingredients worked beautifully. Simple, but very nicely done. The last appetizer was the kakuni which was just okay. The pork belly was stringy and it was so salty, there wasn't enough congee to dilute the amount of sweet and savory sauce that was on top. Sad to say, it was probably the worse pork belly we've ever had, and when is pork belly ever bad? During our appetizers, the lady to my left ordered the ramen soup - which is NOT a true ramen by any means, it's chicken consommé with noodles. The only reason I noticed, was the intense chicken broth smell that wafted in my direction. $15 is insane for something anyone can make at home. Our entrees were very disappointing, but I had a feeling it would before dining. Nothing really stood out to me, so I settled on the chef combination sushi, Although the fish was fresh, it lacked something.. I don't even think I was that full, but I couldn't finish it. It was somewhat bland and boring. ?I'd rather get sushi at Yasuda's. L had the Surf and Turf. It was australian wagyu so it didn't have the fat or flavor Kobe beef has. I thought it was bland, L thought it had too much pepper. Why did I suggest ordering the Duck, Duck, Duck entree after both disappointing dishes? So I didn't have to waste a second visit to taste this popular dish which receives such fantastic reviews on Yelp... Seriously?!! It was horrible, I had a bite of each component. The best part of the dish was the croissant and even that was a total let down because once paired with the duck, it was completely soft and limp. The duck leg was dry and the sauces that came with it was too overpowering. Even the slightest dab of sauce was too much. Even the worse Peking duck from a Chinese BBQ shop beats Morimoto's duck. I had three drinks, the Hydrangea, Snapdragon and an Orange Blossom. Had I been slightly intoxicated, perhaps the food would've tasted better. The drinks were good, not great. Nobu's are much better. 2 stars - Service was wonderful, especially on a busy holiday. I loved how all the staff worked together, from the busboys to the the managers. The hostesses were very friendly. 1 star - Come for the futuristic decor, lovely atmosphere and a few drinks, don't stay for dinner. This is the second Morimoto location I've dined at and probably my last. You're simply paying for the name, the food is not Iron Chef worthy. Perhaps if Morimoto changed the entire dinner menu, I'd return, but for now, it's off my list.

I decided where I was going to eat in Chelsea/Meatpacking based on a Yelp search and decided on Morimoto. This place was beyond amazing. It's true- sushi doesn't get much better. And sushi is really my favorite genre of cuisine. The presentation and experience is just awesome (I sat at the sushi bar solo, really cool, and BTW, great service, the servers know their stuff). The tuna pizza was great and I got the special sashimi (it was similar to yellowtail, can't remember exactly what but the fresh factor was off the charts). I also enjoyed the bento box style dessert. I went low key apps and dessert- didn't do a full on meal and I can't imagine what the bill would have been for a multi-course dinner. It's expensive, let there be no doubt- but, let's be honest, this is NYC and it's an Ironchef hotspot. So worth it!

Take me back! Amazing sushi. The most interesting flavor combinations that sort of had their own party in my mouth (that's what she said). But really, Morimoto lives up to it's reputation. It's all about the details at this place. From the decor, to the plating, even all the way down to the restrooms... nothing went unnoticed in the design - both architecturally and appetizing. Morimoto is one of those places that is well deserving of it's hype. Recommend it through and through.

Omg what can I say? It's probably one of the best meals I have had in a while.I really enjoyed the modern dark decor, perfect for a date night. For starter, my boyfriend and I ordered tuna tartare, which is one of their most popular dishes. For main course, he ordered duck duck duck and I got their special fish dish. Duck came out the winner as it was very plated creatively. For dessert, hot and cold tofu is the perfect light dessert of choice. The tofu souffle was the highlight. Overall, I would definitely go back.

I've been here I think 2 times before and this would now be my third. This time we decided to try the omakase. For the first course we had toro tartare. It was pretty fresh with many different side flavors. The wasabi was not too strong. The next dish was fluke carpaccio. It was fresh and flavorful but a little bit too oily. Next was a vegetable medley with anchovies white soy sauce. It was a warm sauce which actually was pretty tasty. Next we had oyster uni foie gras. I thought the oyster was a bit fishy. The sauce was good and the foie gras was fantastic however you couldn't really taste the uni though. The sushi dish was very fresh. The rice breaks apart in your mouth but keeps its shape with the fish. I liked the tuna and the red snapper. The other ones were okay. Then came intermission. It was a homemade ginger ale. It was alright. ? Now onto the main course which was surf and turf. It was cooked very nicely very tender and juicy. I loved the sauce and the bean sprouts sucked up all the juice. Yummy! For the dessert, we had Okinawa sugar purée with sweet potato. I thought it had too much alcohol in the reduction but otherwise pretty good. After the several times that I've been here, I believe that Morimoto is overpriced for their food. You can definitely get similar quality Japanese at other places for lower cost. I don't think I'd be back for a fourth, 3's good for me.

I had made reservations here on a Saturday night for a very special lady. As soon as we entered this upscale establishment, the ambience was absolutely ravishing. From the lighting, to the decor, to the service...everything was wonderfully put in attention to detail. We ordered a bottle of Morimoto Light Beer. I'm nothing close to a beer connossieur, but I highly recommend this beer for anyone planning to start the night here. Great beer, similar to that of a high end "Blue Moon." The selection of foods was more than scrumptious. As appetizers, we ordered: 1) Toro Tartare - Amazing in every sense of the word, loved the four different types sauces that came as complements...with the avocado being my favorite. 2) Tuna PIzza - Surprisingly very tasty! Who would have thought tuna could be put so well together as a pizza? Well, Morimoto definitely has that figured out! 3) Yellowtail Pastrami - My girlfriend's favorite type of sushi, and going to Katz Deli a day prior definitely put us in the mood for the sushi/cold cut combo. Absolutely delish. 4) Beef Curry Bread - Definitely did not disappoint, came out as the last appetizer and a great way to finish off our apps!...the sauce inside this bread was melt in your mouth. At this point, we were not yet full, but definitely getting there. As entrees we had ordered: Sea Bass - So tasty and the fish was divine. It came in a miso, as wel as with a Japanese eggplant. Cooked to perfection. Duck Duck Duck - One of our favorite dishes of the night. The duck was perfectly seasoned, and as tender as it could be. We enjoyed the croissant the most. For Dessert: Tofu Hot and Cold - The second we looked at this in the menu, it was a no brainer selection. Had never seen such an interesting/unique dessert before, and fulfilled our expectations! We enjoyed every single bite of it, and was the hot topic of the night afterwards :) One of the best high end restaurants that I have been to, and have been lucky to take my special lady out on.

IRON CHEF, Morimoto!!!! This is why I moved to New York. ?Home to some of the most fabulous restaurants in the world! ?Morimoto is a feast of all your senses. ? This place is design perfection. ?The moment you duck under the blowing red fabric hanging outside through the glass automatic doors, you know that you've stepped into excellence. ? Beautiful modern white textured interior with hints of Japanese artistry and composition. ?The decor here is breathtaking. ?Downstairs is a beautiful bar, as I walked down the concrete steps, it looks like the bar top and stools are carved out of crystal and ice. ?I am in love.... The food is as beautiful as the decor. ?Flawless artistic presentation. ? If you want to get a taste of the decor, check out the website. ?Cool down tempo music with an interactive view of the interior of the restaurant. ? Morimoto, you truly deserve your reputation as Iron Chef. ? WHAT WE ORDERED: Oyster Foie Gras Toro Tartar Spicy Crab Hamachi Fried Rice Miso Cod Bok Choy

I love watching Morimoto on Iron Chef and it's obvious that this is his restaurant. That being said, I was disappointed. The famed toro tartare was good and unique, as was the tuna pizza, which I preferred to the toro tartare. It's tuna sashimi spread out over a very very thin tortilla with onions, jalapenos, eel sauce, anchovy aoli, and greens on top. Very good. The white fish carpacchio was alright. The sushi and cut rolls were meh. In fact, I've had better a number of other places. I realize that there's only so much you can do with an eel avocado or spicy tuna roll but I expect more when I'm here. Service is fantastic. A good experience, but won't return. I could go without the toilet seat warmers and automatic raising toilet lid seats for better food. All those things are unnecessary bells and whistles.

First of all, I've been a fan of the original series of Iron Chef since 1997. ?Additionally, I've enjoyed my meals at Chef Morimoto's restaurant in Philly, so I have been looking forward to this experience. However, much to my disappointment, while the interior is hip & cool, I find the sushi was over priced & uninspiring. For 11 pieces of sushi (2x scallops, 2x king crab, 2x uni, 2x anagi, 2x otoro, 1x wagyu), it was $123. ?Granted that the fish was very fresh, but if you consider that for the same price at Sushi Yasuda, I'd have already had 20-25 pieces of good sushi & be full. In comparison, my server informed me that the $120 sushi or sashimi box comes with only 10 pieces/kinds of fish. ?So $12 per piece. Since I wasn't full at that point, I got the chopped toro roll and California roll (with real snow crab). ?While the chopped toro roll was rich & flavorful, the California roll was a disappointment. ?That's because the chef used too much mayonnaise, which masked the sweetness of the snow crab. ?To me, it's for someone who's a novice & uninitiated to the art of sushi. I believe that a bowl of rice & miso soup will cost extra ($6?). In summary, my dinner was over priced and lacked sophistication. That being said, I certainly wouldn't mind come back again to grab a few drinks & sit on one of those hands free toilets.

Understand two things: 1) I have an abiding affection and respect for Iron Chef Morimoto 2) My Manhattan dining experience is very limited ... but my fine dining experience overall is not. Setting aside my personal bias, I feel I can still say Morimoto is a seafood fantasia. The champion of the evening was the chirashi. Imagine a giant bowl of Korean bibimbap, except with fish in place of nearly all of the vegetables. It's an enormous bowl of sticky sushi rice with sweet sauce, black sesame and "10-12 different fish and vegetables." Octopus, my mortal enemy, became my sweet and chewy friend. The zen sai was also an adventure -- five different "Japanese antipasti," including a salty, fried whole mackrel that required a momentary suspension of my spoiled, suburban, 5-year-old self to down whole. The other half of me that loves salty fish won that battle. The smoky bamboo shoots were a complete surprise. The wagyu beef carpaccio was tangy perfection. To top it all off, we sampled half of the cocktail menu, and all were unique, strong, and tasty. For the indecisive, I recommend the sake flight. You might not like one of the three, but you will not be disappointed. Our server was extremely friendly and attentive, and was very knowledgeable about not just the menu, but the food, its history, and the menu concept. On a busy Friday night, everyone onhand had some kind of interaction with our table to ensure we were welcome, whether it be to seat us, keep our glasses full, or clear our plates. Overall, the value-for-dollar in this beautiful location with this expertly-prepared fresh food satisfied not only our tummies, but our wallets, too. Manhattan has so much left for me to explore, but I will have a hard time justifying not coming back to Morimoto every time I visit Manhattan as a delightful standby.

If you look at my past reviews, you will see that I've already been to the Philly one (the original, by the way) and loved it. Based on that, I had high expectations for Morimoto NYC, and it did not disappoint. Walking in, I immediately noticed that this one is bigger than the one in Philly, however, I was more impressed with the decor of the Philly one. As we entered, my fiance grabbed my arm and frantically yelled, "its him!". I had not idea what she was talking about, and just assumed she meant one of the friends we were meeting there (to which here reaction would have been quite odd), when low and behold, there stood Chef Morimoto himself! By the time I realized it was him, he was already walking away, and my fiance was to star-struck to say anything, but this is not the end of that story... We came here to celebrate a friends birthday, and had a rather large party. We were all seated downstairs, which was more of the bar/lounge area of the place. One thing that ticked me off a little was the chairs we got...we were seated an elevated "bar" like table, and the chairs had almost NO back support to them. This made things a little uncomfortable at first, but as the night went on we all got used to it. For dinner I ordered the "Duck, Duck, Duck", which is a medley of duck cooked three different ways. One version was actually a duck egg cooked easy over, another was a delicious and crispy roast duck, and finally, a sort of duck liver sandwich served on this butter soft croissant. Each version had its own accompanying sauce, but for the most part none was needed because everything was so good (especially the roast duck)! Once we told our friend Morimoto was actually there, she of course had to meet him. We told the waiter it was her birthday, and so he was able to convince the Iron Chef to come say hello and wish her a happy birthday (which was a bit awkward because he speaks almost no English but still really cool). We even got to take some pictures with him! To top of the evening, the birthday girl's fiance had specially ordered an amazing chocolate cake, of which I devoured my slice in about 0.5 seconds!

This place is so romantic. ?I'm pretty sure I realized I was in love for the first time over some angry chicken , spider rolls and gyoza. I'm sure the servers knew it it too because they kept my champagne topped off. I visited on the first snow of Winter 2010 after watching almost every episode of Iron Chef America. It was a dream come true! Honestly, what is to review of Morimotos? The precision itself is an art and flavors just explode in your mouth. ? Try the Morimoto's beer . It's brewed in house. This is a NY must.

I came here for restaurant week.. their menu for restaurant week was the bento boxes. My fiance got the beef bento box and I got the black cod bento box. The box consists of 3 pieces of sushi, 3 pieces of tuna roll, miso soup, a salad, veggie tempura with some gooey warm delicious cheese dip, and the entree, and a dessert. The entree was one strip of marinated sesamed beef about 6 inches, and mine was about 3 inches long. Though the entree was small, i nibbled on it to savour the taste. It was so yummy!! No rice came with my fish so I ate the sushi rice separately. The raw fish was extremely fresh, the freshest that I've ever had so far. It was so soft, it just melted in my mouth. Also, it was very shiny and brightly colored. We also got the infamous tuna tartare. It looked bigger in the pictures I've googled. But it was definitely worth the price and size. Because i took tiny tiny bites yet again to savour the tuna and the 6 dippings. I dipped my tuna in all 6 of the dippings. SUPER!!! Also got the beef curry bread. Its just 2 fried japanese bread things. For the price i thought it was not worth it, but my fiance LOVED it so I guess it was worth it. I'm not into fried foods. LOVED THE BATHROOM! I was enjoying the beautiful bathroom til someone took a dump and I had to leave so I could continue living. Quick TIP, bring spray to combat the stink so you can continue enjoying the scenary

My sister took me here this past weekend b/c I've always wanted to try a Morimoto restaurant. Living in SF we have great places to eat, but I had a slight fascination with the iron chef aspect of this place. The food is really tasty- some items more fantastic than others. I really wanted to be impressed with the ahi in the stone bowl- but it ended up being overcooked ahi that wasn't rare at all. The hits of the night were definitely the cocktails / the rock shrimp and the tuna pizza. Glad I got to try it!

I am going to make a big statement and one that I don't make lightly. Morimoto is probably my favorite restaurant in all of New York City! Let that settle in for a second. The restaurant is aesthetically beautiful; I love all the white and glass look. Feels very modern. The wait staff is knowledgeable and friendly as well. What also stood out was that the portions were normal sizes unlike a lot of fancy Japanese restaurants I've been to where the flavors are good, but you leave hungry. My best friend was visiting from DC, and we decided to go on a whim with a 10PM reservation on a Sunday. The place still felt happening. The food was fantastic, the perfect blend of east meets west. We ordered several appetizers to share and our own entrees. The oyster foie gras and dobin mushi were two amazing highlights for me. Now I have to go back and do the "morimoto omakase" aka chef's tasting menu, hopefully with a boyfriend. Go to Morimoto, you won't be sorry! ~A

My boyfriend surprised me on my birthday by taking me here. I've always wanted to go. We've walked by it several times, and are left with the mystery of what it's like inside. We walked in and were greeted by a very friendly hostess, who checked our coats. We were brought to our table, as the hostess walked away she wished me a "Happy Birthday." We had a view of the entire restaurant. I sat facing the sushi bar, where you can see most part of the kitchen. First off, my boyfriend and I have gone to tons and tons of sushi restaurants. Yet, we only have a handful that we keep on the roster. I guess we could be considered "sushi snobs." Our waitress came right over to us, asking which water we preferred. She was very nice, and totally patient, when we took a few minutes deciding what to drink. We each got a glass of wine. And started to plan out the food. This is what we ordered: Toro Tartare- Definitely must try if you come here! The presentation is awesome, and so vibrant. The toro is extremely fresh tasting, and the rows of add-on's make it fun to eat. I also was a big fan of whatever kind of sauce came with it. Bay Scallop Special- Not sure what they called this, it was one of the specials. We didn't realize that she had said bay scallops, which we usually don't like. However, these were delicious. They were in a brown butter sauce with shaved beet and carrot. ?Decent portion, and enjoyable :) Green Salad- We asked to split this one, after the waitress informed us that it was huge. She was right, for $10 you get a very large salad. It was simple micro greens, with a tasty dressing. Salmon Avocado Roll: We got this as an appetizer along with an order of salmon sashimi. Seriously, the simplest roll but SO GOOD. The freshness of the salmon is unbelievable, the roll was plump and melt in your mouth. I want one right now just thinking about it. My boyfriend got the "Duck, Duck, Duck" which he generously let me sample each of the components. The duck sandwich was probably my favorite of them all. The sauces that came with it were really great and complimented the entree. The duck was perfectly cooked. I got the "Chef's Combination Sushi" it is 10 pieces of sushi and one roll. I told the waitress that I don't like eel and I lean more towards salmon and tuna. That was no problem at all. I had a selection of salmon, tuna, toro, fluke, etc. as well as an egg custard. I had never tried that before, and I loved it! The roll was spicy salmon (perfect!). I literally enjoyed every piece, nothing tasted off. I loved how they put a tiny amount of wasabi on each piece as well. By the way edamame is not on the menu, but they have it...we ordered it with our meals. When it came to dessert, they really did it up for my birthday. My boyfriend told them when he made the reservation. I ordered the flour less chocolate cake, and he got the bread pudding. Both were beautifully presented and the perfect ending to the PERFECT experience. They put a candle on my plate as well as chocolates that said "Happy Birthday." ? I can't wait to return. Thank You Morimoto!

I took my boyfriend to Morimoto for his birthday and we were absolutely enchanted. Ambiance ... Easy 5! I loved Morimoto! The food was divine & the service was impeccable! There are so many choices on the menu that it's difficult to decide. Just be ready to shell out the $$$ but it's definitely worth it! Also make reservations ..

Simply amazing. Fabulous, trendy, upscale, unique atmosphere/facility coupled with absolutely delicious food. We had a wonderful evening enjoying cocktails, people watching, innovative cuisine. Highly recommend for dates, solo dinner at the bar, or special occasion big group venue.

I would probably give this place 4.5 stars overall, but 5 stars for the ambiance and service. ?I have to say this place was better than the one in Napa, more selections. ?Ended up ordering the $145 sashimi combination and it was well worth it. The fishes were all fresh nothing too exotic though. OMG the darn UNI was super super good, but expensive $9 each. The oysters were so delicious and so was the toro tartare especially with all the sauces. We also ordered many things and overall very good. I just have to say, it was pretty darn pricey but great experience. We got to meet Mr. Morimoto himself :-).

It's a little bit pricier, but you have to try it at least once... or twice or thrice because you'll never want to eat anything else ever again. Try the OMAKASE and sit back and enjoy the best of what Morimoto has to offer. ?It was about 7 or 8 courses long and beautifully presented. ?With every bite I took I felt like Andrew Zimmern looking at the camera wide eyed after he eats something absolutely delicious. I can't remember the exact name of the drink, something white lily with calpico, but it was probably the best drink I've ever had in my life.

This is it. We tried omasaki 7-course tasting menu -- the art of Japanese design philosophy is fully reflected from their food. Check out the pictures of those surreal appearance of food. If you couldn't appreciate them, all I can say is that you might not be an artist by heart. What's above and beyond is the fusion with French cuisine: fondue with veggies and sausages, oyster foie gras and uni... Interior decor of Morimoto is futuristic. The lighting fixtures are particularly excellent, but details matter, right? As a a customer and outsider, I hope Morimoto could improve the seating arrangement, as well as lots of details in the decoration, such as brightness in certain area of the dining seating area, and the ugly table counter in women's bathroom. Morimoto is a worthwhile experience. Thanks for delivering happiness to customers.

My boyfriend took my here for my birthday dinner because he knows I'm obsessed with Food Network, Iron Chef, and Chef Morimoto. Loved every single thing we ate here. We were recommeded to get the omakase but didn't because we wanted to pick our own dishes. Like everyone else says- TORO TARTARE is an absolute must. The flavors and textures were unbelivable and I'd be glad to eat that dish every day if I could. We also had the oysters with foie gras and uni (YUM) and crispy rock shrimp tempura (more YUM). For entree we shared Sea Bass with japanese eggplant, and a soft shell crab roll. For dessert we had something from the special menu, doughnuts with ice cream and tapioca balls. I was honestly too full to enjoy it, but it was tasty. Morimoto lives up to the hype. The decor is gorgeous, oh and the bathroom is the coolest!!!!! Even if you don't have to use the bathroom.. go check it out anyway lol. I'd LOVE to come back here (still want to try the Tuna pizza!!)

Great service and good food!! As a vegetarian, there weren't a ton of options, but I can't complain as this is a sushi place. My friend, who eats fish, LOVED his dish. The drinks were good too! Could definitely come back in the future, though I like the ambience of the Philly location better (designed by the great Karim Rashid).

Frequent visitor, first time reviewer here. I love love love love love Morimoto's. Food is divine, fish is incredibly fresh and in the grand scheme of things it is a great value for your money. Some of my favorite dishes here include: 1) toro tartate - comes on a board with fixings on the side including wasabi, caviar, sour cream, crunchies etc. It is melt in your mouth amazing and I crave it often. 2) tuna pizza - my absolute favorite! it is thinly sliced tuna on top of a toasted tortilla topped with spicy mayo and jalapenos. Such a simple dish but it hits the spot every time. 3) Rock shrimp tempora - comes in two dishes with about 15-20 shrimp each (decent size) and it has two flavors: buffalo and wasabi. I prefer the buffalo... its a matter of taste really but the shrimp is fresh and perfectly crisped in the tempora batter.... yum! 4) Sushi - again... fish is amazingly fresh. They serve classic, no frills rolls but they taste way better than your regular tuna roll. My favorite is the king crab and avocado roll. Their roll prices are incredibly low most range in the $7-12 per roll. I think that for the quality of fish this is an incredible steal. ? Overall... this is one of my favorite go to places for a night out. Romantic enough for a date, swanky enough for a night with the girls, casual enough for a quick dinner when you have a bad day.

I'm originally from L.A., and when most children were learning to distinguish a blue crayon from a red crayon, I'd learned to distinguish a real nose from a nose job. Morimoto went under the knife, and at first glance, it's perfect. But if you keep looking, you'll realize there's something fishy. That's Morimoto's Toro Tartare. Fishy. And the Oyster Foie Gras? Fishy fishy. Not to mention the Fatty Tuna Sushi, with the price listed at MP or $10! per! piece?! Fishy! Fishy! Fishy! If I were to name the most overrated restaurant in NYC, my answer would begin with a M and end with an O.

Oh Morimoto, we meet again. No matter how I feel, Morimoto is always a good idea for dinner. First of all, it's in an amazing location. Right next to the High Line, you can take a stroll before/after dinner, ?get a nice view of the water, and a not so nice view of New Jersey. The restaurant itself isn't designed like a run of the mill Japanese restaurant. From its red drapery outside the door to the water bottle wall, this place has character. Before dinner, you know for a fact that you want to take a trip to the bar downstairs. The prices are pretty standard for a restaurant bar, unless you want to try all the crazy Japanese beers that they also carry. I forgot which one I ordered, but it ended up being a whopping $28. As far as dinner goes, I've tried the omakase. At $125 a person, it's really not a bad idea, but if you're a frequent diner, then go order ala-carte. As far as what you absolutely HAVE to get, the toro tartare is at the top of the list. At $31, it is one of the pricier appetizers, but damn it's worth it. With sides of caviar, sour cream, wasabi, and dash, this dish is legit. The other dishes that are awesome are: - Whitefish Carpaccio ($16) - Oyster Foie Gras ($21) - Kakuni ($16) - Ramen Soup ($15) - Duck Duck Duck ($32) Like I said, you can't go wrong with Morimoto. Solid service, food, ambiance, and overall great experience. Just be prepared to drop some dough.

Came here for our anniversary and loved it. ?The ambiance is absolutely amazing and you can feel it right when you walk in. ?The staff was perfect from the get-go. ?First walking in they quickly found our reservation and brought us to our table, where they took out coats to check for us; which is free, just don't forget to tip. We were quickly greeted by our server who let us know the specials and items on the menu that are favorites. ?We both ordered a cooked entree and a side of sushi, just so we can try a bit of everything. ?*A little note: If you are not a fan of wasabi, be sure to tell your server ahead of time, as they do put wasabi ON the rice when making your sushi order.* We loved EVERYTHING that we ordered and were just taken back at how grand the place itself looked. ?Even the bathrooms were soothing and classy. ?The place is on the pricey end, but you do receive all that you pay for. ? I love this place and can't wait to go back again, and again, and again. ^_^!

LOVE IT! Took my bf here for this amazing birthday dinner. Walked in, went down stairs to the bar to have a drink before our table was ready, which took about 15 mins. Staircase and the entire ambiance of the place was absolutely amazing. After we sat down at our table, our waiter Freddy(best waiter ever) recommended the tasting menu since it was our first time and a bottle of sake. Great recommendation on the sake it was very good for only 90 dollars. I was expecting to spend at least 150. Tasting menu is absolutely amazing, esp our main course of surf and turf and our dessert. Get this if this is your first time. Our entire dinner took about 3 hours, loved every bit of it. great company, great time, probably one of the best eating experiences I have had. Service was just amazing. TIP WELL GUYS! OUr dinner came out to be about 380, plus a generous tip of 100, SO i guess expect 200+ a person. Ohh and the restroom.. hahaha is as good as everyone says it is... I swear i pushed every button on that toilet hahaha and its beautiful as well.

Stop #2 for Restaurant Week 2012, and my dining partner says: Wagyu Beef Bento for Linny, and Blackened Cod Bento for the Drew. Each bento came with miso soup, three pieces of tuna sushi roll, three assorted sashimi on rice (salmon, tuna, yellowtail), 3 tempura (one potato/tuber and two mini asparagus spears), and salad greens with dried garlic and light oil/vinegar dressing. Accompanying this meal for refreshments (extra $), Virgin White Lily for Linny, and Morimoto Iced Tea for myself. It wouldn't be a visit to Morimoto without sampling some more sushi so we also split a spicy salmon roll with the meal. I do not know what the hype about Wagyu beef is, but it is supposedly so high bred and expensive that they could only afford a .33 oz slice per bento. It was definitely better than regular hibachi meat, but I felt the Kobe steak was more flavorful and filling. The blackened cod was really the one that stole the show. Soft and tender, the cod was saturated in teriyaki sauce, but it didn't over power the flavor of the fish. The sashimi was beyond fresh, and each piece was masterfully cut and served with the perfect portion of white rice underneath. Likewise, the tuna roll pieces and the spicy salmon roll was exceptional, with the sushi focusing on the subtle flavors of the fish itself, rather than smothering it in spicy mayo or filler. Miso soup and greens were almost standard fare, with the only difference being the gigantically generous chunk of tofu in the miso. Overall, a good experience, and one that opened my eyes (tastebuds really) to what real sushi/sashimi is about. TL;DR Morimoto amazing sushi, good other stuff...

I was soo happy i got to try Morimoto's, been a huge fan of him ever since the original Iron Chef series, when they had to subtitle everything since it was in japanese!!! Morimotos was at Chelsesa near the meatpacking district, the section of New York is very posh and hip. When i walk into the restaurant my first thought was "they serve raw fish here, this is a sushi joint?" Morimotos does not look anything like a high end Japanese restaurant but rather more like hip lounge. after studying the menu for quite some time, we decided the most interesting items are the cooked dishes so we mainly those..Overall, A great dining experience: Toro tartare - great presentation, loooks fun to eat, i think its one of the house favorites Spicy king crab legs - loved the spicy kick to the crab...they semi open up the shells so its not hard work to get to the meat...=) Oyster foie gras- one of my favorite dishes of the night, it had oyster, uni, and a piece of foie gras to it...all the flavors work well together, super rich, and if i had more money i'd order a dozen of these.. Duck duck duck - The duck was least impressive but still good if it wasn't 32.00...it was a crossiant w/ duck breast, and then the duck leg, and i think it was duck egg??...dont really remember the 3rd preparation Sushi combo- we got the 40.00 mixer combo...the fish was fresh, not too much to really critique.. Tofu two ways dessert- the tofu two way was tofu cheesecake and tofu souffle, the cheesecake part was better. I had different expectations coming to this restaurant since i see Morimoto compete with bold flavors and super unique dishes, i was hoping to see soem of those items on the menu...like if he wins a competition, shouldnt that dish be at least a monthly special on the menu???? jes suggesting!!!!

My girlfriend and I came here for our anniversary. We ordered the Japanese Lobster fritters and the House Smoked Salmon Ravioli for our appetizers. Then we had the surf and turf, which was phenomenal, especially the steak which was prepared perfectly and made with an outstanding seasoning, as well as the 40 dollar Chef's Sushi and Sashimi combination. Although the steak was delicious, the portion size was small. The sushi tasted amazingly fresh. Then we tried the "Iron Chef" ramen, which was basically just standard chicken noodle soup, which I thought was funny because you would assume a dish with Iron Chef included in the title would be thoroughly impressive, but regardless, it was certainly enjoyable. For desert, we ordered the apple bread ?and warm flourless chocolate cake. They were both quite filling, and very tasty. Everything was brought out swiftly and was decoratively prepared. The only disappointing part of our experience here was that our waiter was extremely condescending. Aside from the waiter, who for some reason we gave a reasonable tip, the experience was outstanding.

All I can say is that service is GREAT! ? I organized a dining event in their semi private room and everyone enjoyed it! ?What I liked about their service was that they were very friendly, helpful, and communicative. ? I dined at the sushi bar and the hotel manager and all the staff was aware that I was tied to this event and they were proactive in keeping me in the loop of their event. ?Everyone was very professional. ? I received very positive feedback on the food. ?I, myself had a positive experience as well. ?The sushi bar chefs were extremely busy so not a lot of dialogue like your typical sushi bar experience. ?Although they were receptive to my questions. ?I only ordered sushi and it was all very fresh. ?My favorites were the chu-toro, oh-toro, sake (salmon), and mirugai. ?I had the uni but I've had fresher...so slightly disappointing but that's ok. ? It's definitely worth asking what's fresh and if there's a catch of the day. ? Decor is fun and the restaurant was packed and lively. ?This location has a totally different look & feel that the location in Napa - so definitely unique! ?Prices aren't cheap so be prepared to splurge.

I was a fan of Iron Chef ever since.... I don't know when. I was so excited to have the chance to visit Iron Chef Morimoto's restaurant when I was in NYC. The restaurant was very trendy and the decoration & the lighting were absolutely ravishing. A special mention to the restroom - sakura themed + great use of mirror, lighting and color = like a piece of installation artwork you see in MoMA. We had the seven course tasting menu (aka "Omakase"), and we thoroughly enjoyed every course of the meal. Each course was prepared with freshest ingredient, very flavorful and very pleasing to the eyes. Our favorites are Fluke Carpaccio with Vinaigrette Dressing and Mushroom, Vegetable Medley with Anchovies White Soy Sauce and Oyster with Uni and Foei Gras. Our least favorite was the Sushi - It was pretty average, both the ingredient and the way of preparation were pretty ordinary. Just not something you would have expect from a world-renown Iron Chef I guess. Only one thing we didn't like about the restaurant was the portion of food - either we had really big appetite or the portion was simply tooooooooo small. My husband was able to feed himself a big hot dog after the meal :(

My girlfriend and I came here for a Saturday dinner. ?We didn't do the $125/pp omakase, instead elected to do the a la carte. We ordered appetizers, the toro tartare, wagyu beef carpaccio and smoked salmon ravioli. ?The toro tartare was strange to eat but didn't blow us away. The wagyu beef was so so. ?We like smoked salmon but the ravioli was just plain weird. We ordered the black cod and the sea bass along with an order of bok choy. ?Overall the entrees were much more satisfying than the appetizers. Didn't order the sushi so can't comment. Overall, we had higher expectations so it was a little disappointing. ?The service was great though. ?Very dark where we were seated so it was tough to take pictures without a flash.

Yes, it was probably worth 4 stars but... I had high expectations. I lived in Philly and I have been to the Philly one 4 or 5 times and I absolutely loved it. This one... it was ok. The decor (very trendy and I have to admit quite cool) and ?acoustic (it is impossible to talk in Philly) is much better than the philly one but... the food is not. I would have to try again but I felt like there are much better high end Japanese options in the City.

It was okay. If I returned, I would skip the ordinary sushi and go for some of the more unusual and creative dishes only. We sat down for Restaurant Week, and the server immediately told us, "the things on the Restaurant Week menu really aren't our best. You should come back sometime and order a la carte." Really? I hadn't even received my $8.00 hot tea yet. But she was just trying to help; she was completely correct: Silken tofu miso soup: Tasty with atypical flavors. Salad: Excellent, with crisped onion flakes on top. Best bento salad I've had. Tempura: Decent, nothing special. The batter didn't have a whole lot of flavor. Tuna pizza: Outstanding. Highly recommend. Curry Pan (friend bread with japanese curry inside): Outstanding. I hear Morimoto has this dish when he dines here, and I can see why. Nigiri: Not special. Tuna, yellowtail, and salmon. It would have been great to see something a little different than the usual fare. Yellowtail Maki: Pretty tasty, and it was nice to have something we don't see every day. Wagyu beef: Excellent. Perhaps a little well done, but very tender. Tamago: Awful. I hate sending dishes back, but I've had better tamago at AYCE sushi bars. Toasted green tea: Outstanding, but at eight dollars a little silly. If they included this with the meal it would be a very nice touch.

The best eating experience that I have ever had. I came here for my first anniversary dinner with my boyfriend. ?The decor is white, clean, futuristic, and modern. ?Loved it - though, I got hit by those flapping curtains on the way into the restaurant. ? Plus, interestingly, the bathroom had sliding doors - so I was actually trying to pull the door out, until I saw someone slide it open from the men's side. Our waitress told us about the tasting menu, but we opted to be adventurous and pick menu items on our own. ? Our first appetizer was the toro tartare - everyone knows this is the most amazing tasting tuna ever. ?I was definitely impressed with the presentation - it came in a little board with little "sauces" that you dip the tartare in. ?I liked trying all the flavors - it's so amazing how much taste a little bit of seasoning or sauce can pack. Our next appetizer was the rock shrimp in different sauces. ?That was really good too. ?The rock shrimp was crispy on the outside, despite all the sauces covering it. I ordered a seabass for my entree and it was the best seabass ever. ?It was cooked perfectly over a bed of vegetables. The seabass literally melted in my mouth. ?The vegetables weren't soggy at all. ?My boyfriend had the rice in the stone pot with yellowtail (forgot the name of the dish), but it was so fun! ?A waiter came over and made the dish right in front of us! ? Everything was so delicious. ? Next, we had sushi - but I felt this was not as great as the entree or appetizer. ? Our dessert was the flourless chocolate cake. ? I felt the cake was satisfying to end the meal. ?We also ordered a rose wine to finish. ? I had such a wonderful experience at Morimoto. ?All the food was on par and the service was attentive.

Morimoto is quite good! I thought it would be a little hyped up by Iron Chef fans...but this restaurant delivered! The toro tartare was pleasing and interesting with the 6 different dipping sauces. The tuna pizza exceeded my expectations! The "pizza" was light and crisp and the tuna accompanied it very nicely. I felt like the appetizers really stole the meal. The entree's were more or less unexciting in comparison. The duck, duck, duck entree is recommended- just because they serve the duck three ways. I had the yellowfin tuna in hot stone bowl- it was ok. It was a one-dimensional entree and bland. I would still come back but just make a meal out of appetizers next time or try the omakase!

Good Japanese food at a pretty high price. I had the tuna tartar, black cod, and the Crispy Rock Shrimp Tempura. All highly delicious. Loved the service, decor and presentation. All the meals were presented in an interesting, intricate and thoughtful manner. ?My friend had saki while we were there and that too was beautifully presented. ?It was an amazing visual experience if nothing else. ?The place had the skeleton of a typical japanese restaurant but had chic touches everywhere.

Tasting menu was delicious. Everything satisfied all five senses -- My favorite was perhaps the toro tartare. It came with five additions, including an osetra caviar and a nori paste.. so delicious! A close second was probably the kumamoto oysters with fois gras and uni. I would have given the restaurant 5 stars if it wasn't so pricey! However, I did return, so I would definitely say it is worth it.

By far my favorite restaurant in the city. If the breathtaking interior doesn't wow you, the food will. But be creative when ordering--Japanese food isn't all about sushi! The Crispy Rock Shrimp Tempura is exactly how it sounds, and the taste is varied through multiple sauces. While I typically go for anything with cod, I wholly recommend the Duck, Duck, Duck. Foie gras croissant with soft duck egg isn't something you come across everyday. Afterwards, just sit back and admire the decor. Even the bathroom is decked out with an infinite mirror. Just saying.

I've eaten here several times since I've moved to NYC but never written a review... Nice place, quality ingredients and fresh ideas. I LOVE the oysters with uni and foie gras... 3 of my faves in one bite. It's honestly the only reason I keep going back. That and the curried king crab legs... The duck three ways is a great idea but didn't hit home the way I wanted and the hamachi tartar is always fun. Scene is ok, probably a bit stale by now but still a destination and a pretty solid dinner.

When I made reservations for Morimoto, the hostess rather sheepishly said that the only space left for two was at the sushi bar. ?Would I be ok with that arrangement? ?She made it sound like it was where second-class citizens sit. ?I was adamant about trying this place out, so I took it. ? It turns out, my girlfriend and I got the best seat in the house. ?Not only did we get to enjoy the finest that an iron chef has to offer, but we got to eat it while watching the sushi chef make some amazing sushi arrangements right before our eyes. ?I didn't even know people had such fine motor skills to handle a knife blade with that level of precision. ?Deadly fish assassins. There is one drawback for a date at the sushi bar: ?the seats are welded tight to the floor, meaning I couldn't slide my chair closer to my girlfriend. ?I spent most of the night with half my buttocks hanging over thin air so I could be close to her. ?As one of my friends likes to say: ?"worth it." ? Much has already been said about the food we ate: ?rock shrimp appetizer, the sea bass (absolutely delightful- even my gf raved about it, and she isn't a fan of fish), the roasted trout (which looked and tasted suspiciously like salmon), the tofu "hot and cold" dessert. ?And much has already been said about the ambiance and interior decorating of this place. ?I heartily agree. ?It's a special place, serving one of a kind high end cuisine. ?A perfect place to spend with that special someone.

Here's how you can beat an iron chef restaurant in New York: go to Iron Chef Michiba's restaurant in Tokyo (in Ginza, called "Michiba")...by far the best and most memorable Japanese dinner I've ever had. When Chef Morimoto first opened his first restaurant in Philadelphia, I'd make special trips down there because even though the sushi was just OK, other dishes were just so good and so inventive and unusual. ?Now, even though I live only 1/2 block away from his place in New York, I almost never go... Not unless I have friends from out of town who insist on it, which is what happened recently. The problem here is just that it's getting kinda old. ?There's a production-line quality about it. ?It's like seeing "Phantom" on Broadway or something...yeah, it's a good show, but it's been running for so many years you get the feeling that everybody involved with it is G-E-T-T-I-N-G S-O T-I-R-E-D. ?The best thing we had was the DIY tofu (especially when the waiter flattered us by saying we were one of the few guests who actually made it correctly...)

Winter 2012 Restaurant Week finally rolled around and I wanted to take Morimoto for a spin. I was perplexed as to why they didn't publicize its lunch menu as it did last year but I learned the hard truth when I walked in for lunch today. It seemed like they always had a prix fixe lunch menu since it was already preprinted onto the front page of its regular lunch menu. This doubled as their restaurant week menu which are three bento box options: 1 - Wagyu Beef 2 - Black Cod 3 - Vegetarian Bento Box Each of the bento boxes come with tofu miso soup, 3 pieces of tempura with a layer of Gonzalo cheese dipping on the bottom, a bowl of mixed green salad, 3 pieces of spicy tuna taken from a Makizushi type of sushi roll, 3 pieces of nigiri (White tuna, tuna, and I can't remember the last piece but I think it was salmon) and then a bowl of the above mentioned entree of your choice. I do wish the cheese dipping came separate from the tempura because it just wasn't expected from the Japanese vibe on the bento box. I also wasn't much of a fan of it and tried to wipe the dipping sauce off my tempura before consuming it. The actual entree portion for the wagyu beef was actually just a few slices (like 3) but the bowl of cod had a good number of pieces (like 8) No one in my party got the vegetarian option. In hindsight, I shouldn't have been attracted by the celebrity name of the restaurant and should have skipped over this place for restaurant week. The restaurant week menu really didn't hold anything unique to the Morimoto name, except for the fact you're sitting in one of his chairs eating in his restaurant. Instead, I should have saved the money from today's lunch and come back for an actual morimoto styled dinner. Needless to say, I can't turn back time, but as a tip for those who walk out not completely full, you can get some food from Chelsea Market right next door. Just make a left when you leave.

I have eaten there twice and both meals were fantastic. ?I recently went with my girlfriend and we started with the shrimp tempura and the soft shell crab sushi roll. ?Both were amazing. ?The shrimp tempura was unbelievable and each bite was perfect. ?The sushi roll had a perfectly cooked fresh soft shell crab inside as well as perfectly fresh vegetables. ?The combination of soft and crunchy textures in this roll were amazing and the flavors were delicious. We tried one of their steaks as well as a seared yellowfin tuna entree and again both were amazing. ?The steaks are pricey but it was cooked perfectly. ?The tuna was very fresh and the rice it came with was simple but the high food quality and combination of flavors was great. Dessert was maybe the best part of the meal. ?We had a cheesecake soufflé and it was so simple yet perfectly executed. ?It was one of my favorite cheesecakes I have eaten in my life. Other high points: great cocktails, great service, and super hip and artistic decor that makes this restaurant a great and memorable dining experience. Simply one of the best restaurants and meals I have had!

Yay Iron Chef!! Ok, so I didn't have the FULL Experience, because I went for restaurant week. But being Japanese I need to try at least 1 good/expensive Japanese restaurant, on a budget, whilst in NYC. ?There are a lot of over hyped celebrity restaurants in NYC, but this is not one of them. Morimoto is really expensive. Therefore you don't get much on your plate for the restaurant week price of $25. ?But the quality makes up for it. This is hands down some of the best made sushi rice i've ever eaten...Wagyu beef was great, but the black cod bento was even better. Save some more dollars and forget Nobu. Morimoto is worth the higher $. The service is MUCH better, the ambience is sexy, the food is significantly better, and so is the food presentation. I also had the virgin White lilley non alcoholic cocktail with Yuzu and Calpico. YUM! The Morimoto iced tea was great too :) I wish wish wish i could afford the while menuuu...

I watch Iron Chef only when someone challenges Morimoto...so naturally I was very interested in going to his restaurant while in NY & made reservations a few weeks in advance. Glad I did as the place was packed! We were a little early so the hostess informed us we could wait in the bar area downstairs until our table was ready. The bar area is small but has a nice intimate feel to it and the bartenders were friendly and attentive. We tried a glass of the rose champagne which was good. Not too sweet or tart, just refreshing. We ended up having to wait longer than our reservation time for our table and were pretty hungry so decided to split the Ramen Soup ("iron chef" chicken noodle soup) while still at the bar. Let me tell you, this was the best chicken noodle soup I have tasted. I could really taste the chicken in the broth and the noodles were so good. Only downside was that there were maybe only 3-4 pieces of chicken - more broth & noodles in the dish. My second drink choice was a glass of Chianti which went perfectly with the rest of our meal. We were finally seated at our table and the manager handled the delay beautifully. We were brought out complimentary appetizers (a sashimi salad & another sashimi plate). Both were excellent! I wish I could remember what type of fish the sashimi plate was - the cooks spiced it up and it was so good. I didn't see it on the menu so assume it was a chef's "in the moment" creation. We decided to get the chef's sashimi platter to share - for two people the $80 one is the best option so you don't feel you are shorted sashimi for the price. The waiter accommodated our request that we not get any beef or octopus in our sashimi - all we really cared for was the fish!! After this we decided to try the whole roasted lobster as a test to me since I usually don't like it. The verdict? It was alright - very lightly done with garam masala but still enjoyable for us to share. The other main entrée we were tempted to try was the Angry Chicken but knew we wouldn't have room for dessert! Finally dessert - not a huge selection on the menu but what caught our eye was the Chocolate Macadamia Nut Bar. This was so yum!! The dish even had some thin slices of dried pineapple which gave a little sourness to the dessert (offsetting all the sugar). Definitely glad we opted for dessert. I definitely will go back when I am in town again to sample some of the other dishes!! All in all, we had a great time on our last night in NY. Oh, and ladies if you get a chance to check out the bathroom go for it! Heated seats, flower décor, very nice :)

YUM! Beautiful decor, delicious food, owned by my favorite Iron Chef, what more could a girl ask for? I came here with my sister for lunch and it was awesome. We started with drinks; she had the Morimoto iced tea, which was interesting (in a good way) and I tried the orange blossom cocktail and it was so good. I can tell how amazing a bartender is by how little I can detect the sting of alcohol in a cocktail (while still getting tipsy) and this drink tasted like sparkling orange juice and I got quite a buzz so kudos to the bartender. For our appetizer, we ordered the toro tartare which was SO good. You can go to youtube and search for "Best Thing I Ever Ate Toro Tartare" to see Duff (from "Ace of Cakes") describe his experience eating the dish. It was one of the most unique, decadent, amazing dishes I've ever eaten. We tried the wagyu beef bento box and the braised black cod bento box ($25, great deal for the amount of food). The beef and cod were both a bit too salty for our tastes but I loved everything else. I was surprised to see actual sushi being served with the bento (instead of something lame like a California roll) and the salad was vibrant and fresh and topped with what looked and tasted like deep fried orange blossom petals. The bento boxes come with dessert too - panna cotta, which was light, creamy, and yummy. We also ordered a salmon skin roll, which was prepared perfectly. To end our meal, we got the flourless chocolate cake (recommended by our awesome waitress). Because even though the bento boxes came with dessert, we were at Morimoto! Why not go all out? It was served with caramel popcorn and green tea pear sorbet and it was so good. The staff were all really personable and attentive and our waitress was so friendly and nice and we loved her. Lastly, I need to comment on how lovely the bathrooms were. The toilet seats were heated and fancy and divine.

I was here for the birthday party. It is great place, we were 2 hours late for our reservation, but they found table for us right away, even it was busy. Thank you so much for such service. Food was delicious. You must try toro tartare . :) Here is a great choice of fish for any taste, also I loved surf and turf. Every dish it was like an art. And for the masterpiece you have to pay a lot:) ? Warm chocolate cake was yummy, I'm ready to die to have it right now:)

I had gone to Morimoto about a year ago and had an amazing experience...service and food were incredible. I went again last week and was so disappointed. I had ordered the chef's selection of sushi which i thought would be some amazing creation from the chefs. In reality it was literally a drab spicy tuna roll and 6 pieces of various sashimi. Ok, where the heck is the chef's craftsmanship in that? This is Morimoto. Your chef's selection should be superb and creative. Other sushi places can get away with this- you shouldn't. The drinks we ordered had almost no alcohol in them too.

I just love Morimoto..I got really excited heading to New York knowing that we were going to try out my favorite Iron Chef..My boyfriend and I headed here as our last dinner of our amazing trip and boy, was it a great ending to a wonderful trip! We arrived at the restaurant and were greeted by the hostess..we were sat down and I loved my waiter (I wish I remembered his name)..super super friendly and very helpful in answering any of our questions and continued to ask us how things were.. We decided to start off with some drinks, I ordered the eye of the tiger cocktail (I wasn't a huge fan as I always end up picking cocktails that are a bit too strong for me but I can see why many people enjoy this drink)..my boyfriend ordered the soba beer (one of morimoto's creations).he said he enjoyed it but he wasn't sure if he was going to go pick up a case of them anytime soon as each beer was about $23 dollars! haha..We decided not to do the omasake and pick some appetizers, one entree and maybe a dessert We started with the infamous toro tar tar..beautiful concept, very nice accompaniments to the toro..we both really enjoyed it! We also had the sashimi appetizer..just a heads up for the sashimi appetizer, their quiet small but each comes with a different 'topping'..of course my favorite was with the caviar (yumm!!) We both actually enjoyed the sashimi much more than the toro (i know I'm going to get a lot of flack for this as it seems EVERYONE raves about the toro)..We also enjoyed the rock shrimp tempura..My boyfriend loved this one the best as he found both flavors to be very tasty! We then were deciding what to do next..sushi? more appetizers? entree? two entrees? We heard about the duck duck duck (which we were going to order) but we also wanted room for dessert and we were starting to get a bit full..but then my eyes glanced down and saw..the glorious waygu beef..we kept flip flopping and then my boyfriend said "let's do it!"we ordered the waygu new york strip with a side of bok choy..omg..the steak was delicious delcious delicious! best steak we have ever had..we were so happy to have shared this and ordered it because it was so rich in flavor..we definitely were satisfied!! Then my boyfriend I guess let our waiter know it was our anniversary so we got this deconstructed dessert which was great but we were sooo full.. Yes, the bathrooms are nice, I didn't realize I would be getting my butt warmed up from the toilet which makes you not really want to leave while playing with all those buttons! We also saw Randy from Say yes to the dress..he was wearing a very outrageous suit but he still looked fantastic! Overall, great meal to end our trip..prices are a little on the pricy side but we've been to other restaurants that were much more expensive where you don't get the same quality..At morimoto's, you definitely get a great experience, great service and overall great food! YUM =)

For our first adventure to NYC (and definitely not our last), my hubby and I celebrated at Morimoto's... And it was sincerely an gastronomical epiphany. Despite the slew of negative reviews, I sincerely loved each and every dish the chef put on our table. Because we love the Iron Chef, we decided to go with the Omakase Dinner. "Why not go all out?" we thought. If you're a foodie like us and have some money to spare, you should definitely get the Omakase. The beginning course was the highly rated Toro Tartare, and personally, I LOVED it. Sincerely, if you thought this was "too" fishy, then you probably don't know good seafood. The Toro Tartare was lush as it was delicious, and the extra crunch you get from rice cracker balls heightens the textures in your mouth. The next course is Kampachi Sashimi with Shiitake, and it was really yummy. The shiitake was meaty, the sauce was delicate, and the sashimi was heavenly. I may have to stop there because Chef Morimoto constantly updates the Omakase Dinner, and it may be a difference experience for you as it was for me. Personally, I was so happy I chose this dinner option because you get to taste the variety and skill that makes the Iron Chef. He's a very talented man. Also, this is probably the best place I've ever eaten sushi at. As a LA girl, I'm an ardent lover of sushi, and the fresh wasabi Morimoto used definitely brought the sushi to a whole new level. During dinner, he also gave us a shot of ginger ale, which helped cleaned our palates. It was yummy, and helped us enjoy each course with a fresh tongue! Btw, we also ordered Morimoto's freshly brewed beers, the hazel and dark ones. They were GOOD. I'm a lover of good, malty beer, and the dark one was definitely one of the best I've tasted. I hope my review was helpful!

I came here for restaurant week (only available for lunch) and had the braised black cod bento box. The best dish in the bento box was the sushi. It was so fresh and delightful with a touch of wasabi. The spicy The cod was ok - it didn't taste extraordinarily special but it was tasty. The fish was perfectly cooked but the sauce was a little overpowering. It was more like something my mother would make at home. (That being said, my mother is an amazing cook.) ?Everything else was good too. If I were to rate the bento box alone, I would give it something between a 3 and 4. What really blew us away (like Judy L said) were the desserts. It started with the panna cotta that came with our restaurant week meal. This was a delicious and light green tea panna cotta. Then, due to an earlier incident at our table, the manager comp'd our table with two desserts: apple bread pudding and a cheesecake with raspberry sorbet. These were to die for. I don't know how I will ever enjoy future desserts to come in my life after this experience. The desserts were so amazing, our one male friend at the table didn't dare take a bite as the three of us ladies devoured the desserts in seconds. The cheesecake was light and fluffy - almost airy. Not too sweet and still flavorful. The apple bread pudding came with the green tea crumble that made the dish just mind blowing. I'm not sure how you get the tartness and sweetness in an apple to taste so subtle not do I understand how you can make a crumble taste not at all like clumps of sugar and butter, but all of this and more were fully accomplished. It wasn't remotely close to what I would expect from an apple dessert (I was kind of expecting more like a super sweet pie). It was like a light but creamy pudding. Honestly, my dessert descriptions really don't do these desserts justice. You have to go in and try it out for yourself. MAKE LOTS AND LOTS OF ROOM FOR DESSERT. In fact, even if you don't have room (like us), just order it and it will disappear. All in all, the service was great. We had a few issues arise from our experience and the manager resolved them each gracefully. If he hadn't, I would probably be complaining about each incidents in this review rather than raving about the desserts. So despite the occurrence of the incidents, I still enjoyed my experience here. I would come back for the dessert.

Great but no so extraordinary because I had high hopes of Morimoto actually cooking there, but according to his staff he was busy opening up a restaurant in Mexico. And also I had the tasting menu which came ungodly awfully slow, I was almost ready to leave. I could of had the same dishes at another place almost for 90% less of the cost and would of been happier. The bathrooms where awesome with the use of double mirrors given a cool special effect! It was for a birthday party, and I honestly felt bad they spent so much money for nothing out of the ordinary. If it were for a normal Japanese dinner I wouldn't come here because its just inflated pricing for SLOW service and alright food.

I came here to Morimoto to celebrate my birthday with my friend back in October. And let me tell you, this place is AMAZING! There's the main floor where the tables and the sushi bar is, and a downstairs where the bar/lounge is. Since I made reservations a little too late for a Friday at 7PM, there was only availability for downstairs. It was a nice cozy area downstairs. Very pretty place. We sat at a high table and there weren't many people downstairs so we had our privacy. And we took plenty of pictures. For drinks, we both ordered the lychee drink and that was amazing! I love getting lychee drinks wherever I go because I love lychee! For appetizer, we ordered the Rock Shrimp Tempura that comes with a a wasabi sauce and a sauce that reminds me of sweet & sour. So the two types of shrimp comes on two separate plates along with a side of ranch sauce. Both flavors were awesome. Ranch dressing drowns out the flavors a little so there's no need for it. As my entree, I ordered the Duck Duck Duck that comes with duck breast and duck leg and a duck egg. There was a sandwich to it. It all became very filling and I was stuffed! The duck was savoring and a little fatty of course considering it is duck after all. My friend got the lobster. She said it was good as well. For dessert, we ordered the Warm Flourless Chocolate Cake that came with caramel popcorn, and sorbet. The cake was very rich in chocolate. That's not really my thing. But the sorbet was really good. In total, the bill came out to $160 with tax and tip, so about $80 a person. It is a pricey place, but definitely worth it since the food is amazing! And of course to end the night, we had to check out the bathroom in the lounge area like everyone said! The bathroom was very pretty with the layers of mirrors and flowers/leaves hanging in them. The toilet was the style of toilet they have in Japan where you can have water sprayed on your butt to clean it...lol. Never had the courage to experience that in Japan or here, but if you're brave enough, go for it! :) Also, Morimoto is right under the High Line Park so it was a nice night to take a walk and to let all the food digest because we were definitely full afterwards!

My friends were in town for a NYC visit, and they wanted to get together to try a good restaurant. ?We decided to go here last night, and I am so glad we did!! When you first walk in, the decor is absolutely spectacular!! ?Beautiful, clean, spacious, the right amount of light. ?We made reservations, and we were seated right away. ?We felt a bit underdressed - my friends were in t-shirt and jeans. ?But hey, nobody really seemed to mind or said anything; so that was cool. Our waiter was very polite, took the time to explain everything - gave suggestions - and patiently answered any questions we had, and very attentive. So, the food is the most important. ?We had the famous Toro Tartare...WIN!! ?I don't need to go into detail about it, since all the other reviewers have already explained this work of art. ?Truly, it was magnificent! ?We also ordered the Lamb Carpaccio appetizer, which was also very good, but the Toro Tartare just overshadowed it, of course. ?For my meal, I ordered the Chirashi Sushi, and it was delicious! ?It was strange, I had a hard time finishing the Chirashi - I struggled at half, but believe me, I can eat!! ?Is it really that filling? ?Or maybe it was from the pure satisfaction of the Toro Tartare? ?Not sure. ?My friends ordered sushi rolls, and they really loved it. Toro Tartare - $28, Lamb Carpaccio - $18, Chirashi - $32, sushi rolls ranged $6-12. Yes, it's pricey, but hey I was fully prepared for that. ?So, I would only come here for special occasions, and I honestly believe it's worth it. I really hope to come back here, and next time, I'll save up for the $120 Omakase. :-) Besides the Toro Tartare, what is my next piece of advice? ?Check out the bathroom!! ?Yes, seriously!! ?Beautiful decor, crazy work of art in the stall, and of course - the special toilet...no really, it's special! Morimoto, I am a fan! :-)

Love the space. Love the food. The glass wall is gorgeous and I love that I got to stare at my boyfriend in front of it through our entire meal :) To start I ordered some assorted pieces of sashimi, including a piece of the wagyu. Each one was so tender and delicious! BF started with the dumplings which were good, but I probably wouldn't order over the other menu choices. For my main I ordered the braised black cod and loved it. BUT, as good as it was it could not compare to the huge wagyu ny strip he ordered. They pour this amazing garlic jus on tableside and the cast iron dish it's served on creates a garlic smoke that is unreal! I kept stealing bites :). On my next visit, I'd like to come with someone who eats seafood, so we can try the toro tartare, the crispy rock shrimp tempura, morimoto sashimi and definitely the ny strip again!

Went for lunch during the summer, they were still offering their Restaurant Week special. I had the black cod; it was tasty but not mind blowing. I did not enjoy the mini panna cotta for dessert, and I normally LOVE dessert! Loved the decor. Servers were decent. It is next to Chelsea Market so there is a tourist element, lots of shorts! I doubt I would come here on a weekend because the area can be a scene. The drinks were really good. I will definitely come back to try the sushi.

Weee I love Morimoto. Not many chefs can pull off a fusion Asian restaurant that doesn't lose any of the individual flavor the food and also without making it tacky. Chef Morimoto is definitely genius in that sense. I remember when I first tried the Toro Tartare, I let out a long sigh, and then a moan, and then a laugh. It's just so ridiculously good! And the presentation? Yeah yeah it's just whatever.. NOT! Omg the dish looks SO beautiful that you feel bad eating it! I also love the sushi, the freshness of the fish that you can't really find in New York often. I love the black cod miso too. It melts in your mouth. Last time I went, I did the Omakase, which is their tasting menu. It wasn't enough food for me so we ended up ordering some more stuff to share among 3 people. But it isn't as expensive as many tasting menus these days, so I wasn't upset. Plus, the food they chose for the tasting menu was all REALLY great, so I was happy. They start you off with a full portion of the Toro Tartare! That is an amazing start to any meal, trust me. The hostesses and waitresses can get a little cold and snobby, but they put on a good front which I don't mind so much as long as they're nice to me on the outside. Other than that, AMAZING place. Awesome architecture, interior design, ambience, music, and of course, food. 5 stars for sure!

A sushi bar where you can't talk to the sushi chef? What's the point? We like to sit at the sushi bar to talk to the chef and chat about what's superfresh, the preparation he recommends or we prefer, so we can order as we go, and just to do all that other fun interactive stuff a good sushi restaurant is all about. Last night we were asked by the sushi chef we were sitting 3 feet away from to place our orders with the waiter. We concluded this is not really a place for sushi lovers. Come here for a standard sushi 'platter' if you don't care what you get - but be warned, we saw one chef slicing up large quantities of fish presumably so your sashimi may have been sitting around pre-cut and waiting for your order for some time. Come for the fusion stuff, which is probably excellent. Come for the decor or to have your photo taken with the famous iron chef (whatever...). But for the love of fish, freshness and authenticity, go elsewhere for your sushi.

The food is inventive but ?hit-and-miss taste-wise, and sometimes you feel like you're being given ingredients of average quality that have simply been dressed up in cute outifts (the tuna toro appetizer, for instance) in a kind of culinary sleight-of-hand. ? One would hope that a chef of Morimoto's credentials wouldn't be so primitively crass as to oversalt and MSG so many things to death, but sadly that's often the case here. ?Get the omakase if you're rich or somebody else is paying -- at least you'll have a number of things to sample and you'll probably like at least half of them. ?This is the kind of place -- decent but overpriced food, minimalist shabby-chic lounge decor, out-of-the-way neighborhood, celebrity chef who isn't actually there very often -- that you figure won't be able to survive the recession. ?There are just so many better ways to part with $125 or more on a meal in Manhattan, many of them Japanese. ? And if you really are somehow drawn in by the whole celebrity chef thing, bear in mind that NYC has a number of restaurants with chefs of notoreity and renown who actually do work just about every day in the kitchen instead of filming FoodTV shows and doing book tours. ?Crazy concept, I know, but you might want to give one of those places chance.

By far my favorite Japanese restaurant, throughout my dining experience, so far. The pulchritudinous venu and succulent food served here made my experience memorable. The super attentive servers made it even better. The restaurant sparkled! It has two floor, dining upstair and a bar downstair. Ladies, check out the bathroom!!! beautiful cherry blossom interior. Very upscale, romanitic restaurant. As a starter, my date and I ordered Morimoto sashimi; thinly sliced seared toro, salmon, eel, hamachi, with five different sauces. THE BEST sashimi I've had so far. Extremely fresh, you can taste the natural sweetness of the fish. Entree: I had Duck Duck Duck; foie gras croissant, soft duck egg, and red miso sauce. The duck was utterly tender and roast to perfection! Best duck I've had. The croissant was very buttery from the foie gras and it was stuffed with duck meat. The skin of the duck meat was also crispy and sweet. I also had Soft shell crab maki roll; deep-fried soft shell crab. Very GOOD! The Japanese Lobster Fritters I had was also to die for. It was scallion, pickle ginger, and lobster reduction. Dessert: There was not much desserts to choose from but I had flourless chocolate cake. one word: DELICIOUS!

Went to Morimoto for anniversary with my boyfriend. Had the "omakase". The atmosphere and design of the place was nice. Staff seemed friendly but STUPID. At the beginning of your order, they ask what you are allergic to or don't want included at all in "omakase"...They start to bring out the dishes that include what we don't want at all. What was the point of asking then? Then, they almost brought a dish we already had. Dishes were great but it was certainly overpriced especially for the service. Not sure if I go again.

Marimoto is what every restraunt should strive to be, world class ambience , meticulous food, outstanding service and $5,000 toto toilets in the downstairs bathrooms. The lunch specials are exceptional and an unbelievable value at $24! Only comment was that the portions were a bit small on the protein. If you eat rice it's fine but for low carb folks we would appreciate a bit larger protein portions. However for the money, i am not complaining. Arigato chef Morimoto.

I had high hopes but was very not impressed by this place. We were sat at a terrible table. It was right near the server station (when you walk in on the left). ?The table was tiny and it was very noisy from all of the servers dropping things etc - since it was sticking out I could actually see them all working. Since the table was tiny and we planned on ordering a lot of food we asked if we could change to a larger table. ?We saw quite a few larger tables available and asked if we could switch to one. ?However they would not let us change. ?So we asked to change to the sushi bar. They walked us over to the sushi bar and there were at least 5 seats available but some woman decided she was going to hold one and the others were being bussed so they asked us to wait. ?We waited about 20 minutes and were finally sat at the sushi bar. From that point forward the service was bad. ?Our server took our drink order and we didn't see anything for 15+ minutes. ?Once we finally got our drinks and were ready to place an order the server never came back. ? We bought a bottle of water (a ridiculously overpriced Pellegriono co-branded by Bulgari). ?We decided that if we finished the bottle before the server came back, we were going to leave and go to Nobu instead. ?And that's exactly what happened. On the way out the door the manager asked how things were. ?He pretended to care but it was too little too late. ? At that point I was not keen to spend $300+ there given how poor the experience had been so far. The manager gave us his card and said to let him know when we were going to come in again. But this experience was enough for me - I will never go here ?again. Two drinks + overpriced water + tip = $50 Rides to and from Midtown = $50 Leaving Morimoto and enjoying a fantastic sushi meal at Nobu = priceless

I think I did the right thing to celebrate Year of Dragon by having lunch at Morimoto! Someone mentioned that it is good luck to eat sushi on the first day of the year. ? Marcus was our waiter and he provided excellent service. We ordered both Wagyu Beef Bento Box and Blackened Cod Bento Box from the RW menu. ? - Miso soup - 4 stars, soft and smooth tofu and good soup base - Vegetable tempura - 2 stars, blue cheese sauce do not go well with this dish - Salad - 4 stars, fresh - Wagyu Beef - 3.5 stars, yummy, not the best and definitely not on par with the one from Kobe - Blackened Cod - 3 stars, good flavor, but a bit overdone for my taste. ?I still like the cod from EN Japanese Brasserie. ?But my mom loved this. - sushi and roll - 3 stars, okay, again, not the best and still like the one from Tokyo Tsukiji Fish Market. - Raspberry Panna Cotta - 4 stars, the hghlight of bento box. Of course, we took the opportunity to try a few other dishes, so we also ordered the following: appetizer: - Toro Tartare ($31) - I had toro at Tokyo Tsukiji Fish Market and it was heaven. ?This dish had a slight fishy taste. ?In term of taste, it dd not deliver but it was definitely fun to eat it. ?My whole family enjoyed the fun. - Beef Curry Beard ($11 for 2) - 4 stars, very tasty, will order again drink: - Tomino Hozan Shochu (, wine made by sweet potato, $15) ?- not a fan of it - Virgin Lily ($7) - it is okay, not that great dessert: - hot and cold tofu ($12) - 5 stars. ?This consists of 4 items: 1. hot soy milk souffle - light, hot and yummy 2. cold tofu cheesecake - light and yummy 3. maple ice-cream - just okay 4. coffee syrup - yummy, strong coffee flavor, perfect for dessert. ?We like this so much that we drank it by the spoonful and want to lick the bowl..... Definitely will order this dessert again! bathroom: - slide door is strange - warm seat and remind me of those toilets in Japan A couple of suggestions - hot tea and white rice are staple for Japanese restaurants. ? These two things enhance the flavor of the meal. ?Hot tea will clean the palate for sushi and rice will cut the saltiness of wagyu beef and blackened cod. ?These two items are inexpensive but yet it charges $$$ for them. ?Morimoto, as a chef, you should provide two spoonfuls of rice with the beef/cod and a cup of hot green tea with sushi. Definitely an experience to have a meal here......too bad that the CHEF was not in the kitchen.

I've been here many times and each visit has been consistent. Great food, beautiful ambiance, and 1st class service (the servers really know their stuff). I HIGHLY recommend their white lily martini. It's ... delightful :) Crisp, delicate, and perfect with any tuna appetizer. I can't even begin to list the items on the menu that I would recommend. I think i've tried over 75% of the items on that menu and have had a mouthgasm for everything i've eaten. An entree that stood out to me was the mozzarella sashimi cold dish. The dish was served with thin slices of sashimi drizzled with truffle oil and topped with mozzarella balls. ?Sounds odd but ?the ingredients complemented each other quite nicely. ? For a main dish, I would suggest the chilean sea bass, the braised black cod, or the yellowtail chirashi. ?They cook their fishes perfectly! The way they serve the chirashi is also really cool. ?The server brings out the ingredients separately and mixes all of the components into a hot stone pot right in front of you. Fresh and Delish. Five stars. no questions. Admittedly, the food is a bit expensive but amazing food and excellent service comes at a price. ? I will be going back again, and again, and again... and again....

We came here for my birthday, the place is super modern! We didnt get a nice area, close to the entrance, but it was a nice restaurant so it doesn't really matter. We ordered the famous toro tartare, tuna pizza, wagyu beef and surf and turf + desserts.. Food was really good and service was great! After dinner we went downstairs to the lounge and wow loved the lights and atmosphere! Had this drink I don't remember the name but was something lily , it was fabulous! Kept asking the bartender about te wasabi martini, the next time he made the drink, he gave me a small glass from the extra to try! Great stuff!

Chef Morimoto's restaurant in NY has sleek, modern decor. A highlight being, the glass bottle fixture in the middle that divides and transitions the restaurant. For restaurant week, they feature two bento box options: cod and beef. The cod was definitely better, teriyaki sweet. The beef was thin and unimpressive. Otherwise they were the same and featured tempura with a white dipping sauce ( i would have preferred the traditional dipping sauce), a salad, miso with homemade chucks of tofu, a spicy tuna roll and salmon, tuna, and yellow tail sushi. The fish was fresh and that was about it. Nothing memorable or impressive. I have a feeling their entrees are more delicious. Sushi rolls are economical and ordinary.

To be honest, I wasn't totally enthusiastic about going to another Japanese restaurant. But after giong there, wow Morimoto, you've exeeded my expectations! I expected oh you know... just another Japanese restaurant. Just overpriced =X The oyster foie gras = heaven melting in my mouth. Moist, tender & juicy. The tempura calamari salad was pretty good. The pieces of calamari were large & juicy. Although the outside was crunchy, it was a soft crunchy... I wasn't used to that type of tempura but the different texture was still pretty good. I have to figure out what's in their seasoning! Seafood 'toban yaki' was a little bit too overcooked for my taste but then again I think it's because the seafood was sitting in a steamed broth until the moment I ate it. My boyfriend ordered the duck. & let me tell you, the duck is AMAZING. the skin was crisp, not dry & the meat was tenderly cooked to perfection. A must get if you like meat :) Great twist on the typical Peking duck. As for dessert? I was in love w/ the tofu 'hot & cold'. There's just so many different textures & flavors for soy... The dessert was light, yet so rich in flavor. My boyfriend got the strawberry cheesecake. I was impressed w/ the presentation of all the dishes as well. I love the decor of this place. It's just so fresh! Place is great for a date or groups & also great for drinks. If you're coming here, dress to impress ;)

Hands down some amazing food. I love the atmosphere, however a few areas were quite clustered. Bar seats there are my preference. Wasabi saketini was interesting. It was great to sip on, but didn't quite go with dinner. The sushi sampler is delicious! You know it's fresh! Comes with different sauces to pair with your likings. The sea bass was out of this world also!!! I'd definitely come here again!

I was here to try out its Restaurant Week's Prix Fixe which came in the form of bento boxes. I opted for the Grilled Wagyu Beef which came with (1) miso soup, (2) salad, (3) veggie tempura, (4) sushi platter and (5) raspberry panna cotta with fresh berries. Grilled Wagyu Beef was all right. Nicely marinated. I think it could do with better grilling to give it a slightly crispy exterior. Miso soup was really good. Silken tofu was used! Salad was BAH. Definitely an ornamental dish to add more bulk to the otherwise parse-looking bento box. Veggie tempura. The cheesy sauce was very delicious and in surplus relative to the 3 small pieces of tempura served. Sushi platter. Saviour of the bento box. Tuna uramaki, quoting my friend, which 'instantly melts in your mouth'. Sashimi - very fresh and fantastic! Raspberry panna cotta - good. But I could not figure out how it fit in this Japanese bento box. Being a macaroon-fanatic, I ordered the Morimoto Macaroons - 6 different flavours - green tea with wasabe, black sesame, coffee, eggplant (oh gosh, insanely good), raspberry chocolate w wasabe and yuzu! The macaroons were good for a place which does not specialise in sweets, or french desserts. Decently priced too. I do not think the Prix Fixe menu is highly representative of the restaurant's actual cuisine standard. Unfortunately, the bento box had failed to marvel me and I am unlikely to be back here for the full-fledged Morimoto dining experience.

***This is my NY disclaimer. Being from TX, I was shell-shocked at the price of pretty much everything in NY. Unless the food was insanely cheap or insanely expensive, I didn't factor price into my review*** So the apocryphal story goes that Atlanta pharmacist John Pemberton was trying to create a headache cure when, mixing chemicals haphazardly, he stumbled upon the formula for Coca-Cola. I mention it because most of the time, experimenting with known, well established ingredients fails miserably. But sometimes, just sometimes, it works. Morimoto is one of those times. This was the very first place we visited upon arriving in NY. It set the bar high. Had I reviewed it immediately afterwards, I would have given it five stars. Time (and eating at a multitude of other world-class restaurants) has a funny way of putting things into perspective though. The decor is upscale, neat, and functional. Save for a wall of back-lit glass bottles, it's surprisingly sparse. Overhead, there appears to be a draped cloth roof, though I suspect it's cleverly disguised corrugated metal. Oh, and check out the bathrooms. Aside from having an infinity mirror arrangement, the toilets also have remotes. Yes, seriously. The food was good, though overall the theme seemed to be "cleverly executed twists on traditional dishes." Does that count as culinary originality? You be the judge. We shared the toro tartare (Morimoto's signature dish) as an appetizer, the tuna was gorgeous and seemed to melt in your mouth. Eating it was unwieldy, as you're suppose to scrape the tuna with miniature ice-scrapers, then dip it into the piped sauces provided. Half the fun is in the inventive presentation, half the fun is laughing as your fellow diners try to eat it. I had a wagyu bento box, which I thought was reasonably priced (for NY) at $21. Everything in the box was top-notch, though nothing compelled me to come salivating back for more. The wagyu portion was a bit small at 3 or 4 slices. Though I appreciate the nod to Japanese authenticity (where beef protein is a small portion of the diet), the Texan in me demands.more.beef! Wifey ordered the angry chicken, another Morimoto stalwart. Again, perfectly cooked, flavorful yet slightly spicy. Honestly, perhaps the spice was a bit too subtle. Very good, but it lacked that "WOW" moment...which was pretty much the theme of the entire meal. Morimoto is worth a visit, and certainly worth the money, but much like watching Morimoto on Iron Chef, it never generates that jump-out-of-your-seat excitement that a few other restaurants in NY create.

FIrst off, I want to state that this restaurant is beautiful. Even before entering, the exterior is covered in a repetition of tied draped deep-red cloth covering the glass door entrance. The interior itself is very modern with facades of glass with wooden furnishings and soft tones of white/beige all around the restaurant. Anyways, on to the review. My girlfriend and I shared the toro tartare appetizer which our server had suggested; the signature appetizer of the restaurant. Served on a wooden paddle with caviar and six various accoutrements, it was indeed a pleasure on the eyes as well as the palate. The tuna had a rich texture and flavor, and we opted for the accoutrements on the right side of the secondary wooden dish since the creme fraiche and wasabi paste didn't appeal to us too much. Also, the two drinks that we ordered (ginger lemonade and white lilly) were wonderful as well; reminiscent of the non-alcoholic drink pairing we had at Rogue 24 earlier this year. For the entrees I had the lobster with I thought was supposed to be served raw since it was under the "raw bar" category, but it came out steamed and chilled. The server later explained that restaurants in NYC are prohibited from serving raw lobster, but nonethless it was satisfying, the lobster was thoughtfully cracked in the right places, the presentation was beautiful, and it was accompanied by 4 different dipping sauces and two different type of delicate fruits which I don't remember the name of. My girlfriend opted for the wagyu beef sandwich, which was crafted well and accompanied by sweet pickles and fried onion rings. Finally we finished off with their inventive interpretation of flourless chocolate cake which was very rich and had a great texture, topped off with caramel popcorn and a delicious serving of green tea ice cream with chopped fruit underneath. All in all it was a solid meal with great presentation, but I would say it lacked the extra "wow" factor which makes me unable to give the restaurant a 5 star rating.

Ah, what a delight. Looking at it from outside I was damn sure I was at the wrong place, until I noticed the Hiragana that read "" on the curtains. Once you step inside you're amazed by the contrast of two sides of the door. The lady at the front was real nice and she led us to our table without wait, which made me happy since I was having dinner with a business partner. We ended up ordering many dishes, and a nice Junmai type sake to go with them. I strongly urge people to try the appetizers and explore more unknown dishes instead of jumping straight to nigiri, rolls or sashimi. Japanese cuisine is more than that you know. Well I can say that their bathrooms are equally entertaining especially when you walk down the stairs towards the bar then to the bathrooms. It reminds me of the W Hotel in Seoul or Setai on 5th Avenue, where they have this ultra modern and sleek look. Overall, it's a good place to dine with friends and large groups since it gets a little loud during the peak time. For business dinners, only bring people you know well enough, because most likely you will be tipsy thanks to the alcohol after an hour ..

I had lunch at Morimoto with 6 other friends. ?The food was very good (not great), the service a little slow and the lunch menu was not that exciting. I had the Spicy Tuna and the wagyu beef. ? The roll was good but not as spicy as I like but he wagyu beef was actually very tough and stringy which is a disappointment. The ambiance is fantastic with the modern feel and the wonderful furnishings. ?but the real treat, which is why the 4 stars, is the bathroom. ?Now you might ask yourself why is a bathroom even listed here... because they are really cool. ?You walk into the stall to be greeted by an automatic toilet which automatically opens the lid. ?Then there is the control panel which operates the bidet features. It is a good place but little touristy for my pleasure but worth a visit to check it out.

One of the most popular modern Japanese restaurants in the city! Love the decor, the restrooms and their cocktails are the best ones in the area. Plus, the food is def appealing to the eyes. ? Stop there, that's all you should expect. Taste wise, it's really mediocre and not living up to Morimoto's reputation. As one of the few A-listed Asian chefs in the states, I give him tremendous respect and credit, but I'm sorry, most dishes here (I've been here 5 times and tried almost everything on the menu) are rather gimmicky instead of tasty. I'd recommend it for a business meal or company party, but if you are paying out of your own pocket, there are definitely better options in the city.

I went to Morimoto this past weekend, and left a little unimpressed. The atmosphere is nice, but didn't exactly blow me away. The food was ok, but didn't blow me away either. Unfortunately, my feelings on the decor/ambiance are probably skewed by the fact we were seated in a corner area of about 6 tables off to the left when you first walk in. I know it may sound like I'm being picky, but it makes you feel disconnected from everything else. The downstairs bar was a decent scene, and everyone who waited on us were polite & friendly. As for the food, it's not that it wasn't good. It was, but just not great. I'd definitely go back soon, however to try some of the other dishes. Appetizers: Oysters w/ Foie Gras: --I've never had oysters served w/ foie gras, but I enjoyed the dish very much. The sauce was a little salty, and thick, but otherwise I thought it was delicious. Steamed Scallops: -- Perfectly cooked. I wanted to pick up the bowl & drink the broth Spicy King Crab: -- Great flavor, but a little too salty Gyoza: -- My least favorite. Bland, and tasted like what you would find in any random Japanese restaurant. Main Course: Ishi Yaki Bop: --This dish is cooked at your table in a stone bowl. The presentation was great, and the rice caramelizing with the sauce is really delicious. Black Cod: --Every place seems to have a version of this dish, but this one was particularly good. Sea Bass: --Cooked perfectly, but I wasn't a big fan of the flavors. Very mild, and almost bland. I personally would have liked more of a contrast of flavors. Dessert: Tofu Hot & Cold: --I thought this dessert was terrible. The consistency of the cheesecake was off, and it tasted pretty bland. The souffle was overcooked, clumpy, and tasted like runny eggs.

One of my most favorite sushi restaurants in NYC. I love the ambiance. I love being able to walk in whenever and just sit at the sushi bar. Love watching chefs work. I've eaten here countless times and when i can afford it, my go to comfort japanese food. The wait staff is great too, always friendly and knowledgeable. favorite things: toro tartare (who doesn't like to play with their food? white fish carpaccio- something about hot oil and dashi soy mmmm calamari salad- enough calamari for 3.... and tender and tasty chef's choice of sushi- SO fresh the surf and turf ( hamachi ribbons and a perfect mini steak)- when I can't decide between fish and sushi oysters- made me like raw oysters, such a great balance in each the scallop appetizer is good too. my favorite special dish if you ever hear it, is the kobe bowl. it was fabulous. they haven't served it in a lonnnng time, but if they do...

It's not really 'authentic'...it's fusion, and Morimoto does it well. ?This sushi-Nazi and her hubby were thoroughly entertained and wowed by what can be done with traditional ingredients. ?One thing that is evident is Morimoto commands A+ quality ingredients. ?The variety of fish one can choose was impressive. ?Of course, though, we started with the tuna-tartare since we saw it featured on the Food Network. ?You enjoy the play of colors and textures before you even begin tasting it. ?While a waste of treating good quality maguro in this manner, this dish works. ? I was ooing and aahhing every plate that came out. ?We even had a hamachi-otoro that was oily, rich, and glistening. ?The touch of ginger and ponzu made for a nice contrast in tastes. ?Most importantly, we enjoyed fresh wasabi! ?Our itamaesan selected and presented each offering with instructions on whether or not to use soy sauce or another sauce he presented along with the sushi. ?After a couple hours and several benjamins later, we rolled out, hailed a taxi, and went back to the hotel with memories of Morimoto's mastery. ?Definitely a must on any sushi-afficionado's bucket list.

I have to admit, I had high hopes like many people who want to try Morimoto's famous food. I visited New York City for break and wanted to try out different foodie places. My friend wanted to show me Morimoto's because he had been there twice already, so I figured it was a good idea. I made reservations for Morimoto's on a Monday evening because I figured it wouldn't be too busy or crowded for a nice quiet dinner. I checked the website. It was pretty innovative. I can already tell it's a very dressy place. When we arrived, we were seated at a petite table inbetween two couples. A little snug because it was a bit awkward trying to get to my seat. The ambiance is very nice - very contemporary. But the lighting is too dim for my taste. I could barely see the table in front of me. I kind of wished we sat at the sushi bar. I was actually interested in the sushi. But my friend says he's known for his dishes. So I opted for the Morimoto Sashimi appetizer and he ordered the Lobster Fritters. I loved the fritters! They were piping hot and soft, they reminded me of Japanese takoyaki (octopus fritters). The Morimoto Sashimi presentation was cute. It's very petite. It almost looks too cute to eat. There were also a bunch of little pipet sauces to go along with the sashimi. I tried them with it, but I felt since there were already topped garnishes on the sashimi, the sauces didn't really enhance the flavors. They were a nice colorful touch though. They were also paired with a berry and wasabi. The wasabi was surprisingly sweet and not very intense, which was not bad. We ordered our entrees later. The server was helpful when I asked what fish dish she'd recommend. She also introduced a new special entree that had grilled pork and fried pork belly served. It sounded interesting, so my friend ordered it (despite him not a fan of pork, but it was something different from what he was going to order - which was the Deep Sea, he ordered last visit). After much debate from wanting to order nigiri and sushi rolls, I decided on the sea trout dish. Both dishes were $30 each. When the dishes arrived, they looked beautiful! The presentation was simple and elegant. My trout was cooked perfectly and very buttery. I have to admit, I almost got a little sick on how fatty it tasted. It was good, but too much. I had the perfect amount just to myself. I tried the pork belly too, and it too was very fatty - it melted in my mouth. Overall, I got stuffed and didn't opt for dessert. Even though I noticed the couple next to us ordered a full course meal with the dessert that looked amazing! But I couldn't stomach the dessert, unfortunately. I have to mention the bathroom toilets are cool. It was my first experience with the innovative robot toilet. I need one in my own home. The total bill came to about $113 for two people. My friend had an iced tea, we shared two appetizers, and two entrees. I thought it was not bad price for a big name especially in NYC, but still expensive for my wallet. I think I'd come back to try the sushi. I thought that for the price and quality, the food was good, but not incredibly innovative. The dishes we ordered to me were simple, tasteful, but not as I expected. Because it was by an Iron Chef, I imagined his dishes to be out of this world. This experience was good and I can say now that I've at least tried it once.

Being a Japanese person living in NYC, I am always looking for good restaurants that reminds me of home. As for this restaurant, I really wanted to like it... I really did, as I am a bit bias and give full support to other Nihionjin (Japanese ppl) in the US. ? So I chose Morimoto's to take some of my business clients for lunch. ?They did not have much experience eating Japanese food so they ended up ordering what I did, which was the Chirashi-don (Chirashi rice bowl). ?The Chirashi was definitely "elaborate", with LOTS of fish, but it wasn't done with much class. ?Similar to many other things in Japanese culture, "less is more." ?(For those who want to understand that better, watch Jiro Dreams of Sushi) ?After having a OK experience eating the Chirashi, the experience three four hours later was NOT OK! ? My clients, and myself all had a bad case of food poisoning. ?Thereafter, my clients were running to the bathroom during the meetings we had. ?I was starting to fever, and nausea was taking over my concentration. ?Eventually, I had to cancel the rest of my meetings to go home. ? Upon getting home, I decided to call Morimoto to let them know that the fish they were using had gone bad. ?I just wanted to make sure that they do not serve the same fish to other customers. ?I really did not want to put in a formal complaint. ?Upon speaking to the Manager, to my surprise, he told me that he could not do anything, nor look into the situation unless I put in a formal complaint. ?REALLY?!? ?As a Manager, is it not your duty to go to the chef to check on the fish you are serving! I am not sure how many others got food poisoning from Morimoto that day. ?I would say three people (including myself) eating the Chirashi and getting food poisoning is enough probability to at least do an investigation. ?According to the Manager, his exact words were, "I am sorry you're not feeling well, but we are unable to look into the situation unless there is a formal complaint." ? Did I put a formal complaint on the restaurant? ?The answer is "no" since I am not looking to shut the place down. ?I am sure the kitchens are clean, and the restaurant follows the health and food regulation codes. ?All I wanted to do was to just let them know that they had a fish that had gone bad. ?To be fair, I really thought I would be helping them by making the phone call despite my state of being at the time. ? I am not sure whether it's Masaharu Morimoto's lack of training on his employees, but the Manager should have looked into the situation. ?Maybe it's time Morimoto spends a bit more time at his restaurants to check for quality/service rather than making his debut in Hollywood on Hawaii Five-O. In summary, I would not recommend this restaurant. ?The food served by the "Iron Chef" can only be consumed with an iron stomach.

I'm no sushi connoisseur, but I've had my fair share, and this place was distinctly average. The presentation of the hamachi tartare and sashimi looked fancy, but lacked taste or the "freshness" you expect at this price point. The place is bright and seating tight. We had two couples on first dates on either side of us whose conversations we could unfortunately hear all too clearly. On the plus side, my conversation seemed infinitely more interesting in comparison. The highlight of the restaurant was probably the door lock in the bathroom, which was fashioned as a light switch and changed colors when it was locked. Come to think of it, it kind of looks like something you'd find in an airplane toilet, so scratch the highlight.

AMAZING! I came here with my entire family for our annual Christmas dinner. We all had the tasting menu and were salivating from the moment we first saw our dishes to the very last bite. This place does not mess around with food, and I'm pretty sure anything on the menu is spectacular. The space itself has a great vibe as well, and would be nice to meet up and share a drink in the bar/lounge downstairs. What I loved was how nice it was, but not too stuffy that you felt like you needed to whisper or couldn't speak normally. It felt comfortable to be in there. I can't say enough good things about this place!! You will not be disappointed!

Food was just alright compared to my years of dining in NYC, don't be fooled. ?And if you think the staff is nice, you haven't been to many places in the rest of NYC. ? I had made a reservation for 3 people for Sunday, 9 pm: for me, my boyfriend and a friend from out of the country here on a business trip. ?It was one of the most disappointing restaurant experiences, in large part attributed to the horrible service and handle of the situation, that I have ever had. My boyfriend and I arrived at 9:03 pm. ?We were told that we were the first ones there, and that our table was not quite ready. ?We were pointed to wait by the side and to tell them when our 3rd person arrived. ?FORTY EIGHT minutes later, my friend walks up from the basement floor. ?He had arrived probably a minute before us, and told, very explicitly, that he was the first to arrive, and reassured that we would be sent down to join him as soon as we arrived. ?He was apparently sent down to the waiting lounge by someone who never logged him in, and we were never told there was a waiting area. ?As this was our first visit to Morimoto, we weren't aware of a waiting area, or that the lower waiting area would have no phone reception. ?I had began to text and call my friend, actually concerned for his safety because he was typically a punctual person. ? The worst part was, though, that when we realized and talked about this at the reception area, a female who appeared to be some sort of manager LAUGHED in our faces while the guy who told my friend to go downstairs apologized lamely. ? In hindsight, I suppose I'm glad SOMEONE found it funny. ?We were led to our table with no other comment from anyone, and dined for the next two hours with no other comment and address from the management. ? You can imagine how this made us all feel. ?My boyfriend, who only had until 10 pm to eat before he became on call for his job, was unable to enjoy any of his meal because of this late start. ?I was embarrassed to have subjected my friend, who had just flown in, to this poor treatment and service, and so disappointed and frustrated about what transpired. ?I used to live right in West Chelsea and had once seen Chef Morimoto walk by my building, and had highly anticipated coming to his restaurant. And that's not even the end of it. ?About two hours later, after we finished our appetizers and entrees, even our bottle of wine, we were offered by a new waitress who said that because of "our patience," we would be given two prechosen desserts. ?Yes, TWO desserts for the THREE of us. ?And likely prechosen because it was what was left for the week. ?And of course, we were asked if we wanted tea or coffee with that. ? When the bill came, we realized that we were charged for the tea and coffee for the "complimentary" dessert. ? To make matters worse, we also saw that when my boyfriend's fish wasn't available and he had to reorder off the top of his head for a replacement dish (the waitress just waited for him to reorder without offering the menu again), his entree price, from fish to a steak, went from about $30+ to $80. ?The waitress never mentioned this tidbit of information on the price difference. ?My boyfriend also said that for $80, he would have certainly sent back what was supposed to be a medium steak which came extremely well done (i.e. very dry), and which tasted FAR from "wagu" as promised. We had come to Morimoto to test out this place ahead of the visit of our parents and combined five siblings and their spouses next month. ?It's too bad we won't be coming here for that because of our demeaning experience this past Sunday.

The omakase is delicious and an interactive experience, which is what makes this place unique. I got a nice candle with my dessert but the restaurant misunderstood and thought it was my birthday versus my anniversary with my boyfriend, so that was super awkward as it was a pretty big milestone for the two of us. If they got that one minor, yet important detail correct it would have been a 5 star experience. Details is what separates the best from the rest, Morimoto! :( 1st tasting: Toro tartar was delicious - very fresh and came with little scoops of the following - finely sliced chives, sour cream, wasabi, some sort of soy paste, and crispy rice-ish pellets along with a yummy dipping sauce. This was really good and gave my pallet a little bit of a tease. 2nd tasting: Thinly sliced fluke with these tiny mushrooms - this was good too, the sesame oil sauce gave it some saltiness that complimented the fish. 3rd tasting: A very pungent oyster foie gras with uni on top. Wasn't a huge fan but I like how it complimented the 2nd tasting. 4th tasting: Some sort of anchovy-fishy thick sauce that came with little veggies and a piece of bread. Essentially it was fondue. Fun to eat, after a few bites I thought it was too much sauce. - pallet cleanser was this gingerale with lemon and real ginger drink - very zesty and the perfect 'mouthwash'! - 5th tasting: I'm so sad to say that the sushi was no good. The actual sushi was good (5 types, which I forgot) but the rice was a fail. It was hard and didn't melt in my mouth like Yasuda's. 6th tasting: The 'surf and turf' - it's basically galbi with sweet potato glazed in honey. The lobster was seasoned with cajun spices. I'm glad this was there, otherwise I would have left hungry. 7th tasting: Delicious dessert of some sort, I wish I could point out what it was. I could have easily shared it since it was a decent sized soup bowl. It had all these delicious, exotic fruits such as a mini kiwi (yes, it is the size of a grape and I am now obsessed with it), and a few others, which I had no clue what they were.

Been 6 times or so and have had very mixed experiences with both the food and service. Yes, the restaurant is beautiful (check out the bathrooms!) and yes, it's cool when Chef Morimoto makes the rounds and indulges his sycophants with a photo and conversation. BUT unless you're trying to impress an out-of-towner and thus, the scene is more important than the food, I wouldn't bother. The flavor is hit-and-miss, so if you've got the money, get the omakase since you're bound to get some dishes you'll enjoy. I wouldn't have bothered adding yet another review to Yelp but my last dining experience certainly warranted one. I've ordered the sushi here a number of times and it's always decent, but on my last visit the fish wasn't very fresh and something tasted off with the ikura (salmon roe eggs). Even more disturbing was the wasted, unattractive suit who was yelling belligerently at our waitress and was accompanied by what were undoubtedly Russian PROSTITUTES. Grateful for me and my dining companions normal, decent behavior, our waitress thanked us at the end of the meal by SHAKING OUR HANDS. I guess I appreciate the sentiment but I'm sorry, that totally crossed a line. Anyways, I guess you can expect such bizarreness in the meatpacking district (which I therefore avoid as much as possible) but if you want real Japanese food, there are SO many other amazing places to hit up in Manhattan.

Dear Morimoto, Your restaurant looks fabulous with a great ambiance. Everything is super clean, tidy and well organized. But the prices ...well, sir ...are inflated. $35 for one oyster? I tried your tasting menu (8 courses), albeit the plates came out slowly ...the food on each tiny plate didn't even cover half the plate! I was 80% full when I left your place and spent well over $250 per person. I could've had a $15 sushi meal at st.marks and been 90% full than at your restaurant. The dessert, I believe I had the chestnut cake a la mode, gave me the runs. Which leads me to the bathroom... Your toto toilets are awesome. The bathroom is made for a king/queen. It's like the size of a bedroom ...but with soft lights and functions for your bum. I'll most likely try you again, but I wished the prices weren't that steep! Overall, I'd come back again ...just eat something prior. The ambiance is great for conversation amongst friends.

I chose Morimoto as the venue for my graduation dinner celebration with my parents partly because I've always wondered about the legendary Iron Chef's cuisine and partly because of its location and availability. ? 5 stars for service and decor -- The staff was patient with my mom and her million questions about everything. ?The bathroom with the Japanese toilet was awesome. ?They even have really cool cutlery (see picture of the steak knife that looks like a pocketknife)! 4 stars for the food -- It was fresh and delicious but I was kind of expecting more. ?Some of the food was too sweet (the oyster with foie gras and uni was drenched in teriyaki sauce and totally killed it) or salty (the salad course's fondue dip was crazy salty) for me. ?My favorite dish was the much-discussed toro tartare with all the different sauces. ?So pretty and tasty! 2 stars for price -- I know the ingredients are topnotch but these prices are pretty crazy. ?$120/person should buy a lot of seafood. ?While my mom and I were pretty full, I'm sure my dad could've eaten about 9 more courses.

I was very excited to come here on my birthday as I am a huge fan of Morimoto from Iron Chef! ?We were seated right away, during our reservation time. ?I was a little disappointed that we were seated in a corner, by the window next to the street. ?The ambiance of the main dining room looked much grander. ?Nonetheless, the waiters were attentive and we certainly didn't feel disregarded. For starters, we ordered the tuna tartar. ?It was interesting... many people have posted photos, so you can tell that it's a sheet of tuna with condiments on the side. ?I wasn't sure how to eat it, and frankly, I'm still not sure if we did it right. ?The tuna was however, very fresh and delightfully refreshing. ? For main course, we ordered one of the sushi platters (the prices are graded according to how much food you want). ?The sushi we got was again very fresh and we wouldn't have expected any less than perfect. ?Finally, we got a chocolate dessert... I forget the name, but it was beautifully laid out. ? All in all, it was a great dining experience, esp on such a special occasion :) ?But I have to admit I am a bigger fan of smaller, more modest establishments. ?This place was too "modernized" and "Americanized" for me. ?I would suggest Sasabune on UES for those looking for a more authentic sushi experience.

Their beef capriccio is my number 1 choice, of coz their toro tartare is also very delicious. ?If you are looking for sake, try their cold sake (the first one on the menu) forgot the name, but it tastes really smooth. ?Tofu cheescake is a must, love it! Service was great, however it was a little pricy but it worths every penny! ?Enjoy!

My second visit to Morimoto was a great experience, and erased a somewhat lackluster memory of the first visit within the first year of it opening in NYC. ?Inside the dramatic, "rising sun" entrance is a cool dining space, which uses clear panels, water bottles, and other such devices to subdivide areas without compromising light and spaciousness. ?Most of the dining areas are on the main level, with the sleek bar and lounge area down the open stairway. I went with the tasting menu, as I did on my first visit. ?As I remembered, the presentation here is king. ?Whether perched on a bowl of ice or a pile of rocks, most of the dishes were gorgeous to look at. ?In succession, we sincerely enjoyed their signature toro tartare with delicious sauces and toppings, tasty fish carpaccio, unbelievably decadent smooth oyster topped with foie gras and uni, reasonably good sushi, amazing housemade ginger ale (can I take that to go??), surf and turf with sweet lobster and tender wagyu beef. ?The least memorable were a deconstructed salad with heated sauce and the generously sized dessert that was good but not wow. Portions were surprisingly generous and we were quite full afterwards. ?Priced pretty reasonably for what we got. ?This fusion Japanese meal was entertaining and delicious. ?Service was attentive although our server was definitely not seasoned and seemed perplexed if we didn't respond as he expected. ?As I recall, I love their bathroom, multifunctional toilets, and the infinity mirror behind it. It was also nice to see Morimoto himself at the restaurant, when he came out briefly to speak to a table behind us (I'm assuming one could ask for a meeting), and he also asked us how things were (probably because he got stuck trying to squeeze behind my friend's chair to get to the next table). I would definitely return if in the mood for a great fusion experience.

Great restaurant, food, ambience, and most importantly service. ?The staff really takes the time to make sure you're perfectly content with the meal no matter what you have ordered. ?If you're making the reservation online such as Open Table, it's good to see that they actually read the notes about the reservation. ?Have been here on a couple of occasions, once for a special birthday dinner and also during NY Restaurant Week. ?I'll give my review of both visits: Dinner: Enjoyed a nice dinner here back in '08 with a special date. ?Started off with some wine, then proceeded to order a couple of starters including the spicy yellowtail roll and the awesome Morimoto sashimi (an order of thinly sliced seared toro, salmon, eel, tuna, hamachi) ?that is stacked up like a little pizza. ?The sashimi is served with 5 various plastic droppers of different tasty sauces to infuse with each bite of this tasty appetizer. For the main course: 12 oz. australian wagyu filet. ?This was served on a hot iron plate, perfectly seared and oh so tasty. ?I highly recommend it. ?I would love to order this again. ?I had a side of bok choy which was steamed just right. For the dessert, I don't recall at this time and will look back at the photos to find out. Lunch (Pre-Fixe): I think the selection was okay for what you're paying for during restaurant week. ?For a Friday, the place was packed, most likely due to the deal offer. ?Still a pricey lunch, but you'll come out of the restaurant content and it's good time to check out the place if you've never dined there before. ?There were selections of various bento boxes including waygu beef, sea bass, and veggie, in addition to the starter. ?The box included a small bowl with the actual choice selection, sushi on the side, some salad and a side of rice. ?There was a complimentary dessert which was more or less a crème br?lée chiller with a bit of fresh fruit served in small glass, it was tasty and refreshing. In summary, I would definitely like to dine here again. ?I'm especially curious to try the morimoto omakase and his famous ramen soup a.k.a. the "iron chef" chicken noodle soup ?Also, I look forward to the day that I actually get to see him in the restaurant.

Morimoto's needs to go back to where they were. My wife and I had raved about Morimoto's in the past, but after this past visit, its doubtful that we will return. From the service all the way to the food, the quality has considerably lost a step. I'm not saying that we had an awful meal, it just doesn't seem to have its "flair" anymore. This is not a cheap restaurant to go to, and when you finish your meal you want to say "Wow, that was awesome." ? This was not the case. ? I felt like it was barely ok. For a restaurant that carries the name of one of the most innovative Iron Chefs, you would think that maybe they would update the menu. Like i said earlier, its not like it was...there's tons of great restaurants in New York to discover.

First of all, I want to clarify that I'm Asian (Chinese) and I went with my brother and Chinese friend. We are all used to Asian food (tasty but not overly salty). By no means, we don't like bland food - the right combination is the art of food. :) I was really excited about going to Morimoto's (celebrity chef and I'm a fan of the Food Network) and wanted to try Morimoto's restaurant. I've read the reviews and thought it was for me and my friends. I've read one Yelper mentioned that Morimoto's Iced Tea was great (which I agreed & was the best part of my meal). We ordered the Tempura Shrimp, Claim Miso Soups, Ramen Soup (Chicken Noodle Soup), Seafood 'toban yaki', a Trout dish (I can't quite remember the name), wagyu beef sashimi. We were recommended by the waitress the Tempura Shrimp (which she raves that it was delicious). My friend and I thought it was over breaded. The soups was so SALTY! The clam was big in the Clam Miso Soup but you couldn't really taste the sweetness of the clam. My brother snuck some water into his ramen soup and he said that had tone down the salt! We were both not very impress by our meals. My friend's seafood 'to ban yaki' looked ok. It had shrimp with the heads (which we generally love), half of a lobster, some crab legs, scallops. I thought the crab leg was okay but I think if you're wanting to be wow by the seafood, you may have better luck with a restaurant that is by the waterfront that knows how to cook their seafood. The trout dish was a sear dish. It was too fishy for me.You're probably wondering why I ordered the fish dish when I didn't care for the fishy taste. But I've had fish dishes that are not so overpowering in their fish taste. The trout reminded me of Salmon. I took a couple bites of it and was done. My friend told me to eat a couple more bites (which I did) to avoid being rude. LOL. But I didn't like it. And I did feel bad. I hate to waste food and waste money. This may also be just me but I wasn't too impress by our waitress. She was nice but I felt that she was somewhat snotty (lack of a better word). We're in our late 20s (my brother is in his early 20s) so maybe, she didn't think she was going to get tip well? My friend thought the same but my brother did not. The manager made his presence at our table (approved the professionalism there). ?It's definitely a classy restaurant (love the decor and the bathroom). I gave one star for the food and one star for the decor. When the waitress asked if we want dessert, we kindly declined (I didn't want to spent any more money on food that I would be disappointed at). I don't mind spending money on excellent food. But our food was not excellent. Hindsight is 20/20. If you asked me if I would go back, I would not. ?If I didn't go, I would always wonder how good Morimoto's restaurant is. Oh well. Now that I've went, I know that it's nothing to rave about. I really wished that I would have loved this place. :-( And really - all people is different so I wish better luck to you and you visit! To give you an idea of what I've had to give you a gage of my taste: I thought Mesa Grill was okay - would give it a 3 star, Cactus Club Cafe (food was okay but love the atmosphere - almost reminds me of Morimoto). ?Love Love Love seafood in Sai Kung.

Ah, finally, I get to try the Iron Chef's food! The restaurant is very hip and beautiful, and the food was overall delicious... BUT, I think that some of the dishes were highly overrated and not worth the price tag. Toro tartare - the dish that everyone RAVES about -- I thought it was completely overrated. Yes, the presentation was nice.. but if you think about it, it's just like negitoro (minus the negi -- green onion -- part), on a wooden block. The dipping "sauce" was just soba dipping sauce, I think. The 5 types of sauces? Everyday household stuff, like rice crackers, seaweed paste (the kind that I grew up eating on rice.. they sell them in jars, CHEAP, at any Japanese market!), guacamole, sour cream... come on. Not special. Is that really worth $31? Is the caviar even necessary? However, their baked oyster with uni and seared foie gras, doused in teriyaki sauce, was AWESOME. It was so good that I had to order a second plate. I can't say no to foie.. The kakuni (stewed pork belly) appetizer? Also awesome. Melt-in-your-mouth pork, with SO much flavor! My black cod with a ginger-soy reduction was great! It was flavorful, and the fish was nice and tender. However.. it's a very simple dish to make. Is it really worth the price tag? Then again, even Nobu's miso-glazed cod is also uber-easy to make, so I guess it's standard at these Japanese fusion restaurants. The sea bass was.. well.. not as good. The fish itself was amazing - a nice, thick slab of bass, super moist and flaky. However, the flavoring just paled in comparison to the cod, because it was a lot more subtle. Dessert - Tofu "hot and cold" - A tofu cheesecake, along with a tofu souffle. Both were amazing... If I could eat these every day, I could totally be a vegetarian. 'Nuff said. So why not 5 stars? Yea, the price tag. A lot of these dishes were very cheap to make... I don't know if it justifies the price. Also, really guys, do you have to charge $6 for a BOWL OF PLAIN WHITE RICE? Nothing says pretentious, overpriced restaurant more than that!

I had the $25 bento box lunch special, plus tried some of their appetizers and rolls. Everything was delicate and delicious. In the past 7 years, I've enjoyed sushi, but wouldn't go out of my way for it. I didn't crave it and didn't understand the fascination associated with it. After Morimoto, I get it. It's delicate, tender, subtle and good fish is amazing. I've since had other amazing sushi experiences in NYC and San Francisco. Five stars for the beautiful atmosphere, good service, good bento box, and for introducing me to awesome sushi.

Prices aside, this place deserves 5 stars. ?I took my girlfriend here for her bday and she was WOW'd. ?We were going to do the tasting menu but figured we would get more value from ordering individual dishes and we were right. ?The Toro tartare was amazing as was the spicy king crab. ?We also got a yellowtail roll and the wagyu rib eye which were both melt in your mouth good. ?The only thing that we weren't impressed with was the oysters foie gras which were too large (normally this is a good thing but not here) and fishy tasting for our liking. ?Besides that one mis-step, everything was really REALLY good. ? If I could afford it, I would eat here once a week. ?Since I can't, it will have to be a yearly treat. ?And what a treat it is!

I blame Nobu Matsuhisa. ?His Nobu franchise perfected one of the great joys in life by producing the popcorn addictive-like rock shrimp dish. ?That very memorable moment was so many years ago where his band of rock shrimp TKO'd me. ?I have since longed for Nobu to invite me back for a rematch, but he was just too busy for me. ?Instead I got a call from Morimoto, who invited me for one night. ?I accepted. I came ready with my salivating mouth and a desire to eat some rock shrimp damn-it. ?I didn't care that it was my first appetizer and that all the other dishes were still to follow. ? For all intents and purposes, this was my main event. ?The battle was now. ?Rock shrimp, rock shrimp and more rock shrimp. Morimoto's plate of rock shrimp came out to please. ?Plentiful and split into two sauce-coated varieties. ?They came to attack my taste buds on all fronts. ?My eyes lit up as they came rolling onto the table. ?My years of patiently waiting was finally here. ?I took the offensive and quickly downed one from the wasabi camp. ?It was...eh, okay. ?I took along swing and went right at the kochujan camp. ?It, too, was...ok. ?I kept popping, one wasabi, one kochujan. ?But it was no match, my mind did not desire to eat more of this plate. ?Too much taste of the batter and the sauces were both a little overwhelming. I now look for my rematch at Nobu. As for the undercard results: Spicy King Crab - 6 or 7 leg chunks spiced nicely. ?Good deal of meat and not too messy to put down. ?4 out of 5. Toro Tartare - interesting blend of tuna fat with variety of sauces. ?Method of eating it was more interesting than the actual taste. ?3 out of 5. Sea Bass - a bit overcooked and sauce gave it a spoiled taste. ?2 out of 5. Surf and Turf - beef was tender but not savory. ?avocado, citrus-induced halibut was great. ?potatoes were too many and just a weird choice here. ?4 out of 5. Dessert: Hot and Cold Tofu - the tofu like cheesecake was outstanding. ?so fluffy and light. ?presented along with vanilla ice cream and souffle, it was the winner of the night. ?5 out of 5. Chocolate Macadamia Nut bar - too many of the same chocolate pastries. ?too heavy and not enough variety. ?3 out of 5.

I've been here a few times and tried the omakase, which is a lot of food. ?Love the toro tatare, which I found out about on the Best Thing I Ever Ate. Beautiful fancy restrooms, with a view of cherry blossoms or something like that.

My friend and I stopped by for lunch whille we were in the city a few weeks ago. I've always wanted to dine at Morimoto since I am a huge fan of the Iron Chef. However, after a less than satisfactory experience at Nobu, I had my doubts. Nonetheless, after reading several negative reviews on Yelp, I decided that I wanted to come to a verdict on my own. Toro tartare: plating was gorgeous; however, the dish itself is completely overrated to say the least. The only reason it's accompanied by the plethora of sauces is so you can't taste how mediocre and bland the toro is. If you enjoy paying $35 in order to play with your food, then by all means go for it. Wagyu beef bento box : Besides the nigiri sushi,everything including the wagyu beef were placed in white ceramic bowls, which made it very difficult to cut the the beef. The beef was tasty but was it really "wagyu"....i seriously doubt it. Nigiri sushi and miso soup were standard, while the veggie tempura were overly greasy and the salad was nothing but a mess of wilted greens and fried onions. The only highlight of the bento box was the dessert, Mandarin Panna Cotta. The fresh berries and tangy syrup really balanced out the creaminess of the panna cotta. My own verdict: Heated toilet seats are totally not worth $45.

I went here with my boyfriend a couple months ago and was impressed by the creative and fresh dishes that Morimoto had to offer. For appetizers we had the toro tartare. Very unique and interactive way to eat sushi. The toro came on a wooden palate that we had to scoop off with metal scrapper-like utensils. We could pair the toro caviar mixture with different condiments as well. We also had the whitefish carpaccio which was very delicate, clean, and light. The japanese lobster fritters were good, but not spectacular. For main course my boyfriend ordered the 16oz wagyu NY and I had the sea bass. Both were very good, cooked perfectly....but ?these dishes would not be the reason I will be coming back to Morimoto. We also ordered a platter of sashimi that came so late after our main dishes that we were already pretty full. But when they finally brought the food to us we found they were nigiri and not sashimi. We sent the platter back and what returned were generous cuts of fish! I don't know if this is their normal serving portions ( I hope!) but they were soo fresh and delicious! After dinner we ordered desserts, and the manager came to apologize for the sashimi mistake and comped both our desserts! The desserts were fabulous!!! And such a surprise and perfect ending to our amazing meal! My experience with restaurants have usually been....if they are great with the dinner course they are usually weak in the dessert or vice versa. But Morimoto's desserts are just as strong and delicious as their dinner selections. The pairings of sweet and unique flavors and their play on textures was a delightful experience!

5 GREAT REASONS TO VISIT MORIMOTO: 1. It's the celebrity Iron Chef's namesake restaurant in NYC. 'Nuff said. 2. The Morimoto omakase. Subtle and delicate at times and creative and complex at others, the omakase will charm you, thrill you, and pamper you from delectable beginning (toro tartare) to sweet end (tofu cheesecake). 3. The Oyster Foie Gras. Ok, I know I already listed the food as #2 but the Oyster Foie Gras is worth mentioning as its own reason. Oh Morimoto, you sir, are a genius. Steamed oyster + foie gras + uni = one amazingly perfect bite! http://www.yelp.com/biz_… 4. The eye candy. The omakase is a feast for the eyes as much as it is a feast for the tummy. The presentation of each course was gorgeous, like little works of art to match the sleek and modern interior of the restaurant. http://www.yelp.com/biz_… 5. The bathroom. O M G, the bathroom! Let the fancy schmancy Japanese toilet beckon you into a stall with its sensor lid. Settle down on the warmed seat, take your time, and don't pass up on the chance to experiment with the button panel. But I have to say, as cool as the toilets are, what I really love about the bathroom is this: http://www.yelp.com/biz_… Zen. *My only disappointment was that Morimoto wasn't in the house. I would have liked to meet him. Perhaps next time...

Morimoto delivers a prestigious experience worthy of his iron chef status. The restaurants decor reminded me of a high class glass hotel of sorts, with a somewhat mysterious entrance. Theres not many parenthetically Japanese or asian style nods, the space looks more like a showroom with private booths complete with a big downstairs bar. Be sure to visit the restrooms while your there but put your back into the sliding door, they're a rep or two into a work out. The food! The foooood. The only negative part of the omakase menu is its quantities, every dish left you begging for more! The tasting menu changes often and if you are a repeat guest they can change the tasting menu to be completely different. All the dishes let the ingredients speak for themselves while amplifying their flavors with accents from morimotos quiver of techniques and sauces. While your there id recommend getting the iced tea its a mixture of a japanese soft drink berries and tea etc. I can't wait to go back for another experience my party left with all smiles but one of the party members needed some gray's papaya to fill their belly. Haha.

MORIMOTO IS GOD. The Sashimi combo $120- A variety of chef selected sashimi on a huge bambo plater thing. There were at least 10 kinds of fish. It included uni, sea urchin, which is something I generally avoid whenever I'm in a Japanese restaurant. I never liked the taste of it, it's always too fishy for me and I hate the texture. But the uni sashimi at Morimoto was actually good. I don't know how he managed to make uni good, but he's Morimoto so I guess that makes sense. The Tuna Tartar- recommended by our waiter, who is really nice and super patient as my family doesn't speak very much English so I had to translate what he said to them and translate what my family wanted to say to him, which took a long time. The tuna tartar was really nice, you scrape the tuna up and scrape some side sauce on it and the flavor was just wonderful. It's also kinda fun to eat this dish. The Morimoto Sashimi- I originally saw a picture of this on yelp and I didn't know what it was, I only knew that it looks amazing and that I was going to order it when I go to Morimoto. So I described what I saw to the waiter: It's colorful, looks like little blocks, and has salmon on the first layer, and he knew what I was talking about. It came with little squeezing things with 5 different dipping sauce. It's aesthetically appealing and it melts in your mouth. It's sooo good. We also got this deep fried dish that the waiter recommended but that wasn't the best thing. It was sweet and sour, kinda like sweet and sour chicken but I think it was shrimp. The California Roll+The Soft Shell Crab Roll- average-good. but the DESERTS were AMAZING!!! I forgot the name of this one but it's some caramel ice cream/caramel/nuts, beautiful presentation. Warm Chocolate Cake! with caramel popcorn, japanese dark sugar syrup, rhubarab sauce, and sweet corn ice cream with tons of fresh berries!!- Really sweet but really good. The Sorbet Trio was also really good. minus the basil lime flavor. That one was kind of gross. Soy Milk Souffle, Tofu Cheesecake, maple ice cream- Nicely done, eat everything together, soo good. They also have a good selection of wine. We got some Riesling and whites and they went nicely with the sea food.

Iron Chef or not, sadly the food didn't live up to the hype. I am a big fan of Mr. Morimoto on Iron Chef. In fact, I celebrated my 21st birthday with friends at Morimoto because of his revolutionary culinary talents. I think the food was delicious and elegantly presented at the table. We ordered the following: Appetizers: Crispy Rock Tempura. Toro Tartar. Oyster Foie Gras. Morimoto Sashimi. Yellowtail Pastrami. Japanese Lobster Fritter. Everyone was pleased with the appetizers. Entrees: Duck, Duck, Duck (okay, Peking Duck anyone?). Sea Bass (nom nom). Braised Black Cod (yummy). Seafood ?Toban Yaki (double yummy), Surf & Turf (okay) and Roasted Ocean Trout (good). The seafood is fresh and seasoned perfectly with a hint of flavor. Desserts: Warm Chocolate Cake, Apple Turban, Sesame Hazelnut Layer Cake and Tofu "Hot and Cold." ?The Chocolate Cake takes the prize. In my humble opinion, I didn't have an amazing culinary experience but I would go back perhaps to try the Omakase Dinner in the near future. I am certainly willing to give it another chance.

Beautiful restaurant with beautiful food. For appetizers, Beef wagyu carpaccio and fresh buffalo mozzarella were both amazingly delicious. ? Mozzarella was definitely a pleasant surprise, I did not expect to have the tastiest little mozzarella balls here. ? Tuna pizza was good but not mind blowing. ?Rock shrimp was but heavily battered and too filling for an appetizer. ?If I come back I'd skip to save room for the sushi and fish entrees. ? For entrees, the sea bass was biggest stand out. ?It just melts in your mouth. ?Amazing. ? Someone at my table said "wow" outloud after having a bite. Cod was also very good - probably the best miso cod I've had. The sushi was delicious and fresh. ?Every single piece. ? I think we got the chef combination so I'm not sure what was included. ? I do remember trying the uni - ?I've had uni before at other restaurants and hated it. ?I tried it here and actually enjoyed it. ? We kept getting more orders of spicy yellowtail and spicy salmon rolls. ?We were all full but yet there was always room for one more roll... Cocktails were also very good - the white orchid was a little sweet, but the orange blossom was delicious and refreshing. ?There was another one with crushed ice and muddled blackberries that was really good but I can't recall the name. All in all, Morimoto lives up to the hype. ?I'd love to be back soon to have the sea bass again and try other dishes (looking at you, oyster foie gras, duck, and toro tartare!)

Curry beef bread- yummy comfort food. Lobster fitter- tasty, but not much in the way of lobster. Trout- meh. my favorite part was the pickled veg ontop. Cocktail-Hibiscus- you cant go wrong with Lychee. Very good, a drink any girl would like to dive into. Flourless chocolate cake- perfect ending! warm, super chocolaty, tons of texture AND the pear sorbet is delicious ( i wouldve liked a bowl of it to walk out with). Great service. Our waiter was able to loosen up and made our experience that much better. Ambiance is great as well. Be sure to visit the funky bathroom and maybe come early to your reservation in order to sit at the bar downstairs- its pretty dark, and sexy down there.

The toro tartare is good, but maybe I had it a little too hyped out for me that it didn't really WOW me? Anyways, I ordered the duck, duck, duck for the main course. It was good, but the croissant that was suppose to have a foie gras butter on it, just tasted like any ordinary croissant but more buttery. Don't get me wrong, it was good, but I was a little disappointed that it didn't have any foie gras taste. When it came to the desserts, I liked the strawberry mascarpone cheesecake because it had a lot of different flavors going for it. I wasn't too big of a fan of the hibiscus madelines on the side, but everything else was refreshing. I definitely liked the rose flavored strawberries! All in all, I'd come again to try other dishes, but not so much for that waitress (YUCK!). Pushy much?

This is one of my absolute favorite restaurants in NYC. I'll be in Manhattan next week for a photoshoot and you can bet that after a period of dieting and slimming down for the shoot you will find me at Morimotos that night enjoying my favorite dishes there: the rock shrimp and chicken soup. I know, the dishes sound too simple for such a venue and it's not even sushi (although I love sushi) but the rock shrimp is so light and delicious you don't even miss the sushi component from dinner. The chicken soup has an excellent broth and the noodles are handmade in-restaurant. I had the pleasure of meeting Iron Chef Masaharu Morimoto in 2010 at the South Beach Food & Wine Festival grand tasting in the Fontainebleau. I'm generally not one to get star-struck as I have worked with various athletes and celebrities but I have to admit that I was a little star-struck with Chef Morimoto. I told him how much I loved his NYC restaurant and he was so gracious, humble, and sweet. It made me appreciate his food even more. Go to Morimotos in the meatpacking district and enjoy your experience :)

Came for lunch. When we first approached the restaurant, we thought it was closed, as it had giant cloth banners hanging in front of the door. However, once we stepped beyond the cloth, the doors slid open and proved us wrong. The decor is streamlined and simplistic. The place was rather empty - not many people here during lunchtime on a Saturday. The waitress was courteous and attentive and promptly brought my requested pot of tea with honey. For sushi, she recommended the chu-toro over the oh-toro, and we also got the scallop. In addition, I ordered a spicy tuna handroll. The sushi was really good. We then had the wagyu beef carpaccio, which was decent although non-conventional. For starters, the beef was half cooked on one side, and the slices were not so traditionally thin. However, the sauce was pretty good. For main, my friend ordered the sea bass, and we both agreed it was one of the best sea bass we have had in the city. I had the seafood toban yaki, a huge stew dish that comes with rice. The broth was good, but the seafood inside was a bit overcooked. The scallops were a bit rubbery, and the shrimp was rather tasteless. Would like to return and try more of the menu.

The food was good, but I must admit not worth the hefty bill. Upon arrival, we were quickly seated in a dark and scary corner. ?After my husband spoke with one of the hostesses, our seat was quickly changed. We ordered the prix fixe and literally waited 30 minutes between ?each course- I timed it. I did not want to complain to my husband, but come on...30 minutes between courses?!?! Shortly after our second course, the hubby became aggravated and mentioned his disappointment to our server who was apologetic but was not remorseful enough to speed up his service. He passed our table at least a dozen times and didn't even notice the empty plates. To the servers defense, he really had too many tables to service that particular night- his tables should have been split between two servers. I blame management for understaffing on a Friday evening. The most terrible part? We couldn't enjoy our dessert because we had to be at a jazz concert that began at 10pm, which we ended up being late to anyway due to the slloooowww service we received. Shame on you Morimoto! When one makes a reservation for 7pm, they should not leave at 10:15 without enjoying their dessert!!!!

Disclosure: not a sushi lover...so this is for service + ambiance, my friends comments on the sushi and the meat i ate. i think for the "hype" i was a little underwhelmed -- took my friend there for her birthday dinner. my intention was to get her very excited, since she loooves sushi *yes, i had ulterior motives* but it didnt just quite do it for her. it was ok. and from my pov, the service was just ok too, nothing to write home about. thankfully i wasn't depending on just the sushi to get the job done, i remembered to bring my charm...so the night wasn't totally wasted. overall...will go back - if i had to...but wont be on the top of my list for repeats in 2012

We really loved the combination of food + drama for a special occasion dinner. Try the more complex dishes please. You will be rewarded with the theatrics of the presentation. Everything was tasty to be honest. Sashimi was fabulous, lobster and tofu special amazing and the biminbap(sp) was so well prepared. As previously noted, save room for desserts and even though some sound like odd pairings, they are so fine - and so worth it. Only downside for us is the bathrooms are downstairs so one in our party had an leg injury making this difficult. Everything else was swell including the very experienced servers who were fun and not annoying or cloying. Nice experience we will not forget soon...

3.5 stars...ok ok I know that sounds a bit harsh right?? But with someone as world renowned as Chef Morimoto, I came in with high expectations, and was expecting to be blown away. While $120 for omakaze is pretty reasonable, I was unimpressed by Morimoto's tasting menu (with a few exceptions...) I was waiting to be blown away by japanese technique and innovative dishes that would knock my socks off. While the quality of food was excellent, I was underwhelmed with what was being featured in the omakase. Truthfully, it seemed as if Morimoto was dumbing it down for us Americans and showcased Americanized versions of Japanese classics. (and some dishes were simply not Japanese at all) I will say that the first course of toro DID blow me away. It came beautifully presented on a mini washboard looking contraption, different accoutrement, and beautiful beautiful fresh toro. This was the perfect start to the meal, but it raised the bar for the rest of the meal....and the rest of the meal was good, but not memorable. ? I would say that I would come back for a la carte menu items, but not the omakase. That way I can choose on my own and venture into Morimoto's little world. I would definitely try it again, but not the omakase. Note: I do remember, however, (which may have had something to do with my experience) that I had a cold and was not feeling 100% myself. However, I also remember the diners I went with sharing my same sentiment (who were not sick). Who knows!? Maybe this just means I should give good ol Morimoto another chance =)

"That don't impress me much" was the feeling we left with this iron chef establishment ... We are in awe of the master chef and were keen on visiting his restaurant to experience the magic he creates on television .. We got there close to midnight on a saturday night and it was packed with people .. little did I imagine that a reservation would be handy at this time .. after being seated at the sushi bar for a bit we ultimately made our way to the main dining area ... The service was top notch although the restaurant was busy .. Our cocktail was amazing (lychee based) .. highly recommended !!! For appetizer we had the lamb carpaccio with shiso buds, scallion-ginger dressing was the perfect start to our meal .. We were a bit apprehensive since we were not sure about the gaminess of the lamb but our server reassured us of it ... we also had a spicy yellowtail roll and this time did a better job with the chopsticks :) For entrees we went with the signature angry chicken with spicy chicken jus .. we ordered some extra jus since we felt the chicken was on the drier side .. We also went with the sea bass with sweet sake kasu, japanese eggplant, miso but we were disappointed with the cloying sweetness of this dish ... For dessert we had the Crème de Chocolate, Caramel Almonds, Caramel Apricot Sauce, Almond Foam, Praline, and Caramel Ice Cream. It certainly was not the most memorable dessert we've ever tasted but good nonetheless ... The best part of the experience was the futuristic toilet downstairs which took me by surprise .. piece of art!!! wish all the food lived upto its hype as well ..

I love this restaurant! It's a place that's upscale and classy without taking itself too seriously. The decor is clean, simple, but not cheap-looking and has some funky pieces to keep it fun. The bathrooms unnerve me a little but others would probably find it cool. The food reflects the same attitude. I tried the toro tartare which had an amazing melt-in-your-mouth texture and came with an array of garnishes so you can customize each bite. I had some problems with the serving "paddle" so to speak because the tartare didn't always want to stay on it. However, that detail is really irrelevant in light of the awesomeness of this appetizer. I also tried the yellowtail pastrami out of sheer curiosity - it's fun. Probably not my favorite but where else will you get this? The yellowtail bim bap (or whatever it's called) was good and I would order it again. The surf and turf was not my favorite. The potatoes on the side were too rich for my taste and they ended up being the only unfinished part of the meal. Overall, I am completely satisfied with my experience here! Food was good and plentiful and the ambiance flawless. Love morimoto!

(Yeah, yeah, the food was awesome. Skip down to the bottom where it says "Food." if that's what you care about.) I had the pleasure of eating lunch here with three lovely ladies, all of whom returned from the bathroom raving. Despite not having to do any business, I had to see this for myself. (I would like to note that it has a sliding door; I pushed and pulled and then waited outside an unoccupied bathroom for longer than I'd care to admit.) Now, I once had a friend call me "fancy," because I insisted he close the door while he "took the Browns to the Super Bowl." (Yes, he IS from Texas, how did you know?) But he didn't even know what [bathroom] fancy was, because he's never been to Morimoto. My friends, this is a bathroom unlike any other. The stalls (although calling them such does not do them justice) are magical; you are instantly transported to a peaceful forest, with birds chirping encouragingly. The seat will lower as you walk in, as if it was waiting for you, and only you, to arrive. It will be pleasantly warm when you sit down. There is a panel of buttons on your right. If you press said buttons...let's just say you will experience delights you had previously known only in college, when you got drunk with that girl from St. Louis and things got out of hand. You will most likely giggle. You will not want to get up. I know, because I didn't. I came into Morimoto last Thursday, and I'm still sitting on this toilet, writing this review. My legs are starting to cramp. I don't know if it's day or night, and I'm getting all my news here: http://www.yelp.com/topi… Please contact my family, and let them know that I'm all right. *** Food. For starters, skip the mixed green salad. It was beautiful, but nothing special. Go for the miso soup. If it tasted half as good as it's otherworldly aroma, it is the best...around! Nothing's going to keep it down. The sushi was perfect. With sublime confidence, the waiter encouraged us to order anything we've had anywhere, assuring us that theirs will be better. And he was right. The fish was fresh and plentiful, rolled expertly with the ideal amount of rice. The wasabi melted away into the soy sauce, but both were completely unnecessary because the fish is perfect on its own. The black cod was light and fresh and flavorful. The beef gyudon that I got to try was also very nice, but if you have the choice, the black cod is certainly the winner. I also saw a sashimi salad that looked better than any sashimi salad has ever looked. Ever. It's certainly pricey, but if you have the means, I highly recommend it.

Growing up is the process of revoking, one after the other, the principles espoused by the You of Yore. "I will never, ever let work impede on my quality of life." "Taxis are wasteful." "I will never, ever smoke cigarettes." "I hate the Meatpacking District." I was fumbling for a cigarette as I paid the cabbie, scowling, because I got held up at work and was late for dinner. The High Line was slumbering overhead and saucy Del Posto was sulking across 10th Avenue, when glass doors and red curtains parted, and principle, Parliaments, and prejudices all fell away as I was admitted into a glimmering, lavish dream sequence of a future perfect. I spotted my assigned patron god to this elysian paradise seated at the bar. He turned to greet me -I saw that he'd assumed the snappy form of Chun L. in business formal- as beautiful women floated by to take my coat, pour me water, smile. He led me up to an airy, gleaming dining room where a partition made of the silver-green souls of screenwriters-turned-bond-traders seemed to undulate under a light that was at once soft and bright. My patron god (his body is his temple) genially allowed me a seat with a view of the open kitchen. From here, I observed an effortlessly smart-seeming patronage at the height of their powers: young, rich, elegant, charming, hopeful. No jostling elbows, or spilled food or drink, or outdoor voices. Instead: spacious, gracious laughter, repartee, mild celebration. ? I sipped chenin blanc, while we ordered a smorgasbord of giant appetizers to serve as our meal - rock shrimp tempura, Iron Chef ramen, ten-hour-pork over congee, foie gras oysters, and a trio of maki rolls (which, in light of the feast that preceded it, went a little neglected). The oysters (blanched, and served with seared foie gras and a dollop of uni) was the culinary carnation of an orgasm. Food tastes like orgasms here! The rest was tasty and beautiful, if not nearly so special. Following dinner, I ordered several delicious, calpico-sweetened, yuzu-infused cocktails at the bar downstairs - which was clean and gleaming - heaven's afterparty. It soon came time to be spit back out into the grimy, burnt-black world outside Morimoto. When the angel at the entrance handed me my coat, and asked if I'd had a nice evening. I almost fell into her arms, weeping. Don't even get me started on the bathrooms.

FINALLLLLLLY!!! After always talking about Morimoto I finally made it!!! And I'm really mad at myself for taking so long!!! This is now in my top 10 fav restaurants!!! Though we missed our original reservations they accommodated us with a later reservation which worked out perfect since one of our buddies was running late. Let's start off with décor!! Very elegant and very simple! From what I remember high ceilings and simple modern settings. Service was good ?our waitress was very knowledgeable and was on point! FOOOOOD!!! Amazing Appetizer Tuna Pizza - This was good but I've had better Japanese infused Pizza but it did tease my palette with the texture and spicy kick Calamari Tempura Salad - A yummy salad with great texture and the dressing was very light and not over powering the salad was large enough to feed 4 people! Spicy King Crab - If you like the Spicy Mussels they serve at the other Japanese restraurnat you will love this!! One of my fav dishes Tempura Shrimp Thing done 2 ways - This actually reminded me of Walnut prawns with a wasabi kick!! Was good but probably wouldn't order this again Entrees Sea Bass - ?Was biggest stand out. ?It just melts in your mouth. ?Amazing Surf and Turf - PASS I've had better steak and this just couldn't stand up to the Sea Bass or The Black Cod Black Cod - was also very good - probably the best miso cod I've had Morimoto I will be visiting again once I'm in town!! I totally adore you :)

Glass, white granite and a spaceship-like interior greats you with a big 'ol veneered smile. The clean, fresh feeling in Morimoto is an excellent compliment to the fish and delicate Japanese dishes. Seated at our table of four for lunch, I appreciated the glass dividers between the tables which created a sense of exposed privacy. Our waiter was incredibly quick with water and advice. Though it was restaurant week he encouraged us to try to bento boxes since they were a better bang for your buck. I love the honesty there. For $24 I ordered the black cod bento box, one of the discounted sakes and our table shared the spicy tuna and uni avocado rolls. Starting with the sake, cool and perfectly sweet - well chosen by the restaurant. Both rolls were incredible and though they were pretty common maki options, I really had never tried a better version of either roll. The bento box included: - miso soup: the tofu was filmy and soft, fragrance was drool-worthy - salad: didn't really try it, nothing special - a soft-shell crab maki roll accompanied by tuna, shrimp, and salmon nigiri - teriyaki black cod with a few sweet red beans: omg...yum - vegetable and shrimp tempura: again, I actually felt like it was the best version of tempura I've ever had. Not greasy and perfect crunch. One drawback was the mayo-like sauce at the bottom...reminded me of...something else. Finally, I have to give the bathrooms some well-deserved attention. The robot toilet is my new best friend. Open lid, wash, dry, oscillate (?), and a pat on the ass. The pat didn't happen but it would have been nice. My first purchase when I make my millions (by the age of 30) will be one of these Japanese robot toilets. Go for the food, stay for the potty.

First off, I have to say I'm disappointed and sad that we did not get to see the Iron Chef himself. Where was Mr. Morimoto himself? Hiding? :( Secondly, this is my 400th review. I saved it for something special: Morimoto's Thirdly, I have to say Morimoto's isn't that close to a metro stop. We still had to walk after getting off at 8th Av. Don't do it in heels. Here's the front of Morimoto's: http://static.px.yelp.co… Stairs leading downstairs: http://static.px.yelp.co… We arrived about 15 mins after our reservation time and we were asked to go downstairs to the bar area to wait. We sat at the bar and ordered two drinks: one was a lychee martini (forget the name) and the other was called 'SnapDragon.' For $14 a drink, it better be F-ing TASTY! And sure enough, it was. I enjoyed both drinks. We were shortly escorted to our first booth. The lighting was dim, I felt cramped, and I couldn't enjoy the full effect of being in Morimoto's restaurant http://static.px.yelp.co…. We quickly spotted an open table in the middle of the restaurant and asked if we could move there. Wish granted! Our server, Delilah was seriously THE BOMB. She deserved over a 20% tip!! She explained everything as if she had tasted them all before. She gave us her suggestions and gave us an honest answer about all the dishes. She was spot on about giving us napkins, new plates, refills, etc. The one thing she was backed up on was not giving us our utensils when our main dish came out. She came by and apologized. I told her it was alright but she said she wanted to acknowledge that she was behind in serving us. I have to say she was the most courteous server I've ever experienced. Here's what we had, in order! And we skipped out on Omakase because it was $120.00 a person. Maybe next time! :) TORO TARTARE http://static.px.yelp.co… This plate gets the best presentation award for the night! The toro was sitting in a bowl of ice accompanied by 6 different dipping sauces: wasabi, sour cream, nori paste (seaweed), chives, guac, and Japanese crackers. The dish was adorned with a small scoop of caviar, a purple orchid and a small green peach. We didn't know what the small green ball was at first and when the bus boys came by to take it, he told us that the green ball was a Japanese peach and that we should eat it. We surely did. But the toro tartare was soft, butter, and so good. My rec. is a spoon full of the toro, nori paste, chives, and the Japanese crackers. SOFT SHELL CRAB MAKI http://static.px.yelp.co… I have to admit this has probably got to be the best tasting soft shell crab maki I've had. You can actually taste the crab unlike most other rolls where the flavor of the rice and sauce mask the soft shell crab. SPICY HAMACHI MAKI http://static.px.yelp.co… The hamachi melted in my mouth! I was definitely a fan. The spicy sauce wasn't too spicy so for those who fear it, I wouldn't be fearful of this dish. SURF & TURF http://static.px.yelp.co… Kobe Filets & Hamachi Ribbons. I have to add that this was probably the worst presentation that Morimoto's had. Anyway, the potatoes it came with were so delicious. Every bite bursted in your mouth (that's what she said)!! The kobe beef was juicy and cooked well -- but I wish it had some sort of steak sauce to go with it. The hamachi was mixed with this sauce and avocados, which goes well by itself, or with a spoonful of rice. With a spoonful of rice, the hamachi and avos turn into maki! SEAFOOD TOBANYAKI http://static.px.yelp.co… Half shell lobster, king crab, mussel, clam, diver scallop in a red miso sake broth. The miso sake broth was TO DIE FOR. The BF loves miso soup and he really enjoyed this dish. He compared it to an Italian Cioppino but instead this would be a Japanese Cioppino. The seafood that was incorporated in this dish was fresh. You could definitely taste it. Our server recommended us to have this with a bowl of rice, and she definitely made a good suggestion. WARM CHOC CAKE + POPCORN ICE CREAM http://static.px.yelp.co… Wait what? POPCORN ICE CREAM? This was sweet and salty at the same time and it definitely had a weird kick to it. The warm chocolate cake reminded me of a lava cake minus the choc goodness that would flow out from a lava cake. This dessert was good, but definitely was not the star of the night. I really enjoyed dinner and we spent about 2.5 hours dining. Not to mention a fight we witnessed inside!! I love fine dining especially when it comes with impeccable service and delicious food. Definitely check out the bathrooms! Anyway, $220 total w/ tax & a generous tip. I'll be back to Morimoto's.

I've got a pretty easy math problem for you all, Yelpers. QUESTION: Do all these elements add up to a worthwhile dining experience? ? 3 apps (Toro Tartare, Morimoto Sashimi, Oysters drowned in sauce) + 1 entree (Prettied up Peking duck in disguise) + 1 sake flight + Heavy hand of Celebrity Chefdom + Sexy (or just dark) interior _______________________ = $140 before tip for 2 people ANSWER: A) Sure, because your pockets are full of gold and your stomach is the size of a pea. B) No, because it's not the Iron Chef himself. C) Maybe, because who knows what the heck Asian Fusion is supposed to be anyways?! D) None of the above, because it doesn't make sense. What do you think I chose?

We sat down for a no-holds-barred, splurge of a meal. All four of us ordered omakase (chef's choice). In addition, we ordered the black cod to come out with the main course. For drinks, we ordered the Morimotini, White Lily, Hydrangea and an Asahi. The Morimotini said it had wasabi infused vodka, but it just tasted like cucumber vodka. I couldn't taste wasabi at all. The White Lily and Hydrangea were both delicious. The Hydrangea is a super fruity drink and a good option for those who don't like to taste the alcohol. It's hard not to be swayed by the decor and vibe of the restaurant. Very unique use of space. The street level bathroom is standard, but from what I hear, the downstairs bathroom is where you need to go. We were seated on street level close to the sushi bar so we could watch at least six chefs/cooks working non-stop. First course - toro tatare. This is a signature dish and has become a staple of the omakase menu. It comes with a seasoned soy sauce and five dipping options - wasabi, sour cream, kelp paste, avocado paste and Japanese crackers. I can see why this is a popular dish. This definitely set the bar for the courses to come. Second course - lightly seared sashimi of skip jack tuna. It was served with shimeji mushrooms and shiso. This was a pleasant second course and showed a delicate hand. Third course - assortment of vegetables, tempura liver and anchovy miso paste with a drizzle of olive oil. The plating out-shined the food. The miso paste was served in what looked like a scented oil burner. It seemed like a common veggies and dip snack disguised as a fancy dish. Fourth course - Oyster and foie gras with teriyaki jus. A nice hearty one bite dish. A bit overkill on the teriyaki sauce. Fifth course - Assorted nigiri, including chu toro, amber jack, hotate, and cherry trout. All fishes were tasty, but there was a lack of consistency. It seemed each of us got a generous helping of wasabi under at least one of the fishes, but it was under a different fish for each of us! Palette cleanser - homemade ginger ale. Probably one of the better homemade ginger ales I've tasted. A nice treat. Black cod - the cod was perfectly cooked, delicate and flaky. However, the sauce on it was too strong and it killed any natural flavor from the fish. Sixth course - wagyu beef with sweet potato sticks and lobster tail with garam masala. This was the obvious "main course" but it was such a let down. The beef was fine, but didn't have much flavor. The sweet potato sticks were super oily. The lobster tail was caked with the garam masala that you didn't taste anything but that spice. The tail was also cooked so much it was dry and tough. Seventh course - tofu cheesecake with apricot (I think) sorbet and sauce and a sesame puff pastry. The cheesecake was very good, even alone without any fruit flavor. I had such high expectations for this place. But the meal as a whole was a disappointment. There were only a few highs and a lot of low points. As an omakase meal, I expect to be wowed with good food, quality over quantity, but it seemed to be a lot of flash with little substance. My recommendation is to order a la carte from the more popular dishes and share with everyone at your table.

Review Update... 8 Course Omakase... ?$120.00 Here's the list of items served on the Omakase... Chu Toro Tartar: The tasting menu started off with a Toro Tartar. The presentation of the Tuna was in a finally mashed, almost in the form of crushed bananas served to an infant. The tuna was then spread out on a wood tray that measured 3" x 2" x .25", The Chu Toro was accompanied by a variety of dips (ie: Caviar, Scallions, etc...). Overall, I found the Chu Toro to be delectable. Although the texture presentation took away from the ability to chew and savor the texture of the actual Chu Toro, the taste in its own right was classic and clean. Unlike that of basic Maguro, the Chu Toro provided a bit of fatty substance which truly emphasizes the true nature of Chu Toro. Stripped Bass w/ Scallion Garnish topped with Hot Oil, Ponzu and Soy Sauce. The second dish of the Omakase presented a base of 5 pieces of Stripped Bass sashimi which was then layered with micro greens, topped off with Hot Oil, Ponzu, and Soy Sauce. The dish reminds me of the basic Tilapia dish at my house where the same application would apply only the Tilapia would be steamed (thus cooking thoroughly) prior to the application of the Scallions, Soy Sauce, and Hot Oil. What Morimoto manages to portray with this dish is that the subtle texture of the Stripped Bass is greatly enhanced by the Oil and the Soy Sauce. The extra micro green garnishes that are present on the dish gives an earthly and clean appeal, which greatly paves way to the nature texture of the Stripped Bass. Yellowtail Cerviche: Comparable to the previous Stripped Bass dish, the Yellowtail Cerviche tasting is by far the best item of the entire Omakase menu. The dish, although simple but invigorating, is presented with a base of 4 slices of Yellowtail Sashimi, then covered with a buttery miso tasting sauce. With each of the four bites, the palates begin to enhance through the smooth and buttery taste that's greatly harnessed by the fatty nature of the Yellowtail and the buttery base of the miso sauce. Sea Oyster over Sea Salt: The dish is as mentioned. A single piece of Oyster lays on a bed of Sea Salt. The Oyster is medium sized (about .5 ounces, or a single bite). The presentation of the dish as a base of Sea Salt which is then layed over by the Oyster (with shell intact, but open). The taste of the Oyster is from the oyster sauce and diced scallions that top off this dish. The single bite of the Oyster gives its consumer a fresh oyster taste that is greatly enhanced by both the sauce and the scallions. Macaroon w/ Green Tea Dip: A single peace of Macaroon lays in the middle of two contraptions used to make the Green Tea. The application of this dish starts with its diner picking up the tea pot, pouring hot water into a small cup containing powder that forms the base of the green tea. The tea is then prepared and is then wisked onto the Macaroon. The dish is nothing to really comment about, the Macaroon did not present any spectacular flavors that needs to be emphasized, not does the Green Tea additive give this dish any appeal. If anything, I would've been better off with a Spicy Tuna Roll... Sushi: 6 pieces of sushi forms the base of this portion of the Omakase. The 6 pieces consisted of Tuna, Salmon, Yellowtail, Stripped Bass, Eel, and Chu Toro. I'll leave any description of this dish except that each individual piece was fresh and clean. Once again, nothing extremely fancy. Half Lobster Accompanied by Sear Wagyu Beef &amp; Sweet Potatoes: As described a Lobster is split in half down the middle and served with all exteriors in place. The lobster was seared with a basic butter sauce and a spicy seasoning. The texture of the Lobster was perfect, giving the Lobster a tender and moist base while allowing the succulent meat of the lobster to stand out. The second half of this entree was the Seared Wagyu Beef over Japanese Sweet Potatoes. I'd have to say, Wagyu is best served raw. The equally distributed marbling that's present in Wagyu allows for consumers to obtain an equal balance of fat and protein with each bite. Wagyu on this particular occasion was considered "lightly seared". If there was an option to have Wagyu dropped on my lap without it being cooked, I would've gladly asked for it. Red Bean Cake w/ Hazelnut Ice Cream (Dessert): The description says it all. The only comment I need make regarding this dessert is that the Red Bean Cake presented a fluffy texture that's common with perfectly baked cakes. The red bean in the cake was still ripe and maintained it's structure through cooking. I'd have to say, I was not overly impressed with this particular Omakase menu. The food left me under whelmed, as the portions were dismal. Of the 8 dishes served, I would have to say that only 2 of them truly stood out (the Chu Toro Tartar and the Yellowtail Cerviche). The remaining 6 dishes failed to live up to the reputation of a Morimoto Omakase.

If you're looking to try a new, interesting place for Restaurant Week and are considering Morimoto, think again. ?Don't get me wrong, this place is great, but not for RW. ?For some reason, Chef Morimoto doesn't feel that he should provide the same amount of stuff other eateries do for this event. ?So instead of choices for appetizers, entree, and dessert, you get miso soup and salad, 3 entree choices, and NO DESSERT. ?I mean, damn Mr. Iron Chef. ?None? ?How annoying. I went here for Restaurant Week expecting to pay $24 + tax & tip. ?I ended up spending over $50. ?For lunch. ?If I'm going to spend that much on a meal, it's going to be dinner. Now, all that aside, the food was amazing. ?I got the chef's choice sushi and my companion got the angry chicken. ?I also ordered a salmon skin roll. ?All were great. ?Our desserts were divine as well. ?We both agreed that we'd love to come back for dinner, but prepared to pay a fair amount. We even got to see the man himself. ?I was quite excited - I love Iron Chef - so I refrained from saying something nasty about the RW menu. ?Still, it's not as bad as the time I saw Bobby Flay and lamented my lack of knife. 5 stars for the food minus 1 for the cheapskate RW menu. Oh, when you go, be sure to go use the bathroom. ?not only is it GORGEOUS in there, but the toilets are like something from the future.

After hearing my boyfriend say his last meal on Earth should come from Morimoto I decided to stay far far away. Why would such praise scare me away? I'll tell you why - So precisely this wouldn't happen - Me writing a review being disappointed after eating at Morimoto. I really wanted to stay forever curious and intrigued at what delights maybe hiding through those large doors. ::sighs:: The space is beautiful and I do appreciate the fact that they will try to find you a seat if your a walk in. We were seated in less then 10 minutes at the sushi bar. They make you take off your shoes to enjoy a more authentic experience, and I wasn't complaining at the heat lamps under the table. For decor and ambiance Morimoto is definitely a 5 star restaurant hands down. At the end of the day a bathroom all has the same less then pleasant purpose but Morimoto's bathroom is just breathtaking. Hello peacefully 3 dimensional artwork in back of me..........Hello falling leaves or whatever you are............Hello.........cool buttons on the side what do you do?...........::Music cuts off suddenly::...............ummmm well that was interesting. Strip away everything though and what you have left is the food and that is why they lose a star. We started with the Crispy Rock Tempura. The shrimp is heavily covered in batter and I will say at first taste I was blown away. It was really good! So I experimented with the spicy kochujan sauce, then the wasabi anoli.......and great.......at first. Like all things that are REALLY good at first (As I have so harshly learned in my life) they tend to become really really shitty really really quickly. The taste becomes overwhelming after 3 or 4 pieces and I just felt sick of the taste, sick of the texture, and sick overall. Sushi is awesome but I ?wanted to see what this Iron Chef is made of so I opted to chose a dish instead. With a name like Ishi Yuri Buri Bop and a description that tells me they are going to cook my yellow tail right at my seat - you'd think this would be one ultra fun cool dish. DISH FAIL- Basically the waiter brought over a very hot bowl and then proceeded to press strips of Yellow tail to it until it's cooked. Ok the presentation is a bit dull but the flavor is even duller! Basically rice and barely cooked yellow tail- nothing really mind blowing at all......and definitely not "orgasmic" to quote the guy I'm dating. His sushi was fresh which anyone ingesting uncooked food can appreciate but again nothing to do cartwheels over. Perhaps I chose the wrong dish, or I expected too much from Morimoto. I wouldn't jump to make a reservation again in the near future, but I wouldn't talk anyone out of having dinner here either.

Three words: Kentucky Fried Fugu! I have to give Masaharu Morimoto his star back. ?The food is still orgasmic, the drinks will kick you in the head, and the futuristic decor is still awesome. ?Morimoto has style, sex appeal, and killer Sushi. ?You can splurge on Omakase or you can order A la carte and not break the bank. Definitely worth the frequent visit.

There was a pigeon in the dining room!!! That just can't be sanitary. Alright, time for the gushing. The food was perfection. The kobe beef carpaccio was delicate and outstanding. The yellowtail pastrami was fantastic. The rock shrimp tempora was served tossed with two different and equally tasty sauces. The tuna tartare was pure butter. The sushi was incredible. The clam red miso soup was a flavor orgasm. Why only four stars? Well, the prices are out of control and I expect the service to be on par with the $20-something apps and $30-something entrees. But our waitress was dour and angry, forgetting to clear out dishes, asking for our drink order, hearing one person's and -leaving- before the rest of my party could order our drinks. Seriously, lady? She didn't know which fish was which, and she seemed genuinely annoyed I had asked. Also, she should have really done something about the pigeon.

If food is like sex, then eating at Morimoto would be like going to an upscale strip club, finding one of the hottest strippers you've ever seen in your life named Raspberry, taking her home and having some of the most incredible sex ever (in positions you never knew existed) but also having some awkward moments when you're like mehhh, and at the point where you're on the edge of orgasm, she stops you suddenly and says: "I ain't a ho! I'm going home!" And as she walks out, she takes $178.43 out of your wallet and slams the door. Yeah that pretty much sums it up. Morimoto is one of the coolest looking restaurants I've ever been to -- the exterior is a huge arc-shaped entryway with bright red curtains that just scream out: "I'm the Iron Chef, bitch!" Walking into it, you see a huge wall made of glass bottles that are lit in way where you feel like you're in a P. Diddy music video. Even the bathrooms were awesome -- if you go, you gotta check out the stalls. Morimoto definitely had the best of the best design this place. The food all looked incredible and most of it really was. I went with a friend and we shared an 8-course Omakase tasting dinner and also ordered the "Duck, Duck, Duck" entree, the Morimoto Sashimi platter, and a Soft-shell Crab Roll. The Omakase included: (1) Toro tartare, (2) Yellowtail carpaccio, (3) Sushi platter (5 different kinds of sushi), (4) Oyster w/ foie gras & uni, (5) Lightly-seared salmon salad, (6) Lobster, (7) Wagyu kobe beef slices, & (8) some muffin-like dessert with some fruit sorbet. Of all of these, my favorite was definitely the seared salmon. Probably the best piece of raw salmon I've ever had. Everything else was great, but there were a few misses in there. The sashimi platter is awesome. 5 different types of sashimi stacked on top of each other and cut like sushi rolls, so you eat all 5 types of fish in each bite. They also give you 4 different eye droppers with different sauces that you can dip your sashimi into. Really awesome idea, really damn good sashimi. The soft-shell crab roll was incredible as well. Now we all know Morimoto is fat. And now I know why: the "Duck, Duck, Duck". This entree is one of the most delicious and, at the same time, life-threatening dishes I've ever had. It's basically a plate of: (1) roasted duck confit, (2) a duck egg sunny-side up, and (3) a huge croissant filled with roasted duck, cucumbers, foie gras spread, and plum sauce. This duck croissant sandwich was INCREDIBLE, but the butter and fat fill up your mouth like you're eating Gushers. I was torn with a mixed emotion of gastrorgasmic joy and sadness that I'm going to leave the restaurant with man boobs. Anyways, Morimoto is amazing with their appearance, plating (you'll see some of the coolest plating ever, especially with the toro tartare and the Morimoto sashimi platter), and service. Most of the sushi was great, but definitely not the best I've ever had -- which is a little disappointing because this was definitely pretty expensive sushi. I left the restaurant with the feeling that I had an awesome experience, with some incredible highlights, but never really achieving that state of "Wow". And at the moment when you're almost at that point, the waiter brings you the check. Our bill came out to $178.43 per person after tip. You know it's not a great sign when you start making justifications like: "Meh, I'm only in NYC so often" or "Oh, you only live once." I wish I had said: "Only $178.43?! That was so worth it!" But I didn't. As I slowly walked away from the restaurant, I could hear a faint sound of Iron Chef Morimoto himself saying: "I ain't a ho!"

$24.07 Prix Fix lunch: APPEALING! Plastic bottle decorative wall: MAGNIFICENT! Japanese innovative toilet system: PRICELESS! Home made tofu inside the miso soup was the best miso soup I ever had! Beef gyudon could've been less sweet, which made my palate crave something savory right before dessert, which was something like passionfruit gelee over pannacotta -- it was not memorable *_* Tried their black cod though, it was really well executed! :) I want to come here for their a la carte menu...looking over @ other tables their lunch looked amazing! :) I'm so coming again to play in the bathroom ^_^

Rule No. 1 with Asian eateries. If you walk in and there are no asians eating, it's probably not great. The only asians there were management and the ones working the sushi bar. Uh oh... I went here for my birthday and naturally, had very high expectations coming in. Lets face it, Iron Chef Morimoto's restaurant should be what legends are made out of right? WRONG. This place was clearly catering to a "western" palette. Japanese food is all about simplicity and light complementing flavors. This meal was far from it. It had it's highlights, but the only thing which blew us away was the ginger ale. We had ordered omakase style and the menu came as follows: Toro Tartare with Osetra Caviar Seasoned Fluke w/ micro greens + cherry tomatoes Sockeye Salmon w/ greens + apple vinegarette Lobster Ravioli 5 pieces sushi House Ginger Ale "Flash Grilled" Kobe slice on candied Mountain yams Half lobster w/ side of citrus creme freche Pumpkin souffle topped with ginger ice cream, candied asian pear w/ ginger marshmallows. ? Sorry, that's not omakase. That's a prefixed menu. Omakase consists of tiny dishes which highlight's the chef's ability to take your mouth on a flavor adventure. This was simply an extended appetizer with a main course and a truly medeocre desert. The Toro Tartare with Osetra Caviar was rather tasty, but to grind toro into a paste is such a terrible waste. The side condiments were semi fresh wasabi, citrus creme freche (tasted like sour cream), nori paste, avocado mash, and rice balls. an odd combo but it was a decent way to start. Seasoned Fluke w/ micro greens + cherry tomatoes were rather tasty. no complaints here. Sockeye Salmon w/ greens + apple vinegarette was odd. The salmon was very well prepared, but it was sitting in a sauce which tasted like pink mayonnaise. The apple vinegarette dressing clashed with the mayo like sauce and the sea salted skin clashed with everything else on the plate. Fail. Lobster Ravioli in a yam broth dressed with the freshest ikura i've ever tasted. Unfortunately, that's where the food flavors ended and the bad ones began. The skin of the ravioli was chewy and the lobster tasted like a salt lick. i tried to wash the lobster down with the light broth, but my efforts were fruitless. Fail. 5 pieces sushi - ?Yummy Toro. Again. (in Omakase, repeats are like a dj playing the same song twice. No bueno). The other pieces, snapper/eel/mackerel were tasty but nothing spectacular. I was expecting Iron Chef. I got local cook. The fish was above average quality. Shot of House Ginger Ale - Starts clean and fresh, ends sharp. Best part of the meal. "Flash Grilled" Kobe slice on candied Mountain yams ?- Tasted like kbbq. A waste of kobe beef. Half lobster w/ side of citrus creme freche - overly seasoned, tasted too strong. The seasoning killed the lobster flavor, parts were way over cooked, and the creme freche tasted like sour cream. Fail. Pumpkin souffle topped with ginger ice cream, candied asian pear w/ ginger marshmallows. ? It was cute, but unimpressive. it was a sad attempt at wrapping up the meal. For the two of us, the bill came out to be about 340. They even charged us 8 dollars for some rather unimpressive cheap tea. Service was spectacular, as was presentation. It was impecably clean, except for a lone fly buzzing around. That kind of grossed me out. I wouldn't pay those prices for somewhere which should be a spectacular dining experience. Suffice to say, I have lost a lot of faith in food network. Bobby Flay's Mesa Grill is reviewed as whatever by many yelpers, Iron Chef Morimoto's own place's signature omakase failed to impress... I want to cry.

One of the MOST memorable dining experiences I've had. It's only fitting that Morimoto's will be my 100th review! ?They say Disneyland is What Dreams Are Made Of. Well Mickey.. you've JUST GOT SERVED! Morimoto used his strong Iron Chef Pimp Hand, bitch slapped you, and took that title straight from your mouseketeer ass. Because THIS place is where your DINING Dreams are Made of! Nicely situated in the Meat Packing District, Morimoto's a short walk from the Metro and once you see it, you can't miss it! http://static.px.yelp.co… Through the fluttering red curtains you're immediately greeted by a handful of hostesses. As we were led to our table you can't help but look and appreciate the design and decor. From the lighting to the glass paneling you're only thinking the food can only get better! Once seated our server greeted us and were given our menus. http://static.px.yelp.co… . We didn't even bother looking through the menu. We knew what we wanted! We traveled FAR! We were on a mission! We wanted the Omakase! As well as some drinks to start off this fantastic dining voyage! http://static.px.yelp.co… ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ?** | Seven Course Omakase | ** * | Toro Tartare in a Bamboo Box with Caviar and 6 Condiments, finished with a Japanese Berry http://static.px.yelp.co… * | Fluke Sashimi http://static.px.yelp.co… * | Seared Red Canadian Salmon with Bushel of Micro-Greens and Cold Cucumber Garnish http://static.px.yelp.co… * | Oyster Layered with Uni and Seared Foie Gras http://static.px.yelp.co… * | Palette Cleanser: Matcha Tea Shot http://static.px.yelp.co… * | Sushi Selection: O Toro, Yellowtail, Salmon, Snapper, Mackerel http://static.px.yelp.co… * | Seared Wagyu Beef with Sweet Potatoes Coupled with Lobster in a Half-Shell and Spicy Indian Curry http://static.px.yelp.co… * | Malaysian Cake/Souffle with Brown Sugar Ice Cream over Red Beans http://static.px.yelp.co… After the back to back bombardment of A-M-A-Z-I-N-G dishes.

Ehhh, my friend really wanted to come here on our one day visit to NY and there was much hype anticipated. ?Walking in, the atmosphere looked and felt really nice! ?The guy helping us out was really helpful and asked if we wanted to check in our shopping bags for free! ?I was kinda sad because we were being taken to the bottom floor which was quiet but quite unique. ?Low lighting w/ nice blue leds, I don't remember if there was some type of waterfall but it was a lot less hectic. We sat down and realized this place was quite pricey. ?We were really hoping the quality of sushi would speak for itself so that we wouldn't have to complain. ?We tried pretty much the gateway dishes such as spicy tuna, cali, shiitake mushroom & eel. ?If I recall correctly, I think the spicy tuna was in fact the best I've ever had.. but everything else was okay. On the side we ordered the tuna pizza, which was definitely a weird choice when I was thinking about it but turned out to be amazing! ?Served a tad bit cold, a crisp tortilla w/ spicy tuna carpaccio & anchovy sauce and some minced veggies.. this is a must besides the sushi! ?Other than that, we barely ate anything and the bill was still a bit pricey hahah. ?But I love the chopsticks here!! ?They seem so much easier to use even though I'm already a pro @ it =PP. ?Table setup was elegant and I enjoyed my stay. ?I won't be coming back here anytime soon unless I got money to spend and not care about.

What can I really add to the 800+ reviews? YOU MUST DO THE OMEKASE HERE!!! ?That's all. ? It was amazing. ?The restaurant is gorgeous. ?Morimoto was actually there the night we visited and was kind enough to take a photo with us and chat for a few moments. ?One of my most amazing food memories.

What a very happy birthday meal I had here. I have watched Masaharu Morimoto since his days on the original Iron Chef show that aired in Japan and I continue to watch him on Iron Chef America (even though I think the show is sort of silly compared to its Japanese counterpart).I've always had a tiny bit of a crush on him (although I have to admit that ponytail/glasses/goatee combo he's been sporting lately isn't his best look) and also always hankered after a taste of his food. A birthday dinner here was a great opportunity for me to experience it. The decor is gorgeous. The huge light structure in the middle of the restaurant, the clear bar stools downstairs at the bar, the clean lines, the high folded ceiling.. and the bathroom. I love fancy bathrooms. And out of every restaurant bathroom I have ever been to in my life, the bathroom at Morimoto is the best. The toilets have bidets installed on them and although I was somewhat startled by the heated toilet seat, it was nice to think there was so much thought put into such details. The wall behind the toilet is glass and mirrors with suspended cherry blossoms and the illusion of going on endlessly... The service is courteous and timely. My water glass was always filled,empty dishes were taken away promptly, and our server was always nearby if we needed anything. The sparkling sake is wonderful. Please try it. The toro tartare was delicious and the presentation was beautiful. The toro tartare comes in a square bamboo box with a small bowl of ponzu dipping sauce and another box with different condiments to dip the tartare into. I believe there were tiny rice crackers, avocado, black seaweed, sour cream, and wasabi. I liked the combination of sour cream and wasabi the best. Unexpected and so refreshing. I could've licked the entire condiment box clean but the server took away the dish before I could. Sad... I'm not one for ordering maki at Japanese restaurants but I was craving soft shell crab so I ordered a soft shell crab roll and a spicy hamachi roll. Although the sushi was tasty, I did think that the sesame seeds encrusting the rice sort of overpowered the taste of the fish. But aside from that, the sushi was good and the soft shell crab having just been fried, was warm and crispy. For our main courses, I had the Halibut and the Black Cod. ?My halibut was cooked to meltingly tender perfection. It was smeared on top with fermented black bean paste and had a salad of scallions and cilantro on top. It was sitting in a pool of broth with a few drops of chili oil. The flavors were more Chinese than Japanese but I enjoyed it all the same. The black cod was coated in sweet miso and was also very tender. I think I preferred the halibut to the black cod simply because black cod is too rich for me. I liked the little side garnish of sweet Japanese black beans. The pickled skin of bell peppers not so much. A birthday dessert had been pre-ordered and they came out with a lovely plate that had a lit candle, 3 tiny desserts, and 'Happy Birthday' scrawled across the plate in chocolate. The 3 desserts were a red bean macaroon, a square of tofu cheesecake, and a chocolate fruit tart. I also had the Earl Grey creme brulee and let me tell you... so good! It was topped with an orange sorbet, spring roll wrapper tuille, and candied orange peel and I wanted to.. well I don't know exactly what I wanted to do but it was so good I almost felt tears coming to my eyes. I always say that good food will leave you speechless but apparently that's not quite right since this review has turned out to be quite wordy.

If I were to take all of the meals I consumed in New York City to Kitchen Stadium, dinner from Morimoto's would be the clear winner in Battle Best-Meal-I-Ate. The toro tartare appetizer lived up to all the raves on Yelp, plated with a palette of sauces so pleasing to the eye that we didn't want to dig in (for a split second). ?Soft shell crab sushi was fantastic. ?And my duck entree of a foie gras croissant, duck leg, and duck egg was delicious! ?I devoured everything, then decided that our table needed dessert. ?The white chocolate semifreddo was tasty: the ice cream came with crumbles flavored like pepper, and the contrast in sweet and savory worked well. ?The green tea sponge cake was chopped into little cubes and tasted way better than moldy bread crumbs, which is what it almost looked like. The cocktails are pricey at $14 apiece, but they're both refreshing and strong. ?My hydrangea had touches of lychee. Service was attentive, but not overbearing, although our elderly male waiter somehow morphed into a twenty-something, skinny girl by the time we ordered dessert. ?That's never happened before... not that this caused a hitch in service. Oh, and the flowers suspended in the clear back wall of each bathroom stall mesmerized me. ?...There's a sentence I never thought I would write. ?If my bathroom was like that, I'd hang out in there all the time, kthxbye! And if you're lucky enough, you may just see the Iron Chef himself floating around. ?After we checked in with the hostess, we spotted an Asian man just hanging out by the staircase and stared at him, checking out his side profile for a few minutes ("is that Morimoto?" ?"maybe it's some other Asian guy." ?"it kind of looks like him...") before I just walked up to him and asked him if he was Iron Chef Morimoto. ?And with the straighest face ever, he looked at me and told me he was his twin brother. ?Good one, Iron Chef. ?Morimoto was friendly and hailed a waiter over so we could snap a photo with him.

Food: See Below Service: Spotty Price: Fair Atmosphere: Great, Loved it! Bathroom: Very Cool Design We ordered a variety of Sushi as an appetizer then soups and main courses. Raman and Clam soup was excllent. The Sushi was some of the best I've ever had! Cod was good sauce on top was not so good! The inconsistent service and mess up on the Raman soup was very disappointing. Overall I would train the servers to be more responsive. I'd only go here for the Sushi and sit at the counter . So many other great restaurants in NY to hit.

*400th review* For my 400th review I'm choosing to review the outstanding "iron chef" restaurant Morimoto. Take me to the mothership! This place is sooo trippy and its designed like something out of a sci-fi movie. Even trying to walk into the restaurant is kookie. You have to find the doors behind the red curtains covering the side of the building. They have a great price fixe lunch special for $24.07 (?). You have a choice of Miso soup or salad, "Angry Chicken" or Black Cod and great dessert. I also decided to order the Toro Tartare to start. This dish was almost the same price as the entire price fixe. What a presentation! Its served in this huge ice bowl and it has a board that holds the tartare and you scrape it off and dip it with the sides like creme fresh and avocado. Duff, the Chicago sausage pizza you said was "The best thing you ever ate" was like eating your pillow. You are hearby redeemed with this latest suggestion. The Black Cod was outstanding. Its funny how they give you a sliver of pepper. It was just the right size of fish and that little pepper slice was packed with flavor. Lunch is the best time to come to these high end places. The restaurant isn't too crowded and you get to sample some great entrees. I'll be back, next time maybe I'll see Mr. Iron Chef!

Iron Chef Cuisine Reigns Supreme! Having gone here on a few separate occasions I must admit to having a rocking time on both! The most important thing to remember is to make sure you get a seat at the sushi bar! This is where all the action happens and the chefs will chat with you if you are friendly to them. To see them work up close is really cool. Plus, on both occasions the Iron Chef himself was holding court there and he came over to speak to us both times. Really nice and warm guy. Was very interested what we thouight of his food, which was terrific. When you pull up to the place the outside is covered with a flowing red drapery across the front. ?You can't miss it. Entering the place you are greeted by the front desk staff. Both times our seats were not ready and it would be about 15 minutes, so we went to the downstairs bar/lounge area. Bar area is very white! See through poly -plastic type stools, and funky spaceship type feel. Small lounge area to grab a seat and enjoy a drink. Going back upstairs to get our seats you are also greated by a giant bottle wall. The whole place has this very chic Japan meets outer space vibe to it, which compliments the experience here. It is kind of loud and busting, probably because of the size and open layout. Dinner here is off the hook. Portions are not huge, but Japanese cuisine is not about huge plates, so keep that in mind. ?Crispy rock shrimp tempura, Japanese lobster fritters, ishi yaki buri bop (which they cook in front of you in a hot stone bowl was delish - yellowfin tuna w/rice), fresh maki and sushi was all good. Many choices to choose from. Plus, Morimoto has his own line of sake of all styles and a pretty extensive wine list. Beer of course also. Had some nice desserts. Had this chocolate cake with caramel popcorn and corn ice cream that was like a party in your mouth! But seriously, no meal at Morimoto is complete without a trip to the famous bathrooms. Life is not complete until walk into this serene environment, have the lid move up and down on its on, and feel the gratifying warmth of that lid as you sit down in it. Ahhhh. All types of controls to play with on this robotic throne. You can spend a whole lot of time in this tranquil escape from reality. ? You will drop some serious coin here, so bring your credit cards kiddies!

So, my first trip to Morimoto and I make an ass out of myself. How? I couldn't find the entrance to it. Now you may be thinking " How is that possible? It's just that HUGE RED BANNER in front." Except their automatic door wasn't working. And I was peering into the large glass doors like a fooligan ( a fooligan I tell you!) And walked around the corner looking for the entrance. And then back into Chelsea Market. And back into peering in the glass door. Until some nice attendant realized there is some strange girl staring into the restaurant and couldn't get in. Beyond my trials and tribulations with the entrance... The place is beautifully designed and once inside the wait staff took my coat and allowed me ample time to peruse the menu. Seeing as this would probably be my only RW meal this season, I wanted to make sure I chose carefully. I definitely wanted their sushi, but their bento boxes looked pretty solid. In decided to choose the Grilled Wagyu Beef bento box. With 5 components to the bento box, it is a pretty good bang for your buck. You get miso soup ( tasty, with BEAUTIFULLY soft tofu), salad, three pieces of tempura, three pieces of sashimi and three pieces of spicy tuna with a special fruit panna cotta. All the pieces of this meal were deliciously tasty. If their spicy tuna roll is any indication, a full on sushi meal would be like angels giving birth in my mouth. Panna cotta was out of this world good. That being said, I do regret not going all sushi here and ordering up a sushi storm. Perhaps next time. Bathroom? Meh... why is everyone talking about this bathroom? It's a large spacious one person bathroom. Did I miss the awesome out of this world bathroom?

I took my sister here for our annual sisters birthday dinner. This would've been a five star dinner experience save for one thing - the blowfish appetizer. ?The blowfish was just disappointing. ?I was hoping for at least the tiniest tingle on the lips from the slightest hint of blowfish toxin. ?But there was none. ?Come to find out the blowfish imported to the US is so thoroughly cleaned that it is spic and span and can do no harm. ?Bummer! Besides that, blowfish just has no hint of flavor. ?It is the blandest thing in the world. ?The sashimi was bland. ?The bits of skin, I think, were rubbery and also flavorless. ?And the fried bits of bone were just nothing special. ?The price tag on this appetizer IS the poison of the dish! ?I would rather fly straight to Japan for the authentic experience than to pay for the blowfish I had at Morimoto again. ?Sorry! Other than that, the rest of the meal was phenomenal! ?The tartare was delicious and we both could've had another order each if we wanted! ?The presentation on it is quite unique as well. ?It was fun to try the different condiments and their combinations on the tiny spatula. ?Delicious! ?If it wasn't frowned upon, I would've licked the tartare and condiment plate clean. Then came the piece de resistance! ?Our omakase sashimi platter. ?It was breathtakingly beautiful. ?Our waitress said that Morimoto himself prepared our omakase, but I'm sure she says that to everyone. ?(He was there that evening. ?We could see him talking to his sushi bar customers. ?I kicked myself for not requesting the sushi bar at that moment...) Flawless cut pieces of fresh sashimi, some even sliced and presented back on the bones of the fish it came from. ?I have to get the picture I took of the platter on the page... ?Not only did it look good, it tasted even better. ?Our waitress accomodated every fish request we asked for, including uni. ?And the uni here was the freshest, cleanest and sweetest I've ever tasted. Desserts were decent, but now that I think about it, I could've had more fish...

Morimoto's was definitely one of the highlights of our eating adventures in New York City. ?The food and drinks were fantastic, the ambiance was very nice. ?Definitely check out the bathrooms and toilets! ?I never thought a bathroom could look so beautiful! Service was great, they were attentive but not overly attentive where you start to feel uncomfortable. On to the food... we ordered (lunch): Ginger Lemonade - great balance of ginger and lemonade, you can taste the ginger but it doesn't over power the drink (4stars) Berry Iced Tea - ?great balance of berries and ice tea, just the right amount of sweetness (4 stars) Unagi and Foie Gras Bop- the BF had this, I only tried a bite of the unagi. ?He liked the dish but said that there was something in it that tasted a bit "weird" but couldn't pin point it. ?But he still liked it and polished off his bowl (3.5stars) Spicy Salmon Roll - we both shared this, it was really yummy! ?The salmon was really fresh and the spicy sauce was good. ?Not too spicy or overpowering (4stars) Bento lunch box, which included: Salad - I usually prefer to eat my salad with no dressing, but the dressing was really good :) (4stars) Miso Soup - this was really good as well, looked like they used soft fresh tofu in the soup (4stars) Sushi - this came with 3pieces of nigiri and 3 pieces of sushi. ?Again, the sushi was really fresh (4stars) Black Cod - this was so yummy. ?My only complaint - it was too small! ?I wanted more! ?(but that might just be me being greedy) (4-stars) Tempura - the tempura was standard but it came with a dipping sauce that tasted like blue cheese. ?I'm not a fan of blue cheese - and it tasted like the sauce was too strong for the tempura (3stars) Berry Panna Cotta for Dessert - The Panna Cotta came in a cute little cup and was good (nothing special) ?(3.5stars) We also order the Tofu "Hot and Cold" - when we ordered this it sounded quite interesting but wasn't sure what to expect. ?This came with a souffle, cheesecake and maple ice cream. ?This was definitely the favorite of the whole meal! ?Everything was so good, we practically licked the plate clean. ?This is definitely a must have when going to Morimoto's! We will for sure be back the next time we're in NYC!

i've been reading and hearing about Morimoto's restaurant for months- i thought it would be a nice treat to engorge ourselves to a fabulous meal at one of our favorite Iron Chefs' joints... Mr. Morimoto. what better way to do that than with your close buddies and a RESTAURANT WEEK menu? apparently... not here. =p we anticipated and nearly over-exhilarated ourselves for weeks to have lunch here. for myself particularly? i wanted to try the signature cocktail, "White Lily"- with Calpico! honestly, that was the only part of the menu i DID enjoy. throughout the 15 minute meal... i had a basic salad with weak miso dressing, a cocktail, and a black cod smaller than my Metrocard. i was absolutely let down and kind of irritated. Maritess Z., David S. all proposed we go out for some pizza or cheap fast food afterwards. the 4 stars are dedicated to the ultra-sleek and beautiful decor. absolutely stunning and minimalistic at the same time. exquisite- indeed! the bathrooms are spotless and so beautiful. i would build my own bathroom just like this one. even when you step inside the stalls (see picture) you enter another realm of tranquility and beauty. oh yeah, the bidet is nice, too. ha! i walked in and dodged the rain all morning, fought an 1 hour worth of traffic on the freeway, and for what?!?! we ended up eating a FEAST for under $10 at Manna's Kitchen in Union Square. haha.

3 stars for decor and heated toilet seats with Japanese style bidet. What a "nice" surprise! Went here for RW and shared the menu of three choices with Steve V. David S, and Joolie T showed up later. How did I drop $40 on a tiny bowl of lettuce, miso soup (ok, wait a minute, the miso soup was the best I've had in my life, it was just like the miso soup I was served at Five Star hotels in Japan) ?a STALE pot of $8 tea, and sushi that tasted like the rice was made last night? The fish main course was amazing, but was so light, it could only be described as an appetizer. This was the worst experience on my RW roster and I am never coming here again. Joolie T. and I had to go to a Korean restaurant afterwards and eat because we were still hungry. Grr!

This was round 2 at Morimoto's for me and I found it to be just as innovative as the first time around, which happened a few years ago. The creativity was all there - flavor, ingredients and presentation-wise. Ok, so yes, a Morimoto Omakase experience for three people costs a little more than a 16GB iPad 2 - but trust me when I say... it's worth it. We started our meal with a White Lily Cocktail made with Calpico and Meyer lemons. It was light, lovely and brought me back to my childhood. I was obsessed with Calpico back then. We were also served a Toro Tartare with osetra caviar, fresh wasabi, avocado cream, nori paste and a small furry Japanese plum that is rarely seen in the U.S. Next came the Warm Tilefish Carpaccio with hot oil and mushrooms then the Anchovy & Garlic fondue with veggies. The aromatic plate was really special - It had an oyster, uni and a perfectly seared piece of foie gras in a teriyaki sauce, sitting on a bed of sea salt, star anise, cinnamon, and Szechuan peppercorns. It was sensory overload (in a good way) - it smelled great, tasted amazing and I loved all the silky rich textures. Chef's sushi plate came next. The mackerel with spicy onions was the best. This was also where they gave us an intermezzo of homemade gingerale with lime that cleansed our palate before the main course. The Surf and Turf was our main entree - Wagyu on Caramelized Sweet Potatoes and curried Spiny Lobster with Yuzu Crème Fraiche. I devoured every last bit of this and had to fight the urge to lick the lobster shells clean. Completely out of this world. Dessert was a Moist Chestnut Cake with Green Tea Ice Cream and Passionfruit Foam. A light and subtly sweet dish. I even got to meet Morimoto! It really was a special evening :)

Iron Chef Morimoto on style on TV tempted us to come here for a meal here. The menu seems endless and we wanted to try everything. ?We decided on the Morimoto omakase, 8 course tasting menu designed to allow you to experience the essence of Morimoto's cuisine. ? I started with the White Lily cocktail and love it. ?The food took its time, and that was good since I was totally enjoying my $14 drink. First was tuna tartar, beautifully presented and very different from what we had from other places, this came in a rectangle wood tray (like color paint). ?It was quite interesting to find out that this item was 1st featured on Iron Chef Show and now on his menu. Second was fluke sashimi with roasted hot oil. Hot oil totally gives the plate its highlight. Third is the sear salmon with micro green. Salmon was cook half raw, and it made it enjoyable. Ordered the 2nd White Lily cocktail, but this time; it tasted too sweet for the courses. We added sake. Fourth was AMAZING! The combinations of foie gras, raw oyster and of course (my fav) uni just melt in my mouth. I can have this everyday.. Perfect dish!! Did I say another round of that plz? Fifth was variety kind of sushi, the fish slices were bit thin so that could be improve, as we'll here because for the love of 'raw fish'. So I like some more than other but everything was very fresh. ?We sat close to the sushi bar area, so I got to see the Sushi Chef created our dish, he was quite concentrated; and the 'folding' of sushi to create the shape was continuously the same amount of turns. Very interesting and good learning for me. Sixth & Seventh came in one, kobe beef and shiny lobster. For $60 extra, they would replace kobe from Japan instead of American Kobe beef. We had pix taken of the Japanese kobe beef when our waiter brought it out to show us about the marbles and it was hugh piece. ?I wanted one to take home. lol Eighth was the desert, peach sorbet pair with sweet bread. Overall, the service was excellent, and he got tip well, we also received a signed Moromoto menu. It was a night of GOOD EATS.

This place was freaking AWESOME!!! ?I know I know, I'm not supposed to like or enjoy or be excited about a celebrity chef restaurant, but this place was amazing. ?From the decor to the service to the food. ?It was all top notch. ?Oh and I cannot forget a mention of the bathrooms. ?Those were great. My friends and I decided to use the opportunity of restaurant week to check out Morimoto. ?They had a great selection on the menu. ?However, we ended up not ordering from there and instead "splurging" since it was lunchtime. I had the Black Cod bento box. ?It was wonderful. ?A huge box, loaded with treats - miso soup, salad, tempura, 3 pieces nigiri, and 3 tuna rolls, along with rice and the black cod. ?My only complaint is that the piece of cod was tiny and it tasted SOOO good that I wanted more! ? ?I thought this bento box was a great sampling of the different items on the menu and really enjoyed all of the offerings. ?I could have eaten about a full pound of that cod for sure. One of my friends had the Foie Gras and Eel bowl. ?He was so full that he could hardly move and still had half his bowl left. ?A HUGE portion of foie gras, seared and placed on top of rice and avocado and eel, left him smacking his lips. My other friend chose to try the sushi platter. ?It was absolutely beautiful. ?She ate every last piece of the 18 piece tray and was stuffed. Yeah, this place is ridiculously expensive, but what a treat for a day that you've saved your $$$ for a special occasion. ?Fantastic!

This place is truly amazing! We ordered the Whitefish carpaccio which I normally would never order. It came with fresh herbs and oils it had be marinated in. Holy Shit!!! This was the best thing I ever ever ate!! We also got the spicy tuna roll which was also amazing. I went to use the bathroom down stairs and spotted the only celebrity at the bar. ?Its funny too because me and my brother always make fun of this guy. Of all the people I had to see the biggest douche. It was Guy Fiera, the guy from diners, drive throughs, and dives! Anyway we got a tofu dessert which was bomb and and a chocolate dessert which was soo damn good. I'm posting picts now

What could possibly be wrong with a combination of beautiful food and beautiful people? Sure, you have to pay through your nose for the Omakase dinner, but then you can see the Iron Chef and dine in an elegantly designed setting. I enjoyed the Rock Shrimp Tempura - the serving was huge, but I was slightly more partial towards the fried shrimp in Wasabi aioli over the shrimp in Korean red pepper sauce. Even the entree, Angry chicken was substantial and had a fiery touch to it. Well recommended for those not trying Sushi. (I decided to defer Sushi for another opportunity). The main reason for going to Morimoto was to see if the accolade of best new dessert in the city was well deserved. If I were finicky (and I am) the Tofu cheesecake was excellent, but mainly a result of the contrasting flavors of the accompaniments. I alternated a long while between portion combinations and decided that the best one was to have the chiffon like cheesecake with the candied ginger (to give it bite) and then follow it with the dipping sauce (maple syrup with coffee). ?Simply Amazing! (Mind you, the thin chocolate shavings on top of the white chiffon didn't add anything to the flavor) Also endearing was the Chocolate Hazelnut cake dessert with excellent texture variations between wafer and mousse. My companion couldn't say much for the green apple sorbet which she thought was too tart, but I loved it. Kudos!

Yes. This is New York. ?A crazy restaurant in the meatpacking district. ?Totally insane overdone space in the middle of f'ing nowhere. ?Glimpses of a celebrity chef that I used to gawk at before anyone knew what Iron Chef even was. ?Great background music. ?Rockstar lookalikes. ?Yellow cabs and limos hanging around outside. ?Damn right. A few less than sober friends tried to go take pictures of Morimoto during our meal. ?He seemed to disappear when they approached. ?The manager said that he would come to our table. ?He didn't. ?That rules. ?I wouldn't have either. ?Morimoto rocks. Yes, I can easily find better sushi at any number of places in the city (Gari!). ?Yes, I can definitely find better noodles (Momofuku!). ?I'm sure I can find better modern/japanese/american/fusion/nonsense entrees if I bothered to try. ?But, it's not about that. ?It's about spending a ridiculous amount of money to hang out at a "high end" space with beautiful people and amazingly presented dishes. ?It's about indulging in the absurdity of life and what it has to offer. ?In this regard, Morimoto succeeds amazingly. Morimoto is like high-end clothes shopping. ?In the end, do the clothes I buy at Hugo Boss make me look better than the clothes that I buy at the Gap? ?No, probably not. ?Do I enjoy shopping at Hugo Buss much more, and having an attentive staff cater to my every whim while laughing at the riffraff outside? ?Hells yes. Rock on, Morimoto.

I love Morimoto. ?Though I've been to the one in Philly more than I have the one NYC, the NYC one definitely impressed me more in terms of its spaciousness and spectacular decor! ? The food here is scrumptious! ?You can never go wrong with the traditional Japanese dishes, sushi or the omakases! ?My personal favorite is the salmon bop (buri bop?) where they bring a hot stone bowl of rice to your table and allow the raw salmon to cook against the sizzling sides of the bowl while drizzling in a light soy-sauce concoction. ...mmmm. ?I've also tried the omakase, and as you'd expect, it's delish. ?Granted that it "varies" from time to time, some staples I've come to expect from the omakase are the tuna tar tar beginner, a sampler of sushi/sashimi and smaller portions of the ginger cod and kobe steak. ? I also visited the restaurant during restaurant week, but the selections were more limited. ?The menu consisted of sushi/sashimi, black cod or the angry chicken, each paired with miso soup and salad. ?Yea, it's not much, but enough for a "light lunch". ?Although restaurant week is a great chance to visit the restaurant on a "lower" budget, it doesn't showcase its full potential and dining experience; and, I actually would recommend against it. ?(Restaurant week is really a grab bag of good or bad menu combos and experiences regardless (!) of how great the restaurant may be on a regular basis. ?Some impeccable restaurants really mess up restaurant week, while some other mediocre restaurants really shine... but, I digress.) The service is very professional and curteous as you would expect at any high-profile restaurants. ?You can also ask them any question you'd like about the dishes and they'd have a detailed answer standing by as if they thought up the dish themselves, ha! ?I do believe, however, that with so many other awesome and affordable choices in the city, this is one place you may want to save for a special occasion.. and then go all out omakase style. ?Or, buri bop style. ?..if buri bop is what I think it is, that is. Lastly, Morimoto is usually present at the NYC location, which is a special treat over the one in Philly!

Whatever I ate, left me unimpressed, but now looking at some of the reviewers' pictures - I think I need to give this place another chance.

Excellent atmosphere, Delicious Food, and Decent Service. One thing I would add is that they have a very nice bathrooms. The upstair bathroom is not as impressive, but ladies, if you get a chance, take a visit to the downstairs bathroom. The appetizers are really good, my favorite was the sashimi. Next time however, I would like to try to tuna tartar. Also, between the sea bass and the salmon, it is definitely hard to decide. If you are looking for something heavy and creamy then go with the sea bass, if not, then I guess the salmon. We ended our meal with three flavors of sorbet, guava, basil lime, and raspberry wasabi. The most interesting one was the raspberry wasabi. The sweetness from the raspberry somehow complements the wasabi taste very well. It was a very pleasant surprise because it was mild and not over powering. On the other hand, the basil lime was very strong. After the first bite, any bite after is like a kick in the face. It was good that we had the guava to balance it out.

Worth EVERY penny!! This Iron Chef does NOT disappoint!! First of all, the restaurant is this impressive work of art. It's like being inside a crystal cube. It is out of this world -from the high-tech bathroom downstairs to the glass fountain stairwell, my girl friends and I even had a photo opp with Morimoto himself. The servers were knowledgable and cultured.. not to mention gracious! Plus all the beautiful people (especially Asians, ahem hahaha!) in Manhattan seem to hang out here. Had the kobe carpaccio (superb!), kumamoto oysters foie gras (expensive for just 3 measly pieces), black cod, tempura (love the blue cheese dressing!!), unagi &foie gras... Oh, also had a long island for 13 bucks felt it was watered down. the hazelnut mousse was ok. Nevertheless, worth every penny! It was my second time and I'd definitely go back!

What a fantastic treat! ?Omakase tasting menu for $120 per person left all of us extremely satisfied. ?Some highlights: - Beautiful presentation for everything. - Hamachi tartare with a yummy dashi soy sauce. - Wagyu beef that melts in your mouth. - Oyster foi gras with teriyaki sauce. - Pumpkin steamed cake with chestnut ice cream. Could be improved: - Lobster "epice" was a bit too salty and spicy. ? - The nigiri was not great. ?Fish slices were thin and had too much wasabi. ? Tip: ?The downstairs dining area by the bar is much more relaxed than upstairs. ?Also, the bathroom door slides open. ?Don't be like me standing there trying to push or pull the handle off ?:D So go ahead! ?Reward yourself, because YOU're worth it!

It's worth going to just for the bathroom. ?The Japanese toilets are top-notch with complete washing, drying, and heating with different angles and pressures. ?Oh, and the bathroom itself is beautiful with mirrors that give the illusion of millions of flowers. ? Ok, besides the bathroom, the restaurant space itself is awesome with great design. ?Ok, but the food....very very underwhelmed. ?The sushi was pedestrian. The spicy king crab was poorly conceived. The morimoto sashimi could have been good, but it was way too compliucated with too many sauces and different combinations...it was just too much. ? The lobsters fritters were interesting and worked, but everything else left me disappointed. ?Oh, and the drinks are unexceptional and overpriced. But, I do recommend just going to the bar to enjoy the swanky atmosphere and to use the very cool toilet.

My first review of 2010! This review is being brought to you courtesy of the free wireless internet service in Seoul, South Korea and my never-ending airport boredom. The food is mildly impressive, but the space, decor, and ambiance is true iron-chef material. The venue is austere yet impossibly trendy. The white and silver decor, flattering lighting, and rows of well-heeled diners add to the appeal. Somehow, Morimoto offers a fresh twist on traditional Japanese food, serving up a delicious tuna tartare pizza and duck, duck, duck (duck three ways). The presentation is exquisite and the cocktails are certainly refreshing. All in all, solid 4 stars for the food. Of course, this wouldn't be an acceptable Morimoto review without mentioning the bathrooms. I heart bidets. When will Americans ever learn....

The Vegetarian Box ($19) is a courteous gesture for us celebrity restaurant strumpets who happen to be vegetarian... but I can't imagine the chef has ever bothered to taste the awkward "vegetable gratin" that they serve. How could anyone think it's a good idea to serve a cheesy casserole at a Japanese restaurant; it's like they are trying to keep me away. The miso, salad, and vegetable sushi are nothing special either. So boo to the food, I though Morimoto had more skill then this. If you can't cook vegetarian food don't even bother putting anything on the menu, it makes you look like an amateur. NYC has some truly wonderful Japanese food (Zenkichi I'm looking at you) where the chef doesn't use the freshness of raw fish as a crutch. Cool bathroom though!

Had the: toro tartare--excellent. ?cumbersome way to eat it with little paddles but will definitely get it again foie gras chawan mushi--good beef curry bread--holy cow excellent. ?i can eat this everyday. ?If I win the lottery. dobin mushi--the soup will take you to a classic ryokan in kyoto--perfect comfort food. ? ramen soup--skip it. ?Really though, who orders ramen at Morimoto? ?Kids. sashimi combination--good but not the best. ?slices are smallish on an "ikebana" inspired presentation on crushed ice bowl. I was expecting to be wowed. I don't think I finished it. surf and turf (sushi + wagyu beef)--waaaay better than the sashimi. ?morimoto's expertise on one plate flourless chocolate cake--good. ?not memorable. Loved the place--white, glass everywhere, cute bathroom with auto sliding door which locks with a switch button. ?Much better lit than a typical NYC gourmet restaurant. ?Friendly staff but it gets really busy so service can deteriorate. ?Food presentation is masterful but the taste can fall short. ?When food came late and the manager took it off the bill, ?I was impressed and grateful. ?This was part of my Iron Chef tour and this time, Morimoto beats Flay.

I came here with a friend before watching the Little Mermaid on Broadway. ?My friend had been anxiously wanting to come to the famous chef's restaurant and we were NOT disappointed. We started off with the tuna pizza which had bluefin tuna, anchoy aioli and jalapeno as recommended by fellow yelpers. ?It was amazing. ?It was a good size and the fish tasted fresh. For my entree, I got the roasted ocean trout which was very light and delicious, but I fell in love with my friend's sea bass more. ?It just melts in your mouth.

if Morimoto Philly and Morimoto NYC were sisters they'd be the Simpson gals. Morimoto NYC is definitely Jessica and that's why it only gets 4 stars. Its a bit over the top. It doesn't try to relate to the common person. Its just lipstick glamor and a big chest. Its a thin dress, high heels, and an attitude. Morimoto Philly is the more human Ashlee. She's real (minus the singing), down to earth, someone you can hang out with and not feel inferior. She's a bit funky, she's a bit weird but we like her. Lets not kid ourselves, she's still a glamorous fame-whore but, compared to the plastic Jessica, she's subtle and authentic. Cant miss appetizer? Kobe beef.

Trendy. ?Overpriced. ?Overrated. ?Touristy. ? Don't believe the Iron Chef hype. ?The dishes we had were good but nothing worth writing about--at least not worth the absurd $300+ bill for two people. ?Also not any better than some great sushi I have had at much less expensive places. I will say that the modernist interior architecture of the restaurant was impressive. ?The ceiling comprised of hanging fabric that made me feel as though we were dining in a celestial tent. ?A beautiful glass wall that was made up of water bottles displayed as the center-piece of the entire space.

Our first night in NYC, and what better way to start the week at Morimoto! ?We couldn't decide if we wanted the omakase or just order a la carte. ?Usually most places make the whole table get the chef's tasting/omakase, but since it was Sunday, they let us just have 1 person get the omakase! Omakase: chopped toro carpaccio - cool presentation and a very unique way of eating toro! amadai sashimi - this was pretty good, but not quite as exciting as I was expecting. ?good quality fish! seared kampachi w/rhubarb sauce - one of my fav dishes of the night! ?i've never really had rhubarb much, and with sashimi? ?but the dish was fantastic! salmon ravioli - this was probably the least interesting dish of the night. ?it was good, but wasn't nearly as exciting as the other dishes. assorted nigiri - the fish here is definitely good quality. ?great sushi if that's what you're looking for. ?we got to try tanzanian salmon which was fantastic! hibiscus tea - a little shot of cold hibiscus tea w/yuzu foam and sansho pepper was super refreshing and really tasty. ?i drink a whole glass of this stuff! wagyu strip steak and lobster - our final course before dessert, but a slight disappointment. ?the steak was pretty good, but didn't blow me away, and the seasoning on the lobster was just ok. ?pretty good portions though. In addition to the omakase, we ordered: foie gras chawan-mushi - when I saw this on the menu, i HAD to get it. ?I absolutely love chawan-mushi and foie gras..and combined together?! ?amazing! ?I wish they gave me more... oysters topped with foie gras and uni - can a bite of food get any more extravagant? ?it's like all the melty goodness in a single bite. ?the teriyaki sauce a little overpowering, but surprisingly the combination works amazingly well. yosedofu w/lobster ankake - super silky tofu made fresh at your table! ?they bring a clay pot of soy milk to your table, stir in reduced salt water and cover. ?a few courses later, they come back and voila! ?you now have fresh tofu. ?accompanied with a lobster ankake and shoyu, it was a nice light dish. we also ordered some nigiri - chu-toro, oh-toro and uni. ?the oh-toro is probably the best i've had outside of Japan. ?pretty expensive for one piece ($12), but so melty and delish! Dessert: almond souffle cake w/apricot sorbet - the cake was sooo yummy! ?so simple, so light, i really need to learn how to make this myself! passion fruit panna cotta w/basil sorbet and passion fruit kuzukuri - omg, my fav dish of the evening and one of the best desserts ever. ?The panna cotta was so delicious, and the basil sorbet was so different and surprisingly good! Overall we had a great dinner. ?Some of the omakase dishes were not quite as spectacular and/or unique as we had hoped, but we enjoyed the meal. ?It's unfortunate that Morimoto-san wasn't there that evening, but maybe next time. ?The atmosphere was quite modern and simple, and the bathrooms stalls are so cool! ?With so many amazing restaurants in NYC, not sure if this place is at the top of my list, but definitely a must for Iron Chef fans!

I was REALLY looking forward to eating here because I'm a fan of the Iron Chef and of course I wanted try Morimoto's infamous cuisine. I wanted to give this restaurant 5 stars, but I just couldn't-- maybe it was my fault? Did I order the wrong thing? I don't know. Sigh. I ate here literally a couple hours after arriving in NYC (my very first visit there, yay!) with my boyfriend and my sister. We ordered: - Rock shrimp tempura: ABSOLUTELY DIVINE. It's light, crisp, and the sauces were super tasty. Probably my favorite part of the meal. - Sea Bass (my dish): Meh. I should've gone with something "safer" like the braised black cod so that I wouldn't be disappointed. I dunno, the bass wasn't seasoned enough and I wasn't too impressed with the avocado tempura or japanese eggplant. Small portion, too. - Duck, duck duck (boyfriend's dish): Delicious! Perfectly roasted on a buttery croissant. The bf was happy with his choice! - Roasted ocean trout (sister's dish): Also delicious! The trout was flaky and it came on a bed on what tasted like mashed potatoes but 5x better than mashed potatoes. Maybe it was the truffle they added to it. Very flavorful. - Our dessert was this rose infused mascarpone cheesecake mousse thing with hibiscus gelees and tiny basil madeleines. Yes it was good and it was cool to experience the different layers of flavors... but at the same time, too much going on I think! Overall I was happy I got to eat here, but I don't know if I'll visit again. =X Maybe to try some different dishes? We'll see!

Goddamn it!! ?We're suckers for flashy neo-Japanese fusion cuisine. Sumthin' about sushi served in an ultra-modern setting gets my juices going. **Ethan Hawke alert! ?Our first movie-star sighting in NY! ?Yep, the Academy nominated actor sat right behind us during dinner.** Heard that Morimoto was the new heavy-hitter in town and we just had to try it. ?Wifey and I already knew we'd love it because we're such big fans of Nobu and overpriced, flashy Japanese food. We ordered the omakase (of course) and wondered if we'd ever become jaded by such extravagance while the country was in turmoil during these down economic times... silly us, we loved it! ** Ethan Hawke update! ?Wifey didn't believe me when I told her that Ethan Hawke was sitting behind us. ?I said, "Didn't you see Gattaca?!?!? ?That was a great movie, and probably where he met his ex-wife Uma Thurman. ?Wifey continued to doubt me until she asked our kindly server if the man with the characteristic goatee was indeed the star of "Training Day". ?Our server confirmed his identity and from that moment on, wifey kept staring back and wondering if it would be okay to take a picture with him...** We started off with a wonderful toro tuna tartare and moved to an excellent striped bass and clam seared with hot soy and oil. ?Then things got interesting with a foie gras chawan mushi. ?The consistency... ** Ethan Hawke bullitin! ?As wifey continued to stare longingly at one of the stars of "Dead Poets Society", I saw ?the manager walk over to speak personally with the head sushi chef. ?He was saying something to the effect of "whacha got that's really special for Mr. Hawke?". ?The chef looked somewhat annoyed, but produced a fantastic looking plate of superbly fresh (and expensive) morsels from under lock and key. ?The manager dude looked at the food, nodded his head, and said, "that'll do." ** Our sushi plate came out next. ?While not as exotic as Mr. Hawke's, I was pretty happy with mine. ?We had a nice assortment of toro, snapper, mackerel, and sea eel. Aaaah, our main course. ?Morimoto produced his version of surf n' turf with half a Maine lobster in chili sauce and a big hunk of wagyu beef with ginger and scallions. ?SWEEET! ?I looked over at wifey and said, "check out the size of this lobster, honey! ?The claw is as big as my fist!!! ?Honey???..." ** Ethan Hawke continuation. ?Wifey must've pulled the camera from her purse several times. ?She had a look of anguish on her face as if she couldn't decide whether it was worth the humiliation of approaching the award nominated actor, writer, and director and getting rejected for an autograph. ?Mr. Hawke seemed pleasant and approachable... ?** Our desserts came. ?It was a phenomenal sweet potato cake with a delicate sweet potato ice cream and azuki beans. ?Absolutely kick-ass!!! ? I got up to take care of some business (drank too much coffee earlier) but I don't think wifey noticed because she was too busy staring at Ethan Hawke. Anyway, the restrooms at Morimoto are worth mentioning. ?They carry the super high-tech toilets that are motorized, mechanized, and would probably make your coffee in the morning if you programmed them. ?I must've stayed in the john for 20 minutes playing with all the buttons. ** Ethan Hawke finale! ?I wanted to see how much his bill was. ?After all, the star of such blockbusters as "Reality Bites" and "Before Sunrise" could easily afford the pittance that Morimoto offers. ?As I tried to lean over to view the tab, a couple of servers stepped in between us and ruined my chance. ?Wifey screamed "Get outta my way!" ?I told her it was okay, I was just curious about his bill. ?Wifey told me she didn't give a rat's ass about the bill, she just wanted to get a better view of his eyes.... ?** I ended the night by paying a hefty bill. Wifey's night ended when she watched "Assault on Precinct 13" and paused the video on Ethan Hawke's ass.

I was expecting some orgasmic 'panty dropping' dishes from you that night! ?Only one dish came ever so close... the Kumamoto oysters topped with foie gras and sea urchin. ?ABSOLUTELY DELICIOUS. ?Good job. Everything else on your menu was laden with teriyaki sauce or some kind of sugary sauce. ?Surprisingly, your fish in sushi and sashimi didn't taste that fresh. ?Tomoe has better quality fish for half the price. ?Your presentation, however, were absolutely phenomenal and breath taking. ?Some were too pretty to eat! ?After you robbed my friends and I of $150 each, we all left hungry, dissatisfied and disappointed... but nicely buzzed since your sake selection was plentiful. pros: Kumamoto oysters topped with foie gras and sea urchin, beautiful space, beautiful people, beautiful bathroom cons: left hungry, most dishes were covered in sugary sauce, sushi/sashimi surprisingly tasted average

I just had Christmas Eve dinner with my fam here! I was extremely excited to come here even though i've heard mixed reviews of this place. The restaurant itself is GORGEOUS! so modern and classy! The food.... hmmm.... All of us got the Omakase. 7 Courses... Tuna tartare- Excellent! and presentation was AWESOME! It was tuna with a little bit a caviar and 6 other "toppings" and a side of ponzu dipping sauce. Delish! Oyster Fois grois- Eh... sounded good on the menu but the teriyako sauce was a little much. Yellow tail sashimi- I think it was yellow tail... i forget. But this one was delicious.... it had a ponzu and sesame oil sauce with snow peas. Very good! Some kinda fish carpaccio with lotus fruit cake salad- THIS ONE WAS GOOOD! 3 kinds of dipping sauces! Sushi- 5 Different kinds of nigiri sushi. Very dissappointed. The quality was not superb. It was not creative. Very mediocre. Lobster- Indian spices.... random.... the lobster itself was juicy and good. Kobe beef with sweet potatoes- Similar to korean barbecue Kalbi. Eh... Sweet Potatoe cake- A light tasting dessert. It was alright. Came with a side of coconut sorbet and red bean mousse. This was dissappointing because i expect a lot from desserts!! All in all, each dish was pretty good but as a "course" it was extremely scattered and not unified at all. Towards the end i thought i was in a Japanese/Indian/Korean restaurant. And i was really dissappointed with the sushi. With an extremely good reputation, i expected the fish to be melt-in-my-mouth, high quality fish. but no.... I think this is the kinda restaurant where people go to once just because its an "Iron Chef" restaurant and never return again. It was a fun experience tho! But for $120 per person, i don't think it was reallly worth it...

Dear Morimoto-san --- I fell in love with your cooking while watching you on Iron Chef, dreaming that one day, I'd be able to dine at your restaurant and savor your cooking. ?I even bought your wonderful book ?"Morimoto: The New Art of Japanese Cooking" - large, gorgeously photographed and full of really interesting recipes and ideas. As I had no chance to dine at your restaurant, I tried out your recipes instead - lobster and foie gras balls,eggplant shigiyaki and your gorgeous pork kakuni with scallop porridge; all this time dreaming that one day, one day, I'd dine at your restaurant and taste your food for real. The day came but the experience was bitter sweet. ?Your artful dishes inspired joy. ?The portions were way beyond what is usually expected in a Japanese restaurant. ?Your appetizers of toro tartare, crispy rock shrimp tempura, kobe beef carpaccio, pork kakuni, yose dofu , fois gras chawan mushi were brilliant - I wished your server could have mentioned the portion sizes and cautioned against ordering too much. ?Would it have been too much to ask? ?He could have gently mentioned or made a suggestion - I would have found it helpful and tempered my enthusiasm and leave space enough to order dessert. ?Alas it was not to be - he did not seem to care about us and was acting like nothing more than an order taker at a fast food restaurant. Your entrees were truly inspiring but for the Duck Duck Duck dish which was essentially "chinese roasted duck" with 3 different sauces (one of which was not even sauce- since it was a whole duck's egg) and where was the fois gras?! ?For shame - it was more a smear of fois gras on the croissant like butter on bread- a gross misrepresentation of your menu "fois gras croissant". I was most excited about your yose dofu having read and re-read the pages of your cookbook and studying pictures of you preparing it. ?You write about drawing your customers into the process - wowing them by transforming steaming hot soymilk into silky tofu in 10 minutes right in front of their eyes! ?Well I was not wowed at all - thanks to our server who was less than enthusiastic about the process. ?He came with the claypot of soymilk added in the nigari and told us very blah-blahly that we should not peek - he'd be back in 10 mins. ?Well, we left the pot alone - and stared at it waiting for him to come back. ?He did not come back at all. ?Whatever. ? A server of Indian decent finally comes but he had such a thick Indian accent that it just marred the whole zen "tofu" experience I had dreamt of sooo sooo often. ?His service was also clumsy which did nothing to enhance the experience - he ended up dishing out only one bowl and left abruptly even though there were other bowls to fill for the rest of the table. ?Sigh. ?The amount that was being charged was surely not for the food only but the service and sadly, Morimoto-san we got very little service or any of the promised drama. ?I had to avoid thinking that I could get the same quality hot fresh homemade dofu for a dollar a quart in Chinatown instead of paying $16 at your restaurant. ?Sigh and double sigh. Most of the night, your servers were milling around congregating in corners and talking amongst themselves. ?Much as I love your food, I am sad to say, I am very unimpressed with the dining experience. ?I wished I did not dine at your restaurant and left it a dream - at least there would be something to look forward to. p/s I hated the bottle wall. Yours truly, A Fan.

There are two reasons I give this place three stars. ?First, the salmon on the sashimi platter was disgusting. ?I've had better salmon from the supermarket, here it tasted like tire inter tube. ?For the main course, I had the surf and turf. ?The wagyu filet was edible, but not great. ?There was significant variations between the pieces of meat. However, the hamachi ribbons were to die for. ?The long of the short is that for the price everything should have been amazing. ?Additionally, the drinks were great and the service was good.

I've eaten here three times and let me say: MMMMM... oh-toro!! ? This is the first thing I think of when I hear morimoto restaurant mentioned and sometimes it's the first thing I think of when I wake up in the morning. Do you love sushi? ?Sashimi? ?You do? ?Well, then you should DEFINITELY try the most fantastilicious sashimi ever. ?Oh-toro. ?It's fatty tuna. ?When you eat it, it's like eating a slice of heaven. ?It's so soft and so fresh that it melts in your mouth and slides down your throat smoothly and delicately. ?Not a sushi or sashimi fan? ?Well, I'd say try this stuff anyway because it's so good... but if you're allergic to it DO NOT TRY IT. ?Tasty, delicious sashimi is no reason to sacrifice your life. Okay, well if you REALLY aren't into sushi or sashimi Morimoto does offer a wide variety of other delicious dishes. ?And his Asian fusion creations are so innovative and creative that I doubt you'd be unable to find a dish that you'd love. ?I would definitely recommend the Rock Shrimp Tempura which comes w/ a wasabi aioli and spicy type aioli. ?(Side note: When the restaurant first opened they had a buffalo sauce aioli but then I wrote in the comment card that they should change it to the aioli in the Philly restaurant and THEY DID! O_O) Basically, the food and drinks are great, the service is fantastic- all of the staff is so friendly and accomodating, they go the extra mile to make your experience wonderful. ?The decor is wonderful! ?It's sleek, modern and simple... and the bottle wall is gorgeous. ?PLUS they have phenomenal bathrooms. ?I mean like WOW. ?You didn't think bathrooms could be that amazing? ?Well, sit down on these magical toilets (which have heated seats) and you will see a remote on the side that will wash and dry your butt in a serene setting. I love this restaurant through and through but my major gripe is that I feel it's overpriced, but I suppose you're not just paying for fantastic service and food, you're paying for the name of Mr. Masaharu Morimoto (who you will find behind the sushi bar or floating around amongst the tables- he's been there all three times I've gone). If you'd like to try the restaurant but find it to be too stressful on your wallet, just go in and ask to sit at the bar and order a drink (try the White Lily as a cocktail! ?It's delicious! [ I think it's $12]) and maybe even share an appetizer. I definitely recommend going here to try the food.. and if you're not a crazy food lover like myself, definitely go to try the magical toilets. ;D

I remember my first ever Morimoto exprience in Philly and how in heaven I felt. I've been trying to reach that euphoric state ever since in New York. The first time I went was a 4 yelp star exprience, I definitely loved some of the dishes but I wasn't feeling it was as good as the one in Philly. My disappointment loomed over me until two weeks ago when I went again for the omakase. YUMMMMMMMMMM! Every, every bit as good as the philly restaurant with some really gorgeous cosmopolitan flares. It's really hard to write down how I felt. I just wish you could've seen my face chewining in slow motion with a tear coming down one eye as I had the wagyu beef. If I were to do ala carte I would definitely get the lobster, the wagyu beef, the oyster with foie gras (will make you drop dead by it's pure textural, tasty, sweet, ocean-like, fatty deliciousness), and the sushi. His sake collection is epic and the most delicious in the land. I recommend when you come here to go big.

Here's what I can remember. To not get: Chicken soup. I love salt the way most folks like sweets but the broth was almost inedible. Good lord, it tasted like they dumped 15 packets of that Top Ramen soup base in there. Lobster entree. Wah wah. Grilled lobster, a tad tough, aint nothing special to see here. Poor choice on my part. Salmon entree. Whaaat a disappointment. I forget what the description on the menu said exactly but the dish most definitely did not live up to it. I just remember it mentioning grilled proscuitto & I was sold. A filet of salmon sitting in a broth of pureed tastelessness and if the slice of grilled proscuitto was any tinier, it would have been invisible. Bo-ring!! To get: Sashimi obv. I had two pieces of the wild salmon, fresh & delish. Hamachi tartar appetizer. Felt like I was a judge on Iron Chef (Presentation: 10 points!) I don't know how to descibe it but it's like smushed hamachi on this wooden harp or something and you get a mini paddle to first scrape some of the fish off and then dip it into one of three dishes of crunchy...balls. I don't know. One of them was masago, I know that. Rock shrimp. Good dipping sauce! You get three diff kinds. I like choices. Didn't have any dessert, like I says, I don't eat sweets. The specialty cocktails were unmemorable cept for the fact that they were tiny. ?The drinks took up just over half the martini glass, which I thought was sneaky bc obv they cost like 18 bucks. Stick with a glass of wine or champagne, which is what we did. Anyway, we ate & drank a lot and the bill was over $400. Conclusion and summary: The place is overrated and the food is exhorbitantly overpriced for how average it tastes.

Ok, honestly, I went here a longgg time ago (like over a year...I just joined Yelp ok?!) but I will never forget this meal as it was one of the best meals I've had in my life. Ever. As soon as you walk in, you know this is fine dining (Japanese style). ?The restaurant is beautiful and white. Very modern. ?We waited down at the bar for the rest of the group to arrive. The highlights I remember: -Appetizer Morimoto sashimi- they have toro, hamachi amongst other favorites plus sauces in these cute little eye droppers. ?The fish is excellent and the eye droppers put a whole new spin on science class for me! -Foie gras- I didn't eat this but everyone else enjoyed it My favorite was a hamachi entree we had. ?I can't find the proper name of it but it was a very hot bowl with raw hamachi and rice. ?The hamachi lined the bowl so that one side was cooked and one side raw. ?Perfectly cooked. After this experience, hamachi is my favorite sashimi. I'll never forget the moment I put this in my mouth! Morimoto is so creative. ?Everything looks as good as it tastes and vice versa. ?The colors and plating is always perfect and you can see he really pays attention to every detail. He really re-invented modern Japanese cuisine for me that day. ? This place is expensive-- keep that in mind! For the four of us, we spent about $400 WITHOUT drinks. ?Ok, we ordered about 15 dishes... Next time I am in New York, I will definitely be back!

Morimoto was definitely on my list of must trys during my first trip to New York. ?Who doesn't love Iron Chef Morimoto?!? His restaurant is located in the MeatPacking District in New York. ?We took a cab ride to the restaurant not too far away from our hotel. ?The entrance was hidden behind huge red curtains. ?As we passed through the red curtains, we found our way into the restaurant by a sliding door. ?Right away we were greeted with the hostess to our right. ?Straight ahead was a wall of lights that leads to the bar area downstairs. ?Beautiful decor, beautiful lighting, great service, and very friendly staff. We were seated to a pretty small table for 2. ?Didn't bother us at all. ?Our waiter was extremely nice; she made many recommendations for food orders and drinks that turned out amazing! Here comes the food: 1. ?Toro Tartare: OF COURSE WE GOT THIS!! It was featured on FOODNETWORK: THE BEST THING I EVER ATE. As Duff from Aces of Cakes said during the show, who in his right mind would take Fatty Toro and mince it all up??!!! Are you serious?! Chef Morimoto does! I mean DELICIOUS!!! The side garnishes really make this dish so fun and innovative! From the Raw Bar: -Spicy King Crab : Delicious; the spicy cream sauce was a perfect match with the sweetness of the king crab. -Kumamoto Oysters: LOVE this as well; it was presented laying delicately on top of a huge bowl of ice. ?Served perfectly chilled. Definitely a different texture compared to the oysters we have here in NOLA. We really don't like all the sauces and creams that most sushi rolls are done these days. ?Nothing fancy..nothing fried..not covered all in mayo cream sauce. ?We just like simplicity...just to taste the fish itself. ?So we decided to go with the Chef's combination of sashimis and sushi. -Chef's Combinaton: of sushi, sushi rolls, and sashimi. ?there's a 30, 50, 75, and up options. ?I believe we picked the $50 option. ?It was excellent. ?Fish was very fresh. ?Wouldn't expect anything less here. For an entree: 1.) Ishi Yaki Bop: OMG. This was awesome! The Ishi Bop was prepared right at the table. ?The rice was served in a HOT stone bowl. ?There were pieces of that burned crisp rice you get when you cook rice over a flame WHICH I ABSOLUTELY LOVED!!! I use to scrap all the crunchy burnt rice when my grandmother use to cook her rice over open fire. ?This dish definitely brought a very fond childhood memory for me. I cannot remember what we had for dessert for the life of me. ?But overall Morimoto is a MUST TRY! The Toro Tartare ALONE keeps me dreaming and dreaming...ahhhh....i love NY!

I'm so glad I have a sugar mama friend that treats a poor college student like me to an expensive place like this! Everything from presentation to taste was phenomenal. The tempura rock shrimp did not have the nose burning fake wasabi taste and the shrimp had a nice crisp crunch to it. The hamachi tartare was excellent with four different tastes but it was so little in portion it left me wanting more. Main course we had the: Duck duck duck one of the best duck dishes I've ever tasted. The ocean trout: was okay, nothing too special about the dish. We also decided to get a bottle of sake to complement our food and after drinking a couple cups, I decided to go to the bathroom. When I got there I was stuck in a rut. "HOW THE HECK DOES THIS DOOR OPEN?!?" In my drunken state I tried to figure out the puzzle by pushing, pulling, looking for buttons, and waving my hands in the air (while doing my pee dance...you know what I'm talking about). Then finally after 5 minutes....eureka, some person from the other side opened the door for me. "OH YOU SLIDE THE DOOR." ? After getting inside my drunkenness thought was taken over by the Japanese toilets (who doesn't like pushing buttons? ) I was in the bathroom for so long my friend had to come down and "rescue" me....haha.

Very very expensive, but perfect for a special night out, when you want some place with atmosphere! The decor is beautiful, designed by super famous architect Tadao Ando. The food is perfectly presented. I didn't try any of the appetizers, but if they are anything like the entrees, I'll bet they were delicious! I'm always hesitant to order fish when I go out to restaurants, because in my opinion, its so easy to screw up. They can come out too dry, too crunchy, too flavorless. But Morimoto's made it perfectly juicy and tender. The flavors were really good. The cod is probably the best. I'm usually not a "citrus" person when it comes to desserts, but the elderberry creme brulee was absolutely to die for. It had citrus accents, but the flavors blended so well together, oh my god... And you have to try out the bathrooms! They have Japanese toilets -- heated toilet seats... and more!

Another high-end ultra-luxe type of restaurant where your food will be delicious and the service splendid. So let's talk about what makes Morimoto's memorable (or not): - The service was remarkably accessible, and I felt like I was a normal human being here. -The decor is very chic, and I'd definitely come back to visit the bar, especially since it is not far from home (although the location has much to be desired, being located under a dark passageway and amidst much scaffolding). Considering the contrast between the outside and the inside, you'll feel you've been transported to an alien alternate universe. Interesting bathrooms with the highest tech Japanese toilets (at least in America). Still can't say I like the idea of a bathroom attendant. - Good Asian fused food, but not necessarily the best. The black cod, in my opinion, was better at Nobu; the angry crab doesn't beat davidburke&donatella's angry lobster. But all delicious no less, and you will go home generally happy. Also, don't waste stomach space on sushi - it's no better here and not worth it over the other dishes (as with most high end Japanese places). - I didn't pay, but I'm sure it's understood that it will be $$$$.

You gotta love the Iron Chef. After going last year to Morimoto in Philadelphia for my birthday dinner, I decided to replicate the experience in NYC, this time with my parents. Compared to the Philadelphia one, I think I prefer the New York location. Although the food quality is equally excellent (as I will describe momentarilly), I had a slightly more pleasant dining experience overall. The interior is great - a cream color dominates the room from the undulating ceiling to the comfy chairs, and a warm lighting lends a more intimate feel to the overall large dining area. The bar/lounge downstairs is darker and filled with blue tones, and (I have to say it) the bathrooms are gorgeous! Not only are the toilets similar to the stereotypical crazy electronic Japanese kind (it vibrates?!), but the wall behind them has, like, suspended flowers/petals/something really really pretty behind glass. Our waiter was very nice and helpful, answering all of my parents questions (I already knew that I wanted to share the sushi/sashimi omakase as our entree) as they contemplated the appetizers. They finally chose to try the Yose Dofu, which was fresh tofu prepared tableside with two sauces: lobster ankake, and dashi soy with fresh wasabi. May I add that the wasabi is REAL wasabi and therefore MUCH spicier than the generic one. The tofu really is made tableside - someone from the kitchen came out with a steaming bowl of...something, poured some other liquid into it, stirred and explained that it needed 20 minutes to set before we could eat it. It was a little weird, but let me tell you, once we tried it I knew that THAT was how real tofu was supposed to taste. Delicious with a soft, creamy texture, and that lobster sauce was damn good! The sushi/sashimi was beautiful (one roll looked like a checkerboard design!) and incredibly fresh and delicious as always. There was this one piece of itty bitty shrimp that tasted like lavender, it was so good! As always, the yellowtail and scallion roll blows my taste buds away, as did every fish there, to be honest, but I can't for the life of me remember all the types - it was so much! Since it was my birthday, I had the perfect excuse to gorge myself into oblivion, and therefore was the only one to have dessert, trying the Caramel Cinnamon Chiboust, which has an apple confit atop some thin cake-like bottom and topped with a huge cloud of cotton candy, with sakura miso caramel and vanilla bean ice cream. The cotton candy was delicious, the apple/cake thing tasted slightly off by I still enjoyed it, and well, damn fine ice cream! I was so stuffed afterwards, I quite literally walked from the restaurant (10th Ave and 15th St) to Madison Ave and 51st where my feet finally gave out just to burn off all that food. It was wonderful! My one complaint is, despite the different decor/architecture of the NYC joint, it still gets very loud inside, though not as loud as the one in Philly.

Like Nobu this is another so-called "celebrity chef" loser. Real Japanese operations treat the clientele as VIP's while Morimoto's expects you to be honored to be in their snotty eatery. From the front door cold-shoulders to the inattentive and lackadaisical wait staff to the rude chefs this over-hyped and over-priced joint sucks with a capital "SUCKS!" While the Sake was good and fare was above-average, the arrogance of the entire staff made our evening unforgettable - unforgettably lousy!

Upon booking this place for my boyfriend's birthday after we both thoroughly developed a taste for it thanks to the Lucky Rice Festival last year, he promised me two things he wouldn't do here: 1) he wouldn't blow his nose in the cloth napkin and 2) he wouldn't stack his plates for the waiter and risk dirtying himself Well, he behaved well (or else punishment was lined up) and we really delightfully indulged in the 7 course menu option for $120.00...each. ?We weren't pressured to pick this option, but my theory on life is to spend money on the things you'll always remember - and this night is definitely amongst one of them. ?Austin was a very enthusiastic waiter, and knew the menu inside and out. ?We picked the cheapest premium sake to do a little birthday toast, at $22 and knew in advance to not be staggered by the pricing. ? Each course was dazzling to behold and savor. ?From the tuna tartar, to the sashimi and sushi platters, to the lobster and steak "surf and turf" platter, I truly enjoyed watching my boyfriend's wonderment. ?Each course was served with grace and was explained in complete detail by various waiters. ?Service was impeccable; I would not accept anything less. ? Austin even brought out my boyfriend's dessert platter was a very simple candle and thin bar of chocolate, printed with a "Happy Birthday." The whopping total was ~$285 without a tip added. ?Again, this place is not for the following types of people: 1) the faint of heart 2) the animalistic eater 3) the recession wallet 4) the ignorant of the meaning of "Iron Chef" And 5) the "presentation doesn't mean anything to me" Come to experience something rare, elegant, and so tasteful, you'll want to take cooking classes.

Hurray for Morimoto! Thanks for having the ability to actually serve up some good food. To be honest, I expect most chefs out of Food Network to be a total fluke, but then again he's only featured on that one show. Admittedly, I've never ordered any sort of sushi at Morimoto's, which is pretty much a crime, but whatever. On my first visit, I had the rock shrimp, and the "Duck Duck Duck". The rock shrimp was pretty solid, but it's not something that I would order again there. The duck dish was very enjoyable though. The fat between the skin and meat was completely rendered out, leaving some perfectly crispy skin, and super tender meat. I do have a small complaint however. The duck is extremely rich. I love rich food, but this birdie sunk into my stomach like a rock. It tasted great, but leaves an odd feeling in your gut. Basically, it's a very heavy entree. On other occasions I've tried the angry chicken and their molten chocolate cake. The chicken was nothing to write home about. In fact, it was a tad bland. As for the cake, it's was . . . . . relatively good, but no longer on the menu. Let's face it though, this is Morimoto's. The sushi is probably their claim to fame. Perhaps on my next visit, that would be my food of choice. Additional notes* The staff was very attentive and friendly. They even accommodated my mistake of booking a table on the wrong week. Hilarity! As for the decor, let's just say that this is definitely your $$$$ restaurant, high tech vibrating Japanese toilets and all!

Eh. ?That's it. ? The restaurant was beautifully done, the restrooms alone are worth an admission fee, but the food at lunch during restaurant week was definitely on autopilot. ? As other diners have mentioned, the menu for a prix-fixe lunch during restaurant week is pretty basic. ?Peter ordered the chef's sushi lunch, which came with a miso soup and salad. ?I ordered the black cod bento box lunch for $27, which was the same as the prix-fixe except it had a few pieces of tempura and the portions of the salad, soup and cod were smaller. ?It was very adequate. ?For dessert we tried the tofu "cheesecake" which had a fluffy interesting texture, and was garnished with crystalized ginger and lime zest, but also came with a maple syrup sauce that was far too overpowering for the dessert. This is Morimoto. ?I have seen him on television working miracles with tuna and flying fish roe and there was zero magic on my plate. ?I have had equal bento lunches, both in taste and presentation, in any corner sushi place, and that is a damn shock and a damn shame. Service could not have been nicer or better, with special thanks to the waiter who told me that the cool chopsticks I wanted to steal were made by Tampopo, so I could leave with my head up. ?The restaurant decor is really chic and stunning, the Japanese toilets with numerous cleansing and...um...massaging...options, were intensely amusing. ?Even if you don't have to, you know, go...you should go. ?The lounge downstairs where the toilets are gets five stars for glam factor. ? If you mention you're a fan you can get an autographed menu. ? The best thing we had was the spicy tuna roll on both our plates. ?The miso soup was salty. ?Overall, completely underwhelming. ?We will come back for dinner, because I think that in anticipation of Restaurant Week, they undershot their menu in order to be able to accomodate the crowds, which really worked against them. ? Truly unimpressive in every way. ?Good, not great.

For months before my trip to NY, Food Network was on at home all day, everyday! If I wasn't a foodie before, the hours and hours of FN I viewed (in conjunction with my glowingly distinct palate) made me a bonafide one. With Iron Chef as one of my and my brother's favorite show and Morimoto being his fave Iron Chef, again, no brainer that we were going to hit up Morimoto! Pack packed meal schedule during this trip, but we managed to fit in Morimoto for lunch on Monday. Right off, I have to say, I love the ambiance. A lot of glass, sleek birchwood and blacks. The place settings complete with the little chopstick rester and clear plastic chopsticks. Service was exceptional. Our server had a fun French accent and full of charm, explained the menu with great detail, and offered great suggestions. On to the food... We decided against the 3 course prix fix menu which was a deal, but for the price we could order sashimi and a la carte or bento box. ?I ordered the beef gyudon bowl which comes with soup, and a mixed green salad with kobosu vinaigrette. Plenty plenty of food. The soup and salad (refreshing citrus flavor) were exceptional, and decent sized portions. The beef gyudon was delish, but admittedly, nothing I haven't had before, and I might even dare say that the sauce was a bit too sweet. What I did enjoy was the sashimi. I'm not super adventurous when it comes to raw fish, but the salmon and tuna were phenomenal. Perfect sized, and literally melted in my mouth. All said, they were quite pricey, and orders were one piece versus the two or three other restaurants offer. My brother ordered the black cod bento box that includes soup, salad, tempura and sushi (a nice mix of nigiri and spicy tuna rolls). Everything was quite enjoyable. Tempura was lightly coated and not overly greasy. By far the best valued meal on the menu. On to the bathroom...yes, the bathroom deserves a brief description of praise too. Separate washrooms for men and women--a plus! Super clean, I used the restroom twice because it was a trek to our next destination, and who knows when I'd encounter a bathroom this clean in NYC! Sliding aluminum doors, simple and clean colored surfaces, and a water spraying, warm seated toilet! Need I say more?! Would definitely recommend Morimoto, and envision that I'd go back for the sashimi, overall chic ambiance and bathroom alone!

While it saddens me to say it, 3 stars is generous for this place. I've eaten good Japanese around the world, including all over Japan, and Morimoto just doesn't stack up in terms of food or service. Pros: - Amazing pork belly congee - Nice ambience Cons: - Every other dish, considering the price. ?Our table had 12 in total and I tried them all. Some were good. Others were just ok. Nothing else was great - Waiting 25 mins at the bar with your whole party despite arriving on time for your reservation - Service staff who are so keen to turnover the table that you actually have to stop your conversation and tell them to go away. No, we're not finished. See the food on my plate and utensils in my hand? Do I look finished to you? Not good enough guys. I won't be back.

Every time I have plans to check out a restaurant I've never been to, I'm always debating whether or not to check out how many stars it received on Yelp. I'm sure you've heard that saying, that the key to happiness is having low expectations? Well I think there's definitely an element of truth to it. Come to Morimoto with Iron Chef (ie. 4 or 5 star) expectations and your belly will be upset. Not in the shit your pants kind of way, but you'll leave feeling disappointed and slightly jipped. The restaurant is a swanky place, but far too big for my liking. Felt kind of impersonal and this came across in the food as well. A friend said that the food "wasn't made with love," which might sound weird, but I can see where she's coming from (contrast with the cosy, intimate, warm feeling of Babbo and it's dishes). Don't get me wrong--the food is above average and very well presented. If you're going, I'd stick to a whole bunch of appetizers (beef carpaccio, lobster fritters, toro sashimi) which were more inventive (and tasty), compared to the duck, chicken, or fish entrees. So, hopefully I've lowered expectations a little and the next person who reads this review then proceeds to dine at Morimoto will have a swingin' finger lickin' good time. You can thank me later.

Being the idiots that we were, my bf and I decided to go to Morimoto without a reservation on a Saturday night. ?I remember a feature the Food Network did on the opening of this restaurant and Morimoto himself talked about this tuna pizza which I really wanted to try. ?The decor was modern and trendy which makes a great atmosphere for an outing on a Saturday night. ?The wait was 2 hours but the bar does offer the full menu and the wait for something to open up is a mere 10 minutes. ?There was only 1 or 2 waiters at the bar area but our waitress made her best effort to be as attentive as she could. ? We ordered, of course, the tuna pizza, the sea bass, the ishi yaki "buri bop," and some sake. ?The brui bop is basically slices of yellowtail cooked on a Korean style hot stone. ?The tuna pizza was delish! ?I wanted to order another one immediately after. ?The sea bass, which was served in a black bean sauce with shaved ginger and hot oil, has to be one of the best sea bass I've had. ?It was so fresh you can taste the "crunch." ?The sauce, although a bit too savory, complemented the fish very well. ?As with the yellowtail bop, they cooked it in front of you, adding a little fun to the dining experience. ?Other than that, it was nothing too exciting. ?The yellowtail certainly did not taste its best cooked this way. ?The sake was light with a hint of sweetness. ?We skipped dessert so we can get some cheesecake at Junior's after. ? Definitely worth a try!

Keep in mind we came here during restaurant week and had the pre-fixed lunch menu option. ?I'm sure had I come here for ?dinner on a regular night with an unlimited budget, I would LOVE this place. ?The food was good, but not great, as probably expected for the pre-fixed fare. ? However, I LOVVVEd the interior of this place. ?The architecture and decor of this place is pretty breathtaking. ?You must check out the bathrooms, even if you don't have to pee. ?You'll see what I mean. Plus I saw THE man himself (Morimoto, duh) sitting a couple tables down from us. I wanted to approach him and take a pic with him, but I settled for taking secret photos of him from afar- paparrazi style.

Proprietor: Masaharu Morimoto i'll be first to admit, that i fall deeply in love with the soft & sophisticated mannerisms that is so elaborately displayed at this restaurant. ?even walking in, you know you're in for a real eye treat. ?natural beige, white, glass clean lines...looks posh without the actual "poshy" title. ?from the restaurant setting, to his dishes...morimoto tells a story. ?a story that displays reverence and eloquence for the love of food that is highly showcased in his skilled & fine technique. i want to give this place five stars...i do, i do, i do.... but I can't. ?I don't think it's the end all and be all of Japanese food, at least not yet. it's my second time here and both times, all I can think of was their tuna tar-tare. ?it's morimoto's signature dish and watch out for their osetra caviar that comes with it.... ?it's heavenly. the overall dish is very well executed. ?I was less impressed with my sea bass.... beautifully presented, but fell flat on the boring side for me. Other notables... their tuna is excellent. It was crusted with sesame and herbs that was so well-seasoned, the piece of fish popped "zest" in my mouth. ?It was a sure pleaser and wonderful treat. ? lastly, I was really surprised about the dessert. ?white chocolate panna cotta. ?very untraditional japanese dessert...but it was a total knockout. ?subtle white chocolate, with the texture of panna cotta i love so much. ?i just wish i had more than 3 bites. ?damnit! i'm biased and love morimoto to death... i think i'm more in love with his sushi here than I am his traditional Japanese fare. ?so i will be back and hope to visit his other affluent restaurants nation/worldwide. ?One city at a time.

It hurts me to write this but it was just ok. Granted, the service was excellent but that's expected. ?The decor was modern and trendy but that's also expected. ?So it all came down to the food. My wife and I went all out...no holding back...this was our dream! ?We pretty much ordered everything...sushi, appetizer, entrees. ?We ate a lot but unfortunately, something was missing. ?The WOW was lacking. ?I wasn't holding on to the side of the table. ?My muscles didn't contract when I had the uni. ?I had to chew the toro. ?The only thing that stood out was the couple next to us. ?They were all over each other like green on wasabi (cheesy joke). ?They disappeared for about 20 minutes. ?Ummm...I guess he wanted a different kinda sushi. ?I almost started eating their food. Maybe we went on a bad day. ?Maybe my taste buds were dehydrated. ?I don't know but something definitely was missing. ?To top it off, it was extremely overpriced. ?Probably the most expensive meal we've ever had. Don't get me wrong, the food was good but not Morimoto good.

The food here was delicious, but I'm not sure it is completely worth the price. ?In particular, everything I ordered was soaking in butter. ?For example, I ordered Morimoto's take on surf and turf: ?hamachi sashimi w/ kobe beef filet. ?Delicious sounding, and it was quite good, but why soak (and I really mean soak... the beef had puddles of butter on each slice, and the accompanying potatoes also were quite buttery) the beef in butter? ?Isn't the point of kobe beef that it is so tender by itself? ?It really took away from the experience. But there were three things that make the experience worthwhile: 1. This place has unbelievable decor -- really outstanding looking (the scale of which you would expect to find in LA, not NYC). ? 2. The service was very impressive. ? 3. The bathroom. ?I'm serious. ?First of all, they have heated toilets (HEATED TOILETS!?). ?The kind you find in Japan that also offer "drying" and douching services. ?But there is just something about sitting down on a heated toilet seat that you gotta love. ?The toilet stalls are also rather strange in that they have this weird plexiglas background that makes you feel like either you are in the woods, or there is someone standing on the either side watching you pee. ?Either way, definitely an experience.

Like every other shi-shi-glamour restaurant in Meatpacking, this one fits the mold just as well. Gorgeous hostesses- check Insanely beautiful interior decorating- check Celebrity awareness or frequency- check Hype- check Carefully crafted food too pretty to eat- check Overall, a wonderful meal. I think this could have been a disappointing meal if not for the fact that I cheated a bit. A good friend of mine has been serving here for some time ?so I texted her and asked her for the restaurant's best dishes (objectively speaking.)....And I am really glad I did or else I think Morimoto would have received fewer stars. We started off with the Toro Tartare. Toro is the less frequented fatty tuna generally found in higher quality Japanese restaurants. Usually more expensive, Toro is definitely worth the price. This one was a work of art. Literally. Instead of chunks of Tartare as per the norm, Morimoto's comes pressed into a wooden board and served in a huge glass bowl of shaved ice. There is another small board with different mousse garnishes (a wasabi, an avocado, a teriyaki-type paste, and a creme fraiche). They came with tiny spoons perfect for ensuring that you properly scoop that "one-lick" portion each and every time. Honestly speaking, the Toro was a little lost in the garnishes and I didn't get the same oomph that I usually get from a good tartare. Unfortunately the beauty in this was only skin deep and I'd preferred to have kept this on as art. ? With that being said our entrees were very good. We shared the ?Duck,Duck,Duck. and Surf and Turf. A wonderful crispy and juicy roast duck accompanied by a duck croissant with foie gras and tender pieces of duck. The portions were good and although the croissant was less than impressive (very little/non-existent foie gras and didn't love the cucumbers) the red miso sauces and HUGE raw duck egg yolk (which you had to pop and mix with the duck sauces were innovative and definitely lent some major flavor points to the croissantwich. The Surf and Turf was great. Tender filets of beef and an incredible raw hamachi with avocado and fingerling potatoes. The ingredients were fresh and the presentation was clean. Dessert was great. We had the Tofu "Hot & Cold". A wonderful trio of soy milk souffle (light, whipped air), tofu cheesecake (creamy but not heavy) and maple ice cream. Solid, melt-in-your-mouth goodness. A few things I really liked- the service was good. Efficient and very well timed. The beautiful glass walls and lounge area downstairs. I like how Morimoto is divided into intimate and celebratory areas. The upstairs is very loud, festive and great for popping champagne and fresh sushi. Downstairs is darker, trendy and perfect for a little intimate necking. Also, their bathrooms are pretty amazing. The reflective glass walls make you feel like you are peeing in some kind of never ending Autumn forest and the toilets are smarter than some people I know. They can do just about anything you want them to, short of changing your outfit and curling your hair. Also, on my way up from the magical land of Morimoto toilets, I ran into Mr. Morimoto himself in all his Iron Chef glory. That was pretty awesome. One weird thing. Does this place not have full-sized bottles of wine/champagne? We got a bottle but it was SO tiny. Barely big enough for a full glass. We thought maybe it was just the bottle we got but saw others with miniature bottles as well! Definitely not worth the money for a bottle at this place. Hand me a martini next time please. Not sure if I'd go back but definitely glad I went. :)

Being the super anal control freak, I was given full reins to plan my recent NYC trip. ?So, since there are so many great eats at decent prices, and because I'm cheap, and I hate pretentiousness, I pretty much skipped at the $$$$ places where reservations are needed weeks or months in advance.....Blah. But of course we didn't adhere to my 3 page itinerary completely, and on Sunday night we found ourselves wondering what we should eat...so from the suggestion of my friend we called Morimoto and they had open tables....lots of them...its is Sunday...and shoot...who can afford such expensive dinners in this economy? ? The order: Morimoto Amber & Black Brew - The beer was not exceptional but it is decent and it's kinda cool since you can ONLY drink it there since it is not available anywhere else. Toro Tartare - This is there signature dish and is the cover of their website. ?This is awesome! ?It's not chopped fish....it's finely finely ground fish served with caviar and 5 different condiments. Tuna Pizza - Contrary to other reviews I think this is decent. ?Tasted very good, but other things on the menu were much better. Uni - I have never seen Uni in such small pieces----this is a compliment! ?I'm a self-proclaimed Uni pro. ?I make this all the time. ?First, in California Uni has to be a certain size for you to "fish" it. ?This size Uni would have been illegal. ?Second, Uni is a delicacy and is pricey, not so much that it is a rarity, but rather because the cleaning/pre process is done by hand and is very time consuming. ?The smaller the Uni, the more delicate the meat, the more harder to prep....Anyway....super super fresh mini Uni. ?They give you lots of pieces, so you're not getting ripped off. Various Sashimi - I know we ordered some...probably Hamachi or Salmon, my usual faves...but everything else was so good I can't remember this part of the meal. Blowfish - ??? Yes, blowfish! ?I frequent the "Blowfish Restaurant" in SF, and they don't even have blowfish! ?They serve it "4 ways" here...hahaha...I guess this is an Asian thing. ?Anyhow, served: Sashimi the body, Shread the skin, Deep fry the fins, Soak the bones in Hot Sake. ? Wow, wow, wow, wow. ?It's a must try. ?And contrary to popular belief, you DO NOT need to sign a release of liability....hahaha. Saga and Rice in Stone Pot - So dish after dish, I was impressed and didn't think the next would top the prior...but indeed this one did. ?Saga, apparently is only served in one restaurant in the US, and that's at Morimotos. ?Stuff melts in your mouth. ?We stared at each other, speechless. ?Orgy in your mouth...yes. Tri Color Sorbet - Perfectly flavored, even the "I don't want dessert, I don't want dessert" person loved it. The damage: a little over $300 ?- Not bad at all!! Did I mention decor was awesome...and so is the cleaning toilet...LOL. ?Yes, I'm devirginized. ?I tried the water spraying, pulsating toilet....

Morimoto, I will always love you. The first time I came to this restaurant 6 years ago, I was swept off my feet by how impeccable the food was. To be noted, I was a novice to sushi at the time and this was my first 'raw fish' experience. I have been to morimoto several times after that and I believe the highest accolade I can pay this establishment is to vouch for how consistently amazing this food has been. If you're coming here get the tuna pizza, sashimi, snow crab legs (AMAZING), and a roll or two. Oh, and try to score a table near the open 'kitchen'; you can watch the staff make the meals.

Oh. My. Orgasmic. Gawd! Here's the thing...I thought I was actually going to pass out from the tasty delicious goodness of this place. All around, from start to finish, this place was amazing! Nice little stop at the bar, since we were early. Bartender down there was so funny, and was just a great chatter. Super friendly and super fun. Our waitress was a doll! She was amazingly friendly, as well as super informative. While the place was busy and her sectoin was hopping with customers, and she was still able to be there for every moment, with everything we truly needed. The food....dear gawd...it was so freaking good. I could have died and gone to heaven! Start out with the appetizer of blowfish (freakin super delicious!). We had a huge selection of the chef's choice of sushi (it was honestly like 60 or 70 pieces of mouthwatering sushi) and the surf and turf (a beautiful selection of Kobe beef and a yellowtail and avocado "salad"). The chef brought us out a complimentary plate of scallops, which were just tasty as all hell. DANG! I mean...this place was just so delicious! I honestly thought that I could have easily been killed that night and been completely fine with it! Honestly...everything was beautiful. The service, the decor, the food, the taste, the everything. LORD! I loved it! A true experience everywhere. Oh...and if you do by chance happen to come out and check out Morimoto...head downstairs to the bathroom. Dear lord! You didn't have to do anything here. It was like it's own little thing on it's own...really, it was it's own personal experience. I mean...hell...check it out. I'm not going to let it out. You can see for yourself.

This place was definitely my second best sushi experience, next to the fish markets in Japan at six o'clock in the morning. Ah where do I ever begin.. I'm kind of an architecture / interior design aficionado so when I stepped into this restaurant I knew it was love. The design of the place &the placement of everything was just so beautiful &mesmerizing. It was a shame I couldn't take pictures inside because I most definitely would have done so. And the bathroom.. omygod.. I spent an extra five minutes or so just playing around the toilet seat &taking pictures &such. The food.. oh my.. what more can you really expect from Japan's & American's famous Iron Chef? Appetizers, sushi, &earl gray creme brule make up for a lovely lunch with my dad.

Masaharu Morimoto has always been my favorite Iron Chef, so when I saw that his place was participating in Restaurant Week, I gathered my friends and booked a lunch immediately. Good thing one of my friends knew how to navigate the Meatpacking District, otherwise I probably would have gotten lost a few times on my way there (I have no sense of direction). When we got inside, I was awed by the decor - clean, chic, and modern, with a touch of whimsy: the beautiful glass "wall" in the middle made of what looked to be stacked bottles and alternating soft blue and green lights, the fabric on the ceiling folded to look like a "tin roof," and of course, the bathroom - a sort of shadow box with falling leaves, and a mirror behind it to make it appear as though the leaves were stretching out into eternity. LOVED. IT. The food was no disappointment, either: crab cake croquettes that were crispy but not greasy, beef gyudon with sweet onions and a hint of ginger, and the panna cotta - creamy and light, but not too sweet. I also ordered a drink called the "white lily" - soju, yuzu juice, calpico, and lemon juice. Couldn't taste the alcohol at all, and it had a hint of grapefruit - even though no grapefruit was in the drink! And best of all, the price fixe menu was $24.07, which is a total steal. When I'm no longer a poor student, this place will be at the top of my list of places to spend my hard-earned money.

[I went to morimoto for NYC's summer 2009 restaurant week. I'm writing this now because I didn't have a yelp account then.] Most people know Morimoto as iron chef japan from the original as well as the current iron chef show. I'm sure I'm not the only one who drooled like a starving puppy while watching him cook incredible dishes in only an hour! "I must go to his restaurant." Seeing how I would have to sell a kidney to afford his food, I patiently waited for restaurant week and immediately made a reservation once the opportunity arose. The interior of Morimoto is definitely different than most places I've been to - it's very.. cold and aggressive. I like it! I wish the food was as good as the interior however.. For my prix fixe lunch I had a tuna salad as an appetizer, black cod with dashi sauce for my entree, and a mango panna cotta for dessert. We also ordered an eel and avocado roll to share. ... Seriously? What is this? I could find better food in my school's cafeteria. (If my cafeteria served cod with miso. You know what I mean) I'm neutral about the salad because it's a starter salad. Whatever. ? I'm very dissapointed about the entree though. On paper, cod with a dashi sauce sounded delicious! When it came out, I was surprised at how big the piece of fish is considering cod is an expensive fish. Under it was avocado tempura and roasted red bell pepper. The sauce was poured on top of everything. Since nothing was really heavily seasoned in this dish, I expected the sauce to really shine. This gloopy sauce was basically a mild dashi broth thickened with cornstarch. COME ON. It ?was not a very flavorful meal. The avocado tempura was interesting though - I've never had it before. It wasn't as heavy as I thought it would be. The eel/avocado roll, for this kind of place and the price, was disappointing. It wasn't bad but I could get this same or even better quality in my local sushi restaurant. Fail. Then came dessert. The clouds parted and rays of golden sunshine shone on my grey table. The rays of sunshine being mango panna cotta! It was served with a tiny biscuit and had a layer of mango puree. It also had a subtle taste of coconut in the custard which paired very nicely with the tropical mango flavor. It wasn't too sweet but not bland either. Just right. Service was good too, nothing amazing or terrible enough to write anything significant about it. So Morimoto, I give you one star because you look cool and have kickass bathrooms. I give you another star because you mesmerized me with fruit flavored custard.

This was THE MOST MEMORABLE dining experience EVER. And you get what you pay for... worth every penny. If yelp offered 5 $ signs, this would be in that category. ?It's not just dinner - its an event. My friend and I decided to go with the Omakase menu with wine pairing. The service was exceptional. I've never had such AMAZING service. The timing that the food came out was impeccable. The presentation of each dish was beautiful. The ambiance was elegant and trendy. Even the iron chef himself came around and greeted his guests! The overall experience lasted 3 hours and you may get to meet a celebrity/master chef.

Three of us ordered and shared: Starters: - toro tartare - Morimoto Sashimi - oyster w/ foie gras and uni - uni chawanmushi - steamed scallops w/ xo sauce Entree: - 20oz wagyu rib eye w/ a side of morel mushrooms and bowl of rice. - chirashi sushi - black cod Price tag: ~$400 w/ tax and tip & one cocktail each. We absolutely loved everything, in particular, the 20oz wagyu rib eye was cooked a perfect medium rare and the meat was so tender that it practically melts in your mouth. ?The side of morel mushrooms (athough a tiny bit too salty for me) was an incredible compliment in texture and flavor. ?This was a perfect time for a bowl of white rice (yes, it was $5 a bowl) and I wondered, was it super good and therefore it's so expensive, or because it was so expensive, it must taste delicious? #2 favorite was the uni chwanmushi. ?The creamy texture of the chawanmushi and the buttery yet pungent uni were a perfect harmony. ?It was so good!!! I would have given this restaurant five stars if it were for the slightly disappointing Morimoto sushi. ?It was extremely creative to layer tuna, slamon, toro, hamachi, etc. into a long strip then cut into small squares served w/ 5 condiments of sauces inside plastic tubes you squeeze. ?But, honestly, the flavor of the fish were entirely jumbled up and I really didn't taste anything distinct from each other. ?There were bits of mushroom placed within the fish slices and on one of the layers, it was prob eel which had a very distinct flavor and did not match the hamachi. ? All in all, I was bummed about this dish, because I remember him using a similar presentation on the Iron Chef show. Finally, dessert. ?We ordered the tofu hot and cold w/ hot souffle and cold soy tofu cheesecake which was quite yucky and we also ordered the panna cotta which was really interesting. ?The panna cotta was served upside down inside the lid of a miso bowl with sorbet and kizukiri noodles inside the bowl. That was creative and new and I loved it. All this deliciousness came w/ a hefty price tag, but it was all well worth it. ?Mr Morimoto's creativity and talent really comes through.

Then came my wagyu filet mignon with asparagus and white rice. ?They poured an AMAZING sauce which was kind of a teriyaki ponzu sauce over it on the sizzling plate, and the sauce caramelized on the steak PERFECTLY and was divine! ?The steak cut like butter and was probably the best steak I have eaten! ?Not even lying, and trust me when I say I eat a lot of steak. ?I think my teeth are dull from eating steak. ?hahahaha jk but anyways...Domo arigato Mr. Morimoto hahah

Okay... so I'm biased. I used to work here. But here's a great opportunity for me to tell people what my favorite dishes and what I generally think of the restaurant. First off, there is a Morimoto in Philly and that's where "Iron Chef" Morimoto has his first namesake restaurant. I hear it's smaller and less trendy but still visually impressive and good food. Cocktails: Try the White Lily. It's made with sudachi shocho, calpico and yuzu juice. Have you had a Louisiana satsuma fruit? Well, this is it, in a martini glass. I also like ?the Autumn Leaf. If you like chai lattes, you'll like this. Apps: Tried and true and therefore not very adventurous- go with the Rock Shrimp Tempura. You get 3oz of deep fried rock shrimp in Morimoto's buffalo sauce and another 3oz of fried shrimp in a wasabi aioli. Pretty presentation, go with the Zen Sai. It's a Japanese antipasto plate. You get salmon sushi wrapped in bamboo leaf, mackerel wrapped in cedar wood, duck meatballs, califlower flan with lobster meat and lobster consomme, and a small bowl of sesame dofu. Toro tartare is also very pretty though not much food. So it's not a great one to share. You get 7 condiments to go with the toro ranging from nori paste to avocado puree. Oysters foie gras is fantastic. You get 3 oysters topped with uni and foie with a little terriyaki reduction. It's all served over aromatic salt and spices so the dish smells lovely. The lamb carpaccio is a small portion by the ginger scallion dressing with raw meat is so freakin' delicious that you'll savor every little bite! Also the foie gras chowan mushi is fabulous. Small, but rich and creamy with just a little thinly sliced duck meat to top it off. Entrees: People seem to order to buri bop a lot but it's not my favorite. I find that it's prepared at the table with too much sauce and the dish just doesn't do it for me. Instead, I prefer the "Iron Chef" chicken noodle soup the pork kakuni (which is really an appetizer) and the Wagyu ribeye. Honestly, I'm an appetizer person. I love to try little bits of everything so entrees are less appealing to me. Too much commitment to one dish! The decor is beautiful though a bit cold for my taste. I like eating in places where I feel very comfortable and cozy. This is a place you come to when you're feeling swanky and showy. Like, you're here to be seen and cause a scene. It's definitely NOT the neighborhood-y restaurant that I adore so much as the behemoth establishment you and your friends get together to go and splurge. You'll most likely do some celebrity spotting when you come in and there's definitely a buzz about the place that makes it fun. If you're out to impress a client or you have a date that likes the sparkly, good life, this is a great place to check out.

I saw HIM here. Morimoto was standing at a counter near our table in the back. This was last Saturday. I'm positive that he heard the oohs and aahs coming from our table so the floor manager offered to have Morimoto come over for a picture! Wow! His pony tail is really thick. He was wearing jeans and he drops by the New York restaurant about 2-3 times per week. The food was another highlight:duck three ways, the sashimi, the rolls, seafood stew, and the soft tofu were all wonderful. The last highlight and big bang for our evening meal was the bidet. So many buttons, so little time!

Mr. Iron Chef you are a rock star. I like this location a lot more than the one in Philly. It is a sleek and sexy scene full of the beautiful people. ?There is a swanky little bar and lounge downstairs. The sushi bar up front also looks like a fun place to spend an evening. They have great selections at the raw bar and an extensive cocktail and sake list. The food is amazing and I think this place trumps Nobu for me now. Everything was just spot on. We started with some sushi and got the spicy tuna and California roll. That was probably the best sushi I've had and it was a perfect start. We moved on to some hot dishes and got the always reliable tempura rock shrimp and the delectable spicy king crab. The shrimp had both wasabi and spicy kochujan sauce. It was a little heavy and light on the shrimp. I prefer the preparation of this one at Nobu. The crab on the other hand, is stellar. It is a must have of two huge king crab legs with a spicy little sauce and tons of meat. It's easily my favorite thing here. We split the Sea Bass entree which was great. For dessert we finished with the apple turban (Is your turban dirty?) that had a tasty little cider sauce and cinnamon ice cream. Yum. This is one of the best meals I had in town and a place I look forward to returning to.

I agree. do NOT order the salmon ravioli. ?Wagyu steak was alright but the bathroom probably stole the show. Also, depending on where you are sitting, you sit so close to the next table that you feel as though they are joining in on your conversation.

i come here every year for my birthday and they have never failed me. I love the service and food. We even had the pleasure of meeting Mr Morimoto himself. It was quite the experience. I will definitely come back .And my goodness - the food is phenomenal! :)

Beautiful modern design. The restaurant is huge! I came here for lunch one day after working for Fashion Week. I was having higher expectations of this place especially since all my friends love it here. Service was horrible. The wait staff was just standing around talking to each other and taking forever when we mentioned to the hostess we were in a little bit of a rush. They took their sweet time. My mother ordered a sashimi platter and some of the fish was still frozen! Is sashimi supposed to be frozen?! My mom being the queen of restaurateur experience because she owned 2 restaurants for 20 years was HIGHLY disappointed! Overpriced. Trendy, and we are not coming back.

Morimoto is not the place for you if you don't like seafood and sushi. I was quite aware of this when I went and didn't expect to find much to eat on the menu, and I was right - there were just a few items that were veggie-only. I got the cucumber roll, and it was good but nothing more special than veggie sushi anywhere else. My dining companions (all non-vegetarians) were blown away by their meals. The dishes were truly works of art. My boyfriend's appetizer was gorgeous and delicious according to him. My brother said that his fish entree was the best he'd ever had. Since I can't speak much to the food at this place, I will say that the decor and atmosphere is worth a visit. The tables are sectioned off by glass walls, lending a bit of privacy from nearby diners but not making you feel closed-off. And, seriously, if you don't use the bathrooms, you are missing out. They have this crazy mirrored wall behind the toilet that has an infinity cherry blossom type tree thing going. Hard to describe - you just have to see it for yourself. I give this place four stars for the space and my dining companions' satisfaction. It loses one star for not offering any vegetarian dishes but the veggie sushi - how hard is it to throw one tofu and vegetable entree on the menu??

I decided to come here as a treat for myself during the holidays, and wow it was one of the best dining experiences ever. My bf hardly eats anything other than traditional American/Italian but he enjoyed everything, which made the experience for me even greater. First off, the restaurant is beautiful, from the glassware on the walls to the color scheme. When my bf and I arrived we were asked to wait at the bar (downstairs) for a few. No problem. I wanted to soak in the vibe and get all warm and fuzzy inside with some licks ; ]. MMMmMmm, I started with some shochu, which was good, then I had the snapdragon (at our table), it's similar to a mojito. Our table was great, I was able to view the whole restaurant from every angle. Our waiter was even better, she was sooo damn helpful. Briefly telling us about the menu and her faves; her sincerity and warmness was awesome. We had the: * rock shrimp tempura - very good; warm chunks of tempura shrimp marinated in two different sauces: a wasabi & spicy _?_ sauce, similar to buffalo wing sauce (it did come with a side of ranch, lol) * miso clam soup - MMMmm, saturated the liquor inside of me, got me feeling all warm and fuzzy in a different way * calamari salad - OMG I loved it, so good especially with a salad. The calamari was nicely done with a thin coat of crispiness, and the greens was fresh, and tasty because of the white miso dressing. * rib-eye - very good; more rare than what my bf wanted but it was fine, the accompanied sauce was so savory that I kept dabbing into it * sea bass - not buttery soft like I anticipated but it was very satisfying nonetheless, two nice fullfilling pieces with eggplant in miso * chocolate pecan brownie - not bad, the brownie broke apart easily but the expresso ice cream was rich - I scooped it all off my bf's dessert and topped it on mine * earl gray creme brulee - with orange sorbet, I slid the sorbet to the side for the expresso. Not that the sorbet was bad, my creamy dessert went better with the expresso ice cream. What an incredible experience my fives senses had. I also saw Morimoto, he was sitting across from the sushi bar, at what I assume is the owner's table, sipping on wine and greeting fans who approached him. I am so impressed that I'm taking my father here ASAP (yay for me, lol).

I just came back from dinner from Morimoto and I was underwhelmed. For these prices you expect more. SERVICE I went under the auspices of Restaurant Week and was told that they don't offer it for dinner. That was not specified on OpenTable. My friends and I decided to stay nonetheless. There were others that were under the same assumption and they did NOTHING for any of us. Not even a comp'd appetizer or a 'we're sorry' cup o' joe. Come on! Very very lame. FOOD Portion sizes varied from large to teenie. The green salad was large but a bunch of greens with 'so subtle I missed it' dressing. The lobster appetizer was good. Don't bother with the sashimi sampling appetizer - the sauces (which are the only differentiation) were flavorless. The shrimp tempura was good, and there was A LOT of it. (Score: 2 mediocre, 2 good) AMBIENCE The space was cool. I especially liked the bar downstairs. I think I got a 'Tiger Lily' which was tasty. My friends got 'High Lines' and one liked it, the other didn't. Acquired taste for peppery drinks. On the whole, I've been to better places in the city for less money. I expected a lot and was disappointed. I have several other stops on the Restaurant Week tour. For full price, NOT WORTH IT.

Morimoto is a wonderful sushi restaurant with a ?beautiful ambiance and design, great food, and the service is very professional. The menu is real authentic Japanese food/sushi served in interesting, beautiful and creative presentations/layouts. I have tried almost everything on the menu and everything i had was perfectly delicious, I highly recommend the duck, duck and duck which is amazingly delicious. Note: The service is slow and horrible. ? ? ? ? ? The bill might be a bit price.

All I have to say is: WOW. I was very impressed by Morimoto, and not just because of the delicious food. The interior is swanky, the waitstaff are friendly, and the decor is oh-so-very chic. Upon entering the automatic sliding doors, you're greeted by the host(ess), and led to the downstairs bar if your entire party hasn't yet arrived. The downstairs bar feels a little bit like you're in the arctic - the ice-like barstools and clear bartop are nice touches. And the wall completely made up of water bottles - well, now, that's you gotta see for yourself. The bathroom is also downstairs along with the bar/lounge, and you have to slide the door open to enter. In each stall there is a remote control next to the toilet - needless to say, I had to press every button. I won't tell you what buttons are on the remote, I'll leave that to the imagination, or to your future dining experience at Morimoto. For dinner I ordered a miso soup (delicious!!!!!!) with huge chunks of soft tofu and a really tasty broth, and the Ishi Yaki Buri Bop -- yellowtail on rice which is cooked in front of you in the hot stone bowl in which it is served. The fish is left half-seared, half-cooked, and it couldn't have been better. It was extremely delicious and my mouth is watering just thinking about it now. For dessert, my party of 4 decided to split the Caramel Cinnamon Chiboust (Japanese version of apple pie a la mode) and the sesame ganache dessert (I can't remember the exact name of it). The ganache dessert was the winner - hands down! It was like a grown-up version of a peanut butter cup. The presentation was superb and the dessert itself was pleasing to the palate. I would go back to Morimoto in a heart beat... once I pay off my credit card debt, that is.

Trendy restaurant that has the "trendy factor": overpriced and nothing exceptional. Our table had the seabass, black cod and raw fish for 3. - cooked fished were good - raw fish was just okay Service was extremely slow, preventing to renew the experience EVER AGAIN ! Go to Buddakan instead or any other asian fusion restaurant around.

I'm usually skeptical of high-design restaurants...but my friend who took me here is a real foodie (usually taking me to $5 Asian places or Korean bbq in Koreatown that are ridiculously good). ?So I figured the food at Morimoto's would back up the swanky decor. The restaurant certainly makes an impression when you walk in - the whole place seems to be one giant modern art sculpture with sinuous lines flowing throughout. ?The space is divided up a bit, making the huge dining room seem a bit smaller. It's definitely a self-conscious place - everyone seems to be sizing you up a bit (a bit disconcerting for someone who grew up in grungier and more relaxed NorCal, where you can show up anywhere in jeans). ?So dress up before stepping in here...since it can feel a tad like a catwalk on weekends. The food was excellent - the tuna "pizza" appetizer was fantastic. ?Really top grade sushi in a creative form. ?I also had the ishi yaki buri bop (kind of like a Korean dal sot bibimbop but with yellowtail instead). ?It was very dramatic (fitting of the restaurant) since they "cooked" the sauce and dish at the table in the stone pot. I'd definitely recommend morimoto as a 'splurge' dinner, it's a beautiful space and the food lives up to the hype.

I can't believe I only gave this place 3 stars, but I just think that there are so many better options for the price in Manhattan that spending the money at Morimoto is sort of a waste. The good: ?The space is amazing and the service was impeccible (but of course anything less would be unacceptable). The bad: ?Food was good and presentation was amazing, but something was lacking. ?Best parts were the desserts - really interesting presentation, and if you bleed sugar like I do make sure to get the fruit tart. You have to decide whether the scenster vibe is right for you, so that could go either way. The verdict: ?Go to Nobu or EN Brasserie instead.

I finally went back again! :)) oh so good to be back. This time my sister and I sat in the basement lounge tables. drinks: 1) white lily -- my fave! (look at previous review) 2) hydrangea -- (look at previous review) 3) snapdragon -- a.k.a. raspberry mojito. appetizers: 1) TUNA PIZZA ($18) -- my fave! read the older review for this. 2) WAGYU BEEF CARPACCIO ($23) -- this was soo good. kinda on the salty side. but the beef seemed kinda raw? i dunno but super tender. and the sauce-y taste was soy mixed with ginger and garlic. sounds not that great huh? but trust me it was! 3) CRISPY ROCH SHRIMP TEMPURA ($16) -- there were two kinds of sauces/flavors: wasabi and gochujang. (gochujang is red pepper paste.. korean) anyways.. dont worry if you can't handle spicy food! they weren't spicy at all but the flavor of wasabi and gochujang is present at the first bite and then comes back when you swallow it. there is a side of morimoto ranch dressing on the side also. desserts: STRAWBERRY CHEESECAKE -- it had some sorbet, not sure what it was.. something about wine. and it also had... ready? drum rolls please........ POP ROCKS! haha i loved it. i thought it was so.. great and ingenious! i mean how in the world did he decide to add that on when it's a "fine-dining" restaurant, you know? gah it was a lot of fun eating it. :)) like the good old days way back when, ya know? hehehehe.

I've always been a huge fan of Chef Morimoto so going here was like a dream come true. I ordered the duck duck duck and my b/f ordered the rib eye steak. My duck was warm, crisp and fresh. I loved how it came with 2 dipping sauces and a egg in the middle. It was a big portion and the croissant sandwich was fun. The only thing I would say is that I couldn't taste the foie gras. I'm not sure where they tried to incorporate it. I had a taste of the rib eye and it was amazing. Melt in your mouth juicy beef! I even got to try a piece of spicy king crab from a person sitting next to us and it was awesome! Soft, fresh and tangy from the sauce. The food and service was great but the bathroom was out of this world. Talk about fancy toilets!!!! Make a visit and you'll see what I mean.

Go here for a true experience restaurant. ?Amazing atmosphere. ?From the unassuming but once you see it awe inspiring entrance to the bathrooms with toilets that have more remote control buttons than my dvd player remote. ?Also, the food is really good. TIP! Hard place to find with no address; look for sliding doors with red cloth over them and japanese lettering. ?No sign I could see from the street. ?Make sure you have an address and you will be fine. We were tourists walking around the city for the day so we were a bit underdressed in jeans. ?No one made us feel bad and the service was excellent across the board. ?Everyone working in the restaurant was friendly and professional. Server made some excellent recommendations. ?She recommended the toro tartare (28$) which I am sad we did not get (according to reviews here on yelp) and she recommended the cod (23$). ?We ordered the morimoto sashimi (28$) which was good but a little steep price wise. ?It was 6 little square stacks of 5 thinly sliced sashimi pieces (5 different fish). ?It was tasty with the different sauces. ?The cod absolutely won me over. ?Delicious sauce, great toppings (shaved ginger) and had some type of pickled vegetable and black beans on the side which went great with the fish. ?Fish melted in your mouth. ?I didn't ever think COD could do that! ?We also had a 40$ sushi combination, the sushi was just good, the spicy tuna roll that came with it was really good though. We were a little hungry after splitting those dishes and wound up getting 2 desserts. ?Apple turban (12$) was very good with fresh apple slices, chopped pineapple underneath, and delicious cinnamon ice cream. ?We also had the flourless chocolate cake (12$) which was hit and miss. ?The cake had apple slices in it and rhubarb ice cream. ?I did not like the rhubarb ice cream at all. ?Apple slices were stuck inside the the top of the cake pieces but was not a good mix together. ?Cake itself was amazing but very only 4 small pieces of it. ?If they could do a huge piece of this cake without all the other extra crap I would get it again and again and again. As for atmosphere it gets no better. ?This place was extremely well designed. ?You will be ooo and awwwing the entire time. ?Make sure you check out the bathrooms, they are works of the art as is the glass wall in the middle of the restaurant. ?This was better than the Guggenheim. ? You will not be disappointed here. To make it a great date check out the elevated highline park (entrance is only a couple blocks away). ?Park has great views of the city and was built on an abandoned subway track (above street level). ?Truly a unique night for us.

What was that blinding whiteness in the restaurant? Was it the decor? ?A fabulous nod to Japanese architecture, modernized.. Was it Morimoto himsel? who came strolling out to smile and nod at guests (I cowered in the corner, in disbelief that the amazing Morimoto was within embarassment distance) Or was it the food itself? Who knows what it was, but my experience here was exactly that...a blindingly bright spot on my trip out to New York. ? The tuna pizza was tasty, the tempura shrimp as well (though not particularly standout). My favorites: ?The beef curry bread appetizer and my entree- the braised black cod was incredible. ?It was simply put...a braised piece of cod with ginger but blew any piece of sea bass I have EVER had. ?The flavors made it so that I silently begged my brain to remember each bite. Wow. Also our server was a fun and accomodating person considering that we can be quite a rambunctuous group...even recalled that I mentioned it was the birthdays of two people and brought out a little delicious birthday surprise! Love Morimoto more now than ever!

So I have been a Yelp user for many years and by now I do consider myself a "Man of Many Meals". ?I have been waiting for the right restaurant though to inspire me to write my first yelp review. ?THIS IS IT... On a trip to NY with my girlfriend I decided that we should do an Iron Chef America tour of NY. ?With limited funds I could only pick my top 3 Iron Chefs so I decided to go with Flay, Batali, and of course Morimoto. ?(check out my reviews of mesa grill and lupa for comparison) I think any chef who names a restaurant after himself better be able to live up to it, so I journeyed over to Morimoto's self titled restaurant. ?The entrance was covered with billowing sheets and when I walked in I thought I had entered an ice cave. ?Everything was super modern and shiny and glowing. ?It was really packed for a tuesday night. ?We decided to skip the chef's tasting (though all the other tables around us had gone with that) and just order whatever sounded interesting. ? We started off with Morimoto's sake and what a great way to start! ?The sake was so good that I could taste the honey, nuts and rice after each sip. ?For appetizers we did the pork belly congee, scallop sashimi, and king crab legs. ?The crab legs were perfectly cooked and the spicy mayo type sauce on top was delicious. ?The scallop sashimi was extremely fresh. ?The pork belly congee... WOW. ?I mean it's pork belly so already hard to go wrong, but the congee was made using pork stock and yeah, so much delicious pork-ness I couldnt stop eating. After the appetizers we were already full and I could've left happy. ? But of course we had to try the entrees so we got the duck served three ways and the sea bass. ?The sea bass was in a miso sauce and was very good. ?But after a bite of the duck I thought I was in heaven. ?The duck itself was cooked perfectly and they served it with a foie gras croissant that was absolutely THE BEST! ?For dessert we had raspberry tiramisu with peach gelatin. ?The tiramisu was good, but the peach gelatin was soooooo good! ? As I write this my girlfriend is remembering how good the congee was and says that she could eat it for the rest of her life. ?In conclusion, Morimoto's was the best meal of my life. ?Hands down, no contest! ?Definitely go if you have the chance but beware: all future meals will be compared with Morimotos and it might be hard to enjoy food as much.

Went here the Wednesday after Valentine's day for a post-Valentine's celebration. ?The ambience was very pleasing and the meal was rather nice, but definitely short of perfection. We both opted for the omikase (an 8 course tour de force), and I had a smaller bottle of sake (500 ml) to complement the meal. ? 1st course: ?Tuna tartare with caviar and a sampling of accompanying morsels. ?The presentation was exceptionally elegant with the tartare being spread over a board and served in a very large bowl over ice. ?A special scraper is then used to eat the food. ?A Japanese peach is provided to finish off the first course. ?A true hit by all metrics. 2nd course: ?Raw tilefish. ?Tender and fresh and I particularly liked how this was garnished. ?A success for me, but a miss for my date. ? 3rd course: ?Hamachi with a side salad. ?I am unable to recall the green that was used. ?Nonetheless, I do not like salads, but this was a very good one. ?And the hamachi was deliciously fresh. ?I was very pleased with this course; I alone. ? ? 4th course: ?Oyster served in a sweet sauce. ?This course was very disappointing. ?While the oyster had a nice taste of the sea, the sauce essentially did in the dish. ?It was very sweet, cloying really. ?It did not add anything to the dish, and seemed strangely inappropriate. ?It was both of our opinions that an entirely different course should be in order. 5th course: ?The nigiri sampler with 5 types of sushi including shrimp, clam, and toro. ?Wonderful, great sushi! ?To be expected though... 6th course: ?Intermezzo. ?Instead of a food dish, a drink was served whose principal ingredient was honeydew melon. ?This was very refreshing and cleansed the palate for the main entree. ?We both really enjoyed this drink. 7th course: ?Main course. ?Wagyu beef served over fingerling potatoes and a side of lobster. ?Deliciously decadent! ?Who would ever complain about such an upscale version of a classic pairing? 8th course: ?Dessert. ?Chestnut cake and ice cream. ?Very sweet, lovely, and enjoyable. ?Another hit. All in all, this was a very elegant restaurant with a strong sampling menu. ?I was fairly pleased with the exception of the oyster course. ?My date was less pleased. ?For her, there were a few courses that she clearly did not like. ?She insisted that we never do another tasting menu -- ouch! ?She would rather have one dish that she really likes, then a number of dishes where the consistency can really vary. ?Oh well. ?4 stars over all given the mixed reactions and the fact that my expensive bottle of sake was quite bland and did not match well with many of the courses. ?They really should have a sake pairing option for the omikase menu. ?Also for the price point, about $400 for the two of us, I really felt that we could have had a much better meal at Le Bernardin. ? And where was Morimoto? ?Apparently Thursday is the day he is typically at the restaurant -- another miss.

Morimoto OOOOHHH you brought me to heaven and back again. Had the omakase and i have to say... it was nothing short of amazing. From the first course to the seventh, it was truly a memorable experience. Between the excellent combos of flavors to the melt-in-your-mouth wagyu beef to the excellent service, this is one restaurant that I highly HIGHLY recommend!! It'll knock your socks off repeatedly until your so full and satisfied, that you won't even know what to do w/ yourself afterwards. Seriously... Only con I have (which was a big one) was that they have 2 small rooms at the very front of the restaurant that, if you sit in them, you're totally separated from the beauty of the restaurant's space. We were originally sat in the smaller of the 2 and I couldn't even bare it. I felt like I was stuck in a concrete box. If you can, do not sit there. Sitting in the main area is sooo much better! Other than that, GO! You'll definitely leave happy. :) *** If you need suggestions, here's what I suggest: 1) Toro Tartare - it looks like a shuffleboard w/ smashed tuna and all these different colorful accompaniments. it was ordered by many and loved by me :) 2) rock shrimp tempura - i didn't have it but apparently almost everyone else in the restaurant did. to me that means it must be good 3) wagyu beef - the waiter wasn't kidding when he said it was the best steak he ever had! sometimes i didn't know if i was eating steak or better. it was just that good!! 3) omakase - expensive but if you have the money, you'll never feel the same way about food again!

We came here on a whim during the my first night visiting NY.It turned out to be our favorite all around meal of the night. We got the chef's choice omakase. I thought it was well worth it considering the variety that you received. The standouts were the toro tartare, the whitefish carpaccio, and the waygu beef. I've since seen the toro tartare on the food network and recognized it instantly. It has an unmistakeable visual look. You essentially get to try the toro with a variety of accompaniments. Probably my favorite dish. The desserts were pretty unmemorable, but the experience was not. This is a really nice looking restaurant. Stylish but comfortable. It was a nice surprise.

I've been excited for this place all week. Though, I made a pretty rookie mistake in that I thought they had a restaurant week dinner menu when they did not =( My friends didn't seem to mind too much. The ambiance is great. Very clean and crisp, which gives it a nice modern look. The wall of bottles is also pretty stunning. The glass walls between tables is an interesting touch, gives you isolation while still feeling open. I had the ramen ("iron chef" chicken soup) and surf and turf (wagyu steak with hamachi yellowfin). They "fused" my yellowfin with guacamole and a vinegerette. I thought it was cute that my serve told me he was going to "fuse" it, then began to mix things up. It was probably the best part of my meal though. No sign of Morimoto though, maybe next time ...

Exquisite. ?Impeccable. ?Fresh. Those 3 words describe Morimoto's to a T. ?My friend and I wanted to have a bite in the lounge because we thought they'd be booked, but when we got there, there was hardly anyone there. ?It could've had something to do with the fact that it was a Thursday afternoon and not many people go there for lunch. ?Lucky for us! As we stood at the hostess stand to figure out if we wanted to be seated, I couldn't help but be truly impressed by the architecture and decor of the place. ?There's a wall of bottles that add a certain something to the place. ?The whole vibe is minimalist, but with a voyeuristic edge. ?The only "wall" was the wall of bottles and all other "walls" were just plate glass. Now the food. ?Oh the food. ?We ordered the prixe-fixe lunch menu and opted for the chef's sushi selection. ?I totally expected about 5 pieces to arrive on a large platter, but was extremely pleased when a whole dish of about 8 nigiri and 6 maki came out. ?This is how sushi was meant to be had. ?A small amount of rice beneath a decandent piece of the freshest fish. ?A touch of freshly grated wasabi (which has a totally different taste than the paste) and a touch of soy sauce. ?When you start lunch with the Kobe carpaccio and a carafe of sake, your tastebuds are in for a treat! ?Now that I've had Kobe beef, I don't think I can ever have it cooked. ?It was flashed with some hot oil (to activate the fat in the meat) and served with a medley of microgreens. ?To die for! We sat at the sushi bar and I was mesmorized by the skill of the sushi chefs. ?Their knife skills are top notch and the way they prepare the sushi is like nothing I've ever seen. ?They took such care in their job, as did the servers and everyone on the floor. ?It was the perfect lunch in the city.

My boyfriend surprised me by taking me to Morimoto for our anniversary. We had a 9:45 reservation and were seated promptly upon arriving. Although we were seated at a table in between two other dining couples, it really never interfered with our dining experience. We both got the 7 course Omakase tasting menu at $120 and a nice Pinot Noir priced at $80. Without going into too many specifics on each course, we were both blown away by how great the food was. From the Tuna Tartare to Kobe beef and lobster tail to the delectable pumpkin dessert at the end, it was a delight! To cap it off, Morimoto himself was there! A great sign that he cares about his restaurant and food. This was even better than I ever expected. Morimoto is a genius and delivered in every way possible. I can't wait to eat here again.

I expected a lot better food for these kind of prices!!! the only thing that I was impressed about was the decor. The sushi was fresh but nothing special for 45$ (9pieces and a roll), the duck was average....

The sushi was also very fresh. Service was excellent and the ambiance is hip and trendy The cocktail, White Lily was so yummy..at $14 dollars each...ouch and you MUST check out the bathroom when you come here...automatic toilets that cleans you..very cool will return again for sure!

Sushi ONLY As you walk in the restaurant, the opening doors already give you a "Wow" feel and the beautiful decor and people inside just make you feel fabulous. I give it 3 stars because of the gorgeous interior, meeting Morimoto himself, and having great service. The food however, was just average or slightly above average but nothing to rave about. I tried their angry chicken dish which was dry and nothing special. The sushi was super fresh and good but it was nothing that special and wasn't any different from other sushi places around. Maybe I just tried the wrong dishes but I definitely expected more. I can definitely say the sushi was at least better than the chicken. Overall, I think everyone should at least try it out and have a chance to meet the iron chef himself because I think he's there often. But I don't know if I'd make a second trip.

A very mixed experience here. We ordered the 7-course omakase, the iron chef ramen, the wagyu beef carpaccio and the toban yaki. There were a couple of really good dishes there: the carpaccio was excellent, and the surf and turf from the omakase was enjoyable. The sushi was fresh and perfectly seasoned also. Most other dishes were average and completely forgettable. And then there was the vegetable fondue. 3 pieces of stale-looking/tasting vegetable in a super salty garlic sauce. Something that I could whip up at home in 5 minutes myself using the stale veggies we have in the fridge. Toban Yaki consisted not so fresh seafood that was grossly overcooked and over salted. The pièce de résistance was the iron chef ramen. It looked like someone took several bites out of it. Soup was campbells chicken broth. The 2 pieces of chicken in the bowl had fork marks in them (WTH??), and the ramen noodles were NOT ramen noodles at all. It were leftover pasta. The decor is very trendy (as in trying too hard to be fashionable) and the service was nice but not as professional as we would have expected for the price point. I really struggled as to what rating to give this restaurant. Considering the price tag of $300 without drinks, I really wanted to give this place a 1 star. However, since there were some enjoyable dishes in there, Morimoto gets 2 stars. But then again maybe I should subtract 1 star for their food making my wife hopping mad, and the subsequent effort I had to make to calm her down. The verdict: food average to bad. Date night: ruined.

Came with very high expectations and left very disappointed. The food wasn't bad but it certainly did not live up to all the hype about this place. We went with the waitress's recommendations and ordered their most popular dishes. I had the striped bass on special, my husband had the black cod, and our friends ordered the sea bass and the duck. My meal was not enjoyable and my friends' meals were just ok. The decor was fun and service good. But it's REALLY NOTHING SPECIAL. Don't waste your money.

This is my FAVORITE restaurant in NYC. ?My trip is not complete unless I have at least ONE meal here for the week. First of all, the decor is nice, the bathrooms are beautiful and the dining is an experience. I've tried a ton of things on the menu but here's what sticks out: Ramen, Iron Chef Chicken Soup: ?Simple ingredients. Really good, but also, really salty. ?Keep your water glass close by. Calamari Salad. ?The best thing EVER. ?We ordered another plate of it as we were eating our first one. ?It's THAT good. ?Huge chunks of battered calamari, under a towering pile of mixed greens with the lightest dressing. ?Mmmmmm!! Tuna Pizza: ?sounds gross, but it's actually really good. ?They sprinkle jalepenos which is a really good touch. ?Adds kick. Toro Tartare: ?eh. ?It's alright. ?I think it's a little too much work for such little bite. ?If you want to play with your food, order it, if you're hungry, don't. Morimoto Sashimi: ?This is also one of those "work for it" dishes, but there's more to chew on. ?And really, you're just squeezing some colorful sauces out of cute little pipettes. ? Yosedofu: ?Tableside made tofu. ?Really fun to watch, and fun to eat. ?They give you a lobster sauce and soysauce to compliment it. ?Good stuff. Black Cod: ?Tasty fish but not as satisfying as the buribop! Ishi Yaki Buribop! So delicious. You must order this. ?The servers put on a production when they bring it to your table. ?They sear the fish along the sides of the stone pot while they mix everything else up, then neatly pile the seared fish back on to the center of the bowl. ?YUM! Chilean Sea Bass: ?Don't get it. ?It's bland and boring. Sushi Menu: ?I've had better sushi at much cheaper places, so to me, it's not worth ordering any sushi here. ?It's not exceptionally iron chef-y, so no need to waste time on this page of the menu. All in all, Morimotos is awesome. ?Try it!

Ahhhh, the Iron Chef comes at you with an assortment of asian fusion cuisine in an upscale setting in the meat packing district. First off, alot of people seem to be on the extremes for Morimoto. Many reviewers here on Yelp give this place 5 stars- and 5 stars it ain't. On the other hand, the NY Times gives it 1 star- no way- this place is much better than that. While it may not be 5 stars- it IS GOOD. Me and my gf went for our anniversary dinner. We started off with the toro tuna tartare. This was fantastic and came with 5 dipping sauces. Wonderful presentation and the tuna went incredibly well with the sauces. I recommend this. Next we sampled some of the sashimi- hamachi and salmon. Good fish, but not the best I've had. Next came the rock shrimp tempura. Very good and went nice with the creamy dill/cucumber sauce. We also tried the tuna pizza- which appeared to be crispy tortilla with tuna, anchovy aioli sauce, jalape?o on top. Nice idea, but...meh.. For main I had the surf and turf and gf had the chilean sea bass. Both dishes were very good, very well prepared but I felt they could have been seasoned a little less. Furthermore, the sauces for both tasted very similiar- kind of like a ginger, soy, sesame oil type of sauce. Not bad in any way but they could tone it back a bit. Also- the cocktails are REALLY good. STRONG, just the way I like them. Worth the price. Overall, I'd have to say I really liked Morimoto- despite the pretentious atmosphere and the intense pricing. These dishes were very creative in my opinion and competently prepared. ?Would we go back? Alas, no we would not. There's just better restaurants in NYC for this type of food. For example, Aquagrill and Blue Fin are better and much less expensive. Worth the trip once, though. We enjoyed ourselves.

Morimoto does not disappoint. Mr. Iron Chef's restaurant is all that I've heard about, and more. I was lucky enough to have my birthday dinner here.Amazing. The decor alone is pretty spectacular. It feels as though you are sitting in a crystal cube. The bar downstairs is cool. Glowing blue counter top along with a perfectly made Dirty Martini & Lychee Cosmo. Everyone is really friendly, the host brings you upstairs when your table is ready, the server is already aware of what your drinking and kindly moves the bar tab to your table. ta-da. Very nice..stress free. Dinner consisted of the Chef's selected oysters (loved the wasabi choice) tempura calamari & Sashimi salads (huge), whole roasted lobster epice (lemon creme fraiche is to die for) and the seafood toban yaki (more broth than expected). Aside from the deliciousness, the presentation is key here. The dishes are like small works of art. I was also hoping to catch a glimpse of the greatness himself because I heard he randomly shows up but no such luck. Will have to come back..less dishes next time though (ridiculous amounts of $$$$).

Went here for Valentine's day (yesterday)-- Interior of the restaurant is very pretty and calming. Staff/Customer Service- friendly and attentive. Food- -Soft shell crab maki roll-- it was very fresh and delicious, I could taste every ingredient. -Lobster fritters- I expected something fried to come, but to our surprise they looked like lobster meatballs... they were a nice surprise. Main courses: -Black Cod- cooked perfectly, not salty like a lot of cod dishes- served with a sweet ginger soy sauce-- really awesome. -Yellow fin Tuna over rice- it comes in a hot stone bowl and they mix it for you at the table (hello Iron Chef style!) It was very good, but the stone bowl wasn't cooking the tuna as much as I liked... but still good. Presentation was fun, overall delish. Dessert- Found that the dessert menu was underwhelming, went with a special they had - a chocolate caramel tart- it was veryyy rich and decadent-yum! Prices-- yowzers, but you have to expect that. Overall, we had a delicious meal with fast friendly service, the place is beautiful -- and the bathroom are pretty cool! I would say this is a great time for a special occasion when you don't mind splurging for delicious Japanese cuisine right next to the Chelsea market :D Giving this a 5 because I had an excellent time. Wish Morimoto was around though! Which by the way- we found out when he is in town he does walk around ... maybe next time ;)

I heart the Iron Chef. At the Philly location you can actually sometimes get a sneak peak of him. However, the decor at this location is classier and larger. It's very modern and beautiful. The service is also extremely accommodating. Have been here with my parents and with friends. The food is absolutely delicious. The omakase is the way to go on your first visit here. Otherwise for apps the Kobe beef carpaccio, crispy rock shrimp and tuna pizza are the yummiest. For entrees the seafood toban yaki and the black cod miso are phenomenal. My top a la carte sushi and sashimi picks are the spicy tuna roll, the yellowtail scallion roll, the hamachi, the unrgi, and uni. The cocktails are pretty yummy too especially the white pear!

Chef Morimoto is shorter in real life than on t.v. ?That's the first thought I had when I saw him at his restaurant. ?But then I realized I came to eat, and quickly focused back on the menu at hand. ? I had a cocktail there with Calpico in it and I tried to replicate it at home and had loads of fun tasting the attempts, but just can't master it like the Morimoto man can. ?Have 2 of them. ?Great stuff. Skip sushi rolls/sashimi. ?That stuff is standard and there are other places that serve it better in the city. ?Do the tartare and the carpaccio's, black cod and sea bass. ? Can't wait to go back.

This review is to confirm that Morimoto's never disappoints. I have been here a few times now since my last review and I absolutely love this restaurant. The food was delicious of course. My favorite appetizers: rock shrimp tempura (in 2 different sauces: wasabi and korean spiced) and the beef carpaccio (it melts in your mouth good). Still the best entree on the menu is the buri bop. It's a work of art how the waiter cooks the hamachi on the stone bowl and mixes the raw egg yolk into the rice. It looks so beautiful! My favorite experience is the way the staff treats each customer. The manager, James, came by again and brought complimentary wine to my table as I was celebrating my bf's bday. At the end of the meal, we also received a complimentary bday dessert. How sweettttt! Morimoto's will always be on my top list of restaurants. I highly recommend it! Oh and yes, Morimoto does come by- I saw him once at the sushi bar :)

Service: C Food: B Decor: A+ Dessert: C- The entrance is very grande and made you feel like you are in a samurai movie. The decor is breathtaking - white canvas ceiling hang throughout the restaurant, a panel of 10,000 bottles lit up with LED, and modern heated toilet + "infinite corridor"-like glass arrangement in the bathroom. The food, unfortunately, didn't match the quality of the decoration/architecture. We ordered the omakase along with several other dishes. The tuna tartar has the most beautiful presentation and has many types of sauce to accompany the tartar. The ceviche fell flat and contained too much oil. Smoked salmon was poorly paired with yogurt and spinach. The biggest dissapointment was the oyster with foie gras. The addition of 8 cubic cm of teriyaki sauce ruined our ability to enjoy the oyster and foie gras pairing. I can go on and on with the other entrees but there's a common theme: The food could have been better with less oil or less sauce. The service is extremely poor. Our server didn't care about our requests and we ended up being helped by the manager to get green tea or cocktail orders. To sum up, if you were to spend money, Nobu would have been a better choice. If you were to celebrate your birthday avec style, this is the place.

I should start out by saying that I don't eat fish/seafood, so I will not be able to critique that part of the menu. ? A friend and I came here for a pre-fireworks dinner on the 4th. ?We each ordered a cocktail and both were really tasty (I had the lychee one). ?I started with an order of the pork gyoza -- very good, very delicate -- and followed that with a veggie sushi roll -- also very good. ?Between these two orders and the drink, I was full. ?My friend ordered lots of fishy things and loved it all. ?She had room for dessert, which I sampled, and it was quite decadent. ? The food really was excellent, but it's not just tasty -- it's really well done: the dishes are made with such care and attention to detail. ? The staff was very friendly. ?Our main server was very helpful and nice. ?The gentlemen who brought our dishes offered to explain what each dish was, their various components. ?The restaurant ambiance and decor is really nice (and the chairs are really heavy!). ?The stairs down to the bar and the bar itself are really cool. ?And a visit to the bathroom is worth the 5 stars :-) ?Very modern. ?(I'm assuming the boys get the same modern toilets and decor as the girls.) ?I could hear my friend taking pictures from her stall... The bill was high, but I felt the experience and food were worth it. ?I recommend Morimoto and will return.

Get the $200 omakase. If you can't afford that, at least order the kitchen entrees or the $125 chef tasting(you might be disappointed). Whatever, do not order sushi here. Its not his strength. He excels in his cooked dishes. Please don't sit on those toilet seats. Its gross and you might bring home something off the menu.

So we were actually trying to go to Buddakan that day (I think it was last Thursday) but a private event had booked the restaurant and we were told to try their sister restaurant an avenue down. ?This place is definetely a business restaurant. ?In that I mean that the atmosphere full of rich professionals who probably aren't supposed to pay attention to the food. ?Prices are high, food was good (I liked the "ramen" which wasn't really ramen) but not worth the price tag in my opinion. ?If you're not dressed the part, don't expect much attention from the wait staff.

A great place for two rabid Iron Chef America fans to celebrate their anniversary. Frankly, a great place for anyone who enjoys this type of cuisine, provided you can stomach the Manhattanite club-goers littering the streets outside the restaurant. My lady friend had the rock shrimp tempura, the surf & turf, and some chocolate ganache desert. I had the famous toro tartare, the "Duck, Duck, Duck" and the Earl Grey Praline Creme Brulee. Everything was stellar, with the possible exception of the "surf" portion of my date's entree. No complaints, just nothing to write home about. Best of all, the man himself, Masaharu Morimoto stopped by the table twice during the evening.

I've discovered that the best food in Morimoto is not their sushi, but their appetizers. ?The pork kakuni, in particular, is amazing. ?I thought the tuna pizza would be a silly gimmick but it is actually amazing - think tuna tataki on a thin pita bread. ?The dish where they make tofu right in front of you (out of the soy milk and yeast) is fun - like making cheese from milk. You can order four of these apps and have enough food for two people, saving money in the process. ?And it's much more interesting than just ordering two entrees. ?And of course, the sake is still one of the best I've had and quite a steal for the price. The staff continue to be humble and gracious for such a trendy, well known restaurant. ?5 stars!

I've been wanting to go to Morimoto ever since..f-o-r-e-v-e-r! I remember talking about visiting the restaurant a few years back with a couple of friends, but our plans never worked out. SO! when the 2011 Restaurant Week list came out, I knew this was going to be my chance to get affordable (and good) Japanese food......ok, and mayyybe get a chance to meet the Iron Chef himself. The interior of the restaurant is really chic and modern - suitable for young professionals, students, as well as the elderly crowd. Since it was restaurant week, the place was (no doubt) bustling with people. Prior to our food, I ordered a non-alcoholic coconut drink topped with basil. Highly recommended for anyone who loves coconut! Even though we wanted to take advantage of the restaurant week prices, we couldn't help but look through the menu at other available options. As an extra side, we ordered the Tuna Tartare which was cleverly presented and super delicious! The sauces were laid out nicely on a rectangle wooden tray which included: fresh wasabi, sour cream, seaweed puree, chopped up green onions, avocado, and little rice cracker balls. We certainly attracted a lot of wandering eyes when this dish came out. The tuna itself was very fresh and light. I really liked the combo of rice cracker balls and seaweed puree with the tuna. The lunch prix fixe they offered came in an oversized bento box. We ordered the waygu and black cod bento box set. The set came with miso soup, fresh salad, fried tempura w/ some sort of creamy sauce, and sushi/sashimi. Unfortunately, the portions were a little tiny (I'll admit that I can eat more than the average girl, but believe me when I say the portions were definitely on the smaller side). I felt bad for the big hungry man across from us. Poor dude. The waygu beef was a little too salty, ordinary, and again...too small of a portion. The black cod on the other hand was great - with just the right touch of sweetness. The dessert served was a Green Tea Coconut Panna Cotta with berries on top. Taste was good, but nothing spectacular. The service was great considering our waitress had many tables to juggle due to restaurant week. Judging by the Tuna Tartare off the restaurant's original menu (not restaurant week menu), I would come back here again to try their other mouthwatering dishes! Overall: 3.8/5

Simply amazing. ? As a grad student, I dont indulge in nice meals often since my bank account is empty anyway, but Morimoto's in NYC was well worth the $80 spent. ?The toro sashimi slices melted in your mouth at a rate of nearly $15/slice and the oyster app with a touch of uni and other tastiness was about the same. ?I ordered the lobster main course for a whooping $39 but I would do it again in a heart beat. ?It was split and covered with a flavorful masala seasoning with a side of lime puff/cream. ? If you're in NYC or visiting, this place is simply a MUST stop. ?And don't forget to try the cocktails.

I went during lunch for restaurant week, so I didn't feel the snobbiness. I had the sushi, which was pretty reasonably priced. $25 will get you 8 pieces with a roll. It's probably the best sushi I've had. Our server told us that the fish is flown in from Japan 4 times a week. The rice is super high-grade. Wasabi paste isn't that green powder, there were some seeds, which gave it some texture. The salad was good. The only thing I thought was peculiar that you they give you acrylic chopsticks instead of wood. I know why they don't give you metal chopsticks, but anyway, I'm sure there's a reason for it. Our server told us that that same meal is $25.00 sans dessert during regular lunch periods. ?I didn't care for the dessert, and I liked my smooth espresso. I would definitely go again.

Decor: Gorgeous! ?I love the sleek, elegant white. ?and checking out the restrooms is a must! ?soooo pretty hahaha...I feel weird saying that about a restroom. Food: Wagyu beef bento box: I came here for restaurant week so we tried the wagyu beef bento box. ?The beef was very well seasoned, but the flavoring was very reminiscent of kalbi (korean beef). ?The miso soup was delicious because you couldn't really taste the the MSG and the soft tofu just melts in your mouth! ?The tempura vegetables came with a very interesting creamy cheese dipping sauce. ?Lastly, it came with 3 pieces of tuna maki and 3 pieces of sashimi (very fresh!) Sashimi: ?We also ordered 2 pieces of yellow tail and 2 pieces of japanese red snapper (prepare to pay 5-7$ per piece). ?Both very fresh. ?Normally, I'm not a fan of raw fish, but they prepare it so fresh that there is no "fishy taste" at all! Panna cotta dessert w/ mixed berries: very creamy, not too sweet, paired well with the berries. ? Overall, great dining experience, but so pricey!

We went to Morimoto last week. We had the $120 tasting menu, and 2 courses out of 7 courses were good. I was quite disappointed. Only two dishes were good - the Toro tartare and the sushi. Honestly, the rest of the dishes were okay and nothing really special about them. The dessert was horrible I think, it was a "chinese style" steamed cake ?with few red beans inside and a scoop of ice cream. We also ordered the 6 oz kobe beef, it was amazing good, but it costed $120!! I wouldn't want to come back to this place and I recommend to order the dishes instead of the tasting menu if you go...

Morimoto is Iron Chef for a reason. He really knows his flavors and experiments and presents new and unique dishes. Presentation of the food is art. The quality of the dishes were superb but the portions were definitely small. But nonetheless, great. The interior design of this place is flawless, down to the dishware and utensils. Loved the glass wall and the textures on the ceiling and walls. Chic. Classy. PS. We saw Guy Fieri at the bar downstairs. Yeah, we made eye contact. Also, this place has the swankiest bathrooms/toilets. Take a gander to the restroom, you'll never come out.

We went to Morimoto for Restaurant Week 2012, and were highly disappointed with both the service and food offered. Better bento boxes are easily acquired in Flushing for a fraction of the price, and come with substantially more to eat. I ordered the cod bento box, and my friend ordered the Wagyu beef bento box. Here is a breakdown of our respective meals: Wagyu beef: over-salted, worse than average stir-fry, tough Miso soup: nothing extraordinary Salad: simply dressed, underwhelming yuzu aftertaste Tempura: the highlight of the meal - lightly fried with the vegetables within intact and succulent. Interesting pairing with cheese Sushi: light and perfectly glutinous, good ratio of rice to fish Cod: soft and tender, enough glaze to satisfy The waiter was surprisingly inattentive, and neglected to bring us our order of green tea. At a price of $8 for a simple cup of hot liquid and tea bag, perhaps this was not altogether a bad thing. Overall: not worth the money or time.

Food was ok, not too big of fan.. Once again, it's a nice place to go once a while. I wouldn't go wild with this place However I am a HUGE HUGE fan of the bathroom design =) call me crazy if you ever been to Morimoto's bathroom you would know what Im talking about..

I LOVE THIS PLACE, but they need to give more foooooood!!! Recommendation *crab cake appetizer was SO GOOD. it's like a bite size of happiness with an amazing sauce. but they only give four pieces :( *I went during restaurant week, but actually got their bento box for lunch. ?If you want a little bit of everything, you should get this. bento box had: miso glazed salmon, tempora, sushi, miso-soup, and salad (?) ? *BEAUTIFUL INTERIOR. Great place to take a date or go for a business luncheon. ?I kind of felt like I was in ariel's oasis. It was so serene and calming. *Food is not filling and you definitely crave for more. but you can grab a wichcraft brownie nearby for dessert. ?that's definitely cheaper and extremely rich. ? ? *CLASSY and elegant. Hands down!

Came here with some regulars of the sushi bar so service got a bump for sure. We had a bunch of different dishes. We had some kind of tuna appetizer that you scraped tuna from a dish and dipped in a bunch of different sauces and sides. I also had the miso tofu soup, it ended up being a massive bowl not some side dish which I expected. My two rolls were the eel and avocado and spicy yellow tail roll. The quality of this place decent. I would say 3.75. I wasn't blown away. The bathroom had a facet that was loosely attached, kinda of janky for such a high scale place. It's all about attention to detail at a place this fancy pants. All the servers were great and overall a very high quality experience. I would definitely come back.

OK, Please remember this place is 4 dollar signs. I went here for my friends birthday party. We had a group of 9 people. We had a few of the cocktails before we got seated. The cocktail menu is small as expected but has a great selection that you probably wont find at another restaurant or bar, which is unique. The appetizers we got were toro tartare. I'm not really sure what it was supposed to be like, but it had a very nice presentation. The dish itself was very small. My friend and I were confused as how to eat it, but we managed and it was rather bland in my opinion. ?We also got the lobster fritters which tasted really good. Again the portions were a decent size. After appetizers, we had our main course. The prices vary depending on which entree you chose. I got a rib eye since i love steak. It was seasoned very well and the size, again, was a decent portion, not really big, but not really small. The staff was very attentive to our table even though the place was very busy. my glass of water was full all the time and if i ran low on a cocktail someone was there to receive another order, which is nice to see. After dinner, we got dessert of course since it had a nice menu. Plus, I couldn't pass up tofu cheesecake, which was amazing. I had the trio of tofu cheesecake, tofu souffle, and maple ice cream with maple syrup, again, a decent amount, and enjoyed it. Overall, I had expected the restaurant to be very expensive and the portions to be very small. I had a really good experience here and would definitely recommend all of my friends to come here. I would go back in a heartbeat for a special event in the future.

interior design, while fading and older, was really nice. service also nice but unaware. I did not enjoy the sushi at all. It made it worse knowing my bf was being bent over on the price totally ridiculous! 270 for two appetizers, a small plate of sashimi, a roll and medium grade saki. besides, I know my sushi. I really do. I grew up on it. the server suggested we start with a lox pizza with kalamatas.... what really? then duck fois gras. that was good had creativity and spirit. I then ordered a small sashimi platter to start, planning on having much more ?- the medium fatty tuna was good but it was all downhill from there. I told the waiter I do not eat octopus and do not care for salmon. Both were on the platter with 3 other options. a 55$ platter with 2/5's inedible? I hushed about the salmon and ate the oily farmed fish, but the octopus, I will not eat (like it, just on my "don't consume" list). I mentioned this (again) to the waiter and they brought something from the "tasting menu" we were delighted! Until it arrived soaked in a heavy, low quality oil.even my amiable bf was conscious of the fish swimming in a vat of oil. ?Over all, it was just a terribly uninspired menu and service and for the price, totally ludicrous. Yellowtail seemed too chewy and still partially frozen, whitefish tasteless. He did not eat either and I did just to be polite. I ordered a quail egg with salmon roe and something repeated for 24 hours with an oily fishy taste. I do not recommend this place, but it is not bad. Just not good, certainly not equaling the hype or price at all.

There's nothing like schlepping from the E train down 16th St (which I'm renaming Construction Row) to be welcomed into a warm and trendy restaurant chock full of...tourists? ?It must be Restaurant Week, or maybe it's the Iron Chef thing. ?But it was a little weird to see so many flashes going off during my lunch (at first, I honestly thought it was part of the Meatpacking chic decor, but alas, the photographers were usually sporting thick neck straps and jeans). The service was very attentive and very patient with explaining anything you might need to know about on the menu. ?I will warn you, though, that Morimoto isn't doing the typical Restaurant Week menu. ?Instead of 3 courses, you get one entree and a small bowl of miso and a salad as your other two courses. ?No dessert! ?The thing that makes this a little worse is that the bento boxes include the same miso and many more sides and cost the same or a little less. But the food was generally quite good. ?I ordered the angry chicken, which had a wonderful balance of spices. ?The chicken was cooked nicely and was very moist. ?I liked the crispy noodles, but could've handled a side of something more substantial. ?The tuna pizza appetizer is stellar--please order it! ?My friend's kobe beef bento box was also very good, and I wish I would have ordered that. The only disappointment was the sushi. ?I found it to be a bit dry and no where near as good as my local sushi joint. ?I also don't prefer the sushi to come with wasabe already on it--but that's just a me thing:).

I went to Morimoto for lunch with Joolie, Maritess and Steven during restaurant week. I was quite excited to go, but it was a bit of a let down. First the venue is gorgeous (check out the staircase and the bar downstairs!), and the service was excellent (maybe a bit overbearing at times?). But I expected to be wowed by the food, and it didn't happen. The prix fixe menu for restaurant week included one entree among three (sushi selection, braised black cod, and "angry chicken"), and came with a salad and miso soup. We got all three to share: - The sushi was very good, but not otherworldly as I expected. - The cod was definitely the better of the three dishes. It was very tasty (great sauce), but also really tiny. A side of rice or vegetables (even small) would have been great (it came with, literally, four Japanese black beans... and I really mean four). - The chicken was tasty but, again, not extraordinary. It came in a spicy curry(?) sauce and with crispy noodles. Good but not worth the price. I'm sure other items on the menu would have been more impressive, but given the high prices I won't be going back any time soon. My cocktail (called hydrangea) was great. Oh, and for a good laugh, don't forget to check out the bathroom, where they have these heated Japanese toilets with electronic panels, jets ("front clean" and "rear clean"), air drying etc... quite entertaining.

This place is worth the visit if you love sashimi and more adventurous sushi! ?The hydrangea drink is really delicate and very incredible on the palate -- highly recommend it. ?The cordiality of the hosts coupled with the excellent ambiance made for great group dynamics. ?I think it's a great date spot as well, because there are loads of two top tables. ?The white fish carpaccio appetizer melts in your mouth... very memorable. ?Unlike other meatpacking joints, the restaurant starts dying a slow death after 10:30PM. ?The crowd was more of a 30+ sampling, so youngn's may wanna go elsewhere for a more wild-n-sexy vibe. ? One star off, because the bartender downstairs is unnecessarily rude. ?Hey, at $14 per cocktail... this guy should have a "service with smile" plastered on his smug mug.

Well it was a wonderful experience. ?The place is gorgeous as you would expect from a NYC restaurant by a celebrity Iron Chef. ?The staff is gorgeous and super friendly. ?The food was really really great, though I guess a decade plus of dreaming of Iron Chef Morimoto's cuisine maybe set the bar a little high for me. ?The apps, we had - the Lobster fritters and the rock shrimp tempura (w/3 sauces) were great. ?The lobster fritters were unique and a first. ?The rock shrimp in the garlic aioli was more unique than the red sauce, which I've had a numerous places in L.A. before. ?The third dipping sauce was to cool down the red sauce, though it was not the least bit spicy, so...? The lobster fritters were 5 (how do they arrive at these numbers since people usually come in as 2, 3, or 4 people - so you can't evenly distribute) balls of a waffle mix with ginger and lobster. ?Truly good. ?Then we had the angry chicken - which was delicious but very Indian in flavoring - not Japanese at all. ?It's basically chicken and jalapenos in a curry sauce. ?The other main dishes we had were the Morimoto Ramen - which had a fantastic delicate chicken broth. ?The noodles were good, but so thin you HAD to use a fork and not chopsticks to get them out of the bowl. ?Trust me, we're experts with chopsticks. ?And finally the roasted whole lobster in masala seasoning with a lemon fraiche dip. ?It was good, but unfortunately the lobster was a tad undercooked. ?The kind of rookie mistake you expect in Hell's Kitchen, not Morimoto's kitchen. ?Not at these extravagant prices. ?Still, it was an experience, and even my son loved the soup in the Ramen. ?Which is saying a lot - as he'd rather eat Goldfish crackers than a Peter Luger's steak. If you are a fan of Morimoto's you know you have to go at least once. ?The menu could be a little more expansive for non sushi eaters. ?I think the place does cater to sushi eaters, while most of his cooking on the Iron Chef show was more fusion cooked Japanese dishes. ?I would like to experience more of that. ?But all in all, I had a very memorable, fun time. ?If you are going to take a Japanese girl out for a first date and want to get laid, this is probably a sure thing. ;-p

I must admit up-front this review is only based on a couple of drinks that we had at Morimoto but I do want to return for a meal. ?The space that Tadao Ando has designed is industrial and filled with light. ?The restaurant is minimalist with an airy feel. Definitely check out the bathrooms as they are gorgeous! The bar is a clear plastic with leaves embedded in them that gives a real depth to the the surface. We would have stayed if our vodka-sodas didn't cost $16/glass. All the dishes that were swept by us not only looked great made me salivate even though I had just finished dinner. I'm definitely looking forward to my return for food. I gave it 4-stars because the Iron Chef himself was at the top of the stairs when we were leaving. He thanked us for visiting. It was a great way to start off the night.

The Chefs sushi selection was excellent-- everything you would expect from a restaurant of this caliber. ?I was later told we missed out by ?not trying some of the chefs specialties like the carpaccio and the tempura, but after such a perfect dinner, I'm not the least bit disappointed in our choices. ?

Yelpers, meet my new bestie Morimoto. ?Morimoto...yelpers. Wow! ?We took an impromptu trip to Morimoto last Thursday after an exhaustive house hunting trip. ?We managed to score a last minute 6:45 reservation. ? As the cab dropped us off by Chelsea Market, it didn't take us long to figure out where Morimoto was, as its fairly distinct. The entrance is cloaked by a veil of red curtains that you need to maneuver to get into the restaurant. ? We checked in and were seated right away. ?Since opentable announced that it was "dressy", both hubby and I were dressed to the nines. ?However, we were a little put off by the folks in the sweats and t shirts sitting next to us. ?We sat in a very ideal spot that had a great view of the kitchen as well as the layout of the dining room. ?I have to tell you, the interior is absolutely breathtaking. ?Cool, chic, serene, white and very zen. As soon as we sat down, we were instantly greeted by the attentive, though not intrusive waiters. ?I absolutely loved ours. ?They were extremely friendly -- one bore some sick ass tats that he showed us. ?Very cool. Anyhoo...down to the food. ?We decided to go with 1 cold and 1 hot app, and the rest in sushi. ?We started with the wagyu beef carpaccio ...it was a step above religious experience. ?Holy Shiznit...it was good! ?I wish it had been served on a mobius strip of a plate. ?It was ridiculous. ?The second app were the lobster fritters..which were not only generous in size, but beautifully presented. ? Our sushi order consisted of the usual suspects, tamago, spicy tuna, spicy yellowtail, eel avocado, and soft shell crab. ?Delicious all around. ?The standout of the platter was the spicy tuna. ?It wasn't the typical tuna tartar that normally makes up a roll, but rather larger pieces of it enclosed in rice and seawood. ?Gorgeous! For desserts, I ordered the chocolate mousse -- outstanding! ?Hubby had the chocolate cake with corn ice cream and caramel popcorn. ?Delightful! After dinner, we headed downstairs for some drinks. ?The lounge is sexy and gorgeous. ?They also serve the same sushi and appz as the main dining room, so go there if you're in a pinch! Now...the best part of our entire experience.....ready? ?Drum roll please. The toilets...yes, the sick ass awe inspiring toilets. ?I was startled by how beautiful the stalls were for one, but then my tush was greeted with warmth as I sat down. ?As I looked over, it had "options" for cleaning different zones -- use your imagination. ?It was so fabulous that I had to sneak in with my SLR and capture the pictures...it was that cool. A+ all the way!

Morimoto.. I've probably gone here half a dozen times. Here are some oldies but goodies: - Toro tartare - Beef carpaccio (yuuuuummmmmmmmmm!) - Oysters / oyster foie gras - Toban yaki (a must have!!!) -Morimoto sashimi - Morimoto iced tea Decor is happening, very trendy. The bathrooms are fun but a bitch to walk down the steps in heels and after a few drinks... Tables are spaced too close together, and if you're seated at a table with chairs that can move, good luck moving those suckers! Those chairs weigh nearly a ton! Service is not shabby, but they don't make you feel as special as say.. Del Posto right across the street.

Yes it was expensive, and it was worth it. The service was fantastic, the restaurant was beautiful (def check out the bathroom!), and the food.. wow. The husband got the morimoto hazelnut beer, and I had the white lilly (MMM!). For apps, the morimoto sashimi was one of the most delicious things I've ever had. Not a fan of the sauces in the pipes, it was great by itself. The duck duck duck entree was great, but extremely rich. Note that the "fois gras croissant" didn't actually have fois gras, but actually duck breast. The husband's braised cod was yummy. Will be back for the omakase next time!!

I adore Morimoto. I grew up watching him on Iron Chef and always admired his creativity. I've been wanting to go for at least RW but I could never make it since they only offered it for lunch. So, my bf and I went to Morimoto to celebrate our three year anniversary. The dinner was everything I've expected (except for the rain.........and Morimoto not being present during our visit). I did wish however that we were seated on the main floor but we had an intimate dinner with the view of the restaurant. ?The first floor had a clean and sparkly atmosphere while the basement had more of a up beat/nightlight feeling. The bathroom was absolutely beautiful - very Zen like, I could stay there forever. Started off with a lychee martini - I forgot the name. I was a little upset that it was nothing special but a friend already had warned me so shame on me. We thought about ordering the omakase for $120 but we REALLY wanted to try the Morimoto sashimi... So here's a list of what we ordered: Morimoto sashimi - Bite size sashimi pieces.. Don't get me wrong, it was good but I can't remember the sauces. I liked the presentation over the actual dish. Toro tartar - I wish I had this for myself. I never thought toro went well with crème fraiche! My favorite was the nori paste with the fresh wasabi. Chef's combination $75 - awesome minus the shrimp tempura roll that I didn't care for...sad face Sea bass - WOW, the fish was so flaky and the tempura avocado was to die for. My favorite dish of the night! I devoured it like a mad woman Flourless chocolate cake with caramel popcorn - hm, not sure if this was executed correctly. There's a lot of stuff going on. I definitely would like to try his hot appetizers and main courses especially the Duck, Duck, Duck. The sushi was good but I feel like it's not worth it unless Morimoto makes it himself. If you haven't been here yet.. What are you waiting for?

Friends will not be surprised to know that I haven't seen a single episode of Iron Chef, but my boyfriend was reasonably excited by the prospects of eating at Chef Morimoto's restaurant, which must mean, he is a good Iron Chef, or whatever. Anyway, the Nobu connection had me sold. As I do when I am at Kai (which feeds along the same Nobu umbilical cord), I ordered mostly sushi. The avocado-cucumber one tasted marvellously better than it would at any Jap dig, owing perhaps to the interior design and lighting. The shiso one with plum sauce was great as well, and tasted faintly of cumin. I'm not lying! I had this tofu dish where they let the soy liquid coagulate like taho, to eat with a veganized sauce made with mushroom (supposed to be lobster). They made a mistake at first, but our server was too pretty to reprimand sternly. Rob had the tasting menu, which I can't really describe in detail. But he was delighted. The opener was some kind of beautiful mashed up raw fish with a plethora of condiments artfully arranged. Worth mentioning was that one of them things on the side were little rice cracker pellets that resembled fish food but tasted snacky and great. Intriguing! As I awaited my boyfriend (who had gone to the restroom) to ask his permission to eat the fruit on the shaved ice, the waiter engaged me in a conversation about it and later came back with one more just for me. I saved the seeds. I hope to grow them. Please pray for me. Halfway within his menu, my boyfriend posited the theory that restaurants serve you all these things that gas your stomach up, so that halfway done you're fooled into thinking that you're full-- but how can you possibly be with all such tiny servings? He is on to something. In all it was wonderful, especially my boyfriend's dessert, which was some kind of bean cake with apricot compote and sorbet, and green tea drizzles. Damn that was wonderful. The bathrooms are quite exceptional to the point of being absurd. It seems like being in a Japanese Alice in Wonderland sideward-falling mirror-hole with a cherry tree to console you of your vertigo. In all it has a beautiful effect. And so when you enter the cubicle (it seems hardly even right to call it that), the toilet seat opens on its own like a flower blooming in a Discovery Channel fast-forward sequence. And as you sit, unreasonably trusting, as always, the hygiene of pricey restaurants, and your soul will chuckle as you realize that the toilet seat is heated. Long live Japan and its vibrant patent office! The bill was pricey, but hey, you only live once. I would do it again. We were both satisfied and we thus both recommend you go. Try to sit by the sushi bar to watch them put things together. You can ask them things (for instance, one of the chefs says he eats at Babbo during his off days, obviously trying to keep Iron Chef ratings up), and they're pretty funny.

I was visiting NYC for one week and decided to try some new restaurants. Morimoto was one of them and I was quite happy with the choice. I started with the house salad which was a pretty standard dish, nothing to rave or complain about. The entree, sea bass, was the one that blew me away. The fish was perfectly cooked, very tender and well seasoned. ?The portion was just right. I hate it when restaurants give you tapa sized dishes as an entree. I was very satisfied with the sea bass that I'd say it was indeed the best sea bass I'd ever had in a Japanese restaurant. For the dessert I had some fruity sorbet. It was refreshing and decent. I took off one star because they charged me $8 for hot green tea, which was usually free in Japanese restaurants. The waiter asked me what I'd like to drink when I settled down at my table. I said hot green tea like I always did in Japanese restaurants. He didn't mention a word about the price. I assumed it was free and IT WASN'T. It was a pricy $8 cup of tea!! Despite that stupid tea, my experience at Morimoto was quite delightful. 4 stars!

This is the first fine dining experience I've had at a Japanese restaurant in NYC. Usually I am accustomed to the usually cheap and fast service of Japanese joints around the Saint Marks Areas, so I decided to try out the higher end of the spectrum of Japanese cuisine. No better a time than Restaurant Week! I brought a date and made reservations for lunch at Morimoto's, located in the Meatpacking District near the Chelsea Market (also a good place to take your date to walk around afterwards.) They let people in at 12 noon at the dot, and check your reservation and seat you to a table. The place by far is probably one of the best decorated and beautiful restaurants I have seen in NYC. So, this is a great place to take a date to for a good first impression. The service was top notch and always catered to your needs. But, lets move on the food! Other the than pre-fixed restaurant menu, I ordered the signature appetizer that Morimoto's is famous for, the Toro Taretare. They take the best and fattiest part of the tuna and ground it up and you can dip in various arrangement of sauces, while served on a nicely decorated bowl of ice. If one thing Morimoto does well, it is their presentation. For $28, you definitely get goddamn high quality tuna and this dish is it! It is a must if you want to get the full experience from this place. Next to the entrees. Me and my date had bento boxes, one Wagyu beef and Braised Black Cod. The Bento boxes come with a nice arugula salad , miso soup, vegetable tempura w/ a nice mayo-based sauce, Sushi/ sashimi platter, and a small portion of the ordered entree. It was a nice variety of Japanese dishes in a box, for the affordable price of $25 since its Restaurant week. I must say the sushi definitely stuck out the most of the box, and the wagyu beef was very juicy especially with the provided sauce. The cod was also very juicy and crisp, and so soft that you can cut it with a spoon. Overall, this was an amazing fine dining experience for me and my date. For dessert, we had a nice fresh fruit panna cotta, which was the cherry on top essentially for the meal. The bill came out to be about $95 including tax and tip, which is not bad considering how much it would be on a regular day. Morimoto, you get a perfect score!!

We sat by the sushi bar/kitchen - great location to see what's going in the restaurant. Hamachi tartare is phenomenal - not just the prep but the presentation was seriously the coolest thing I have ever seen in my life! The tartare was pressed into a board and you got this little silver shovel to scoop it out and there was a another board with 5 different garnishes. This was all set in a giant bowl filled with shaved ice and bamboo leaves. The crispy rock shrimp app was the perfect balance to the cold tartare - the dipping sauces were great. Duck, duck, duck entree was a wonderful trio of flavors and textures. Surf and turf prepped tableside was really cool - kobe beef and hamachi "ribbons" - perfect delicate flavors. I would love to have the omakase when I return - my mother said it was amazing!

Coming to a (primarily) Japanese restaurant, raw fish is GOING to be on the menu. There is no denying this. Though it may be wonderful for the majority of people in this world...it is definitely awful for those allergic to raw fish. *RAISES HAND* With my epi pen in my bag, I got the omakase with specific instructions that ALL FISH MUST BE COOKED...or else find my epi pen in the inner zipped pocket of my bag and inject into my inner thigh please. The presentation was simply ahh-mazing. Every detail of each item placed on the dish was done with such delicacy and art. Taste wise - I was envious of my bf chomping down on the raw version of whatever I was eating but nonetheless, most everything was quite up to par (minus the surf and turf portion which I wasn't too impressed with). Decor wise: Chic. Modern. Serene. Note to my future hubby - please design my bathroom like the one in Morimoto. I didn't care much for the seating either...the tables were MUCH too close together and arranged in a way where I felt like I should just stand up and say, "hey everyone, look at me!" (We were seated to the left hand side as soon as you walked in). Our server must have overheard my bf saying something about my birthday (which wasn't for another couple months) because when I looked up, there was a candle and special birthday dessert placed in front of me. Side note - I hate causing attention in restaurants! I quickly blew out the candle and glared at my bf because of the attention it brought. Overall, I experienced it once...probably won't go back but I'm glad I had the chance to try it!

Besides the ugly and awkward red curtain entrance, the decor was very pretty. Service was great as expected (although the waiter forgot a spoon for the soup..minor though). Let's get to the food, the eel avocado roll was delish, one of the best I've had! Kobe Beef Box was MVP (the most value platter) - lame I know, my bf came up with that. But it was very very good as was the chicken. Food: 8.5 Decor: 9 Service: 7.5 *ratings out of 10

Shefu ni watashi no sanji - "My compliments to the chef" Morimoto, I bow down. I had a beautiful experience with creative, delicious food and exceptional service. The tuna tartare appetizer is everything people rave about and more. The toro was divine and the caviar added even more decadence. I enjoyed all of the accoutements with the toro: wasabi, creme fraiche, nori paste, chives,avocado and rice crackers. It was fun to play and discover surprising flavor combinations. The lobster fritters were more of a pancake consistency as delicate as the shellfish. I was pleased with my entire meal and can't wait to go back.

What a night we had at Morimoto. ?We couldn't find a decent parking lot, I wore new shoes (dumb, I know) and my feet were on fire and we started signs of food poisoning from something we ate the night before.. but it was my birthday, and we still went out. We arrived for a late Saturday night reservation (11pm) and were promptly seated. ?The restaurant had a good amount of people, but not packed by any means. ?The space was large, and the decor was modern, trendy and clean. We started off with the Rock Shrimp Tempura and champagne. The shrimp and sauces were tasty, but extremely greasy. Our server was great. ?She was very knowledgeable and friendly. I got the Seafood Tobanyaki and he got the Wagyu Strip steak. ?Both were good and flavorful, but unfortunately, we were both unable to finish our meals between the sweating, nausea and dizziness. We didn't manage to get dessert because our faces were turning gray and we needed to get home before we both fainted. Morimoto, sorry we didn't get to fully enjoy you, but I would like to return one day, because I did like what I tried.

Loved Morimoto. This place exceeded my expectations. I had been here for lunch during one of the Restaurant Week's and was sorely disappointed. The recent dinner I had totally made up for it. The wait staff was friendly and the decor was nice, although the communal tables were too tightly packed - getting in and out was a bit annoying. I had gotten the omakase, which, while pricey, was excellent. It's seven small dishes, but filling (to me anyway). The Morimoto iced tea was great - very citrusy and sweet, and very aromatic. The steamed oyster with foie gras and uni was one of the best dishes. I was a bit skeptical, as I don't usually like my oysters cooked, but it was delicious. The other was the surf and turf - lobster in a spicy seasoning and a piece of Wagyu beef. Both were perfectly cooked and tasted amazing - especially the Wagyu. Because I love lobster, I ate that one first (in case I got full and wasn't able to finish the dish). But then I had the Wagyu, and it just blew my mind. There was fluke in sesame oil (and other things), which were also good. As was the first dish, which was tuna tartar and accompanied by several sauces - wasabi, seaweed paste, rice balls, scallons, creme fresh, and a red miso paste. There was also a miso fondue and vege dip, which was good but not amazing. There was of course, the usual sushi pieces, which I can't remember, and a tofu cheesecake dessert.

Expected something wonderful, but everything was very "eh." I tasted the chicken, tempura, and the kobe beef. everything seemed too salty except for the miso soup which was lacking that rich miso flavor. My mother (completely Japanese) really didn't think the sushi and sashimi were that great either. (The food came out 5 minutes after we ordered, which was also a big no-no) Overpriced and way too much hype for somewhere that serves pretty mediocre food. I really think I can name 5 other Japanese places that are 1/2 the price with more flavor on the right things and less salt on the other. Meh.

Couldn't get a reservation in time at Nobu, so I opted for this with a group of friends and it turned out great! Starters: Rock Shrimp Tempura and Kumamoto Oysters Main: Surf and Turf I feel like it's the best option to get while dining at Masaharu Morimoto's. You get Kobe Ny strip and Maine lobster, both prepared excellent.

Does this place really need another review? Probably not, but I am going for it anyway. I've been here a few times and the last experience overfilled the greatness cup - and I just can't hold it in anymore. Came here with a date on a Saturday night at 9PM, with no reservations to see if we can get a table. We weren't really counting on it, because the place was packed, with people waiting outside. The very friendly hostess says 'No problem'! Awesome. They gave us no estimate but said it wouldn't be too long - and asked us to wait at the bar area, which is cool looking. We got martinis and my date promptly spilled the whole thing on the bar. The bartender was really nice about it and didn't look in the least bit annoyed. A bus boy appeared out of thin air and cleaned up the mess while another martini was being made. Just as this is happening ?guess who sits down right next to us? Taylor Hicks of American Idol fame. Granted, not exactly a celebrity but an entertaining sighting nonetheless. We were seated before we were half way through with our drinks - so about 15 minutes on a really busy night. We also managed to get an amazing table with a good amount of privacy. For some reason they weren't doing omakase, which confused us, but our waiter offered to put together a tasting menu promising us we will sample the best of the best. We went for it. Just as our first delicious course arrived we saw T.H. getting seated. Everyone gets equal treatment here- I really liked that! The food was amazing. Between the toro tartar with caviar, lobster, kobe beef and some of the freshest sashimi ever this was one of the best meals I've ever had!

I have only eaten sushi here so I cannot comment on the hot food. I had a terrine of Sake, Hamachi and Toro, which sounds very good, but the sections were too big. I was instructed to eat each section in one bite. Each section was a cube that was 1"x1"x1". That is just too big. The fish is amazingly fresh and of high quality. The sauces that came with it were unnecessary, but I am a minimalist when it comes to Sushi. All i want is fresh, a bit of soy and wasabi and I'm happy. The Nigiri sushi was awesome. Hamachi, Mirugai, and the rest of the all-stars. There is better sushi in the city, but it is Morimoto's. If you solo, eat at the downstairs bar. The bartender is cool and she will chat you up.

Big, glitzy, beautiful - and expensive. I haven't gone to Morimoto and had a bad time; I've also never gone and kept to any sort of dining budget. Presentation is perhaps the biggest difference between Morimoto and a host of other high-end Japanese restaurants. Toto Tartare pounded into a fine, solid sheet of Tuna with diners are given gelato picks to portion fish and caviar; Morimoto Sashimi is provided with five different "squeeze bottles" of sauce to garnish; Oysters are displayed on a heaping mountain of shaved ice; Tofu is literally "cooked" in front of you. Beyond aesthetics, however, I think that the food disappoints. Lamb Carpaccio is flavorless, Rock Shrimp Tempura doesn't impress in either of the two Morimoto interpretations ("Buffalo" has a General Tsao's Chicken type of flavor; "Wasabi" is unintentionally subtle), Sushi, an easy benchmark, doesn't measure up to the Yasudas, Garis, or even the Nobus of New York. That said - I don't think that Morimoto was conceived to truly be about food. It's more about spectacle - the "Iron Chef" so to speak of the Manhattan food scene. And in that regard it succeeds.

OVERALL RATING ?= 8 / 10 Overall FOOD = 9 What I ate: ? ? Toro Tartare = 9 ? ? Oysters w/ Uni and Foie Gras = 10 ? ? Ishi Yaki 'Buri Bop' = 8 What I drank: ? ? SAKE Sho Chiku Bai Morimoto = 9 ? ? BEER Brooklyn Lager = 7 ? ? ATMOSPHERE = 9 SERVICE = 8 ---COMMENTS--- Went w/wife. Toro tartare was delicious and interesting to eat, but not worth getting again. I've never paid so much for an appetizer ($28). ORDER THE OYSTERS; comes with three, good sized portions, very succulent. My wife and I were able to walk in and immediately seated in the lounge. Service depends on the waiter/waitress. Some were indifferent. A couple were very attentive and served well. APPEAL = ?7 Overpriced, but good food and dining experience. Enjoy! BATHROOM = 9 Morimoto, the bathroom is a work of art, but may I suggest a sign or something that indicates how to open the bathroom stall door. I stood there for a good minute trying to figure it out. The door blended in with the wall. I saw and felt around the opening lines and began pushing parts of the wall. I felt like I was trying to find a hidden switch to a secret passageway. Finally the guy behind me taking a leak in the urinal suggested I try sliding the wall in different directions. Open sesame. Just warning you cause what if the next guy was in an emergency?

Awesome atmosphere, nice and classy type of feel. We got out coats checked in and were directed to our seats. Waitress offer us to try the omakase if this was the first time in the restaurant as we will get a essence of morimoto's cuisine. It's a 7 course tasting menu so be prepared to wine and dine in for at least 3 hours. If you're thinking of choosing this, you have to have it for the whole table. $125 per person. Ended up pretty pricey as we also ordered the cocktails. Total of $345 plus tips. Our waitress was nice as the BF does not like raw food and she was able to make adjustments for the meals. 1st up was the tuna tar tar laid out on a wooden board. There were 6 sauces for you to dip your tuna into. I just mix the sauces together. Presentation was nice as the tuna was sitting on top of a bowl filled with ice. Substitution was the fried calamari. 2nd up was a special type of fish, forgot what it was called but it was delicious topped with some soy sauce. 3rd up was the Fondue, wasn't that awesome. Sauce was on top of a candle to make sure that it was hot enough for us to dip into. It was too salty. 4th up was the oyster. It was delicious. It tasted like heaven to me. Fat enough that it melts inside your mouth. That is when you know it's fresh. 5th up was the sushi. ok. 6th up was the lobster tail and a slice of steak with curry sauce on top. Tasted kind of weird. As normally i will not put curry together with lobster. 7th was the Dessert. Mango pudding with green tea ice cream. Tasted so fresh, must try. The waitress was very accommodating, service was nice. Bathroom was very high tech. Overall a good experience and had a very wonderful night. =)

I was excited to visit Morimoto in NY having become a big fan of the famous Iron Chef. ?Walking toward the restaurant and seeing the traditional Japanese cloth cover done in it's own modern orange take, I knew that this was going to be my type of restaurant. The interior is ultra-modern with concrete, a downstair bar and a wall of clear bottles in the middle of the dining room that lit up the room. ?I had the omakase menu and was treated to dishes that I had not had before. ?My favorite were the tuna belly with side dips in a very attractive mini box, a mushroom and fish salad, the steamed oyster, foie gras and uni dish took rich foods to another level. ?The sushi and duck, duck, duck were average to me as I've had much better sushi at other restaurants and the duck dish was prepared in a Chinese style that was all too common me. Service was good not great and the restaurant was very loud, a perfect place for people watching, drinking and overall great time. Chef Morimoto came out several times to meet and greet with diners.

The food was outstanding. ?The service was a bit overemphatic with her use of adjectives like "savory," " lush," and "slick" when describing the food. ?The fact that we were sat 55 minutes after our reservation was just inexcusable. ? That said, the manager made up for it with many starters for the table...and like I said, the food was great! ?Pretty much everything I had, it was all delicious.

YUM! I took my husband here for his birthday, he'd been wanting to go for a while, and I decided this would be a nice treat. ?Japanese food not being at the top of the list for the types of food I'm interested in, I wasn't quite sure what to expect out of it all. ?Don't get me wrong, I like Japanese food..I just never planned on spending $350 on it, but it ended up being well worth it. The service was great. ?Our server paid close attention and was able to pair some wine and beer with our meal, which was a bit of a bonus. ? The decor is awesome. ?Everything looks, new, and white, modern, and sleek. ?The architectural details and interior design hit big in my book. Before the food, let's talk about the bathrooms. ?NeoRest toilets in every stall!! ?Lovely! ?Even if you don't feel that you need to take a visit to the restrooms while enjoying your wonderful dining experience, go anway. ?This toilet can do anything, and it's worth tgiving it a whirl. ?The decor in the bathroom isn't bad to see either. ?Very pretty for the ladies room. ?Don't worry boys, they have the NeoRest in the Men's Room too for you guys to check out. Okay, now for the food. ?Everything was good. ?Lamb carpaccio and Tuna Pizza for the app's were both great. ?The salad with the Red Snapper jerky was awesome, and the Seafood in Miso Broth was to die for! ?I could drink that broth every day and be happy. ?The hubby split the app's with me, and had the same salad, but he got the sushi for dinner. ?He was in love, and from what I tried from his dish was terrific. ?Some of the freshest sushi I've ever had. ? One thing that the both of us didn't really care for was the dessert. ?All of the components in the dessert were good, but then there was a scoop of Tobacco ice cream....not so great. ?Unfortunately, this was not a great note to end dinner on, and normally this would make me knock it down one star....but I thought that wouldn't be fair, since everything else made up for it and was so outstanding. I will definitely go back to this fantastic restaurant, and definitely spend a ton of $$ when I go, but I will make sure to stay away from that damn Tobacco ice cream.

Most Creative, Interesting Japanese food anywhere! I went last year around this time for my sister's birthday. I even loved the things that I normally won't eat! DRINKS: Morimoto's Sake was delicious. APPS: Wagyu Beef Carpacio is one of those dishes I wouldn't normally have (raw beef... I eat my steaks well done!), but this was so amazing it melted in your mouth! Curry Bread was a comfort food that I wish I could have every day (although I am sure not even close to as good as this) Spicy King Crab Leg was just enough spice that the crab shines ENTREE 1: Wagyu Beef was incredibly tender and had a great flavor - Yellowtail salad w Avocado & Tomatoes - Baby Potatoes ENTREE 2: Miso crusted sea bass w tempura vegetables was excellent! DESERT: Chocolate ganache w puffed rice, white sesame ice cream, black sesame sauce and powder... What to say about this. This was a perfect finishing touch to an already amazing dinner. I loved the black sesame powder and the rice also gave a great textural contrast. Morimoto's NYC restaurant we a wonderful experience. Although I still enjoyed his Philly restaurant a little more! (what is higher than 5 stars?)

AMAZING. modern cool decor with white drape tall ceiling, glass puzzle walls and modern furniture. ?feel like we were in the ice cave. Spicy key crab was out of this world and kumamoto oysters with foie gras was tasty as well. Beef capriccio was thinly sliced and well glazed. ?Calamari salad was OK dressing was a little too oily. ?Fat tuna, shrimp cake and other sashimi were very yummy. ?Desert drinks were crazy strong! Definitely have to try the white lilly, awesome drink. Over all had a great time sitting at the sushi bar with my best friend, flirting with the sushi chef, who was very attentive LOL. It's fun to watch them squeeze those sushi! HAHA Will be back again.

BF took me here for my birthday last year, and we were both ready for some life changing Japanese food...since Morimoto IS the Iron Chef and all....but it wasn't the case. I don't know if it's because we are both Chinese and have been spoiled by 5000 years of Chinese history and its art of cooking, especially seafood, but this was really NOT THAT SPECIAL, although a very amusing experience. ? In short, the bathrooms were the only thing that semi-impressed me! Sure, the presentation is modern and creative, but the food was just food. ?I could get the Tore Tar Tar anywhere, it was just Tuna Tar Tar in disguise, except now you have little sticks to eat with lol and it costs 3 times as much. ?The huge crab legs were good, but nothing special. My mother's food is way better~ The menu, to my amusement, featured Peking Duck and other dishes "in disguise"...I was angry they had that on the menu! ?Ok I wasn't angry, but the entire time I would read something on the menu with a interesting name, and when the dish came I would have to hold my laughter back. ? I ordered the Lobster, which may wow a few Western Palettes because of the "unique" seasoning, but to any Chinese person this seasoning is the cheapest most common seasoning ever found on shiskabobs! ?It was basically a stir fried lobster with massive amount of seasoning on it. The seasoning is very strong and should be used sparingly as every Chinese knows...but it seemed someone just dumped the whole bottle in!! ?what the heck??? ?My nose and mouth felt violated. ?I am a lobster lover, and have never turned down lobster... but it was so overwhelming ?I could not finish it... HOWEVER, it was not all bad. ?My bf ordered the steak and it was VERY VERY GOOD! ?Even since I moved to the states at age 6, my dad told me there was steak that melts in your mouth. ?I've been searching ever since, and this has been the closest to finding it so far. ?It was perfectly cooked, the beef was the highest grade kobe beef, and I could not stop raving about it. ?This was the only thing that made our trip into NYC worth it, and the only thing that will bring us back. Although the majority of the dishes on the menu are just average, and just slight modifications of foods you can get anywhere else with many Chinese influences, "what you don't know can't hurt right?" ? Unless you are talking about your wallet, since our dinner (2 entrees, 3 appetizers) for 2 cost about $350 before tax and tips!

This place became one of my favorite restaurants. Everything was so amazing. For appetizer, we had the toro tartare, the rock shrimp, and the sashimi. I especially loved the sashimi and how it was presented with five different sauces. For entree, I ordered the surf and turf and my girlfriend ordered the duckduckduck. I didn't expect the portions to be so big and we were so full that we didn't have any room for dessert. We just drank this mango rose tea or whatever. The service was very attentive as our waitress always came by and asked us if we want our tea pot to be refilled. Amazing food and attentive service. $200 dinner, completely worth it.

I was hoping to be wowwed by this place, but I was not . The food was good, but if I lived in NYC this is place I would go to once. Started out with the scallops appetizer was good nothing amazing, and the famous ramen soup. I asked the waiter if it had white meat only, and he said yes, So came was dark meat pieces. In a place like this you should know the food !!! Soup was good homemade broth huge but plain . Came with ramen noodles $15. For my entree I was recommend the black cod this was very good. I would recommend this to whoever is eating here. Also the Chinese broccoli but had a bit to much garlic and just was very average. Dessert we got the apple bread pudding it was OK nothing special at all. Worth a try but I wish maybe on my visit I wold have went to a more mine blowing place then this one. Not the experience I was hoping for.

We showed up on time for our reservation and saw that Chef Morimoto was in the front greeting guests. ?I asked him to take a photo with us and he gladly did. ?He was so nice, he gave us a small appetizer with the message, "compliments from the chef." ? We ordered Calamari Salad, Yose Dofu, some type of appetizer dish with 4 different appetizers, Whole Roasted Lobster, Duck and Braised Black Cod. ?For dessert, we had chocolate cake with popcorn and a blood orange noodle/sorbet :) ?If I had to pick a favorite, it would be the duck, but everything was very very good. I ljust oved the food, the experience and most of all meeting Chef Morimoto. ?Completely worth the price tag!

The food's very well presented. ?The most memorable dish was the toro tartare. ?I highly recommend it to everyone.

When we first walked into this restaurant, the classy, elegant, modern interior got me thinking if the food was as great as the architecture. And it was better! Let alone the accommodating service. The notable dishes were the oyster foie gras, kakuni (pork congee), duck duck duck, and sea bass (omg!). The sesame hazelnut layer cake and tofu 'hot & cold' were pretty interesting. One time the waiter forgot to put in some of our orders and he told us that those were on the house. We were all like "Yay!"

If it were not for the price, I'd give this place a 4.5 star at the least. In my opinion, I just can't imagine the food worth $800+ for the one meal I had here... I went with a friend after a business conference about 1 month ago, my friend had to make a reservation way in advance for 2 for their famous "omakase". -- setting: ?urban chic NYC style, a bit loud because of the crowds but not too bad since we were seated at the "special" omakase section. -- interesting notes: ?do check out their bathroom, very unique in the usage of mirrors to create infinite space appearance in each stall. Plus the Toto style Japanese toilet seats.... ?The bathrooms are located on the lower floor where the bar is, can be a bit hard to find. -- for regular omakase: $150 each, my friend decided to get the $300 version and wine pairing (I don't drink though). ?The dinner took over 4 hours and cost over $800.. Oh, boy, where do I even start ... -- (I have to go now, will update later.. ?TBWritten ? =)

Foodies galore! This is everything you would expect from an Iron Chef and more. First off, make your reservation in advance to secure a good table. You might get stuck sitting downstairs next to the noisy bar. ? The food was nothing short of amazing. I split the toro tartar, and I orderd the surf and turf. My boyfriend ordered the black cod. The sensation that swept over us when we had our first bite was comical. Let's just say it's explosions of flavor. We loved it.

There's a reason why Chef Morimoto is so celebrated. His unique presentation and dishes is tasting heaven in every savoring bite. A group of 8 of us dined here on a warm NY Saturday night. ?We had reservations for 930pm but didn't get seated till close to 10. ?It was no biggie, we enjoyed the bartender and its drinks. ?The bar area is very cool. Cocktails, all are very good. ?Some are fruity and sweet but those that love a bold taste should try the Morimartini. ?It is wasabi infused vodka, with junmai sake and cucumber. ?Very tasty and if you have more than one, you could end up on the floor. ? Shiso-leaf is made with gin and its so refreshing, its similar to a mojito but with gin. The hydrangea is very sweet and a sweet pink color. The orange blossom was good but lacked taste. Finally, the meal. ?Our group decided to do a family style meal, ordering 3 or 4 apps and 4 or 5 main dishes. ?Our server, Deliah rocked! ?She was soo cool and on top of her game. ? Service here is impeccable and they cleared our dishes and refreshed our drinks just when we needed it. Deliah was great at explaining the menu to us and made sure we didn't order too much or too little food, she made suggestions for us and she wasn't trying to get a big tip. ?We ended up ordering the right amount of food since we had every intention of going dancing after and didn't want to have full bellies. The toro tartare. How interactive! So good as it melts in your mouth. Tuna pizza, a must! This was excellent and so fresh. We had some kind of lobster ravioli and that was divine. For main dishes, we had duck, duck, duck. ?Wow, this was one of my favorite meals, ?Love the fattiness and this too melts in your mouth with each taste. The egg adds to a nice dipping sauce for the croissant Ishi yaki bop is similar to bibimbap, its cooked table side and if you are lucky the guy is totally hot.. the yellowtail tuna is cooked right in the extremely hot stone bowl and compliments the rice with the spicy seaweed flavor excellently. The trout was soo flaky and awesome. We also ordered a sushi/sashimi combo plate and it was all so fresh and delicious. We got the surf and turf and it was good but the dish didn't really stand out as the other plates did. We were all full but we HAD to order dessert. ?We ordered the mascapone strawberry cheesecake which was Morimoto's interpretation. ?It was fabulous! The berries were fresh and the best cheesecake ever. ?We also order the hot and cold tofu which came with maple ice cream and soufflé. It was very good when mixed all the ingredients together. The décor is very elegant yet simple. ?We spent close to 700 and that included tip. ?But it was all worth it. ?I need to come here again and soon.

I have now been here multiple times and I definitely suggest going with smaller groups or for date night. Sexy spot, expect to pay through the nose but sure to impress. I did set-up a birthday dinner here for ~10 and the meal was perfect until the waiter forgot to bring out the pre-arranged cake. The pork gyoza, lobster fritters and steamed scallops are a must. Of course you also have to get either of the tartares. For those that want something other than sushi, the tajima wagyu NY strip is kind of unbelievable.

Morimoto soon became a favorite place to eat after my dining experience here. I had wanted to come here for a long time, and finally the occasion presented itself. Dinner consisted of: Beef Carpaccio Sea Bass 2 rolls Dessert 2 drinks The presentation was really thought out and the waitress was incredibly friendly and knowledgeable. The sea bass, oh the sea bass. MMM Everyone has said it and Ill say it again, the bathrooms are a must see!

Restaurant week experience so far so Worth everything amazing fells like you are in Japan eating High end Japanese food!!! The service during lunch time wasn't super fast but this type of place you really want to enjoy! The food looks just as good as it tastes (so is the price) , but is all about the experience. And this place definitely doesn't disappoint because Morimoto is incredible! Loved the gyoza and the bento box menu! The tuna roll tasted just like in Japan .. amazing! (And this comes from someone who is not that into Tuna) =0) Want to experience something delicious and cool.. go to Morimoto!

SO good! I went to this place on Valentine's Day a few years back and Iron Chef Morimoto was there greeting all of his guests as they arrived. ?My boyfriend and I did have to wait 20-30 minutes for our table despite our reservation, but I'll cut them some slack considering it was a "holiday." ? Cool, hip atmosphere in a fun location. ?I highly recommend the toro tartare to start. ?Cannot remember exactly what we ordered for our main dishe b/c it was some time ago, but I remember everything being fabulous and beautifully presented. Might consider saving this place for a special occasion b/c it will burn a hefty hole in your wallet.

Quality: 2/2 - Top notch ingredients, excellent preparation and technique Value: 0.5/2 - It's really expensive for what you get. Service: 1/1 - Waiters were knowledgeable, patient, and quick when serving Round-up/down - Down. It's expensive for what you get and I don't think I was amazed enough to come back. Putting Morimoto into the scheme of Japanese food (which I love) as well as everything else that I like, I wasn't impressed. I started my meal with the raw bar. The oysters were excellent and very clean. ?The lobster and crab were not raw (which is what I hoped), but rather perfectly steamed. Both of these were excellent. ?The sauces were also really good (love the spicy fish sauce). So far, a great $70 start to my meal. As other people have mentioned, the toro tartare = creative and amazing. ?The fish = fresh. ?The caviar = great saltiness and savoriness. The seaweed paste = awesomeness. Beef carpaccio = beefy. Really tasty and the... beefiness... of the wagyu comes out. I heard that the Duck duck duck was a creative savory entree so I ordered that. ?It's a play on Peking Duck (the duck croissant) and roast duck. ?Don't get me wrong, the duck is good, not overcooked, crispy skin. ?But it's not that much better than what you can get in Chinatown for a fraction of the cost (e.g., peking duck with red bean paste sauce, etc.). ?The wine reduction sauce was interesting update for this kind of dish, but didn't wow me. At the end of the night and $100+ lighter in my pocket, I asked myself the following questions: ?Was the meal good? ?Yes it was. ?Was it $100+ good? ?Not really. ?Would I go back? ?Definitely maybe... if someone else was footing the bill.

The most perfect martini can be had here. That alone would keep me coming back but the food is also fantastic. Service is excellent and the wait staff remembers regulars. Super fresh sushi and lovely decor. The walls and ceiling appear draped in fabric but it's actually cement. The back sushi bar and the downstairs bar are fantastic places to sit and people watch. If you get the omakase, bring your American Express Platinum and your eating pants. Not a cheap dinner out by any means. Try to leave room for dessert. They arrive like art on a plate. It's almost a shame to eat them.

I really like the decor of this restaurant. It was very open, modern, and clean. ?From the outside, you'd never expect it, as you can pass by and not even notice it is a restaurant. ? I did find the food to be kind of pricey, especially the sushi. ? At first we thought the sushi was priced for 2 pieces, but it was priced per each. ? Gasp to our surprise, but we ordered anyways. ? ?Though the services overall was good, our waiter could not really explain the dishes. I could give a better interpretation of them reading off the menu than he could. ? Though I did like the sushi we ordered, my entree of the surf & turf (Kobe beef and hamachi ribbons) was disappointing. Mainly, it was the Kobe beef, as I did not find to be fatty enough, to melt in my mouth. The hamachi ribbons was good though, mostly due to the avocado mixed into it. ? My friends dish of the seafood itoban yaki was excellent though. ?There was so much flavor in the broth, which accented the seafood. One cool note is the toilets, as they have the Japanese toilets. That alone to try out is worth the visit. ? If you haven't had a toilet that helps clean and dry your bottom, then you haven't lived yet.

Wonderful dining experience. ?Came here today for Restaurant week. ?Definitely worth it. ?I think every table around me was here for the same thing. Starters - salad and miso soup - mixed green salad with a light dressing; soup was great (not too salty) Entree choices - 9 pieces of sushi (chef selection) and a spicy tuna roll Black cod - miso glazed (signature seafood dish) Angry chicken - chicken marinated in a yogurt sauce (similar to tandoori chicken) Dessert - Petit fours My boyfriend and I had the sushi combo and the black cod. ?The sushi was probably the best value. ?The quality of the fish was above average, but I've had better. ?The cod however was absolutely wonderful! ?I'm glad that both of us didn't order the suchi combo. Morimoto is well known for his fusion style, so I think you get the most out that experience by trying cooked items. The desserts were good, but nothing special. Service was superb. ?Ambience - modern and simple. ?I didn't get to check out the bathrooms downstairs but the ones on the main floor were semi cool. ?The doors are sliding and there is a button to lock each door. I'm glad I was able to try this place without paying a lot of $$$. ?I'm 50/50 if I'd come back on a normal basis, but I'd recommend for people to check out this place at least once.

Have you ever eaten something that you can't stop thinking about? Food so sublime, it takes over your thoughts? Well, that is how good the black miso cod is here. Sweet, salty, savory and divine. We also had the rock shrimp tempura, lobster fritters and duck shabu shabu. Each dish was incredible, inventive and addicting. The atmosphere is nouveau chic, not something i was expecting but it was quite nice. Besides the loud douches we were sitting next to, I enjoyed everything about this meal. I heart Morimoto.

*Sigh. I was expecting too much. The decor didn't look as gorgeous as the pictures I'd seen. Don't get me wrong, it was still pretty trendy and immaculate. I was just disappointed cause of all the hype. Steer clear of the sushi. It's not bad (it's meh, decent) but it's definitely not worth the markup. Here are my stars: 1. The bidet. Go downstairs to the little girls' room and have a grand old time playing with every button. 2. Warm chocolate cake. I don't know what all the hoo-hah is about the tabasco and whiskey cause I couldn't taste either at all. Still...chocolate cake a la mode is always a good idea. And the popcorn didn't get in the way at all. 3. Tofu hot and cold. Try each tofu offering separately. Be unimpressed. Try all of them combined and prepare yourself for some serious oral stimulation.

Located literally next door to Chelsea Market in the meatpacking district. The front door is covered with red drapes. Once in the entrance, the interior looks like a ice castle, very modern and sleek. I was impressed. We had the bento box on the lunch menu and we were surprised that the quality of the food was excellent and the service was impeccable, the price was reasonable for the lunch menu. You need to check out the washroom, in the lower floor. the stalls have some kind of special-effect to them, it looks like the toilet is floating in a dark endless tunnel (Once you see it you know what I mean). I would definitely come back to Morimoto's.

Walking into Morimoto, I felt I wasn't in New York anymore and that I was transported into a whole new world. I loved loved loved the decor from the table placements, to the glass bottle "wall", to the ceilings; everything to me was gorgeous... My bf and I were both seated in a lovely section and were promptly seated for our reservations. I have read many reviews prior to dining and so badly wanted to try various items off the menu but the Omakase Tasting was screaming to be tried. Off we ordered and our experience began.... *Tuna Tartare *Fluke sashimi *Assorted Nigiri *Ack forgot the dish *Oyster something (I cannot eat oyster so I had a salmon ravioli) *Homemade Ginger-Ale *Lobster with Wagyu with Japanese yams *some type of chocolate dessert Overall, the meal and the pace was lovely. The couple next to us had one diner doing the tasting menu and the other ordered various items. The service was impeccable and my water was constantly being refilled. Be sure to check out the bathrooms, I noticed a few people just standing outside the door trying to get in! Hilarious! Yes, Morimoto IS expensive .. but I think for a splurge meal it was well worth it.

Cue the Japanese actress taste judge from the original Iron Chef. "Mmmmm...this is sooo goOod! heehee" I said the same thing during my dinner here, and the overall dining experience was fantastic. We got the toro tartare and the oysters with uni and foie gras to start off. ?The toro tartare was okay taste-wise...it was majorly enhanced by the novelty factor of diners being able to play with the food. Scrape, dip, garnish, eat, and repeat. ?Definitely get it if you haven't tried it. ?The oysters, on the other hand, were something I would order again and again and again. Who knew oysters, uni, and foie gras can all go together. ?My date considered getting another order since there were only 3 servings and he gave me the 3rd one. ?Extra points to him! (I think he saw me eyeing it .haha) For the main, we ordered the chef's combination sushi. ?There was fatty toro, medium fatty toro, salmon, hamachi, ikura, giant white clam, snapper, eel, shrimp, some type of silver fish, hamachi roll, shrimp tempura and asparagus roll, and tomago. Everything was so fresh tasting. ?The tomago tasted like pound cake. ?My favorite of the bunch was the fatty tuna. We ended the meal with the chocolate cake with green tea ice cream. ?I love green tea and chocolate combos so I had to get this. ?It was the perfect ending. We even finished up our whole bottle of nigori. Tipsy and full - just the way I like it.

This review is for RW Lunch only. I was saddened by my RW lunch experience yesterday since I am a fan of Masaharu Morimoto and his Philadelphia restaurant. The choices for RW lunch are bento boxes with Wagyu, Black Cod, or a Vegetarian option. ?With no other mention of what else is in these lunch boxes, one would expect the featured entree to be sizable. ?Wrong. ?They were tiny. I shared the Wagyu and Black Cod with a friend. ?The Wagyu was nothing exceptional. ?The Black Cod is comparable to what one can cook at home. ?As for the other items in the box, there was a salad with fried shallot flakes, tempura (with scallion and oyster mushroom), nigiri (maguro, hamachi, & salmon), and miso shiru. ?The sushi pieces were smallish, but were the best items in the box. I'm sure if one orders off the regular menu, the meal would be great. ?After this meal, I am not motivated to return. ?The waiter was trying to explain that since RW is now two weeks, two times a year, restaurants have had to scale back on their RW offerings since they lose a lot of money then. ?If that's the case, how come other restos like Maialino, Alto, The Modern, and Gramercy Tavern can get it right?

As soon as I arrived at Morimoto I knew I would have a good experience. ?The location is right next to the Chelsea market where the Food Network building is. The entrance is an automatic door but has japanese style curtains over it. As soon as you stop inside ?you see a wall in the middle of the restaurant attached with hundreds of plastic bottles over tiny light bulbs. ? My coworker and I went to Morimoto for lunch as part of restaurant week. ?The waitress took us to a table in one of the rooms to the side and suggested the tuna pizza as an appetizer. ?We said sure why not? I was a little skeptical at first but when it came out it looked and tasted amazing! It's a thin crust type of pizza with tuna sashimi layered on top and covered with tomatoes, olives, scallons and a mayo sauce. ?Light and tasty...I could have eaten a few of those by myself :) I chose the beef ?bento box as my main course. The bento box included a salad, miso soup, tempura vegetables, a few pieces of sushi and the marinated beef. Everything was good- the sushi was fresh and the beef was juicy and delicious. I liked the salad the least...the greens were a bit bitter for my taste. ? OMG the dessert...berries panna cotta. ?it came in a shot glass and had fresh raspberries and blueberries on top. It was light, creamy and simply orgasmic. Restaurant week lunch menu at morimoto was about $24 and the tuna pizza was $18. Pretty good value in my opinion. The restaurant was pretty busy so it took our waitress quite a bit of time before we were able to get our check but I'm going to overlook it for the great suggestion of the tuna pizza.

Apparently I eat here often, yet I've never written a review. Morimoto has become the go-to place for lunch/dinners at my office. I prefer lunch here as it's fairly quiet (except during Restaurant Week). Sometimes you can have the whole sushi bar to yourself. Here are the stars in my book. For appetizers, the pork shumai, the rock shrimp, and the king crab. For lunch, I am a fan of the eel/foie gras bop (especially on a wintery day). They also do a ramen that is pretty great. The chirashi is a great lunch as well. They do the regular sushi/sashimi offerings and always have seasonal options. Of course, there are popular rolls as well. The sushi is good, but I don't go out of my way for it. The space is pretty awesome and they have a bar downstairs that is often the perfect after work spot if you can get there on a non-busy night. Oh, their wine list is great. A number of Champagnes and sushi-friendly white wines. My big complaint? Those plastic chopsticks. Yes, they look cool, but only when they are new. Some are looking scuffed. The other issue with them is that since they are plastic, you don't have that nice grippy quality you get with wood. Picking up large slices of slippery sashimi with them can be tricky.

This is far and away my favorite Japanese restaurant. The food is always fresh. The dishes are unique and vibrant. The tuna pizza is amazing as is the rock shrimp tempura. They also have some very unique sashimi, like barracuda. The vibe is a lot of fun but very very young. The bathrooms are worth the trip downtown. Infinity mirrors in each stall, and toilets that basically do everything for you!

from the tv episode to the plate, i feel like i was among chairman kaga and the panel of judges on the set of ironchef... i can definitely see it now... chairman kaga biting into a big bell pepper and then coughing due to the intense kick. then move to the announcement of the secret ingredient - fresh seafood. camera pan to the chefs running to the mountain of seafood just waiting to be inspired. then cooking and prepping. the drama and the play-by-play commentary. the suspense and the mouthwatering. the plating. the serving. the explanation behind the art. and finally, the tasting. my favorite part. toro tartare. oyster foie gras. spicy king crab. sushi platter. cold sake. sapporo. let's go to the judging. taste - 8/10 presentation - 5/5 originality - 5/5 total - *18* wow. your dishes are a class of its own. expression of the ironchef at its finest. i finally got to taste what it's like to be on the show of ironchef and live that experience. not even JM could give me such euphoria. domo arigato, mr. ironchef murimoto. next time, i will try the perscribed murimoto omakase. however, appetizers were simply delish! the sushi was at par, nothing really to write home about. and as a sidenote, i, too, felt insulted when bobby flay stepped on the cooking counter after his battle with you :'( to answer the question, whose cuisine reigns supreme? yours, ironchef murimoto. yours.

It was Saturday 11/15/11, we walked in with no reservations at 7:30 PM, asking if they could accomodate 4 pp at 8:30. The reception staff was helpful, cordial, and accomodating. They figured out how to accomodate our request around the time we wanted to dine. The dinning experience was au pair. The food excellent. The service professional. The ambiance fantastic. The decor amazing (by Tadao Ando). This experience turned our NYC trip into a great memory!

**S.P.E.C.T.A.C.U.L.A.R.** Morimoto, the eponymous restaurant of the famous Iron Chef, is located in the same building as Chelsea Market. The interior has a super modern, but classy look. Cement pillars are offset with curvy peach curtains seeping out dim lighting. A glass bottle bottom wall surrounds the central staircase that leads down into the bar area. The bathrooms are downstairs. I made two trips down there. Once to wash my hands. The second because the birthday girl told me to check out the crazy looking loos and backwall. I admit, Morimoto has quite the bathroom. But, who cares about the bathroom if the food is not delectable. Never fear, Morimoto is the type of culinary experience where you can walk in with high expectations and still walk out amazed. Starter was toro tartare. It came in a little wooden box sitting in a bowl of ice and it's own scooping utensil - a type I've never seen before. The toro brought along two friends, a ponzu dipping and an another box full of flavor strips (wasabi, avocado etc). The server was kind enough to explain to us the a good way to enjoy the dish. Soft shell crab roll. This was a first for me. I'm not sure if I've had soft shell crab before, in roll form or otherwise. Crispy and soft at the same time. The crab was good. ?I ate it all. Halibut and Black Cod. Both were very good and very pleasing dishes. I like fish with rich flesh so the cod was the winner for me. Artistically presented and beautifully crafted, the halibut and cod were very tasty and filling in all the right spots. Thinking back on these two dishes, I realized one thing. I need to go buy Morimoto's cookbook.. I washed everything down with sparking sake. A word on the sparkling sake. What a shame. A shame that I've never even heard of sparkling sake before Morimoto. I've been missing out and if you have too, the sake is a must. Dessert. Earl Grey Creme Brulee. Does that rhymn? Was that on purpose or a happy coincidence? Good good good. The birthday twist. I had called the birthday dinner ahead, so the service brought out a special birthday dessert plate. A candle. A chocolate Happy Birthday. A red bean macaroon. A tofu cheesecake. A chocolate fruit tart. One very happy birthday girl. The smile said it all. We had a wonderful time at Morimoto. The food was super superb. Really a notch above the rest. The service is prompt, courteous, and informative. We wanted for nothing at Morimoto. review 1/20/2008 I.M.Y.

The company I work for gets a discount here, so when a colleague was visiting from the west coast, a bunch of us -- like eight people -- came here for lunch. They don't seem to do a brisk lunch business, but if you haven't been to Morimoto before, it might be a good introduction to the restaurant. We just got green tea and a sushi sampler for the table, and everything we got was good. I wasn't the biggest fan of the sea urchin, which I was dared to try, but outside of that, everything was fresh and tasty -- the urchin was just... weird. For dessert, I got a warm chocolate cake with popcorn ice cream and tobacco whipped cream. The cream is a novelty, as is the ice cream, but if you've ever tried chewing tobacco, you'll recognize the distinctive flavor and after taste (burn). If you haven't, you'll just find it odd. Solid sushi. We ate upstairs, and I understand they serve downstairs as well. Interesting!

Expensive but well worth it. Food, atmosphere & service is top notch. Omakase is a must. Chef Omae is amazing. If I had the funds, this would be my frequent sushi place, monthly maybe even weekly. This is my benchmark of excellence when eating Japanese cuisine.

Went here for my gf's birthday - but the food was only OK. Service fantastic as expected. The other diners next to us enjoying their meal. We read the reviews before coming and wanted to try some of the specialties, left feeling that it was overrated. On the whole we found the simpler dishes much better than the more inventive stuff. Tuna tartare - was very good. Foie gras oysters are covered in a sugary sauce... didn't live up to expectations. Shrimp tempura was an abomination - considered sending it back. Covered in ridiculously thick and sweet sauces, served with ranch dressing (?). It was honestly awful, wish it was just straight up tempura. Ramen - pretty solid, noodles were great. Yellowtail hotpot - the best thing we ate all night. Simple and a knockout. Presentation was fun, served raw, server places fish on sides of bowl, cooks before you, stirred and rearranged by server. Chef's combination sushi - very good. Flourless chocolate cake was amazing. It was a very good meal, with two dishes really missed the mark. Seems like you pay for the atmosphere, service and presentation, while the food sometimes lives up to the reputation.

Morimoto definitely doesn't disappoint its ephemeral 'new spot in the meatpacking district' title, with its multi-floored, spacious design. We took off our shoes and sat on the floor, which was a bit odd considering the layout; the tiny waitress towered above us when serving our food and drinks. Oh right, the food. Since it was our first time there, we decided to go with the Omakase - where you pay a set price, and the chef customizes a tasting menu to, well, his choice. We had the minimum, which was $200 each. Out of *pure* curiosity we asked about the 'maximum' - the chef told us there isn't a set maximum, although the highest he's seen during the few months they've been open was $1000 a person. I think that's insane, even by New York standards. I think we had 10 courses. I lost count. I just know that each course was amazing. A few stood out in my mind: 1. One plate was all sashimi - i've never had such fresh fish. What's more, you're given a wasabi root and a file so you can make your own wasabi. super cool. 2. rare mushroom soup - these mushrooms are shipped every few days from a part of Japan. it is cooked in this soup inside a small teapot; youo pour the soup into a cup to drink, and then eat the mushroom from the teapot. Overall - great experience. The waitress told me I was the first girl to finish all 10 courses. heck yea!

No trout ice-cream with eyeball, though. It's a bit over-pimped, if you ask me. They don't want you forgetting that you're eating in a fancy restaurant. Some nice Japanese touches in the bathroom. We didn't see the chef, but he's supposedly around 6 days a week. But I've never rated any restaurant on it's design or space. My rating is for the food. The ahi tuna pizza had the perfect flavor profile. The ingredients are ones you've had, but the combination is amazing. Kobe beef carpaccio was a little sweet, but still delicious. Kumamoto oysters topped with foie gras and sea urchin. Three strong flavors that I thought would clash, but I was wrong. Morimoto is right about all three. The sea bass was nice, but had a hard time following the other dishes since it's flavors were comparatively muted. Unexpected, but the dessert was almost the highlight. Pineapple bread pudding bore no resemblance to anything Japanese, but it was perfectly executed. "Tastes like Hawaii", my date said. This restaurant is a great example of Franco-Japonaise cuisine.

What a place. ?Luckily I went on someone else's dime, so perhaps my review is a bit skewed, but whatever. First the interior- its huge. ?There's a wall of Tynant Spring water bottles in the middle of the restaraunt by the stair case and its awesome. ?The walls to the outside are sort of see through, so you get a view of the orange drapes outside floating around in the wind and its really cool. ?Some of the tables are long, some more traditional. ?All very stylish. ?And do yourself a a favor and try out the bathroom. ?Strange thing to say i know- but its unique. The food- Some of this stuff is very interesting and very cool. ?Yellowtail Pastrami. ?Kobe beef cooked in boiling hot water in a clay pot at your table? ?Tuna pizza. ?Enjoyed all of these very much. ?Duck, Duck, Duck- a killer entree with duck served in 3 styles. ?The rock shrimp tempura is excellent. ?The only dissapointment? ?The sushi is pretty average fare.

We found ourselves completely by surprise at an engagement dinner at Morimoto with my brother and his other half. They had been there for New Years Eve and were raving about it. They were very right. Overall comments: Every dish was as much for the eyes as for the pallet. It became obvious that from the design of the restaurant to the flatware and the food, every part of this experience was very well considered. This was a meal to savor and enjoy with as many senses as you could invite. Ordering a few things and sharing is a great way to go and they won't discourage that. Appetizers: White Fish Carpaccio: The White Fish was arrayed toward the bottom of the plate and payed nicely with the warm oil. Toro Tartare: I had seen Chef Morimoto present a similar dish on television and was anxious to try this. You use a flat tool to work out a square of the tuna and then combine it with one of four flavors on a small side dish. The toro pairs beautifully with all accompaniments and each one brings out a different characteristic of the toro. Tuna Pizza: This was an "engagement gift" from our server. A crisp won ton shell covered in tuna with an anchovy aioli and what had to be the mildest jalapeno pepper I've ever tasted. The velvety tuna along with the smooth aioli were a nice textural juxtaposition to the won ton and the slight kick from the pepper was just enough of a spicy addition. Kakuni: Japanese Bacon make Japanese Homer very happy. This pork belly fell apart under the weight of your spoon and was served in a scallion congee that balanced the saltiness in the pork with more mild and airy flavors. House Smoked Salmon Ravioli: Leave it to Italians to get raviolis at Morimoto. These are wonderful raviolis, though. The sweetness in the yams and salmon is set off nicely by the fish roe and the yuzu gelee brings it all together nicely. Dinner: 12 oz. Waygu fillet: Served at a perfect medium rare, this cut fell apart nicely with only a little prodding from the knife and fork. It was beef after all. When beef is prepared this well, there isn't much to say but, yum. Braised black cod: Moist and flaky in a ginger soy reduction that set the served the fish well without overpowering it. Line caught halibut: The medium of the three fishes. The black bean sauce and ginger were perfect accents. Sea Bass: My personal favorite. This resilient fish yielded graciously to the prodding of my fork. It was served in a sweet sake sauce with Japanese eggplant, lightly fried. Of all the flavor/texture combinations from that night, this one has stayed with me most indelibly. It was the pinnacle of my night at Morimoto. The design of the restaurant is ingenious. The cocktails were delicious. The house staff was gracious. Our server was patient and insightful. The night was more than memorable. My fiancee and I agreed that this was one of the nicest gifts he's ever given us.

Passed by after eating at Buddakan. We walked in and were impressed with the layout, the crowd, the feel, and the bottles on the wall!! First read about it in DailyCandy (http://www.dailycandy.co…). We went downstairs and sat at the bar for drinks. Not very noisy and the talent is... very eye catching ;-) We plan to go back soon for dinner.

Very, very cool place on the inside. ?One of the best decors I have seen in Manhattan. ?Deceptively big - we were able to get a table with no reservation no problemo. We got there around 9:30 and they said it was too late to do the tasting menu (very curious) so we ordered some DELICIOUS sashimi for an appetizer and had some entrees. ? The sushi / sashimi was amazing but to be honest with you the main courses (we had fish dishes) were overdone and devoid of flavor. ?VERY curious considering all the amazing reviews it's gotten. Next time I go, I'm sticking to sushi and hopefully it'll redeem itself!

Nice space, cool decor, cool bathrooms, it's nice sitting at the sushi bar and watching the chefs... kitchen looks super clean... Toro tartar: Amazing presentation (see pic). Beautifully presented in an icebowl with cutesy condiments. It was however rather tasteless and have had tastier tartar at lower end places... Duck Duck Duck: I always find myself drawn to duck dishes for some reason and this looked very exciting with three types of it. This is a big plate I couldn't finish it. The croissant part of it tastes exactly like Chinese pork buns (example Momofuku ones) except the bread is croissant and it's duck instead of pork. The fois gras duck leg was delicious and the egg was good but not to-die-for. Wagyu beef carpaccio: Nice wagyu but overly drenched in ginger, salt, vinegar, and cilantro. Summer peach raspberry pudding: Served up in a cup like a tiramisu with cake part on the bottom (would rather have had it all pudding without the spongy stuff). The wine gelee and sorbet that comes with it is nice and refreshing. Cocktail list is short but sweet and the drinks have lovely names like white lily and hydrangea. ?One of the cocktails only appears on the dessert menu and has vanilla vodka with apricot and simple syrup and this is priced almost double of the other cocktails for some inexplicable reason... it wasn't as tasty as it sounded either... Service was flawless; the waitress knew every single dish down to the smallest ?detail, professionalism to the extreme. This is a nice space, some good dishes, great service but I wouldn't call it ethereal or top of the line. Probably good for corporate dinners as an alternative to boring steakhouses.

This place is dangerous. The food is killer, the service is killer, the drinks are killer , the decor is killer, and the female clientele is killer to look at. I tried the tasting menu, which was amazing. Out of the 7 plates they served, only one of them was bad (imo). The 6 were amazing, but that 7th plate it seems was sent to me from hell. Seared Foi Gras served over an oyster. I detest both. I stuck with K1 and tonics, but did venture at the end of the meal to try a flight of Morimoto sake. Pretty intense. Definitely a great place to try, even if you cant afford the $130 tasting menu every night.

Okay 5 stars. Setting: Surprise Dinner date with my GF. ?THe day was rainy as hell. ? I actually thought the dinner was going to be alot pricier with our order. ?We started off with the oyster thing and the Yellowtail tartare. ?Oyster was by far the best tasting thing I had there. ?The sauce was just amazing. ?The tartare was very good w/ a very beautiful presentation. ?(this place has amazing look and presentation in their food and atmosphere). ?I had the duck duck duck and my gf had black cod miso. ?THe duck was pretty damn delicious. ?It had 1 egg, a duck sandwich, and like a duck confit so it was mash of american french and asian..kinda. I love duck it it was possibly one of the best duck dishes I had. ?Well portioned and very very very tasty. ?Tghe fish was also amazing. ?Especially how it was cooked.. it was at it's best possible state. ? The sashimi I had there was also very very fresh and tasty and put differently (sorry totally forget what they were) THe staff were all nice and knowledgable. ?Waiter was great and knew everything on the menu inside and out. ? The drinks were alright tasty and pricey but had to drink something good to compliment my meal. ? Overall one of the best experiences I had at a restaurant. ?I would say the price is comparable to going to a nice steakhouse.. sorry with the combination of everything I had here beats out a good steak every day of the week and I love steak (i have no idea why im bringing this up...) P.S. THe dessert was also very good, highly recommend the macha cake (everything is sooo pretty bring a camera!!)

I'm mixed in my review for Morimoto. ?I have been here twice over the past year and a half, and both have been for Restaurant Week. ?The first trip was worthy of 4 stars and my most recent 2 stars. ?Therefore 3 it is. The menu for my first taste of Morimoto included a sushi assortment platter. ?It didn't specify which types of sushi, it was just all raw fish nigiri which was great. ? On my trip 2 days ago, the menu has degraded heavily, as it seems everything is not a true representation of everything Morimoto offers. ?I ordered the fishwich as my entree and it was literally a glorified fillet of fish. ?It really was. ?Even down to the slice of cheese which wasn't melted in anyway. ?I understand that restaurant week choices are quicker to prepare, but I felt like they truly ran away with my 24 dollars. For the appetizer I chose the oysters, and the only dessert is a panna cotta. ?Karen Y. ordered the crab croquettes and sashimi platter, and those were more better selections As always, the highlight of the trip were the bathrooms. ?Morimoto himself is quoted as saying the most important parts of a restaurant are the bathrooms. Do I recommend trying out Morimoto? ?Absolutely. ?But thanks to my latest trip I have a somewhat sour taste in my mouth.

one star for the sushi rice ? soft shell crab roll and shrimp tempura roll was very salty lobster balls tasted of salt only, why write ingredients on the menu if it only tastes of salt? ?Oh yeah by the way our table of six was so small downstairs, just forget about it... I actually ate the lobster appetizer an hour after i ordered iT IN MY LAP. no room on the table... but i wasnt charged for it,,, i'd rather go to st marks the clam miso soup...clams were old and stunk, and the soup tasted of re=constituted powder. people go out to eat good food, not this, not me, no way ive had equal sushi and meal at portland oregon happy hour, get real and start selling t-shirts like Guy Fieri, ?or at least your knives and cookbooks at the front, cause no one cares anymore.

I went. I ate. I paid. I left. This is the summary of my dinner at Morimoto. I cannot say I didn't like it because the food is very good there and the place is very nice if you want to impress someone. But paying so much for japanese food, I would not do it again. At least not there. There are so many other excellent japanese restaurants in the city (BondSt for exemple) that I would not repeat this one!

Why is this happening? ?Did someone up and change the definition of omakase while I was sitting on the fully-automatic, pimped-out, 100 degree-heated toilet? ?Last time I checked, omakase was something of an exchange between you and the chef, not you, the chef, and the 200 other people who are also sitting in the stadium-sized restaurant/arena. ?(Morimoto can't leave Kitchen Stadium behind, it appears) Morimoto, 3 stars for your fancy bathroom with the automatic door and hot toilet seat. ?If I had had just one more glass of sake, I would've never left. ? And for fantastic quality ingredients, though at 120 for your omakase, that should be table stakes. ?I'm keeping 1 star because you butchered uni, oyster, and foie by drenching them in a hideously cloying teriyaki sauce. ?I coulda had a V8. ?I'm keeping the other star because you pureed perfectly good negitoro, causing me to look around to see which posh 6 month old had had its food accidentally delivered to my table.

Loved it. Had the Omakase and each course was wonderful and more importantly, fun. I enjoyed the tartare where you eat with a little scraper thing and add your own toppings/sauces. The seared octopus was chewy little bites of heaven. One of the sushi pieces was kobe beef ?- tasted just like a perfectly grilled burger, even though it was raw. The angry lobster was indulgent. The green tea you mix yourself with one of those Japanese wooden brushes was cool. Cocktails were good too. Highlight of the evening was when Morimoto himself came around and said hello. Love him, he's adorable. Five Stars!

With my mother visiting from abroad, I had to pick a lunch place for Japanese food (her request) in Meat Packing / Greenwich area and the favorites that I checked with (En, Matsuri) were closed for lunch or Mondays. I somewhat quickly decided on Morimoto as I had wanted to try the NY branch but had not been overly impressed with the Philadelphia original. A trip a few years ago for a dinner that surprisingly seemed a bit uninspired. The restaurant is quite beautiful in a refrained Japanese sort of way, multi-leveled, light wood tones, and modern lighting structure at the center. The large room was nearly empty for a Monday lunch and the serving staff were very attentive to the handful of customers. We started with a tuna pizza that essentially was a tuna carpaccio on a baked pastry base with pepper, olive, onion, tomato and a mild spicy mayo dressing over top. This was inventive and more fun then it had any right to be. We moved on to some sushi of eel and avocado maki and sea urchin / uni with quail egg. ?These were expertly prepared and the rice was well seasoned. The last item was the sea bass severed in a flavorful but not overpowering broth with avocado tempura. The whole experience left me wanting more and though the price was a bit over what I would expect, I definitely see myself going back for a full dinner.

I suspect that there is nothing more that I can add to my review of Morimoto that hasn't already been said about this fine establishment. Great trendy location. Gorgeous sprawling interior with unique artsy installations. The food speaks for itself and whatever it says it speaks volumes. Morimoto doesn't have the rockstar reputation for no good reason. My only gripe is this one. I was seated with husband all the way on the right of the restaurant, up a few steps against the wall of banquets and upon turning around I noticed that it was quite dusty behind me. That was immediately a turnoff, for a restaurant to earn this kind of status and not have someone pay attention to something such as dusting is ludicrous to me. The layer of dust looks like it's been sitting there for at least a few months. Maybe I was looking for something to be pissed off about, but that was the last thing I expected to see. I've never even seen that kind of stuff at the worst hole in the walls, let alone a Morimoto. But other than that, great knowledgeable staff, cool fun, inspiring food.

Sat at the sushi bar and had omakase, absolutely amazing; paired with a yuzu cocktail... I was in heaven. I truly feel sitting at the sushi bar allowed us an entirely different experience, we got to see how each dish was prepared, cooked and presented. The hosts are very nice, they let us keep our reservations after being delayed 15 minutes. The price was worth the culinary experience, I expected omakase at Morimotos to be much more then he priced it.

4.5 stars. Came here for a restaurant week lunch and left feeling a bit underwhelmed with the food but completely wowed with the decor and service. ?The space is dazzling, consisting of sleek, clean lines and my personal favorite-- lots of bright, shiny things. From the restaurant week menu, my date and I ordered the mixed green salad and miso soup for appetizers, the roasted bass and "angry" chicken for entrees, and both had the coconut panna cotta for dessert. ?Salad and soup were ordinary but the entrees were executed perfectly-- roasted sea bass with a delicious glaze and the "angry" chicken had a great spicy kick. ?The coconut panna cotta had a nice passionfruit gelee and accompanying cookie/cracker. I was hoping a restaurant of Morimoto's caliber would have more exciting restaurant week options, but we were pretty satisfied with our meals. ?We had a seat at the sushi bar and had a great view of the chefs working their magic. ?After looking at the regular lunch menu, we were surprised to see the prices weren't that exorbitant and felt we could come back for a moderately priced meal during the day, even after RW was over. ? For dinner, I'd say Morimoto is definitely a beautiful restaurant that's worthy of a special-occasion splurge. ?Get dressed up, enjoy some delicious Japanese cuisine, and don't forget to check out the amazing bathrooms downstairs!

This review is for the standard bento box only. I went in 2008 and this item was excellent - satisfying in every way. Fast forward to a year later, 2009, during restaurant week. We opted for these boxes instead of the more generous RW deal. In short, it just wasn't as good. The kobe beef was a lot smaller in size than before, said my friend - which mean it went from being the size of a matchbox to a couple of band-aids. My fish bento box had a piece of fish I KID YOU NOT the size of a small eraser - you know, the kind you use over and over so there's just this little scrap you have to hold tightly between thumb and forefinger to squeeze the last little bit of erasing out of? It wasn't just the size, it was ... something. It just wasn't executed with the same TLC. If people are paying this kind of price (anything over $25), you can't afford to slip. Won't be back now. I judge a restaurant on consistent execution of the simplest things.

I'm a sushi whore and I love eating here, but is it wrong if my favorite part of the experience is the bathroom? ? Sitting in one of those stalls is like being transported into the future. ?Or, perhaps it's the cumulative effect of great sake, raw fish, and an $8K Jetson's toilet that makes me like Morimoto. The oyster, foie gras, and uni app is the stuff dreams are made of - but I really think the terriyaki sauce on top kills it. ? Some of the menu seems like it was designed for tourists - which I'm not too mad at. ?I love tourists. ? You can come to Morimoto and have a top of the line sushi/kobe experience and drop your whole paycheck, or you can come in, have the rock shrimp tempura app and the ramen and be outta there (with a freshly fanned toosh) for under $40. ? Smart menu for an Iron Cheffy.

Wow, Morimoto. Best sashimi I've ever had. First time I liked all the dessert I liked somewhere, and weren't too sweet. Nice decor. Friendly and helpful service. Nice bathrooms. We had: Fugu 3 ways - Shredded skin, sashimi, and fried Sashimi platter ($30 platter) Roasted ocean trout - turnip, miso, truffle, crispy prosciutto Sea bass - sweet sake kasu, Japanese eggplant, miso Surf & Turf - kobe filet & hamachi ribbons, herbed potatoes, crushed citrus & avocado (prepared tableside) Ishi yaki buri bop - Yellowtail on rice cooked at your table in a hot stone bowl Tofu 'hot & cold' - soy milk souffle, tofu cheesecaske, maple ice cream Matcha layer cake - sesame, grenadine sauce, mandarin-plum sake sorbet Warm chocolate cake - coconut gelee, Japanese dark sugar syrup, green tea ice cream Sorbet trio - raspberry wasabi, fuji apple, passion fruit/banana ...and 4 drinks, but I don't remember what they were Basically we ate a lot. 4 people, 4 entries, 4 desserts, 2 drinks, and 2 sides. Hey, we're in NY for food and company so this all works out. EVERYTHING was good!! My only thing is that the hamachi that was cooked was good, but I enjoyed it more uncooked as sashimi. The sea bass and trout were soooo good cooked. The sea bass was very smooth, too. And the veggies they cooked with the fish were tasty tasty. We had the fugu AKA blowfish, which is one of the few places in NY licensed to prepare and serve it. It was a $70 dish, well an appetizer for us, but it was almost one of those once-in-a-lifetime opportunities, and hey, we're still alive! How can I forget that sashimi. The fish lay on a bed of ice, which kept it cold, and it all tasted so fresh. Need...to...find...good...sashimi...in Bay Area. Though that might mean emptying my wallet. Morimoto, I now understand why you are the Iron Chef. Thank you for this. I miss New York even more now.

This restaurant is a showcase of trendsetting chic. ?Sexiness oozes from the curves of the ceiling to the gorgeous people below. ?A very hot place for a date apparently, since everybody around us looked like they were on a date even though it was only a Wednesday night. ?My guest and I decided to do an appetizer tasting menu of our own so we chose various dishes to have that night instead of opting for the entrees. ?I think we fared better since got to taste a lot more. We ordered the Chicken Ramen, Rock Shrimp Tempura, the Lobster Fritters done Takoyaki style, the Kakuni, Halibut in Black Bean sauce, the Spicy King Crab Legs, and dessert of Banana Mousse in Chocolate with Macaroon. ?Other than the Lobster Fritters, everything else was fantastic. ?The Ramen was not as traditional but was amazing in its own right. ?The broth was full of depth, the noodles al dente, and the chicken was extremely succulent. ?My friend Another favorite is the Kakuni--who could resist meltingly tender roasted pork belly on congee? ?At least not this Asian gal. ?The rock shrimp is light and crispy, coated with a light wasabi glaze and light chili glaze. ?Really great tempura. ?And the dessert...definitely one of the best I've had. The banana mousse was light and airy served with a crispy macaroon and passion fruit sauce. ? I can't vouch for the sushi but I highly recommend visiting Morimoto's for their cooked dishes. ?The combinations of flavors complement each other well, producing fantastic end results that are unique and delicious. ?It is indeed a splurge but one worth the money.

The waiter that served our table was incredibly friendly and definitely knew the menu inside out, which was great because I was unsure of certain dishes. He made good conversation which seemed natural instead of forced, in order to get a better tip. The food was amazing. It wasn't too much and it wasn't too little. I ordered a seafood in broth dish and they definitely didn't cheap out on the seafood. It had lobster, king crab, shrimp, scallops, mussels, and more. The only thing I didn't COMPLETELY enjoy was the dessert. It was fine, don't get me wrong. I ordered the cheesecake of the day which ended up tasting more like a health cheesecake (sugar, butter, carb-free type) which is probably better for me :P but I was definitely expecting more of a carb-rific adventure with that one. Overall, AMAZING restaurant!

A beautiful and delicious restaurant! I came here for lunch during restaurant week and was simply taken aback by the beautifully decorated and designed restaurant. There are swaths of canvas covering the ceiling and a ?wall of bottles of water (it's cool, trust me). I had the crab croquettes, which were creamy and crispy. They were delicious and just seemed to melt in your mouth. Next was the Angry Chicken. Basically, it was a nicely spicy niece of chicken thigh, perfectly cooked all the way through. Tender and delicious. Perhaps my favorite part of the meal was dessert, which was a white chocolate panacotta. I'm not a fan of white chocolate, but I was definitely BLOWN away by this dessert. It comes in a very tiny cup and is basically froth on top of melted ice cream with some cherry syrup. It was AMAZING! The only reason I'm giving this restaurant 4 stars is that the portions are a little too small. But then again, what can you expect from a restaurant week menu?

ridiculously good. When it comes to really expensive restaurants and the belief of "you get what you pay for", Morimoto really is a dining experience that is hard to forget, whether it be in your future conversations or your potential credit card debt after eating here. first: decor is simply awesome and really impressive in the way it looks. great date spot. One complaint: the bathroom sinks were so luxurious I didn't know how to operate them. Anyway the food here is fantastic, I had the fois gras mussels and toro tartare for the appetizer. the fois gras mussels were absolutely explosive in flavor and oddly the mixture of duck liver and mussels were extremely well paired and complimentary whilst bound together by the great teriyaki glaze. the toro tartare was presented great! however, while it was good, it didn't really indicate to me that it was actually TORO I was eating, and not just typical red tuna. Next I had the duck, duck, duck and the surf and turf: The duck duck duck was really tasty, crisp, and tender. I've had good ducks in various Chinese places I've been but this kind of duck really spoke to the kind of quality you were paying for. The fois gras croissant might actually have been my favorite part of the dish; never had something like that before. Surf and turf was decent, more expensive than the duck duck duck but not as impressive. although the wagyu beef was definitely top notch but wasn't mind blowing in the same way the duck was. The turf part of the dish was rather forgettable; it was some fish on a salad, nothing crazy. ? As for dessert, 2 things: 1) totally try the tofu cheesecake. 2) don't get tea. it was on par with tea I've had at various dim sum joints. but, if you insist let it brew for awhile (i like it strong) awesome dining experience very frightening check

While visiting NYC my friend had suggested going to at least one nice restaurant while in the city. We all decided to go to Morimoto's and wow. 1st: Chelsea Park is an amazing area 2nd: Morimoto's restaurant is unfathomable. The interior is beautiful and a feeling you will never forget when you first walk inside and see that stairway. 3rd: The server was not snobby in anyway, he was very nice and the hosts were welcoming. 4th: The prices were not as bad as I would expect. They were pretty reasonable for that type of restaurant. Huge plus :) as for the food, It was good. I have the cod with the black edamame. I wouldn't say it was AMAZING, but It was good. maybe I didn't order the right thing? I am asian and use to a lot of the flavors he uses in his food, it could also be that. I had an orange martini (forgot the name)..but I didn't like it. I would visit here again tho, its one of the places I would go back to several times to try everything on the menu. Don't get me wrong though, although the food was good. Its a MUST TRY and a MUST to visit especially when you're in the city :) and Morimoto, you are my hero!

Dramatic decor with one of the most fabulous bathrooms you'll ever experience and a very cool bar downstairs. The food is marvelous from the ultra-fresh sushi and sashimi to the tasty kobe steak to the Duck, Duck, Duck to the desserts. ?If you have time and money to spare, try the omakase dinner, it's exquisite, though way too much food because they serve a full size main course rather than all small courses as you would expect! ?Exceptional selection of sake and very good wine. ?Service could not be more congenial or efficient.

Go with the omakase! 8 course tasting menu. ?One of the best meals of my life. Also tried the Fugu sashimi. For those of you that never saw the Simpsons episode where Homer was obsessed with sushi. ?That is poisionous blowfish. ?Blowfish was prepared with all the poison removed. ?I was hoping to get a little taste of the toxin, as this is how it is done in Japan. ?Supposedly your mouth gets numb but that is about it. ?Problem with that is I potentially could have not tasted the rest of my meal. ?The sushi was exquisite. ?One of the dishes that came was a uni, foie gras, and poached oyster. ?Its the triumvirate of tastes. ?This was an incredibly unctuous dish. ?Outstanding! We finished with a surf and turf. ?Wagyu beef and roast lobster. ?Beautifully done. Bravo!

I think the thing that brings Morimoto above and beyond other restaurants in this class is that it's a multisensory experience. ?You don't just taste the food. ?OK, this is already sounding cheesy. ? Most of what I remember about my evening at Morimoto isn't so much the flavor of the food (though it was definitely fantastic), but the way the perfect stemware for our wine varietal brought out its floral nose. ?The impeccable presentation of even the most complex dishes (and the simplest ones, too). ?The flawless design of the space itself. ?Everything came together perfectly to augment the basic flavor of the food itself. Yeah, seriously busting out the schmaltz, here. ?I don't care. ?It was phenomenal. ?I should add, though, that I went to Morimoto over a year ago, and that Morimoto himself was there that night. ?Things change quickly in the restaurant world, and some of these places that are one of 5-10 restaurants in a celebrity chef's roster can be really erratic. ?I definitely hit Morimoto on a night when they were still bringin' it.

I came here with a group of 8 and dined downstairs in the lounge. ?It was trying to look extra sleek ,but I thought some of the tables and seats were uncomfortably low and the rickety lucite tables seemed a little cheap. ?Same with the lucite (acrylic) chopsticks, they were slippery and hard to balance on the resting stone. The waitress was really nice, and quite knowledgeable. ?The presentation of the food was really nice, but I felt that the taste and flavors were below expectations: Toro Tartar: ?You scrape the tuna off a wooden board and then pick up accoutrements like eel sauce or wasabi cream with your scooper along the way. A real fun and interactive presentation as long as no one double dips. ?I like my tartar to have body and tang. ?This one tasted too fishy and mushy and not enough acid. ? Sashimi appetizer: ?Layers of sashimi pressed into a rectangular bar with sauces served in squeeze droppers. ?The presentation was wonderful. ?Taste? Meh. Rock Shrimp Tempura: ?A nice crunchy tempura coating, but the shrimp itself was underseasoned. ?Could have used a little salt prior to the batter step. ?Ranch dressing as a dipping sauce? ?Odd. Calamari Salad: ?This was delicious, calamari was perfectly fried and not chewy. ?Shallots and the dressing on the greens rounded it out nicely Ramen: ?The noodle looked like a flat mandarin noodle straight from the package, not a fresh noodle the way ramen is supposed to be. ?The broth was a little too salty, but the chicken flavor was good and the portion was plentiful. Seabass main entree: ?A nice cut of fish, a touch overcooked, but still moist and flavorful. ?The dashi broth and the miso eggplant was delicious (although the eggplant didn't look very elegant). ?It came with tempura'd avocado sitting in the dashi broth and some tomato which I thought was odd to pair with the seabass and eggplant. ?A decent portion, but the serving plate was way oversized. We had to wait what felt like an hour just for the entrees (the manager later came out to apologize and promised that it was an atypical night and it would never happen again which was really nice). ?So they comp'd us some desserts. ?The desserts were not very remarkable tho, I have to say, although presentation was beautiful. ?They were trying to balance east meets west (aka black sesame and chocolate ganache?) but the flavors didn't work for me. I was fortunate enough to have met Morimoto before, and will say that he seems like a very nice man, humble and funny. ?I think he should stick to simplicity and freshness instead of getting caught up with the fancy stuff and he will go a long way.

I came to Morimoto as a little splurge on my birthday. While waiting for my party to arrive, I was escorted downstairs to their bar/lounge area. While waiting downstairs, you are overwhelmed by this pretentious need to purchase a drink as soon as possible. Careful of not being the standout, I ordered 2 drinks; one of which was a little alcohol heavy and pretty uneventful, while the other provided an unimaginable experience. The latter, which Morimoto terms the "white lilly" is a sweet concoction that would instantly send alcoholics back into rehab. But I came to Morimoto for their food and not their drinks. As we made our way upstairs, the more refined and minimalistic decor of the restaurant always reminded me that I was not at my local sushi-bar and just plainly ordering a California roll would give me some disdainful glares. However, not intimidated, I decided to look over their extensive menu. Since I am not a big seafood eater (actually I do not eat seafood at all), I chose not to go with the omakase and opted to pick my own meal. Toro Tartare - Excellent, Excellent, Excellent.. and once more.. Excellent! Truly a different experience from your every day dining. The toro is minced very finely a placed in a wooden slab. It is paired with caviar and a dish with 6 different sauces/condiments over ice. Morimoto Sashimi - The server presented the Sashimi, still boxed in its wooden cage. He then went on to reveal the layers of the sashimi: seared toro, salmon, hamachi, tuna and eel. Each piece of the sashimi also comes with its own topping and is served with 5 pipettes containing 5 different sauces. Udon - This dish was unappealing and I probably would have been better not ordering it. It contains 3 different chilled udons, served with fresh grated ginger, wasabi, scallions, seasame, shiso in basically a soba sauce. Maybe it was because I didn't eat it immediately, but the soba noodles were all stuck together, which gave it a very unappetizing feeling. Again, the sauce and noodles were a little disappointing and nothing unique. Wagyu Sushi - After learning that the sushi pricing was per piece and not the usual per two, I went on to order 4 orders of the Wagyu Sushi at $8/piece. And my God, I was definitely sent to heaven. Each strip of wagyu was perfectly seasoned and seared; the rice which accompanied each slice was also perfectly cooked and had that exact sushi rice taste, which brought out the flavor of the wagyu. This was definitely one of the best dishes I have ever experienced in my life. Morimoto Imperial Pilsner - a hidden gem within all the delectable dishes was the beer at Morimoto. Although, I also tried the Hazelnut Ale, the Pilsner was by far superior. Each Pilsner (unlike the Ale) is served in a beautiful ceramic bottle (which you can keep) and its own glass. The beer itself had a smooth crisp clean taste, that I now expect in all my beers. Tofu "Hot and Cold" - A soy maple ice cream which was a perfect pairing to the warm soy bean souffle. The souffle had a grand texture and the ice cream definitely accentuated the soy taste in the dish. And third, the dish is served with a tofu cheesecake, which was silky smooth (like tofu) and a flavor that was not overly sweet with a subtle touch of soy. Overall, Morimoto was a spectacular restaurant that I would definitely recommend and hope to visit again. Each dish is served and perfectly explained iron-chef style table side. I would've gave it 5 stars if Morimoto himself were there, but it didn't really hit that 5 star spot since I already had a high expectation entering.

My wife and I split the Omakase dinner for 1 person. ?We knew it wasn't going to be enough so we ordered a spicy king crab appetizer and spicy yellowtail maki roll. ?What followed was a 2.5 hour delicious romp through Morimoto's kitchen. ?The ingredients were fresh and presented like an iron chef should. ?The size of the portions will have some people scratching their head but its quality over quantity that stand out in this place. Some highlights: The chu toro tartar was tasty and an interesting presentation with the wooden tray. ?Its wasn't my favorite thing on the night, that's for sure. Tilefish and Scallop - served raw and served seriously awesome. ?One of my favs Sea oyster with foie gras and sea urchin - ridiculously awesome but only 1 bite... spicy king crab legs - $23 appetizer. ?this was the most plentiful dish of the night...good flavor. Entree dish was Half Lobster Accompanied by Sear Wagyu Beef ?& Sweet Potatoes. ?The lobster was perfect. ?split in half and easily picked out with a fork. ?Buttery texture was perfect. ?I wasn't overly impressed with the wagyu beef. ?It was a thin slice in a teriyaki reduction sauce (i think) served over the yams. ?I liked it but it wasn't overly impressed. The service at Morimoto's was impeccable and I will certainly be back.

The best Japanese restaurant in New York City in my eyes, no question. ?I had one of, if not the best meal of my life at Morimoto, and I can't wait to go back again. First off, the decor in this place is downright breathtaking. ?I usually care less about decor and ambiance, but I'll make a special exception for this place. ?Even the bathrooms were gorgeous. ? The food was incredibly fresh. ?I got the Toro Tartar for an appetizer which tasted like it just came out of the water. ?It was so fresh and delicious. ? Everything prepared for both my fiancé and I was prepared to perfection from the Cod to the Steak. Oh, I should mention, Chef Morimoto himself was in the kitchen that night, and walked right past our table and greeted us with a little head nod. ? Quite expensive, but who can put a price on memories? ?I went here 2 years ago and my mouth still waters when I think of the food. ?I don't think you can put a price tag on that.

The Bad - Expensive (Omakase) compared to portion but thats a given The Good - Love the environment and great staff - Most of the things are okay....nothing memorable though The Bottomline- Go here if you are into raw food (meat and fish). I'm not that into raw stuff so i didn't get to eat all the "good" stuff, well what Morimoto is known for. I gave it to my friend lol....BUT if you go here, definitely get the omakase!

Along with all the other patrons, expect to strike a pose at Morimoto . Staying very true to trendy Meat Packing, the atmosphere is supremely pretentious. Check out the lighted installation made of water bottles and the toilets have touch button options: front and rear rinse, and then finally a blow dry to finish! With this being the Iron Chef's restaurant, expectations were high regarding the food. Besides the rock shrimp appetizers which were yummm and the light refreshing white lilly cocktail, nothing else really stood out. The food was good but not memorable and I nearly cried when we got the bill (a $100 per person).

The food was just simply fantastic. ?Our entire table ordered the Omikase and enjoyed every dish that came out. ?What a great way to experience a great meal. ?There is a reason why Mr. Morimoto is an Iron Chef. I would have given Morimoto 5 stars but one thing that bugged me was the service. ?Our head waiter was great but his servers were terrible. ?There were probably 5 different people bringing out each dish and a couple of them needed to be trained again. ?I guess when you are spending $120+ per head service should be top notched. ?A few wait staff were too lazy to go around to the other side of table and basically handed the dish to everyone. ?They didn't even place it on the table. ?Another just handed us our drinks and dinner ware. ?Also a few of them couldn't even pronounce the food they were serving. ?Very unfortunate. I would definitely go back for the food.

I've been lucky enough to go here twice and had a much better experience the second time...not least because Chef Morimoto was there and came around to every table to shake diners' hands. ?I respected him a great deal already and do so more now. The first time I went, I ordered a little too safely (soba noodles, soft shell crab roll, etc.) and was disappointed. ?Yes, these dishes are executed well, but I didn't feel they were so extraordinary as to match the reputation -- or the price -- of the restaurant. ? The second time, I was slightly more adventurous and it definitely paid off. ?The kakuni (pork belly) is fabulous, and wonderfully seasoned. ?What Morimoto really wins for, though, is presentation. ?My boyfriend ordered the toro tartare and an amazing yellowtail rice dish, both of which were prepared tableside in an elaborate fashion. ?In all honesty, two of the most beautiful dishes I've ever seen served at a restaurant. I'm not sure Morimoto's food is so much better than any other top-notch Japanese restaurant, but between the fantastic service and the beautiful presentation they go a long way in justifying their prices. ?I will go back. (PS -- You *must* try the plum sake. ?Heaven.)

It was very tasty. ?I would like to go back again. This was my first time to try famous Morimoto restaurant in Meat Packing. I've been there during restaurant week so I can try Bento box for $24.07. Delicious. Tempura was very crunchy and tasty. Miso soup tasted the best so far. They have excellent broth so miso soup is not too salty. Each Sushi nigiri pieces were very delicious.

Sushi tasting is one of the most amazing things to do when here. ?The head sushi chef, Robby, is a skilled swordsman and is extremely innovative. ?It's a culinary journey that has made my "not so into sushi" friends, into believers. ?Some will ONLY eat sushi at Morimoto from now on. My girlfriend and her friends love the bathrooms that are located downstairs. ?It's fully automated with heated seats, bidet, control over the water flow, direction, etc... ?Needless to say, they are usually gone for 20+ minutes. The layout and decor is extremely sexy and slick. ?It's a great environment to dine and have good conversations. ?I suggested this place for my friend to take his big first date - They are now married! Things I like there: Morimoto's Junmai Sake, the rock shrimp, tuna toast, bibimbap, tofu which is made in front of you (great palate cleanser), carpaccio, and sitting at the sushi bar tasting the assorted fresh catches of the day. The best days to go there in my opinion is a Wednesday or Thursday. ?The food is the freshest, less crowded, and you can take your time enjoying the food.

Morimoto's is definitely one of my favorite japanese restaurants. I've been to the one in Philly and been to the one in meat packing twice. The food is absolutely amazing. The sushi is NOT fishy and NOT slimy.. that's always a plus. I was recently there for rest week and i must say that they have a fantastic lunch menu. I ordered the wagyu beef bento box and loved every morsel of it. For dessert, they served a green tea and coconut panna cotta that was so amazingly light and sweet that i wanted to lick the cup in came in and also wanted to ask for seconds. will definitely go back some time soon for mpre of their well prepared and tasty dishes.

I knew I needed to give Morimoto a second shot after a lackluster first performance. ?The move: thousands of appetizers and assorted sushi to share, with a group, make for a much more enjoyable experience than the entree route. The beef carpaccio and lobster croquettes were just ok - beef was a little slimy, and the croquettes were more dough than lobster. ?But the tuna pizza, rock shrimp tempura and sushi/sashimi were all delicious. ?Rock shrimp tempura is extremely similar to the offerings at Tao and Buddhakan, but that doesn't make it any less of a delicious fried accompaniment to other, lighter dishes. ?Another tip - The spicy sushi rolls don't mess around - they have a real kick, as advertised. ?As an entree I tried the roasted ocean trout with turnip, miso & crispy prosciutto. ?Delicious, but I was almost too full to enjoy. ?Next time I'll opt for the black cod instead. The space itself is beautiful - in the lounge area downstairs, there are several high-top tables spaced for large groups. ?We noted (and we're all fit, relatively tiny people) that the chairs at the high-tops are absurdly small - the guys were falling off their seats. ?If you're a group of guys or your date is some kind of athlete, I'd specifically request a booth. ?Order dessert - the flourless chocolate cake with caramel ice cream and homemade whipped cream was absurd.

This is another one of those overrated, overhyped name-brand NYC restaurants. As expected, the food is high quality with lots of authentic, unusual Japanese dishes. The crab brain (kani miso) was really good! However, the service was A-W-F-U-L!! The waitress could not answer our questions about the menu and the specifics of the fish. She was clueless. She brought us one round of drinks, took our order, then disappeared for "an hour". We had to complain to another waiter finally to get our food and another round. ?On the way out, the maitre'd asked me about my experience and I said, "It was average." He was shocked, but didnt offer up anything of value as a reply. Why ask? The bathroom and downstairs bar were funky and chic. However, one goes to good restaurants for great food and service and expect the toilets and ambiance to be in-line.

Disappointed, yet pleased. So when I found out we were coming here, I had such high expectations of this place. Of course with reading reviews and hearing from friends about what to try I guess I set the bar really high. For example, the kobe beef carpaccio; everyone, including the waitress, said that it was one of the most popular appetizers. When I finally got a taste of it, I was just thinking, "oh, okay...". It wasn't something I was going to rave about. However, everything else we ordered was more than expected! The tempura calamari salad, sashimi, maki, and wagyu steak were wonderful! --the spicy yellowtail roll and wagyu steak made high honors for me. We had a great time, though I do have to say that the high tables with the low-back stools were not the most comfortable seats at all. Will I go back? Sure! Probably not as often, since this place is pricy, but I wouldn't mind the friend-birthday-outing dinner.

The highlight for sure was the spicy king crab listed under hot appetizer. ?At $23, it's not a cheap appetizer but it's worth every penny! ?Best dish there and I would go back just for that.

Came here while on a vacation during the All Star game in 2008. Im from Newport Beach, CA (Southern California). Found myslef at the sushi bar sitting next to a sweedish model and another hot girl. Thats NYC for ya. Place is hard to find. I dont mean the location because its correct and how can you get lost with Google and mapquest in a grid street network like NYC. I mean lost from finding the place from the outside. I saw Japaneses writing and thought is this it? Funny how some of the best restaurants in the world do not need advertise their name or make it obvious they are there. If its that good people will find the place. Giving props to Iron Chef Morimoto I ordered the Omakase. I wanted to see what he had to offer. The Chef was at the restaurant when I was there and stood overlooking the sushi bar from an adjacent uprise. Kinda cool. The first item out was a little bit of ahi tartar. Came out looking like a painters ink pad. The dob of ink that was too resemble black ink was fish roe/caviar. Yummy. The final dish was a "spicy lobster". The lobster wasn't really spicy tho. At least to me. Im Mexican. Of course, there is no Mexican's in NYC. lol. Very good tho. I recommended it to the model next to me. It was spicy to her. It came with a lemon dipping cream that evened it out tho. Great combo. Of course all the sushi I had was amazing. Perfect cuts that melt in your mouth. Check out the restrooms while here. I was a bit tipsy and didn't know wether to wipe my behind or press a button to have the ol H20 do it for me. I was tempted to press the button but pictured myself going back to the sushi bar all wet and having to flirt with the model looking like I pissed myself. I dropped about $200 for myself. Omakase was about $100 and the rest was alohol and tip. Will def come back here. Must also try Nobu if back in NYC

For sushi in Manhattan, Morimoto is a safe bet. First of all, I think it's worth a trip just to see the enormity of the space itself. I am typically not a fan of 'modern' super white walls and space aged design, but somehow this gargantuan, scene of a restaurant pulls it off and makes it acceptable. (And yes, it *is* a scene! ?Dress code for men: Button down long sleeve shirts, jeans, "hip" shoes. ?Dress code for women: Patterned but unobtrusive simple dresses. - Just an observation ;) We did *not* get the Omakase but we did (thanks to reading yelp reviews) get the Tuna Tartar - and what fun!!! The presentation of it is so fun! (Much to my friend's dismay. Any unusual seeming food really disturbs him). ?And yes, I think it's great when food can be fun! The 'go withs' for the tar tar were just fabulous - the fresh wasabi! the roe (I adore thee) - and amazing guacamole! The eel and avocado roll melts in your mouth, and is a must-order if you're going the roll route. On the other hand, the spicy yellowtail roll, while fresh, was not very spicy at all - and I asked for jalapenos to come in it, though they were entirely pointless and may as well have been bell peppers! ?So sad. The california roll was my friend's doing and unfortunate as even the crab meat, and ultimately the entire roll, was bland. The Chocolate ganache with accompanying sesame seed ice cream was nothing short of amazing. And yes, the toilets were interesting (we do have to note the bathrooms when reviewing Morimoto!) and I was in love with the flowers behind them in the walls. ?I really hope to go back here with my sis sometime, and will attack more of the appetizers, and try the oysters with foie gras for sure (because, really, how could I not?)

I think Morimoto is overrated. While the interior décor is very attractive, the food is just barely above average. Our waiter was able to hook us up with free desert (an assortment of chocolates), but we didn't even finish it because it wasn't very good. Not worth the money - I'd rather save a few dollars and eat something tastier at St. Mark's.

If you like cool bathrooms, Morimoto has one of the coolest. However, if you're considering going during Restaurant Week, DON'T. The portions are ridiculously small, the dessert sampling got increasingly bad, and the waiters got offended if you left your napkin on the table while going to the bathroom. They would make a face at whomever is sitting while you're gone, and disgruntingly fold it. Weird.

Had a few appetizers and entrees along with sushi this time. The beef carpaccio had sesame & hot oil. The beef a little overcooked but tasty. The oyster foie gras had beautiful plating and tasted decadent. The foie gras was seared perfectly, and the oyster warm but not fully cooked. The uni that came with it was not cooked and very fresh. If I could get only one appetizer at Morimoto it would be the spicy king crab, which has sweet crabmeat and spicy sauce on top. For sushi we got eel, which was smoked and well cooked. The ikura was salty & briny. The specials were sockeye salmon, white eel, and red snapper. The sockeye salmon was lean and the white eel was a little bony and tasted like eel but different than the regular smoked eel that I am used to. The tai (red snapper) was a little tougher than I thought it would be but it was still a very tasty white fish. We got some rolls and the softshell crab roll had perfectly cooked crab but the asparagus was not a necessary addition to the roll. The spicy tuna roll ?was good but there was nothing special about it. The salmon skin roll had crunchy skin but I would have liked more skin. The otoro was perfect and it melted in my mouth. This is always my favorite piece of sushi/sashimi. For the entrees we tried wagyu beef bibimbap. The beef was fatty and melted in my mouth similar to the otoro. The rice was good but a few more vegetables would be nice in the dish. The duck duck duck had three different preparations of duck. Each piece of duck had crunchy skin, and all three sauces served with the duck were good. There was no gamey taste at all to the duck. They tried to do a take on Peking duck but bread was too soggy to make it successful. Overall this is an impressive place to bring out of town guests and the fish is always fresh.

Leading up to our dinner I was prepared to be impresse, amazed and just plain blown away. ?Alas it was not so... Walking up to the restaurant (under highline) it's a little dark and you walk through red drapes. ?Then 2 sets of sliding doors before you even get to the maitre d'. ?Restaurant is modern and simplistic. ?A lot of white, blond wood, grey and glass. ?Im sure the ceiling is supposed to be different but somehow to me just looks like siding. ?I know, I'm terrible but really i just felt so blah. ?While waiting for our table we headed downstairs to the bar area and i did like the wall on the staircase made of all the glasses. So once seated 3 out of the 5 of us had drinks. ?We didnt get a chance to get ours but waiter came up, gave us menus and said "i see everyone has drinks" and ran off before i could even speak up :( ?Drink pretty much took ages to get. Since we were heading out right after dinner we went light. No omakase for us. ?I did my usual chirashi and the rest of the table did rolls. ?Sashimi for my dish was very fresh and it was very good but just not amazing enough to return for or to pay $32 for. ?It also came with miso soup but this was given to me with no spoon. ?I didnt pay much attention to it but by the time they realized my soup had grown cold. ?They also got one of our orders mixed up and had an extra order of one roll (super salty salmon skin) ant forgot the other. ?They corrected this at no charge but having it fixed was a pain. ?Waiter had the orders/people mixed up and didnt understand the problem at first. All in all, we left unimpressed and i doubt we'll be back.

My friend is really into the celeb chef thing, and always ends up getting disappointed. I've been to Morimoto in Japan (where it had a Michelin star at the time) and was wowed more by the fact that the building was a former gentleman's club and by the beautiful spherical chunk of ice in my umeshu. While the design of this place was swanky, it lacked a wow factor and the food didn't live up to the hype. Appetizers (thumbs up) - Toro tartare has a beautiful presentation (just like their Tokyo restaurant), but overall eh. - Oyster foie gras was delish but drowned in the sauce - Tuna pizza was thinly sliced, fresh, and flavorful. Entree - I tried the cod. It was ok. Once again drowned in sauce, which some may love. - Friend got the bass. It was ok. - Another got the surf and turf. Also ok. Wagyu, they said, lacked the flavor because of the fillet and preparation. Dessert - Sorbet trio of fiji apple, raspberry wasabi, and pineapple. Once again, just ok. Bathroom - Toto toilets that greet you by raising the seat! Conclusion: Save your money.

People say you're paying for the Morimoto name here; well, I'll gladly pay for it. ?Get the omakase. ?$120 pp, but totally worth it with high quality ingredients, good portions, and fresh fish. ?One of the dishes on the omakase had both lobster tail and wagyu beef. ?The only dish that didn't really do it for me was the fondue-type dish, which was too salty, and I have to agree with another reviewer that the oyster/foie gras dish had a bit too much teriyaki sauce. ?Otherwise, I left full and very happy. ?Best fine dining type meal I had while I was in NY. P.S. ?Do check out the bathrooms.

Hm... it's good food, but it's really not worth the money. I've tried their special of the night - fried blow fish, the raw bar platter (huge plate of oyster, lobster, and king crab), toro tartare, random sushi pieces, and duck duck duck as the entree. They are all decent, but really nothing blew my mind. For the price I paid, I've had better.

EVERYTHING I HAD TASTED LIKE FLUFFY BUTTERFLIES! Went here for lunch (had dinner over a year ago-can't quite remember what I got). ? The octopus app tasted like thin slices of buttery bacon! The marinated cod entree had such a creamy, smooth texture that I couldn't quite grasp it with my chopsticks, so white girl use fork ;( but OMG... And for dessert- the hot and cold tofu-like sugar clouds! LOVE THIS PLACE. I wish I could afford to eat here every day! The servers and staff were all very nice, too. :) ? The only thing I didn't like was that they sat these loud southern tourists next to me and my bf. Although we had almost finished our meal, it did kind of intrude on our private little corner when there were, in fact, other open tables farther away-but I was nice and made friends! ;-)

The space is well designed, although situated on an empty block of 10th, directly across from Mario Batali's new spot. ?They are swarmed with staff, all of them friendly, casual, attentive and without any attitude, and it was the best service I remember. ?The o-toro was tender, melted well, and we shared the tofu cheesecake and the chocolate torte, which may sound unspectacular but reached an amazing level of richness, flavor and smoothness. ?This was considered by everyone to be the best dessert. The bar downstairs is quite cool. ?I'm not a fan of the Miami Vice aquamarine glass, but the space is nice, a combo ?of low seats for private conversation, and barspace. ?A great place to meet for a drink or go for the omakase seating. ?Their separate styles of seating is interesting without seeming to ghettoize anyone in some netherworld of seating. ?They had 12 sushi chefs working behind the bar, and it all looked efficient, featuring kohada and aji. ?The kohada was firm and clean, but I wouldn't say the fish was particularly superb compared to other spots, although you could easily do worse and pay more. ? They only take reservations up to 1 month in advance. ?A place appropriate for your friends, a date or your family. ? It has a cool, modern vibe, not too dark. ?I would like to return for the omakase seating.

Restaurant Week Review: Fast seating, fast service. ?Lovely soup and salad, loved the dressing with crunchy scallions. ?I got the chicken, curious and thinking it would be interesting. ?Matt got the Chef's Sushi Sampler. ?Everything was uninspired. ?I was hoping for much more. ?Sure it was good, and it was fast, but come on- its Morimoto- Iron Chef- give me something good! ?The decor was (although I'll sound nerdy) really really cool. ?Worth the trip for the bathrooms for sure- although the heated seats were broken. ?I'd go back to try some rolls, but wish I was given more incentive. ?Out of 10- 7

Saw an appetizer item: TORO TARTARE on Best thing ever ate one day so i told my friend that i must come here for this item and we did! Location/Service: Reservation is required because it gets pretty packed on weekends. ?It is located in Chelsea market which is so awesome because you can wait for your table at the chelsea market. ?The service was great as well. My friend and I got here around 8 PM and I told the waitress that we are only here for the appetizer. She ?seated us right away and didn't tell us to move to the bar ! ( some restaurant would tell their customer to move to the bar if the only thing he or she is ordering is an appetizer, so I doubled checked with her before we sat down). ?Not only ?was the modern design inside the restaurant attracted my but the bathroom was very clean as well! Food: the only thing we ordered here was the TOROTARTARE. ?The TORO TARTARE was in a paste form and served packed in a very special bamboo tray and topped with CAVIAR! The TORO Tartare came with another dish of dipping sauce which is consisted of : Wasabi paste, Avacado Paste, Nori Paste, Tiny Crunchy Senbei, light mayo, and chopped chives. ?The whole plate of appetizer also came with a soy sauce for dipping but I didn't like it since I thought the 6 different sauce that came with the tartare was enough. ?There is really no particular way of dipping the sauce, the waiter told us to do it however we like. ?Those sauce pairs perfectly with the fatty toro tartare and the caviar brings this dish to a whole another level!. ?The quality of the fish is so superb but because we only wanted to try this dish, I did not intend to stay there for their sashimi which received quiet a lot of reviews. According to my friend this restaurant is more Americanized and the dish was tailored to people who enjoy Asian fusion dishes. Overall the quality of the food is great but if you are looking for something more Authentic you should pick another sushi restaurant! What made this trip worth it was that my friend and I saw MORIMOTO at the restaurant and got a chance to take a pic with him! He was very polite and friendly which earned him another star! 4.5 stars !

Went here for lunch during restaurant week and was satisfied but not "Morimoto'd". Our selection of nigiri was reasonably fresh but not melt in my mouth good. Desert were lame cookies but who does Japanes for desert? They also obviously sat us in the "restaurant week" section ,which was nowhere near as nice as the rest of the joint. Downstairs is a very cool looking bar/lounge that I would like to try out later. The real highlight of Morimoto was the bathroom. They have Japanese toilets that can wash your parts and then blow dry them after. Those crazy kids! My wife said her toilet also made bird noises but I can't vouch for that. Our waiter was good and I am guessing that a non-restaurant week dinner would probably impress more.

Food was delish. ?Service was awesome. I had the tasting menu and every dish tasted really good and the presentations were beautiful. ?The first course was a Toro tartare served with a light, sweet soy sauce and 5 different dipping pastes. ?That dish was AMAZING. ?So good. ?The next few dishes were also very good, but nothing really stood out for me. ?Some even lacked originality. ?The 2nd dish was Seared Amber Jack with a sweet soy sauce. ?This dish tasted a lot like the Chinese steamed fish w/ginger & scallions. ...So 4 dishes later came the main course, the surf & turf. ?It came with a broiled, half lobster and a grilled kobe beef strip drenched in a sweet soy sauce. ?The lobster was well seasoned with a spicy something rub and came with the creme freshe. ?It was great without the creme freshe, but superb with it. ?Great combination of flavors. ?This is the first time I had kobe beef, and it wasn't all it was hyped up to be. ?It was really good, but not as tender as how I imagined it to be. ?Just as tender as a filet, and more fatty. ?I think the sauce it was in was a little too salty. ?It would have been perfect with rice to tone down the boldness of the dish. ?The dessert was ok. ?I didn't even finish it. ? All in all, the meal was delicious and the ambiance was really cool. ?Was it worth the $200 I spent? ?Most of the people in my group was not full after the meal, so not really. ? Minus 1 star.

Enough people have given this place really high ratings, but I had to add to it because it's probably one of the best dining experiences in NY I've ever had. There's not a single thing that disappointed here - everything from the special bonito appetizer (silky smooth fish), the surf and turf platter (beef and pieces of raw fish), the cod, and the tofu cheesecake trio dessert - it was all incredible, and also very artfully presented. The cocktails are also very inventive, and they certainly do not rip you off as they are quite strong! The bonito appetizer and the tofu cheesecake were my favorite things here, along with the miso marinated cod entree. A lot of people are wary of tofu, but in this cheesecake, it gives the cake a lightness that cheesecake definitely needs. This is the lightest cheesecake you will ever eat, and it is perfectly sweetened. The bonito appetizer was probably the best piece of raw fish I'd had in my life. My friend and I wanted to get the blowfish, but unfortunately it was out of season, so instead we got this. We have no regrets ordering that. The cod was pretty spectacular - perfectly marinated with the most amazing flavor. I don't think cooked fish could get better than that. On a side note, the bathroom is very cool. I love the toilets! One bad thing that happened was that they mixed up our orders - we'd actually ordered the duck duck duck entree instead of the cod, but the cod was so good when it came out that we decided to forget asking for the duck. I can't imagine any dish here being a disappointment. Be prepared to shell out a decent amount of dough to eat here, but I can almost guarantee that it will be worth every penny.

I was taken here for my birthday. I came here really dressed up and ready to try and enjoy their famous Morimoto omakase. ?Let's just say, it was just a fun eat. It was disappointing. The presentation was very unique, with all sorts of dishes yet foreign to my taste buds coming out one after another. As for the taste? I don't know if anything was worth remembering. In fact, I don't even recall what it tasted like even by looking at the pictures I took. Also, for a formal restaurant, the table set-up could have been better given its spacious interior. ?It looks like a set-up of a Buffet-style restaurant- ?the tables are too close together and spread randomly throughout the restaurant, providing no privacy for a couple. I think my table was stuck near the stairs next to the sushi bar. ?Random. Anyway, this place is something you should try at least once given that it IS the famous Morimoto's restaurant. ?I don't know if I'll ever return though, since good Japanese restaurants are of abundance in Manhattan.

Beautiful food, beautiful sushi bar, beautiful space. Great restaurant. My wife and I went to NYC this past weekend in part because it was "restaurant week" which in NYC means that several hundred restaurants get together to offer $24 lunches and $35 dinners in a 3 course (usually) format. My thought was that a restaurant the quality of Morimoto would take the opportunity to pull people in that may not otherwise be able to go there and show off how nice their restaurant is. And they did. For restaurant week they offered a bento box meal with salad, miso soup, nigiri and maki rolls, vegetable tempura and the main item which was either wygu beef, black cod or a vegetable. The tempura was so light you cant believe it. My black cod was perfectly cooked and delicious. This was great. However... I ended up ordering more dishes because their menu compels you to. I have never seen lamb carpaccio on a menu but Morimoto's got it and it was fantastic. Our group had both the lamb and beef carpaccio and the herbs, salt and oil on both made them really something to remember. We were there with another restauranteur and spent a lot of time admiring the beautiful kitchen and sushi bar. If you are going to NYC there is obviously a lot of choice but I suggest trying this beautiful Asian spot with fantastic sushi.

Bf brought me here for my bday during our NYC weekend, and it was a wonderful treat. Kobe beef carpacchio, foie gras on oysters, fresh cut sashimi, seafood subeyaki, makes me drool just thinking back! Service was also phenomenal. The decor is modern and casual, lots of concrete and glass bottles, tables made from tree trunks. It fit right into the trendy meatpacking district. I also acquired a taste for cold sake, which according to the waiter, is the ONLY way to drink most sake without burning out all the flavor.

I'm a fan of Masaharu Morimoto, I mean who isn't? I met him when I was eating at one of his restaurants and he was down to earth, really cool, and pretty funny, so I wish I had something good to say about his eponymous restaurant. Unfortunately I don't. Well, the decor was sleek, but that's it. Let's start with the food of course. I went for lunch and ordered the kobe bento box. The kobe was stir-fried -- who the hell stir fries kobe? The whole point of kobe, in my opinion, is to display the tenderness and flavor of the beef -- stir fried kobe loses those qualities on both fronts. It tasted like every other piece of stir fried beef that I've ever had. The tempura was doused in a heavy mayo sauce, overwhelming once again, the fresh taste of the ingredients as well as smothering out all additional flavors. My friends got the sashimi bento and the angry chicken. The sashimi was fresh, but not spectacular (as opposed to the amazing sushi to be had at blue ribbon or sushi yasuda) while the angry chicken was tender, but lacked that oomph that wows you. All style, no substance. My belly was quite angry. Perhaps, I will give it another go around during dinner time, but lunch was definitely subpar.

My friend and I were visiting NYC and went to Morimoto on a busy Friday night. We both ordered the omakase ($120 per person). The problem (or the beauty) with omakase is, you never know what you're going to get, so it was a little scary for us. We had a total of 8 courses, and every course was spectacular, even the wheat grass shot (yes, that's considered a course). By the end of the dessert (the 8th course), we were so full we were barely able to get out of our seats. Since the omakase menu changes, I won't bother listing out all the courses in detail, but it had a little bit of everything: toro tartare, salad, sushi, duck, beef, lobster, oyster, and dessert.

Amazing decor. Sophisticated ambience. I wanted to stay in the stall -- no, not just the bathroom, but the stall itself -- to admire its beauty.... so I'll let you imagine how awesome the rest of the place is. Fantastic drink called Hydrangea - I've never tasted anything quite like it. Delicious! Thank goodness dinner came in the nick of time, otherwise this beezy would have been stumbling all over the place... The food was excellent as I had expected. I can't imagine not coming back (and/or bringing Morimoto-virgins) The only sort of bad thing was our waitress; she was really peppy and kind of pushy. Nothing terrible though. Enjoy!

Trendy, chic, and sophisticated architectural design concept. All of which complements even better than expected Japanese cuisine by Morimoto. This is EXPENSIVE, however, you cannot evaluate based on monetary value anymore. There are so many other elements to tinker all your five sense to another level. Treat this as a religious patronage to Morimoto's iron chef status, and you will enjoy it. Note: Prix Fixe Menu does not do this place justice, order something else.

Would you rather have a tiny roll that is 10 TIMES more expensive than a huge platter of food?! Then,Morimoto is for you! I went here to celebrate a friend's birthday. Just finished eating as a matter of fact! First off, yes, it's expensive but it is worth the price only if you don't concentrate on ordering only Sushi. To drink: Mornimoto's 5 year aged Sake - pretty good. Honestly, I haven't had that many Sake's in my life but this has been the best. But for $70 it had better be. I felt it was worth it. For starters: Spicy Tuna Roll - very good, but I have had similar quality elsewhere for cheaper. Wagyu Beef Tartar - wow, simply wow. But prepare to see the smallest plate in the entire place. It is tiny. But it is Wagyu beef and that's what you're paying for. Some Egg Custard with Foie Gras - I looooved this but my girlfriend didn't like it at all. If "Foie Gras Creme Brulee" sounds good to you, order it. You will love it. Entree: Something Ocean Trout - Fish that felt like butter. And i don't mean it was covered in butter, it was just perfectly cooked and tasted very good. Surf and Turf - Got my Wagyu beef rare (I ordered it that way) and it was very good. There was some salad with seafood and that was just terrific. Desserts: Warm Chocolate Cake with Popcorn Ice cream - the cake is what you would expect but we got it because of the Popcorn Ice cream and it didn't dissapoint. It's weird to be eating ice cream that tastes like popcorn, but it's a good weird. Very delicious. But savor it, it is tiny. Coconut Panacatta - Best part of the meal for me. I am a huge fan of Passion Fruit and this dessert was a must get for me. One of the bowls will have the actual coconut panacatta topped with a thin layer of passion fruit jelly. Simply amazing. The other bowl is passion fruit noodles (seriously) with Basil ice cream. i kid you not. It sounds weird. Your brain will be confused but it is just fun to eat. Service was excellent. Total for everything was (with 16% tip) $275. It was worth every penny. Definately going back. Did i mentioned WE MET MORIMOTO HIMSELF and took pictures? Oh yeah! Pros: Morimoto was there. Menu is creative and delicious. Cons: Portions are small. It's quality over quantity.

Oh my sweet baby Jesus. Wow, was this establishment the real deal!!! We decided to try Iron Chef Morimoto's and were not disappointed. Our experience was top notch from start to finish. We sampled several dishes and they were as follows: Toro tartare - "Wowee!" as my friend Toki from Dethklok would say. This was fabulous. You are served finely chopped, really almost a purée of Toro on a serving board and spatulas to scrap and dip into the caviar, aioli and wasabi delights. Lamb carpaccio - so not what I was expecting. Tasty servings with yuzu and infused oil. Sooo good. Crispy rock shrimp tempura - this is an old Nobu fave of mine. However there were two flavors, one being wasabi. Well played Morimoto, well played. Kakuni Pork - served on a bed bed if congee, which I love. Pork was flavorful and very tender. Lobster fritters - yay to my Japanese soul brother for these little gems. Roasted ocean trout with turnip miso truffle and prosciutto - yum. Just a huge sound of yum eminating from me while dining on this. Yes, our meal was expensive but it was well worth it. We had a lovely 3 hour meal and the staff were accomdating and friendly. Tonight made me think of my first expererience at Matsuhisa back in 1990. I felt so high on the food and this pretty much brought back that feeling. Again, money well spent.

Sorry, Morimoto. Your $120/pp omakase left me wanting more. More specifically, it left me wanting a huge plate of $20 bonchon at St. Mark's Place. And yes, I really did get bonchon afterwards. 7 or 8 unimpressive courses... the first course (toro tartare) showed promise, but I think presentation was 80% of the appeal. Most of the plates were raw seafood plates, and the rest were HEAVILY seasoned with teriyaki sauce or soy sauce not unlike what you can purchase at the Chinatown supermarkets. BORING. The dessert was another huge letdown... some sort of chocolate mousse thing on top of some more chocolate. I thought it was way too sweet and again, unimaginative. Granted, it was really fresh seafood. But if all I wanted were fresh sushi I would not need to patronize an Iron Chef restaurant, where creative and innovative recipes should be the sell. I did appreciate the fact that they let us keep our reservation even though we were a good 30 minutes late. The service after we sat down, though, was mediocre at best. The various people who brought out our food did a pretty poor job of describing each dish... frankly we could not understand 80% of what they were saying and sadly we cannot recall most of what we ate that night... Crossing this place off my list forever.

Restaurant Week Winter 2011 They skimped on the portions and options for lunch. I would have liked more raw fish, but the unique, balanced bento box, professional service and stylized ambience made the outing worthwhile. ? The tender black cod was prepared in a sweet bean sauce. My wife loved it. The fish was perfectly cooked and flavors were curious, but welcome. The fresh miso soup was served with a single slab of soft tofu. The vegetable tempura consisted of baby leek and other Asian vegetables in a light lemon cream sauce. This was the surprise highlight of the night. The 3-piece spicy tuna roll and 3-piece sushi nigiri did not shine. Other sushi restaurants do much better. The green leaf salad with dried fish flakes was simple, forgettable, but provided necessary balance of greens. The green tea cocoanut panna cotta with berries and white chocolate stick showed lots of flair and made a memorably satisfying conclusion to the meal. RW ranking #3 of 5. See entire RW list for other rankings.

Totally worth it! The place is beautiful the ambience very cool the service top notch and the food....amazing!!! Real authentic japanese food served in beautiful and creative presentations. Everything we had was perfect. Must try the toro tartare and the lobster fritters! Desert: flour less chocolate cake with caramel popcorn. The only down side: the bill. Come ready to drop a nice penny but you'll get your money's worth. The whole experience was perfect and I will definitely be coming back.

The short take: Anything raw is excellent. Anything cooked is eh. The Good: Tuna tartar was excellent. The different sauces were interesting but anything more than the wasabi took away from the delicate taste of the tartar. ?Tuna pizza was outta this world! Highly recommended! ?The light lemon brings the herb and sweet flavors to life over a healthy bed of tuna. ? Kampachi Carpaccio, reminds me of traditional Chinese steamed fish. ?Soy and chives with a kick. ?The fresh fish makes this dish great. ?Chefs choice sashimi, super fresh and a great value to boot. ?You just cant go wrong with this dish. ?Spiced Spiny Lobster with Yuzu Crème Fraiche, the lobster was cooked to perfect done-ness. ?Unfortunately like all the cooked dishes it was a bit over seasoned. ? Fukumitsuya morimoto junmai daiginjo Sake, highly recommended. ?Subtle and sweet. The Bad: Rock shrimp was over salted and over sauced. ?Feels like a popcorn shrimp dish ordered off a child's menu. ?The inconsistency with size means you get some pieces that are almost all batter. ?Nobu does this dish better. ?The sushi platter, rice was just a bit on the undercooked side and the vinegar was a bit overwhelming. ?This did not play well with thin slice of fish on top. ?Skip this and go for Sashimi. ?Oyster with uni was the biggest let down. ?Drenched in oyster like sauce seemingly to cover up the off taste of the oyster. ? The eh: Spiced Spiny Lobster with Yuzu Crème Fraiche, the lobster was cooked to perfect done-ness. ?Unfortunately like all the cooked dishes it was a bit over seasoned. ? Seared wagu beef was also cooked perfectly, but the sauce was a little too much store bought teryaki.

Made last minute reservations at Morimoto and while I'm glad I went, I necessarily wouldn't go back again. ?The service was great, if not, as another reviewer said, "overemphatic." ?The atmosphere/design of the restaurant is definitely a highlight -- it's worth going just to check out the interior. We ordered a few sushi rolls to start and was surprised at how great they were -- rated some of the best sushi I had. ?My entree, the ishi yaki buri bop, was a bit bland. ?My friend's entree looked more appetizing. Overall, a good experience, but I'll probably try another restaurant next time I'm in town.

I've loved Morimoto ever since I first started watching Iron Chef years ago. ?I ?Ioved watching those old battles with Bobby Flay and he was always my favorite iron chef. ?Which is why I was a bit hesitant to go to his restaurant in NYC; I had heard mixed things about it, and I didn't want to ruin what ever concept I had in my head about him. After a friend went and recommended it, I couldn't hold back anymore, especially after she mentioned that the dinner crowd was a slightly awkward mix of normal people and really old men with younger women - it sounded like a good opportunity to people watch and try out the food, so Felicia and I decided to try it out. The restaurant is a lot of fun - the dining room is creatively laid out, and a feast to the eyes, and you get a sense of energy walking into the large space that is youthful and vibrant, a very different feel from most high end dining rooms. I was really excited to try the fugu, which to this day I still associate with the episode of the Simpson's where Homer eats it and supposed only has a few hours left to live. ?Sadly, after eating it, I think it's more of a "hey look at me I can eat a really poisonous fish" thing than a "this is actually very tasty" thing. ?I had heard that chefs in Japan who are skilled can leave a little bit of poison on the fish such that it tingles your lips, but there was none of that (maybe that's a good thing). ?The fugu came out in two varieties, fried and sashimi, along with some sauce on the side and both were fairly bland. Fortunately the main courses were bright and exciting. ?Felicia and I both ordered seafood - the seafood toban yaki for her and the lobster for me. ?Both were good and I thought the tobn yaki was an especially good value given the size of the dish. ?The flavors were strong and forceful, which I liked, but ultimately nothing spectacular. Ultimately we both had a really good time, but for the money, I think there are too many other places I would rather go to that would have been more special. ?Maybe I should reserve judgment until I come back and try to omakase, but my gut tells me I can do better elsewhere. ?The stand out quality of Morimoto's was the atmosphere as it was refreshing to go to a place that felt so vibrant for once. ?I'd recommend Morimoto's to Iron Chef fans who want to see what's up, but if you are looking for sublime seafood I would say your dollar is better spent elsewhere.

I felt as tho I was eating art. ?The presentation is so lovely and intricate. ?The food was delish. ?The ambience is rally nice. ?One of the nicest restaurants I've been to. ?Definitely and experience to remember. ?Pricing is par for the course when you're eating food of this caliber. The tuna tartare was divine! Chef Morimoto is a genius.

How can you go wrong with an Iron Chef? ?This isn't the kind of place you would go to on a random day. ?It should be reserved for some special occasion, such as birthday, anniversary, etc. As for the food, I had the Omakase and every dish was great. ?Each dish was presented in an interesting way and it also tasted great. ?The atmosphere of the restaurant is very posh and the bathrooms are worth a visit. ?I would recommend this restaurant for those who want to try something more than just your average sushi roll.

You walk in and immediately notice the vastness of the place. ?With clean lines, and a spacious atmosphere, you notice the large wall of illuminated bottles in front of you. ?The layout, interior decor, and ambiance of this place is very chick and modern. ?Downstairs is a bar/lounge area where the restrooms are and wow, you have to go see for yourself. ?The service was great, the food was great (Omakase) and I would definitely go back again. A great place to go on a date! ?*****

Truly an unforgettable dining experience. My boyfriend ordered the omakase and I just had a 3 course meal (and helped myself to some of his food). The gyoza were delicious, with bacon foam, so strange. We got these cute little fried balls. No clue what was in them but they were so flavorful, I could have eaten a plate of them. Every plate (except the fried balls) was described in detail by our waitstaff (truly Iron Chef style). We got to try fugu (poisonous fish). There was some kind of egg custard soup that, in it's simplicity, was just so good.. My entrée was the surf and turf. ?The raw yellow tail was overly salty, but the Kobe beef made up for it. Now that was the best beef I have ever had. It cut like butter and had a crispy, spicy outside. It was cooked to perfection. Next time I go (y'know, once I become rich), Ill definitely fork over the $100 so I could have even more Kobe beef (I got the surf and turf only because it was significantly cheaper). My dessert was an apple something or another.. I really did enjoy it, however not as good at other pricey restaurants in the city. I would love to come back here again =(

Woahjeeze. This place was incredible. Came here today with my parents and had ourselves the pre fixe lunch. Pretty good service, cool waiter and a nice server. They also sat us about 20 minutes earlier than our initial reservation. Now for the food, I'll start with the appetizers. I had the miso soup and my parents had the salad. The tofu made the soup for me but it tasted average, minus about a tad bit of salt. The salad had a strange taste to it. It's the salad dressing I suppose, but it was good. Not my favorite though. For the main course my dad had the black cod, my mom had the angry chicken and I had the sushi-sashimi combo. Oh my god, the black cod was amazing - it was cooked perfectly. It had a sweet flavor, and a soft, buttery texture to it. Dad also ordered a soft-shell crab roll. It's jammed with stuff, but I've had better, to be honest. The Sushi/Sashimi was the best I've ever had. The order came with an assortment of sashimi and 8 rolls of yellowtail I think it was? I literally smiled when I took my first roll. It was just right - soft but not too soft, and not too fishy. Same with the sashimi, In-credible. As for the angry chicken? Don't order it. It wasn't bad, but spend on something else because this isn't worth $20. The dessert was adorable, but incredibly small (literally bite-sized). I don't remember exactly what they were but I know there was a teeny brownie cake for each of us, some sort of tangerine and whipped cream tart for each of us, and a palm full of these sweet jelly candies. I'm not really sure how to describe it, but they each had a pleasantly sweet taste. Outside of the food, the toilets were so cool! Heated rim and the have the whole "clean your butt" things there. The atmosphere was very lively too, and the decor was beautiful. The first thing you see when you walk in is a wall of what looks like glass. Well it is glass - glass bottles of water. Pretty cool, pretty cool. Now, I would have given this a 5 if it weren't for the fact that the main course portions were small. (At least for the Pre Fixe lunches. The regular dishes looked about average sized) Though I did relieve my appetite with all that sushi and sashimi, and I'm glad I didn't stuff myself silly (which was what I expected to do) you're paying for quality in this restaurant - not quantity.

The ultimate upsell experience!!!! ?I went to Morimoto with my sales rep and two clients. ?My waitress had us marked from the moment we walked in. ?She strongly suggested the $120 prix fix menu for all of us, and when we decided that 2 would have the prix fix and two would not, she told us that because the kitchen was sooooo busy we all needed to order the prix fix or none of is could!!! ?What??? ?So the sushi dinner two of us wanted was a no go.... ?Or was it???? ?Our thoughtful waitress insisted that to get the whole experience we should just keep the sushi order and treat it like an appetizer??? ?I didn't want to argue in front of our clients so after mildly protesting, I finally agreed. Fast forwarding....... The food was great from start to finish. $40 bottle of wine + dinner for 4 people = $ 825 Just really not worth the price! Del Posto across the street was just as good at 25% of the price.

So what are the chances that myself, a loyal delivery customer Sushi Lounge, a half-price sushi establishment on St. Marks (love ya, Sushi Lounge, never change), would find myself dining at not one, but TWO Japanese fine dining restaurants in two weeks? Shortly after my amazing business dinner at Geisha, my even more amazing boyfriend treated me to a surprise dinner at Morimoto, in an effort to cheer me up from a bad week and because I'm always nagging him about how we never go for Japanese. The food was definitely all that it was hyped up to be. ?We started out with the Morimoto sashimi platter and the gyoza. ?Both were interesting and delicious. ?The gyoza were served with a tomato sauce which was delightfully unexpected. For entrees, I got the braised cod and he got the sea bass. ?We both liked mine better than his, but both were great. ?We also shared a side of yummy chinese broccoli. Our server was friendly and knowledgeable and was able to steer us in the right direction, since neither of us had been before. So why not 5 stars? ?Sadly, I have to knock one off for my dessert. ?I ordered the strawberry cheesecake. ?I didn't really enjoy it. ?It came with a hibiscus gelee. ?Hibiscus seems to be a hot flavor right now - I've seen it pop up as a soda flavor at an old fashioned pharmacy, and as an agua fresca at a Mexican place, but I don't get it. ?It left me with an aftertaste like I had just eaten a bouquet of flowers. ?Also, the plating was really weird. ?I normally wouldn't care about something like this, but it seemed really out of place and not in the style of anything else in the restaurant. ?It was served in a cone-shaped glass sitting in a votive candle holder filled with glass beads and rose petals. ?It looked like something you would see as a centerpiece for a charity auction hosted at the local VFW hall.

I'm usually not a huge fan of high-end Japanese restaurants because I have the preconceived notion that decor will be sterile, service snooty, and food minuscule. Blame it on a bad one-time experience I had at a previous high-end Japanese restaurant whose name I won't reveal at the moment. Anyway, my friends and I were pleasantly surprised by our dinner experience at Morimoto. Yes, I purposely use the phrase "dinner experience" because thats exactly what it is, you take your time here, you savor the flavors, and you soak in the ambiance. ? As for the food, we got the famous toro tartare (colorful! tasty! 6 different flavors to dip your tartare in!), duck duck duck, lobster with red miso, and a few rolls. For dessert we had an interesting concoction made from tobacco, popcorn, creme, and caramel? Every dish was beautifully prepared, tasted fantastic, and we were given a brief summary on each by our lovely hostess who was extremely knowledgeable about the food. Everything about our dinner went perfectly--from friendly coatcheck staff, to our warm hostess, to the food, to the amazing decor. I need to make another excuse to come here again, having dinner at Morimoto is a really fantastic experience and worth the pricetag.

Well executed, but perhaps too familiar flavour profiles to my liking. The 7 course omakase was definitely worth trying at least once. ?The toro tartare was a fun and novel way to start, as you "scraped" the tartare off and dipped it into the various condiments available. ? I thought pairing the kampachi sashimi with plum sauce was delectable, although I could have done with the saltiness of the accompanying foam. ?It's also hard to complain when we were served a buttery tender cut of Wagyu beef alongside half a lobster. ?It was then that I realized what creme fraiche had been missing all along was a hint of lemon. I have to say, the sesame oil and ginger overtones dressing the fluke sashimi were, albeit delicious, too similar to the traditional way my family has always prepared steamed fish. ?Similar would be my sentiment towards the oyster sauce bathing the undeniably succulent combination of oyster, foie gras and uni. ?The quality of sushi was impeccable - but in the end, it's still sushi. ? Dessert was an overwhelmingly rich and encompassing chocolate tart, complete with dark chocolate ganache and chocolate sorbet. ?They did, however, offer us the option of substituting the dessert with any of the other available options on the menu. ?The soy milk cheese cake and souffle was medicore, but the green tea dessert was really memorable and unique - that would be the one I would try if I were to visit again. I have to say that I was a bit turned off by the "clubby" vibe of the restaurant, as I am personally not so accustomed to dining to the beat of a droning bass. ?But regardless, everything that was put out was well executed, delicious, but perhaps not so adventurous a step for someone familiar with traditional Asian flavour profiles.

I like the fact that you can be walking by Morimoto and you can actually come across Morimoto himself chilling outside his own restaurant. ? If you feel like enjoying a great meal and dropping a few bills, get the Omakase. ?It was a great experience. ? I went back a second time just for cocktails and desert.

My most memorable dining experience ever. Yes, EVER. My best friend and I had the Omakase menu along with the wine pairing. Everything was perfect. The presentation, service, ambiance, food.. gaawd, I think I died and went to heaven. Our dinner probably took a good three hours, but we loved every single minute of it. I don't think I'd ever had such excellent service before. The manager even offered us complimentary courses.. yea, with a kazillion courses, whats a couple more? ha. :) Sure, dinner cost over two bones each, but it was completely worth it. I mean, hello? It's been nearly seven months and we're STILL talking about it. I would do it all over again in a heart beat. I'm so glad to have shared this wonderful experience with my BFFIWWW (Yes Christina, I know you're reading this. LOL). If you're coming to just order a couple things, I'd definitely start with the tuna tartar, skip the beef. Oh, the restrooms are a bit tricky.. I remember wondering how the hell do I open the door.. All I saw was a metal bar on a wall. To push? pull? do a little dance? Say a magic word? What?! LOL..They also have fun bidets to play with! LOL p.s. Chef Morimoto was in the house and I was told they film iron chef just upstairs!! Too cool!!

Quick stop for lunch and sit at the bar alone. Unique experience to sit at the bar and follow the work of the cooks.

I have been dying to come to Morimoto for so-o long. I always had my eye on it for restaurant week, but knew it was lunch only. Finally, the perfect opportunity came up with my parents coming into town and working only 11 blocks away. I'm not sure how I never noticed Morimoto before, being that my second home is the Chelsea Market. Walking through the red curtains and into the sea of steel, gray, cold lines, it was kind of like I was leaving NYC all together... until I spied my favorite diners, most of whom I wanted to punch in the face because they were so "fabulous." Anyway, those super cool kids did not get us down. We each got different entrees off the RW menu - sashimi salad, sea bass and angry chicken. All were fantastic. ?They didn't skimp on the portions or the flavors for the lower priced menu. I didn't think I liked panna cotta, but Chef Morimoto's version was laced with coconut with a passionfruit gelee on top. Heaven. So light, I didn't even feel guilty for eating it! Minus one star because the toilets have three buttons. What the fuck?

I was sorely disappointed with this Morimoto location, having had an excellent experience at the Philadelphia location. THE BAD: The food lacked the typical Morimoto balance. The Spicy King Crab was too spicy, the Udon noodles too bland, and the Beef Carpaccio too salty. The service was poor. Delilah, our server, was unhelpful, jumped to conclusions, seemed distracted, and came off as rather condescending. THE SOMEWHAT GOOD: Have to give Morimoto points for dish presentation. The Morimoto Iced Tea is quite good if you are a fan of blueberries.

My second experience here has convinced me this place is a typical NYC restaurant - ridiculously expensive, over-hyped, and very very mediocre food - confusing trendiness and hipness for quality. In short, full of sound and fury signifying nothing. I went back here, expectantly, after being convinced that the last time I did not partake of the right aspects of this place. And I persuaded a group of friends to come along - promising them a great sushi experience. ?That is the last time anybody puts any faith in my recommendations .... :-/ So - this time we ordered the toro tartare, the whitefish carpaccio, the yosedofu, the sushi platter, and a couple of desserts. ?I can't say that the food was bad - it was good. But it was definitely not exceptional. And it was super-definitely not worth $400 .... The sushi was pretty much like the sushi at any decent restaurant - and the flavors of other items were what you'd expect from a run-of-the-mill Japanese place. You could have had the same underwhelming food anywhere else for less than 1/2 that price - and not have to put up with the tacky hipness of this place. And that's the problem - the absurd price to value ratio. Which is a very NYC thing, no doubt. Ergo, I'll only go back here after I become an investment banker and get a 3m dollar bonus for screwing over my investors.

I wanted to give this restaurant 5 stars, but there were a few nits that stopped me. ?This is a 4.5 star review. ? I've now been to both of the Morimoto restaurants, and for the most part, I liked the ambiance of the NYC restaurant more, and the food was a bit better at the Philadelphia location. ?Since food is more important, it gets a 4.5 star review. The food here is excellent, but I noticed that a few dishes seemed to be over sauced, and it caused what could be a wonderfully elegant dish to become heavy, and taste a little like fast food. ?The fact that kobe beef was actually left on my plate because it tasted too much like teriyaki sauce felt like a travesty, but it was just too much sauce for it's own good. What was amazing here? ?The sushi! ?The fish quality was excellent, even on a Sunday, and the ratio of meat to rice was wonderful. ?The rice wasn't quite as perfect as the rice at the Philadelphia establishment, but ranking an 11 vs. a 10 is really just piddly talk. ?The matsutake and uni combination nigiri made my knees weak, as did the big eyed snapper with lime and masago and the otoro with jalapeno. ?The Toro tartare was also divine. ?Anything with fresh wasabi pretty much is divine by default. ?Also, the apricot sorbet that was in the desert and the azuki bean macaroon was perfect too. ?A sashimi crudo served with hot olive oil to slightly sear the fish was elegant, and not in the least bit oily. Service at the establishment was very good. The people were very friendly and polite, though I am always bothered by the dishes being served with English names before the Japanese ones are given. Sometimes, I understand what the Japanese name means more than the English translation. ? The bathrooms are magical. ?I have NEVER said this about a bathroom before, but they have TOTO toilets. They are warmed, and have water jets and air drying. ?Please, find a reason to use the bathroom!

One of the best meals of my life, I will be back! ?Asian Fusion, but staying very traditional. I made reservations here several weeks in advance on open table and was able to land a table for a friday night. ?I could see Morimoto working in the kitchen as the sushi prep area is open. ?The only thing that could have made the evening better is if Morimoto would have stopped by! The food: I had the tasting menu which is 7 courses for $120. ? It is a reasonable amount of food for the price. ?Every dish I had, I enjoyed. ?This was my favorite tasting menu I have experienced. ? (I upgraded to the 'Saga' Japanese beef for $50 extra. ? The beef was very good, but not sure it was worth the extra 50.) In addition to the tasting menu, the following appetizers were recommended by our server and the recommendations were spot on: -Spicy King Crab - spicy mayo with roe sauce coating king crab legs that have been cracked for easy eating -Wagyu Beef Carpaccio The service: Service was flawless(friendly, prompt, well timed) and what you would expect for this class of restaurant. ? Decor is trendy and upscale. ? Seats are actually comfortable which was a pleasant surprise.

All I can say is WOW! Not to mention the fact that I actually met Chef Morimoto this meal was spectacular. ?Expensive?....Yes, but worth every penny. ?If you can afford it, this is the place to try. ?Our experience was great, from the moment we sat down till the moment we left, everything was perfect. I had the tasting menu, my date had sushi and of course, picked off my plate(s). ?The $165 bottle of Sake was the best I have ever had...and I fancy myself a wine connoisseur (Sake IS wine, instead of grapes they use rice and the production process is more like beer than wine). ?It tasted just as it was described by our VERY knowledgeable server. Even though we sat down 45 minutes late (It is New York), I still recommend this place to anyone and everyone. ? Oh yea, we also saw "Vince" from the HBO show Entourage.

Restaurant Week last winter. Ordered the fish sandwich: I was very very very disappointed. The fish sandwich tastes better at McDs! Beef terriyaki bowl: described in other words on the menu-- however, that's basically what it was! Except, there were way too many onions and the beef was dry with an excessive amount of rice and scarcely any beef. I'd opt for Yoshinoya's beef bowl over this any day. The atmosphere of this restaurant was very hip and SATC-- even the restroom was impressive! However, based upon the food served during the Restaurant Week lunch menu-- I'm never coming back (unless it's for a work dinner).

I am debating between 3 and 4 star, but decided on the lower grade for two non-food related reasons. 1) upstairs bathroom was simply filthy 2) the hostess failed to find a working power outlet anywhere in the restaurant to charge my blackberry! The restaurant is very nicely decorated, wavy wall and ceiling. I like this one more than the original in Philly. Food was mostly good, Our group was a mix in terms of sushi expertise, so the very nice waitress picked a good combination for us to share. Toro Tartar is interesting, but kind of bland, Scallop special with pea shoot was excellent, Uni sushi was very fresh and tasty, steamed chicken was horrible, well, just like rubber, whitefish capaccio is ok (but I only remember the greens), roast pork with Chinese congee is a very tasty combo, grilled cod was wonderful, highlight of the meal, We also had a few sushi rolls, not bad, but nothing to write home about Dessert was very pretty. Interesting combination of flavor. I don't quite like wasabi raspberry sorbet flavor though. Chocolate cake with popcorn topping is so good, we left no crumb behind. The macaron dish comes in 6 pretty colorful imitations that are good to eyes only. Iron Chef Morimoto was himself in the store, busy behind the sushi bar. There must be some VIP customers today.

Morimoto has made a name for himself from Iron Chef to Nobu. ?He is incredibly talented that's for sure. ?Morimoto is definitely a place to try despite of the $$$ factor. ? Dress Code: ?Women - a nice dress or sexy outfit. ?Did see some girls wearing short short skirts and high high heels. ?Biz casual if you cannot think of anything else to wear. ? Men: a nice designer jeans w/ nice shirt; nice pants w/ nice shirt; or pants suits. No ties needed. ?It is Chelsea, so its kind of chic casual. ?Do Wear something nice. Don't look like a bum. We were greeted by friendly staff and were seated in the front section of the restaurant. ?We had the view of the entire restaurant. ?The decor was modern and "white." ?In the middle of the room there was a large class light installation. ?I felt like we were inside of a space ship. ?It was pretty cool. Our waiter helped us with our orders. ?We had the Toro Tartare; Raw Oysters; Gyozas; Sizzling Beef; Greens on top of sashimi; Rock Shrimps; and dessert c coffee. ?That may not sound like a lot of food, but we were very full. ?The rock shrimps were extremely creamy so it was quite filling. ?Be sure of pace yourself if you do order that. ?I almost did not have space for dessert. ? And I MUST have my dessert! ?Desserts are like pretty ribbons that tied everything together. ?I had the berry gelato accompany with fresh berries on top of a thinly sliced light texture cake. ?It was refreshing and delicious. The food is pricey so be prepared to dig deep into your pocket. ?But Morimoto is like London or Paris, its one those places that you have go and try at least once. ?The quality of the food was excellent and the dishes were beautifully plated. They were like mini artworks. The bar located downstairs and its separate from the rest of the restaurant. ?This is an excellent idea because the bar area can create their own atmosphere by pumping up their music and not have to worry about being too loud. Restrooms were modern and zen like. ?Be sure to "SLIDE" the restroom door to open. Enjoy!

On the presentation of the food and for the bathrooms, Morimoto deserves 5 stars! Where else would I try fugu? ?Seriously, wouldn't you try fugu at a place like this instead of a hole in the wall? ?(Our logic - if it is really fugu then this place wouldn't risk it's reputation on a bad cut.) ?We had fugu three ways and it's interesting. Nothing to write home about. ?Then again, since fugu isn't usually on the menu at the places I go to I really don't know if it was fugu at all. ?But it was definitely a fish I hadn't had before. ?It was good but I'm also happy with toro and kampachi and the like. We also ordered the sashimi appetizer. ?Square cut stack of fish served with 5 dipping sauces. ?The sauces come in small dropper like dispensing tubes. ?That was fun. The Seabass. ?Oh the Seabass! ?Really good. Two desserts, the creme brulee and the hazelnut something or other. ?i'm usually not a dessert person but these were damn good. ?The hazelnut thing was better than the creme brulee (just in case you only have room for one). Now the bathrooms...I don't want to ruin the experience for anyone so I'll just say that you should check it out whether you have to use it or not. Enjoy!

As non-affordable as it was for a recent but still poor graduate, I can't deny how good and innovative the food at Morimoto was for me. The space, designed by famous Japanese architect Tatao Ando, is eye-catching. ?However, the eating area is quite packed, and I was 'forced' to listen to conversations of the nearby diners, which wasn't exactly what I wanted to hear during my great dining experience. Ok, price and packed space taken aside, the food was fantastic (just saying again if you didn't catch it the first time...). ?We started with octopus sashimi--it was prepared so fresh and nicely--just the way I like my seafood! ?Then we got The Zen Sai aka Five Japanese Antipasti: a pickled daikon, wagyu beef wrapped in zucchini, salmon roe, soft-shelled crabs on endives, and some white fish. ?The beef and the crab were hits for me and didn't care for the fish (it's ok, Mr. Morimoto...I've seen your work on Iron Chef...I'll let the fish dish go). For entree, I got the curried salmon ravioli (I guess he focused on the Japanese/Italian fusion concept?), and I must admit that I have never tasted something like that before. ?The ravioli was covered with a yuzu gelee, and it was really fun eating it. ?My friend got the trout, which was good, but even he admitted that my entree was better. ?Go me for good taste! :-D In case you wonder if I'm a splurger, then let it be reveal that I am not as it was a birthday dinner for me (age will not be disclosed here). ?Our server, who was amazing and energetic serving us, got us 2 desserts with the one extra because I didn't get a candle on the first one (awww, how sweet!). ? It was a peach/creme dish, which was fine. ?The other one was a unusual panna cotta of some sort, and that was more of an acquired taste (again, nice try...). Yes, it will be expensive regardless of how little or small you order, but at least you will go out of the restaurant knowing that you are most likely not going to find the same dishes anywhere else in the city.

There is definitely a scene here but that is typical of any meatpacking/ chelsea restaurant. We ate very late, after seeing a show so we sat downstairs in the lounge. ?The food was great but our waitress was terrible. ?We ordered a hot sake that was waiting at the bar for over 10 minutes before we had to ask someone else to bring it to us. ? As for food, we had a few rolls and sushi, along with the Mexican pizza and the morimoto special which was 7 layers of raw fish with 5 sauces in little test tubes. ?It was all very good. I would go back but there are other sushi spots I would go to before returning here. ?I think it would have to be a convenience/location thing.

THE BEST SUSHI EXPERIENCE IN NYC....AND MAYBE THE EAST COAST We always spend a lot of money here and never feel like we didn't walk away the winners! ?The service, ?food and dining experience at MORIMOTO is top notch. ? Oysters the size of baseballs...on steroids?? HUGE! The vegan sushi selections fo myself were plentiful....the salad is too good to be called a green mixed salad.... The sake is great...the dessrts are beautiful ...and the vibe is VIBE-LICIOUS! ?Lots of very classy people enjoying a well deserved night out--so it seems. Great date spot, ?although its brighter than most rest....but hey I want to be able to see my lovely sushi masterpieces!

I love everything about this place would eat here all the time if i could! the decor is great, service is great, drinks are awesome, and the food.. oh, the food.. everything from start to finish was inventive and delicious. Lots of unusual stuff on the menu, everything tasted great. The spicy king crab was INcredible and the calamari salad was addictive(really, i couldnt put my chopsticks down! my boyfriend had to stop me from picking at every last scrap in the bowl) I had the sea bas with eggplant and miso. It was perfect. boyfriend ordered the surf n turf the hamachi ribbons melt in your moth and the avacado relish is like something dropped down from heaven. we had the chocolate ganache with sesame for desert and it was more than orgasmic. mmmm... i didnt have room but ate it anyway.

I will be honest, I am a loyal Stephen Starr follower. I grew up in Philadelphia. I used to frequent the Morimoto in PHL, the NYC is great too. It can't compare to the Morimoto PHL but only because I ONCE SAT NEXT TO VANILLA ICE. Yes, you read that right. I will give autographs for a price. Anyway, this Morimoto is amazeballs as well.... For lunch, do the sushi tasting menu and have a cocktail or two from their signature cocktail list. Then, spend the rest of the afternoon trying to avoid your boss because you are a drunk mess. you're welcome.

Dinner here was fun, comfortable and trendy all at the same time. Our server was smart, gorgeous and made decision-making easy. What we had... Waaaaay too much sake and White Lily cocktails Toro Tartar: A delight to eat with so many combinations of flavors. Get one all to yourself! Oyster Foie Gras: Velvety and luxurious. Whitefish & Octopus Carpaccio: Light, clean and fresh tasting Crispy Rock Shrimp Tempura: Forgettable. It wasn't crispy at all but came with housemade ranch dressing which was meant for the non-existent spicy shrimp tempura.. I don't touch ranch dressing but this version was smooth. Chicken Ramen Soup: Ridiculously good. Seafood Toban Yaki: Really special. Very comforting and bursing with flavor Warm Chocolate Cake: Just get it! I can't get enough of the bathroom stalls and seeing the always uber-tanned Morimoto.

I really wanted to love this place. Really. I tried to love it. OK - positives: food was good. Didn't blow my mind like I thought it would (Hooray for ridiculously high expectations!) but it was fine. A-OK. Ambiance was fabulous. Really over-the-top. Loved it. Must drink: White Lilly Onto the bad stuff: Our waiter was rude and "hurried" like he had somewhere to be and we were keeping him from getting there. We were seated at a table that, honestly, shouldn't have been a table. It was near an emergency exit door and security kept coming in and out of it - it was January on a windy night with a wind chill in the NEGATIVES. Because the door kept opening, we (very politely, considering the situation) requested to have our coats brought back to us from the coat check. They brought us the coats, but kept letting security come in out of the emergency exit door. We all ordered soup (which was good!) just to warm us up a bit. Yes. It was that bad. In the restaurant's defense: we did not have reservations. We came in for drinks at the bar downstairs and decided to grab a bite to eat in the dining room upstairs. I believe it's because of the lack-of-reservations that we were given the less-desirable table by the exit. Also, if we weren't freezing and our waiter wasn't having a bad day, we ?would have had a MUCH different experience. The food might have even tasted better if we were happy... or at least warm... So, that said, my experience was A-OK. I seriously would like to go back and give it another try for dinner. I would make reservations this time. On the plus side, this place is fantastic for drinks. Maybe I'd eat by the bar next time?

Went here for a colleague's going-away dinner, and I was pleasantly surprised. Supposedly, this was another one of my colleague's favorite places in New York. The ambiance is amazing- it is really a beautiful space. I would also say that the food is great- albeit there are smaller portions (I have this thing against little food) but Morimoto definitely surpasses your "average" japanese restaurant! They also had delicious drinks-we all had these cucumber mojito-type drinks that were fantastic! My co-workers had some gripes about the price (it is a little on the pricey side), but all agreed that it was definitely a good choice for a special event.

Oh Morimoto San, what a disappointing dining experience at your lovely restaurant! ?After a wonderful experience at the Philadelphia location, I was very excited to find Morimoto's in NYC on a recent trip. I showed up promptly at 5:30 for my reservation. ?The hostess seemed surprised when I said it was table for one. As the staff were just ending the pre-opening meeting, I was asked to wait a few minutes. A group of 5 women walked, and they were immediately seated. I waited for someone to come get me, but after a few minutes of waiting, I walked up and asked to be seated. ?At this point the hostess appeared confused about where to seat me, I told her I can sit at the sushi bar as I planned to order mainly sushi. As I sat in my corner seat near the back service area, I watched them walk by without looking at me for a full 10 minutes. Other guests were seated and their water glasses filled. Yet no one stopped by me to offer a drink or water! Finally I had to stop one of the servers walking by who got another person to come by with water and take my order. ? The Morimoto sashimi plate was very good, nice presentation and tasted wonderful, though potions were tiny. The server informed me that one of the piece of fish was wrapped in shiso, also known as Japanese cilantro! REALLY???? ?Shiso is from the perilla family and is no way related to cilantro. When I questioned the server he replied quite haughtily that it is a fact. I know my Japanese food and was not impress with this incorrect information and the attitude of the server. The oysters with uni and foie gras, swimming in quite a bit of sauce that tasted like Chinese Oyster sauce. Not impressed! ?The last portion of the meal consists of a salmon skin roll ( very good), scallop sandwich between sliced cucumber and one piece of hirame. ?I was surprise at that solo piece pf fish ($5!!) ?The scallops were fresh and plump. My bill came to $85! ?Not impressed at all. For that I expected better quality food. ?As for the server, he never came back to check on me. ?The young man that cleared my plate and fill my water glass was the only pleasant interaction i had the entire evening. ?I left a tip only because of his service and nice smiles, and sincere inquires about my meal. As I was walking out, I said good night to the hostess, I was almost out the door before she responded with a cool "Bye". ?I am sorry but I will not recommend this place or return. Rather have a meal at McDonald's.

This was the most amazing night of my life. ?Morimoto defines savory food. ?The portions were just right, and the flavors were unimaginable. ? It is pretty sad that for the better part of my life I didn't know one could even taste such things. ?This place opened my mind and my world up to amazing tastes. ?I don't think Morimoto will ever be emulated. ?I could only pray that everyone experience his art. The night I was visiting his restaurant, the honorable Morimoto was cooking. ?I was able to meet him, shake his hand, get a picture with him, and his autograph on his bottle of beer. ?I was floored!

Everything and I mean everything here was exceptionally good! ?For starters, we tried Toro Tartare, Foie Gras Chawan Mushi, Spicy King Crab, and a special but I don't remember the name. DEFINITELY TRY THE TORO TARTARE AND FOIE GRAS!! ?You will not regret it! For the main course, we had the sea bass and various sushi/sashimi combinations. The sea bass was also very good, light and perfectly flavored.

When we arrived we couldn't find this place! We saw the sign, but it was tricky because the doors were hidden behind this red curtain. Finally we got seated and what was most memorable for me was of course the food, but you gotta check out the bathroom! After reading many reviews about it, I decided to go and man, i was blown away! I had to go back just to get my phone so i could take a pic of it...crazy toilet and i've never seen anything like it! It even had a dryer! LOL. Okay so the food, we got the rock shrimp tempura, wow that portion was huge! I felt bad because we wanted to finish everything, but we also got the tuna tartare and the octapus carpaccio to start...plus sushi, drinks and our main course so it was a little overwhelming. The octapus and tartare were superb! I think my favorite were the rolls! The spider roll was TO DIE FOR! I got the duck duck duck, and being a duck lover that dish was fantastic. Presentation of the dish and everything about it was great. We also got some apple cinnamon icecream dish for desert and it was okay, i love ice cream and i love cinnamon and with the apple it was pretty good. I got the white lily for my drink and that was damn good. What was nice was that the waiter noticed my husband didn't finish his alcoholic drink, so they comped it for him. WOW that was nice we though and great service very attentive. All the waiters/waitresses were super tall! We had a great view of the kitchen from our seats too, oh and btw the seats were super comfy, sometimes I dislike it when chairs are uncomfortable at a place where you are going to be spending a few hours at...so my stomach and glutes were very happy =)

Morimoto's is somewhat of a mysterious place. The entrance may be grand with flowing red curtains (think Moulin Rouge theater curtains with a Japanese flair) but there is no large type overhead saying "Morimoto's." You have to look off to the left side of the entrance, several inches above the ground to see the chef's name in red logotype. You enter the automatic sliding doors like boarding the Enterprise and are welcomed by young, model-looking greeters by the desk. Beautiful men and women make me feel very uneasy because I feel like I'm in Gattaca and I feel unclean and of poor breed. I'm sure they're looking at me with their "You're not worthy of Uma Thurman" gaze. "Hello sir, do you have a reservation with us?" asked by an Armani-model/maitre d. "Yes, I do." "Party of three sir? Very good. You are the first to arrive so you are welcome to have a drink at our bar which is located below, just down these stairs. We'll direct your friends downstairs when they arrive." A lovely hostess, who might as well of been Adriana Lima's younger sister, showed me the stairs to the electric blue-lit glass bar. I was amazed by the bar itself, completely made of glass or lucite or some clear s*** with floating leaves etched inside the solid block. I knew that with my suit, I needed a martini (damnit Casino Royale! I hate when awesome movies influence my life decisions!) so I ordered a Morimotini. As you can guess everything here has been Morimotified up the a** so please refrain from smirking when I make some Morimotisms in the next couple paragraphs. Anyway, the Morimotini is a mixture of wasabi-infused vodka and sake. How badass is that? Well as martinis go it was pretty good. Worth the $14? Probably not, but hey. When in Rome... Once my friends arrived we were ready for gastronomic battle. The super upbeat Asian waitress was very eager to answer any of our questions and described the variety of awesome shit on the menu. The three of us ended up choosing the "Morimoto Omakase," which was the chef's choice of seven course tastings, allowing you to experience a wide array of flavors. The night started with a tuna tartar, presented on a small plank of wood with caviar, creme fraiche, wasabi, dashi-soy, chives, guacomole, and tiny crackers. It was interesting because you have to use this chisel-shaped spoon to scrape the tuna off the board. It was a strange experience thinking of carpentry and painting skills while eating tuna, but hey it tasted good. Next up was a whitefish carpaccio with cherry tomatoes and a soy sauce-infused olive oil. What? Soy sauce-infused olive oil? Can I just buy that s*** in a bottle and pour it into my gullet?! I want more! Third course was yellowtail medallions in salsa and greens. Crunchy, sea salty skin was the epic win of this dish. Fourth course was...ahem, let me put on my distinguished, snooty British-voice: "Oyster foie gras. A delightful dish consisting of top of the line market oyster, foie gras, uni and a refined teriyaki sauce." Did anybody else get a food boner after reading that? Fifth dish was a series of chef selected sushi, which was a combination of tuna, red snapper, mackerel, bass, and eel. Is that a lime slice garnish on that piece of fish? Is red snapper the Coronas of Japanese sushi? Sixth dish was a refresher to cleanse the palate. This shot was a fruity, frothy, spicy concoction. Think of cranberry juice, brandy, and peppers mixed in together. It was like a shot of Christmas. Seventh dish was the main course: surf and turf. This was a gorgeous spicy half lobster and a side of flank steak. Lobster has to be the least sexy meal to have. I felt like Daryl Hannah in that lobster eating scene in Splash. "She's really hungry" as Tom Hanks would say while I devoured the crustacean like a Mori-mo-fo. And finally the last dish, the 8th course of the meal: dessert. This consisted of a powdered sugar cake with a mango sorbet and caramelized apples. There was this ridiculous marshmallow smear coating at the bottom of the plate which was impossible to scrape and add to the sorbet. Maybe it was there for show? Maybe you were only supposed to get subtle hints of marshmallow? And thus concluded our evening at Morimoto's. The chipper waitress handed us our check which ended up being about $500 then with a 20% tip, the night pretty much rounded to about $200 each person. It was the Taco Bell dollar menu from here on out.

I enjoyed dining here, but the food seemed more expensive than it was worth. ?$7 for an extra bowl of rice? ?Are you kidding me? ?Maybe someday when I have a fat bank account and too much money to spend, I'll revisit Morimoto and try the $120/person chef's tasting menu. On another note, I was thoroughly impressed with their bathrooms. ?Crouching down on the toilet, I was bracing myself for cold porcelain but was pleasantly surprised and pleased to find my butt resting on a heated toilet seat. ?Yay for Japanese toilet technology!

I actually cried and giggled at ?the same time over one amazing bite!!!! Then it happened again and again. The food is love and sex and happiness and beauty. We had the tasting menu, 7 dishes some of which if you watch Iron Chef religiously like we do you will recognize. I would love to go through and describe each dish in delicious detail, but I will only fail at expressing how fabulous it was and likely get the details wrong, as my head was swimming ?and remembering the well stated descriptions of each dish would be impossible. It was amazing. I want to eat there again and soon. Did I mention that he has his own sake? Yes, his own amazing sakes, as well as aged sake. I tried the 5 year and it is a whole new thing. Like the brandy version of sake, only nothing like brandy. Smokey, caramel and spiced. The famed Iron Chef Morimoto's signature restaurant is a must for any serious lover of Japanese food, great food, fabulous dining experiences or really just anyone with the sense enough to find the best of the best. It is the best of the best!!! The space is lovely, the service is impeccable, it is fun, romantic, and sexy.

I was pretty excited to go to Morimoto's. I'm kind of an Iron Chef geek, and his food looks so amazing on t.v. Unfortunately, we were a bit disappointed. The food was good, but nothing spectacular. I've actually had better Japanese in other "no name" restaurants. I'm glad I went, because I was very curious about it. But, I wouldn't return. ***I'll still be watching Morimoto via Iron Chef. I think he's an amazing chef, it just didn't shine through at his restaurant.

Service: 10/10 Appetizers: 10/10 Sushi: 9/10 Dessert: 9/10 The place has a very stylish design, and the bathrooms were very elegant. ?THe best part was seeing chef morimoto work the sushi bar and greeet us. We started with Oysters Foie Gras, which were the best tasting oysters i've ever had. ?It was marinated in a teriyaki sauce and toped with a piece of seared eel. ?We also tried one of the chefs special appetizers. ?It was a lobster salad served chilled on ice. ?The lobster chunks were served on a bed of freshly cooked wasabi noodles, and the sauce was ?lemongrass based. ?It was the perfect ombination of the wasabi noodles with the lobster salad. The Sushi was superb, I have tried many sushi places and the quality of the fish here was excellent. ?My favorite was the toro and amberjack. ?The toro almost melts in your mouth, there was no comparison to any other fish. ?We tried the kobe steak sushi, which wasnt as appealing as I imagined. ?It tasted like mackerel, little dry on the meat, but it was something different. ? ?We tried a variety of sushi and rolls, and all were very satisfying. ? For Dessert I had a tofu cheesecake, which was awesome. ?It was light yet very rich in flavor. ?My friend had a creme brulee, which was also good. ?We tried on of Morimoto's signature sake, which was excellent and went well with the sushi. I recommend sitting on the sushi bar for a front view of chef morimoto in action. ?The sushi was a bit expensive, remember they charge you by piece. ?The staff was very attentative and friendly, and they even convinced morimoto to come out and take a picture with my friend and I. ? Overall the atmosphere was stylish and elegant, food was excellent, service was great, and bathrooms are COOL. ?The price is a bit steep but definitely worth the money, at least once in your lifetime.

Morimoto is my favorite Food Network star, hands down. ?So when I visited the Philly location a few years ago and missed the man himself, I was thoroughly disappointed and vowed to come back at a later time. Well all these years passed and I never found time to goto Philly again so thank goodness he opened a NY location. It was our wedding anniversary so we thought, why not splurge? Morimoto is located in the Meat Packing district... but even within this area, it is far off from civilization. ?There are warehouses and empty streets and to be honest, quite a dreary area during the wintertime. We had no problems finding free parking on a Saturday night. ?There are two lots very close by for the ones that are lazy. We walked in, and it looked like any overdone restaurant. ?I did not like the decor very much; I was expecting a more Tokyo feel but all I got was posh, NYC restaurant. We were seated promptly even though our reservation time had passed 15 minutes ago. ?Tables are small, especially if you have a party of two. Hubby was going to order the omakase, while I planned on ordering an appetizer and and entree so we could share; I didn't feel the need for both of us to order omakases since they would be the same food. ?The waiter was quick to point out that omakases must be ordered for the whole party :( ?I was disappointed but obliged. ?I quickly asked him if HE was here today... and to my surprise, he said "Yes, I think I saw him around... I will see if he can come by..." I was excited beyond belief. ?The man himself was available! Our first course came. ?Toro tartare. ?The best toro tartare I have ever had in my life. ?Presented beautifully, as was Morimoto's style. ?While I was gazing in awe at my plate, Morimoto heads straight for our table. ?My jaw dropped and eyes widened... hubby looked at me like I was losing it and then turned around. He shook our hands and said a pleasant hello and took a picture with us. ?He is much less intimidating in person, with a gentle mannerism, which I had expected. ?He was rumored to be an extremely nice person and from our brief exchange, he was all that and more. ?(Thank you for making my night Morimoto-san!) After that, I could barely wipe the grin off my face to enjoy the rest of my meal. In our omakase, there was foie gras, raw oyster, sushi, some kind of carpaccio, lobster and wagyu. ?There might have been something else I missed but each dish was presented beautifully. ?However, there was definitely lacking in the taste department for some things (ie: the wagyu wasn't to my liking and some of the sushi pieces were too chewy). When dessert came around, they also present us with a small platter with Happy Anniversary scrawled on it (I'd like to think that HE did it himself... hehehe) All in all, a worthwhile experience for our $330+ meal. ?Would come here again, but maybe not for omakase anymore.

Morimoto is definitely just hype. ?If you have wad of cash burning in your pocket, this would be a definite investment on your palette. ?It's definitely okay to splurge once in a while. ?Otherwise, if you are like me and enjoy good food at reasonable prices, Morimoto might not be it. ? During their restaurant week, I had the salad, black cod, and tofu soy milk dessert (not on the restaurant week menu). ?I can understand the other items to be small, but even the full priced dessert was small as heck. ?After lunch, I grabbed a cheeseburger from good old reliable, McD's. ?Morimoto, NYC gals love to eat! ?We aren't all toothpicks that split salads and 1 piece of M&M. The cod was decent, but I think next time I'll stick to my favorite, Yamas.

Had a really superb dinner the other night at Morimoto. ?The space itself if very interesting and cool, though I honestly prefer the layout of the Philly version better. ?Lots of concrete, glass, dividers carves the space into a series of intimate dining spaces. ?We settled into a table elbow to elbow with patrons on either side. ?There is a very cool bar downstairs as well, a good place to await the preparation of your table. We stuck to traditional sushi dishes, and the salmon sushi was simply the best version I have ever had of this staple - crisp, fatty, luscious, mmmmm. We also had a soft crab roll, which was fun to eat with huge claw crabs poking out of the top; a solid california roll, and a spicy yellowtail roll. All were very good, nothing out of this world creative, but we weren't in that sort of mood. ?Next time I definitely want to try some of the original entrees, all of which sounded superb. ?Mr. Morimoto himself was working the door, so that was an added flash of celebrity chef fun.

We went here for Valentine's Day dinner and were worried that with the recession they would try to push some expensive horrible pre-fixe menu onto everyone (hey, it's happened to us before in NYC on holidays). ?But I shouldn't have worried - the service and quality were as high as on my other visits. ? We had the blow-fish special which was arranged in the shape of hearts as well as having the $75 Chef's selection sushi entree. ?All was delicious (well I'm not sure I'm a blow-fish fan, but the ponzu sauce was amazingly good).

I just dined at Morimoto last night for my birthday...and I am a huge "Iron Chef" fan, so I was extremely excited, but I couldn't have been more disappointed... Mediocre food at super high prices. I knew the prices were high, but I assumed the food would be much better...and it was just good, but not great. I decided to split a few dishes with my boyfriend, while my parents and sister + her boyfriend ordered other things, so we could all try a bit of everything! Started with the Toro Tartar, which other Yelpers rave about, was tasty, but the portion was so small--and for 30 bucks!?! I thought it was outrageous. It wasn't like it was anything sooo special, anyway. Then, had the Beef Carpaccio, which was also nothing special. It was good, but again, not anything remarkable. For our main course, we had the Ishi Yaki Bop, which they cook in front of you. It was very tasty. ?A bowl of rice, with vegetables, like mushrooms, and then an egg mixed in with Yellowtail. It was very good... my boyfriend and I liked it very much. However, I've ordered a very similar dish at Korean restaurants and it's been just as good-perhaps tastier,even...and less expensive. My mother ordered the Duck Duck Duck, which I sampled, and also thought was simply run of the mill. My sister had a ramen noodle soup, which I did not try, but she said it was quite good. My father had a fish dish, which he also said was very good. The service was decent-nothing outstanding-but nothing terrible. The 6 of us agreed that you pay for the beautiful decor at this chic & trendy Meatpicking district hideaway...You pay for the name Morimoto...not the food...The food is sub-par. Go to Japan to eat---I promise you, the food's much better at any hole in the wall you'll find down a Tokyo or Osaka alley than this overpriced superficial crap. ?If only Morimoto had actually cooked everything, then perhaps, it would have been a different story........... hands down, THE MOST EXCITING AND AWESOME PART OF THIS RESTAURANT WAS THE BATHROOM--because they have high tech, Japanese style toilets like the ones all across Japan that I miss terribly!

I've been here twice - once where I was the client and therefore got to eat like a pig on someone elses' dime and another time with my family. The first time I went I got the Omakase which is basically like gambling with your dinner since you don't know what you're going to get. I think its like 7 courses of the chef's selection. Honestly, was a little nervous about this since I don't eat octopus and certain things but when everything came out, it was delicious. Half the time, I had no idea what I was eating but it didnt' really matter since the presentation was to die for and the food was sooo good. The second time I went I had the congee with this aged pork on it that was so tender it crumbled under my fork. So good. For my entree I had the surf and turf which was a yellowtail with cherry tomatoes and avocado and this waygu beef that was cooked perfectly. The desert was a chocolate ganache with white sesame ice cream and black sesame ash around it. That was FOR SURE my favorite thing. I want a big bag of the black sesame ash to sprinkle around everything I will eat in the future. Definitely recommended - the service is spot on and the restaurant is impressive. If you took a chick here, you would not only look like a foodie, but adventurous.

Filled with beautiful people Saturday night (fashion week?), was promptly seated in the minimalist lounge downstairs (though the high bar stool was completely uncomfortable for a "nice" sit down dinner), but the food absolutely made up for it. ?I had a difficult time deciding between the duck, duck, duck entree and the seafood "toban yaki", I guess I'll have to go back again for other dish! ?I started the meal with oysters topped with foie gras and sea urchin... I knew tonight was going to be a good night. +.5 star for the knowledgeable courteous waitress, no-fuss seating (we didn't have a reservation), and trendy decor -.5 star for uncomfortable chairs, I could lean back and tip over +2 stars for lamb carpaccio - loved the scallion-ginger dressing/ topping +1 star for melt-in-your-mouth wagyu filet, and the red miso-sake broth that accompanied seafood entree +.5 star for the infinity glass in the bathroom stall and the many buttons for the toilet +.5 for sitting right by Chef Morimoto having drinks with visiting guests.

I've been told the toilet shoots water at you when you're done doing your business, but unfortunately for me, I pee standing up, so I wouldn't know. ?This is borderline trickery as I'm not sure how I would react if I were to sit and experience this. But..... Enough of my dilly dally jibberish. ? Yeah, the decor is fancy spancy and very futuristic, but the star of this place is the food. ?It is simply orgasmic. ?They prolly kill the fish on the spot because I've never tasted fresher sushi before. ?The drinks were great, and there's a good selection of saki. ?- when in Rome ;). ?I came celebrating my sister's marriage and we all left more than satisfied. ? Warning - Morimoto will spoil you and dining anywhere else will never be the same. ?Now, I have to go back to collecting soda cans so I can afford to dine here again ;)

The good. ?Trendy, modern, and cool design/architecture, albeit somewhat concretey. ?That is, good amount exposed concrete. ?The service was professional and courteous. ?But one should expect nothing less for the prices they charged. ?Still, competent service. ?Lastly, Morimoto san was kind enough to allow my sister and I to take a picture with him. ?He was a gracious host and played the role of celebrity chef quite well. ?He was engaged with his customers. The bad. ?Simply, the food. ?Save for the tuna pizza and the king crab appetizers, the remainder was disappointing. ?Do not, I repeat, do not get the rock shrimp tempura or the oyster foie gras appetizers. ?Not only did they taste funny, but two members of our party became sick later that evening. ?We cannot attribute which of the two appetizers caused the violent reactions, but stay away from both. ?For my entree, I had the miso black cod. ?It tasted like Chinese food. ?Other members of our party stated that their fish entrees- halibut, sea bass, and trout- tasted like Chinese food. ?Mind you, this is not a compliment for a Japanese restaurant. Granted, Morimoto san is well known to be a fusion master. ?But at least execution wise, the meal fell way short of its original intent. ?If you want Asian fusion done right, then go to any of David Chang's Momofuku restaurants. ?Much better there. ?And if you are seeking an authentic Japanese experience, then go to EN. ?Also, much better there. The ugly. ?The bill. ?OMG, face in palm. ?The five of us were there for a special birthday but even so, the bill was unkind. ?Expect to drop a few C notes.

I'm erring on the side of generous with the rating here because we came for lunch during Restaurant Week. ? Ambiance - 4.5 stars Service - 3 stars Food - RW menu, 2.5 stars; Other things, 5 stars Price - Hefty Food breakdown: RW menu... Appetizer: Oysters were so-so. ?One was excellent., one was WAY too big which made it super fishy and the last one was good, not great. Main Course: Sashimi salad was okay but I was pretty darn skeeved that there was a thick skin on top of the dressing that came on the side. ?Come on guys...I know its RW but this is Morimoto. ? Dessert: Good. ?Tasty panna cota cup that reminded me of cake batter. I also tasted the crab fritter appetizer which was amazing and the beef bowl which was just okay as well. ? The highlight of lunch was the toro we ordered in addition to the meal. ?The hamachi was quite good too. ?Salmon sushi was a bit fishy and definitely not up to par with the other fish we had. ? The service was just so-so. ?It wasn't too busy and we still sat with empty ?plates in front of us for 10+ minutes. ? In the end, I've decided I'll give Morimoto another shot and hopefully need to up my rating and review for the better.

We decided to skip the omakase and create our own tasting menu. ?It turned out to be way too much food but was excellent! ?We started with the Toro Tartare ?and sashimi which were divine. ?My dining companion got the duck, duck, duck for his entree and I got the surf and turf (kobe beef and hamachi) which were both VERY good. ?I loved the presentation of every course. ?We paired these with the morimoto martinis which made for a great combo. ?We also tried our first Japanese vodka here and are now hooked! Didn't like the super close proximity of tables but alas, that is NYC. ?Will be back again!

This place doesn't just offer you a meal, but an entire experience. The ambiance is inviting, not pretentious, and encourages you to explore and have fun. We ordered a lot, from drink and appetizers to dessert - our meal was a bit over 3 hours! It definitely did not feel that long, because each dish that came out was exciting, delicious and another conversation starter. We even -briefly lost our minds- and ordered fatty tuna sashimi = MP that night at $28 for 2 pieces! Though it is very pricey, it was fun, yummy, filling and memorable. Oh, and their bathrooms are fun.

He's an Iron Chef. ?One of my personal favorites. ?I had to try ?his place out when i visited NYC while on vacation. ?We sat down for his Omsaka menu and was ready for a mind blowing experience. ? Honestly I was disappointed. ?I've had better I'd have to say. ?We started off with the tuna tartar which was amazing and the different garnishes that came with it were all so flavorful. ?Then we waited.. and waited. ?Then our next dish came which was the sashimi slices with seasoning. ?Also good. ?Then more waiting. ?Basically the dishes were coming so slowly that we were all .. very hungry in between. ?The matre' d came and apologized saying there was some kitchen problem and comped us some free sake which was nice. ? The rest of the dishes came. ?The highlights were the toro tuna which was excellent although it was only 1 piece of it. ?And maybe the yellow tail slices were good. ?The low points? ?The dessert was too sweet and basically filled our bellies with sugar at the end. ?The palette cleanser in between my cousin mentioned reminded her of ?drinking "emergen-C". And I think for the amount paid, we should have gotten more. Maybe I set the bar too high .. but I think I can say been there.. don't need to do it again.

The food here is quite fresh and delicious. We started with the Tuna Pizza olives, anchovy a?oli, jalape?o which was very tasty and different. We also had the AMAZING Spicy King Crab tobanjan aioli, micro cilantro. For our entree's we tried and loved the Sea Bass sweet sake kasu, japanese eggplant, miso. We didn't love the other entree which was the Seafood 'Toban Yaki' - half shell lobster, king crab, mussel, clam, diver scallop, red miso sake broth. Dessert was great which was the Apple Tarte Tatin golden raisin miso, cinnamon apple ice cream. Not inexpensive but very good.

Let me start by saying that Morimoto is probably not the best place to go for Restaurant week. ?People are likely to walk away disappointed by the bento box option which may seem like a fancier version of what you might get at any other Japanese place (sushi, beef teriyaki, tempura, miso soup, etc). But look, the place is amazing. ?For starters, the restaurant is spacious, elegant, and amazingly designed. ?The servers were professional and thoughtful without coming off as pretentious. Also, if you can think slightly outside of the RW box (and afford it), Morimoto offers some amazing eats. ? My gf switched from getting the RW option, and instead with the unagi foie-gras donburi which was incredibly rich and appetizing with the avocados. ?I enjoyed my bento box but also had one of the better spicy salmon rolls I've tasted. In terms of Japanese, if you want elegance, Morimoto is a fantastic choice. ?Just don't be too swayed by the RW Bento Box option.

This is the best Iron Chef restaurant I've been to thus far. ?Its amazing. Seriously. ?The oysters with 3 sauces, the spicy king crab legs, the black cod, the Ishi Yaki Buri Bop, the big bowl of seafood who's name I cant remember, but it came in a red salty miso broth- to DIE for. ?One time they had a dessert with matcha and pop rocks...I mean seriously?! I highly recommend it and honestly can't wait to take my best friend:)

Morimoto is more than just a restaurant. It's a culinary experience that will tap into all five senses: Sight, hearing, touch, smell and taste. They say you eat with your eyes first. (Not quite sure who "they" are, but you know what I mean.) Morimoto's is all about presentation. The food is beautiful, like artwork. And you can be sure my friends and I devoured each and every one of his pieces. We started with half a dozen oysters, each one sauced and ready to go! There was a soy jalapeno sauce, a ginger sauce and a third one I can't seem to recall. Anyway, let me tell you... I am obsessed with oysters. An oyster fiend. Oysters are my crack. I could have eaten two dozen on my own. They were big and oh so delicious. I'm not one to moan and groan with every bite of my food, but I did with these oysters. I even tried to eat them as slowly as I could, so I could savor the flavor and make them last as long as possible. But sadly, they came to an end. It allowed more food to be brought out, but honestly, the oysters were so good, nothing could compare after that. Don't get me wrong. Everything else was good. But it was as if we peaked too soon. Next, we had the hamachi tartare. This is where Morimoto's exquisite presentation becomes evident. The hamachi has been turned into somewhat of a mushy paste and served in a shallow wood box. It is presented on a bed of ice, along with another box filled with several colorful sauces and toppings, for lack of a better word. The only sauces I remember specifically are the wasabi, eel sauce and the miniscule rice balls. In fact, you're so mesmerized by the colors and beauty of the dish, you almost don't want to spoil it by digging in. The hamachi was fresh and tasty, but this dish seemed to be more about delighting in the experience of being able to play with your food, mixing and matching the different sauces and accompaniments with the fish. We also had the Morimoto sashimi. Another gorgeous dish, brought alive with the vibrant colors of fish and tiny squeezable test tubes filled with more sauces. Little pieces of salmon, hamachi, tuna and eel are layered on top of one another and arranged in little squares. Again, this is another fun, interactive dish. The tuna pizza was tasty, with a good amount of spice. We also had the rock shrimp, which is a must have for one of my friends. The rock shrimp is breaded and comes coated with a wasabi sauce and another spicy sauce, along with homemade ranch, which has a strong dill flavor. Being a sushi and sashimi fan, I don't think I would have ordered the rock shrimp on my own, but I did enjoy that the breading was very crispy, and the shrimp not overcooked. In fact, this was our last dish of the evening, and it sat there for awhile because we were so full. I appreciated that the shrimp's breading never lost its crispiness as it cooled down, despite being coated in sauce. Even though we were pretty stuffed, we wanted to try dessert. We ordered the apple turban, at the waiter's suggestion. It's a cinnamon ice cream dish, with very thin slices of baked apple, and some type of cinnamon swirl wafer. The apple slices were perfectly cooked and it was covered in a delicious, buttery sweet sauce. But Morimoto's isn't just about the food. In fact, the experience continues down in the restrooms. They're Japanese toilets, and you can choose your pleasure. Your seat too cold? Just press a button and heat it up. Not into wiping yourself? Well, you can spray either the front or back, and even control the water pressure at the same time. There's a drying feature as well! I literally giggled outloud when I first sprayed myself. That's all I'm gonna say about that. I wish I lived in New York so I could go to Morimoto's again and try more of the sushi and hot entrees on the menu. Based on this one experience, I feel like I've had sushi that is probably just as good in LA. No doubt the fish we ate that night was fresh and flavorful, but it seemed the emphasis was more on the beautiful presentation and playfulness of the dishes. But it's the overall experience, from the gorgeous space of the restaurant, to the hypnotizing plating, attentive but not overbearing service, down to the restrooms ?that makes this place deserving of a five star rating.

Any fan of either of the Iron Chef series' has to make a trek out to Morimoto. To enjoy his cuisine under his watchful eye is an experience you will not soon forget. The menu is broken up into both a la carte and the Omakase tasting menu. If you have money to burn, get the Omakase. If you are filthy rich, add the wine paring as well. Both are well worth it. The fare tends to lean more towards the American than the Japanese. Either way, his food is enjoyable and the fact that it was made by an Iron Chef, adds to the lore of his cuisine.

This place was very good. ?The entrees were great (although I did find a couple of bones in my fish -- kind of annoying). ?Cod was excellent. The toro tartare was AWESOME and so much fun to each. You scrape the fish with a little shovel and then dip in all of these good sauces and toppings. So good! ?The beef carpacio was very good, super flavorful. ?We also had the surf & turf. Honestly the surf was WAY better than the turf. ?It was hamachi with avocado and citrus -- SO good. ? The desserts were a total disappointment. the chocolate cake was one of the worst chocolate molten cakes I've had and it was surrounded by the most tasteless fruit I have ever had. And the apple turban had a weird taste.

Iron Chef Morimoto is a genius when it comes to blending taste, textures, and fun all into one great dining experience. ? Housed in a gigantic space in the Meat Packing District, Morimoto is done up well with chic, modern decors, perfect for the NY scene. ? E and I came here on the last night of our trip. ?Not wanting to miss out on the best Chef Morimoto had to offer, we both opted for their omakase (7 courses of the chef's choice) without any hesitation! From the beginning until the end, we were taken on a journey to food euphoria. ?Our courses consisted of the following dishes: *Toro Tartare w/ 6 dipping sauces ~ caviar, wasabi, crème fraiche, green onions, rice puffs, and soy bean paste ?- served over a bed of ice with a mini metal shovel to scoop the toro, what a fun and innovative way to eat your food! *Harami "fluke" sashimi - literally melted in my mouth, simple yet I was able to taste the sweetness of the fish *Kampachi salad w/ apple vinaigrette and soy foam - unique dish with great flavors, the amberjack was sooooo fresh! *Oyster with uni and foie gras over sweet sauce - sorry chef, this was my least favorite dish since I thought the sauce was too sweet and overpowered the oyster too much. ?I loved the idea of mixing oyster, uni, and foie gras together, but the sauce just reminded me of a glob of teriyaki sauce, just didn't stand out. *Nigiri sampler ~ tuna, snapper, grand fish "baraccuda", kampachi, and ika - some were lightly seared with a great smokey flavor and all were very tasty and flavorful. ? *Ginger Lemon palette cleanser - very refreshing with a wonderful strong ginger taste *Wagyu beef w/ mountain yam + roasted lobster w/ lemon crème fraiche - one of the best wagyu beef I have tasted in the US, buttery and flavorful. ?The roasted lobster was ok, different in the sense that I have never had my lobster prepared this way before. ?The charred taste was nice + it went well with the lemon crème fraiche. *Chocolate tart w/ chocolate sorbet and caramel crumbs - I can't believe I'm saying this, especially since I am such a dessert nut, but this dish was too sweet. ?Dessert is normally the highlight of all my meals, but sadly, that wasn't the case for this visit. ?:( All and all, the food was still amazing...very forward thinking and innovative for the most part....I almost felt like we were judges on an episode of Iron Chef. ?Aside from the food, be sure to stop by the restrooms during your visit as well...that was an adventure in itself! ?Keeping with the simple, clean, modern look, there were no door knobs to the restroom. ?It took a minute or so to figure it out, but once you step inside, you'll be in awed with just how nice the restroom looked. ?Generally, a restroom is just a restroom, but damn, Morimoto just takes it to a whole new level. ?An extra bonus was that they had a heated toilet seat and bidet in every stall with a nifty remote, totally reminded me of the ones in Japan. ? Morimoto was definitely an experience worth remembering! ?Unfortunately, we did not get to take a picture the chef, but our server was super sweet and awesome! ?He knew we were visiting from out of town so he had Chef Morimoto autograph 2 menus for us, which totally topped off an already amazing night! Thank you Chef Morimoto, keep up the good work!

Prior to taking a late stroll on the High Line so that we could watch the sun set, the gf and I wanted to eat at this place. I put in reservations a few weeks early, at the advice of all my friends and family. Besides, who DOESN'T want to eat at an original Iron Chef's restaurant, let alone out in New York?!?!? Note that this is an old review, but I never drafted it/posted it until now. The restaurant is very aesthetically pleasing. I really liked the colors and the decor of this restaurant. Going from what was recommended by family and friends, we ordered the following: Morimoto Sashimi, Kobe Beef Carpacio, Seabass and Seafood Toban Yaki. Morimoto Sashimi - Amazing. Toro, salmon, eel, tuna and hamachi thinly sliced and layered on top of each other! The sauces they came with were also spectacular. We peeled off each layer and tried each of the different sauces. It was hard to distinguish which was best, because the fish flavors were so delicate, while the sauces added that extra sweetness or spice when needed. I especially liked the japanese plum that came with it. Kobe Beef Carpacio - Amazing as well. I could not stop eating this, and probably should have ordered this over my order (Toban Yaki). The balance of this dish was well executed, with the yuzu soy, ginger and garlic creating this savory sweet sauce that I just wanted to drink or pour over some sushi rice. This is a must order. Seabass over Tempura - This was pretty good. The tempura was absolutely perfect and nicely crisp, despite being under the seabass. The seabass itself was cooked perfectly and tasted great. However, I felt that the appetizers overshadowed the main course. Seafood Toban Yaki - My friend called this Poseidon Jizz as it has almost every shell fish found in the world inside the dish. To me, it was almost like Japanese Ciopino. I thought it tasted OK. There was crab, lobster, mussels, clams and scallops. The sauce was good, but yet again the appetizers were so good, that I was left thinking about them. For dessert, we got a menu special: Soft Chocolate Ganache, White Sesame Ice Cream w Black Sesame. Holy crap... this was amazing.... the Sesame Ice Cream was so ridiculously good, that I wish they sold it in pints. That mixed with the Chocolate Ganache, which was very rich and velvety, is seriously a culinary orgasm. I felt my eyes roll back and hair stand on end eating this dessert. I wish this was on the menu permanently. I would give this place at least 4 stars, but it gets 3 because compared to the dessert and the appetizers, the main dishes that we tried were forgettable, not because they weren't good, but moreso because the appetizers and desserts were so out of this world, it made me forget that I ate dinner. Next time I come here, (or head to the one in Napa which is closer to me), I'll probably stick with multiple appetizers! Also they have the craziest toilets outside of Europe! Really gives you that "Just Cleaned" Feeling ;)

I was so pleased with my dining experience here. What makes a good experience, 1. your company 2. the food 3. the atmosphere/ ambiance and all three were on point. My friend is a regular here so he knew all the dishes to order. I can only comment on the dishes I've tried... but I don't think I was disappointed with one dish! - Tuna Tartare: Solid, the cavier is a nice added touch - Crispy Rock Tempura: tasty, i like the coating sauce on this - Kakuni: I've never been disappointed with kakuni... no exception here - Beef Curry Bread: not something i would think to order, but i really like this - Spicy King Crab: I'm the sorts that likes the taste of crab over lobster, so this made me happy! - Duck Duck Duck: I dont even like duck but I sure did like this dish - Angry Chicken: I really like the flavoring of this chicken and it wasn't dry like chicken can soemtime tend to be. - Seafood Toban Yaki: ?YUMMY! Def one of my favs. Needless to say, I had no room for dessert. ? I think i will come back one of these days and try the omakase...

High-end sushi, celebrity chef, and incredible decor! What more can you ask for? This is the 2nd time I have frequented Morimoto NY (sans his Grace, Masaharu Morimoto, unfortunately!) Went with a few friends back in 2010 and was pleasantly surprised with the accomodating staff, amazing service, and excellent food. We got the toro tartare, duck duck duck (to die for!), lobster dish, and of course, several rolls! The dessert was beautiful to look at...but all I can remember is the tobacco stick, which was...interesting, to say the least. But I will say that it did complement the rest of the dessert. Went there again on New Years Day with reservations. My boyfriend and I ordered the Omakase chef's tasting menu, which was a fabulous choice since we couldn't decide what to order. We again had our own famouse toro tartare, which was fabulous, since the Philly location does not offer this. The 2nd course was probably my favorite dish of the night which was a beautifully plated yellowtail carpaccio. Seasoned perfectly and such a delicate flavor! Then there was a sort of fondue with a mushroom dipping sauce. Probably my least favorite dish but only because it really just felt like a few pieces of vegetables, albeit presented beautifully. The next several courses were an oyster with foie gras, a sushi sampler dish, a palette cleansing housemade ginger ale, and a lobster & wagyu beef dish with creme fraiche. Finally, the dessert! Wow. I'm generally not a fan of flan, but this was just an incredible explosion of flavors with passion fruit being the highlight! I'm not sure if this is a dessert featured on their regular menu, but it should be!! Last note, visit the bathroom. And often. It's probably borderline obsessive of me, but I have a fascination with beautifully decked out bathrooms in restaurants and the one at Morimoto is one of my favorites. I really can just stand there for a few minutes playing with the buttons on the high-end toilets and still give Morimoto 5 stars. Have a few drinks, visit the bathroom, and go nuts! (side note, the Morimotini, not my favorite. Go for the High Line cocktail instead!) To sum it up, Omakase was worth every penny!

Second time at Morimoto and it was amazing as usual! It's definitely more low key intimate dining with a very clean decor. I LOVE the rock shrimp tempura combo! So had to indulge of course! The new thing was the Sorbet Trio. Delish! The combo is something I don't think anyone would think of.. raspberry wasabi guava lime and basil (more a palette cleaner imo) but this combo was awesomee!!! it was a Thursday night (and even though it was about 10 30 we were able to get seated right away) the service by the wait staff is unparalleled. They are very detailed in the description of everything that is set on your table, and of course the presentation is TOP NOTCH.

In a nutshell: the appetizers here are pretty tasty, but the entrees are only ok. Best way to go is cocktails + a bunch of appetizers (but may be costly to go this route) Appetizers: Oyster foie gras (4.5 stars): ?Very rich..combination of seared foie gras, uni, and oyster in a light, teriyaki sauce. ?If you like the above, you will love this appetizer. Morimoto sashimi (3.5 stars): Fresh, but I prefer my sashimi piece by piece, instead of a "sandwich" of various fish stacked on eachother. ?Comes with 5 different sauces to dip. ?Very fusion tasting. Spider roll (3.5 stars): Typical soft-shell crab roll. ?Can't go wrong with simple rolls. ? Entrees: Surf & turf (3 stars): Even though we ordered the steak medium-rare, it tasted more like medium or even medium-well. ?Not too juicy or tender. ?Also comes with potatoes..very plain. The "surf" part was yellowtail sashimi i believe mixed in an avocado/guacamole like sauce. ?Just an ok -dish... i wouldn't recommend it. ? Codfish (4 stars): ?Very buttery fish...well prepared (although I've had better) and it comes with a few asian black beans on the side (4 beans)...which tasted almost like a dessert...very sweet. ? Unique features: The bathroom has the most high-tech toilet i have ever seen. ?As soon as u open the door, the seat cover automatically lifts up. ?There is also this panel on the side for all sorts of cleansing options. ?The decor is also very neat with an infinity mirror right in the bathroom stall. ?Definitely take a look, even if you don't need to use the bathroom

I came here for restaurant week and had their lunch prix fixe bento box. The cod was cooked perfectly, and all of the other components of the bento box were prepared excellently :) I left with a happy stomach. They may recommend the tuna tartare (sp?) to you-- its not worth the price, but it looks interesting and its kind of fun to eat... My waiter was also especially courteous, and the service was excellent.

Beautiful ambiance, creative decorations and looked like it could be a lot of fun, but the lounge downstairs just did not cut it. There is a lot of potential for this place, but for a Saturday night, I was not impressed by the crowd (or lack of). The drinks were great and the bartender was kind enough to let us try out a chocolate patron (love love love) but I am confused as to why there wasn't a better crowd. The best part (besides chocolate patron) of the experience was the bathroom! Heated toilet seats earned this place an extra star

This place is fantastic. The bar downstairs is good, and they make interesting mixed drinks, but also stock a healthy selection of scotch. The food, though, is why you come. Here, you should take the time to try something that seems outrageous. It seems to me, from my numerous meals here, that the more wild the concept, the better the execution. This is the guy from Iron Chef, remember. Tuna carpaccio pizza? Goooooood. Tuna tartare with a large assortment of condiments (including caviar and mayo. yes. caviar. and mayo.) arranged like a painter's palette? Gooooood. Asian-style bouillabaisse with Korean hot paste? Goooooood. And a sizeable lobster (no wait, it was a langoustine, so it was a French lobster) in the middle. Chicken ramen? For 14 bucks? Uh, not 14 bucks good. Sushi? Very well made, exceptionally well made, really, but I've had better elsewhere. Don't come to Morimoto's thinking it's just a Japanese place. Order wildly, and you don't leave disappointed. Or better yet, order the omakase (tasting menu) if you have the wherewithall, and let Mr. Morimoto pick for you. I've never gone wrong with omakase, and he might even wander by and ask in his fobby english how things are. Very nice guy.

What an amazing experience! ?The place is gorgoeus and chef Morimoto was there!! The dinner was an experience, from the professional staff to the outstanding food!! ?Wow!! ?Five Stars!! I was on ?a business trip and took a client there for dinner last week. ?We shared three appetizers, the Toro Tartare, the Tiger Shrimp Tempura and the Steamed Scallops with Scallions! For main course, I had the Seafood Toban Yaki, my boss had the Trout and our client had the Sea Bass - we sampled each others plates and couldn't come up wtih a favorite, all three were perfect! For dessert, the Warm Chocoalte cake and the Apple Tatin! Presentation, Taste and the Experience - Five Stars!! Excellent!

Wow. Toro Tartare... great presentation, delicious. Tiger Eye cocktail; I was buzzed off of the $14 drink. We had the tasting menu $120/pp and that was well worth it. Spicy King Crab was tasty but if you're not into mayo, then this is not for you. What an experience, it was a great place! Sushi was delicious; part of the tasting menu. My husband was jealous that I went here without him. Probably because the toilet has a build in dryer. Yeayah! Total bill? $715 for three. Be prepared.

The decor is beautiful. The open, multi-tiered seating areas, the open kitchen, lower level bar, subtle traditional and modern entrance, the ceiling, and last but not least the chairs. All excellent. Having said that, we were a table of 8 and they sat us in a annex to the main room which is not as impressive and on the night the A/C was not working well and this annex was a little warm. I'm not letting the A/C problems reflect on the review because our complaints about it were handled in the most professional and courteous manner. The service in general is good but more casual than I expected. I didn't expect it to match Le Bernadin but it was definitely more casual than The Modern all of which of of the same sort of price range. The food was good and some dishes were excellent. The Kobe Carpacio was excellent, lobster fritters were very very good. As a main I had the Bass in a Miso sauce which was perfectly cooked and very very tasty. I also tasted the Bilimbab (sp?) which was lovely.. especially the rice. The Duck was also very tasty. We also had a Sushi course between appetizers and mains. I'm no expert on Sushi and haven't tried the best places in NY. I think the best I've tried was at Jewel Bako and I don't think Morimoto came close. Out of the sampler I think I went sushi gooey over 2-3 pieces out of a total of about 8-10 different pieces. We were given complimentary deserts (see A/C issue). One was a fruit tart/crumble (not sure what the Americans call this). The tart reminded me of the French pastries and was lovely but a little heavy on a warm night. The second desert was a coconut macaroon and ice cream and chocolate and was excellent. The presentation of all dishes was exceptional and when they arrived at the table looked like they should have been in a magazine. The drinks were great. I tried the signature White Lilly and it was a great summer choice.

How could I dine around just around the corner from Morimoto and NOT drop by? So..... I just had to. And once again, it was fabulous. Since I was out w/ a few sweet tooths, we decided to come by here for dessert, so we sidled up to their downstairs bar area for a few treats. We ordered their little Tofu 'Cheesecake' trio with lime zest, candied ginger, & maple syrup and a dish which consisted of a layering of sliced bananas, chocolate, and thin wafers. And let me tell you... we were practically fighting each other tooth and nail for the last bites. I'm not much of a dessert fan, but holllly crap. Morimoto takes the cake! Order either of the 2 desserts and you won't be disappointed!

So you're walking up to 10th Ave. and you see this clever little half moon (or should I say "sun") shape arching over the street, with red banners waving about. Only to realize that this artistic "rising sun" is welcoming you into what might be one of the top 10 meals you encounter in New York. I know being a critic is easy and almost more interesting to read, but this restaurant didn't leave much to be critical of, quite honestly. We walked in met by a completely friendly host, who offered either an early seating or a drink at the bar. Of course we opted to belly up first and have one at the bar underneath the restaurant which was done beautifully with a contemporary flair. ?After polishing off a specially-made twist on a shiso leaf "mojito," soju-based I believe, we were ready to eat. Of course we had to go with the omakase dinner. There were really too many highlights to write about, so all I can promise is that every course escalated in both its flavors and surprises. From a sharkskin tray packed with "toro tartare" served with various types of sea salts, rice crackers, caviar to add both texture and flavor to each bite (one of the most unique serving techniques I've seen) to a miso broth gelee with a hint of wasabi and an accompanying roasted teriyaki foie gras oyster; every base was covered. Textures. Innovations. Unique serving techniques. Flavors. By the time the final course of 4 oz. of Wagyu beef accompanied by 1/2 of a spiny tailed, Indian-spiced lobster arrived we were grinning from ear to ear. Not to mention I skipped over telling all of you good folks about the sashimi plate with five sauces and a braised cod that was to die for. Now I will say, that for a menu with over 23 different desserts (we were eyeing a few from surrounding tables) that we probably didn't get the primo of the picks. Ours was a sweet potato souffle (in its own little custom steamer) with a quenelle of ginger ice-cream and azuki beans. not my fav but who's complaining? In the end, if you love food, then you should love Morimotos. Because honestly lose the clubby interior design, lose the bad-ass bathrooms (yes...as everyone has noted they are pretty sweet), lose the Iron Chef stigma, lose the prime Chelsea real estate and give me a slab of pine, a chair, me in flip-flops and cargo shorts and Moriomoto's omakase cuisine is still to die for. I look forward to returning again to further navigate the rest of his brilliantly designed menu! Oishii-desu!

Since I'm accustomed to food from Los Angeles, this food was awesome! ?Hype, design and quality. ?Hello... trifecta. ?Actually, hype is really not a priority to me, but living up to hype impresses me immensely. Gosh, I must have eaten here three years ago, so my memories are rather vague. ?I just remember the dishes being simple, well-presented and tasty. ?Flavors were clean and uncomplicated, but worked well. I would go again in a heartbeat.

I just ate at the Morimoto in Napa and in comparison, the Napa one is much much better (which is why I'm giving it only 3 stars) I had the Omakase at both the Napa and NY locations and was surprised that they are almost identical. I don't like chain restaurants and I was hoping each Morimoto restaurant would be unique. Overall the NY location gave about HALF the amount of food as the Napa location. I was left still hungry (actually my friend was too and we went elsewhere for more food). Toro Tartare: His signature and really good. Presentation is beautiful! Sashimi Course: Really great. Fresh fresh fish and their rice is perfectly seasoned with vinegar. Oysters, Fois Gras, Uni: This was my FAVORITE. Really delicious Lobster & Beef: This was my least favorite dish. The lobster is covered in too much spice and you can't taste the real lobster flavor. Mine was a bit undercooked and mushy like babyfood. Tofu Cheesecake: Ick - hated the texture and the taste. It was covered in some coffee syrup and it was not good.

Yes, it's another large restaurant in the Meat Packing District... t my girlfriend and I enjoyed it! Service was very friendly and we fell in love with the restaurant concierge (I never knew there was such a thing as a restaurant concierge... we don't have them in San Francisco...) who was absolutely adorable and gave us great ideas on what to do in the area Thurs nite (he's the one who recommended Cielo... YES!) Food was very good although definitely on the pricier side (1 piece of nigiri was $6.. so basically double). But our final bill was reasonable at $100 for 2 people and we ate til we were satisfied (we're both pretty big eaters, our boyfriends will attest to this!). Downstairs was their bar... seemed quiet which surprised me, but the bartenders were very nice. Definitely recommend checking it out... if you have the cash to burn you can also sit at the special table (think there's a $200/person minimum)... heard you can see the Iron Chef himself in action?

I used to work in a firm that was located right above Morimoto's. I had terrible reception in that building so I had to run outside to use my cellphone and 7 times out of 10 I'd bump into Morimoto during one of his many cigarette breaks. At one point, I noticed he had lost considerable weight and complimented him. He smiled and bowed then patted his belly saying he just recently went on a diet. But I digress. We went here as a treat for a cousin who was visiting for a few days. We all decided to splurge and, as if our bank accounts could handle it, we went ahead and ordered Omakase for our entire table. Japanese for something along the lines of "It's up to you," Omakase for us meant a multi-course meal (around 8 dishes with an amuse bouche thrown in here and there as well as desserts - yes, plural) that brought us to the borderline of taste bud heaven and foodie coma. Seriously, how can you lose with an opening that featured toro tartare and osetra caviar? Although, the most memorable part of the meal, we would have to say, was the lobster roasted in garam masala. Holy sweet Jesus and all that is good and righteous in the world. Pure insanity. The service was also impeccable. The server helped us choose a good sake to complement our upcoming barrage of flavors and whenever the dishes came, they were brought by an army of food runners to ensure that everyone got a plate at the same exact time. Meanwhile, our server would recite in great detail what each dish was composed of. It was like watching a well-rehearsed symphony except with plates of food instead of percussion and strings.

So came here I guess with expectations too high....since it is one of the iron chef's restaurants and was sadly disappointed with not only the service but the food...... Ok so granted our party was rather large (18 ppl) yea asian people like to roll deep...but still it should not have been so difficult...esp. since we made the reservation for my friend's bday like a week in advance!!! Literally, we had to wait 30 min for them to set up the table and they were still 1 chair short!!!!! The food is def. not cheap here...we orered: The Kobe beef/Lobster meals, sushi rolls, and tons of drinks : bill for 18 ppl -- $1900 including tip..... Sushi rolls were mediocre at best! the Kobe beef/lobster dish although presentation was nice the taste was overall-failing!!!! Not worth the price...will prob not come back here again even though morimoto sent over free drinks for the wait...I still am not a fan!

The space is really cool - they have some of the best bathrooms in the city, IMHO. I would put this place on the-bring-someone-you-want-to-impress-list not only because of the design but also because it's always packed. A lot of things reminded me of Nobu - which isn't surprising... We ordered the following apps: Hamachi tartar - a little too avant garde for me, I get that the Japanese are all about the packaging - but it seemed kinda overkill Rock shrimp tempura - I pretty much like anything fried, but this is exactly what you'd get at Nobu - definitely yummy Pork gyoza - eh, it's dumplings, solid...but I wouldn't say a must Steamed scallop - This was very good, scallops were light & broth was yummy, prepared well & a v. pretty dish Entrees - there was special - hamachi in a bi bim bop stone bowl - I didn't even get to try a bite, I looked over & my cousin's plate was empty - so in wolfing down factor, it must be pretty good Surf & turf - I didn't get to try the surf portion, again, when I looked over, that was gone - but the kobe was excellent Duck - this was a great dish, not what I'd expect for a Japanese restaurant but it was well prepared, flavorful & not greasy, which is huge because duck is a very fatty fowl & the croissant was yum-my! I ordered the chirashi - which I thought was ok - I think it was very traditional - b/c there was a lot of freaking mackerel in it. Personally, I'm not a mackerel sushi person...so be warned it's (ironically) a fishier dish than what I'm used to / expected - but the fish was fresh - so I'm sure people will scoff at my take on it & enjoy this dish - esp if they are more die hard than I am. The sushi platter ($35 portion) looked standard - my friend said it was very fresh (which is v. important when getting sushi) Rose sparkly by the glass - a fav! Chocolate melty cake (I know that's not the correct name but I know you know what I'm talking about) was good - w/caramel popcorn (which oddly, was my favorite part of the dish) Service was excellent, efficient, friendly - overall a very enjoyable meal with great ambience. With the food above & 2 glasses of sparkly, 4 grey goose & sodas & 2 sapporos - with tip total was $450 **Side note, I checked opentable for a reservation and there was nothing listed online but when I called in, I was able to get a reservation for 6 people, (although only 5 showed.) Not sure why - maybe someone cancelled and the system wasn't up to date...but I have found that if I call, I get lucky and get a spot.

Alright so I may not be the world's biggest foodie, but I have to say I was thoroughly impressed with my meal at Morimoto last night. Everything about it, the service, presentation and of course the food itself, was wonderful. If you get the chance to come here, definitely opt for the Rock Shrimp Tempura as an appetizer. It is in short, to die for. Beyond that, nearly all the sushi/sashimi offerings are great, as are most of the entrees. What sold me the most on Morimoto though was its impeccable staff and attentive servers. They made a nice dinner with great food, truly memorable. Will I come back? Definitely!

My only complaint about this place was the interior. It's very nice and well-done, but the minimalist Jetsons vibe was cool in like 1997. It's been over and takes away from the overall radness. Food: ?Amazing. Lamb Carpaccio was my favorite. Service: ?Perfect balance between helpful, informative, and non-intrusive. Drinks: ?Amazing. Get the shiso leaf shiso-ha. Ambience: Dope, even with interior.

This place is beautifully designed and very chic. The food was quite impressive along with the excellent service and everything in between. Gotta thank Ripal P. for suggesting and making reservations for this place since he knew I was such a foodie! - Foie Gras Oysters: orgasmic delicacy served warm with oyster on the half shell, uni, and foie gras with the perfect amount of teriyaki sauce to flavor but still taste each unique ingredient. - Salmon Roll: okay, nothing special. although there was a scale in one of the pieces I ate, it's forgivable, but for a place like this, it was just surprising. - Beef Curry Bread: not what we expected (like 2 large fried falafels), but interesting in a good way. extremely fried and hard to cut, but tasty - Braised Black Cod: really tender, delicious sauce but couldn't really taste the ginger, only soy mostly. didn't care much for the salad part - White Lily Cocktail: peppery, flowery taste, not bad but not great Everything from the hostess, bartender, bar counter design, food, servers/bussers, food timing, new plates & silverware after every dish, service, decor was excellent! This is one of the few restaurants that has wowed me in every way (Gary Danko & The Ritz are a few). Highly recommend to try even though it is a little pricey, but well worth it!

Wowy Wow Wow Wow Perfection. From the amazing service, innovative decor and out of this word food, I would say put eating at Morimoto on your bucket list. Having 24 hours in the city on a recent trip to NY, my foodie boyfriend and I decided that Morimoto was a must try and boy are we glad we went. Next time I am going to save my pennies and try the Chef's tasting menu which was something like $100 each. Our table wasn't ready right away so we went downstairs to an ice age bar were I had a Yuzo martini, fabulous! They ask you for your last name so the drink goes directly on your tab. No having to pay out the bar before going to your table, genius. The host comes and gets you with a little tray to carry your drink to your table, nice touch. Our waitress was one of the nicest I've encountered and knew everything about the menu and chef and was willing to indulge us in our geeky obsession with the Master Chef. We order the tuna toro tartar and it was simple fantastic. I wanted to take its picture it was so beautiful. The rest of the meal was delicious and we topped it off with chocolate cake, whiskey carmel, tobacco essence and popcorn icecream. Deeeelish! Apparently the men's bathroom was so cool, my boyfriend still talks about it. Anyhow, I don't need to say another word, go and try for yourself. You will be very happy that you did!

Traditional meets modern, cantina meets high end restaurant. Morimoto is beautiful. Very white, very airy, with concrete and metal accents to remind you of the area you're in. The dishes were really good. From fish to duck, the whole table enjoyed every single part of the experience. Great lychee-tinis. Good, very professional service. I recommend it for an evening among friends, 4 to 6 at the table, to have drinks and enjoy original, well presented food. Make reservations! Do NOT omit to check out the WCs... you'll be surprised :)

Ok So im really torn about morimoto... ive been here countless number of times.... id say above 8 but each time ive only had their omakase which i thought was one of the best in the city. Not only is it delicious but also extremely filling. I am not left hungry for more like many of the other omakase s in the city... However yesterday was the first time EVER ordering from the menu... I have to say i was greatly disappointed with the food. The quality of food and the taste was nothing special. Tasted like any average japanese restaurant at 1/2 the price. i ordered the Crispy Rock Shrimp Tempura - nothing special here Kakuni ten hour pork. congee, soy-scallion jus - holy f'in crap this was good! Ishi Yaki Buri Bop yellowtail on rice cooked at your table in a hot stone bowl - this was only ok... not that great... i thik with the hot stone bowl the rice continues to cook and burn... so my rice was extremely hard and crunchy. I also ordered the 150 dollar thing of sushi which was a mix of everything. I also didnt find this too special... but the omakase is so much better. Im not sure why but i also feel like the quality of sushi tastes much better too.. it might be mental... but im not sure. last night i was extremely disappointed bottom line is if i was rating the omakase on its own perfect 5 the menu items (which should be better since there is more thought placed into menu items) is a 1 or 2... averaging out to a overall.

I remeber walking by this place a long time ago and being kind of creeped out by the entrace and really the whole area. Well needless to say once upon entering, it's a gorgeous restaurant. Very modern with clean lines and glass every where. I didn't stay to eat, just had drinks down stairs. The bar downstairs is equally as gorgeous and minimal. The drinks... they were fantastic. I had the white lilly, or something like that, I don't know what it was it was sweet, tart, and fairly strong. mmm delicious. Expensive, but delicious. As soon as I start getting paid more I will be back for more drinks and will definitely try the menu. It would be an impressive place to bring a date if that's what you were going for.

I went for the omakase. ?I usually dont care about service, but the service was great. ?Our server adjusted for allergies and provided great guidance about the menu. We were delighted by the upgrade in the main feature of the omakase to certified beef. ?The first course we wonderful (toro tartare). ?The sashimi course was not impressive, but that was due to a cultural bias (the flavors were and exact replication of chinese homestyle steamed fish....and thats not what I came for). ?the sushi had a bit too much wasabi in it, but the fish was great....yes, it was sunday fish. ?the oyster was not impressive at all. ?the sauce was mainly sugar. ?the same goes for the yams under the beef. ?im happy that the beef was not tainted by the yam sauce. at the end, i got stuck with the chocolate cake (tasted like every other Bindi cake) because of nut allergies, but my friends loved their desserts. I expected more creativity and diversity. ?Sugary sauces could have been replaced or foregone. The amount of food was perfect. ?I had woken up at 3pm and only had a cookie before the dinner.

Masaharu Morimoto has been an inspiration for my learning and growth in the kitchen. ?I was very excited to finally experience his playful fusion of Japanese ingredients and his love for other Asian and European flavors. ?I felt I could best experience his passion and approach to food by ordering an assortment of hot and cold appetizers and a few main dishes. ? Toro Tartare and Hamachi Tartare - We ordered both, and I enjoyed the hamachi more. ?Beautifully presented on a wooden plank with caviar, the tartare is to be eaten with your preference of wasabi, nori paste, avocado cream, chives, creme fraiche, and rice crackers. Tuna Pizza - One of our favorite appetizers, you can see Morimoto's lighthearted approach to food. ?Delicately thin and topped with anchovy aioli, jalapeno, olive, and maguro. Ramen Soup - A big bowl of thin, somen-like noodles with a golden consomme. ?Don't expect Japanese ramen, this is Morimoto's take on chicken noodle soup. Spicy King Crab - This was not as spicy as expected with the tobanjian aioli. ?Similar to a baked dynamite topping, I didn't enjoy it as much as the others. Kakuni - Kakuni is a popular stewed pork belly dish in the izakayas of Japan. ?The ridiculously tender pork combined with the wonderful congee was one of my favorites of the night. Japanese Lobster Fritters - Fried balls of lobster fun, not great but not bad. Crispy Rock Shrimp Tempura - Another appetizer that was fun to eat, but I felt it was a little over sauced with the kochujan sauce and the wasabi aioli. Ishiyaki Buri Bop - The rice had delicious slices of hamachi and was cooked at our table. ?I wish they had used a real stone pot since the rice didn't get cooked to the crispy layer of goodness that it was intended to be. Surf and Turf - Wagyu filet & hamachi ribbons, herbed potatoes, crushed citrus & avocado prepared tableside. ?I had a small sample and it was just ok for me...the wagyu label can sometimes sound better than its flavor. If you're an Iron Chef fan, I'd recommend going a la carte and sampling as much as you can from the regular menu instead of the sushi menu. ? I know sushi is a big part of Morimoto's restaurant, but unless he is personally preparing it at the bar, I'd rather enjoy the wonderful choices of his other menu items. ?Omakase is an option, but ordering a la carte will give you the freedom to choose and offers bigger portions as well. ? We had a wonderful dinner here with great service...now, I hope to one day visit his new restaurant in Napa.

Took the bf here for his surprise bday dinner. We shared the omakase and the seafood in the red miso broth (forgot the name). Also ordered two oh toro (fattiest tuna) and two uni sashimi. Oh and the oysters. All the raw food were AMAZING!!! I savored each bite! I will post photoes next time since I don't have them on hand now.. As for the cooked food.. the lobster was ok. All the rest were so-so. I did expect it to be amazingly good as well as their raw stuff but it wasn't that great. I would definitely go back.. ONLY for their sashimi and other raw foods. And ONLY when I feel like splurging. Our bill came out to be $277 but at least we were stuffed.

I love Sushi. I like Iron Chef. I was in the neighborhood. It was loud. It was fun. It was overpriced. I did it...I won't do it again.

Cool ambiance, good service, fun menu. There were so many things we wanted to try, so we opted for the 7- course tasting menu (omikase $120 pp). The wagyu beef was good. Pretty much everything we had was delicious, but not out of this world amazing. Loved the presentation of each course. Liked how the service wasn't rushed. Didnt like how close the tables were next to each other. We agree with other reviews in that we were still hungry after our meal. ?Probably wouldn't go back because there are far better choices in the city at the same price point. We did, however,enjoy our meal. The morimotini was excellent! The sake our waiter recommended was also really good.

Last night in NY called for a visit to an Iron Chef staple...Morimoto! Decor was clean, unique and visually pleasing. Toro tartare was to die for....next time I'd rather not share :) Sushi was nothing extraordinary....it was fresh and good. Very small portions. Our entree was visually pleasing but fell short on flavor. I feel like the intense menu explanation didn't come through in the dish. I'm glad I tried Morimoto and I'd probably go back and sit at the sushi bar and have a cocktail or two, but I'd hit Blue Ribbon on Sullivan St. before visiting here again. Fact: You're paying for the experience and the name. I did have great dinner company though :)

All that needs to be said is MASAHARU MORIMOTO. What an artist this man is... how it's possible to get the absolute freshest ... most beautiful ingredients to come together absolutely amazes me. ?His dishes are innovative and no one can compare to this man! I've been here twice, yes it it pricey, but for special occassions, this is the place to go!!! We ordered some starters: oysters and foie gras- very amazinggggg !!!! rock shrimp tempura ... ok let's talk about this for a second. ?there were two kinds of rock shrimp... the "normal" rock shrimp... a little spicy, and then a wasabi aieoli rock shrimp. OMG!!!!!! i've never eaten shrimp so tasty in my life. We also ordered the lobster fritters, which i wasn't crazy about just because of the ginger, but my boyfriend loved them. Then we had sushi.... the sushi!!!! raw squid, tuna, snapper ... everything was amazing. ? I must say that they do have one of the best dirty martini's i've ever tasted. Definitely a great restaurant in the heart of Manhattan. It's a must for all sushi lovers as well as all Iron Chef fanatics (Like me!)

First I must tell you that I have been excited to visit this restaurant for a long time. Watching Iron Chef Morimoto on food network and all the hype behind him had me ecstatic to visit his restaurant. After a great day in the city with my girlfriend, we headed over to Morimoto. We ?arrived a little early for our reservation but was seated promptly, which was great. The waiter was very nice and knowledgeable about the menu and helping us make a few decisions on what to eat. My girlfriend and I decided on the Toro Tartar which was served very nicely, the presentation was incredible. It tasted delicious and the dippings were so good, I would definitely recommend this to anyone going here. We also ordered a spicy tuna roll which I know is very simple roll and you can't get a simple roll and be too judgmental but being that I have been to a ton of Japanese restaurants and think I have a pretty good taste for sushi, I regrettably say I was disappointed. It was good and fresh but not the best I've had and didn't blow me away like I had hoped it would, it just tasted like a roll I could get anywhere. Next for our main course, after a lot of positive reviews and the love both my girlfriend and I have for duck, we both went with the duck, duck, duck. The dish was served in two parts, the foie gras croissant which was awesome and the roast duck which was very disappointing. The croissant was so delicious and I wish it were bigger and the whole dish, the roast duck I found to be a little flavorless and just bleh. By the end of our meal I was very very disappointed and didn't want to try dessert because we didn't want to be further disappointed. The decor is very modern and inviting but the one thing I hated was the way it was set up. For the prices they charge I do not want to be on top of my neighbors and have to move the table over to get up and sit down from the table (I am an average build). The tables were just so on top of each other that I found it hard to have a conversation without becoming distracted by the conversations around us. This is the second iron chef restaurant that I've gone to that I was extremely disappointed by after all the hype. Maybe it was an off night or maybe it was what we ordered but I would not return, I'll stay more local and enjoy the Japanese places I have come to love.

I think the main reason that I would go to Morimoto would be...because it's Morimoto. It's worth going if you've never been, and especially if you have out-of-towner's who love Iron Chef haha. I've been every now and then over time with my trips to ny but it is a bit overrated. The ambiance was great except for one time where the couple next to us that fought over dinner the entire time and ended with the wife/gf? storming out, but the service was impeccable &she kept us well fed and refilled the entire time. We had the: Hamachi Tartar as our appetizer which I highly recommend. I would have to say this was my favorite dish of the entire meal! Seafood Tobanyaki which consisted of lobsterr, king crab, mussels, &clams as far as I can remember. It was in a red miso sake broth that looked impressive until I tasted it. It was far too salty for my taste-buds &it would have been better if it had been diluted somehow. Sushi was okay, not spectacular but we just ordered all the fresh fish that they had that night. Dessert was also a highlight with the Tofu Hot and Cold which did not taste like tofu at all and instead tasted like heaven in a little souffle. I would go back just for the appetizer and souffle! It's worth a try for the experience!

Is it pricey? Yes. Is it worth it? Absolutely. Not being a native New Yorker I experienced major sticker shock when I saw the prices on this menu. But once I ate my first Morimoto morsel, I knew it was worth every penny. My group and I ordered almost at least half of the menu. I would highly recommend the lobster fritters and the tempura rock shrimp. The rock shrimp is served with this delicious dill/ranch dip, I wish I would have kept it for the rest of my meal to dip everything in. If I had to choose one thing that was my favorite it would be the sashimi salad. I have never had more deliciously seared and seasoned tuna and it was served with a Caesar like salad, not the usual soy sauced based green mixture. For sushi, you cannot go wrong. I loved the shrimp tempura, spider crab, California roll, and most of the the BBQ-ed eel roll. The BBQ on the eel gave it a different texture and unique taste. Go to Morimoto and you will eave full of delicious fish and your wallet a little bit lighter. But, like I said, completely worth it. Apparently many other diners thought the same thing as the entire restaurant was completely full!

While the architecture in this place is absolutely amazing (and worth a visit for that alone) I found the quality of the food to be less than perfect, which is what it should have been for the price. But as anyone should know going to this spot, you are going for the scene and not necessarily the best food on the planet. Don't get me wrong - the Iron Chef runs a pretty tight ship over there, and was even behind the sushi bar the night we went. The toro tartare and rock shrimp tempura were mouth watering. But then the sushi sampler (that came out in a giant porcelain pot that takes two people to carry) was so-so, A+ on presentation, but a C on flavor. I'd prefer Blue Ribbon over the Iron Chef anyday.

Part 1 of 2 - My Japanese food experience in NYC Of all the wonderful cuisines available in NYC, why would I want to try Japanese food in this city, when I live in one of the best places (LA) for Japanese food??? ?That's what I was thinking as I was riding a cab to Morimoto. ?However, I was glad to be pleasantly surprised over the course of this weekend first at Morimoto and then again at Kurumazushi the next day. We had the Omakase, which came highly recommended from our friends who've been there. ?Honestly, I don't remember all the courses =P, the tuna toro tartar was pretty good, the trick with it is to scoop across and then up getting the condiments first before getting just the right amount of toro you want. ?The sushi was just ok, nothing spectacular. The oyster foie gras was good, but too small. ?It did make sense for the portions to be small though considering there were 8 courses, we were both pretty full by the end. I'm not a dessert guy, but the dessert bento box was definitely one of the highlights. If I was giving a rating just for food, I would have probably just given Morimoto 3 stars. ?BUT, the place is amazing, just check out the pics in their website. ?Morimoto totally delivers on the NYC experience, an experience that you just can't get anywhere else. ?They have a wide selection of alcohol, which is always a plus for me =D ?I have no idea what "aged sake" means, but there are a few sake & plum wine inspired cocktails that are definitely worth trying. ?One more tip, after dinner, walk a 1/2 block up to this bar called The Park for a drink or two, very cool Asian theme bar with plenty of outdoor seating. (to be continued...)

I have been wanting to go to morimoto for some time now and i am so glad i finally made it! I thought everything about the place was amazing. From the minute i stepped into the restaurant i fell in love with the place. The decor was amazing, and the food was equally as impressive. Everything i ate was perfectly prepared especially the sushi and the toban yaki. I however would not recommend the desert I had the warm chocolate cake and it came with a tobacco créme which i found pretty offensive but the rest of the meal was so good i can look way past it.

Food or let's say their sushi-NOT GOOD!!! You would think they would have fresh sushi hence being a japanese/seafood restaurant. What the hells! Spicy tuna roll-good but not good. Chunky tuna that wasn't all mayosee-but it wasn't spicy at all. Best part was their dessert. Popcorn ice cream something and Tofu cheesecake were delish! If you eat everything individuall it's whatever,,but when you mix everything together...it's delicious. The bathroom-I could've stayed in there for hours. Just try it LOL

Came here with a foodie group for their restaurant week lunch special...3 courses for $24.07 with tax and tip that was $30.00. I had the mixed green salad with vinegarette as my first course, the beef gyudon for my entree and then some of the petit fours for dessert. The other guests had the piping hot miso soup with the black cod. My mixed green salad was huge and I was definitely surprised they didn't skim on the portions at all...same with my entree...came with a lot of beef with an egg covering a full bed of rice...in a humongous bowl...good thing I gave a big portion of my rice to the other three guests with me otherwise my stomach would've exploded from such a big meal. Their desserts were not good enough to mention at all...so if anything the lunch portion at least the beef and salad were good enough and worth the 30 bucks that I spent here. The other guests who had the miso soup - piping hot by the way so watch your fingers as one of the guests burnt her fingers for a millisecond just touching the sides of the bowl and the black cod seemed to enjoy their meal as well. I can't comment on this as I didn't try it. The decor was great I loved the trendy atmosphere, actually the girls loved it so much we ended up taking a group girl photo right by the stairs. ?plus a star for this minus two stars for the dessert...although it was edible...that was the only extent it went...I would've rather not eaten it but I hate wasting food plus a star for not skimming on the portions especially my beef and salad Plus a star for the service...I went in here expecting to have horrible service as have been told this by friends especially during restaurant week. But I was definitely surprised...the waiter was attentive and came back to make sure our table was okay at just the right moments and not so much that he suffocated us which was great. The busboys also did a great job at refilling our water when we were running low.

THE BEST MEAL OF MY LIFE also the most expensive meal of my life, but then again it was the Omakase (the tasting menu) but my brother took me for my birthday so, also the best treat ever. Everything was made, plated and presented amazingly, everything. It was beautiful. But then again, everything about the place is beautiful. The drinks, the interior, even the bathrooms. The greatest thing about the entire thing though.... my brother called ahead to see if Chef Morimoto would be in and made a reservation for that day. They said he's spend most of his time behind the sushi bar, so that's where my brother made the reservations. I begged my brother to ask Morimoto or the manager for a picture with him since he was walking around taking pictures with a few people but my brother refused. I understood and got a few blurry pictures and was satisfied. HOWEVER, my brother had a little plan. My brother waited for me to get up to go to the bathroom and told Chef Morimoto it was my birthday. When I came back, Morimoto came over, took a picture with us, gave me a hug, and came back moments later with a small plate of birthday treats on a plate that said happy birthday on it. Long story long... Best . Surprise . Ever

Okay, I am a nerd, I am a fangurl for celebrity chefs. ?I watch Iron Chef (both original and American), and now I have eaten at 3 out 5 Iron Chef restaurants! ? Food. -Sushi is fresh and fabulous (as expected). -Kobe beef carpaccio: ?Oooooooooooooohhh myyyyyy gaaaaaaaaaaaaaaadddd. ?It's so good, you will die. -Lamb carpaccio: ?Also fantastic. -Morimoto sashimi: ?Yum! ?Comes with five sauces in little pipettes. -Udon: 3 different kinds as a cold noodle, very refreshing! -Iron chef chicken ramen: ?The broth was sooooooooooooooo smooth and clear. ?Noodles were like silk! ? -Duck, duck, duck: foie gras, roast duck, and duck egg. ?Again, you might die because it's so good. The presentation of the food is ridiculously awesome, which should be expected because, uh--it's Morimoto! ?Drinks were verra good. ?The white lily is fab! ?Ambiance and decor is very shi shi, and almost post modern. ?It's definitely expensive, like most Japanese restos, but if you love food, you need to give it a try!

Amazing food with fun open kitchen so you can be apart of the action! ?Too bad Morimoto was in Japan when we were there! ?Must try the Sea Bass, Surf and Turf - Great portion of food, and MUST MUST TRY OYSTERS WITH FOIE GRAS if you are an oyster fan! ?HEAVEN IN YOUR MOUTH! ?Toro Tartare had a nice presentation but overrated. ?The bim bop is pretty yummy too! ?It's prepared table-side( Korean dish). ?I had the black cod which is usually my favorite fish, but here was just good because it didn't come with anything else except for the fish...boo. ?Best bang for your buck is the surf and turf! ? I didn't like the Morimoto Martini because it was WAY TOO STRONG! ?This is from someone that partied super hard in NYC! lol ?Try the Lychee Martini instead. You definitely have to check out the bathrooms! One of the most fun I've been in! ?Each individual stall has a bidet with tons of buttons to try! ?The background is really zen with cherry blossoms or something in the reflection! ?Very nice touch!

More like 3.5 stars... Today's my first time here at Morimoto. Between me and my friend, the bill came out to be 105 for lunch. We had tuna pizza ($18), chirashi don (32), chef's sashimi assortment (35), and tofu hot and cold dessert (12). The tuna pizza was good, it was something different. I loved the sushi rice in chirashi don and there was definitely quite plenty of sashimi on top. The sashimi assortment was not that impressive, but the quality of fish was decent. The tofu hot and cold dessert came with maple ice cream, tofu souffle, and tofu cheesecake - my fave was to cheesecake - it was subtle yet very flavorful. The service was okay. They were nice but I didn't find impressive. Also the fact that there was a fly flying around our table was also a bit disappointing, but it's okay because the warm toilet seat in the bathroom made up for it, haha. It was a pleasant experience, but not as great as I had expected.

AN IRON CHEF MEAL! The evening started off with a beautiful view of the sunset outside Morimoto...what a pretty sight! I was quickly struck by the cool chic ambiance of the restaurant upon entering the red Japanese door coverings. ?It reminded me of a modern ice sculpture. ?Glass partitions separated dining areas for privacy and noise reduction. ? I tried the omakase and it was phenomenal. ?The food was inventive just like some of the delectables that ?Iron Chef Morimoto create on Iron Chef. ? It was better than Nobu. This is my favorite Japanese restaurant in NYC. ?I HIGHLY recommend it!

It took me a while, but I felt like this place deserves a review. I came here with a friend who really need to splurge on food a little because she was having a bad day. Morimoto is one of her favorite restaurants and she's a true foodie. That said, while this place had some delicious food and the presentation and service was superb, I didn't feel like I could give it a 5, simply because I don't think the level of the food matched up to the prices. We had the hamachi tartare, which was BEAUTIFUL. The presentation was awesome, but the taste was ok. The rolls (yellowtail, california - which has real crab meat btw, salmon, and spicy tuna) were good, but not outstanding. We also had the crispy rock shrimp tempura, which was decent. I rather preferred the wasabi sauce. The seafood toban yaki and the ishi yaki buri bop were both quite good. My friend's addicted to the soup of the toban dish. Everything was very well cooked and tasty, and the presentation, including the ishi yaki, which is cooked at your table, is wonderful. Like I said, I enjoyed my experience, but probably won't come back here. I've had equally good food elsewhere for less money. I do have to say though, I love the decoration and especially the huge kitchen. You get to smell all kinds of yummy things!

Skip the sashimi and rolls. ?You can get that anywhere else for a better value. Go for the beef carpaccio, foie gras and oysters and tartar. ?The unique starter plates are all stellar. You may need to save up for your visit. ?With cocktails and dinner, you'll pay a pretty penny. ?But for a true dining "experience", it'll be worth it.

We had: Beef carpaccio White fish carpaccio Oyster foie gras Soft Shell Crab Roll Rock Shrimp Tempura Sea Bass Halibut something Bob - the stone bowl dish All of it was AMAZING!! ?The oyster foie gras was so rich and tasty. ?The beef carpaccio melts in your mouth. ?I don't know if you can really go wrong at Morimoto but you will have to be prepared to spend the dough.

Morimoto is a very good restaurant. However, when compared to other top chefs' flagship restaurants, it's just okay. The decor is fabulously modern, and I loved the walls of water bottles, which turned something mundane into something beautiful and exotic. I tried the oyster with foies gras and uni, and the morimoto sashimi, since those are the signature dishes. Perhaps I'm too much of a purist but I felt like when you take that many ingredients and throw them together in one dish the distinct and wonderful flavor of each individual item is lost. When I are the first piece of oyster I couldn't taste the uni at all, it was overpowered by the sauce. So I ate the rest piece by piece and the oyster, foies gras, and uni were sublime on their own. They didn't need the heavy-handed eel sauce. The same was true of the sashimi. Why stack salmon, eel, mushroom, yellow, etc together? The flavors are not enhanced by eating them together. I also ordered a few sushi pieces a la carte, and they were all very fresh and tasty. I think my boyfriend had better luck with his dishes, beef carpaccio and the duck. They were well-prepared and delicious. Service was very good and professional, with a great deal of attention to detail.

Morimoto has beautiful chic modern decor. The bathroom by the bar was entertaining, because there were no door knobs so watching people do their pee dance while trying to open the door was pretty darn funny. The food was amazing. I felt like I was sitting at the judging table of Iron Chef. All the dishes we ordered offered so many different textures, and flavors. The presentation of each dish was as beautiful as a work of art. I went with a group of 6 and allowed the waiter to choose the dishes for us. Each dish that came out was interactive, visually intriguing and creative. An example of an interactive dish was the tuna tartar in which the tuna had to be scraped off a wooden block, then put on a cracker, and squeeze different sauces out of a pipette. The tuna pizza was also very creative. I would have given Morimoto 5 stars but we sat at the big long table that seated probably about 20 people with no real dividers. So we were sitting next to strangers and the waiter initially was confused about who was with which party and got the orders all mixed up. In the end the waiter did a fine job. Our group was both satisfied and satiated. The other down side of sitting so close to strangers was that the pack of cougars sitting next to me who were talking about male enhancement drugs, boobs, and how her 15 year old child texted her to see where she was and if she was coming home that night.

I came here for a quiet birthday celebration and totally enjoyed the service, ambiance, and appetizers. I don't think I've ever witnessed such machine-like efficiency at a restaurant - everyone was calmly bustling around with a benevolent smile on their faces. I ended up ordering a ton of food for two people, and unfortunately left no room for dessert: + ginger lemonade + snap dragon cocktail + rock shrimp tempura + steamed scallops + chef's combination sushi, which included clam, shrimp, tuna, etc. + yellowtail seared in a stone bowl, over rice The rock shrimp tempura and steamed scallops, our appetizers, were fresh and flavorful. They were like explosions!...But I think that their intense taste skewed my opinion of the sushi and yellowtail rice bowl, which weren't that impressive. Our server had emphasized how Morimoto shaped the 'chef's choice' (a tasting menu), so I probably just ordered mismatched items. Anyhoo, I'm totally up for a 'next time'! (Nobu 57 is still my favorite fancy pants restaurant...)

From my opinion, Appertizers here are the best. I know that it is not right when I come here and always order almost everything from the Appertizer list, neither entree nor sushi, but I can't help it. The Appertizers are pretty impressive in both tasting and presenting aspects. These tiny dishes deserve an upscale level. Main courses are very basic. I Would rank them at the quality of food chain restaurants. Sushi is the worst here. It is not worst like uneatable. At the upscale level, this kind of quality is unacceptable. The rice was dry and hard. The fillings are very ordinary. The service was awsome. After all, my recommendation would be order more of appertizers. You will like it.

The atmosphere is fun. ?We came here with a large group and they gave us a private room. ?I couldn't eat the raw bar which was the first course but that was fine since the salad and "angry chicken" plus dessert of apple bread pudding was more than enough to fill me up. ?I really enjoyed the angry chicken (chicken in a spicy sauce). ?I also tried the steak which was in an au jus sauce - tasty!

Uber-cool bastion of THE Iron Chef, the quasi-mythical Morimoto san. Room is beautiful if a bit stark at times, but the crowd is hopping and packed with cool kids of every age. The food was utterly magical, though the oma-kase is overpriced to the point of inhibiting its enjoyment. I had the totally original Toro Tartare, and perhaps the best piece of sea bass I've ever eaten. Service was ok, but indifferent in spots and pushy in others. Go with the sake flight, it's a no-brainer. Bottom line: Go for the food. ?A special place, worth a visit, especially with a dining companion who appreciates culinary genius and is willing to overlook the little things to get it.

This was one of my best dining experiences ever!!! ?Went down to the bar and started with a White Lily cocktail. ?Talk about dessert in a martini glass!! ?Here's how we broke it down course by course: cold appetizer: ?The buffalo mozarella sashimi was spot on in flavor and presentation. ?Fine details like mirco-basil atop a melt in your mouth slice of fresh salmon and mozarella = Perfection! ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? hot appetizer: ?rock shrimp tempura was perfectly fried and light. ?The 2 kinds of sauce (wasabi aioli and a sweeter sauce) displayed a nice yin and yang (pun intended) combination of flavors. ? main: The whole roasted lobster "epice" was cooked and spiced perfectly!! The addition of the lemon creme fraiche was a smart and inventive replacement to traditional clarified butter as well as a nice accompaniment the robust flavor of the garam masala. ?Small bites of roasted vegetables (beets, cauliflower, carrots) were delicious as well. ? We also had the most amazing brussels sprouts I've ever had!! ?I am not kidding! ?I could've eaten 5 pounds of these suckers, slightly charred, a little savory, a little sweet...if only they were served this tasty as I child I might have enjoyed them then. ? dessert: ?hot and cold tofu was absolutely decadent. ?A small serving each of soy milk souffle, tofu cheesecake, and maple ice cream with maple syrup! I'm glad we decided on the house dessert special as we usually don't order dessert. Overall, the service was attentive, timely, and kind from the hostess to the bartender and wait staff. Other reviewers complained about rude and snobby staff, but we didn't ?experience that at all and my gf and I are in no way, shape, or form upper class or elitist diners. ?Just a teacher and a public servant from California looking for a lovely late night dinner while on vacation in New York. ? Mission accomplished!!

A beautiful space and perfect food. ?Everyone talks about the toro tartare and it was as good as everyone says. ?The service was a little spacey but I can't even remove a star for it because the food was so well done. ?We had the omakase, which was terrific, but we might order individual dishes next time.

This was one of the best dining experiences I have ever had..and that is saying something. ?We had a wonderful server and a great table tucked away. ?I love the open kitchen concept and I was lucky enough to see Morimoto himself in action PLUS meet him! ?This place is amazing...pricey but worth every single penny! ?It's right next to my other favorie spot, the Chelsea Market. ?When I lived in the West Village I would walk up there all the time. ?I miss NYC and hopefully when I visit I can go back to Morimoto!!!!

My brother and his gf took me here for my bday dinner on a Sunday night and the ambiance was pretty mellow and serene. Highlights: --The downstairs bathroom. Even though we didn't know what half of the buttons and levers that had "ikea instructions"-like illustrations did on the toilet, the multiple butt wash options and heated seat feature made for an amusing and giggly trip. --Food (in Rank order) Appetizers: 1) Whitefish carpaccio, 2) Scallops, 3) Tie: Tuna pizza cold appetizer and Spicy King Crab Entrees/other: 1) Black Cod entree, 2) the side of green gyozas that come with the Lamb dish | 3) the lamb itself, 4) Surf and Turf The Salmon ravioli appetizer wasn't as good as I'd expect it to be and the chicken ramen was good but average. I had an apple pastry-type dessert with cotton candy on top that was also tasty and looked pretty, but don't think I'd order it a second time.

I had a fabulous meal here at Morimoto: seared black cod fish (their signature dish) a beef tartare and a seafood stew that was incredible. The portions are larger than you'd expect for the trendy, sleek restaurant. While it's huge, you can still feel like you have your own space. It's not cheap but you pay for what you get.

It's just okay - I was hoping that it would be better. ?We had erratic service (waited 40 mins for our table despite having a res, our appetizers all came out at different times) and our food was fine, not great. ? It's got the big, splashy NY-marquee chef restaurant du jour vibe, which makes it fun for a big group or out of town guests. ?I was really surprised by ?how affordable it was, and granted that could be because we passed on the chef's tasting menu, but still. ?Dinner for 4, including a round of drinks, and entrees/sushi (no dessert - we were too full plus nothing sounded that exciting) was less than $250 including tax and tip. Make sure to bring a shawl or coat! ?This part of 10th Ave right by the river is like a giant wind tunnel - we almost got blown away while getting a cab.

We had a great evening out here. The staff was friendly and accommodating and even gave us a corner table along the wall for more room and privacy. The interior had a chilled out feel with the lights setting the right tone. The service was excellent, thought around 2045hrs, it seemed to drop a bit due to peak dinner time. Appetizers: Edamame - cooked well with right amount seasoning Lobster fritters - yummy, i have an additcion to fired food so naturally these could not have gone wrong Not sure of the name, but they make fresh tofu on the table. Was not good as the Tofu had not set as expected and they were more than happy to change it for another dish, was similar to the Bi Bim Bop, which was a big hit. The sushi was excellent and my lady, being a vegetarian, had them make a vegetable roll, not on the menu, and she loved it and said it was one of the better ones she has ever had and it made her day. The icing was seeing Chef Morimoto in the kitchen and being a celeb chef, he was kind enough to take picture with the patrons, yes we did get a pic with him :)

Loved this place. The food presentation was unique and the restaurant itself is pretty cool - especially the downstairs bathroom, which I'll get to later. We started out with a cocktail, of course - I ordered the white lily which was a milky white, refreshingly delicious drink. We began with the toro tartare - at first I thought it was just a bowl of garnishes to eat with the rest of our dishes lol. Turns out the little wood board that was stuck sideways in the bowl of crushed ice was the toro, and the tray of garnishes - including wasabi, avocado, seaweed sauce (sounds gross but it was good), sour cream, chives and little crunchy things - made the rest of the "tartare". IT WAS DELICIOUS. Next we ordered the crispy rock shrimp. These are amazing.. but VERY RICH. We couldn't eat more than 2-3 pieces. The dipping sauce was also delicious. The sushi was awesome.. especially the waygu sushi. Finally, we got the braised black cod with the miso reduction. To ?tell you the truth it was too much. I'm not a fan of rich fish like butter fish, etc and after the rock shrimp, it was just wayyy too much. On ?the way out we went downstairs to check out the bathrooms we had heard so much about. Loved it! Euro style toilets that automatically open... and the back wall of the stall is a floor to ceiling mirror with endless cherry blossoms reflecting. Too cute :) All in all though it was an awesome meal and we would definitely go back.

We went to Morimoto on New Year's Eve this past year (12/31/09) and really enjoyed ourselves. We arrived at 7:45 for our 8:15 dinner and figured we'd just go down to the bar but instead, our table was ready and we were seated immediately. Had a great view of the open-air kitchen as well as the glass-bottle wall. Really a beautiful contemporary design throughout the entire restaurant. We had decided to go with the omakase since we had never been to the restaurant before. I'm writing this review almost a month after the meal so forgive my light descriptions as I unfortunately don't remember every single detail. ?We did order a bottle of cold, unfiltered sake which was also delicious. On top of that, the waiter came around with a complimentary glass of champagne. Nice touch, if a bit expected. New Year's Eve Omakase: 1) Morimoto Bagel: House baked bagel with yellowtail pastrami and a green aioli. For a bunch of jews, this was an unexpected way to start out our evening and helped to get us into the mood for the rest of the evening. The bagel was probably the size of a lenders or so and soft and doughy. Pastrami'd yellowtail was delicious and a nice twist. 2) Toro Tartare: Simply put, outstanding. I won't go into much detail on this one because everyone on this site has something to say about it. All I will say is that I found a new taste with every bite and never a dull one. 3) Salad course: Red Snapper with light yuzu sauce and micro-greens. The 2-3 bites of fish were cooked perfectly. Nothing too exciting here but tasty none-the-less. 4) Beef Wagyu: 5 silver-dollar size pieces of Beef Wagyu topped with hot oils, scallions and an Asian sauce I wish I could describe. Meat was extremely succulent and flavorful despite being not that big. Could have eaten just 20-30 pieces of this as my meal and been fat-tastically satisfied. If you come to Morimoto (or Nobu or any similar place for that matter), try the wagyu. So delicious. 5) One piece of bigeye tuna sushi with beef consume: This one was a bit of a head scratch-er at first as I didn't really see how the tuna and beef consume were supposed to go together. The piece of sushi was a part of a roll that was put together in the shape of a square, with cube cut cucumbers in each corner, a diamond of the tuna in the middle, half inch long pieces of cucumber coming out of the diamond and rice filled the rest. Beautiful presentation no doubt, wish I had taken a picture of it. But the taste wasn't really anything to write home about. ?I tried dipping it into the beef broth as the server suggested but that didn't really help. The only real miss of the night for me. 6) Crab Ravioli: Solid if unspectacular. What you expect from a ravioli filled with crab. 7) Half-Lobster with Lemon Yogurt/whipped cream: Cajun-spiced (didn't see that one coming did you) half lobster came with body and one large claw of the lobster. Meat was tender and succulent. I don't know if it was a yogurt or a whipped cream, but it was heavier than a whipped cream and lighter than a yogurt. Either way, delicious. A nice departure from the lemon wedge squeeze with just enough lemon taste as to not offend. 8) Quarter-inch tall, half-inch wide, 6 inch long piece of Cheesecake, topped with 4 strawberries with raspberry sorbet and strawberry pop rocks on the side: Think of the cheesecake as the size of a ruler topped with strawberries, best way to describe it. ?Sorbet was bursting with flavor. And when you ate the pop rocks with the strawberry and cheesecake and sorbet all together it was almost like drinking strawberry champagne as the pop rocks gave off that effervescent feel to it. Delicious all the way through. Even after 7 courses prior we still both ate our entire portions here. One thing to note is while you're there, definitely check out the bathrooms after a few drinks. Trust. ?You'll stand in the stall laughing to yourself for at least 2.5 minutes. Another thing I wanted to point out to people that have written reviews already regarding the prices. It's expensive. ?There is no question that this restaurant is overpriced and not for those looking for a cheap/quick meal. You're paying as much for the food as you are for the name on the menu. However, in my opinion, the price is always secondary to the flavor. You got to a restaurant to have an experience and to eat some (hopefully) delicious food. To that end, there is no question that what you pay for is what you get. Delicious food prepared elegantly in a setting that will wow even the most chilled of hearts.

Morimoto's appetizers + drinks + overly enthusiastic waitress = an amazing experience. ? Most memorable appetizers: 1. Our waitress recommended a "special" toro sushi roll that wasn't on the menu and the roll was memorable and AMAZING! ? 2. We also got another sushi appetizer that had thin layers of different sushi and test tubes with sauces to taste with them...I was skeptical at first because I thought the test tube idea was a bit odd but it was suprisingly yummy!

Service is outstanding, food was good, Sea Bass was excellent and I mean really excellent, Toro tartare was good BUT for the price, I don't know if I'd recommend it, the seafood toban yaki was not good! we had a couple of rolls and they were also excellent, drinks were delicious so overall it was good. BUT, once again, for the price, I didn't really feel it matched considering it was $186 for 2. The thing that made me a little bit angry was that on our way out, the hostess and the manager whom we had seen all night did not bother to say good night or thank you! That costs 1 star, I'm sorry for a meal that expensive and in this economy, I expect a Thank You or Good Night, not blank stares, ? HOSPITALITY HOSPITALITY starts from the door and doesn't finish till you say good night or thank you, come again!!!

Came here for the $24 lunch special during restaurant week and I have to admit, it wasn't outstanding. Had the wagyu beef special (there were only 3 choices for restaurant week, wagyu beef, black cod, or vegetarian) and the box consisted of 1 slice of beef, 3 pieces of sushi, and 3 pieces of spicy tuna roll. The beef was prepared with a teriyaki glaze that masked the quality of the beef but at least the bento box came complete with a silken tofu miso soup and salad. The ambiance is nice, gorgeous new age decor that exuded a sense of classy professionalism. ?The restroom was impressively equipped with Japanese 'equipment' but that was about the most Japanese the place got. I would classify this restaurant as more fusion than Japanese. I glanced at the drinks list, pretty impressive albeit slightly overpriced. The Morimoto tea was deliciously infused with tea. I think I would have enjoyed the regular menu more than the consolidated prefixed menu offered during restaurant week. That said, if Restaurant Week was a means to attract more new diners then unfortunately it missed the mark.

Great food and drinks. It's good for groups and couples...i like the decor. However, the waitress could be a little more attentive. For example, i went with a small group and when ordering more drinks, she took one order and just walked away. We had to call her back over because there were empty cocktail glasses and there were other drinks we wanted also. Usually when a cocktail is low, don't they come up to you and ask if you would enjoy another? Hum. But it's okay. Regardless we had a good time and left with full tummies (get the desserts there! So yum!)

Back in 2008, Morimoto's was probably my favourite restaurant in NYC. Most recently, I took my girlfriend there when she visited New York, and it was somewhat disappointing given how much I had liked it in the past. We ordered two appetizers, two entrees and one desert: Toro Tartar: ?I didn't feel anything special about the tartar; sure, the caviar added saltiness and texture, but in the end, it was just ground tuna. ?I actually didn't like any of the condiments except the soy sauce and maybe the seaweed paste. ?Everything else just seemed gimmicky, and didn't really complement the flavours of the fish. Oysters with uni, and foie gras: This dish sounds much better than it actually was. ?Each of the component was very well done, but the binding agent - the teriyaki sauce - was so strong, it completely masked everything, I could barely taste the luxuriousness and unctuous uni and foie. ?I might as well be eating bread soaked in the sauce. Sea bass: this was by far the best thing I had all night. ?The fish was perfectly cooked, and the proportion was very generous. ?No complaints. Seafood Tobanyaki: this was also very well done, although slightly too buttery and salty. ?The shrimps and scallops were cooked perfectly; something that's not easy to do given how all the ingredients take different lengths to cook. Apple Turbine: Thinly sliced apples arranged in the shape of a turbine: extremely creative and very tasty. On a side note, my girlfriend really enjoyed their Water Lilly. Perhaps my appreciation for food had changed drastically in the past two years; perhaps my one-year stay in Japan had forever spoiled North American seafood; in any case, it almost pains me to give this restaurant a three star, but I feel this is what it truly deserves.

I read the reviews, listened to our waitress....... Rock shrimp, roasted trout...... I wish I could say it was better than it was. I'd give it a 3 out of 10. Very sweet food in general.

This is definitely one of my most favorite japanese restaurants in the country!! QUICK NOTES: *The inside of the restaurant had a very aesthetic decor and very trendy atmosphere. *As expected, the fish was extremely fresh. *Foie Gras Chiramusi melts in your mouth. *Raw lobster was perfectly prepared. ?It was not too raw to the point where it was blue and not to overcooked to the point it was tough to eat. OVERALL: If you love japanese food and fresh raw fish, you MUST try restaurant!

If I could visit any 'celebrity chef's' restaurant I have always said it would be Morimoto hands down. ?I couldn't imagine I wouldn't be 100% in love with everything and I was right. ?If I was a crazy foodie dining experience stickler I could mention a few operational things that I wouldn't expect of a restaurant of this caliber, including a broken lock in the bathroom, but I would rather my food come with a smile that be placed just so in front of me. ?The fact is the set up of our table wasn't conducive to an easy serve for the wait staff. ?But for a restaurant like this to experience the friendliness of the staff, from the time of the confirmation phone call up to my party asking for a hostess to take out family picture at the end of the meal, everyone was extremely sweet and accommodating. ? Now the food. ?We ordered a spicy tuna roll with the appetizers and as I said immediately, "Thanks, Mr. Morimoto, for ruining sushi for me anywhere else." Almost a week later it's all I can think about. ?The lobster fritters were a big hit, with the less adventurous eaters at the table and the amateur foodies. ?The smoked salmon ravioli was fishier than we had hoped but the salad with tuna flakes was a stunner. ?The sashimi appetizer with its tubes of sauce is served as little layered cubes of fish and in order to really swoon over it, we ate each piece separately, salivating over every last bite. ?I tried the black cod, steak, chicken and Chilean sea bass for the main course and can say hands down, the Chilean sea bass is the best I've ever had. ?The steak was tender, juicy and full of flavor, again pandering to the most inexperienced palettes and the most eager palettes all at once. ?The chicken was delicious but had a significant kick to it. ?The black cod was very good and the person next to me preferred that above the sea bass, but to me there was no contest. The lychee martinis were satisfying and sweet but nothing prepared me for the dessert. ?I only wish I had more room in my belly! ?Flourless chocolate cake with caramel covered popcorn? ?Amazing. ?I'm just counting the moments until I can return to you, Morimoto, please keep a self-cleaning, heated toilet seat warm for me!

I remember eating at Morimoto once a few years ago, I think sometimes in 2007 or 2008. Yeah it is a long while ago... *lol* I had dinner at this restaurant with a few college friends. I remember the atmosphere was great and spacey, the services was awesome, and the food was delicious. I can't remember what my friends had order but I remember they comment their food were delicious. =P I had order the "Angry Chicken" which was very good. Pricey yes, but it is an experience. I met Chef Morimoto while eating dinner with my friends the same night. Chef Morimoto was very friendly and chat with us for a short moment. He took individuals and a group picture with my friends and I. It was a great night for my friends and I. Even if I didn't get to meet Chef Morimoto, I would like to go back there again for the good food and great services.

I really hate to give Morimoto's signature restaurant 3 stars, but the food was subpar. I'm a huge fan of Morimoto, so I was really looking forward to an iron chef experience when I visited NY. The decor of the restaurant was very modern with a good vibe to it. However, I was not impressed with the food. I ordered sushi, the rice was very hard - it tasted half cooked. I heard people had wonderful experiences ordering omakase. Next time I go, if I see Morimoto, that's what I'll have.

This is a cool place to eat and have chef morimoto sightings. I've been here twice, and had the same entree both times, although I should have tried something different the second time. Ordered the Ishi yaki "buri bop" which was amazing, mainly because of the sauce used in the dish. Chilean sea bass was buttery and melt in your mouth good. toro tartar is good and a fun app to try. I was really impressed by the decor and the lighting here. Just a really nice atmosphere to enjoy and dinner or drinks later on. A must try.

I'm not a fan of "name recognition" restaurants, but Morimoto was a pleasant surprise. The food was good, Morimoto himself was in the house (at the sushi bar wearing khaki shorts and sneakers) and the service was impeccable. My friends and I went with the omakase chef's tasting menu. If you don't like seafood, then you shouldn't eat here period. The first course was mashed toro in a striking presentation: a 4x2" bamboo box with about 1/2" of depth; 2/3 of the box was the toro while the last 1/3 was filled with "stripes" of different toppings: fresh wasabe, creme fraiche, an intense nori paste, chives, avocado, and tiny rice ball crackers. Morimoto seems to favor sweetness in his dishes as reflected in the sauces served with his kobe beef with sweet potato dish and his salmon with terriyaki. Seafood courses included a lobster halved, cooked with garam masala (a bit odd) and served with a light lemon creme fraiche on the side, and a selection of nigiri. I enjoyed his raw octopus/scallop/clam salad as the octopus was the perfect consistency and the dressing was light with delicate flavors (shoyu and some kind of vinegar and oil among others). The last was a large cooked oyster with a bit of cooked uni and seared foie gras. All the ingredients were quite fresh, but the final dessert course left something to be desired: a redbean cake with peach sorbet topped with a lavender sugar garnish and apricots and asuki beans on the side. I love Asian desserts as a whole, but this one was unremarkable. The venue itself is very modernly trendy: some striking whitewashed wood boards along the seating areas, glass-like flooring and stairways, dim lighting except for the sushi bar. Reservations don't really seem to be necessary on weeknights as the restaurant wasn't at capacity the entire time we were there.

Ok, I agree with the previous posters...the bathrooms are worth a trip if you're dining here. But, back to the food & service: The staff out front were great, as was Gene the bartender (a great sense of humor). ?The waitress was a little snobby to start with, but seemed to warm up as we demonstrated knowledge of wine, saki and japanese food. We ordered the tasting menu at $120 each (so maybe the waitress sensed a big tip and amped up her service accordingly). ?It was spectacular and a lot more food than I anticipated. ?Each dish was beautifully presented, of the highest quality ingredients and included complex flavors. ?Dishes were nicely paced...not rushed and not too slow which was impressive since the restaurant was packed. We had a great evening of beautiful, delish food. ?I would absolutely return and order off the menu to explore more dishes.

My last lunch in the city was actually at Morimoto's. My fellow coworker told me it was the "iron chef's" restaurant and so we went one very empty weekday morning. The experience was great. The lunch special was very decently priced (I was expecting and willing to drop big bucks for my last day in NYC), and I could not even finish all of the sushi that was served. Service was good, and should I say, the restrooms also very good as well?? Very much reminded me of my times in Taiwan and Japan!!

For my 100th review, I wanted to make sure that it was special. ?And it was! I chose Morimoto's for my 100th review because I had an excellent experience. ?Unfortunately, I was not hungry at all when I got there so I didn't have a full meal. ?But the service, ambiance, the easiness of making a reservation was pretty much 5 stars. I felt bad because all day long I kept switching my reservations. I kept saying "I'm SOO sorry, but I have to change our reservation again!" ?They were completely professional and made the changes without being rude. ?Our party got bigger, then smaller and then bigger again. I was impressed that they were not snooty and annoyed at me because I called 3-4 times on the day of the dinner! When we sat down, we noticed that our table was right next to the front doors and every time it opened, we'd get a burst of cold air. ?My girlfriend and I were sitting at the very edge, so when it got to be unbearable, we asked if we could move. ?The manager was more than sweet and she moved us down without making a fuss. ?Nice! Our food came out in a timely manner and it was pretty delicious! I started with the rock shrimp appetizer and a couple others got this lobster/crab appetizer. Both were delicious! ?When our dishes came out, a very apologetic waiter came to my hubs and said that his filet came out too overcooked so that they are cooking it again at the moment. ?That was surprising to me because they cared so much on making it exactly the way he had requested. ?So instead of being annoyed for his food not coming out on time, my hubs picked on our plates and was fine knowing that it was on its way to be made perfect. When his filet came out, the waiter apologized again. ?The filet was DELICIOUS. Worth the wait. Melted like butter in your mouth. ?Also, my friend's black cod was amazing!! Everyone should definitely get that as their first dish----I highly recommend it!! Let me tell you the best part of the night... We got to meet THE Iron Chef!! We saw him greeting other tables and wondered if he'd come by ours. ?A waiter told us a couple times that he would come by our table so we got really nervous and wondered if he'd take a picture with us. He came by and shook every single one of our hands with a big smile. When we asked to take a picture, he said "Sure!" He made us all say "Sushi!" to the camera. ?My friend, who is a crazy huge fan of his, really wanted a 1-1 picture with him and he was totally for it. He even made bunny ears in the picture! What an adorable and kind man. ?I totally support his restaurant and would love to come back for more! I love how he cared enough to come around each table on a Saturday night and take pictures with a group of random people. ?That is my type of fine dining!

I just went there tonight for my best friend's birthday. We wanted to treat ourselves something good and of course we were pleased. I got home and I cant go to bed without yelping it first. It was one great experience for me. I do love the place a lot. We had "white lilly" cocktail, which was absolutely great! I actually ordered something else first and it was kind of bad. I informed the waitress that then she replaced my drink with white lilly, which was so good. ? We ordered one hot app and one cold app. The tartar with cavier and all those japanese dip was soooo good! seriously, tartar was so smooth and light..gosshh I still want some more! ?For hot app, we had spicy king crab. It was also good. Spicy and tasty. However I felt that it's just a tiny bit salty though. We, 2 ladies, didn't try any main dishes because we wanted to keep it light. Instead, we had shrimp tempura maki, which wasn't that special. I was debating to myself I should give this place 4 or 5 stars. I feel like it's more like 4.5 stars. We had such a fantastic experience for dinner but dessert wasn't that impressive. The coconut panna cotta was good but chocolate cake was bad. We thought that they could have done better. The cake was too dry and bitter. However, hot green tea i had with dessert was so light and smooth. I love it. It is a place to go if you want good food. Yes, it's pricey but the ingredients are very good quality. I feel its worth my money. I will go back next time with my boyfriend then I'll order the Omasake that costs 120 per person and I will let my bf pay for it ;)

Sorry guys, this place is just not that impressive. If I was giving it points for the coolness of the bathroom, the hip decor, and the vibe, I would give it 4 stars. But this is about the food. In sum - very plain (relative to its high end peers in the city). Mind you, I think Nobu is even worse so if you a re Nobu lover, this is an upgrade to that. The rock shrimp tempura that everyone raves about? Very good, but not mind blowing or even great. The toro tartare? Pretty, yes, but very small quantity wise and so-so quality wise. If I wanted to see art and be hungry afterwards, I could go to the Met. The duck duck duck? Mediocre at best. The soups? Ditto. Overall, nothing here was a WOW dish in my mind, so you are paying wow prices for a pretty bathroom and seeing pretty people eating pretty but mediocre dishes. If that's what you want, come here, but personally, call me crazy, I prefer superb food and excellent service as the two core values of my meal.

You disappoint me Chef. ?I mean, really disappointed me. ?THIS was NOT Iron Chef caliber food. ?This was decent but extremely high priced stuff that I can get just about any sushi place in LA. ?I paid less at Nobu and got much better, more in quantity, and more in creativity. ?Wife and I both got the omakase. ?We should have just ordered off the menu. ?Think we would have been happier. ?Honestly nothing spectacular to write about from the app to desert. ?Gets a "meh" from me as ratings go. But the decor's nice, and his own brand of sake was pretty good.

Went here with my boyfriend initially to try Fugu but the waitress talked us into doing the Chef's Choice (Omakase) that included a fugu dish along with the drink pairing to match each course. We had 8 courses including dessert which were presented to us amazingly! The food portions were small but we were full by the end. I don't know what it costs to go and just order individual items but our bill for the Chef's Choice (with Fugu) with the Drink pairing and one round of cocktails was $550. If you do opt for the Chef's Choice be sure ?to bring $$$ and have 3-3.5 hours to kill. The decor is gorgeous, the bathrooms are cool, the staff is great. While you're in there you'll feel like an elite socialite.

As with everyone else, I went during restaurant week. ?When else can you ?afford to eat in an original Iron Chef's restaurant?? But surprisingly, I ended up not ordering from the RW menu, and got the black cod bento box instead, which was about the same price ($26) but had a lot more items to sample. ?The tempura was pretty damn awesome because it had a mayo-ginger-something sauce. ?The black cod was the size of my thumb, but what a great thumb sized piece of fish. ?I'd say that I would go to Morimoto again, sans RW, because: 1. the bento box was a great deal 2. the toilets may have been the most awesome thing my tush has ever sat on 3. we got to meet morimoto outside, smoking, and tell him how great his food was, cause i'm sure he cared about as much as that thumb sized piece of fish

Omakase. ?Borderline worth the $120/person price, but hey it's NYC. The toro tartare was great. ?I had fun scraping puree'd fish off a wooden plank. ?The one part of the omakase that I didn't feel met expectations was the Nigiri platter. ?All standard fish, albeit good quality, it was still Nigiri. ?No crazy, adventurous fish or anything, which is kind of what I was expecting. Very stylish and trendy- dress nice else feel out of place.

This location exudes modern ambience like walking into a modern art museum. ?Uncluttered, it makes you feel at ease while eating your meal. ?I've been to the Philadelphia location and it's a cozy joint. ?Food was exceptional (the omakase) in Philadelphia but the one in NYC is just as good but with better ambience. For $24.07 prix fixe - what a steal!...you get high quality food without making you feel overstuffed. ?The coconut panna cotta with passion fruit gelee is OUTTA OF THIS WORLD... OMG DELICIOUS! ? and for the clean-up, do check out the bathroom downstairs, as you walk in, the lid opens by itself upon your presence and there's a bunch of buttons to push for all sorts of cleansing and then it flushes by itself without a huge sounding whoosh.

Morimoto is a feast for all the senses. I went here for the first time on 1/22/10 to celebrate my birthday with my GF. We arrived at 7:10 for our 7:30 reservation and were seated promptly. By just looking around the restaurant, you can tell you're in for an excellent experience. The decoration is modern chic; artistic without being pretentious. There is a large glass bottle wall in the middle of the restaurant that serves as a sort of centerpiece. The kitchen is open glass so, if you're close enough, you can watch the chefs prepare your meal. If you venture downstairs, you will find a few more tables with a fully stocked bar. We started our course with 2 appetizers to share. The first was the Wagyu Beef Carpaccio. The dish was thinly sliced Wagyu beef that was served with hot oil and a yuzu sauce (yuzu is a Japanese citrus fruit). The beef melted in your mouth and was nothing short of perfectly tender. The yuzu sauce added a nice acidity and the hot oil didn't overwhelm the delicate flavor of the beef. Unfortunately, I felt that the dish had a bit too much salt that took away from the natural beauty of the Wagyu beef. The next appetizer was the Tuna Pizza. This was actually my favorite dish of the evening. It is a thin flour tortilla that is baked so that it is crispy. It is layered with thinly sliced, sashimi-style, sushi grade tuna served raw. Upon the tuna you will find diced black olives and halved cherry tomatoes. To finish it off, it is drizzled with a garlic aioli sauce. The textures of everything was like a symphony in my mouth. The buttery texture of the tuna mixed with the crunch of the tortilla and the crisp bite of the tomato made for a wonderful culinary experience. The garlic aioli was nicely seasoned and didn't detract from the overall freshness of the dish. For my main course, I had the Seafood Toban Yaki. This was a combination of scallops, shrimp, lobster, crab, and mussels in a dark broth. The seafood was cook perfectly (with the slight exception of the mussels which were a bit rubbery) and all were seasoned properly. The broth added a ton of flavor to each element of seafood and was subtle enough to be drank as a soup if desired. My GF got 2 appetizers as her entree which consisted of the Spicy Crab and the Pork Gyoza. The Spicy Crab was excellent. They didn't skimp on the amount of crab that was delivered and each piece was as fresh as one would expect from a restaurant of this caliber. The spicy sauce had a nice kick and melded nicely with the freshness of the crab. The Pork Gyoza was nice as well, though I didn't feel it was something that couldn't be found elsewhere. This was actually the only dish that I tried that evening that I thought could have been more inventive or unique. Don't get me wrong; it was very tasty, but I just felt it was missing something to really make it pop. For dessert, we shared a piece of the Sesame Hazelnut Layer Cake. This was a thrill for the taste buds and something that you will assuredly not find in many other restaurants. It was a Hazelnut sponge cake that was layered with white chocolate, green tea chocolate, and sesame seeds. It was topped with a mandarin-plum sake sorbet which was amazing. The dish, as a whole, was utterly unique and complex enough to entertain your palate till the last bite. Overall, our service was top notch and we were never left with an empty water glass or an empty drink. The waiter, while attentive, was not overbearing and stopped by at appropriate times to check up on us. I would highly recommend Morimoto to anyone who enjoys Japanese cuisine and is looking for a unique take on an otherwise traditional cuisine. On the other hand, don't go unless you're wallet is willing to take a bit of a bruising. After all was said and done, our dinner for two amounted to about $225 including tax and tip. If you can afford it, you will have yourself a meal to remember.

I don't know if Restaurant Week is really the best way to analyze a place. ?Luckily and surprisingly for us, Morimoto does not offer Restaurant Week specials during dinner... So when it came to getting a good sample of Morimoto's fare, the $120 omakase was intriguing, but well beyond what I planned to spend on the evening. ?There are plenty of entrees for around $30 though (they drop the Iron Chef name in the menu once or twice). ?My group ordered a few different dishes, including a pair of "Duck Duck Duck's." ?That's duck on its own, plus a duck on croissant sandwich. ?It came with a couple sauces, all interesting to try but we all gravitated toward using just one... ?There were also some good seafood dishes, raw or otherwise. ?I thought the ramen was nothing special. ?Overall, worth going back for more when I'm in a spendy mood. With regard to what comes free with the meal... ?The restaurant does have an interesting design. ?Glass walls separate rows of tables, which I guess is marginally more privacy than you get in a normal open restaurant floor. ?Helps make for a distinctive dining experience.

Came here for my girlfriend and buddy's birthdays tonight. Had nothing but a good experience here this evening and the food was excellent. The waitress was great and friendly... only one thing that got overlooked was my glass of port. But that was understandable since everytime I saw her trying to walk, other patrons would pull her aside. Tonight was definitely a crazy night and I can't imagine being a waiter/waitress on night's like these. kudos to her for doing a good job tonight and making sure my gf and my friend had a great time. Now on to the food. We had a party of 6 so we started off with some appetizers. We got some Chu-Toro sashimi, morimoto sashimi, and crispy rock shrimp tempura. The sashimi dishes were top notch and the shrimp tempura was different but really awesome. For our entrees, the two birthday people both ordered the omakase. I ordered the black cod with a side of bok choy. I woldnt say the black cod was the best I have ever had... but it was really good. There was too much sauce so the sweetness of the sauce overwhelmed the taste of the fish. I had to eat the fish with rice so the rice would negate some of the sweetness from their sauce. The texture of the fish was near perfect and the side of bok choy complimented my fish perfectly. I had a few bites from the omakase courses and I just have ?say that they were amazing. Next time I am in town and I am at Morimoto's, I will definitely order that. All in all, everyone had a blast.... the birthday people both had a memorable experience, and we all left feeling like we needed to be carted out in a wheel barrel since we were all too full. PS - sinks in the bathroom.... they aren't motion sensored so you actually had to touch a certain area of the faucet so the water would run. Took me a few to figure that out haha.

I am normally a hater of Asian fusion and celebrity chefs, so I must admit that I was guarded with Morimoto's. ?I did walk away pleasantly surprised and would totally go back for another round (even though it is ridiculously expensive. ?Why? ?Well, Morimoto was able to deliver a better version of many Japanese classics. ? The ubiquitous miso soup was packed with flavor and had a surprising smoky taste that was perfect and better than any miso soup I have ever had. ?The tempura was light and crispy and was served with a rich hollandaise-like sauce which again added a unique richness to balance with the lightness of the tempura. ?In a weird way, I appreciated the effort put into taking some of the heaviness out of the fried part and putting it back in with a more flavor in the sauce. ?The miso ?cod (which has to be one of the most done up and tired Asian Fusion dish) was actually really good. ?He managed to set himself above every other place with this same dish. ? The sushi was very fresh which you can get at other places, but this place has precision cuts which makes it more visually appealing. ?They also used really meaty slices and lots of fish in the rolls. ?Is it worth the premium, well that would be up to you, but there is value added here. ? The dessert was amazing. ?This is where I saw real innovation. ?We had a tofu souflee and tofu cheesecake with a coffee maple sauce. ?In classic Asian fashion the dessert was not overly sweet, so you can really taste the ingredients. ?The lightness of the souflee using soy was truly amazing. ?The cheesecase had a rich palate feel like traditional cheesecake, but did not sit in your stomach like a brick (as with traditional cheesecake). ?It was also not very sweet. ?You could add as much of the coffee maple sauce as you wanted for the sweetness. ?This was a really nice touch. ? The service was attentive and the atmosphere was over the top cool with a lot of thoughtfulness. They used ?spotted glass panels do divide up the dining room. ?This gave a sense of intimacy while allowing the light and the vibe of the restaurant to flow through. ?This kind of attention to detail is the differentiator here. ?On top of all this, I saw Morimoto himself walk out of the kitchen to wash some vegis. ?It may have been for show, but it is comforting to know that he is actually involved in the creation of the food in some way rather than just slapping his name on the door (as with many of the celebrity chef places you go to). ?Four stars for a really great experience. ?I would need to see the innovation across more of the menu to justify the astronomical prices to give it the 5 star treatment.

Ok, so i really really wish i could have given Morimotos 5stars, except there were two minor issues: 1. werent aware that the chefs tasting menu wasn't served all night (this is our fault though, we came at the last minute almost an hour before closing) 2. The sushi wasnt rememberable (unfortunately there was nothing special about the sushi, but then again it was late) So, on the the good stuff!! First, service! Our waiter was excellent, guiding us kindly through our overwhelment of the menu. After the disappointment of not being in time for the tasting menu, he offered up some appetizer choices that were usually featured on it. Here is what we had: 1. Toro TarTare (A must have, one of the craziest presentations ever--moto in chicago excluded, lol-- best of all, I'VE EVEN SEEN MORIMOTO COOK THIS ON IRON CHEF) 2. Pork Belly (This was my first time having pork belly. Awesome, it literally melted in my mouth) 3. Beef Carpacio (haha, so after I ate this i kept asking my gf why i never had carpaccio) Next, the drinks: even at nearly 15 dollars a pop, we couldnt stop drinking their specialty drinks. our favorite, WHITE LILY; sweet, strong, and went down like water. Last, but most definitely not least: THE BATHROOM. So, if we didnt look out of place already, my gf nearly runs back from the bathroom jumping up and down in excitement nearly screaming HOW COOL THE BATHROOM IS..lol. After getting her to calm down, I ventured down stairs to see what she was all geeked out about. OKAY, SHE WAS RIGHT! the bathroom was so cool, it ended up being THE FIRST thing we told people when we told how we went to TOP CHEF MORIMOTO's restaurant in NY.

Incredibly happy (and stuffed ) with our experience and meal. The space was cavernous, multi level and modern. Glass, lights, light wood and leather. It was not what I had envisioned before walking in, it was better. Prices were as expected, although I question the markup on wine and $$$ cocktails. 3X is expected but there were some selections at 4x and higher. We did a little research before hand and weighed the cost of Omakase versus ala carte and decided that we could do better of the menu. Yeah we missed the creative mid courses but we had more food in three courses and some seasonal sushi than we could handle. Everything , including presentation, was amazing. The sushi was fresh, the seasonal varieties a break from the usual, the pipes filled with creative oils/sauces were fun and the entrees masterfully prepared. If there was a disappointment it was in the Duck Three ways. The least special part of the meal by far, but for what it was, it was perfectly executed. Never felt rushed, service was attentive but not obtrusive. There was noise but not conversational or music (which was perfect), but the blend you expect from NYC. The bar space downstairs was way under utilized and shockingly empty. Too bad or maybe great place to have a drink or two with friends and to enjoy some creative apps.

Great Dining Experience. ? The restaurant is stylishly designed with minimalistic and trendy furnishings. ?The dinner lighting is slightly dimmed but still allows you to see the faces of your companions. ? I've been there a few times and the food was consistently delicious. ? Oh-Toro: For sashimi lovers - you must get this. ?(Oh-toro is generally the fattiest part of the tuna) The quality of the tuna was very fresh. ? ? Wagyu Beef Tartare: Amazing. Foie Gras Chawan Mushi: I was never a fan of foie gras until I ate it here. Similar to the French version of foie gras but with a modern Asian twist. ? Ishi Yaki Buri Bop: The yellowfish arrived raw in a steaming stone bowl. ?The waiter mixes the contents of the bowl in front of your eyes so the fish cooks right in front of you. ?Perfect for something warm on a cold day. ? Tajima Wagyu Filet: Melts in your mouth. To rival the best steakhouses. ? Chilean Sea Bass: The sea bass was expertly cooked; the edges are slightly crisped and the flakes literally slide off the filet. ?Not too moist or saucy. ?The flavor was not overwhelmingly sweet as sea bass sometimes is. ?Small portion for large stomachs. ? Surf and Turf: ?Very small portions. ?The few slices of wagyu beef were delicious (see above). Lots of avocado - you may want to avoid this if you are not a fan of avocados. ? Large collection of sake and waitstaff are knowledgeable enough to provide recommendations. ?The Morimoto daijino sake was one of the best chilled sakes I've ever had; it's a little bit drier than most sakes. The other mixed drinks were pretty good as well. ? Average for two people was around $350. Five stars if Morimoto was the chef on those nights.

Went here for my bday celebration dinner and it was perfect. We had a reservation for 10 but our table wasnt ready so the manager brought our group downstairs to the bar and gave us a free round of drinks... sweet! Only took about 10 -15 minutes then we were escorted to our table.. Im a fan of modern restaurants. ?The group ordered some big sushi platters and they were tasty. ?Given the amount of food and drinks we had the bill wasnt all that bad.. probably because we were all hammered by the end of dinner. ?They brought out multiple bday desserts.. which was nice since the girls ate it all up. All in all the service was awesome, the food was great and the atmosphere/ambiance was right up my alley. ?highly recommend.

When you first walk into Morimoto you can't help but be amazed by the ambience. It's two full floors and there are full bars on each one. Beautiful furniture, and beautiful lighting. The food though on the other hand is just mediocre. I had the ramen soup which was a little overly oily especially for it being $20 for the bowl. The sea bass was a little over cooked, but the sauce it was in was delicious. The brussel sprouts was my favorite part of the meal, absolutely delicious. I wouldn't have wanted the brussel sprouts any other way, and I still crave for them til this day! The sushi was okay, I've had way better back home in Minnesota. The food is pricey for what you get, but the experience is worth it. The restrooms are what blew my mind. Heated toilet seats, buttons on the side of the stalls for adjusting the toilet to the way you want it, tropical fish tanks behind each toilet. The service was very on point too. We didn't have reservations and they seated us almost immediately upon arrival.

So these toilets... I'd like to take one of them home. I bet you ALL the women that dined here wanted to take one home with them. Let's just say... they clean you with water "strategically" and you can control the temperature. It even airs it off after! THAT'S service. And if your date is gone for a while, now you know why. It wasn't that piece of seaweed in your teeth (I could be wrong). As for the other type of service, waiters and waitresses are enthusiastic and get you amped up to eat some of this famous man's food! As our waitress suggested, I tried the Morimoto Ice Tea. If you put your name on it, it better be damn good. It certainly was. Although the lunch menu is missing a few of the dinner dishes, the Foie Gras and Unagi Bop made up for that, as well as the Chirashi. For $28, you receive two hefty pieces of seared foie gras, scattered unagi pieces, a sauce on the side, as well as a small plate of spices and herbs to adjust the sauce to your liking. That's what I liked most about this restaurant. Morimoto makes food fun. As for the Chirashi dish, how good can a simple rice and assortment of seafood get? REALLY good, that's how much. Half of the bowl was covered in various fish and roe. Even though you pay double the normal price, you receive more than double the quality. The sushi rice was refreshing and full of flavor, but not overwhelming at all. Just a note: If you are trying to kill time before/after your reservation, it's right next to The Chelsea Market. I'd go before you eat so you can look at food and make yourself even more hungry. Always a fun challenge before dinner! All in all, this was a memorable experience. Morimoto, it was an absolute pleasure meeting you through your food.

This is one of the restaurants that you have to make a reservation first and so we did but half of my party arrived like 30mins late so we were offered to wait for 1 hour more or just take the lounge table.. well obviously we chose the 2nd option. the lounge table was not so bad, it was just that the table and chair are so low.. the ambiance was good, I liked the white and glass decor, it really made the place looked like an expensive place to eat My friends ordered the omakase, which is the tasting menu, where you are given 8 meals continuously, from appetizer to dessert. They got like the famous toro tartare, fish, kobe steak, lobster, etc. It was a pretty good bargain for a 120$ price.. I just ordered the foei gras chawan mushi and some sushi.. well, of course the sushi is the same as the one found at cheap sushi place.. my other friend ordered the yellowtail with rice and for me (i dont really fancy rice AND yellowtail) so it was a nice one, but she said that it was amazing. The waiters cooked the rice in a stone pot in front of us so it was kinda unique.. The price? well, what can you expect from a restaurant by an iron chef? we each payed like around 50-60 bucks, except my friends that ordered the omakase.. It was like a once in a lifetime experience for me because I don't think I will come back here again, except someone is willing to pay for my omakase..

I'm a big fan of Morimoto on the iron chef america show, but my most recent visit was just OK. Nothing really jumped out at me and my guest -- there wasn't the Morimoto touch that I had the first time I was there. If you decide to get the omakase (chef's tasting), you will be in good hands (but it is very pricey). If you go a la carte for lunch, it's hit or miss -- sadly.

I think the only thing that could have made this meal better was if I had met the Iron Chef himself. Food was some of the best I've ever had since moving to NY over 2 years ago. For an appetizer, I had the octopus which was seasoned to perfection paired with a nice salad. The romaine lettuce leaves were large, and so it made for some difficulty eating this dish with chopsticks, but if you cut the leaves, then the problem is erased. For my main course, I had a 12 oz NY strip grilled to a Medium rare perfection. The teriyaki sauce that they give is a nice compliment to the meat, but you don't even need it to savor every single bite. And the hot/cold tofu cheesecake was amazing. I don't think I stopped smiling during my entire meal. The waitress that served me and my gf was very helpful with discerning the various terms on the menu and the staff in general were cordial in making the entire dining experience one to remember. I was even amazed with the robotic toilets in the restroom!! If I had more money, I'm sure I would be eating at this fine restaurant once a week.

Oh My Gosh. This place is Beautiful!! I mean how many places have the ambiance AND the food presentation matched? Amazing! It was certainly unexpected. Yes I do agree that the food could've been more authentic & what I'd expected more of Morimoto with his bold and daring approach in his creations. Anyway, make sure you have enough change in your pocket. Yes. They are Pricey. But you pay for the service and ambiance.

This review might be biased since we were able to eat at Morimoto's and order everything our lil hearts desired for FREE! Yes, we were fortunate enough, or should i say THAT I was lucky to have a boyfriend that had a $300 gift certificate to STARR restaurants from his client during the holidays. But I have to say that even though this meal was free...I would definitely go back and spend the money because it was goooood! First off, the host was great....Somehow he knew that it was our first time eating there probably because of my sheer happiness of finally getting to eat at an IRON CHEF restaurant. ?I was excited. ?He mentioned casually that he would try to get the chef to see us during our meal. ?It did not even cross my mind that Morimoto himself would see us, I saw that there were a dozen chef in the see through kitchen. ?But, it was HIM!! He came and said hello as we were finishing our dessert. For appetizer we ordered the Tuna Pizza. ?It was delicious. The aoili on top was nice and creamy and went well with the blue fin tuna. The Kakuni was frikkin' orgasmic. ?I mean seriously, you can't go wrong with slow roasted pork in a sweet soy scallion jus, the bed of congee was a nice balance to the salty and sweet. We also ordered the tempura calamari salad....also great. ?The calamari was cooked perfectly. Needless to say, we were pretty stuffed by the time the entrees came along. ?The portions are not tiny little things, mind you. ?They give you a decent amount of food, not like other restaurants you go to and you pay a ridiculous amount of money and get a spoonful portion which i hate. Then came the best part of my meal. ?I salivate just thinking about how perfect it was. ?I had the black cod. ?Not sure i remember how it was cooked but it was perfect ....it melted in your mouth and the glaze was simply delish and perfect. ? My fiance (bf at the time) ordered the halibut with black bean sauce. ?He loved it. But i thought it was a lil salty for my taste. For dessert, we had the warm chocolate cake with whisky caramel and tobacco creme and popcorn ice cream. ?It was interesting. ?I loved the popcorn ice cream. ?Our waitress actually told us that they actually pop the popcorn and make the ice cream there fresh. ? Service was impecabble. ?Food was outstanding. ? I dream of my return to Morimoto. -=D

This has to be one of my favourite restaurants - worldwide. I have been to many a top restaurant all over the world and when I recently dined at Morimoto's and was blown away. Besides the food being second to none, the service was a delight. It was neither stuffy nor lax, and our server was there when we needed something, and didn't bother us when we we're all set. Granted, I have not been to Asia, so I cannot say it's the best, all I can say is I have never had a better dining experience. My only downside is the bathrooms are downstairs in the bar area. Try everything you can, We had about 9 dishes and every single dish was amazing, and we could not find fault. Oh, and a final treat - Morimoto was there, was very friendly and I appreciated that he was working in his own restaurant. Excellent dining experience.

I'd been to Morimoto in Philly, and couldn't wait to try it up here as well. ?The menu was a bit different, but variety is certainly the spice of Japanese eats! The cocktails were decidedly "meh", and fairly overpriced...however, the ambiance of the downstairs bar was so good that you really don't notice. ?Once we got our table, the sake was excellent, the ramen noodle soup was great (don't think about it, just order!), and the sushi was some of the best I've had. ?Definitely pricey, but great for a date. ? This one would have gotten 5 stars if the cocktails had been better.

Went there on my birthday and had the Omakase. - Toro Tartare with Osetra Caviar: It was delicious and fun to eat. This dish was up to Morimoto's standard. - Kampachi Carpaccio with Yuzu Soy: Too salty and saucy, couldn't taste the fish itself. - Sockeye Salmon with Microgreen: Just okay. - Nigiri: It's good, except the barracuda, too fishy. - Oyster with seared Foie Gras and Uni: Liked the Foie Gras and Uni, but hated the oyster...too briny. - Fresh Matsutake Mushroom Soup: Loved this soup, the aroma and taste were so wonderful, I can drink and smell this all day. - House made ginger ale: Not very interesting. - Spiced Spiny Lobster with Yuzu Crème Fraiche, Waygu Beef with Japanese Sweet Potato: The lobster was overcooked and thin sliced beef was swimming in a very sweet sauce. Didn't care for this dish at all. - Almond Soufflé with Apricot Sorbet: It was okay. We enjoyed much more of our last visit here where we picked items off of the menu, instead of the Omakase. The Omakase was pricy and mostly disappointing. ?The standard of the sushi rice seems to have lowered as well. ?The service was very good and attentive. ?We would give this place another try and hope that Mr. Morimoto could better control the quality of the food that comes out of the kitchen whether he's present or not.

Very "ultra" space worth seeing, fantastic sushi If you can't afford Morimoto, go to just to see the space. You don't need a reservation to slip downstairs to the neon-lighted bar, and more importantly, the WCs! I've only had two dishes, plus a few sips of my partner's cocktail ($14), but I wished I had ponied up more time and money and ordered omakase (chef-selected tasting menu, about $100-$120). Highlight? The exceedingly elegant, yet inelegantly named, tuna pizza ($18): crisp flatbread with raw tuna, anchovy aioli, jalape?os, and a sprinkle of kalamata olives, cress-like greens, tomatoes, and red onion.

After many years of watching Iron chef I think I may have had expectations that were a little bit too high, I was expecting to have orgasmic taste buds all through the dinner service but that didn't happen. Must say the sushi was very good though. Service was superb, flawless and flowing. The lighting was a little strong for the setting.

A couple years ago, I went ot Morimoto in Philadelphia and loved it! It was amazing-great food, great service, you name it. I wish I could say the same about the NY location. I went to Morimoto during restaurant week for lunch...and its safe to say--it was possibly the worst restaurant experience I ever had. While the food was subpar, the service was incredibly awful. Our waiter was extremely rude and messy (spilled water over the entire table without any cleanup). In addition, there was an unnecessary wait...it took us over 40 minutes to get our food after ordering (lunch). If I could give this restaurant a zero star rating I would!

3.5 stars for the restaurant week lunch. Nice presentation of the appetizer which was 3 oysters each with their own sauce, served on top of a large bowl of ice with knobby bright green seaweed entwined on the surface of the ice. I have had better oysters since, but only in Boston, if that means anything (?) Main course was a hashed beef soy sauce concoction on rice, which was good, but portion was huge, and a little too same flavor the whole way through. Dessert was a white chocolate pannacotta which was out of this world. ?My roommate, who is a pastry chef, said it could have been more firm, but firm or not, it was damn good. Wall of 20,000 glass water bottles was photo-worthy, and toilets in bathroom have a remote control that I'm sure make the toilets do strange things if the remotes were working/had batteries in them. Bar downstairs was closed, but cool lighting made it look mysterious and interesting. The ceilings and walls on the main floor are 'draped' with a hardened material made to look like curtains or canvas, and soundproof glass separates some of the tables which would otherwise be polluted with noise. ?Genius decore.

Service: C Food: A Ambiance: A Noise: B This is the most impressive Japanese restaurant I've been to. ?The menu is amazing, service aspired to be top-notch, but wasn't. ?We had the huge 12-course tasting menu, which was great. One issue came up, though, when my friend complained that the seaweed on her hand roll was chewey, not crisp, as it should be. ?She's Japanese living in Asia, so she would be a good judge of what is good seaweed. ?They got her a new roll, but unfortunately, the server kept bringing up the issue throughout the rest of the meal. ?He said that the head chef is looking at her from behind the door, that they have something for her now, asking if everything was all right to the point of being annoying.. very unprofessional service for such a nice place.

Decor is very clean, modern, slightly minimalist feel... Love the tuna pizza so much! ?I would eat 2 of that for dinner...but for the fact that I will miss out on the awesome sashimi.... Their sashimi is juicy, thick pieces...they def don't skimp you (they better not for the price!). ?At the end of the day, their fish quality is phenomenal. ? I don't really eat beef, but the kobe is a must according to all my friends who have tried it.

Iron Chef Morimoto is truly one of the best chefs on TV and in reality. His restaurant is beautifully decorated, very modern, but aesthetically clean and inviting. We had the 7 course tasting menu with a couple carafes of Morimoto's own brand of Sake. Every course was just amazing, descriptions I can barely remember. It was a perfect balance of each plate building up to the final course of spiced half lobster and then completed with a lovely chocolate dessert. I won't bother with the details of every course, this place is worth going to and experiencing yourself. At the end of dinner, Morimoto himself walked by. I begged the waiter to ask him to come by and say hi, but he was prepping something for a food network tv show upstairs and couldn't. I was bummed.

OK so I was super excited to eat here and the food was good but not great and the service was sub par...for the price I think they could have done better. Positives: Rock Shrimp were excellent, as were the beef dishes. All the sushi and sashimi was fresh... Negatives: nothing really stood out on the sushi and sashimi menu...and the service was ok at best, had to ask for water a few times and the drinks service was pretty slow...the place wasn't that busy to I would have expected them to stay on top of it. All in all given the price this should have been a lot better...

I went to Morimoto with a party of 4 people on a Friday night. The reservation was made 3 days ago so it wasn't incredibly hard to make; however, the table wasn't quite ready when we arrived so we waited about 15 min at the bar downstairs. Four of us ordered an appetizer, two main courses, plus one "morimoto omakase" (chef's choice). They allowed us to order just one tasting menu, so that's pretty nice. For appetizer we had the "tuna pizza." I thought it was a very interesting dish, and I liked it. I wish there could be more "tuna" though, but it's just me. We had "sea bass" and "ishi yaki buri bop" for the main courses. The sea bass was really tender and well-seasoned. The ishi yaki buri bop is just like Korean bim bip bap where you mix meat, vegetable, and rice together with special sauce. The raw fishes were heated and cooked against the hot stone bowl. Personally I like the sauce and semi-cooked sashimi :D Now let's talk about the morimoto omakase. The portion was definitely not for 4 people, but oh well, we just want to "taste" it. toro tartare: the presentation was really cool. It differs from the usual tartare that you actually mix your own toro meat and all the garnishes. sashimi salad: more like...sashimi and a couple leaves; not too impressed. fluke slices: same as above. I think it's so-so. oyster foie gras: didn't get to taste this one (as it was shared among 4 of us) but it did look delicious! sushi set: I had the tuna and ikura (salmon roe) nigiri. It was good, but not like "heavenly." surf & turf: The wagyu beef was really tender and delicious! dessert: I like the ice cream, but nothing special either. I like some of the ideas (like toro tartare and the sushi set. Maybe the oyster foie gras if I had tasted it), but for $120/person, I'd expect better.

If you're going to Morimoto save up and get the Omakase!!!!!! I can't stress this enough! ?From the get go the service was imppecable. ?My server asked whether it was my first time at Morimoto and when I said it was and that I wanted the Omakase he smiled with a twinkle in his eye saying that it was an excellent choice! ?Of course, I know this..I mean, it IS Morimoto! ?My still water came in the form of a Fiji bottled water. ?Classy ? ?I also ordered the Virgin White Lily (Calpico, Yuzu & Lemon Juice). ?I loved this drink!! ?It was like a chilled, more refined version of the Korean yuzu tea syrup (zest, pulp and all!)! Sweet, refreshing and palate cleansing at the same time. ?Again, love at first sip! The 1st appetizer to arrive was the Toro Tartare with Caviar accompanied by Fresh Wasabi, Sour Cream, Chives, Avocado and Rice Cracker Bubbles. ?This was an amazing starter! ? The tuna was smooth and creamy and each of the condiments brought a certain element and matched so well in terms of flavor profile! ?The creamd seawood was so~~ sweet and almost like a jam, the sour cream was fresh, the cispy crackers provided texture. ?Appetizer #2 was the Hirame(Fluke) in Hot Oil. ?Thinly sliced sheets of fluke atop each other with a hot yuzu infused oil poured over it. ?It gives sashimi a whole different meaning to have it warm like this! ?The fluke's flavor was much enhanced by the oil, and the warmth actually gives you a sense of hominess and is satusfying to the stomach! ?I really loved this one, too! The salad course came in the form of Sockeye Salmon underneath a Baby Arugula and Thinly Sliced Apples and Dill Foam. ?The saltiness of the salmon was balanced well with the crisp of the apple. ?This whole dish was light and summery and definitely made me want more! ?Next up was the Oyster Foie Gras. ?I have never ever had oyster like this! ?It was light and fluffy with just a hint of oystery essence, melting in your mouth with every small bite! ?The reduction sauce it was sitting in was incredibly sweet and literally made me want to lick every single drop off the plate!! ?The main entree was the Surf & Turf: Wagyu Beef and Chunky Sweet Potato Bites & Garam Masala Lobster with Creme Fraiche. ?Seriously, this dish blew my mind!!! ? ? The Omakase at Morimoto was completely worth it!! ?A total food experience that could not and should not be passed up! ?If I lived in NYC I would not even hesitate to come by for a lunch or save up for another Omakase dinner!! ?Thanks a million, Morimoto, for this one of a kind experince! ?The food, the interior design, and the service are impeccable and the best I've ever had! ?Basically all through the meal I not only was able to appreciate the food, but I felt like I was being treated like a princess! ?They don't call him the Iron Chef for nothing, that's for sure!!

I would visit again. Tartare is a beautiful, superb treat - a must. Spicy crab - okay (overpriced for something so simple). Champagne (or sparkling) Saki shots: I look for these on every menu with Saki now. Had a tuna special which was incredibly lush, a taste that I am still craving, although I'm disappointed because I can't remember the name (was it the Halibut on the menu)? Why even bring it up, you know?...sigh. ?Ishi Yaki bowl: Not a fan. Service and experience was fun and comfortable. *Side Note If you are a visitor like me: After a few visits to NYC, I've realized that it's always a good idea to tell any haughty servers that you are visiting and/or a first timer, they seem to drop the act a notch. There seemed to be many walks of life dining here, possibly out-of-towners like myself? Makes it all the more comfortable if you don't have Yorker friends to guide you through. Each of our bills totaled $100 with tip. p.s. Use the bathroom

Another place we visited based on The Best Thing I Ever Ate, and we were unimpressed. The Toro Tartare was ok...it lacked flavor. The Spicy Tuna and Spicy Yellowtail rolls were good.

We went for lunch during restaurant week. Service and ambiance was great. Miso soup was great, but our food (appetizer: tuna tartare, and entree: beef bento box) was alright. I expect better food from a place owned by Chef Morimoto. The food wasn't bad, but it wasn't memorable either, I guess I have higher expectations for an Iron Chef.

Ok, so we had lunch here during restaurant week. The Bento box was the prix fix. Portions were on the small side even for a lunch, but what does one expect? The miso soup a little on the salty side,one person in the party actually watered it down with hot water! ?the tempura was room temp, not something I expect when I have tempura, it should be crisp, fresh and hot. The ?sushi on the bento box, was chef's choice. ?No problem here, but when we actually had to ask 2 waiters what was on the plate, not something I would expect of a restaurant on this calber.

Great cocktails and appetizer (got the Japanese antipasti), but the entree (surf and turf) was only just okay. The surf part (Himachi) was incredible! But the waygu steak was poorly seasoned and the potatoes were slightly oily (I know...potatoes at Morimoto, so low expectations...but it should still be good). Next time I'd stick with the sushi! The service was impeccable.

Normally you go to a restaurant for its food, right? Makes sense. And we did originally go to Morimoto for its food, but walked out talking about something else. Not the food, not the service, not anything else except... The bathrooms. I'm not discounting the food. In fact, I found it quite delicious. We came to Morimoto for a sushi fix, so did not get a chance to try any of the main entrees or the omakase. However, we had to order the chef's signature dish, the toro tartare, and a side of lamb carpaccio. Both were delicious, and presented beautifully, especially the toro tartare. We ordered just a few simple maki rolls, which for a place like Morimoto, were actually very comparable in price to other sushi joints. The fish was fresh, but I felt like my rolls (eel avocado and spicy yellowtail) were nothing to write home about. My husband loved his spicy tuna roll and ordered a second one. The tuna was chunky and yummy, and had just the right amount of spice. I was actually hoping my yellowtail would have been a little chunkier instead of having that mushy texture to it that caused some of the flavors to run together. My friend ordered the chirashi, which she loved and I tried a little bit of. Based on my taste, the fish was really fresh and had that tender velvety quality, so it got my vote. But hey, I'm not here to talk about food. This place had that chic trendy vibe to it, but also minimalism that made it seem elegant and not pretentious. Anyway, as he does often during meals, the hubs went to the bathroom and returned with a lit-up face. When he opened his mouth, I thought he was going to tell me about a particularly successful bowel movement, but he instead raved about the sheer beauty of the bathroom, which I of course had to check out for myself. A confusing, simple sliding door in the entrance led into another minimalistic but so-clean-you-could-eat-off-the-floor bathroom. In the wall facing the toilet stall door was what the husband described as a Hunter S. Thompson-esque [read] psychedelic infinite leaf pool, making me less eager to sit down on the pot and more eager to stare into it. Nonetheless, I did sit down and my backside was greeted by a pleasant warmth. Heated toilet seats? Check. Bidet with several options? Check. Did I take pictures and explore some of the bidet options? Yes, check. Am I a middle-class woman from the Midwest who doesn't go to fancy restaurants very much? Uh, I guess so. Check... Yeah, leave me alone and check out the bathrooms, okay?

Very very delicious meal all around, but very small portions. My (slim+petite) daughter left there starved after eating the Omakase (tasting menu). You would think after spending $700.00 for slim people, ?you would not be hungry, I was satisfied, but in no way was I full. ? The toro tartare was approx 1-2 tablespoons spread super thin on a 3x3 plate with condiments. It was delicious even my mother, who would never ear raw fish loved it but in no way worth the price. My duagters BF loved the Duck Duck Duck, and the Oysters Foie Gras. The Waygu filet was dry and hay-like to me, and the sauce was crazy salty, not at all up to the hype. Still it was a treat to taste the food of an Iron Chef, and it was a special occasion so considering the atmosphere and service we left very pleased. But by no means was this the best meal I ever had. They do not require jacket, nor tie and my daughters BF wore sneakers (albeit they were Prada, but they were still sneakers) ?which they did not comment on. They called it business casual, I just think it was simple dinner attire. They lost our coats for 25 minutes cuz they took the coat check tags and tossed them in the pile without checking the numbers (a bit spacey).

This was a fabulous experience. I would go back. It's pricey, but, consider the area and the crazy bathrooms. I sat at the back bar with my ladies. My server ---Kaylee-- was on-point. It's a fairly extensive menu--- you need to know your fish---- and I was impressed with my server's knowledge. ?At one point I had no idea what seasoning I was tasting--- and a runner knew the exact dish ingredients. The decor remains as aesthetically pleasing as when they first opened. Definitely a place you can take people from out of town---- and not feel too touristy about. It's a Meatpacking stable with good cause, Bravi!

So many critics have attacked Morimoto in the past because of his fame. They are harsh toward the famous chefs/restaurants in general. But as a person who used to work at various sushi restaurants, I know too well how restaurants work: the more popular restaurants are, the fresher their ingredients are. Morimoto proves my theory. Especially for sushi, freshness is more important than anything else. The recession proof restaurant Morimoto can serve the freshest sushi is because it sells a lot so quickly that it can keep getting fresh fish directly from Tsukiji every other day. It's that simple. If you try their uni, you know what I mean. Also, there is another fact that should be noted: because of its popularity and great ingredients, skillful chefs come to work at Morimoto because they want more money and want to use high-quality ingredients that they can never touch in any other restaurants.

What else can I say? This is a 5-star restaurant through and through. The decor, the service, the food, the drinks....the *experience* are all well worth the hefty price tag. If you are a foodie, or even if you are just curious about celebrity chefs, this one lives up to the hype. The food is a whimsical French-Japanese (i hate to say it) fusion, and the meals are best enjoyed family style so you get a taste of everyone's extraordinary dish. We loved loved LOVED everything we ordered, which I would list except I am pretty sure the menu changes seasonally. The cocktail bar is beautiful too. Overall, a feast for the eyes and stomach. The meal is not complete without some wine pairings...so be prepared to spend. Will come back again when I feel like I can drop a coupla hundred bucks. :P

Went to Morimoto for my girlfriend's birthday and it did not disappoint. ?The sushi was fantastic (do the Spider Roll). Contrary to other reviews (especially restaurant week ones) our entrees were perfectly sized (even a little more than we needed) which is not all that common in these 5-star establishments. The Angry Chicken was unbelievable and I enjoyed every bite of the "Duck, Duck, Duck" - which could only have been made better if the foie gras croissant had been made with goose liver pate (not for the flavor, but just so it could be called "Duck-Duck-Goose"). The downstairs bar is very nice while you wait, and the very Japanese ?decor is a perfect fit - love that bottle wall (I just don't have the bladder or patience to try to replicate it at home)! Only way our visit could have been improved is to have seen the master himself. Alas, not on this visit, but there will be more I am sure.

The interior quality of the restaurant is great. The cocktails are very nice. But their Ramen is ... not Japanese Ramen. I had "Ramen" confused with "Japanese Ramen", because this restaurant is produced by a famous Japanese chef Mr. Morimoto who is one of the champions of "Iron Chef". Anyway, although it's not the best place to eat, but it's great place to drink;*)

Simply stated our food was amazing. ?We tried a little bit of everything but two dishes that I was hesitant about but ended up being amazed by were the beef carpaccio and the flourless chocolate cake. ?Both were surprisingly amazing. Of course we ordered some signature dishes and we were not disappointed. ?The turnip puree with the trout is creamy and smooth and just plain yummy. ?We had a wonderful sampler of sushi that came with a variety of fresh and delicious rolls and sashimi. Our server was great. ?He was knowledgeable and accommodating. ?He definitely helped make this experience great. The atmosphere is very modern and trendy. ?The music was a little loud and it's all low lighting. ?It is beautifully decorated though and if you have a chance, walk by the sushi bar. ?It's fun to see them making the rolls.

Morimoto was great. Food was good, solid Japanese food with some creative twists. Try the Rock Shrimp Tempura, Fatty Tuna, Black Cod, Sea Bass, and raw oysters! All were a knock out and incredibly fresh!! The only reason I gave this 4 stars and not 5, was for the overly eager service. Much too into the food descriptions made it feel overwhelming.

Morimoto is pretty good - not great, but good. I may be over it because I work in the neighborhood & I've been there a million times. I had to write this review though as a warning for others who might go there for lunch. There are many things to order at Morimoto that will assure you a delicious lunch. Ramen is NOT one of them. Since I've had almost everything on the menu, I thought I'd try something new and see how the ramen was. Morimoto is known for being a stickler for quality so I though it would at least be decent. Negative, Ghost Rider. This dish is not worthy of this restaurant. They should take it off the menu. The broth was not flavorful, but salty & oily. It tasted like an msg laden broth out of a can. The noodles were shockingly all stuck together. And they were dry rice noodles. Like the kind you make pad thai with. It was one of the worst lunches I've ever had. Giving three stars because Morimoto is generally pretty good. But this dish is a big faux pas. They should know better.

I have only eaten here three times. The food is definitely inventive. It is also extremely good. Here is my gratuitous advice. (Actually, not so gratuitous as you are currently reading this on an opinion website). Screw reservations. Go downstairs to the bar. No one eats there as everyone has reservations. The bartenders know everything and treat you great (as you will be their biggest tip of the evening). But they really are terrific and friendly people. Cool atmosphere. Cool bathrooms. Really good mixed drinks which are especially good if you are sitting and chatting with the bartender who is making your drink in front of you. Just order what they suggest, but heavy on the appetizers. No wine or beer. Just have cocktails. It will be a night to remember.

This is my first time at this NYC location; I've enjoyed the Omakase at the Morimoto in Philly and it was AMAZING. Had the Rock Shrimp Tempura- nicely battered and done with two different sauces, one was orange and had a little spice to it; the other was wasabi based and didn't have enough kick to it. It comes with home made ranch which is a nice option but not needed. We also had the Seared Scallops for appetizer and it was good but not outstanding. I enjoyed my Bento Box- sushi, good-soup, good with fresh tofu- salad, good- veg tempura was ok and the Wagyu Beef was on the dry side. It's a lovely environment and has nice ambiance but I must say the Philadelphia location beats NYC. In all fairness I did not have the tasting menu in NYC; I must come back for that and then I will update my review!

Went and did the chef's omakese and I was fairly disappointed by it. ?The food provided was great however at a japanese restaurant, I was really hoping for more of a concentration on sushi and sashimi... but that wasn't what I got. ?When I asked our waitress about the chef's omakese she explained that we would be getting an appetizer, sashimi, sushi, intermezzo, main entree (which was a surf and turf), and dessert. ?Sounds great right? ?Sounds like a lotta food right? WRONG. ?I really enjoyed our appetizer which was the toro tartare, it was delicious. ?Then came our "sashimi," when I think of the sashimi dish, I was expecting a little plate of maybe 4 different fish. ?Instead we got seared fluke and scallop. ?Naturally I was a bit disappointed. ?But the food itself was never bad, the fish was fresh and very tasty. ?There was also an oyster with foie gras and uni. ?I really would have enjoyed this dish if the oyster was raw and the uni was left unseared. ?Other than that, I normally don't enjoy foie gras, I liked it in this dish. ?The sushi was next and while each of the 5 pieces they provided was yummy, especially barracuda, I was hoping for more sushi. ?Before our entree came out, our waitress noticed that I preferred sushi and sashimi as opposed to the surf and turf so she asked if I wanted to stick to raw food for my entree. ?I was incredibly surprised that she gave me this option and, of course, jumped at the chance. ?But when my "raw" dish came out, I WAS GREATLY DISAPPOINTED. ?I was expected another sushi course or some sashimi... I got hamachi with rice in a hot stone bowl, the hamachi was then seared by the hot stone bowl by the waiter... ?had i known this was going to be my "raw" course I totally would have stuck with the surf and turf. ?This was a total RIP! ?The bf's turf was pretty awesome though. ?The wagyu steak was simply delicious! ?And while my rice and seared hamachi was yummy, it definitely wasn't worth it to replace the surf and turf. ?The tofu cheesecake for dessert was excellent! ? NOW was my meal worth the $120 (excluding tax and tip, and it was $120 per person not total) ?NO! ?Did I think bf's meal with the surf and turf was worth it? ?ehh.... not really but more so than mine. ?I was really hoping for a sushi and sashimi focus especially for the amount of money I was shelling out and it was what we got at all. ?It kind of makes me even more irritated because I asked our waitress prior to ordering about the focus of the chef's omakese because to me it seemed like the sushi and sashimi was more of an appetizer to the entree which was the focus of the tasting. ?She said the only thing that's really cooked is the lobster and steak and the rest was mainly raw dishes... which was half true. ?Aside from my 5 pieces of sushi and the appetizer, everything else was essentially cooked or were prepared in a way that was not like traditional sushi/sashimi. So my advice for people like me who want more of a sushi/sashimi fish focus, get the chef's combination sushi/sashimi choices, you'd probably be more content!

An open wallet and an open mind with a love for japanese or fresh seafood is what you need here. Get the omakase as the array of dishes will give you a true experience in Morimito's restaurant. ?Midway, they gave us a ginger lemon drinks as palette cleansers to move on to our wagyu beef dish and later by our spicy lobster main course. The sushi is authentic as it came with the wasabi inside. You get a different taste from each dish (spicy, sweet, fresh, salty, etc). But they were well balanced against each other by the order they were served. ? Service - 5+++ Looks - 5 Presentation - 5 Taste - 5 Ambiance - 5 Bathroom - ;) felt like I was in Japan What a way for my hubby to impress me. We definitely plan to return.

So. Made it out here yesterday, thurs evening, around 9:15 ish, after drinks. Been meaning to stop by for a while, but rarely make it to 10th ave. Restaurant week was the extra push that finally sent us. Turns out they weren't participating in the restaurant week for dinner, only lunch. Womp. Anyway, arrive without reservations, party of 2. Place was full, 30 min wait for seating. Went dwnstr to have more drinks as we wait. Bar was packed too. Older crowd with expense accounts, fresh from work still talking about what happened in the office. DRINKS: Friend had some dragon drink with bacardi rum, mint, lime, and raspberry. Basically a raspberry mojito. It was fine i guess, but we hate mint and mojitios. I always try to go for sake when im dining japanese but my stomach wasnt in the mood for games. I went for a glass of their Rose since I wasnt feeling daring after our previous cocktails at Raines Law Room, just wanted to eat. Rose was fine. BATHROOM: While down there I had to rush to the bathroom, then i realized oh yea, THE bathroom that everyone talks about, lets see what this is about... So. I didnt like that i had to pull a huge sliding door to get in. Not very sanitary. Once i relieved myself i was able to take it in a bit. Theres three stalls. The infinity mirror with the cherry blossoms is indeed nice. Now, the toilet. I went from stall to stall trying to figure how to work this thing. Finally was able to flush. As for the rest, none of the buttons were working for me. The strip of buttons actually fell off in one of the stalls. I grew confused and my legs grew tired of squating. Then randomly in the last stall, a surprising stream of warm water hits me where the sun dont shine, and I dont know how i felt about it. Things got messy before i could decide. Long story short, the bathroom is a bit overrated, and the toilets are unenjoyable unless you pause to read the manual before hand, and you are ok with sitting on public toilets. Not I. Nice try tho. SEATING: Pleasant man from the entrance came to get us 9:45 sharp, and escorted us to our table. I hated it. We were in a corner with a wall in my face. If we're paying non-restaurant week prices, Im gonna need a lil atmosphere guys. Communicated this immediately to our super cool waiter. He arranged for a seat change in 15 mins. We began our appetizer and they switched us over asap. The new table was still not the best, but better. I had a decent view of everything and the chefs preparing food. I want to sit on the floor next time, they have seats surrounded by glass. Looks nice. Overall decor was white, silver, glass, and wood. Jazzy music. DINNER: Our waiter had made some strong recommendations from the menu. We went with the shrimp rock tempura appetizer, would choose entrees later once we switched tables. It was freaking deLISHous. Then again, we were kind of ravenous. Twas a rectangle plate with three sections, 2 filed with the shrimp tempura glazed in 2 different sauces, the last had a dipping sauce for it with a few pieces of celery. We were almost going to order a second. Once we switched tables, we got a different waiter, not as gnarley as our first, but still fine. For entrees he went w/ the angry chicken, i went w/ the black cod. These entrees come solely as described, no sides, so we ordered the white rise side and the market vegetable side as per the waiters high recommendation. I also ordered a california roll for the hell of it, to ensure that i was stuffed. The waiter recommended the roll come out before the entrees, and i agreed. But it didnt. It came at the end. and that kind of bothered me since i devoured my cod so quickly and didnt get to really enjoy it as i would have if i had the roll to slow me down. Anyway, my black cod was nice, in a sweet glaze, kind of like a teriyaki, really soft, couldnt eat it with the chopsticks had to use a fork cause it kept falling apart. Good stuff. The market vegetables turned out to be just corn on the cob with seasonings. I dont really like corn, especially on the cob, it just difficult and not worth the trouble. Will just go for the chinese brocoli next time. The 4th and only other side option was bok choy. Wish they at least had a ?fried rice option, sheesh. My friends Angry chicken was ok. Just chicken with a sort of tangy aftertaste. I wouldnt order it, but its an op for those who dont eat seafood, like my friend. The roll was nicely sized, a lil bigger than usual. Real crab meat, not the imitation. Fresh & clean seafood. To finish off i had one more glass of Rose and the flourless chocolate cake to share. Was ok. The cream and crispies taste good together. Also came with a scoop of peach sorbet. all very interesting, but no need to do it again. I was stuffed and bursting at seems. Bill was sizeable, but doable - To me. All in all, im not a fan, but will come back for that shrimp tempura FOR SURE. (Heads up: Was super hard to get a cab frm 10th ave, on the hottest day/night of this summ

Both my bf & I being a huge fan of food network/iron chef/morimoto, it was a must to come here when we were in nyc for the week. I came for lunch rather than dinner so I could try more for a slightly less price. Instead of going for the bento (a standard for those that want to "try it all" at a reasonable price), we ordered based on what we generally like (so we could have a basis for critique) and yelp reviews. We started with the 10oz bottle of ginjo sake, morimoto ice tea, toro tartare, and spicy king crab. My bf LOVED the presentation and experience of the tuna tartare. Of the "condiments", I enjoyed the seaweed paste & rice balls. I really liked the meaty king crab, & my bf liked the spicy sauce so much that he was sucking on the shells. My bf guzzled the calpico/ice tea concoction. The ginjo was smooth & subtle. For our entrees, we shared the soft shell crab maki & katsu sandwich. The roll was very balanced and had a clean, not overtly fried, taste. I'm glad they didn't garnish it with tobiko. The sandwich came on uncrusted white bread and a little slaw. It was light & not abrasive but crunchy. It came with a couple onion rings that were sprinkled with way too much salt for my liking. The sweet cucumbers are super yum! We willingly forced ourselves to have the tofu dessert trio, which is amaaaaazing. Overall, the food & experience met our every expectations. Since we came for lunch, our total was only $160, which I find pretty deng reasonable for a satisfying but not gourding meal from the iron chef.

Morimoto's isn't just a restaurant, it's an experience. I had the tuna pizza, yellow fin tuna roll, and the sea bass. The sea bass came with eggplant which is the only vegetable I'm not a fan of, but my plate made it so delicious! I also had Morimoto's beer, $30 for a bottle but enough for two people and worth the money. Our waitress was super attentive and made the experience that much more enjoyable. I would definitely go back and would love to try the omasaki (t course tasting menu).

This has become my most favorite sushi and japanese restaurant I have ever been to. I visited during Restaurant Week for lunch, however also ordered regular menu items. Usually RW specials do not compare and are not the most representative of the actual restaurant, this is the case for Morimoto as well. The RW menu consisted of a small bite-sized appetizer, bento box and a berry panna cotta. These items were still good, but did not blow my socks off. For the Bento Box, you got your usual citrus-ginger salad, tempura, miso soup, assorted sushi and sashimi and a choice of black cod, kalbi beef (and something else that I can't remember at the moment). I considered this my filler foods to make me full in addition to the small tastes of the featured items reviewed below. I also ordered the Morimoto Iced Tea which was very light and refreshing (little to no sweet but had fresh fruit infused flavor). The experience from start to finish was amazing. As you walk in, you can't help but be amazed with the clean, open and modern look. Though seemingly minimalistic, it has a lot of fine details. Everything is white and each table is separated with glass walls to ensure a little bit of privacy between each party. The chairs were quite heavy, I had trouble moving them but it just showed that Morimoto didn't try to go cheap even with the little details of his decor. The side walls looked like white curtains but were solid fiber glass and the entire interior was lit with halogen spot lights. And last but not least... Coolest thing... clear chopsticks! Going on to the bathrooms, they were another experience in itself. The backdrop of each stall had an optical illusion of a 3D tunnel of (hibiscus?) flowers that looked like it just went on and on. The toilets were the japanese style ones that had bidet functions and automatic seat warmers. The entire wait staff was very hospitable and extremely knowledgable about the food, ingredients and the restaurant itself. It makes you wonder if Morimoto has some kind of boot camp or intense training for his entire staff across all of his restaurants. Must have appetizers include Toro Tartare and Foie Gras Oysters. They were absolutely divine and just the thought of these items have me salivating as I am writing this review. The Toro Tartare had an amazing presentation with the tartare itself spread onto a wooden plank and erected diagonally on a bed of ice. While resting horizontally on the side is a palate of dips neatly organized on a rectangular mini-tray consisting of various dipping pastes: wasabi, seaweed, sour cream, avocado, chives and rice crunchies. Small metal flat spoons were used to eat the tartare. This was quite the experience in one appetizer. The Foie Gras Oysters had the deliciousness of fresh oysters with a kick of umami from the sauce and foie gras. Another great must-have Sensory experience. Just to throw in a little more food to make sure we were full, we ordered the spicy tuna and spider rolls. These aren't anything special and are items you can find at any sushi place. I must say however, the spicy tuna roll here was the best I have ever had. There was something about the freshness of the fish (emitted absolutely no fishiness and had a clean finish with no unpleasant linger aromatic notes) along with an extra sumthin-sumthin that put almost a bit of smokiness in the flavor of the salmon. I wasn't sure exactly what it was but it made the roll stand out from the rest of the other spicy tuna rolls i've had before. In terms of price, it really wasn't any different from your typical sushi restaurant. I think the spicy salmon roll was something like $8 and the spider roll under $15 (I may be wrong on these numbers but they were definitely very inexpensive). If you're in the mood for a couple simple rolls, I would say it would be more worth it to scrap any other sushi and just go to Morimoto. i would love to come back next time for an omakase meal. For everyone else visiting or in NYC... or even in any of the other cities Morimoto has tapped into, this place is worth the visit. Very highly recommended! And i have to add... 100x better than Nobu... :X

MorimoNO From beginning to end, we just started off on the wrong foot. My party arrived on time and we were told to wait downstairs at the bar because our table 'was not quite ready'. The host said he would get us but after 20 minutes of waiting we got antsy and two of us went back upstairs to inquire. The host then made the mistake of thinking it was a party of 2 instead of 5. When he was corrected we were seated. The whole area was actually empty. After reading other reviewer's experiences regarding the service at Morimoto, I've come to the conclusion that Morimoto leads you to the bar first in order to get customers to spend more money. Do not be fooled! We decided to skip the omakase and went for appetizers, sushi and entrees instead. Our waiter misheard shrimp tempura roll for the rock shrimp appetizer. We took it anyway and it was a blessing in disguise. It was awesome. I definitely recommend it as a must for the table. The foie gras chawan mushi was really good. It had a tofu like texture but is really an egg custard. The house smoked ravioli was a miss. For entrees, everyone loved their dish. Fish was a big hit (sea bass and braised black cod). The portion was actually big. The wagyu filet got glowing reviews. I looked at it and it was a very small portion of beef. It came with a side of boiled fingerling potatoes and a citrus avocado salad. I call it guacamole. The sushi was really good. Very fresh and of generous proportions (soft shell crab roll and shrimp tempura roll). To round out the meal we also got the market fresh vegetable of the day: roasted brussel sprouts. At each course, we got a new waiter. I don't know if that was intentional but they never told us they were switching over. We didn't even know who to talk to if we needed something. When we were served our main meal we had about six people come over but they had no idea who ordered what. They had looks of confusion as well as we. I was really excited and determined about dessert. We chose the chocolate mousse, apple turban, and raspberry cheesecake. We were hugely disappointed in the lack of flavor and presentation. I know Asian desserts are less sweet but these were just bland and odd in combination. The cheesecake was deconstructed and tasted like fluff. The ice cream on top of the mousse had melted and it was delivered looking like a pool. The apple turban was less turban and more like sliced apples on a plate. Way to go pastry chef! When our new waitress came over to ask how we liked it, there was a long awkward silence pause. After two spoonfuls, we were disinterested and didn't have the heart to tell her. She picked up fast and offered to give us something else but we were too turned off to even want anything else from Morimoto. Morimoto was a huge disappointment for us. The food was decent but the atmosphere, décor, and service was really not our style. The interior design had my cousin repeating over and over, "Who is this designer?" in a bad way. Yes, the seats, ceiling, and room dividers looked cheap. The communal dining tables are terrible. If you've ever complained about small restaurants and squishy tables, don't even bother with Morimoto. There was not even space to get into your seat as everything kisses each other. Your neighbors will be in your business and vice versa and the seats are reminiscent of pleather and 80's. If you want a see and be seen type of place and not break the bank, you can get that here. For us, we were expecting something a little quieter and more refined. Morimoto is a plummeted shooting Starr which banks on the Iron Chef franchise. Sadly, it's that tv fame which lured us here in the first place.

My friend and I came here for a late lunch on a Friday. We were pleasantly surprised by the reasonable prices for such a well known restaurant. We both had sushi--and it wasn't necessarily different in terms of flavor from our local (less expensive) favorite in Memphis, but what made the difference was the freshness of the fish. It had that fresh out of the sea taste--not frozen or processed like most sushi restaurants. I had a Morimotini (which was a bit strong for my taste) and my friend had a lychee martini (which was delicious). The ambiance is exceptional--everything I would expect from a hot NYC restaurant. If you're new to the city, make sure you check out Chelsea Market and the Highline--it makes for a nice afternoon.

My recent 3 star-ed dining experiences nearly had me in tears. I was a bit poorer and very unsatisfied (gut, mouth, tongue, brain, heart, and soul). What's a girl to do? Well as all yelpers know.. we move on, grasping our wallets in despair, frantically reading more yelp reviews in search for the next riveting experience to lift our spirits (all the while knowing that we'll be even poorer afterwards)! That's why I was at Morimoto. Morimoto deserves 5 stars. But there's a catch. Do not attempt to save money by ordering the lunch bento. Instead, pay what you must pay in order to truly enjoy the offerings of chef Morimoto. My lunch began with the chef's $40 assorted sashimi plate as a shared appetizer. It was SO WONDERFUL. The tuna was a mesmerizing bright red color, a pigment of such intensity and that seldomly graces a sashimi plate. (I typically see a pinker variety of tuna). The fatty salmon had excellent texture, the raw scallop was delicately paired with lime, the octopus was perfectly chewy, and the other fish like the fluke and yellowtail were delightful. My eating partner, normally a "stuff as much food as possible into the mouth" who shovels and breathes his food in took a bite of the salmon, closed his eyes for just a brief moment, and slowly swallowed. Amazing. His 12 oz. prime steak, uni, and toro sushi came shortly thereafter. All according to him were spot on. The prime steak, which I eyed jealously, looked tender and juicy with the perfect amount of pinkness. I had the black cod bento, not actually for the purpose of saving money, but moreso because I wanted a variety of small dishes. The miso soup and salad were not particularly remarkable, although that was expected. The tempura was what I really craved, although the portions were much smaller than I had anticipated. One potato, one green bean, and one green onion. Bah! For dipping is a blue cheese sauce (nearly the death of me because I can't stand blue cheese), although for someone else, that may be quite an interesting pairing. The black cod was delicious, with tiny bits of asian mushroom (not shitake, although I couldn't make out the variety) and black bean. Complex flavors swirled in my mouth, but for only a few seconds. The portion was teency weency! There were pieces of sushi that came with my bento as well, which paled tremendously compared to the sashimi that came before it. The fish was not nearly as fresh, the color and texture indicating its sub par quality. Lastly came the panna cotta dessert as part of my bento, which was perfectly portioned - a sweet little something something to end a meal. It was delicately made and very enjoyable. Quick notes: the service was professional, and the atmosphere was not overly stuffy. My other dining companions in the room were namely businessmen at business meetings, almost all of whom ordered lunch bento boxes. They missed out.

Really? ?Came in here to try some really great sushi and sashimi along with some highly recommended appetizers. ? Ordered the chef selection ($120) hoping to taste something amazing. ?Not impressed with the chef selection at all. Lots of salmon, fluke, regular tuna, egg, one piece of clam, octopus, basically everything you'd get at your run of the mill sushi joint. ?So we actually sent it back (which I never do) and ordered a la carte. The waitress said the one piece of clam and scallop that was on our plate was 86ed. ?She actually said 86ed. ?She had a list of everything they were out of (a long one). Basically they were out of everything. ?I was confused about this since it was only lunch. ? What will you be serving for dinner? ?More salmon or fluke? ?As far as the appetizers they were pretty good but expensive as hell and I don't mind paying for yummy. ?As for the sushi the uni was fresh the rest of what we had tasted fishy. ?I do have to say the manager came over and greeted us and said to contact her prior to coming next time. ?There WON'T be a next time! Save yourself a trip not worth the hype or money.

Came here for an early valentines dinner with my boyfriend and were promptly seated on the raised platform. Love how the restaurant is hidden behind a piece of red fabric blocking the entrance and upon stepping through the curtain, you enter Morimoto. The inside has a very modern decor and the ambiance was classy but casual. We decided to go with the toro tartare, ?mixed green salad, oyster foie gras and miso coups for appetizers, and for entrées got the seafood 'toban yaki' and the ishi yaki buri bop. The toro tartare is definitely a must get with its unique taste and the beautiful presentation. Be sure to try every sauce as they give the tartare a very different flavor. ?The mixed green was HUGE, and the waiter should have warned us that the portions were too much if we just wanted to munch on some leaves. ?Then came the oyster foie gras, an absolute must get. Definitely a highlight for me when I realized that an oyster could be given such a memorable taste combined with foie gras and uni. However ?I would suggest ?eating the oysters with a little less teriyaki sauce as it was a little on the salty side. The seafood toban yaki ?was good but not exactly memorable, and was the ishi yaki buri bop. However I did like how they prepared the buri bop and cooked the raw yellowtail on the side of the stone bowl. For dessert we got apple bread pudding at the waiter's recommendation. ?The bread pudding was warm and fluffly and I enjoyed it immensely. However I was a little disappointed by the sour berries on the side. Also as it was valentines day, it would have been nice to receive some complimentary dessert. Would recommend Morimoto over Nobu or Megu if you're in the mood for some Japanese fusion food.

I had very high expectations for Morimoto and was very disappointed. We started out with the cold udon noodle appetizer which was very good. The crab in the California Roll was dry and chewy. The seaweed was also very chewy. My mom had the bowl with 15 different kinds of fish and most of the fish was chewy and very smelly. I have had better sushi at hole in the wall places in Dallas. I will not return to Morimoto in the future.

Morimoto's greatest attribute is the space: huge and simplistic in its beauty. Both times I have eaten here I had the Omakase (tasting menu). I think this is the only way to do it at Morimoto. If you want great sushi there are plenty of ?better places to go: I say this because the restaurant has been around for a few years and is really more of a tourist trap than anything else now. The second time I came (and probably my last), I saw a huge huge fat woman in a red starter jacket rocking a fanny pack clogging up the otherwise spacious entrance. What a way to start off dinner. Anyway, the Omakase is not to be missed. It is a fantastic show. Each course is presented in a creative way; huge bowls of shaved ice with intricately laid out pieces of otoro, to seared fish on wooden planks, and the food keeps coming and keeps surprising in its presentation. It's a food fun experience. I took a girl here on a first date once, which turned out to be a mistake. I quickly realized the service, spectacle of food, and the massive space was too intimidating for her. Don't get me wrong, I still had a great time. Get some sake and knock yourself out! If you are a New Yorker, I would try everything else before venturing over here . This place was cool 5 years ago, but hey, I can't find much fault with it other than the tourists (which is a HUGE fault haha). The food is great, the space is cool and the service is spot on. Omakase for two and drinks runs about $500 a couple.

there's never a disappointment when I come here. I'm a big seafood and sushi lover. this place is a perfect fit for me! love the tuna tartare. fell in love with it since trying it for the first time years ago! I usually get chef's selection tasting menu. if you have been there before and had tasting menu, make sure to tell the staff that, so they can give you something different. of course, if there's something you really love and want it to be in your tasting menu again, you can also let them know. for those who might not necessarily love sushi, they can also find something to eat here. came with a group of friends from London, everyone was excited to try morimoto's food, but one of them doesn't eat sushi, fish or any seafood. he ended up getting steak, and it was really yummy too and he loved it.

My boyfriend surprised me with dinner here, when we went to NYC for our 18month anniversary...AMAZING experience! Definitely a MUST SEE/EAT if you ever go to NYC..Morimoto's is an experience in itself from the atmosphere to the food, drinks & even the bathroom is amazing! YOU MUST CHECK OUT THE BATHROOM!! Delicious food. We started out with cocktails..i ordered the white lily, & my boyfriend ordered the lychee-yuzu daquiri.. They were sooo good I found myself getting many refills & trying to get the receipe so I can try to make it at home! We ordered the toro tartare to start & our taste buds were amazed. It was not only delish to eat but beautiful to look at. We had the chef's choice sushi platter, kakuni (pork belly) & beef carpaccio. Everything was amazing & definitely worth the price.

We went for the omakase, and a bottle of nigori. Normally, I'd be really descriptive about what I had, however, not only did they not thoroughly explain what we were eating, many of the waiters forgot the actual items in each plate. On top of that, the waitress was assaulting us with drink choices, when we hadn't even opened the menu yet. I even asked her if I could have some time to look at it, and she still kept muttering different items to drink. I really just wanted to be left alone. ... Which was hard, because we were seated so close to the next table, we might as well have been a part of their party. ?It was pretty awkward, considering we were spending $120/person, the space would have been nice. I would say, for the price, it wasn't worth it. ?The portions were small, there were only around 6 courses, and it's the first time I've had an omakase, and not been full or satisfied afterwards. I love Morimoto as a chef, and I'd love to cook with him and for him one day, but what they've done with his restaurant (since it's obvious he isn't apart of it, but just capitalizing off of it) is a shame because I know he can do better. Food did taste good, overall. Not really the kind of dining you'd do if you want privacy. It's definitely casual, but casual where you don't mind spending way too much for good sushi. Nobu was better.

I set the bar high for this Iron Chef, too bad he didn't rise to the occasion. From the outside the bar looks pretty hip. As soon as you walk in you get an ear full of throbbing house music. Not what I expected for this type of restaurant but I get it, it's NYC. While we waited for our table to be ready, we drank by the lounge downstairs. They were nice enough to add our drinks to our dinner bill. I thought that was pretty thoughtful :) At this time, I decided to check out the bathrooms because I heard so many great things about them. After I slid open the door, I was slapped in the face by a strong odor of poo. Also lots of trash left on the bathroom floor. We got to our table a couple minutes after our reservation time. Our server dropped off our menus and water and then we didn't see her for another 7 minutes or so. We took our time reading the menu, we wanted to make sure we had the best dining experience. We ordered the lamb carpaccio and sea eel sashimi for appetizers. I ordered the whole roasted lobster "epice" and my boyfriend ordered the surf and turf for entrees. The lamb carpaccio was good. I wouldn't order it again though. Didn't blow me away. My boyfriend tried the eel and he loved the whole bite. The surf and turf was also good and if you order it, ask for the filet rare. Medium rare left the filet too dry. The star of that dish though was not the surf or the turf but rather the potatoes. The potatoes seemed as if they were sautéed with cinnamon butter. YUMMM! ?As for the Lobster "epice"... I never received that. Instead the waitress ordered for me the Japanese lobster fritters, a $12 appetizer. Maybe they should turn down the loud house music so they can hear their customer's better.

I'm all for food experiment and celebrity chefs as long as the food is good. What turned us off were: - Avocado mixed with Toro - why? toro is not fatty enough? flavor enough? ?There is a desire to achieve an audio effect of shovel fatty stuff in? - Reduced Teriyaki sauce on Oyster with pan seared froi gras and black truffle - Look, for anyone (or most of the people including ourselves) who would go at the first place, modesty is not the source of inspiration. ?Then again, excessiveness has to serve the purpose of good food. ?Each one of the 3 main ingredients is not excellent enough by itself that requires pairing AND enhancement of a heavy sauce like Teriyaki? Teriyaki sauce by itself not heavy ?enough that required a further thinkening?

I would always always go back to Morimotos! (if u wanna go, let me kno!) Im really not a huge fan of sushi/sashimi but after visiting this restaurant, I was hooked. ?I came with a large group and so I was able to try a little bit of everything. ?For me, everything I tasted was really good. ?My favorite is the tuna pizza. ?The desserts were really eclectic and they were perfectly balanced, -delicate, with the right amount of sweet. ?Perfect way to finish a meal. ? Ill be honest, it isnt cheap. ?Be ready to rack up a bill if you want to get full on things like toro, carpaccio and wagyu beef. ?Its quality over quantity. ?But it is sooo worth it. ?He is known for his fabulous "raw foods" but if thats not your thing they have plenty of other great choices not to mention the achitecture/decor of the restaurant alone is worth a trip. ?It really is beautiful inside and you can also experience the cool bathrooms. It was really awesome bc we got a glimpse of the iron chef in action at the sushi bar! ? but one star off bc of the wait staff. ?everytime i go they disappoint me. either get the order wrong or not attentive enough. ?one waiter would continually fix his pants and he even flashed us underwear.

Upon walking in, we definitely noticed how loud it is inside. ?I wouldn't suggest coming here for an "intimate dinner". ?It was difficult to hold conversation, since it felt like we were yelling across the table. ?It may have also been so busy because it was NYC restaurant week, but I'm really not sure. We did not order from the restaurant week menu (if there was one....no one ever mentioned it to us). ?We ordered the toro tartare and the spicy king crab leg. ?The tartare was to die for! ?I usually don't like raw fish at all, but i couldn't pass up trying this, after all, Michael Symon listed it as one of the "best things he ever ate" on food network. ? the spicy king crab was good too. ?We've been to the one in Philly, and with theirs, they serve it with japanese sweet potatoes, to kill the spice intensity. ?They did not serve it like this in NYC, and we brought this up with a manager who was passing by our table. ?He said they have different things between the two restaurants, but he would try to ask one of the chefs in the back who has worked in Philly, and find out. ?He said they serve the sweet pototoes in a caramelized sauce in another dish, but that's all he was aware of. ?Within a short time, he returns with a dish of the way they prepare sweet potatoes, and explained that no one back their was sure of what we were talking about, but this is how they did it. ?And they tasted fabulous! For dinner, I had the seabass. ?The only complaint I have, as I have mentioned this in a previous review for a different restaurant, there wasn't enough texture contrast for me. ?The food tasted great, and was perfectly cooked, but after awhile, I just got tired of eating it, because I needed some sort of crunchy texture with it. ?Otherwise, the food was great!

More like 3.75 stars. We tried the omakase and while the 7 courses we very good, they weren't as unique or innovative as we were expecting. Perhaps it was innovative for its time, but now seems... safe. We did like the the cocktails, especially the Motomortini, and the service was great, despite them pushing everyone towards the omakase.

One word...AMAZING!!!! To be honest I thought that it was going to be your "a typical" celebrity rest. but this is in no way typical. My husband and I both had the tasting menu of 7 courses. At $125.00 it was worth every penny. We got to try everything and would have spent more if we just ordered al la cart. It was just an incrediable eating experience. We also tried and assortment of drinks. We started with the Morimoto beer, which you can only get there. It is brewed by Rogue Brewery out of Oregon just for this place. It was pretty dam tasty. We had some other cocktails but none worth mentioning really. As far at seating goes we got lucky and were seated at the end of the a row of next to the wall. I think it would have been a bit uncomfortable if we were to be sat with people on both sides. BTW...check out the bathrooms...I know that sounds weird but even they were the coolest!

Came here for an after Thanksgiving party and tried their omakase. This is one time I felt more is less... having raw fish, wagyu beef, lobster, caviar, and foie gras all in one meal actually dilutes and confuses rather than enhances the senses. Omakase so far means Oh My Car Sick!

Kind of rounding up to 4* from 3-1/2. Came here with a group of 6. The drinks and service are fantastic. The decor and architecture are industrial modern and minimal. Comfortable and not too noisy, crowded after 7 PM. The food was good but not great. For apps we shared the famous tuna tartare; salad with crispy calamari; dumplings; oysters; tuna pizza. For dinner we had a sushi plate and the black cod. Cod and tuna pizza were my favorites. Bill was 630 for 6 people with a lot of wine. Fun for a group, but if I were having a serious, food-focused meal, would go somewhere smaller.

I was surprised on my birthday by my (totally awesome) husband for an Omakase for two at Morimoto's, his with the sake pairing. We started with the toro tartar which was great, but we had to wait approximately 45 mins for the 2nd course, which in our book is completely unacceptable for a meal that's over $100 per person (more so for an iron chef restaurant!) Following the toro tartar came several uninspired dishes that I can't even remember - one of the few that I do was a scallops dish. I was hoping for larger scallops, but instead received several tiny ones which was disappointing (the sauce, however, was pretty good). Also, if I'm paying for an omakase I would expect to be getting my money's worth. ?So naturally when I was served a fondue dipping sauce with a handful of raw veggies I was in disbelief. I thought, hey maybe it's surprisingly delicious - let's give it a try. However, what I got was exactly what I saw. ?And to top it off the fondue sauce was thick, salty and plain gross. The only dish that really impressed me was the Oyster Foie Gras. Now THAT ?was the quality of food I was expecting the entire menu to be like. Too bad it was 1 tiny bite that disappeared into my mouth at the blink of my husband's eye! As for the decor - I loved it - very trendy, but I must say to pay all that money at a nice restaurant I need a little more space. I hate to feel like I'm being sandwiched between 2 couples in a corner when all I'm trying to do is have a nice and memorable night out in town. Overall, very disappointing experience, and will likely NEVER go back. If you must, go with the a la carte - my husband recommends the Ishiyaki Buribap? and their rock shrimp tempura. No thanks for me - do your self a favor and go spend your money elsewhere!

I don't like Sushi - but I really like Morimoto. Went for a business meal and quietly explained to the waiter that I don't really care for sushi, but would try some stuff. I really remember what he brought out but it was spectacular. Unfortunately, haven't found that elsewhere. I've come to the conclusion that it's not that I don't like sushi. I just don't like bad sushi. No bad sushi here.

Highlight was definitely the bathrooms. Which just told you something. ?Yes, it's a knockout place in a very cool and hip area. The walk to the restaurant alone was fun. Some knockout items on the menu of which the cod was a standout. The sushi was surpisingly pedestrian. Service was very good. ?They had us in the basement and the tall chairs were not very comfortable. Meanwhile upstairs, you could hardly hear yourself think. ? For the money, there are a lot of other choices with better value.

Dear Mr. Masaharu Morimoto, Just want to make sure if I was indeed in your restaurant some weeks ago. Your automatic sliding door struck me with an impression that I might have been overdosed with Umami(savoriness). Please do not take me wrong way. I meant ?that I was so pickled in the universal Umami pool. In the worst implication - MSG. I was not at all impressed and it took me long time to even start writing about because I loved you and still love you. You are a Iron Chef "America". ?Well said, I guess you are now Americanized. The place was filled with Americans not Japanese(?). That only says a million words. The decor was glamorous in white but, made me realize that plastics do not last - remember 70's? 80's? they were once so fabulous but, what do you see now? At least, natural decor gets better with age and resonates history. But, do please know that the enterence was grande and thumbs up, some walls and the ceilings were notable for the architecture. Warm and cozy high-tech(?) bidet bathroom. However, the table settings look like one of cheap laminates...and scratched. ?The proximity between the tables are so close that we feel like we are not dining alone. The tables were so small and even paying $120 each person we were sit at a tiny sized table next to the wall feeling like we are in a starbucks. ?The wait staffs could not even see my face unless I turn my whole body b/c they have to stand between the tables, their knees hitting our table. What does that mean? the next table must have a look of their behind. ?Enuff is said..... The food. We had the tasting menu shared and a braised cod. The first course, tuna tartare pate spread in a bamboo case was a brilliant idea. The presentation, the accompanied dipping sauces are superb. But, that was the high point of the night and everything went downhill since. The thin fluke sashima was overpowered by the Yuzu oil & the smashed ginger sauce. I have seen this sauce for some liver sashima in a japanese Yakitori place. The powerful sauce to cover the strong gaminess of livers but this fluke, I found it unnecessary. The oyster and uni in Hoisin/oyster sauce, I detest this dish completely. The real ingredients were totally lost in the concentrated MSG sauce. mehhhh. Is this Japanese? The charcoal smoked sushis were nothing special. The grilled Kobe beef was salty and chewy. It seems like the marinating sauce was too salty/concentrated to begin with.. I do marinate Korean BBQ making the sauce from scratch so I know why this happened. It came with syrup coated fried sweet potato wedges to balance the saltiness but wasn't successful. The sweet potato dish is very common in Asia but mostly as dessert. I like it but not with the beef. Next, the Lobster, I felt that the lobster was wasted. The marination in the red pepper sauce completely shrunk the tender meat. That's why we don't use lobster in our seafood casserole. Also the sauce tasted like the dry powder comes with one of Korean instant noodles. This might have worked with Crabs instead.. seriously. ?At last, after all, I wanted to love the braised Black Cod but this wasn't the Miso grilled which he cooked so heavenly in Nobu. Again, it tasted Teriyakied and the cod was a OK. I did like the dessert until we see the check. The waitress said that we get a desert as a part of the Omasake tasting menu but we can choose different one. We did choose a different one but she brought both out not replacing it. How difficult for her to ask us and make sure what we want to order before she zoomed to the kitchen? Un-refined service. So we had 6 course that were so called "micro" sized as per my friend. and overfed with two deserts which was quite italian for some reason. So again, let's study the night at the Morimoto. The french pate with japanese dipping sauces, Chinese teriyaki oyster & Uni, Overly chewy Kobe beef (this tasted like korean dish called Neo-Bi-Ani - failed), Korean Ramen seasoned Lobster and Italian biscuit and Gelatos. Am I too underating? Maybe..... but do we want to come back? Nah... Once was enough.. We are going to Omen. Or maybe going to Kenka where Morimoto loves.

I'm in pain; in pain for the idol's fall and in pain for the amazing dinner that I could have enjoy at Omen, Perry Street (Marea? Jean Georges? probably) with the $120 that I spent at Morimoto. The restaurant is huge and beautiful. Glass inspiration, white colors, 2 floors. The main dining room at the street level is divided in 2 for the stairs that drive you down to the bar area where there is also tables to grab some food. ?I was surprise seeing so much life inside; it was pack, lot of workers running around, DJ type music, a little loud tho, and sexy ambiance like a nightlife venue. The service was very good, even being that busy, although the bar was kind of crazy and I have the impression of disorganization over there. Sake and wine are clearly the principal at Morimoto, the selection for both is wide; they have also signature cocktails that it was demanded for me being in this ambiance. I choose White Lili which is a premium Shochu based drink with citrus scents: a little sweet , a little bitter and quite strong. I loved it even not being as sophisticated as the ones that you get in speakeasies, but that I actually told to Kenta, one of the Pegu's mixologist where we went after Morimoto. I wish to know Pegu's version for White Lili. My friend order a Lychee cocktail which wasn't as good. it was too much sweet too much bitter and it didn't combine very well. Once we were seated in our table I could see that there were not Asians customers. Being 2 people we order Braised Black Cod with ginger-soy reduction and the Morimoto Omasake, a chef's choice multi-course tasting menu consisting in 5 appetizer-size dishes and a main course. The presentation was beautiful for all the dishes and sharing the Omasake and another main entree was more than enough. The Omasake change depending of the chef and a different server introduce each dish. The servers and food exhibition started with Tuna Tartar along 6 different dipping sauces. I really like it. It was well done, ground meat version instead chopped as is served in many Italian restaurants, almost like a paste. Except one, I loved all the sauces. Next we got Whitefish Sashimi which was ok. Nothing impressive but coming with a sauce that I didn't like. Next course was good and impressive. I'll skip the fact that was also a little overdressed. It was a smoked fish that looked like meat actually; it melted in my mouth at the first moment. Raw inside, smoked outside.. I saw a flash of Iron Chef in this one. Next one was Oyster Foie Gras: market oysters, foie gras, uni and teriyaki sauce. I liked the texture and kind of enjoy the dressing, a mix of salty and sweet but a little too much again. The flash ceased very fast tho, and the Fashion show was followed for a mediocre 5 pieces of sushi, each one with a different fish including eel and scallop, but that wasn't impressive either the rice or the fish. The main course of the Omasake menu was Half lobster w/ side of citrus creme and Grilled Kobe slice on candied Mountain yams. I liked the lobster. It was grilled, juicy and tasty. The beef was good. I'm not a meat eater so can't be accurate but I know that the sauce killed the flavor. Too much dressing. The Braised Black Cod with ginger-soy reduction was ok. The piece was fresh but not juicy, it didn't melt and again overdressed, this time with an extra-sweet soy sauce. It gets the 4th position for Black cod in my rank, after Omen, Perry St and En Japanese Brasserie and its a rank with only 4 competitors so far... so the last one and being you the Iron Chef. ? At least The Homemade Ginger Ale as transition between dishes, was really good. I loved it. But to summarize, the dinner was an exhibition of soy sauce more or less salty and/or sweet with stuff swimming on it. Sad and painful. As I said before ?"... there were not Asians .." guess why. ? I'm glad to say that I enjoyed the desserts. The one from the Omasake menu was Pumpkin souffle topped with ginger ice cream, candied Asian pear with ginger marshmallows. Really good. And the ginger marshmallows was interesting and original. Iron chef-ish. We also order the Tofu 'hot and cold' : soy milk soufflé, tofu cheesecake and maple ice cream. The ice cream was ok for me. But the cheesecake and the souffle was amazing. While I'm writing this I'm watching the Iron Chef Thanksgiving battle where you are Cora's partner against the others Iron Chefs. Lets say that the show keeps you maybe too busy to focus in your business . Lets say that. I'll still be your fan at the TV show since you always impress me, actually you are cooking in the battle this Lobster stew, Yakitori samples (Ducke skewers in 4 ways) and Tandoori Turkey that I wish I could try; but for Morimoto the restaurant, just give me the White Lilli recipe and then we can say goodbye each other.

Toro Tartare was AWFUL and overpriced! Don't get it. ?I've never had such awful toro before. ?Toro by itself is lovely and fatty. ?Put it in a blender and it became this smushed up glop of goo and then after that you have to season the thing by yourself with the condiments provided. ?It's served in an over-the-top kitschy way which is too much trouble to enjoy. ?Skip it and get yourself some pieces of sashimi. Aside from that, the sushi was lovely. ?Came here for restaurant week and got the cod, which was smooth and buttery. ?The sushi rice was lightly seasoned and went really well with the fish. ?The sashimi quality was perfect. ?Dessert was a pre-made bulk afterthought, but the bento was so good, I will forgive that. ?I won't, however, forgive the awfulness of the tartare which is -1 star.

Just had lunch here. Very disappointed. They have only bento box on the restaurant week menu. The bento box came immediately after we order. There are mixed greens, miso soup, vegetable tempura, sushi and your choice of fish/beef/vegetable. The fish on the sushi is not quite fresh. No better than seafood buffet such as ichiumi. I have the feeling they made all the bento boxes in advance and let them sit there. Not sure about regular menu dishes. Definitely won't come here again for restaurant week.

Touted recently by an associate as being the very best Japanese style restaurant in the city,...on the evening we went, we waited next to celebrity chef Bobby Flay..who apparently has some connection to the Iron chef who runs the joint????DUH. Anyhow the ?atmosphere is classic meatpacking chic but in contemporary Japanese elegance...simple and very functional. The menu is extensive...we had Wagyu everything and it was divine...I also ordered the Australian wagyu ribeye....as well as the veal and beef capparcio...delicious....the service was a little robotic but the food was very good...it did seem a long wait between courses so don't go in a rush. Overall...we really were impressed. They just opened in Mexico City!!!

NYC #12 (love italiano cuisine? you HAFTA CHECK OUT // VISIT my next review~*) The last of the my reviews for my NYC trip for the weekend of 2/21~24, presenting you, *drum rolls* MORIMOTO... Yes, we are talking about that Iron Chef Masaharu Morimoto... W-O-W, I did quite a lot in a few days... and despite the other girls shopping, I spent myself stuffing my face w/good food and desserts and hanging out with my other bosoms. We found this place as one of my friends who is a diehard Food Network junkie insisted that Morimoto was one place she HAD to try before she died... after our fine dining experience, I asked her again - all I got was a simple smirk... again, must be the hype, or must it be one of those things you check off on your THINGS TO DO list. *shrugs* Morimoto is great -- for an Asian Fusion place that is. The key word is: ASIAN FUSION. So we get to Chelsea, and stand right in front of 10th ave confused and looking like typical tourists w/cameras around our necks... ?We walk into this Ferry Building type building and walk aimlessly like morons for a few ... We ask people and they tell us that it's the next building over. *slaps forehead* BOINK?! You see the number "88" but don't be fooled by the red drapes that cover this poshy restaurant... ?Just walk a lil further, and comfortably make yourself in. This place feels very Hollywoody, with the whole overall setup and the background music. Very modern, spacious, and clean. The upper level is more so of a restaurant where the lower level is more of a bar... *** For a quick starter, we ordered the raw bar kumamoto oysters, *$18* for 1/2 dz. They were soooooooooooooo good... Super fresh, and super good... Peek foto! The presentation was quite nice, having the hibiscus in the middle, and a peachy tasting fig in the middle to cleanse the palate... Now, that's art! They came with 3 different types, but I must say, from spicy, ginger scallion, and the ceviche - the ceviche one was the best. You get 6 pieces, but try getting the 12 because 1/2 a dz was tease... Onto the foodies: -Unagi and foie gras bop $26 - prepared like those Korean bibimbop (fried rice) but in those stone type kinda bowls, but not really...Mixed in with a side of miso soup (a bit bland but jesus! They sure ain't cheap with their tofu! It was humongo! Peek foto!) and mixed greens w/ kabusu vinaigrette... the tofu melted right in your mouth and it was soo good. The vinaigrette - again, a bit bland but just ask for an extra on the side and just dip/pour as you please. It must be me, as a Korean, who always needs an extra punch of that spiciness/flavor... As an unagi and a foie gras whore, I'm thinking, o dang~ foie gras and unagi huh? But really, It's not as bad as you think... basically, its just unagi throughout and just a teeny weeny piece of foie gras. Literally the size of those Andes Mt Mint Chocolate... so $26 - not worth it... -Beef gyudon- $18 : Picture an upscale version of Yoshinoya's beef bowl ... It was super sweet, and the fried egg that was on the top was super cute ... Ordering this alone can cause you to have the runs, unless you decide to order something with it... -Ramen soup $14: This was super good... Like the miso, the ramen was a bit bland, but the chicken and the soup was sooo good... It left a clean after taste.. the chicken was super tender, noodles cooked well ... I would order this again in a heartbeat! -Roasted Blk cod $24: came out bento style ... As a black cod lover, it's quite disappointing because it was sucha small ass piece, but if you do end up getting the bento style lunch, you get a choice of sushi, tempura, miso, salad and more, like any typical bento lunch. I suggest you getting some other dish because you can get all the goodies cheaper and just as good someplace else. Not worth it. PASS. -Soft shell crab $12.. The sushi has got to go. Not fresh and not exciting enough to indulge yourself for more. I can never get enough of sushi, but this was pretty sorry... ? =( o dang, and this is a Japanese place? -We ending up sharing 2 bottles of still water, coming out to be $8/bottle. *~*~* the restrooms were ok, not dirty, but smelly, but that's a given, and that's not Morimoto's fault. Servers were appropriate, helpful and easygoing -- full of smiles. Food was above average -- "delicious" wouldn't be the word for it ... more like, tasty... when in doubt, when looking for authenticity, Morimoto is not a place to be. This place is more of a place where you would like to be "seen..." which is so not my scene/style. In other words, it's very LA... an LA place placed in the heart of New York. Perhaps, I'll return in a few for a martini or a drink, but give me a few minutes about the food.

When in NYC, you have lots of good choices for sushi and fish. But this place really hit the spot for me. The presentation of the food is really unique and although the portions aren't that big, you WANT to order a lot of food because there is so much to try. It's expensive but worth it. Good to go for a birthday dinner (which is what we did) or a romantic date night

My girlfriend and I went to NYC for a week to visit family members and to have fun. Morimoto's restaurant was one of the restaurants that we went to. I was looking forward to it for weeks and we finally went today. The food was mediocre. My wagyu rib eye was definitely not spectacular (btw, I'm a rib-eye aficionado). Marbling was below expectations compared to other non-Japanese wagyu cuts but barely above USDA Prime grade. I've had more tender rib-eye in other steak-houses than this "wagyu" at Morimoto's. I requested it rare but what I got was medium. ?Unfortunately, I also allowed a sauce to be poured over the steak. It was extremely salty from the first bite. It was salty throughout but did not want to make a big deal in front of my girlfriend. ?I just kept drinking water to wash the salt down. ?The waiter was not being attentive with our table so I often ran out of water. ?He was much more attentive of the wealthy-looking couple siting at the table right next to us. ?Furthermore, the rib-eye came out pre-cut even after I specifically told the waiter I did NOT want it pre-cut. ?Once again, I did not want to make a scene in front of my girlfriend. We also got the Morimoto sashimi. I was disappointed here as well. Each fish was sliced extremely thin and layered on each other. I understand that in upscale restaurants, portions are going to be small. ?This dish, however, had thin slices of typical sashimi that you would find in any sushi restaurant. ?The result was bite-size sashimi that lacked both texture and distinct flavor. ?The toppings and 5 sauces were interesting. (btw, this dish looks much bigger in pictures than in real life. I also ordered cognac on the rocks, but what I got was room temperature cognac without ice. My girlfriend had duck duck duck, and I think it was nicely done. I wasn't too fond of the sauces but the duck egg was a more than adequate dipping sauce. The duck was crispy on the outside and very juicy on the inside. ?She also ordered a foie gras custard and it was delicious. It was the best thing I had all night. It was similar I beef bone marrow but richer in favor and texture. ?I've never had foie gras before and this custard got me hooked. We also ordered dessert, but since I'm not a fan of deserts, I'm not going to review them. My gf loved them though. Overall, I had high expectations for a restaurant owned by an Iron Chef. ?My overall experience here fell well below my expectation based on service and the two dishes I ordered. ?This restaurant lost three stars due to poor service, inability to take my very simple orders properly, and just poorly executed "wagyu" rib-eye dish. ?I'm giving it two stars because the foie gras custard was really good and because my girlfriend had a positive experience here. ?Morimoto's restaurant is always busy, i get it, but there was no reason for service to be this bad.

Interested in taking out a second mortgage so you can hang out with wannabe hipsters eating mediocre "Japanese" fusion food? ?Then Morimoto is the place for you. ?This place joins the long list of overhyped "event" restaurants where a celebrity chef with a good interior decorator hopes he can distract you into paying a lot of money for uninspiring, or just plain weird, food. ?If you're looking for great sushi at around the same price, try Jewel Bako, where the focus is on delivering top quality food and service, not on showcasing all the beautiful people. ?We started off with rock shrimp "tempura," which tasted like Red Lobster's popcorn shrimp special, doused in two high MSG sauces and served with blue cheese dressing. ?Revolting. ?And Red Lobster at least has the dignity to charge a third less and give you all you can eat. ?Then off to the chef's signature chicken Ramen, which was strangely reminiscent of Cup o Noodles - high in salty broth and tasteless, skinny noodles, low in flavor. ?Try Menchanko-Tei uptown or Momofuku in the East Village instead if you like Ramen. ?We finished our experience with the sushi and sashimi platters, which included thick slabs of above average quality fish, with a heavy emphasis on clam and salmon (and a few choice pieces of chu-toro thrown in for good measure). ?The sushi at Jewel Bako and Hatsuhana is much better, without the distracting disco atmosphere. I suspect this place will survive, although there are skeptics, but its clientele will be increasingly dominated by wannabe hipsters coming here by way of a bridge or tunnel (a group well represented on the Saturday I went).

Sushi- not bad, sort of small portions at astronomical prices Service- not bad, sort of pushy Over all ambiance- trying hard to be too cool for school, sort of pretentious.

now Morimoto was simply MIND-BLOWING! warm, tingly feeling in my mouth and all over MIND-BLOWING. to give you a taste of just how mind-blowing.... 1. toro tartare in a bamboo box with caviar and 6 condiments, finished with a japanese berry. 2. seared red canadian salmon with bushel of micro-greens and cold cucumber garnish 3. oysters layered with uni and seared foie gras (my all-time favorite) 4. seared wagyu beef with sweet potatoes coupled with lobster in a half-shell and spicy indian curry. OH MY. and that was just the half of it - literally. our 8 course tasting menu was a trip through the colorful fireworks of fish and more. it will make you ooh and aaah. the service was warm and simply perfection -- to contrast the venue, which was sleek and oh-so-cool. and go to the restroom, even if you don't need to! each stall has a remote control so you can play with your seat! warm it, vibrate it, clean it, raise it. so japanese. so morimoto. now THIS is what i call a new york dining experience. ? or a lover's date. my fiance flew 2000 miles to spend the weekend with me - and that coulda made anything taste good :) but still. 5 stars all the way!

I'm a total sucker for details... at restaurants, I notice the little finishing touches, the presentation, the dishes and glasses, and the way the food is described on a menu. ?Well, you'll find all such details carefully thought through, and much more at Morimoto. ?I knew I would have a good dining experience here... it's hard to go wrong with the combo of Iron Chef Morimoto, Stephen Starr (the restaurateur who has changed the Philly dining scene and has recently started invading NYC), and my favorite cuisine all in a beautiful impressive space that made me gasp as I entered through the orange drapes of the front entrance. ? I brought my sister here recently... and we both loved it. ?In fact, she was still talking about it for a few days after the meal. ?So, what did we have that had us so happy? ?We ordered a bunch of items to try but the stand-outs were: ? - Ramen soup, Iron Chef's version of chicken noodle soup: This was heaven... totally unforgettable. ?I would, and could, eat this everyday. ?Nice chewy noodles in a perfectly seasoned soup with juicy pieces of chicken. ?This would put me in a good mood any day. ? - Sushi appetizer: I knew from having eaten at Morimoto in Philly that sushi is probably not the main attraction (though you'll see plenty of people ordering it). ?But we had to have at least some raw fish. ?This appetizer was tiny slivers of yellowtail, tuna, salmon, halibut, and fatty tuna all layered with a selection of sauces in mini skinny plastic test tubes. ?Fun to eat, esp breaking apart the layers of fish and trying it with different sauces. ? - Seafood toban yaki: Japanese version of a bouillabaisse... lobster, king crab, mussels, clams, huge chunks of scallops in a red miso sake broth. ?Not only was the seafood fresh and tasty, but the broth was soothing, flavorful, with a great little kick to it. ?Great for sharing. - Tofu "hot" and "cold" dessert: an amazingly great trio of tofu-based dessert: tofu cheesecake, tofu souffl, with a side of soy rice ice cream. ?The cheesecake was great... dare I say it, probably better than any cheese based cheesecake I've had, but the souffl was out of this world. ?How could tofu be this good as a dessert?!? ?Mouthwatering good. This is definitely not an everyday place... which is unfortunate since I'd love to frequent it for some of the above items, as well as a handful of other stuff I wanted to try on the menu (i.e. oyster foie gras, yase dofu, kakuni, etc). ?But maybe this is one of those places best saved for special occasions and special out-of-town guests. ?The place gives off an over-the-top / vegas vibe but you know, when it's done well, that's not a bad thing at all. ?Highly recommended.

i ordered the morimoto omikase is the chef's tasting menu, which runs $120 per person. i was a little nervous about spending so much money on a meal. plus, im not the most adventurous when it comes to trying new foods. im terrified of sushi and oysters and all that is slimy and recently alive. despite that, i ordered the 7 course tasting menu, and was pleasantly surprised. each course was delicious, and each terrifying. but with the price running so high, i felt i had no choice but to eat whatever was brought out. the presentation alone was worth half of the cost. each plate was gorgeous and tasted as amazing as it looked. yum!

Moriomoto was disappointing and I will not be back. The GM/host was very nice and offered me a couple of options for seating. ?Being indecisive, they selected the main raised dining area. ?The woman server I had was horrible which was a total disappointment since I was dining alone and was really looking forward to my lunch at Morimoto. ?She welcomed me and took my drink order. ?I couldn't decide on their special ice tea or regular brewed. ?I opted for the regular brewed. ?When she delivered the tea she also delivered a small container and small dish. ?I figured it was simple syrup to sweeten the tea. ?Um, nope... it was soy sauce (dumb move on my part). ?So now I have a soy sauce iced tea. ?When she circled back again I asked if I could please switch to the special iced tea as I didn't care for their plain brewed. ?She arrived a few minutes later with the new tea and left the old tea. ?A few more minutes progressed and I moved the old tea to the corner of the table (hopefully sending the message to remove the old tea). ?When my lunch arrived I asked her if she could please remove the old tea. ?She responds with and I quote: ?"Well, I'm not going to do anything with it!" ?In a snarky tone and walked away without the old tea. ?My jaw drops that I had just been spoken to this way and couldn't even enjoy my meal. ?After her outburst she did not visit the table again. ?Food was delivered by the expo and the clearing was done by another server and a busser. ? There was no check back on the lunch items and the old ice tea stayed on the table until my plates were cleared by another server (male - James/Freddie?), who was very pleasant. ? He removed the other tea from the table and check. ?When the original server was questioned about the incident by the GM you could very obviously tell she was upset they were removing the tea. ?My overall assessment from the servers perspective is she was ticked that I was in her section and only having a $30 lunch as I didn't order the tasting lunch, alcohol or some of their specialty sushi items she recommended. ? ? When I left, I looked for the GM to share my unpleasant experience and I unfortunately couldn't find him. ?I will share this (many of you already know this)... in serving a good wait staff can normally turn around a negative dining experience. ? Morimoto, you need some additional training on this!

The service was excellent, decor very nice and it wasn't too loud so great for a date night. Very very interesting bathroom which is worth the visit to this restaurant! LOL The food was good but not amazing. Fresh sashimi, can't go wrong. ?oh but be careful if you order the strawberry desert, it's too sweet and you'll feel like you just ate a whole bag of potpourri.

(I am sushi man. ?I review sushi.) 1. space is typical trendy meatpacking, which is to say it's made for eurotrash. ?Sliding glass doors, tall ceilings, a cavernous main dining room, all concrete and glass (and some weird white plastic curtain things). ?Sushi bar is huge and space-agey. ?Because it's huge, you can have an intimate dining experience, separated by several seats from other diners, even at peak hours. 2. ?We walked in without reservations on a friday night, dressed like bums, and were immediately offered seats at the "omakase bar." ?This means: (a) the restaurant is too big and they can't fill the seats; (b) the diners who come here don't understand sushi. ?They're eurotrash and meatpacking people. ?"omakase bar" should be the first seats to fill up. ? 3. The fish is good. ?That's what matters. ?I would be happy to come here and eat nothing but nigiri. ?We sat at sushi bar, ordered cheapest ($35) sushi set and some rolls (latter not my choice). ?Sushi set was actually a great value, although the maki was a sort of spicy inside-out tuna roll. ?("Spicy" was atypical though: it was not mayo-and-red-pepper, but some kind of black? pepper applied like a rub.) ?Nigiri was fresh, cut small (as I prefer), and expertly prepared. ?Good value at any restaurant, but especially in high-rent meatpacking. ?Rolls are typical upscale americanized rolls, like softshell crab. ?I don't care enough to comment. ?Negitoro maki (a real Japanese roll) was fresh, but done in inside-out style (fail!) and just didn't blow me away as it should have. ?Toro appeared to be really fatty though. ?Taste was good but perhaps toooo finely minced. 4. ?Chefs were all Japanese, and one near us handed us our sushi with a smile. ?Great. ?Some of their assistants were dorky white guys who clearly thought they were very cool to be working the sushi bar at morimoto. ?Well...good for them, but they will never be true sushi chefs cuz they don't even know japanese. ?But good for them. ?Staff are generically attractive non-Japanese people, and polite. 5. ?The neta in the case looked fairly high-quality, but not stunningly so. ?Ushiwakamaru's case is more appealing. 6. Tea was great, but of a lighter variety -- and then the bill comes and they charged us $8 each for it!!!! Absurd!!! ?there was no warning in advance of the charge -- we just asked for tea. ?Bad trick. 7. Dessert was a typical trendy restaurant dessert: modern take on a cheesecake. ?It was tasty, but had nothing to do with sushi. conclusion: this place serves an igorant clientele, but if you're a true sushi lover, you can find plenty of happiness here. ?Ignore everything but the fish.

Love love love. This year was my second trip to Morimoto and I got to bring a couple of friends with me. I'm so glad they got to be there and experience this place. The company helps make the dining experience better. The restaurant itself, including it's facilities, is beautiful. Very modern and hip. Classy and sophisticated. The service was amazing. We sat in the omakase section, but were able to order off the regular menu. Our server was so polite and patient, answering all of our questions patiently and thoroughly. We started the meal with: Lamb carpaccio-- WOW, melt in your mouth Wagyu beef carpaccio-- holy cow! Tuna pizza-- how is it possible for this to taste so good? For the main course: One friend had the duck duck duck, which I was lucky enough to snag a taste of. Tender, succulent, cooked perfectly. My other friend and I shared a sushi chef combo. Every single thing on the plate was interesting, delicious, fresh, beautiful and well thought out. Even the omelet was flavorful and delicious. Those normally taste like yellow rubber gloves. Not these. My husband had the Ishi Yaki Buri Bop, which is Morimoto's take on a Korean bibimbap. A hot bowl with rice, veg and an egg with slices of fish that you cook with the heat from the bowl. The rice at the bottom becomes crispy giving you different textures to enjoy. I appreciate a restaurant that can highlight the flavor of rice. Needless to say I love Morimoto and hope to dine there each time I visit NY. In the meantime, I'll be dreaming of that tender wagyu beef and fresh-from-the-sea sushi.

Morimoto did not disappoint. I highly recommend eating here. I had the Omakase, which was excellent except for one dish I found too salty, but I don't hold that against them because they just took it away and brought me a substitute more to my liking. The dishes were very innovative, with excellent fish, perfect proportions and beautiful presentation. Great service and the timing of each dish was right on. The ambiance of the restaurant is worth mentioning, it's modern, trendy and comfortable. Will visit again.

Let me just start off by saying I am prone to judging restaurants by the quality of their bathrooms - so that alone should indicate that Morimoto is off the charts. It took me a good 3 minutes to figure out how to even open the door (let me save you the future embarrassment - SLIDE, don't push!) as it was basically a nondescript wall with a long handle on the side. After I managed to figure out the contraption and glanced around quickly to make sure no one had witnessed my ineptitude (which of course they did), I stepped inside what I could only deduce to be.. The Twilight Zone. Yup, you heard (er, read) me. I just compared a public lavatory to an alternate universe. ?I freaked out about 3 times after I got into the stall - once for the automatic toilet lid, once for that trippy flower background that made me think somebody was going to peep through the glass, and the last when I realized the seat was heated (though it didn't take me long, I have a very sensitive nervous system. For those with the same, BE WARNED. It's pretty sweet after you get used to the initial shock though, and then you just think, 'This is brilliant WHY IS THIS NOT IN MY HOUSE RIGHT NOW?') Alright, moving on. What else? Oh right, the food. OK. So. Um, yeah. Everything sucked. HA! Kidding. Of course I'm kidding. We're talking about the freaking Iron Chef here, not those other watchamacallits flailing around with their pots and pans and heaps of fatty goodness on TV (Paula Deen, lookin' at you). I was with 9 other girls for my sister's bachelorette party so our shrill, overenthusiastic waitress took this opportunity to congratulate her profusely and then INSIST that she MUST try the white lily cocktail because it is TO DIE FOR. In fact, why not widely grin in everyone else's face and coerce them into getting it too? Oh, what's that? You don't drink? Well lucky for you, she's got a virgin available too and it tastes JUST AS DELICIOUS! Imagine that. Props to the lady for probably bringing in about 2/3 of Morimoto's business just from the intimidation of her nonstop chatter alone. To her credit, the cocktail was actually ah-mazing - it tasted like a pina colada with a few lemony drops to offset some of the sweetness. We got the tartare, kobe beef carpaccio, and the spicy king crab for appetizers and I must take this time to describe to you the utter ridiculousness that is Morimoto's toro tartare. Never mind that I had no idea (and still don't) what those two words meant - just know that it is like a soft blanket in your mouth. The caviar really just melts all at once and the way it's presented with the six different sauces and the delicate little scooping utensil is so distinct and lovely and unlike any dish I've ever seen or tasted that it definitely left a fond, lasting memory. My sister really liked the beef; I don't really remember it but the crab was also quite good with its warm spicy flavor, though it was a bit of a hassle to try to suck all the meat out without losing a few dignity points. Onto the main course: I ordered the roasted ocean trout, which looks very similar to salmon upon first glance but it's not, so - again saving you trouble - don't ask if it is! I think she gets that a lot because before I even finished my question, she promptly replied (with a beaming smile), "It looks like salmon but it's trout, I promise." Well whatever it was, I thoroughly enjoyed it and cleaned up every last bit on my plate. If Morimoto is known for anything, it's its surprising creativity - the texture of the soft, smooth trout with the subtle crispiness of the prosciutto and a dollop of miso sauce to top it off made for an interesting, slightly buttery but not too heavy result. All the components blended nicely and it left me feeling nice and satisfied but not nauseatingly full. DESSERT TIME! We got the tofu hot & cold (cheesecake and souffle were grade A's), chocolate ganache (not as tasty as expected), and the summer peach raspberry pudding, which was PERFECTION IN A BOWL. The light, creamy pudding paired with the sorbet was a refreshing combination and the little piece of gelatin reminded me of all the jello I ate in middle school, so it gets another boost for nostalgia too. It was, overall, a delightful confection and totally fit for a late-night summer treat. So that about sums up my first, and probably last dining experience at Morimoto. My taste buds had a blast, and the swanky interior with its wall of lighted bottles/glass was a visual feast as well and made for a nice background throughout my shameless photo-snapping. Though I will never again be able to afford such a meal, maybe it's best we end things this way with the initial magic still intact. First dates are the new second!

Hail to the Iron Chef! I have been to Morimoto's on two separate (both special) occasions... The first time I took my boyfriend here for his 23rd birthday dinner; the second time we went for NYE 2009. As a side note, I love the semicircle entrance shape of this place with its red curtains arranged across it. Very unique for a NYC restaurant! For the boy's birthday, I had written it into my reservation just as a note that it was his special day and they were sooooo nice when we arrived saying "Oh it's the birthday boy! Happy birthday!" They even gave him a special dessert at the end for free that said happy birthday on it in chocolate sauce. Totally did not expect that kind of hospitality from them which was such a lovely touch to our evening. We both ordered the Omakase which we enjoyed for the most part very much. I think our least favorite dish was the main entree (which consisted of a spicy lobster cut in half that came with cream on the side... spice was wayyy too overpowering) but all the appetizers leading up to it were phenomenal. We started off with this tuna tartar that had been smoothed onto a small wooden board planted in a bed of ice with a wooden spoon planted next to it. Uh ok, I've never eaten tartar like this before. Easily one of the best (and most creative) dishes of the evening. Another dish that stood out in my mind was the marinated tilefish sashimi. Dayyyyuuummm did that make my tastebuds sing! There was a full on Italian opera going on in mouth. The sushi course was alright... it didn't meet up to my salmon expectations (I have very high standards for salmon) but the toro was incredible. Also tried the kanpachi as this is also a big favorite of mine but I found it to be a little chewy. This meal also led me to discover my favorite dessert champagne in the entire world, Moscata d'Asti! It's crisp, fruity and it's Italian. I think I may have to serve this bubbly at my eventual goomba wedding! For NYE we came here specifically to try the fugu since Morimoto was one of the few places in the states that serves blowfish.... at least legally. We were glad that Morimoto did not require the NYE special omakase for the night when we made our reservations. I hate it when places do that... It's like no, I don't feel like being forced to pay over $200 for your special 7 course NYE meal, thanks. Props to them for that. Also, Morimoto himself was there chatting with patrons and drinking some bubbly. That was cool. I wish I had taken a picture with him... also wish I had taken a picture inside the restaurant (it's huge) and its famously beautiful downstairs bathrooms... oh well, c'est la vie. We ordered the Fugu platter (it had been flown in from Japan the day before apparently) which consisted of some sashimi cuts, skin and "Kentucky Fried Fugu" pieces. I thought the sashimi left a little to be desired but the skin and KFF were both excellent. One day I will have fresh off the boat fugu sashimi served to me in Japan!! It will happen!! Till then, Morimoto is my only option. Gochisosama! :)

i took the advantage of restaurant week nyc 2011 and went here with a friend. we were excited and got there around 11:45am, but the restaurant opened at 12pm sharp. we took a stroll around chelsea market right next door to kill time and then when we got there at noon, there was already a line forming! we were glad we had made reservations, since we got better seats :) the interior is gorgeous, and the bathroom is amazing...the toilet seats are already warmed up for ya !! haha we ordered the prix fixe, the waygu bento box, which consists of salad, tempura w/ creme sauce, miso soup, tuna, salmon, & squid sushi (1 each), salmon rolls (3) , and waygu beef w/ paprikas. as a side, we also ordered shrimp tempura rolls w/ asparagus and more salmon rolls, and they were very very good. we were so full after all these, but the dessert, which was a green tea coconut mousse w/ berries and molasses had to be consumed. it was a perfect finishing touch to a delicious meal :)

Being a fan of the Iron Chef and Japanese cuisine, I was excited when I had the chance to go to Morimoto for dinner. ?Our party of 8 made reservations for 6pm, but we arrived a bit early, so we decided to head to the bar downstairs for drinks. ?We had a bottle of champagne and waited till our entire party arrived. ?We were seated promptly after in the upstairs dining area, which provided a nice ambience. ? We had two bottles of wine and sake to start. ?Then, our ordering had began: APPETIZERS/MAINS/DESSERTS - Edamame: Nothing out of the ordinary. ?Beans with sea salt. ?Delicious. - Toro tartare: ?It was served on a wooden board with a spoon of caviar on top and a tray of sauces and pastes to accompany for taste. ?You had to scrap the tartare off the board with a metal soup and then dip into the condiment tray. ?It was really fresh and the amount was just right for a taste. - *Wagyu beef carpaccio: This was my favourite appetizer of the night! ?The wagyu pieces were thinly sliced and soaked in a pool of yuzu soy, ginger and sweet garlic. ?The flavours mixed so well together, and tasted so good. ?I think I could have easily had the whole plate if we weren't sharing. ?I would choose this again next time I come! - Spicy king crab: The crab was really fresh. ?I think comparable to the fresh king crabs I've had in Japan. ?The crab had a sweet but spicy mayo-like sauce on top. ?It wasn't too spicy, but I think I would have preferred to have it without the extra sauce to taste the freshness of the crab. - Pork gyoza: This wasn't the typical gyoza that you have in Japanese restaurants or ones you buy frozen from the grocery. ?The gyoza had a bacon foam over it. ?So you had to break through the hardened back foam, gently with the tap of a spoon, and piece out your gyzoa. ?The concept was interesting and the bacon foam was nice, but the gyoza itself didn't blow me away. - Rock shrimp tempura: The tempura was cooked with two kinds of sauces- a wasabi and sweet and sour sauce. ?I personally preferred the sweet and sour sauce. ?The shrimps reminded me of popcorn shrimp. ?The tempura was nicely cooked, and there wasn't too much tempura batter on each piece. - Yosedofu: This was tofu prepared table side. ?The taste was very fresh and the lobster ankake gave it a nice flavour. - Soft shell crab roll, salmon roll, tamago, unagi - Wagyu beef: The wagyu didn't melt in your mouth, but it was definitely noteworthy. ?It was juicy, flavorful, and worth a few helpings. - Desserts: Our party ordered one or two of everything on the menu. ?The ginger ice was refreshing, and the chocolate mousse was rich and delicious. Overall, our party enjoyed the dinner. ?The food was well prepared and the staff were attentive and surprisingly not pretentious. ?The bill for our party of 8 came to a total of $1,400. ?It may have been a bit pricey, but the experience was well worth it.

I really love this place. ?My girlfriend and I both ordered the omakase, and despite the high price, it definitely lived up to the hype. ?The omakase included toro tartare, gold yellowtail sashimi, a plate of sushi, an oyster, a green tea intermezzo, kobe beef and a half lobster topped with lemon cream, and a sponge cake with chunks of sweet potato for desert. ?I especially liked the sushi/sashimi and the lobster, which was delicate and juicy. ?These dishes seem small at first, but by the time you get to the desert, you're pretty full. ?We also had a bottle of stone pear sake. ?It was sweet and perfect for sipping alongside our meal. ?I definitely want to take a trip back to try out some of the other stuff on their menu.

Went here for Valentine's day about 2 yrs ago after a winter storm that left the city frozen with ice and snowbanks everywhere. ? Finally arrived and the hostess was nice, took our coats and checked my rain boots. ?We sat down and had some of the Morimoto cocktails which were very strong! ?I can't remember what I got but it was good. We were seated promptly and found out Chef Morimoto was actually there! ?The waiters were very nice and even went to get him for us and we got a photo opportunity. ? We all got the Omakase since it was V-day and on my way to the bathroom, I bumped into some friends at another table. ?Good thing the dividers are glass between the tables! ?I could see the entire dining area, it was a neat concept and I like the design very much. ?Everything is brightly lit and open. ?You can even see into the kitchen! Omakase included the following which I've posted pictures of: Toro Tartare (So fresh & creamy, I wanted more and loved the assorted toppings, sauces) Sweet shrimp & Mushroom salad (light & refreshing) Some type of fish gently seared with micro greens Braised oyster with kobe beef (melt in my mouth good!) Assorted sushi (The fish was soooo FRESH! and immaculately prepared) A palate cleanser of a macaroon? and freshly made green tea The main course (Broiled half lobster perfectly seasoned with foamed butter) - I could probably eat an entire lobster Kobe Beef - So delicious! Dessert - I forgot what this was but doesn't it look good? I'll definitely come back, but I need to try out the Philly location because I've heard that one is designed even better! ?I'm sure food wise, everything is the same. The bathroom bidet was also pretty cool, I was in there a while playing with all the buttons.

If you like white tuna/fish.. keep moving along and no need to stop by. I heard a lot of good thing's about this place, and wanted this place to be my go-to restaurant to take Partners/clients out based on food quality and ambiance. ?Overall, I was pleased with the quality of the hot food (tofu dishes) and sashimi (e.g., salmon, tuna, hamachi). ? However, the white tuna/ albacore was cut in a perfect square which screams out FROZEN coupled with another white fish in the chirashi was straight up FISHY. I would have given this place 4 stars if not for the dis-tasteful white fish selection. ?No need to come again... plenty of places in NYC to take Partners/clients out.

Mind-blowing. Phenomenal. Outstanding. Flawless. Superb. Outragous. Ridiculous. Thought I'd start you off with some key words that best describes this phenomenon. There is a reason folks why he has the best record as an Iron Chef. His flavors are out of control. If you've never had Yuzu or Mirin as an ingredient in a dish...you don't know squat my friend. If you're looking to get your girl to suck you off, this is the place to take her. Within entering the confines of this magnificent space, your partner will immediately drop her drawers...or maybe you'll drop yours since you'll be busy oogling at the sexy piece of ass man-ning the doors or maybe your girl will just smack you right in the kisser after catching your dumbass. Either way, someone's drawers will be coming off....either during or after dinner. Advice #1: when you go: don't shit on yourself when you taste the Kobe Beef Carpaccio appetizer. Not a good look when your on a hot date. Advice #2: don't have the "deer-in-the-headlights" look in your face when you recieve the bill....you cheap bastard. Advice #3: Stop trying to get quick glances at the hot piece of ass man-ning the doors. Enjoy & Good luck.

From the trendy location, to the sleek decor, to the great drinks, to the solid service to the even better food - this place hits the mark. I am always skeptical of restaurants by TV personalities, but this one is legit. The sushi was delicious and the appetizers were all incredible. We didn't order a "hot" entree as we really wanted sushi for dinner. The point being - whatever we ordered delivered on freshness and flavor. This place loses one star because the tables are packed too close together.When paying for dinner at this price point, I shouldn't have to concentrate to tune out the conversations to the left and right of me.

Some people call it the best meal of their life. I wouldn't go that far, but it's definitely a culinary experience. It isn't an economical meal, but it is worth the price (and you are full at the end of the meal). Cocktail lovers, please do try the White Lily!

I ate here last weekend during my first trip ever to NYC. ?I had the Omakase(chef's tasting menu) for $120 and it was a good first experience. ?It included an 8 course meal and every dish was good. ?Please keep in mind that this restaurant is a FUSION restaurant. ?Therefore each dish has lots of sauce with the actual course. ?You cannot expect your dish without some kind of sauce or glaze with it. Before I go into the food, I must say the ambiance and decor of the restaurant is really nice. ?They have a wall next to the stairs that is completely made out of crystal lights. ?Our table was the closest one to it so it was nice to take pictures by it. ?The outside of the bathroom door looks like a closet door which was weird but the inside was kinda cool. ?Check my pics. ?Anyhow here is what was in the 8 course tasting menu that I had: 1. Toro Tartare (mediocre) 2. Kampachi Yellowtail with other assorted sashimi (pretty good) 3. Seared Salmon (ok) 4. Duck Foie Gras (good because all it is is basically fat) 5. Assorted sushi including Toro and Barracuda (the toro in this dish was the best by FAR. it was perfect and completely thawed. just wish they gave more of it) 6. Matcha Green Tea and red bean filled Macaroon (how good can green tea get?) 7. Split Roasted Lobster with Garam Masala and a slice of Kobe Beef (this was better than average) 8. Souffle and Vanilla bean ice cream over red bean (better than average) The dishes were all pretty tasty but I must say I probably wouldn't order it again. ?It was great being able to taste all the different dishes but the chef could have had more of an assortment. ?Not that I don't like sashimi and sushi but I'm sure there were some other items on the menu he could have thrown in there and I probably would have preferred. ? One more thing, we also ordered a plate of Fugu before the Omakase and it was decent, mostly because the Ponzu sauce was YUM. ?The consistency of the Fugu was just ok but the Ponzu sauce was right on. Service was good as expected for this type of restaurant. ?Waiters were constanty checking to see if everyone had finished their course so that they can clear the dish and get ready for the next dish. Overall it was a good dining experience for my first trip to the Big Apple.

5 STARS--POSSIBLY ONE OF THE BEST MEALS I'VE EVER HAD! I love Iron Chef Morimoto even before he was on the U.S. version of Iron Chef, so I was super excited to try his restaurant during my NYC trip in April. I had the Omakase (Chef's 8 course tasting menu): 1. Toro Tartar: YUMMY! I loved the presentation: toro was presented like one of those mini zen gardens. It was slabbed on a piece of wood. Then condiments like small crunchy rice balls, seaweed, and wasabi were rolled up and placed on another piece of wood. Then, there was a something similar to a rake, so you can take some condiment and some toro. The toro was BUTTERY and the condiments added a great texture contrast. 2. Hamachi Sashimi with Ginger Chili: Oh-my! I love Hamachi and I love spicy foods; so this was the perfect combo! 3. Seared Kampachi w/ Mango Chutney: I normally like my fish 100% Raw! However, the slightly seared Kampachi added a layer of smokiness to the buttery fish--yummy! And, the mango chutney added just an extra flavor of sweetness and citrus which balanced everything out. 4. Assorted Nigiri (8): I can't recall all of the different types of fish, but I can say the quality of ALL of them was superb--very fresh and buttery! 5. Oyster with Uni and Foie Gras: OMG!!! Ok, so I LOVE uni and foie gras. But together???? Absolute HEAVEN! The flavor combos are indescribable: buttery, rich, salty, sweet. 6. Melon Palate Cleanser: Honeydew slushy with a cream fraiche--very refreshing! 7. Kobe Steak and Grilled Lobster: the kobe was perfectly cooked to a med. rare and was very TENDER; no need for a knife. The lobster was seasoned with a curry spice. I thought it would be overpowering, but it wasn't. It added a great kick to the sweet succulent lobster. 8. Pumpkin Souffle w/ Chestnut Ice Cream: My least fav of all the dishes. The souffle was more of a sponge cake and didn't really go well with the ice cream. The tasting menu was $120 which was worth EVERY PENNY considering the quality and the amount of food you receive. SERVICE: All the you would expect for a foo foo restaurant. Staff was attentive, explained all dishes, but of course was a bit pretentious. AMBIANCE: Decor was very shee shee--it's NYC after all! I loved the sushi bar--it was at least 20-25 feet long and all the fish laid out looked fresh from the sea. It wasn't too loud, so it was very easy to hold a convo w/o raising your voice. If I was in NYC again, I would definitely come back....Oh how I wish Chef Morimoto would open a location in the SF Bay Area. *sigh*

morimoto morimoto, i saw in the web that in 2008 you tried and rated the ramen joints and restaurants in the east village, i didn't agree with your rating but i guessed that somebody who goes around judging and rating should be as good as it gets. that is how i visited you morimoto, i thought you really knew something about ramen and that is what i ordered at your restaurant, ramen. and what do i get?.....salty clear broth with italian linguine and two shreds of chicken breast. it was sad to look at it and even more to eat it, an humiliation to pay for it. worst ramen in all ny! morimoto. thanks to the gods for minca and ippudo. you morimoto, you one star and go to hell with your ramem and arrogance.

Even for the second dinner of the day it was tasty. Our reservations were for 10:15p and we had no problems getting seated on a Friday night. ?The environment is totally like a club in Vegas. ?The centerpiece in the middle of the restaurant is beautiful, and it extends from the entrance level to lower level. The entire space is super hip, super elegant. We started out with a couple of drinks. I got the Lychee martini, I think and it was perfectly balanced, not too sweet nor to alcoholy. We got the omakase, and most of the dishes were good. ?Started off with the toro tartare, it was fresh and I liked the mix n' match the sauce to your liking kinda deal. Second dish was the whitefish carpaccio, sooo simple yet so elegant and tasty, loved this dish. ?Third ?was a heated miso ?fondue thingy- ?really salty but came out in a cool looking pot that kept the fondue warm using a tea light. ?Fourth dish was the oyster and foie gras with teriyaki sauce. ?It was good but a little too sweet. ?Fifth was a sushi sampler. Super fresh fish, and very delicious. ?A palate cleanser, then off to the sixth course, which was the lobster tail and waygu beef. ?Both cooked perfectly, but I was not a fan of the lobster. It was spiced with way too much garam masala, and destroyed the simplicity and natural sweetness of the lobster, making it way too spicy and smokey. The waygu beef though, that was melty in your mouth. Sooo good. ?Desserts were kinda blah. I think we had green tea ice cream with some kinda dry spiced cake and passionfruit sorbet. Kinda boring. ?Next time we come back we'd probably skip the omakase and just do a la carte. So once you're done with dinner, go downstairs. On the way ?to the washrooms you'll see the bar which looks like lighted ice. The bathrooms are really cool and fancy. I'd come back in a heartbeat.

My boyfriend brought me here for my birthday this year. ?It definitely met expectations. It has a very spare, minimalistic, Japanese feel inside. ?Definitely very trendy but not over the top at all. The food was impeccable and so was the presentation. ?We ordered 4 appetizers: the Morimoto sashimi - layers of sashimi each piece with a different topping on it. ?It came with tiny test tubes of delicious sauces to season it. ?Our next appetizer was some kind of salmon tuna roll, this was my least favorite of everything we ordered only because I could have gotten it somewhere else, but it was very well executed and still delicious. ?Next, we had the pastrami yellow-tail. ?I can't say enough good things about this. ?It was so flavorful and unique and came with giant caper-berries. ?The last appetizer we got was the lobster fritters. ?I didn't know what to expect when ordering these. ?They were small puff balls of japanese pastry with lobster meat inside. ?Warm, amazing, gourmet-version of Japanese street food. ?For the entree we split the duck three ways. ?I can't remember what the three ways were but they were all great. ?The dessert was a flourless chocolate cake with pear sorbet, pear, and caramelized popcorn on the side. ?The mix of fruity, salty, crunchy, chocolatey, gooey was to die for. ? We ordered a bottle of Prosecco which went nicely with everything and our server was very attentive the whole time. ?My only complaint is that we were seated in not the best corner of the restaurant. ?I had extremely high expectations with all the hype and big name around this restaurant and it met or exceeded them. ?I'd love to return.

One of the nicest and most cutting edge designed restaurants I have seen in the world. Also super expensive and small portions, kind of like a hot stripper without implants who costs you a arm and leg and leaves u slightly satisfied.. 15 dollar cocktails, super fresh sushi and a fish entrees the meant for someone with a appetite to match that of a tea cup chihuahua. Be prepared to wait for your table and "forced" or rather asked to wait at the downstairs bar for your table to be ready. My table was sandwiched between two couples and be prepared to try your best to understand what your date is saying due to the fact of the annoying conversations people are having next to you. The table to right, featured a 23 year chubby broad dining with her wealthy father errr boyfriend, there conversations weird and it wasnt until she was bombed off sakai that it looked like they were having a good time. The table to my right featured a jerry springer look alike who clearly was forced to drag out his old hag wife here for a trendy anniversary dinner. Thank god they were quiet and quickly left once my date and i showed up. Seriously this is a good spot to take your dime piece or trophy girlfriend. I used this as my trump card, shows the chick you dont mind spending some coin on her and if shes not from Manhattan and isnt a foodie she will be blown away by this place. The waitstaff here is friendly, always looking to run up the bill and refill your water 50 times over the course of a hour and a half. Spealong of bills be prepared to spend close to 100 per person, if not more depending on how much you decide to drink. Not sure I'd come back here unless it was for a client dinner where there paying the tab or if I happen to one day get dragged here by a random bimbo who demands we dine here. The Seabass was very good, super fresh and perfectly cooked, only downside it was smaller than two rolls of quarters and featured a cold side of Avocado tempura. Dessert was a nice yet oreo sized brownie, perfect for the diet conscious horrible for fat over indulging animals like myself. Sushi was top notch, not only was it super fresh but you could tell this place gets the highest quality fish that is available. Stick to Tao if your from Jersey and Nobu if your from Manhattan and actually like spending a car payment on dinner.

(This review is late by the way, it's been sitting in my unfinished reviews section since February. ?I know, I haven't been on my A game.) ? I have always been a big fan of Iron Chef and Morimoto was one of my favorites. ?My friends and I have been meaning to come here for a while now, but did not really have a reason or $$$$. ?My birthday came around, so that was our excuse to splurge. I came here for my birthday dinner and ordered the omakase. ?The first dish that came out was tuna tartare. ?It was presented and served in a way I have never seen. ?(Many people have posted pics of this, so you can see what I'm talking about.) ?It was really good though and I enjoyed being able to try the tuna with a sauce individually and then all of them together. ?I also loved the sashimi. ?It was a white fish, I forgot the name, but it melted in my mouth. ?I was not impressed by the cooked oyster. ?There was also some other dish that came out on what looks like a scented oil vase. ?You know the one with a tea candle under it. ?Well, instead of scented oil there was some salty sauce, with a hummus like consistency. ?It was a dip and it was really good. ?Be careful though, because when it gets towards the bottom it burned my tongue. ?The main course was lobster and steak, it was also good but it didn't blow my mind. ? Like any fancy schmancy restaurant you leave hungry. ?Service was great and the food was good. ?The decor was also amazing. ?Yes, you should definitely use the restrooms while you are there. ?Although it was a great experience, I probably will not be returning anytime soon. ?(I can't afford to dine like that.)

Morimoto is a lot of fun - housed in a gorgeous spacious modern dining room in an awesome part of the city it offers a pretty spectacular dining experience. ?Very professional staff and of course really awesome toilets. ?The food was creative and fun, the oysters with the fois gras and unagi are delightful, and the sushi is quite good. ?I found the toro tartar to be rather hyped on this site.

Service and atmosphere are top notch. Even visiting just to see the restrooms is highly reccomended. Food was delicious, but a little underwhelming. The Torro Tartare appetizer was reccomended by our waiter, but I can't help feeling as though it wasn't deserving of the $30 plus price. The morimoto sake was definitly worth it, however. I don't know if I would go back, but worth a trip. The bar downstairs might be fun though.

Yeah, yeah, yeah all the sleek lines, the Japanese minimalism, a crazy architectural details everywhere you look... All of these design aspects invoke an overall calming, almost zen like feeling; embrace you as you walk in the door. take a deep breathe and let it all out.... yeah just like that.... And that's just in the first few minutes. If a restaurant can invoke such a feeling just by the design, you can only imagine how the food is gonna make you feel. So i made 530 reservation on http://opentable.com. We got there are quarter past 5 and this place was dead. We went downstairs to the bar area. We took a look at a drink list and ended up with some crazy exotic cocktails. I can't even begin to describe what was in these libations but shoooooot. they were very good. White Lilly and maybe a snapdragon were they're names. The hostess comes and grabs us, and shows us to our table. yeah we really didn't need to see a menu, we were obviously getting the Chef's tasting menu. I think there was a total of 6 courses, Both of us eat just about anything that lives in the ocean, so we were down for putting our Culinary future in the hands of the sushi gods (big smile). The first course that came out was tar tar of TORO. Benny likathe TORO and yes TORO completely deserves to be written in CAPS cause it freggin rocks. This dish was obviously awesome. It was sprinkled with some caviar, and then had some soy, for dipping as well as 6 condiments for the mixing, they were some wasabi, sour cream, avocado puree, soy paste, and a few others that escape me at the moment. The next course was a carpaccio of Tile fish. This was my first experience with Tile fish and it will be hard to beat. Lightly dressed with soy and ginger, this dish left me with no desires. I was completely satisfied. After the Tile fish we were served an oyster course. At the bottom of the bowl was teriyaki reduction, then a cooked oyster which was topped with sea urchin and on top of that was some foie gras. The sauce was soo rich but didn't overpower the natural flavors of the oyster, sea urchin and most importantly the foie gras. Next up was a selection of nigiri. There was a semi fatty tuna, barracuda, golden eye snapper, shrimp, and a few others. The golden eye was amazing.... Like downright amazing. In the famous words of Linda Richmond, it was like butta. Then there was an intermezzo. It was a shooter filled honey dew puree topped with some coconut milk and sage foam. we were instructed to sip not shoot this. Yeah, it was definitely meant to be savored. After the intermezzo, then came the main entree. It was surf in turf. HMMM... it was a small Maine lobster cut in half and heavily seasoned with some Indian spice, real nice flavor. So you didn't get a ton of lobster meat. Opposite of the lobsta was a piece of wagyu beef. This was atop some Japanese potatoes in a puddle of au jus. SOOO freggin good. Now i know why wagyu beef is soo spendy. To conclude our chefs tasting, was some chestnut flavored ice cream and a pumpkin souffle. It was ehh, not my favorite desert. One other noteworthy aspect of Morimoto was the bathroom stalls. It was kind of like stepping into Alice and wonderland for one hot minute. Damn Alice, those mushrooms were strong! Sure they have urinals and I only had to pee, but i went into the stall cause it was soo effing cool. It was like staring into space and time... trippy. All in all this was an amazing meal. ?Unless you're an ultra baller, this is strictly a special occassion kind of place. ?Great atmosphere and delicious food and trippy bathrooms, what more could you ask for?

Had an awesome dinner here. ?Ordered mainly appetizers, and ended up with more than enough food. ?I guess I didn't think the portions would be as large as they were. ?The spicy King Crab was awesome - the biggest leg of crab I've ever seen. ?The highlight was the Fugu special - served up in a variety of ways - fugu fin soaked in sake (that you drink), fugu sashimi, fried fugu (like fugu fish'n'chips), and fried bones (nice and crunchy)... this is probably the only place, outside of Japan, that I'd trust to serve me fugu. ?I still have dreams about that fugu - I want to go back, just for that (although I know it's seasonal).... ?but I live 5000 miles away.

If I thought I was going to be horribly disappointed, I would have avoided this sub-par restaurant. I felt like I was paying for the decor similar to when you go to Rainforest Cafe or Planet Hollywood (back in the day). ?What prompted me to go here was that it was adjacent to my work and I thought I'd give it a try. I had the Ishi Yaki Buri Bop. Never have I been so disgusted by the melody of the flavors. I learned to hate yellowtail that day and the menu was very deceiving. This entree came with garnished seaweed (or at least what was supposed to be a garnish) and was pumped with MSG. Bad, bad, bad. The Morimoto Sashimi appetizer wasn't as bad since it required no cooking, but I would highly suggest not going here unless you're a naive tourist willing to spend 50+ for an entree not worth your time. Go to a real sushi place and not the Rainforest Cafe of Japanese.

Oh how I wanted to like this place, but it was just okay. ?Yes, I see all the wonderful food photos on Yelp!, and I hope to return to Morimoto one day to try some different dishes and review it again.... but, until then, my 2-star rating stands. THE FOOD Ok, here's the deal. I went to Morimoto during Restaurant Week in NYC. ?So, shouldn't the restaurant be trying to impress me during this time--that is, impress me enough so I'd want to return? ?Well, Morimoto certainly failed the test here. ?Me and 3 other guests ordered the featured Restaurant Week lunch Bento Box. ?The presentation was excellent as I guessed it would be, but the serving size was only enough for a small child. I was displeased that I spent $24 and was still hungry. ?You see, I work out about 2 hours a day and do a ton of walking, so it takes alot to fill me up. ?I looked around at other tables of fellow diners who didn't order from the Restaurant Week menu and was appalled at what Morimoto was trying to pass off to me as "lunch"--every other table had huge portions of Japanese cuisine--while me and my guests were served 1 piece of meat-- yep, the beef Bento Box featured just 1 piece of teriyaki about the size of a 50 cent piece and about as thin as a credit card. Sure, they threw in a minimal salad composed of a few blandly seasoned greens, and a couple of pieces of a California roll (which tasted like just about any other California roll I've tried), and a couple of pieces of tempura vegetables... but, again, not nearly enough food to serve to a reasonably-sized adult. THE ATMOSPHERE Morimoto's interior is lovely, and the decor is modern and simple. I like how they have divided their dining room up so that the dining experience seems more intimate. THE FINAL VERDICT I guess the jury's still out for me. I was really burned during this last visit, so maybe if friends convince me to go back, I'll give it another try. Not sure if it's worth my time yet or not. I'll need to be persuaded.

morimoto is the only place where they serve sparkling sake. yes kids, sparkling sake!! it's a bubbly and sweeter version of the traditional sake. and it's the best cocktail ever. ok, so they sell a small shot glass size of the tokimeki for the same price that you can buy the bottle at but it's worth it. i've been on a search to find other restaurants that serve this very hip sake but haven't found it, yet... as for dinner, i thought the omakase was a bit pricey for my taste. so i opted for the hamachi tartare and the sashimi salad. they were both good but can't say it was the best i've ever had... the sashimi was very fresh, though. my fiancee had the 16oz kobe steak and he said it was the best kobe steak he's ever had. and let me tell you, he's had a few! the night that we were there mr. morimoto was there making his rounds. and like dorks we took pictures with him!

I had the opportunity to eat here, along with four other friends for Restaurant Week. The interior was beautiful and the ambiance was perfect. Before coming, I was afraid I would dislike any snobby vibe I would get eating here, but the service we received was excellent. We all ordered the pre-fixed three course lunch bento with braised black cod, which I think might be offered year-round. To really experience the menu though, my friends and I ordered the tuna pizza and the raw oysters. The tuna pizza was creative and delicious, and so were the oysters, with a selection of 3 unique topping sauces. Our bento boxes were very chic, and gave us a chance to sample a little bit of everything. The braised black cod was melt in my mouth delicious. The bento box also came with some plain-looking salmon and tuna sushi. I thought it was plain-looking but it was NOT plain-tasting. Usually, I don't enjoy tuna sushi very much. I find it edible and can have a few pieces at other restaurants, but never usually find it as satisfying as salmon. The tuna sushi here just tasted damn good. There was something buttery and simply perfect about the fish here. We finished off with green tea mousse, and went home crying tears of joy.

Honestly, we expected a lot more out of Morimoto's restaurant. The decor was excellent, but when it comes down to it, we'd rather eat great food in at a whole in the wall shack, than crappy food at a nice, lavish place. Don't get me wrong, the food here wasn't crap, but it definitely was over hyped and definitely not the best bang for your buck. If Morimoto had gone with less fusion and more traditional tastes, I think we would have enjoyed it much better. For the same price, I'd rather eat at Nobu's any day!!!

Came back here this past weekend with some out-of-towners from cali, and yes, still love it as much as I always have. ?Yes, still had to go to the bathroom bc I love feeling trippy looking into the glass wall. ?They sat our party of 6 on the right side of the restaurant at one of the large communal tables, but left a few seats between us and the other party so it was fine. Food was EVEN BETTER this time. ?Still got the toro tartare and the yosedofu, but ordered some things we never ordered in the past. ?I was pretty adventurous this time... we had the beef carpaccio special that was slightly cooked in hot oil - melts in your mouth. ?This was nothing too crazy for me to eat, but we also ordered the lamb carpaccio special. ?I don't eat lamb b/c of the gaminess, let alone RAW lamb. ?But, I succumbed to peer pressure... and actually enjoyed it. ?No gaminess in raw lamb. ?And like the beef carpaccio, melted in my mouth. ?Also had fugu (blowfish, pufferfish). ?I didn't even have this when I was in Osaka. ?But again, I succumbed to peer pressure. ?No Morimoto chef would prepare this dish incorrectly, so I knew I would not die of poison! ?Was interesting... a little chewy, didn't have much taste, but the yuzu dipping sauce it came with was refreshing. ?We also had the uni special and these pieces of uni were the biggest pieces of uni I've ever seen at a restaurant. ?But by far, my FAV app was the oyster foie gras... a kumamoto oyster with foie gras, uni, and teriyaki sauce. ?I'm not a big oyster person, not a big foie gras person, but this was so, so, so ridiculously good. ?I feel like I'm a changed person. The apps definitely stole the show. ?We ordered a few rolls for dinner entrees along with the whole roasted lobster epice and the seafood tobanyaki which included lobster, king crab, mussels, clams, and diver scallops all in a red miso-sake broth. ?All were dee-licious. ?For dessert, my fav part was the tofu souffle in the "hot and cold" tofu dessert entree.

Holy bejeezus, this place is amazing. Especially for a lover of Traditional Asian and exceptional cheffery. ( I here by trademark that word) ?The cocktails are innovative yet accessible ? ?I had the Shiso Pop, essentially a shiso gin mojito. ?Shiso has been my flavor of the year and to find this cocktail that works made me very happy. The toro tartare ?is a phenomenal presentation (pic to be uploaded) and the foie gras oysters is one of the most decadent dishes out there. Our table had two dishes with table side prep which was fun but a bit overwhelming. The yellowtail isis bin risi dosi ( I am just throwing up letters there, they will know what you mean) was full of flavor and fun as was every other entree I tried. ? The atmosphere is very cool from the moment you walk in and the service was great , but I did have to ask a few times for more water. Also, it is on 10thave, which is a bit of a weird location in NYC. Overall a must try if you have some cash to part with.

My friend and I went there for RW, because otherwise we would normally never be able to afford to go there. The outside had orange fabric hanging, and the name of the restaurant was on the glass in grey, somewhat hard to spot being that it wasn't large either. Inside i was greet and seated near the sushi bar. The decor of the place showed that Mr Iron Chef dropped major $$$ on the place. He seems to like glass and a lot of it. The wall on ?stairs down into the bar area was covered in what seemed like glass bottles. There were sectioned off booths with glass if you will. We sat right at the sushi bar in the corner. The staff working there was very friendly offering to take pictures, and chatting it up with customers. Though there was an incident where one chef was screaming at another. It was an open kitchen, and everyone could clearly see into it, however when you're that open, raising your voice to yell or downgrade someone makes the restaurant look somewhat bad. I think it is safe to assume that patrons don't want to see what happens behind the closed doors of a kitchen, and if you have to discipline someone please make note we can all hear you. I ordered the kobe bento box for lunch not on restaurant week. My friend ordered the angry chicken. that came with miso soup, salad and that's about it. I ordered a shooting star sakatini. Very strong, for $12. My bento box came with a seafood soup and clams. it was light and not too salty. The sushi was good, but not as hyped up as i had expected. The salad was fresh and light. The kobe beef was tender but a tad too salty. My friend's soup and salad was very good. He never likes miso soup but he loved it. His entree the angry chicken was very spicy. He wasn't expecting it to be so spicey but he said it was damn good. Splurging we had dessert, a pecan carmel brownie, plated perfectly and lovely, and very tastey, the brownei was still warm, the ice cream melted perfectly into it. We were full and satisifed at the end of the meal, but it was a bit pricey for lunch. I had expected the sushi to be so much more, perhaps it was too hyped up, and maybe I was expecting Morimoto to perpare it. Alas, it is a good restaurant, for the person with that extra buck to spend on sushi. and yes he has the super awesome super cool japanese toilet in the bathrooms downstairs, the ones with the heated seats that vibrate, fan and splash ur butt, in a good way. course they disabled all the buttons so i couldn't play with it all.

In the middle of the stinky meatpacking district of NY, you will find Morimoto... ?as you enter the restaurant, the decor will amaze you, I have to say, it is quite spectacular. ?The food was mediocre. ?It's nice to have tried Iron Chef Morimoto's food, but I don't think I'd return. ?The food was fresh, as the restaurant is famed for.. from the vegetables to the broth of the soup... Fresh! ?Maybe I had my hopes up really high, but I was really hoping to try to some really excellent sushi here. ?The Kobe beef carpaccio was delicious, as was the hamachi tartare. ?The regular dinner plates were quite good as well. ?Okay, I might return for the Kobe Beef Carpaccio - it really was yummy!

More like 4.5 stars. Amazingly fresh fish, in an exquisitely designed, bright, airy oasis of light, flowing fabrics, and water bottles (yes, water bottles, but the effect is tremendous), within the Meatpacking District. Start with the Miso soup, probably the best Miso I'e ever had. Go for any Kobe beef dish, its genuine Kobe. Toro tartare and assorted nigiri gave delightful pause.

I'm not sure where to start with my review because I'm getting a little giddy just thinking of how wonderful everything was - and I'm not one to gush over food. For starters the Hydrangea martini (citron vodka, lychee, lemon juice, and grapefruit) was outta this world. ?If they made this "to go" I would have left with a few gallons, but luckily they aren't shy about posting what goes into them so I will definitely try my hand at them! We started off with the Kobe beef carpaccio which was loaded with flavor. ?If you are looking for a something on the plain side this would certainly not be it as it comes out dripping in oil and seasonings, but all the same it was completely fantastic. Our dinner was just the basic sushi and sashimi plates which came in a nice presentation and were quite good. ?The fish was definitely some of the freshest I have had and I quite enjoyed it. ?The spicy tuna roll was stellar and the eel avocado roll was great, just not worth writing home about. At the end of the meal our waitress (who was insanely attractive) pleasantly surprised us with a sampler plate of desert things for my bday. ?They were good but I was still glowing after the dinner! Ezra (below) summed up my feelings quite well "I haven't been to a restaurant in recent memory ?where I didn't care what the bill was becuse the meal was so divine. ?Morimoto was the 1st in far too long."

Okay. The food was delicious and innovative but couple of things to reconsider... I made my reservation and arrived on time. Not only did the hostess rudely said that the table is not ready, she gave me a demeaning look when I said I dont want to wait at the bar. The total wait time was 15-20 mins. Of that time frame, there were a few groups that left the place and the place was not packed. Whats even worse is that I had to actually walk up to the hostess and ask her the status of our table and finally she sat us down! Imagine I didnt? Why would a hostess has such a high ego and look down at a customer that will drop a few hundred dollars? Just the two of us, we spent a bit more than $450. The food is excellent for 100 per person but $220+, i dont think its justifiable. In addition, get ready to be insulted by the hostess.

4.5 stars if I had a choice my experience at morimoto was quite fabulous actually... I first have to start off by commending their service. They are professional, attentive, nice and all restaurants should learn from them. I planned a birthday dinner there this past weekend on a busy Saturday evening for a party of 8. We were seated promptly and the location of our table turned out to be excellent. I was worried about being seated downstairs in the lounge area, but the seclusion worked out to our advantage. Our server realized that everyone I was with was underage. He genuinely apologized for not being able to serve drinks to the birthday girl (who only turned 20) and guests so he gave us 4 free appetizers: tuna pizza, mozzarella ball things, something that tasted like sweet and sour shrimp, and lastly something similar to the sweet and sour shrimp but in a different sauce. I ordered the angry chicken and switched half way with my friend for her cod. The rest of my party ordered sushi rolls and maki rolls. I do have to mention that the food was just okay. I mean it was better than okay, but I really expected a lot more from such a notable chef!! All in all, the ambiance was great, the decor is absolutely amazing, the bathrooms are really cool as everyone says it is, the food presentation is really a wow factor and it really wasn't as expensive as I thought it would be. Although we got free appetizers, the average price per person was $40-$45 (but remember we didn't order drinks either).

We went on a very casual weeknight ?looking for decent Japanese food, so we didnt have a huge appetite. We ordered several rolls, ramen soup, Japanese beers, and ?dessert-it was ok. Service was a little snooty but the ambience is pretty cool. Would go back for the prefixe only if others want to. ?Good for dates, casual business dinners and tourists.

It's hard not to be impressed by the sleek and modern decor of Morimoto. ?I had been aching to try this place and what better opportunity than restaurant week. ? Went for lunch, since they're only participating during that time, and had the Braised Black Cod Bento Box. ? Each box comes with what is probably the best miso soup you'll ever have, salad (eh), yummy tempura, the freshest sushi & ?fruit panna cotta. ?The Black Cod was melt in your mouth amazing; I only wish the piece was larger. ?The sushi was also great and had the right amount of rice. ? Drinkswise I recommend the Hydrangea. ?Don't remember what was in it and it's not on their menu online but it was incredible.

Sushi is my favorite food, i could everyday! So, I was definitely excited about trying out Morimoto. Considering he is a Iron Chef, I was sure that the food would be excellent. 1. Reservations were easy to make ( about 10 days in advance). We arrived about 15 minutes early ?and when we checked ?the hostess kindly invited us to enjoy the bar informing us that someone would come get us when the table was ready "closer to our reservation time". The bar staff was friendly and provided us with a lounge menu.. which is a shorter version of the full menu. 10 minutes after 9pm ( our reservation time) we went back upstairs since no one had come ?to get us yet. We waited until about 9:15-9:20ish and then we were sat. 2. The seating was intimate. There were a few small tables along the edges, and then big long tables, where parties were separated by an empty seat between them. 3. Our server approached us, never told us his name or anything. He just asked what kind of water we wanted, and gave us the wine menu. We ordered Miso Soup and the Udon noodle trio as appetizers. Both dishes were excellent. The miso soup was filled with a ton of tender tofu. Its the definitely the best i;ve ever had. They bring you a huge full size bowl, fit to share with a few people or have ?a lot left over! The Udon noodle combo came with a plate of condiments and sesame sauce(?). It's served cold . ( the server told us this when ordering) 4.The menu has different Japanese ?meals, but we ordered 4 maki sushi rolls.(names might not be exact) Shrimp Tempura Roll, BBQ eel roll, Soft Shell Crab roll, and California roll. I requested that they add fish roe to the California roll, and the server was happy to make that happen. 5. We waited a little over a half hour for the sushi to arrive. ?They were all coated with sesame seeds, which i didn't really like. We sat there with empty water glasses. ?Our server didn't check on us one time through the dinner. I wanted a pepsi, but couldn't get his attention even as he walked by constantly. Bus boys were clearing plates from all the tables as dinner was going on. They were efficient and polite. After we finished our meal, ( about 7 minutes later) our server finally checked on us.. he didn't ask how the meal was, simply just asked if we wanted dessert. After we declined, he brought us the check, and then finally filled our water glasses. He lingered around the table, waiting for me to pay the check. The second closed the book, he picked up the check and said thank you. He was so quick to take the money, and could hang around the table waiting for me to pay, but he could ask even once if we needed anything or how the meal was. 6. In conclusion, The sushi tasted really fresh, the staff with exception of my waiter , seemed nice . The service really lacked. I was offended by how he carried himself. ?The decor is beautiful, and the ambiance is relaxing. I would definitely suggest trying out Morimoto, because the food excellent. Just try not to get the server we got. I would give it 3 1/2 stars if possible.

kind of disappointed. i'm giving it 3 stars cause i liked their drinks (esp. the white lily) and the toro tartare for appetizer. otherwise, everything else was mediocre. service kinda sucked...but i think it's because we were seated inside this room that's seemed sectioned off from the rest of the restaurant. i almost felt claustrophobic cause we were literally in this big white cube...could barely see the other people out on the main floor. i like modern, straight line designs. but, morimoto's felt a little too sterile for my taste. the bathroom was nice though. i would go back for cocktails and try the omakase next time. if it still doesn't wow me, then i'd definitely say it's not worth the money.

I am in the mind frame that there are preconceived notions as to what is expected when visiting a place with such a renowned "Celebrity Chef", .aka. Iron Chef Master and it can either go one of two ways. The first is that this place can astound and flirt with each one of your senses, making your eating experience one that will be unforgettable. The other is that its ambiance, clientele and interesting menu could possibly turn off patrons by its quirkiness and overall creativity. I am in the former boat, I found my experience at Morimoto beyond incredible, it fired on all pistons and tempted me like the goddess vixen Aphrodite herself! It's hard to know where to begin with this review, simply because walking into Morimoto you are dazzled by the ambiance, the thrill of being in the presence of the end-product of a Master Chef who knows exactly how to execute the perfect Japanese meal, i'll do my best in convening each aspect of the meal - Drinks - I started off with the Moritmotini; a delicate blend of wasabi infused vodka, cucumber and ginger. The cocktail was clean, crisp and delicate. The wasabi infused vodka was extremely smooth and the coolness of the cucumber allowed your palate to cleanse itself at the end. Their selection of sake is superb and the one that came to the table (forgot the name) was crisp, smooth and hinted of sweet ginger and rice. Starters - Toro tartare: Ingenious, simplistic and delicious. This dish managed to play off of numerous textures and flavors. The combination of the crunchy pieces and the various sauces and the extremely fresh tuna. This dish pleased on different levels. Tuna Pizza: One of the smartest dishes I've ever consumed in a Japanese restaurant. What better way to introduce a delicacy such as raw fish to an ever-hesitant American consumer. Not to say that I was blown away with the dish itself, as I found it to be a bit underwhelming, I thought that the idea behind the dish was superb. Oyster Foie Gras: I saved the best for last... I can't even put into words how fantastical this dish was. It punched me in the face, knocked me off of my seat and stepped on my foodie gonads. It was thought provoking, tongue tantalizing and sexy. Each layer of flavor was upfront and hit your palate like a parade of tasty goodness. I would've preferred a little less teriyaki sauce, as it did take away from the flavor of the foie gras/oyster combo, but all in all, it was a perfect bite. Sushi / Raw Bar - Chef's Raw Combination: Basically a raw tower with crab, lobster, oysters and scallops. Everything is beyond fresh and served in an extremely intricate display. My favorite were the oysters, they were slurpingly delightful and had that amazingly fresh straight-from-the-ocean flavor. I was enamored to say the least. The scallop was also a highlight, great texture and amazing flavor. Sushi/Sashimi (Chef's Combo) - WOW. That's all I can say! I remember having a piece of tuna, that was cut perfectly, just enough fat and meaty enough to satisfy the palate. The tuna was so tender it melted in my mouth. Phenomenal... just flat out incredible. The caviar was fresh and almost seemed mildly sweet and not like the normal salty type. I don't even think I need to mention how tasty and mouthwatering the eel was.... I actually don't think I need to say anything more about how incredibly fresh and clean the sushi was. Ambiance - Considering the location, Morimoto has done it right. Instead of going the traditional Japanese-style sushi house (Matsuri anyone?). Morimoto opted for the stylish, swanky and dare I say it warped and pretentious yet welcoming decor that one would expect from a Iron Chef and master culinarian. If their purpose was to shock, delight and awe.. let's just say Mission Accomplished. Loved the chairs, the lighting, the intricate bathroom operations, and the lit-up bottles lining the wall. Overall, Morimoto is not so much a restaurant as it is an experience. One that is supposed to take you away from your everyday mundane existence and into the future, taking traditional Japanese food and flipping it on its ass. Morimoto takes no prisoners and executes your taste buds with an audacity that is rightfully so. I already cannot wait for my next tour of duty at Morimoto where it will delight and bewilder my stomach once again.

Morimoto is THE dining experience. I had the black cod fish bento, he had the beef bento. Everything was sooo flavorful and perfect. The cod fish and sushi pieces melted in my mouth!!! Also, def check out the bathroom! It's soo innovative!! WARNING: hypnosis by the mirrors is probable.

Went there for restaurant week. ?Maybe I was expecting too much from all the hype it always gets. ?It was a very nice restaurant when I first walked in and there were tons of ppl in there. ?I was definitely feeling good about the place. ?We were sat at a table in the corner next to the front. ?Not so good because there were definitely better areas of the restaurant that looked much nicer. ?anyways, ?I care more about the food than anything else. ?I had the salad which had some crusted onion type material on it (I forgot the name) but it tasted like the seasoning packet from a ramen package like Mama noodles. ?I didn't think it was that bad though. ?I then had the main course which was one yellowtail and scallion maki roll and 8 pieces of sushi. ?I was impressed by the decent amount of fish. ?However, ?the quality of fish was the same thing I could get from any standard sushi joint in my neighborhood. ?The maki roll had a mushy texture of processed yellowtail inside the roll. ?I have seen that pureed type of fish at really bad sushi restaurants. ?They need to have whole pieces of yellowtail in their rolls. ?Basically I was throughly unimpressed by it since I was expecting so much from this restaurant. ?They do have nice bathrooms though (make sure you pull the handle...little confusing at first..you'll know what I mean). ?On a side note, I did see a nice 60 year old something with his 20 something date who looked thoroughly disinterested in the conversation but was happy to be wined and dined at Morimoto's. pros: ?nice atmosphere, great waitstaff, prompt service cons: ?low grade sushi for such a supposedly high grade joint, expensive I wouldn't recommend this place unless you were bringing a date that cared less about food and more about being taken out for an expensive meal at a nice looking restaurant.

Five stars mr. morimoto. ?Although not a dedicated gluten free list...and not very many options, the waitstaff was very attentive and aware of my allergy and took all the necessary precautions to make my visit as enjoyable as it could be. ?I ended up having this amazing shashimi salad to start, lobster for dinner, and sorbet for dessert. ?all gluten free and amazing.

My husband and I had the omikase this time - and it was absolutely delicious! 7 courses of delightful flavors and textures - a true delight to my taste buds! The only downside was that neither of us were full after spending well over $400 on dinner. We ended up hitting up Magnolia for some extra calories to finish off the night. It's def worth trying the omikase once, but I don't think I'll do it again - perhaps next time I'll order a la carte. I know it's nyc, but practically sitting on your neighbor's lap during dinner just isn't enjoyable either.

I went here for my birthday... and tried Morimoto's tasting course... it was excellent! you get to sample a bit of all his signature dishes... if you like drinks on the sweeter fresher side try their watermellon cocktail... the only two small DINGS i have with this place are 1) the dessert was a mango/peach/green tea mousse that tasted a bit metallic... wish I had tried a chocolate dessert instead... and 2) they charged us $8 for water!! if you're going to spend $400 on two people you wouldn't expect a place like Morimoto's to charge you for water,

I love SUSHI! Japanese food is definitely one of my favorites. I knew I was going to like this place before getting here but I didn't expect to love it this much. I've actually never been to Nobu 57 yet which I heard has the best sushi in NYC, but I have to say as for now...Morimoto is my favorite Sushi place in New York City or any city I've visited. I ate lunch here during restaurant week and the food is amazing. I love love love the tuna pizza which I highly recommend for you to get as an appetizer! The portions are actually very decent for a Japanese restaurant. I'm a very big eater so if I say it's decent then it means it'll fill you up for sure. The ambiance is very moderate during lunch time but I'm sure it becomes a lot more energetic in the evening. The bathroom is HOT!!! Definitely stop by the restroom when you get there. It's worth just visiting for the restroom, I keed but I'm just trying to get my point through that "THIS PLACE IS WORTH A TRY!!! Haha I look forward to go back for dinner next time! =]

My experience here was during restaurant week. The restaurant is beautiful, high ceilings and comfortable chairs. The staff was well informed and even gave my group a description of what makes this restaurant noteworthy as it was our first time. The tuna pizza was wonderful. Fresh tuna and the sauce drizzled on top cemented the taste. The soft crab roll and spicy tuna roll were the best I've had; both recommendations of our waitress and I see why. The bento box gave me a little taste of heaven. The black cod was to die for, absolutely phenomenal. The salad was not my favorite but the miso soup, sushi and tempura were great.... Hands down great experience.

I was a bit hesitant about going here as I'm not a huge fan of shi-shi places as the service tends to be snobby. We ended up arriving 15 minutes before our reservation but were seated right away in a nice section of the restaurant. ?The service was very friendly and helpful. The mixed greens with kabosu vinaigrette had just the right amount of zing and oh-my-gosh goodness. I could drink the vinaigrette by itself. ?I had the angry chicken which was absolutely delicious. It's angry alright. ?Definitely gives a huge kick of flavor in every bite. Once again, the sauce was amazing. Kudos to whoever the Saucier is. During our meal, Guy Fieri came in to place a lunch order. Very nice guy! For dessert we split the hot-and-cold tofu. Very interesting texture. Overall, a D-licious meal. Would definitely return.

My girlfriend and I had a pleasant lunch at Morimoto. ?The sushi was really good but I had an issue with the Kobe Beef bento box my girlfriend had. ?I assumed that it would of been nice slices of Kobe beef or a good portion of steak but instead we got it "Bulgogi" style. ?It was chopped to hell and had way too many onions and not enough beef. ?My girlfriend didn't complain and enjoyed her meal so I enjoyed my meal as well. ?The drinks were fantastic and the desserts were great. ?One concern was that our server treated us like we were 5 year olds and kept asking us if we knew the difference between sushi and sashimi was and he was very inattentive as well. ?But the food was good so I would go back.

I know, I know, most people would be wow'd over this place - the cavernous interior, the funky blue/white lighting, the vibe of people that think that they are all the "in crowd". ? Well I have 3 words for you Morimoto: ?GET OVER IT! Seriously, I've been to annoying hush carpeted French places that were less arrogant. ?Please focus on the customers rather than make me feel like I'm soooo privileged to be there. ?At least some of the French places have really great service, and in French! OK, that's enough ranting, now for my review: 1. Food - sushi and noodles was surprisingly meh given expectations. I eat Japanese in the city about 1-2 times per week and I was rather disappointed. ?This is definitely above average and I would usually say 3.5-4 stars for the food but I need to say meh and 3 stars given the hoopla around the rep. ?However, I totally LOVED the tofu cooked right at your table and sakes selection was awesome but watch the wallet on ordering your faves. 2. Service - I had a reservation and mentioned that I wanted to be seated NEXT TO, not ACROSS FROM my husband of now 10 years. ?The sushi bar, a table where we can sit together, etc. ?Instead, we were taken to a row of tiny tables for 2 where I couldn't hear him over the loud, annoying bankers around us spending more bailout money. ?Finally, I asked to be moved. ?In a very cool attitude, I was told no, nothing. ?There were so many empty tables! ?I stood my ground and said that we'll wait. ?Then, told in a hushed whisper, "well, the MAN himself is here today, so you know...." ?Okay, okay, his esteemed presence has chosen to be there, I'm eternally grateful, but can I get a seat next to my husband. ?FINALLY, got the table I wanted and was informed that we were extraordinarily lucky and that that through a little crack in the window there, over the heads of the people in front of us, I might actually, yes, gulp, get a glimpse of the iron chef himself. ? ?WOW, serves me right for going to a celeb chef restaurant, what was I thinking? ? 3. Ambiance - yes, very cool decor, however the vibe is actually mostly tourists and bankers. ?Some people celebrating something (yes, ok, including me, so that would certainly not make me contribute to the coolness factor, I'm out on my anniversary, do you want to be in the same restaurant as me?)

Great restaurant design. Tasty and unique iced tea with muddled blueberries. Classic and beyond-fresh sashimi. Just OK wagyu beef bento box...nothing unique or impressive. Unbelievably delicious eel, avocado and foie gras bop bowl! Not-so-professional or knowledgeable waiter...struggled to describe the sashimi plate. I'd love to go again and try their dinner tasting menu.

This place is the real deal. Tasting menu was better than Nobu's. A number of very interesting and exciting choices starting with a raw chilled tuna with caviar, a sashimi course, a sushi course, a tea course, and all culminating in a lobster and kobe beef course. Some people call the service "snobby", but I would just call it "Japanese". The decor is amazing, and there is a definite party atmosphere going on at the downstairs bar area. The bathrooms are quite uniquely designed as well (no spoilers). The chef even came out to say hello (to his loyal fans).

I know this place has been criticized for being too glitzy and overpriced, but I have to say I enjoyed our dinner exerience here immensely. The restaurant was projected by Tadao Ando, and it is truly a spectacular space. The food was equally impressive and served promptly by a very large crew of waiters. I would go there anytime again.

this was a really nice restaurant and I would recommend for the experience. 1. ?Food - It was overall good but a few things were just okay. ?The angry chicken was not that great. ?The appetizers are good, sea bass is good. 2. ?Service - It was okay. ?Our server was late so another server helped and once our server arrived for her shift she was all over the place. ?Took a while to get things, ask for refills, etc. ? 3. ?Restroom - This was probably the coolest thing, I know, I know but it was. ?The restrooms have heated seats, mechanical toilets with sensors to lift or close the seats, washing and drying options on the toilet. ?Very cool and weird. ?The decor in each stall was very cool mirrored cherry blossoms that seemed to go forever in the mirrors. 4. ?Decor - The restaurant itself is very clean and all white with light wood finishes.

I've had the Chef's Omakase. It was an amazing experience and the most memorable dish was the Toro Tartare with Caviar and 6 Condiments, finished with a Japanese Berry. I also brought my mom here on a separate occasion during the restaurant week but we were disappointed by the poorer-than-expected quality of the ingredients. I would recommend others to try the Omakase.

Toss the menu aside- go for the omakase experience. You won't be sorry. But you will leave the restaurant with a stupid grin on your face because you ate a fantastic meal, despite the sad state of the economy. In a time of many important decisions, you only need to make one at Morimoto: Omakase? Yes, please. It's why you came here in the first place.

I would give 5 stars for the pristine futuristic interior, it feels very posh and swanky! Chef Morimoto took a very untraditional interior design approach, this place feels more like a high-end nightclub than a Japanese restaurant but I guess it's appropriate considering its location....very Meat Packing District vibe, this place is meant to be a scene restaurant for glitzy glamourous people. Ok, now, the food. I was so utterly disappointed with my "Kobe Beef Lunchbox"! ?I felt deceived when my order arrived, I was like, "where's my kobe beef??" If anyone had seen it, I doubt he'll think it's "Kobe Beef lunchbox", because the beef itself was served almost like a side dish hiding in the shadow of tempura and sushi taking majority of the bento box space(check out the picture I uploaded)! ?Isnt' Kobe Beef supposed to be the main thing?? Otherwise it should simply be called "combination lunchbox"! Sushi and tempura were fabulous, 5 stars. However, Kobe Beef dish was incredibly mediocre that I was not only disappointed, but I felt ANGRY! They completely distroyed the quality and the flavor of Kobe Beef by cooking in overwhelmingly strong flavor soy-sauce based sauce that they might as well use any type of beef! Worse yet, they sliced it so thinly that I couldn't even tell if it's authentic Kobe beef or not. It was so pointless to use Kobe Beef for such mediocre flavor dish, what a waste!! It should have been served as beef tataki to preserve its quality. I hope you are reading this, Mr Morimoto!!!! If you are the "Iron Chef", how could you possibly serve such an uninspired and unremarkable Kobe beef?? This is so unacceptable! I would've overlooked it if it was cheaper and was made by someone unknown, or maybe he underestimated the gastronomic intelligence of fancy anorexic Meat Packing District people, he probably thought he could get away with it....NOT!! ? Anyways, the moral of the story: Don't believe the hype. Treat Kobe beef with respect.

Morimoto does not cater to vegetarians. They'll make you something if you ask, but really...who doesn't have at least one vegetarian dish at an upscale restaurant. The ambiance is nice, but slightly overrated. The desert, "tofu hot and cold" was much more notable than the meal. Be prepared to spend a lot of money at this restaurant.

I heart you Mr. Morimoto. (If by any chance you are reading this review on yelp, please open a Morimoto Resteraunt in San Francisco.) How do New Yorkers stay so skinny when resteraunts like this exist in their city? I have to say, as a visitor of NY... I fell in love with the dining experience of NY with this resteraunt. I'm Japanese, so I'm suppose to be critical of authentic Japanese resteraunts but even as a native (Japanese that is...) I loved the food here! For appetizers, go for the toro tartar. It's a very fusion dish but comes with REAL wasabi (not the pasty kind), seaweed paste and 4 other condiments. It's definitely not the most authentic Japanese dish, but definitely an unique one. The waiter recommended Hamachi seared Bibimba was absolutely mouth watering. The hamachi is seared in front of you with the hot clay pot! The only down fall of the menu was that the individual nigiri sushi only came with 1 piece! A traditional nigiri comes with two! Don't order the nigiri since it's a total rip-off but even with that aside, this place deserves 5 stars :)

I'm a big fan of the Iron Chefs so I wanted to pay homage. Morimoto is, in many ways, your quintessential New York City hotspot restaurant: gorgeous and dramatic restaurant design, exotic and fusion-influenced menu, and a celebrity chef-owner to boot. ? ?Morimoto is also your typical NYC hotspot in that upon arrival at check-in, your 9:30pm reservation is now running 45-minutes behind. ?But no worries folks, you and your friends can tiptoe down the centerpiece staircase (in stilettos) to hang out at the bar area, or walk a little further to the restroom for a bit of fun. ?Not that kind, you dirty old man. ?You can take pictures, pose, do whatever your heart desires in front of the gawk-worthy MOMA-esque bathrooms before your equally gawk-worthy ?host (or hostess) beckons your group for dinner. ?You are led to your table, back up the stairway, around an island of seats, to your separate sitting area---but this isn't much work; the people-watching alone makes up for the exercise. ?The Delacroix comparison has been typically reserved for Hiroyuki Sakai, but the dishes are also a visual panoply. ?But since you are paying a pretty penny for dinner, it would be a good thing to eat it. ?For such a hyped-up restaurant, the food is equally as impressive. ?The sushi, entrees, black cod, their desserts, oh my. ?Can we say, chitty chitty bang bang, what's that secret recipe? I wouldn't place Morimoto on the same field as Sushi Yasuda based on the quality of the sushi, but it is a lot of fun to go for a birthday dinner or with a group of friends.

service was superb. interior was beautiful and very modern. Omakase style = more like an extended appetizer with a main course and dessert. Omakase does not have ANY main courses and just strickly sashimi with very little rice. Japanese food is suppose to be simple. I was extremely disappointed. this restaurant caters to the "western" crowd; not traditional Japanese. I was more excited about the Shake Shack than this place. I think i'll stick with Sasabune and Sushi Wasabi in LA/OC.

For years I have watched this man turn food out on The Japanese Iron Chef (back when he was much younger and short hair) to the American version of this show( cheesy and not as adventurous as the original). ?I have drooled many nights over my television screen, hoping, praying even, that ONE DAY...I would get to taste one of his amazing creations. AND I DID!!!! I will try and be brief with my personal experience(not likely). ?First of all, if you plan on coming to Morimoto's, please just go all out and get the Omakase (tasting menu) and DO upgrade to the Japanese Kobe beef. You will regret it if you skip these two critical suggestions. TRUST ME!!! One step inside and you feel like you have entered a modern representation of what heaven may look like in the year 5,000 (assuming global warming hasn't torched planet Earth to a crisp by then). ?Architecturally, the clean lines, sparkling prisms, and exaggerated white ceiling seem to resemble floating in the clouds of a different planet. ?You feel all eyes on you for a moment but then you slip away into your own world where you become the spectator. ? Our server was EXCELLENT, very patient in explaining everything, and she was always smiling. ?As we begin to indulge in this foodgasmic experience...every single taste bud on my tongue was giving me a standing ovation for finally treating them to something so good...so real. ?First course, toro tartar( presented with a special scooping tool). I begin to fall into a food coma. ?I was losing my conscience state....things begin to blur. Our server came to check on us as if she were a nurse checking on our vitals. ?More courses, my mouth and body were at the very peak of a food high. ?Lobster and Kobe. ?I could hear her voice come in and out of conscienceness. ?The server that is. ?And then came the dessert. ?I know for a fact that I didn't have room for this, but I used mind-over-matter to help me put away that delicate sweet piece of splendor. SIGHHHHH. ?Why do I live in Texas? I started to question all things existential. All of the senses come to play here. ?You want to make this meal your last meal if you were given the opportunity. ? And on another note...I thought the sushi was phenomenal despite what others are claiming. One more notable suggestion...LADIES...Enjoy your time in the restroom....I certainly did! One- Word: ?FOODGASMIC!!!

I've been here probably 10+ times now everytime I have out of town visitors, we go here! ?Morimoto never disappoints and the ambiance and service is world class. ?Morimoto himself is there to drop by our table and take pics. Cocktails are good but weak, I like my drinks strong if you know what I mean. ?My favorite item is the Toro Tartare and Rock Shrimp. I love his restaurant decor, food, and service. ?Especially the toliet!

Must try: Iron Chef Chicken Noodle Soup I can seriously have that everyday! It is absolutely amazing. A group of 6 ordered various appetizers and was absolutely stunned by the 'plating' of the food. They all show up as work of art. The main entree of surf and turf, however, was not nearly as perfect as the appetizers.

Very enjoyable dining experience...Great for a date Gorgeously designed interior! The waitstaff and hostesses were extremely nice... We sat at the sushi bar which was fun...I wasn't thrilled that I had to take my shoes off to eat there but whatever... Beautifully presented dishes...Creative and elegant We drank lots of sake and ordered lots of food... Here's what we had (starred items are must orders): 1) Zen Sai, 5 different Japanese anitpasti (you can see in my pics) 2) *Kobe beef carpaccio (must order if you like beef) 3) Crispy Rock Shrimp in different sauces, spicy 'kochujan' sauce and wasabi aioli (they were good but I've had better at Buddakan) 4) Udon, 3 chilled noodles, fresh grated ginger, sesame, shiso (tasty but not really a must order, really it's just a filler) 5) Morimoto Sashimi, seared toro, salmon, eel, tuna, hamachi, five sauces (Very creative, the 5 testubes of different sauces was a bit much though) 6) random sashimi and rolls- *Oh-Toro (so amazing!), *Sake (the salmon was just like butter), Hamachi (Yellowtail), Hirame (Fluke was actually a bit tough), *Eel Avocado Roll (Yum) 7) *Some Apple Dessert (not sure of the name, but it's brand new on the menu) was good, it sported some cotton candy on top which was fun But one of the best features was the restrooms...really! ?They are amazing (or maybe I was just really drunk at this point) But you walk into the stall and there is a mirror mirage on the wall so it looks like your sitting in a peaceful serene forest. ?The toilets are technologically advanced..hot seats, shooting water, driers...very nice

i had dinner at morimoto on tuesday night with the boyfriend. ?i've been to the one in philly several times(i used to work there) so naturally i wanted to check out the new york location. ? we got great seats at the sushi bar and started off with the kobe beef carpaccio. ?i was tempted to push the boyfriend off his seat so i could eat the whole thing myself. ?i kid. ?the beef practically melts in your mouth, so can you really blame me? next came the toro tartare. ?pretty presentation, but it was a bit of a pain in the ass to eat. ?still tasted very good. foie gras chawan mushi (duck breast shabu-shabu, fresh wasabi, sweet soy sauce) came out just as we finished our toro tartare. ?the boyfriend's not too crazy about foie gras, so i got to eat most of it myself. ?the contrast in texture of the duck breast and foie gras made it that much more enjoyable to eat. ?it's cruel irony, but still very good. the sea bass was cooked perfectly with just the right amount of seasoning. ?i hate when restaurants cover fish with sauce. ?that tells me the fish isn't fresh and/or the chef doesn't know how to use natural flavors to complement each other. ? our last course was sushi. ?i wanted to cry when i tasted the oh-toro. ?so fresh, so buttery, fantastic. ?then i got excited when i had the ikura - i love how the eggs burst in my mouth, releasing a light briny taste. ?and of course, it was very fresh. i was planning on ordering dessert, but i didn't have any more room so i had another sake martini instead. ?there's always room for another drink. ?heh. ?i love that they're garnished with cucumbers because they absorb the alcohol and it's like a fun little prize you find after the drink is finished. morimoto is expensive, but it's worth every single penny and i will definitely be back.

Iron Chef Japanese, Morimoto-san. ?I won't lie I loved that fucking show. ?The fact that he is there cooking basically makes the place feel like some odd show at Disney World. The food was disappointing, I'm a Japanese food addict. ?The sushi was sub par, and the appetizers weren't all that great. ?Everything looked "pretty" but who cares if it tastes bland. Oh also, Morimoto uses a lot of self tanner. ?He looks ridiculous.

OK OK OK. ?I have to admit it. ?When my brother was visiting me back in October, I swore to him I was not going to eat at Morimoto when we saw it coming out of the Chelsea Market. ?And I stuck to that, as I am a man of my word. So now that he is here for Christmas, and thanks to the snow blizzard we just got a few days ago that cancelled his flight, we decided to venture to Morimoto to finally fulfill what we have both been yearning to do...consume some Iron Chef goodness into our bellies. Now...despite almost below zero degrees Farenheit weather, we hopped into a cab by my apartment in Midtown, and were quickly transported to Chelsea, land of the uber trendy. Upon arrival, we were gleefully greeted by the hostess, and because my brother wanted to stop at a chocolate store in the Chelsea Market, we opted to make a reservation to also walk around the market itself. When we returned (about 30 minutes prior to our reservation), they were able to seat us right away...so lots of kudos for the greeting and flexibility (but then again, who comes out like us crazies to eat after a blizzard right? ?Thankfully, I got a lot of training during my 12 years or so living in Chicago!). Ok...onto the Morimoto experience. ?Upon seating, the waiter was quick to come and introduce himself and get our drink orders. ?Very attentive and friendly. ?I was actually thinking they were going to be pushy as some waiters in stuffy places are, but this waiter was patient and took his time to answer our questions. Firstly, we had our drinks. ?I had the hydrangea lychee tini. ?It was spectacular. ?My brother got the Orange Blossom, and his exact comments were "a bit strong in the beginning, but the orange did blossom halfway!". Onto the appetizers. ?We chose three. ?Yes, we were hungry from all that walking and galavanting in snow. ?To start...hamachi tartare. ?Presentation, amazing. ?Cleverly grounded instead of the traditionally chopped tartare. Served in a tray with little mini paddles to scoop up, and complemented with six different condiments, along with soy sauce. ?And of course, caviar. ?Next, we had the oyster foie gras. ?I mean, what could be more heavenly than to marry two of my most favorite things on earth, right? ?And to top it with uni and teriyaki sauce, clever. ?Now, the oyster was very fresh and the foie gras was great. ?I could have done with a little less teriyaki, which seemed to overpower the oyster and foie gras. ?And finally, lobster fritters. ?We figured, lobster? ?Fritter? ?Done. ?This dish however was sent in late as they took longer to prepare. ?Honestly, my least favorite. ?Yes there was lobster. ?Yes, it was ok. ?But just ok for Morimoto won't cut it. Ok...main course time. ?I got the so called "duck duck duck". ?Very crispy duck, with a serving of leg, cutlets on top of a croissant, complimented with three sauces. ?It was very good. ?Now, although I do like my duck crispy, it was a bit dry. ?My brother ordered the surf and turf, which came with Wagyu beef (medium, but looked more like medium rare) with a hamachi ribbon salad. ?The beef was amazingly tender (but how could it not be for kobe beef) and very tasty. ? By that time, I was stuffed. ?Now you wonder, why three stars? ?Well, although the dishes were good, they were not spectacular. ?I felt they were a bit overly done, and I primarily focus on the taste of the dishes. ? Again, I am not a sucker for ambiance most of the time. ?But if that were the case, I would have given them a five star rating. ?Very clean and modern. ?Perfect lighting for a private dinner either for a date or with friends and family. Would I go back? ?Absolutely. ?there are many other dishes I want to try. ?Maybe next time I would be more inclined to give them a higher rating! ?Let's see what else is in store la prochaine fois!

OH MY GOD. I am a sushi nut and have been back to this place twice now. Where does one begin? First of all, Chef Morimoto is actually there, in the kitchen. Imagine that. A celebrity chef who actually spends time in his restaurant. I saw him myself, so it's actually true. Secondly, the sushi is so fresh, it's like they caught it minutes before serving it to you. The mozarella sashimi appetizer sounds weird, but try it -- you won't regre it. It's the oddest combo since Demi Moore and Ashton Kutcher, yet totally works. The duck duck duck -- amazing. So succulent. So juicy. I am drooling as I type this. The service is spectacular. I can't eat tuna, due to its high mercury levels, and told my server to leave that off my omakase. He brought me tuna by accident. Instead of merely apologizing, he then brought out an entire platter of their finest sashimi -- on the house -- by way of making nice for his mistake. Mario Batali could learn from Morimoto. His tacky, skanky, nasty Del Posto is right across the street, and has the same price points as Morimoto. But where Batali (or whoever the hell works in his kitchens these days) serves you overcooked, tired pasta and tasteless halibut, Morimoto seems to still take pride in giving his packed house the best fish this side of Sasabune.

Black cod a little overcooked. But did we leave hungry, yes. ?No doubt the food is fabulously presented, and quite precious. My own fault, I should have had the yellow tail they prepare over rice at the table- my friend had it and it was delicious and satisfying.

One of the best dining experiences EVER!!! ?I ordered the Omakase (chef's choice) and I would strongly recommend it. ?My wife ordered stuff a la carte, she ordered several appetizers and a few main dishes. ?We were stuffed after the meal, we were going to pass on dessert but as part of the Omakase, the waiter brought something out and we tasted it and ended up finishing it. ?Had a nice bottle of sake to wash everything down. ?

My last meal in NYC so I wanted it to be memorable and Morimoto's was able to deliver on all my expectations. First of all, I must disclose that I'm a fan of Iron Chef America, and I couldn't wait to eat at the restaurant that bore the chef's name. Like his style of food presentation, the space was simple, elegant, and absolutely beautiful, which is in stark contrast to the unassuming neighborhood. Maybe it was because I'd come here for lunch, but the place was pretty empty. Their lunch menu offers a choice of 3 pre-fixe options for $25: the Morimoto's Sushi Selection, a braised black cod, and the angry chicken. Since this was primarily a sushi restaurant, that's what I got. The meal started off with a house salad (the usual baby greens topped with what looked like some sort of cereal and a little bit too much kabosu vinaigrette) and a bowl of miso soup. Almost immediately after I'd finished my salad, the sushi chef (he looked like he was no older than 25) in front of me presented me with my plate of sushi: 6 pieces of nigiri (i think it was tuna, salmon, silver whiting, red snapper, unagi, and shrimp) and either 6 or 8 pieces of a spicy tuna roll. I also added oh-toro (fatty tuna) which they only give you 1 piece at the market price of $12. All the fish was fresh and melt in your mouth delicious. The unagi (eel) which I've never been that big a fan of, was quite possibly the best I've ever had. And the wasabi was fresh! (I'd expect nothing less). The only gripes I had were with the rice on the nigiri, which kept falling apart, and there was a tiny bit too much wasabi already between the rice and fish, causing the wasabi to get dangerously close to overpowering the taste on some of them. For dessert (which isn't included in the pre-fixe), I decided to buck the familiar for something a little more adventurous and I went with the Tofu Hot & Cold, a selection of tofu cheesecake with maple dipping/pouring syrup, a soy milk souffle, and finally, maple syrup ice cream. The cheesecake was unbelievably soft and fluffy, and I wouldn't have even known it was made of tofu is nobody had told me. The souffle was in contrast warm, and not bad, but a little egg-y. The ice cream was a nice way to end the meal. All in all, I liked this place a lot, and I wish I could check it out during dinner time. Definitely toss it on your list of must-eat at places in NYC.

You enter through a pod-like ethereal entrance. ?The round glass bottle walls and translucent bartops, furniture, cream chairs all give you a futuristic vibe. ? The menu may be intimidating for anyone who isn't familiar with Japanese cuisine or Iron Chef, (though it reads as food porn for NYC foodies otherwise). ? The whitefish carpaccio was a suggestion by the server that I had not planned on trying, but was really excellent. ?The rock shrimp tempura is probably the most tourist-friendly of the apps. ?Crispy, with lots of sauces. ? Sushi was fresh, and paired with unexpected herbs and garnishes. ?I was even convinced to try pufferfish. ?I'm still alive, which speaks for the skill of the chef. ? The duck, duck, duck entree is VERY rich. ?Think duck fat, duck egg yolk, and foie gras croissant. ?Great, but watch the blood pressure... ?Lighter, would be the Seafood Toban Yaki. ?Kind of like a big, hot pot of seafood stew. If you like a lot of seafood, this is the one for you, but myself, I like it raw. ? Service was very knowledgeable and attentive.

Morimoto. Mr. Iron Chef Japan. Expectations, expectations, expectations. Sometimes, I'm not sure whether to expect the worst then get the best out of it or expect what should be expected and hope to get blown away by the great experience. Morimoto NYC was one of the restaurants I've longed for while I was planning my trip to New York from L.A, (one above Caracas). Sushi, ramen, udon, takoyaki, chawan mushi, okonomiyaki, ryokan washoku, I've had it all. Ok maybe not all, but with these experiences under my belt, I still don't know any better. After I've arrived in front of the restaurant, I was absolutely thrilled. ?I couldn't wait any longer to get in, to dine and to experience what Iron Chef Japan was all about. My date and I were dressed in business casual attire for this occasion this Sunday evening. With $$$$ on yelp and a Morimoto label on it, we anticipated this restaurant to provide a high end dining experience. The restaurant itself was modern and well decorated. It certainly didn't feel like a traditional Japanese restaurant. There are two floors, top floor for dining and bottom floor, a bar. The waiters were all dressed in black. The overall environment felt like a scene. It wasn't as classy or as high end as we've anticipated. Some people were in shorts and t-shirts, some were well dressed. ?It was a mixed crowd. At this point, I was somewhat skeptical. I asked myself whether this restaurant is all about the food, or all about the experience. In the end, we are in America, as opposed to Japan. We ordered Maine lobster, Wagyu Beef Carpaccio, duck duck duck and a few from sushi bar. From the sushi bar, we ordered raw octopus, uni, ika and another piece I can't quite remember at the moment. Uni was for myself, the rest were for my date. "No wasabi for her, please." The first dish that arrived was the Wagyu beef. It looked magnificent. It was generously garnished. Dressed with soy sauce, chives, clinatro and a few more herbs. The beef quality was heaven. It was tender. It was slightly cooked with hot oil. It was fantastic, fresh, clean, but it was also over flavored. With good beef, simple is best. ?Keep in mind that wagyu is somewhat of a delicacy. Whether, the wagyu is lean or well marbled, you want to experience it at its best (Don't get me started with Wagyu marbled beef burger, that's a shame for some restaurants to carry). It was not to die for. Then came our lobster. It was a disappointment. From Raw Bar, I expected to be raw. Lobster sashimi. A total delicacy. But not this time, it was a well steamed whole lobster, served on an artsy bowl filled with ice to keep it plumped. It was also funny when the lobster arrived. I can clearly remember what Tony (Anthony Bourdain) said in his book, Kitchen Confidential) about seafood on a Sunday. But I fear not, after all, we are dining in Morimoto. Japanese cuisine on a pedestal. In NYC. The lobster itself was al dente. Still somewhat plump. It was easy and convenient to eat, pre-cracked. It was ergonomic in many ways. The meat can be retrieved out of the shell easily. The meat was not overcooked. It felt just right. The lobster came with a number of sauces. Minced garlic with chives, cocktail tomato sauce, ponzu and another one that wasn't worthy to remember. The body, the claw, the tail and the brain were nicely done. It was great, but again, it wasn't to die for. But I'd have it again, maybe. Then came the duck duck duck and the nigiri sushi. We were told that the sushi came in two per order, but that was not the case. One piece per order it is. We also ordered our nigiri wasabi free, but it was embedded with wasabi. I had the over price uni and it was not the best I've ever had. $8 for that one piece. It was somewhat fresh, it was not to die for. Again, it was overprice for that quality. We complained to the waiter and he offered a redo of the order but we declined after seeing what was served. Additionally, the restaurant comped us a dessert with the mistake it had done with the order of our nigiris. Then there was the duck duck duck. It was fatty, it was nicely done, it was delicious. The duck egg was rich, big and beautiful. The croissant was crispy and buttery, though I didn't taste too much of foie gras in it. The duck was succulent, tender and its skin was crispy. It was served with plum sauce. It was a decent dish, it was not bad at all. Though, I wouldn't go to morimoto just to have that dish because I know for a fact that the Chinese can serve the duck much better. The washroom earned the restaurant an extra star. I've never experience the traditional Japanese butt washing, auto-lid, ass warming toilet in the U.S. The toilet was clean, ?beautiful and hi-tech. I was mesmerized by the continuum of flowers in the mirror. All in all, the food was meh, I've experienced better. This place is decent for groups, Americanized. Not traditional Japanese. Over-hyped.

My husband and I had a lovely dinner at Morimoto New York. We both had the Morimoto Omakase. The restaurant should have gotten 5 stars. Gorgeous decor, great service, wonderful flavors, artful plate presentations...but did not achieve a 5-star rating because of the following: 1. The sushi was absolutely non-descript, tasteless, and boring. This is not what I expect from a restaurant of an Iron Chef. It's a little scary when the most enjoyable part of the sushi is the pickled ginger. :( 2. We were still hungry after the dinner. All though we were served about 10 courses, each were miniscule. My husband and I are not obese, but we're also not size 0's. We certainly did not expect to have to eat sandwiches and Mac 'n Cheese, after dinner, to be full. :( This is a lovely place to have a dinner. Just don't be surprised if you have to still eat a 2nd dinner after leaving the restaurant. As others have said, don't bother with the sushi. :( If you're there for dinner, ask for Juan. He was an awesome waiter. These may sound like minor points, but for the price of 2 Morimoto Omakase's, one does expect excellence.

Overall, the New York branch of the Morimoto empire is good and there are definitely reasons to go, but it does not reach the levels that the very best sushi and Japanese restaurants in NYC achieve. I first went to the original Morimoto in Philly right after it opened. ?I was served at the bar by Mr. Morimoto himself. ?The food was beyond good. ?I was served things that I'd never seen before. ?The fish was over the top good and went way, way, beyond the selection you typically come across in Japanese restaurants in the US. ?I have continued to go to Morimoto in Philly and still walk away thinking that 'this is among the best sushi in the United States" Here in NYC, the restaurant is beautiful and the service is impeccable. ?The food is good, to be sure. ?But each of the dozen or so times I have dined here, including last night, I have walked away thinking that 'there are many, many places in NYC I could have had that and it's not close to the top echelon.' ?In other words, the sushi itself, is just a little bit better than average in term of variety, creativity and presentation. ?(The freshness can't be beat, however.) At the same time, the non-sushi menu items at Morimoto are mostly excellent. ?All of the hot and cold appetizers are really good, particularly the toro's and the lamb carpaccio. ?On the dinner menu, the ishi yaki buri bop, Mr. Morimoto's take on similar Korean dishes that he invented while on the original Iron Chef program in Japan, is my favorite. ?The technique is inventive, the favors match perfectly and the hot stone technique is always good entertainment. As others have said, the Omakase is an excellent choice. ?It's a lot of food, though. ?I don't recommend going there unless you have a heck of an appetite.

We came here for dinner a couple of weeks ago. Sort of hard to find. We went into the Chelsea market looking for it but it's actually behind two red curtains. We weren't able to get table reservations last minute but ended up sitting at the sushi bar which was pretty neat to watch everyone work. The atmosphere overall is very trendy and lounge like. Music was louder downstairs, upstairs was more like a restaurant. They didn't have any speciality rolls, only the very basic rolls (tuna, california, salmon). We had the spicy tuna roll and it wasn't anything spectacular but good enough. I had the surf and turf and my boyfriend had the angry chicken. My surf and turf was wagyu beef and tuna with avocado. One of the chefs came to the table and prepared my tuna and avocado which turned out to be sort of like tuna and guacamole. It was really good, like nothing I have tried before. The steak was a little tougher than other cuts of wagyu beef I had before but still good in flavor. I tasted my boyfriend's chicken and it was definately "angry", spicy, very good. Definately don't miss checking out the restroom before leaving.:-)

Got to the restaurant early and went to the downstairs bar to have a drink. The bar was quiet but the bartender was friendly and helped us order some specialty drinks. ?While waiting to be seated upstairs we ordered oysters from the raw bar. ?I was disappointed with the oysters due to the fact they were dressed three different ways; while I expected to get plain raw oysters with the usual condiments. ?We were later seated upstairs and sat near the sushi bar. ?The staff was friendly and the service was on point. ?We started off with four appetizers: Tuna tartare- best I've ever had. 5/5 Tuna pizza- unique and delicious. 4.5/5 Tempura shrimp (served two ways)- they were drowned in sauces I wouldn't recommend it. 2.5/5 Pork gyoza - good not great. I wouldn't recommend it. 3/5 Next came the entree. Me and my gf split it. Seafood "toban yaki"--- One of the best entrees I've ever had. Served with all types of shellfish in a delicious broth with Chinese broccoli and Chinese mushrooms. 5/5. At this point I couldn't move but we had to get some dessert. ?I got the chocolate cake. The cake was good but the sorbet with pear that was served along side of it was by far the best part. I would request the sorbet by itself next time. Only major complaints were the oysters from the raw bar menu and the tempura shrimp.

Morimoto is my favorite Iron Chef so I had to try his restaurant when I was in NYC. ?We opted for the tasting menu / omekase and were not let down. ?Each dish was delicious and beautifully presented as you would expect from Morimoto. ?I'm not much of a fruity cocktail person but need to highlight that the lychee cosmopolitan was quite tasty :)

3.5 stars. Psssss...I'll let you into a little secret. If you want top-notch service without paying obscene amount of money at Morimoto, come for a weekday lunch. Planning to have a stayvacation, my mom took this week off, hoping to recharge her battery, yet last week's tornado swept us off our feet...quite literally. Our background is destroyed, we lost electricity for well over 48+ hours (I had to buy bags of ice to save my frozen goods), the devastation of road travelling (waiting for the bus for an hour, and I eventually felt ill after all these stressful events. The start of the week made me even more apprehensive. ?So, I did what any irresponsible worker would do...I skipped work to have lunch with mom. Actually, we both needed a break and deserved some pampering, so what's better than a Japanese restaurant, where hospitality is of utmost importance? Being a Monday lunchtime, the dining area was mostly empty, with a few filled up tables. ?The most affordable lunch option is to order the bento. ?From the look of the presentation, it didn't seem like a lot of food (no bowl of rice with your entree), but the freshness of the sushi and sashimi does satisfy your protein needs. ?My mom tasted the wagyu beef. ?It was very savory and made her want to down a bowl of rice to sop up the extra sauce. ?The tofu, miso soup was authentic and definitely not the fake package flavor. ?However, the salad dressing was too acidic and if you don't like blue cheese, be sure to inform your waitstaff because the tempura was rested on a pool of cheesy bechamel sauce (that was not described on the menu). ?I ordered a la carte. I loved their green salad. ?Extremely fresh and it even included mizuna and other Japanese greens. ?I asked for added avocado and the waitress complied...with no extra charge! Even though I didn't order the bento set, I still received a panna cotta lychee dessert in a shot glass. ?Nice touch. ? I understand that it's a seafood restaurant, so begin a vegetarian, there was not a lot of options for me (I was hoping to see fresh tofu appetizer, more salad varieties or zaru soba of sort. ?Not all vegetarians rely on tempura and miso soup you know.) With that said, we savored the serenity that was much needed. ?If you're a pescetarian, I would definitely recommend you coming here as my mom said the tuna literally melted in her mouth and she's rarely this descriptive with her words.

Damn. This place has the best sushi I've ever had. That's what I had. Uni, uni, and then some more. Others got the omakase, kobe steak, and this seafood hot pot. It was all delicious. To top it all off, we met Morimoto san himself. He was walking around and we got to take a pic with him! It was awesome. The bathroom is also very impressive-when you open the door, the seat cover lifts up . If you are in New York, you've gotta go, but be aware you will dropping a dime and a half.

I am a huge fan of Moriomoto and have been watching him on the original Iron Chef for as long as I could remember. When my boyfriend took me to New York for a mini vacation, we had to go to his restaurant! The food was amazing. We ordered the Omakase and it was the best 7 course meal I have ever had and we also had one of the nicest servers I have ever encountered. ?It is a bit pricey but its so worth it!

Morimoto is one of those places that maintains a working balance between tradition Japanese and fusion fare. ?For traditionalists, the sashimi is the freshest I've had in a long time- cut to ideal sizes/slices according to the type of fish it is to maximize on taste, and served at the perfect cold temperature. For fusion people, there are things like the tartar, the oysters and fois gras, and many items on their cooked list. The calamari salad is heavenly as well. ?Unfortunately, almost every time I go there, I end up leaving no room for dessert. There is the price tag. What one pays for is a happy, memorable dining experience with no glitches in service, great presentation, excellent food, and unhurried eating (dine later, after 9 for a true feel of the place). ?The decor is trendy and modern, but not in an intimidating or cold way. ?However, the acoustics are not great here; on a busy night, you may have to speak louder to carry a conversation over the noise of others. It's meant to be a lively place, and I don't see it as too romantic a setting although the dim lighting is perfect for that. More sexy than romantic, lol.

The place is impressive and beautiful in white. ?I read some of the yelp reviews before we went and agree with many of the recommendations even though we decided the omakase option would not work for us. ?The white lilly cocktail especially when it is very cold (our second glass) is soooo yummy. ?We ordered sushi and appetizers rather than the entrees and were full on five dishes--morimoto sashimi, lobster fritters, spicy crab legs, wasabi noodles, and the shrimp tempura roll. ?The presentation of the dishes were gorgeous. ?The portions were small. ?The taste was overall fine; the spicy crab legs were the best. ?The service was impeccable and everyone was friendly and genuine. ?The bathroom was out of this world...

I loved it the first time I came here, and absolutely hated it the second time. ?The inside is definitely dramatic, and the atmosphere can be quite lively on a Thursday/Friday/Saturday night. ?The portions are small (as expected). ?The first time, we had the rock shrimp tempura which was delicious, crispy, and perfectly seasoned. ?We also had the ahi tuna pizza (not great), but the sushi was very fresh and delicious. ?The second time we went, we had the rock shrimp tempura and it was awful - they overfried the shrimp. ?Our sushi was terrible as well. ?It was surprising because Morimoto was in the restaurant that night, so I expected the quality to be better. ?When we complained to our server, they apologized and brought out a skimpy dessert to make it up to us. ?It was ridiculous. ?I am not sure that I would ever go back given the number of other great japanese restaurants in the city.

I was extremely disappointed after my experience here. I did my research and read all of the great reviews about this restaurant. Also, I've been watching Iron Chef for years and told myself that one day I would try Morimoto's food. When I finally got a chance to go to New York, I made my reservations for Morimoto. I got all dressed up because I knew it was a fancy, expensive fine dining restaurant. My friend and I were a bit late for our reservation because our cab driver couldn't find it! But the hostess was really nice and had our table waiting for us. The restaurant is beautiful! Clean, white modern decor with a few colorful fluorescent looking lights. My friend and I ordered a few dishes, the tofu with lobster and mushrooms, tuna sashimi salad, Morimoto sashimi, spicy tuna roll and salmon roll. We also ordered 2 sake shots and 2 cocktails. The sake shots were $16 each!!! It was quite tasty but definitely not worth $16! The tuna sashimi salad was ok, the tuna was very fresh but the sauce was nothing special. My Morimoto sashimi plate was very pretty and had 5 layers of different fish. It came with 5 different sauces in syringe looking like things. I was very disappointed in this dish. At $28 I expected it to be mind very delicious. It was eh. It was pretty to look at but it wasn't very good and the sauces weren't good either. The rolls were decent but expensive. The only thing that I really enjoyed was the fresh tofu that they stir and make at your table. The mushroom, lobster sauce that comes with it was really delicious as well. I was disappointed with this experience, but I love Morimoto and I would actually go here again and try all different things and maybe I'll be able to change my bad review to a good review.

a couple of the hardest rolls to make IMO are the salmon skin and spider rolls. ?morimoto's got it hands down. wow, what flavor and taste. ?i would come here just for sushi that's how good the prices are! as for the main dishes, the portions are very big. much like the portions i would find at a regular restaurant that isnt fine dining. the tuna tartar was probably the smallest, but the octopus salad, rock shrimp tempura and main course were not only huge, but delicious. ?dishes can easily be split amongst other friends at the table. some people dressed very down for this place, but i think this place is a little lax on dress code. ?other than that.. food, ambiance, etc were outstanding. btw, do all the male waiters and a couple of waitresses have a minimum height requirement? looks like over 6ft was the minimum.

Yes it's expensive but to be honest what good sushi - japanese restaurant isn't. I think the pricing is comparable to back in SF. We took our daughter there for dinner and while the site says not good for kids - oddly enough there were 3 other tables with kids at 9pm. So don't feel bad. The food was amazing. The Rock Shrimp tempura was so amazing we ordered a second order - my 4 year old inhaled the chili version. The duck trio was good and tasty but the bun went limp to quickly. I think it needs to be toasted before serving. The rolls were just okay, although soft shell crab and all of Sashimi was very fast. They cocktails were delightful and the service was very friendly. VERY FRIENDLY..........the inside may scream tight collar but the staff was very attentive and nice. although, I did notice there were no male servers????? Also, the attire is dressy but don't feel bad if you are wearing shorts and it's 89 and muggy outside.

I really liked the design of the restaurant. I'm quite a fan of Philippe Starck's designs of which the naked concrete walls with clear chairs are reminiscent. The wall next to the staircase is covered with hundreds of glass pieces that look like bottles. The interplay of light falling on all these elements is amazing. As this was my first visit, I found the menu choices to be bewildering and decided to go with the Omakase tasting menu. I will order a la carte at my next visit. We started with toro tartare box with multiple sauces underneath. One scrapes the tartare from the box with a very interesting small metal utensil. A fish carpaccio with mushrooms followed. Then came a vegetable dish with a carrot and cauliflower which were to be dipped into a sauce presented in a heated cup. Excellent oyster with soy sauce, uni, and foie gras was next. Six selected pieces of sushi were then beautifully presented. The palate cleanser was a housemade ginger ale that was slightly "stronger" than expected, but I enjoyed the surprise. The surf and turf dish consisted of a delicious square piece of Kobe beef added to a crab leg. A poppy seed pastry was added to coffee creme dessert. A square cutout cookie placed on top was a beautiful touch. Overall, the dishes were beautifully designed and presented. This was a feast for all the senses.

I was very exciting to go and try Morimoto as I am a big fan of Japenese cuisine. We came a little bit early and I realized quickly that it was a good idea. The place filled up pretty fast and for a Sunday night, it got completely packed. The quiet and trendy louge became noisy, the waiting time so long that our waiter offered us Edamame with apologies, and the quality of the service decreased. But the food was really good. We shared the tartare apetizer (subtle, sophisticated), the sushis (excellent though nothing original there), the scallops apetizer (spicy and sour, really good), and the spicy crab apetizer (lots of meat and excellent) The other reason why I give only 4 stars is the white wall on our side covered with big black traces of sauce and fat... The waiter said he mentioned it to the management several times and that they had to repaint the part of the wall. The place is otherwise really nice (check out the bathroom :)!)

Omakase all the way. This place was off the proverbial hook. Although it officially weighs in as the most expensive meals my girlfriend an I have ever eaten, it was definitely one of the best and here's why: ?The place is beautiful. Clean, modern and spacious for a NYC restaurant. The staff was incredibly helpful and courteous. My girlfriend eats fish, but not land animal meat and they didn't flinch at all when we asked if the omakase menu for the evening could be presented that way for her. Here's the breakdown of what we ate: 1) Tuna tartare served with six different toppings including fresh wasabe (awesome) 2) Yellowtail sashimi w/ shitake mushroom servered in some sort of sesame oil concoction. Delicious. 3) Oyster w/ foie gras - This was the largest oyster I've ever seen. It was also an awesome explosion of flavor. (Her's came without the foie gras) 4) Seared something or other fish with delicious aioli and fried vegetable chips 5) Sushi Course 5 pieces of exceptionally awesome sushi. Was the best tuna I've ever had 6) Lobster course! Yes! I've always wanted a meal with a lobster course! 1/2 a Lobster baked with delicious indian tasting spcies. Very juicy. We felt a little bad sucking on lobster legs at such a fancy ?place, but if they wanted us to be neat about it, they would have taken the meat out for us. 7) Green Tea & Macaroon. Palate cleansing, macaroon a little too sweet for me. 8) Kobe beef w/ sweet potatoes - amazing. This dish reminded me of an awesome sweet pot roast, but instead of a big hunk of cheap tough meat, we were presented with thin succulent barely rare cuts of kobe beef. ?Awesome. They subbed in another fish for my girlfriend. 9) Some crazy sweet potato cake w/ red bean foam (which I am usually not into, but was awesome) and coconut sorbet. It was OK - by that time I was stuffed to the gills so it was a nice to have a light dessert. Other things of note: - Morimoto was there hanging out by the door overseeing the operation. Seemed very friendly and engaged in the operation of the restaurant. - Japanese bathroom technology is so far advanced when compared to normal US standards. - We each had a Morimotini (wasabi infused!) and a carafe of Junmai sake which was delicious. The second carafe was probably unnecessary, but it was a special occasion. In the immortal words of Ferris Bueller: "It is so choice. If you have the means, I highly recommend picking one up." If the tasting menu was $100 instead of $120 per person, I would have given this place five stars.

OK, I've been here a few times, the last time was for lunch--- which is really not that bad, the Fixe Prix menu is only $25 per person, and it comes with a sh*tload of sushi, plus miso and a salad. Not bad, the other times I came, I had the sampler at $80 per person, which was a dining experience. The first time I came, I was surprised to see Morimoto was actually there, he pops in and out of the dining room all the time, unlike many of the other restaurants owned by food network chefs, none of whom you see at their namesake establishments. The food is quite good, but there is indeed better sushi and noodles to be found in the city, but not with such a vibrant environment. I tried to pay the Maitre D' for the playlist in the bar, love their music selection! VISA/MC/AMEX

Omakase is da bomb! tuna tartare w/scraper thing was so much fun! I never knew I could eat so much seafood in one sitting and not barf.

The only thing I could have asked for was to see a glimpse of morimoto himself but I'm not that naive!

The raw seafood options are marvelous, so fresh and delicious. Great young and happening vibe in the restaurant, too. Highly recommended.

I suppose the main attraction here is the super cool ambiance. If you stick to sushi and avoid appetizers and drinks, it might be worth the high cost. Specifically, the salmon sushi and sashimi were the best I have ever had in my life. The sushi and sashimi were very good, and so were the artisan sorbets. Nothing else seemed to be worth the hefty price tag. The lobster fritter appetizer was entirely unimpressive, especially given the $12 price tag and the fact that there was best case scenario only an ounce of lobster in them. The alcohol was good, but nothing special and also very costly. Especially the "Morimoto" beer, which turned out to be made by the Rogue company (they make Rogue dead guy ale).

Come inside, take a look at the decor, and head to your favorite rib joint, or something. The food here is expensive and unbelievably overrtated. One thing is for sure: you're not paying them for the quality of the food, but the size of their electricity bill. All talk, no substance. It gets 2 stars purely on original decor, which is not why I go out to "eat."

This is definitely a good place for a date. And it's meat-packing and chic, so dress to impress. Stuff here is not filling and kind of expensive, but if you want to splurge, splurge it here. They have hands down the freshest, most creative dishes that not only taste surprisingly delicious, but refreshingly so as well. One of my favorite appetizers is the Tuna Pizza, sounds interesting but it is amazing. Firecracker Chicken is a good entree dish, and so is sea bass. The alcohol here is nothing spectacular. I'd pick this place over Nobu or Megu any day. Also for your curiosity: high-tech multifunctional Japanese toilets in all stalls. I was told Morimoto actually cooks in the kitchen.

It's with pleasure that I admit I'm addicted to Iron Chef America. Naturally, I had to try out what Masaharu Morimoto has to offer in New York. The moment I walked through the door, I fell in love with the space. The decor was beautiful, yet chic and hip. And the food... what can I say other than it was wonderful. I ordered a tofu dish which was prepared right by my table, and melted into my mouth. Sadly, I have to knock off a star because of the pricing, a little too expensive. Nonetheless, I will definetly be back whenever I happen to be in Chelsea/Meatpacking District!

clean & simple ambiance and decor. bathroom = i didn't go to it, but from what the BF says, the tush warmer is a-OK. now as for the food... appetizers: scallops & KING CRAB AIOLI (must get. which is why i capitalized) sushi combo: it was fresh, but i feel like i can get that anywhere. save your money and order something else...or go for the overpriced sashimi that you would normally not find elsewhere. yellowtail buri bop : i was imagining some type of bibimbap thing, which was cool, they mixed the rice and egg at the table...however, it wasn't as flavorful as i would have liked...a little bland...but the fish was FRESH! a good place for a special occasion, but i wasn't as impressed as i thought i would be. overall, still a good selection of food & fresh seafood...maybe i just ordered the wrong things.

As I walked into this place i was pretty impressed. ?Great experience from the service to the food. ?I will be back! We had the seafood combo appetizer. ?King Crab legs, oysters, uni, roe, ?Everything was fresh and tastie. ?I can easily say my top 5 Japanese joints in nyc. the chef sushi combo for our main course and man it was good. ?different type of salmon and a assortment of other tastie fishies. ?the flavors were amazing. on the side we had four types of sauces and again, yummy. ?I usually have my sashimi with wasabi but these sauces where so good i just had my sushi without the wasabi. The Chicken noodle ramen was overkill because I was pretty full but it was good, enough flavor and not too much. Service was great from the host to the waiter. ?Only thing i can say semi bad about the place is the drinks were pricey.

Went downstairs for some drinks and appetizers. The space is very sleek but interesting. What's even more interesting are the bathroom stalls. Take a camera and pose in front of the infinity mirrors in your stall. Next try out the heated toilets with the works. I am surprised that ?there is no massage function in there. Finally, skip the drinks and appetizers at this place. The signature drink Morimotini was bad! I tried several others and the half way decent one was called red-dragon or something. The appetizers were ok but not impressive considering they are coming from an Iron Chef.

I was in town for my birthday and my friend wanted to take me out for some Japanese to celebrate. ?She couldn't get reservations to Nobu, so she decided to take me to Morimoto. ?I really tried so hard to like it, I swear! ?(Especially because my friend was taking me out for my birthday, and I didn't want to be an unappreciative brat). ?But at the end, I was pretty let down. We had the Morimoto Sashimi, where it had the 5 types of fish and the 5 different sauces. ?I'm not sure when eating dinner became some sort of a lab experiment -- you choose one of the sauces to use (each stored in a eye-drop kind of contraption) and then you squeeze this contraption all over your fish and/or plate. ?Don't get me wrong, the fish was very fresh, but I would have been a lot happier with just plain ol' wasabi and soy sauce. ?For the entrees we ordered the black cod and the halibut, and also had another sushi roll. ?The food wasn't bad, but it wasn't much to rave about. ?I suppose I expected more from the restaurant considering the prices and celebrity chef factor. ?Perhaps because we didn't go for the omakase? ?Given all of the choices in NY, I won't be back again. ? I suppose the bathrooms were cool -- it made me feel like I was in Japan. ?I admit the toilet kind of scared me though -- I went into the stall, closed and locked the door, and turned around to find the toilet seat rising and moving on its own....spooky...

I've been here three times.. The tasting menu doesn't change too much.. each time I had it... the standard popular dishes. ?Treat yourself and come to this place at least once to try his unique dishes. ? I actually prefer to hang downstairs at the bar or one of the little booths and have a few drinks and order some rock shrimp and other classics. ?When you RSVP .. make sure you tell them you want to be in the main dining room...otherwise you'll have fun looking at walls all night. ?

I'm a huge fan of TV show, 'Iron Chef'. I was really exciting, but....maybe I expected too much. I went to this restaurant with a bunch of my friends. 9 people. Since we' were a big group, I could taste different menus. However, the dinner was totally wastful. Spending my time and a lot of money, for something so average or lower than average, is not good, at all. First of all, the interior design was cool, but not impressive. We sat at the table downstairs. I know that place is for drink, but the chairs are so uncomfortable. I felt like I'm about to fall at the chair. ? Service was just ok, but they totally forogot my drink. And I could get it when everyone almost finished their foods and drinks. Detail things, like utensils and food cordinations, I think they are trying to be fancy, but seriously not fancy at all. Their clear milky chopsticks are cute, but doesn't look expensive and they are too light. We ordered Morimoto beer, and they sereved it with their own bottle and wine glass. The bottle was cute, but I'm sure that they could've got some fancy and cute beer cup, instead of wine glass. It just looks like they're 'TRYING' to be fancy. The most important thing, food!!! Honestly, the foods were not bad, but not good. They are either so average, or 'Memorable' because it was extremely salty. ? Too much teriyaki flavor for oyster dish w/ uni and foie gras. I tryied to taste those lovely ingrdients, but they totally lost their flavor. The rests are not memorable. Only sashimi was good. My main dish was trout and it was too salty. Servers kept filling up my water glass, but I was so thirsty on my way back home. Even rolls that my friend ordered was salty too. About drinks. I didn't taste all of them, but nothing special about Morimoto beer which was 34 dollars per bottle. I love infused vodka, so I ordered Morimojito cocktail which I got at the end, was just like waterdown vodka. They said Wasabi infused vodka and some sake, but it's just like a cucumber shochu that I had in Ktown. We might've chosen wrong menus, but these kind of restaurant should not have bad menus. Totally overinflated reputation.

So I wasn't blown away by this place... if anything the highlight of the night was the dessert; the food was just okish. The decor/ambiance of the restaurant is pretty nice, I guess you can say it's typical of a meat packing district restaurant... it def has that "wow I'm in NYC" so if you want to impress your out of towners then this is the place. I do however must highlight the Tuna Pizza, it was tasty and different from what you would find on a Japanese restaurant menu. The sushi rolls were average and the Toro Tartare lacked flavor and it took us a while to figure out how it was supposed to be eaten. Don't get me wrong, I'm a huge fan of trying new things but this is just a hyped up dish with a nice colorful presentation. Nothing about the food was really memorable besides the Tuna pizza... dessert is a different story, we had the Apple bread pudding and the hot and cold tofu and they were amazing! really, I would've given this place two starts if it wasnt for dessert.

I've been to the original Morimoto in Philly many times... ?and highly anticipated Morimoto NYC... ?Although the NYC restaurant is beautifully designed, the cavernous space makes the dining experience seem less intimate. ?(Every time I went to Philly, Morimoto came to our table and took pictures with us. ?That's how intimate and personal the Philly experience was.) ?The food in Philly also seemed tastier... although Morimoto NYC delivers serious taste too. ?Do the omakase -- It's worth the money. ?Highly recommend the tuna tartare, kobe beef, and lobster!!

Had Morimoto's for lunch today and got their restaurant week prix fixe. ? It included miso soup, a small salad, 3 pieces of veggie tempura, 3 pieces of sushi, 3 pieces of a tuna roll, and a choice of beef, braised black cod, or vegetarian. ?I went with the cod. ?The cod was really tasty...the sauce was sweet and salty and the fish was cooked nicely. ?The sushi was okay. ?They didn't really give melt-in-your-mouth fish - they gave shrimp, salmon and tuna...the only fish I really liked was the tuna. ?Next time I go, I'll definitely order outside of the (bento) box. ?By the time I was done with my meal, I was too full to try anything else. ?I would definitely go back and try other dishes yelpers are yelping about.

went to morimoto this week with hubby and sister during restaurant week. ?setting is uber cool. ?the walls look like they're lined with sheers, but they're actually shaped and molded plaster. ? seating is mostly tables of 4 and the large dining room is partitioned off into smaller areas with clear plexiglass which offers a bit more privacy so that you're not listening to the conversation of the people at the next table. i don't think it's possible to get melt in you mouth sushi anywhere outside of tokyo, but morimoto did not disappoint. we had the prix fixe (sp?) lunch and prix fixe wine. ?the south african chenin blanc and sake were excellent. ?the sushi was top notch, although i would have loved to have a piece of TORO (fatty tuna).

I love Morimoto on TV, but in his restaurants, the food is only so-so. Went here with three friends, and while the food was solid, it definitely wasn't worth the price, or up to the hype. The same is true for their original location in Philly. The best thing I can say is that I like the decor.

You certainly won't have a bad meal here. However, let's be clear: you are paying through the nose for the Morimoto name and the ambiance. If you are an Asian fusion aficionado, add a star. If you are a sushi purist, there are just as (to me, better) sushi joints in town that won't leave your wallet feeling violated (see my reviews). It's a nice overall dining experience, impressive for the atmosphere, but wayyyyyy overpriced.

I went there earlier this month with my family. The waitress kept pushing us to do the omakase which we weren't interested in. We ordered the toro tartare, oyster foie gras, beef curry bread and a few rolls to start. For our entrees we ordered Sea Bass, Angry Chicken, Seafood 'Toban Yaki', Buri Bop (recommended by the waitress) and the ramen soup for my 7 year old nephew (also recommended by the waitress). The appetizers were ok. We read a lot of reviews saying that the toro tartare's a must but we didn't think it was that great and we're big sushi/sashimi lovers. It was interesting at best. They make the buri bop sound cool but it's nothing more than Korean dol sot bi bim bap. The ramen soup that chef morimoto supposedly eats all the time according to the waitress was extremely oily and bland. The toban yaki was probably the best thing we ordered. My angry chicken was bloody... When I called the waitress over she tried telling me it was fully cooked but did offer to let me change my order. I ordered the halibut and although the fish was cooked very well the dish itself was extremely oily and tasted strongly of sesame oil. No matter how well the fish was cooked i couldn't get over the strong sesame oil flavor that made me feel like i was drinking a bottle of sesame oil. Also, once I received my halibut the wait staff stopped coming to our table. They went to the table next to ours but not ours. We sat there for about 10 minutes after we were done and my brother-in-law raised his hand but the waitress looked at him and just walked away. It wasn't until he said aloud, "are you kidding me?!!" that she turned around and came back and asked if we needed anything. Needless to say I was extremely disappointed with my experience at Morimoto.

im always weary of highly publicized and overly hyped trendy restaurants. they usually are anti climactic and mediocre. not the case with morimoto. im a convert! i had the pleasure of dining here for lunch during restaurant week and had an amazing experience! first off: the space was fantastic! modern. white. clean lines. the textured ceiling, interesting. had an open feel but still intimate. cool modern looking chairs glass partitions between some tables. second: cocktails. phenominal! i didnt opt for the non-alcoholic choices. we all had the real deal. i had the white lily as recommended by our cute and flirty waiter. perfection! sweet, not too tart, just enough citrus tang. this drink is deadly. the food: oh emmm geeee goood!!!! we had the scallop bento boxes wc wasnt listed on the menu. it was a special for that day. the miso soup was heavenly. that home made tofu was just out of this world. miso soup is such a simple dish that its surprising how they could make it this incredible. the tempura was great and it had this really good cheesy sauce on the bottom. what was that!!!?? ?all i know is i can prob drink that sauce it was so good. the sushi was excellent. sooo fresh and sublime. i read the morimoto book in the lobby while i was waiting and he said we shouldnt dunk our sushi in wasabi and soy sauce as it destroys the perfection and balance of it. he was right. the sushi was amazing by itself!!! the scallop with bok choy in some garlic sauce thing was the highlight. it was soooo good i couldve eaten 20 of those! scallop was perfectly cooked. the bok choy complimented it and that sauce was awesome. for dessert was the rapberry pannacotta. sooo good. not too tart and not too sweet. just smooth velvety perfection in your mouth. the service was excellet. im sure it helped that our waiter was good looking and a huge flirt. but they were very attentive and did not rush us at all, wc is the case for most restaurants i feel like. it is super pricey but it definitely is worth the money for the experience and the privilage. it is iron chef morimoto afterall!!!!

The toro tartare is a knockout, the chirashi bowl an absolute pleasure from start to end, the spicy king crab leg appetizer delicious. Great service too. Am looking forward to a return trip

My wife and I were just in the West Village the other weekend for my brother-in-law's engagement party, and on our last night we treated them to dinner at Morimoto. ?GOOD CALL. ?I was prepared to drop some coin, and Morimoto was convenient because it was just a few blocks from their apartment. ? After reading reviews here, I knew it was going to be good, but I wasn't sure how good. ?Let's just say it exceeded my expectations. ?Being the out-of-towner and the one who chose the restaurant, I felt some pressure, and this was a home run. ?There were 4 of us, and our waitress, who while soft-spoken, was very friendly and efficient. ?She said I could order the Omikase even though I was the only one at the table ordering it. ?This made me happy, because while I was able to get the "Morimoto experience", I was also allowed to sample some of the other dishes that were ordered for the table. ?Ill try to go down the list of dishes the table ordered off the top of my head... Tuna Tartare, Tuna Pizza, Rock Shrimp Tempura, Spicy King Crab, Udon, Buribop, Chef's Choice Sushi Dinner and there may have been some sort of roll ordered. ?Obviously the Tuna Tartare is a hit, and it lived up to the hype. ?I've never seen Tuna Tartare so finely chopped, and it was more like a tuna paste. ?The condiments at the bottom were perfect to make different types of bites, and the presentation was top notch. ?Tuna Pizza was a hit at the table. ?The Anchovy aioli was so good. ?I thought the crust could have been just a little bit better, but overall it was a beautiful dish. ?The other dishes that really stood out to me were the Spicy King Crab and Buribop. ?Now onto where my focus was... Omikase: Tuna Tartare - ?See above. Vegetable Fondue w/ Anchovy Garlic Sauce - ?The least memorable dish of the night. ?I did think the sauce and presentation of it was nice, but this was just OK. ?Not bad, just OK. Harami Sashimi - ?A+ Several thinly sliced delectable pieces of fluke with a subtle yet totally delicious sauce drizzled over. ? Oyster, Uni, & Foie Gras w/ Teriyaki Sauce - ?Combining these three ingredients are the things dreams are made of. ?I was a little worried about some people saying the teriyaki was too over powering, but I must disagree. ?The sauce did not over power the other flavors to me, just added a delightful touch this orgasm of flavor combinations. ?One large bit of heaven. Nigiri Selection (Chu Toro, Red Snapper, White Snapper, Amber Jack, and Topneck Clam) - ?Each piece was so fresh and satisfying, I only wish I had 1 more of each piece. ?The quality of the fish was excellent. ?Not too much rice and a perfect size mouthful of fish. Surf & Turf (Wagyu Beef & Lobster) - ? My beef was cooked perfectly, ?lobster was good, and the lemon creme fraiche made it fantastic. Solid. Apple Turban - I had been chatting with out waitress a bit, and she told me about the dessert they were serving that night, and how it wasn't her favorite, and that if I like she would let me choose any of the other desserts. ?I took her advice and opted for the Apple Turban instead. ?It was very good and the glass of port I had to wash it down (which the waitress upgraded), made it the perfect close to an outstanding meal. We ordered 2 $50 bottles of wine, a few cocktails (Morimotini was great, even though I'm not the biggest Vodka guy), on top of all our food, and got out of there at like $650+/-, tip included. ?Truthfully i thought we had racked up a bigger bill. ?I had an idea of what we were going to pay, and I was prepared. ?While the menu is pricey, thats just the type of restaurant that this is, and I will say that the food really lived up to the hype. ?We all left every satisfied. ?i hope to come back one day.

Love, love, love this place. The food is amazing. I definitely recommend the omakase (translation "chef's choice") which encompasses all the best dishes and wine pairings. The tuna tartare and tuna pizza are not to be missed. Your bill may give you a heart attack, but I promise it's worth it.

I'm not really sure how anybody could give Morimoto less than 5 stars, because as a sushi/seafood/fusion restaurant, Chef Morimoto crafts cuisine that is totally transcendent. ?We got the 7 course Omakase, and the highlights consisted of a a toro appetizer with 6 different condiments to mix and match with, various sashimi and nigiri plates, multiple hot appetizers including "Duck Duck Duck" which is a duck breast croissant, duck drumstick, and duck egg with raspberry reduction and plum sauce for dipping, cajun seasoned lobster with lemon creme fraiche, and a wasabi-orange-buttercream cake with chocolate/coffee ice cream paired with a sparkling moscato. ?Absolutely wonderful... it's hard to imagine how you could go wrong here from a food perspective.

Put this on your bucket list - and scratch it off ASAP! Ambience: Nicely appointed with something of an ultra-modern starkness. Nice clear panels between pairs of tables really cuts down on noise but the seating is still roomy. Service: Knowledgeable and friendly staff. Our waitress was so intent on giving us a full description of the Australian crab that we didn't have the heart to interrupt her to let her know we were Aussies. Our request to share two entrees between 3 of us didn't get the pained or snooty look it does in some places. In fact there was no air of pretentiousness that you can often get in high end restaurants. You will definitely be made to feel at home. Food: Okay, so after thinking about this for quite a while I can safely say this was the best meal of my life. Completely flawless in all respects from the drinks onwards. We tried the chirashi which at $32 was a bargain and something I'd go back for in a heartbeat. It is basically a deconstructed bowl of nigiri sushi but this doesn't do it justice. There was loads of different fish and roe and perfect seasoning which made this the most exquisite single dish I've ever had. I also tried two kinds of nigiri sushi (shad and live squid) which were terrific but a word to the wise - the pricing is per piece not for two pieces which is the standard at most places. Next we had the "duck, duck, duck" and halibut entrees. Both were excellent, but I felt the duck was a little heavy for the most part while the halibut was a lighter fare with a delicious broth. Price: Okay, so probably a one-off for most people, but definitely worth it. The chirashi would be more than enough to fill anyone and as a single dish is quite affordable. Other: This may sound crass but a visit to their restroom provides a unique sit-down experience. Really.

Lots of reviews so far so I'll keep mine as brief and informative as possible... I've been here before and it WAS gr8 in the past (when morimoto himself used to jump behind the counter every now and then). It is beautifully constructed and they serve wonderful trendy drinks so the atmosphere is great. The apps range from ok to really good (loved the foie gras chawan mushi and the toro tartare but the rock shrimp tempura was totally over rated as it was ?kind of greasy and gloopy with all that sauce). Without specific detail, The cooked dishes tend to be really good. Now the not so good : The sushi is good but now well below par for a place this well renowned, but I guess that's what ultimately happens when you sell your name out to the cookie cutter process (although I think that sushi at Nobu is still very good although simple and traditional). The fish quality was good as always but many (4) items were unavailable. Also, ?the sushi on this nite visibly and tastefully ?lacked the hands of a sushi master. ?The pieces of fish were so thin that they were the same temp as the luke warm sushi rice by the time they arrived. ?Also, when the fish is that thin, ?it gets over powered by the rice (unless we're talking about fluke or other fish that are intended to be sliced thin). ?I know my sushi ;) ? ?I have to say that the live octopus sushi was probably the best bite i had. The sushi bar itself is constructed in a way that ?one will have absolutely no interaction with the chef that makes your food (which IMHO is a mistake). ?Having risen up the ranks while working over at Nobu, ?I don't think morimoto wanted anyone to rise up from within his restaurant. ?Plus I'm sure it's hard to find so many chefs with personalities to man all those restaurants. ?The result is a sushi bar experience that lacks any interaction or intimacy. ?You can see the chefs working but they're too far to advise you or even hand you your food without getting up and really reaching far (which they don't do). ?So imagine going to a really good sushi bar and and talking to the waiter, ONLY, ?never the chef. ?Why bother? Now back to some more good: The desserts are really really good. ?I think they're better than the sushi. ?I've been here numerous times and who ever does the desserts knows what they are doing. ?On this night we had the TOFU Hot & Cold. ?Very nice. ?Definitely save some room. Overall, ?if atmosphere in a Japanese restaurant is what you're looking for then this place will do quite nicely. ?However, ?if you're in the need for really high end sushi with a true master chef's fingerprint on your experience, ?perhaps think about heading over to Sushi of Gari of Sushi Seki.

This was the best meal we had in NYC on our honeymoon. Finally some daring cuisine and a lively scene to match. We were tempted to go with the tasting menu but ultimately decided for traditional dining. Good choice (and the guys sitting next to us had the tasting menu so we got the bonus of seeing that up close). The rock shrimp app was outstanding. I did not expect the chicken wing twist to it, but it was unique and delicious. The halibut again was delicious and perfectly cooked, and the specialty cocktails we shared, while not exactly up my alley, were quite tasty and inventive. Basically, if you like Iron Chef and want to feel like a judge on the show, you will not be let down by Mr. Morimoto.

I ate at Morimoto's this past Saturday night for the second time in the last 2 years. The first time I had gone was for NYC Restaurant Week in the summer of '07. That time I went with my gut reaction and stuck to the sushi which was splendid. Worth every penny? No, but still first class. On Saturday I was there to celebrate my best friends 24th birthday with her sister and a girlfriend of ours. We arrived a little early for our 6:45 reservation and our coats were check and we were seated immediately by the friendly hosts. My first complaint about this place began here though. They stuck us in this little section and put us in the corner. Maneuvering in and out of our seats were quite the challenge. This annoyed me. Our seemingly new waiter brought us our menus, bragged to us about some overpriced cocktail, and then disappeared. When he returned we had decided on a bottle of white wine and several appetizers. We ordered the Tuna Pizza, the Rock Shrimp Tempura, and the Ramen Soup. All were excellent. The second thing that annoyed me occurred when our waited reappeared with our bottle of pinot grigio. He carded us. I'm not talking about he had to because his manager was standing over his back. ?This was the VERY first time I have ever been carded at a 4+ star establishment in my 23 years of existence. Normally I wouldn't be annoyed but this really kind of pissed me off. Reaffirmed that I was eating in a chain restaurant. It probably wouldn't have bothered me so much if he cared to card us when we ordered, but he did not. Oh well... I'm over it... sort of. Ha. For some reason it wasn't until after we finished our appetizers that our waiter decided to take our dinner order. We wound up eating our appetizers on an overcrowded table filled with menus. (Obviously this was annoyance #3.) I went with the Surf and Turf. Wagyu beef (rare) and hamachi ribbons prepared at your table. I expected ALOT from this choice. Truthfully though, it was merely good. I didn't think the wagyu beef filet was anything to write home about...and if I know anything, its steak. The hamachi ribbons were nothing like what I had been expecting. The put pieces of hamachi (yellowtail sashimi) atop a bed of guacamole. The prepared at your table was the most pointless thing I have ever experienced. Not only was it extremely awkward because I was sitting in crammed corner, but I still don't understand the need for anyone to squeeze a little syringe filled with a citrus soy mixture on my fish and then mix the guac and fish together. Did I like the dish? Yes. Will I ever spend $40 to have it again...? NO. Will I steal Mr. Morimotos recipe and replicate it in my kitchen on a special occasion in the futue? YES. For dessert I split the special they had... But only because the description included pop rocks. That's right...pop rocks. I was super excited about this dessert and I never eat dessert. Total disappointment. :-(. Overall I give my 2nd experience at Morimoto's a 3 out of 5. My first experience was definitely a 4 of 5. The service was mediocre, where we sat was absurd. In all truth my favorite part of the evening was the awesome toilets that clean your butt (and the front!). Ha, ha. Oh that and my best friend must've have really liked what she had ordered (the lobster) because she wore it home.

Not as expensive as I had feared, due mostly to the fact that if you stick to the very delicious and filling rolls (the spicy tuna and shrimp tempura rolls were great), you can keep the price down. We had the tuna pizza to start and I was blown away. Do not be deterred by the semi-unappetizing sound of "anchovy aioli." I did have a small incident with a particularly vindictive jalapeno, which was quelled only by sucking on the bready part of the pizza, but it really was superb. I love spicy food but this particular jalapeno made my face turn purple and nearly brought tears to my eyes. Still, it was amazing (I did subsequently pick all the jalapenos off.) I could go there and eat the tuna pizza alone as a (small) meal.

Oh my, where do I begin? This is probably my new favorite "more expensive" restaurant in Manhattan (my favorite will always be La Masseria, don't you worry). I came here for lunch with my little sister and it was an epic feast. Ambiance: 5/5. I wanted to start with this because this place is beautiful. You enter through two sliding glass doors to see big, open ceilings with even more glass; it's so very posh and modern. The shiny hardcover books with Morimoto proudly displayed on the cover out in the front are a nice touch too. The space is laid out nicely so you actually are far enough away from the next table to feel calm and the white leather chairs are comfy and somehow make the area a bit more cozy in the cavernous setting of the restaurant. There's a few different seating areas--bar, table, and what seemed like the traditional Japenese kneel-down tables. Interesting. Food: 5/5. I'll go in order. We had the toro tartare to start, which is a MUST order here. It's served in the most extravagant style in a big bowl with ice, garnished with big banana leaves, little Japanese prickly fruits, and 2 wooden boxes--1 with the toro and 1 with a variety of sauces. It made me so happy. The utensil you used were little metal flat scoop-like mini-shovel-esque things so you could pick up a piece of toro and pick a sauce (or all of them...at the same time). The toro was fresh and yummy, though I generally prefer toro it is natural, sliced, fatty form. The sauces were DELICIOUS and the little crunchy things (whatever they were called) was the perfect change-up to the smoothness of the fish. The sticky black sauce was also addictive. Next, we had 2 rolls of sushi: Calilfornia roll and Spicy Tuna (my sis' favorite and my favorite, respectively). After we each had a piece, we nodded in unison as I said, "This is what sushi is supposed to taste like!" The rolls were SO GOOD. The rice was cooked perfectly, the fish was fresh and plentiful, the avocado was fresh, they used real crab, I mean...it was just the sum of all perfect bits to make a perfect whole roll. Not to mention their wasabi is homemade AND their ginger is so addictively good I ate all of it even after I was done with the rolls. I usually hate picked ginger! Next we had the Morimoto sandwich, which was quite different from our last course. The sandwich itself was toasted nicely, the meat was roasted and marinated in something delicious I don't remember, and the mayo was so light and fluffy it was bewildering. However, the most epic part of this meal was the...dun dun dun...ONION RING. Absolute best onion ring I've ever had in my entire freaking life. That includes the ones at every single nice burger joint I've ever been to. It was perfectly fried, flaky with the perfect light crunch. You never encountered the problem where the onion would will itself out of its fried outer parts and you'd be left with batter--oh no, the onion stayed put and you could enjoy those two delicious unhealthy bits together. It was so good it didn't make sense. Finally, we ended with a warm chocolate cake that had ice cream and pear sorbet. This was the best chocolate cake I've ever had and I really don't even like chocolate cake. The ice cream was delicious but I thought the combination with the pear sorbet was weird. I understand the pear was to cleanse your palette but it just didn't taste quite right after the denseness and richness of the chocolate. The caramel popcorn was yummy too, but kept sticking to my teeth so I generally just stayed away. Drinks: 5/5. We got the virgin white lily and it was like crack. It's the yuzu man, that's probably what Japanese people use to barter with because it is so damn good. I'd go back there just to sit at the bar and drink those all night. Service: 3/5. The service was alright, nothing spectacular. The waiter was good for not being pushy-pushy with their famous popcorn chicken (since it had wasabi and sis doesn't like wasabi) but he totally forgot the birthday candle in her dessert. Oh well. He was prompt and amicable but I don't remember being wowed. Overall, Morimoto restaurant's attention to detail truly created a wonderful experience. I adore this restaurant and will be back soon.

So thanks to NYC Restaurant Week, I was able to visit one of the most expensive/famous Japanese restaurants in NYC with my med student budget. For $25, they really have a lot more food than a lot of the other restaurant week participants (which was quite surprising). They only offer lunch special for restaurant week, which was completely fine with me. As long as I could step inside and be able to taste a dish (without breaking my bank) then I was satisfied :D ? Anyway, aside from sounding like a complete obsessive stalker/admirer of Morimoto, the food was undoubtedly good......but not life-changing. It could be due to the menu selection for restaurant week (I mean, of course they're not going to give you their best dishes for $25). They did have a great variety tho - soup, salad, tempura, sushi/sashimi, and whichever main course you choose (I chose the wagyu beef). I would have to say.. the best was probably the Miso soup and the tempura. The stock was amazing, you can taste all the fish, ingredients, and time spent making it. And I think that is probably the hardest to master considering ALL Japanese restaurants offer Miso soup. It shows a lot about a restaurant when you can really taste how much work went into such a simple dish. The tempura was different where it didn't have the usual Tentsuyu sauce, but it had a creamy, cheesy, Westernized sauce. That sauce went surprisingly well with the tempura! I was just scooping the sauce out to eat even after I finished the tempura.. I REALLY loved the design of the place. So elegant and modern! Good spacing and you feel like you have very good privacy wherever you sit. I liked how the place had a very clean feeling to it. And the BATHROOM! Wow.. those Japanese toilets.. I definitely spent some time playing with the buttons there :D hahaha When I can actually afford to try the Morimoto Omakase that's $120 a person, I'm sure the missing star will find its place.

I think it's worth breaking down just how much i love Chef Morimoto. I'm quick to admit how formative he was in my evolution of eating, understanding, and embracing of Japanese cuisine via Iron Chef. Okay fine, I'm kind of obsessed. I've been to both the Philly restaurant (review TBA) and more recently, the jaw-dropping NYC one as well. I went on a Monday night with the gf, and while I didn't have a problem getting a reservation only a day prior, that shit was still pretty packed for a Monday night. The decor is absolutely top notch, with tables on multiple levels of floor, and with a stunning downstairs bar that's refined and modern. The waitress we had was super knowledgeable about the various dishes as well as certain kinds of (adventurous) fish---I knew we were about to drop a few hundred dollars, so she was definitely at the level I expected. When I went to the Philly Morimoto, everyone told me it was all about the Omakase (chef's choice, pre set here) and I'm not necessarily disagreeing with that... but at the NYC Morimoto, we opted to not be limited by that and order a bunch of stuff from the menu. And let me tell you... BEST DECISION EVER. ?On the real--the more adventurous you are with what you order here, the bigger the payoff. My highlights: -- Toro Tartare - Kind of obvious, right? ?Well sure until you see the INSANITY of the presentation on this. A beautiful box filled with elegantly shaved ice shows up, and on top of that is a smaller box filled with luscious, delicate toro in tartare. The coolest part though was that it came with an assortment of compliments---caviar, creme friache, fresh wasabi, seaweed paste, some weird kind of soy sauce, etc, all taking your bite down a different path. Genius. -- Lamb Carpaccio - ?I mean honestly, if I'm ever going to eat raw lamb, or any kind of red meat that's RAW, it's only going to be from a recipe coming from the mind of Morimoto. And boy am I glad that I did. My girlfriend described the flavor of this as "sour cream & onion chips" and while that's not entirely inaccurate, the flavor isn't over-powering and you can still get accustomed to the natural flavor of the lamb itself. ?I'm personally not a big "lamb guy" but, would always make an exception for this. The texture was out of control---super elegant and highly recommended. -- Kakuni - aka some cut of pork that tastes like butter, sitting in a pool of thick rice porridge (called "congee") and peppered with a scallion soy sauce. This was the dish that made me, quite literally, drool on the menu when I saw it, and our waitress proceeded to tell us it was her favorite item on the menu. The pork itself already explodes with flavor, but the brilliant part of this dish is the more you break up the mean, the more it absorbs the flavor of the porridge in each successive bite. Conversely, the porridge itself picks up little pieces of pork as well as the natural juices from the meat... making it enjoyable on its own too. Goddamn. -- Yellowtail Pastrami - The kind of dish I remember Morimoto making on Iron Chef and always fantasizing being about to one day try. 100% unique, and 100% exploding with flavor. There's not really "pastrami" here, but the dish does have pastrami that is cured with an amazing japanese 7 spice called togarashi, and it gives the yellowtail a salty, dried flavor that, while still a sashimi based dish, gives it an aura of real pastrami. Bravo! -- Tofu Dessert aka Tofu "Hot & Cold - I was beyond stuffed at this point, but I still wanted to order every dessert on the menu though. I went with the one I had read the most about, and it was a perfect end to an incredible journey of a meal. A trio that includes a Soy Milk Souffle, Maple Ice Cream, and Tofu Cheesecake. The cheesecake was somehow both rich and light, and coupled with the other two, the total experience was transcendent. Couple other things to note. Drinking isn't cheap here---if you're used to ordering a "house sake" or a couple beers, get ready to buck up and drop some more $$. If you want sake, you have to get a big bottle... i think the Nigori sake we got was $60, and that was one of the cheaper ones. Was delicious though. Also, the beer prices are generally for regular sized bottles of beer, not larger ones, which was another surprise. Although really, all this is relatively a moot point---you shouldn't be going to this restaurant on a budget if you want to have the best possible experience. It's better to just save up and go at a later point to really take that shit all the way. And one last thing---the bathroom is off the chain. They have a futuristic toilet + bidet combination that you'll want to play with weather you need to drop one or not. The remote has a variety of settings for the bidet too... shit was nuts. Oh, and did I mention the night I went... Morimoto himself was THERE greeting people?!?!?! ?Now THAT, is truly a dream come true. Morimoto NYC is the apex of modern, neo-japanese dining experiences.

Wow, I'm gonna either look like a hater or people who gave this place good reviews have bad taste in Japanese food. First of all, in order to get in they have to press a button for the doors to open for you. When the doors finally opened and we got to come in, I felt immediately judged that we didn't have money to be eating here or something. The hosts nasty attitude made me wanna leave but I was hungry as hell. Maybe that's why this place wasn't crowded/busy, and we got seated immediately. My party and I tried 2 of their rolls that I can't remember the names of, but who cares, they both weren't that great for me to remember the names. We also tried a cooked sea bass dish, and that was decent. The portions were small ?that's why I was still hungry, but I didn't want to stay and spend my money on below decent food. The service here was below okay, I felt judged by our waitress also, she was also taking care of the table behind us and I was pretty jealous of the treatment they got. I am not cheap or anything, I hella saved for my NYC trip and was willing to spend hella money anywhere that's worth it, but this place doesn't deserve my hard earned money. They got 1 star for their super nice, beautiful, nicely decorated restaurant.

The Original Iron Chef morimoto so I was super excited to try his food finally. The place itself was upscale and very roomy. The service was proably one of my best service ever. They wait hand over backward for you. The menu look outrages and I wanted to try everything but I decided on the 8 course tastering menu for $120. It made more sense because everything on the menu look pretty expensive and figure order all over the menu will just add up the same way. Our cockails drink was pretty good. The first course was tina tartar and it was pretty amazing and I asked our waiter that I saw him making it on one of the Iron Chef show and the waiter told me yes he 1st made it on the show and afterward he putted on his menu. The 2nd course was fluke sashimi w.roast hot oil and green. The hot oil made this dish come alive. The 3 course is the sear salmon w.micro green. It was so and so, I just like the half raw part. The 4 course was my favorite, raw oyster, uni and foie gras and it was amazingly good., The weird combination just melt in your mouth and I will try making this dish when i get a chance. The 5 course was 6 different types of sashimi, it was good as the nobu stand. The 6 and 7 course come together. It was kobe beef and shiny lobster. For another $60 buck you can add the real kobe beef from japan so I had to do it hehe but on friend plate i just got the American Kobe beef so i can see and taste the different. Mine Kobe Beef was delicious. It was alot better then the american one. The lobster was a little over cook. The final plate was the desert, it was a peach sorbet and some types of a sweet bread and it was pretty good. Our waiter Nick was so great and awesome, he did more then he had to. We wanted to take a picture of the Japanese Kobe beef so he took it out from the kitchen so we pose w.the hugh chuck of kobe beef and he gave me a sign moromoto menu. That is what you call service!!

you have to realize that it's hard find a good japanese place in new york just like it's hard to find a good indian place in los angeles. on par with most establishments, morimoto's menu cascades post modern style and expert techniques. keep in mind that the decor itself is worth to see, and his cuisine is unparalleled in terms of expertise and presentation.

Great service and ambiance. TUna pizza, house salad were my favorites! Cod was a bit too salty but very flavorful and buttery. Desserts were not as great as I thought it would be... the cheesecake was pretty nasty but the Chocolate cake with popcorn ice crem was amaaazing.

This one is actually better than the one in Philly, food tastes fresher and service was much better, not to mention they have fancy japanese toilets that practically warm and wipe your ass and the atmosphere is really cool. ?Must have the Tuna tartar...it is awesome!!!! ?I had some rolls, my husband had some steak and yellowtail dish that he raved about. ?The saki here is deadly but good...right next to awesome Chelsea market as well.

From the ambiance, to the cocktails being mixed at the bar below the restaurant's main floor to the food & presentation to the staff & the Iron Chef himself, Masaharu Morimoto----HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!! A must visit if you're in NYC's meat packing district---or within an 80 mile radius

Morimoto has definitely lived up to its name as the iron chef! Reserved a table for 4 here during restaurant week. Our prefix was delicately selected with their signature dishes. The interior was much needed to be raved about. Walking in, you are graced with a sparkling partitioned centerpiece displayed in a cool, attractive grey setting with white drapery dipping into the room from the ceiling. The service was up to part as well. Coat check at the front host counter, full sushi bar to the back, bar and lounge area downstairs and the bathrooms are another story! Absolutely dashing.

Food was excellent but one star knocked off for your cement block chairs. They should be replaced with something easier to move. Rock shrimp, sushi appetizer with crazy plastic tubes of sauces, and steak entrees were all tasty!

The concierge at the Standard sent us here (about the only good thing they did during our stay) and we loved it. ?Besides the beautiful decor and staff the food was incredible. ?We had a 7 or 8 course omakase for two and it was something I'll never forget! ?A truly memorable experience that is worth the $$$$...

Food was good, presentation was superb. Seeing this this was one of Morimoto's restaurants, I was hoping to see more authentic japanese dishes instead of japanese fusion from the iron chef. Nevertheless, the food was amazing here (much better than Nobu) but was very pricey!

the omakase was so not worth the price tag of $120/person. there was one dish that was literally the size of a quarter - oyster and foie gras in teriyaki sauce... the sushi they picked out was all mediocre (with the exception of the toro)... and the wagyu beef they served as part of the entree was bordering on rubbery. service was great though, our waiter was a real sweetheart who took the time to explain every dish thoroughly.

I had very much looked forward to this place, and I have to say everything was a slight disappointment. ?Huge place wish high ceilings, well decorated thu it was a bit bland. ?I went for lunch today (MLK Day) and it was PACKED! ?Although it was restaurant week, we decided to just get bento boxes, as they seemed like a better deal than the Restaurant week special, albeit without the dessert, who needs dessert for lunch? The tables we sat at was about 8 inches away from the table next to us, and i could not help but feel like i was dining with strangers. ?Whenever we said something like "that's so good!" i saw the woman at the table next to us glance over to see what we were talking about. ?Being that it was quite bright too, it was not very intimate at all, not a good place for a date. Since its such a HUGE place with 2 floors i just could not understand why they had to have tables almost on top of each other, i felt like i was back at Yuka. The waiter was very nice, knowledeble about the food, and especially the Saki, which was very nice, he gave us a brief education on the different types. I had the Black Cod bento box. ?It was quite expensive at $24. ?At that price i was expecting it to be amazing. ?It was quite good, but not worth the price. ?The Cod itself was the smallest piece of fish i have ever been served, really way to small, must have been 2 or 3 ounces. ?That said, it was excellent and if i had a bigger portion this review might have been 4 stars. ?The miso soup was decent, not what i expected, and was ALL scallions. ?The sushi was good thu not memorable, we has a yellowtail roll with mayo (??), and a few peices of tuna, salmon and either fluke or maybe red snapper. ?All good, but not worth it, again its a trend. ?The tempura itself was excelent, the shrimp was great, squid was intresting (and chewy), eggplant was a nice addition, but on the bottom of the plate was some kinda chease sauce. ?Not sure who thought it was smart to dip heavy oily fried food in a thick cheese sauce (Morimoto's i assume!), but i did not like this. ?I missed the light vinegar sauce usually served. ?The bento box did not come with rice either, which i could have used. ?I also ordered a salmon roll which was not very good at all, small and not particularly good fish. ?As another reviewer noted, i too left here fealing hungry, and after a $100 lunch, including sake, i should NOT have left hungry. ?The other bento box had the kobe beef, excellent dish and a nice size portion, that's certainly my recommendation if you are going there for lunch. ? We also waited a long time for our food, and the nosy people next to us who arrived 15 minutes latter had thier food 10 minutes before we did. ?Not very organizes. ?We also waited a while for the check, nice waiter but may have had to many tables to wait. Overall, disappointing. ?Go here if money is not an option, i am sure the $120 Omakase dinner is incredible, just not for me!

I was looking forward to the black cod so had it and while it was truly delectable, I thought it was a tad sweet. The salad was well done, not too heavy not too light and the greens were really fresh. I had a sampling of some desserts which was fine but not outstanding. I liked the mango tea to end the meal. I'll probably give it another shot with the omakase and give another review.

For her first night in town, the only requirements that Lauren had for dinner on Friday were: Japanese cuisine served in a grand, modern and theatrical space. ?Having never been to Morimoto before, I assumed that this restaurant would fit all of her specifications (with the added bonus being that Morimoto is the brainchild of the Iron Chef himself, Masaharu Morimoto). Lauren and I arrived at Morimoto 30 minutes prior to our 8:45pm reservation. ?We were told that we could grab a cocktail in the bar downstairs, and a hostess would come find us when our table was ready. ?The restaurant/bar is a large, bi-level space with an interior that emphasizes how attractive and serene that the use of concrete, Lucite and creamy whimsical shears can be. As the clock struck 8:45pm, Lauren and I were whisked to our table. ?We began our meal with Morimoto's signature drink, the White Lily, made with vodka and a Japanese lemon soda. ?Instead of ordering entrees or the omakase, we chose to share an assortment of small plates: * Kobe beef Carpaccio * Spicy king crab broiled on the half shell * Hamachi sashimi (yellowtail) * Pork gyoza * Beef curry bread I rarely order beef over tuna Carpaccio, but Lauren insisted that we must. ?The Kobe beef was thinly sliced and arrived in a shallow pool of yuzu soy, hot oil and finely chopped mitsuba leaf. ?Every ingredient intertwined perfectly together, creating a symphony of flavor in my mouth. When the spicy king crab arrived, I was surprised by its physically enormous size and Morimoto's generous portion. ?I was also pleased to find that the kitchen had, in fact, taken the dirty work out of a potentially disastrous chore: Indeed, the crustacean was served on the half shell, thus making crab meat removal a breeze. ?The exposed flesh was painted with a spicy mayonnaise, broiled to perfection, and finished with tiny caviar pearls. ? ? ? ? While the hamachi (yellowtail) was fresh and of high quality, I found that it served more as a palate cleanser between more flavorful dishes. When the pork gyoza arrived, I had to ask our server if he had made a mistake and served us the wrong dish. ?I was mystified by the paper-thin, golden crust that enveloped the top of the entire serving of dumplings. ?Upon "crust" removal, I was even more shocked to find that the gyozas were floating atop a bed of marinara sauce. ?Honestly, if this combination is considered haute fusion, I'm not a fan. ?While the dumplings were OK, I just couldn't get past the pool of bright red spaghetti sauce. I wasn't quite sure what to expect when we ordered the beef curry bread. ?Perhaps it was a curried meatball inside of a Chinese bun. ?Or maybe curried beef was served atop sliced baguette. ?Wrong and wrong. ?A plate arrived with 2 golden panko-crusted spheres that were the size of mini Nerf footballs. ?"How in the hell are we supposed to eat this?" Lauren asked. ?We decided to delicately halve each piece and split the dish in to four manageable servings. ?The beef curry bread reminded me of an empanada, only with much more filling and a less doughy, crispier exterior. ? Upon realization that we had each dropped $100 on our meal, our playful cocktail buzz immediately wore off. ?The couple seated next to us had chosen the chef's omakase which, for $120 per person, seemed to be the best deal in the house. ?All in all, Lauren and I enjoyed a nice meal, excellent cocktails and an outstanding atmosphere.

I always have an excellent meal here. I also LOVE the space. The menu is extensive so it can be hard to make a decision. You can have the omakase, but it's actually nice to just pick things off the menu and go with a group of 4. Kobe beef carpacio, tuna pizza, sashimi, iron chef ramen/noodle soup. My favorite is the whole roasted lobster!

Hi, Morimoto-San. Good job on the delicious fare. Honestly, this place was good in both service & food (you know me and my service). I'm happy to be on vacay in one of the biggest foodie towns. We .love. Iron Chef, so we took our NYC resident friend and hopped over to Meat Packing District. Even though we were late for our reservations (darn subway), we were seated pretty quickly. Decor was beautiful, white-based, classy w/ lots of glass. The place held true to it's J-roots, which I expected from Morimoto. Also, proportions were fairly big, especially for this type of restaurant and for Japanese cuisine, which is normally centered on many smaller plates. Very nice. We had: Raw Bar Lobster- Nice, tender, Maine lobster chunks. The sauces were very tasty, they were stand alone good. Tofu Miso - Hugest bowl of life. Bigger than my head! I didn't expect that... Nice fresh tofu, soft and delicious Chirashi Sushi Bowl- Octopus, salmon, roe.. a mountain of fish on a bowl of rice w/ a small miso on the side. Spicy Tuna Maki Roll- The tuna was not chopped up as we traditionally partake it, but the tuna was extremely fresh Sea Bass Entree- Large piece of fish over tempura avocado. The fish was light and buttery and the tempura avocado was delish. Everything fried is better. Angry Chicken Entree- SO good!!! It had a Japanese-curry flavor and was served over fingerling potatoes, chiles and a chicken jus with a side of mehkrab noodles. The noodles (puffy rice noodles) were salted, and had a good texture in contrast with the tender, juciness of the chicken. Chix was not dry at all and had an awesome taste. White Lily Drink- OMG so delicious. I normally don't really drink the girly drinks, but this one w/ sochu, yuzu and calpico was SO amazing. It was NOT candy sweet, had the right amount of citrus to balance. Finished w/ a lemon twist & lemon peel garnish Strawberry Pistachio Cheesecake w/ Sorbet- Japanese style cheesecake (read: not sweet, not a huge portion) with a very pistachio, nutty flavor served with several sliced strawbs on top. The berry sorbet was VERY berry, a little tart. Served with a side of pink poprocks (can you get any cooler?) Overall, the atmosphere was fun, classy, but not stuck-up. The service was awesome, friendly, and informative. But the best part of all? The restrooms. That's right. Located in the bar area downstairs, they are hidden as they should be. But once you enter a stall, you will find a mirrored wall with glass cherry blossoms appearing to lead down a long corridor (an illusion I suppose!). The toilets are Japanese heated toilets.. heated seats with washing capabilities (and T.P. for those too scared to try it). Reminded me of my 6-week stint in Nihon!!! Yummilicious Factor = A

We were at Chelsea Market for lunch, and my mom, an Iron Chef fan, wanted to come here. Unfortunately, we found out that the lunch menu differs from the dinner menu (specifically, the Duck Duck Duck is not available during lunch), but we went around that. I ordered the prix fixe of miso soup, sashimi salad, and dessert. It wasn't terribly priced for $30 before tax&tip. The miso soup was the norm (though a much larger bowl). The sashimi salad was edge-seared tuna on salad. It wasn't a huge portion, but perfect for lunch (and left me room to sample other places I wanted to try in Chelsea Market). Dessert was a delicious and light panna cotta... perfect end to a well-portioned lunch. I wish I'd gotten to try dinner here, as I think it would've been a totally different experience. Also, please note that this place is NOT a Japanese restaurant as some people were quick to criticize--it is fusion, which allows for artistic license. Design of the place is interesting and classy.The weird post-modern music is kind of annoying after a while, though it's probably drowned out when the place is busy at dinner (there was barely anyone there at lunch). Oh, and other notes about the decor: also the front door is covered up by red cloth... we would've missed it if we didn't know it was there. And the bathroom door SLIDES open, not push/pull... so you don't embarrass yourself in front of waiters and other patrons. :P Overall, a pleasant experience & good food for a decent price. I hope to return one day to try the Duck Duck Duck!

Another incredible meal....I love this place. Service is really slow but it was lunch and they usually put the morons on the lunch shift anyway...and we were in no rush...the wagyu carpaccio is one of the best dishes in NYC and the sushi/sashimi is super-fresh and exotic (barracuda, anyone?)

we were able to score some last minute early reservations which was the start to our restaurant tour of the meat packing district on a saturday night. 6pm, and we were seated. started off with a orange blossom drink that was so strong i really had to pace myself or i wouldve been plastered by the time the first dish came out. i have 2 words for you, toro tuna. yowser!! this was quite possibly one of the best things i have ever eaten. you use a paddle to scoop up some wasabi, seaweed, avocado spread, etc then load up with the softest freshest tuna i have ever eaten then dip it in a sauce for a total explosion of flavors in your mouth. the rock shrimp tempura was also really good and quite a nice size serving. then came the beef curry bread. i wasnt sure what to expect but wow this was good- a perfect blend of indian and japanese flavors created an interesting and divine experience. i cannot wait to dine here again...

If it's your first time here, don't be a cheapy cheap. Just go for the ?omakase. And of course try their cocktails. I was really impressed by the decor as well as the bathroom. It's such a nice experience to dine there. My most memorable part of the experience had to be the sashimi wash board plated tasting dish (Toro tuna belly). They offered a meat / truffle option so of course I said meat. And im so glad I decided to make the "upgrade" ... The meat was really tender, cooked well, kinda melted in my mouth kind of way. Anyways, I left really happy, smiles ear to ear. One, because of the experience.. And two, because I didn't have to pay for my meal that night !!

Morimoto's for restaurant week lunch option is the way to go! ? Everything was delicious. I had the waygu beef bento box with one of the non-alcoholic ice tea drinks. My favorite part is the communal table and the dessert that came with the prix fixe menu. It was a green tea coconut mouse with fresh berries in a shooter type thing. It was a perfecting ending to a lovely lunch. Everyone was really nice and very hospitable. The waiter was attentive, without being annoying. Awesome place! it only it wasn't so far west.

Obviously, the food and presentation are fantastic. If that's not enough, go for the wall of Ty Nant water bottles, cool vibe and equally cool bathrooms. I no longer eat seafood but I loved the black cod at Morimoto and thought it was better than Nobu's. Check out the bar downstairs before you take your table and try the White Lily. You can't even taste the alcohol. It's also fun to eat at the sushi bar.

I splurge on rare occasions and when I do, I expect the food to be good and service to be attentive. The whole table opted for omakase and we all enjoyed our first course which was the toro tartare. The next few courses were pretty unremarkable (fluke, barracuda, oyster+foie gras). The sushi was fresh and was my personal favorite part of the meal. The main dish included wagyu steak and lobster. The steak was delicious. As for the service, it was almost nonexistent and our waitress was nowhere to be found. I don't like "stuffy" service but the basics should've been covered. The only person who made sure that we got what we needed was the manager. He kept a close eye on our table, pointed out that our glasses needed to be refilled and noticed that we didn't have soy sauce dishes for our nigiri. We ordered our cocktails from him too. I didn't think our waitress deserved our tip and wanted to give it to him instead. This was unacceptable and ruined our dinner. Decor itself is cleaner and classier than the one in Philly. Make sure to check out the bathroom. Probably won't be returning but if I do, I won't be getting omakase.

I tried Morimoto in Tokyo and became obsessed with their toro tuna tartare. When I came to NYC this time I decided that making a pit stop here to have his toro would be essential. The sliding door entrance is very cool and as you enter you are greeted with a very clean and modern interior. We were seated in a room to the left which was a bit crowded but as we were only staying for a round of appetizers it was fine. Had I stayed for an entire meal I would have probably felt uncomfortable. We decided on three starters: the tuna tartare, the rock shrimp tempura, and the curry beef bread. The tuna tartare is still one of the best things I have ever eaten. Do yourself a favor and if you are anywhere near a Morimoto have the tuna tartare. The rock shrimp was nothing special and tasted very much like every other rock shrimp I have ever had. And finally the curry bread was delicious. It had the true japanese curry flavors in a soft and fried bread. It is comfort food. Maybe one day Morimoto will come to Miami and I can have my toro tartare fix more often.

there is a reason why this man is an iron chef. heavenly food, great service, awesome atmosphere, and all for such a reasonable price! id recommend sharing some appetizers with the table. try the sashimi plate, curry beef bread, and/or the spicy alaskan king crab. ? for the entree, i love the special they've had lately where they take the buri bop that usually has hamachi in it and instead replace that with grade a kobe beef. they sear the beef on the side of the hot stone bowl while they prepare your dish in front of you. the beef melts in your mouth and the flavorful sauce is to dieee for. it's a pricey dish but well worth it. finally, dessert! what i really like about morimoto's desserts is that they aren't too sweet and the portions are just right. the cakes aren't traditional - they're actually really thin and long rectangles. id recommend the sesame green tea cake or the strawberry pistachio "cheesecake". some of the desserts come with delicious sorbets of unique flavors like strawberry or wasabi. p.s. if you're lucky, you'll even see morimoto walking around greeting people at their tables (check out the profile picture :]).

I was fortunate to eat here a few years ago, and I must say, it was the best meal I've ever had! We each tried the seven course menu, and each dish was beyond amazing. We were lucky enough to be seated right in front of Chef Morimoto while he was preparing sushi. Even better, he made one of our sushi courses! Usually when you eat at celebrity chef's restaurant, the food isn't as good as you're hoping it'll be. At Morimoto's, the food is definately in honor of being an Iron Chef's restaurant (unlike another Iron Chef's restaurant I've been to). The atmosphere is very modern and chic, not to mention the authentic Japanese toilets that will heat the seat if you wish. Next time in New York, I will definately be coming back.

First of all, the restaurant looks more like a swanky upscale club than a restaurant. ?It was beautiful. ?My mistake was ordering sushi...instead of the main dishes. ?The service was excellent, and although my sushi was extremely fresh, it was also pretty forgettable. ?This is not what I expect from my favorite all time kick ass Iron Chef. ?I saw other people ordering main courses meals and I was envious. ?I would definitely return and try other dishes...So my assumption is that my 3 star rating is only temporary.

i really wanted to like this place because i love watching morimoto on the food network. we came in a large group, but i'm not sure this place is suitable for large groups only because the ambiance was very intimate, you shouldn't be loud and it was pretty romantic too. perfect place to take a date to impress. the sushi was totally not worth it in my opinion, although they were good but completely overpriced. i'd rather take that money and have sushi at sushi yasuda. the rock shrimp was good only because it was my first time having it, but i've had it more since then. i would probably give this place a second try but other than the gorgeous bathroom i wouldn't expect too much. to me, it was just an overpriced pretentious nyc restaurant to be seen and heard.

Came here with my mom for lunch since I thought restaurant week was the only time I'd ever be able to afford Morimoto. When I saw the menu, I learned that wasn't true, that the sushi rolls were actually pretty reasonably priced. I thought the best part of the meal was the summer pudding dessert -- amazing. While the sushi was tasty, I've had better in this city. The service was fabulous and I'd probably go back to try other things. My mom had the prix fixe lunch: green salad (really good citrus dressing), sea bass (YUM!), and coconut panna cotta. I had a spicy salmon roll, spicy tuna roll, miso soup, and summer pudding. The miso was miso -- fine, nothing spectacular. The sushi rolls were pretty good. Interestingly, the spicy sauce was on the inside of the roll which was a nice touch, didn't overpower the fish. But yeah, that summer pudding was to die for.

I've been making my rounds on the celebrity chef scene lately, and Morimoto did not disappoint. Obviously, I was a huge fan of Iron Chef on Food Network. Not the Iron Chef America, but the original- Iron Chef Japan, and although Morimoto did not post an impressive record (not like Sakai at least) I thought his cooking style was intriguing, and had to try a restaurant that he had a part of. The tasting menu clearly is a great experience. 7, courses ranging in size from one bite (an oyster) to several (a few pieces of sashimi) to surf and turf. Nearly all of the courses were good, some outstanding, but for some reason a couple just seemed lacking. I'll pick on the Oyster- It was simply an Oyster- which I understand is a delicacy to some, but I hard a hard time getting excite about, where was the creativity that was so very present in the Tuna tartare dish (best presentation of the night for sure) or the Surf and Turf? The service was spot an on and attentive. Also, there's a bar downstairs, and if you haven't seen it- its absolutely insane. Impeccably dressed women and business men types talking loudly and blocking access to the restrooms (and of course ignoring you as you say excuse me, but being indignant if you try to push through) Yeah, it was a scene, but that seems to be a weekend thing. Overall, I'm trying to be more discerning with my 5 stars, but this place is close. Highly recommended even if it is waaaaay across town.

Morimoto is the very best kind of New York dining. ?Trendy and beautiful on the inside, yet with solid food and amazing service. ?There are plenty of places in this city for a couple to throw down $200+ on dinner, but Morimoto delivers on all the important stuff. ?The staff is attentive without being intrusive. ?The food is creative, reasonably sized and delicious. ?The space itself is gorgeous... and they will seat us with no reservation at 7:30pm on a Friday night. ?I can't really imagine anything else that I would want in a restaurant. ?I feel lucky to live just a few blocks away.

Very avarage place with not so avarage prices! Dont go! We had better sushi and the rest of dishes were not that good. The only thing I loved was miso soup. They served under cooked Pork gydza which is already just weird for such an upscale place! After we asked to remove the dish the were concerned and apologizing,so I assume service was good enough. So in this specific case I d say just Food is not worth of trying and thats is quite bad review already,especially given how hard to book this place and how high they rate themselves. Sorry Morimoto,if Zuma was in town you would be empty...

Everything about this restaurant is amazing. We were lucky to be seated at the best table in the house, about 5 feet from where Morimoto himself was entertaining his staff and creating beautiful sushi. We each has the Omakase menu which was $120 of pure delight. We also took some photos with Morimoto himself; he was very sweet. The food was incredible, displayed beautifully and the restaurant was so chic and modern; I can't wait to visit again the next time we visit the big Apple!

I had a very nice time at this restaurant. ?I took my best friend here for her birthday dinner along with other friends. ?When we got there, hostess was nice, and our server was really friendly (sorry I forgot her name) she was very knowledgeable with the menu and good at suggesting ideas for dinner. ?my brother and i love japanese food, so we had to try the omakase which consisted of several different dishes prepared by the chef. ?they all tasted great and very nice presentation. ive never had foie gras and fugu in my life but i did try them and i actually enjoyed it! ? love this place! ?great dining experience but very pricey!

Scale of 1-10: Food: 10 Service: 8 Atmosphere: 9 Dinner for 2 people (plus tax and tip): $220 Favorite dish: can't remember which specifically, but everything we tried was good Pros: -Great food, diverse menu -The pace of service was just right -Surprisingly stress-free atmosphere for such a trendy restaurant, tables were large and spacious and not too loud. We sat at the bar and even there had plenty of space -I was able to make a Saturday night reservation only 2 days advance, and even though it was a bar seat it was almost as comfortable and spacious as sitting at a table Cons: -It ain't cheap and portions are on the smaller side -Not easy to get there by public transportation -Waiter was accommodating and cordial but not especially friendly which is unusual for such a high end restaurant

came here for lunch during restaurant week but decided to get the kobe beef bento box instead of the prix fix. my friend got the ?black cod bento. my bento came with clam miso soup (good), salad (ok), sushi and sashimi (small cuts but good), tempura (good), and kobe beef (too salty and just ok, it is not a small kobe beef steak, it is almost ground meat) it was 27 and the black cod which my friend really liked was 24. loved the ambiance, as it was simplistic and not trying too hard. the entrance was actually really nice. oh and she said the toilet seats were heated!

What can I say, a great place to enjoy an evening with your friends. Very nice decor, staff is very attentive to the customers needs. Went here with a friend of mine, while visiting him in New York. We both ordered the tasting menu, looking for amazing Asian taste. We had 7 dishes with the tasting menu. The toro tartare with caviar and the Sushi plate were my favorite. The remaining dishes were either too sweet or less flavored (spices) to my palate. Little disappointment there. But overall I find the place relaxing.

So it was my fiance's birthday this past weekend and due to the recession I was going to take him to a restaurant that wasn't TOO pricey. However, since I love him so much I decided to spoil him and take him to the infamous Iron Chef Morimoto's restaurant. Luckily I had landed a 6:45 reservation the night before. I made sure to indicate that it was my fiance's birthday so I expected to get better seats and birthday decoration on the desserts. After hearing and seeing great reviews from my friends and fellow yelpers, the expectation for Morimoto was very high. The food was definitely good but I cannot say that about the service and accomadations for special occasions. Highlights: Spicy king Crab (this was absolutely delicious and the portion was rather large too) Foie Gras Mushi ( Duck breast) (Very rich) This was just okay: Smoked Salmon Ravioli Toro Tartar ( This was a very popular item. I noticed alot of people ordered this. Lobster Entree ( The presentation was too ordinary and it tasted okay not great) Did not like: Soft Shell Crab roll ( Too oily and big. Had to cut it in half to put in my mouth) California Roll ( Could not taste the crab meat at all) Hmmm.... My overall review of Morimoto is 3.5 Stars but since there isn't that option I would say it is closer to 4. I give the food 4 stars and the service and atmosphere a 3. Apparently, Morimoto is recession proof because the place was packed! I was upset that they did not prepare the dessert for my fiance's birthday with the birthday decorations when I specifically asked them to on the reservation and I had called them the day of the reservation. I was disappointed when they brought out the "naked" dessert we had ordered. I called the waitress over as I was walking to the restroom to tell her about it. She said not to worry that they would send over something of which they did but later BILLED me for it. I thought that was a little shady. Another negative aspect was that if I didn't check the bill I wouldn't have noticed they almost accidentally charged us for a half bottle of Riesling that they did not have. I would advise people that haven't been here before to just expect good food but not good service at this restaurant. Also, make sure to ask for private booths for couples or you will be sitting extremely close to other people. We were so close, I could hear practically everything the other two couples were saying.

we had a fantastic meal here. ?we ordered: ramen soup: lives up to the hype, perfect broth.. rock shrimp tempura: our favorite part of the meal! sauces were finger-licking. black cod in miso: very good, but i would've preferred less sauce duck, duck, duck: huge--this is a LOT of duck. delicious, though service was slow and not very attentive, though--the only ding of the evening.

Restaurant Week lunch trip to Morimoto. ?I love the man from the old Iron Chef days. ?Great stuff. ?The food was very very good. ?I found the sushi to be fantastic. ?The Beef Gyudon truly felt like something straight out of Tokyo (was just there in March). ?The Panna Cotta was awesome. ?The Food was just a great experience. ?The restaurant looks very cool. ?The server had a bit of that "Oh .. you're here for restaurant week.." to them. ?no shocker. ?Anyway, neat to try the place at a semi-affordable price.

4 stars for the $70 blowfish appetizer. my boyfriend and i LOVED it. ?it was a little sweet and fishy and just taste so good. entree: he got the lobster. it was okay, didnt wow me. ?i got the duck with the duck egg. the duck egg was really creative and really good. the duck meat taste pretty typical. ? interior of the place was really grand, especially the entrance. felt like i was in a club. the ceilling was this floating cloud looking thing. my boyfriend said it was concrete but i doubt it, it looks like fabric to me. please do check out the bathroom, its worth it! 4 stars for blowfish and the experience.

This place is our staple sushi place in the meatpacking. Great sushi and miso soup and cool atmosphere. We always go without a reservation and just sit at the bar or sushi bar. Morimoto is expensive but we actually did it for 100 for 2 people with only having one glass of alcohol...not too bad

So here is what we ordered: Chef's combination sashimi ($80) - the assortment of fishes were very fresh and the sashimi melts in your mouth We also ordered uni sashimi on the side because it wasnt included in the chef's combination, and the texture of the uni was very smooth and sweet Soft Shell Crab roll- nothing too special, although the crab meat was very chunky (in a good way) Toro Tartare- Good Morimoto sashimi- it had layers of seared toro, salmon, eel, tuna, and something else, and you can dip it in 5 different sauce Oyster Foie Gras- VERY YUMMY, the foie gras was the best I've ever had, usually I'm not tooo big of a fan about it, but this was good ! ?Everything went really well together ( foie gras, uni, and oyster) ? Steamed Scallop - ?nice texture as well Udon- nothing special about this dish... Dessert- Strawberry cheesecakes ?SO SO SOOOO YUMMY! Chocolate Nut Bar- recommendated by our waiter but everyone loved the strawberry cheesecake ?more Trio Sorbert- wasabi flavor is kinda.... strange... overall, a nice experience, it's really a 3.5 star, ?.5 star for decor and service

It is hard to give anything more than 3 stars after spending $200/person and leaving somewhat hungry. ?The decor is beautiful, and the presentation was very nice (we had Omakase) but you would expect just a little bit more for the price you pay. ?We arrived early and went to the bar. ?Same thing, beautiful bar, delicious drinks but they will cost you $14 a pop. ?In retrospect we should have not done Omakese, it was not worth it. ?There was nothing mind blowing on the 7 course "meal" except for the presentation.

I love this place, although, it seem to be very trendy and a bit expensive but if you want good food in NYC you going to be paying a little bit more than the average i loved it. it located in the meat packing district so expect the place to be crowded and it is better to have a reservation if you want to eat. There is a nice little bar down stair but the area can become very crowded very quickly. If you like raw food it the place to go too.

This is a typical overpriced rich kids hangout. ?I went here with my husband for anniversary dinner this past Saturday and sadly I was not impressed. ?Let me start off by saying I've been to restaurants where the prices far exceed the quality of food, but the service and ambiance usually more than makes up for it, sadly Morimoto's is not one of those places. Dont get me wrong there was nothing per say "wrong" with the service it was just blah, a blah waiter, blah table (sandwitched in between two other sets of couples - super dissapointing for such a huge place) and blah atmosphere (loud, obnoxious and anything but romantic). ?The food was okay, it wasnt bad by any means but for the price it was NOTHING special. Also, yelpers, kindly STOP mislabeling pictures of food, people odrer and then find out its not what they thought it would be. ?I ordered the Morimoto sashimi, expecting these nice layers of fish (as indicated by some Yelpers) and instead got a teeny tiny little plate with 5 TEENY TINY pieces of fish for $28! I could have taken regular sized sashimi or sushi for less than that!!! The torro tar tar is good, but not $31 good, and the waguy beef carpacio is also good but how much raw beef can you really eat? ?The sushi that I had (spicy tuna, spicy yellow tail and soft shell crab roll) were good, and worth the price of $8 and $12 (thats really how much sushi costs in any basic restaurant now a days anyway so that was the only part of the mean that was not overpriced). ?Finally perhaps the least delicious dish and sadly the most expensive one was my husband's waguy beef ribeye ($70) he said it was flavorless and was not cooked to his specifications (he asked for medium and got rare). ?Oh and the "sauteed vegetables" side dish he got consisted of mushrooms and corn, wtf? If you want to over dress and go have overpriced drinks/dinner with your other trust fund friends by all means this is the place for you, for those of us working for our money I suggest spending it else where (like I dunno do down the street to Alexander McQueen and buy one of those $300 scull scarfs, they will cost less than dinner for two at Morimoto's and will last a lot longer!!!).

it was a fun dining experience overall but i really wasn't impressed with the food. ?i expected more from the iron chef, but now i can say with certainty that i'd rather go to nobu. we ordered the omakase, which was supposed to represent his best dishes. although some were creative nothing really struck out as completely memorable. i agree with the yelper who said that he completely destroyed the oyster/fois gras/uni dish with teriyaki sauce. ?and the lobster dish was delicious, but the indian spices confused me...aren't we supposed to be eating japanese? ? although the dining room was beautiful, the hostess seated us in this little room off to the side surrounded by concrete walls so we couldn't enjoy the decor. finally, the service was extremely disapponting. we had at least six different servers during the nine course meal; for the first course two servers came out just as my fiance was returning from the bathroom and one of the servers (who appeared to be in training) didn't even wait for him to sit back down before explaning the dish; another militant-like server practically shouted at us as he described the course; and i could barely understand the english of at least two other servers. in fact i swear that our dessert was served by the busboy. if we're going to pay $300+ to eat at morimoto, i just expect a lot more...wouldn't you?

Here we go again, yet another "celebrity" sushi joint that just doesn't live up to the hype. ?We went twice before I wrote this review as I really wanted to give them a chance to do well. The first time we went to Morimoto's we did the omakase. ?While it was good, it did not offer the variety of Nobu or Bond Street, and it hit a sour note with an overly sweet kobe beef and sweet potato selection. ? The second time we went we decided to just order sushi. ?What a mistake. ?We ordered the $100 ?"Chef's Selection Platter" which was ?mostly made up of ho-hum items like cooked shrimp, egg, flabby eel, clam, and inedible squid. (yes the salmon, tuna, toro, and yellowtail were good, but just a bit above lesser neighborhood places.) ? We also ordered the Fugu (Blowfish) which was a 50/50 disappointment. ?The thinly sliced fish was tasteless and could very well have been fluke. ?The skin is prepared three ways, which is two ways too many. ?It has the texture of rubber bands and just about no flavor either. ?However, there was one type of skin that was very good and the deep fried bones had an excellent flavor that was a nice break from the mediocrity of the overall meal. In addition, the service had fallen way off since our 1st visit last May. ?Examples: ?They do not leave the sake at the table and several times we had to ask for a refill of our glasses (water, too) which never happens when we are at 5 star restaurants. ?Our sushi took quite a while to come out, and when it did we did not have the wasabi, ginger, and soy to eat it with; even with an apparent army of wait staff, no one seemed to know who nor how to get the items to our table. ?Lastly , when they offered us after dinner drinks to make up for the service mistakes, even that got screwed up and took until we were half way through dessert to show up. Overall: take your money and head on over to Sasabune on the UES. ?The fish is the best , the service is excellent, and after 5 visits we have never been unhappy!

went here for lunch you'll have the (extremely gorgeous) place to yourself pristine service what a bargain!!! $24 for the bento box...insanity you get miso soup, salad, lots of shrimp & veg tempura (sitting atop the best myo based sauce), pickled vegs, 1 piece of shrimp, salmon and tuna sushi, half yellowtail roll and silky roasted black cod i'm serious! so much divine food in one box (as in just a big tray with all the separate plates/bowls....not the pre-compartmentalized ones you're used to) the buri bop was another doozy! hot stone bowl comes to the table filled with rice, vegs and hamachi sashimi...at the table, the waiter pushes the sashimi again the hot walls of the bowl and it cooks up (just enough to remain silky)...then he adds soy-based sauce and mixes the whole thing up....oh my, talk about comfort food! (that came with soup and salad too! $26) we left (very) full and (very) happy and with money left to spend at chelsea market oh yea..we got a giggle that the toilet cover automatically raises and has heated seats (uh, yes duh of course we still put down paper!)

Well-designed and spacious -- the ceilings are quite interesting to look at and I liked all the shades of white, creams and light woods. The service is friendly and eager - though a bit eager at times. The Restaurant Week menu gave the choice of mixed green salad or miso soup -- the salad was standard. My friend and I both had the miso sea bass which was awesome -- light and flakey with tempura avocado, eggplant and tomato. I preferred this miso fish to the one in Nobu which was a bit too sweet. The dessert was a passionfruit panna cota which was quite tasty -- it was served in a small tumbler and I licked every bit of it. The decor is really nice -- the glass wall that the staff referred to as "the water wall" was quite cool. Even the bathrooms were nice though it's a bit sad that I got confused by all the buttons. I'm still not sure if OSCILLATE should be a toilet feature.

My good friend Tracy came in from DC this past weekend. When last we met, she and I had gone to the Rainbow Room for dinner and dancing...an absolutely marvelous evening that might never be repeated, as the NY landmark has closed its doors indefinitely. (a tragedy that should never have been allowed!) Needless to say I had a lot to live up to in planning this reunion and I wanted to celebrate with style, so I made reservations at the super stylish, super yummy sushi house called Morimoto. Downtown, under the old High Line on 10th Avenue, we arrived by towncar just in time for our 10pm reservations...pausing for a moment to reapply and confirm purrfection. Tracy and I finished up and our darling driver Kenny helped us out and sent us on our way through the largest traditional Japanese Noren curtain ever created. As luck would have it, Mr. Masaharu Morimoto was there to greet us. He was friendly, humble and welcomed us in with sincerity. It's refreshing to know that the Iron Chef hasn't let "celebrity" go to his head. The young hostess told us our table would be ready in 10 minutes and escorted us downstairs to the sexy-cool lounge area. It was packed with New Yorkers and tourists alike... and while maneuvering my way through the attractive crowd, I noticed that everyone was drinking the same martini. I asked the sassy bartender what the cloudy concoction was and she informed me of the famous White Lily...mmmm two please! You can't come to Morimoto's without ordering one of these...Gal's orders. ;) After about 20 minutes and two White Lily's later, we began to get concerned that they had forgotten us...seems impossible, I know...but all the same, Tracy and I decided to check with the manager. A tall, handsome Asian man told us it would be just a few more minutes and apologized for the wait. Time for a quick trip to the ladies room! The design of the bathroom was stunning...however on this particular Saturday night, the cleaning crew had not been doing their job. The stalls were dirty and the floor was so wet that I actually feared for my Louboutin's safety and placed some very expensive linen napkins on the floor. (a full-time bathroom attendant would cure this problem, but I have to say...I've never seen it like this before) Just as I was about to shut the stall door, a group of girls came rushing into the room, one of them was crying. A tall, young blonde was trying to speak through angry tears, "He broke up with me on a text message!" Oh Nurse... I just couldn't help myself so I did what any good woman would do. I came out of the stall and explained to the young lady that this is cause for celebration, not tears! He did her a favor and she should never take his calls again...because the little bastard will call, they always do. After a short pep talk, we all had a good laugh and the troupe of girls emerged from the ladies room feeling empowered and ready to take on Manhattan! Tracy and I sat down at the community style table and a plate with Blue Fin Tuna Pizza came within minutes...a gift to make up for the wait. A little bit of yummy, and all is forgiven! We also ordered the artful Toro Tartare, a few pieces of melt in your mouth Toro Sushi, sweet and mellow Tamago, the Crispy Rock Shrimp Tempura and of course, KEN "The Sword" Sake. (my favorite!) If that's not getting you HOT then listen to this! Across the room... a bachelorette party was in full swing...no cheesy crowns or flashing "bride" buttons...nothing tacky like that! No, they wanted nothing but class..and whats classier than twelve grown women laughing wildly and posing for photographs with a "Burt Reynolds" Blowup doll...Oh yeah! Burt Reynolds in the flesh.....or in the plastic... is there really a difference? I kid... our table loved it! In fact we bonded over the experience. Here's to us...the community table that saw too much! XO BOTTOM LINE: Gal About Town Approved! It is expensive... but worth every $100 bill...as long as you're not the one paying :) FYI: Reservations can be made a month in advance. Friendly Tip #1: Have a bottle of KEN "The Sword" Junmai Daiginjo Sake...my favorite! Friendly Tip #2: Don't miss the Toro Tartare...you'll never see another one quite like this!

I've always been a fan of Chef Morimoto's so I was delighted when some friends suggested we try it out. ?The restaurant is very austere in design, so the focus is most certainly on the food. ?I went with the omakase and the timing, presentation, service and overall ambience of the experience was simply amazing. ?The tuna tartare (there are many pics uploaded of it) and the carpaccio pizza were two standouts, starting with those two courses and ending with lobster..i have to say the "order" of the dishes was as well thought out as much as anything else. ?Perfection.

I'd probably give this half a star more. ?The ambiance of the room, the presentation of the plates, and the waitstaff were awesome. ?The bathroom was super cool too. ?The food was pretty good....but for the price and the quantity of food, I think that is what mostly brought my rating down. ?I definitely tried things that I've never tried before, which was really cool. ?Though at the same time...I very much did not care for the octopus or sardine sashimi. ?I don't remember what we had for dessert, but I wasn't blown away by it (and I'm the type to LOVE dessert...). ?I think next time we go, we'll pick and choose off the menu.

I went with a party of 6, we made reservations and were seated promptly even though we were a little late. The place is nice and all, I just felt like the seating was a little cramped since there wasn't any space in between your table and the ones next to you. We ordered a wide variety of appetizers - tempura rock shrimp, tuna pizza, morimoto sashimi and ?lobster fritters. Everything was awesome, but the rest of my party wasn't crazy about the lobster fritters which is fine because I got an extra piece! =) Our entrees ranged from toban yakis to surf and turfs to duck,duck,duck. I didn't think the duck,duck,duck was that good, one of the duck components was pretty much a sandwich. The toban yaki was very good and would recommend that again. For dessert I had the tofu hot and cold - I wasn't thrilled with it, so I wouldn't recommend it. I am still craving some more tempura rock shrimp, honestly that and a bowl of white rice would've been a complete meal for me. Will probably be back to try the omakase.

While visiting friends in NYC last May, I finally got to try Morimoto's! Decor: ?Modern, chic, cool. ?Very NYC. :) Food: ?Delicious! ?I ordered the sea bass, which came with japanese eggplant, miso, and sweet sake kasu. ?So good! ?The light crispiness of the japanese eggplant with the sweet sake kasu sauce complimented the sea bass very well. ?I think it's been one of my best meals I've had. ?I also ordered the salmon roll, which was pretty tiny! ?The sea bass portion was small but it is very good. Price: ?About $28 for the sea bass only, without tax and tip. ?Pricy, yes, but worth it. ?:) I would love to come back and try their omakase. ?I must find a way to fund my foodie adventures.

So many reviews already, but I thought I would add to it and say this is a really fun place. Sit downstairs by the bar or at the bar. The drinks are really good and the food is great! The bartenders are fun and really nice to chat with. It is pretty pricey here, but it is a really fun place to go with a great atmosphere.

I feel like I can't really give a full review on this place because I went there once and had the prix fixe menu for $120. which I can say, isn't really worth it... We totally should've just ordered from the menu, I ended up spending over $200 for myself with alcohol and tip. Not the most useful way to spend $200... but I will def be back to try the other entrees, the inside is super slick, super nice and trendy, if you got the bank roll, I'd def take a date here, it's really nice. I mean...just look at the other reviews. Just don't get the Prix Fixe!!

I did quite a bit of research on sushi joints in NY before our trip. After a lot of indecision, I decided on Morimoto. This was one of the best decisions I made concerning dining in the city. The service was impeccable. Our beverages were never empty, and every dish was fully described by whoever was serving it. The manager was even topping off my beer! It became a game to see if he could keep up. The food was some of the freshest tasting I have ever had. The Toro Tartar is outstanding. I wish I could have that for lunch every day, forever. There were four different price options for the sashimi platters, and I figured that they would be a little skimpy, considering the caliber of the place, and my usual sashimi experiences elsewhere, so I opted for the $75 platter. The 'plate', which was actually a huge bowl filled with ice, came out, and I was blown away! There were at least 10-12 different varieties of fish/seafood(including my request for some of the special cuts of the night), totaling 30-36 pieces of fish! I have been to hundreds of sushi joints, and never gotten more value for my money. The bowl was presented beautifully. We sat at the bar, so we could see it being made. There was this white kid putting our plate together, and I could see that he took great pride in what he was doing. I have only seen that dedication to presentation once before. I was more than impressed by his knife skills. Over the course of the evening, I realized that he was the only one making sashimi orders, even though there were many older chefs working there. If other kitchen staff weren't busy, they would watch this guy work. It was a treat to watch him do his thing. So for our entrees, my girl and I shared a surf and turf combo of Wagyu Beef and Yellowtail strips mixed in an avacado, cilantro, lime, tomato mix. Her cousin had the marinated Wagyu Filet. I found the fish to be very bright and refreshing. The beef from our meal I found a tad overdone and slightly tough. I had a taste of the filet, and it was perfect. It had a subtle teriyaki flavor, was ultra tender, and melted in my mouth. The decor here is cool, all the way down to the bathrooms. They are downstairs, so not good if you are handicapped. Not sure if they have an elevator. Probably my only negative, was the bartender downstairs gave me a bit of the 'I'm way too cool to talk to you', when I asked for directions to the bathroom. Other than that, the manager sported me a beer(which is ridiculously overpriced-not surprising considering it comes from Rogue Brewing), and all of the servers and chefs were great. I will have to work for six months to pay the bill, but it was worth it.

My wife and I have been to Morimoto three times and have loved every second of the experience. ?The toro tartare is my wife's favorite. ?I'm dying to go back to order off the menu as we did the omakase on the previous occasions. ?This is my favorite fine dining restaurant in the city so far...

Iron Chef Masaharu Morimoto's restaurant, creatively named...Morimoto, is a solid dinner/drink spot. ?Often forgotten, due to its age and and off the radar location, each dish is executed with thoughtful consideration to presentation, service and style. Morimoto's 12,000 square foot space, complete with draping white fabric ceilings, translucent glass bottle walls and an ultra mod bar downstairs, will make you feel far removed from the townhouse style restaurants that seem to be taking over lower Manhattan. Think the 'Jetsons go to Japan...' Be sure to make reservations in advance (2-3 weeks) if you're wanting to come during prime dinner hours. ?The serving staff is a mix of Chelsea's finest (i.e. good looking gay men that likely dance or model during the day) and are well versed in exotic ingredients and cooking techniques. I consider this place great for inventive cocktails and, albeit pricey, dinner. ?I usually get the Lotus Blossom drink with Bombay Sapphire, Yuzu and Calpico or the Morimoto Martini with Morimoto Junmai Sake, Smirnoff Vodka and Japanese Cucumber Slices ($14 each) - have two and you'll miraculously be speaking Japanese. ?I also order either a mix of appetizers and entrees to share or the Omakase, which means "chef's choice" and includes a multi-course tasting menu designed by the kitchen ($120+ per person). ?Unlike Omakease's that I have had at other restaurants, Morimoto's seems expensive for what you end up eating (other than the Toro Tartare) so I would recommend ordering a la carte. ?Try the Octopus Carpaccio with Hot Oil and Mitsuba Leaf ($16) and my ultimate favorte, the Crispy Rock Shrimp Tempura with Spicy 'Kochujan' Sauce and Wasabi A?oli ($16). ?I also like the Ishi Yaki Buri Bop as an entree, which includes Yellowtail on rice, cooked at your table in a hot stone bowl ($26). Forget the food and drinks... make sure to go to the bathroom and try out the TOTO Toilets. ?trust. me.

We were sitting at the bar watching people making sushi~ that's was fun.

Chef Morimoto should check what comes out of his kitchen. ?could not believe the quality of food there. ?ordered omakase and couple other dishes to try on, and their "iron chef" ramen! ?it is just disgusting. ?see my photo. ?it looks like they ?just brought out the left over. ?taste was horrible too. chicken stock plus salt broth and maybe 9 strings of pasta? and three small pieces of chicken... and they call it "iron chef" ramen? just unbelievable! ?will never never go back! horrible experience!

The morimoto sashimi was amazing, and I absolutely loved the drink I had - it had tequila, japanese jalapeno, etc... ?It hit the spot. ?The sushi was a bit on the salty side and the turf part of the surf and turf could have been better, but the surf side with avocado was excellent, most of the sushi was wonderful, and the flourless chocolate cake and apple desserts were very impressive for a japanese restaurant. ?The decor is great but the service was a bit choppy... ?and I would have loved a bigger cup of coffee that didn't get so cold so quick. ?Now I'm being a baby! ?The meal was wonderful.

Obviously the restaurant is beautiful. My boyfriend took me here for my birthday. We started out with drinks in the lounge. I had the White Lily, which is not the sort of thing I would normally get (I am a bourbon/rocks kind of girl---bless my soul and my liver) but it was so light and refreshing. He got the Morimotini- against my advice. Not the drink for either of us, it was a wasabi-infused martini. I don't know what he expected though. We started with a spicy tuna roll, just because we wanted to see the difference. It was of course the best ever. The tuna was of an incredible quality. Next we had the Lobster Beignets (not sure what they were called, but that's what they were). They were good, but the sauce underneath definitely carried them. I had the Duck, Duck, Duck, which was perfectly cooked. The thigh had a perfect five-spice powder coating, and the breast was succulent. The accompanying sauces (a hoisin-type and a saltier miso-based) were unnecessary, as was the fried duck egg. The bf had the Black Cod, which was perfectly cooked, but had a slightly overpowering smokiness. Not sure if it came from the tomato confit or the tempura, or the cooking method. The broth it was served in was irresistible. He had wine, and I had the sake flight, which was perfect and prevented me from developing a case of my date's tipsiness, which led to an impromptu chorus of Happy Birthday when the waiter brought out our Caramel Creme, with a candle and an artful message on the edge of the plate. The dessert was creamy and light, although it was marred by slabs of chocolate that just didn't belong. All in all, it was an elegant and romantic meal. Next time, we will have to splurge on the Omasake, which seems to be what it is all about.

Went here last night for our 2nd wedding anniversary. We did the omakase with the wine pairings. As our server told us, it would be a wonderful introduction to Morimoto. Our server Deliah was great, explained everything, checked on us often, chatty but not in an annoying way. However my only service complaint was that a number of times our food came before the wine, which is annoying if you're trying to do the pairing. But I digress, onto the food. The first course was tuna belly, amazing presentation and very tasty. Next up was oyster and foie gras, this was my least favorite dish. I found the sauce very sugary sweet and I am not a fan of foie gras anyway. Third was the salad dish micro greens with flounder, very light and fresh. Fourth was the sushi course, snapper, baracuda, hawaiian white fish, and tuna belly. Very nice presentation again and great sushi. Fifth was the surf and turf, lobster with a creme fraiche and wagyu beef with yams. This was spectacular, words can't describe. The beef was melt in your mouth good, the yams were tasty as well. The lobster is spicy but the creme fraiche cools it nicely. Last was desert, carmel, chocolate ganache over a cookie. Very nice desert. I wish I could remember all the wine pairings, there was at least one sake. You have to go to the bathroom! This is very funny. Multifunctional toilet that is heated! Hysterical, I made friends with a women in the bathroom over how amazing it is! Overall, really good experience. Good food, good service. It is a little trendy, it is in the meatpacking district after all.

The food is great but the service is not what I expected. The waitress spilt sauce on my friend's head and all over her dress and all the manager could do for her was pay got her dry cleaning. When we asked for a round is drinks the manager said "Did all of you get spilt on?" A little sarcastic and not necessary if you ask me. ?I was very disappointed with the service. I don't think I will be going back. ?You can spend the same amount of money on great food and get better service somewhere else. ?Oh well...

I came to my table as reserved at 5:30 on a Saturday; no waiting. The place was actually pretty vacant and quiet. I wore jeans and a polo shirt. I first tried Toro Tartare to test the yelp hype. I didn't know what to expect except that it's supposed to be EPIC; it wasn't. It was this tiny paste of tuna spread thin on a wooden board size of an iPhone with 4-5 garnishes to eat with: guacamole, wasabi, sea weed, etc. Not filling or especially tasty. I would not get this again even if it were half its price. Surprisingly, despite the poor comments on sushi and rolls, the wagyu sushi i tried was phenomenal. It was ridiculously expensive (~$8 for a single sushi), but it resonated well with my image of an upper-end restaurant. The spicy tuna rolls were excellent as well. For my beverage, I tried morimojito (which wasn't on the menu); i don't really know mojitos well, but I didn't like this one. We ordered few other things and at the end paid around 200 dollars. In retro-respect, I enjoyed my experience getting the pizza at Luzzo's ($20) more. My recommendation: do make reservation but don't worry about semi-formal rule. Don't just get the entree blindly because it is praised on this site. If you're going to this restaurant to experience the "iron-chef" cooking, you will probably be disappointed. However if you must satisfy your curiosity, get wagyu sushi.

We came here for lunch and i ordered the beef bento box. When it came it was literally 1 bite of beef hahahahaha. Although it was tiny it was a good tiny bite. The miso soup was the best. The tempura veggies with this sauce was out of this world. The salad was amazing. The sushi was great and I am not a fish eater. The green tea dessert was the best i ever had. Service was excellent. Cant complain but the portions were really tiny I had to order a rice bowl and split it to finally feel like I ate. haha overall pricey but great food.Oh and the drinks are amazing as well.

Yes, yes, morimoto is the iron chef/food network celebrity--but thats not why you come here. ?Come for the outstanding food and experience morimoto too has to offer. While we did try two of the main dishes (duck duck duck and sea bass) the real showstoppers are the apps and small plates. The toro tartare deserves every bit of press its gotten, the spicy crab was perfectly cooked and seasoned, and as simple as it may be, the ramen was the most delicious rich broth I've ever tasted. The tuna pizza is also fantastic. The specialty cocktails are playful and delicious, specifically the white lily martini. Put on your cocktail dress ladies, but don't expect a snobby waitstaff, everyone from the hosts to the bartenders were unpretentious and helpful. Bring your black card, with so many unique dishes you'll find yourself wanting to try everything on the menu.

My suggestion- get the tasting menu and prepare for 4 hrs of deliciousness. I went here for dinner and still rave about the meal. Quite expensive but definitely worth it... worth it! We also had the house 8 years aged Sake and a couple cocktails downstairs. All wonderful. Great attention to detail and the waitstaff was fantastic, never bringing out the next course until we were completely finished with the previous. I could see our waiter peeking around the corner to see how far we had come through each course! Wonderful meal, not soon forgotten!

The ATMOSPHERE: Breath taking. the saki bottle wall was impressive. I also love the glass cubicles. it gave each table its own space without feeling closed in. as mostly everyone has already noted, the best bathrooms around. my sister went first and made each of us try it out. needless to say all the girls left glowing. the autumn forest was very relaxing. The FOOD: to start: crispy rock shrimp tempura- perfectly cooked. extremely light and super flavorful. spicy king crab- sooo good. perfect amount of spice. ramen soup- def iron chef quality. the broth was amazing. tempura calamari salad- super tender calamari entrees: surf & turf- excellent. the filet was very tender. angry chicken- WARNINGGG my aunt accidentally ate one of the chilies and it set her mouth on fire. to the point she couldnt eat anymore. she did say she enjoyed it up until that point ha. seafood 'toban yaki'- once again the broth was out of this world. tons of seafood. we also had the chef's selection of sushi and i made a point to try them all out. it was a great experience and i was excited to try the freshest fish. to finish: the creme brulee- always a favorite with me. and 2 bottles of sparkling saki. the SERVICE: our waitress was very pleasant and made our experience relaxing and unpretentious. she was on point. it was one of the experiences where you didnt want it to end.

(not trying to over hype it) but...those damn chairs are too wide. ?i was sitting against the wall so i had to tell the person next to me to get and climb out of my chair. ?and they're heavy! ?=D

i had yuzu cocktail and morimoto aged sake, it was ok, worth to try but not too different from 6 years aged whiskey. If you have to go there I suggest to order a couple of appetizers to share.

Prices are high and the place is a "scene" but they make up for the obnoxious trendiness and prices by actually serving you GOOD food. ?Service was a little slow, if not inattentive, but I really enjoy this restaurant and encourage others to check it out. ?If you're still aprehensive, go during restaurant week so you don't feel like a sellout!

The place from the outside looks pretty interesting from that huge curtain looking thing that covers the front door. The decor is super modern and sexy. They have those crazy expensive Japanese toilets as well, which i found very cool. The food and decor are outstanding. Rock shrimp tempura, oyster foie gras, duck duck duck, surf and turf(amazing).

This is my third iron chef dining experience ?- the other two were in tokyo. ?I got to admit, the ambiance and the decor is up to my standards. ?I'm all for paying a premium for a premium experience and food. It certainly lives up to that. The sushi was what you would expect from Morimoto. It did not disappoint. The restroom sinks however were out ?of commission - that is a big f--ing deal in a sushi place. Will visit again next time I'm in NYC to try out rest of his dishes.

I was a little underwhelmed with this place. ?The decor was probably pretty trendy a few years ago, but now it's kind of old. ?The chairs and tables are a little dated now. ?As for the food, it wasn't spectacular as I had hoped. ?I ordered the taste menu Morimoto Omakase just to see what it was all about, and I left a little disappointed. My hubby ordered the "toro tartare" and the "duck, duck, duck" as his main course. ?I think the Chinese roast duck for less than $10 is better. ?Overall, it wasn't bad, but for the price I can definitely find better Japanese cuisine. ?In matter a fact, there's many better place in my home town Chicago.

Morimotos has some of the best modern asian food I have ever had. The tartar tuna app was a beautiful dish that was fun to eat with the many steps and dips you can take. The two ways shrimp was killer, I am not a fan of shrimp for the most part but this dish made me a believer that I can truly enjoy shrimp. The tofu dish was an awesome presentation of suspense as you cant peak while the tofu is being made at your table. while the dish was delicious the whole experience of the dish is what made is spectacular. We then indulged in some sushi which was nothing fancy like the rest of the meals. I would recommend sticking to the main courses and apps as the sushi was good quality but nothing special. Finally the desserts made me a forever fan!! If you have the deep pockets for a wonderful dinner experience hit up Morimotos next chance you get.

The place is stunning, certainly one of the most beautiful restaurants in Manhattan in my opinion, but I have to say I was a little disappointed with the food, it was just very good traditional Japanese food... no innovation, no complexity, no creativity... not what I expected from an iron chef.

Tired from walking up and down Rockefeller and Chinatown we arrive at the Morimoto entrance. I stop and question my girlfriend, "this is the place? I guess so." Covering the entrance are reddish-orange drapes as if they were concealing a masterpiece of art. We see people inside and as we get closer, the glass sliding doors open. I immediately feel like I'm in some sort of futuristic movie, and another set of glass sliding doors open up. We are half an hour early for our reservation but the hostess quickly takes our coats and takes us to our seats. As we walk to our table and I glance around the restaurant. The decor is definitely a new-age type fusion and everything about it from the chairs to the exit signs screams, "I'm new, hip and stylish." The restaurant was dimly lit with some orange, red and blue soft lighting scattered throughout. The walls and ceiling where white and the separating glass had a foggy white tint. The tables were pine as well as the chairs, which were kind of boxy. The padding on the chairs was also white and very comfortable, almost as if it was at some sort of hookah bar or Amsterdam coffee shop. ? Without even a chance to catch my breath (keep in mind we had walked several hours before arriving) our server Freddie approached us and offered us something to drink other than water, as he filled our glasses. I asked him to give us a little time and went to wash my hands in the rest room. The door to the restroom slid open using a single handle bar and located on the wall was the lock button. By pressing the button the door would lock and an occupied sign would be lit from the outside. The restrooms were super clean and looked like something out of the Jetsons. You had to slide the door to go in, and to lock the door you pressed a button that lit up. Freddie was really friendly and always eager to help answer any questions we may have. He recommended a pear-flavored sake called Ginjo, which we decided to order. He brought it out in a dark stone looking ceramic bucket filled with ice. The sake container was glass that looked like a cross between a beaker and a piece of bamboo. The sake was very smooth, and we were both very pleased. Now having some time to take in the whole restaurant I notice that the music was a tad bit too loud. Playing through the speakers was lounge/trip hop/down tempo style music, giving a cool relax feeling. The atmosphere of the restaurant gave a sense of serenity and tranquility to customers, servers, and even to the ma?tre d. Still undecided on what to eat Freddie recommend to us the Chef's choice, a 7 coarse dinner. I told him we had to think about it for a while. The menu was relatively clear, simple, and most likely type up that same day. I was a little lost trying to look through it since the spacing between the texts was small. I mentioned we had a jazz performance to catch at 9pm and he said we'd have plenty of time, and that if we felt like eating quickly he would bring out the dishes faster. We decided to go with the 7 coarse dinner. Without letting my sake cup get to low he kindly refilled it without intruding too much. The first course was quickly brought out and Freddie began explaining the contents of our artfully designed dish. It was a tuna tartar spread over a centimeter deep 4x3 inch box. In the center of the dish was a quarter size dab of caviar with the bottom of the box containing a rainbow of dark colors and flavors (wasabi paste, sour-cream, seaweed paste, chopped chives, avocado paste, and crunchy rice balls). Freddie then proceeded to explain how to eat the dish. He said to take the little scrapper and scoop the tuna with a little bit of the caviar and dip it in the sauce, then play with the different flavors. The next 6 course where presented to us in a similar fashion. A couple of times I had to ask the server or food runner to repeat the explanation since I wasn't able to hear over the music. The second dish contained a thinly sliced white fish with mushrooms; slivers of beets and pea shoot leaves. The third was a fondue style dish with a bread tasting, duck sausage ball, baby carrot, fennel, grape tomato, mini bell pepper and radish. The dipping sauce was sesame oil with a miso paste. The candle keeping the sauce warm was a little too close in my opinion and made the oil too hot. The fourth dish was a baked oyster with froi gras and uni drizzled with oyster sauce, this was my girlfriend's favorite dish. The fifth dish was a traditional sushi platter with 4 different types of fish and piece of raw squid. Following the sushi was a nice, light, refreshing house made ginger ale, which they said was our intermission. Our sixth course was a play on the American surf and turf. A delicious grilled piece of lobster trail, which would have been twice as good had they lightened up on the spices, and a flash grilled piece of Kobe beef with some glazed sweet potatoes. ...ran out of space, my Gastronomy paper was longer than i thought, LOL.

my husband and i ordered the morimoto omikase, the chef's tasting menu ($120 per person). ?we normally don't spend that much money on food but we ordered it b/c it was a special occasion. ? it is a 7 course meal starting with tuna tar tar. ?i've heard about their tuna tar tar and was so looking forward to eating it. ?presentation was very interesting, so i wasn't disappointed but the taste was just ok. ?the tuna was little bit warm for my taste which made it little bit fishy. ?i am a huge seafood lover and i don't mind fishy taste but this left little bit more fishy taste than i am used to. one of the best dish was the main course, wagyu beef and lobster. ?the beef was so tender and tasty. ?it came with the sweet potato glazed in corn syrup (?). ?that sweet potato was my favorite of the night. ?i know.. it sounds sad but that's my honest opinion. before the main course they brought out intermezzo, home-made gingerale. ?that was actually really good too. ?it left a spicy after taste from ginger and it was quiet refreshing. ?it also had a tangy taste probably from lemon they added. ?it came in a very small portion but it was perfect b/c it was very sweet. next we go there, i would like to try their chef's raw menu ($70-120 per person).

Morimoto was definitely an interesting experience!! ?The food and drinks were outstanding but the service was unfortunately quite pretentious. ?Amazing space and ambiance...Japanese toilets are something to be experienced. ?The omakase offers great variety across the menu. ?The fatty tuna is outstanding the the wagyu beef was 'melt in your mouth' good. ?The Hydragena and White Lily martinis were very nice. ?Best part was when Morimoto came out from the kitchen for photos...pretty cool!!!

I didn't try the tasting menu that Morimoto suggests in order to get the true feel of the place, but what I did have did not blow me away and I wouldn't recommend this place for the price. While everything was fresh and the sushi roll was very good, the main dishes were a bit bland and unexciting.

If you have the money and an obsession with fine dining, I'd recommend this place. A good balance of fusion and traditional. Everything is fresh (considering you're paying a fortune) and the flavors are all subtle but rich in quality. The Japanese style steak was very good as well as the appetizer with the three different kin of roes that you scoop and eat like a tartine.

We went last night to Morimoto and we had a wonderful time but as far as the overall rating I give it a three for several reasons. ?The atmosphere is fabulous the design and lighting is wonderful as well as the presentation, however the food was not all that impressive. ?For a chef his level I certainly expected more interesting flavors in the Omakase tasting menu which my friend and I both did. ? Like I mentioned the presentation is 5 stars but I'm really more concerned with the taste and flavors. ?I did enjoy several of the courses but some of them were really kind of boring. ?I won't be going back there are too many high end Japanese places in NYC to go to.

Wonderful experience.... completely worth the price. I don't have anything bad to say, good food, artfully presented, beautiful decor, amazing service... very accommodating without hovering too much. For an upscale restaurant, I was expecting "elf food" but the portions are large, an entree dish can easily be shared. Even an appetizer is filling. I recommend the Tuna Toro... beautifully presented, fun to eat and very flavorful. I'd skip the $20 bottle of "Morimoto" beer. Though it was good, crisp, light and refreshing. If you're into beer then go for it otherwise spend that 20 bucks toward an appetizer/dessert.

A friend and I decided to come here for Restaurant Week. ?This being a restaurant of Iron Chef Morimoto, I had extremely high expectations coming in. ?We both ordered the creamy crab croquettes for the appetizer and they were great. Delicious, fried just enough and not dry by any means. ?Nothing to complain about there. ?For the entree, I ordered the cod "fishwich" and my friend had the beef gyu-don. ?I'll start with the gyu-don. The portion was HUGE and it smelled great, but its nothing special. It doesn't have anything that sets itself apart from some of the other beef donburis I've had. Still, it was good and you couldn't go wrong with the large portion. ?My cod fishwich was just a fish sandwich served with tartar sauce on the side. ?The fishwich was tiny in comparison to the donburi. ?It would've have been better if it was a slightly larger portion. ?The sandwich itself was again, nothing special. ?Without the tartar sauce, it lacked flavor. ?The tartar sauce however was a bit too creamy, but it did save the fishwich and made it a bit more flavorful. ?The panna cotta dessert was great. ?I usually find white chocolate to be too sweet for me, but the white chocolate here was surprisingly balanced. ?I enjoyed the panna cotta very much and it along with the crab croquettes were the highlight of the meal. The service was also a bit lackluster. ?Granted we went at around 1pm so it was a busy lunch hour, but even so, the server wasn't around as often as I would have expected from a higher end restaurant such as Morimoto. On a high note, the bathroom is quite nice. Definitely something to check out while dining here. ?Overall, I feel Morimoto is over-hyped. ?Would I come back for a dinner experience? Maybe, but it certainly wouldn't be at the top of my list of places to go.

Spouse and cousin were big fans. Me, not so. I had been to the one in Philly too prior to this visit and still the verdict's so-so. Spouse and I brought my cousin from out of state here for a nice pre-wedding celebratory dinner. Hostess was nice, but as expected, stiff and perfunctory in her mannerisms, probably because we looked young and penniless. We were seated quickly (had reservations) and waiter was prompt and friendly. We had the Yosedofu which was nice and creamy (as before in Philly) and although simple, it was nicely complemented by the shoyu-ginger-wasabi sauce on the side. I think I had some grilled or baked salmon entree that's no longer on the menu (this visit was back in '09) which was rather dry and clearly forgettable (seeing as how I don't remember the name of the dish). Spouse had the Black Miso Cod which was cooked to perfection, soft and flaky (I'm reporting here). However, by the nth mouthful, the salt began to kick in and I was told that it was decreasing marginal utility towards the end. Cousin had the Chilean Sea Bass I think ( I could be wrong- it was a thick fish fillet that came in a bowl, rather than a plate) and again, it was cooked to flaky, sweet perfection. Her's was a tad salty too, but nevertheless, distinct enough to remember. Overall, I think the entrees had good and different flavors (except mine) but I wouldn't go so far as to say that the flavors were unique or out of this world. We asked for the yummy Cherry Blossom ice cream that spouse and I had in Philly, but it wasn't available that season. We had their dessert du jour which was some apple martini ice cream thing that the spouse, cousin (and I?) found very yummy. Maybe I've just got cheapo taste but overall I don't really remember all the flavors (except my cousin's fish dish which was pretty good). I would recommend having fish there though (not the baked or grilled kind) because they really know how to cook their fish without over or under- doing it. The bill was close to $200 for 3 people and I think we ate 3 entrees, 1 app and 1 dessert, but it's Morimoto, so that's par for the course. Would only probably go there for a special occasion or to bring someone from out of town there for the experience, but I wouldn't go there because of the food (a bit paradoxical I know... but hey, I am the queen of cheap....) Plus: attentive waitstaff. Cousin spilled a drink and as if on cue 3 or 4 different bus boys/waitstaff descended on our table in a concerted, efficient fashion and got it cleaned up in 10 seconds flat. Neg- food's over hyped

It has all the glitz of a really upscale restaurant (where you're usually like, did I really just pay all this for that small piece of food... guess I'm going for pizza after this.), but literally everything I have tried on the menu, minus the deserts, are AWESOME! Favorites: Spicy King Crab and Tuna Pizza. Our service has always been great - very knowledgeable an friendly. Also do not visit w/o checking out the bathrooms.

Morimoto's NYC has good food and an awesome decor. The restaurant is uber contemporary and the service is impeccable. Must haves: 1) Toro tartare - Extremely crisp and refreshing appetizer served with caviar and an assortment of sauces. Got to love the mountain berry pallet cleanser 2) Sea bass - Sweet, salty, with a texture that just melts in your mouth Can live without: 1) Uni - Did not taste very fresh. They stated that it was flown in from California, but the texture was very gooey and not firm. 2) Kobe beef carpaccio - Tasted like your typical carpaccio. Nothing special. For some reason, I like the Morimoto's in Philadelphia better. It has a very similar decor, but the food is a little more edgy and fresh there. All in all... you can't go wrong with a Masaharu Morimoto restaurant!

This review is about the Vegetarian menu (or lack thereof) only. Morimoto being my favorite Iron Chef, I couldn't wait to actually try his food on a recent Monday night at 8:30 in NYC. ?I'm beating a fast retreat back to nobu (where I've previously had a fantastic vegetarian omakase tasting menu). My friend went for the Omakase tasting menu (reported that 5 of 7 courses were amazing, the 6th (the Waygu beef + lobster) was good but not to the level of the other courses and the dessert course, was the same. First bad sign for me, the server says "no way that the kitchen could come up with a vegetarian omakase". ?Unbelievable. ?This is Chef Morimoto and NYC and it's Japanese cuisine, for goodness sake. ? Second, the server then recommends ordering 4 courses to keep pace with the omakase menu. ? Which didn't really work because 1) the food at our table came out at all different times, i.e., rarely were we eating at the same time; 2) the portions for my "regular" dishes (vs. the omakase portions) were "normal" and therefore, I was stuffed by the second course (in retrospect, not a surprise since most people normally have 2 courses + dessert) and I basically felt like I was advised to order more food than necessary. Here's the breakdown. ?First course was kappa maki and avocado maki - unremarkable. ?Second course was Soba noodles. ?Noodles were good but I've had better in SF, and it was funny to be instructed on "how" to eat them. ?Third course was the Yuzu Dofu, which is made at the table. ?Good, but served with the lobster sauce, which seemed strange since I had asked for the vegetarian omakase. ?Fourth Course was the Bop (like a Dol Sot bi-bim-bop, but without all of the vegetables and the chili sauce). ?This dish was actually very good. ?Wish I'd gone with this one to the exclusion of the other dishes. ?Also, by this point, had filled up on the rather uninspiring courses 1-3 so could not finish the Bop. In closing? ?Go for the omakase tasting menu but leave your vegetarian loved ones at home. ?Service and inflexibility of the kitchen leaves impression that they are catering to tourists with little knowledge re Asian food (i.e., the instructions given re how to eat soba noodles) and the kitchen is operating per a set protocol, i.e., they lack the talent or confidence to improvise.

The food was decent but not amazing. I can think of better sushi, sashimi, and raw oysters in other places. The experience was decent but you feel a rush in the service. Do not have super high expectation because of the iron chef name and price. But I have to say that the combination of menu innovation and cuisine blends is unique and not available anywhere else.

The food was good, but nothing like the Omakase I had in Philadelphia. ?Service was definitely lacking. ?What is it with New York service. ?It's ridicuously good or wait staffs just doesn't care. I won't go back to this Morimoto.

I was totally looking forward to eating here! The space is definitely impressive and my Hydrangea cocktail was delicious. However, the food was meh and the tiny size of the portions for the price was laughable. There are tons of better places in nyc to eat that have impressive decor, better food, more realistic prices and prettier people watching... I'd pass on this place. .

my absolute favorite sushi place ever. ?the atmosphere is amazing here and the food is delicious. ?the rock shrimp tempura is my favorite. it comes with 2 different sauces, one is a wasabi sauce and the other is spicy mayo. ?they're both so delicious. i also love the spicy king crab appetizer and the toro sashimi, which is beautifully and artfully presented. i usually just get the get the sashmi platter as an entree because their fish is so fresh. ?it's a go-to, never fails. the service here is also amazing, i went for my bday and my server was a girl named kana. she was so helpful and adorable and even brought us ?their special holiday dessert, which was candycane icecream (!) with rice krispie treat rings. ?i don't usually like sweets but it was just so creative and very sweet of kana to bring it out for us. ?hands down best sushi place in nyc.

One of my favorite restaurants.....maybe, because of the wagyu shabu shabu, which is a bit pricey, but one of the most amazing culinary experiences I have had. ?The thinly sliced meat is served on a silver platter with a hot pot of broth. ?The meat simply melts in your mouth and leaves you with a wonderful feeling. Morimoto's homemade sake was also a treat. We tried the jalopeno, which may have been stronger than most sake, because it made me a bit tipsy. Black miso cod was cooked perfectly, delicately seasoned and tasted clean and fresh. We have been a few times and tried both the tasting and ordering off of the main menu. ?I would actually opt for the shabu shabu with a few other dishes, because it is well worth the money. Reservations required, although we visited one time on a Sunday late afternoon and there were not many people. Bathrooms are fun and include some type of washlet. Tables and chairs are quite comfortable even though they look as though they might be too trendy to be comfortable. I would recommend this restaurant.

Morimoto's restaurant is fantastic. ?From the outside it appears to be a traditional Japanese restaurant, however, upon walking into the place you can see this place is totally modern and gorgeous. ?One of the nicest looking restaurants I've ever seen. ?The food is done to the tee. ?Delicious, well prepared, and excellent presentation. ?Service was excellent. ?Check out the bathrooms, I could write a whole review on how nutz the bathrooms alone were. ?I can't wait to go back again, the place really made an impression on me.

Oh heavenly tuna pizza. Order that and the rock shrimp appetizers, then who needs the sushi, although it is quite good as well. Very fresh, and simple, but in a perfect way. At lunch random tourists come in just to use the bathrooms, it's kind of weird, but overall nice atmosphere.

Morimoto's my fav Iron Chef, so I have to visit his restaurant when I was in NYC. The food is good and the presentation is very creative. However, the tasting menu just wasn't exceptional enough to deserve a 5 star rating. Guess I had too high expectations from watching his Iron Chef creations on TV. The restaurant was too noisy and dampen the dining experience slightly. Will still like to try his Philadelphia restaurant if I have a chance.

It was a disappointment for us. We travelled to NYC for family vacation and wanted to experience " iron chef" quality Japaness cusine. I guess living in the Bay Area in california has it's down side.. we have the best of Japaness restaurants in the US, ( correction- best authentic Japaness food) Starting off with the restroom, it was smelly and lack of maintence when I was there. The service was OK, nothing spectacular. Our waiter kept coming asking if we wanted to order more " filtered water".... The appetizers are the best part, unfortunately. My son ordered his favorate sushi, Salmon, Hamachi, AmaEbi and tuna. The quality of the raw is good, however, the most basic technique about Japaness sushi, which is the rice is horrible. The texture and taste are like sushi rice from Costco... I wish I had better things to say since we are fans of Chef Morimoto. However, I think this location needs to have a better manager.

Three stars is A-OK, but based on the hype and the price-- it was so-so. For appetizers we had the Morimoto Sashimi, and the sauces were the first disappointment; not so tasty but interesting packaging, and the Gyozo was next-- a fresh pork flavor but small and not bursting with flavor-- friends have done better at home, The Duck, Duck Duck was tough, tough, tough and cheap Chinese restaurants do Peking Duck much better-- as this is how it was described by the waiter. Finally the Seafood Toban Yaki, salty and unmemorable. Starr has the better restaurants in Philly-- so I expected much better.

Definitely a great experience and delicious food, with a few small drawbacks. ?I really, really enjoyed my 20 ounce Wagyu Ribeye, it was probably the best steak I have eaten. ?It arrived at the table sizzling and crackling and was promptly bathed in the signature Morimoto sauce by the waiter. ?It did cost $70, but I think it was worth it. ?Sushi was also very good, the tuna was a deep red and Delicious. ? Now for the drawbacks, #1 - The chicken ramen, really not what I expected, it was fine, but absolutely nothing special. True ramen fanatics would hate it. ?The Morimoto in Philly has pork belly ramen that is excellent!, I was surprised by the bowl I got in NYC #2 - Waiting 1/2 hour for the table when we had a reservation #3 - Paying $5 for a la carte rice, not really necessary.

was really looking forward to this place. but of course, like most "name brand" restaurants, somewhat disappointed. ? hostess seems pretty accommodating and friendly, however that's it. ?the wait staff is a bit lack lustered. ?they don't seem like they want to be there. ?bartender looked tired and somewhat uninterested, although was trying to serve us. ?our waiter was a bit pushy and didn't check back on us because we didn't order the pre-fix menu like he suggested. ?we were left with food that came but without condiments. ?the bus boys were quick to clear the dishes and tried to help us but our little waiter with the curly hair and glasses were hard to get a hold off after a while. ? decor is interesting. ?price is not cheap, food quality is pretty good and fresh but small in proportion. ?all in all, nothing i can really remember. ?have to say if they made it up in the service, it would be something, but unfortunately, no.

Power was out when we arrive and had been for 3 hours, so my experience was less than typical. ?With that said the poor service from our server did not help make up for things. ?Somehow they got the power on and started cranking out food. ?I don't remember many specifics as it was some time ago, but among the top sushi places I've enjoyed. ?Very creative rolls and presentations for the fish. ?Drinks were a bit highly priced, but in line with the neighborhood and city. ?I guess this could be a 5-star, but for such a famous chef, and the location in New York, I expected a truly enlightening experience. ?I guess I'm a little salty from the lack of service. ?If it makes a difference, we were in the lounge area downstairs. Maybe there better servers are upstairs in restaurant?

Lots of great reviews on the restaurant by others, here in Yelp-land. ? I am rating this solely for the bar downstairs in this review.... The Morimoto bar/lounge is one of my favorites in the city after only one visit. ?Absolutely stellar, stellar cocktails. ?One of my favorite cocktail ingredients is ginger and I will always sample one if it's on the list. ?Sadly, I don't remember the name (I will update this review next time I go) but Morimoto has the best ginger cocktail in this city that I've found. ?It was basically a concotion with a little juice, lots of alcohol and lots of ginger but the overall result is delicious and balanced. ?The feel at the bar BEFORE dinner, is very cool.. quiet, chic and not overdone. ?I saw Bobby Flay eating his dinner and drinking cocktails at the bar after I was finished with dinner and visiting that jaw-dropping ladies room. ?It's always good when chefs like the mixologist below the kitchen too.

Ambiance was perfect with a shade on the darker side to add to the overall dining experience. Everyone recommended the omakase as the first dining experience at Morimoto but decided to order individual dishes since the whole table didn't want omakase. The toro tartare and the oyster foie gras were excellent choices. Very rich and tasty. The favors were immediately noticed after each bite. The clam miso soup was a bit on the salty side and not similar to the traditional miso base as you would find in Japanese sushi bars/restaurants. Chef's sushi combo at $40 was enough for 2 people, which included nigiri tuna, salmon, hamachi, eel, shrimp, and included spicy tuna roll. The spicy king crab legs was a bit rich on the spice sauce but the crab meat portion was generous. The wagyu beef carpaccio was disappointing. It wasn't spectacular and anticipated too much hype especially for such a delicate item such as wagyu beef. I guess I was expecting too much on the traditional side. Overall a great dining experience and the attention to detail was noticeable.

The place is very trendy and you notice this from the moment you walk through the entrance all the way to the very surreal bathroom experience..the food was delicious!! the service was also great, everyone i dealt with was always offering help or explanations on the food items, superb! for drinks my girlfriend had the white lily which was very good but for me a bit too sweet, i had the morimotini which was nice and stiff...we went with the recommended dishes like toro tartare which came in a very unique presentation and very interesting dipping options like crem fresche to black seaweed paste all good, rock shrimp tempura was also very tasty.for the mains we had the surf and turf --filet was very tender and seasoned right albeit a tad on the small side and the hamachi salad was also very good. my date opted for a sashimi combo with 2 additional rolls one including the soft shell crab roll which is just huge!!i agree with other reviewers that sushi isnt the best in the city but is still fresh and worth the price..for dessert we had the pineapple bread pudding w/ caramel ice cream, also very good.had to take a trip to the bathroom and after walking in the ladies room by accident b/c the doors are a bit confusing the toilets are very nice and i had this feeling like you're in the middle of a forest or something.after reading other reviews i was prepared to leave hungry and is why we ordered 2 extra rolls, but all i have to say is that i was stuffed and im a big eater.bill was about 100 per person not incl tip and was worth every penny.

I had an awesome experience at Morimoto. ?We went there for dinner with an expense account last night...so yes, we were able to order whatever we wanted to. ?The three of us started with Kumamoto Oysters...despite the fact that I'm really not a big oyster fan, I thought they were super good. ?We also got the lobster fritters and steamed scallops as appetizers. ?The lobster fritters were SOOOOO good. ?The cocktails were original and pretty strong. ?I got the White Lily - super yummy, as well as the Lightening Thunder. ?For entrees, we got the surf and turf...the lobster was to die for. ?The kobe NY strip was pretty good too. ?Our server was very friendly...and was very attentive. ?He kept on cracking jokes at us...(I think he was totally hitting on my coworker). ?Whatever his intentions were, the service was excellent. ?I took 1 star away because the desserts were kinda disappointing. ?For one thing, nothing seemed too authentic...we got the creme brulee, cheesecake and the pecan pie, and none of it was really "japanese". ?We concluded our night there with a tour of the restaurant. ?We half jokingly asked our server if we could get a tour of the establishment, and he got the manager (Kevin) to give us a tour. ?I have an entire different appreciation of the establishment after the tour. ?Everything there was a masterpiece. ?From the resin bar top downstairs to the wall made out of water bottles that stands two storey high!

Overall the decor here is amazing, especially the bathrooms. ?The $5,000 toilet which squirts you every which way and was even accompanied with a drier. ?The food, I would say is overpriced. ?We had some kind of tuna pizza which was very average which our waiter recommended. ?The Toro tuna appetizer was amazing though. ?The presentation was spectacular. ?The tuna was in a little box turned on the side and you dipped it in 5 different types of sauces. ?Very tasty. ?We ordere a bottle of Sake which was nice and there was nothing on the menu less then $80 a bottle! ?I ordered a $100 bottle because I wanted something good. ?It was very nice but not worth the $100. ?We then had all different types of sushi which was recommended from the Sushi chef there. ?The Salmon we ordered was a little chewy. ?A few types of fish were good but not extravagant. ?They charge you by piece not by 2 per order so it adds up quickly. ?He made us some type of japanese mushroom which was really tasty. ? We had the o-toro which was nice but nothing better then what I can get in San Francisco at my favorite places. ?Overall$300 for 2 people is definitely overpriced. ?You're paying for the decor here rather then the food.

Went to Morimoto this weekend with my wife and a good friend for the first time. Have been meaning to go for some time. It looks so mysterious from the outside with the hanging curtains and the super sleek James Bond interior. Well the wait was worth it. The food was excellent and the interior truly beautiful. After dinner, my friend informed me that Opentable reservations don't get the best seats so next time I'll call instead because we were put in a side area of the restaurant that was not as aesthetically pleasing as the rest of it. In fact when we came in we went downstairs to the bar to wait for our friend and I could have stayed there over the table we were given. Much cooler at the bar. Very romantic sexy vibe down there and you can order items off the menu. Not the full menu but rolls and other delicious foodstuffs. Our server was well informed and helpful with the menu, but the runners brought the wrong thing to our table twice. Not sure if it was a first day on the job kind of thing or if there is normally a lot of confusion as to which table ordered what, but we had a great time and will definitely be going back! Probably just for a drink and some rolls at the bar as that area for me was the coolest part of the restaurant. Domo Arigoto Mr. Mormimoto!

This is leaps and bounds better than the Morimoto in Philly! It's a great experience if you can find the place. The exterior is understated but inside is a different world. It's beautiful and modern with open spaces that are separated by clear glass panes or with sparking dividers. The furniture is contemporary and white is the predominant color. One might think the lighting would be harsh but it glows softly, as if by candlelight. There are stairs just beyond the entrance to a basement below with a sleek bar and comfy seats for lounging. The menu is much more diverse than the one in Philly. As always my friends and I ordered a bunch of small plates for sharing: Wagyu carpaccio with microgreens- I needed to try one item that I had in Philly, as a benchmark for comparison. The portions are definitely more generous in Philly, but taste and quality were fantastic and the presentation was beautiful. I don't remember if the price reflects the quantity. Toro tartare with a gorgeous rainbow of accoutrements incliding wasabi, creame fraiche, caviar and a soy based sauce. The different condiments were fun to try and they changed the flavor experience of the tartare. Most creative toro tartare I've had. Braised black cod is always a great dish and this fish was so luxuriously silky soft it nearly dissolved on contact. Outstanding, and I generally prefer seared for that sweet caramelized skin. Morimoto sashimi- this looks like a mini sashimi terrine and is another aesthetic and gustatory triumph. There are layers of different fish sashimi including toro, salmon, tuna, hamachi and eel. It's sliced into six bite sized portions and each is topped with a different garnish. Unfortunately the sashimi wasn't good at all. It was quite shocking for a high class Japenese restaurant with an Iron Chef at the helm. Another Morimoto restaurant where the hot dishes outshine the sashimi. One full star deducted for this glaring faux pas.

Excellent decor and service - very good food. ?We ordered some traditional japanese dishes as well as some nouveau ones. ?My recommendation would be to go early (they sometimes run out of popular dishes) and order about 3 or 4 starters in lieu of an entree. ?BTW, I had Chirashi as my main. ?It was great but it could have fed my family of 4! ?I sadly left half untouched.

The toilet is amazing! It is heated, vibrates, washes & dries. ?I can't justify paying for the most expensive meal I've ever eaten on the bathroom however. ?I had the tasting menu, the chef's best...not impressed. ? ?The waitress made a great sale on choosing the tasting menu instead of ordering a la carte and then was no where to be found after that. Water glasses went unfilled, drinks not replenished. ?When a glass ?was spilled at our table we cleaned it ?up. Nobody ever replaced our soaked napkins. ?Numerous courses were served without giving us the utencils to eat it with, the service is sub par.

every time i've been here the service has been excellent .. upscale but not snobby and most helpful and knowledgeable about the menu, the staff helps make this a true dining experience by allowing you to take your time and never rushing you out the door on one occasion i met the iron chef himself and he was most hospitable .. very cute bopping around in his blue jeans taking pictures with many diners the food is insanely good - i recommend the black cod, cooked in a very unique way at the table. in fact, all of the presentation is fabulous and unmatched everything i've tried here has been fabulous and unlike anything i've ever seen or tasted

We tried this place during restaurant week and were greatly disappointed by the food. ?Having graced similar establishments such as Nobu and Bond Street, we were expecting something of a similar caliber; we were no less than shocked to receive overly salty, unoriginal, wannabe high-end Japanese food that missed the mark completely. ?The service by the waiter was fantastic - the restaurant's only redeeming quality apart from the wonderful decor and ambiance. ?(The hosts were somewhat disorganized.) ?Even the dessert was non-descript - a few tiny pieces of candy and generic pastry. ?There are so many wonderful restaurants in New York that serve innovative and delicious Japanese cuisine (in decent portions, unlike here) that there will never be a need to return here again.

We drove to NYC specifically to go to the restaurant and I was highly disappointed. I could not believe one of my favorite Iron Chef's owns the restaurant. To start our server was very snobby. She was a better salesperson then a server. I got the sampler feast that they have for $120 and it was by far the worst thing I could have done. I gave the restaurant two stars because at least the TORO TARTAR is out of this world. Other than the Toro the other dishes were practically not edible. Everything was so bland and lacked any personality. They had a very under dressed fennel salad. Some sushi rolls came out and they were tiny and practically all rice. I thought Morimoto was the king of sushi. I bet he would have never served sushi like that to anyone yet his chefs are. The main coarse was their version of a surf and turf. I asked for the steak to be cooked medium rare and I was told it came with a half 2 pound lobster . When the main dish arrived the steak was as thin as a slice of roast beef and it was so small when they seared it on both sides it came out well done. The lobster was definately not half of even a one pound lobster to start out with. The only thing left was the tail and they blackened the lobster. The tail was like eating rubber. I am from New England originally and it was by far the worst lobster I have ever ate. The Server never asked me how anything was and runners kept bringing out the food. As soon as the last plate came out someone brought out are check not asking if we wanted anything else. ?The server basically thought we were insane for not enjoying the meal and pretty much thought we didn't know anything about food. After spending $120 on my meal alone I went to the closest pizza stand and bought a dollar slice of pizza and was far happier. I could have saved $119. I keep on telling myself maybe I just went there on an off night but it will be hard for me to go back when there are so many better restaurants in NYC

Maybe my expectatons were too high? We've arrived to the restaurant at 7pm and waited 30min to be seated for a reso that we made 2 weeks prior. We looked at the menu and we figured, hey lets just do omakase it's Morimoto right? Don't get me wrong the food was good, but when you go to any japanese restaurant and you ask for omakase you typically get something special. At Morimoto $450 after we arrived we felt like our local sushi place would have gave us the same satisfation for a third of the price. I know it is the name and the service that you pay extra for, however what received was nothing out of the ordinary. It was good, but severely overpriced. I was just expecting something different, but it was just ordinary well made sushi.

as though this place needs one more review in addition to the 400+ already floating around, but hey, i figure i'll put in my 2 cents. first thing i notice when i walk in? glass walls everywhere. as i sat down i realized what a wonderful idea it was - it offers tables privacy without making the room feel small and clausterphobic. the menu. kind of intimidating, but sit down and go line by line and you're sure to find something you'll love and i loved everything i had. soft shell crab roll - sounds simple enough but i've seen many restaurants butcher this, and it's refreshing to see it done well here. a wonderful deep-fried soft crab that plays well with the crunchy asparagus and the mildly spicy sauce. seafood toban yaki - a seafood lover's dream! (aka me.) a platter of an array of fresh seafood, including lobster, crab, mussels and clams in a nice, warm, savory miso broth. our server said it pairs well with rice, but for those watching their carb intake, i can definitely say that this platter will fill you up without a side of rice. this is one of the pricier things on the menu, but well worth it - you're not shorted on quality (or quantity) warm chocolate cake - possibly the highlight of my meal (or maybe because it came out last?). a delicately baked piece of chocolate cake with molten chocolate inside, crisply paired with a green tea ice cream resting on a bed of red bean. not to be missed is the coconut jelly on the side, plays nicely with the ice cream and cake. other favorites at the table included the duck duck duck and the dessert of the day, which was a light strawberry cheesecake paired with a berry sorbet and (surprise!) pop rocks. overall, a fantastic experience. trendy ambiance, knowledgeable servers (who make you feel comfortable and not like you're some rif raf if you don't know what's what on the menu), and a delightful blend of flavors in every plate makes morimoto a favorite in my book. will definitely have to come back soon.

this review pains me. ?My "bucket list" is to eat all every iron chef's restaurant. ?Morimoto's was a let down. we spent over 200 bucks here and felt like we would have been more satisfied at a hole in the wall sushi place. ?The toro tartare was meh. ?The fish was ?small serving and tasted fresh and the "sauces" did enhance the flavor but it wasn't work 30 bucks. ?We also got the lobster frittatas. ?They were tiny but when you bit into one the ginger flavor bursted out! Very good! The oyster with foie gras was all about the sauce. ?Not worth the money although tasty. ?I ended getting the sashimi salad thinking it will be a variety of fish but it was just tuna tartare. Our friend got the surf and turf and it was tiny! the fingerling potatoes had no flavor (just boiled?) but the steak was all sorts of juicy goodness! ?It was good but it wasn't top chef quality or worth the money in my eyes.

I had read mixed reviews on Morimoto before so I really didn't go in having high expectation, but still Morimoto disappointed me on so many levels. Sigh. My boyfriend and I, decided to go with the Omakase since there was so many choices and we didn't know what was good or not and plus the waitress recommended us to go with the Omakase which is a "chef's choice of multi-course (8 to be exact) tasting menu designed to allow you to experience the essence of Morimoto cuisine" Let's just say out of the 8 courses, I only enjoyed 3. My boyfriend who ate everything thought it wasn't too shabby but it wasn't anything spectacular. For the price, it definitely was not worth it for me since I didn't end up eating most of my dishes. ?I will say the tuna tartare was very good! Definitely well worth it, along with the presentation. I also enjoyed my plum punch cocktail. ?In terms of service, I've had better. I just felt as though she performed only to the minimum but she could have taken it a step further to make us feel more comfortable and understand the menu more. Plus some of the things she said was going to be in the Omakase wasn't even true. Quite strange. Overall, it was an ok experience that I didn't feel was worth the buck!

10 STARS FOR AN ABSOLUTELY AMAZING FANTASTIC TERRIFIC FABULOUS LIFE-ALTERING EVENING!!! ?=) ? ?(probably just 4.25 stars for the food itself overall) I came here for the omakase dinner tasting, 9 courses: 1) toro (tuna?) tartare (fresh and tasty, accompanied with 5 dipping sauces: wasabi, soy, pomegranate (?), avocado, and something else I can't remember...sour cream) and also came with a Japanese mountain peach for "palate cleansing"...how cool is that?? ?=) 2) yellowtail sashimi seared with soy sauce and sesame oil (4 thinly sliced strips, very tasty) 3) sashimi salad with tofu & sweet pea puree and mint sauce, fava beans, cranberry beans in yogurt sauce (probably my least favorite item) 4) giant oyster with seared fois gras, teriyaki uni (delicious!) 5) 5 pieces of sashimi (pretty standard) 6) "intermezzo" matcha (?) with black sesame macaroon and mint tea (I liked this, unique) 7) lobster with garam masala mix and lemon creme fraiche (very yummy, got half a lobster sliced length-wise and 1 lobster claw, loved the creme fraiche) 8) kobe beef strip over sweet potatoes (thinly-sliced kobe beef strips, tasty, but I prefer thicker cuts, sweet potatoes pretty good) 9) dessert - sweet red bean cake with apricot sorbet (pretty good but not great). Our waitress was very friendly, attentive, helpful with the menu and drink list, put up with all my questions about Mr. Morimoto, very cheerful (shit, I'D BE ECSTATIC TO WORK HERE!!) Let's not forget the cool toilets that will squirt water to clean and then blow warm air to dry your private parts. But the HIGHLIGHT OF MY EVENING was MEETING MR. MORIMOTO HIMSELF....I shook his hand (oh my god I touched him!!! *swoon*) and chatted with him (he's seems a little reserved) and got a picture with him!!!...he was all strolling around the restaurant with his sexy ponytail (and I HATE guys with long hair) so robust and confident and in his game...GOD, he's SO SEXY oh my god oh my god oh my god YEAH THAT'S RIGHT ANGELA HOE AND MAX I GOT TO MEET THE IRON CHEF HIMSELF!!! *faint* Can you tell I had an orgasm during dinner?

I got a gift certificate from my parents for xmas and I took my bf here for our 2 year anniversary. I loved it from the second we walked in the rising sun door. The wall made of water bottles is so cool looking. We were early so we went to the bar downstairs. Again, very cool, everything is light/stone/made of glass. They had my favorite champagne, White Star, by the glass which was a really nice treat. Then the hostess came and got us after a bit and took us to our table. We had sushi and seafood entrees and we were both impressed. Not totally overwhelmed with how jaw-droppingly awesome it was, but very happy. I had the most delicious drinks off their cocktail menu - great selection. Morimoto was walking around the restaurant stopping at tables to see how everything was and taking pictures with people. I thought that was really cool too. When I made my reservation I had mentioned it was our anniversary and after dinner our server brought us some complimentary little dessert nibbles that said Happy Anniversary in icing on the plate. I left very happy and I think the bill was only around $150 for the two of us (not including the pre-dinner champagne).

If I was to die right now, I'd die a happy woman after eating at Morimoto. This was my third experience dining here and this time we brought some out-of-towners and first-timers with us. We were also celebrating two birthdays that evening as well. The service was top-notch and always very efficient with clearing away dishes. Every dish was beautifully presented, as is expected with Morimoto's high level of culinary artistry. Two of our friends got the Omakase, which is the 8-course chef's special dining experience, while the rest of us ordered a la carte items off the regular menu. My boyfriend and I got the Rock Shrimp Tempura, which come glazed in two different sauces, one is a chili-buffalo type sauce and the other is a wasabi cream sauce. I still cannot decide which one is my favorite! We also ordered the Kakuni, which is the pork belly, and probably one of the best I've ever had. For entrees we got the Surf and Turf, and an order of the Sashimi for two. I'm getting sleepy just thinking about it. For dessert, we had the Apple Turban, and if you like Apple pie as much as I do, this is the dessert for you. It's Apple everything! My boyfriend had the Strawberry Pistachio Cheesecake, which was a lot more strawberry than pistachio cheesecake. It was still pretty delicious though. Oddly enough, it came with a small helping of pop rocks? He was pretty excited about that :) One of my friends is allergic to avocados and lactose intolerant and was catered to very well in terms of alternatives. Aside from a small glitch at the end of the night with a missing order of port wine, the evening went smoothly and was a top-notch experience! I will continue to bring people and recommend people to Morimoto!

what an experience - absolutely beautiful setting where we were seating promptly with our 8pm reservations. ?We slowly scoured through the menu to find an ample selection of delicacies from Morimoto's creative masterpieces. ? After a few minutes of deciding what we should pick, the obvious choice would be the omakase. ? The waiter advise us that it would be a nice slow meal that would last a solid 2 hours as we sampled the best of the best Morimoto had to offer. ? ?I slowly ate my meal as i watched my date enjoy each savory morsel that was presented like an art piece. ? There's nothing better than to watch the essence of pure pleasure on their face. ? The setting was contemporary with a slight urban flair. ? Service was impeccable as always and there is no way someone can knock this place. ? Yes, it is expensive - expect to pay about $200+ per person but the experience itself is priceless.

Another stellar sushi experience to go with the plethora of sushi places in New York City. Went for lunch looking to have the omakase, unfortunately, it is only served at dinner. Settled for the chirashi which was a lil different. I'll get to that in a moment. I actually started the meal with the highly recommended toro tartare, which was every bit as good as everyone claims to be. For my main, the chirashi was a medium bowl filled with assorted sashimi. What made it different was that they were cut into small cubes instead of the large slices I'm accustomed to. Took a lil getting used to, but in fact, I think it was more filling than the traditional slices, so the different take actually worked for me. You may have to work a little harder (more bites) but the end result is fairly satisfying (more filling). Not to say that the freshness of the sashimi was, as expected, nothing short of what you'd expect from the great Iron Chef.

I was excited about going to Morimoto and was looking forward to it. Everything was good, the food was delicious, the drinks were perfect and the prices were not that bad for the quality of food we were served. The only downfall is that our waiter told us that the "Angry Chicken" was not that spicy, but after ordering it, we saw it was drenched in pepper juice and was one of the spiciest things we ever ate, making this 26 dollar piece of chicken less appetizing than expected. Other than that, It was a very good experience.

Toro Tartare and softshell crab roll were good, not anything to write home about. Black cod entree and buri bim bap were solid, again nothing to rave about. The sashimi - salmon and scallop - were delicious. What really bugged me about this place -- deserving of this 2 star -- was that it didn't pour wine by the glass from the ?bottle listed on the menu. For upwards of $32/glass, I should be able to see what glass came from what bottle. I'm pretty sure that I didn't get what I ordered...3 times in a row.

Three might even be pushing it. ?The food was not good. ?Over dressed salad was start of my bad, overpriced birthday meal. ?I felt bad for my boyfriend, who was so excited to take me here (we are both big fan of Iron Chef). ?Bershire pork over porridge was too much sauce. ?Their spicy tuna roll was good and my favorite. ?Maybe I should have ordered sushi but I wanted to try Morimoto's dishes since you can get sushi anywhere. ?Huge disapointment. ?Although we sat at the bar (asked to be moved from the tiny tables), it wasn't all the great. ?The entrance was beautiful but the rest was "whatever". ?I didn't think the ice feels really went with the whole theme but maybe I just missed the point. ?Will not be going back.

It does not get much better. ?The restaurant itself is absolutely gorgeous. ?But that is not what got me. ?Lets start from the top... Toro Tartare - one of the most delicious tartars i have yet to taste. ?The presentation is beautiful, the osetra caviar on top gives it a nice acidity and the texture is like butter. Oysters Foie Gras - this was unlike anything i have ever eaten. ?I love all 3 flavors individually. ?But mixed together this came out to be ORGASMIC. ?My only complain is i wish there were more than 3 on the plate. Surf and Turf - this was good but not as good as the other entree. ?Kobe beef and Yellowtail are grade A quality and i would definitely recommend. Toban Yaki - i could eat this dish every single day. ?The scent just hits you as soon as they lift the lid. ?The seafood is all top notch (as expected). ?The best thing about this dish was the broth. ?After I had finished all of the seafood I started eating the broth with a spoon. ?The waitress came over with a bowl of rice (which by the way the rice itself is awesome) and said "this should do the trick". ?I dumped the rice into the broth and proceeded devouring. ?This might have been the best part of the dinner for me. ?I shit you not that this is one of the most amazing flavors you will ever come by. ?Highly recommended and guaranteed not to disappoint. Tofu Cheesecake - fluffy, airy, creamy, deliciousness. ?The soufflé is great and the ice cream has great flavor. ?Cant go wrong with this dish. All in all we had a couple beers and a bottle of 5 year old Morimoto sake. ?This restaurant is definitely on the pricey side but well worth the splurge if your a fan of great food.

Being a FOOD SNOB and friends asking me for suggestions on restaurants when they want to try new places, I have to say Morimoto is one of my FAVORITE AND BEST dinning experience EVER!! that being said, it must be really good. By far, the Chefs Choice of 7 courses exceeds any tasting menu experience I have EVER encountered. It's not only the taste, but the detail in presentation that makes the whole dining experience a work of art. Truly our meal couldn't get any better, but seeing Chef Morimoto at a table across the way and the husband saying: ?"That's not him, that guy has been sitting at a regular table for awhile. Why would he be sitting at a table eating? My son's hilarious response " He could sit where ever he wants, he own the place!!!!" We already spent 2 hours having our dinner, when we had no choice but to have the waiter box up our 7th course "THE DESERT", we were in NY for the 4th of July fireworks which was just about to start. As much as I would have loved to enjoy the atmosphere longer, I opt to rush with our TO GO bag and stand with the 30,000 other New Yorkers to watch the Macy's fireworks!!

The first thing to note is, this restaurant is expensive. I dined at lunch and still spent way more than I anticipated. I began with a coconut milk drink that was incredibly refreshing. I like that it tasted like fresh coconut without gritty ground coconut meat that a lot of drinks tend to have. For about $7, the drink did not disappoint. Then for the first appetizer was the toro tartare with ground toro on a wood plate and cavier spread on top. Also came with a plate of dipping sauces/condiments which included wasabe, sour cream, fish sauce, chives, avocado and rice balls. It was good but I thought that instead of ground toro, it would actually be a flat piece of toro so I was a bit disappointed. The price was about $20-$25 and I don't remember specifics. Next was the lamb carpaccio with a ginger garlic topping and chives. I was surprised that raw lamb didn't have any of the gamey taste that lamb normally does but the ginger garlic spread on top was too overpowering that it was difficult to taste the lamb. Next and final appetizer was the waygu beef carpaccio in a soy sauce based citrus sauce. The beef was really tender and the sauce balanced the flavor really well, it was probably my favorite appetizer and it was about $20. Then we got the waygu beef bento box with miso soup, salad, veggie tempura, three pieces of sushi which were red snapper, salmon and squid, three spicy tuna rolls and the waygu beef. The beef was my favorite thing in the box, it was really tender and I love the balance of savory and sweet in the soy sauce based teriyaki sauce that the beef came with. The bento box was about $25. Last was a tofu cheesecake with coffee syrup as apart of the bento box. It didn't taste like tofu at all but a light cheesy flavor accompanied by sweet coffee syrup that wasn't overpowering. I loved the texture, it was really soft and just kind of melted in my mouth. Overall, I enjoyed the food but it was way too expensive for me. I would recommend it for the experience but don't expect to spend anything less than $30 and that's pushing it.

Very disappointing. I've waited a long time to try Morimoto and I finally went for Restaurant Week and tried their lunch. I started with their miso soup which was good but it only had 1 tiny scoop of fresh tofu that you had to dig for. Then I tried their sashimi salad which was disgusting- It was tuna crusted with sesame and nori. It sounded so good but was so salty and strong flavored that it was almost inedible. I also think they made this tuna the night before and put it in the refrigerator. The dessert was good. It was a white chocolate panacotta which was light and airy. Lastly, the service was really not good and definitely not what you'd expect at any decent restaurant. People were pleasant enough but I don't think they were ever trained on any skills necessary to be a good waiter. ?The Restaurant Week menu is not worth it. ?If you're going to go to Morimoto, it seems like you should order off of their regular menu.

Good God Almighty!!! So glad I picked this wonderful culinary experience out of the millions of choices in NY!! Everything from the food, drinks and service down to the insane toilet features was phenomenal !!! My husband and friend had the Omakase for $120 each, a 9 course meal that the chef leaves to his mood and sends out in stages. Worth every penny!! It was divine!! I ordered a bunch of sushi everything from Spicy tuna maki to Tai sushi. It was wonderful, very fresh and decent portions, a little on the pricy side but hey he's Morimoto, when would we be able to do this again?? Our other friend ordered the black cod and the duck, duck , duck. The cod was wonderful. We had a couple of carfe's of sake, a few morimotini's and several white lilies, a fabulous drink that goes down like a refreshing cloudy citrus martini and leaves you giggling hours later. The bill was quite shockingly high but worth it. Truly a culinary experience I wouldn't trade for anything.

Morimoto was a well-choreographed treat to the palette! ?Our experience was great. ?We started with delicious rock shrimp and whitefish carpaccio coupled with a Japanese margarita and leche martini and slowly worked our way into two delicious entrees - a perfectly prepared sea bass and yellowtail served in a superheated rock bowl with rice and japanese spices. ?While the food was fantastic, the service was excellent! ?Our waitress was incredibly knowledgeable and everyone down to the coat checker asked us how our experience was as we worked our way out the door. ?A full meal with two appetizers, sake and drinks was $220 and worth every penny.

I yelped and stumled upon Moriomotos, and since it was my treat, I chose this place!!! ?Entering, I felt a calmness and aura because of the modern and simplicity decor. ?Drinks are pricey..they're more for the show so I'd stick with a beer. ?I don't know what it is, but I always choose the right thing when it comes to ordering. ?My sister is a vegetarian so she stuck with plain ole' sushi; I believe my brother ordered lobster/ (not sure) BUT I know what I ordered. ?I ordered the unbelievable chilean sea bass. ?I am a huge fish lover/eater. ?And let me tell you, my mouth still waters from time to time thinking about this. ?My brother and sister gave me props. ?They kept picking on my fish!! ?The bathrooms are downstairs by the bar...so techy and loungy feel. ?I really adore this place, and I think I'm due for another visit!!

I went here for lunch a couple years ago and was extremely disappointed but after hearing rave reviews from my other friends I finally decided to give it another go... ?I'm glad I did. Went here with my fiance on Christmas eve and was surprised to see that it wasn't too packed. ?I would recommend trying to go with more than 2 people (best 4) so that you can get multiple dishes/apps and just share everything. ? I would recommend the appetizers over the main entrees for sure. ?Although they're about the same prices, there is a more extensive menu as well as selection. ?Everything was very good from the dofu, to the oysters, although the tuna tartare was nothing special. ?Interesting presentation but I thought it was a little overrated. Best part of the meal was meeting Chef Morimoto himself. ?He was walking around greeting the patrons and even got a nice picture with him. We ordered the chilean sea bass which was delish. ?However upon almost finishing the dish, I found a hair. ?I brought it to the attention of our waiter to which he reacted appalled and apologetic. ?I told him, "hey there's a chance it could have been mine" but he insisted that it wasn't and that it was completely unacceptable. ?A manager was also called over to apologize and then we were given a complimentary 4 ounces of ?japanese certified steak which at $30 an ounce - well you do the math. ?First bite, un-be-lievable... but truth of the matter, it was too fatty to enjoy anymore after that. ? Overall, had a wonderful experience. ?Even though you stuff yourself because it's quality food you don't feel gross afterwards. I'd definitely go back again soon, there are other dishes that I'd like to try.

The first time I went to Morimoto was for my birthday (June) a few years ago. I had the Omakase tasting menu and fell in love. The second time (July) the I went I had a different tasting menu and was still amazed. The next time (August) I went back to having the original tasting menu. So after pay WAY too much for 3 months in a row (BUT SO WORTH IT!) we decided to wait a bit before going again. The next time we went (maybe a year later) we went for lunch after a day of shopping in Chelsea Market. Instead of the tasting menu I tried the tuna pizza which is a paper thin crust covered in thinly sliced tuna covered with fresh jalepeno slices on each slice with micro greens and a drizzle of wasabi aioli. TO DIE FOR and ultimately one of my favorite appetizers there. For lunch I tried one of the rice bowls and enjoyed it very much. I think we also did some sushi at that point and were not disappointed. We have since gone there many other times and ordered a la carte for dinner. My husband is in love with their tuna tartare and won't share it! I am in love with the tuna pizza and will always order it. We recently tried the rock shrip tempura and were amazed by the wonderful flavors it had. Finally my favorite entree is the lobster. I eat every last bit of it and suck each of the legs. The spice they put on it is just the right heat and the lemon creme fresh that comes with it cools you down. My husband loves getting their steak. He enjoys the waygu very much. Every time we go there the desserts are different. The one that I had most recently was a chocolate pudding with praline and other crispy things. It was delicious. I LOVE going to Morimoto and will continue to go there for special occasions and any other time for that matter!

Had to visit Morimoto when we visited NYC this week. ?It was so cool inside, very futuristic. ?I liked the atmosphere but I guess our table was in a high traffic zone, so I didn't really feel much privacy or feel all that comfortable. ?The food was really good. ?We felt we really had to at least try some sushi here, so we had the soft shell crab roll. ?Yum! ?I liked the spicy little bite it had, perfect punch. ?I had the Seafood "Toban-Yaki", which was delicious. ?King crab, lobster, scallops, shrimp, mussels, clams, Chinese broccoli, and King oyster mushrooms in a red miso broth (which also tasted like maybe it had some brandy in it as well). ?The fresh yuzu - yes I said FRESH YUZU - put the dish over the edge for me. ?I have never really seen fresh yuzu, but I guess if you're Morimoto you can get these things. :) ?My husband had the Baked Ocean Trout, which was good, but nothing extra special. ?He mentioned to me that he had "entree envy"! ?Ha! ?We ended up sharing because it actually was a lot of seafood. ?I thought things were a bit pricey for what they were, but I expected that. ?I also caught a glimpse of Morimoto himself, and he actually stood close to the hostess stand for around 10 minutes. ?I was actually surprised to see him there since this isn't his only restaurant, but was pleasantly surprised. ?The next time I go back (if I ever do), I'll get the omakase. ?We just dropped nearly $300 on lunch at Le Bernardin the day before, so we were trying to go easy on the wallet here. ?Not next time.

I need to come here again, but this place is quite expensive; you may want to come for only special occasions. Service is wonderful and waiters are friendly. Even though I came 30 minutes late to my reservation, they still accommodated me and my date to a quiet, private table in the corner which I imagine is where they were going to originally seat us if we came on time. The decor of the place is really nice - very contemporary, modern, clean. The space is huge, but it gets packed really fast even on a weeknight. I really enjoyed the Morimoto Sashimi appetizer. I think I could have been happy with ordering just their apps and maki rolls while skipping the entree meal altogether. There wasn't a terribly huge selection for entrees, but they have some good choices, especially the steak - it's super tender, juicy and just melts in your mouth. I wasn't loving their Sea Bass; it was a little too salty for my tastes but it's good otherwise. What I don't get is when ppl compare this place to other sushi places. Morimoto is a fusion restaurant so it's a blend of Japanese and Western styles, not just a Japanese restaurant that focuses on raw fish platters. This place is not your traditional Japanese restaurant so if you're looking for traditional, you're not going to find it here. And, I enjoyed this place for that unique blend. I am so missing Morimoto right now actually; can't wait for my next visit to this place.

came here a few times, in small and big groups, the food is good, has a special flair to it, try the duck duck duck, and century old pork, cocktails are good too, but the portions seem a little small so you have to order more appetizers or if you are going out to meatpacking afterwards, this is good because you don't have to worry about looking pregnant after. ?the tables are too close to each other for my taste but I guess that's true for most places in that area. overall good experience though.

My husband and I decided to drop into Morimoto after walking on the High Line. ?They seated us at the sushi bar. The room is draped in what looks like white cloth though it is fiberglass or something like it. The colors are neutral and the design is spare, setting the scene for great and beautifully presented food. ?Our server, ?Ronald was excellent and after he suggested the Omikase , which is not inexpensive, we decided to try it. ?It was very worthwhile if you are willing to try almost anything. ?The meal began with a toro in a paste eaten with a small spackel. Trust me, it is better than it sounds! Next was fluke in a sauce with pea shoots and a bit of micro greens. They had to take my plate before I licked it. ?There was a dipping sauce of garlicky anchovies and diakon and other veggies to dip. An oyster foie gras and Uni dish followed and then a dish of five excellent pieces of sushi.last was their version of surf and turf, a small lobster claw and tail with butter and spices and waygu beef over Japanese yams, ?this was a very rich dish. ?Dessert was not up to par and not worth mentioning but all the other flavors and tastes were wonderful. Open your wallet and your mouth wide and enjoy. ?This time it was worth it!

we ordered so many dishes that i really can't remember what we had, except for the perfect oyster foie gras(both my fav. food). there was also salmon sashima from somewhere. definitely was good, although i'd tried something of that quality somewhere before. overall the food's pretty good. the decor's cooler on the inside than outside. service is impeccable, probably the best among all the restaurants i'd been to in nyc. friendly, not too fake and we even got 2 pairs of their clear plastic chopsticks. foods were served quickly too.

ok. let me preface by saying that the food here is deserving of 5 stars. no doubt about it. ? the ambience is also deserving of 5 stars. ?the gigantic space is done up well and the much discussed bathrooms are everything as advertised and more. why two stars then: ?the service. ?it was beyond abhorrent. it was, hands down, the WORST service i have ever received at fine dining establishment. i am not going to throw the server under the table with specifics. and to be honest the manager has since attempted to rectify the situation by offering gift certificates. suffice it to say my guest and i were made to feel as though we were doing something wrong the whole meal--talk about awkward and horribly embarrassing--just because we ordered omakase for one of us and not the other). i doubt i will ever be back to enjoy those gift certificates. i really want to try morimoto napa while i am living in the bay area but dining here has tainted my faith in the iron chef's establishments.

My boyfriend surprised me with reservations to this restaurant. ?The dining experience here was awesome from beginning to end. ?We walk in, check in our coats and we're immediately seated at our table. ?The waiter was friendly and helpful with suggestions. ?We ordered a bottle of sake, kakune appetizer, calamari salad, sushi from japan, halibut, and surf & turf (kobe beef & tuna ceviche). ?Then, for dessert we had a trio of dessert made of tofu. ?Everything was delicious and plated amazingly. ?My only complaint is that the kobe beef I had was a little chewy and weirdly textured. ?Other than that, the food was cooked perfectly, fresh and super tasty. ?On top of the great food, the decor was so fresh and modern. ?Even the bathroom was a retreat itself (automatic toilets & an endless view in the stall). ?Love this place and would definitely come back. ?Too bad I wasn't there to see master chef Morimoto himself!

I really enjoyed this place when I went last year. I actually didn't have any expectations, knowing nothing about it, so I was very impressed from the moment I walked in. I am very into the decor and the interior of restaurants and this one lived up to my standards one-hundred percent. Modern, white, a very fresh feeling, none of that eat-in-the-dark modernity bs. I know the restaurant is pricey but I think it is definitely worth a try, and plus, I found it to be cheaper than Nobu (I don't know if that is a given and I hope I am not offending anybody by comparing Morimoto to Nobu!). My boyfriend ordered the Kobe steak, which was to die for, and Oysters, which were okay, but that might be because it was my first time trying oysters. The sashimi I ordered was very good, and so was the spicy tuna roll. I can't remember what else we ordered, sorry, it was a year ago, but I came out full and very satisfied! We had a couple of drinks each and I don't think we ordered a bottle of wine because the check was only 230$. The waitress was really nice, maybe too nice and too pretty in fact.... No but seriously, this place is awesome, I looooove it, I just wish I could afford a meal there on a regular basis.

Before I stepped into this place, we had a good feeling about his joint. We saw Alton Brown from the Food Network leaving the restaurant and not even Morimoto was there! It's pretty much night and day when you look at the outside compared to the inside. The inside is very artistic and very spacious. There is a lower floor which seats the bar and they had a couple of signature dishes that I had to admit better than Los Angeles. After several drinks, the hostess escorted us back upstairs and sat us to our table. For a Sunday night, it was really crowded and the everyone was having a great time. We ordered the following dishes: toro tartare (awesome presentation and interesting concept, a must try), tuna pizza (heard it was popular, but just ok), crispy rock shrimp tempura (we had to get something fried from this menu, it was tasty), Oyster Foie Gras (can't get any better than this, a pearl of a find), Chef's Combination $100 (damn a lot of good sushi!!!), and for dessert Apple Turban (good, nothing spectacular), and Tofu Hot and Cold (this is a must try, it was excellent and taste very light). I would give this place a 5 star, but our Chef's Combination took quite a long time. Actually, long enough for our party of three to be the last ones to close the place down. Chef Morimoto continues his "Iron Chef" mastery outside of Kitchen Stadium and into our neighborhoods. Please open one up in Los Angeles!!!!

I've wanted to try this restaurant for a couple years now and finally did late on Saturday night when I was trying to think of a place that would be open past 11. ?We didn't have a reservation and were seated in the area to the left between a wall and another couple. ?My date felt like we were seated in a closet, so he got up a couple minutes later to ask them to be moved. ?Before he had a chance to say anything, they asked if we'd like to be seated somewhere else and gave us a couple options. ?I like how the restaurant is decorated, and the bathrooms are beautiful. ?The toilet seats are heated and have several buttons with options to wash, dry, vibrate the seat, who knows what. ?I was too afraid to try any of the buttons besides flush, but I recommend that others give it a shot! ?Our waitress was very enthusiastic and animated. ?She said it was too late for the omakase, but she told us about her many favorite dishes on the menu. ?We decided on the $75 sushi platter. ?She recommended adding edamame to start, so we agreed to that. ?My date ordered some sake that he said was excellent, and I had their take on a lychee martini, which I thought was delicious (but my date said it tasted like medicine). ?The edamame was very good, and then we got our sushi. ?There were about a dozen different types of nigiri sushi (two of each) and a shrimp tempura roll and a yellowtail roll. ?It was all so good. ?The shrimp tempura roll was a little spicy but not too spicy. ?We ordered the strawberry cheesecake for dessert, and she told us it was light for cheesecake. ?It was a rectangular piece maybe a centimeter high, so I was laughing that she said it was light, because it was a pretty small piece of cheesecake (compared to your typical large slice). ?It was pretty dense and pistachio flavored. ?The strawberry gelato was delicious, but I thought it was odd that they added a small pile of pop rocks (creative, yes, but I find them to be too sweet and artificial tasting). ?After we paid, the waitress thanked us very much and shook our hands and said she hopes to see us again soon. ?I would definitely come back to try other things on the menu (or to get more of the same sushi we had).

I have sat at both the main dining area and the bar/lounge downstairs. The atmosphere in both places are very cool but I like the lounge area better. The oysters (the raw half-dozen kind and one with foie gras and teriyaki sauce) are pretty good. Served by the same waitress both times, nice service. The sushi rolls are fresh and nice too and not too expensive. Spent about $100 for 2 people on average.

i'm a huge fan of iron chef morimoto and when i was informed we'd be doing lunch here during restaurant week, i nearly shat a brick. i ordered the miso soup which was incredibly delicious. the beef gyudon was almost excessive in portion. luckily i'm a tank and i can handle it sans blazing. i would highly recommend sharing this dish if you simply must have it. after sampling my friend's angry chicken, i noticed that this dish combined what i presume to be some indian spices and other asian spices... regardless of my inability to describe, this dish is what will bring me back for more on my next visit.

This place is amazingggggggggggg!!! ?From beginning to end, this place is classy all the way and the food is off the hook, orgasmic good!! ?I used to live in NYC and my friends would call me the "Walking Zagat Guide" bc I'd critique as many NYC restaurants as possible, so when I went back to NYC a few weeks ago, I had to try this place. When we walked in, Morimoto (Iron Chef) was standing right there, greeting people. We had a 9pm res and we were escorted downstairs to the bar to get a drink beforehand (which I usually hate), but not this time. Each drink on the drink menu was unique and tasty. I had a spicy martini - it was spicy with peppers but also had a sweetness to it...very interesting. Then the food....WOW. We ordered some traditional sushi items as well as cooked foods recommended by the waitress. Would NOT recommend the lobster fritters, they looked and tasted like they came from a Trader Joe's package (haha), but everything else was spectacular. Very expensive, but worth every single penny!

definately currently the best japanese restaurant i've been to and eaten at. ?still have to try out nobu though. many of you complain about the pricing here and the prefixed menu, to that i say its your own fault for ordering the wrong items. ?since not many have even commented about the sashimi here, i will have to say the sashimi i had here was some of the best sashimi i have ever tasted. ?as far as the price, it is priced equally to your low buck hole in the wall sushi joint with sub par sushi. ?if any of you have eaten at sushi ran in norcal, you would notice their sashimi prices are off the wall for japanese imported sushi. ?morimoto's sushi is as good if not better without the high stakes pricing. ?if you browse through the photo's i've uploaded you can see what we ordered. ishi yaki buri bop (seared yellowtail hamachi over rice), it was good roasted ocean trout (trout over mashed potatoes says turnip), it was very good sashimi, GREAT soft shell crab, very good angry chicken (roaste chicken), good seafood 'toban yaki' (mix of seafood, lobster, clams,etc), i didn't try but friends weren't satisfied with it. not pictured, spicy king crab, at 23 dollars an order. ?i have to say, they are quite expensive, but they are definately worth trying. ?we had 2 orders which was 2 king crab legs cut into sections stuffed and baked i guess. ?the taste was superb. ?the rib eye, was good, but not speciality steakhouse good. ?don't recall if it was kobe/wagyu or not. ?what i do have to tell you is, we had a party of about 12 people, so we all got to sample each others dishes. ?i would honestly say the smaller dishes were MUCH better than the main dishes. ?i would have been completely happy ordering the larger plate of sashimi as my meal vs the seared yellow tail over rice. ?mind you it was good, but the flavor the sashimi had was excellent. ?so word of advice, vear away from the main courses and order many smaller dishes. ?this way you will end up with many dishes of very tasty items vs something you might not like. a few notes, i tried the roasted chicken? ?it was very good, where as my friend that ordered it stated it was dry. ?i guess when it comes down to it, he stated that compared to everybody else's dish his looked the least spectacular, and didn't have that punch of flavor everything else had. ?i will be trying out nobu in my next trip, but morimoto is definately on my todo list. ?oh and to note, the staff here is very gracious in the fact we stayed about 1+ hour past closing and clean up without bother. ?a few of my party were continuously ordering drinks and were brought out without question. ?we were the last people here this night. ?that is great service. ?for the people using the toilet, learn how to use a japanese bode and stop knocking the place down star's because you're incompetent. ?to note, the entrance to the restroom is a sliding door with no handles. ?lol

My sister and I were exploring Chelsea Market, and at 5:30, we were wondering what to do for dinner. ?Since we were close to the 10th Avenue exit, I said that we should look for Morimoto. ?Found it, looked and the menu, and wandered in. ?The maitre d' and front of house staff were very welcoming. ?I asked whether they had any availability ?for a party of two (we had no reservation), the maitre d' said with a warm smile that he did, and asked whether we would like a table or seats at the sushi bar. ?We said we would prefer the sushi bar. ?The hostess brought us to two nice seats at the end of the sushi bar. ?Before we could get too far in reviewing the menu, one of the women from the wait staff came to tell us about the omakase menu. ?It sounded delicious, and since we had never been to Mormimoto before (even though it's been on my list of restaurants that I wanted to try), we opted for the omakase. ?The cost is $120, but from the description, the menu had a number of courses that sounded very nice (foie gras, lobster, kobe beef, chocolate and caramel dessert). ?First course was a toro tartar spread ?flat on a flat box with thin columns of accompaniments beneath the toro (avacado, wasabi, crunch, scallions, sourcream, chives); very yummy. ?Second course was a salad of kanapachi with a white soy sauce foam, micro greens, beet powder.sprinkled on the rim of the plate. ?This was another excellent dish. ?This was followed by a dish with a good-sized piece of sauteed foie gras, uni and a large oyster in a thick sweet Teriyaki sauce. ?This was the only dish that didn't quite work for me (my sister enjoyed it very much though). ?The sauce was great with the foie gras, but IMHO, overwhelmed both the uni and oyster. ?The next course was the sushi course and was excellent; fish was incredibly fresh. ?We had chu toro, snapper, clam (and two other fish that I don't remember, but were also excellent). ?Our final savory course followed: ?kobe beef and half lobster with an Indian spice (garam masala). ?This was accompanied by the most delicious lemon creme fraiche (to soften the spice of the lobster--very yummy on its own and worked beautifully with the lobster). ?This was a very nice size portion. ?Dessert followed: chocolate ice cream on a flat chocolate cake with white caramel powder and caramel drops. ?Even though I usually don't enjoy a chocolate dessert after a big meal, this worked great. ?Service was attentive. ?The sushi chef was very friendly. ?Have to mention that the restroom is the most technically advanced facility I've ever seen (don't play with all of the buttons though). ?We received a warm farewell from the maitre d', and promised to return (next time with a reservation).

My friend and I came here for dinner around 10PM and this place was POPPIN'! I felt like it was precursor to a club ?[hey, may or may not be your thing for a nice meal!]--loud, upbeat music + club attire. We were greeted courteously and seated between two couples-- 1 foot away on each side. It was a little too cozy for my taste. The booths along the wall however, seemed much more comfortable and intimate (or as intimate as you can get at a poppin' restaurant). I would request one of those the next time I eat there. We ordered the spicy crab leg appetizer, chirashi bowl, toro nigiri ,and wagyu beef nigiri. All were delicious except for one piece of the wagyu beef nigiri, which may have been cut wrong? My friend described it as roast beef. That's not what I would want to hear for the price I'm paying for that piece of meat. The crab legs are a MUST!!! I can eat that for an entree. The sashimi cuts are also delicious! I would definitely want to go back and give the hot entrees a try as well! Overall, the food was great! Morimoto's beer was awesome (though steep)! And the ambiance is definitely hip. I would recommend this place for group outings and dates, but maybe not a nice romantic dinner because it can be a little crowded.

Had an enjoyable meal here to celebrate wife's b'day. Pork belly appetizer was good, cocktails were very good and entree was even a tad better then "very good" but didn't rise to level of great. One point my wife and I both found offensive was how the waitstaff seems to be trained to aggressively promote and push the tasting menu. Once we declined, the waiter seemed deflated and lost the charming spark she originally possessed. Nice place....would probably go back one day.

I was really lucky to have had the pleasure to eat here for my birthday. ?I was skeptical because of all the hype, i really hoped the food was as good as morimoto's reputation. ?My fiance and i decided to go with the omakase, which is the chef's tasting menu. ?One of the great things about this was i have some allergies w/ shellfish, the waiter advised us that they could adjust the tasting to fit my allergy. ?I have to say..i was really amazed by this because, a lot of restaurants don't really change their tasting menu even if you have an allergy. ?I am really please to say although the restaurant is so busy all the time, we still enjoyed our meal and the staff was very cordial. ?The omakase was definitely a splurge but it really showcased morimoto's vision and style. ?I enjoyed everything i ate...even the ginger beer (homemade to cleanse your palate was great) ?I was very happy with the experience...and was ?surprise that morimoto also makes great desserts at the end of the tasting we had the pleasure of having a flour less chocolate cake w/ passion fruit sorbet. ?If you are a foodie, you will appreciate the omakase.

I went with high expectations (of course! It's morimoto) and almost all of them were met. The black braised cod with ginger soy reduction was perfectly sweet and savory and was cooked perfectly to melt in the mouth. The interior design is cool and adds to the experience of the meal. However, we were seated 30-40min after our 8pm reservation. They only seated us because we asked them again about our table. I don't expect restaurants like Morimoto to be this way, which is why I only gave them 4 stars instead of 5.

It was only okay--the food was fairly good, but not exceptional. We had the ?yellowtail platter (good, but I enjoyed the new-style yellowtail at nobu more) and the yose tofu as appetizers (very filling, and novel to have the tofu prepared tableside, but the lobster and mushroom sauce that came with the dish wasn't that exciting). We had the angry chicken (large portion, but rather dry and not as "angry" as I'd expected) and the duck duck duck (duck egg, duck confit, and foie gras on a croissant) which was very rich and tasty and also really filling. We had the chocolate hazelnut mousse which was pretty and good (but not mindblowing). The service was attentive, the decor was nice, the toilets were interesting (lots of giggles in the ladies room).

first of all, the tuna pizza is truly a great dish...other than that, my experience here is similar to how i look at the meatpacking district in general...a lot of show with very little substance. ?good scene, but the food is not equivalent to what they charge.

tried omakase - the chef's choice. was more than expected. the ton toro was amazingly creative yet maintain tradition. turf and surf was a bit overwhelming in quality and quantity.

It's hard to miss this West Chelsea gem, mostly because of its giant red curtain entrance. Although we had a 10pm reservation we waited for about 10 minutes at the bar before we were seated. This actually wasn't too much of a problem for me because I was able to indulge in the White Lily cocktail. It's an absolute must-have at Morimoto! I would describe the decor as sleek and modern without being too cold. We ordered the toro tartare as an appetizer and it was out of this world. Melt-in-your-mouth tuna deliciousness served with caviar, wasabi, dashi-soy and creme fraiche. Being the sushi snobs that we are, my boyfriend and I decided to test out the Chef's Combination sushi platter. It was definitely up to par. Fresh fish, definitely never frozen. Excellent Uni, yellowtail, and salmon. If you like Japanese food, you can't miss Morimoto!

I wanted to love Morimoto's. ?I was extremely excited to try out the restaurant after so many wonderful reviews from friends. ?But ... all the dishes were similar, but not as perfectly executed as Nobu's dishes ... and just as expensive. ?Just upgrade to Nobu instead.

We had initially gone to Morimoto's in Philadelphia a couple of times and the omakase was excellent. ?We decided to give the NY restaurant a try and it was just as good. ?I'd give Morimoto the nod over Nobu as it is currently unmatched in terms of its sushi and creative hot dishes.

It just did not meet high expectations. Duck was a little dry. I really expected Kobe steak to melt in my mouth. It did not. Morimoto sashimi was very good but too small to share. Toro tartare was ok. I was not crazy ?about drinks. I am really tired of paying $14 for a drink that is not really good. I got myself ?a flask and will not waste money anymore :)

Good food, great service, and an ultra-modern interior make this a solid dining experience. Though the Toro Tatare is good it's really the garnishes that make it special (the Tuna itself is not so exceptional). Peach had an amazing Sea Bass that was bursting with buttery goodness. It was accompanied by some eggplant and tomato with a subtle smokiness to it that just made the dish perfect. My surf and turf was good with a properly seasoned and cooked Wagyu beef. The best part was the surf, a hamachi and avocado salad prepared tableside. ?Drink-wise the lotus cocktail and sake flight were well worth it.

OMG, you guys. ?Morimoto is a genius. ?This place is so freaking fantastic, down to every little detail. ?I came here on a girl's night out and boy did we splurge. Service: ?We loved our server. ?She described the food with such ease and familiarity, never struggling to remember the preparations as so many servers do. ?Water glasses were always full, finished plates were whisked away and the next course was presented in a timely manner. ?I felt like everything was efficient and fast, though we were there for 3 hours. ?I guess we just had a lot of courses. ?We took a long time to decide because the menu was so extensive and everything looked so delicious. ?In the end, we all got the omakase (tasting menu). Food: ?My mouth is watering as I'm thinking about the food. ?This is close-your-eyes-roll-it-around-in-your-mouth type of food, it is meant to be savored. ?It was definitely the experience our server described it as. As we ate each course, we kept saying how we could eat the same thing all over again, yet were so excited to see the next course. ?We had the toro tartare, salad course (veggie fondue in an anchovy paste - so unique and delicious), fluke carpaccio, oyster foie gras, sushi sampler, lobster + wagyu steak, chestnut cake dessert. ?Yeah, ok so we were so enchanted by the menu, we ordered two more courses - hamachi pastrami and lobster fritters. ?Everything was top notch. ?The oyster was so decadent, so indulgent. ?The sushi, so fresh and bright. ?I've had wagyu in Tokyo and nothing I've had in the US even comes close to touching it and this wagyu steak was no different, though it was still deeeelicious. ?If I were to change anything out, I'd swap the lobster fritters for the rock shrimp, which looked fabulous on other people's tables. ?The lobster fritters were like takoyaki, but lobster instead of octopus. And, as other reviewers have noted, the bathrooms are worth a trip downstairs. The bill for our meals, drinks, and tip totaled $540 (three people). ?Yikes. ?But when I think back about this meal, I remember the experience, not the bill. ?Ok, maybe the bill a little bit. ?ha. ?But I'll be back.

I was pleasantly surprised by the food I got considering the traditional sushi and sashimi were ho hum. ?Amazingly creative preparations of both raw and cooked fish. ?Strangely empty on a friday evening, but that only contributed to our attentive service and welcome to stay as long as we wanted.

I just went here last night, and I really liked it! The restaurant itself was a lot huger than expected. I originally made a reservation for 6:30, but I came in late so I had my date wait for me at the bar downstairs. I was worried that we wouldn't get a table (because I walked in at 7), but because this place is huge, they were easily able to get a table to accommodate us. They had a great selection of sake, wine, and champagne. We started with hot sake, then Moet & Chandon. Mixing the two was kind of a bad idea which I just realized this morning. Anyhow, we both got omakase. We actually regretted getting it instead of picking out what we wanted on our own. I was expecting something more Japanese and sushi from omakase, but it didn't really come as what I expected. But, it was fun having a 7-course meal, waiting for the next each time. I actually stopped eating at the 5th. I don't know why. Maybe the champagne killed my appetite, but I wished they gave us more sushi though. Next time I come here again, I wouldn't order omakase. But, if you don't know what to order or want to try a variety of things, then yes, it would work for you :) Anyways, omakase was $120 per person, and it was worth it. But again, If you want more sushi, I would definitely not recommend omakase. You will regret like I did! ? Server was nice, but she was kind of all over the place. I wished she was less busy. I loved the interior, especially the stairs and the bathroom! You definitely have to visit the bathroom yourself :) ?Lighting was great, but seats were too close to each other. It was kind of annoying, but I could forgive that. My overall experience was great, and I would definitely come here again and just not order omakase!

Sad to say, but I had a quite un-enjoyable experience while dining at Morimoto. Aside from the otoro and sake I didn't really like anything too much at this restaurant. Starting with the otoro was actually phenomenal, and at the time I felt the place was living up to my expectations, but this was all soon to change. Service was attentive, yet spotty. Also I experienced one of the worst server errors i Have ever seen. ?During my less than fufilling meal a server ( not mine ) removed my bottle of sake from the ice bucket it was in and placed it in a shared ice bucket with the table behind us. she did not tell me she was doing this, and it appeared as if she was pouring my sake for another table. when i questioned my server about this she apologized, but did nothing to make up for it. Calamari salad was so-so, my favorite dish aside from the otoro. ?The pork gyoza was served in an interesting manner, with a puff pastry shell but I did not enjoy them. ?Worst dish of the night went to the house smoked salmon ravioli. Strange gelatinous texture on the ravioli made me not want to have another bite. Also some foam was on the ravioli but was not done properly, it was a watery mess. ?The surf and turf claimed to have a wagyu filet, and it clearly was not. The hamachi ribbons were actually quite good as were the potatoes but the wagyu was not very good. Overall I would not rush back, perhaps I ordered the wrong things or perhaps morimoto was attempting to be too fancy and it did not work.

I'm giving it 3.5 stars. ?The space is nice but not as chic and beautiful as Del Posto (best looking restaurant in NYC) across the street. ?Came here for lunch during restaurant week. ?3 courses for $24. ?Not bad. ?The chicken was bigger than I expected. ?I would've given it three stars like del posto but it gets an extra half star b/c, unlike snobby del posto, we were seated with everyone else, regardless of what we were going to order.

whatever you do, DON'T ORDER the lunch prix fixe. ?If I hadn't been with my kinder and gentler sibling, I would have returned EVERYTHING. ?The tempura was a ball of dough, the kobe yakiniku/bulgogi was so salty you couldn't stand it. ?the most disappointing meal in NYC in a long time (and I've been living and dining out for 14 years now). ?The decor, I give you, is good but stay away from the lunch box.

Wagyu Rib Eye -- MUST HAVE!! Melts in your mouth, better than Peter Lugers porterhouse good... Food and cocktails were delish! We had the Toro Tartare, Kobe Beef Carppacio, King Crab, Tuna Pizza, Pork Belly, Truffled Trout, Wagyu droooool.... and like 5 different desserts among four people. Yes, we are animals but how can you stop eating when everything is so tasty. ?Beautiful interior, glass wall between tables made it feel more intimate... and the bathrooms downstairs.... just go check it out for yourself.

Fine sushi dining but 5 star rating is reserved for it's original location in Philly. Tasting menu is great if you are there for a dining experience but if you're out for some good raw fish like me you're better off ordering from the sushi menu and come away with cash left for drinks after.

don't believe the hype! though the atmosphere is undoubtedly amazing (all white interior flanked by a huge glass water bottle structure in the middle) and the bathrooms are crazy/sexy/cool, i was disappointed by the main entrees. my boyfriend got the seafood boulabaisse and it was just too salty. my friend's boyfriend got a tiny filet of seabass in a giant plate which did not satisfy him. i got the ?famous miso black cod which frankly i wasn't impressed with - i think i could have made it myself!!! the only interesting and filling dish was my other friend's main entree - duck duck duck. but the drinks are delish (the lemony White Lily) as were the appetizers...we loved the spicy king crab and the kobe beef sashimi - YUM! i think we were just expecting a whole lot more...and although we were discouraged after the main entrees i still decided to order dessert - the earl grey tea creme brulee ended up being amazing! lucky for morimoto the drinks, appetizers and amazing desserts made up for sub-par main entrees. also - beware of your bill. it can get pricey if you're not watching!

For this past Christmas, my boyfriend and I decided to treat each other to a night in the city and we chose to eat at Morimoto. We walked into the restaurant and were absolutely stunned. The lighting was dim and everything was fresh, light, and cool looking. We sat at the bar downstairs for a half an hour and we were taken care of by the nicest, most down to earth bartender. Our drinks were cold, delicious, and perfect. When we were seated back upstairs, we ordered two appetizers, and a sushi platter for two. Our first appetizer consisted of thinly sliced different types of sashimi stacked on top of each other, with 5/6 different sauces to chose from to accompany them with. Our second appetizer was a tuna pizza, which had a thin, crispy, crust with raw tuna, onions, and tomatoes on it. Our sushi/sashimi platter was amazing and our waiter explained what each fish was and how it was caught and prepared. All of our sushi/sashimi was fresh and delicious. I highly recommend this restaurant anytime you're in the mood for impeccable service, food, and atmosphere.
