Just when I thought I had this whole portion control thing down, in comes Dinosaur BBQ proving that when it comes to eating meat, I have an appetite that can compete with a T-Rex. I was there with a group of 12 people for Saturday lunch, and a few of us on the foodie side of the table decided to go all out and order family style with add-ons. For the family style order, we switched out the whole chicken for chicken wings for an extra $2. Best 2 bucks you will ever spend I tell ya. Almost everything we ordered was delicious. The fried green tomatoes were crunchy on the outside and melted in my mouth afterwards. The mac n cheese was easily one of the best ones I've had in the city (and I've had MANY). It's got the perfect balance of tangy, spicy & cheesy. Many places add a lot of frills to their mac n cheese but this is the dish in its purest form. For the chicken wings, we got the garlic & chipotle sauce - they were spicy and addictive. A full rack of ribs came with the family style order. They were tender and falling off the bone. I thought their sauces were very balanced also - not that you would even need them, because the rub made the ribs pretty awesome by themselves. The Texas Brisket was decent but not one of the highlights. I was actually more impressed by the Korean style ribs (Kalbi) which I thought was in par with a lot of K-town places. This location of Dinosaur BBQ is a mecca for meat lovers . As I sat down with the menu in front of me, I could feel my alter ego - Fatboyosaurus taking over. However, the fairly long trek to Harlem and the two extra hours I had to put in the gym next week was totally worth it.

I have heard about this place for years and have always wanted to try it, but rarely make the trip to Harlem for dinner. I was staying in Harlem for the February bar exam and my boyfriend was nice enough to make the trip to see me and take me to dinner between the two exam days. The place was PACKED on a Tuesday night, but we did get seated right away. The location is a little scary and I would recommend asking the hostess to call a taxi for you, so you don't have to stay outside and hail one/walk a few blocks to find one. The hostess was more than willing to do this for us and the taxi was not overpriced at all, even though it was not a yellow-cab. The good: Get the mac and cheese. Get the sweet potato with spicy nuts (or something)-- it's not spicy and it was delicious. Get the ribs-- I don't like ribs, but these really were quite good. Get the arnold palmer (1/2 sweet tea/ 1/2 lemonade-- it made me feel like I was drinking sweet tea from the South.. yum!) The in between: Chicken was tender and good The not-so-good: Skip the brisket-- I was surprised, but it was so dry and tasteless. Don't bother. Skip the brussel sprout side (if offered, it was the special side of the day). Skip the white bean soup-- my boyfriend didn't like it.

I kinda wished that I hadn't heard so much of the hype about this place before I had a chance to try it. Maybe I was expecting to be blown away and my expectations were a little too high. The restaurant was a very fun place to hang out. The food is decent and good enough.

I went to this restaurant to celebrate my friend's birthday. I always drove by it, never went in mainly because there is ALWAYS ?a crowd waiting. this time it was no difference. i was in a party of 8 and it took almost 2 HOURS to get seated. it seems as if this is the norm at Dinosaur BBQ. The food was good. Huge portions. The staff was pleasant. The sangria was DELICIOUS!!! i will try to go during lunch time and see how it goes with the wait. if its the same, unfortunately, i won't go back. But the food is really good and you won't be disappointed.

This place is AWESOME! Came here Saturday night and had a great time. The place was super packed (reservations were booked by noon), and there was an hour+ wait for a table, so we sat at the bar (I got lucky and found two spots just as people were getting up). The food was reasonably priced and super delicious, indulgent comfort food. The sweet potatoes and pulled pork were standout items, as was my Donkey Punch (very strong though - be careful!, switched to beer after). The band came on and after the first set our table was ready. You could still hear the music well even from the back. Will definitely make it back here, even if it pretty far.

We've come a long way since Syracuse Dinosaur :) I dont even know if my vote counts as I've been a fan of this place since its early days as a biker joint in Syracuse NY. When I moved back to NY I was stoked to realize that they opened a place here in the city. Huge fan then and huge fan now, this easily tangos with some of the best southern bbqs hats off. (4 stars for the wait in Harlem but that only tells you how damn good this place is )

I love this place! Best BBQ in Manhattan, hands down. The ribs are amazing! Just don't show up when you're cranky and feel like you could faint from hunger, as you will probably have to wait a while for a table ... ?unless you're lucky enough to snag one in the bar area.

Oh I have been waiting a long time to review this place. After hearing my friends go on and on about this place we finally decided to go with a group of friends. After waiting almost 2 hours to be seated and having to deal with multiple hostess changing their wait times faster then a fat kid at a buffet we were finally seated. Noise level at this place is horrible and the table was sticky. Can you see were this review is going? We order Ribs, Wings, Pulled Pork, Brisket, Spicy Shrimp, Coleslaw, Beans, Mac & Cheese, ?and a few other items. ::COMPLETELY OVER RATED:: Best thing I ate that night was the Mac & Cheese and I HATE Mac & Cheese! My only guess is that most of the people that have reviewed this place have never had GREAT bbq like the type you will find down south or in the Mid West. And yes I understand there is a huge Lack of Good BBQ place to eat at in NYC. This was my first and last visit to this place.

3 Stars is not supposed to be an insult... Not a lot that I can think of to say about this place... Good, even great BBQ. ?Large portions, they even had my favorite, Asian style black bean short ribs... As good as anywhere else that I've had them. They seem to take their bones seriously.

Hi there, my name is Brandi G. and I am a junky. ?I've been an addict for five years and my drug of choice is barbeque. ?I don't really know when it started. ?Perhaps I picked up the habit as a child, sneaking pieces of grilled meats off the deck while no one was ?looking. ?Or perhaps as a teenager trading char-broiled pieces of meats with friends. ?However, somewhere along the way, my experimentation with smoke became more than just social, more than just a seasonal, it became a habit that I had to satisfy even in the dead of winter. ? One November day several years back, I had an extreme relapse. ?The craving for BBQ was so acute that I was delirious and absolutely spinning out of control. ?Thankfully, my friend knew a place...and introduced me to my current pusher, Dinosaurs Bar-B-Que. ?We've been dealing ever since. To put it simply Dinosaur's BBQ has an unnatural effect on me. ?It is endorphin inspiring and mood altering. ?It is the palate personification of perfection. ?It is hands down the best BBQ in all of New York City (forgive me Blue Smoke). For context, ?I am not a huge meat eater ( I don't consume pork and generally speaking I don't do red meat, though I do make an exception for lamb on occasion). ?So, for me, Dinosaur's is all about the chicken wing. ?These succulent, well-seasoned, perfectly glazed and charred wings are hands down my absolute favorite go-to for comfort food. ?Paired with a order of potato salad (the best I've had from a commercial kitchen) and a side of collards (interesting interpretation of the greens, as they are slightly sweet), this meal is impeccable. I want to deduct a star for the excessive wait time during peak hours, because it can be tortuous for a junky like myself to sit still and watch other people get their fix before me. ?However, it would be an injustice to the establishment to deduct for my personal shortcomings (scratches neck a la Tyrone Biggums). I used to drive uptown in bumper to bumper traffic just to get my, ahem, fix. ?Thankfully, they've decided to expand their, ahem, market and will be debuting their Brooklyn location before summer. ?Oh yeah, give it to me baby, I need it...like right now.

Had high expectations for this place. I've been doing a BBQ tour around NYC and thought this had potential to be the bet but it was just ok. We pretty much ordered everything on the menu. The ribs, chicken wings and corn special were the best. The best part of the meal was the live music that came on at 11:30 sat night. If you're looking for good BBQ go to mighty Quinn's. if you're looking to feel like you're transplanted into the south, go to Dino BBQ.

I understand why people make the trek to 125th street to go to Dinosaur BBQ. The ribs are delicious and I really enjoyed my meal here. I went on a Sunday at 1pm and there was a long wait for tables. You can sit in the bar area (full menu served). The smallest size of ribs on the menu is a half rack, but you can ask for a quarter rack as well. It comes with two sides (if you love sweet potatoes, they're awesome here). I had to double check to make sure I got the right bill because it was so cheap ($10.95). It was a long debate for me whether I liked the ribs here or the ribs at Blue Smoke better.. I concluded they are different styles and I love both. The 1 train drops off super close, so make the trek and tip well because the servers are so nice!

I am many years late with this review. I have had Dinosaur BBQ on several occasions, I have eaten in and we have also had it delivered to my job for events. I give five stars for the food but three stars for the service for an average fo four. Both dining in and delivery, it seems that the service is very slow, reservations or not. I rememebr eating in and getting some of my food but still waiting for my sides. I also remember standing out in the cold waiting for the delivery man! ?It has been a while since I have been here so I will definitely give it another go and hope the service has improved. Get the wings and the brisket!

Ribs - 3.5 stars - kind of dry but they give you sauce so it makes it okay. Mac & Cheese - 4 stars - really good. will recommend. Beans - 4 stars - really good. will recommend. Coleslaw - 3 stars - good. but nothing special. Fries - 3 stars - good. but nothing special. Wings - 4.5 stars - really really good. will recommend. Fried tomatoes (?) - 3.5 stars - good. will probably recommend. Spicy Shrimp - 3 stars - good. but nothing special. Deviled Eggs - 3 stars - good. but nothing special. Damn I ate a lot of food there.

I've been here 3 times (always take my friends visiting from Italy here), and they all love Dinosaur. The portions are huge, and the price is just right. I've enjoyed the Sweetheart Deal for Two, and my favorite sides were the french cut fries and mac & cheese. I also liked the Bigass Pork Plate. I'm Italian and not a BBQ connoisseur, but I definitely love this place. Make your reservations early because it's hard to get them at the last minute!

WOW! ?All I gotta say is get the ribs! ?They are really the best I've found in NY... sorry Blue Smoke and Danny Meyer (who I am a huge fan of). ?I went on a Sunday at 5:30pm...I didn't think there would be a wait, let alone almost a 2 hour wait!!! Luckily, after about 30 mins, my boyfriend and I were able to get a seat your self table by the bar. ?I don't really think it would have been 2 hours wait anyway, the hostess stand was a hot mess. ?It took the woman 8 times to enter my phone number correctly on the ipad they were using to enter the reservations. Despite the hostess debacle, the food really won me over. ?Our server was friendly and was hustling to serve several tables. ?I got the combo, half chicken and half ribs with mac & cheese and coleslaw... chicken was nice and juicy, but next time I would definitely go all the way ribs. ?Mac & cheese, coleslaw, cornbread was also a SLAM DUNK!

I have to give this place FIVE stars. The BBQ is amazing, and there is extra sauce on the table. The portions are large and not too expensive. There is a great selection of beer. It can get a bit loud, but the service is usually very fast so you don't have to put up with it for long. It can also get very busy, but I've never had to wait that long for a table. This is my favorite BBQ place in the city.

Pretty damn good BBQ. I came here once 5 years ago, when I was a BBQ newbie and thought everything was fantastic. Present me is a more refined BBQ eater, which is just a nice way of saying I'm a fat ass that eats hella meat. Coming to NYC meant I had to try Dinosaur again and compare it to the San Diego BBQ king, Phils BBQ. BBQ Ribs (Pork) - The ribs were tender, but not fall off the bone. I prefer this because it gives it a bit more texture to chew on. The rub on it was great and I really got the smoke flavor from the meat. No sauce necessary Pulled Pork - The meat was soft, moist and pull-apart-with-fork tender, but it honestly didn't have great depth of flavor. Not much smoke or spices present. Had to put sauce on it to really get any flavor. I was happy that it was moist as I've recently had pulled pork that tasted dried out. Brisket - I love brisket and I thought this would make Dinosaur better than Phils in my eyes. However, the brisket here was mediocre. It wasn't that tender, with the meat putting up a bit of a fight when I tried to cut and eat it. The flavoring was decent, but like the pulled pork, needed sauce. Chicken wings - Can't really go wrong with chicken wings and these didn't. Good stuff. Deviled Eggs - Good stuff. Creamy with just a hint of pepper Fried Green Tomatoes - Really good. The batter was tasty and not over cooked. And the tomato on the inside had great acid that surprises you after biting through the fried exterior. Boiled Shrimp - Very disappointing. The had absolute no flavor and the cocktail sauce wasn't spicy or tangy. BBQ Beans - AWESOME BEANS. Sweet, creamy and porky. Overall, Dinosaur has some great stuff and some average stuff. The great stuff is probably the best BBQ I've had, but the average stuff like the boiled shrimp and brisket bring it down a notch for me.

If I were a dinosaur, I would eat here every day. Seriously. It's so good. I'm not a huge fan of spice but I got the Mango tango wings - So good. The chicken is cooked to perfection and is super tender and moist. Add the original Dino Sauce and you're set to go. For real though - the service is great, the food is scrumptious and everything is just perfect. I have yet to try the pulled pork, but since that is my favorite delicacy of a bbq restaurant - the next time I endure on a journey to Dino BBQ. I'll be sure to update this review to most likely a 5 star(er). Also I hear the Donkey Punch is a real Kicker.... pun intended. Enjoy!

I have nothing bad to say this place was on place except for the wait if you are hungry. ?The portions are oversized but in a good way. ?I like the chicken wings the best and then the ribs (needs extra sauce). ?The place is a little noisy but nice for a date or for a family gathering.

The first time I had Dino BBQ I was not impressed, but it was a catered lunch at a gathering, so I assumed the dry, tough brisket was the result of the catering tray, and not a true representation of the quality offered by Dino BBQ. I was wrong about this. The first time I dined in the actual restaurant, I ordered the brisket/pork plate. I was thoroughly impressed by the quality of the sauce, and the pulled pork was delicious. The problem, once again, was the brisket. It was one step away from eating boot leather. The flavor was ok, but miles away from the quality offered at some of the finer bbq places I have enjoyed. The true star of the show on that first visit? The Wings. Those damn, delicious wings. Let me say this, you are doing yourself an incredible disservice if you pass up the wings at Dino BBQ. These wings are slow-cooked and then finished on the grill with your choice of sauce. I prefer the Wango Tango - peppery bbq sauce with the right amount of spice. I catch myself thinking about these wings in moments where my mind drifts idle. I will be on the subway, pondering meal choices, and be drawn to the 125th stop by the simple hint that getting these wings could be a slight possibility. Seriously, I am beginning to consider this a problem. Aside from the Pork and the Wings - Shit. Seriously, look, the place is worth it just for the wings. I cannot vouch for these other sauces though, I'm only raving about the wings with the Wango Tango and Honey bbq sauces, because those are amazing and keep me up at night. Don't come crying to me if you had a bad wing experience from ordering one of the other sauces. But if you do go and get some wings, be sure to let me know about it, because I will get out of bed for some damn wings. - I have also tried the pulled jerk chicken thing they have going on, and can definitely say that it's delicious. Another drawback to this place is the price. When I ordered the big ass pork plate, I can honestly say I was stuffed, you know, after eating those wings too and all, but I also felt that the meal was a bit overpriced. The value per-dollar drops if you order a sandwich platter. It's a few dollars less than the pork plate, but the sandwich is not nearly as big as you would like it to be, and I felt slighted on the portion of sides. Oh, the sides! Fries are a challenge to get wrong, and Dino's fries are definitely a worthy side option. The mac and cheese is delicious, and pretty much a must-do with any meal. The salted potatoes or whatever they're called were disappointing - just boiled potatoes covered in cajun butter. The cajun butter was awesome, by the way, but it's just served with simple, bland boiled potatoes. Not fun. The whipped sweet potatoes, however, are awesome. They come with delicious spicy pecans on top and are a great choice if you're in the mood to try something other than fries or mac and cheese. The fried rice side was strange, and not something that I can whole heartedly recommend. I feel like if you're eating a big ass plate of bbq meat, the fried rice thing isn't really the right flavor accompaniment that you wanna go with. After all that, Dino BBQ is definitely one of the best choices you can make in the West Harlem area. Their brisket is on the do-not-order list, but aside from that everything I've tried is decent to great. The price point is a little bit high, but I am accustomed to Chicago/Detroit prices, not New York prices, so, you know, I understand. The wings cannot be recommended enough. Get those damn wings. UPDATE - The fact that a rep from Dino BBQ commented on my post just a few days after writing it definitely brings them up in my book. A restaurant that is paying attention to the feedback from their guests is a place worth frequenting!

Came here with a bunch of friends on Saturday night for my b-day. Atmosphere: - Very fun. ?Has a rustic feel. ?Very spacious (couldn't believe we were in Manhattan) - Fun change of pace Service: - Server was great and responsive for our large table. ?She did a great job Food: - Apps: sampler with fried green tomatoes, chicken wings and deviled eggs. ?Awesome! ?Highly recommend trying a sampler - Main: full rack of baby back ribs with macaroni and cheese and coleslaw sides. ?Ribs were out of this world. ?Nicely smoked and appropriately dressed in bbq sauce. ?Mac and cheese was terrific but the coleslaw was a little too mayonnaise-y for me. - Dessert: Chocolate Icebox Pie - holly crap this was amazing. ?Must get. Don't worry if you are too full, worth a few bites and surrender it to the table to taste. ? - Drinks: great craft brew selection with 4 glass flights. Great prices for craft brews as well! Great spot. ?Perfect for large groups. ?Large portions at great prices. ?I'll be back.

I came to Dino Bar-B-Que's where the The New Uptown Comedy host their comedy night show every Thursday's. This event is held in the upstairs space of the Dino BBQ building which has a separate entrance from the restaurant itself. ?This event space has a set up of wooden picnic style tables with ?a full ?bar in the back where they can make their infamous kick ass Donkey Punch drink, oh boi did that drink sucker punch me, it hit me with the 1-2, I'm in the lightweight division, but I didn't get ?K.O'ed . At this event you can go downstairs and order from the menu as take-out and bring your food upstairs. Upstairs does offer a limited selection of food for about $12 a plate which included ribs, collard greens, cornbread, chicken and mac and cheese. ?We went with the option of ordering food from downstairs. I've never had Dinosaur BBQ before so I decided try the Swag Sample Plate which consisted of spicy shrimp boil, chicken wings, fried green tomatoes and deviled eggs. I was looking forward to the deviled eggs as I've have not has some in a while and was craving its yolky creamy taste. I took a bite with great disappointment to find out they were WAY to vinegary. The green fried tomatoes were decent tasting, it nice and crispy on the outside with a gooey inside texture when bitten into. The spicy shrimp boil were really good but I'm not a fan of peeling my shrimp shell skin to eat just two bites of flesh. The chicken was eh, not memorable. Next time I'm going to try the food served upstairs as it looked more appetizing than my sample platter. Overall the comedy show event was full of high energy; there is a live DJ on set who plays really good music, which got a few girls up out of their seats dancing. The line of comedians were a hit or miss, some funny and some really not at all. The comedic host Omar was the best along with a female comedian who goes by the name of Cookie. ?Things to know: the show admission is $10 and if you want to sit at a table you must RSVP in advance. The show starts at 8:30

This is my second time at Dinosaur - first time was in Rochester, second time in Harlem. Come here for the RIBs and get LOTS of it! Dont even bother with the other meats. Yes, Dinosaur has amazing BBQ, fall off the bones, perfectly smoky and extremely tasty with just the right amount of sauce. For the Ribs alone, it deserves 5 stars. ? Appetizers are also delicious. ?We particularly loved the wings and friend green tomatoes. ?Sides were great too particularly the salted potatoes, cornbread and whipped sweet potato. Don't forget to order the Sweet Ice Tea. But I docked Dinosaur a star because thats not the only thing they serve. ?The brisket was too dry (not even in the same league as Hill Country), the chicken also dry and the pulled pork was mediocre. ?This was the same problem as the Rochester location (why didn't I learn?!) Will I be back? Yes but I won't order any of the meats except for the Ribs.

The BBQ ribs here are on point! Juicy, tender, flavorful and meaty!!!! The fried green tomatoes and delivered eggs were great starters to finger licking good ribs. Also had their steak which was thick and juicy, seasoned well and cooked to perfection. You cannot go wrong with anything on the menu including their sides. Mac b cheese and potato salad had a kick and cornbread was sweet, crispy on the outside and delicious. Went early during the week and had no wait at all.

I'm from the south so I know BBQ. The meat was excellent (I had a full rack of ribs). The sides.. ?Not so much. The greens CANNED & full of stems, cooked in vinegar (yuck). The Mac & Cheese, Potato salad... ?Bland The Beans were flavorful. The fried green tomatoes PERFECT. Waitress... Perfect. She was friendly & kept tea in my glass and water on the table.

Having grown up in Texas, BBQ is very close to my heart. Thankfully, this place does not let me miss one of the few things I sometimes miss about the South, a good ol' piece of meat swimming in delicious bbq sauce :) ? Dinosaur has it right from the atmosphere, to the portions and price, to the taste, everything in this place feels homey and comfortable. I would even venture to say it is a little escape from the city, in an odd sort of way, in its little hideaway. Yeah the wait can really suck sometimes, but the food is totally worth it.

Solid BBQ joint, but nothing that really stands out. Ribs = Tender and tasty Sliders = Meh Wings = Good wings Mac & cheese = Average, but could have more cheese flavor Collard greens = Meh Bucket of beers = Great idea and keeps the beers ice cold Dinosaur BBQ is a pretty good place to get Southern BBQ, but definitely not memorable.

Dinosaur Bar-B-Que was a really nice surprise. ?It was a lot of fun!! My wife and I are both pescetarians (i.e. we don't eat any meat or chicken but we do eat fish). As such, we typically don't go to Bar-B-Que restaurants. However, we went to dinosaur Bar-B-Que based on the recommendation of another pescetarian who assured us that there would be plenty of choices. Both my wife and I had the Portabella Mushroom burger platters with two sides each. I had the curried succotash and the iceberg salad wedge with their bar-b-que dressing (a yummy mixture of blue cheese dressing with bar-b-que sauce). The food was terrific and very fairly priced. I also had a margarita off of the cocktail menu that was fairly priced and really good. The servers are very friendly and the restaurant is energetic (in a good way). ?The volume was reasonable and the restaurant is very family/kid friendly. We will be back!

We were here on a cold Wednesday night around 9:30pm. The place was still crowded but we were seated immediately, no wait. We got the full rack ($26.95) & 1/2 rack of ribs (16.95) with mac n' cheese, creole potato salad, & fries. The ribs were so good! Flavorful, soft, & tender! We really can't find any flaws on the ribs, it was just perfect! The mac n' cheese is really good. Cheesy & tasty! We absolutely love the mac n' cheese here! The cornbread is crunchy on the outside & soft on the inside, it was great! The potato salad & the fries were also great! It was definitely worth the trip! Great service! Food came pretty quickly! If you're into BBQ, this place is definitely a must place for you stop by. It's definitely worth it. Highly recommended! We'll definitely go back...

BANGGGGGGIN!!!! My friends and I arrived around 6 PM on a Wednesday and it wasn't crowded. We decided to sit at the high tables/bar area because it was happy hour (3-7pm; $1 off drinks). Donkey punch: Good drink. It was a mix of different alcohols. But, don't let it just sit there because it gets insanely strong (at least for my friends and I) and you won't want to finish it. Fried green tomatoes: I would NEVER order this because it doesn't sound special/unique to me. But, wow. These were delicious!! The sauce was great with it as well. We wanted to order more! My friend got the bbq chicken, which was super moist and tender. We thought it was uncooked, but it was just really cooked to perfection! A friend and I split the sweetheart special (I think that's the name) which included 4 sides and a full rack of ribs. The ribs were good, soft, tender. But my main focus was on the sides! Mac & Cheese: DELICIOUS! Creole potato salad: DELICIOUS! Salted potatoes: Don't recommend. The waiter recommended this to me and I was disappointed. It was regular boiled potatoes with some salt thrown on it. Sweet potato: DELICIOUS! Cornbread: HEAVEEEEEEEEEN! I had to order extra (2 for 75 cents!) We're already planning to go again! :)

Not as good or generous as Lucille in California but the best barbeque on the island of Manhattan in my opinion. This barbeque oasis is located on 125 and the end of the road (literally) between 9th and 10th ave. Don't let the desolate and difficult to find location fool you. This place is always packed on the weekends. Wait times start at 30 mins and go up from there. ?Don't sweat the small stuff or the wait, go up to the bar and try one of their donkey punches filled with juices and enough libations to put event the most sour person in a good mood. The pulled pork is fab and the ribs are not to bad! I can't speak to the dessert menu as I have never managed to save enough room for it.. but I am sure it too is tasty. Overall I would say this is a great barbeque option on the "island"... as for a smokehouse you will have to travel to Queens for some of that.

Pretty darn good BBQ. I enjoyed the Tres Ninos, which is their pork, brisket and rib sampler with sides of BBQ beans and cole slaw. The meats are good, but not great. I don't know if I've ever had great BBQ in a large (especially multi-unit) restaurant. The small local places seem to do it so much better. The smoke flavor was light in both the pork and the brisket. The ribs were good but not quite the fall off the bone tenderness that I like. Very good sauce, excellent ?beans and good cole slaw. If I were local, I would repeat, but I can't put it anywhere in my top 10 of BBQ joints.

I live in the neighborhood, so I come here or order takeout from them quite often. ?This place is amazing. ?As a New Englander not from any major BBQ city, I can confidently say this is the best barbecue restaurant I have ever been to. ?The food is incredible (try the baked bean side) and the prices are reasonable. ?It has a fun roadhouse type vibe with high ceilings, rough-hewn wood, and studded leather. ?There is also live music at night. The staff is attentive and helpful, and the manager stops by the table most times, which is impressive in such a large restaurant. ?The kitchen is great beyond the quality of the food by doing things like not cutting the roll of your sandwich all the way through so the filling doesn't all drop out the bottom while you're trying to eat it. Great barbecue, close to the 125th st 1 train stop, worth a trip up to Harlem. ?Highly recommended.

Tucked away at the west end of 125th Street is probably the best BBQ place in the city. ?The Texas style beef brisket was tender and had a nice smoked flavor, although I thought the pulled pork and ribs looked really good too. ?For a side, I definitely recommend the mac & cheese. ?The menu has a little something for everyone -- combo plates, sandwiches, salads, etc. ?The beer selection is pretty good as well, and prices are very reasonable. ?While the restaurant is enormous by NYC standards, I'd recommend making a reservation to avoid a wait.

For those of you who don't know, Dinosaur BBQ was originally started in Syracuse, NY, which is located in central new york, or what most "New Yorkers" call "upstate". I am a native born and raised Syracusian, and I've grown up on the original Dino BBQ in that area. I was ecstatic when I moved to NYC and found out that there was a chain in NYC in Harlem. I had pretty high standards from the one in Syracuse, so when I tried the one in Harlem, I was equallly as much a fan. It's pretty crowded, but they do take reservations. I recommend setting up a reservation AT LEAST 2 weeks in advance. NYC is crowded no matter where you go, and a reservation is required if you don't want to wait 2+ hours for your food. The wings are delicious: crispy and not drenched in an unnecessary amount of sauce. The ribs and brisket are tender and fall-off-the-bone, and the many different kinds of BBQ sauces are fantastic. The sides are wonderful and plentiful as well, and if you get the family packages of food, it's actually a great value averaging out to around $10-$12/person, which is phenomenal.

I don't usually find myself up in the Morningside/Harlem area, but after one of my friends kept on insisting that I was missing out, I eventually found myself getting off at the 125th Station on a Tuesday evening to see just how good the food was. A rather grungy, dark, and spacious venue, Dinosaur BBQ prides itself in your typical barbecue joint food. You don't come here expecting gourmet meals - you come here for stick-to-your-ribs food that forgoes all semblance of table manners. On a Tuesday night, there was no line, but on more popular nights, you can expect quite a lengthy wait for a table. The menu is extensive and the options seem endless. There's a plethora of food, spanning anything from wings, burgers, chips, and the famous ribs. You also have the option to make most of the dishes into platters, which will add on an additional side (or more) to your entree. The two of us decided to split an appetizer (a choice I now regret, in hindsight) and our own entrees. Quite honestly, there was no need for the Chili on the Half Shell Appetizer. It was essentially a bowl of chili served with a colossal layer of semi-melted cheese, all alongside a heaping pile of tortilla chips. If I hadn't been extremely hungry, I probably wouldn't have eaten this in the first place; the cheese was essentially one lumping heap that didn't break apart, the chili was a little too filling for just an appetizer. It was probably not one of Dinosaur BBQ's stronger dishes, and was not a fair comparison to our later plates, which were anything but mediocre. I had selected "The Original" Pork Sandwich Platter, with fries and mac and cheese as my sides. The fries were average, but the mac and cheese set a new standard. The macaroni was still al dente, providing a satisfying chew while the cheese sauce used was just the right amount of creamy, cheesy goodness without being too heavy. They were even seasoned with cumin and cayenne, which added a contrasting flavor to each bite. And the sandwich? Delicious. The pork was tender, the sauce tangy and savory, and combined with warm bread and melted cheese, it was one of the most amazing sandwiches I've had to date. I was also able to try some of my friend's ribs as well; surprisingly meaty, tender, and with just the right ratio of fatty to lean, it's a more than satisfactory serving for a barbecue lover. Service was very friendly and on top of their game throughout the night. And you definitely get the value of your meal here, as my sandwich platter was roughly $11 for a generous amount of food. While Dinosaur BBQ isn't exactly a place you can frequent too often, it's a good go-to option for a casual dinner.

My favourite BBQ in Manhattan. Great prices, great portions. I typically end up splitting the Sweetheart Special with my girlfriend and we always leave happy, & with leftovers. As other's have said though, expect to wait for a bit to get a table. I have never seen this place not packed, & for good reason. They do seem to do a great job handling the crowds though & the servers I've had have always been top notch. As long as time allows, the wait may not be as much of an issue as an opportunity since the beer selection at their bar is large & impressive.

Feeling like a carnivore? step into Harlem and devour some delicious Meats!! With a wait time of 1hr, the food better be good right? Luckily my buddies and I were able to find a table at the bar. The atmosphere streamlined a western feel with a sports bar area kick. Server was friendly and checked back several times to make sure everything was OK. Soda refills were free and arrived without my having to ask for them. Thumbs up to great hospitality. Food for thoughts: Swag sampler include deviled eggs, peel-and-eat shrimp, soup and chili, two kinds of fried green tomatoes, two kinds of salads, and, of course, their famous chicken wings. -4 shiny stars Entree's-Ribs: The ribs appeared to have several layers of glaze applied. Fall-of-the-bone tenderness. The saucing was generous enough to impart extra flavor into the meat without taking over the show; smoke was noticeable; the flavors of smoke and spice penetrated all the way to the interior of the meat. -4 shiny stars Ribeye: The Texas Ribeye steak with habenero butter was tender and perfectly cooked medium rare. Juicy!!-4shiny stars Sides: Fries Collard greens Mac &Cheese Coleslaw Corn Corn bread Salad

This location is in a weird and off-the-beaten-track area of Harlem, and/but that's part of the appeal. I like the crowd you're bound to see at this restaurant. It's a really eclectic (in a positive way) mix of socioeconomic groups, races, ages, etc. You just don't see this in the city's supposedly best eateries in Meatpacking, Williamsburg, and so forth. ?Dinosaur BBQ is the way to bring people together - who knew! The ribs are phenomenal, probably the best you can get in NYC. However be careful ordering a full rack or even three-fourths, because they are extremely filling (I felt like heaving after finishing a rack). The wait is long without reservations. Expect at least a half hour on any given evening. The servers do their best considering the crowds.

Having lived in the South for a good half of my lifetime, I think I can judge BBQ pretty fairly. I drove my boyfriend far out of Brooklyn for this and I wanted his experience to be just as enjoyable and worth the trip. I can say everything we had from the deviled eggs, fried green tomatoes, pulled pork, cornbread and ribs to be really delicious and worth it. The two disappointing dishes were mac and cheese, which was really dry and the flavoring was just not good. I've had better at the Whole Foods food bar. I really hoped it didn't leave a sour taste in my mouth but it did. I mean it literally! The other was the shrimp boil. Blehhhhh and peeling took forever, and all of them were not cleaned well. It was fishy and the poop still left inside to make it worse and I feel like I never want to eat shrimp out at a restaurant again! The server we had was great. Really attentive and made sure everything came out real quick. I thought my boyfriend and I were going to have awkward silences but we never even had one because the food was always in our face and keeping our mouths busy scarfing everything down. We couldn't finish everything so we got most of it to go. Even three days later the food still tastes fresh! Crave-o-meter 8 out of 10

Long wait on a Thursday night. We stood around the bar for about 45-minutes waiting for a table. Our waitress seemed like a wannabe-video-vixen. Long nails, fast talker, no eye contact. Shared the fried green tomatoes. They were pretty tasty. I got the pulled pork platter. Delicious! I couldn't finish it. The pickles were great. I wonder if they are housemade. For sides I chose the creole potato salad and the simmered greens. Both were excellent. Dino has a great selection of beers. I got the Crisp Apple Angry Orchard Cider. It's one of my favorites. I would definitely visit Dino again.

As a former semi-Texan (I worked in Houston for almost a year), I feel like I know enough about BBQ to be picky and annoying. I have tried a few BBQ places in NY and my biggest whine is always about the meat - it just isn't as good as Texas places. But Dinosaur is really, really good!! And in general like most NY places I think the sides are totally on point. The mac and cheese here could probably end wars, it is so good. The location is strange - I didn't even know there was a 125th and Riverside - but that is what cabs are for. And the wait can be long but it seems like they estimate it longer than it is so you are pleasantly surprised when you are quoted ?45 minutes and it's really about 25 minutes. Our server was so nice and called everyone sweetheart, I love that. I would definitely come back. And with an appetite, because the portions truly are Texas sized!

BBQ in New York does not get any better than Dinosaur! Traveling all the way uptown to 125th street is worth it every time. Parked on the corner of a very industrial neighborhood is Dinosaur BBQ. Wooden picnic tables are seated outside for the summer months. Inside, its very rustic. The floors are dark wood and some seating as well. To your left when walking in, you have your seating area and you're right hand side is the bar and some stools and tables, where you can gladly fight for your seat so you don't have to wait for a table. And believe me, the wait is long but so worth it. I like being seated at a table, but if I can snatch up a table at the bar area then that's fine with me. Dinosaur is always packed no matter what time of year it is. Just more so in the summer. They have a large menu of delicious BBQ eats that hail from, believe it or not, Syracuse, NY. You will be amazed at how such good BBQ can come from NY, I'm so proud! Now it can be pretty tough and intimidating going through this menu, you do not want to order the wrong thing(if that's possible). Lucky for me, my very first time here I happened to order the best thing on the menu. "Ode to Elgin" which I think is now called "Ode to Lockhart". A huge plate that comes with their homemade "hot link" sausage, beef brisket, and 1/4 rack of ribs, plus two sides and corn bread. I usually get and recommend the "Potato salad" and the "Mac n Cheese". The Mac n cheese is sooo good, it has a little spice to it. I think they put jalapenos in it. And the potato salad is delicious as well, very tangy. Not to mention how buttery the cornbread is. Those are my two sides I always get, I never stray away lol. The homemade sausage is my favorite. It also has a little spice to it and the ribs are slathered with their BBQ sauce and sooo good. The brisket comes with jalapenos on top of it, and is good as well. I'm not a brisket girl but I'll eat it. Dinosaur also has good drinks. They have a lot of specialty drinks, one that I had gotten was like a fruit punch of some sort, I don't remember the name, but a good summer drink. They are all served in mason jars, cute. Dinosaur is my favorite BBQ joint and is worth the time to travel all the way up there and the time you will have to wait. Everything is so yummy and very inexpensive. Takeout is also available, but It's preferable that you sit and eat to get the full experience!

Ok. Well I'm not one to buy into the hype. Yes, it's pretty cool that BBQ spot other than Dallas BBQ exists. Yes, it's cool that it's still fairly new and is situated in an area that once upon a time was questionable. It's average. Maybe just about average. The collard greens were bad. The brisket was very good but Junior's restaurant still wins in the brisket department. The pulled porked should have been called pulled fat from animals - because there was hardly any pork. The half chicken? It is good but nothing spectacular. The service was average. While we were eating, we were tended to but while waiting for the check- we waited quite a while. The prices are fairly low I guess if you don't drink. The mashed sweet potato was really good. The mac and cheese was all right. I mean, it's an average meal. I guess they have to feed their employees and make a profit right? It's a cool spot but not the best smoke joint I've come across in NYC. The crowd is diverse. Cool spot if you want to try something different but don't buy into the hype because it's not really all that. Their food really wasn't any better than when they catered in the Goldman Sachs cafeteria. If anything, that food was a bit better even though they were the same items. 3/5 for atmosphere 3/5 for pricing 2/5 for food 2.5/5 for service Because I expected more and got less- 2 stars but then who am I to judge right?

I came here with the baby sister the Saturday after Thanksgiving. Reservations were a breeze to make and we got a table right away. ?The food is a mix of OMG and meh... For example: ?I had the brisket sandwiches, and the meat was soo tender...I wanted to cry. ?It was everything...as were the fries, which were hot, crispy and nommy. ?I also loved the different bbq sauces at the table,as ?they were yummy and added flavour to the dishes. I wasn't impressed with the mac and cheese and the dessert (icebox pie), which was nothing more than a small lump of chocolate crust. ? Even with that, the food and prices were such that I'd come back for more.

went here with some co-workers after having it recommended by a friend. we arrived at 8 on a saturday night and luckily we had reservations and they sat us right down. there were easily about 100 people waiting on a table and the dining room is not that big. def recommend making a reservation ahead of time. service was ok at best. we received our appetizers very quickly but took way too long to receive drinks and entrees. food was great. we had the ribs and chicken. ribs were tasty and fell right off the bone while the chicken was well seasoned and moist. for the beer drinkers, def recommend getting the Beer Flight (brings 4, 4 ounce beers) great way of sampling diff beers without paying a hefty price especially when they have almost 30 beers on tap. overall it was a great experience with good food. service needs to improve but would def go back

I cannot believe I have never written a review for this place. This place is GREAT !!! The wait time may be a little long but it is so worth it. Anything you order melts in your mouth...the briskets are smoked and delicious, the cornbread is to die for. The pork is out of this world Highly highly highly recommended for some good quality BBQ meat.

Ordered the fried green tomatoes for an appetizer..........which, I'm ashamed to say was my first time tasting........don't know why it took me this long.......but sure glad I finally tried them, they were quite tasty. ?Had the "traditional sampler platter" which consisted of some ribs, beef brisket and bbq chicken. ?It was quite a scrumptious mix of deliciousness. ?The cornbread muffins and side of braised cauliflower were also very good.......but the mac and cheese was da Bomb yo! ?For a packed house........the service was quick and our server friendly. ?All in all........a pleasant experience.

I am pretty harsh when it comes to judging BBQ, having lived central Texas and growing up in cow country. Dinosaur BBQ is legit and while the line at night is ridiculous and their reservations system isn't even real, it was still totally worth eating here. We ordered pretty much a little bit of everything, including a slew of appetizers (fried green tomatoes and mac/cheese was great). Brisket was smoked so nicely and so moist, it was just melts in your mouth. Ribs were fall-off-the-bone delicious and their rub/sauce is a light sweet/smoky. Not too much of either but still tasty enough. Not too sure how people come off so critical of the food here but my guess is the wait time is a factor. ?Think though folks, the wait is so damn long because the food is so damn good. So we got there at 8pm on a Saturday, which is a pretty bad move since it was a whopping 2-hour wait. We swooped around the bar area looking for a communal high table to open and I noticed the wait there isn't nearly as long. We actually ended up at a regular table in the bar area (which is not part of open seating) but the very friendly waitress just had us sit when it opened up. Once we sat, the food came very fast and we quickly commenced a self induced food coma. If you're in NY and craving good BBQ, I really recommend making the trip to Harlem to get some Dinosaur meat.

Though the location is quite the trek from East Williamsburg, it's much easier to get to then one of my family reunions in Texas... and the BBQ at Dinosaur is borderline just as amazing. Meat: I tried the ribs, wings, pulled pork, and beef brisket. The wings were ridiculously good. The pork was buttery and the beef was juicy. I'm a mild sauce girl and loved the flavor and amount of spice. My spicy friend didn't comment either way about the hotter variety. Sides: Mac n cheese, fried green tomatoes, cajun deviled eggs, whipped sweet potatoes, carrot raisin salad, baked beans... All good, but definitely forgettable compared to the meat. If you find yourself headed to the UWS, I'd definitely jump on the 1 to get some ribs and stay for the wings.

Made a reservation for my boyfriend and I to dine on his birthday! He's a huge carnivore so I wa hoping he would love it. They had our table ready at the promised time, which is always a plus. The menu has a ton of options for meat lovers but as a pescatarian I found myself with very few choices (really only two). The fried green tomatoes, as other helpers have pointed out, we're amazing! Our waitress was okay, nothing spectacular but relatively polite and efficient. My beau had a combination platter and seemed to really enjoy it ?- although they did inform us it was an extra 15 min wait for ribs - what!? Isn't that what this place is all about? Anyway, food and drink prices were cheap and portions were large so we definitely got our money's worth. Not sure I'd return unless it was for a special occasion with a bunch of meat lovers!

Arrived ?here with very high expectations. I've heard about this place for years and always had it on my to-do list. I was finally able to stop by this past Friday night. We walk in at around 8:30pm to a crowd of people by the entrance. We tried to make reservations earlier in the day but were told they weren't taking any and to just walk in, they said the wait is usually between 20-60 minutes. We walk up to the hostess and she says the wait time is between 2-2.5 hours. Yup! 2-2.5 hours!! She said we could sit at the bar and if any of the high chairs become available by the bar we could snatch those up but there is no telling how long that could take. We put our name on the list and decide to go elsewhere and come back within 2 hours. They send you a text when a table becomes available. Within 1 hour we receive a text. Thank you for the inaccurate wait time hostess lady. We drove back as quickly as we could and were there within 15 minutes, luckily our table was still available. This place sorta reminded me of franchise restaurants like Applebee's for example. I thought it would be a little fancier but it is not. Definitely ok to dress down! When a restaurant gives you plastic cups of water with straws, definitely losing some stars. Also, the plates reminded me of the school lunch room plates. As my entree, I ordered the 'Texas Brisket Plate' which was topped with jalape?os. As sides I had the 'Mac and Cheese' and 'Carrot and Raisins' salad. All delicious! The Mac and Cheese is topped with some type of spicy powder (resembled paprika but not sure). They don't warn you before-hand nor is it advised on menu. Not everyone likes spicy foods, right? Oh yeah...drinks are VERY weak. Overall, cheap prices, large portions and really good food. I was not blown away though. Could make some improvements.

Came here on a Sunday night around 7PM, and we waited over 1 hour for our party of 5 (sans reservations, they said they were booked that morning). As many of us came from NJ and a few from the East side, this place was quite out of the way for us, but we were hoping for the best based on a friend's recommendation. We shared the fried green tomatoes, ribs, pork & brisket, brisket and 6 sides (including coleslaw & mac&cheese). The food was delicious, especially the sides, but considering the name (Dinosaur) and the prices they were charging, it wasn't worth it. In fact, us 5 girls ordered additional food bc we were still hungry! Moreover, the waiter was impossible to find. He would disappear for a while & suddenly spring up, and if we had any hesitation, he would quickly disappear again. By this time, it wasn't even that busy! He never slowed down or even paused for more than 2 sec until he gave us the check... nice try, buddy. So yes the food was great, but not worth the prices + wait + service. I've def had better BBQ in Texas and even in NYC.

Can someone please tell me what's the big deal about this place? Went there with a friend last night and the food was HORRIBLE. ?First off the food came out way too fast after we ordered. Lets start with my plate: ?ribs were dry and tasteless, the Mac and cheese taste like noodles with cheese, and the potato salad was worse than my grandmother's. ?Let's not forget there was no more cornbread so they sent out a hamburger bun instead like I'll b excited. Soooo... ?for my friend's plate: ?fries dry and BBQ wings flavorless. ?Oh did I mention the drinks (Dinosaur Punch) was also a let down? I appreciate the waiter having some of the bill cleared for our dissatisfaction but I will never come here again. ?This place has no idea what the meaning of REAL BBQ.

I love this place but I have to downgrade to 3 starts because their smoked meats just aren't as good as some of the other joints in the city. ?The ribs aren't as tender as they could be and the briskett is too thin for my liking and doesn't have that bark on it that you look for. ? The atmosphere is phenomenal though and they have some of the best wings in the city. ?5 stars for the wings but this is a BBQ restaurant so they should up their game in that department. ? Service is great too.

Besides one random eat-in about three years ago, where I was eating banana pudding at 11:30 on a Saturday night, I can only talk about Dinosaur Bar-B-Que from a strictly take-out point of view. No complaints! My NYP/CUMC co-workers and I happily divided up two of the Original Size Family Stylin' Package Deals: One whole BBQ chicken, ?one full rack of ribs, six pieces of Honey Hush cornbread, three PINTS of sides, and a bottle of Dinosaur BBQ sauce. We got mac and cheese, collard greens, baked beans, and the Creole Mashed Potatoes. We all had collective food babies and almost died of happiness. Once I go to the actual location and eat something more than banana pudding (which WAS epic, by the way), I shall (I hope) happily update this. In the meantime, chowing down on chicken and ribs in my Washington Heights office's conference room ain't too shabby. It sure smelled of BBQ sauce for a few good hours afterwards. Bliss...

I should start with a confession, this place was overly hyped by my friends here so I walked in with great expectations, which were only partially met. I had the full wrack of ribs with 4 sides and a cold beer, not that much of a variety in plates but enough for a good night. The ribs were good but far from the best I've tasted, nothing unforgettable and I got the feeling they were too greasy. The atmosphere was quite nice and the prices good for that kind of food. Overall I was satisfied, but I should have lower my expectations before coming.

What more can I really add to these overflowing reviews?! I was a bit put off by its location way up in Harlem as it's sort of out of the way of the areas I often frequent and it took a bit to get to. ? But once we got there, we were rewarded with no wait at all. ?Score! ? Mind you, it was around brunch time on a warm Sunday afternoon. The reviews do not lie. ?The notion of portion control is unheard of within these walls. ?The pork and brisket plate was almost too large and the BBQ wings were really fat and juicy. ?I barely had room for those really tasty fried green tomatoes, which by the way, I highly recommend. ?The wings were a bit too smoky for my preference. ? The brisket was a tad dry, but had a good flavor. ?Overall, the food was good but I did not think it was as stand out as some of these rave reviews. ? Prices were more than fair and you really do get a big bang for your buck. ?Service is a bit lacking. ?Our waitress was friendly but was hardly around. Maybe another visit is needed. ?I did enviously eye my neighbor's giant plate of tender ribs and I momentarily second-guessed my initial choice. ? Ah well, next time...perhaps.

Maybe it would have tasted better if we ate it in person, but we had it delivered and most of it ended up tasting a bit dry to me. We tried ribs, mac and cheese, bbq chix, and corn bread. I think I would have preferred it with sauce already on it but a lot of it required you to pour on the sauce from a full container of Dinosar BBQ sauce that they give you with take out orders. Everything was OK but nothing really stood out to me as being amazing. I had heard they have the best BBQ but I was a bit underwhelmed.

Dino BBQ is that place that you wish you would have gone to instead of Dallas BBQ. Food is awesome at Dino. They give you a decent portion that will fill you up. The beer selection is one of the best I have seen. Both food and beer are nicely priced. Only complaint I have is that sometimes the Brisket can come out a little on the cold side. I like my food really, really hot so although it's a personal issue it's not a huge one. Gf and I went for brunch on a Sunday. We ordered a traditional sampler which brings Chicken, Ribs, Brisket, and two sides. We chose fries and mac n cheese. Everything was really good. We also ordered a pitcher of Dino IPA which was really good. As an app we had Sausage, cheese, and crackers. The sausage was smoked in Dino BBQ so you know it was fresh. we also had some Wings. Those were really good. so good that I am still thinking about them. Overall our experience was a good one. This is 3rd time I have visited and everything from the service to food was on point. Will def be heading back for some more food and beer.

I'm southern, and I have high standards. ?I'd heard a lot about this place, including one recommendation from someone whose BBQ palate I trust. ?I was disappointed. ?BBQ is more than just adding BBQ sauce. ?It's a way of cooking meat. ?I ordered the Tres Hombres. ?My ribs were burnt on one side and tough to tear off with my teeth. ?One should be able to separate ribs with one's hands, and not need a steak knife to do so. ?My pulled pork was adequate, but nothing special. ?I did, however, really enjoy my brisket, which someone had warned me against. ?My brisket was very well cooked and flavored--by far my favorite item of the evening. ? The sides I did not love any more than the food. ?My baked beans were so mushy I could have mistaken them for refried beans. ?Potato salad with a sprinkling of cayenne does not make something creole or cajun. ?The same applies for the mac and cheese. Both the mac and cheese and the potato salad were good, but not up to expectations. ? The bathrooms could have used a little more maintenance, but were otherwise fairly clean. ?Our wait was 30 minutes longer than they told us it was going to be, and they changed their minds about where they were going to put us at least 3 times in the process. ?The hostesses seemed to have a plan and know what they were doing, but it was a little annoying. If I were in the area, I might return to give the place a second shot, but this is nothing from my NY trip that I'll be sorry to leave behind.

Attended a private party upstairs from the main dining room. The rustic setting was pretty cool. The wings, ribs and pulled pork were all very good, and the wings stood out for me - sweet and spicey, loaded with flavor and moist and tender. The mac and cheese was terrific, and not the usual creamy style. All the sides were very tasty - potato salad, sweet potato mash and salad. The corn bread was ok, a bit dry, and nothing special. Service was terrific. Would like to try the main dining room and full menu

Holy crap! Soo we decided to go here on Father's Day since I had a BBQ craving. ?Yeaaaah, pretty stupid of us -- of all days!! AND I was naive enough to go thinking we could be seated quickly, what a foolish mortal I was!! Anyways, we were sneaky enough to slip on to a lounge table within 10 min after realizing that waiting 2 hours might be a bit brutal. ?Now I am a big critic of BBQ considering that the best BBQ i've had yet is of course: homemade BBQ. But I have to say that you really get your bang for your buck here! ?We ordered a mixed platter of chicken, brisket, ribs, etc... The sauce and rub was pretty darn good -- not too sweet and just enough smokiness! ?They give you really hefty and good sized portions for a reasonable price. ?I left feeling really satisfied!

Short and sweet: The mac and cheese here is the balls, the cornbread is passable but no better than any other BBQ place anywhere, the fried green tomatoes are excellent (although wholly and inexplicably overpriced), and the craft beers are really good. The ribs are tasteless and completely underwhelming. Thank God each table has a bottle or two of the restaurant's slathering sauce, otherwise the ribs would be completely devoid of taste. I have NO idea why people love this place. This joint is good in a pinch if you forgot to defrost meat at home for dinner.

I've been coming to Dinosaur before they renovated and moved one block away. The food is pretty good and we have always had the best of service. Some of my favorites are the Big Ass Pork Plate and the St. Louis dry rubbed ribs. Two words: Absolutely Amazing! The pork and beans are by far my favorite side dish from here and only as of yesterday did I try their potato salad! Normally when I come here I sip on a Blue Moon but yesterday I decided to be adventurous and try a Donkey Punch. I think it was a bit much for a Monday evening but the hearty meal balanced it out. Overall, great stuff! Highly recommended for a family dinner!

After spending several years in Central NY and visiting both the Rochester and Syracuse outlets, this is far from authentic Dino. The service was polite, the ambiance clean and bright. The food did not live up to its counterparts. I got a brisket melt sandwich, which tasted good, but the lack of meat in my sandwich was unfortunate. On top of that, we had to wait 20 minutes despite having a lunch reservation (granted it was a holiday, but still) and service was quite poor. Our server rarely came by, which I guess is one holdover from the Central NY locations (albeit a bad one). Essentially, if you like trekking to / through Harlem to not your table ready and get mediocre food and service, then this is your place! For me, I'll stick to Hill Country, or even Dallas BBQ.

I learned about this place because I saw that video on Eater NY with the pitmaster and those beautiful looking ribs. After that video, of course I had to try this place! We had a party of six, so made reservations. Although we ended up waiting over half an hour for our table, our chicken wing appetizers were on the house. Cool! I got the ribs and brisket plate with fries and mac/cheese. OMG SO MUCH FOOD! Mac/cheese was good, so were the fries. Ribs were tasty and fell off the bone, but could have used slightly more sauce. Brisket was also crumbly and tasty. Service was friendly and pretty quick. I enjoyed the food a lot, especially given that I don't get to eat bbq much where I live now (not in the US). It wasn't an out-of-this-world experience, but it filled my tummy with bbq goodness.

It's good. It's hot. It's beef. And pork and chicken. The best experience I've had, which was also my most recent, was with a group of ten guys. The family style orders make everything better, but you just may have a get your own order salt potatoes. This is the dish where I can't eat fast enough with a fork and am forced to use my fingers. Speaking of filthy fingers, the wings are great. Hot? Not at all, but the meat makes the dish. I also suggest an individual plate of brisket, not to be tainted by lesser foods that don't belong on a god's plate. There is, however, inconsistency with the dishes. ?Sometimes they are out of this world and occasionally I'm upset that I wasted room in my belly. ?This is not Texas. ?The BBQ can be great, but you may be left wanting in some cases. It may be worth the wait, but make a reservation; this is the 21st century. ?While standing at the bar for over an hour sounds pleasant at the moment, but there are many dangerous drinks on that menu and may have you sleeping at the bar rather than pounding through meat.

The ribs had a nice BBQ flavor...A tad spicy; however, tolerable if you don't like spicy foods. ?The corn bread was very good. Asked for baked potato, got small salted red potatoes - No problem...tasty. Gratuities are automatically included in the tab.

The pros: available beers, good mac and cheese, potatoes, wings, fried green tomatoes, and overall tasty sides. The cons: waiting forever for apps/food, since our poor server seemed inundated with tables, and the BBQ itself. I came here expecting excellent stuff, but I was completely underwhelmed. It's not BAD -- the pulled pork, brisket, and ribs were tender despite being served to us on the cold side -- but the sauce is cloyingly sweet, and the spices devoid of any kick. I'd say the brisket was probably the most enjoyable of the three main items I tried, but overall, this is impotent barbecue. May as well go to Brother Jimmy's if this is the kind of food you're into. It's about as good, and the wait isn't as brutal. If your sides outshine the pig itself, you're doing something wrong.

I was craving BBQ so I gathered a group of 7 other like-minded friends to venture out heroically ?(1.5 hours by public transit from the UES) to this BBQ joint in West Harlem. We risked not making a reservation for a table for 8 at 1:00PM on a Saturday, so I guess its our fault that we waited for 45 minutes. By the time, we got to our table, I was ready to chow down. I got the Tres Hombres which comes with Brisket/Pulled Pork/Quarter Rack of Ribs with side of mac and cheese and syracuse style salt potatoes. They do something close to Texas style BBQ here, with a tomato-sauce and not much emphasis on the dry rub. The wango tango sauce is great as well as their garlic chipotle, which is a bit spicer and has a stronger garlic kick. To be honest, I wasn't impressed with the BBQ at all. The portions were small for the prices you pay-- I guess you have to pay a Manhattan premium. The biggest disappointment was the utter lack of smoke flavor in the BBQ. I mean that's what I expect from BBQ, meat that has been slowly smoked at low temperature until its tender and fragrantly smoky. The brisket was dry and not juicy (did I mention the portions were small, only 3 pieces or brisket?) and the pulled pork was just average. ?The ribs were as tender off the bone as I expected them to be. Even the sides were lackluster. To top it off, the service was very slow. The wait staff was inattentive and we had to flag them down to order and get refills. Maybe I'm setting the bar too high. But compared to real BBQ in the South, Dino BBQ pales in comparison. I'll look elsewhere for BBQ in NYC, or wait it out until next time I'm in Saint Louis. 2/5

Rather weak Cue, served in a loud generic setting. Where's the freakin' smoke? ?The pulled pork and the ribs was average to slightly below average. The mac & cheese was two steps down from Stouffers (sad). ?Cornbread was dry and tasteless. Fries were greasy and tasteless. Iceberg wedge wasn't a wedge at all but a few leafs lying flat with a weak dressing. Decent tap beer selection is perhaps the only positive. Peeps: ?This place ain't happening for BBQ. ?I'm still scratching my head about the quasi-hype. ?You looking for good cue in NYC? It's gotta be Blue Smoke. Don't say you weren't warned.

Pros: Enormous portions, tasty BBQ, fun setting, a variety of sides Cons: Long wait for a table. I had the big ass pork plate, which consisted of pulled smoked pork shoulder, with potato salad and mac and cheese. Everything was very satisfying, particularly since it was raining outside. Definitely give it a try, if you're in the neighborhood.

Oh man what can I say about this spot that hasn't already been said?? The service is good. Nothing like BBQ, a smile and decent drinks ;) The food was so darn good!! The BBQ was flavorful but not overwhelming. The ribs and chicken wings are excellent! I won't get the smoked chicken again though. I'll stick to the ribs, wings and brisket. The corn bread was okay. ?My only complaint is for the Mac and cheese. I didn't relate with the hype I heard from others. Maybe it's because we arrived late like "last call the kitchen is about to close late" lol I'll give it another try before I check it off of my list. For those who drive, drive around first before picking the first spot you see. I parked in a real sketchy spot a block away only to find that as we walked to the restaurant there was excellent parking right by the establishment. Thumbs up!

Having lives in Birmingham, Alabama for 4 years while in school, I became a BBQ snob. Upon moving to NYC there was a veritable BBQ desert called Manhattan. Blue Smoke was the best the city had to offer and even that was too refined. Only much later did I discover Daisy May's, but that's surprisingly difficult to get to even for a motivated foodie. Enter Dinosaur BBQ, which I'd been fortunate enough to try in Rochester, NY several years before they opened their NYC outpost. This immediately became my favorite BBQ in NYC even over the very good Hill Country. There's just something so right about the roadhouse feel of this place. The bustling energy, the friendly staff, the cold beer. It all just works so well. The ribs are the right amount of tender, crispy, and seasoned. Almost perfect. The pulled pork and BBQ chicken are outstanding too. Do yourself a favor and if you go with a smaller group, grab a table at the bar. Much shorter wait than table service though it's first come first served, we've rarely had to wait more than 5-10 minutes for a table to open up. Usually we can sit right down. This is much improved after they reopened a block from their original location. The bar area now is about 3 or 4 times as big as it was. I don't give it 5 stars only out of principal. There is some truly stunningly amazing BBQ to be had in the deep South and while Dinosaur is a fantastic option for NYC, it's not quite what you could find in Alabama or the Carolinas or Texas. Nevertheless, if you like BBQ you owe it to yourself to get to Dinosaur. While it's far uptown, it's a short walk from the 1 train and if you're stuck waiting for a table, you're a few steps from a riverside park area where you can cool your heels while you wait. Or just sit at the bar.

This food is seriously incredible. It's kind of in the middle of nowhere but it's worth it to make the trek up to Harlem for this. You may need to wait a couple minutes to sit but that's fine because they have a bar that you can hang out in and grab some delicious drinks. I definitely recommend sharing whatever you order because everything tastes so good and it's kind of one of those "grass is always greener" situations. It's hard to pick out which food was my favorite. The ribs, brisket, and pulled pork were incredible. The corn bread was also very tasty. One thing that I wasn't completely into was the collard greens but I'll give them a pass on that because everything else was so delicious.

The mac and cheese may be one of the best I've ever had and that's not an exaggeration. I am a big mac and cheese fan- I think I have about 20 recipes saved on my pinterest page just for that and ?I seriously could go here just to eat a big giant bowl of it. ?Fried green tomatoes and deviled eggs were also delish. Everyone raves about the salt potatoes but I thought they were just fine. We were craving some southern BBQ on our trip to NY and we were not disappointed. It's totally out in the middle of nowhere so we never would have found it if not for Yelp. I would definitely go back if we're ever back in town. We called on the day to make reservations even though it said there were non available on yelp. We were lucky and got one easily and didn't have to wait at all.

LEGIT BBQ! So the only downside to this place would be the wait time and the location--which is ok---just make an afternoon of it. I have been here maybe a dozen times over the years and it is always busy, which is a miracle for the owners, because it is a huge location, too. The BBQ here is really consistent and tasty. Loves it! I go for the Brisket, Mac and Cheese and tend to try a different second side each time, and am never disappointed. Don't expect much service, which is ok at this kinda place. The servers are nice, but not super present. This place is all about the food. Don't come for the service, ambience, convenience. But if you want good bbq, and have a couple of hours to kill, make a trip.

July 4th, sure why not have our traditional barbecue lunch some place new. TO DINOSAUR BBQ! Upon arrival this place was packed. Wait for a table was about 30 mins. Head to the bar and order some lemonade - a little watered down. After about 20 mins we got our table. Service was initially prompt. We ordered the fried green tomatoes (Several reviewers kept saying these were a must). They are incredible. But after about 40 mins of waiting we were then notified that they had run out of ribs. How do you not order enough ribs for 4th of July?! Anyways, we make another selection and move on. We had the pulled pork sandwich and tried a bunch of different sides. The sandwich and BBQ sauce were great. The sides weren't anything to write about, I would've preferred to have had more fried green tomatoes. ? It took awhile to get the check and pay, but it was a busy day for them so I will cut them some slack. I will plan another visit, but they better have enough ribs when we come back!

Took my BBQ boy here. Having grown up in upstate NY, Dino is a legend- there's Dino BBQ sauce in the local grocery stores, and my out-of-town relatives always wanted to eat there. So I thought, for being Northern BBQ, it would stand up pretty well. This is definitely not the same as the original Dino. The food is good, but nothing exceptional. It's solid, but it's not worth the trek.

I usually hate the idea of a BBQ joint in NYC. I think the whole thing is a pretentious fad. ?My male friends become reverent when speaking about the slow cooked meat which to me is just as ironically unmanly as crying while watching slow motion football on HBO. Also BBQ reminds me of that wild haired douche, Guy Fieri, who becomes weak kneed after taking a bite of whatever piece of animal fat he's handed. But after today I understood it all! I got a chopped brisket sandwich and it tasted so good I could only express my enjoyment in groaning foul language. The texture and flavor were unmatched by the finest cut of filet mignon at a fine restaurant. The mac and cheese and curried succotash fixin's were also excellent. Our waitress was friendly. The pitcher of house beer, Dinosaur Ape Hanger?, we got was absolutely flat. I've never sent beer back before but I was strongly considering it. The food shut me up and I was happy.

This is my favorite place in the whole wide world. If i could live near by it and eat everyday from there I would be the luckiest girl on the planet. There is nothing wrong that I can say about this joint other than you better just make them reservations or your ass will be waiting for a good hour for your table of 2 and up . i can't hate on them for that . that is how a good business should be. if people are not waiting hours to be seated at a restaurant then that means the food is not all that to begin with so why bother. Dino freaking delivers. My thing are the ribs but i always go with a group and we end up getting all kinds of different things from the menu and everyone is satisfied and content with the food selections. I love the salad with the walnuts and the cajun potato salad. ?The Donkey Punch is my best friend when I am there. I love it so! I know it is a perverted ?name for a drink and might sound like a gimmick but this drink will punch you in the fucking face just once. one of these bad boys gets you all the way nice and it tastes marvelous. ? Great place to bring people from out of town that want to eat somewhere memorable during their NYC trip.

I'd love to be able to review the food, however due to an incident with their smoker last night a lot of people left hungry. ? We arrived (without reservations) a little before 8 and were told the wait was about 1 1/2 hours - which was not unexpected. ?So we found seats at the bar and had a few drinks. ?Eventually we were informed that the smoker was not working and that the menu would obviously be limited. ?The hostess presented everyone (there were probably 15-20 groups waiting for a table) with gift cards for a return visit ($20 value), and our bartender graciously comped our drinks as well. ? All three of us were sort of wondering what city we were in, because ordinarily when something like that happens somewhere in Manhattan the restaurant staff will act like it's your fault and they were doing you a favor by letting you sit in their establishment for an hour. So, good job by the Dino BBQ service staff. ?I'll be back in the very near future to see if the food is as good as advertised.

Good brisket, great chicken, fried green tomatoes and greens. I wasn't completely blown away by Dino BBQ, but I was impressed. We ate a lot of food and were thoroughly satisfied when we left. One thing that stuck out was that their chicken breast was really juicy. Pretty good for white meat. They also had some good hot sauces to choose from

Review of the traditional sampler. Ribs: Not fall-off-the-bone tender, as some palates prefer, but quite moist and well-seasoned. Brisket: The moist brisket at Hill Country BBQ has ruined me for all other briskets, but on its own, this stuff is respectable. Would like to see a bit more bark and marbling. Chicken: Superbly caramelized skin, and even the breast meat was juicy. As with all the meats, a little more smoke would be nice. Curried succotash: Epic little vegetable medley. Recommended. Cole slaw: Very good, but quite possibly too decadent. You feel like you're almost eating spoonfuls of mayo with a cabbage garnish. Verdict: Wouldn't say it's worth a long trek, but as a UWS resident, I can definitely see myself swinging by again.

Never fails that if you come here on a weekend night that you will be welcomed by mobs of people outside and a 2 hour wait! There is a reason for that 2 hour wait...THE BEST WINGS IN NYC!!! Greens are great as are the other sides. ?Overall just great casual food. ?Beer list is good...B+...and the bar is always hoppin so that 2 hour wait is not so bad if you are not in a hurry.

Our 1st dinner in NY during our visit in May. Okay who doesn't like ribs. Like no one in their insane mind would not like ribs. Or brisket for that matter. We went with another couple and waited for about 30 minutes. My husband and I got the ribs and brisket/pulled pork plate. It came with mac and cheese, a wedge salad with buffalo sauce and blue cheese, and corn bread. The ribs were very tasty. Not as tender as they could've been but they were soft, juicy, saucy and delicious. I would say the brisket was even better. Tender and mouthwatering. Pulled pork was just okay. Mac and cheese had a kick to it, which I loved. The wedge salad was yummy too, great dressing. Corn bread, oh corn bread, how I love thee. Would definitely come here again next time in in NY. It's apparently borderline Harlem but didn't seem shady or dangerous at all. Very close to Columbia University.

I've stuffed myself silly with barbequed meats at this fine establishment on more than one occasion. Whether I order ribs or pulled pork (my two faves), my meal is always delicious, juicy, and wonderful. Always exactly what I'm looking for when I'm craving barbeque. I even love the cornbread, and look forward to stealing it from my boyfriend's plate. The portions are approximately the size of the ribs from the Flintstones' drive-thru. If you've ever had dinner here, you know that the wait can be longer than the Cretaceous period. My most recent wait estimate clocked in at two hours! But let me share the awesomeness that is the bar area! Did you know that the bar is first come, first served? If you are in for a long wait, it's worth waiting for a spot to open up at the bar or the surrounding tables. My boyfriend and I lucked out with two seats at the bar in about 40 minutes. The bartenders are fantastic. In addition to serving drinks to the crowd, they also wait on the people seated at the bar. They're super efficient, entertaining, & friendly. A few of the bartenders stopped to chat with us, and gave us some insight into how they function back there. I loved it. They were very cool & we had a great dinner. I'd even go as far to say that with just two people, I'd rather sit at the bar, with the TVs & the bartenders, than in a giant booth. Plus, there's always the satisfaction of hearing our names called for our table as we're elbow-deep in barbeque! Dinosaur BBQ is ... dare I say ... DINO-MITE!

I have to admit I love this place mainly because of the karaoke (every Wednesday night apart from the first Wednesday of the month). Sound is amazing, set list is HUGE and the DJ fantastic. Moving onto the food: it is packed for a good reason. It is scrumptious and the portions are humungous. I love the chicken and baked beans. Omg. LOVE this place. Staff is friendly and fair. Only negative thing I can think of is when I walked out to my car, I saw a rat dart from the building into a huge trash container across the street. So I guess the rats can't resist the food either.

I really wanted to like this place but... what's the big deal? =\ The ribs and brisket tasted the same flavor wise - like Chinese roast pork (char sui)!!! Boring... And I shouldn't have to gnaw on the rib to get the meat off. Not fall off the bone tender at all. The pulled pork sandwich was alright but I wasn't impressed. The only redeeming factor?

We have been here for 1 hour and 20 minutes and were told it would only be a 45 minute wait. So far really bad. Manage your tables better! Don't leave us stranded in the hopes we'll spend money at the bar... Yelp wouldn't let me publish the review from my phone so I've now had some time to ruminate. The food was good, but overall not worth the wait. We ended up waiting 90 minutes for a table. Our waitress was good though. Oh and it's loud. At the bar and at the tables.

First thing first, what the heck is in the fried green tomatoes w/ shrimp remoulade that makes it so damn delicious? With that out of the way, I'd just like to say that the Big Ass Pork Plate is a big ass plate of pulled pork glory. The baby back ribs aren't too shabby either, properly tender with the right amount of crispy crust from the dry rub and smoke. Another thing that I think Dino really excels in are its sides - how ridiculous are the Syracuse salt potatoes? Seriously, what do I have to do to salt, butter, and tiny potatoes to make them taste that good? Sadly however, the portion of the sides have gotten noticeably smaller this time around when I visited with Bryan L. and the bf, compared to two years ago. It makes me terribly sad to see an order of salt potatoes as just 3 pieces of potatoes instead of say, 8 or 9... However, I'm still willing to overlook the stingy sides for the porky deliciousness. Damn am I glad to no longer be a vegetarian.

Visited a second time for lunch. We decided to sit outside and the wait for service was so long. I think the waitress forgot we were sitting outside or she was swamped inside the restaurant. She did apologize, so we let it go. I ordered the BBQ chicken wings with jerk glaze and they were amazing! Cooked just right on the inside, but could have done without the burnt skin. Pairs well with the creole potato salad and root beer-on-tap, I must say. I still give them 3 stars because our wait was so long and I am not exaggerating. However, the chicken wings were worth the wait in the end. Highly recommend them for a meal even though they are on the appetizer page! :p

After eating here, I finally realized why it's so popular. The food is amazing. I had the skirt steak and my boyfriend had the big ass plate of pork - their name for it, lol. We both enjoyed our food and will be returning. Make a reservation if you're trying to go on the weekend unless you have time to kill.

In their new location (not far from the old) their bar seems to be much larger, but their hostess are still stupid. That's the only reason I docked a star, seriously 5 star food. We walked in, table for 6 on a Saturday night...yes I know, we were expecting a long wait but when she quoted 2.5 hours we were like "Ummm ok put us down." We timed it, and we only waited an hour...why would you tell customers 2.5!? Obviously you are scaring customers away...I'm sure management would LOVE that. Anyway, by that time we'd found a nice table by the bar, as the high tops are first come first serve. We ordered a bucket of beer and a sampler to share. Everything was so good, I can't possibly pick a favorite! Deviled eggs, spicy shrimp, buffalo wings and fried green tomatoes!? I was in hog heaven. For dinner I ordered the House Special; BBQ Chicken Breast and wing, and a 1/4 lb of ribs. Dear GOD were they good. Fall off the bone good. Juicy, tender chicken. By far better than Blue Smoke. For sides I opted for their yummy carrot/raisin salad and their salted potatoes. Everything was just perfection! Live Jazz music after 11pm in the bar made our seats the best in the house!

Probably the best BBQ in Manhattan, and among the best you'll find anywhere in the NYC area. The salted potatoes are an unheralded bit of awesomeness that you've probably never had if you aren't from upstate NY - I hadn't heard of these until I ate here a few years ago, now I look forward to them every time.

You know what they say...don't bring a date to bbq! Things are about to get messy. (Actually it was nice, its a way to break the ice if anything.) Me and my date ordered the Sweetheart Deal for two (momentary gag reflex at the name). It's a full rack of ribs (12 pieces) and 4 sides for about $27. Pretty sweeet deal. But the food was just okay, I can't say I was blown away by anything. Since its a bbq place, I at least expected the ribs to amazing but, sadly, they were just okay.

Things you must try: the deviled eggs, the chicken wings, the potatoes and that is just for starters. Follow it up with some OK, not spectacular, barbecued ribs and/or brisket with macaroni and greens. This is not a place for much conversation as it is noisy, But who wants to talk with meat stuck between your teeth and a face with smears of sauce ? This place has its own laid-back, messy personality and sometimes that is just what you need.

You must try the fried green tomatoes, they're sooo good! ?I always get a mojito when I come, they make it perfect every time. ?I took my sister here for the first time the other day and she dogged down her food, she had the ribs. There's street parking only. ?Don't even try to park in the Fairway lot, they will sticker your window.

This place is incredible! Love it! Located just a few blocks from the 125th street 1 train station and steps away from the Westside Highway. I came here on a gorgeous day and actually sat with my friends on the picnic benches outside the restaurant. Surprisingly the cars exiting off the highway and Metro North rail that runs just above didn't cause any annoying distractions. I came a little late so there were already some appetizers on the table.... Deviled eggs, fried green tomatoes, and chicken wings were part of the spread. It all looked so delicious. I'm not a big meat eater, so I was a little wary of how much I would find appealing here...obviously I didn't have that dilemma though. My only concern at this point was that I would have to order one of everything on the menu to satisfy my cravings. They had a nice selection of beers on the menu, I skipped them though and opted for an Arnold Palmer. For my entree I got the original Churrasco sandwich with fries. It was decadent and satisfying. Nice quality/portion of chicken, BBQ sauce with a kick, and gooey cheese to top it off! The fries were amazing. Extra crispy and nicely seasoned. They do have an iceberg wedge salad if you're so inclined. But...where's the fun in that? The service was friendly and relatively attentive. I had a chance to step inside for a bit and it looked hopping in there. Also was nice to stop by the nearby pier afterward to check out the river and people watch.

Dino is probably one of the most touted restaurants around the Morningside Heights/Harlem area. I went with a friend a check out what the fuss was all about, and to be honest, I'm still not quite sure. Don't get me wrong, the food was ok and they were incredibly generous with their portions. It was just not spectacular (this could be because my expectations were too high?). My friend and I shared the Sweetheart Deal for Two with a full rack of ribs and 4 sides. The sides we got were mac and cheese (solid), clam chowder (way too much sour cream, but were generous with the clams), BBQ beans (ok), and fries (good). The ribs themselves were ok. And the cornbread was way too dry. The service was good. But I probably won't be going back to there unless someone else really wants to go and/or the food is free. If you live in Morningside Heights and are craving southern food, I would probably pick Rack and Soul over Dino.

1.5 hour wait. ?Good thing they had a bar. ?Had a strawberry mojito - very nice. Was it worth it? ?I would say yes and no. ?I had the wango tango wings (not spicy at all) and seemed typical to me. ?If you love deviled eggs, definitely order that. ?Super rich and good. ?Tried some ribs - was nice and flavorful. ?Otherwise, the mac & cheese, corn bread, potato salad, was A-OK. ? ? Our waitress was awesome though. ?Very attentive and friendly.

I've been meaning to get here for a while, and finally convinced my girlfriend to come out with me for lunch. ?Even at 3:00 PM on a Saturday, the wait was 30-45 minutes. ?We opted to take a seat that cleared up in the bar area. We each ordered the pork sandwich and shared sides of fries, macaroni, and BBQ beans. ?After ordering, the food came out pretty quickly, and everything was great. ?The pork was smoked and had the pink ring to prove it. ?The macaroni (a hard dish to make stand out) had just the right amount of crust on top, the right amount of cheese, and a little spiciness. ?The beans featured some good kick from pickled peppers. ?The skin-on fries were crispy and had enough potato in them. The sauces were very good. ?I'm more an Eastern Carolina vinegar fan, but the standard sauce was very good for a sweeter tomato-based sauce. ?The spicy sauce was perfect -- There was noticeable heat that lingered, but never overpowered. ?The sweetness of the habanero peppers ?also came through. ?The garlic/chipotle sauce had a nice vinegar twang while balancing the peppers and garlic into a well-rounded sauce that was great on the beans. I'd like to try Dinosaur's brisket sometime, but since it is quite out of the way for me, it may be a while before I can. ?I only rate it four stars because of the limited part of the menu I had, but it is by far the best BBQ I've had in Manhattan so far.

Described to me as the "Disney" version of the real Syracuse Dinosaur Barbecue, I could only tell the watered-down-ness by the silly New Orleans Square decorations. Other than that, this location was a real, tasty barbecue spot. And its location makes it feel a bit special, like you are discovering a cool hideaway spot. I know nothing about meat, so read another review if you want to know about ribs, chicken, pulled pork, and all the other carnivorous delights. For those with more restrictive diets, let's break things down: -Pescatarian: You will be in heaven. Get the BBQ Jerk Salmon, which has the best sauce/spice combo ever (more BBQ, less jerk) and comes on top of a succotash, which I did not know I liked until eating this. There are other options, too, if you don't like salmon. -Vegetarian: The Mac and Cheese is fantastic, and even though the Syracuse Salt Potatoes are just potatoes cooked in salty water, they are delicious if you want some more starch. They also have a great dressing for the Wedge Salad and the Steamed Greens look good and healthy. -Vegan: It will be trickier, but it can be done. Try some of the non-dairy sides and request some succotash on the side as well... I bet they do that. -Kosher: No clue -Halal: Less of a clue -Raw: Not worth the walk to 12th Ave. -Fruitarian: Just stay home... Why would you even read a BBQ review? Our server was prompt but not very personable. Food came out as ordered and tasted amazing, and the price is right! I took some food home, the portions were so big. Check it out... it's worth the trek (unless you are fruitarian)

I was driving along the Hudson River, when my boyfriend and I stumbled upon Dinosaur BBQ, Harlem. ? What I liked first about the place was the setup, they had logs by the kitchen I guess they use that to cook the ribs, and then to the side it was the takeout area. I placed my name on the waiting list it was a Friday night and it was bit ?crowded. When our name was called and we sat down, I ordered the BBQ Salmon, with a side order of carrots and raisin salad and mac and cheese. My boyfriend had the ribs with half of chicken, when I say this food was great I didn't leave not a bit of food on my plate ,everything was well seasoned and very tasty. The only thing I didn't like about Dinosaur BarBQue was the plate, it was a small school lunch type plate that dividends the food! I don't like that, for the price of the meals I was hoping for more food but, I would recommend this place to all my friends and family!!

I made a reservation on Open Table and I waited so long to come here because there were never any good reservation times on the weekend! So I was super phsyched, & I wasn't let down. Everything was SO GOOD! I got the traditional sample i think (chicken, brisket, ribs with mac and cheese and bbq beans). The only think I didn't like was the cole slaw but that's because I like sweeter coleslaw and this was mayonaise-y and I abhore the taste of mayo....yucky. The waitress was super nice and said if I didn't like it I would be able to sub in something else. I'm kind glad it was mayonaise-y because then I switched to the mac n chee and it was so yummy and tangy. I want some now :( PS. RIBS WERE MY FAV. SO GOOD! The BF got tres hombres (brisket, pulled pork, and ribs, he ordered the salt potatoes and mac and chee) he loved it. The salt potatoes were so buttery delish, however we both agreed the pulled pork could have been a little more moist. I personally love when they are like soaked in sauce... but that was an easy fix anyway because I really liked thier like "bbq habenero" sauce (I think that's what it was called). I will def. be back to try more!

Every year, during Lent, I find that I torture myself majorly by going to a meat haven. ?(I become a pescatarian during Lent.) ?So when I RSVPed to Dinosaur BBQ 2 weeks before without remembering Lent, I thought to myself... ?Wow, I've f*d up once again... Fast forward to the present... ? They have seafood dishes! The decor resembles many New Orleans/Mardi Gras establishments that I've attended. ?There's definitely a buzz of energy going throughout the bar and dining area. ?There is a waiting area that filled up and at times caused a log jam, but I believe that their plan is for you to wait in the bar area to get a drink before dining since they have a loud speaker to announce when your table is ready. ? The service was above average. ?I came here with a party of 9 and all our orders came in quickly. ?We got our food in waves instead of all at once, but that's expected with a party of 9. ?At the end, when we were ready to receive our check, we were left waiting for a short while, but once we flagged someone, our server came by with it shortly after. The food (as a Lent pescatarian) was great. ?I ordered the Shrimp and BBQ jerk salmon as my meal. ?The Salmon was tasty with or without the BBQ (mixed with Tartar) dipping sauce. ?The shrimp, rubbed in something spicy, was yummy too. ?For those who don't like to work for their food, be warned that they have their shells. ?SO, it's a bit messy and takes some patience. ?For me, I thought it appropriate, since the rest of the party had ribs and they were using their hands. ?It made me feel like I was participating along with the rest of the group. Overall, this place gets a 4. ?(4 for the service/decor and 4 for the food) I'll definitely try this place again, when my Meat chastity belt is removed after Easter!

These are the best wings I have ever had. Period. Nowhere else comes close to the meaty, smokey perfection that is Dino BBQ wings. With a combination of hours in the smoker and a finish on the grill, these wings are always crispy on the outside and juicy and smokey on the inside. The sauces are great and you really can't go wrong with any of them. My personal order is a 13 wing split with the Wango Tango and the Garlic Chipotle. Heaven. Look at the pic. You know you want them. Shhh. Don't fight it....

Dinosaur BBQ catered my birthday party back in 2011. ?Every detail was perfect. ?The serving trays, the utensils for serving, the generous amount of napkins needed for their food. ?Got the orzo, mac n cheese, St. Louis Ribs and some sort of lime chicken. ?The ribs and mac n cheese were phenomenal! ?Really it was all super delicious. ?The whole thing was 300 dollars but it fed about 15-20 people and me and my roommates for the entire week after. :) Having them cater my party was one of the best decisions ever made. ?Also - the delivery man (not boy, man) was pretty smokin....so it made all my fellow female friends and I giggle when he hoisted a gigantic amount of grub on to the kitchen table, massive biceps and all. ?WIN!

Barbeque this good makes me want to slap my momma. But if I did then my momma would beat me as if I got an A on an exam instead of A+. Seriously speaking, it's a blessing to have a place like Dinosaur in the Big Apple. New York City is many things from cultural melting pot to culinary capitol, but we lack some seriously good barbeque. And places like Dinosaur completes the city by bringing some southern comfort with an environment suitable enough for a rodeo (whatever that means). My favorite item is definitely the barbeque wings. I believe it's at about $1 each and the wings are fat and juicy. I don't remember much about the sides but that should tell you that it's not all that great if it isn't memorable. Honestly, I really just come here for the wings and there was one time that I ate ribs but it was super dry. I like to think that that was an off-night for them. Try all the sauces for the wings and enjoy the loud yet comforting environment at Dinosaur BBQ.

YUM!!! We were near my husband's office getting my car fixed when my stomach was a growlin (as it often is)...and in popped in my head DINOSAUR Been meaning to try this place for so long. ?While I didn't make any reservations I thought 5:45 on a Saturday is early enough right? ?RIGHT? And the answer is? ?WRONG! ?45 - 1hour wait time which would really turn a lot of people away however my husband and I (mind you he just had dental work that morning) decided that even with the odds against us, we shall wait. What's cool is they take your phone number down and will text you when your table is ready. ?Love that because guess what they have next door? ?A FAIRWAY! Ok most people dont' get excited with grocery stores but I love em. ?I can spend hours searching through the goodies. ? Back to the bbq. ?I got my text and rushed back to the restaurant. ?Richard somehow convinced me to get the Lover's package (Which is a full rack of ribs and 4 sides) and we got the trio of appetizers (the trifecta of shrimp, chicken wings and the famous fried green tomatoes). ?I thought as others thought that the shrimp was okay, the wings were tasty and the fried green tomatoes were a treat since it was my first time. ?Richard liked the wings the best. The ribs were FALL off the bone delicious. ?Richard slathered his in the sauce they provided where I liked to taste the meat then dab it into the sauce as needed. ?The salted potatoes were okay (very buttery) and the mac n cheese was very good. ? We finished all the apps and even ate half of the rack. ?SOOOO full. ?so delicious. ?Finger licking good. ?While I've never been to the Syracuse location which I heard was better I really liked this place. ?Thought it was one of the better cue's in NY. ? Definitely will go again and maybe save room for their banana cream pie.

My friend and I shared a sweetheart for 2 (full ribs and 4 sides). It was good and the price wasn't expensive. Food plus tips was 18 dollars per person and we were so full. I like their ribs with the original sause, although they were not as good as the ones I had in st. louis Pappys. Deffinately make a reservation before you go because the wait is always long. We went at 3:30pm on a saturday and there was a line. Heard their chicken wings are good. Ima try them next time.

I made the mistake of coming on a holiday without reservations at lunch time. Many people took the free day to take their kids and family to lunch, but after waiting about 30 minutes, we were finally seated. Service was okay, however the food was outstanding. This is coming from a girl that lives in the south and yes, the BBQ is much better than I expected for NYC. I chose the pulled chicken sandwich and mac and cheese and loved both of my choices. Everyone I was with also said their food was very good. Except for the wait, no one had any complaints and I will definitely return..with reservations next time.

If you give this place below 4 stars you hate food and I don't want to be your friend. I never thought I'd find a place in NY that competes with Smokin' Als for BBQ deliciousness, but I did. It's Dinosaur BBQ in Harlem. I won't go on for hours describing why I love this place, but let's just say absolutely delicious food and very good prices. I got fried green tomatoes for an app (which were awesome) and pulled pork / brisket for dinner (which also was awesome). The corn bread, mac and cheese, soup of the day (potato, broccoli, and cheese soup) also absolutely delicious. Everything was amazingly good. Oh, and don't be stupid. Get a reservation.

Our neighbourhood take out place, only because you can never get a seat at the restaurant. I've definitely spent more money here than I should. The go to order is the ribs, chicken wings (wango tango) , mashed sweet potatos and mac and cheese. Their delivery is a bit slow (1hr- 1 hr and 15) and sometimes the food is not that warm when it gets here. Once my ribs arrive burnt but they are very good about replace it if you call in.

one of the best BBQ joints in NYC. not THE best but one of the best! Parking is hard to find but you can't miss this place. Huge sign and huge ramp on the corner block.! The wait is ridiculously long! we had reservations and still had to wait close to 40 minutes because there was not enough staff to accommodate the tables at the restaurant. my party of 4 was standing around looking at 5-6 tables that were empty but did not have any server to take those tables so we had to wait forever and a minute to be seated. The food is great and it comes in large large portions! if you bring a group go for the group meals rather than individual because you'll be so full and you get to taste everything! I loved the mac n cheese and the sweet potato but those two sides will fill you so quick and not leave enough room for the ribs so pace yourself. ?the corn bread was not as moist as i hoped but i overlooked it due to the tasty ribs that was all over my face by the time i was finished. overall- the food is well worth the money and it was delicious! the wait time is absurd and the bar is full of inattentive bartenders that can't tell who stepped up to order first and just annoys you by taking people that came after you.

Every once in awhile I get a random urge to trek up to Harlem for good beer and BBQ among emotional Giants fans watching the game. Last night was that night. Dinosaur provides a great atmosphere to enjoy all above stated activities, and the food was worth the hour and a half wait on a Sunday evening. As a southerner, I was a little disturbed by the incorporation of other styles of BBQ and opted to stick with the most traditional meat selection I could find: pulled pork and brisket plate. FANTASTIC decision! The meat is incredibly well cooked and they clearly have a system down for serving their meals, which came out less than 10 minutes after we ordered. I was pretty disappointed by the sides. The cole slaw didn't do it for me, and the baked beans were just ehh. Like I said, I usually keep my BBQ orders plain and simple! We finished the meal with a sweet potato pecan pie, which was UNREAL. If you think you even mildly enjoy sweet potato or pecan pie or just PIE, ORDER THIS PIE. The slice was huge and it so delicious :)

I believe that Dinosaur BBQ is one of the best bbq you'll get in NYC. ?The atmosphere in this place is always fun and lively. ?It's always packed so I recommned making reservations prior to coming. ?I've made the mistake of coming here without a reservation once and had to wait for an hour. ? I've been here several times and I always leave feeling satisfied and wanting to go back. ?Their ribs are tasty and tender. ?I always get the ribs and briskett combo. ?I should really try other things on the menu but this combo is my go to, feel good meal. ?I tried the drunken spicy shrimp on a recent visit and it was delicious! ?I would definitely get it again. ?Their sides are also just as good. ?I love the bbq fried rice and coleslaw. ?My BF always gets the mac and cheese and collard greens. ?They also have a good beer selection and their cocktails are very yummy! I've encouraged many friends and relatives to come here and I recently took my parents and they all love it.

Definitely one of the top bbq joints in the city. Yes, the wait time is atrocious on the weekends, but if you come for a week day lunch (like I did!) you can make a reservation and be seated quickly! Ribs, brisket, and the wings are my personal favorites. Tender, flavorful, and plentiful! The corn bread, mac and cheese, and bbq baked beans are the best sides. We also had the salt potatoes (which are just small boiled potatoes) and fried rice (probably made with all the leftover meats) which were both ok.

It has fried green tomatoes, deviled eggs, shrimp and wings....the sampler gets five friggin stars! The ribs and the meat are tasty....the sides could use a little help.

I've recently moved very close to here and, to be honest with you, I want to come here every day. They serve really good dinosaur :). The sweetheart deal is so freaking good. Partner up with a bro and stuff your stomachs with ribs and amazing sides. You won't regret it. I don't think there's a better deal than having 2 dudes heterosexually talk about things that matter in the world while eat ribs and throwing bones into tiny pales. ?*Pound* *Explosion* Must tries are fried green tomatoes and the baked beans. The baked beans totally remind of camping - in all the good ways. My favorite sauce is the wild tango. It's slightly spicy and is ready to party. It makes a party in my mouth. ? There's also no shame when eating in this place. Feel free to use all 10 fingers and draw a smily around your lips from bbq sauce. You'll be the joker of ribs. I've also worn some rather nice clothes and have them wreaking of delicious bbq. ?It's never a bad idea to have the smell of bbq stay on your jacket and make your entire closet smell like a roast pit. ?These are all, obviously, positive things about this place. ?Mmmm.. bbq clothes.

I had such high expectations for the ribs here but it was such a let down. The ribs didn't have much flavor and was very dry. The upside was just the wings. They were so much better than the ribs.

I've now been here more times than I can count and I absolutely frikkin love this place. I can't claim to be a barbeque expert, but if "real" barbeque is even better than this then I should never go south, because I would die of gout instantly. The pork-sket is amazing. Get it. The wings are incredible. Get them. The chili is delicious. Get it. Oh, and make a reservation on Savored to get a discount!

really, this place doesn't need any more reviews. just wanted to put a quick note in to compare it with kansas city bbq, since i was a resident there for two years. dinosaur bbq wins for their pulled pork, but kansas city got them on their brisket and beans. but honestly, EVERYTHING was good. you should definitely share, unless you are crazy hungry, because one sampler fed three of us. the mac n cheese is the best hands down. you must get this as a side!!! and the beer selection is LEGIT. man, i wish i lived in harlem...

Wow! Stopped in on a friend's recommendation and was not disappointed. To the contrary, we were pleased to no end! From the moment we entered, we were greeted warmly and treated kindly. Our server was attentive and friendly and the food! Well, let's just say the food put Dinosaur BBQ over the top for me. My mom had a half rack of ribs which were cooked to perfection in a wonderful rub. The taste was nice and smokey with a decidedly sweet finish. I had the catfish with Mac n cheese and creole potato salad, it was delicious! The atmosphere is a very causal bayou vibe, and the booths are comfy and roomy. We came in for lunch and there were all types inside. Run, don't walk to Dinosaur BBQ, you'll be happy you did!

As a native Texan and BBQ/Cajun connoisseur, I give high praises to the St. Louis style ribs and wide variety of tasty sides. Our story unfolds in a "3 bears" quest...just call me goldilocks... We went on a Friday night, but there was a 1.5 hour wait to dine-in, so we order to-go and had the food ready in 20 minutes. We ordered the "sweetheart combo", which is a full rack of ribs (about 12 ribs) and includes 4 sides. The portion was huge and meant for a really really hungry couple...or "papa bear" The next evening, Saturday, we realized that if Friday was a long wait, Saturday would be too, so this time we ordered in. The food took about double the time to arrive and parts were cold, so we called the manager and he took care of us. We decided to go with the half rack (6 ribs total) and 2 sides as well as an extra order of cornbread. I think this was the "mama bear" of orders...just the right size. The next morning we couldn't help but fantasize about those ribs and sides...so we stopped by for lunch. Still there was a long wait time, so we opted to seat ourselves at the bar, scooped up the first 2 seats we found, and had some food in front of us in about 15 minutes. We decided to try some sausage and opted for what we thought was a sausage platter...but ended up being a sausage hoagie with 2 sides. This was decent for us to split over lunch...but I'll admit I was ready for round #2 pretty soon after...this was the "baby bear"...just a hint too small. Overall, we realized that we love the ribs, sweet potato side, seafood gumbo, cornbread, bbq fried rice, and coleslaw. The prices are really great and the portions are great for sharing. The cornbread is only $0.75 for an extra 2, so add some and get yourself some honey for a hungry bear snack :)

A friend originally from new york talked me into trying out this place for lunch as well as to give us a reason to go up to Harlem. ?After trekking all the way up on the 1 subway line, we ventured in here and were immediately taken by the intoxicating smokey aroma seemingly engrained in everything around us. ?We ventured to the bar area and set up camp. The waitress quickly took our drink and food orders and we were left looking around at the place trying to figure out how authentic this place is or if it was all just a front. ?Gladly, this place does pretty well in the authenticity department. ?My brisket sandwich came with nice thick slices of brisket with the tell tale pink ring encompassing the edge of each slice. ?Their standard sauce was better than average and their habanero one was perfectly spicy. ?The mac n cheese was certainly worthwhile with its creamy texture and bit of melted/crusty cheese on top and bit of chili powder/smokey flavor to it. While I wouldn't put this place up as some of the best bbq in the nation or even that I've ever had, it definitely was pretty good and I'd imagine it probably stands up fairly well in these northern "yankee" areas.

What's the point of offering delivery orders if it takes over two hours to get it? I tried about a month ago at 1pm and was told their next delivery person was leaving at 3. Today I called at 1:15 and was told the delivery person was not leaving until 3:30. I ate in the restaurant about a year ago and the food is okay-nothing I'd wait two hours for, though!

Had to travel up to Harlem to visit this place and lets be honest the neighborhood is a bit sketch, but after our experience here, I realized the reputation for great BBQ was true and the trip Uptown was well worth it. We did have to wait almost 30 min to be seated but as we waited we planned our attack. Four of us ordered pretty much a little bit of everything , the standouts as I remember well the pulled pork, the brisket and the fried green tomatoes. Some of the sides were sub par but all in all everything had great smoky flavor and accompanied by delicious sauces. I would definitely return to unleash my inner T-Rex.

Where to begin??? The service is wonderful, the hostesses are so nice, the space is high-ceilinged and roomy, and the food is great! There's so much to love about this place, I'm sure I could go on and on, so let me begin by recounting my one trip here. I was only in NYC for 6 hours to explore a little bit and hang out with my roommate over spring break. ?We had a short list of places to check out, all recommendations from local NYU students. ?In the debate between bbq and Italian, bbq won, so we trekked our way through Harlem to find this well-reviewed Dinosaur BBQ place. The delicious aromas that assaulted my olfactory glands were indicators that we made the right decision. ?Why settle for carb-y italian when you can gorge on delicious, smoky, marinated MEAT?? The three of us split the two-person special, a rack of ribs + corn bread + four sides. ?Good thing, too, because it was the perfect amount of food. In addition, Dino's got this chipotle bbq sauce that is amazing with those ribs. Noteworthy sides include baked beans and potato salad (super yum!). Cole slaw was mediocre, and the fried potatoes were aight with some ketchup and bbq sauce. Come here. Eat lots of meat. Food coma afterwards.

Fried green tomatoes: 5 stars bc it's more batter than tomato Deviled eggs: 5 stars Devils dual chicken wings: 5 stars Creole shrimp: 3 stars. It's just bland shrimp but the cocktail sauce it good Catfish: 3 stars. Very salty Mac and cheese: 4 stars. Solid mac Chili: 3 stars. ?Way too many beans Rack of ribs: 5 star - probably the only thing I'd suffer the wait for. Succotash: 2 stars. Don't bother! Syracuse potatoes: 3 stars. Delicious and tender but really heavy on the butter Fried rice: 4 stars. Really fantastic rice but I could probably get the same at a chinese take-out joint. All in all, I'd probably take out of towners here for a visit but now that I've had it once, I probably wouldn't need to try it again.

I first went to the Dinosaur Bar-B-Que in Rochester, NY, and got hooked. ?I was happy to discover the one in Harlem and have been back a few times. ?When I first went there (Harlem), I was disappointed to not find any sweet potato fries but happy to find a substitute--roasted whipped sweet potatoes with spicy nut topping (mmmm). ?Because I usually can't decide on a dish, I'd order the traditional sampler--1/4 chicken (leg + thigh), 1/4 rack of ribs, & sliced Texas beef brisket. ?The meat is fresh and tender (whoever said the brisket was tough must've gone somewhere else!). ?Even though they provide bottles of various sauces, I didn't find a need to use any of them because the flavored meat is tasty as is. ?The last time I went, I was thrilled to find that they now have Ithaca Apricot Ale (on tap). ?Must have beer with barbecue! Yes, it does get crowded on the weekends, especially when they have to remove a few tables to squeeze in the live band. ?That's why if you don't like live bands and crowds (or waiting a while to be seated), it's best to have lunch or an early dinner during the week.

I don't make it up to West Harlem much. ?Frankly, I don't even spend much time on the west side. ?I hardly consider myself an expert on BBQ food but this is the best I've had in NYC. ? ?I recommend the grilled chicken sandwich and cole slaw but everything I tried that night was delicious. ?While I wish that my group had had a reservation as opposed to waiting and waiting and waiting (not Dinosaur's fault--I see they're Open Table), the food is really great and the service is attentive.

I went for the first time last night. We sat at the bar, and the bartender was very helpful, friendly, and knowledgable. I ordered a chicken sandwich with fries and mac 'n cheese. When the food came out, I noticed that they'd given me mashed potatoes instead of fries, but big deal. I was starving and starting eating the sandwich. Then the bartender told me I'd actually received the pulled pork sandwich, but that it was their mixup, and I was welcome to both the meal I'd received and my original order at no additional cost. I ate both sandwiches and all four sides in one sitting. I guess I don't need to review the food any further.

I wanted to love this place for many reasons: 1) I friggin' LOVE BBQ 2) I had heard so many wonderful stories of amazing meals here and... 3) oh yeah, it would have been the first meal I had after a 8 day juice fast. I was so excited when my friend and I arrived. I had one of the combos that included both brisket and ribs with a side of yams and collard greens. I was prepared to feast until I realized after the first bite that my food was cold and lukewarm at best. The flavors were decent but after expecting a plate of piping hot food and then getting a plate of cold brisket, I was less than happy with my experience.

OHHHH MYYY GOSHHH the wings are soooo good... a thousand times better than that deep fried crap you get at sports bars... Dinosaur BBQ's wings hold their own! I had crazy cravings for chicken wings, and even though I knew this place was more a place for ribs, I wanted to give it a go anyway! I split the full rack with 4 sides with my boyfriend, and we DEVOURED it all... the ribs were so soft the meat just slid off the bones... we could not stop eating them. ?All the sides were also AMAZING... their sweet potato was mouthwatering and for some reason better than any sweet potato I've ever had, and their SALT POTATOES were the biggest surprise!!! The waiter told us those were his favorite sides but I was doubtful at first since "salt potatoes" didnt sound very appealing.. they no doubt soak these in butter overnight, it is UNBELIEVABLE. ?soooo good. ?We also got collared greens to try to be healthy (didnt work). The wings STILL stole the show though... we ordered the 13 piece with half "hottest" and half "hotter", and I could only eat a few of the "hottest" wings... my eyes were watering, my mouth was burning... and i LOVE spicey food! ?The "hotter" sauce, I think it was garlic chipotle, was OUT OF THIS WORLD. ?it is soooo flavorful! ?The ribs were good, but the wings deserve a medal! ? We came on a wednesday night and there was a 45minute wait... on weekends I think most people don't even try and just go home... I would say it is DEFINITELY worth waiting for DAYS for this kind of food! ?And its decently priced! ?For NEw York!!! I was deeply satisfied :) I wasn't overstuffed, and the price tag didn't make me gag. It was one of the most PERFECT meals I've had.

Place was packed but food was disappointing. Sides were ok, though all seemed rather dry, as was the pulled pork, brisket was too fatty, ribs were good though, about the only thing worth having. Fried green tomatoes were fried just right but the serving size was small. Service was slow and forgetful but friendly enough. Not worth the trek to Harlem if not already in the area.

after all the hype i've been hearing about this place, I finally decided to give this restaurant a shot. Man listen!!! started off with the Swag Sampler... came with Wings, Devil Eggs, Shrimp and those damn Fried Green Tomatoes!!!! those tomatoes have so much flavor i almost dropped a tear of appreciation (seriously). the wings were great (not better than brooklyn bowl wings) and the devil eggs were ridiculous. for my main course i had the bbq jerk salmon with mac n cheese, bake beans and cornbread. the salmon was ok, nothing crazy, but the mac n cheese/ bake beans/cornbread combo was a good look. felt like i was eating at Roseanne's house or some sh*t. I tried the pulled pork, beef brisket and ribs too... not a fan of their meats. the meats were too lukewarm for me to enjoy. Anyways, i loved this place and i will gladly go back when ever.

I've been to many NYC BBQ joints over the years and I've generally felt that they hold their own for being outside of the traditional strongholds of the south and midwest. Would I enjoy these places as much if they were in Kansas City? Who knows? Who cares? They're in NYC and they do the trick. Dinosaur is no exception. In fact, this place is great and I really enjoy the food here. I've come many times over the years, had catered food once, and on a few occasions just gone for drinks. I've never been disappointed. I've found a lot of dishes here to like, from appetizers to whole plates. Some of the highlights are the boiled shrimp, the fried green tomatoes, and the hot wings, all of which are delightfully messy and exploding with different flavors. As for the main dishes, the ribs here are tender and well-seasoned enough to make one forget this is NYC. The brisket and pulled-pork sandwiches, although not on par with anything in the south or midwest, are still enjoyable. The beer selection here is notable as well, as they have a great selection of local and craft beers, many of which do a great job of complementing the food. The liquor concoctions are also tasty, if a bit pricey. The Donkey Punch is strong but the liquor doesn't overwhelm the sweet flavors, making for a refreshing summer drink. I should say that the prices here are reasonable. I generally object to higher prices uptown, but the sizable portions and quality of the food justify the cost.

I was so happy to find this place (I acknowledge that I was behind everyone else in 'finding' this place) and I was completely wrong when I grouped it into the same type of place as Dallas BBQ. This place was wonderful, the building was so airy and open inside, all made with beautiful wood, and we actually sat outside at a picnic table, but we did have drinks at the bar and even though it was during happy hour ($1 off all drinks, not impressive but I'll take it) it wasn't crowded at all because how the room was set up and designed. OH and the beer selection was vast and more numerous than the Harlem Tavern. The food was great, the sides are wonderful and you'll struggle when you have to pick only 2 to have with your entree. I recommend the mac and cheese, potato salad and the roasted brussell sprouts. I had a BLT with hickey smoked bacon and fried green tomatoes, it was great, no complaints. A friend of mine orders the roast portobello mushroom burger EVERY TIME she goes and loves it dearly. All the meats were obviously good and large portions. The desserts were good too (5-7 types of pie), the chocolate ice box pie was amazing and I ate it a little too intimately and may have scared some neighboring customers. Overall it was great food, a really nice atmosphere, obviously it isn't the cheapest place to go, we had 4 people all with drinks, entrees and dessert and the total was around $130ish. I'll be going back. Plus you walk there via the West Side Highway boardwalk and pier which is really nice and you can make a measly attempt to walk off the 1000 calories you just consumed.

I have four pairs of jeans. My skinny, sexy jeans. My regular work jeans. My fat jeans. And most importantly, my dinosaur barbecue jeans. I'm a 31 waist, but these special jeans are a waist size 34 and have an elastic waistband. If you plan on coming here often, I'd highly recommend getting a pair of your own. I was on a double date once, and my friend ate so much his button popped off. He did not get laid that night. You've been warned. Don't let this happen to you. I live 10 blocks from Dinosaur Barbecue, so I'm a frequent customer. Barbecue is one of my true loves in life, right behind baseball and Elizabeth Warren. Oh Elizabeth. Those legs. Sigh. Anyway, I digress. I've been to almost every BBQ joint, and while the brisket at Hill Country puts up a good fight, Dinosaur Barbecue wins my prize for top BBQ spot in the city. Order the garlic chipotle wings and fried green tomatoes to start. The wings are perfectly spiced, and the blue cheese sauce they have is surprisingly unique and delicious. I am convinced they are the best in the city. Then go for the BBQ chicken and ribs. The ribs are succulent, and fall off the bone. Get a reservation, or expect a very long wait. Dinosaurs may have existed 65 million years ago, but this barbecue is so good, it's not going anywhere. I should get paid for these gems. Come here for the BBQ and hold on to your butts! If you get that reference and how it relates to dinosaurs, you just earned 200 points in my book.

To be frank, it's a real gutbomb but if there's one thing I do know it's that my fiance will forgive me for all my wrongs as soon as I suggest an outing to Dinosaur BBQ. No joke. It's like a get out of jail free card. They have a large selection of pretty good beer and an equally large selection of fried, braised and slow cooked goodies to choose from. I personally recommend the fried green tomatoes and mac and cheese (unreal). Best part of eating here? My fiance's orgasmic facial expressions as he devours his bbq treats.

My sister is crazy. Her latest crazy idea was to walk down Manhattan along the Hudson from tip to tip, and she wanted to do the entire hike in one day. We obviously have different ideas of "fun." But because it was one of her birthday wishes and because I love her or whatever, I agreed to do the hike with her. Needless to say, we didn't make it, but we did accomplish an impressive 150 blocks* in a half day with a nice, long dinner break at Dinosaur BBQ. Dinosaur BBQ wasn't in our plan, but we were passing by when we were trying to decide where we should go for dinner and it seemed like a promising place to stop. Unfortunately, without a reservation, the wait** time was going to be over an hour. Since I had my heart set on having ribs after smelling the appetizing aroma at Dinosaur, we put our name down and hoped it would be worth the wait. Then we headed over to the crowded bar to pass the time. I was pleased to see that Dinosaur BBQ has a great selection of local beers on tap, including Ommegang Witte. A little over an hour later, we were chowing down on hearty food. The FRIED GREEN TOMATOES were gigantic and yummy. http://www.yelp.com/biz_… The BBQ PORK RIBS were tender and smoky with a mild tang. http://www.yelp.com/biz_… Our sides of CAJUN CORN and MAC & CHEESE didn't disappoint either. Since the portions are huge and great for sharing, next time I'd like to come back with a larger group of people to be able to try more appetizers and sides. Dinner at Dinosaur BBQ was very satisfying especially considering how much "fun" it took to get there. Ommegang Witte and a plate of juicy ribs~ now that's MY idea of fun! *from 225th St. to 80th St. **Avoid the wait by making reservations!

If you are a BBQ fan and you haven't been to Dino BBQ yet... well what are you waiting for??! ? Worth the hike uptown. Great fried green tomatoes, cornbread, and Ribs. Pulled pork is very good too but maybe better at Blue Smoke. Tons of great sauce options. Good beer list. Always crowded so be prepared to wait. Also a TON of food so be prepared for the accompanying food coma... or in my case rolling yourself out of the subway afterwards and contemplating putting an ice pack on your stomach. All well worth it though.

Here's another quick one... -Go with friends that are hungry - this is not a place for dainty-eaters! -Get 2 orders of the Fried Green Tomatoes - get your own order if you can...they're that good! -Get a side of Mac & Cheese - even if you don't finish your meal, this is the best side to take home & enjoy the next day (or a few hours later) -No matter what meat you order (I recommend the wings) you will not be disappointed! Another finger-licking good joint! Enjoy!

I have been here before and it is always just okay not great but good in pinch if I have a craving, hence the 2 stars. Tonight was awful a no star night in my book my brisket was untrimmed about 50% fat also the portion size was abnormally small and the rack that my friend ordered arrived cold. Needless to say it felt like a waste of time(35 minutes for a seat + ordering and wait time) and money and I think I would be hard pressed to go back, there are plenty of other places. I would be willing to say it was an off night but a bad experience none the less.

oyee, HAVENT HAD GOOD NY BBQ YET.. still on the search! Jenny S. and I shared the tres hombres (comes with a quarter rack of ribs, pulled pork, and brisket) as well as the fried green tomato appetizer. The portions werent overly generous, so splitting these items satisified us, but it didn't fill us up. We made a reservation and arrived about 20 minutes early, but they didn't seat us until our reservation time.. DESPITE THE FACT that there were plenty of open tables in front of us. grr. BUT on to the food: FRIED GREEN TOMATOES were lightly seasoned, battered, and fried to a delicious golden brown. DEFINITELY a fan of these.. Unfortunately, i cant say the same about the actual bbq.. none of the items "wowed" me.. but i guess they all tasted okay... nothing too special! For the sides, we got the bbq fried rice and the salted potatoes.. I personally loved the salted potatoes.. they were like little balls of flavor! Overall, the bbq was average, but the NOTABLE items were the fried green tomatoes and the salted potatoes.. so be sure to order em when youre around!

The food is really good, but it's just out of the way and there's always a wait (even when tables are open). Their ribs are awesome but the pulled pork and Texas brisket just didn't cut it for me. You should definitely try their Mac n Cheese, it's really cheesy and one of my favorites. The service is decent/sometimes slow, but nothing to hold you back from some delicious ribs.

Ribs good, brisket better IMO. Sides: Mac cheese great, coleslaw good, collard greens decent, sweet potato whipped just ok too sweet.

After a great 10K in Riverside park, it was time for me to treat myself to a little BBQ. ?We earned it! I loved the space, definitely a great, warm, open space which reminds me of the BBQ joints back home (Texas). ?The fried green tomatoes and deviled eggs were a great way to start off the meal. ?The ribs were perfectly cooked and super flavorful. ?I was also partial to the whipped sweet potatoes which basically tasted more like dessert (which was not ordered as this amount of food was enough to send us both into a solid food coma). ? Service was great. We were there just after opening so had no issues getting a table, but by the time we left, the place was bumping!

This place is my place where I can get closer to the south-just know that. Just the name I don't think I should write more. They serve it all (southern dishes)- for the people that knows me know I LOVE me some Southern foods. Take a look at the menu. One thing you should ALWAYS make reservation before thinking of going there-especiallly on Fridays-Sundays. It's always packed and if you don't make any reservations expect to wait on a table for at least 2 hrs or more.

Best BBQ ever!! 5 Stars.. but you gotta trek your way to Harlem for it! Fast and great service with a smile Food: OMG seriously?? -Fried green tomatoes: Mmm the perfect starter before the actual meal. - Chicken Wings: I don't know how they make their wings so plump and juicy.. Just the right amount of sauce.. - Tri-tip: tender and sooo moist.. I prefer this choice over the ribs the must order side to go with your meal?? Baked Beans!!! This place trumps any place I've tried in CA... I can't wait to return for some more! We had at least 3 to-go boxes.. over ordered of course

Best BBQ I've ever tasted!!! I've heard the story that the owners traveled for years around the country tasting and collecting recipes; well - I loved what they've selected!!! From the avocado mix filled egg-halves and fried green tomatoes to the biggest, and tastiest BBQ pork plate. And this was the only time I liked a key lime pie;)

Was here last weekend and it was great to venture out into Harlem which is something I rarely do. The location is off-the beaten track, I love that it's right under that cool bridge (have no idea which one sorry). As for the food, I ordered the Big Ass Pork Plate with the Roasted Whipped Sweet Potatoes with Spicy Nut topping and the BBQ beans with Pork. I've had better baked beans but they were still savory and very unique. The Sweet Potatoes really made that dish which was my favorite. Sadly my plate arrived cold and as much as I hate being that person who sends food back, I did it anyway. Less than 3 minutes later they came back with an entirely new plate which was totally uneccessary but greatly appreciated! Also tried the Fried Green Tomatoes as an appetizer and the sauce was to die for! I wasn't impressed by the cornbread though, I would expect better cornbread from a bbq place in Harlem but overall, I would come back. They also have live music and wish we would've stayed for that but I was there too early. Also a plus: The bar area also has tables/seating, so if you don't want to wait, the same menu is available there too.

I'm giving them only one star because I couldn't give a zero. I took a cab all the way there only to find out they ran out of wings. How does a BBQ spot run out of chicken??? It's like going to McDonald's and them being out of hamburgers. So I wasted my time and cab fare. ?I was so mad. ?The Fairway grocery market is right across the street. ?You mean to tell me someone couldn't run their butt on over to the grocery store and buy some? That was poor management. ?I left empty handed and hungry. Can I have the $14 in cab fare I spent for a scenic ride down 125th since that's all I got?

Fantastic gem on the upper west side. We were greeted with enthusiasm, served promptly, and everything was delicious. The portions are huge and we all left stuffed. Get a sampler like the Tres Hombres if you want to try a bunch of things like the brisket, ribs and pulled pork. This is enough for 2 people (with moderate appetites) to share! Our table polished off almost an entire bottle of their classic BBQ sauce in one sitting. It was tangy and a little bit smoky.. everything I love about a BBQ sauce. Definitely check this place out! It is actually worth the trip out to 125th St. if you're craving BBQ in the city!

Seriously.... Wango Tango wings are delicious! and awesome! and any other adjective that is used to describe amazing things. My bes frennn and I came here to just EAT, cause thats what we like to do, stuff our faces! ?Anywho, we ordered wings, fried green tomatoes (awesomeeee) Chicken, Ribs, Mac and cheese, the cheese and sausage platter, and Im pretty sure those salty potatoes. ?

I love Dinosaur BBQ. ?It is no joke. ?The ribs are great, the sauce is great, the Syracuse potatoes are outrageous, and the ambiance is fun and casual. ?What's not to love?? Actually, there are 2 things not to love. ?One, no proximity to trains makes it a pain to get to. ?And B, the wait is often very, very long. ?But if you've got time to kill before your meal, sit at the bar, have a drink and prepare yourself for a damn good BBQ experience.

Walking into this place makes you feel like you want to consume an entire BBQed pig or cow on your own (yes, i'm a foodie with an appetite like a fat kid from the south ;p) We decided to check this place out and snagged a table by the bar on a Saturday evening over the summer without reservations. Yes, the wait is long if you want a "real table with a white tablecloth" but if you make a right at the entrance, the elevated tables with booths by the bar are all considered part of the bar area, not the restaurant (which means first come, first serve..no reservations whohoo!) (If you want a real table with a white tablecloth, you might want to give up on BBQ..i mean, you're eating ribs with your hands and you're going to get sauce on your face and fingers..it will be messy. no fanciness here) The ribs were good, mac and cheese was yum..the best part were these salmon fritters we had as an app..smoky, crispy, melt in your mouth morsels of cajun joy! The portions are decent (none of that small measly scoop of a side dish. Deliciousness! I will be back to get my fix of those fritters and maybe some brisket..

This place is OK, i was more of a fan, but as i tried more and more authentic BBQ places, i appreciated the food less and less. It's not expensive and has a good atmosphere, but their pulled pork sandwich (and i am a huge fan of pulled pork and tend to order it at any BBQ place i go to) was very lacking both in size and flavor. The sides are tasty, i really like their deviled eggs, their soup of the day (on my day it was tomato based soup) was a definite FAIL! Overall, not the best place you can go to for BBQ in NY.

I'll roar like a T-Rex for Dinosaur Barbecue because it is seriously delicious! The first time i tried their amazing chicken wings was at work when a co-worker picked some out and brought a little bit of everything, different types of wings, mac n cheese, corn bread and ribs... it was the best lunch i had ever had so much when I was in the area last Friday I had to find it, it is such a cute place definitely a big hangout spot for college kids, it was packed!! Did not sit down and take advantage of their drinks which looked yummy but take out took forever, i mean seriously how long does it take to make some wings and corn bread? Left there about 55 minutes later but it was worth it the WANGO TANGO wings are to die for, by far the best sauce i have ever tasted, and the cornbread was addicting. The macaroni and cheese was spicy and creamy, definitely one of my favorites. Lost one star for a 1-hour take out wait but overall Amazing!!

Went here for dinner last night with a large group of coworkers. I wasn't terribly excited when this restaurant was chosen, given the long hike to a somewhat scary neighborhood, but the food made the trip well worth my while. Got there about an hour before our reservation so we grabbed a couple of drinks at the bar. The bar area, while lively, was spacious enough to accommodate our group of around 8 people. We had a couple of seats at the bar, so ended up making a start on appetizers. Tried the wings (both hot garlic and barbecue), and sausage cheese and crackers combo and both were absolutely delicious. I had a quarter rack of wings and barbecue chicken combo for my main course. These were both solid (not as mid blowing as the apps). My sides weren't terribly exciting: I got greens to be healthy (these were more healthy than tasty), and the salted potatoes after seeing a couple of mentions on a quick scan of my yelp app on my phone. Thought they were pretty flavorless. Overall a decent experience - would definitely recommend for drinks and apps if you find yourself in the area. Would generally rate this place higher than hill country, wildwood, dallas bbq and daisy mae's for sure, but not sure how often I will end up dragging my ass up there.

Awesome ribs, saucy and delicious! ?Excellent brisket as well. ?The sweetheart deal for two is a steal; a full rack and four sides for 28.95, nice! ?The sides are pretty solid but I have not had them all. ?One warning though, if you get here on the later side expect to wait for table, the bar is usually mobbed by 6, especially Thursday through Saturday. ?Very solid and well worth the trip.

The service and the food were great-despite it being a chain. It felt like being back in Texas...especially since most places there are chains. I recommend the ribs, brisket and salted potatoes. I tried the fried green tomatoes, but wasn't impressed. Their bbq chicken was pretty good but not as good as the ribs and brisket. Expect to wait for a table. Also, they have a pretty big bar.

YUM! What more can I say? If you're in Morningside Heights and feel like having BBQ, this is a great place to go. Usually I go after a late night class when I just feel like having a beer, BBQ and a laid-back time. I tend to be a creature of habit when I come to Dino. I always start with deviled eggs, always go for a combination platter - the ribs are tasty, as is the chicken and brisket (although I've seen bad reviews for the brisket it's always been tender and flavorful when we go). The only problem with Dino is the calories...I try to make up for that by getting veggie side dishes but we all know they're probably loaded with butter, salt, etc. Dino hits the spot!

I visited Dinosaur BBQ for the first time last fall and was totally unimpressed. The ribs, brisket, and pulled pork were among the worst I've had anywhere. Seriously, I've eaten better in a baseball stadium. But the place gets such consistent hype that I recently began to think about going back. On this lazy Sunday, I decided to give Dinosaur another chance and ordered a hefty helping of food for my girlfriend and I. Before I get into the stuff that showed up, I should mention the stuff that didn't. A meat and a side, half my meal, were missing. When I called Dinosaur, they told me that they'd credit me for both the next time I order from them or visit the restaurant, not send them out today or give me the chance to come by and pick them up. Well, I might as well kiss those sweet potatoes goodbye, because I am not going back again. Food-wise, not much has changed since I tried Dinosaur last fall. Absolutely nothing has changed for the better. As another reviewer said, the fried green tomatoes taste like mozzarella sticks -- all breading, no tomato. The brisket is still tough and fatty and the pulled pork is still mushy (wet!) and flavorless. The beans are one-note sweet, with no hint of the smokiness that makes barbecue beans good, and the macaroni and cheese, which, as I remember, was decent the last time I visited, is so bad that we might just throw out the 90% of a quart that we still haven't eaten (how can a BBQ joint mess up macaroni and cheese?!). After we'd given up on our meal, my girlfriend was teasing me by trying to feed me bites of the pulled pork. "Stop it," I said, "or I'm gonna make you eat some." She backed down. That this place is considered one of New York City's premier barbecue establishments, or even a good restaurant, blows my mind. I am not a picky eater. I have been to barbecue joints all over the country and enjoyed most of them (even a few here in NYC -- try Hill Country or Georgia's, which doesn't even have a smoker, for meat and sides that do justice to the best stuff down south). But I finished this meal feeling the same way that I did after I finished the last one: disappointed and wanting my money back (this place ain't cheap either). I don't care how many good reviews are up on Yelp or how many people put Dinosaur on their best-of lists. The food here is an insult to real barbecue.

This is one of the best cheap meals Manhattan has to offer. ?I used to live down the street from Dinosaur and have tried many of items on the menu. ?I order the mac and cheese as a side every time I go. ?It is phenomenal - full of flavorful BBQ spices and the perfect combination of cheeses. I also love the iceberg wedge with the bbq blue cheese dressing, the spicy fries, the pulled chicken sandwich, the pulled pork sandwich, and the corn bread. ?Honestly, I don't think you could go wrong. The wait is usually quite long, so try to go at lunchtime when it isn't as busy. ?If you go for dinner be prepared for a 1-2 hour wait - or get take out and bring it home.

Awesome food. Awesome atmosphere. Full bar with wide variety of beers and a few tv's to watch sports. I recommend the Tres Hombres which allows you to have two sides plus ribs, pulled pork and brisket. The mac and cheese plus bbq fried rice are the real deal. Be prepared to feel like your in a food coma afterwards but its worth it. I Can't wait to go back.

Chose this place as a reunion for ex-Texans in the city. It did not disappoint. Pretty much everything we ordered was good. None of the mains were bad. Only complaints would be the the skirt steak was a little chewy and the brisket a tiny tad dry, but overall they had great flavor. And I don't even like bbq that much. In order of deliciousness: ribs, brisket (tied) pulled pork, skirt steak, cornbread, rice (with bits of brisket in it), /now to the only ok things/ green tomatoes, salt potatoes, mac n cheese, other assorted sides.

BBQ. ?Check. ?Bar. ?Check. ?Live blues. ?Check. Sauces are great. ?I own them at home and they go on many, many things that they were intended and not intended for. ? Food is fine. ?Too many BBQ places bring out food which is purported to be slow-cooked, in under 15 minutes. ?I'm not a food industry moron, but I feel like this is obviously disingenuous. ?There is no way that was anything but sitting around being warmed, hoping to be taken to some table soon. ? This kind of food should be illegal. ?So, it's not fall off the bone or sinfully delicious. ?It is BBQ in NYC. ?Just like the old Old El Paso commercials. ?Yep. ?Mixing metaphors-forgive. ? Service is fine. ?Cocktails are thin on mixology and seem to be an aphorism for the restaurant as a whole--as the bartender alluded to. ? So yes. ?Get the appetizer sampler platter for however many. ?If you eat a lot of appetizer sampler platters, you will be happy. ? Try the various "slow-cooked" meats and you will have a great time. ?You will enjoy eager, but green service. ?Your conversations will flow and the blues will wage on.

Delicious southern style BBQ, what more could you want? Ribs, pulled pork, beef brisket, smoked chicken, and more. All of it is good. Meat falls right off the bones of the ribs and all the meat is smoky and tender. My favorite sides are the mac N cheese and bbq fried rice. Have to go with these two every time. One of the best things about Dino is the spectacular sauces that they have on each table. My favorite is the spicy sauce in the small bottle - you'll know it when you see it. Geez, I'm practically salivating just thinking of the perfect tangy/spicy combination. ?This place is my go-to spot when I'm in the mood for BBQ. Reminds me of Lucille's in California. Make sure you are hungry if you decide to visit, the portions are large - as they should be.

After hearing multiple people rave about Dinosaur, I decided to make the trek up to Harlem one Sunday afternoon to find out what the hype was all about! Having spent a great deal of time in the south, we know good BBQ, soul food and southern sides. This place was incredibly disappointing! The only reason it's getting two stars is because the ribs were quite good. We ordered: *Fried Green Tomatoes - The breading on the tomatoes was so thick and hard that you couldn't taste the flavor of the tomato. You also had to saw into them with a knife they were so hard. *Texas Brisket Plate - the brisket was dry, luke warm and flavorless. *1/2 Slab of Ribs - The ribs were the only edible things we ordered. They were actually quite good; however, EVERY side we ordered was awful. *Succotash - We actually sent this back. The vegetables, as admitted by our server, were frozen, and tasted awful. *Mac and Cheese - Easy Mac has better flavor. The macaroni was barely cooked - it was actually crunchy in some parts. Very disappointing. If NOTHING else, I expected the mac and cheese to be tasty. *Sweet Potatoes - They were decent not great *Potatoes (with garlic and butter sauce) - Again, decent not great. Just boiled baby potatoes. *Cornbread - Definitely not cornbread; tastes like frozen sweetbread. The only reason it's getting two stars is because the ribs were quite good. NOTHING else was edible. We will definitely not be going back...EVER! Did I mention how disappointed we were?? Oh, and on top of our disappointment, our bill was $80!! To those of you who are interested in going, get there EARLY. We arrived at 11:45 on a Sunday morning. They didn't open until noon, however they sat us anyway, and told us the server would be with us in 15 minutes. By the time noon rolled around, the line was out the door, and it stayed that way until 1:40, when we left.

I'm a big fan of barbeque and dinosaur did not disappoint! It was some what of a long wait but when the food arrived it was well worth it! I began with the sampler which included fried GREEN tomatoes... Absolutely amazing! For the main course I had a rack of ribs with macaroni and cheese and coleslaw. I fell in love with the macaroni and cheese! By now it's obvious I like to eat but I love to eat great tasting food and you'll find that at dinosaur! It was definitely affordable and I would have given them 5 stars but it was quite a long wait! If you've yet to try dinosaur & love barbeque what are you waiting for?! Just remember to try and make a reservation!!!

What's a snorka snorkasaurus look like? I wouldn't know one if I saw it. - Fred Flintstone This has been a long time trying to get busy with the famous uptown Dinoasur. I felt it was like two sexy jungle cats circling each other before mating. I heard about its prowess with meats from other yelpers but to me I need to experience this firsthand. I can hear about how great a Ferrari rides, gimme the keys, I'm driving. Just one word comes to mind: Holy Shit! Listen, I can be happy with the Blue Smokes, Country Hills and even Southern Hospitalities but lemme tell you, there is no substitute after having Dinosaur BBQ. We ordered a family style plate which had a TON of food! Chicken, Ribs, Pulled Pork and Brisket. For sides? Mac & Cheese, Beans, Sweet Potatoes and BBQ fried rice. Lets break down: Ribs: Outstanding! Now, Ribs at other places are packed with dry rub, smoked up, sauced up, tarted up, whatever. The ribs at Dinosaur have a caramelization on them with a subtle hint of smoke. They're cooked to perfection and I wished they took these ribs off a giraffe or maybe Dino?? Brisket: This was the best Brisket I ever had in my life. Moist, tender and full of flavor. The chicken and pulled pork were really good as well but I wouldn't say yabba dabba do like I did with the ribs. The Beans? Perfect. Not syrupy or funky meat bits floating around. No, the gravy tasted flavorful and it was a hearty side dish. Sweet potatoes? Friggin awesome! They also had a crumble nut topping on them which made them pop. We all loved the BBQ fried rice which had brisket chopped up in the mix. All in all, this experience ranks at the top of my NYC BBQ list. Neelys? You better bring your A game! I saw you on TV making Lasagna with cottage cheese so you already have a strike against you.

So ... a lot of my friends think Dinosaur BBQ is average. ?However I like it and have been there pretty much every two weeks recently ... shut up I'm a creature of habit. First of all, I love the majority of the staff ... most of the staff have always been total sweethearts and attentive and helpful. I'm a fan of the jerk salmon, love the bbq chicken and the chill bowl I could eat 7 days a week. Very loud, comfortable, no dress code kind of place.

I'm only giving Dino BBQ 3 stars so that reviewers read this and know do not go for dinner on the weekend if you DO NOT HAVE A RESERVATION. ?Waited 2.5 solid hours and the ribs were rushed and were tough. ?I have been to Dino BBQ on a Saturday during the late afternoon and i only endured at the longest a 30 min. wait and it was worth it. ?2.5 hours for ribs that were rushed and a restaurant that was so busy that the service was not that great was not worth it. ?Took two friends that had never been there before and hyped it up and ended up being somewhat embarrassed for dragging them there. ?Will return, just not right away.

I love this place- between their beer list and the live music, I feel like I'm in the south when I stop in here, but I am not as in love as everyone else is with their BBQ and sides. Maybe we went on an off-night, but their brisket was dry and tough (which are THE 2 things brisket should never be), their mac n' cheese was flavorless and old when it came to the table and the frickles were ice-cold! Our server was very accommodating and attentive, but I was not happy about our order. The one thing I CAN say was that their ribs were perfect. The meat fell off the bone, as it should and they were juicy. The chicken was pretty dry, but I was able to try all the BBQ sauces. Their fried green tomatoes were absolutely delicious as well, as was the corn bread, but those 2 items, a meal does not make. That being said, the ambiance was kick-ass and I will try it again. Everyone has an off-day and my friends seem to love this joint.

I've been meaning to go to this place for the longest time, but come on who wants to venture all the way to Harlem for food!? ?This place is seriously worth the trip. First off they have a great selection of beer. ?If this was in Midtown I would probably be here pretty dang often. In terms of food. ?Well honestly I didn't eat all day so I was super gluttonous. ?Between 3 people I ordered: ?Traditional Sampler, Original pulled pork platter, Salisbury steak platter. ?That means 6 sides. ?YES SIX SIDES! ?Had the fries, potato salad, mac&cheese, succotash, simmered greens and fried rice. So the sides I have to say I really liked them all except the succotash and simmered greens were just okay. ?All the other sides were delicious, EVEN the FRIED RICE. ?The fried rice sounds kinda ridiculous, but come on trust me I'm Asian, I know good fried rice. ?And the Mac&Cheese was so addictive I wanted to order another side order even with quite a lot of food left over. Ribs were delicious. Pulled pork ever so moist and tender. Salisbury steak came on top of a bed of mashed potatoes (So I actually had 7 sides). ?This salisbury steak and mashed potatoes combo was so delicious I couldn't stand to have any left over on my plate even when I was stuffed. Beef brisket was whatever. But I think the crown jewel of the meats was the Chicken! ?Yeah you didn't see that one coming. ?I know, I don't think any of us did, but dang it was so ridiculously moist and tender and the best part is I got the breast. Go go go. ?If you're afraid of Harlem, go anyways you won't be sorry!

In my dreams this place was the answer to all my BBQ questions. In reality, it fell a little short, but still had a strong showing. We made our reservations early on in the week for Saturday lunchtime and we were seated exactly at that time. The line was huge and people were there for over an hour waiting for a table. I'm glad we did the simple thing of going on yelp and booking a table in advance. The server was super-friendly and helped us make our choices, which was hard because you want to try everything. We ordered wings for apps (not bad, but not the best). I think they were a bit undercooked and I can't say I loved the flavor of the buffalo wing sauce. Still, not a bad start. I tried a bit of the brisket (good), bbq chicken (really good), pork ribs (decent), and beef short ribs (good). I always want my bbq'd meats to be fall-off-the-whatever-it-is-attached-to-tender, but that wasn't the case here. Nevertheless the flavor, especially of the chicken was on point. And the crispy skin of the chicken and the fatty deliciousness of the brisket made my day. I can't say I loved either the beef or pork ribs, but that could be just that I'm not a huge fan of either in general. My friends however thought they were excellent. The side-dishes, especially the sweet potato mash, greens, and raisin salad were very very good. The cornbread was sub-par. This wasn't everything I dreamed of, I've had better versions of everything I ate here at various places (note: not everything in one place) over the years, but everything was solid to way above average. I'd stick with the chicken next time, get a bunch of sides, and toss the cornbread. But you can't go wrong with the brisket or pork ribs either. Also, for the amount of food you get here the price is excellent.

1 Dino.. 2 ?Dino.. 3 Dinosaur Barbeque food adventures!! Yes, I have been to Dinosaur's 3 times so far. I try something new every time I come here to eat. Their Jerk Glazed Jumbo BBQ Wings are to die for! They are so damn good. Forget KFC's slogan for their (artificially processed) wings, Dinosaur's Jerk Glazed BBQ Wings (the real deal) should have been the title owners of " Finger Licking Good"! I have to say that their wings are on my top 3 to eat wing list. Their Dino Sliders (mini pulled pork sandwich) was quite tasty too. The pulled pork was very moist and savory, and I loved the sauce they dabbed on the sliders. The Sweetheart Deal for Two (Full Rack or Ribs + 4 homemade sides) is such an awesome deal to share with another person. The ribs were so moist and tasty. The sides I thought was really good are the Roasted Whipped Sweet Potatoes with Spicy Nut toppings and the Cole Slaw. The Mac and Cheese was alright; it could have been better. The Barbeque Beans with Pork was savory, but all I mostly ate were beans (where was the pork?). Their Deviled Eggs and Fried Green Tomatoes were good. Loved their Sweet Tea! Left Dinosaur Barbeque's very full but very happy. Excellent foods! Will come back soon again. P.S - Don't forget to try their "Sensuous Slathering" Barbeque sauce. That name sounds so obscene, but it's obscenely delicious (especially when you do slather some of their sensual sauce onto your ribs). I meant the bbq ribs, but if you want to slather it on yourself, I am sure you will be tasty as well. haha

I've been wanting to come here for years and finally made the decision to trek up here for some good BBQ. I wasn't disappointed but I wasn't floored either. Sorta tasted like your any average barbeque joint. Their sides tasted better than their meat. I had the traditional sampler and although things were juicy and moist nothing stood out to make me rave about. My glass of water came with a dirty rim that had sauce on it and had to send it back. Unpleasant... The group didn't bother to stay for dessert, we went elsewhere for that.

Decent. Fried green tomatoes were good, beer selection is great, ribs are meh, brisket was meh, pulled pork was great. Overall I wasn't blown away, but it was good. Sweet potato side was really good. I'll go back but probably only for a pulled pork sandwich or to try the chicken. Also, Went to a comedy show upstairs...that was surprisingly funny.

I had a large group of 12 reserved for the Friday after Thanksgiving, but they were unwilling to seat us until we had 10, so they told us. Then when we had 10, they seemed reluctant to seat us right away. They eventually did seat us (the last two of our party arrived minutes thereafter)--it is what it is, but just thought I'd point it out. It was sort of emblematic of service overall, which was sort of rough in my opinion. In spite of that, the food was very good and well-portioned for the cost. The "jumbo" wings were not nearly as large as described by the waiter, but the family style entree definitely serves the higher end of 4 to 6. The meat was all very good, particularly the brisket, while the mac and cheese and corn bread were both delicious. Definitely a place that works well for large groups of people, so long as you make reservations as the place does indeed get very busy.

Terrible, dry barbeque - and yes, this is coming from a Southerner (North Carolina to be exact). I am from NC with some of the best BBQ in the country (vinegar based at that) and I am astounded at how high ratings this place has gotten. is it desperation for BBQ or do NYC natives simply not know not what good BBQ is supposed to taste like? The rave reviews here seem to me like calling a California roll amazingly groundbreaking sushi....seriously? I had their sampler and pretty much everything was either dry or downed in butter - again, contrary to NYC thought, Southern food is supposed to be about flavor and richness, not just fat comfort food that is bland. And why in the world was their chicken churrasco on the menu when this place is supposed to be authentic? As other reviewers have said - the sides were terrible and the meat was dry - save yourself the overpriced meal and actually get BBQ outside of NYC or go to a hole in the wall somewhere else in Harlem and hope for the best. I get the NYC prices for the BBQ (which is supposed to be a cheap wonder, not some golden overpriced egg BTW) but at least have good authentic Southern food and not just raise prices due to the lack of good NYC BBQ spots. Waiting isn't a big deal for me, but have it be worth the wait. Dinosaur BBQ could do much better. Although still not great per say, Blue Smoke's ribs were a lot more "fall off the bone" good than the dry, tough mess I ate at Dinosaur.

This was my favorite meal that I've had in NYC. The food is great, and large portions. So happy that we decided to stick it out. Little heads up: Make a reservation, or prepare to wait a couple hours for a table. We came on a Sunday night at 6pm and were told it was a two and a half hour wait for a table of four people. Luckily, the high-top tables in the bar are first come first served, so in lieu of waiting for a table in the restaurant we waited for people to move from the bar area. Yes, we had to be a little aggressive, but once we sat down we were in complete bliss. A++++, greatest food, great drinks, cheap, huge portions.

They have a better beer selection than Dallas BBQ, but other than that, there's nothing about this place that would make it worth the trek. ? I had the pulled pork, which was fresh and delicious, the cornbread was also delicious (probably because it was baked with a pound of sugar), the pickles were fresh, and the mac and cheese was not too salty or too cheesy. ?The waitress forgot my order of cornbread and seem indignant when I told her it hasn't yet arrived. ?There were flies buzzing around throughout the entire meal. ?And the fried green tomatoes everyone raves about was probably the worst part of the meal. ?It might be because we ordered it during lunch, but they were teent tiny and they tasted like onion rings. ?If you ordered them without telling me what they were, I definitely would've thought these were just fried onion rings. ? Overall, I didn't eat anything that wowed me. ?You can get the same quality of barbecue at a number of other places in the city. ?The prices, the small portions, and the terrible service outweigh the food. ?If you're in the area and you want barbecue, then I would suggest Dinosaur. ?But if your friend tries to convince you that this place is AMAZING and you haven't had barbecue until you've been to Dinosaur BBQ so you should absolutely take an hour long subway ride to have lunch here, well, your friend is just wrong.

Unfortunately there were enough meh experiences on this trip to keep me from going any higher than 3 stars. The Location: ?Out in the middle of nowhere, but a very cool spot nonetheless. ?The building was much larger than I had expected and the interior was well appointed, especially the bar area. ?3.5 stars The Bar: ?Since we didn't have reservations and needed to wait, we went to the bar. ?This was probably my favorite part of Dinosaur BBQ. ?They had a great selection of beers at prices that I can only dream about here in midtown. ?The ambiance of the bar area was fantastic - picture dark wood, the smell of wood smoke, and a bar that seemed to spread at least 10-15 yards. ?The bartender was a little all over the place, but our drinks were poured properly and fairly quickly. ?4 stars The Food: ?We started with the swag sampler for 2. ?The fried green tomatoes were OK, but I am a firm believer that if you bread cardboard and place it in a fryer, it wouldn't be half bad. ?The wings were the highlight - moist, tender, and simply wonderful. ?The deviled eggs and the shrimp were both kind of meh. ?Nothing made them stand out. ?For my entree I ended up ordering the Big Ass Pork Plate. ?Why? ?I love pulled pork. ?Although it was tender, I'm not sure if the meat was allowed to rest in the rub long enough, so it was rather bland. ?Luckily the Wango Tango BBQ sauce was there to liven things up a bit. ?I also sampled the brisket and ribs that a friend at the table ordered. ?The brisket was probably the best of the smoked meats I had encountered. ?The ribs were OK, but I would have been a bit disappointed if I had spent $25 on a full rack. ?3 stars The Service: ?Bizarre. ?Our server was friendly, but she was often hard to find. ?Also, when our food was delivered, we had empty plates from our appetizers on the table. ?We had stacked them up and held them out to the guy who just dropped off the food (we weren't being bitchy, we were trying to help!). ?He looked at us and walked away. ?We started to laugh, like "Are you effing kidding me?" ?He then came back and was a complete dick, "Is there anything else I can do? ?Anything at all? ?Are you sure, because I would LOVE to help you out. ?Really? ?Nothing?" ?Take our plates, douchebag, and be happy you have a job. 2 stars So with all these 4 and 5 star reviews, I've got to say I was a bit disappointed. ?We will be back, but I think we'll skip the dining area and strictly stick to the bar.

Often crowded. ALWAYS loud. Dinosaur BBQ is not for the faint of heart. If you don't love BBQ-style fare, stay away. If you do, come often and enjoy! I think I've had everything on the menu and I can tell you that, as far as entrees go, the pork is better than the beef and the chicken is better than everything. That's not because any option is weak, it's because Dinosaur's chicken is uniquely spectacular. Their wings are meaty and tender with some excellent sauce options -- I like the Honey BBQ or Garlic Chipotle. As for sides, skip the fries and opt for the salt potatoes -- their brininess doesn't overpower their creaminess, and they won't weigh you down the way typical baked potatoes sometimes do. The BBQ fried rice is a nice alternative too and it's something that you never see at other BBQ places. Don't get the iceberg wedge -- It is a flavorless chunk of ruffage suitable only for those in need of a movement. Oh, and be warned, the carrot-and-raisin salad is not the mayo-laden deliciousness you may be familiar with; I personally thought it was a let down.

I am not a big BBQ person but this places serves up a mean BBQ meal (at least for NY standards). I always leave this place beyond stuffed. I recommend sharing a few combos and ordering up some appetizers (wings please!) and sides (bbq fried rice, mashed yams, mac and cheese). It is a great place for groups and meat lovers. Worth the trek! Be ready to wait especially if you come with a large party. Reservations are recommended. It is always packed! I came here on the 4th of July right when it opened with a bunch of friends and we did not have to wait. By the time we were done with our meal, there were groups of people waiting to be seated.

Really? I've never reviewed Dinosaur BBQ?! What the hell is wrong with me? I've been to Dinosaur about 10 times and every time it has been ohmygod delicious. The most recent visit was last Sunday and it was a spur of the moment decision as the train was pulling into the 125-Harlem station. With no reservation, we were seated within 15 minutes. During the wait, we sat at the bar and ordered 2 mojitos (which I have to say, are now smaller than they used to be...boo). The bartender muddled the crap out of the mint and sugar...she more than earned her tip. They were the best mojitos I've ever tasted. Anyway, we ordered a pulled pork slider (warm bbq and cold crisp pickle slices on a soft potato roll...fantastic), the wings (tender, fall-off-the-bone...awesome as always), and the full rack o' ribs with sides of bbq rice, salted new potatoes and the sauteed greens. I always have this internal struggle between wanting to shovel the food into my piehole as fast as possible and wanting to slowly savor each bite. The shoveling usually wins out for a while until I have to stop to catch my breath, then I'm able to pull it together and take it down a notch. I grew up in the south and can honestly say, Dinosaur BBQ knocks my socks off every time.

This place confuses me. For so long I heard this was the mecca of BBQ. I had Dino's wings once at a house party, and I figured that if the wings were a reflection of Dino's entire menu, then maybe that 'mecca' thing had some justification. But this was definitely not the best BBQ I've had, and it may not be the best BBQ in Harlem. First, the good stuff. I split an order of 'hotter' chicken wings with my buddy. We ordered 13 but got 14. These things are jumbo-sized and really great. I'd probably go 'hot' next time, though. The 'hotter' leaves just enough spice after eating seven hat you wish you weren't battling the heat. But the meat tasted great, the skin was good, and whatever sauce that was on there didn't overpower the quality of the meat; just really awesome wings. For the entree, I ordered one of the combo plates - 1/4 rack of ribs, pulled pork, brisket, mac & cheese, baked beans with pork. It was a lot of food - I was exhausted after this meal - and I'll take it one-by-one. Baked beans: Best I've had. The sauce was sort of tangy. I'd like it if it had a little kick to it but this is highly recommended. It's definitely a staple side for any BBQ meal, and the dish here is clutch. Mac & cheese: Not great. Now, my bud and I swear by S'Mac in the East Village. Any other mac we eat can't compare to S'Mac, in our opinion. The one here was just average. Not that S'Mac is the world's greatest mac - it's not by probably a long shot - but there was nothing about this mac that made it stand out. It was almost overly cheesy, and the top of it wasn't slightly burnt. (That's a trick I like for when people bake their mac & cheese.) Brisket: Quality but sort of tasteless, which was a theme for the meat on the plate. I tried it with Wango Tango sauce and a couple others, which livened up the food. There wasn't too much fat on this brisket, but it can't compare favorably to what I had at Pappy's in St. Louis. Pulled pork: Very succulent and juicy but, again, kind of tasteless. The sauce it's served with really helped it. This was actually my favorite of the three meats. This made me think I should've ordered a pulled pork slider despite it costing $4 each. Ribs: I don't get it. You'd think a revered BBQ place would have ridiculously good ribs. But these ribs were sauceless. The meat was cooked fine. It fell off the bone and seemed to have been cooked well. But you need a sauce to bring it all together, and there was nothing here. It was kind of bland. I think I will come back because I want to try other dishes, other sides and I really want to have those wings again.

Here's the thing, I luv luv luv the brisket and the bbq ribs...everything else...seriously...is blah. I've been here enough times to make that assessment. ?The BBQ itself is definitely good. ?I wouldn't tell you not to go. ?But I would level-set your expectations and tell you to not expect much out of the appetizers and sides. The mac and cheese just didn't taste right. ?It didn't taste fresh nor creamy. ?Actually, on certain visits (I wanted to believe that it wasn't mediocre my first time), the mac and cheese tasted...gritty. ? Can you even taste grit? The deviled eggs where cold to the tooth's touch and tasted too much like mayonnaise than eggs. ?The greens were salty and the mini wedge salads were not wedge-like at all - they were just heaps of lettuce with something that resembled thousand island dressing...not even blue cheese. ?The only side I can appreciate was their garlic russet potatoes. ?Now those I could go back for. But I guess the real question is would I ever go back. ?Possibly. ?If a friend really wanted to go and it was their choice. ?Other than that, I don't think it's quite fair to ask me to go up into Harlem by the West Side Highway for some good BBQ and mediocre everything else. ?I did, after all, live on the completely opposite side of Manhattan it just doesn't seem worth it.

Dinosaur Barbecue has become one of the reasons I rarely make it south of 125th Street when I bike down the Hudson River Greenway from Inwood. On a recent Saturday night I randomly decided to check if there was a free table. It was about 10 pm so I figured it just might be possible. No dice. Packola. No table? No probs. The night was beautiful and West Harlem Piers Park was nearby. I got the Ribs + Brisket plate to go with mac-n-cheese and cajun corn for sides, then made my way to the piers for some primo seating with a killer view. I thought the ribs were very good. Nice and tender, with lots of flavour. The brisket was excellent, super moist and angel-ass tender. There was a fantastic interplay of smoky, sweet and subtly tart flavours going on. Winner! Some reviewers mentioned the brisket being dry but it was really good the night I had it. The sides were just OK. The corn was very sweet, which was a bit disturbing. Nothing wrong with the mac-n-cheese, but it wasn't especially good. This didn't detract from the deliciousness of the ribs and brisket, though. A few feet from me a couple was making out but I could tell the guy was sneaking looks at my food. Uh huh. Dude, focus! I don't think your lady appreciates you checking out my box.

The quietest dinner I've ever had at a table of eight. Why? Because we were too busy stuffing our faces with some of the most delish bbq we've ever had. What I tried: Yummy meaty huge moist ribs. Generous portion of medium thin sliced bbq beef brisket- some fat but just enough for flavor. Half-chicken was tender and browned perfectly. As for the sides, I'd skip the kinda bland cole slaw (it's not the creamy kind.) The macaroni & cheese was thick and hearty and satisfying. The whipped sweet potatoes were pretty good, not the best I've ever had, but still good. The salt potatoes were just that- small well cooked potatoes, they were fine. I didn't try the beans but heard they were "da bomb", which I'm sure they will be later on. $4 for a can of Pork Slap, hells yea! Others kept ordering the Donkey Punch... heehee. Definitely make a reservation- although you're gonna wait anyways. So get your bbq craving butts up to Dinosaur! It's soooo worth it, and you get tons of food for your buck, unlike any of the mediocre bbq places downtown (I'm talkin about you Brother Jimmy's, Wildwood, Georgia's, etc.)

Went here this past Saturday with my partner and a friend. Being from TX I thought this place would at least somewhat cure my BBQ ?craving but didnt expect much. Boy was I wrong! The wait was 2 hours for a table so we decided to hang out in the bar and jump at the 1st table we could get. Hung out drinking very reasonably priced draft beer to pass the time. Once we got a table at the bar, the service was excellent. The 3 of us sat at a long table w 3 other people that were generous enough to share seating. Personally i love sharing tables with strangers but if this is not your thing, I would suggest going on a slower night. (I've heard from friends that there is no such thing as a slow night.) Anyway, we started off w the fried green tomatoes and deviled eggs. Both were superb! I had the brisket/pulled pork meal w salted potatoes and Mac and cheese. Never had salted potatoes before and was really impressed by them. The pulled pork was one of the best I've ever had and was seasoned and sauced perfectly. The brisket was also tender and had a really good smoked flavor but had a little too much fat left on it. The Mac and cheese was perfectly baked with a little crunch to it! Plate also came w cornbread that was ok but not great. Last but definitely not least is their sauces. We had a bottle of BBQ sauce and a spicy sauce on our table. Both of these sauces deserve 5 stars at least. Really great flavors that went perfectly with what I ordered. I would have to say this place deserves 4.5 stars. Great food and portions with great service. Awesome drink menu especially if u are a beer drinker and an authentic BBQ experience. Only reason I cannot give it 5 stars is due to the wait. Had we waited for a table instead of getting one at the bar, we would've been waiting over two hours. Our name was called as we were leaving. Other than that, I think their brisket and cornbread were still better than other places in the city. Just wish they had another location closer with a shorter wait.

Food was really good here when I went. Mac & Cheese was on point and the ribs were slamming. Not sure if this is part of the theme of the place but I didn't really like the way the staff was dressed. They were so casual that you almost ?wouldn't be able to distinguish them from regular guests walking through the aisles. It didn't bother me that much but just figured I'd mention it. I'd definitely come back if I were back in Harlem.

All the hype just doesn't do it for me anymore. ?I recalled having a really great time many moon years ago, licking the ribs and wings off the bones. Live music till midnight this time around was more deafening than entertaining. ?The fried green tomatoes, ribs and wings are luckily still decent. It's a place for a fun night out, not a place for a peaceful dinner.

After not having a single July 4th backyard BBQ invite, my GF Sarah and I decided to try our luck at Dinosaur BBQ... and boy, was it worth it! Firstly, if you are intending to go there at a sane hour, make sure you make reservations; otherwise you will be waiting a looong time for a table. We had reservations and we still waited 15 minutes for our table. Once seated though, the noshing began... Fried Green tomatoes = Awesome - we actually got another order. Honey BBQ Wings = reallly good and smooth BBQ Brisket - Nicely done with minimal fat BBQ Ribs - Mmmmmmm Mac and Cheese - Double Yumm... A home run!! I had roasted potatoes that was recommended as a side dish, and it was just OK. Sarah had the lettuce wedge (good), and the fresh cut fries, which she was not impressed with. Seems so far the Mac and Cheese is the side dish to get... cheesy deli-sh and a bit of a kick to it. I will try the baked beans next time, which seems to be by far the most ordered side dish (after the mac and cheese). I am truly looking forward for my cholesterol levels to drop to normal so that I can again visit this BBQ Mecca. Very happy that they deliver also...

Delicious BBQ, great Beer selection 30+ beers, cans, draft & bottles. Loved the pulled pork sandwich, so great with the soft burger bun, places try to do it with ciabatta or something harder, just isn't the same Great for sharing, the ambiance is awesome, not too loud. The service is really relaxed, it's a great place to meet friends. If you are coming from NJ or driving, safe a few minutes for parking, the parking isn't crazy but there are alot of hills. THEY ARE OPENING A DINOSAUR BBQ IN NEWARK,NJ NEAR THE PRUDENTIAL CENTER!!!

Aight so here's the thing. ?Dinosaur has pretty good bbq, but it also has an expectations-setting problem. ?When you order a 'Big-Ass Pork Plate' that advertises said pork as being 'piled high,' it's kind of a drag when you are presented with a pretty shallow serving of pulled-pork that is really just normal-ass sized. ?It was good pork, though, made better by Dino's sauces. The pork ribs were also good, but should bbq meat be that mushy? ?Had these ribs been cooked well past the point of juicy tenderness? ?If you have to ask... The sides are solid. ?Mac n' cheese and pork n' beans were the winners. I'd go back if I were in the nabe, but I so rarely am.

Uhh?? Wasn't this place on 131st street at one point?? Either way it was great this time around. Since it was a Sunday, I didn't expect the restaurant to be packed wall to wall... turns out it was. The wait ?for a table was going to be like 90 minutes which was a little too much for me to handle. Lucky enough we got a seat at the bar, and it was on. After I scraped my plate the 'itis' set in pretty quickly. The food coma was worth it but I still can't remember the train ride home.

I'm not sure what happened but Dino fell off! I think it must have gotten too popular as most establishments do and then they fall off. ?Well, it was good while it lasted but once the location in Harlem moved across the street, the food is not as good as it used to be. The brisket was dry :( The ribs had too much fat on them and the potatoes were not drowning in butter...My heart hurts writing this but I had to update it. I'll try it again in the next year maybe. The rum punch was still on point tho!

I came here for a big bday party. ?Make sure to make your reservation in advance for large parties, week nights are the best nights to go (Mon-Thurs). ?Even then it can still get loud, or maybe it was just my party? ?Apologies if you overheard our conversation about pooping. I was glad we came on a week night, as we were allowed to order off the regular menu, instead of their Prix Fixe. ?Our mission was to try everything and to stuff our faces full of BBQ goodness. ? We tried every kind of appetizer they had. ? Here are the most memorable: Fried Green Tomatoes Wango Tango Wings (Mild) Chili on the Half shell (Nachos?) - Really good! For the mains, we just stuck to the BBQ meats. ?We said nay to the chicken & sammiches. The ribs were good, not falling off the bones but there definitely is smokey flavor, and the rub on it went through and through. ?They weren't dry, which is important. The Pulled pork was excellent, perfectly done. None of us really enjoyed the beef brisket. ?It was quite dry. ?This was the only meat remaining on the table. Sides: All were good, no complaints. ? The sweet tea was too sweet though. ?Not recommended unless you like drinking packets of sugar. Drinks at the bar were nice & easy. ?Specialty made drinks by the friendly bartenders. ?I liked my vodka lemonade with a hint of blueberry! ?I asked for an option other than beer and they came through with an excellent concoction. ? Would I come here again? ?Sure but I wouldn't recommend coming as a duo. ?You definitely need a party of 6 or more to get a good variety of BBQ goodness. ?I just wish this place was closer to the city. ?The Bronx is just way too far out of the way.

Maybe ya'll didn't have parents that made real BBQ or maybe my taste buds are "tastefully challenged" but this is the wackest BBQ place in the city. I want to love it. ?I really do. The wait isn't worth the experience. The sauce isn't that fantastic. The mac and cheese = wack and please. ?I jdon't get what I missed. Don't give me the "oh you had it one time" excuse - I have been here about three times and yup still not feeling it. I just think you guys need to go to North Carolina or something because this place is not that amazing. The drinks are awesome but yeah. Thumbs downish :(

Oh. My. God. Best BBQ in NYC. I've been to many, such as Hill Country, Daisy Mays, Rub, Blue Smoke, and Brother Jimmy's. None of these are bad, but only Dinosaur is not just great, but spectacular. We started off with a combo app platter. The deviled eggs were yummy. The fried green tomatoes were the best I have ever had. The shrimp was yummy. And the wings were yummy. Not that it has anything to do with BBQ, but it was a real treat to find Dogfish Head 90 minute IPA on tap. Awesome beer, one that can rarely be found on tap in NY. I've been to a few places that had it only to run out before I could get some. Now, onto the entree. I had big eyes and got a combo platter. The sausage was great. The brisket was great. And the ribs were freaking awesome. I could have drooled and felt good about it. The meat fell right off the bones and there was plenty of it. I also had the mac n cheese and BBQ beans on the side. Both were really good. Everyone who likes BBQ must go to Dino.

I finally got to try this place for the first time since my last attempt a few months back.... when I found out the hard way that they were no longer at the original location....and to further find out once I arrived back home that they had just relocated down a few blocks.....shame on me.....It would be a while before I would be back that way......but the wait would be well worth it!!!! The only negative that I could say at this point would be the lack of a parking lot and the street parking ......it was nearly non existent. But hey.....it is Manhattan!!!! The moment I walked on the block I could smell the BBQ..and it got me drooling immediately....I couldn't wait to get inside and chow down.....it wasn't overly crowded...it seemed like I walked in at the tail end of the lunch rush. I was seated quickly by the bar area and scanned the menu .....so many choices...only one mouth and stomach.....S#!T !!!!!! The decision was clear right away that it wouldn't be an easy one! After looking at the menu...and not wanting to be greedy...I opted for the " Ode to Elgin "....Sausage, Brisket and Ribs w/ two sides ( Mac and Cheese and Salt Potatoes)....All of these items did not disappoint me in the least....the Brisket was juicy, the ribs were soft and fell right off the bone and the sausage had a nice smoky snap to it....the Mac and Cheese was one of the best I've tasted in a long time... and my Sam Adams perfectly complimented my awesome BBQ lunch!!! Will I ever go back here....absolutely!!!!! ?I just might take the subway next time....this way I can have more than one Sammy Adams!!!! The best BBQ I've had in years!!!!

I ate here with some friends a few nights ago and was pleasantly surprised. The food was solid and good. I probably would have given it 3.5 stars, except our waitress was fantastic! She was so pleasant, and incredibly busy, but maintained a sweet even disposition all night. It was quite possibly the best, nicest service I have ever gotten in NYC. I had arrived about 40 minutes late and the rest of my larger party had already ordered, but she managed to bring my food just minutes after theirs. ?Very impressive. The pulled pork and the brisket were delicious, and the ribs had a very good, smoky flavor, but they were a bit dry. The cole slaw and the greens were very good and the chicken wings were amazing! I would definitely come back.

Finding decent BBQ in NYC can really be a chore especially if you spent as much time down south as I have. Nothing up here can really compare to it. I've been to Dinosaur several times and although it is not the south, it's very tough to find a weak link in any of their food here. This place is cooking on all cylinders. I admit when you first walk in here it looks like the Disneyland of all BBQ joints. The place is huge and seems really out of place in the Harlem area. I'm not one to complain about ample room at a restaurant in NYC when most restaurants pack the tables in like a can of sardines. This is a place where big eaters come to eat and are greatly rewarded. I looked at the items on the menu like a kid looking over his letter to Santa Claus. I want, I want, I want, was all I could think. I work out so I can eat. So I decided to spoil myself. Why not? Like Bill Parcels said: "This what you work all off season for. This is why you lift all them weights. This is why you do all that." Here's what my feedbag consisted of: 1/2 rack of pork ribs Brisket Platter side of mac, side of, sweet mashed pot., side of potato salad, 2 cornbread. When I gauge a BBQ place I gauge it on how good the ribs are. Although they did not fall off the bone they were pretty darn good and tasty. I barely needed to put any BBQ sauce on them which is a great sign. What was also nice about the place was that you could order many different sizes for the ribs. You could order anywhere from 1/4 rack to a full rack. This place knows what a standard full rack is supposed to look like. I have been to many other places where you ask for a full rack and you get maybe three ribs total. Somebody needs to come up with an industry standard. The beef brisket here was delicious. It's not nearly as good as the moist brisket at Hill Country but it is way better than their lean brisket. Again, I barely had to use any BBQ sauce on it. Both the ribs and the brisket platter came with two sides, which you don't get at Hill Country without having to get chicken. When I go BBQ, I don't go there for chicken. I'm not on a diet. The sides were all outstanding. You know how you go to some places and the sides are all kinda just average filler? Here they really put a lot into the sides. The mac and cheese was the best side of mac I have gotten anywhere. Had a slight spicy kick to it which I liked. The sweet mashed potatoes were also tasty. Potato salad was also pretty good and well made. Wasn't the typical sloppy goopy potato salad you normally get at places. The cornbread.....well it's cornbread....can't go wrong and it was good. There is no question that I will come back here. As I write this I am getting hungry just thinking about it. Well worth the journey to Harlem. Sometimes you have to go further north to get a decent taste of the south. *FYI: Do not even think about parking in the Fairway Market parking lot! You leave you car there and you might not find it when you come back. They are on you in seconds.

Good beer selection, but the food left me wondering if they're serious about BBQ. Most of the dishes were bad, but they come out sauced up and not dry. I prefer adding my own sauces. The Mac n Cheese was terrible: think of macaroni salad with cheese wiz added--lame. A friends band played and that was fun. The acoustics aren't bad and the crowd loved them. Would I go back. Yes. Like I said, the beer selection is pretty good pickins'

Bottom line: 3.5 stars It's a haul to get here from Park Slope, but we did it and I'm happy we did bc now I can cross it off the list. BBQ itself was good but not life altering. The Fried Green Tomatoes were perfect. The whole experience is worth the price, and maybe even the trip. The food: - Fried Green Tomatoes - unparalleled. Absolutely amazing. - Mac n Cheese - gooey and good - no fancy cheeses or truffle oil, but a good solid mac n cheese - Beans - okay. Kind of wish I got the collard greens - Sampler bbq platter: Good. Ribs were very good but didn't change my world - maybe I'd been spoiled in the South, but I was looking for falling-off-the-bone. Chicken - basic. Okay. Brisket- a little dry. Sauces are excellent and add a couple of points to the meat for sure. Other things I liked: -the neighborhood is cool and historical - Cotton Club, Apollo, etc -the space overall is HUGE, which is a nice change -the bar/waiting area -the service was quick and efficient -the price -Most of all, and at the risk of repeating myself and of mis-categorizing, the Fried Green Tomatoes. Most Important: Yes, go at least once (and if you live close, I encourage you to go some more), and make sure to get the FGT.

The first time I ate Dinosaur BBQ wings, I was convinced they were the best wings I had ever had. But for years, I feared my judgment had been compromised, because of the circumstances in which I ate them. I had been in my friend's Harlem apartment, downing an enormous bucket of gin, while the New York Football Giants drove down the field to snatch victory from the Patriots in the Greatest SuperBowl Ever. It was glorious. However, I'm sure that rancid garbage would have tasted terrific, as long as it was seasoned with the salty tears of Boston's shame. In my recent return trip to Dinosaur, I learned a few things that I would like to share with you now, in this next segment that I call "Seven Things I Learned at Dinosaur BBQ." 1. My judgment was not clouded; they do in fact have FANTASTIC wings. If you don't like these wings, there is something wrong with you. 2. Steve is a dick and nobody likes him.* 3. The ribs are also wonderful. So much meaty flavor that they don't need extra saucing. But extra saucing never hurt anyone either. 4. Jane can't peel shrimp. Jane can, however, fling bits of shrimp across the table onto your shirt with great aplomb. 5. If at all possible, you should get here for lunch. You won't be able to keep yourself from ordering entirely too much meat for a midday meal, but there are no crowds. And if you're worried about the food coma factor, I promise that you will still be able to get work done when you get back to the office.** 6. The fried green tomatoes are solid, but I've had better. 7. At around $20 a person, it wasn't a cheap lunch. But when you factor in that I didn't eat dinner because I was too stuffed...that's a damn good deal. _______ *This is according to the bathroom walls, which never lie. **Provided your only responsibilities consist of sitting at your desk, holding your stomach, and moaning.

The first Thurday (give or take a Thursday) of each month is my dinner group night. ?We have a round robin, where each month a different person picks a restaurant and we go out and chow. ?The group consists of four tech nerds (well, three plus me, because I AM NO NERD, nope. NO WAY. Notttt me, no), and the group has been going with some semblance of consistency since about 1998. Thursday, April 10, 2008 took us to Dinosaur Bar-B-Que, the choice of another member of the group. The answer is NO, they don't serve Bronto Burgers there, Wilma. Sheesh. So, what makes good barbeque? Ya know what? I have no freakin' idea. Why? Because I'm a Yankee, of course. I mean seriously, what do Yankees know about barbeque? NOTHING. We leave real knowledge of that stuff to our friends south of the Mason-Dixon. You wouldn't expect to a Texan to know what good pizza is, now wouldja? HELL NO! Fer chrissakes, they think Pizza Hut is ACTUALLY PIZZA. AYYYYYYY KNOW! (in the words of the immortal Craig Ferguson, who by the way, is my hero). I've eaten barbeque more than a few times in my life and this was definitely one of them. Highlights and lowlights: 1. The Mac n' Cheese was freakin' SPIRITUAL. TO. DIE. FOR. (get several portions of that on the side, or better yet, see if you can sneak into the kitchen and snarfle your head around the pan, it's that good. YES, I said SNARFLE. Get over it.) 2. The Deviled Eggs were also UNBELIEVABLE. My mouth is watering just thinking about them. I'm also the kind of guy who likes Miracle Whip, so that might explain it. 3. It's a bit of a tradition with this group to have a bourbon before dinner, usually something boutique, often Knob Creek, Woodford Reserve, or something of that Ilk. They didn't have either of these as an option, so we asked for a recommendation from the waitress. Mistake-o numero uno. She made the fateful choice of recommending Wild Turkey "Honey" Bourbon. ?If you: a) like cough medicine b) like to hurl c) like sickly sweet liqueur-type libations. d) like the idea of going into insulin shock. e) don't have Diabletes but have really been considering it as a lifestyle option. THEN... YOU MIGHT ACTUALLY LIKE THIS DEEESGUSTING BOURBON. Come to think of it, calling it "bourbon" is s sacrilege, and an affront to any decent, upstanding, real live bourbon made on the planet. Do you um, get the idea that I didn't like it? I only wish I could have taken pictures of the faces that were made while we were forcing ourselves to drink it just to get done with it. WOOOOOoooOOOF. But I digress. 4. The ribs were tasty. They were pork.They had barbeque sauce on them. There were several other kinds of barbeque sauce on the table that I managed to slather all over my ribs with aplomb. I also added some of their nice habanero hot sauce. ?The meat fell off the ribs with a modicum of effort. To my naive, ignorant Yankee palate, these were good ribs. Extremely tasty. 6. The Brisket was good, if unremarkable. 7. The Pulled Pork (dunno why, but I always get a really nasty picture in my head every time I see, hear or say that) was quite good, tender, and juicy. I'd go back for that as well. 8. They had these "Salt" potatoes that looked like monkey balls. ?They were pretty tasty as well, but let me tell you they tasted NOTHING like actual monkey balls. I've come to the conclusion that they were probably potatoes after all. We were far too full for desert. All in all, it was a very successful food evening. The trek is worth it, and there are lots of um, attractive Columbia students there as scenery. As a bonus, you can go to Fairway afterwards and get your cheese on. Fantastico.

Wow did I sleep on Dinosaur!? I've been living in Harlem for over a year now and I finally made my way over to this restaurant. Oh I've heard the stories but I didn't like trekking over there to go to Fairway for essentials ... what makes you think I want to go there to indulge in bar-b-que? I don't even eat pork or beef? Well slap me up and call me Patty cause I'm singing a different tune. My roommate and I dined on a Christmas feast. She had a half rack and I had a 1/2 chicken. Freaking amazing bar-b-que. And I know this place is kind of novel/touristy but I'm really into it. And at least there isn't one in every district. (*ahem* DALLAS BBQ *cough**cough*) Dinosaur is special and affordable to boot! Sidenote: While I was in the graffitied bathroom washing my hands, some white lady came in and asked me if "we were always this busy." I shouldn't have responded, "I don't know, I don't work here." Because "Oh I'm sorry, my mistake" is never enough she has to explain that she just assumed I "worked here because I had on such pretty pearls." I "must be a hostess." *eye roll* Stuff White People Do *sigh* http://stuffwhitepeopled… End sidenote. We also shared the App Sampler for 2. That was brilliant! 10 bucks for 2 wings, fried green tomatoes, peel and eat shrimp, and something else that I forget because I ate it so fast. hehehehe. My chicken was divine juicy dripping down my fingers delicious. The greens are very good. A little sweeter than I like. Next time I'll throw some of that Devil's Duel sauce on em. The mac is OK. The cornbread is OK. But I would like to suggest this place to y'all for our next Yelp brunch. It would be so fun. Try to avoid the accidental racists here and your dining experience will be perfection. OH and BONUS!!! Blue Moon on tap. Yeah Baby!!! Gimme more!

This little white boy went to Harlem, This little white boy had a feast, This little white boy had wingies, This little white boy had ribs, And this little white boy left... In a food coma all the way home... Wasn't that adorable? Now, onto man things! Because Dinosaur Bar-B-Que is about as manly as it gets when it comes to gorging on giant slabs of meaty goodness that would make Fred Flintstone cry like a little girl. Throw in some kitschy roadhouse decor, a few buckets of Pabst Blue Ribbon and Schlitz, not to mention Smart Alec waitresses, and you've got yourself a recipe for quite the night of dry-rubbed and slow-pit smoked over-indulgence. For as fall-off-the-bone, finger-lickin' good as the Bar-B-Que Pork Ribs may have been, the real winners, in my opinion, were the small plates and sides. The Wango Tango Jumbo BBQ Chicken Wings were dripping with tangy flavor, even if they were a bit too jumbo for my liking. The Fried Green Tomatoes, topped with Pecorino Romano cheese and served with a cayenne buttermilk ranch dressing, were crazy, off-the-charts delicious. And I could barely contain myself when it came to the outstanding Bar-B-Que Beans with Pork. And I don't even like baked beans. I can only imagine what other treasures on this menu I didn't have the stomach capacity to try. Our server was quite the seasoned professional. Despite a packed house, she was so attentive and on-point you'd think we were the only table there. The hostess stand, however, was another story. Even with reservations, we were forced to wait forty-five minutes beyond our scheduled time due to what seemed like utter confusion on their part. Still, we couldn't have been happier once finally seated, and in the end, this Upstate off-shoot lived up to its reputation - big, brash barbecue of carnivorous proportions.

Nothing screams wide-eyed instant love like a full rack of BBQ ribs and four hearty side dishes. Gents, friends, and meat-lovers, listen up while I share a personal secret. The Sweetheart Deal For Two is your one-way ticket to a girl's stomach, and thus her heart. At $27.50, it won't even break your wallet. In my case, I shared the order with the lovely Rachel A., who decided to be a lady with a fork and knife while I already had half the rib bone in my mouth. Oops? The meat falls off the bone, but has a nice tender texture to it. For our sides, we got the mac-n-cheese, fries, greens, and the veggie of the day (corn). We even started the meal with some lip-smacking chicken wings to whet our dinosaur appetites. The contented murmurs and concentrated eating coming from most of our group of 20 can speak to the quality of the food. You can get chicken, ribs, chicken wings, pulled pork, and a nice selection of sides at a price-to-portion ratio that will make any pre-historic monster happy. Okay, I'll stop with the dinosaur references, but only because I have some leftover ribs calling to me now.

If your in a rush don't eat here go to that fake ass Dallas BBQ . For me and my fam the wait was well worth it. Real BBQ food not smothered in sauce. As a matter of fact the food is so good BBQ sauce isn't needed although it's available on the table and is delicious . I had the extreme sampler . It had ribs, chicken, brisket, cornbread and two sides Mac & cheese and mashed sweet potato. I loved it couldn't have had a better meal and service was on point. It's a busy place but our server managed to make sure we were not neglected. We spent bout $210.00 that included a nice tip for 4 of us and a bucket of coronas . Will come back to eat here.

This is probably going to be a pretty sophomoric review...if that's not your thing, well, um..read one of the other 200 or so reviews... Dinosaur Bar-B-Que has some amazing wings! ?The best buffalo wings! ?The meat falls off the bone! ?I know what other people say about waits, etc at this place. ?Yeah ok idiots. ?More and more I realize that I have an amazing life. ?I never wait at this place. I walk in. ?Then I say to myself...self...that lady has some huge bazamazamos...and she does...the hostess has some big big breasts. ?So she says do you have a reservation...and even though I wanna say...give my your number and I will give you a time so amazing that afterwards you will be able to speak to animals, plants and fifty seven species of aquatic animals, I am somehow able to hold back. ?I then say, nah, I am going to go sit over there. Where is over there? ?The bar area where i have seats, tables, a place to eat, tvs and a clear view of her big bazamazamos if I should choose to look up. ?I then walk over and speak to the flat woman with the nice personality. ?Then I eat my wings and drink my blue moon and speak to whomever I am with. ?No wait, no issues...its great...the wings taste yummy!

Wait, what? How can I not have reviewed this place yet? DBQ*, you have been in my heart for the last 7 years, and in my stomach for the last 10 hours. Whenever I am done eating here, I go into a food coma. I sit. Silently. Wishing I had room to finish (I never can). This is the true reason I have gained weight since moving to NYC. Rather than give you a legit review (as if there aren't enough here), I am going to offer something very special to you: Invite me with you, and I will tell you what to get. It's that simple. I know the secrets (not all the sauces are on the table) and I plan to keep it that way. The only thing that bothers me about this DBQ is their lack ofthe Mac Salad side that they have up in Syracuse. You hear me, Dino-People? Get on that! * Dinosaur Barbe-Que, to the uninitiated.

Let's talk about Harlem first. Um, what is Harlem? When G. said we're going to Harlem, my first thought was, "You want me to share someone's husband?!" Oh. Let's just say I've never been past 86th street, Est ou Ouest. Me: G, am I going to get shot for being such an adorable Asian? G:....Yes. Oh. Got to the place and was surprised at all the crackers here (...I mean the snack. Yeah.) Huge, spacious place. The artwork on the walls reminded me of the Disney show "Dinosaurs," which made me teary-eyed for the good ol' days where Disney didn't whore out little girls, but giant, horny, extinct reptiles. Will! Joy! Liz! Lati! Chun! Rachel! Janeen! All aweful (short for "full of awesomeness") people. Let's talk about food. I mustered up the courage to get the Pork & Brisket Plate with mac&cheese and salted potatoes, after Joy convinced me she would share her fries with me. Peer pressure. Love it. I was expecting a huge plate but was pleasantly surprised with the portions. It reminded me of high school when you would get egg noodles, papaya salad, sticky rice, and pork on a stick all on one plate. Anyone else remember those days? Sigh. Can I just say mac&cheese? Incredible. You lift me up. So I can stand on mountains. You raise me up. To walk on stormy seas. Pork&Brisket=love. Now I understand why people are emotional eaters. It's probably the only love I'll ever know. I had to gobble my food down while listening to Chun and Janeen argue, and give each other caustic one-liners. I felt like I was watching a comedy show. Chun: Janeen, can you eat faster? Janeen: It's hard to when I'm sitting across from you. Or I have to look at your face. (Something to that effect. I was too busy having my lips covered in BBQ sauce) ZING! My favorite part of the dinner was when we all shut up and concentrated on our food. Ah, to be at an awkward-bottle-up-your-feelings Asian dinner again. It was nice. We all had food babies, but good ones. Most babies ruin everything. It definitely felt nice to do the walk of shame afterwards.

YABBA! DABBA! DOO! A BBQ joint with dinosaur serving amounts that would make Fred Flintstone proud. Honestly, I had to hit the gym this morning for an hour of cardio just to help open up my arteries a bit. But it was oh- so- good as I love BBQ anything! Got a craving for BBQ and met up with Ben who is the chef at Artie's Deli for a first time feast here. Easy to get to as it is a few blocks away from the 125th street subway station. Just take the #1, make a left and walk towards 12th ave. Can't miss this place as it stands out by itself. It sits on a brick road and has picnic benches on the outside. As I have been to a few BBQ places in Texas and know what the real deal is I had to admit walking into this place that they know what they are doing. Immediately you are hit by a wall of amazing BBQ aroma. My mouth was watering as my nostrils sucked in the fragrance of smoked meat being cooked on an open grill. I wanted it now! I needed it to live! But alas, there were people waiting ahead of us and we has at least a half hour wait. Sauntered up to the bar and scoped the beer selection. They do have an impressive selection of craft beers on tap, and a few in cans. PBR, Schlitz, and Texas' own Lone Star. I do prefer Shiner, but none here. Went with Rogue Dead Guy on tap - nice! We did not have to wait that long and they took us to a nice booth right in the middle of the dining floor. Place is really big, lots of tables, totally decked out in dark woods and cool retro signage. Just what you would expect a BBQ joint to look like. Every table was packed, and throughout the night more kept piling in. Weekend nights must be crazy, so I would think reservations would be a good idea. Looking over the menu and we could not decide - there is a lot to choose from. We figured to skip appetizers and go right to the meat. Best way to sample their BBQ was to get one of the combo platters. I went with the "Tres Hombres" - ?BBQ pulled pork, sliced Texas Beef Brisket and a 1/4 rack of ribs. Comes with two sides so I had to go with the mac and cheese and whipped sweet potatoes. The plate put in front of me was tremendous - but I was up to the task at hand! BB pulled pork was tender and moist. Just enough BBQ sauce on it to offer extra flavor. I wanted more of this! Would be terrific as a sandwich. Ribs were good, not too dry, nice and smokey, and pulled off the bone pretty easily. I can definitely see myself ordering a whole rack of these. Both Ben and I had the same thought on the brisket. Not enough flavor and not warm enough. Kind of cold and covered in too much sauce. I'll have to give it another shot to see if maybe this was a boo-boo this evening. Mac and cheese was really good. Sprinkled with paprika seasoning and not engulfed in cheese. Just right. Whipped sweet potato. I love sweet potatoes as they are like candy to me. Add in some butter, cinnamon, and spicy nut topping and this is like dessert. I almost ate the container it came in! So glad we did not order appetizers or dessert as we were stuffed after this. What about greens you ask? Salad? HA-HA-HA! No way, Jose! Not this night. Overall, I have to admit, this place is on-point. Staff is attentive, our waitress was friendly, and the bouncer/floor manager dudes that are walking the floor are cool too. I am already making plans in my mind to go back and try out more delicious BBQ here. Yes, you actually can get good BBQ in NY. --------------------------------------------------?--------------------------------- Disclaimer: No Greens were hurt in the making or eating of this meal --------------------------------------------------?---------------------------------- I really am gonna need a good cardiologist soon!

My first impression of this place was...SCARY! the location was a little discouraging especially when the night that me, my bf and friends went was filled with scary bikers surrounding the restaurant. Not only did the bikers fill the air with their annoying bike growls but, the restaurant also happens to be situated underneath the bridge. For such a lousy location the food better be worth it!.... And by golly it was! I don't usually crave for ribs and junk but for some reason I was. For starters we had the sampler which is a definite must! it included chicken wings(which was good), deviled eggs(which was really really good!), shrimp(GOOD), and the "fried green tomatoes"(which was surprisingly really really good!). It comes in an order for 2 or order for 4. I wish they would have had an order for 6 because I would be all up in that thing...yes...it was that good! and i had 4 other people say the same thing. Now for the main course...I ordered the "ode to elgin" which was 1/4 rack of Ribs, Beef Brisket & Hot Sausage Link. The ribs was nice and tender and so was the beef brisket. I really wanted to like the sausage link, but it just didn't tickle my fancy too much. I guess it's hard for me to compare it to the sausage that I had at the BBQ block party at madison square park. And yet, I really can't complain because this so much way better than the food that they serve at Dallas BBQ. My boyfriend on the other hand had the "sampler extreme" which was 1/2 Chicken, 1/2 Rack of Ribs, Texas Beef Brisket. Everything was the same as mine except for the chicken. Oh man...it is definitely waaaay better than the chicken at Dallas BBQ. It was sooo juicy in comparison and full of flavor. The serving was also HUGE. My bf is a big guy and he couldn't even finish 1/2 of the things that was on his plate. It's funny cuz when you think that you finished something, there's some meat hiding beneath something else. So my overall experience? 1. Location = C 2. Ambiance = B 3. Service = B+ 4. Food = A

Lets have a chef run down shall we: Dinosaur itself: ?It gave me the feeling I was at a smaller different Virgil's when I walked in there, all the wood and it was pretty pack at like 7pm. I gave my name and headed to the bar just taking in all the smokey smells while i waited for Phil. ?It was a comfortable place, everyone seemed so happy to be there, seems like a place where you hang out at the bar alone and grab food and a beer and not feel weird. I liked that. ?It was a half hour wait not so bad considering all the people walking in. FOOD!: We both ordered BBQ platters so they would be no room for apps. I went with the Tripod of faith 1/4 chicken (white meat) 1/4 rack and sliced brisket. ?Now comes the honesty: Chicken: good, not dry for white meat... but I've had better working in BBQ. Ribs: Good, tender, smokey, the bark itself was a little salty but i like salt. Brisket: made me sad, it was cold and cover in BBQ sauce, couldn't taste the meat at all, now when you eat brisket you wanna taste that bark, it was in that smoker for at least 10hrs and you wanna taste all that work they put in. Meh O_o ?not pleased. Sides: Mac and Cheese: Very nice, like the smokey paprika taste Sweet Potato: nice as well but its a freaking mashed sweet potato put enough butter, salt, sugar, and a hint of cin. your good to go. We introduced ourselves to the nice manager we were exchanging sarcastic comments with the meal, turns out he's a fan of mine and Artie's. ?I'll be going back there to visit Steven and try new things... Bring him a present or two. ?His kind words about my place made the meal that much better. Thanks again Dinosaur, chef you do good work. See you again soon.

Oh Dinosaur BBQ, why are you so far away? ?Why must I cross and trek from the bottom of this island all the way to the top just to have your yummy goodness? ?And, the mere fact that I will endure this commute (both times in the rain!), just goes to show that I love you so. In fact, I don't even like BBQ! ?Like seriously! ?Yeah, I'm weird. ?I like ribs, but I'm not much a fan of BBQ sauce. ?Maybe because I'm used to dry ribs, which makes me crinkle my nose at the thought of saucy, saucy ribs. ?But, somehow, I love the ribs here. ?They're juicy and tender with just the right amount of sauce. The first time I came here, I had crashed Judy K's outing. ?Joolz and I shared the swag sampler plate - spicy shrimp boil, (the infamous) chicken wings, fried green tomatoes and deviled eggs. Everything was just ok. ?I don't think they let us pick the sauce on the wings, so I wasn't that impressed. ?Plus, for $9.95, I was hoping for more than just two of each item in the sampler. ?Ok fine, we got four shrimp, but still... For my entree, I got the traditional sampler with 1/4 rack ribs, 1/4 chicken and sliced Texas beef brisket. ?I only ate one rib, a bite of the chicken, a couple slices of brisket and maybe one of the two sides that my sampler came with and was stuffed. The ribs were my favorite - juicy, fall off the bone and tender with just the right amount of BBQ sauce. ?The chicken was good, but nothing to write home about. ?But, the brisket - ewwww! ?It was so dry that I had to douse it with the BBQ sauce on the table to get the two slices down. ?When I packed my full box of leftovers from my platter, I was sure to leave the brisket. ?hahhaha The next time I had come back, I was in a serious craving for ribs and was dead set on ordering a full rack just for the leftovers alone! ?So, I went for the sweetheart deal - full rack of ribs and four sides for under $30! ?That really is a deal! ?I ended up eating maybe 4 ribs and 1 side, shared a few ribs and sides with my tablemates and still had enough leftovers for two meals! ?Woohoo! Oh, I also introduced Jackie C to this place and dragged her all the way up here. ?She's not even from NYC (I was kinda afraid she'd get lost...)! ?She loved her meal too! ?BTW, she ordered the garlic chipotle wings and they were soooooo good! ?Guess they gave us a milder version with our sampler last time. As for sides, I've gotten the mac & cheese, creole potato salad, BBQ fried rice and usually the veggie of the day. ?Last time, the veggie of the day was green beans with mushrooms and reminded me of green bean casserole - yum! ?The BBQ fried rice, which is one of their more popular sides is actually pretty good. ?Reminded me of Chinese take-out roast pork fried rice. ?And, though I've never gotten their Syracuse salt potatoes, everyone that I know that has, has enjoyed them. ?I'm gonna get those next time! So, if I can drag myself all the way up here in the rain, you can too! ?Go! ?Order the ribs and the wings and you won't be disappointed.

**BREAKING NEWS** The dinos are coming. To a borough near you. Even Jersey, Long Island, Beantown, Connecticut, and Westchester. Get ready. Save up your wet naps. Wipe the sauce off your face. Dinosaur Bar-B-Que is going to be your next door neighbor. **And now back to that Yelp review you were reading... I'm kind of upset that Dinosaur Bar-B-Que is going to become as common as an Applebee's. I like that it is tucked away in Harlem and you have to make an effort to get there. Only the brave are awarded great things and one of those great things is barbeque! Dinosaur Bar-B-Que is excellent for large parties (as big as twenty in one table) and it is not rare to experience any of the following at any given time: 1) a Gospel choir singing Happy Birthday! 2) vegetarians enjoying the food just as much as carnivores do 3) people getting ready to loosen their belts (the food is epic!) It's all true and it can all be found at Dinosaur Bar-B-Que. They have everything from "big ass pork plates" and brisket to fried green tomatoes and heavenly rich mac n cheese. The chicken wings are not to be missed. They are practically drumsticks since they are so meaty and big. They're also smothered in such a sticky glaze that you will be licking the remnants off of your fingertips. Other notable appetizers are the spicy shrimp boil, deviled eggs, and green tomatoes. There is something for everyone on the menu. I always get the Sweetheart Deal of a full rack of ribs, fries, two sides and cornbread to share but even between two people we can barely make a dent in it. All of the appetizers and sides are so good and filling that by the time we get to the ribs the most damage we could do is a quarter of the rack. I know. Lame. But the leftovers make for great breakfast, lunch, and dinners. Ask Melissa Z. She was the lucky inheritor of the ribs. That's like becoming a trust fund baby when you're a college student! The sides seem to rotate depending on the season. The first time I went to Dinosaur Bar-B-Que I was hoping for some apples. They were nowhere to be found on the menu. Instead was some really good corn. The other time I went they had candied yams. Other sides that are worth the stomach space are the collard greens and mac n cheese. I could actually just eat all the sides and be happy. Their thick cut fries are really good too. The cornbread is dry and disappointing but still edible. **FLASHFORWARD TO THE FUTURE** Dinosaur Bar-B-Que currently has seven branches in New York and plans to extend their success to Philadelphia, Boston and New Haven. Despite complaints of their unsatisfactory cornbread, the crowds keep showing up. A survey regarding customer satisfaction concludes that the Harlem location still reigns over the newer and closer locations. **And now back to that rib you were working on. Nom nom nom.

Tried the extreme sampler with a friend. So much food -- 1/2 chicken, 1/2 rack of ribs and brisket. It was way too salty and dry for me. We also got the mac n' cheese and simmered greens for the sides which was pretty bland, maybe to even out the saltiness. We couldn't finish everything. Supposedly their wings are the best but I didn't try them. They could be the winner here but in my opinion, given how far Dino Bar-B-Que is from me it's not worth dining here.

Yabba Dabba Doooooo!!!! My syracuse potatoes were the best thing I ate, the garlic-butter sauce they were in was freakin fantastic. Wlma's ribs and sausage were good but I enjoyed my brisket sandwich with mushrooms, peppers, onions and cheese more. To top off my BBQ experience I had some really good cajun corn and collard greens (which I believe had ham in them). Overall this place is a good BBQ joint with decent ribs. My stomach had to lock out all the food that was coming in. So my mouth yelled: WILMAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA!

I'm not big on BBQ simply because it's too messy & greasy. ?BUT, hand me over a plate, instantly, I'll be eating its finger licking, deliciousness of brisket and ribs. ?Whoa. ?Their massive portions can feed an army. ?I had texan visitors who claimed the food here was pretty darn close to Texas...although not quite. ?Still fantastic. ?It was good enough for me..as I stuffed my face with brisket, ribs, chicken wings, roasted corn, mac & cheese.... and the fried green tomatoes. ?Super crispy & cheesy. ?I swear, you needed to reel me out of there with a wheelchair. ? We shared the sweetheart meal among 5...

Decor: 3.4/5 Service: 2.5/5 -the waitress kept disappearing for extended periods of time -forgot my water Food: 3.5/5 -half rack of ribs: add the sensual slathering sauce! meat didn't come off the bone as easily -mac n cheese: i like the seasoning they put on it, love the spice -sweet potato: decent but nothing wow. -fried green tomatoes: wow! I can see why this is always recommended. Definitely try this! Don't get me wrong. The food was good but I wasn't blown away. I'm willing to come back and try their pull pork sandwiches and dessert.

This review is for fan #84 Big portions. the wings are great - at about a dollar each... fair enough. Good ribs. What I had was mostly well above average but not other worldly. Not prehistoric good as the name would intend. I liked my collared greens (called something else mysteriously, like vegetable greens). The cornbread was throw away, barely potent to soak up goodness. And not surprisingly, the fried rice is a punishment for whoever would order fried rice from a BBQ joint. I like the flooring and the tables. Deep wood stuff. Nearly Outback-like, but more authentic. As authentic as a southern BBQ Syracuse offshoot under Riverside Drive can be. It's not the end all for me. Too corporate. Rustic wood in NYC makes me feel this way. Why aren't there more locations around the country? It seems formulaic. We can do it! Expand baby, expand! We need shareholders!

Im giving it 4 stars because Im feeling generous. And its delicious. BLOWN AWAY by the fried green tomatoes. I know its annoying to have 400000 reviews with the same annoying critiques, but it delights me when a place called Dinosaur BBQ, which should be an ode to meat, has something as delectable as fried green tomatoes. The wait was long, but me and my little brother gorged at the bar, then continued gorging at dinner. The ribs were incredible, as was the beef brisket. The pulled pork was good, even better the next day in my microwave. The collard green sides were good, as were the mac and cheese. We tried two other sides (salt potatoes and somethin else) but nothing was memorable. he cornbread wasnt worth the calories. All in all, its worth the hype. The decor is cool, the place is well run and the food is delicious.

OK, cannot give it five stars. I am a tough customer because I am used to Oakland BBQ. Because I am used to Oakland BBQ, it should be no surprise that I was not at all afraid...but, in fact, was enthusiastic and insistent about...going to Harlem for BBQ. However, because I am so used to Oakland BBQ, I am used to take-out only; it was a nice treat to be able to come into this restaurant, sit down, ORDER A DRINK, and sit down to a delicious and fast BBQ dinner. They make great sauce, great sides, and even better key lime pie. (Says a lot that I took a risk on the pie; I am accustomed to eating sweet potato pie). You may think it is ridiculous to make an on-line reservation for, of all places, a BBQ place. DO IT! There was a 45-minute wait for a table on an early Sunday evening. However, because we made a reservation (that we were even 30 minutes late for), we were seated quickly. The bathrooms were a bit scary with all the graffiti on the walls.

SALT. That is the best word I can use to sum up my meal here..oh and plentiful. ?They are now located at a really nice and big location with easier access on 125th Street. ?I had the Ode to Elgin with a side of BBQ beans and potato salad. ?I have to say, the sides and the corn bread were delicious. ?I just had trouble with the ribs being just way too salty. ?I could not eat them. ?I took home most of my food for my boyfriend who gladly ate everything I could not finish for leftovers and I even had some of the beef brisket for lunch as well and it tasted decent. I think I would have enjoy the food more had it not been so salty. Service was functional especially for being so busy on a Tuesday night and the price was really reasonable. ?I had never been to the NYC location of Dinosaur, just the one located in Syracuse which I found to be much tastier although I did get a different dish. ?Anyway, I don't think I'll be back again, as I think their BBQ is overrated and way too salty. ?I've had better.

I gorged myself silly. ?Wow is all I can say after having a hearty and soulful meal here. ?I went with only one friend and we finished off the following: something like creole shrimp, fried green tomatoes, chili with tortilla chips, 1/2 rack o' ribs, cornbread, potato salad, baked beans and ... mac 'n cheese. ?To top it off, we had the banana creme pudding dessert. Let's just say it felt like they melted a whole pack of kraft's singles into the mac 'n cheese. ?(That's not a complaint either.) ?The potato salad was heavy too. ?If I had to eliminate anything from our gluttonfest, it would've been the po' salad and chili. ?Not because they weren't good, but because of survival of the tastiest. The appetizers (if you order the "solo" portions) are not that big. ?A solo fried green tomato order comes with 3, the creole shrimp came with about 8 pieces and the chili was enough for about 2 people. ?The chili comes with a layer of melted cheese, a sour cream dollop on top and warm beef and bean chili sitting underneath it all (think the size of a cup of soup.) I could've conquered the 1/2 rack o' ribs if I didn't order the other stuff. ?That should give you an idea of the portion size. The dessert would've been good ... ?if only I was a banana-natic. ?The total bill? ?$53! ?Pretty damn good for two people, who have stomachs the size of toilet bowls.

The BBQ is delicious! We had the Family Stylin' BBQ and the Sweetheart Deal for Two (we're fatties): Fried Green Tomatoes - delicious, Two full racks of ribs - juicy and superb, 1lb of brisket - Tasty with lil layer of fat, Whole chicken - needs picking and might have been undercooked, Mac n cheese - Super with a jalapeno kick to it, Fries - Can't go wrong with BBQ style fries, Simmered veggies - Southern style love, Corn bread - agreeing with prior reviews - they were blah, whipped sweet potatoes - yummy yams, Creole potato salad - good picnic choice, Vegetarian options - plentiful. Getting a table for 7-8 on a Saturday night? You need to make reservations a month in advance or endure a 2hr wait. ORRRRRRR you fight tooth and nail for one of the bar benches and claim chair after chair until you take it all over with your coats and bags before everyone arrived. Guess which one my party did? We arrived at 6:45 and immediately claimed 3 bar seats from a couple that was leaving. By 7:30 we had the complete bench and almost enough chairs. I went on the hunt for the last one and a couple would barely let it go. The bar waitress was rude at first, but she warmed up to us when we started ordering pitchers of Blue Moon and appetizers. ?The experience was really enjoyable and Dinosaur BBQ is worth the trek!

I'm really really sorry to say, I don't understand the hype. We came on a Saturday night and it was packed, as expected. Thankfully, I had a reservation because I overheard someone ask how long the wait would be for 2, and the hostess said TWO AND A HALF HOURS! Holy crap! The 2 of us shared "The Traditional Sampler" which came with: 1/4 Chicken - ?It was chicken. Beef Brisket - A little on the dry side. Not much meaty flavor. 1/4 Rack of Ribs - My favorite of the 3. 2 sides -- We got the BBQ Fried Rice - I've had better at Chinese take-out & Whipped Sweet Potatoes- Good, but nothing special. The complimentary Cornbread was really dry. Even though we shared a meal, it was satisfying. HOWEVER, it wasn't travel-all-the-way-up-to-Harlem good, and it definitely isn't wait-2-&-1/2-hours good! **For you Long Islanders, you can find better BBQ at Smokin' Al's (http://www.yelp.com/biz/…).

Whatdayamean I can't ride the dinosaur at Dinosaur BBQ? http://www.geekologie.co… What? There aren't any dinosaurs here?! Do you at least serve dinosaurs on the menu? I could really go for a haunch of brontosaurus right about now. WTF?! The brontosaurus isn't even a dinosaur anymore?!? Yo people; this is crazy. Nobody tell the Flintstones' Dino. What do you mean that was a cartoon?! That was historically accurate! We family styled our dinner with 5 people at a Blackboard Eats coupon discount of 30% off. (Thanks BBE!) This BBQ is the serious deal. No kidding... I wish they delivered to my apartment, but alas I fall just short of their delivery range. We started with a variety of appetizers, otherwise known as the Swag Sampler Plate. These included a handful of Spicy Shrimp Boil, Chicken Wings, Fried Green Tomatoes, and Deviled Eggs. I'll admit it - I really dug those deviled eggs. They were flavorful and held the perfect texture. For the entrees, we ordered the "Family Stylin' BBQ" which Dinosaur touts as the perfect size to serve 4-6 people. It comes with a Rack of Ribs, 1 pound of BBQ Pork, a whole BBQ Chicken, Honey Hush Cornbread, and 3 sides of your choice. The ribs were falling off of the bone and the BBQ pork was tender enough that you didn't need a knife. Hell... forget the fork while you're at it; just use your hands like the wild caveman that you are. You know that you want to. I wasn't a big fan of the chicken because it was a bit on the dry side (another reason I'm hesitant to order chicken at most places). What's that? Ohh... you want to know what sides we ordered? After much deliberation, we settled on the roasted whipped sweet potatoes with spicy nut topping, Syracuse style salt potatoes, and the BBQ fried rice. My favorite by far were the potatoes - because it doesn't get any better than good ol' fashioned meat n potatoes. The sweet potatoes were good, but they were a little flavor-heavy which made it difficult to eat a lot of it. Despite them not having a triceratops to ride on or having a leg of Barney to gnaw on, I'd definitely recommend chowing down over the fire pit (not literally unless you want to ask nicely and bring your own fire pit) at Dinosaur BBQ.

My memories of Dinosaur Bar-B-Que is from Syracuse, NY. ?The atmosphere there is awesome... as a customer, you go just for the good food, rough service (biker chicks type), and the clientele (big bikers with their Harleys and what not). Before heading to Dinosaur BBQ in Harlem, I was advised by Syracuse graduates that the one here just isn't up to snuff. ?Atmosphere and food-wise. ?I wholeheartedly agree. Ordered my usual - Sweetheart Deal for 2 (comes with 4 sides). ?The 4 sides we picked were the Bar-B-Que Beans with Pork, Mac & Cheese, A.K. Chili (Ass Kicking), and Roasted Whipped Sweet Potatoes with Spicy Nut topping. ? http://www.yelp.com/biz_… http://www.yelp.com/biz_… The ribs weren't really falling off the bone. ?Mac & Cheese was horrendous. ?Beans were too sweet. ?A.K. Chili wasn't spicy enough to be "Ass Kicking". ?The food and atmosphere just didn't live up to the Syracuse standards. Don't get me wrong... the food is still "GOOD"... but not "AWESOME" like the Syracuse branch. ?I MISS SYRACUSE. ?Sigh. On the bright side - their Original Fried Green Tomatoes were pretty good. http://www.yelp.com/biz_… TIP: If you're heading over.... get the 30% off entire bill at Dinosaur BBQ when you make the reservation on Village Vines. ?Sign up here: ?https://www.villagevines… Enjoy!!

Pigs are made for this. The appetizer sampler is a must (deviled eggs, fried green tomatoes, seasoned shrimp, and wings). All of the sides were superb. Go hungry (mental), but don't starve yourself (physical) beforehand, since you want to maximize your stomach capacity at Dinosaur BBQ.

*******ALL I CAN SAY IS THIS... BEST BBQ IN NYC!!! ************* There shouldn't be anything wrong with 4 stars and almost 400 reviews! If you're a first timer, you should try this out! - FRIED GREEN TOMATOES - Spicy Shrimp Boil - Barbeque Wings For entress, since there was too many options for me to try, I decided to get a bit of everything so I order the TRADITIONAL SAMPLER (Which has the 1/4 chicken, 1/4 ribs and Beef Brisket). ?it also came with 2 side orders. ?I got their FAMOUS MAC & CHEESE and BBQ Fried Rice). ? Dessert, Tried Banana Coconut Pudding, SWEET!!! To tell you the trust, This was just 2 small appetizers and a Entree for 2 people, and we ate soo much that I had to UNZIPP my PANTS To be able to BREATHE! I haven't done this in a long time, so that can say this place is AWESOME! ? Why took me soo long to try this place? I've been missing this all my life!!, not anymore!!!!

They have a cool wait system where they text you when your table is ready. So, if you are going to have a long wait like I did (for 1.5 hours), go to Fairway nearby, browse, walk around the West Harlem park by the water and Dinosaur Bar-B-Que will alert you for your table. Was it worth the wait? I would have to say maybe, but just grab a small snack before you wait for the table! For the dishes: 1. Swag sample: - My friend and I ordered solo and it was kind of sad. 1 fried green tomato, 1 deviled eggs, 1 hot wing and several shrimp. One positive thing about the swag sample is that now I know what I like. - Fried green tomato and the sauce that comes with it is absolutely delicious! The crust is crunchy, seasoned well to match the crisp yet soft green tomato under the crunchy exterior. Also, the creamy dipping sauce makes your mouth water. - Hot wing was also quite tasty. The wing was drenched in sauce, but the exterior maintained its slight crunch when it came to our table. When you bite into the wing, the meat was juicy and hot, just the way I like it. yum. - Disappointments are deviled egg and shrimps. Shrimps were cold and nothing special. They did give plenty of it. Deviled egg was mediocre at best. I wish I had contrasting texture for the creamy center. 2. CHURRASCO Chicken Steak: - First off, it's not that big. I thought it was be HUGE, but the meat is small and dry. The chicken comes with the chimichurri sauce which is green and salty so you can eat with your dry, over seasoned chicken. For me, the 2 sides made this dish edible. I ordered mac & cheese, which has a small spicy kick to its ooey gooey cheesy mixture. My other side was vegetable aka collar green. It had a sour taste to the greens, but it cleansed my palate.Corn bread was small and nothing special. 3. Traditional Sampler: - 1/4 chicken, 1/4 ribs, and texas beef brisket. Now, that is a plateful of food. - 1/4 chicken was juicy, moist and the skin delicious with whatever seasoning they had put on it. I wish I had gotten their regular chicken instead of the darn churrasco chicken steak (which by the way was waitress's recommendation). - 1/4 ribs were huge. It's meaty, and not fatty. The ribs are also dry rubbed, but still moist. Need I say more? - Texas beef brisket was the most disappointing meat out of the entire dish. It was a bit dry and least tasteless. It may be because the chicken and the ribs just shined the stage too bright, but beef brisket is not worth getting on its own. - Sides were another matter. My friend ordered bbq fried rice and corn. Corn was nothing special and the waitress said it would come with sauteed onions, but we had to search for the onion. fried rice tasted like asian fried rice with too much sesame seed oil. How weird. We ended up not eating much of it because the taste of the sesame seed oil didn't go with anything both of us had ordered. 4. Sauce: - Yes, I'm giving their sauce a separate category. Whatever sauce they covered hot wings were delicious. The sauce that came to dip with the fried green tomato was delicious. Lastly, their hot sauce/ house sauce on the side of your table in a giant glass bottle was delicious. No wonder it's in a big bottle. You want to drench and drown everything in the sauce because it just makes everything taste better. Overall, the experience wasn't bad. Waitress was attentive and helpful, even if I didn't like her recommendation. Also, all the dishes had some flaws, but I gave them 4 stars because bbq food wise in manhattan, it was still the most decent. Other bbq places fell extremely short, but for me, dinosaur bar-b-q offered what none them could. Pretty good service and their amazing sauce. I'd go back and order their fried green tomatoes and their hot wings to enjoy the glorious southern comforting.

Question: Can a skinny kid eat an entire rack of ribs? Answer: Most certainly yes. Reason: They're fucking delicious! Question: Do they have a good selection of beer that will get you drunk enough to eat an entire rack of ribs? Answer: Yes. Reason: Dinosaur BBQ likes you to be drunk and full. I had an amazing experience here. I went with a fairly large party for my friends bday, the service was great considering the place was packed. The food was fantastic. Good ass BBQ (I still make a better rack of ribs, but these were close). FAT and drunk is how I left Dinosaur BBQ, and honestly, I wouldn't have it any other way.

I tried their pulled pork sandwich at the BBQ & Blues festival on the Hudson, and it was pretty amazing for something served outside the real restaurant. I'd definitely want to check out the restaurant now! The one star I had to knock off was for the 40-minute line that ended with them telling us and the 5 people before us that they were all out of ribs. ALL OUT OF RIBS, just as I could smell the sauce. Holy shit, was I annoyed. Still, amazing BBQ sauce, amazing pulled pork. Bet the ribs were amazing too.

No. ?No no no no no. ? It was the only thing playing in my mind while trying to consume my plate of ribs. ?Friends said this place was "it." ?"The place" for BBQ. ?Really?? ?Are you serious??? I ordered the half baby back rib plate and other friends ordered a sampler, a full rack, and a side of shrimps. ?The ribs were ok. ?There was a decent amount of meat on the bones, but it was over cooked and could have used more spices or a better rub to impart more flavor. ?I am not a fan of their BBQ sauces either. ?Too vinegar-y (watery) and tomato-y for my taste. ?I prefer the smokey, deep, bold flavored sauces. ? The sides I ordered were mac & cheese and greens. ?The mac & cheese tasted more like spackling paste and the greens (vegetarian) were too sour and thin since it wasn't cooked in/with some sort of fatty meat. ?My friend's shrimps looked pretty sad and they came out luke warm. ? Service was fine though. ?They were slammed on a Saturday afternoon but did a pretty good job of refilling our cups regularly and getting what we needed.

So apparently, Dinosaur Barbecue is the best BBQ joint in NYC. I had to check it out. Went to an afternoon game at Yankee stadium and decided to stop by this place on the way back. Expected a wait. Got a wait. Waited for a hour for a table 2. Staff is very friendly here. ?After we got sitted, me and my buddy decided to get 6 jumbo wings of hot and hotter flavor, and split 2 combo plates of ribs, pork, and sides of mac and cheese, corn, and fries. Got myself a homemade lemonade. It was actually very refreshing on a hot day. Not too sweet, not too watery but just the right mix. First off, the wings were FANTASTIC. The hot and hotter flavors were very flavorful and the meat on the wings were so tasty. Literally fell off the bone and melted in your mouth. ? Then the entrees came out. Is it really that hard to go wrong with BBQ ribs? I mean I can go to Famous Daves and can't really taste the difference. ?This place, pretty much the same. The ribs were sauceless and the meat was somewhat chewy. Wasn't a fan. The pork was just ok. It was soft and tender, but the meat itself was pretty tasteless. ?I was hoping maybe it was the sauce that Dinosaur BBQ could be distinguished from but it wasn't the case. I don't know what's so great about this place. It was good, maybe the experience of tracking to Harlem and walking down the Hudson River/West Side Highway makes it a good time, but I wasn't too impressed. Who knows if I'll ever be back.

Since this is the 118th review for Dinosaur, I doubt anyone's going to read it. So I'll keep it brief. ?Basically, this place had been super-hyped-up to me by a friend, and I have to say I was a bit disappointed! ?Especially because, as luck would have it, I ate at Hill Country earlier this week, and their bbq was significantly better [see my review!]. ?I know this sounds so wrong, but to me, sides are almost more important at a bbq place than meat. ?The meat was about equal at both places - good, tasty, and really moist [I had ribs + chicken white meat here]. ? However, the mac and cheese at Dinosaur tasted very institutionalized, sort of not-home-made, and the baked beans were less viscous [in comparison to Hill Country... sorry! This review is turning into a comparison of the two]. ?The serving size of the Syracuse style potatoes was pretty small. ?The cornbread was okay. ?For dessert I had the chocolate peanut-butter pie. Four stars there! I think the key is the meat at Dinosaur - [duh, Loren! this is a bbq place!] and I probably missed out by just getting ribs and chicken. ?Go for the Tres Hombres disch - pork, brisket and ribs. ?And let me know how the fries are! ?No one in my party got them as a side, and I bet they'd be good. ?Also, maybe I would have had a better meal if I'd gotten the fried green tomatoes and deviled eggs that my friend told me to get. A quick note on portion sizes: I thought this place was famous for huge portions, but I'm not so sure that's warranted! ?Plan on getting an appetizer and dessert, as well, to really get the most of your trip up to 131st St.

I had flown into New York for Halloween plus or minus a week, and my friend Alex I was staying with told me about it. We walked 3 blocks in a snow storm at night just to get some BBQ. We arrived and the wait time wasn't long; but Lord bless his heart, our waiter was on a different planet, brought our food (which was AMAZING) and forgot to bring us silverware (he didn't know what "silverware" was, so I had to ask for a "fork"). Great food is definitely NOT extinct, at Dinosaur BBQ.

This place lives up to its hype for many people. For me its A-OK because it tasted great, but at home I've had better. ?I recommend to white people! lol or anyone who hasn't had much experience in southern cookin' The seasoning is good, the potatoes were yummy.

I came here with friends a while ago and I don't ever intend to come back. They had filled me with excitement at the prospect of amazing bbq, huge portions, delicious sides. None of which was really true. Everything was just ?alright. I have had some good bbq in my life and this doesn't taste remotely similar. The worst part was that we waited for 45 minutes to get a table and then resorted to staking out a picnic bench outside (it was quite chilly). Never again. Never again.

I do not often venture above 72nd street. *EDIT* I have never been above 116th Street and I only went there once to take a seminar at Columbia. When I got invited to Josh R's bday party, my gut instinct was: 1-oh yay a birthday party! 2-WTF I am NOT going to be seen above 116th street. OH HEELLLLLLZ NO! I'm not a princess at all, as you can see. [insert sarcasm here] But I put on my sunglasses, a wig, and a hat and took the 1 train from one end of manhattan to the other for the sake of friendship. And I'm glad I did. I had peel + eat shrimp that lasted me for 4 meals (get the large, share with friends, take some home, repeat); fried green tomatoes that were so good they rattled my panties; some kind of perverted sounding wing things...wango tango, I think? (YUM!), mac and cheese that had a similar affect [or is it effect, i can never figure out this grammatical puzle], and ribs that were so good, I would endure the gastrointestinal issues tenfold just to eat them again (my belly doesn't frequent much else besides cupcakes, chicken, salads, seafoods, and cheese) The service was alright. Nothing to write home about, but the food did come rather quickly. Worth traveling over the Triboro/RFK/whatever the hell it's called now Bridge. Side note, as Josh R has pointed out, the Triboro/RFK bridge should be renamed aptly to the WTF bridge. Because, really....WTF!

Ok. Not really sure where to start on this place. I have never had anything here that I haven't liked. ?I've only had things that I've liked more than other things. ?The ribs are near orgasmic, the wings bring tears of joy to my eyes and I have litterally never had a better develed egg... Kind of an odd measuring stick, I will admit, but you'll just have to try some and you'll understand. ?They seriously must put heroine in them or something, they're that good. Appatizers are fantastic, but the deviled eggs, wings and salmon cakes are easily the best. ?The salmon cakes come with some sort of chili sauce that really makes the dish. The portions are huge. ?Literally like those brontosaurus bones from the opening of the Flintstones. ?All of the entres come with 3 sides and I wish that I could reccommend which ones to get, but I can't because no matter what you get (and whatever you get will be good), you'll be staring at everyone else's sides wondering if you've made a grave error, but you can take some consolation in knowing that everyone else is doing the same thing to your plate. ?The mac and cheese is spectacular, as is the cole slaw, corn bread, home fries. ?My best piece of advice is to bring a good sized group that you wouldn't mind sharing food with and plan your meal out like you're about to storm Normandy. Nothing bad to say about this place. ?Even the loeftovers are good.

Following the recommendations here... i took a long stroll from a disco demo on the upper east corner of CP to dinosaur BBQ. ?Long walk and i wanted to get as hungry and as starved as possible for all that i hear here. I got there. Nice joint, looking like a mix of a wild west cantina and a barn, i walked in and the first words i heard were "COMING THROUGH!". A cute looking blond waitress passed dangerously close hefting a tray full of dirty dishes from the outside tables. Music played inside, and the bar was full of patrons. Heck! All the tables were full. I looked and there were some people waiting to be seated. Me, i was alone so i went to the bar area, sat down and the same waitress that almost ran me over, gave me her best smile and offered me the menu. I was overly hungry, mind you. She asked cheerfully "what do u want honey?" in her deep voice. I checked the menu and followed recommendations. Fried green tomatoes and the big ass pork platter. The fried tomatoes were extremely tasty. I don't like breded stuff, but these were worth their bread! Then the platter came in. I had the daily soup, tomato soup with scallions and i don't recall what else. I don't like tomato soup. This one, wow, it was awesome! Mac n Cheese was the next side dish. Good, creamy, tasty with a light red pepper flavor to it and a nice cheesy crust on top. The pork... yumm! god bless that porcine goodness... no greatness. The sauce on it, the texture of the meat.. i have no words. The restaurant is not in the most beautiful area, but once you are in, not much will save you from getting stuffed like a, well, pig. I had to take stuff to go, even though when served it didn't look so impressive. Prices are very fair and not above average. I ate with 2 beers and it came up to 31.00. That's not too bad in my book.

MMmMmmmMmm Never disappointed. The kids (my siblings) and I love coming here and getting our grub on. I never tried any of their chicken dishes but everyhting else on the menu is great, no complaints just craving for seconds. There's always a wait but it's short, unfortunately if you were starving it can be unbearable bc you can smell and see the platters of food passing you. Everything is reasonably priced so you always feel super satisfied and like you cheated them on the bill. I think the far location is best for me and the fam, bc if it wasn't located up in Harlem we'd be there weekly.

3 stars for the food and another star for the prompt and friendly service. It's way out of ?the way for me, but seeing Dreamgirls at the Apollo was the perfect excuse to try it out. The appetizer sampler was really good -- shout-out to the deviled eggs and garlic wings. My half-rack of ribs was tasty and meaty but they were not the best ribs I've ever had in terms of flavor. The cornbread was fine, my side of bbq beans was delicious, and the simmered collard greens had a nice tart vinegar-y flavor. Note: Be prepared to wait a bit even if you have a reso, and they do not seat incomplete parties.

I came here with two friends on a Wednesday night and the place was still packed (and there was karaoke!). ?We had a reservation but we were early and they did seat us after we waited for a bit. ?When we got out of the subway we were confused about which direction to trudge in the post-snow storm aftermath. ?We walked the wrong way a bit but then figured it out. ?And soon the smell of BBQ wafting down the street let us know we were walking in the right direction. ? I thought the food was good but not the best meal I have ever had. ?The brisket was my favorite thing we ordered. ?Everything else was good but didn't blow me away. ?I make better mac and cheese. ? Our waitress Sarah was really nice and funny. ?My friend asked about buying a t-shirt and she said she could send over some girls to model the shirts for him. ?Not sure if she was kidding. ? We ordered some beer tastings which were really cheap ($4? $5?). ?For food we got the extreme sampler, deviled eggs, chicken wings, mac and cheese, cole slaw and french fries. ?We also ordered another 1/2 rack of ribs just in case that wasn't enough food. ?We then finished the meal with a fruit cobbler. ?I am a chocolate person over a fruit person but the dessert was good. ?We left full and happy and only $32 poorer each. ?That part amazed me the most out of the whole experience. ?Or perhaps the impressive vocals being featured on stage during karaoke were what impressed me the most. ? The food came out fast but I didn't feel rushed to eat even though there was a crowd waiting for tables. ?People mostly wait for tables standing in the bar area so there weren't people breathing down our necks or anything. ?I will definitely be going back here.

You're going to drool over the ribs, think the chicken is pretty good and I'm pretty sure Abigail M. would cut the bitch who thought of getting between her and her salt potatoes. And those things are true -- but let's be honest, there are 700 reviews of this place which only means you need to take away this supremely important piece of information ... ... get the wings. Get a lot of them. Don't wipe your hands between juicy, spicy, succulent bites and for the love of god, when you do, wipe them on your pants. You're going to want this sauce for later. If these aren't the best wings in New York, they're awfully close. And with not a ton of good places to spread out and watch big games this far west ?(for NFL games, they're only shown in the bar so get there early) this is one of the places that serves the people around it. Remember -- get the wings. Get a lot of them. Your diet can start tomorrow.

I've heard so many great things about this place, so after living on the UWS for 3 years, I decided I had to check it out. The restaurant itself is in the middle of no where. There is a Fairway Supermarket across the street, but you're essentially under and overpass of the west side highway. It's pretty isolated, but it is only a few minutes walk from the 1 train. I had made a reservation, and they didn't make us wait long, which was nice, especially considering how packed the place was. I was surprised it was so crowded, especially since it was a random Tuesday night. If you're looking for a bar to hang out at, this might be it. The bar area is huge, has a decent number of TVs, and had a really good sized crowd. Not to mention they have a large selection of beers on tap and they average about $6 a pint... pretty good. I also appreciated their selection of beer from Syracuse, which I believe is where the original location is. Nice to see all the local beer available. The food itself was good, but didn't really blow me away. This is a bbq place, so I figured I'd go with their ribs, and I gotta say they weren't that great. They were pretty charred and a little overcooked in places. The meat itself tasted more like a Chinese spare rib than a moist, fall of the bone baby back rib like I was expecting. Don't get me wrong, it still tasted good, but it really wasn't what I thought I'd be getting. The sides I had were decent, really liked the fried rice, the french fries were just so-so. The standout were the fired green tomatoes. I had never had them before, and they were a delicious and awesome appetizer. I'll have to start ordering them at other places to compare, but the batter they used to fry them in was delicious. Basically a mozzarella stick but only healthier, because you have a slice of fruit inside.... right? The sauce you get to dip with them is also great, had a nice subtle heat to it. Our waitress was definitely the downfall of the evening. I don't know if she was just new or what. She was friendly, but never came by to check on us, and anything we asked for took forever. It took a full 20 minutes from when we flagged her down and asked for our check until we got it, and then there was an issue with the bill... pretty annoying. My other big question is, Where are the moisty-naps!? This is a bbq place and you don't have moist-towelettes on the table!? People's hands and faces are covered in bbq sauce, especially after eating ribs, and you just have normal napkins on the table.... lack of effort right there. So my first experience here wasn't great, but it wasn't bad enough that I wouldn't give it a second try, especially considering how many options there are on this menu. They do have a large array of bbq, from ribs, to brisket, pulled pork, and chicken, so you'll probably find something you like. And for the portion sizes, I did feel it was reasonably priced. If I make it back, I'll have to update my review, but for now it's just an ok place.

Five for the ambience, 3 for the food. ?I am not a huge bbq person, and while everything was really good, nothing screamed fantastic. What's that? A "sampler" flight of beer for six bucks? ?And a pulled pork sandwich for $7? Hallelujah! Cheap food in Manhattan! Oh, wait. You're in Harlem. ?But, if you can make it all the way to 131st and Broadway without getting raped (I did, twice on the way there and once back), you will be taken aback by the huge expanse of biker bar that awaits you. Tip: If you're dining with less than four people, grab a table at the bar for a fun, exciting look at the crowd with faster service and usually no wait.

Looking for a great BBQ restaurant in New York City? ?Look no further. ?You can find it all at Dinosaur BBQ. ?Situated under the West Side Highway in Harlem, Dinosaur serves up a full array of BBQ favorites including pulled pork, fried catfish, ribs, and even fried green tomatoes. ?It is well worth the trip. The quality (and quantity) of the food is far superior to what you will find at Brother Jimmy's and Rack and Soul. ?Dino is where my friends and I go when we are ready to eat a big meaty meal. ?The ribs are fall off the bone tender and the pork is the best I have had in New York. ?If you like BBQ you will not be disappointed. ?So take the plunge and venture outside of your normal 5 block radius. One tip: if you are going for dinner on the weekend, be sure to make reservations. ?It will be crowded. ?You can either call or go through Open Table.

As a devotee of the Dino in Syracuse, I'd been dying to try the NYC outpost. ?While much of the charm of the original comes from the upstate-ness of it, they replicate the great food spot-on here. ?In terms of location, I think it's very natural for Dino to replace Syracuse's biker street cred here with a slightly gritty, out of the way Harlem street. ?If you're willing to trek up here for barbecue, well, you must be a real devotee-- none of that Dallas BBQ crap here. Waiting isn't so bad (which will happen, as other reviewers note, even if you have a reservation) because the bar has cheap pitchers and the staff is really nice. ?This is a great place for groups, and the food really does make the trip here worth it. We split the appetizer plate for 4 with our friends-- I'd actually never had it before, and it was GREAT! ?The fried green tomatoes were so good. ?I recommend the wings too, but the Devil's Duel really are verrrrry hot, so beware (and I love hot)-- I prefer the wango tango. ?They also have a lot of great beer. ? My boyfriend and I usually get the Sweetheart Deal (here it's $27.95)-- unfortunately, they don't offer the High Time Special at this location (full rack and a bottle of Dom Perignon). ?This is an excellent value! ?A full rack of their amazing ribs-- and the racks must be bigger here than in Syracuse-- with four sides plus warm cornbread. ?We loved the mac and cheese, beans, and clam chowder. ?I drank so much beer that I could only eat 4 ribs. ?If they'd let you, 3 people with moderate appetites could share this. The waitress was fabulous, and I see why there's such a long wait-- because they give you your food and then leave you the hell alone to enjoy it. ?We lingered for a really long time and then got peanut butter pie, which is ok, but I could have just had more ribs for dessert. I'm rounding up to five stars because of the sway the original Syracuse location holds over me. ?I will definitely be returning!

Perhaps an "Apples to Apples" comparison of it's original flagship location in Syracuse, NY might be slightly unequivocal. ?Nevertheless, the thought of having the flavors observed in the Syracuse location mirrored in our own backyard was too tempting to pass up. The establishment at the Harlem location is slightly different than that of its Syracuse counterpart. ?What's observed from Dino BBQ in Harlem is a rustic yet tranquil feel when entering the establishment. ?The exposed grey brick wall that's accompanied by red checked table cloth provides a subtle ease and low key feel to the restaurant. ?More importantly, the biker bar scene is essentially non-existent, as the consumer base is dominated by the "average" New Yorker and Foodies alike. The Food: ?Opted to order the Pulled Pork BBQ Sandwich w/ a side of Beans &amp; Apple Sauce (same as the platter ordered in Syracuse) Pulled Pork BBQ Sandwich: ?Excellent in terms of execution and flavor but lacking the potency that's embodied by the original. ?Each individual bite did indeed possess a balance of juiciness derived from the pork's renderings and sweetness from the BBQ sauce. ?What's was lacking in terms of this location's rendition is the potency of the spices in the application. ?Although the initial consumption revealed a surprise balance of sweetness and heartiness, the extreme flavor derived from the seasoning did not kick in through further consumption. ?What was also noted was the contrast in flavors between one flavor from the next, as certain bites of the pork revealed a level of dryness and lack of flavor, where the Syracuse original did not have such technical flaws. ?Nevertheless, the flavors of the pulled pork were pleasant and provided a welcoming balance of sweetness and spice. BBQ Beans: ?Similar to Syracuse's rendition in every way, the Baked Beans were mildly firm and perfectly sweet. ?The Baked Beans possessed a mild cinnamon / sweet taste that's accompanied by a mild detection of honey flavor. ?The Beans themselves were of medium firmness, thus providing a proper balance of meatiness and ease of consumption to the application. Apple Sauce: ?Is as described! ?Two bites of this helped to cleanse the palate from the excessive flavors of the BBQ Pork At a slightly higher price tag of $9.95, the platter itself was worth it! ?Despite the lack of potency and embodiment of the bold and robust flavoring that was observed at the original Flagship, Dino BBQ still manages to produce a glimpse of the remarkable and captivating flavors that rendered its excessive notoriety. ?Certainly, it's not better than Syracuse, but the flavors themselves on a stand alone basis are worth the hike, not to mention the 2 hour wait time.

I get a message from an old highschool friend, that her and her man will be making a brief trip to the city and were wondering if I could put them up for a night. Hell yeah I can! I love visitors and these 2 people should be New York tour guides with the in-s they know. So as a thank you they ask if they can take me out to lunch at this place called Dinosaur. Oh how I wish now I had joined the meat eaters gang earlier in the year...as this place was terrific. They usually have a wait at the door to prove it. I check the menu and state "Wow they have deviled eggs!" so my friend's boy grins and says "You like devil eggs too, I'm so ordering us some!". The cute twosome suggest the fried green tomatoes and I'm down as its something I have always wanted to try. Then for the entree I call upon the smoked portobello sandwich. Everything tasted soo good. My favorite being the fried green tomatoes, who knew? My pals meaty fare looked quite filling as well. Its a definite recommend to those who want to pretend its summertime and your having a southern style bbq in your backyard, well except you'll be sitting in a restaurant in NYC instead.

Perfect place to throw down & get your eat on! I rarely ever give a place 5 stars so I am finally glad to see I came across an establishment that goes beyond my expectations. Obviously with so many reviews being 4 to 5 stars prepare yourself for a wait. Seriously ladies & gents, it could be up to an hour. Luckily I was in a out with my friend so we made our way to a table in 12 mins. We tried the swag sampler for starters. I now see why people say green tomatoes are a life changing experience if prepared well. Devil eggs, where have you been all my life!! After the impressive appetizer, I wanted to step it up & get some BBQ. We ordered a full rack of BBQ pork ribs (I love my pork) that came with 2 sides (fried rice & mac n cheese). We were greedy so we ordered 2 additional sides the roasted whipped potatoes (unbelievable taste) & creole potato salad. Their literally was nothing negative to say about this establishment. I mean I could go on about this place the food & the great service. Trust me just try this place...Stamp & Approved by yours truly! FYI: Place also does take out just incase you dont wanna wait on line.

This place is a Jurassic joke. I am bat insane crazy about BBQ and if the meat doesn't fall off the bone then you're doing something terrible wrong. It really pisses me off when I have to fight to get the meat off the bone. They should shut down the joint and have a few pit masters come in and give the chef at Dinosaur a training class on how to make ribs. The second problem I have is the place is called Dinosaur, I expect the portions to be big not small like a 5 star French restaurant. This is BBQ!!!! where the hell is the so called BIG ASS Pulled Pork Platter. ?This plate looked more like a baby food jar platter. To top it all off the service was horrible. The waitress and servers are all pissed off and angry giving the customers lip. You are suppose to take care of the customers not treat them light crap.

I've been to my fair share of restaurants and cafes that have popular names that don't quite live up to the hype. ?I've seen Dinosaur Bar-B-Que's sauce in supermarkets and when my party arrived, the place had a virtual army waiting for seats. ?Half of me was almost high with anticipation, half of me was worried this would suck. ?We were told that a wait for a table inside for four would be an *hour and a half*. ?Insane! BUT there was hope! The outdoor seating was "first come first serve", so our little gang spread out, strategically placing ourselves to snag the next table. ?Fifteen minutes later we were firmly planted and not budging from our seats, lest they disappear faster than the Loch Ness monster spotting a camera. We found that for our party, the best bet was to order the family meal. ?On paper, it looked like a good deal. ?We had NO idea HOW good it was. ?This thing was insane. ?The sheer amount of food was easily going to fill four people, and upon reflection we agreed we could have easily fed another two people (making the meal roughly $15-20 a head including tips and drink, which is a bargain really). ?Let's just say we all walked away with doggie bags. ?Mine alone produced two more meals for me. So here's the rundown (apologies if I leave anything out): Grilled hoisin/sesame wings: Wonderful grilled, smoke flavor with a sweet and tangy sauce. Pulled pork: Seasoned wonderfully and sooo moist. ?It melted in your mouth. Ribs: Insanely good. ?The meat fell off the bone using a *spoon*. Chicken: Moist, seasoned just right and the wing tips (where the flavor seems to concentrate) were super nom. Mac n' Cheese: Creamy and tasty, but not overly salty in any way (as I've often found restaurant mac n' cheese). Sweet potato mash: Delicious with some nuts sprinkled on top, a simple touch that really elevates the side dish. Corn bread: the only disappointment of the night. ?They were rather tasteless and not memorable at all, but seriously, this is my ONLY complaint about the food. The service was incredible. ? You have to consider that they were *swamped* with people and our waiter was on point, bringing us drinks, keeping us up with napkins and checking on us at least twice during the meal. ?The guy moved like lightning! Overall, a fantastic experience that I can't wait to repeat!

We ate here last night and I'm still full 18 hours later. ?Maybe that's because between two people, we consumed: six chicken wings (the best I've ever had -- we did the mild honey BBQ), a full rack of ribs, four sides (baked beans which were really well-seasoned, yummy creole potato salad, perfectly crisped french fries and gooey mac 'n cheese) AND a side of pulled pork for good measure. ?Looking back, it seems like all that fighting for food between two brothers growing up was just training for last night's meal. ? I can confirm what others have said about the corn bread -- don't waste your time. ?And although they have an impressive beer list, I'd recommend filling your belly with food and sipping a soda or agua instead. Service was decent and we were seated quickly (we did make a reservation a few days in advance per others' recommendations). ?The atmosphere was fun and it was totally worth the trek past a sketchy nighttime block in Harlem. ?They have lots of motorcycle choppers hanging around as decor, which my hubby loved. ?We did wonder why we didn't get wet naps, which would have been helpful, but then again, finger-lickin' seems to be part of the fun at this down-home cooking city escape. ?If you need me, I'll be on the elliptical for the next several days working off last night's feat of eating...

Pork Coma. I don't know what part of Barney I was eating, but it was right tasty. I got the Big Ass Pork Plate, which came with a big ass mound of pulled pork, coleslaw and the salt potatoes. The pork was delicious. The sauce(spicy) SHOULD be called orgasm sauce. And the coleslaw! Oh my god the coleslaw was so good! It was slightly spicy and tasted like something other than mayonnaise. Yum-O. We also got an appetizer plate for 4, and after we wolfed that down, got another plate of the fried green tomatoes, which were incredible! I am a down home southern/midwestern girl and I know about such things. These were delish! Good breading, firm tomatoes, the cheese, the sauce to dip them in, yum. Also tried a deviled egg, which was the best deviled egg I've ever had. The chicken wing was good too. I'm not a fan of chicken wings in general, but it was yummy. Definitely coming back here. Many, many times.

So they DO take reservations. No wonder the wait for a table of 4 is 1 1/2 hr (minimum). After hearing so much about this place. My friends and I finally ventured out to check it out. We snagged picnic table seating outside (luckily, it wasn't too hot that night). We went for the $60 family meal and added an order of the Sesame Hoisin chicken wings. The wings were grilled, not fried and very tasty! There was plenty of food for the 4 of us. We each had to take a doggie bag to go. All the meats (pulled pork, brisket, ribs and chicken) all were flavorful and yummy. The sides (mac n cheese, corn) were all good too with the exception of the cornbread. Too dry and blah for my liking. Eat what you came for, the BBQ meats!

Do you like sugar? If you do, you'll like this place. I know BBQ sauces have sugar in them but this was just ridiculous. I had a pulled pork sandwich and the Korean BBQ ribs. Both were slathered with sugary sauce. So much so that I had a headache by the end of dinner. The mac and cheese was rubbery. And the baked beans were baked pellets of sugar. The only reason why I'm giving this place two stars is because the waitress was awesome and the chicken wings were the best I've ever had. If you go, I suggest just getting a plate full of wings. They had the perfect amount of spice. The boiled shrimp was also good. The rest of the meal, not so great.

I love Dinosaur Barbeque. ?I've been coming here since before it was ALWAYS full. ?I mean, of course you expect it to be jumping on Friday and Saturday night, but lunch on Tuesday? ?It's insane! Anyway, I don't often come here to eat anymore. ?We usually call in a take out order: Family Meal #2 (1 chicken, 1 rack of ribs, pork or brisket, three sides, corn bread, and a bottle of sauce). ?It comes out to about $50 but it easily feeds four to six people. ?Unless someone makes us get something else, we only order mac and cheese for our sides because this m&c is awesome. It is fun to eat there too, what with the many beers on tap and the delicious fried green tomatoes, but it gets crazy in there. ?Seriously gonzo.

I never took the train to this part of town at night, but I did when I came here last night. I got off at 125th street and all I know is head towards the water, but wasn't sure which street was what. I got to 131st and decided to walk along that hoping I would find the restaurant. That was one hell of a shady street. It was car body shops and the smell of burning tires and some men testing cars and what not. I was walking by myself at 9:30PM down this block and yea it was freaking scary! When I saw the restaurant at the corner and saw people, in my head I was thinking "YES I've made it! And there's people finally!" Got there and it was packed. Waited for my friends and the birthday boy to show up. We've made a reservation for a party of 17 and we were seated when we had 11 people. We were able to wait for the rest, while we ordered for our food. The food was really great! I had the skirt steak, which was delicious. I stole a piece of rib from my friend and the meat just melts right off the bone. Everyone's portions were pretty big. The service was good as well even when it's really packed. Jeff Y. if you're reading this, I had a scary experience, very cold, yet awesome with yummy food and fun time at your birthday! And the ride back to Brooklyn was a pain, but glad there weren't any construction services or else it would've taken 2.5 hours to get home. Happy birthday Jeff Y.! =)

I ordered the memphis pulled pork... I hated it, it didn't have a lot of bbq sauce on it and when I looked at it it reminded me of chitterlings...idk what was going on with me but I couldn't eat it. My bf had the churrasco chicken sandwich and it was sooo good so I exchanged mine for that.... Our waiter Kelvin was pretty patient cause we were kinda rowdy... I would definitely come back!

Dinosaur Bar-B-Que is a new tradition in my family. Every birthday is now celebrated at Dinosaur and for good reason, the food is the best Bar-B-Que I have ever had. Although it maybe a bit of a track up to Harlem, the trip is worth every minute on the "1" train to 125th Street. If we're talking about Dinosaur, you're talking about the Ribs. Do yourself a favor and order a full stack. If you can't finish them they are awesome to bring home and relive the meal the next night. My father will often order another full to take home as a precautionary measure. Now here's where Dinosaur might have lost a point if the ribs/brisket/chicken/appetizers weren't so good, the wait. The wait for this restaurant is crazy. I would caution anyone from just walking in. The wait can be anything from 1 hour to 3! And we're talking a solid 3! If you do find yourself outside and it's a crowded night, do yourself a favor and order your food to go and sit outside at the pick-nick tables with a bucket of PBR. It's a much better solution. While girlfriends have come and gone Dinosaur will be in my heart forever.

This place is amazing. First of all they take reservations which is great but they also actually honor them, because when we walked in they seated us right away, we didn't even have to wait a minute. ?And there was an hour and a half wait when we got there so I highly recommend reservations. We ordered lots of pitchers of beer and lots of amazing food. ?There were eight of us so we needed a lot to go around. The food and the beer were equally amazing and I especially like that they put the alcohol contnet of the beer on the menu. We had a vegetarian in the crowd and she managed to find something to eat, but this is definitely a meat place. ?I ordered ribs which were, plus they give you two sides and cornbread. ?You will not leave here hungry and if you do, you did something wrong. ?Its reasonably priced too. ? The only downfall that I would mention, but its sort of a minor point, ?it was my friend's birthday and we got a dessert for him. They charged us for it, which I'm not sure is customary. ?But still it gets 5 stars so that should show you just how tasty this place is.

Saturday morning, I get a text, "Dinosaur BBQ for lunch? Room for 1 in the car." Oh hellllls yea. Me, my friend, her husband, along with their little tot in tow, went along for some great BBQ. At least I wasn't the 3rd wheel. Ended up with the Nuevo sampler, which is a quarter chicken, 3 ribs, 2 slices of beef brisket and 2 sides. They split a full rack of ribs and 4 sides. Before the food came out they warned me, "you're going to want more ribs." They were right. And boy were they lucky that their 10 month yr old wasn't eating any because I would've had no problem taking a rib from him. Actually, I mean "trading him a rib for my cornbread." he's not even 1! All three meats were fantastic. The macncheese almost brought me to tears. I don't know why but good food makes me emotional aka brings out my feminine qualities. Who knew I had them. The special veggie of the day was corn: oh man oh man, waitress' suggestion was right on point. Lemonade was perfect and even though it was my first visit, definitely coming back with my fat pants. Maybe I'll even bring a toddler if that makes getting a seat easier. Whatever works. Yes mam.

I Finally made my way to Dinosaur Bar-B-Que... I got take out. Dino BBQ is huge! I went on a Sunday afternoon, in the pouring rain, and it was MOBBED! The People of NY know where to get good BBQ, and that's at Dinosaurs. The inside of the restaurant has a Boulder Creek feel, but it's got little more flare. I ordered the full rack of ribs, Cajun and Garlic wings, 1/4 pound of the Broiled Cajun Shrimp, and the West Texas Rib Eye. Everything was very good, the steak and ribs were juicy and delicious, as were the wings and the shrimp. The cornbread that comes with the ribs and the steak was amazing. For the sides I got the mac n cheese, cole slaw, bbq fried rice and the Syracuse style salted potatoes. I thought the the potatoes and the mac n cheese were the best sides, but the other two were pretty damn good too. As far as the ribs go, they were very good. The sauce was good and smoky, and the skin was very crisp. These ribs weren't as good as Phill's BBQ in San Diego or Zorn's on Long Island, but if your craving ribs you will not be disappointed. But in comparison, if your looking for a meal that is similar to Phill's, Dinosaur Bar-B-Que is your best bet. I wasn't ?a huge fan of the wings, I guess I really don't like bbq wings though, so I won't hate on them. They were cooked nicely and they had a nice smokey flavor... but they were just a little bland for my liking. If your on the upper west side, and you don't know where to eat, I definitely recommend going to this restaurant. It's family friendly, it's got a full bar, great menu, and finger lickin' good ribs and steak!

For the record, I would go here just for the fact that their draft selection is very good, and they have Arrogant Bastard on tap. ?They also do a beer sampler. ?That said, their food is first-rate and, in my opinion, the best BBQ in NYC (even though I think they're probably the newest). Some say this place feels like an upstate biker bar. ?That's because it is. ?Living in exile in Western New York, I've been to the Syracuse (original) and Rochester locations several times. ?They're all comparable. ? If you're lunching, the sandwiches are the way to go. ?But strap on the feedbag for dinner and dive into the SAMPLER EXTREME!!! ?Solid ribs with a smokey finish, BBQ chicken (I prefer dark meat - and I like my chicken that way too: Hey-Oh!), and brisket or pork - all meant to be initially savored as house-prepared, and then slathered with the variety of sauces that will be made available at your table. ?You can't really go wrong with any of the sides, though I recommend the collard greens and the creole potato salad to counter the heat. ?Unlike many reviewers/yelpers, I think the Mac and Cheese is their weakest offering. ?You can get fries and the Ass-Kicking (they call it "A.K.," or at least they used to) chili as sides, but why not get them in addition to your platter? ?When available, their poblano soup and cheddar/beer soup are definitely worth a try. Be sure to duck into the bathroom for some graffiti frolicking while you're there. ?In fact, the decor is worth a look throughout the place. It's true about the waits. ?They can be brutal. ?And are they open on Monday's yet? ?I know the upstate locations are closed on Sundays for some inexplicable reason.

I love Dinosaur. I always have. ? Growing up on the original in Syracuse, it's hard to replicate the food and the experience. ?The NYC version comes as close to the original as possible. ?The original is much smaller and much more cramped, so the big, open area here is a nice change. The food, as always, is awesome. I always roll with the Tres Hombres. ?You simply cannot go wrong with pulled pork, ribs and brisket (along with mac and cheese and salt potatoes of course). ?The Dino BBQ sauce is the best BBQ sauce I've tasted. ?It's not too sweet, it's not too smokey, it's not too overpowering, It's perfect. I've read a number of reviews on here about some of the bad aspects of this Dinosaur. ?Some of you criticize the place for some of the dumbest reasons possible. ?The restaurant is a 5 minutes walk from the 1 train. ?It's sooooooo easy to get to. ?The people who complain about it being such a long walk from the B or C trains should figure out a better way to get around. ?Take the closest subway if walking the extra blocks is such a big issue for you. ?It's not Dino's fault you don't know how to get around. And for anyone complaining about their reservations and having to wait, all I have to ask is "Isn't that a good sign?" ?When you make a reservation to a restaurant, it doesn't mean you are to be seated right when you walk in. ?When you have a busy, popular restaurant, waits should be expected, no matter if you make a reservation or not. ?Your reservation means you're at the top of the list and will get a table when it's available. ?At Dino, waiting is hardly a bad thing. ?Go stand at the bar and choose a beer from their eclectic selection. ?It's a big bar with lots of seats and TV's. ?Is waiting with your group and having a beer the worst thing in the world when you know you're going to be getting a great meal? ?I hope not.

A stones throw from the Hudson River in Harlem is Dinosaur BBQ. ?This is a small chain that started in upstate New York, Rochester I believe. ? With hundreds of reviews just from Yelp, don`t be surprised if you arrive here and there is a good sized line. ?But, the staff does a nice job of keeping things moving, while giving patrons appropriate attention while they are seated. The BBQ is mostly solid, while on a few different visits, sometimes varies in its` overall quality. ?Ribs are a bit chewy, ok flavor, with a pretty good smoke. ?The brisket is a little better, with a nice smoke ring and a tender texture. ?Pulled pork was very good, with a great flavor and not over-sauced like many places tend to do. ?It was tender with a great smoke and bark aspect. French fries, collard greens and corn bread were all solid. ?Overall a relatively solid BBQ restaurant, that just needs to work on consistency. ?Which can be difficult, with a high level of diners coming in and out your door.

I'm here at least once a month the drinks are great! It starts to get super crowded by 6-7PM. So be prepared to wait for a table if you want to sit for dinner. The bar is my favorite place to sit with my co-workers. I like that we can be fun and rowdy at the bar. The food is awesome especially the brisket & ribs!!! You will definitely NOT be disappointed eating here. The wait staff depends on the night you go. The white/tight pant homosexual at the bar is by far the worst bartender there he works on Tuesdays. The most unattentive bartender I've ever experienced there.

Have you ever been sitting around on a friday night after eating healthy all morning and afternoon and said to yourself: "To hell with counting calories....bring on the trans fat?" ?Well - if you answered yes then the Dinosaur BBQ just might be the place for you. After making reservations for 10:30pm - we arrived hoping to be seated immediately in order to satiate our grumbling stomachs but unfortunately the definition of reservation is different here because we had to wait almost 20 minutes before being seated. After getting past the table drama, we were seated in a nice little nook for two where we order some Gnarly Head red wine (great pairing for BBQ), Mild BBQ wings, mac n cheese and the Churrasco Chicken Steak (chimichuro sauce). ?While we dined a live band played some New Orleans style big band music (too bad there was no room for dancing) It was all quite filling and apparent to everyone around us since we downed the food in a matter of minutes and were seen leaving the restaurant rubbing our tummies like pregnant women. ? This is a great spot for some GREAT BBQ, cool tunes and fast service (once you get seated). ? Also - in terms of getting there - your best bet is a ?bus across 1125th all the way down to 12th avenue - the street number sequence will defy all reason and logic and jump over to 130th on the next block when you reach 12th avenue.

Good. Have had 4 great meals here and 1 mediocre one (closing time on a Sunday). The brisket can be a bit towards the fatty end of things. They're going to be opening up a location in Brooklyn (Union Ave, near Barclay Center), so people won't have to trek all the way up north soon. Great bar/beer list. Great BBQ.

Great barbecue, especially for a place like NYC. Now, it's not mind-blowingly great, but again, for NYC, there are fewer better. Visited last month with my family, and I was surprised to see the location had changed. It moved from right on the waterfront and the West Side Highway two blocks south and a block in from the water. The view isn't quite a cool, but I guess the Manhattanville viaduct looks alright, too. Warning, the spicy chicken wings are incredibly spicy. I like that kind of stuff, and it was very spicy, even for me. The pulled pork sandwiches are good, too. If you get a larger order, which comes served in a cast iron skillet (nice touch), it is a lot of food. You can easily gorge yourself at this place. So come up to Harlem for some great barbecue!

It's prob all been said b4 so here's my 2 cents: -was told there was a 2 hour wait, but one employee sat us at a bar table instantly. -Half rack of ribs were awesome. love the crispy shell of meat to the pork, Seasoning made this rack stand out. -Pork slap and Dogfish Head, two ice cold superb beers. -mac and cheese, potato salad and cornbread sides were all tasty as well. -waitress with the dimple piercing was always in the right place at the right time for me. -Applebees atmosphere and very portion controlled plates. that's where the missing star went.

Complete and utter awesomeness. Did a quick little take-out of a Memphis style pork sandwich platter. ?The pork is so moist, succulent and flavorful its hard to top this. The bun wasn't even necessary, but it did soak up all the extra bbq sauce i put on the sandwich, so it needed to be eaten. The beans? Oh, those too were delicious. The salt potatoes were the only slightly (very slightly) weak link. They were great, but id go for mac and cheese or something next time. The interior of this place is also pretty damn awesome. I will be back now that i live way way way to close to it.

This has got to be one of the worst excuses to be called a "restaurant"! ?Prior to eating here, I'd heard "good" to "great" reviews. I think those people were on crack! Knowing in advance its a BBQ "joint" you don't go in expecting Michelin five star service, but the service here is B-A-D to the point its non existent! ?The staff is general uninterested in make your "experience" at this hole in the wall an pleasant one. Oh and the fact that it's swarming with ill mannered children who's parents are oblivious to the fact that THEIR child/children are annoyance only makes this place, that much lower on my rating scale.

One of the top five meals that I've ever eaten.

OOOOAHAAA... so good! First off the ribs were juicy and delicious. ?The pulled pork was amazing, and the chicken was so juicy, I think chicken juice shot into some chicks eye across the room and she went blind. ?Just kidding, that was my huge voracious load!

I had been to Dinosaur Bar-B-Que once before and with all the hype it was getting, I was NOT impressed and was content never to return.

Get the: Spicy Chicken Wings: this is a gazillion times better than the sweet chicken wings...mmmm...love the little kick, it's not too much but can build up. ?

Fried Green Tomatoes: lightly breaded and served HOT HOT HOT - I LOVE IT. ?it comes w/ this creamy sauce that's kind of like a spicy ranch(?) ?friggin' amazing... Fries: crisp, meaty, and hot. ?can't go wrong... Potatoes w/ Garlic Butter: tastes like a heart attack and should come w/ a health advisory warning label on the side. ?who can say no to butter...least of all garlic butter?!!! Potato Salad: they just do the creamy foods right at this joint... Skip: Sweet Chicken Wings: not enough flavor - needs some spice! Macaroni and Cheese: too saucy Rotisserie Chicken: nothing special, could've been juicier Brisket: nothing special, could've been fattier (um i mean juicier) Ribs: kinda dry Cornbread: kinda dry and crumbly Celebrity Sighting: Jadakiss

You might not like this place... if you're a big jerk. Dinosaur is the finest bbq restaurant in the city. The atmosphere is phenomenal and the crowd is as diverse as the graffiti covering the bathroom walls. Plan on loosening your belt a few notches as you leave this place, because the grub is so tasty you won't be able to control yourself. I had bbq sauce coming out of my pores for 3 days and then i went back for a refill. Definitely make a reservation if you go on a weekend night. If you don't you may be forced to hang out at the bar and sample some of the many many beers they have on tap. They even do flights of beer (try a "sample" of 5 different beers). If you live in manhattan and haven't tried this place you need a good ass kicking.

I was excited to finally try this BBQ institution. I got the Texas brisket plate with mac & cheese and carrot raisin salad, and a sweet tea on the side. Sweet Tea - 5 stars. Very sweet. Mac & cheese - 5 stars. Super creamy. Great with the sprinkling of chili/cayenne powder. Carrot raisin salad - 4.5 stars. Nice to have something a little crunchy and light in contrast to the rest of the meal. Cornbread - 5 stars. I LOVE me some cornbread! This was perfectly moist. Brisket - 3 stars. I'm not a big BBQ person, and I prefer chicken to beef, so maybe this is unfair, but I just wasn't that excited about it. It has a weird taste to it -- maybe it's supposed to taste that way, "smoked" -- but it reminded me of fuel. My friends ordered ribs and they brought out a small metal bucket for the bones. I got a kick out of that. :)

I could literally walk miles for Dinosaur BBQ's epic sauces, and that's exactly what I did on the 4th of July. Even with a twisted ankle and a bloodied knee, me and the BF walked five miles to get there. The hour wait went by relatively quickly; we spent a good chunk of time teasing the frustrated, impatient diners (FYI you're definitely not going to get special treatment if you verbally abuse the hostess). I guess karma came back to bite us in the asses, since our hostess was extremely lazy and inattentive. However, she wasn't the only slacker. For a good while, her and a group of other waiters were standing in a corner, joking around for long periods of time. Okay, I get it, you're working on a holiday and would rather be somewhere else. Having said that, that doesn't mean you can forget about your customers because you need to catch up on gossip. The food was good, though. Minus the overly-mayonnaised potato salad.

Sweet jesus that was some good food. and if an old jew like me says sweet jesus that pork was good, you better believe it. had fried green tomatoes and the boiled shrimp for appies. the shrimp was ok, ?not bad, nothing to write home about, but the tomatoes were REALLY good. I had the original, but next time must try the ones with shrimp remoulade. (any excuse to return) I had the tres hombres platter, with beans and syracuse potatoes as sides, my buddy had the ode to elgin platter with greens and fries. we also ordered some cole slaw (i find cole slaw one of those dishes that shows how good a place is sometimes.. i mean it can be meh or stellar.. and a place has to care to make it well) OK - where was i? yeah ?so between us we had 4 meats and 5 sides. the ribs - SO good. tender, tasty (esp with the addition of a bit of their incendiary house brand hot sauce) not at all tough, but not so cooked that there was not bite to them at all. perfectly done really. and here's the thing... i think the ribs were my least favorite thing on my plate... ? pulled pork... i mean c'mon people ?pulled pork.. besides having a name that would make a 13 year old boy giggle, life rarely geets much better than pulled pork, does it? again perfectly cooked, full of flavor, richly spiced, but with the spices kept in balance, and not overriding the pork yumminess. texas style brisket. holy shit. damn that's good. ?deep spice rub flavor. just a touch of sauce, so as not to overpower the beef and spices. fork tender. beefy and good. i only had one small bite of the elgin sausage, but it was really good. spicy and porky. i could certainly chow a few of them suckers down. on to the sides: the aforementioned cole slaw was REALLY good. not at all bland, not at all watery. just fresh tasting. perfect compliment to the food. the beans were a bit watery, texturewise, but as tasty as beans need to be. tasty enough that i didn't mind that the sauce was a bit loose. seriously. good. the greens were good. i'm not sure why anyone would make greens vegetarian, the lack of pork flavor was a bit of a downer. I mean it's not like this place is going to be pulling a lot of vegetarians in, so i'm not sure what the point is. But aside from that they were well cooked, and as tasty as pork free greens can be. i only ate one french fry, but it seemed like a decent fry. not the best, but not a soggy potato turd like one oft gets in places that churn out lots of food. the syracuse potatoes were a revelation. YUM. i'm not sure what was on them besides butter and salt, but iut was something, and that something was go-oo-ood misc. other points: a more than decent beer selection - not huge, but varied prob. 15 or 20 beers and ales, listed with their alc %, which is a nice touch. an uber-friendly staff, everyone was smiley and nice and inviting. when they brought me the wrong side, they simply brought out the right one, and let us keep the extra order of greens. nice touch. i cannot remember the last time i allowed myself to stuff myself to the point of painfully full - but i couldn't stop eating the food here. It's that good. note ?this place is as crowded as a mosh pit - make a reservation and come early anyway. the bar is packed. the waiting area is packed. the outside of the place is packed. but nicely - once seated there is no sense of being rushed or crowded in. perfect BBQ for NYC.

For almost a decade now, I have called Dinosaur BBQ my favorite restaurant on the planet. Years ago, as an SU student, I used to go to the original Syracuse location all the time. When I found out that they had opened a branch in NYC I shouted with joy. Now years later I still come here as often as I can and I am never disappointed. Living a mere 15 minute walk away helps too! The food is outrageous, and is my favorite of all the BBQ joints in NYC. For something a little different, try the BBQ beef ribs Korean style - my favorite entree. They also make some of the best wings around - if you're feeling brave get them with Devil's Duel sauce. Try the special BLT, with super thick cut smoked bacon and fried green tomatoes. In fact, just keep coming back here until you have eaten everything on the menu. Then come back some more. The place is fun fun fun, if a little Disney-land-frontier-town-ish. But it is meant to be a kitschy place, even if the requisite bikers from the original location in Syracuse are missing. Make no mistake, Dino BBQ is a BUSY restaurant. It is loud, and the line is LONG. Make a reservation if you can. I had my 24th birthday here years ago, and unfortunately was unable to get a reservation for my party of 12. We waited 4 1/2 hours, but you know what? It was worth it. And it has always been worth it since, though after that experience, waiting the average hour or two seems like a paltry sum of time. Did I mention they also deliver now??

Hands down the best place to get food in Syracuse. We all know the University drives the city, well Dinosaur BBQ is next in line. If you ever get within a 25 mile radius of Syracuse, you need to go here. You know it must be pretty special when your professor takes his whole class to dinner here one night. I suggest the sample-ish plate that include: baby back ribs, pulled pork, and something else - I'm blanking out. I'm from the North so I don't know about good BBQ too much, so when I had the baked beans here, I died, considering I'm used to beans out of a can. Unfortunately, it seems like this place fills up quickly so make a reservation ahead of time!

This was my third trip to Dinosaur - and because of the looooong lines, my first time finally getting to chow down. ?This place did not let me down at all. ?It is straight up fire-pit deliciousness. First off, the wings. ?The Wings!!! ?They were so juicy, and such good quality meat that wing and non-wing fans alike will be drooling for a second bite moments after the first. ?I tried them with both the Garlic Chipotle ["hottest"] and the Devil's Duel [the *real* heat]. ?Both sauces were spicy, and a nice change from standard buffalo. ? After the wings, my meal is a blur of silent gorging. ?I ordered the rib and texas brisket combo with salted potatoes [which I swear are covered in crack sauce] and mac n' cheese [my southern dream come true]. ?No greens for me. ?I support the "no rib left behind act", so my plate was mostly clean - except for the brisket fat [and that is just a matter of taste]. ? Plus, they have a solid brew list to boot. But, if you're going on a weekend, honey, make a reservation! ?Otherwise you're looking at a 1 and a half to two hour wait. ?I LOVE meat, but even this girls got her limits.

I only give it one star because I honestly don't really like BBQ. It's greasy, fatty, and covered in oil. Not my first choice in type of food to eat. But of course, BBQ lovers know this and don't care. That probably affected my review of the place. It just seemed too grimey inside for me, filled with men (nothing wrong with that!) I got the hot bbq wings and some bbq ribs. I will say, that I liked my corn bread. The wings were great but the ribs were just okay. It was so messy, I used like 20 napkins throughout lunch. The hostess is a sweet lady, I like her. But this one waitress we got, who was talking to a table of guys right next to ours, outspokenly talked about a group of 16 she served and not one of them ordered an alcoholic drink, and 2 of the 16 ordered Cokes. What is wrong with that? Some people don't drink and prefer water over sugared & ?high-calorie drinks. And also, it's a recession and people are looking for ways to save. I didn't think it was very respectful for this chick to downtalk and disrespect her past customers. This is why you probably don't get enough tip. She was super slow with our food, our check, getting boxes for our leftovers, and everything. The bus boy is also actually very nice and GREAT! Very courteous. He should definitely be promoted to a server, I wish our tip money could have been given to him because he did all the work! Please fire that waitress and hire a new one.

Solid BBQ that is worth the trip to Harlem. ?The ambience is perfect for a BBQ joint. ?It's unpolished, gritty, dark, and hip music floods the air. ?Hardly a more relaxing place can be found in the city to eat ribs and drink beer. ? I ordered a combination plate that provided a partial rack of ribs, BBQ pulled pork. corn bread, pork and beans, and mac and cheese. ?The flavors in both the ribs and the pulled pork were quite good. ?Sophisticated, smoky, sweet, but nuanced, I was hooked at the first bite. ?The mac and cheese was very creamy and good. ?The beans were disappointing; I really thought these could have been much better with the inclusion of molasses or brown sugar for example. ?I also had their sweet tea which as good as the many I have had living in Virginia. ?A great place to be at ease with solid BBQ, I'll definitely be back!

This place is definitely one of the better BBQ places in New York City. ?I recommend it over the Dallas BBQ spots that you find everywhere. ?The one in Rochester, NY is a little bit better, especially when it comes to the sides but that is for another review. Be prepared for a long wait unless you could reserve in advance because this place is always packed. ?Weekdays it's busy. ?Weekends it's busier. ?You could order the same food for take out if you are in a hurry and don't need to dine in. ?There is a counter just for takeouts. There is a bar by the door for those that just want to drink or to get drunk while waiting. The place is pretty cheap considering the portions and the fact that it's mostly meat. ?There is one kind of meat combo all the way to a choice of three different meat combos. ?All of the combos comes with two sides of your choosing and a cornbread. I prefer baby back ribs which this place don't carry but the it's still pretty good. ?I like the rub seasoning on it. The brisket is nicely spiced and pulls apart easily. ? The chicken is good but not great. ? It tastes like grilled chicken. ?Nothing more. ? I think it could be a little more moist. ? Dinosaur BBQ have their own selection of sauces. ?Put them on the BBQ meats and everything tastes better. ?The sauce is pretty good here. ?There is even a spicy version for people like me that likes everything hotter. For the sides I highly recommend getting the Syracuse Style Salt Potatoes as one of the choices. ?Very nicely buttered flavored. ?Very tender. ?The ?soup of the day is a great choice too although for the soup you have to pay 50 cents extra. Definitely try out the Swag Drunken Spicy Shrimp Boil Plate as the appetizer. ?It's not really spicy but it is very well seasoned with dry spices and herbs. ?I get it every time I'm here. My friend had the steak the last time we were there. ?From the sample bite I took from it, I would recommend that as something to try also. ?Very well done and juicy. ?Fresh tasting and not overcooked at all. For those interested in good micro brew beers. ?They have a good selection here for you to try. ?Order the sampler if you don't know what to choose. ?That way they give you three small cups of your choice.

Dinosaur Bar-B-Que is an import from upstate... A graduate of Syracuse University, I was familiar with Dinosaur's extremely famous Syracuse location. It was a little roadhouse-style place with a line wrapped around the door, sticky floors, good beer n' ribs, and no less than twenty motorcycles perched out front. Naturally, I was excited to see how the NYC location would compare. Let's just put it this way. It is near-impossible to just "create" a place that bikers will flock to. And a new place is just not going to have the layers of spilled beer and spilled BBQ sauce that accumulate on the floor to give it its signature stickiness. That atmosphere just cannot be replicated! The food is good, the service friendly, and the atmosphere is nice (and by "nice," I mean, it lacks the "shady charm" of its upstate cousin). I even saw Julia Styles eat here once. So, you see, the NYC Dinosaur lacks the "biker dive" feel, and has become more of a "family restaurant." So, I like the Dinosaur. Really, I do. It's just hard for it to live up to my upstate-Dinosaur-expectations!

My take on Dinosaur is that it has good barbecue and a great atmosphere. The bbq isn't amazing, but in my opinion this is something that really doesn't exist in NYC. To find amazing barbecue, you have to go to KC or Memphis or NC. New York has good barbecue and has made strides in recent years, but great it's not. Dinosaur, thought, serves pretty good barbecue in terms of the ribs, chicken and pulled pork. The fries are also awesome. And the service was wonderful and patient (we were at a big table with tiny kids). The bar area is also fun (I like how they display beers on the board with their alcohol content instead of prices). When all is said and done, Dinosaur makes for a fun night out. It's definitely worth checking out, even if it's not earth-shattering bbq.

I wish I could give this place 10 stars... hell 20. This Barbeue is damn fine. Now I have had ribs and pulled pork and brisket before. But this... well this was just straight up good. Now I did my research. I knew to make a reservation and then expect to wait about an hour. To some this might be news. Just remember Bar-B-Que takes time to cook and eat. And once you look at the dessert menu... or try the beer you will see just why people linger around drinking the DINO ale (citrus and hop goodness perfect for food) and eating the sweet potato pie (light and delicious with pecans and whipped cream.) The main dishes/apps are also something to behold. If you in anyway like fried things try the fried green tomatos. Ha try to eat one TRY IT! anything with meat is also good because these boys know very much how to barbecue. Overall this place is a must try for anyone unless you grew up in the south working at a ribshack that consistently won best sauce awards or best barbecue...

1. ?The best ?mac and cheese I've ever had. ?I think it has chili powder on it. ?Entrees come with two sides. ?Don't be afraid to make it mac and cheese for both. 2. ?The sample platters are easily enough for two people, usually with some left over. 3. ?Very reasonable prices. 4. ?Great brisket. 5. ?Free soda refills. ?Once they just gave in and brought us some pitchers so we could do the dirty work ourselves. ?I felt like I was at Pizza Hut in Ohio, in a good way. 6. ?Very accessible from the subway. 7. ?Do yourself a favor and make a reservation before going, it will save you from the long lines.

Still picking delicious pieces of animal from my teeth! ?This place rocks and should get 5 stars but the wait was long (not their fault) and I'm a little hung over as I write this (and still not their fault) but whatever. ?If I had to be a slightly critical it was a bit of a pain in the arse getting there (had a zipcar for the day so it was easier) and they really don't have a hot sauce with balls. ?The wango tango or tango wango is good but not really hot like the label claims. Bartenders were delightful, service was perfect and the food a 10. ?Blue Smoke doesn't have deek on this place. ?I like to think of Dinosaur as a Famous Daves on performance enhancing drugs - slightly melancholy to find out there are multiple locations, but got over it in a day or three. ?Going back soon...

Went on a Saturday afternoon with reservations... thank goodness. We arrived with 5 minutes to spare and there were people waiting all over to get seated. The menu reminded me of a Flinstone cartoon. Nothing but MEAT MEAT MEAT... with an occasional grilled chicken sandwich but that's not what you go here for. Meats slathered in BBQ sauce and sides piled high. For the amount of food you get it is way under priced. We ordered the chili w/ nachos that feeds 2-3 ppl. SOOOO GOOD!!!! I ordered the traditional sampler platter which consisted of a 1/4 rack of ribs, 1/2 chicken, ?beef brisket and 2 sides. I think I took a bite of each and wrapped everything up to go. There was just so much of everything! The atmosphere is laid back and the service is friendly. AND there's parking available up and down the street right outside which we all know is rare for eating out anywhere except suburbia.

The Bar-b-Que Chicken Wings appetizer was very good. The exterior displays that subtle char that's indicative of grilling over a live flame. The winglets and drumlets are big meaty pieces. And, the flavor is a good semi-spicy flavor. Next, I tried the Drunken Spicy Shrimp. They were average sized shrimp boiled in beer, and sprinkled with spices. It came with a habanero cocktail sauce that turned out very good. Ribs were very good. The smoky flavor is present. Then once your teeth sink into the ribs, you get some nice juicy meat. The Pulled Pork was just as I last remembered, soo juicy and succulent. It's incredibly moist and juicy without being overly fatty. For my sides, I went with the Creole Potato Salad, and the Coleslaw. The coleslaw was ok. And, the Creole Potato salad was a bit salty. The flavors in this just didn't balance out. Overall, this is a great bbq spot. They serve the best Pulled Pork I've ever had, a very good brisket, very good ribs, and some very good wings. I'm looking at their menu again, and there are quite a few dishes that I want to go back to sample; for no other reason than, I like the way they flavor and cook their dishes. For my next few visits I'll have my eyes on: - Chili on the half shell - Cubano sandwich - Brisket Smothered sandwich - Pulled Pork + Grilled Portobello sandwich - Pork-Sket sandwich (brisket, pulled pork, cheese, coleslaw) - Half Bar-b-q chicken - Bbq Beef Ribs Korean Style - Bbq Fried Rice

If your a fan of CHICKEN WINGS then you must mark this spot on your "Places To Go Before I Die" list! Is it the BEST BBQ FOOD in NYC?: No (but pretty darn tasty) Do they have the best darn Chicken Wings you have ever tasted in your entire life?: Yes (just my opinion of course) Fall of the bone meat, grilled to perfection, smoked BBQ style, big & meaty CHICKEN WINGS. ?Chicken at it's best baby! If it wasn't for the amazing chicken wings I'd probably be a little unhappy with my 2 hour wait for dinner on a Friday night. This place get's PACKED. I don't think it's completely worth that long of a wait so I suggest you check this place out on a weeknight. If your in the mood for some pretty darn good BBQ then this is worth the stop. I'm not crazy about all the items on the menu but If you'd like my suggestions I'd say order the... Chicken Wings BBQ Ribs Friend Green Tomatoes You can't go wrong! ;-)

5 stars, the best ribs I have ever had, but you can read that time and time again in every review on this page (except for a few haters) so I'll talk about something a little different. After going there today I decided to see if I could find it in Grand Theft Auto IV, and guess what? ?It's in the game! ?It goes under the name Meat Factory but if you go to the corner that the place is at in the city in the game you'll see it there, different name like I said but it looks just the same, made me feel pretty happy that some developer somewhere liked it enough to stick it in a video game. So go there, BUT MAKE RESERVATIONS!!!! Seriously, even today at 2 pm there was an hour wait. ?Oh, and get the deviled eggs.

Ok, really, not the best BBQ as was promised. We had the chicken wings that everyone raves about, which was not good but not bad. They were just chicken wings. I had the beef ribs. They were good, but really extra fatty and the sauce that was used wasn't my favorite. My friend had the pork ribs which he seemed to like. I wasn't satisfied with my meal, or the portions, or the service. The service was horrible. It took the waitress ages to even ask us what we wanted to drink, and then it went all downhill from there. Just a tip: you probably shouldn't come here on a romantic date. Atmosphere is definitely not romantic. More like frat house barnyard.

Fo sho not the same as it is upstate, BUT, having access to Dinosaur when I'm back east (yes, I say that now too) visiting my parents or old friends, well quite frankly it's the bomb. I mean, knowing I don't ever have to travel back to Syracuse for the one thing I will really ever miss about it, that is just priceless. Oh Dinosaur, how I love thee...let me count the ways... 1- the sweetheart deal for 2, just for me. A rack of ribs and I think 4 sides-- and I can slam most of that down and take some home for later 2- ribs, ribs, ribs 3- macaroni salad 4- beans beans... 5- oh the sauces! 6- a faster drive there from NJ than on the subway from lower Manhattan! You MUST go there-- prices are way cheap though still more than upstate, but who wouldn't expect that?

Delicious. Very, very good Bar-B-Q. Definitely up there with some of the places I have been to in the Southern US. We started with some wings, which were outstanding, with their zingy sauce. Then I moved on to BBQ Chicken, cornbread (which seems to come with every meal), corn on the cob and some Salt Potatoes (never had, but quite good). All washed down with some very good Sweet Iced Tea. I can imagine the place getting busy on a weekend night. As for hard to find, I didn't think so. 6 blocks north of the 125th Station on the 1, or just a slightly longer walk from the 125th Station on the A/C/D/B line. There are lots of pork options (as expected from a BBQ place) with a lesser (but still solid) amount of chicken/beef/fish options. Definitely worth the trip uptown.

Pretty good. We have been to most of the BBQ joints in the city and this seems to be the most authentic for lack of a better word not that there is any truly authentic BBQ in NYC but this is close. It is a fun spot. We went before it was popular. Now there is usually a wait. Portion sizes are great. Not dry rub which is good.We like sauce. There were several choices of sauce ?to choose from on the table so you could put it on yourself and try them all. ? Large bar for drinks that gave the room a little flavor. Location is good in Harlem. Sides were good, the cole slaw was good, beans were savory, mac cheese was not memorable.

There are very few things Syracuse has that Manhattan doesn't. Up until 2004, one of those rare entities was Dinosaur Bar-B-Que, a popular and delicious bbq restaurant. For years, students and locals in Syracuse enjoyed the ribs, chicken wings, pulled pork sandwiches, and plethora of other goods Dinosaur BBQ offered, but now, city dwellers too can take part in the grand eating festivities. Located in West Harlem on 131st and 12th Avenue, Dinosaur BBQ is privy to both locals and many commuters who are interested in some fine BBQ dining. The ride on the 1 train uptown to Dino is emblematic of the ride on the 7 out to Citi Field for me or on the 6 to Yankee Stadium for most other New Yorkers-filled with anticipation, excessive on-topic discussions, and pure excitement for an unforgettable, near-future experience. The restaurant is nothing short of bustling. Impossible to get a reservation, patrons-loyal or not-are forced to wait up to an hour (and sometimes more), until they can start feasting. The large bar area helps take an eater's mind off the drool-worthy food that will, in an hour's time, be lathered around your mouth, and licked off fingers. Every night, the bar has drinks specials-for instance, $3 Coronas. Considering most drinkers are used to $6 beers around the city, a sub-$4 alcoholic beverage is almost laughable. Regardless of drinks, the eye is still on the prize-the ribs. Once seated, you'll notice you're not rubbing elbows with neighbors, but actually have wiggle room. This is all necessary since you need more room to eat bbq than any other food. The waitstaff is friendly, and knows all too well that you've come hungry. You can't really go wrong with anything on the menu, but if you've made a trip to Dinosaur BBQ, you might as well go for their rack of ribs. If you're going with a friend or companion-and you both like ribs-the full rack (which comes with two sides, and the automatic pieces of cornbread) should do the trick. There is also an option called the "Sweetheart Deal," that for an additional $3, you can add on two more sides. The mac 'n cheese is a must, but despite the perfectly baked creaminess, let's not forget about the main event, the ribs. There is an on-going debate amongst rib aficionados about using dry rub or bbq sauce. Both are great in their own right, but Dinosaur BBQ uses a dry rub, which in my opinion, is superior. Ribs with bbq sauce might seem like a more authentic bbq experience, but in actuality, it's just a messier one. If anything, a good dry rub enhances the quality meat, whereas an overwhelming bbq sauce can be, well, overwhelming. The ribs, to use a standard good rib description, are "fall-off-the-bone." Moist, succulent, and tasty. Each bite is better than the last, and the experience, like all great food experiences, goes too quickly. The great part about ribs though is, unlike other cleaner foods, that even when you're done eating, your fingers still have to be cleaned "somehow." Note: your best bet to get a table is to plan far ahead of time. However, if you're going more on a whim, going closer towards 5:30 will significantly improve your chances of not waiting for a table. Rib Prices: 1/2 rack ($15.95), 3/4 rack ($20.95), full rack ($24.95), and "Sweetheart Deal" ($27.95) Contact: 646 West 131st Street (212) 694-1777 http://DinosaurBarBQue.c…

dogfish head 90-minute IPA on tap what whaaatt came here for a dinner with our consultant and manager from HQ, and it ended up being the best work dinner i've ever attended (probably because the median age of our group was 27 while it's usually in the 40s). big space with a large bar area. had cute little etchings on the bar. pretty sure we got the sweetheart deal aka a full rack o'ribs plus four sides. fatty mcfat fat. among the sides we got were mac 'n cheese, slaw, and some tater thing. we also got these wings...and OH MY GOODNESS were they spicy. i think we got wango tango and something spicier....died a little. thank goodness for the ice cold dogfish that i had to wash down the fire in my throat. but, they were delicious. what is it about incredibly spicy food that keeps us coming back for more? the rib rack itself was amazing. really well prepared, you can tell that they focus on their marinade. the sides went really well with the pork. meat didn't fall off perfectly on every rib but it was fine, gotta get down and dirty with bbq and it tasted delicious nonetheless. recommend for some quality bbq.

RAAAAAAAWR I love dinosaurs (Though I admit that I got a little freaked out by them after I read/saw Jurassic Park back in the day. ?Specifically velociraptors, xkcd style. http://xkcd.com/135/). ?I also love BBQ. ?So how could a trip to Dinosaur BBQ be anything less than great??? Jason H was in town from Boston, and we decided to hit this place up at the last second. ?Hearing about the constant lines and huge waits for dinner, we decided to go for lunch and showed up at noon on a Saturday. ?We met Michelle K here, and arrived to plenty of empty tables (which were all filled by about 1:15 or so). First nice thing: a solid beer selection, though I wish the prices were a bit better (~$7 for most pints, if I recall, though it's nice that they offer half pints as well) ?I went with an old classic, the Dogfish Head 90 Minute IPA. ?Mmmmmmmmmm. We split an order of the fried green tomatoes at the behest of many other Yelpers, and I was very glad we did - they were perfectly fried and a great start to the meal. ?The buttermilk ranch dressing that they come with was almost drinkably delicious. And then came the MEAT. ?I went with the 1/4 rack of ribs/pulled pork combo, with whipped sweet potatoes, mac n' cheese and cornbread on the side. ?The pulled pork was very good, but I thought the ribs were the real winner between the two. ?Both were extremely tender, and were complemented super well by Dinosaur's outstanding classic BBQ sauce. ?The mac was fine, but nothing special. ?The cornbread was disappointing, which was sad, because I love cornbread. ?Pretty bland, and no butter or anything to add to it. ?The sweet potatoes, meanwhile, were AMAZING. ?Chock full of brown sugary, buttery goodness, and the candied nuts on top were a fantastic touch. This may not be the absolute best BBQ in the universe, but it's definitely the best of the first few places that I've hit up in NY (the other two being Mables in Williamsburg and Blue Smoke in Flatiron). ?I'll definitely be looking for excuses to make the trek back up here in the very near future!

Compared to other places in NYC, this probably deserves 4 stars. ?Compared to the best BBQ elsewhere, this probably deserves 1.5 stars. ? Very good chicken wings, decent beer list, very average everything else. ?The problem isn't so much DBBQ, but New York BBQ in general. ?The competition is so dismal that average BBQ tastes good and good BBQ tastes great. ?Pick this place up and move it to Texas or Kansas City or North Carolina and it goes out of business. ?Drop it in NYC and it is some of the best around. Getting some to go and sitting by the river is almost always a good idea if you are are hungry and in the neighborhood, as it is the best BBQ for miles.

This bbq here is pretty good. ?I split the "Sampler Extreme" (1/2 chicken, 1/2 rack of ribs, beef brisket, 2 sides) & the fried green tomatoes with a friend. ?The bbq is pretty juicy and even the white meat was moist and tender. ?They also have various sauces of varying levels of spiciness at the table - the best being the regular Dinosaur BBQ Sauce, which was smoky and just a slight bit tangy. ?The tomatoes were also tasty, but then, I like anything that's breaded and fried. ?The sides of mac & cheese and collard greens were decent too, but the portions were really small. ?I would've liked A LOT of mac. We tried a couple of their desserts and they were good, but not memorable. ?If it were up to me, I would have had another two ribs instead. I was a fan of their root beer on tap. ?It was really strong and thick (almost to the point of creaminess). Service was good - the waiter was busy, but he stopped by a few times to ask how things were. Don't know if I would come all the way uptown for Dinosaur considering that there are other good bbq places (Brother Jimmy's, Duke's) that are more convenient for me, but I'm glad I came to try it this time.

Very good BBQ but the meat didn't live up to the hype. ?Chalk the hype to NYCers exuberance, their desire for great BBQ, and the prime location (just a few short minutes from the 125th st. 1 station). Here's my take on the food... Chicken Wings - The Honey BBQ wings are FANTASTIC. ?Grilled not fried. ?Lots of meat. ?Sweet flavor vs the usual tobasco-driven heat. ?Best meat item I've had here. ?Wing haters at our table were converted like an 8 year old kosher Jew taking his first bite of bacon. ?(Also tried the Hot Wango Tango wings - very flavorful as well with just an additional notch of heat replacing the sweet) Fried Green Tomatoes - I liked this dish slightly better than I liked the movie. ?Works for some. ?Not me. Pulled Pork - I had this as part of a platter and it didn't wow me. ?Comes dry and is served in fairly nice-sized strips (vs shredded). ?Requires some BBQ sauce to flavor it up. ?Might be better in a sandwich. ? Pork Ribs - Had a nice texture and amount of meat on them but, like the pork, was a little lacking in flavor. ?Doesn't match the ribs at Daisy May or Rack & Soul but didn't stop me from de-meating the bones. Brisket - Most disappointing meat of the tres hombres meat platter - kind of like the Screech to the Pulled Pork and Pork Ribs' Zach and AC Slater. ?I found it fatty and not flavorful enough. ?I prefer Hill Country and Spanky's brisket. ?Again, like the pork, might be better in a sandwich. Mac & Cheese - Fantastic. ?The cheese is really flavorful. ?Not sure what cheese they use and how bad for me it is but kudos. Salted Potatoes - Very tasty roasted potatoes. ?Not as eye-rollingly good as the Mac & Cheese (or the wings) but a good counterpoint. Beer - Great selection on tap and in bottle Prices - Very fair pricing. ?The Tres Hombres meal which included the Pulled Pork, Pork Ribs, Brisket and two sides was $18. ?The wings are only 13 for $11 which, given the size of the wings, is more than fair. Atmosphere - Has a shack kind of feel that feels more imported from the South than this place's northern NY roots (started in Syracuse, has another place in Rochester). ?Very comfortable. ?Friendly service. Ease of Getting a Table: This is one tough place to get a table. ?Best bets are to come w/ as few people as possible and be prepared to sit at the bar or on the outside picnic tables (which don't have table service - you have to order things to go). ?Perhaps this isn't so crowded in cold months but went on a recent summer Thursday night and there were long waits as of 9:30PM (we somehow snagged a table for 8 by a fluke). So I'd say that everything here is 5-star except for the meat (wings excluded) which is a shame since that's what they're supposed to be best at. ?Deduct one star for that. I'll go again but still searching for a favorite BBQ spot in the city (Rack and Soul my favorite for now...)

Trekked all the way here from Jersey City on a Sunday night for my dear friend Lena's birthday. ?She was a smart chick and made her reservations at 7:30PM but told us that they were at 7PM. ? So why is it when I got there at 7:20PM a table wasn't even ready for us? ?It wasn't ready at 7:30PM either or 7:45PM or 8PM... ?and when one of our friends went to complain the hostess was so rude using statements like, "Well that's not how we do it here in New York" and "Do you understand what I am saying?" What is the point of a reservation if there is no table being reserved??? I think we finally got our table around 8:30PM. ?One full hour after the reservation. Luckily we had a really great crowd so it didn't feel as long. We ordered the fried green tomatoes and the Buffalo Wings with the chipotle sauce for appetizers. ?I think the buffalo wings were probably the best ones I have ever had. ?I'm usually not a big fan because they are really messy and hard to eat in public, but for these wings/thighs I just might wait again and eat until my fingers are marinated through. I ordered the Brisket with Mac and Cheese and Fries. ?I have to say, I was not a big fan of the brisket. ?It had too much visible fat ( I know, I know, that is what brisket is... my bad..) and I just couldn't physically swallow it. ?I tried to cut off the fat which made me realize is what makes the brisket good in the first place, without it you are left with really dry meat.. :( ?Next time I will know better and order the pulled pork. ?Yes, it may be just as fattening, but I can't see it and I think that is what is important here. ?Denial. But let me tell you what really made my day. ?The Mac and Cheese was one of the best sides I have ever tasted in my life. ?I started with that and was really sad when all of it was gone and all I had left was my brisket. ?What I should have done was ordered Mac and Cheese with a side of brisket. ? The cornbread wasn't to die for either. ?Kind of dry and grainy to be honest. I have some leftover ribs at home which I will try tonight, hopefully it will be really good. The pulled pork from my boyfriend's plate was awesome. I could have put some of that on my mac and cheese. There was also another side that surprised me - it was a pork fried rice dish - tasted like Chinatown which really impressed me since I did not expect that at a BBQ joint. I love me some BBQ so I would come back for the pulled pork, mac and cheese, bbq fried rice, fried green tomatoes, and the buffalo wings. But it's really far so I might just have to find some more suitable downtown. All in all, not bad but the service combined with the wait combined with the distance and the bad brisket does not a happy "fingerlickin'" Vicky make.

If you're looking to get down and dirty in a formal dinning style, then this is the place to be (ahahah...ironic isn't it??) I came here twice and both times I ordered their wings and dang was it finger-licking good. Generally when I order Buffalo wings, I know off the bat that they are fried in a tub of grease and then toss in a buttered of generic bbq tabasco sauce. But no surey bob, not here! Instead their wings are slowly smoked to perfection and you know this, because their meat is pink and slightly chard on the outside to give it that down-right bbq taste. I also had their ribs and chicken and yes they were also very yummy. As far as their décor, it's actually really nice. Very woody, festive, dim and bustling, especially on a Friday night and weekends. I highly recommend calling for reservation and oh yeah, if I haven't emphasized it enough already, the WINGS!!!!

Hands down this is my favorite place for BBQ in NYC to date. ?Unfortunately for my taste buds (fortunately for my waist line) they are a bit out of the way and require a dedicated effort to visit. The wings with wango tango sauce, the ribs, barbque chicken, and carrot raisin salad stand out. They also have a great beer selection. They've recently moved across the street to a larger location which helps open the place up a bit more.

If you've never had BBQ for lunch, you should seriously consider trying it. ?Life is too short to have salads for lunch . . . although your doctor might tell you having BBQ for lunch might shorten your life even more. ?Well, moderation is key, but you already knew that. My friend and I did come here for lunch 2 weeks ago. ?He spoke very highly of this place, and parking is usually not a problem in this part of town. ?As soon as we walked in, I immediately felt as though I was in "a genuine honky tonk rib joint," as advertised. ?It took me 3 seconds to forget we were in New York City; it really did feel like a Southern BBQ establishment. ?In fact, they tried so hard to create the authentic ambiance, I think they may have gone a bit over the top. ?If it hadn't been for the urban-style graffiti on the bathroom wall, I might have been convinced I was teleported to the South. The staff here is so friendly and nice, it makes the sweet BBQ sauce taste like vinegar. ?I mean, is anyone really that genuinely nice? ?If not, they're putting on a hell of a performance. ?Our waitress was incredibly helpful and polite, although the service is really, really s-l-o-w. ?Even though the restaurant was barely at 5% capacity, we had to wait a good long while for our food. ?The drink refills also took a bit longer than they should have. As for the food itself . . . it's pretty good but not spectacular. ?The fried green tomatoes tasted pretty bland; all I could taste was the sweetness of the batter with just a hint of sourness of the tomato. ?It needed something else for that complete taste. All of Dinosaur's combos come with ribs, which are messy and awkward to eat. ?Our waitress generously allowed us to create our own combos that excluded ribs. ?I went for the 2-item combo with beef brisket and pulled pork. ?The brisket, tender and flavorful, ?was sliced up beautifully on my plate. ?The pulled pork looked like a hot mess of shredded meat. ?It tasted a bit dry, if you ask me. ?The sides were pretty interesting, too. ?My mac 'n' cheese wasn't particularly memorable, but my Syracuse Style Salt Potatoes were. ?I remember them as being uncomfortably salty. ?Coarse salt blanketing potato wedges - that takes some time to get used to. Finally, yet another slogan found on the Dinosaur BBQ menus and even their homepage reads: "if you leave here hungry, it's your fault." ?You can blame me if you want, but I've had traditional "honky tonk" barbecue, and those portions are much, much bigger. ***3.5 stars, rounded down. ?Pretty good, but there's substantial room for improvement.

Great place to eat, especially after long run uptown (highly encourage it)! It's always crowded and there is a long wait-time, but it's a great place to go, especially with a group of friends. The portions are good and their range of sauces are amazing. I recommend getting any of the combo dishes so that you can try a bunch of different meats. I think the pork tasted the best (soft, tender, juicy). Their ribs could have been better. As always, I checked the bathroom, and it's relatively clean, especially for a restaurant with such high traffic. This means the kitchen must be clean as well! Definitely a must-check-out BBQ joint.

I've toured most of the country and made a point of trying barbeque from as many places as possible (Carolinas, Memphis, Texas and Kansas City). ?Dinosaur can more than hold their own. ? I've been on a diet and had to stay away from stuff like this; which make the fact that it exists within such close proximity a cruel reality. ?However, one day a week I have a splurge. ?A few weeks ago, it was Dinosaur's turn. ?Yes we had a reservation and we still had to wait. ?I did not care. ?They still got 5 stars. The brisket was impeccable. ?I tried a rib (the meatiest rib I've ever tried). ?The chicken was cooked to perfection. ?The macaroni and cheese...the macaroni and cheese...(dream sequence)...wow. ?None of it is technically good for you (even the vegetables are well marbled) but this was good for the soul. ? To put it optimistically, Dinosaur Barbeque is ample inspiration to hit the gym hard and faithfully.

This Dinosaur puts the ass in jurassic. OK, welcome to NY. Something as old and established as BBQ is gonna cost you a lot. Fine. Even in Harlem. Fine. It's worth it. Dinosaur BBQ's Harlem location has the space and personnel for a location in Topeka. Sadly, it's located in a city of millions. Expect to wait for an hour or two even on a Wednesday night. If you're lucky enough, you can snag a bar area seat. The bar is so welcoming and friendly and full of delicious options that you might just overlook the amazingly good root beer on tap. Get it!! The food generally lives up to it's much toted reputation. The salt potatoes were a let down, but the green tomatoes were not. The portions live up to the prices and the food is so well seasoned and heated. ?Brisket and cornbread aside, the wings, for me, make a trip to Dinosaur worth it. These things don't go near a deep-fryer. Grilled and coated in delicious sauce, these wings belong in my life forever. Don't wear your nicest clothes to Dinosaur. The ventilation has a lot to be desired and you will smell like a grill when you leave.

If you are in the NYC area and craving BBQ I reccomend Dino BBQ. Warning, Warning, if you plan on eating at this establishment please make reservations or be prepared to wait an hour or two. ?Yes, the restaurant is very popular and the food is in my term 'on point". ?I had a lttle taste of everything: Devil Eggs were delicious, the BBQ Wings had good smoke flavor and seasonings, the Ribs were tender and had a good smoke ring, the sides (Mac n Cheese, Collard Greens, Corn Bread, Roasted Whipped Sweet Potatoes) were all good. Overall Dino BBQ was delicious and the best BBQ in the NYC area.

This is one of those places that is so far out of the way that by the time you get there any food will be the 'best food you ever had'. ?I'm sorry, I like BBQ, but this simply was not top quality. ?It was average at best, but served in a very unique restaurant / bar. ?The ambiance at this place is pretty neat - if you idea of ambiance is old license plates nailed to the wall. ?If you have a Harley and a few tatoos, you'll feel right at home here. ?If you wish you had a Harley and a few tatoos, you can come here and pretend that you do. ?I think the places attracks more of the latter group of people, although it certainly has a loyal biker crowd who visit. I walked from central Harlem out to this restaurant, mostly in hopes of getting good BBQ. ?For the trip out here, it wasn't worth it. ?If I lived in the neighborhood, it might be the only BBQ restaurant within walking distance.

So many glowing reviews on here that it makes me feel like it is pointless to add my two cents.... BUT i had such a good experience, I might as well chime in! I went to college near Sracuse and regret never making it over to the original dino BBQ. This place was damn fun. The sides are delicious, meats are good, beers are so tasty, and the scene is way cool. I felt like I was siting in a shack by a swamp down south (minus flies, mud, and weird smells).

My boyfriend and I went here a couple weeks ago with 2 of our close friends after spending the day at the Museum of Natural History w/ the dinosaurs. (a ?dinosaur themed day, super cheesy and fantastic!) None of us had really eaten during the day so by the time we got all the way up there we were starved. It was a Saturday night around 6pm so the place was slammed and the hostess alerted us of a 45min wait. Oh darn, we have to go and have a few drinks at the bar while we wait for a table! haha! but as we walked over to the bar, another member of the staff was very helpful in letting us know that we could eat at one of the tables in the bar area and there was no wait for them. So we did, and because of our hunger we ordered a little bit of everything. The food runner actually laughed at us when he got to the table and saw just the four of us sitting there. The food was AWESOME! by far one of the best BBQ places in the city. So to sum it up, the food was delicious, the staff was delightful, and after a couple buckets of pbr and shitload of BBQ'd meat, each of us only dropped about 30 dollars. Huge fan! will definitely be back!

This and Fairway are the only two reasons I miss living up in this area. ?Dinosaur is my favorite BBQ place in the city. ?They have the perfect level of smoke flavor in all of their meats. ?The pork is a bit less smoky so you can still get the wonderful flavor of the delicate pork, and the brisket is a bit more smoky to better match the bold flavor of the beef. ?Also, all of the meats are wonderfully tender and juicy. Their baked beans are addictive. ?They put bits of the pulled pork in here, and you can see the diced peppers they use for a very small bit of kick. ? The mac and cheese is by far the best I've had at any BBQ place. ?The cheese is REALLY flavorful and doesn't get rubbery or runny if it's not the perfect temperature. ?I could eat this all the time. Same goes for the Salt Potatoes. ?The sauce they are in is absolutely perfect. The coleslaw is just average in my opinion. ?Not bad, but get any of the 3 above instead. The ambiance here is not great as it is ALWAYS packed beyond belief. ?There's usually not much room to move around and it's VERY loud. ?But it's still worth it. ?Or you can just do take out :-) Water Refill Meter: 2/5 It's always too busy to expect this level of service. ?You have to actively track down someone to get what you need most of the time.

"Barely warm" pork ribs that were tough, tough, tough! I like my ribs falling off the bone and melting in my mouth, but you won't find ribs like that at Dinosaur BBQ. The kind waiter re-heated my ribs, but they still weren't worth the calories to eat. All of the sides were "Barely warm" as well. Macaroni Cheese, potatoes, BBQ beans....all still cool in the center. ? Not one of my better dining experiences. The two stars are for the waiter. He was great!

The best barbeque I've had in NYC to date (besides whatever I had at Big Apple Barbeque, but that's different). This locale is in the middle of nowhere a few blocks away from 125th street 1 train station, but those few blocks are kinda scary if you're walking alone at night under the highway and near shuttered warehouses. Then you see the haven, the warm glowing lights coming from an establishment with the word BARBEQUE written big on the side. We've arrived! Hallelujah! Inside it's warm, festive, homey, just perfect. I felt like the outside world just melted away and that I will forever be safe, full and happily stuffed with barbeque, almost like I was whisked away to a local bar in the South. The hostess calls out tables using a microphone broadcast. We had reservations so we were seated within 10 minutes, at a table near the bar. Okay, not so nice like a booth but we'll take it. We ordered sweetheart deal (full rack of ribs with 4 sides) and a half BBQ chicken, but then decided to order another full house special (1/4 rack and 1/2 chicken) after we devoured the first round and left hungering for more. Actually, correction. We weren't hungry, we just wanted MOREEEE!!! I was in love with the ribs. Not too fatty, not too lean, and grilled and smoked to perfection with a tinge of burned skin and juicy suckings all the way to the bone. I gave up using a fork and knife after my second rib. The chicken was also very delicious, the flesh oozing with juice and squishy with tenderness. I heart the dinosaur hot sauce because it gave an extra notch of spiciness and kick. The sides (iceberg lettuce with special dinosaur BBQ sauce, carrots and raisin salad, bbq pork and beans and the sweet potato whippings) were all excellent. Absolutely nothing to complain about and I can see no room for improvement, absolutely none. This meal was a revelation because after going to all the fancy-mancy bbq joints around the city I was resigned to the fact that I will never get the kind of BBQ ribs I dream about, that I REMEMBER existed but could never quite possess again. I got it tonight. Waitress service, noise level, crowd and vibe were great. The only thing was maybe it could be a bit brighter but that would just be to feast with my eyes along with my mouth and stomach :)

To the whiners and complainers: Re: the Service: This is Dinosaur BBQ. If you've been to their locations upstate, then you know that their service isn't meant to be "nice" or "helpful." It's supposed to be "sassy," and I've actually been disappointed when it hasn't been. It's part of the charm of a biker-bar-type barbeque joint. Re: the Food: I'll agree, it can be hit or miss. I've had some really dry meat before. But the sides are awesome, and the hot wings - grilled, not fried - are unique and delicious. It won't compare to some of the places in the South, but not much in New York City can. Re: the crowds: Yeah, the wait sucks at night. But I go on weekend afternoons with some friends, and we almost never have to wait. And if we do, we just go to the bar. The beer selection is great, and their house beer and drinks in mason jars are delicious and reasonably priced.

My GF has never had amazing BBQ, I lived down South a year and have experienced REAL BBQ not this watered-down stuff. Hence why I am writing this review for her. We came here for my GF's birthday on a Friday night without a reservation, big mistake! It was a 2 1/2 hour wait. Better be worth it, we thought. Well it isn't. Anyone who gives this place anything over 3 stars YOU DON'T KNOW SHIT ABOUT BBQ. If you live in NYC you do not know what good BBQ is, so stop acting like you do. This place mediocre at best. The food came out and it wasn't hot. The ribs, let's just say the meat didn't slide right off the bone. Brisket did not fall apart when my fork touched it. This is unacceptable. The wings certainly did not live up to the hype that people give them on this site. The pulled pork wasn't good either. The only saving grace this dump had, were the drinks. My GF got drunk off of one stupid Punch drink. So, that made up for some of the lack of quality in food, since she couldn't tell the difference and she had a good time. Also the live band that played, was pretty good. You want a great place for BBQ, search The Shed (it's in Ocean Springs, Mississippi). Now, THAT is BBQ. Maybe not the best in the country, but one of and WAY better than this hole.

Vegetarians, fear not, you can enjoy BBQ too! I don't eat cow, pig, or chicken so it took a lot of convincing to grab lunch at a place known for just that. My friends were drooling over their ribs and chicken while I picked off the sides menu: whipped sweet potatoes, mac & cheese, potatoes, and BBQ fried rice. All fabulous decisions. At no point did I feel like I was eating a second-class meal. You could tell DBBQ puts just as much love into their mac and cheese as their pulled pork. The sweet potatoes were heavenly. Super light and fluffy with the perfect crunch on top. I would eat them everyday. The service was great. Considering lunch time is a total mad house at their 125th St location, they were really on top of their game. And all you southern transplants NEED to try the banana pudding. It's obscenely rich and tastes like bananas, not banana flavoring. You'll leave about 10 lbs heavier, but it'll bring you right back to the low country.

Spent a day hanging out with the dinosaur bones at AMNH, and then wrapped up with dinner at Dinosaur BBQ :) ?Full circle! ?Joining the ranks of Dinosaur fans. 1. Food: Large portion sizes and great value, and flavorful without any need for the additional sauces. ?Yummy moist chicken with crinkly and flavored skin. ?Ribs moist and juicy. ?Brisket pretty good too [Hill Country Moist Brisket, you're still my #1]. ?Got the fried green tomatoes, but people, they were just gops of sourness wrapped up in fried batter. 2. Service: friendly and constant. ?Big smiles. 3. Atmosphere: lots of random combinations. ?Airy and woodsy. ?A little on the loud side, but manageable.

So I was out with a friend checking out the American Museum of Natural History, frolicking in awe around all the dinosaur fossils... and we both start to get hungry for lunch and best idea EVER is formed: "Let's go to Dinosaur BBQ!" ? (btw permission granted to steal this idea for a cute and economical day date!) Just a few more subway stops from the UWS to Harlem, we finally arrived at this legendary bbq joint. We had never been before but of course had heard the rumors. We hovered around on the open bar seating area and snagged a couple seats within 15 minutes. Tons of locals and Mets fans were there, all provided advice on what to order. ?Tried the chicken wings, rack of ribs, and sides of salt potatoes and mac & cheese. Finger lickin' good! Second visit: friend green tomatoes, whipped sweet potatoes, and texas brisket are now added to my repeat faves! ?pass on pork shoulder though

Probably the best BBQ joint in NYC. I haven't found a weak point on the menu yet, and believe me, I've tried! For starters, you must get the fried green tomatoes and the chicken wings. Best wings I've ever had, bar none. Not your typical deep fried buffalo wings but real BBQ wings with great smoke flavor. For the main course, go with one of the combo plates if it's your first time there but be prepared for a *lot* of food. No joke. You may want to share with a friend for our own safety. The ribs are a fantastic mix of dry and wet styles: not too dry and not slathered with too much sauce. They get it just right. The beef brisket is delicious too and so is the BBQ pork. Everything comes with 2 sides, all of which are excellent but I especially recommend the BBQ beans. And finally, the beer selection, both on tap and bottled, is fantastic with a nice mix of microbrews and more popular choices as well.

I was dining at Dino BBQ well before it opened in Harlem in 2004. It originated upstate in Syracuse, NY (where I went to college), when a trio of bikers started it as a take-out barbeque joint almost 20 years ago. It soon evolved into a restaurant and blues club, and a second one opened in Rochester, NY. Now, the third location of this barbeque gem sits just off the West Side Highway on 131st Street. Entering the restaurant, you get the feeling you're not in the big city anymore - there are usually several motorcycles parked out front, and it's a bit of a walk from the closest subway station. Still, the place draws a crowd with its special hot sauces (try the Wango Tango), ribs and fried green tomatoes. The macaroni and cheese is sprinkled with a seasoning I can't identify but tastes delightful. With most meals you can choose two sides, and I've been known to order double mac (I suggest pants with an elastic waistband if that's your plan). ?Dino has more than 20 beers on tap, and lists their alcohol content. But if you drink too much don''t worry, the staff calculates a 15%, 18% and 20% tip for you on the bottom of your check for the math-impaired. What I absolutely love about this place is that even though it gets rave reviews, it's just far enough uptown that it hasn't gotten to be a total free-for-all. Sure, you may have to wait for a table, but there's a nice big bar and live music on Fridays and Saturdays. It's not the best place to go if you're on a health kick, but it's worth every ounce of fat.

I guess it's popular, cuz I finished two beers at the bar waiting for a table. I think the bar should be renamed the "Waiting Area." Because as names were called over the PA, people would down their drinks and head to their table. Probably not a good place to take a skinny chick, because you'll definately put on some weight here. One of two places I know that serve pulled pork. Was a bit tricky finding it.

I've been eating crap BBQ all my life and didn't even know it. Last night was my first time at dinosaur BBQ and i was in BBQ heaven! the amazing aroma of BBQ and meat filled the entire restaurant, old movie flyer's on the wall. i heard the original location across the street was bigger and better *sad face* but this place was just as good *happy face* i had the buffalo chicken, ribs, and of course the mac n cheese. they were all AMAZING!!!! the ribs are cooked for 9 hours! and they were oh so soft that they were falling of the bone. the chicken was soooo good and i ate the celery sticks so i wont feel too guilty and would tell my self that i did have my veggies today. my boyfriend kept insisting that i get the mac n cheese and i dont regret listening to him. At the end of the night i realized that what I've been eating in my lifetime were crap food compared to this!

Service was friendly when I sat at the bar while I waited for my "to go" order. The BBQ though was... eh. Kinda sucks that I got the wrong "to go" order too. I didn't notice until I got home. Bummer. When I called though, management took the item off my bill. The atmosphere was very... um... House of Blues -polished road house feel. It was a little too shiny to be authentically smokey. But that's not necessarily a bad thing. It's clean,... it's consistent. I just wasn't that impressed with the BBQ. The Cuban sandwich was decent. My favorite thing was the salt potatoes. Those were really buttery and good. The coleslaw was only so-so. The fried green tomatoes sprinkled with cheese and served with ranch dressing was perfectly fried and pretty tasty too.

Ok, so there are 379 reviews for this place. ?Does the world really need another Dinosaur Bar-B-Que review? ?Probably not. ?I'm guessing I'm the only reviewer from Portland, OR who is originally from New Jersey so I have that going for me. First off, I wanted to give this place 5 stars. ?The food was close to 5 stars (most of it was, but i'll get to that later), but they lost a star because we had a 7:30 reservation and we didn't end up getting seated until after 8:30. ?That drove me a bit batty. ?The place was packed, but if you allow for reservations, you should at least get your customers seated within a half hour of their reservation. ?I am now done typing the word reservation. We started out with 13 chicken wings ($11.95). ?Always a good start on judging any BBQ joint worth their grease. ?Whatever that means. ?The wings were meaty and juicy and the sauces we chose (Hot-Wango Tango and Hotter-Garlic Chipolte) were decently spicy. ?I think the waiter got it wrong when he told us which wings had which sauce on them. ?When I tasted what I thought were the Hotter wings, I wasn't impressed with the spice. ?I found out later that what were actually the Hotter wings were pretty spicy. ?Still could have been more, but they were fine. For my main dish I went with the Traditional Sampler which consisted of 1/4 Chicken (Leg & Thigh), 1/4 Rack of Ribs and sliced Texas Beef Brisket ($17.95). ?This was served with 2 homemade sides and a piece of their Honey Hush Cornbread. ?My sides were the BBQ beans and the simmered greens (Love those greens). ?I washed all this down with a Black Hole XXX Stout that had a wonderful dark mocha head on it. ?That was a dark beer my friends. ?The name doesn't lie. The chicken again was really juicy, the brisket had just enough BBQ sauce and was nice and pink and the sides were both very tasty as well with or without the hot sauce that I poured on top of each. ?The ribs on the other hand were a bit tough. ?They were good, but I think they might have been a bit overcooked. So aside from the wait (I'm told this place is always packed) overall it was a good experience. ?I've been wanting to try this place for a few years now and glad that I finally got the chance to. ?Food is good and the prices are reasonable. ?Do yourself a favor. ?If you have a reservation (Oops, I did it again), go hang out at the bar until your name is called. ?They have a pretty good beer selection. ?Go take advantage of it. ?I didn't and I regret it now. ?Until next time.

Hands down the best barbecue in NYC! I've tried the Rochester location of Dino BBQ and was slightly concerned that the Harlem locale wouldn't measure up, but my fears were unfounded, the food was just as memorable as I remembered, and downright cheap too! My group (consisting of 3 little Asian girls) each got a brisket slider to start off and shared the Sweetheart Deal which is technically for 2 people, but I don't know what 2 people could manage to eat that much! The deal consists of a full rack of ribs along with 4 sides. Our sides were a double-order of the mac and cheese (one of the best I've ever had), creole potato salad, and cole slaw. All were quite tasty! The meat was spectacular: moist, and fall-off-the bones tender. The sauces they had were fantastic as well, and had us licking our fingers. Our sliders were also delicious, with little glistening piles of brisket in a mound atop the buns =) Yes, the location is a little sketchy, but the walk from the 125th street stop is actually not bad, just make sure you're not alone and you'll be fine =P

Have you ever seen that 1991 movie with Kathy Bates : Fried Green Tomatoes? .........Neither have I, but ever since I heard the title I've been mildly obsessed with sinking my teeth into this southern treat. The thing is being a bonafide city girl this pleasure has eluded me for years. That was until I found out about Dinosaur BBQ. I've seen the place a billion times passing it on the highway and it seems everyone on Yelp has written a review of it - But I just don't like BBQ'd food. I have officially been reformed. The BBQ chicken wings are marinated over night then grilled the next day so they are beyond packed with flavor! And after 9 years of waiting I finally got my fried green tomatoes. I had no idea they are covered in batter which keeps the juicy middle preserved. They have some really great flavored sauces and the ranch is by far the best! Relatively affordable even with 5 Dinosaur Demises( watch out they sneak up on you) our bill was decent for such huge platters and well mixed drinks. Don't be intimidated by the Welcome to Harlem posters of Jim Jones, Diddy for Ciroc, or Hennessy this place has a great mixed crowd and an all around fun vibe worth making a detour off the Henry Hudson.

If you're looking to rsvp for a friday or saturday night, make sure you call A WEEK IN ADVANCE! otherwise, you can wait 1 hr 45 min for a table of two. ?My gf and I, however, would have none of that, so we ordered take out and took it to the nearby McDonald's (it's the one on 600 W 125th St- i'd actually read the handful of reviews there before doing what we did). ?

For my 23rd Bday, I was cravin some good BBQ and this place was highly rated by fellow yelpers so i decided to give it a try. I heeded other reviews and made a reservation for 15 a week in advance. If you love folksy banjo tunes, you'll love their hold music. I ended up playing phone tag with the staff and was transferred to three separate people. With the reservation set and confirmed the morning of, I made my way up to Harlem via the extremely reliable weekend MTA service (heavy sarcasm if you're not familiar with how much weekend service sucks). Got off at 125 st. and followed the hopstop directions walking through the fringes of the projects and down an extremely desolate street. Finally got to the place and they said we couldn't be seated unless the entire party was there but after a conversation with the manager I was able to get us seated. The menu is pretty sizable and there's a little of everything for even the pickiest eater. I couldn't decided amongst all the different types of meat so I got the sampler platter with ribs, chicken, and beef brisket. Ribs were dripping with flavor, the chicken was moist but lacked flavor and the brisket totally lacked flavor. Our table had a few bottles of their signature BBQ sauces and the best was their spicy blend. The portions are big but not huge unless you get the extreme platters. Overall I wouldn't go out of my way to come back here.

It's interesting to see the amount of positive reviews ONLINE instead of IN the actual restaurant where I was surrounded by a clusterfuck of disappointed customers (including myself). It took us a hour and a half to get a table this evening. We were then seated under a blasting a/c vent (it wasn't that hot outside, people) and then, when it came time to order, I NEVER received my order, but my friend did, and she finished her meal before I even saw a plate of food...which I never recieved in case you forgot. :) Of coursed I cried to the manager--but I still left with an empty stomach. I guess there's a first for everything?

Dinosaur BBQ absolutely deserves its place among the BBQ royalty of NY. Believe what people say, the wango tango wings are delicious.... and no, it doesn't have any mangoes in there. The ribs are great, with an excellent smoke crust around it. What makes it particularly impressive is that these are St. Louis cuts of spareribs. That means its all good eats, and none of the dry ribends. And what is in that BBQ sauce, cause I could put that on everything! I would also recommend the fried green tomatoes. Nothing like some cheese and deep fried goodness to start a meat binge. That's all the vegetables you need for the night. While I have much praise to offer for the entrees, I have to say I wasn't particularly impressed by any of the sides. I've tried the fires, syracuse salt potatoes, mac and cheese, fried rice, and none made me say WOW. But those things are fillers anyway, it just gets in the way of the meat!

I'm sad to write...the food did not live up to the hype. I've called to make a reservation was informed that they were completely booked for the evening but my friend was able to reserve a table via open table for the same time they informed me were not available! The staff was very friendly and attentive. We ordered the BBQ chicken & rib combo and the swag sampler plate that included spicy shrimp boil, BBQ chicken wings. fried green tomatoes and deviled eggs. Unfortunately, the only plate worth highlighting was the fried green tomatoes. The BBQ chicken and rib were really nothing special. Considering we hiked all the way up here from Brooklyn, we really expected much more. One other last thing, while the live blue's band is a nice touch, the music was too loud for any meaningful conversation in the table. Overall, it just an average experience.

Actual conversation that occurred at work yesterday: Friend #1: "We should go get dinner tonight." Friend #2: "Yeah! Where?" Me (thinking about it being my only night off work all week): "Mmmm, I dunno." Friend #1: "There's this place called Dinosaur Barbecue." Me: "DINOSAURS?!?" Friend #1: "I'll make a reservation." Friend #2: "Uhhh..." Me: "DINOSAURS!!!!" A few hours later, we're on the train heading to Harlem- pretty impressive considering a) it was a Monday night, b) we work in Brooklyn Heights and c) my friends live in Midwood and Far Rockaway, respectively. I wasn't expecting it to be too busy, considering it was Monday, and when we walked in (half an hour early for our 7:30 reso) I laughed a bit about my friend thinking a reservation was necessary. Turned out it was a good idea- while we were seated right away, the place was packed by 8pm- and that's saying something, because it's a huge space. The menu was truly impressive. I did not know you could cook meat in so many different ways. It did make me sad that the dinosaur theme stops at the restaurant name- no dino decor inside, no dino dishes (i wanted raptor ribs! pterodactyl wings! fried green...prehistoric plants...gah) but that was a small price to pay for how good it was. We started with creole spiced deviled eggs and garlic chipotle wings. I love deviled eggs and was super excited to see them on the menu- gobbled almost the whole plate. The wings were messy and HOT... just the way I like them. The pulled pork sandwich: succulent. It could have used some more sauce, but the pork was so juicy and tender I actually didn't mind too much. The fries were average, the mac n cheese was great, and the whipped sweet potatoes with spicy nut topping were too sweet for me, but I was the only one who felt that way (I do wish they had regular mashed potatoes on the menu). My friends heroically attacked slabs of ribs that would have made lesser men (women?) tremble in fear. To-go boxes were necessary at the end of the meal. Our server was very sweet, but a little slow. We had to call her over a couple of times for refills on drinks, to drop the check and to pay the bill. But she was so nice we couldn't get annoyed about it. Best spontaneous decision I've made in a long time. Rawwwwr!

God I love BBQ. Went here on a Friday night and it was very busy but got a seat at the bar. The chicken wings were better than Hooters and I thought the fried green tomatoes were just ok. The bbq chicken was extremely good as was the cornbread, fries and coleslaw. (So I normally love ribs but I kinda had a red meat run with bacon, steak (Luger's) and Shack Shack so thought I would give my arteries a rest.

Meh. I've been to the original Dino BBQ in Syracuse. ?It's authentic: ?dirty floor, bikers at the bar, Harleys parked out front. ?The Harlem location is very yuppy-ish...a little too clean for a BBQ joint. The food is nothing spectacular. ?I got the Big Ass Pork Plate--pulled pork with gobs of sauce on it. ?It's whatever. ?My side choices were mac and cheese and sweet potatoes. ?The sweet potatoes were loaded with sugar. ?They tasted like dessert. ?The mac and cheese was made with, what tasted like, American cheese. ?Gross. ?I'm not one to turn down mac and cheese but I left most of Dino's mac and cheese on my plate. ?The cornbread is good, so there's that. Sigh. ?I don't think I'll be returning to Dinosaur anytime soon. ?There's just too much good food in Manhattan to waste another meal here.

I've been here twice, but I remember the most recent best because I partook of the brisket. The first go around I was underwhelmed (would have gone with 3 stars) because I had a sandwich of some sort, and salted new potatoes (which sounded great on paper, but were OVERRATED, by the menu and the server). The best part was the fried green tomato appetizer. The second visit, again, I had brisket and...something I don't remember. The mac and cheese and beans were definitely a better choice than the potatoes. Brisket, as stated, was awesome. I really enjoyed the selection of sauces on the table (both BBQ and Hot sauce varieties). All in all, I probably won't come back, but only because it is such a hike and I will most likely not be in that neighborhood again.

Without changing my rating (since I refrained from buying anything this time around), just thought you should know that the TO-GO side orders--in the cup at least are pretty effing small, and the banana cream pie I was dying for is in the smallest fucking bowl in the universe, but props to the guy for being nice enough to first show me sizes at my request. ? ....What?

Really do enjoy this spot. I don't know if it was because my softball team and I just won (and I pitched which was pretty vital to that :p)...or if bc it was so hot out and the bartender kept the drinks flowing...or if it was that the fried green tomatos and brisket and deviled eggs really just were that good...but i really had a great time at this yummy bbq joint! Our server kinda had NO idea what he was doing...so I suppose in reality this should be a 3.5 star review...but I'm hoping he's got his stuff together and it was just an off day. Guess I'll have to get back there asap to find out!

Sometimes I can't take other reviews seriously. I think i read someone thought southern hospitality was better than Dinosaur BBQ? Seriously? This place is great. ?I love that you have to go out of your way for it and you REALLY have to want it to get it. Then when you get there you need to wait. Even if you have reservations you need to wait. Because thats what BBQ is all about. Waiting... Waiting for it to be fantastic and relaxing. ? You leave your comfort zone of the LES and you relax. Enjoy some sangria. Maybe a few wings. ?Mosey on over to your table. Have another sangria. ?Get some ribs ...or my favorite the Brisket. ? The cornbread will just melt in your mouth. ... when its all over... you can go back to rushing around and not enjoying life. ?But while you are there...have some of the best BBQ the city has to offer. I won't say the best... but it is very very very good. And way better than southern hospitality ... i mean REALLY? come on.

Came back here again, and I was not impressed at all. ?We got the ribs, and maybe it's only because I lived in the South for the last 9 years, but the ribs sucked. ?Way too hard, I should not have to use a knife to tear apart ribs. ? Also got some chicken wings, felt like I was just eating salty sauce. For 6 chicken wings, 3/8 of a rack of ribs, and a 1/2 pitcher of beer, I spent over $30. ?I'll pass next time, thanks.

An update on my review must include the following: Simmered greens: F@#$%'ING DELICIOUS!! If you like southern food, damnnnn....get these...the taste of these greens still lingers on my mind. ?If these greens were a man....dammmnn....I'd never get out of bed.

Fred Flintstone would be pleased with Dinosaur's offerings. ?I was. I had ribs, pulled pork, greens, cole slaw, mac and cheese and a potato salad. ?It was all very satisfying. ?The mac and cheese was standout. ?So very creamy and delicious. ? The only little thing is that the food came out warm and not hot. ? Went on a rainy Thursday night without a reservation at around 8 pm and the place was packed. ?We waited for almost an hour for our table, but it was fine...ya know, you drink a few beers in the spacious bar area and you're set. ?(I liked their beer selection, too.) Others have probably mentioned this here, but you can walk in and eat at the bar area where there are benches. ?A bit crowded, but do-able. Definitely going back.

Wow, Dinosaur Barbecue..so many thoughts. I checked this place out a few months ago and I didn't know if it was the fact that I was drunk or that I love BBQ, but I fell in love immediately. Fast forward today when I made the trek from Brooklyn up to 131st. Only a place like this could make me travel such great distances. And again, I was happy beyond belief. The food here is terrific - the meat is smoked perfectly and every side item I have tried is yummy. The beer is priced appropriately and there's a nice selection. The decor is fun and I've found the waitresses to be excellent; they have good management here. The only downside I can think of is the house BBQ sauce - I find it to be mediocre. Being from the Midwest, we are all about the sauce. But even that doesn't really change how I feel about this place. I will be back to this establishment the second I feel the urge to eat some good ole 'cue.

A couple of things that make me really happy are exciting reads, shoes, and southern barbecue. In a city filled with restaurants, southern barbecue is easy to find, but quality southern barbecue is hard to find amongst all of the mediocre restaurants. In my search to find authentic and delicious southern barbecue, I went on a long journey to Harlem after hearing some great reviews on a certain restaurant called Dino BBQ. Famous for their slow cooked barbeque ribs, I was extremely excited to see what Dino BBQ had to offer. Decorated with wooden booths and mahogany logs, the restaurant is filled with pictures of cowboys and southern backgrounds displayed across its walls. With a definite southwestern vibe and waitresses with friendly southern drawls, I was sure that I would be eating a delicious barbeque meal. After seeing a menu packed with mouthwatering barbeque dishes, I ordered the original pulled pork sandwich with fries and coleslaw and my friend ordered the pork and brisket plate with cornbread, beans, and potatoes in the hopes of having a stomach filled with good southern barbecue. As expected, the pulled pork sandwich was so tender that the cliché phrase "melts in your mouth" seems the only appropriate way to describe it. With their perfect zesty barbeque sauce and soft meat, Dino BBQ's pulled pork sandwich was simply a delight to find in Harlem. The pork and brisket plate was also a great dish, rubbed with the same zesty barbeque sauce as the pulled pork sandwich, accompanied by traditional southern sides that balanced out the entire meal. With the sweet homemade cornbread and tangy coleslaw accompanying our southern entrees, Dino BBQ was the perfect place to sooth my cravings. Although travelling to Harlem is quite a journey for a Queens resident like myself, my experience at Dino BBQ completely proved that the two hour train ride was more than worth it. Dino BBQ provides the best barbeque and meat embodying authentic southern barbecue, and their popularity is clearly evident by the never ending line of diners that walk in to the restaurant. With four locations in New York and one in New Jersey, I highly recommend Dino's BBQ to anyone who's interested in having a great meal to satisfy their need for exceptional southern barbecue.

I love this place. ?The BBQ might not be the best I've ever had, but it's pretty damn good. ?The atmosphere of the place is really great too, it's loud, raucous and makes you just wanna grab a beer. ?This is the perfect place for a total guy's night dinner. ?Kick back, with a couple ribs in one hand and a beer in the other. ?Now that's manly. Only downside is there's a good chance you'll get shot on your way to or from the restaurant if you' aren't careful.

No, dinosaur BBQ is not what happens when you get in your Escalade and drive a couple of hundred miles (unless you happen to live 100 miles away from the restaurant and drive an Escalade). Dinosaur BBQ is a BBQ restaurant with a location in Harlem that serves up some of the best ribs you can get in the city. I imagine that this location was selected primarily because of its affordable rent. When you get off the subway and walk towards the place, you will notices there is not really much else in sight, not even apartments or houses, just a gas station, some old factories/warehouses and some train stations. But suddenly when you think you have taken a wrong turn, you come upon a neon beacon drawing you in to this Pork Palace. If you arrive as we did during dinner time, you can expect a wait, ?as suburbanites and city-dwellers descend on this place on any given day. The good news is, while waiting for a table, you can sample a few of the many draft beers on tap-- If i recall correctly, there were about 25. While I was impressed by this selection, my friend, an avid lover of High Life, was even more impressed when a waitress was able to later produce a clear, curvy bottle of straw-colored brew. When it was finally time to be seated, we were ready for some magnificent BBQ. Having sampled Dinosaur in Rochester, we knew we were in for a treat. The main attraction is the ribs, tender, well-seasoned, dry-rubbed, with an assortment of table sauces for those "wet" BBQ lovers. The pulled pork is smoky, velvety and the perfect moisture, and the brisket is tender and hearty, if a little uninspired. We ordered the appetizer sampler to start with, and we were disappointed by the small number of items: 4 wings, 2 halves of a deviled egg, 3 fried green ?tomatoes, and 3-4 shrimp. It seems that the decisive are rewarded, as the plates of shrimp and wings that were ordered by our neighbors seemed to be much more fulfilling. The waitress informed us that each of the Dinosaur restaurants, of which there are three, have slightly different recipes and different menus. As good as this place is, the Rochester ribs are even better, and you are given the choice of St. Louis or Memphis style. Still, this is great BBQ and great atmosphere, and only a short train ride away.

Made reservations on http://opentable.com. Showed up 5 minutes early and was told we would be seated in a couple of minutes. A quick scan of the dining room showed multiple tables were empty. 10 minutes later we finally were seated. OK, so I'm looking forward to a gret bbq dinner. We ordered the spicy shrimp boil appetizer (hot option) and the smokey shrimp remoulade appertizer with fried green tomatoes. The spicy boiled shrimp were great. You could eat a pound of those with a few beers and be in heaven. ?The remoulade was ok. The tomatoes were fried we'll, but the remoulade taste left a lot to be desired (I might be jaded having grown up in New Orleans?). And I didn't get any of the "smokey" in the dish. We split the Tres Amigos entree which came with ribs, brisket and pulled pork. ?We chose coleslaw and BBQ rice as sides. Unfortunately they put fries on the plate instead of the rice. We finally flagged down the waitress and after some time she finally came through with the rice. Cole slaw was good but the rice was just ok. The ribs had a very nice char and were quite tasty. Pulled pork was also good but a bit on the dry side. The brisket was a mess. Bland and thickly cut slices yielded no real flavor. ? Asked for a refill on tea no less than 4 times. Finally they delivered after we were done with dinner. ?Asked about milkshakes after dinner, and was told "oh no we dont have milkshakes here." ?Isnt it standard issue to have shakes at a BBQ place? I don't know if it was the packed house but it seems like the quality has slipped from the original location. The service has definitely gotten worse. Undecided on a return visit. With so many other quality BQ places should I go back?

Reading the reviews here, you'd think the NYC location of Dinosaur Bar-B-Que was across the street from a maximum security prison. In fact, it's located across the street from Fairway, which is only dangerous to your wallet. ?Yes, it's under a train trestle and in spitting distance of the westside highway, but it's a pretty safe neighborhood overall. This place is gorgeous in that you will inevitably gorge yourself. ?Do not wear a belt, you will not need it by the end of the meal. I was thinking about Dinosaur as I prepared to write this and I realized I have a storied history with this restaurant and before last September, I had never even heard of it. ?Buckle up. Couple of things right off the bat: the first time I tried Dinosaur's food was at a wedding the Syracuse location catered for friends up in the Adirondacks. ?The food was fabulous. ?They drove up to the camp where the wedding was with a smoker on a hitch behind their truck. ?A slim crew fed all of us quickly and happily. ?The macaroni salad and the brisket were the stand-outs for me that day. Cut to a couple of weeks later; my boyfriend's family has the cookbook, so I was able to duplicate the macaroni salad and now I make it all the time. In November, we ate at the bar at Dinosaur after a quick shopping trip at Fairway (they'll only let you park in their lot if you actually go into Fairway to buy something; I got dark chocolate and pistachios). ?We had been coming back from yet another wedding upstate and it was a spur-of-the-moment decision, and a good one. ?The brisket, served with a slice of fresh jalapeno on top was, again, a stand-out. ?But no macaroni salad at the NYC location! ?An outrage! ?As a stand-in, they serve an EXCELLENT potato salad that I cannot recommend highly enough. ?I could live on that potato salad. My first real sit-down visit to Dinosaur in NYC was on January 5th, 2009, a Sunday. ?At the end of the excellent meal, I got a phone call telling me my boyfriend had been hit by a truck and was in the hospital. ?Obviously, the details of the meal were quickly forgotten, but I remember it was stellar and the service was top notch. ?OK, calm down, he's fine now. ? Anyway, my next trip there was in February. ?I was very, very sick and had just come off a plane from Germany where I had been for a week on business. ?Didn't know it then, but I was carrying around pneumonia. ?Despite that, I was starving and there was only one cuisine I desired. My boyfriend picked me up at Kennedy and drove us into Manhattan for an early lunch. ?Dinosaur had just opened (it was maybe 11:30 at the time) and it was the coldest day of the winter, maybe 11 degrees outside. ?We sat in the warm belly of the restaurant for about two hours while I worked my way through each course. ? I'm having difficulty recalling the excellent salad dressing that was on my starter salad, but when you go, ask the server which one is both creamy and spicy and then tell them that's the dressing you want. ?It's layers and layers of smokey-sweet flavor. ?The wings are also terrific, as is the macaroni and cheese, and the salt potatoes. ?I, again, had the potato salad. Dinosaur bottles its own sauces and in the NY metro area, they're available in the supermarket--all of them, except for my absolute, drop-dead favorite, Garlic Chipotle. ?This sauce is so addictive, I put it on EVERYTHING (try it on latkes--I put it on the Trader Joe's frozen variety and it's a great snack). ?But you can only buy it at the restaurant, so if you like it, stock up before you leave or you'll be kicking yourself like I did for months between visits. The bathroom is a hot graffiti mess that invites you to share your art, the servers are local, awesome and super-friendly. ?They give great recommendations, too. ?Bar-wise, they've got some good beers and it's a nice place to sit and eat a meal if you don't feel like braving the wait for a table. ?Outside seating is first-come, first-serve, which leads to a lot of people standing around gawking while you eat, so I prefer to wait inside. ?The wait is never as long as they say it will be. ?Some Saturday nights there is live music, and that's fun, if loud. Go and have a great time! ?And try some Garlic Chipotle hot sauce for me!

I wanted to give it four stars. ?Really. ?But two out of the three times that I've been here, the service SUCKED. ?(And the third time, I knew my server, so I actually had good service.) Anyway, the first horrible server I encountered at Dinosaur is gone now, so I'll talk about my most recent experience. My server for lunch yesterday, Ciara, was HORRIBLE. ? She was extremely inattentive. ?Spent most of the time flirting with some guy at the bar. ?Now, if you're going to talk to someone, at least face your customers, so you can see if they're trying to grab your attention. ?But no, she had her back to most of her tables. ?And they were chatting it up for at least an hour. ?Maybe more. ? She also was a little rude serving us. ?She must be independently wealthy, because she wasn't working for her tip. ?At all. ?Ciara almost made me give Dinosaur two stars. As for the food. ?I had the BBQ chicken, which was a good call. ?It was tasty. ?I know that it's blasphemy, but I liked it better than their ribs, which I got on my other two visits, but wasn't really impressed with. ?The corn bread--awesome. ?The fried green tomatoes--heaven. ?The mac and cheese side was so-so. ?The sweet potato side was pretty good. Bottom line: Food--4 stars; 2/3 of the waitstaff I've encountered--2 stars.

I have been here many times but this is my first review. We started with the Swag Platter. ?Boil and peel shrimp, deviled eggs, fried green tomatoes, and wings. ?We asked them to substitute the shrimp due to an allergy. ?We were denied. ?Best they would do is put the shrimp on a separate plate. ?We got the wings with the chipotle sauce because I have enjoyed them so much in the past. ?They only put two wings on the plate. ?I seem to recall there used to be more than just two!?!?! ?Tomatoes and eggs were great. ?Shrimp are uneventful. Wife ordered single link of sausage with sides of mac and cheese and iceberg wedge. ?She enjoyed it very much. I got the Ode to Elgin. ?Sausage, 4 ribs and some brisket. ?All were spot on today! ?My sides were the roast poblano soup and the iceberg wedge. ?The soup was delicious...wish it were a regular. For dessert we split the oreo ice box pie thing. ?It was very good! Service was very good!

I recall this place as being "Okay." You might notice a theme in some of my reviews, or a recurrence of the words "I passed out" or "I was very drunk." It was a lovely Spring day, a bunch of friends were meeting to celebrate a birthday. We began the day at Dinosaur...hostess was pretty rude to us. Ordered the house beer, which was pretty refreshing and got the garlic chipotle wings. Those were great. I believe I got the pulled pork and found it to be pretty unremarkable. Even with one of the sauces on it. And the sides were pretty blah. What's more fun is the day that followed. We bar hopped a bit before going to see Watchmen which after several hours of BBQ eating and beer drinking, most of us passed out during.

The good, the bad, and the goddamnittookalmost2hoursforourfoodtocomeoutthekit?chen! Praise before punishment: I was part of a group of 16 who were at Dinosaur BBQ for a birthday party, so it wasn't a normal circumstance. Our servers did a good job when we finally got our food. Drinks came out a little slow and all beers arrived before the sweet tea that I ordered. My family has a lot of North Carolina and Louisiana in it, so I know barbecue like a pig knows pork. To say I was skeptical when I found out Dinosaur is a chain outta Syracuse, NY, is an understatement. We got the sampler appetizer for two- fried green maters, skrimps, deviled eggs and chicken wings. We ordered the wings hot, and they were damn hot. The shrimp were alright and so were the deviled eggs but the fried green tomatoes suffer from freezer burn. All in all, the food was pretty decent. I ordered the Tres Hombres platter and that's a lot of food for even a giant like me to consume. 1/4 rack of ribs, a pile of pulled pork BBQ and some slices of their beef brisket with 2 sides. The ribs were tasty and so were the pork and brisket, but their sauce is a tad sweet for my sensibilities. They do offer some mojo on the table in the form of habanero and chipotle hot sauces to flame on if you need to. This place on this particular Saturday night was 1)crowded like Mumbai 2)louder than a bomb, and on any Saturday night it's a)crowded b)not too easy to get to unless you live nearby c)a crap shoot for getting a taxi home from. My main gripe with the joint and it was a gripe shared by everyone at my table, was the food took 2 HOURS TO ARRIVE AFTER WE ORDERED! Our server kept giving us updates on how it was coming along, and by the 4th or 5th news bulletin we were all about to tell him to just STFU. The take out line was out the door, the wait for a table was over an hour long, and I think these fools ran out of pig mid-way through supper! Jesus. H. Tapdancing. Christ. Have you ever been to Famous Dave's? If you have, Dinosaur Barbecue is very very similar in taste, menu and atmosphere. I would go back here, but not with a large group and not on a Friday or a Saturday evening. Oh, and not without a # for a car service to pick my ass up after my meal.

Damnit. I anticipated seething in anger while I sat for the estimated 2 hour wait with my friends. But we got a pitcher of sangria and passed the time trying to suck the fruit through our straws. I've never gotten around to going to Dino BBQ for the past 3 years -- a travesty in retrospect, but I always assumed it was never worth the wait. IT IS. ?We got a rack of ribs, wings, sliders, mac and cheese, the soup of the day -- all so delicious. Full meat carnage. The waiter was great and the food came out FAST. In addition, we enjoyed another pitcher of sangria and servings of Donkey Punch (apparently it's funny when you gush about how much you love Donkey Punch outside of Dino BBQ - http://www.urbandictiona… -- Hi Eddie!). Point is, I forgot 50% of the meal.

Imma a fan fo life.. You usually don't associate BBQ and NYC but Dinosaur BBQ has the goods to put BBQ on the map in NYC.. A short walk from the 125th subway train.. And u find BBQ heaven on 131st.. My favorite is the Pork Ribs...Perfectly smoked to perfection and perfectly seasoned with the perfect amount of sauce.. Did I mention that their pork ribs are perfect? Their sides are amazing too.. Of note are the fried green tomatoes and the fried rice.. Yup.. fried rice.. ?Who knew? ?haha.. You'll definitely find me grubbing here next time imma in Harlem..

This place is ok-after reading the reviews here we had high expectations and were pretty disappointed. The ribs are good for sure but the pulled pork and brisket are far better at RUB BBQ. The ribs are 3stars but because the pulled pork and brisket(both served cold by the way??) were so bland that you had to drown them in BBQ sauce to make them taste like anything I cant give this place more then 2. ? The sides were eh too..creole potato salad was tasty but I kept pulling this mystery stuff out of it..husband said it looked like cabbage I thought it looked like paper so I didnt eat it. ?The bbq beans were fine..sweet though! You wont be missing anything that comes in the swag sampler either except the shrimps so feel free to skip it and just order the shrimp

I'm a lover of bbq, ribs in particular are my fav. ?I've many good things about this place so I had to try it. I tried going at an odd hour to avoid any wait time, but that tactic didn't work. ?Even on a Saturday at 4:45pm in the afternoon there was still an hour wait for a part of 2. ?Fortunately there's a Fairway right across the street to help pass the time and an opp to stock up on a few groceries/snacks. We ordered the 'Sweetheart' deal for 2 which came with a whole rack of pork ribs with 2 pieces of corn bread and 4 sides. ?The ribs were DELICIOUS. ?Super tasty and literally fell off the bones when you picked it up. ?You barely needed a knife to separate the ribs from the rack. ?Add their house bbq sauce and it was even more tasty! All 4 sides we chose were pleasers. ?We went for the bbq beans with pork, curried sucotash, syrcuse style salt potatoes (whole baby white potatoes in a delicious flavored butter sauce) and the 'side of the day' which was cajun corn (this was probably my fav - too bad it's not a regular side!). Overall, super happy with my first experience here and I'd def go back, although I'm scared of what the wait time would be if I had done at a more prime time eating hour! ?One hour was more than enough wait for me, especially after you go in and smell all of the deliciousness! Would love to try some of their apps next time, like their chicken wings and fried green tomatoes! ?Although the half rack, sides and cornbread were filling enough :) ?Did somebody say doggie bag??

It was a great day to be a Syracuse graduate living in the city when they announced that Dinosaur was going to be opening a location in Harlem. ?We laughed, we cried, and we unloosened our belt buckles in advance - and then we made the long trek up to 131st st and indulged and a damn good barbeque eating experience. People say the food isn't as good as it is in Syracuse, but I've never had any such issues. ?Everything tastes spot on and delicious. ?They've still got an amazing brisket sandwich, and the finest wings known to man. ? The real problem is the location and the all around vibe. ?There's just no replacing the aura of upstate bikers that surrounds the Syracuse spot. ?No matter how crappy of a spot you find for your NY establishment. ?All dive's are not created equal, even if they share the same name. That said, this is one of the best BBQ spots in the city, and a worthy member of the Dinosaur family.

The location may have changed (it's now on 125th st and bumblef...) and it may not feel as biker grungy, but thankfully the food at Dinosaur is still worth the trek. It starts with those wings...my favorite in new york. Those wings are the first thing I eat, usually after torturously waiting sometimes as long as 1.5 hours (and yes, I highly recommend you make reservations on a weekend). The combination of spice, smoke, and char on the skin and wango tango hot sauce create a drumstick/wing of perfection that makes even my korean chicken wing-loving self jealous. ?Even though the price is a little steep for wings ($13 for 13 wings), each wing is massively meaty and easily worth it for the sauce-lickin, wing-hoarding experience. Once I've had those wings, it's really hard for anything else at Dino to match...not that the bbq, sides or other dishes are slouches. ?Ribs are tender, smokey, and well-sauced; the pulled pork is magically soft and delicious; and the fried green tomatoes have made me consider converting to being a vegetarian. However, the wings are just so ethereal that they overshadow all the other great food served. ? I think the only solution now is to start with the bbq as the "appetizer" and finish with the wings as my entree.

I cut my teeth on real barbeque at the Dinosaur in Syracuse. ?Since then, I've tried it in North and South Carolina, Tennessee, and anywhere else I can. ?I've got to say that Dinosaur is my favorite. They do have entrees like mac n cheese, burgers, and some others, but I've never tried any of them. ?I've never been able to get away from the cue. ?The ribs, wings, pulled pork, brisket, and just about everything else is just fantastic. ?We did have one trip here that was less than stellar (the brisket wasn't as tender as I would've liked), but I'm letting it slide -- the next 3 trips were fantastic as usual. I still have a few BBQ joints in the city to hit up, but I can't imagine they'll be better than the Dinosaur.

Ok, as I have said before, I have HIGH HIGH standards for BBQ. ?I'm from Missouri and we have THE best BBQ there, so I have been really disappointed with everything I've tried in NY so far. ? However, I officially approve of Dinosaur BBQ. ?It was delicious. ?I'm loving the mashed potato salad and the corn bread was warm and delicious. ?I also tried a BBQ chicken drumstick and breast and the pulled pork. ?Yeah, I went all out. ?They have about 6 different yummy bbq sauces to put on your meat also. ?I love me some Dinosaur and I'll be back real soon.

Like andy t. says, this is not earth shattering bbq. It's good, but it isn't amazing. You know what is pretty fantastic here though? Their wings. Their wings are big and juicy. They are NOT buffalo style. They either smoke or bbq their wings, I can't remember. They're definitely not fried though. Overall, Dinosaur is A-OK in my book.

Finally. ?A New York City culinary experience I can rave about. ?I came here for lunch today all by my lonesome, with the new Khaled ?Hosseini book in hand, after spotting it on the food network this morning and thinking, "Heck, I'm in the Bronx, it's not far". It didn't take long to be seated by a warm, wonderful woman who took the time to spot my book and rave with me about his first book. ?The food came out quickly. ?I had the ribs and brisket combo, with the potatoes, and the soup as a side. ?Soup fo the day with curries chicken, which was really like a chicken vegetable with curry and was quite good. ?Not overwhelming, nor creamy or thick so as to fill me up before I got to the main dish. ?A for the soup. ?The potatoes were slathered in what I can only describe as a very slightly spicy (ceyenne?) butter/vinegar sauce/remoulade thingy that at first bite was good, and at second bite as amazing. ?I began mashing my potatoes with my fork just so I could soak up more of the sauce. The first hint at what goosness was to come were the pink rings around the slices of my brisket. ?Ahh. ?Pink rings. ?Sometimes barbeque can be so fickle--after some varied experiences in LA you can understand why I'm a skeptic. ?But then the ribs, oh, the ribs. ?They serve everything dry and have the sauce at the table (a true sign that they stand by their meat and don't need to mask it in sauce), and the dry rub was just perfect. ?The bones were meaty, not too fatty, hot, and delicious. ?It was all I could do to decide which yummy part fo the plate to shovel in my mouth first. All in all, if you're in town or live here, come here for some good BBQ. p.s. ?the cornbread was good, too.

My girlfriend is from Syracuse. She moved down here a many eons (fine, a few years) ago and never looked back. The transplanted Upstater to the hustle and bustle of Grand Ol' New Yawkkkk City. Dinosaur is the same thing. It is a transplant. I took her there as a surprise one night, I said "Hey, lets go to Syracuse." Now the 5 hour drive would have killed me (considering I didn't even have a car at the time) so I said let's just hop on the subway and go. I cannot tell you the excitement that showed on her face when I said where we were going on that random day. And what a good boyfriend I was...I had a reservation. You need one. Trust me. You definitely need one. Onto the food. This is by far the best BBQ in the city, lest someone step up to the challenge (Hill Country, not so bad....). The chicken is tender, the ribs are amazing...and that corn bread. Last time I popped wood just walking in thinking about it. Food can do that to you, or getting a handy from the stranger on the subway ride up. Ok, that didn't happen, but in a perfect world it would...especially when you are going to a dreamy food place like Dinosaur.

I'm opening myself up for shame and ridicule for giving Dinosaur's a 3-star, but having grown up in upstate NY and having frequented both the Syracuse and Rochester locations, Dinosaur NYC doesn't cut it for me. ?It's not a close-second to the "originals." ?While I've eaten here a few times, Ive yet to have the culinary or atmosphere/vibe experience I have every time I eat at the upstate locations. ?While I cannot be 100% positive, the menu here in NYC seems much more limited, and the food, while very good, is not my favorite BBQ in NYC. I like Dinosaurs (and especially love that smell as you bike by on a weekend morning when the kitchen is just firing up), and I will gladly eat here again and again. ?But, it's just not the wow factor for me, especially when I'm able to enjoy the "true" Dinosaurs upstate. ?Now those locations are spectacular!

I grew up in the South where our favorite food is Barbeque. ?All people eat is barbeque. ?So I never thought I would find the best barbeque of my life at a restaurant in the middle of New York City. ?But I was WRONG. ?This is the best barbeque I have ever, ever had. ?It is hard to pick out one reason why. ?The sauce is out of this world good. ?The BBQ sandwich is unbelievable. ?The fixings are not the best I have ever had, but they compliment the main course well enough that I can let that go. The atmosphere of the place is different from most of what I have seen in New York. ?It has more of a country feel. ?I would never guess that I was in the middle of Harlem if I was just placed there. ?It is part biker, but mostly country living. ?But it isn't over the top either. ? Overall the food is well worth the hike up to Harlem.

After reading the reviews here, I had to check this place out. ?Gotta say, I wasn't impressed. ?First the place was packed at 6 PM. ?Waited an hour for a table and happened to get seated behind a group of guys celebrating... air. ?One member of the group says "Hi" and the rest break out into an table pounding, rip roaring yell... WTF? ?This went on for about 20 minutes with break outs of the crazies every 30 seconds or so. ? These guys were to flappin happy. ?I wanted some of what they had. Okay so we start off with SWAG SAMPLER PLATE. Wings, fried green tomato, peel and eat shrimp and deviled eggs. ?The smokey flavor in of the wings was excellent! ?The fried green tomatoes had a very nice crispy crunch to them. ?The shrimp were shrimp - nothing great. ?Deviled eggs? ?First time I've ever had them outside of a family gathering. ?Tasty but missing the paprika. ? Next came the ODE TO ELGIN which consist of 1/4 rack of Ribs, Beef Brisket & Hot Sausage Link. ?What happened to the smokiness of the wings? ?None of it showed up in Elgin. ?The ribs were nice an thick but the flavor just wasn't there. ?The "Hot" links were not hot and rather tasteless. ?The Brisket was terrible. ?I also had the potato salad and mac and cheese for sides. ?Neither was great. ?I can make MUCH better. ?Maybe it's me but is there cheez wiz in the mac and cheese? ?Come on, Cheez Wiz? ? ? All in all, it wasn't bad. If I'm in the area, I may stop in again but I won't be making the trek from Brooklyn again just to get some BBQ. ?The next time I go, I'll order an huge serving of Wings and Fried Green Tomatoes.

Once again, Wings & Fried Green Tomatoes were the two winners. They really are a must try. BEST wings in NYC hands down. And the most delicious fried green tomatoes EVER. We had the sampler platter as our appetizer which came with the wings, tomatoes, deviled eggs, and the shrimp. The shrimp was not the best, it is served cold-cocktail-style. Nothing super special really. I am not a fan of eggs ever so I can't speak for them, but the wings and the tomatoes? OOooooo... My mouth is watering. SO GOOD! I went for a more unique choice of entree, had the Korean-style ribs, and boy were they good too, humongous. Like I get why they call it Dinosaur Bbq! And once again, the fried rice are fantastically delicious and the pork/beans were kind of spicy, kind of sweet at the same time. LOVE IT. REALLY REALLY wish this place was closer, further downtown. I swear I would be here every single damn day for Happy Hour if it was eating wings, tomatoes, and drinking beer. What can possibly be better than that?

In the mood for some good simple Bar-B-Que? Ribs are almost as good as homemade without all the work. Hidden away under the Henry Hudson Pkwy across from Fairway Dinosaur is a mini break from your slick city living. The great atmosphere almost makes the average hour wait worth it. The beer selection doesn't hurt either. They have a great menu that allows you to sample almost everything. Don't skip the salt potatoes are wonderful. I would pass on the greens they have a tad too much vinegar for my tastes. Don't forget to reserve a table a few days in advance if not weeks even thought this place is huge it fills up fast.

This place really deserves 4.5 stars in my book, with .5 being taken off for it always having too long of a wait. In fact, I have never actually sat at a real table in this place... we always end up in the bar area that is first come, first seated. However, the food is fan-freakin-tastic. I agree with my fellow yelpers that the mac n' cheese is the best side. I also like the salted potatoes (but I like overly salted foods) and the fried green tomatoes. I like their chicken diablo sandwich which is just the right amount of spicy and messy. I also think the brisket is really good, although I am not a big red meat person so really just sampled off my hubbie's plate. The hot sauces, while there were many from which to choose, are not as spicy as I would like them to be. New York really needs to work on making all of its foods more spicy. Forget the Dallas BBQ and the other pretend BBQ places in the city-- this is the place to go.

Best BBQ i've ever had!!! (but I guess I haven't had many other places, except Lucille's in LA & Texas BBQ) ?The carnivore in me has tried all the types of BBQed meats here after visiting on several different occasions. ?Of them all, the wings & ribs are a definite must. ?Everything comes out a little too charred (makes me think of carcinogens), but it has the authentic, smoky BBQ taste that makes my mouth water as I'm thinking about it. ?The best sides are the fried rice & mac & cheese...oily & creamy deliciousness. ? The portions are pretty hefty, so it's a good idea to share. ?A reservation is a must, especially if you're coming at peak times like weekend nights. ?They also have a good bar seating area to watch sports & live karaoke that makes the place really rowdy & fun. ?The only great place I can think of that's close-by for starved Columbia students.

So I hate messy food. This is mostly because I am a shamefully messy eater. ?I was the kid at the table who would soil the tablecloth so that the only clean spot was the one that was hidden by my plate. ? Now obviously due to my inability to move food directly from my plate to my mouth, ribs are something I enjoy, but often avoid while eating out. BUT, now that I've been to Dinosaur, no longer will I deprive myself of such finger-licking, lip-smacking meaty goodness. In all honesty, I know ZERO about barbeque, but this was just downright good food, and they give you plenty of it! Also, my friend and I tried the fried green tomatoes, which I've never had before (I'm from San Francisco, what do I know about fried green tomatoes), and they were crispy and delicious and highly recommended. Be warned about the long wait, but on the plus side, there's a first-come, first-serve section by the bar if you are quick enough to fight off the crowd and snag a couple seats. Makes for great people watching!

It all started when I went 140 streets to get chicken wings. I have been all over the city for wings and I had done my research. ?I was ready for the main event. ?This is why I train to be a wing connoisseur. Food: I was expecting traditional buffalo chicken wings (hot sauce style). ? They are NOT traditional hot wings like I was expecting. ?BBQ Grilled Chicken Wings that were simply great even though I didn't go particularly for BBQ style. ?VERY worth it however and reasonably priced. ?VERY big and only took 13 to fill me up where as normal wing places I usually have 20. Specials: Happy hour with $2 beers :) Building: Very spacious with a nice bar area. ?We waited there until a table was ready but just decided to eat there as it was just as nice as restaurant with plenty of room. ?Little bit out of the way but an easy walk to the subway. ?When you enter the restaurant you are instantly hit with a GREAT smell of BBQ. ?I'm sitting here writing this and I'm just wanting to smell it again. Area: Yes I thought this was going to be in a rough part of time but I will say its really not bad at all. ?If you go much east or north you do hit some rough patches. ?But the path from 1 train to building is very secure and didn't feel threatened by anything. ?It was a major concern of my friend before going which is why I write this in case you are having similar thoughts. Service: Good attentive service. ?Food came quickly. Bottom Line: If you like wings you need to go here. ?You won't be disappointed. ?Yes its out of the way..Yes they are a little more expensive than other places. Yes its worth it.

Dino BBQ is worth the trek to 131st street at least once in your life. ?The weekends are always packed and if you are coming on a Friday or Saturday, they only take reservations two days in advance. ?If not, you can show up and wait- average wait time is about an hour. ? Once you are seated and ordered the food comes pretty fast. ?For appetizers, the chicken wings and fried green tomatoes stand out. ?There's this blue cheeses sauce topped with paprika and mixed with some other ingredient that is really delicious. ?The deviled eggs and shrimp cocktail are not worth the money. For the main dish, my friend and I ordered the sweetheart rib special which comes with a full rack of ribs, four sides and corn bread. ?The ribs were fantastic, finger licking falling off the bone good until we realized that the majority of the middle pieces were not fully cooked. ?We decided to eat from the two ends instead and wound up taking the rest home to attempt to salvage. ?As for the sides, the mac and cheeses was decent but not excellent, french fries were standard, ?the bbq rice was tasty and the greens were very bitter. ?Cornbread was ok.

Where does this mac & cheese come from? Where do they make it? How do they make it? Who created it? More importantly... WHERE CAN I GET SOME MORE??! I am straight up FEENING for more of that spicy, creamy, sexy delightfulness! Aside from the company, which was also fabulous, the highlight of the evening was definitely the food (duh). This was damn good barbeque. My ribs were crispy-skinned and moist and sweet and just so good. There were a bunch of little bones/cartilege bits in my ribs, though, which really sucked--I didn't want to be pulling things out of my mouth during this feast, just shoving them in! But the sides were fantastic (sweet potato mash, salt potatoes, MAC AND CHEESE DELIGHTS, fries, etc.) and the service was top-notch. Our waitress was speedy, got all our orders perfectly, and accommodated us no-problemo both times a random friend showed up.

My friends and I had to wait 1.5 hours for a table for six (no reservations). The food was worth the wait, for the most part. We ordered fried green tomatoes and deviled eggs to share as appetizers, and both were delicious. The tomatoes were crunchy on the outside, and I loved the sauce. The eggs were creamy, and the paprika added a nice flavor. For the entree I ordered the tres hombres, a combination platter consisting of ribs, pork, and brisket. The brisket was dry and unimpressive, but the ribs were tasty and the pork was probably one of the best I have had. For the combo I got 1/4 rack of ribs, which was enough for me. Even though I liked it, I couldn't imagine eating more. The two sides I ordered were the simmered greens and the whipped roast sweet potatoes. I loved the sweet potatoes, and the simmered greens were quite good as well. I also tried the mac and cheese side, the chicken, and sausages on friends' plates, and I thought that all were scrumptious except the sausage, which was kind of standard. Overall, I enjoyed the food at Dinosaur BBQ, and I would definitely go back for more of that pork and sweet potatoes.

My favourite place for ribs in Manhattan to date. Not overly salted or dry like Daisy May, and miles above the anemic ribs served at Dallas BBQ. ?I have to say that I eat more often at Brother Jimmy's just because of location, and on a good day, Brother J's comes pretty close to the delicious ribs at Dinosaur BBQ. And delicious they are: ?tender, fall off the bone ribs that do not need to hide under bowls of sauce (although they did give me more sauce on the side, just in case). ?The sides also displayed pride in execution, with a well seasoned and properly cooked mac n' cheese, as well as crisp, fresh cole slaw that could not be any more indistinguishable from those with a similar moniker. It is a bit of a hike to take the 1 train up and then hike down to 12th. ?But the food stayed hot and moist for the half hour trip back home, and was still utterly delicious when we got back. ?I think next time, though, we'll just stay in. ?Those bags of ribs do get pretty heavy, and the enticing aromas tend to draw quite a bit of unwanted attention in the enclosed confines of the train from hungry travellers alike.

I was at first extremely excited about going to Dinosaur BBQ, as so many people had talked it up for being so delicious. Being form VA and close to the NC border, I have my fair pickings of Pulled Pork and Ribs places to eat out at. I was pretty disappointed with the food itself at Dinosaur, as it really lacked flavor and they tried to make up for it by covering it with sauce (which only makes it soggy and messy, not juicy and succulent). The mac and cheese was a total miss, the salted syracuse potatoes were nothing special (I, too, can put small russet potatoes in butter sauce and sprinkle some "cajun" spices on it), and really only the selection of beer saved them from having 1 star. The service was very poor as well, as it took 15 minutes for a server to come after flagged them down (I know this place has a reputation for being busy, but it was 5:15pm on a Tuesday night, there was hardly ANYONE there) and upon introduction decided it would be a good time to tell us that she was tired and sit down while we were taking out order. She also didn't know anything about the beer selection and wasn't helpful at all in the Specials of the day or anything. She also refused to split our check unless it was 50-50, because she just COULDN'T see why the top two were mine and the bottom two were my friends'. Needless to say, I won't be coming back.

Perfect place to have drinks and eat great food with friends when you don't feel like dressing up or going to a pretentious restaurant! The green fried tomatoes, the mac and cheese, brisket, and the ribs are to die for! ?The prices are great, the drinks are potent (try the dinosaur demise), and they also have a very efficient take out system if you just want a quick bite. ?Be prepared for a long wait or just hang out by the bar area and grab a seat there. ? The beer list is quite impressive, $21 for a pitcher of arrogant bastard is not bad.

Definitely the best BBQ in New York. It might not be authentic Texan, or KC or southern, but it's really, really, really good. The Ribs are fantastic, the beer selection is unique and the BBQ chicken takes me back to my back yard growing up with my dad grilling chicken pieces on the charcoal grill. Also, unlike many BBQ places, all of the sides here are not throwaway fillers, but are really, really good. For a good sampling, I recommend the "Ode to Elgin," which has more Brisket, Ribs and Sausage (fantastic here!) than you'll probably be able to handle. My thought is that after one meal, you'll be coming back and their menu has enough diversity that you could probably eat a different, yet wonderful meal here every night of the week. Just be sure to make reservations, as despite the inconvient location (unless you're shopping at Fairway) and fact that this place is no longer new, Dinosaur still draws huge crowds.

Dinosaur, I love your food. But this last waiter really killed the vibe. He was late with everything, walked by us and ignored us several times, and my food came a solid 10 minutes after everyone else at our table. The service was so bad, that I have to remove a star. The food was once again delicious, keeps me coming back. Beer lovers should check this place out too.

Pretty far down the list of the best barbecue places in NYC. The garlic chipotle wings were very good and had a nice char to them. ?They were far and away the highlight of my dining experience here. ?Even better, you can order them in batches as small as three instead of having to get ten or a dozen; otherwise, I probably wouldn't have gotten to sample them. ?The Dino-burger with bacon was just okay. ?It wasn't a great burger by any means nor was it a bad one, just middling. ?It could have been much juicier and more flavorful. ?The sides which accompanied it were likewise lackluster. ?Our server told us the salt potatoes were amazing, but in reality, I would have been fine if I never encountered them. ?They were a bit underdone. ?The sauce they came in was okay, if a little watery. ?The baked beans with pork were also a disappointment. ?They tasted like a can of plain ol' Bush's. ?Like the sauce for the potatoes, they were also a bit watery. I can say, however, that I was slightly more pleased with the beer selection. ?I wouldn't mind washing down some better tasting barbecue with a pitcher of the Dinosaur Ape Hanger. ?A couple stouts I ordered were also very good. ?(I forget their names. ?One was Southern Tier something or other. ?The other was an oatmeal stout from an unknown brewery.) ?There were maybe a dozen other beers on the list I would like to have sampled. ? Overall, not the best, not the worst. ?Foodstuffs aside, even the location (way out on W 131st) and prices (cheapish for NYC) balance out to put it squarely in the middle of the pack but no higher.

I've been visiting Dinosaur BBQ since it opened in NYC. I think I visited once when I felt the ribs were a little dry but apart from that they've always been succulent and extremely tasty. This is a great place to take Europeans because you cannot get ribs like this across the pond. The space is a bit of a themed restaurant but not over the top. The service is fast, casual and friendly. My only grumble is with the hostess who routinely tells you the wait is well over 90 minutes only to be called 20 minutes later. I hope they can improve on this. Just make sure you get the ribs. The Fried green tomatoes are also very good.

There are moments I enjoy using fancy silverware in fancy restaurants. ?BUT my pure joy is rested on licking and sucking my sauce sticky thumb and fingers. And BBQ is the kind of food which allow me to be me. ?I have been to many BBQ places. This is one of my favorite. I 've ?long planned to take my visiting sister to this place. I am glad I finally took her there. And she absolutely agreed that this is the best BBQ she has ever had. We ordered Fried Green Tomatoes with Spicy Shrimp Remoulade. ?Full rack of rib platter coming with 4 sides. ?We got collard green, mac n cheese, carrot and raisin, and tasted darn good! fried rice. ?I was so full. ?It was the first time I ever had leftover. ?Not that it isn't great. It is. But man!, portion was big. And I licked my fingers until I felt stuffed. ?BBQ here is marinated over 10 hours and slowly smoke. ?It fell off the bone and so tender.... It was a good fun decision making coz we decided to take a break while visiting a Museum and went to Harlem to Dinosaur BBQ. ?After we finished, we went back downtown to the same museum. If you live in NYC, go to Dinosaur BBQ. ?It is on a not so scary part of Harlem. ?If you visit NYC, find time to go there. ?You won't be disappointed. ?Service was really good to from front door to dining room. ? Very cozy place too.

Trust me on this, I'm from Arkansas, and we know barbecue. Go. And try everything. Specifically, my favorite things at Dinosaur are: ribs, beans, greens, deviled eggs, fried green tomatoes, peel and eat shrimp, and the mac and cheese. The salted potatoes are good too. I am skeptical of beef in bbq restaurants; I tried the brisket on a friend's plate, and it was perfectly good, but, really, if you're going for bbq, go with pork. If you want a seat on a weekend, call ahead or be prepared to wait.

Oh BBQ. Brings me back to the South. My days growing up in suburbia. That is why I really like this place. This place is huge. I mean, I hear about how crowded it gets and am glad I didn't have to experience it. I came for Sunday lunch and there was plenty of room. But it is really good food so I can see how people would be running to get their BBQ fix. First off, it took me 2+ years to get here after first moving to NY and hearing about this place. Finally, as I was visiting my friend on 125th St, we ended up walking to this place for lunch. The sweet tea is sweet but it's really good. Loooove sweet tea! And free refills. Totally unexpected in NY. We split an order of the single fried green tomatoes and the Tres Hombres. Let me tell you, we couldn't finish! It's a whole lotta food for two girls. The fried green tomatoes were good but the sauce was a little watery. The mac and cheese was really good, the pulled pork and ribs were great, but the beef brisket was just ok. The cornbread wasn't bad but nothing spectacular. Overall it was good food for a reasonable price.

Any review for this place that isn't five stars is an absolute lie. They better have died from the delicious BBQ and even then I could only see them giving the place four stars just because they couldn't eat there again. Honestly, I cannot think of a fault in this restaurant. The food is sublime, nothing on the menu has fault. I recommend that you get both the wings and the BBQ. Make sure you bring an empty stomach or be prepared to stay for a few hours. The bar serves an excellent selection on local beers. The staff are all cool dudes with totally laid back attitudes. If you visit NYC, you must stop here.

For my money, this is as good as NYC barbecue gets. ?The location is unfortunate because it's so out of the way, but you don't need a police escort to walk through Harlem these days so I felt okay leaving the place after dark. I ordered a big sampler dish and enjoyed the ribs a lot but was blown away by the brisket. ?Hands down the best I have ever eaten. ?The pulled pork was really something as well! ?Don't forget to load up on sides, but you can skip the cornbread. ?

Can I just say that this place is absolutely delicious with a heaping side of GREAT service and people! ?Even though its a trek for us to get all the way up here from downtown, I just LOVE this place. ?This is probably my favorite bbq spot in NY. Aside from the delicious bbq, you get yummy sides, great portions, s trong but tasty drinks, and unbeatable prices! The ribs are flavorful and fall of the bone, pulled pork is super tasty, chili is GREAT, and the potato salad and mac n cheese are two of my fav sides. ?What's even better? ?They have happy hour!!! ?Donkey punch for $6, and believe me this drink will definitely kick your butt, but in a good way. ?To top all of this wonderfulness off, this spot is stocked with an awesome staff that's welcoming and friendly and really just makes you feel comfy and wanted. ?There is absolutely no pretentiousness here, just down right great food, drinks, and people. A quick tip: ?it gets packed packed packed here. ?We got here at 6:30 and there was already an hour wait. ?So come with reservations or come early, and by early I mean 5! ?This way you get to enjoy the happy hour with your food.

Went all the way up there and it's just ordinary. I had the chicken and beef brisket. The corn bread could have come out of a box. The beans out of a can. The meat was good, but I wasn't doing backflips. For me not to finish my BBQ is almost unheard of. Yeah, it's only like $15-20 for a big plate. Maybe they cut corners. Plus the atmosphere is pretty cheesy. Like they went to a TGIF salvage sale and then had their staff write PG graffiti all over the walls. Seems like eating at Dinosaur's is a big event for some people and they arrive by the SUV-load. If you're in the neighborhood, try it. But otherwise, I would hit Virgil's or Bluesmoke.

The meat itself was pretty good, but the chicken was great. ?The brisket and ribs were average.

Did I really give this 4 stars? Mesmerized by fried green tomatoes, I guess. We had two plates of pretty awful meat today -- maybe since we ordered sandwiches they thought they could dump their rejects on us and conceal it in buns. Came out cold. Waitress blew me off first time I tried to order, saying I had an appetizer coming -- which I guess barred me from ordering for a few minutes. If the meat is bad, don't serve it. Seems like rule #1 for a barbecue place.

I have family upstate in Buffalo, NY.... so ive been fortunate enough to experience the greatness that is real Buffalo Wings. There is a spot up there called La Nova that is probably the best damn wings you can get. Dinosaur BBQ is no La Nova's... especially since La Nova has about 10 different styles of wings from BBQ to Italian all the way to raspberry, But Dino ?BBQ is a damn good replica and probably the best you can find in the metro area. ?The wings are the star of the show here and they are everything they are hyped up to be if you like BBQ or Hot wings. As for the rest of the menu, the fried green tomatoes are ridonkulously good. Actually, pretty much all of their appetizers are so good to the point that your left somewhat dissapointed when the main dish comes around. ?This is definitly a great place to have a few beers from the huge selection and eat appetizers while watching the game. Dont get me wrong the food was pretty good. i found the sides to be mediocre, not bad, but nowhere near Blue Smoke quality. i came here with a large party so i was able to try a little bit of everything. For the most part, everything is good, the BBQ is better then most place in NY and probably Top 5 at least, just not anywhere near the best. The thing that will keep you coming back here is the portion sizes... for $22 dollars you can order a plate that has Half a Chicken, a pound of Brisket, a half rack of Ribs which is equivalent to a regular BBQ place's full rack, and 2 sides. ?Their full rack of ribs was astonishing... i lost my appetite as soon as i took a look at it. Truthfully any of their main dishes can easily feed 2-3 people. For great BBQ on the cheap, this place is at the top of the mound. i recommend that you take advantage of ordering take out here, the atmosphere may be nice, but wait times of 1-2 hours are not unusual. to sum up.. good food, fun atmosphere, Literally Dinosaur size portions, and cheap prices = Thumbs up

This is the place where you'll find grown men wearing their paper bibs loud and proud, ribs in one hand, beer in the other. Took our friends here for bbq the other night. Seriously, I recommend reservations if you know you are going to come here. They were quoting parties of 2 and up, waits of up to an hour and 45 minutes. With our reservations, we got a table in 5 minutes. The wings are easily the highlights. we did 13 wango tangos and 13 spicy as hell devilish ones because the people I was with are crazy thrill seekers who love to torture themselves with spicy ass food that leave them on the toilet for an hour the next day. I gently dabbed a bit of my celery in the hot sauce and breathed out fire. It's just not for the faint of heart. The quality of the ribs definitely dropped from the first time I was there. too dry and the sauce was too sweet.

I really like Dinosaur BBQ - it may not be the best of the best but between atmosphere and food it's great. ?I would highly recommend making reservations unless you want to wait almost 2 hours for a table (no matter what the day of the week or time of the day) - though if you wait at the bar they have some tasty homemade potato chips and the people watching is pretty fantastic - there are people from ALL walks of life at this place. Now onto the food - I didn't try any of the appetizers but they looked good as I watched them going to other tables. ?I was a little lame and had the BBQ shrimp salad but it was really tasty and I was a big fan of the mashed sweet potatoes and salt potatoes. ?The brisket and pulled pork was also pretty tasty. ?Fries were fairly average but the BBQ sauce is great (and gluten free may I add). ?Desserts: the chocolate icebox cake looked good though I didn't try it and I thought the banana pudding was pretty good. ?Far from the best dessert I've ever had but pretty tasty after a BBQ meal. ? Next time I go to Dinosaur I will be sure to make a reservation.

This place is ridiculous! Probably the best wings I have ever had! The wings are consistently amazing! ?The sauces are delicious, I personally like the wango tango the best. The ribs here are also just as amazing. As for sides my friend had ordered fried green tomatoes, I was a bit skeptical to try at first but I'm glad I did because they really good. My staple is the the mac & cheese, the syracuse potatoes and corn bread. I do have to say the potatoes are always consistent but the mac & cheese and the corn bread are hit and miss, they're never bad they're just not always at their very best. Also very important, make reservations otherwise have fun waiting for a table of your own and if you go during peak times you will be waiting! Other than that enjoy the deliciousness : )

Dined here for a friends birthday. ?I'll say this right from the get go, if you love deviled eggs as I do, you must, must come here and try them! ?They have a Creole seasoning over them that takes these amazing little pieces of heaven to another step! ?The table shared a sample platter that came with fried green tomatoes, deviled eggs, wings and shrimp. ?Every single item on that platter are finger licking good! And when you go to a BBQ joint be prepared to get your fingers dirty. I will go out on a limb here and say I believe that Dinosaur has one of the best wings in the city, and feel free to disagree with me but they are meaty and have the perfect amount of sauce and spice to them. ?One of my friends at the table said the spicy seasoned shrimp were great. I am not a fan of peeling my own shrimp so to each their own. ? For dinner I had the 1/4 rack with the bbq brisket and my date had the same but got the sausage instead and we shared. ?Everything was great, there really isn't anything to complain about and this place is another great option for BBQ if you are tired of going to your same joint. For sides I got the Mac and Cheese which was ok and the greens which were delicious. ?Date had the sweet potatoes mash which were by far my favorite and one of the best I have had at a BBQ place, comparable to Hill Country. ? Food portions aren't even a question, if you complain about it then I suggest you go see a dr and maybe think about changing your eating habits because there was not one person at the table that left hungry and some (including myself) bought home doggy bags. ?In fact no one ordered dessert because you just felt so full that if you put another piece of food in your mouth you were going to explode. ? To sum it up, another great BBQ place in NYC, out of the way but worth the travel. Some pointers...MAKE RSVP, we did but saw a couple waiting close to an hour for a table of just 4. ?Parking is a BITCH and there is not lot. ?Other than that, enjoy!!!

I went to SU and my friend grew up in Syracuse, so we knew we had to make the trek and relive our snow-filled days of barbecue. We didn't mind the creepy walk through the neighborhood (complete with several bouts of harassment that just caused us to walk faster, faster, faster), we didn't mind waiting an hour for a seat or eating at 11pm because we know that Dino is always worth it. The restaurant space is great, they had live music on Saturday night, the waiter was nice, the food came out really quickly. But something was a little...off. We each had the pulled pork plate, and I got mac'n'cheese and baked beans (they brought me fried rice at first and it took a good 10 minutes to flag down our waiter so I could remind him that NO ONE would order fried rice at a bbq joint, so please bring me my baked beans). The mac'n'cheese was aaaaaamazing. The beans were deeelish. And the pork was good, but it wasn't Syracuse Dinosaur good. I ate half my plate, was full, and got a to-go box. Back up north, I would stuff my face till I couldn't move it was THAT good. If you don't compare it to the original, then it's damn good barbecue and worth the trip. Just don't walk from the subway alone.

Like all restaurants in new york, you pay for quality. Delicious food, at not-so-cheap (but yes, affordable) prices. Atmosphere: I deducted one star for the fact that they don't take reservations and there is always an INSANE wait. Very crowded/chaotic. Good beer selection, though. A nice, informal place to get beer drunk and chow down on some meaty goodness. Don't take your date, take your friends. Definitely a 'better in larger groups' (i.e. 2+) type of place. The Food: The seafood (especially the cajun shrimp) was not so good. Pork is really where they excel. The ribs are hit or miss. I have found that I prefer the portobella and pulled pork sandwich to the pulled pork sandwich. The amount of filling on sandwiches varies widely, from recession-level skimpy to heart clogging. The mac n cheese is always supremely delicious. The baked beans are shockingly bleh (who knew you could somehow turn brown sugar and bacon coated beans into a tasteless, texture-less mess?) The salted quartered potatoes are EXCELLENT.

Hands down, the best BBQ in the city (so far). ?I went to this place on a friend's recommendation. ?It has a real mix of people (older couples, families, big groups of friends...) and all races - - good food knows no boundaries. Tables are wooden, worn, and rustic; as are the walls and decor overall. ?It has a rustic, lived-in feel, that does not feel forced or manufactured as some of the chain BBQ joints do. They had a wide selection of draft beers, I had two and both were perfect with the food and only $5 or $7 apiece. I ordered the sampler platter (for two, I think) which included a couple wings, a fried green tomato, a deviled egg, and two boiled HUGE shrimp. ?It was a smorgasbord of deliciousness. ?The meat fell off the bone. ?The tomato was crispy. ?Egg was tangy and had quite a zip. ?And the shrimp were fleshy and not at all rubbery; delish. ?The dipping sauces (ranch and bbq) were both stellar. I also had their blue cheese iceberge wedge salad. ?Copious amounts of very cheesy dressing pouring in all the layers of lettuce, halved grape tomatoes, and big slices and pieces of bacon on a bright blue plate... presentation was outstanding for a rustic BBQ joint, and the taste was out of this world. I want to go back now. ?GO!

had Dinosaur bookmarked ever since i saw it on the Food Network!! & then i found out they had a Manhattan location!! made a reservation & got here early BUT even though they had open tables they wouldn't seat us a minute before our rsvp time.. early bird doesn't get the worm!? started off with the FRIED GREEN TOMATOES which were delicious, nicely seasoned & battered crispy! the two of us shared the tres hombres so we could try a little of everything BUT the meat didn't come out hot! ---ribs were good but nothing amazing & not fall-off-the-bone ---pulled pork was eHHh & brisket was okay but again no wow factor ---corn bread was pretty standard ---FOR THE SIDES: bbq fried rice was interesting & salted potatoes were YUMMY esp w/ the sauce! ---of the bbq sauces at the table I liked the wango tango habanero! overall bbq's average but FRIED GREEN TOMATOES & sides are the business!

amazing food wish we ordered more but I didn't pay. The next time I go in going to call ahead. Waiting is the only down fall and no space ? To stand. Other than that go but take the 1 train not the 6 train like we did.

Their food was mouth watering. Ribs at Dinosaur Bar-B-Que was amazing. I truly enjoy its taste, volume, decor, service and most importantly its price. It was so cheap!! OMG, if I were order same amount of food, many rack of ribs would cost double in different BBQ place. It was delicious and I cleaned up all my plate. Loved it. Please try if you are hungry for ribs.

People are right when they say this place is overrated. ?We didn't make a reservation and they told us it would be an hour and 15 minute wait. ?We took a stroll down to fairway market so it wasn't a problem but the wait turned out to be only 45 minutes anyway. Service was good for the most part. ?I ordered the ribs with mac n cheese and whipped sweet potatoes. ?Ribs were nothing special but the BBQ sauce was good. ?Mac n Cheese was the highlight of the meal and a definite must order. ?Sweet potatoes was REALLY cinnamon-ny and seemed more like a dessert dish than anything. This place didn't live up to the hype, but I'd say the mac n cheese salvaged the night.

Okay, I LOVE BBQ, and I like it sweet. Dinosaur BBQ is great. I live in Brooklyn, and I make the trek to Harlem just to eat their food. Sure, the ribs and BBQ might not be the best in the entire city, but they have the best sides with their food in the city. I mean, Fette Sau in Williamsburg bugs the crap out of me. Their sides suck! At Dinosaur, get the mac and cheese! Get the fries! Get the deviled eggs! mmmm

I do not understand how this pace has four stars. The service was terrible and so was the food. Me and my husband were seated, then forgotten buy our waitress for 15 minutes. She then came back to take our drink order, and disappeared for another 10, when we flagged her down and asked for our drinks again she said "oh we are out of the beer you wanted." We ordered something else, she disappears again, then finally comes back to take our lunch order, but she still doesn't have our drinks. The drinks ended up coming when our food arrived. This was the worst BBQ I have ever eaten, it was cold, dry, and tasteless. My husband didn't even eat more that 3, and he LOVES ribs. The only good thing I had here were my fried green tomatoes. This place gets customer based off hype and people who don't know any better.

My last trip to NYC, I was traveling with my cousin who lives in the Philippines. One of the things she really wanted while in the states was some good ol' BBQ. Dinosaur BBQ was recommended to us, and after looking up the Yelp reviews, we decided this was our place. The restaurant itself is huge, with a really fun decor and vibe to it. The service here is okay, could have been much better. However, the food was pretty good here. I usually prefer and only really like to eat ribs when they're home made/barbequed, but the ribs here are pretty good. Between 3 girls, we ordered one Sweetheart Deal and also an extra half rack of ribs. We started off with an order of Fried Green Tomatoes, and had the following accompanying sides: mac n cheese, simmered veggies, corn bread, and fried rice. The sides were great and so were the ribs - the one complaint I do have about the ribs was that they were on the dry side. The meat on the ribs were cooked well - tasty, juicy, soft, and falling off the bone. The marinade/sauce was pretty tasty, but we had to still add bbq sauce since it was dry. Overall, great place if you're looking for bbq. Fun and lively vibe, a great socializing/family type of restaurant.

When I saw a BBQ joint open in West Harlem I just knew that there would be much more gentrification to follow. ?Located underneath the Henry Hudson Parkway right off 125th street (take the 1 train to 125 and walk towards the water), this restaurant is a door key away from being my new apartment. ? By far the best chicken wings I've had in my life; the Wango Tango, and Garlic Chipotle are hot but just enough to keep the body healthy. ?This restaurant instantly became not only my favorite BBQ joint in the city, but also the new meeting place for my friends and me. ?I've never wanted to visit Syracuse so badly. ? Enjoy.

Like infants placated by bottle or breast, I am always calmed by a tender platter of smoky, greasy, sweet and spicy pork ribs. ?Not this time. ?Dinosaur's food is overrated. ?Don't expect too much and you will be fine. ?If you expect best bbq in the city - you will be crestfallen. ?Rack'n'Soul is still number one for me for ribs. ? There is a very cool looking bar at the end of 12th Ave with Chinese lions at the front and beautiful purple lighting. ?Looks like $$$. ?You do need to gather an elf, a ranger, a wizard, and three hobbits to get here though. ?Especially from Queens. ? Coleslaw was actually my favoriteside - crunchy, creamy, tart without sweetness. ?Habanero-based Duel sauce is great, but the garlic chipotle is awesome. ?Chicken is actually better than any other meat on the menu.

Went to this place for a friend's birthday. It was pretty great. They were also really nice and arranged for a cake to be brought out. A really nice atmosphere and great service (especially cause we were a huge party on a Saturday night!) It's also nice because the bar has its own separate section, so we grabbed drinks while we waited for our party to arrive. And they even seated us before all of us were there. Would definitely recommend you try it. I had a veggie portobello burger (to keep a veggie friend company), and it was delicious! All my friends liked their order, especially the jerk salmon which I tried and loved. Portions were smaller than I expected but that might be just me, so it gets 4 stars. I wish I should give it a 4.5.

I think this is the best place that I have gone for ribs. ?I must say that I am from Seattle, and the North West is lacking in places for good BBQ. I ordered the Ribs and I was blown away on the texture and flavor of the ribs. ?They were smoky with a crispy texture on the outside due to the caramelization of glaze and yumminess . ?The order of ribs came with 2 sides, but we decided to upgrade to 4 sides. ?I would recommend getting the mac and cheese, and the sweet potato was also a great choice. ? I wish I had gone here another time, but I did not get the opportunity. This place will cost a pretty penny, but it is still worth every shiny penny

I'm under the impression that this is great BBQ for NY but when you consider BBQ beyond New York, its just alright. I would return - I'm just not blown away. The interior of the restaurant is large and spacious. The tables are all rather far apart which is nice for the dining experience. When I dined here I was surprised that the wait was so short. I was expecting a long wait but probably only waited about 45 to an hour. Not bad at all. My group ordered: - spicy shrimp - BBQ chicken wings - pork ribs - beef brisket - pulled pork - greens - mac & cheese - BBQ beans The shrimp was good although I did not see on the menu that is was served cold and wasn't really ready to eat cold shrimp. Wings were nothing noteworthy. Pork ribs were tender - probably the best meat we tried. The brisket was thin-sliced like it belonged on a sandwich...only it wasn't on a sandwich. Pulled pork was solid. Greens were surprisingly good for being vegetarian. I'm always inclined to believe greens should be cooked with pork. Mac & cheese was good as a side item...but would not hold its own as a main dish. BBQ beans were disgustingly sweet. They were pretty much left untouched by our group. I hope I came on an "off-day" if this is the best BBQ that New York has to offer.

Aaah, my neighborhood 'cue joint. Now inhabiting new digs, but serving They do a respectable job, but it'll cost ya about 4x as much as the real deal would down Souf. Solid fried green toms, ribs, brisket, pulled pork. Full bar. Bitchin' mac & chz, right-on turnip greens... there are some good things happening here. Full bar and an extensive array of brews. The only problem is that it's SO DAMN CROWDED lately. The last few times I've dropped by there has been a two hour wait for a 2-top, so I've walked down the street to Toast instead. I suppose reservations are the way to go now.

This menu is large and overwhelming, but one great thing about it is that it is designed to allow you to sample (almost literally) everything. ?It's as if they read the mind of weary bbq eaters, who had to commit to a huge rack of ribs, or pile of meat, with the lingering curiosity about the rest of menu. ?Lots of different sampler plates for appetizers and entrees on the menu, and our waitress informed us they'd be happy to work out adding something if we didn't see it . Sweet! ?So, sample we did. ?We had the appetizer sample for two, with their spicy shrimp, deviled eggs, chicken wings, fried green tomatoes. ?Unfortunately, none were especially great. ?The tres hombres platter included pulled pork, brisket, ribs, and a biscuit. ?All the meats were divine. There are bottles of sauce at the table, some of which I wanted to sneak into my purse. ?Had the PumpKing seasonal beer, which tasted like a punkin pie made out with an IPA - dreamy. ?Chocolate icebox cake was a snooze, on par with a dessert you'd find at Applebees or TGI, I'm sorry to say.

Wango Tango wings were devoured the second the plate reached the table and did not disappoint. The heat was starting to build up after 2 wings, but didn't scorch my taste buds. I had a nice spice-buzz, as I like to call it: includes smacking of lips and deep sips of air to cool off the tongue. I ordered the Big Ass pork plate with a side of cornbread (lovvvvvvvved it) mac & cheese and pork beans. Surprisingly the pork was a bit dry so I added a garlic chipolte sauce. My boyfriend's Brisket plate with cornbread, creole potato salad and mac & cheese was tastier. Brisket literally melted in my mouth. The next time, I would probably order more wings, less of the plate meals. ***** NEED reservations ******

Why the hype?? For years I've heard nothing but convincing and motivational hype about Dinosaur BBQ. ?Half of my Southern & Midwestern friends swear by this place. ?I'm a super busy dude...but finally got to attend a bday bash there. ?I was drooling over the online menu and looking forward to it all day (well, in actuality, for years prior). ?When all was said and done, with the exception of the ribs, I was let down. The inventive menu names, large variety, great atmosphere, plus the friendly and (mostly) attentive staff definitely made the out-of-the-way locale doable. ?I wanted to start off with their Nice Tea (blueberry stoli-style sweet tea). ?They were out. ?But they have Ommegang Abbey Ale on tap! ?That's super hard to find in the States. ?So I ordered it. ?20 minutes later the waitress comes back to tell me they're out of that as well. Strike two, y'all! ?But I pressed my luck & ordered the Pom Bomb: a brazilian rum drink. ?Success! ?Kinda. ?Great flavor and decently heavy-handed pour. ?But it cost $8 for a half-pint glass which was mostly filled with ice. ?I was done in a few sips. ?Someone else ordered a Sangria and the Donkey Punch (gotta love the name!). ?They were both served in a pint glass with moderate ice. ?The Manhattans others ordered were served in standard-size stemless martini glasses. ?Don't know why this was so tiny for the same price. ?So I'd stick with other drinks...or chose from their wide selection of draft beer, which is only $6 a pint or $21 for a big pitcher. We decided to get the $20 swag sampler for the table. ?They say it serves four. ?They must have meant 4 toddlers. ?It came with 6 Spicy Shrimp (excellent flavor!), 4 Chicken Wings (very good!), 4 Fried Green Tomatoes (bland batter and the same circumference as the bottom of a pint glass), and 4 deviled eggs (awesome!). ?We had to order a second. ?Overall good cuisine but no swag due to the disproportion to the cost. Due to the small app I went big on the main course. ?I ordered the Ode to Elgin (sausage, ?rack of ribs, brisket, cornbread, and two sides - I chose mac & cheese and whipped sweet potatoes with spicy nut topping). ?Good amount of food for the money ($19). ?But the sausage was oddly seasoned. ?The brisket was moist enough but fatty and not super flavorful. ?The cornbread was so-so. ?The mac & cheese was bland, except for the cayenne pepper they put on top (to think of it, most of their idea of spicy seemed to be 'sprinkle cayenne on top'). ?The whipped sweets had something off with the seasoning...and the nut topping, which was good, was sparse. ?I did love the ribs, though. ?And their Wango Tango Haba?ero BBQ Sauce was good. I left full but wasn't pleased with what I received for $45 bucks (including tax & tip). ?I'm picky but very open to different styles of bbq. ?That being said, I know what's good. ?I grew up with southern relatives' cooking, I've lived in the south, and through my work travels I've had my share of the best Southern & Midwestern bbq. ?For the price, this fell short for me. ?If you're in NYC, I'd recommend Virgil's (pricier but better quality, flavor, and portions) or Famous Dave's (equal price with better flavor and more for your money). ?Down south or in the Midwest look again for Famous Dave's, Smokey Bones, or Sticky Fingers. ?I'd go back for a good friend's function, sticking to the ribs or trying the catfish...but they'd really have to be a good friend for me to bang out that kind of cash for the product.

Loved it! ?I'm a Texan perpetually in search for amazing BBQ and Mexican in this city, so upon reading the reviews on Dinosaur I was definitely intrigued. ?I have gotten my hopes up many a time only to be smashed to the ground by "great bbq" or "great mex" in NYC, but this food was amazing. ?Big fan! ?I typically never, and I mean never, do a two hour wait but for some reason I was a bit curious about the hoopla surrounding this place if so many people subject themselves to such a lengthy wait, so we figured eh, we'll just have a few beers at the bar. ?It actually wasn't so bad because the atmosphere was nice and everyone seemed very jovial at the thought of chowing down on that bbq. ? Let me just tell you, I was not disappointed. ?We enjoyed a few beers, deviled eggs (best I've had), pulled pork, brisket, tons of bbq sauce (I love variety so I try them all), pork ribs, potato salad, and mac and cheese. ?Yummmmmy!! ?I was in BBQ heaven. ?Well worth the trip to Harlem for this stuff, I'll be back soon!

DINOSAUR! I went there with a few friends and we wanted to dine-in but it was an insane hour wait and we were all starvinggg. I think my stomach was getting angry and starting to growl at me for food. Anyways, we didn't have the patience to sit around for another hour waiting, so we took our food to go and walked a block down to the Hudson River and just basked in the sun. CLEVER idea when you don't want to wait forever. With the restaurant being so insanely packed, you would imagine taking food out would be a massive wait too, but they were fast! I got brisket with a side of fried rice. I was curious why everyone was saying their fried rice was really good. I'm Chinese, I go to chinatown ALL the time. I think I know what good fried rice would be. It was definitely good! But not what I would expect. It's different... but I still liked it! GOOD JOB DINOSAUR! You got another happy customer!

You wouldn't think one would crave BBQ after a bike ride to Harlem from Hell's Kitchen in 90 degree heat, but somehow, I did. ?And luckily we had biked right to Dinosaur BBQ! (what are the odds?) Came here on a Sunday, around 3PM, and there was about a 20min wait for a table for two. And its 90 degrees out. WHAT? Yep, this place is POPULAR. Decided to get takeout and ordered the brisket plate which comes with your choice of two sides and a cornbread piece, all for $20. The brisket was really good and the BBQ sauce they gave us (generously portioned) was tangy and smokey. They also threw in a couple of slices of jalapenos on top of the meat. Perfect. The side of beans was out of this world. It had pieces of brisket in it. OMG delicious. The coleslaw was surprisingly refreshing, tangy and did not have too much mayonnaise. I was impressed. ?The hush puppies were OK. Slightly too dry and didn't taste like corn. I like my cornbread on the sweeter side. Still good though. Dinosaur (first of all, that theme is awesome) BBQ was filling, delicious, and the staff was extremely friendly which makes everything better. ?However, this is a bit pricey for bbq.. and our take-out, which should have been ready almost immediately, took around 15 mins. But I'm sure I'll be back to satisfy another bbq craving ... Looked like a pretty sweet place to grab a group together, as long as you don't mind the wait, or if you go at odd hours.

I had high expectations going into this place - many friends who had been living in upper west side couldn't stop talking about this place. The food is average at best. The meat was so so; the sides were not out of this world. My family had the Nuevo sampler and the sweetheart deal (dinner for 2) and the sides we chose were french fries, sweet potatoes, Cole slaw, and iceberg wedges. ?Their fries were the best side we had chosen; sweet potatoes with nuts was way too sweet to be a side item (it should be a dessert); cole slaw was bland and the iceberg wedges were drenched in dressing. ?The service was below average. ?We had flag down the waiter to get refills and the beer was lukewarm and we had to send it back. ? OVerall, if you happened to be in the area and want less than average BBQ - this is the place to be.

I had an absolutely fantastic meal that exceeded my expectations, which were high to begin with. ?I read all the great reviews and my friends love the place so I knew I had to try it. ?The food was just amazing! ?Each item individually was some of the best I've ever had, and not just the BBQ, but the sides and drinks were fantastic also. ?The staff is very friendly and casual, very good relaxed service. ?We had a reservation and they seated us right away. ?For an appetizer I had the chicken wings in hoisin sauce, maybe the best wings I've ever had, packed with flavor and very meaty. ?For drinks we were very happy with the selection of beers, but not being a lover of beer I ordered what the table next to me had, some kinda rum punch. ?Wow what a great strong drink, packed with flavor and alcohol, it was a good value at $8. ? For the main course both myself and my company had the Tres Hombres (Ribs, Brisket, Pulled Pork) with 2 sides and cornbread. ?I was in heaven with this meal! The ribs fell off the bone, great flavor, lean and very meaty. ?The pulled pork was very good, still in pieces, not mushy and thrown together the way a lot of pulled pork is usually presented. ?However my favorite part of the meal was the brisket, which is something I don't generally enjoy that much. ?Definitely the best brisket I've ever had. ?The meat was not marbled and was quite lean, however there was a thin strip of extremely flavorful fat on the outside, just enough that I did not feel guilty eating it. ?Great flavor, texture, and the color of the food from the smoke was really nice, I definitely saw a lot of red smoke rings in the food. ? The sides too were memorable and fantastic, the beans with pork was packed with flavor; same with the mac and cheese which was probably the best I've ever had. ?The fries were very good, fresh, crisp. ?Everything was kinda perfect. ?Over all I'd say the value, service, food and vibe (I heard some Stevie wonder playing) was just excellent! ?On the way out the manager or waiter or whomever he was gave us a huge smile and asked that we come back, you know it! ?Highly recommended, go out of your way for this BBQ place.

RULE#1: MAKE A RESERVATION I can't emphasize this enough. ?Otherwise, you're looking at an hour to two hour wait. ?And, while the barbecue is phenomenal, why bother waiting if you can get seated almost immediately WITH A RESERVATION? Boyfriend and I made the trek up on a Saturday afternoon. ?(Transportation Note: If you're heading up from downtown, take the A train since it goes express from 59th to 125th and either catch the Bx15 bus straight to the restaurant or walk over, it's better than suffering through the miserable local 1 train.) ?At 2PM, the staff was giving out an estimated wait time of one hour. ?We already had a reservation so we were seated right away. And then, the fun began. Apps: Shared the app sampler for two. ?Everything was great but the item that really stood out was the chicken wings. ?HOLY COW. ?I don't usually care for wings and my boyfriend grew up in Buffalo so he's a wing snob. ?But, these had us dying. ?They were cooked perfectly and the Wango Tango sauce is divine. Entree: In an attempt to try a little bit of everything, we ordered the Tres Hombres and requested a 1/2 rack instead of the 1/4 rack of ribs. ?It was actually the perfect amount of food for the two of us. ?The ribs were falling off the bone. ?Juicy. ?Pulled pork was moist and flavorful. ?The mac and cheese was spectacular. ?The only things we weren't completely raving over were french fries and the brisket. ?Everything else was awesome. Dessert: We ordered the sweet potato pecan pie which sounds great in theory but was poorly executed. ?Too many pecans and it clearly was served straight out of the fridge. ?Next time, we may opt for the cheesecake instead. ? Beverages: They have a nice selection of beer and my favorite Sixpoint Sweet Action is available! ?The sweet tea was fine but the lemonade was really the star. Service: The service was good and our waitress was delightful despite the fact that she was obviously very busy. ? With my BlackboardEats code, our bill was a mere $36. ?We'll definitely be back and for the quality of barbecue, we'll be happy to pay full price. ?Best barbecue available in NYC.

I finally made the trip up to 131st, and I was not disappointed. ?I had a pulled pork and brisket platter with sides of mac & cheese and french fries. ?To drink I had the whiskey smash, and for dessert I had a blueberry & peach cobbler special. Dinosaur serves their barbecue the way that I believe everyone should: with very little barbecue sauce so that you can choose from the different sauces on the table. ?(The sauces were all excellent, by the way.) ?I would say that the highlight of the meal was the pulled pork. ?It was incredibly tender, yet flavorful. The brisket also had a great flavor. ?My one complaint would be that it was a little fattier than I like my brisket to be, but I view that as more of a matter of personal taste with brisket. ?There seem to be a lot of people who like their brisket fattier than I do. ?Either way, it was very tender and had a very good taste. I would also recommend the mac & cheese. ?I'm whats known as a "separate eater". ?(Once I start eating one item on my plate, I finish that item before moving on to anything else.) ?So it's entirely possible that I may have just been tasting the spicier barbecue sauces that I had put on my pulled pork and brisket earlier, but I'm pretty sure that the mac & cheese had some sort of spicy seasoning ?on top. The french fries were good, but nothing out of the ordinary. ?Also, the cobbler and whiskey smashes were very good, as well. ?I was very impressed at how cold the drinks were when they reached my table. ?This reminds me. ?The service was excellent, especially in light of how busy the place was. My only real complaint would be that I thought that the portion was a bit small, of course this might be because I ordered a sampler-type platter, which is the official meal of barbecue posers everywhere.

I have to say this place barely makes a 4. ?It's closer to a 3.5. ?Anyway I was absolutely starving by the time we sat down. ?I was hungover from the day earlier and we just did come community work and I have yet to eat anything for the day (it was about 2 something). ?I was famished! ?I ordered a full rack of ribs and my friend ordered the brisket and pork. ? The ribs were great and the brisket was tender the pork was meh. ?Considering how hungry I was I thought the food would have tasted like 100 times better but it was just pretty good nothing amazing. ? The service was hard to get. ?Our waitress was very elusive and super busy. ?I think the place could use a couple of more waitresses. ?The bartender on the other hand was great. ?She was busy and there was only one of her for the whole bar but it still worked out. ?She always had her eye out for everyone. ? I was surprised how quick the food came out which is great considering how busy they were. ?I also have to comment that they have a fantastic beer selection. ?They have something like 25 beers on tap and another idk dozen bottles of beer. ? If im really hungry for BBQ and i'm in the area I suppose i would come again. ?But Normally this place is way too out of the way for me.

I spent 5 years of my life in the wasteland of Syracuse. ?One good thing was Dinosaur (if you ever drive through you might be able to get the Terrell's Dinosaur BBQ Chips, They are fantastic). ?I cannot recall the number of times I had takeout from that place. ?It was Corner Bistro sized, and really the only good place to eat there, so I was totally pumped when I found one was coming to NYC. ?I try and make the tip up there every couple of months just to get a good amount of q in the system. ?I love the Tres Hombres combo, it's a bit of everything. ?Sides are good, mac and cheese, mmmmmm. ?Fried green tomatoes, very good. If you are on a diet, you might want to steer clear. ?Vegetarian's (at least in SYR they did) are in luck they have some off the menu items. Busy nite tip: you can get full service in the bar area, if you can get a table there, first come first served, you can get a full meal without the 2 hour wait. ?We got one, and as we were finishing our meal we heard our name be called to sit, so it was a goof thing for us... The restrooms have that biker bar feel to them, but are kept up for the most part, and if you have a sharpie bring it in and leave your stamp. ?3 Flushes

Just went there for lunch today, and it was amazing. ?There are a lot of grumpy reviews on Yelp because of the crowd/wait/slow service, but that wasn't an issue for me. ?The place was full, but not overly so. I've been to the one in Syracuse a few times because I went to school at Cornell, but it's been 7-8 years since my last trip there, and I was interested to see if it would be as good as I remembered it being, particularly compared to R.U.B., my favorite BBQ restaurant in NYC (until today). It blew R.U.B. out of the water. ?One thing about R.U.B. is it can be inconsistent, and sometimes the meat isn't as tender as you'd expect from a serious barbecue joint. ?I had the Tres Hombre sampler at Dinosaur today, with Texas beef brisket, pork ribs, and pulled pork, and all three were super tender and moist. ?The seasoning was fantastic, as were the many sauces that Dinosaur gives you to choose from. The drunken spicy shrimp boil that we ordered as an appetizer wasn't bad, but not quite as tasty as I remembered it being when I last had it up in Syracuse. ?And the mac and cheese was creamy and cheesy, and I could swear I detected a slight hint of animal in there too, which made it all the more delicious.

I came here with about a table of 20 people. They couldn't find a table to seat all of us together, so they gave us two separate tables. But we asked if we could put the tables together and they accomodated us. Except our table had to be oriented in a way that did not align with the other tables in order to fit, but it's all good. Each group of four ordered the family style meals. It was a lot of food but we all managed to clean out the table. The ribs are soooo soft and slides off the bones. They practically melted in my mouth.

For my birthday, I reserved a space for a party of 25. The staff was very accommodating and pleasant. ? The food was delicious, bbq ribs, chicken, mac & cheese, greens, and beans served family style. ?

The chicken was cooked perfectly The people at the table all fought for the mac & cheese side The brisket has great spice but could use more meaty flavor Ribs were tender, juicy, and the tangy BBQ sauce is delicious The beans side went well with the meats The waitress was an idiot. She forgot about the Diet Coke order. Then we told her to cancel it. It was still on the bill. When we pointed it out, she said she'd remove it. It took her 4 tries to figure out how to split the check properly, and then we figured out she still hadn't removed the Diet Coke. I wish there was one of these in Astoria, but with better service.

The wings here are really awesome, they are large with a lot of meat on them. The sauces were very flavorful and had depth to the spices. The chipotle garlic was my favorite, had a nice kick at the end with spice but still actually had rich taste. The fried green tomatoes were also great, the breading was crispy all the way through and the tomatoes had a nice crunch. However the rest of the food we tried was only okay. The macaroni and cheese was a little bitter tasting. The pulled chicken sandwich was a disappointment and was just chopped up chicken and had so much extra filler with peppers an onions that you lost the true quality of the chicken and the barbeque sauce. ?My husband had the ribs and agreed that although the sauce was great that it was just an average rib. It was a trek for us to get up there and we would go again but would just stick with the wings.

The side dishes are to die for here... ?I was here last weekend to celebrate a friend's birthday, and all 6 of us at the table ordered the mac and cheese side dish.. spicy and creamy.. ? I also had a side of the ?Syracuse-style salted potatoes -baby potatoes smothered in butter and salt.. just the way I like it . ?and you should start with the fried green tomatoes..comes with great dipping sauce. As a vegetarian, I only had one entree to choose from - portobello burger sandwich. While, I generally choose against this option at most restaurants due to its usual dryness and lack of taste, however Dinosaur BBQ seemed to have found the right additions to make it taste just right. ?dessert was a bit on the sweet side, and I preferred the peanutbutter pie over the chocolate one. As for the service, I arrived a bit late so I'm unsure of how long my party actually waited for a table. But once we were seated, they were quick to wait and serve on us.

A large group of my friends went to Dinosaur Bar-B-Que to celebrate a birthday. ?It must be said that most of the people who came are big on BBQ and any restaurant that has a good selection of meats. I can't speak for everyone who came with me, but I was expecting a spectacular BBQ experience. ?It just simply wasn't. ?We went very early on a Saturday since apparently the place gets packed any later on. ?We later found out this was true since when we were leaving the entrance was jam-packed of people waiting to be seated as well as a good sized crowd outside. The food was very in-expensive and came in plentiful amounts. ?A huge plus for a group of guys like us. ?It was tasty, if you enjoy your food slathered in overly-sweet BBQ sauce. ?The cuts of meat were OK, nothing special. ?The ribs; which I imagined would be the place's strong point, were actually it's low point. ?A tiny rack, with way too much sauce. ?I've eaten at other establishments not know for their ribs serving much better than this. ?The meat was tough and you had to get dirty to get to it. ?I would have expected some eat-with-a-fork ribs for all the praises this place gets. The bar is a typical BBQ joint type, with great cheap beers you can get in a bucket. ?Nothing spectacular, but it fits the establishment perfectly. Our waitress was very kind to us, as was everyone who had to deal with our large (slightly inebriated) party. Ironically, we all went there for the ribs and meat dishes, but left talking more about the Deviled Egg appetizer and beer buckets. Dinosaur BBQ gets 3 stars in my book, good food (not great, nothing special for BBQ), great service (though we were there when they weren't at peak), cheap drinks. ?Its is a good place, just not worth all they hype it gets from some of it's more hard-core fans. COST: an incredible value FOOD: ?Good BBQ, nothing spectacular SERVICE: good, so long as you aren't there during their busy time ATMOSPHERE: made to look like a down south Texan/Cowboy BBQ pit with a dinosaur theme. LIKE: BROTHER JIMMY'S but with better food, LONGHORN without that chain restaurant feeling, OUTBACK with an large-portion American style.

Having heard a lot of good about this place, I went actually a little leery. Surely it couldn't be as good as everyone said. We had a reservation for 7 people, they seated us with only 4 there. Rare in NYC, but very great of them to do. We quickly order apps to share, and they were really good. The service was really good. Attentive server, and the food came out very quickly! Now to the food... The ribs were excellent. Fall off the bone meat, with great flavor. Their bbq sauces are excellent as well. I sampled at least four of the sides. The salt potato's were really good, as was the Mac and cheese. Collards...well, not quite as good as Paula Deans. Everything I sampled I would highly recommend! Portion sizes were very large also. It is a little out of the way, and the walk there from the 125th street station can be a little frightening. I suggest walking 125th over to street, then the block or so up to 131st. Don't walk up to 131st and then over because that street is much shadier, and less traveled. Great place, check it out!

The only reason this place is getting 3 stars is for the appetizer sampler, which had the best fried green tomatoes I've ever had. Deviled eggs, bbq wings and peel and eat shrimp, also came in the sampler and were equally good. I was impressed that all four items were served at their individual temperature. The ribs, pulled pork, brisket were a huge disappointment. Tasted very institutional - bland. The brisket was looked like warm grey matter. At least our waitress was really sweet and friendly.

Excellent excellent excellent. Every time I have guests visiting NYC, I have to take them to Dino BBQ. For me, all the meat BBQ are awesome. Beef brisket, Pork ribs + the Fried Rice, OMG yumm yummm. My wife loves the pulled pork sandwich. I usually drive to the place because it is such a pain in the butt to take the train there. It could be a little challenging to find a parking spot sometimes. Also, if you go at night (especially Fri and Sat), then it can be very crowded.

Being from the south means that you have a taste for good BBQ...and some of the northern offerings often fail to meet my criteria for what makes for real tasty Q. Dinosaur is the real deal. From the moment we walked in the tucked away Harlem joint (a little out the way, but it makes for a good adventure) I was hit with a familiar scent of smokey roadhouse goodness...the atmosphere was totally cool. It had a real authentic feel to it without seeming touristy. It's Harlem location (under the West Side Hwy.) almost guarantees only die-hards will make the trek. There were cool, cheesy movie posters on the wall like 'Werewolves on Wheels' and other fun trailer-trash paraphenalia. We started out with 2 Southern Tier Pumking beers. They were some of the best pumpkin beers I've ever had, although very pricey. The food was fantastic. I am always sceptical going to a Q joint in NYC. It takes real skill to pull off really good BBQ, and alot of joints I've been to here seem to just heat it up and slather it in BBQ sauce which definitely does NOT work. Wife and I shared the sampler: brisket (smoked for 14 hours!), pulled pork & ribs. The brisket was the best. Great crust with that pink halo around the meat...nice and fatty. The pork was good. The ribs were also very tasty and tender. The sides we got were the beans and the mac n cheese. Nothing disappointed. All very authentic. And it was more than enough food for the 2 of us, so the bill was relatively low, considering. I would def go back.

Wait on a Tuesday night at 7pm, was 45 minutes. Very reasonable--so worth it. I got the $15.50 platter with ribs (charred skin on the outside, juicy meat surrounding the bones), pulled pork (just a dallop of bbq sauce was all it came with and needed), side of mac and cheese (best ive ever had-- loved the red powder they topped it with-- gave it a nice subtle kick), cornbread (I lucked out with getting the slices with the edge crust), and the bbq fried rice (haha it tasted like asian fried rice...might skip this next time). Anyways, over all-- finger licking delish! When Im at Hill Country, using the sauce is a MUST because the meats so dry...but I only used it once at Dinosaur bc I just wanted to check out the different flavors they had. My friend lives for their BBQ chicken sandwich, and got the side of beans and extra helping of cornbread. And trust me, I was full by the end of my meal, but since the main course was so good....we ordered the key lime pie. I love that it had more of a cheesecake texture than custard. Best Ive had in a long time. **Take out is immediate service, so if you dont want ?to wait, grab a dino bag and eat by the river! **Saw Theo from The Huckstables and Pharoahe Munch

I've been to Dinosaur Bar-B-Que twice and enjoyed it both times. The wings are unbelievably good. All different kinds of sauces on them. Mild to awesomely hot. Their side dishes are incredible. I had a side dish of corn, and the spices they put on it were amazing! The staff is very friendly, and they don't bother you too often. One of the worst things for me is how waiters come over 5 times in the first 15 minutes, and they did not do this. They let us get started on our meal and didn't come up to us for a good 15 minutes. They only came over when we called them over. The atmosphere is really nice. The bar always has a bunch of people, and it is never too loud, so if you are sitting down at a table, you can have a conversation without yelling at the person 24" to your right, or 30" to your left. Weekends get extremely packed, so I suggest going Monday-Thursday. I unfortunately forgot to make a reservation, for a Saturday night, and the wait was 3 hours! Crazy, right? Even better, they handle the large crowds very well.

My girlfriend & buddy arrived at 9:10pm Sunday night for dinner. We were told no further seatings unless we reserved. The reason, "We got slammed today." Supposed to be open til 10pm. The host suggested ordering takeout...but that would be 45mins--What?!!. It wasn't even busy when we arrived, neither at the bar nor at the restaurant. I was puzzled, but not to be dissuaded we placed a takeout order and went to the bar to wait. More problems... 4 bartenders "working", it took 15 mins for anyone to notice us sitting at the bar stools. I'm sure it was busy earlier, because they were out of ribs (a tragedy) but definitely not busy now. My buddy, a bartender himself, said it was the same terrible bar service a few months ago when he was here. Anyway, seeing as how the place was still half-full of diners we asked a waitress if we could sit in the bar area and eat..."no problem" she said. The night appeared salvageable; we're eating in the restaurant despite their efforts. But then the food arrives, 2 sides missing which took 20 minutes to correct. However, while I waited at the takeout counter, every other order was walking up with missing items. Every seasoned customer took an inventory to make sure his or her orders were correct. Girls at the front counter were complaining alongside the patrons at the kitchens' ineptitude. It was a total disaster as I watched for 20 -30 mins while waiting, paying, correcting errors, etc...it really wasn't that busy either. This debacle may have been a ONE off situation but I talked to others who had similar stories to tell. The BBQ is very good, but the operations were mismanaged and it definitely took away from the food experience. They need to clean house and get organized. Food: Beans- ehh, more like bean soup Pulled Pork - excellent! Sauce -only decent -not even remotely special Ribs- Tender and delish. Mac and cheese- Good flavor and textureSmall portions-very expensive Pros: Exceptionally great food, awesome place (for dates as well) Cons: inept kitchen & service If this rating was based on food alone, it would easily be 5/5.

Dino Bbq has been on my roommates hot list for a long time,so it was only a matter of time until I tried it. ?We went up to Harlem with a bunch of friends to give it a shot. The wings were very good. ?Three flavors to try and I liked them each. ?Also had deviled eggs and fried green tomatoes which were both excellent. ?The appetizers were superb. ?I love deviled eggs, I could have eaten ten. ? My friend and I ordered a full rack of ribs, which were ok. ?The meat didn't fall off the bone. ?By the time I had 2 or 3,I was full and stopped eating. ?Though, if they were more tender I might have had more. The service was outstanding I thought. ?We were a group of nine and our waitress was friendly throughout. ?Although one of the servers did spell a vodka soda all over me and shouted "AHHHH, SHIT" so that was funny, I didn't even mind as those things are always accidents and happen. ?To be clear, I wasn't drinking the vodka soda. ?I had a flight of beers which I thought was a cool thing to offer. ? This place is good, though would I go all the way up to Harlem again? Probably not. ?Its not the best bbq i've had. ?That distinction belongs to Fette Sau in Brooklyn.

I've always enjoyed BBQ (honestly, who doesn't enjoy large slabs of meat), but realized that I never had experienced truly top-notch BBQ until my first visit to Dinosaur (sorry Brother Jimmys...). Everything we had was cooked to perfection - fried green tomatoes were amazing, as were the chicken wings, deviled eggs and entrees we got. Most of us ordered the ribs, which were truly the best option. The meat was so tasty, and fell off of the bone while eating it. It was actually comical looking around the table, and seeing bones without a gram of meat on them because of how meticulously they'd been consumed. The one thing we weren't a fan of were the Korean BBQ ribs - tasted about the same as other places, and not nearly as good as the featured ones. Beer selection is great too, and our server was very friendly. Wish it was closer!

Skated on over after rollerblading from Midtown to here (GREAT bike paths, people!) and got seated right away. ?This place is packed and always hoppin'. ?It's got a good home-y feel to it too, despite its grand size. Got the standard plate, and my boo was impressed that they use real wood (a lot of posers out there don't). ?He's from Texas, so his standards are pretty high. ?It was good, solid food for a decent price. ?I also saw how their cocktails list wasn't outlandish-another plus for me! ?I'd come back after rolling along the bike path again.

If there are better ribs in NY I want to know where. This place not only knows how to do BBQ right but it will spoil you for every other joint in the city. It's just not fair to those other places. Dinosaur is the arsenal of ribs. I've eaten here maybe 8 or 9 times and I'll keep going back till I get it right and if I can't get it Right then I'll have to deal with my mistakes. There's also a real bar with a good selection of brews as well. Everything on the menu is excellent so just pick something. I've been coming here since '04 and have recommended it to locals and tourists alike. And don't worry about it being too far up town. It's a breeze to get to by subway or bus. Finally, the prices are very reasonable. Burp!

I am from Texas and am constantly on the search for good BBQ. Although Dinosaur BBQ isn't the best I've had, it is certainly on the Top for NY BBQ places. I highly suggest the appetizers, the wings are to die for, and I also loved the deviled eggs. I also ordered the brisket and some corn bread. The corn bread isn't in the southern style that I was hoping for. The brisket was alright, could have used a bit more fat for my taste, but I think the lean style is more the way they do BBQ in the north (from my experience). Ask for the burnt ends if they have them, they are worth it.

I've been meaning to get to Dinosaur for sometime now, and finally did today for lunch. Here's how it went. First of all, note that they have a new menu as of this week, but it's only slightly different than the old one. I started with the SOLO SWAG, which is an appitizer sampler for one. (It comes larger.) $5.95 got me: 4 shrimp - OK, but boring 1 green tomato - very good 1 deviled egg - very good 1 wing - (actually a leg). Excellent, BUT it was a little too close to being underdone to suit me. At the thickest part, it was slightly pink. Chicken can be a little tricky. Overdone and it's dried out; underdone and you die. ? Next, the TRES HOMBRE bbq sampler, $18.95. It consisted of 4 items plus two very small sides: Pulled Pork - boring. Most of the flavor came from the drizzle of bbq sauce they'd topped it with. Brisket - 2 slices lean, 2 deckle. Not very good. Hill Country & others have far better. One lean slice was tough enough that I left it behind. ? 4 Ribs - meh. Nice smoke flavor, but have had better lots of places. They were reasonably tender, but not falling off the bone. Frankly, my local hole in the wall Chinese does ribs just as good at half the price, though obviously a different flavor. ? Beans - about 3 Tablespoons. Nothing to write home about. Maybe someone's had burnt ends, but mine didn't. ? New Potatoes (3) in garlic butter. These seem to have replaced the Syracuse Salt potatoes. OK, but badly underseasoned. ? With one soda, & tax & tip, it totalled out at $35.00 - not a cheap lunch! The best thing Dinosaur had was the wait staff. They were VERY pleasant and attentive. Perhaps the best thing was they didn't seem to care who's "table" you were at. Ask anyone & it was taken care of. I didn't try the chicken, but if the wings are any indicator, it's probably very, very good. Actually, I wish I'd had that and a plate of eggs. Would have cut my bill in half as well. Dinosaur is a real pain for me to get to. Add in the mediocre food, and I don't see myself going back. A recent review mentions that Dinosaur has changed hands. Perhaps that's the reason for far better reviews a couple of years ago.

There are good and bad things about Dinosaur. Good - ?BBQ is excellent. ?That is pretty much a well known opinion of everyone that goes here. ?Can't really argue that. ? The beer selection is great. ?The little outdoor patio area is nice when you want to chill outside. Bad - Not a fan of the way this place is set up. ?I fell like I'm walking into a freaking Applebees. ?The place is just huge and seems very corporate to me. ?No mom and pop feel at all. ?But that's just my stupid ass. ?I like smaller places. ?It's really the only thing that keeps me away.

ummmmm talk about BBQ! Why is there food SO AMAZING & SEASONED!!! This is my first time visiting! and I enjoyed every bit of it! Garlic Hot Wings: perfect with an after-taste spicy kick! you might need some water. Peeled Spicy Boiled Shrimp [hot]- soaked in butter and spices! i ate all 12 thats 1/4....umm yea it was too good to resist. it can get alittle mess but who cares Salt Potatoes: boiled in salt water and added in some butter!! those potatoes can cause an heart-attack! but great as a side dish. Sweet potatoes: Sweet and seasoned enough said. My friends both got pulled pork sandwiches or chicken meal which was great as well. Our party was very pleased with our meal choices. I wasn't in the mood for liquor [first time ever] i got half/half -lemonade/sweet ice tea.! umm i had about 5 glasses $1.00 re-fill each! it was the PERFECT ICE COLD DRINK!! ? Their corn-bread is soo JIFFFYY, fresh and sweet. Its wayyy better than Dallas BBQS cornbread (-___-) Our waiter was very cool and attentive! Luke Duke was his name. Next time, ill try the fried green tomatoes. if you are on a "budget and still want to eat good, Dinosaur is the place to be.

Good points: (1) Big portions. (2) Many different house BBQ sauces to choose from. (3) Food place for big groups and they have an awesome live music line-up. We went on a Thursday and the band was doing their own spin on different genres of music. The music made my night. (4) Attentive, fun waiters. We went late-ish, around 10pm, and the place was winding down. Saw waiters having fun and dancing to the music while still being super attentive. It's a place that makes you want to have a huge party with everyone! (5) Ribs were a bit dried, but maybe it's because we went late? I'm willing to give this place another chance. (6) Good Texan food! Especially the cream corn! You can skip the cornbread though...

Like others, I wanted to love this place but thought it was just okay. ?The brisket was very good, the ribs... well I've had better at much less highly reviewed places. ?Service was very slow for us... but that may not be typical. ?They did make up for it with an unexpected free birthday dessert -- probably the best cupcake I have ever eaten in my life. ?Totally worth breaking my gluten free diet for. ?Come to think of it... dessert may have been the best thing I ate all night, which is kinda odd considering how well reviewed Dino is. ?I'll probably give it another try... but at least this first visit, it definitely did not make it onto my top list of top 5 bbq joints.

Dinosaur BBQ helped to kick off the boom that is now the Harlem meat packing district. The food here is descent, nothing to scream home about but it's good for a night of sticky fingers. I LOVE their boiled shrimp and their deviled eggs. And I really don't eat everyones deviled eggs but there was pretty good. It's a good place to do an evening with friends and drinks.

This place has total sentimental value to me, which is why it's getting 5 stars. ?Sure, the food's great, and the beer is awesome, but realistically it's a 4 star joint. ?That said, it's probably one of the best places to get BBQ in the city. ?Their sauce is AWESOME, and their pork is totally up to task. ?The ribs are delicious, nice and tender on the inside, while satisfyingly crisp on the outside. ?Get the Syracuse Salt Potatoes as a side: while I've been told many, many times by angry Syracuse-ians that these aren't "true salt potatoes" (I've never actually gotten an answer to what a REAL salt potato actually is, come to think of it), they're fucking delicious. ? Definitely get reservations: you could end up waiting quite a long time on a busy night. ?It's a bit out of the way for me, but it's always worth the trip. ?And hey, you're already on the 1. ?Head down to Rudy's when you're finished, kay?

OK, here's the trick, people... do not eat in the restaurant. ?Aside from the interminable wait, it's loud and crowded. ?Instead, go when the weather's nice and order from the take out counter and sit on the picnic tables outside. ?A waitress will take your drink order and you get all their BBQ sauces to choose from. ?I'll admit it's weird sitting next to a Fairway parking lot under a bridge, but hey... that's BBQ! I went to the Syracuse Dinosaurs this summer and it was actually better than this location, but unless you have a car and 8 hours to spare, this is your best bet for BBQ in the city.

So I finally tried out this spot after walking out countless times because of the long wait! There is ALWAYS and I repeat ALWAYS! a long wait to eat in. I came here one Friday during lent (bad idea since I don't eat meat Fridays) so I had everything shrimp. They had three dishes with shrimp and....I had all three! I don't even remember what they were though -_- ?But they tasted like heaven! The second and last time I came here I had their deviled eggs (to die for!) the wings were so good! the meat came right off the bone, it was like effortless chewing. they were huge! and their chili is slamming!! its so cheap too! this place makes for a good cheap date! if you dont mind watching her suck the BBQ sauce off her fingers that is. Its that good! Oh and they also have beer on tap which is always a plus for me!

Of the BBQ places I've been to in the city, it's easily better than RUB and Blue Smoke and more exciting atmosphere-wise than Daisy Mays. The location is not ideal, but I like that I didn't have to sit elbow-to-elbow with people, like in many Manhattan restaurants. I went with 5 other people and we sat at a table for 8, so there was more than enough room for the food and beer pitchers. I like that Dino had a large and interesting beer selection, which is almost always a plus for me but maybe even more so for BBQ. We ordered the family meal so I got a chance to taste most of the meats and I think four of the sides. ?I enjoyed most of the sides but the beans were my favorite. As for the meats, I was most interested in the ribs but I have to say they were good but not great. ?I'd still come back and maybe try some of the other things on the menu. All in all, I had a good time.

I knew Dinosaur BBQ from their restaurant in Rochester NY, which has the same tasty ribs, but is not as overpacked as its NY counterpart. There is often a 1h wait to get seated, so I often take the ribs to go. They have the "sweatheart deal" : a full rack of delicious ribs (the best I had so far in the US) and sides that could feed 3 to 4 people for less than 40$. The place is very noisy, but a good vibe to it.

And in conclusion... I have no idea how people are giving Dinosaur BBQ 2 and 3 stars. ?Most of the 3 star reviews actually have nothing bad to say about the place. ?Common sense would say that if you have nothing bad to say, except maybe "the place is hard to find" it means that your comprehension of directions or your GPS should get 3 stars, not the restaurant. ?But I shall digress on the stupidity of mankind. As for Dinosaur BBQ, I have been there at least 50 times, about once a weekend for the last year or so. ?It is not the best bbq I have ever had, but if I rated every place based on whether it was the best at whatever it does, I would have very few 5 star reviews. There are a few things to remember about Dinosaur BBQ: 1. Do NOT expect to get a table on friday or saturday night at 7pm without at least an hour wait. ?Most of the time the wait for weekend dinner is 1-3 hours. 2. If you get take-out on a busy night....guess what....you will not be out in 20 minutes. ?On 3 hour table wait nights, it WILL be 45 mins to 1 hour for take out. 3. On weekends, a good time to go is 1pm. 4. If you are getting take-out, go over to Fairway and do a little grocery shopping while waiting for your order. ?That way you aren't frowny facing the place up while waiting. ?No one likes to see frowny faces. 5. There are a few of those "upscale" ghettoids up in Dinosaur bbq. ?The type that have a Chrysler 300 with big chrome rims yo and actually think they are driving a Bentley just because their $20k piece of junk kind of looks like one. ?"It's my world yo!" Some great things about Dinosaur BBQ: 1. Salmon fritters 2. Deviled Eggs (Just like moms used to make them) 3. Turkey Burger platter with 2 sides for ~$12... Can't beat that. 4. THE HOUSE DRESSING... Again, Dinosaur BBQ can be expensive if you order a bunch of appetizers and a rack of ribs, but as I said before, there are plenty of sandwich platters that are great that will cost you less than $15.

I went in here expecting the best, and while parts of the experience were good, overall I have to give it a 3. Knew we would have to wait an hour or so to sit down, so we managed to grab a couple of seats at the bar to cool off with beers. The beer selection was great, but the service? I've never met a more unfriendly, un-service-oriented bartendress in my whole life. It was almost as if she was going out of her way to try to be unhelpful. Would it be so hard to tell me which beer is which in the flight I ordered? Or to say more than "I don't know" when I asked? Is it against the rules to ask if I would like another beer, instead of sweeping my empty glass away without so much as a glance in my direction? Is it so hard to say "thank-you" when receiving payment that included a tip? And the salmon fritters that we had with the beers? Good taste, but by the time our favorite beer-puller slammed them onto the bar in front of us, it looked like they had been thrown up in the air and caught back on the same plate. And certainly not worth $7 for three two-bite fritters. So we waited to be called and finally sat down after an hour. Surprised to see quite a few empty tables around us when there was a line almost out the door. Don't mind waiting for a table, but being made to wait when there is plenty of room is annoying. It also took ANOTHER hour after ordering to be served. On to the food: my bride had the Churrasco Chicken Steak (with corn bread, collards and salt potatoes), I ordered the Ode To Elgin -- 1/4 rack ribs, brisket and a hot link (with corn bread, mac and cheese, BB fried rice). We also had an extra side: BBQ beans. She enjoyed the chicken, although I tried a piece and found it very dry -- but I always find chicken breast dry. No points off there. She found the collards a little off and enjoyed the salt potatoes immensely. As to the BBQ: I was disappointed. When I smoke brisket I use low heat, good wood, and lots of time. I end up with delicious smoky flavor and a smoke ring that permeates the meat. I found neither here. There was almost no smoke flavor and no ring. It wasn't bad brisket -- but it wasn't BBQ. The ribs had better color and flavor, but they could have benefited from another couple of hours in the BBQ as well. As served, there was still a large amount of fat that would have melted away, and the meat would have pulled away from the bone better. The hot link was good -- but it's pretty hard to mess that up. My sides were all excellent: best part of the meal. All in all, I walked in wanting to love this place. I walked out disappointed.

For Manhattanites, trekking up to far west 131st is a bit of a haul. There is usually a wait, so we just had a few beers. However, expect half an hour to an hour wait.... However, if you are in the neighborhood, this place offers delicious BBQ. Huge comfort food sides, gooey, yummy sauce dripping ribs and chicken delighted us. ?The country western style interior was hip and fun. Service was pretty good.

As we approached the restaurant the aroma of BBQ sauce was heavy in the air. We all quickly got very excited. What I didn't know before we got there was that you can make reservations, I will do this next time. We waited probably an hour but it wasn't bad since we got seats at the bar and they had like 40 beers available. The guys even ordered flights of 4 different beer samples. We finally were seated and right away noticed the different sauce options on the table. The "Sensuous" sauce was a huge hit. We ordered a full rack of baby back ribs, korean style beef ribs, and pulled pork. We also got sides: mac & cheese, baked beans, fries, cole slaw, fried rice, salt potatoes, and corn bread. The majority winner was the korean beef ribs. They had a great flavor very similar to the best bbq I have had in Korea town. I also really enjoyed the regular ribs a lot. The mac & cheese was absolutely amazing. The cheese was thick, rich, and creamy. I would highly suggest this side to complement your meal. We were all STUFFED after dinner. Funny enough, the waiter hands us a dessert menu and we ask, "Does anyone actually have room for dessert?" He said about 1-2% order it! BeHappyNYC! http://www.behappynyc.com

Cheers to my cousin @Mark for showing me this place. All restaurants in Manhattan have to pay rent, like anybody else does. Therefore, being situated in a less than convenient by public transit location will yield lower rent, as the astute owners of Dinosaur have discovered. The cheaper rent translates into cheaper food, and voila, a dark, gritty, and delicious BBQ place was born. Dinosaur is well worth the trip west from the 125th (1 train) station. My cousin and I typically order the Tres Hombres meal and a side of wings. This dish features a combination of beef and pork ribs. And you get the choice of several of the delicious Dinosaur side dishes. I highly recommend the salted potatoes, mac 'n cheese, and collard greens. If you want to try spicy, go for the Wango Tango hot sauce. It will knock your socks off, and neither water nor milk will be able to cure your lips (my cousin eats them with a fork and knife). Aside from the pleasant (if not bacchanalian) ambiance, the beer prices are fair, and the Tres Hombres is about $19 and will feed (and stuff) two hungry young guys. Order some wings, and some good ole Bud Lights, and you'll leave the place around $45. Ahhh brings me back to the South, where I'm from (well Southern California, anyways)

it's ok. I can see myself going there for the pulled pork burger. everything else is just what I've tasted everywhere, except for the long wait. the staff is good to you once they seat you. Hostesses were nice, though they could not do anything for my party, who had to wait two hours due to the original reservation list closing up and we had to do a walk in reservation. We did end up finding out that they have a walk-in service seating near the bar. You see open space at the table and you plop down to get service. The day my party went there happened to be the date of the owner's bday. I wonder if that had anything to do with why it was so overcrowded. If I go back there again, I'm going for the margaritas, appetizers, and to watch the live bands that come in to play at nite.

Maybe they are a victim of their own success. ?My last two visits have been so-so. ?I give the staff good marks, the atmosphere good marks (appropriate for a BBQ joint) but the food...not so much. My chicken was way undercooked. ?I know BBQ leaves a pink smoke ring, and you aren't supposed to serve some dried out beat up bird, but the food needed much more time in the heat. ?The bones were still bleeding in the thigh joint. My ribs still have the tough membrane on the bone side. ?I think quality BBQ'ers care enough to clean and trim the meat correctly. ?They also were just OK for flavor. ?I think the Brisket is good. ?My friend had the Cuban Sandwich...the fact that they have such a thing on the menu make me consider Dinosaur more like TGI Friday's ?than a BBQ joint. The beer selection is good. ?Maybe fun for a party...but no more for me.

BEST BBQ on the island. It's so good... worth the extra buck or two. Dinosaur BBQ is only a short, Westerly walk from the 1 train at 125th. Packed for dinner and after-dinner most nights, but a brilliant selection of brews (on tap/in bottles) makes this place an excellent weekend lunch option- it will cure any hangover or get one started. Work up an appetite or work off the calories on the beautiful greenway path, only a few yards east of the restaurant. The best sides to your Memphis Style Sandwich: Mac and Cheese, salt potatoes(not gross like they sound), fries, or sweet potatoes.

Dinosaur BBQ has so many reviews already, I almost don't feel like adding my drop to the bucket. ?I'm mainly doing this as a dissenting vote - I felt a little misled by the rave reviews and the hype. I'm a huge barbecue fan; I grew up in Texas and worked my way through college at one of the better 'cue establishments in Austin. ?And while this doesn't make me any more qualified to judge the quality of barbecue than any other meat-eater, I throw it out there to show I'm not clueless when it comes to ribs and brisket. ?So here's my take: The wings - I don't understand the raves. ?They were decent, but no better than at a a good chicken wing place. ?I'm also prejudiced against them, since they aren't a core bbq staple in my mind. The brisket - only lean? ?Did I miss the moist/deckle/point/whatever you want to call it? ?The fat is where all the flavor is, and the slices I got were dry and fairly bland. ?I didn't taste any smokiness. The ribs - big disappointment. ?They did fall off the bone, but only because the meat was dry and pulling away. ?The flavor was okay (but not great), but I was really looking forward to these since I had been led to believe they are the crown jewel of Dinosaurs' offerings. ?The main bbq sauce they offer on the side helped, though - I think they have one of the better sauces in the city (but why is it so smoky, yet their meat isn't? ?Do they add Liquid Smoke?). As a side note, however, I loved the restaurant itself - the service was excellent, and the bar was great. ?I just wish the food had stacked up.

Damn this place is good... Busy as hell, so if u don't have a reservation be prepared to wait no matter the time of your visit. I've had the pleasure of dining on multiple occasions, let me tell you the food and beer selection are top notch. The wings, while not puritan buffalo wings, are amazing! Ribs are great, brisket and pulled pork are as well. As for the sides... The whipped sweet potatoes with candied pistachios are kick ass.. Mac n cheez is fair.. The rest is not all too memorable... The service is hurried as this place is a mad house!! Food arrives haphazardly... Order your drinks while you are still half full with the one you are nursing.. Or you WILL go dry... Great beer menu, even by this beer snobs standards... And you can't beat a $6 pint of dogfish heads 90 minute IPA!!! I love this place and will keep on coming back for more.

I had the pleasure of devouring a moist pulled pork sandwich at Dino. Coupled with the mac and cheese sides, you have a platter full of win. And the atmosphere is well enough gritty (especially the men's bathroom) but in a strange way, adds to the charm of this no-nonsense BBQ place. The prices are fair, considering the quality of the meat. Service is also fair, although the second time I went, the waiter overlooked our table. ?Still, this place is worth my long subway trip.

Git yer grill on! Hands down best BBQ I've had in NYC (and I've tried quite a few). There is a few valid point in other reviews that's worth repeating: long waits (even with a reservation) so be prepared! The good news is that the long waits are justified because all those people are piled up waiting to rip into some meat with a side of mac, fried, potatoes and beans. The cornbread is also pretty damn good and the beer list has something for almost everyone. If you like grillin', this is the place to go. Get there hungry and make sure you leave time afterwards to walk a few blocks to help settle all that food down.

Heard good things about Dino BBQ and after a day at the AMNH looking at dinosaur bones we figured to go get some grub at Dinosaur BBQ. We started with an order of Fried Green Tomatoes (first time having them ever) and really liked them, both with and without the dipping sauce that comes with it. I ordered the "Ode to Elgin" which came with a quarter rack of ribs, beef brisket, & sausage. My sides were the mac & cheese and greens. The star of the platter was the sausage, but the ribs and brisket weren't bad as a second fiddle. Any good BBQ joint should make you want to lick your fingers and Dino BBQ does just that. And like a tennis player is only as good as his or her second serve, the sides you get should work well and compliment the smoked meats your eating. The sides at Dino BBQ play that role as well. The wifey order the House Special Chicken and Ribs, and confirmed that she would want to come back. The kiddo had the Kids Platter with BBQ Chicken, mac & cheese, and fries. If you're in the area, check out Dino BBQ, and by the area I mean NYC and the tri-state area. Make a reservation ahead of time. The wait wasn't long, but they do hold your reservation and get you your seat at the time you've reserved.

Dinosaur BBQ. Great place to eat. The price is very resonalbe and the portions are more than generous. Though its in Harlem - no biggie. The area is fully renovated and you will never know its harlem. The location of Dino - is on the west side on 125 and sits almost on the edge of the houtson. The staff are super friendly and even with a party of 10 - the service rocked and we all had a great time. Will return.

I am going to do my best to keep this short as i could talk about how much I love this place for hours! The wings here are hands down the best in the city..they are smoked and not deep fried and the sauces are to die for...and when they say HOT, they actually mean it! Devil's Duo, hottest you can get, still manages to taste amazing while being one of the hottest wings I've ever had (and I have tried them all) The value is great...my bottled Labatt's only ?4 bucks and meals rarely above 15. The sides are just as good as the smoked wings...my favs being the mac n cheese and carrot and raisin salad. The fried green tomatoes and creole deviled egg apps are always a hit. The only downside? The wait. Although the move across the street into a bigger space has helped, plan to wait for a bit, fight for a bar seat, or take it to go....no matter what day ?you are there. And yes, for a reservation on the weekend, call two weeks in advance. ?And sometimes, not often, but sometimes the service can be a bit slow...hence the 4 out of 5 star rating. Try to sit at the bar for the best service. ? Be patient...The food is well worth any wait! ? PS...so much for keeping it short! LOL

Best barbecue I've ever had in my entire life. I remember my days when I was in college up in Syracuse, and the only vivid memory I remember was creaming my pants everytime I took a bite off that pulled pork... Oh yeah, baby... And oh yeah, the rest of my college years were a blur. Anyway yes, waiting is absurd, but plan in advance: come when you know you're gonna be starving in an hour or so. Or make a reservation? D'uh? You know it's pretty serious when people start coming from all over the five borough to Harlem just to eat ribs. IT IS JUST SO DAMN GOOD!

Wow... definitely coming back for more. Came here last night with my fellow we-love-to-eat-bad friend and we were not disappointed! We had a reservation, glad of it since there were a bunch of people waiting, even on a Monday night. Were seated within 10 minutes. Fantastic waiter - very friendly and attentive and kept refilling our drinks. Yes, Dinosaur BBQ is one of those rare wonders in NYC... a restaurant with free refills (GASP). And we took full advantage of that... I think my friend chugged down four refills. Appetizer - we got the sampler: deviled eggs (wow!), fried green tomatoes (I hate tomatoes, but these were lovely), chicken wings (omg), and spicy boiled shrimp. Hell, even the shrimp was fantastic and my friend and I both thought we hated shrimp. We manhandled that leggy carcass and gave it a try. Actually, it was still pretty disgusting, but thats just because crustacean freaks me out. For dinner I got the half rack of ribs with mac and cheese and fries. The cornbread was good (but... I think I actually prefer Dallas BBQ cornbread... eep!), and the mac and cheese WAS AMAZING. The fries were just fries, but they were pretty good too. The ribs were absolutely covered in delicious meat, and the BBQ sauce was slather-worthy. Yum yum yum. Yum. I ate everything. Except a few fries. I'm still stuffed and its lunchtime of the following day. Man! I'd love to come back on a weekend, even though it'll be hellish crowded, want to hear the live music! Great decor, great fun, great food. wanna get it all! Yesssssss....

This Place is amazingly disgusting. You need to be in the mood for down south home style cookin' and getting dirty. In truth the pulled pork is delish' as well as the fried green tomato's. This spot is very casual but ideal for beers and a large group... the only downfall is the trek up to Harlem.

I'm a graduate of SU. ?I have frequented the original Dinosaur in the 'Cuse. ?And I like the NYC establishment better. I do not miss the bikers, the absurdly cramped bar-turned-restaurant, or the overflow side picnic dining area of the Syracuse Dinosaur. ?This NYC establishment is spacious, larger, and it feels like a real restaurant. ?All that's missing is more obscene scrawlings on the walls. One thing that did carry over from Syracuse are the prices. ?Pulled pork sandwhich and two sides, $9! ?And speaking of pulled pork! ?The sauce is impeccible, and they keep extra bottles right on the table so you can load the thing up (hot/garlic varieties, as well!). ?And how do you want that sandwhich? ?Memphis style (w/coleslaw on it)? ?Cuban (w/ ham, pressed?) ?Or just a heeping pile of the good stuff? And don't even get me started on the ribs. This place was destined to get five stars as soon as I was told that I would have to wait an hour for a table for two. ?In the meantime, I ordered a beer so that I could make an ill-fated attempt to quench my thirst. ?The poison was Yuengling. ?For some reason, the rest of Manhattan considers Yuengling a premium beveage, charging import prices. ?Unreal. ?You know, anywhere else in the northeast, Yuengling is hardly above Bud/Bud Light. But Dinosaur keeps it real. ?I laid down a $10. ?I got $6 back. ?Shazamm! Ecclectic crowd. ?If you were wondering where the UWS actually met Harlem, it's not a blur extending through the low hundreds...it's a pinpoint location, specifically the Dinosaur on 131st. ?Take your daughter's 3rd grade class here for a lesson on the American melting pot. ?And some ribs. ?Any maybe Yuengling.

I've been coming to Dinosaur for a few years now. A few blocks from the 1 train on 125th (walk past the historic Cotton Club on your way over!), or exit the West Side Highway at 125th and you're there. Parking can be a pain, but its WORTH it. If you want your BBQ on a Friday/Saturday/Sunday - make reservations - far in advance!! M-T-W-TH should be manageable for walk-ins. The new space is a GREAT upgrade to the prior place across the street (Did Colombia buy that too?!) The bar now has a much more manageable space, and they have an impressive beer list. So even if you do have to wait, you can drink (...and drink.) The peel n' eat shrimp are a great way to start. I'm always obscenely sucking the flavor off my fingers while eating them. I always get the appetizer sampler plate, and all the apps are on point. Love the fried green tomatoes and the wings. The BBQ - its just good. I'm a sucker for ribs, and they don't disappoint. The corn bread is heavenly, and the brisket is rockin. But here is my thought - I dream about the food here at night, and I feel pangs of regret when I drive past 125th and I can smell the smokey goodness surrounding the West Side Highway. Yet there are naysayers who vehemently claim that this is NOT real BBQ, that Texas and St Louis and blah blah blah have better BBQ, and this pales in comparison. So...are they just being obnoxious foodies? Or are they right? And if they are correct, and I love Dinosaur BBQ, what will the "real" BBQ do to me!? I quiver at the thought... Regardless, Dinosaur hits the spot for me.

Finger lickin good, everybody goes here for bbq but be patient because there will be a considerable wait time. The fried green tomatoes will make you want to kidnap the recipe.

One of the best BBQ places in the city (not the best, but one of the best). I became familiar with Dino BBQ in Rochester (their 2nd location after opening in Syracuse), they are extremely consistent between their locations in terms of decor and food quality. I've gotten all their meats and can give you a breakdown: Pulled Pork-Fantastic (but it's hard to make a bad one so not surprised) Chicken-Perfect crust of seasoning and wonderfully tender Brisket- Slightly dry, nothing impressive (but I'm not really a brisket fan to begin with) Ribs- A bit fatty, tender but not falling off the bone, I'm not sure what causes this but last time I had ribs here I had a few bones break in half on me. Their sides are hit or miss. The cornbread is sponge-like and tasteless and the beans have too much sugary filler and not enough beans or smokiness. The mac and cheese is fantastic though. The service is also hit or miss, I've had pretty good and pretty inattentive service here. Last time I had a waitress bring me a beer that was barely cold, never check on us, and take 15min or so to bring us water. But the place is basically solid with pretty good food, definitely in the top 3 or 4 BBQ places in the city.

Dinosaur BBQ marks as one of these places with which I believe every Yelper and non-Yelper out there needs to visit. ?After a long hike from Columbus Circle, a table for 4 was 1.5 hours wait. ?However if you hover about the outside dining area in front of the restaurant, you can score a table pretty quickly. One of the best BBQ joints I've ever been to. ?The family meal was the way to go and each of us even took home doggie bags. ?Everything we had was spot on delicious - except the corn bread which was a bit dense. ?Their version of BBQ sauce on the table is amazing.

It's clear that they have a shaker in the kitchen of "Dinosaur BBQ Rub" that is liberally splashed on everything. That's a lot of rub. A lot of the same sweet-spicy-saltiness lingering after each bite just in case you forget what your catfish-pork-potatoes-mac&cheese taste like. Which you won't as everything tastes kinda the same. I thought it was all good, but would have liked it more if I had only ordered one thing and walked away liking that sweet-spicy-saltiness instead of just being sick of it. http://Harlemtogo.com delivers from Dinosaur BBQ, and when the food arrives it's at least warm if not hot. Catfish, 3 stars Coleslaw, 3.5 stars (a vinegar heavy mayo made this.) Potatoes, too salty and fake buttery, 2.5 stars Cornbread, sahara dry, 2 stars Mac & Cheese, fake cheesy but a nice crispy crust, 3 stars

Dinosaur is an addiction. ?Well, more accurately, I am addicted to their pulled pork and my wife is addicted to their mac and cheese. ?The pork is just right, nice and savory, while the mac and cheese is interesting: it's cheesy and a bit spicy hot (well for a wimp like me). ?The cornbread and chicken are a average, but the pork products are key. Getting in is rough - definitely make a reservation. ?We actually prefer to get take out, and the family deluxe platter can please everyone for a good amount of $. ?Nothing like fighting off people on the uptown 1 who can smell the BBQ in your bag. ?Worth the trip.

It's my birthday weekend, yall! ?March 7th - ALL DAY LONG :) I decided to spend an evening eating more than my belly can stretch at DinosaursBarbecue in Harlem! Off 131street and 12th Avenue... The wait was ridiculous. It took about 1 hour and 15 minutes before we could be seated at the table. It's better to make reservations for the weekend at least 1 week in advance, but of course they do take walk-ins...Once we were seated it was a great table in the corner. I could stash all my presents and ballons there.. *We ordered the deviled eggs *Honey chicken wings with Blu cheese The Sweetheart Deal: We shared the Full Rack, YUMMY! **with four sides - mac n cheese, creole potato salad, barbacue baked beans, and simmering collard greens. All the sides were tasty with one little exception the the baked beans were a little over cooked and not tangy enough for me. For drinks: My best buddy ordered the wine and me a Mojito - very nice! My friend brought me a cake! So they were so nice enough to put candles on it! It was really special. I shared the cake with the folks sitting next to me!!!! YEAH! I don't need a swanky restaruant to know that I feel LOVED! Next year - it's BUDDKHAN or BUST! I can go from country girl to classy girl in a NY minute! I had a great time!

This is a place that someone would rave about cause it's in some secret area in Harlem. Hidden trendiness by association. ?The ambiance is fun and lively with a semi Texas theme. ?The serving staff was great, to the point where even when it was crowded; we were served by two staff members working as a team. ?The food came in quick and looked great (even has the home style feeling, with the partitioned plates)! ? But that might be where it ends. ?The Angus steak burger, though tasty wasn't something to write home about. ?I do agree that the cornbread wasn't that moist. ?It's much better at Maroons (you even get it automatically as an appetizer). ?They definitely need hotter sauces.

This is hands down my favorite Bar-B-Que joint in the city! ? From the moment you walk through the shack style doors you are instantly transported out of Manhattan to the nether regions of some back woods in an unidentifiable southern state. ?Which is perfect because there is practically no way you can leave without a good slathering of sauce on your shirt or pants, and let's face it, that is truly un-Manhattan chic. ?This being said, I am not a ribs fan myself, but here the meat packed ribs fall of the bone in with smokey delight. ?A must have item. ?I suggest going with one of the combos in order to get a real taste of all they have to offer. ?The portions are mighty and the experience unforgettable... not to mention that the price is very reasonable. Not to be missed are the wonderful side dishes. ?This is where most bar-b-que joints tend to fall short. ?I have tried almost all of the sides and have been impressed by all. ?Homemade macaroni with a seasoned crust, collard greens, salt potatoes... to die for. ?Oh, did I mention an extensive draft beer menu?? It's located under Riverside Drive which lends to its charm and biker chic atmosphere, though it makes it a bit inaccessible for those not living in the hood. ?I have never been when there wasn't a wait for lunch or dinner, so if possible make reservations. ?It is definitely a hoppin' joint. ?Also, they have live music in the bar on the weekends.

I would say by far this is the best BBQ place in Manhattan. I just moved to NYC 3 months ago and I have been on a mission to try out all the BBQ places. Dinosaur so far has the best ribs, food, service, and atmosphere. ? ? ?I came on a saturday at 1pm with a gorup of 3. The hostess quoted 35 mins but we were able to find a table near the bar which was open seating. It was the best idea. They had an amazing selection of draft beer and a full bar. That was already a big PLUS. ? ? ?We started off with the fried green tomatoes which was recommendation by the yelp family. I have never had it before and surprisingly it was delicious. It's worth a try. I opted for the Tres Hombres which consisted of pulled pork, beef brisket, and 1/4 rack of ribs which is the best combo ever. I love those 3 different variations of BBQ and it was perfect. I highly recommend it. ? ? Dinosaur is a wonderful place I would highly recommend. The only pitfall is that the location is a bit far. I live in the East Village and it does take some time.

The sample platter for one comes with one deviled egg, one wing, one fried green tomato sprinkled with sharp grated cheese and a couple of cold seasoned shrimp with shell that you have to peel. ?Everything on this platter is pretty amazing and a great starter to your meal. ?I especially enjoyed the wing (chipotle garlic sauce) and the fried green tomato. The wings are mouthwatering good. ? You will probably wonder why anyone would order a salad at a BBQ joint but the ICEBERGE WEDGE is a must whenever I come here. ?The lettuce is refreshingly crisp, the bacon is crisp, the candied pecans are sweet and crunchy and complement each other just right. ?The halved cherry tomatoes pop in your mouth and to top it off the creamy dressing available to choice from will make up for the HEALTHY portion of the salad but still a good balance to all the MEAT you will be eating. The salty potatoes side comes drenched in this WONDERFULY buttery sauce, it is simply amazing. I ordered the catfish and it was mediocre at best, but I guess that's what I get for getting seafood here. ? ?From what I remember from last year, the ribs are off of the bone good. ?I can honestly say it's one of the best ribs I've had. ?Brother Jimmy's and Hill Country has nothing on this place. The location might seem far off but I usually work up an appetite biking up the west side highway. ?They have three bike racks to lock your bike up against so no worries. ? I can't wait to try out the rest of the menu.

I heard a lot of great reviews of this place and so of course I had to try this place out... Gather up a few people to come and trek all the way up to Harlem. Only two people out of our group has tried this place before and L usually orders the brisket. J usually gets the Ode to Elgin. I was curious about the Elgin, but I don't like the fact they pair it with ribs and I don't like ribs. I am not a big meat eater unless it's kobe, hamburger or filet. But J told me it doesn't even taste like Elgin's link, and he should know since his family is out there. K and me, we LOVE fried green tomatoes, so we decided to order that for our appetizer! It was really yummy but I don't really think anyone can mess up fried food, right? I tried a tiny smidgen of S's appetizer, the chicken - eh, too sweet for me and it just wasn't good at all. K and P decided to get the Sweetheart Deal - I know how gay and definitely a humongous order! 4 sides with two cornbread and huge rack of ribs! They loved the ribs and they totally killed the whole rack! I tried a bite...pretty damn good and I don't even care for ribs. I followed L and got the brisket and it's not that good...it was really dry tasting, perhaps I should have gotten the pulled pork. Mac & Cheese was also too dry and not cheesy enough for me to deem it as the best tasting mac & cheese. Cornbread - they definitely need more work on this, it was decent but a damn good cornbread would cause someone like me to want to OD on carbs. Creole Potato Salad - I am glad I got this instead of the fries, since I didn't really care for the fries here and the potato salad was really good and had a nice kick. But the thing that really really would make me come back here again is not their meat but it's their dessert. ME LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE their Seasonal Cobbler! It's so damn good and especially since they topped it with Ice Cream! I tried S's Key Lime Pie - didn't taste like they used Key Lime and L's Peanut Butter Pie was a bit too heavy and rich for my liking. This place was decent, but not for a Texas gal like me. However, I would definitely go back just for the damn Seasonal Cobbler!

Absolutely incredible. ?Quite frankly, a close to perfect BBQ experience, and a true gem in the city. ?Get away from the NY dining scene pretentious attitude and enter a Utopian smoky flavored land. ? As always, I'll apply the same analysis for restaurants of the same genre. ?Sorry Hill Country, but you just got served by a Dinosaur from Harlem. ? DinoBBQ rocks on a) Meat; b) Sides; and c) Drinks & Service. ?Leaving drunk, with a belly full of juicy meat and delicious sides makes this a place worth visiting. ?Multiple times. ? The meat was incredibly tender and needed very little added sauce. ?Why is that so hard to understand for so many NY bbq joints? ?The brisket is incredible and the ribs slip right off into your mouth. ?The sausages were a bit tough, but all in all, an incredible meal. ? The sides. ?Well, I'll have to say that they kick Hill Country's sorry butt. ?The Mac and Cheese is INCREDIBLE. ?Absolutely try them. ?Cole slaw was incredible. ?As appetizers go, DEFINITELY get the fried green tomatoes. ?We ordered a round, and then ordered another. ?That good. ? The drinks and service was exactly what you wanted. ?People who kept the drinks coming, kept them coming fast, and had opinions about the menu. ? I left happy, satisfied, and slightly buzzed from either the great food or the many beers. ? Highly recommended. ?Avoid the tight jeans. ?You. Will. Love. It.

I took my friends for their birthday here a couple of weeks ago and it was EXCELLENT. This is despite the 2+ hour wait for a table. While we waited, we ordered a pitcher of sangria and it was delicious. It was a perfect amount to get four girls nice, buzzed and happy while we waited for a ridiculously long time. The door man (security guard?) was really friendly and told us we could take an outside table whenever it opened up. However, it was rather noisy out so we opted to wait instead. Once we got a table, we quickly ordered a plate of wings and ribs. We also got sides of mac & cheese, fries, and soup. It might have been the buzz from the sangria, but the food was AMAZING. We ate as quickly as humanly possible. I'm sure our table neighbors were amazed at us because we're just four small girls. There was grunting and slurping as we inhaled the wings and ribs which were absolutely worth the wait. And the price. I can't say this was the cheapest place but it was totally worth the money. Make an online reservation if possible!

Hate to jump on this bandwagon, b/c I'm not a fan of bandwagons, but DAMN! I mean AMAZZZING. Three things that you should NOT pass on, the chicken wings, the salt potatoes, and the ribs. The smokiness is just embedded in every bite. This place is packed all the time, so the service is slightly below avg at best, but not snooty or rude, just slightly unattentive, understandably. The habenaro sauce, forggggggggget it. Really top notch beer selection too, lots of options and some rare ones. and CHEAP, for what you get, I saw someone trashing this place and lauding Rack 'n Soul? Yeah, NO, I just had rack and soul this week, not even in the same universe. This is a trillion times better. Def will be back, maybe today!

For my birthday I recently had the chance to try the BBQ at Dinosaur and overall I was pretty impressed. ? PROs: I've tried most of the BBQ in the NYC area and this is definately some of the best. ?Ten years ago it was nearly impossible to find good BBQ in the city, but things have come a long way. ?Yes, you'll still find better (and much cheaper) BBQ in the south, but Dinosaur is pretty darn good. ?I tried the wings, the ribs, brisket, and a steak; the ribs and the wings were favorites. The location is very familiar to me (I lived nearby many years ago, before Dinosaur was there) but it will be a bit out of the way for most. ?It's a short walk from the 1 train stop, and while the area has gotten better over the years it still has a ways to go (Columbia's massive construction project in the area may help things, but that's just getting started). ? The interior of the place feels just about right - clean, not too formal, comfortable, and just a bit loud (in a good way). ?They also had a limitted amount of seating outdoors on the night I was there. ?The crowd is an interesting mix of downtown "visitors" and locals. CONs: On the night I visited the place was packed, and there was a long wait for a table. ?Fortunately (or at least I thought) I was just getting take out. ?I ordered in advance and was told 20-25 minutes. ?I got there 20 minutes later and still waited another 25 minutes. To make things worse, they forget to give me some of the order; fortunately they called 5 minutes later, but that meant looping around in traffic to go back for it. ?The staff wasn't bad but didn't seem to be able to keep up with the rush.

I have eaten here more times than I can conveniently count (although that's counting my visits to the Syracuse location as well but that's not the point) despite the consistent wait for a table even with reservations it never disappoints. I switch the main up a lot and haven't had a bad one from the chicken to the ribs and back (I've even had the fish) but always the same sides .. the potato salad which I would eat huge bowls of if they gave it to me and the cole slaw. The cole slaw is the best I've had and though its a odd choice to judge some places on it seems that most restaurants that offer it give you a nasty tasteless watery cup of cabbage .. not here .. its hearty and well seasoned and delicious. Also I come here for the wings which while spicy aren't quite like buffalo wings. the grilled BBQ wings are so tender and juicy and the sauce is great (speaking of which you can buy it in stores). Also this place turned me onto fried green tomatoes I prefer them with the spicy shrimp remoulade sauce but either way they're delicious. the only issue i ever have with this place is getting a seat.. it takes for ever even if you called ahead, although you can just grab a seat at the bar tables which I have done and its okay but a little too close to your neighbors sometimes. the decor is kitchy but its based on the original in Syracuse which is a real biker bar with real shitty bikers. and I love the old cafeteria style plates! keeps my food from touchin!

This is some of the BEST bbq you'll EVER have! We ordered the hottest wings along with those ranked just beneath them. They were extraordinary! The fried green tomatoes with cayenne buttermilk dressing were great too - don't order just the 3 piece cos you'll want more. I couldn't stop eating their french fries - really flavorful with the perfect crisp. The service was great, the place was packed and it was an all-around terrific experience.

Dinosaur BBQ is some of the best BBQ in NYC. Mac and Cheese is awesome. The fried green tomatoes rock! Wings with the hottest sauce, excellent. Ribs, brisket and pulled pork taste great. The donkey punch will knock you out. Without a reservation on a Friday/Saturday night, you will be waiting 45 min to 1 hour. Go on opentable and make a reservation! Also take public transportation, otherwise you will be circling looking for a parking spot for a while. I highly recommend. Dinosaur is much better than that Dallas BBQ, Bronx BBQ and that other crap out there.

LOL, WHAT? At face value, a 3 and a half hour wait for barbecue in a remote venue may not seem worthy of most people's time. Dinosaur Barbecue proves this wrong. I went here for dinner a few months ago in a group of 10. The upside of going in a large group is that you can try a large variety of dishes on the menu. The tradeoff? We waited from 5 to 8:30 before getting a seat. There's not much to do in the area, so we killed time at the bar with the rest of the Friday night crowd. This was only a minor setback, however. FINALLY, FOOD! For starters, we ordered fried tomatoes and deviled eggs. The tomatoes were of the green variety: sliced, deep-fried, and served with a ranch dressing. The balance was there, but I personally thought the taste was one that grows on you. It was a unanimous vote on the eggs, however - creamy, rich, and dusted off with seasoning. Cocaine is a helluva drug. DRINK AND BE MERRY. The selection of drinks was pretty good. Sixpoint, Syracuse Pale Ale, and cocktails - what's not to like? I had a glass of the Velvet Devil wine, which went pretty well with my entree. Some of the fruity cocktails were served in jars, but I avoided those. AND THE REST WAS HISTORY. I had ordered the traditional sampler, which came with a sliced brisket, 1/4 chicken, and 1/4 rack of ribs. The ribs were somewhat dry, but I suppose the proper way to eat here would be to drench everything in the barbecue sauce. Of course, they were falling-off-the-bone tender. To their credit, the chicken was not too dry or overcooked, and was quite enjoyable. Unfortunately, the brisket was mediocre, but I didn't have my hopes up. Also, watch out for the jalapeno peppers that come with the brisket, those things are unholy. THE REAL STARS OF THE SHOW were the supporting cast. Located at every table are bottles of Dinosaur's barbecue sauce, and Wango Tango sauce, which is the habanero version. I know folks who go out of their way to get this stuff. For my side dishes, I chose the fried rice, and BBQ beans. This was the best fried rice dishes I'd had in years, and that's saying a lot, considering all of the Asian food I've had. The beans had a rich and smokey taste. ?Both did not fall flat with regards to texture. Honorable mentions: the salt potatoes, and the mac & cheese. THE SEQUEL. I wouldn't go out of my way to come here, but if the day were planned around Dinosaur, that'd be a different story. There isn't much in the area, either. I would dine here again, but not any time soon. My arteries need some rest.

I used to take road trips with College bussies at Colgate to Dinosaur Bar-B-Que in Syracuse and now go the one here in NYC semi-regularly. Definitely try the Dino WANGO TANGO wings. These wings are, in my opinion, the best wings one can have in NYC. The sauce is like a combination of barbecue and hot sauce but it actually works. The atmosphere is casual and the crowd is fun. I would recommend getting there early if you don't make a reservation as it is usually also crowded during peak times. Pink$ approved.

YUMMM!! Rib meat that comes right off the bone, chicken breast and wings..all grilled and smothered in their different BBQ sauces to your liking. Definitely try their mac & cheese. Cole slaw, mashed potatoes and corn bread are OK. A dozen honey BBQ wings with blue cheese and some mac & cheese always calms my craving for Dino's..any time of day! I knocked off one star because of lack of parking for those of us that drive and the ridiculously long wait times I've experienced at times (mostly evenings and nights on weekends) ...but the delicious BBQ variety that awaits usually makes up for it! ;-D

3.5 stars Three things you must get when you go: ribs sweet tea w/ rum - only $5.... some serious stuff yo bbq beans w/ pork Last night, I finally got to go to Dinosaur BBQ. You could smell the BBQ a block away from the restaurant - that's when you know the food is going to be delicious. Started off with wings and fried green tomatoes. I've never had wings that were so smokey! Best "american" wings ever. Now on to the entrees - like always, we over did ourselves and ordered the family portion (chicken, brisket, ribs w/ three large sides) AND a full rack of ribs with two small sides. here are my reviews: Chicken: soft juicy - saucy! Ribs: pure awesomeness - saucy! Brisket: fatty good (but not as good as Hill Country) Mac & cheese - tasty and creamy.Try it with the jalapeno peppers from the brisket... so good Creole Potato Salad - just the right touch, tasted like a combination of potato salad and egg salad. Bar-B-Que Fried Rice - first bite was weird. Bar-B-Que Beans with Pork - yum period. Honey Hush Cornbread - dinosaur BBQ needs to step up their cornbread game. Nothing compared to Three Brothers BBQ. My loyalty stays with Three Brothers BBQ but I love Dinosaur BBQ because it is affordable. Also, the ambiance is not tacky as the other places. Too bad it's so far or I would be coming back more often.

I love BBQ and really wanted to come here after finding this place on Foodnetwork. Sure, the food was pretty tasty, but I definitely hoped for more. For appetizers, I tried the fried green tomatoes and shrimp. The tomatoes had a delicious crunchy crust but tastewise it wasn't anything special. The shrimp were okay too; i'm not the biggest fan of shrimp cocktail. For my main dish I got the tres ninos which comes with ribs, brisket and pork. All the meat was pretty tender, but also quite sweet with the heavy sauces. I wonder what the meats would taste like without the sauces - if the innate flavor would be sufficient to generate a pleasing taste sensation. Plates also come with two choices of sides and cornbread!

As a transplant from Texas - I know BBQ! Tried Dinosaur last year with a friend and was disappointed - didn't see what all the hype was about. Tried Dinosaur last night with my boyfriend and now I understand! Order the ribs and NOT the mix plates! Trust me! Donkey punch was fantastic, fries, cornbread, veggie side are to die for also. Gripes - why is the wait always 1 hr+?! If you decide to eat at the bar, you must be aggressive when someone finally does get up. Their coleslaw was only so-so. Come with an appetite!

That rack of ribs. Slow barbequed and smoked to perfection. Smothered in hot Dino BBQ sauce. Need I say more? Without question the best bbq experience in NYC. And everything else we had (fried green tomatoes, shrimp boil, sides) was delish too. And their beer selection is excellent: over 20 microbrews on tap and a bunch more bottled imports - would come here just for the bar experience. Except then I know I'd have to get me some of those ribs. I'm still reeling from all that food after 3 hours. Feels good though.

WHAT THE FUDGE?! ?I finally made time (took half a day off) to trek up to this place for a lunch with a buddy and was completely floored by the food. ? We ordered the 2 meats special: bbq pork (pulled pork), ribs, 2 sides (mac n cheese & simmered greens), & honey cornbread. ?The ribs were off the hook...err...bone (tender meat...yum). ?The pulled pork was my ultimate favorite. ?We loved it so much we orderd another 1/2 pound of it. ?I felt like i was going to explode from too much meat overload. ?I washed everything down with a refreshing glass of iced tea. It's a little out of the way and it's feels a little sketchy being in an auto shop street, but it worth the trip. ?The only other way: go to the NYC BBQ fest. ?PS: It's way better than Blue Smoke!

We found this place on the way back from Fairway. The place is really American, like those cowboy ages. The waitress was very nice. We only ordered 1 huge chicken wing plate since we were not that hungary, and the service was still very pleasant although 3 of us paid $14 in total... By the way, the honey chicken wings were the better than any other place we've tried before. The only drawback is that it might not be a good place to be during the night...

I don't know why this place is so highly rated. ?My ribs had huge chunks of fat on them and my brisket had to be cut with a knife. ?Neither of which I would expect from any respectable BBQ place. The service was good, and our group of 8 was seated on time (with reservation), but that's the only reason I'm not giving this place 1-star. ?There are far better BBQ joints in NYC... try Daisy Mae's, and it will also save you a trek up to Harlem.

Pointer: Sit at the bar! You won't have to wait for a booth or table and it's just as comfortable! It's not as spacious but you're also not waiting 40 mins for a table. Okay onto the real stuff. Service was okay -- it was busy and hectic on the Saturday evening we were there so the waiter was a little flustered and rushed. But there wasn't a moment where I thought he was rude, inattentive, or crappy. The food was okay leaning towards good. Maybe it's because I'm not really used to dry rubs but the beef brisket & the bbq ribs just weren't as tasty, juicy, and tender as I was hoping they would be. It was a good thing I had plenty of water because that meat had a hard time going down. However, on a good note, no on a GREAT note, their chicken was awesome. It was tender, juicy, flavorful, yummy, and I could go on but I won't. Next time I go I will just order a platter of chicken. Even their breast meat was juicy, was is the real test of whether or not the chicken has been done right. The sides were mediocre. The beans had bacon in it and was a little sparse and runny. Tasty but was not filling - I might consider ordering it again as a side. The mac n'cheese just didn't have much flavor and was a bit disappointing. As a southern joint I was expecting some awesome sides and was sad to conclude that their sides were not at all impressive. So my words of wisdom? Choose the chicken. *bawk bawk*

I love their Big Ass Pulled Pork plate. I strongly suggest ordering whatever the soup of the day is. It's always amazing. ALWAYS. I can do without the crowds, the long wait for a table and the lack of street parking but at least the bar is fully stocked with plenty of beer varieties on tap.

If you haven't heard of Dinosaur BBQ by now, you may possibly be living under a rock. Maybe. I had heard rumors of the glory of this restaurant for a while, and was happy to finally go and experience the Dino. I honestly had held off going for so long for two reasons: 1) location, location, location (West 131st St.) 2) busy and impossible to get a reservation However, my friend insisted on having a bday get-together there and her boyfriend was able to procure a table for 12 (he called that morning, got a reservation for 7 on a Saturday night....all thanks to Mr. Platinum American Express). Yeah, it gets wicked crowded, and that probably takes a great amount of appeal away for many people. It's loud, jam-packed, and there is graffiti all over the bathroom. Can we argue it's part of it's charm? One great attraction of this place is actually the DRINK selection: 24 beers on tap and 23 bottled varieties, including the ever-elusive Lonestar beer. Pretty impressive. I myself am not a huge BBQ person, but I must say the food was fantastic. I had a 1/4 chicken and ribs plate, with mac n' cheese and steamed veggies on the side. And of course there is cornbread. The chicken was perfect - tender and juicy and flavorful. The ribs, eh, were just fine. Many of the people at the table (who are much more bbq educated than I) agreed that while the ribs were good, they weren't necessarily the best in the world. Although, probably near the best in New York. Service was quite attentive, considering the mass of people inside that needed attention. There is only 1 ATM inside the restaurant, which was a problem for us b/c it was broken.

Would get four stars if not for it being built inside a warehouse. Food was pretty good. I just wish the portions were a bit bigger. All in all price reflected quality of food, if not quantity so much. I want to try this place for dinner, but i've been told the wait is staggeringly long. Slightly discouraging, but they must be doin something right for it to be that way. Pretty good experience. You won't regret coming here. A little out of the way to get to, but well worth it.

Fine, I went to Dinosaur once and was completely underwhelmed. ?I got ribs and BBQ chicken with some average sides and bland corn bread. ?But everyone loves this place so I decided to give it another chance before reviewing. ?Today, about 9 months after the first experience, I went back for my last time. ?The food was still bland... nothing special. ?Halfway through (I got the chicken and ribs sampler again) I just thought to myself "I don't even really want to finish this". ?The chicken was dry and flavorless, I would have definitely had better from west side market rotisserie take homes. ?The ribs were salty, borderline overcooked, and again just not very flavorful. ? I just don't understand why anyone would pay money to eat here.

Wow, #306 review... ALL THE WAY OUT IN HARLEM IS WHERE YOU'LL FIND THE BEST RIBS IN NYC! Came here with my bff in April 2009 when visiting NYC. I made DBBQ my one spot to eat ribs while on vacation. I wasn't disappointed! We made reservations ahead of time. We used the MTA to get there... the walk wasn't that bad from the train station. They have tons of seating. Casual dining. Service ok was. Near the water. I had a full rack and ate every piece! yummm! While my friend on the other hand, couldn't finish his full rack and took the other half to go, hhaha. cracks me up, thinking I can finish a full rack and he can't! As for sides, order the garlic potato ball thingy... that was quiet itneresting. They have bathrooms there, which is always a plus. Satisfied yelper here! I left the place with a bucket full of bones on our table! If you're visiting NY, or live in NY and haven't been here, you must stop by and try it out for yourself! Dinosaur BBQ... I misss your ribs!!!!!!

In a real annoying area, however, if you want some well priced delicious BBQ, then this is your place. Definitely drop by if you're in in Harlem, though I'm not sure why you'd be near here. For sides, I would suggest the BBQ beans and the mac n' cheese. If you have a large party, you should make reservations because the place gets really packed and the wait can be long. I went on a night where they had a live blues band. Blues and BBQ, what a great combination.

Lots of people are doing it, so, so am I. ? Dinosaur BBQ is really a 2.5, but since I do not have any 2 star reviews so far, I'm slightly downgrading them. ?Blame Yelp for the lack of .5 on their rating scale. ?Ok, enough gibberish, and on my super unbiased, objective review. ? When I think bbq, I think of fall of your bone goodness. ?Only thing in that accomplishes that are the wings from the app menu. ?Everything else is just a sloppy plate of meat. ?Granted, all the food have a good smoke flavor, but I can pretty much accomplish that with a bottle of liquid smoke. ?The meat from the ribs are tough, and the chicken is actually pretty dry and bland. ?Their apps/ desert are actually worth the price of admission. ?The wings w/ japaneiro sauce had me flaming. ?Love it! ?Other than that, I can't really recommend anything else. ? Perhaps I do not have the palate for good bbq food. ?What a shame! ?For my money, if I'm craving good bbq, I'll make my way to Brother Jimmy's and get a bucket of ribtips. ?(That should be my next review!)

Great BBQ outside of the BBQ wasteland of midtown! Definitely get the wango tango chicken wings, they are delicious. ?From there the ribs were great with a nice rub and smoke flavor as well as the pulled pork. ?We tried pretty much all of the sides and they were all really good, notably the mac n cheese, bbq fried rice, and deviled eggs. ? Not too mention they have a nice selection of beers on tap so check that out. ?We will definitely be back!

The BBQ here is great. Awesome brisket/pulled pork/ribs/chicken. All of it is top notch. Also, their sides are fantastic. I highly recommend the mac and cheese, and chicken wings. The kick they add to these staples makes it extra special. Went with a group of ten and got great service for a good price. I recommend the sweet tea, for sure! We also got the fried tomatoes , another great hit!

This is not the hell's angel landmark upstate that my good friend raves about. Ribs, wings, shrimp boil and those little fried green tomatoes maybe salt potatoes on occasion. Of the items on the menu these are ok, as I wanted to love this place but i don't. ? Stick with these and you will get through your meal. The brisket and chicken and pulled pork was blah and everything else is just not worth it . I've tried nearly the entire menu in my five visits. Now that I don't live in NYC I have no reason to ride up there on a motorcycle which is something I did in the past.

Fried Green Tomatoes. ?BEST THING EVER!! ?Well, almost. ?I did dream about them last night which is telling. ? I hear there's a pretty significant wait time issue in the evenings but we came for lunch so we were seated immediately. ?Ribs were delicious, mac and cheese was good (it had a kick) as was the cole slaw. ?Corn bread was average. ?Service was great. ?Beer was tasty. ? Prices were not bad considering I got two meals worth of food for $15.95.

We had reservations, but we didn't all get there in time (actually, we were about an hour late.. as always). So 6 of us had about a 10 minute wait around 10pm on a Friday to get seated. Ordered up some brisket, pulled pork, ribs, and chicken to go with cole slaw, cornbread, collard greens, mac n cheese, Syracuse salt potatoes, and of course, fried green tomatoes. Tomatoes came first and tasted really good. Unfortunately, it was more the taste of the breading than the tomato that you got, but good nonetheless. Then came the mondo heaping plates of meat (with sides). Let's go down the list. Sides: Cornbread, good, not too sweet but lots of corn flavor. Cole Slaw, good. Mac n Cheese, too much paprika. Salt potatoes, buttery salty goodness. Collard Greens, collard greens. Chicken: Pretty well cooked and their BBQ sauce is really good. No complaints here. Brisket: Again, pretty well cooked with flavoring mostly from the sauce. Pulled Pork: Best of the meats... mainly because the flavoring came from more than just the sauce. Ribs: Disappointing. Sure, the sauce is good, but when you're eating ribs and you have to tear meat off the bone, and chew, it really disappointing. Atmosphere was fun though... dim lighting, loud, live music later on in the night, crowded, good crowd. And although their house BBQ sauce is really good (I especially like the one with the Habanero in it), the food just didn't blow me away. Maybe I was just so disappointed from the ribs... 3.5 stars for good (not great) food and a fun atmosphere Revisit? Let's see what else there is...

I went here without reservations on a Saturday night. We got seating in the bar in about 15 minutes. We were quoted a wait time of two hours for seating in the restaurant. A woman ahead of us with a group of eight was quoted a wait time of FOUR HOURS. Holy crap! The meat was very good, no complaints there! However, some of the sides were really disgusting...I believe the greens were the worst offenders. Other sides, however, were very good. The salty potatoes were excellent. But service kind of sucked (you know you're going to be that busy - hire more people) and the prices were a tad high for me. I usually think of barbeque as an affordable meal.

Things I recomend are as follows: 1) Wings. ?They are big. ?They are smoked. ?They are tangy. ?They are delicious. 2) Ribs. ?Fall of the bone. ?Nice sweet sauce. ?Great sweet flavor. 3) Fried green tomatoes. Perfect level of ripeness, not too hard. ?Great flavor! 4) Peanut butter pie. ?Creamy & packed with flavor. 5) Beer list. ?Huge and full of American craft brews!!! Overall, you can not go wrong at this place. ?Start with my recomendations above & expand if you so choose. Get a reservation in advance as the place is always packed! ?Yum.

I came here about a year ago and for some reason I thought I had already reviewed this place. Well, better late then never. We had pretty high expectations, especially with so many great reviews. Unfortunately, it was a pretty mediocre meal, and my husband and I were not impressed. We went around noon, and the place had just opened. The decoration was interesting (wooden tables, chairs, etc). The plates were plastic, which I thought was kind of tacky. We didn't see beef ribs on the menu (which our friend Hank recommended) so we ended up ordering pork ribs, wings, and a few sides. The portions were of a good size (although not nearly as huge as the server had described) but there was nothing spectacular about the taste/texture. Overall, we shelled out about $60 for 2 people, and we probably won't make a special trip just to come here again. I might think about coming back if we're ever in the area again just in case the place was having a bad day.

It felt and tasted like the Dino in Rochester (which forgive me if I'm wrong but I think predates this location). Went with some friends for a birthday dinner one Wednesday and decided on the pulled pork plate. It was the same as what I was used to in Rochester, good barbecue, I'm sure not the best, but I've also never been to Texas... They have awesome sides too, especially the mac and cheese. Everything I've had from them was good (brisket, ribs, pulled pork...) though I really wouldn't getting the hottest of the chicken wings. The wings themselves are alright but whatever sauce we got (the hottest they offered) just had no flavor and all burn. It's one thing to have a lot of heat but when it does you no good when you can't even taste the actual food it's supposed to be enhancing. Other than that what I certainly have to mention is the Genny Cream Ale and the Labatt Blue they have on the menu for $4 and $5 respectively I believe. Genny Cream is really more of a nostalgia thing from my time in Rochester and Labatt...well in WNY it's more abundant than water. Seeing these made my day, they certainly aren't the best beers but for me they might as well have been.

You give me the Ribs and Brisket with an Arrogant Bastard on tap and I am a VERY happy camper. Throw in some amazing baked beans and collard greens and it's just too much goodness for one man. Worried about not enough bbq sauce? Don't be. Each table is equipped with BBQ and hot sauces aplenty. Mmmmmmmhmmmmm. Wait, almost forgot. They have BUCKETS of PBR for only $16.

I've never enjoyed BBQ until now..... In the past the sauces I found were always too sweet for my liking. It left me not wanting more after the second bite. Dinosaur BBQ is not the majority that I've found in the past. In fact after yesterday's dinner with K. I find myself contemplating about having the leftovers for breakfast right about now... I've NEVER craved for BBQ in my life! The food - We ordered the fried green tomato's which tasted good but came out luke warm which was a shame. I would have enjoyed it a lot more hot. 13 jumbo wings - Sauce, juicy and not overly sweet! love love love..Can't wait to have these again. As for mains K and I both ordered combination meals which we enjoyed but barley touched. We were just so stuffed! After this experience I'm excited to travel the world in search of more authentic (if there is) BBQ out there. Dinosaur, you left me hungry for more....

I really enjoyed this place.

She knew exactly what we were talking about and was knowledgeable about the menu items we could eat. I LOVE THAT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! The only down side was the bathrooms were a wee bit grimy looking and the wait was VERY long, but we did go on a holiday so that could explain the extra long wait. Great spot.

One of the best deals in the city for amazing BBQ food. One thing is vital though: MAKE RESERVATIONS! ?Recently I arrived on a Wednesday night and since I had made reservations, my party was seated right away. ?Other people who just walked in with a party of the same number were told that there was a 45 minute to an hour wait. The ribs are perhaps the best I've had in the city. ?I find their brisket a bit dry, so I substitute it for pulled pork if I can. ?The portions are plentiful and each entree comes with 2 sides and corn bread. ?Our waiter couldn't hear us and was a bit clueless. ?He was very nice if overtaxed with too many customers--the wait for a new drink was rather long. ?We were disappointed that the "vegetable of the day" was a thick, goupy mediocre onion casserole (we were trying to be a BIT healthy) but the Syracuse Salt Potatoes are the best! They are a must have! ?Every time I'm at Dinosaur Bar-B-Que I end up having a great meal. ? PS. If you want to try something cool and you are waiting for a table, go stop by the giant Fairway across the street. They have a whole "cold" part of the store where they give you parkas to wear while you shop since it's the right temperature for the food.

Yes Yes Yes. ?Y-E-S. Yes. I'm a sucker for BBQ, and I've heard nothing but amazing things about Dinosaur BBQ. ?It's not quite the best BBQ I've had before, but definitely up there for what I've had in New York. I got the Tres Hombres (or Amigos? ?Some Spanish word for "dudes") which gave me a good portion of ribs, brisket, and pulled pork. ?The ribs were fall off the bone tender, with that perfect level of smokiness which is just the way I like 'em. ?The brisket was really good, but not quite as good as Fette Sau's. ?The pulled pork was y'know...pulled pork. I carb loaded for my non-existent future run with the whipped sweet potatoes and the mac and cheese. ?Both were very solid, but short of amazing. Still, one of the best BBQ buys in the city, and worthy to be named among the city's best.

Oddly enough, the only two times I've gone here, I went because my friend's visiting-from-England vegetarian girlfriend insisted that we go. ?She loves this place. ?I'm not entirely sure why. ?As a meat-eater, I find Dino BBQ ok but mostly hype. Even when you have a reservation you have to wait. ?The last time we came, we made a reservation for a large group of 10 or so people, and they initially tried to seat us at an 8-seater. ?That obviously wasn't going to work, so more waiting was involved. I've had the churrasco chicken steak entree and the chicken "dream" club. ?Both were good but I really enjoyed the sides I've tried -- roasted whipped sweet potatoes, mac and cheese, and the Syracuse style salt potatoes. ?OMG THE SALT POTATOES. ?Those are incredible.

Holy god how I've missed you Dino! I worked at the Syracuse location during college and ate it basically every day for a summer. You think I'd grow tired of it but being back in NY made my craving for Dino burn out of control like an unattended grease fire. After walking around NYC in the sweltering heat and stupidly getting lost on the upper east side I convinced my friends that Dino would always be worth the trek. Needless to say after walking for what seemed like an eternity and after catching a shady subway through ghetto-ass Harlem we found the hidden gem that is Dino. After heaping portions of fall off the bone ribs, brisket slathered in BBQ sauce, and the world famous Dino pulled pork my friends easily admitted that I was right and that our sweat soaked trek was well worth it. If this place suffers from anything it's that the hype causes it to be both a tourists delight as well as a local hangout. In the end though who cares because what's better than enjoying a cold beer and BBQ with good friends in the city?

The meat here isn't as mind-blowing as Hill Country's but the bbq sauce is good, the sides are top notch, the service is speedy and friendly, and I love coming here. Plus it's a short bike ride away. And the wings are awesome, as are the fried green tomatoes (and the ribs!). Brisket is kind of lackluster compared to Hill Country, though. More importantly, there's a great draft list (hello Arrogant Bastard, I am looking at you) and they play fun music and I generally have a good time here. They've got me coming back on a regular basis and I'm sure they'll get you coming back too. But it's a shitshow during peak hours so be prepared for a wait (or sit in the bar area like we always do).

Went here thanks to a friend getting a 30% coupon from blackboardeats. We started with some apps: Chicken Wings (hot) - BEST part of the meal. So tender and juicy, right amount of smoke flavor. The rub was unbelievably tasty and not masked in sauce. A hit in every way. Fried green tomatoes - Very good. Crunchy breading with a nice green tomato slice inside. It's the way FGT's should be. For entrees, I had the Ode to Elgin - pork ribs, brisket, and a hot sausage link. Ribs - You could definitely taste the smoke. I'm not great with wood flavoring but it smelled/tasted of standard hickory or mesquite. They were tender but not competition tender... still slightly stringy. They could either spend more time low and slow or they were just cooked incorrectly (hot and fast). Another MAJOR no-no was that they did NOT remove the membrane from the back of the ribs. That's just lazy and irresponsible. It tells a lot. Brisket: Great flavor. Just enough fat to mix w the lean meat. As far as tenderness and juiciness, it was a hair under par as well. It was not tender as some other places I've had brisket in the tri-state area and it was not as juicy as I know brisket can be. Elgin's sausage link: Awesome flavor! This was the highlight of the combo platter. The mix of herbs and spices was great and it was not overpowered by smoke. I didn't care much for the sauce they dressed on it; it was ok. Overall, 3 stars is about right. The apps were awesome and I think I could just go with chicken wings and entree next time, but from the entrees that I got and sampled from others, I've had better BBQ (e.g. Blue Smoke's ribs) in the area. It's a solid place but when a place just can't do my favorite BBQ right (ribs), it falls short.

Went on a Wednesday night without a reservation with 4 friends. ?It was the Wednesday before Thanksgiving so I think we lucked out with only a 30 minute wait. ?Grabbed a beer at the bar and just chatted while we waited. ?The bar is a decent size and we were able to get pretty quick service while watching a basketball game. 29 minutes later, our name was called and we sat down. ?For dinner, I had the Smothered Texas BBQ Brisket with onions, peppers, mushrooms & cheese. ?For sides, had the greens and mac & cheese. ?The brisket was sooooo tender and juicy. ?Pretty much a party in my mouth and the mac & cheese was just right. ?The greens were sweet, which is not how I prefer to have them, and I wouldn't order them again. ?The portion size was large - I probably could have taken a place home but well...I didn't. lol. The service was just okay which is why I'm not giving this place 5 stars, though it definitely deserves 4.5 stars for sure. ?If you haven't been, join the party and make an appearance - you won't be sorry.

A former manager and I went here for brews and some juicy barbeque one cold NYC evening, and we were not disappointed. They had some really yummy appetizers and a full beer selection. ?The bartender knew here stuff and made a pretty good Old Fashioned later in our evening, as well. Their BBQ platters all looked good, but we opted for the pork. ?Very tender and succulent. Recommended if you want some down-home BBQ in the Big Apple.

After hearing so many good things about this place, I finally had a chance to come. We went in around 4:30pm and sat right down, granted it was a Thursday but there wasn't a wait. The sampler they do is completely worth it to try some of the stuff they make. ?The fried green tomato was really good as well as the wings. There house beer was worth the money as well. For my entrée I ended up getting the Memphis pulled pork. One of my favorite BBQ items, the sandwich was good but I was hoping for more. I have a feeling my friend who talked this place up might have done so a little too much. All in all, this entire place has some great BBQ if you're in the area and are in the mood for some, Although I don't think it's worth a 45 minute drive.

Fun place! This is a great spot, especially on a cold fall/winter day. There's nothing like some heavy bbq to warm you up. My date and I got one of the combos - with pulled pork, ribs, and brisket. Sides were mac'n cheese, wedge salad, potatoes. The corn bread was delish. Of course, started with some lemonade (which I actually thought was a bit too sugary/flavorless, but refreshing nonetheless). I confess, I've never actually had barbeque in NYC so not much to compare it to, but I'll definitely come back here when in the mood for BBQ. The ambiance of this place is great - really warm, and relaxed. Good for a weekend afternoon!

Dinosaur is my favorite 'cue joint in the city. I've gone about half-a-dozen times since it opened and it always delivers. The location can be inconvenient for most people in the city if you don't own a car - except for me, suckers! - but it's not so far as to make getting there a hassle. The remoteness works in its favor: they have a large space right north of Riverside Park (they moved across the street and down the block to a larger location a bit ago). It didn't occur to me while I was eating there, but after giving it some thought, the restaurant's layout and decor are atypical for what you'll find in most of Manhattan; it reminds me more of the standalone places commonly found outside of large cities. The restaurant has high ceilings, a dining area spread across a couple sections with some booths, and a really long bar. It's done up like you'd expect from a regular bbq joint: a lot of wood to give it a smokehouse-style feel. The long bar turns out to be key. As some Yelpers have mentioned, the wait here can get ridiculous, running north of two hours on a busy weekend night. A reservation is highly recommended if you're thinking of eating here. However, getting stuck at the bar for an hour isn't the end of the world. They have a very extensive beer list, including weekly specials. The last time I went I had a Sierra Nevada, which was really good, but they also have IPAs and some other good stuff on tap. In case you get hungry while waiting at the bar, you may want to consider getting some wings. I went on a wing crawl a couple months ago and everyone agreed that Dinosaur's wings are the best in the city. Get the Wango Tango (hot) or one of the hotter flavors and you won't be disappointed. They're spicy, smoky, cooked perfectly (broiled or baked, not deep-fried), and there's a ton of meat on them - everything you could ever want in a chicken wing (or food in general). A chicken wing is such a basic food item, but these are wonderful and deserve a 5-star rating. The rest of Dinosaur's food is pretty darn good, regularly 3-4 stars. The ribs are meaty, moist, and if you're craving more flavor, you can choose from any of their hot sauces (sauce!). I'm in love with Wango Tango, but every now then I opt for some more spice in my bbq love life. The ribs good, but they aren't the best I've ever had; the meat doesn't quite fall of the bone. If it did this place might deserve 5 stars. The brisket, which has a noticeable pink smoke ring encasing each slice, is similarly moist, smoky and waiting for you to lavish it with sauce. I've also tried the pulled pork (I'm a fan), sausage (like that one too) and chicken, and have always come away satisfied. Also, they make a pork-sket sandwich. If that isn't 4-star worthy, I don't what is. No review would be complete without giving mention to the sides. I've had every one except the carrot & raisin salad and they're mostly all solid. My favorites are the mac & cheese, which is awesome cheesy and delicious, the bbq beans with pork (yes, mostly because of the pork, but that's a happy thing), and the whipped sweet potatoes with a little crunch always hit the spot. Be sure to ask for the black-eyed peas if you go on a Friday (only served one day a week). The only side I'd shy away from is the collard greens, which are not made with smoky, meaty goodness, and therefore kind of blah. The desserts are okay, in the 3-star range. If you're still hungry for dessert, you aren't doing your meal right. Dinosaur's not the cheapest 'cue around - Hello, Dallas! - but you get a ton food. I've never once walked out of there anything less than completely stuffed and happy to walk, not take the subway, home. Each platter is more than enough food for one person, so if you go with a group you'll wind up splitting a few and the bill ends up being totally reasonable. Here's me at dinosaur with some bbq on my plate: "RAAAWWWRRR!!!!!!!!!!!" I do a totally awesome tyrannosaurus rex.

****700th Review**** Came on a weekend afternoon for lunch and there was no wait at all. I got a pull pork sandwich and it was divine. ?I have yet to try the ribs, but that's definitely what I'm getting next time. The food is served on plastic colored plates that remind me of cafeteria plates. It really takes away from the presentation of the food and makes it look cheap even though it tastes amazing. My only real complaint is that even though there weren't a lot of people there, we still had to wait a really long time for our food to come. We were really hungry by the time it actually came. It may have not been the perfect restaurant experience, but the food more than made up for it.

Was here last nite for the first time and it won't be the last! Great food. I only had the pulled pork sandwich, but had a taste of the brisket sandwich and the bbq wings... they were all delicious. The 2 sides I chose were the sweet potatoes and the Syracuse style salt potatoes... very tasty indeed, but kinda small servings, unfortunately. I've got to go back and get a real entree next time to see if the portions are bigger. Highly recommended. Make a reservation: I was there around 7p and it was already packed, with people already waiting (on a Tuesday evening). :-)

Atmosphere-wise, this place really feels like Texas. The smells, the decor and even the almost-friendly attitudes of the staff are a welcome reminder of the Lone-Star home from which I hail. I was extremely displeased that we were made to wait more than 15 minutes, despite having a reservation. We might as well have just walked in off the street. That was the biggest problem we encountered the whole time, though. The food was delicious and the portions were OUTRAGEOUS. I cleaned my plate and thought I might explode and/or go into a food coma right then and there. I got a meat sampler plate with ribs, brisket and pulled pork, all of which were very impressive. The sides were passable, but not memorable. Dino would have gotten 4 stars were it not for the reservation faux pas and for its out-of-the-way location. I love BBQ but am not necessarily willing to sit on a train for half a day just to get it (especially if my reservation will be all but ignored once I arrive...just sayin').

We had a large birthday party (9 people) here and had to wait an hour or so (expected with such a large party). Don't think we had reservations, not sure if they even take reservations. Anyway, we sat outside on one of their lovely bench tables. The serve was slow, they were extremely crowded... the drinks were somewhat weak too. The menu selection was alright - at least they had everything you'd usually see at a NYC bbq place. Nothing wowed me, nothing to impress me. Probably won't visit again though... I'll stick to Hill Country's BBQ instead.

Dinosaur BBQ is an interesting place. The decor is that of a wild west more than the middle of NYC. The food is best for meat lovers. Its a little far north for me, but its something different than my usual fare and I might just go back if I am ever that that part of town.

I have lived in the south and have a grandmother and aunt who can pretty much put any BBQ joint to shame. WIth that being said this is not the best BBQ by a long shot so don't go there expecting to get your mind blown by some finger licking good ribs, brisket or pulled pork. Don't get me wrong its decent but the food is not something that makes your mouth water a few days before you are due to dine. What is good are the fried green tomatoes, the cornbread and the baked beans. The mac n cheese is a little thick for my taste, again my granny puts it down in the soul food category, The mac n cheese that comes closest to hers is at ACME. What is also good is the crowd, everyone is here from all walks of life, all backgrounds, getting their grub on. If you are looking for some good looking people know that they like to eat ribs at Dinosaur. We had a blast, what did we have to eat, the question is what didn't we have. From food and drink I think we had just about everything on the menu. I recommend the pulled pork or brisket sandwiches these are consistent winners. Dinosaur is always fun the service has always been friendly and fast.

Horrible phone customer service for take out or delivery. I have lived in Harlem and ordered from them from 2009-2012 and it has always been bad. Attitudes, argumentative, ?and they mess up your order consistently. If you are looking for a great dinner at home DO NOT ORDER from them.

I'm from Chicago & was out in NYC for work & asking about a few BBQ places in the NYC area. ?Someone told me about Dinosaur BBQ and said I wouldn't be dissapointed... From the time I walked in I was blown away/! ?The smell of the smoker, seeing the wood piled up near the hostess station & the ambiance was all I needede to know it would be good! Great smoked wings, I loved the sauce & the ribs we some of the best I've eaten. ?And they have a great beer selection, including my new NYC favorite "Porkslap". I can't wait to go back!

Went on the recommendation of a friend who had studied at Columbia. ?When I arrived at 10pm on a Friday night, there was a two hour wait for a table...but you could get a first come-first serve spot at any of the high tables, so we just lurked around with a beer for 15-20 minutes before two people left. Once we sat down, the service was very good. ?Space was tight, but we got by alright. The ribs were Northern-style with lots of sweet and tangy BBQ sauce. ?Sides were tasty and well proportioned. ?The ribs tasted good and were cooked well, with the meat falling right off the bone and a taste that can only come from an open flame cooking them. Another plus was the beer selection. ?There were a number of brews on tap, including some regional microbrews that are rarely seen outside of the city in which their brewed (Goose Island Honkers Ale was a pint of hometown pride). Overall, a fine establishment and worth a trip if you're in the mood for some good BBQ.

Dinosaur, you make me want to be 5 years old again. How I miss my yearly visit to your bbq heaven on trips to visit my Grandparents in Syracuse every summer. ?You were my first, and you shall be my last pulled pork sandwich. Sadly this location of Dinosaur Bar-B-Que does not do the the Dinosaur name any justice at all. ?The "syracuse style salt potatoes" were too greasy and flavorless, the cornbread served with the shrimp was dry and like eating sawdust, the broccoli salad side dish reminded me of my Mom's , and the pulled pork was nothing compared to the cooked all day taste of the pork you serve back upstate. Maybe this is proof that some upstate things should never be attempted by downstate people.

I heard this place is THE bbq place to go to in manhattan. People trek uptown for this. So I had pretty high expectations going in. First off: make a reservation! We went on a whim during a study break, on a friday night, during a Yankee's game. Worst idea ever? There was a two hour wait for a table but an hour and 3 beers later, we were able to snag one of the first come first serve tables at the bar. We both got the rack of ribs with beans, mac & cheese, and potato salad. The ribs were good but I felt like they could have been more meaty. Anyone that's been to Phil's BBQ in San Diego knows what I'm talking about! That being said, I'll definitely go back and try their other options on the menu. Maybe the brisket and the fried green tomatoes?

This place kind of reminded me of Dallas BBQ but better! Went here on a Saturday night w/o reservations hoping to get lucky and get seats within an hour. What ended up happening was we could've of gotten a table but would have had to wait 2.5 hours.. so instead we decided to order take out which ended up being an hour wait anyways. Lesson learned? Make reservations or call to place an order for pick up! Their wings were delicious and so was the pulled pork. The spinach was kind of gross... but very good wings and mac & cheese!! :)

Too lazy to trek it up to Harlem for the actual restaurant, I waited 45min basking in the summer sun for Blues BBQ on the Hudson at Pier54 instead yesterday. The event was from 2-9pm. Dinosaur was here and so was Mara's Homemade, Brother Jimmy's, and Dallas Jones. There was also crappy jazz playing. There's something to be said about eating BBQ near the water..it's almost luxurious even. We ordered: -Pulled pork sandwich ($7.50) - you add your own sauce, i still like Daisy May's better, although I hear Virgil's is known for that as well as brisket -Rib sandwich ($7.50) - 3 ribs btwn a sesame seed bun..no joke. The ribs were sofa king good though, albeit the wide bones which made the rib look like it was deceptively meaty. For this price I might as well have ordered the half rack ($12) or full rack ($22) -Platter (+$2.50) - includes cucumber/tomato salad - VERY GOOD, bbq baked beans - DELISH! -Aquafina bottled water ($1.50) - um..yeah...water, opted for this instead of the beer stands

Dino BBQ is a pretty far trek for BBQ if you are in the village, but its definitely well worth the trip. ?Dino BBQ has a great atmosphere. When I was there the bar was hoppin' and the music was playing loudly, and people were gathered around every nook and crany they could find that was vacant to hang out and chat. ?I loved eating here, with my friend. We sat together and enjoyed appetizers galore ... We actually met the Chef Cooter and he pointed us in the right direction with what we should order, what we shouldn't order, and what we should splurge on. Everything about DINO BBQ was fabulous. We had a great time drinking together and eating some finger lickin' good food together. Head up to Dino if you are in the mood for some southern soul food.

Open the door, get on the floor, everybody walk the dinosaur! That "Flintstones" movie song is great. ?Dino BBQ NYC, not as much but it is still good. ?I came here on Fourth of July because my friends and I figured that Independence day and BBQ go hand and hand. ?Dinosaur was the natural choice to try out. ?Prior to my visit, my foodie friends have gawked at me because of the fact that I had yet to visit this establishment. ?Now that I've been, I believe that this is a solid and tasty BBQ joint, but definitely not the best I've ever had. My friends and I ordered the swag sampler plate to start, which to be honest was the best plate of the night. ?Deviled eggs, good, shkrimp, goood, chicken wings, goooood, fried green tomatoes, goOoOooOOd! ?For my entree, I ordered Dino's traditional plater (1/4 rack bbq ribs, 1/4 bbq chicken bbq texas beef brisket, and a choice of two sides, which ended up being syracuse salt potatoes, and bbq beans). ? Lets start w/ what is suppose to be the star, the ribs. ?Dino's BBQ sauce is quite excellent, smokey, spicey, robust, quite tasty i must say. ?However, just cuz you have a great sauce does not automatically mean your bbq ribs will be fabulous. ?Outside of the great sauce, my ribs were fall off the bone, but they weren't as most and tender as I was hoping and in fact were a bit dry. ?Moving on, I felt the same about the beef brisket. ?Great sauce, dry meat. ?The bbq chicken was the best protein on my plate. ?It was moist tender and perfectly cooked. ? Through my friends I was also able to try a multitude of sides. ?I tasted the salted 'cuse potatoes, baked beans, whipped sweet potato w/ spiced nuts, mac n cheese, dinos corn on the cob (veggie of the day). ?The stars out of this group were definitely the beans, potatoes, corn, and whipped sweet potatoes. ? Two items that are a definite must try, are not from the kitchen, but from the bar. ?The Dinosaur Ale and dino's Blueberry sangria are wonderful refreshments on a hot summer day. ? In a nutshell this place was a decent bbq joint w/ decent food. ?However, by no means am I going to crave this place so much so that I'd trek all the way up to Harlem for.

i still absolutely love this place! my boyfriend and i decided, last minute, to go here for valentine's day. although i called (yes, foolishly the day of) and was told that of course there would be no reservations available, we walked in at 7 p.m. and were immediately seated. that's not to say it wasn't packed - by the time we left at 9 p.m., it was definitely packed. the hottie boyfriend and i split a delicious pitcher of dogfish head 90 minute IPA. so amazing. we also split and finished a platter that included brisket, chicken, and ribs. our two sides were the brussels sprouts and the mac & cheese. NEVER forego the mac & cheese. for desert, we split an apple caramel cake. yum! needless to say, dinosaur met my expectations and our february 14th celebration dinner was a success that took little planning and happened quite organically - much like our beautiful relationship. hehehe. okie. i'll stop the cheese now. but . . . just go here already.

Not sure where to start with this place. ?It seems everyone thinks this is the hands down best BBQ spot in NYC. ?Lets stick to the facts. Bar - They have a nice selection of beers here. ?Not sure why everyone kept ordering Coors Light. ?Amateurs. ?They also have a house specialty cocktail which is essentially 151 and some other fruit juice/liquors. ?Hold onto your hats when drinking this one. Fried Green Tomatoes - Sadly, the highlight of the meal. ?Very good. Full Slab Ribs with Beans and Fries - Beans and fries were good. ?The ribs however could have been very good but whoever prepped the ribs left the membrane on. ?If you have eaten enough ribs (and know anything about ribs) you know that the membrane is not supposed to be there. ?It is essentially like a piece of plastic when its been cooked. ?This really ruined it for me. ?I wonder if all slabs have the membrane left on or did I get the unlucky slab? Half BBQ Chicken with Mac & Cheese and Beans - The chicken was moist and delicious. ?Mac & Cheese not bad either. Final verdict - I would not wait 1.5 hrs for a table again. ?The membrane being left on the ribs made for a less than enjoyable experience and frankly, its disgusting and makes me wonder about the rest of the kitchen prep.

Once you step into this place, you feel as if you fell into a wormhole and landed somewhere upstate. The interior decor of Dinosaur BBQ feels like it was masterminded by the set designer of that Patrick Swayze movie "Roadhouse". As for the BBQ, I ordered the full rack of pork ribs with a side of baked beans and macaroni & cheese. The food came out quickly... I mean McDonald's quick. The pork ribs were not very hot and bit dried out on the surface. The meat tasted good, but not spectacular. Actually, it was a little rare close to the bone on some parts. The baked beans had this citrus taste throughout. I usually like eclectic ways to spruce up this old favorite, but this time it wasn't working. The best part of my meal was the side of macaroni & cheese, but compare to S'Mac, the cheese in this mac & cheese wasn't making the cut. It reminded me of the hot lunches that I was served in middle school. All I needed was the aqua green plastic tray and a surly lunch lady serving me jello. Despite all the hype behind this place, I'm giving this place 2.5 Yelp stars for food, service, and ambiance. It's worth checking out at least once. A reservation is recommended after 7pm on the weekdays and anytime on a weekend night.

My favorite BBQ place in the city. Too bad it's all the way uptown. I first came here when they opened a few years ago. They do everything big here. Started off with some massive chicken wings. One or two is more than enough to start off your meal. Then came the huge ribs which came off the bone without much effort at all. Their brisket wasn't as tender as I liked but it was smokey and flavorful. The chopped pork was nicely sauced and went great with some bread. Definitely starve yourself if you plan on coming to Dinosaur.

The only reason they didn't get 5 stars is because I'm used to BBQ in Kansas City. But this is the best BBQ place in NYC I have had, and I've tried quite a few. The ribs wee juicy, pulled pork was tender, and the brisket was smoky. It was all really great! I had the Salt Potatoes and I can't stop thinking about them. They are little potatoes cooked until very soft and in a tray of butter, garlic, and paprika (I think). OMG!!! Next time I'm getting 2 orders of them. I also had the beans, which were okay, but seemed to be the consistency of refried beans. They also had an herb flavor, but I couldn't place it, and the server was way to busy to ask. My date had the potato salad which was good (coming from a true southerner). It was a cool atmosphere, but really loud and busy for a Wednesday night. Be sure to make reservations before you go. It's so worth the trip to Harlem from Midtown! I can't wait to go back!

Sloooooow delivery but I have to admit the food was almost worth the over an hour wait. The ribs were were fantastic, although I like mine with a bit more sauce. The Syracuse salt potatoes were really good, unlike anything I've ever had and a nice alternative to mashed potatoes. The mac & cheese tasted like it came from a box, which was really disappointing. But the cornbread was the worse by far, what a waste, no flavor and extremely dry! It's a bit pricey for what it is, not sure I'd order delivery from them again but would probably eat in the actual restaurant. I personally prefer Dallas BBQ, but everyone has their own tastes.

I dunno folks. ?I'll preface this by saying the lower than average rating is probably because both my parents were from the south and my dad hauled out the charcoal BBQ pit a few times a year and went to town cooking up some delicious BBQ. I'm a bit spoiled. ? I went to Dinosaur with a New Yorker who was just raving about it. ?I'd also heard good things about it from another New Yorker. ?It's good, but it's not anywhere near the best BBQ I've ever had. ?I can even see how you can rave about this place if you're not used to the scent of smoked meat being prepped by your mom in the kitchen. ?However, that's what I grew up with, so my expectations are higher. The friend green tomatoes? ?I'd say just okay. ?The mac and cheese? ?Again, just okay. ?The collard greens? Actually, those were pretty bad. They were chopped way too fine and had too much vinegar. We had an appetizer plate that came with fried green tomatoes, shrimp, chicken wings and deviled eggs. ?The eggs were really tasty. ?The problem was the first thing I had was one of those eggs and, except for the ribs, my meal was just average regarding the rest of the food ate. ? It's just with a big range of food like that you want most of it to be delicious and not merely okay. ?Next time I go for BBQ in Manhattan, I'm going to have to try another spot. I think next time I've got to track down that Daisy May's truck I've heard about ;)

Dinosaur BBQ has been my favorite BBQ spot for years! Three stars for their service, sides, decor, and quality alone! The ONLY reason Im taking away 2 stars is because I went for my "hit" of Dino Ribs this past Friday night and I gotta say... someone is doing something VERY wrong in the kitchen!! My ribs were WAY WAY WAAYYYYY TOO SALTY... I actually started to feel sick!! It was ridiculous. AND the ribs were dry!! Now Dinos Ribs were always perfectly seasoned and super tender and juicy... but not that night. I went a few weeks back as well and they were pretty dry too! Not as salty as this time... I actually had to STOP EATING because the salt was making me sick. Im super disappointed in you Dino... And it wasn't just me... 5 other people at my table had the same problem... Way too salty, and way too dry. Dino... if you recently changed chefs or something, GET THE OLD ONES BACK ASAP!!! I still love you for your delish side dishes, drinks and awesome service... but one cannot live on that alone!! I love you guys... so I'm gonna give you guys another chance once my salt level comes down...

AMAZING! My girlfriend and I went Tuesday and were more than pleased with the service, price and food. We got the fried green tomatoes to start. I'm not even a fan of tomatoes but my girlfriend told me I had to try them. I was blown away. Juicy, crispy and the ranch dressing that came with it was awesome! I ordered the brisket, pulled pork combo plate with 2 sides of bbq pork baked beans and the mac n' cheese. They were absolutely amazing. The pulled pork was so tender and smokey it brought tears to my eyes. The brisket was perrrrrrrrfect. I couldn't get over it I wanted more. The mac and cheese was thick and hearty and the beans flavorful. This place is great and I can't wait to go back!

The BEST BBQ in town!! They moved a block away but the food and the ambient still the same!! Cool place to enjoy some beer, choose from 25 on tap... Or just do like me and get the sampler with 4 different beers at time... Best of all, you get all the DELICIOUS food at very good price... Usualy the bill here comes out to be ~$40 per person with all the beers and tips included...

Amazing food and definitely worth the drive. For any barbecue lover it should be a top hit on their list! Any non-barbecue lover be prepared to fall in love. The delicious wango tango wings and chipotle sauce wings are to die for. Along with the korean style BBQ ribs BBQ pork beans and Mac and cheese. The cornbread is phenomenal and the atmosphere is casual an relaxed. ?Also recommend the Texas style Brisket. The service is impeccable, so sit back relax and chow down.

While the food is tasty and some of the best BBQ in the city, this location can't compare to my, perhaps idealized, memories of the Rochester location. We were told our wait would be between an hour, thirty minutes and two hours but we were seated in about 45 minutes. Should've made reservations, which they do take. Overall, the food was good and the wide beer selection was nice but the experience was marred by inexplicably inattentive and slow service. Our waitress was never around when we needed her and didn't check up on us even after doing so at an adjacent table. She seemed to have been doing her best to ignore us. We put our orders in before a large group with the same waitress but didn't get our food until after they did with parts of it cold. I definitely plan on going back, after making reservations. Hopefully, the service will be better.

This is the best BBQ in New York. ?It might be my favorite restaurant in New York. The only other BBQ place I've been that could compare is a little tiny place down in the West Village (Dallas Jones BBQ) but the ambience at Dinosaur combined with the food and good prices is really what makes it stand out. There is so much I could say about this place, I will just leave it to this: ?I always leave happy. ?Whether it's eat-in, take-out, or lunchtime delivery, Dinosaur always makes me happy. ? Unless it's Monday and I get a BBQ craving (they're closed on Mondays). Just a few tips: 1) The wait is unbearable on weekends at normal dinner (or even lunch) hour. ?Make a reservation, or go on a Tuesday or Wednesday at 6:30 and you'll be seated right away. 2) If you find yourself there during prime hours, try and snag a table in the bar area. ?There are several tables there with regular waiter service, and they are first-come, first-served seating. ?You just have to hover and pounce as soon as someone starts to leave. 3) Get the appetizer sampler, with fried green tomatoes, deviled eggs, boiled shrimp, and wings. ?You won't regret it. 4) get an order of wings for the table. ?The wings are the best thing on the menu. ?(the pork items are great too, of course) 5) Okay, on to sides. ?BBQ baked beans (with pork) are the best. ?After that comes ?salt potatoes, cole slaw, and mac-and-cheese. ?The greens aren't bad, but they're nothing special. ?Ask what their special vegetable is, sometimes it is really good. 6) Save room for dessert. ?Seriously. ?They're all really good. While the meat is really the highlight here, I've brought many vegetarians who have thoroughly enjoyed themselves. ?Between the great beer selection, the amazing fried green tomatoes and deviled eggs, and the vegetarian sides, there are options.

I have to say that this place really really disappointed me, my husband and daughter. ?A restaurant will lose serious star power when they don't make my baby happy. Wait time was crazy: 1hr. Meal was average and service crappy. To top off the evening we crossed the street to get to our car ; had to tell a crackhead to move herself and ?shopping cart ?because she was blocking the passenger side door. ?It didn't appear to bother her since she was on another planet ?at that moment.

Went to Dinosaur with a group of colleagues to celebrate the holidays. ?First off, I was surprised how big the place was. ?Despite having a lot of tables, there were still people waiting to be seated. ?Luckily we had a reservation and sat at a long table, which was perfect. ? It was a feast. ?We kept the pitchers of beer coming, as we all devoured fried green tomatoes (minus Jessica Tandy), shrimp, . ?After that, it was a meat fest, with ribs, chicken, and pulled pork which was my personal favorite. ?We also ordered some of your standard bbq sides, but for some reason we didn't order mac and cheese!! The service we received was fantastic. ?Not only did the waiter accommodate our big group, but he also kept filling our pitchers and didn't rush us out of there, despite the big crowd. ? While Dinosaur was VERY good, my favorite bbq in the city is still Daisy May's. ?I have been told that the original Dinosaur in Syracuse is much better, so we'll have to try that when we're up there for ?wedding in May. ?I'll be sure to report back with a review.

I will preface this by saying that I am a major carnivore. ?Got it? GIMME MEAT!!! ?AND PLENTY OF IT!!!!! Having said that, I do love Dinosaur BBQ, and have been there many times, dragging various friends (who all love it when they leave too!). ?The brisket is fabulous, the Syracuse Salt Potatoes the stuff of dreams. ?Don't think I've had anything I didn't like here. ?The Fried Green Tomatoes are a must! ?The Deviled Eggs are yummy as well. ?Oh, and the Sweet Potato Pie .... hmmmm........ They have fascinating beer choices (which I can't drink) and really good mixed drinks .... including a really wonderful mojito! I concur with some of the other reviewers: go when you are HUNGRY, and be ready to SQUEAL with delight! ?Also, be prepared for a wait (unless you've planned ahead and made a reservation!!). ?This place is POPULAR at any time, and can result in up to an hour's wait, easy, to get a table. ?However, if you are a small group, and there's room in the bar, snag a table there. ?You will be served a full menu there as well!

Let me start by saying that the only reason im giving 3 stars is because on my last visit here everything was great. ?Now with that being said i dont khow what in the world happened last night. ?The place was packed and the wait was about 30 minutes, so not bad at all but after having our names called they left us by the hostess stand for another 5 minutes waiting to be seated. ?When we were finally sat our table of 2 was given a table for 6 very strange. Ok now on to the food im pretty sure it was one prep guy in the back that sabotaged the entire night because everything was too salty. ?We started with the deviled eggs which i usually love but were ruined by waaay to much salt. ?The salmon fritters were ok and i the fried green tomatoes were the best thing i had all night. ?I had the brisket which was no where near room temp i get that bbq is not served hot but this might have just as well been right out of the fridge. ?My sides were terrible unedible bbq pork fried rice and the mac n cheese was not good. ?Will be back though on what is hopefully not an off night.

This place is awesome! There are two barbecue joints that I like to visit every once in a while in NYC. One is Fette Sau in Brooklyn and the other is Dinosaur Barbecue in Harlem. The service here is fantastic and the food is great. The place gets packed very quickly so I would make a reservation. I haven't been to their new location yet, so hopefully they don't have that problem as much anymore. We came before dinner hours usually start and still ended up waiting 45 minutes which is nothing compared to what later diners face. Take the trip on the 1 train to Dinosaur. It is one of ?those great out of the way food experiences.

This is as good as BBQ will get in New York. ?We ventured to the BRAND NEW Dinosaur Bar-B-Que in Harlem and were lucky enough to grab a 6-spot table in the bar area. Otherwise, the wait would've been a good 45 minutes or so. TDF (to die for, kids): mac and cheese, pulled pork sliders, sweet potatoes (tasted like Thanksgiving, cornbread, side of beans. Reasonably priced. Pack a wet nap and a bid and stop in for a cold one + some good BBQ grub.

Beer flights are pretty cheap and the selection is good! 5. they have pretty interesting cocktails 6. the food is... some of the best comfort food Seriously everyone needs to go to this place at least once if they live/visit NYC, I love the newer space the only I wish is that it actually faced the waterfront!

I could eat fried green tomatoes and drink flights of beer all day long if it weren't for that whole making a living thing. Insider's tip: (1) for parties over 2 it's worth using Open Table to make the reservation and (2) there IS a vege-platter option that isn't listed on the menu - it consists of any 4 sides and the collard greens are vegetarian.

It's very difficult for me to not give a restaurant that feeds you multiple types of meat five stars from the get-go. I visited Dinosaur about a year ago and had some type of heavenly platter that contained brisket, ribs and chicken. ?And while this was a while back and I realize the prices may have gone up, the meal was about $15 and worth every dollar. The guy sitting next to me said something about a "full rack." ?I politely said thank you, but it appeared he was ordering off the menu and not speaking to me at all. ?(Full racks were around $20). ?My bad. Beside the meat party that took place in my mouth, I remember enjoying a wonderfully strong drink called the Donkey Punch. ?It contained Bacardi 151, a liquor with whom I have a tumultuous history. ?Just wanted to mention this tasty mixed drink because I love drinking anything that sounds dirty. Dinosaur now takes reservations (they didn't when I first went there), which makes it an even more desirable restaurant to me.

I have been here many a times and felt like it was finally my turn to yelp out about the Dinosaur. ?I will keep it short and simple since I have narrowed it down to the select menu items I always get in some unplanned rotation. Last night I had wings (Wango Tango have the perfect amount of heat, you can always add the hotter sauces right there at the table) and the ribs. ?The sides of coleslaw, the salad with house dressing and mac and cheese were delicious. ?The rest of the table was covered with deviled eggs and a pork and brisket plate. ?The brisket and pulled pork sometimes tend to be inconsistent, except on any of the sandwiches like the porksket or cuban sammy. ? The other favs I tend to always get are the wedge salad and the two sammys listed above, you can't go wrong with either the porksket or cuban sammy or any other sammy listed. ?There is a great selection of beer by the bottle and on tap for anyone who likes beer with bbq. Keep pumpin out the good que DINO. ?I will always endure the wait and bare with your avg. service as well, cause the food is worth it.

Who would've thought you could find good BBQ in in NY? We didn't have reservations and ended up waiting about 30 minutes for a table on a weeknight. This place looks like it's packed every night. The portions are fairly large and delicious. All of the meats here are lip smackin' good and so are the sauces. The service here is excellent and the waitstaff is friendly. The boiled shrimp was kinda gross; oh well. Definitely be coming back.

There are better barbeque places in the south. There are none in the city. With a wide selection of choices, you can't go wrong. Pork, Beef, Chicken, Shrimp, Catfish, sandwiches, an amazing group of sides (the greens and mac n' cheese being particularly strong)... my mouth is watering even as I write this down. If you are a meat-lover and have not been yet, run - do not walk - to this Harlem-based restaurant. It would only be better if they had live music there... Oh wait. That's right. They do. BEER SELECTION: Great: over a dozen beers, with pitchers available at good prices. FOOD: Fantastic. SERVICE: Very good, but can get held back on busy nights. Speaking of busy nights, this place is ALWAYS packed. I have never been there without a 30-minute wait for a table, and it usually runs along the side of an hour. They take reservations through Open Table and on the phone, but I've heard this is a gamble. Instead, hang around the bar. There are raised tables that are first-come-first-serve that have the full menu. Don't be like those suckers outside waiting; listen to your ol' buddy Steele and sneak on in through the side. NOTE: The booze does rack up the charges, but the food itself is very appropriately priced. The biggest hits are on the steaks and full rack of ribs, which hover around the $28-$32 range. Everything else is $10-25.

Who would of thought you could find a decent bbq place in NYC? ?I recommended this place to a group of my friends solely based on the previous reviews...luckily, they were right on. ?The food is great, the portions are large and the prices are not bad. Because I was really hungry (and wanted to try as many meats as possible), I ordered the traditional sampler which includes a 1/4 rack of ribs, 1/4 chicken and 1/4 lb sliced beef brisket, 2 sides and a piece of cornbread...now that's what I call a meal. ?All of the meats were seasoned and cooked very well. ?The bbq sauce also added a nice tangy flavor, without being too overpowering. ?The sides were just as good, if not better, than the meats...one of my friends couldn't stop raving about them. In addition to the great food, the service was also pretty good and our waitress was friendly. ?However, we had to wait about 1.5 hours for a table because there were so many people at the restaurant. ?I also ?thought the prices weren't that bad ($15-$20) for a platter, depending on the meats that are included. ?I left this place very full and very satisfied and am very happy that I decided to take the advice of my fellow yelpers.

Let's put it out there, I'm not typically a huge BBQ fan. That said, Dinosaur BBQ is so delicious that it makes me change my tune almost immediately. Growing up in Syracuse, NY, salt potatoes are no strangers to me. In Arizona I often yearn for them and their salty, buttery goodness. On a recent visit to NYC to spend Thanksgiving with my sister, we headed to one of our favorite places in Harlem, Dinosaur. Mmm. On a regular day it was crowded but not so much so that we didn't get seated right away. I ordered the pulled pork sandwich with salt potatoes (naturally) and the mac & cheese as my sides. Let's start with the sandwich. It was PERFECT. Just the right amount of sauce, tender pork and a slice of cheese. The sides were equal if not better than the sandwich. Feeling ambitious we ended by splitting a piece of the Peanut Butter Pie. Hands down one of the tastiest desserts I've had at a restaurant. There is nothing I would change about this place. Go, and whatever you're ordering, make sure you have a little taste of Syracuse and get salt potatoes as your side. You won't be disappointed.

Yes! Dino BBQ! Great time! Went with two other friends on a Friday night and we each got ribs with the 2 accompanying sides and cornbread. A-maz-ing...delish. While I opted to "go all out" and forget the veggies (I decided on mac and cheese and whipped sweet potatoes), I'm going to have to say the best side was the succotash...grabbed a taste from my friend, and it was great. Don't let the vegetable content deceive you...it was tasty (and nutritional value was already destroyed from sodium, etc...mmmmmm). Drinks were strong and I wish I could remember it all, but I ended up having a ball that night...great eats, kickin' drinks, good prices, fun and loud atmosphere, casual vibe, a fun night! Just make sure you have a reservation, or else you'll be waiting at least 90 min at peak hours. Dino it up!!! T-Rex over and out.

After hearing all about this place from friends and family, i figured I would give it a try. ?When I called for a reservation a few days in advance, I was told that I needed to call weeks in advance! ?so, my friends and I decided to try our luck at coming in without a reservation. ?When we were told the wait was over 2 hours, we decided to get take out instead. ?After we ordered, we still needed to wait for over 30 minutes for the food and when we got home, it wasn't all I had hoped for. ?The brisket I ordered was cooked and the bbq sauce was put on after it was cooked, so there wasn't a ton of flavor. ?The sides were ok, my favorite was the sweet potatoes. ?My friend hated the beans and her ribs were not very meaty and a bit dry. ?Ultimately we liked it enough that we want to try it again in person, but I don't think I will be doing take out any time soon.

I hardly write positive reviews, but I have to admit, I love this place. The ribs are probably the best I've ever had in New York, and pretty much everything they serve tastes awesome, the only down side is that this is so far uptown, and If I didn't drive I'd definitely not make the trek, since without a reservation, this place is usually pretty crowded, even on weekdays.

Eh, I expected better. It was pretty good, but I can't say more than that, the ribs were my favorite but still not as juicy as I had hoped them to be, The sides did not impress me at all, The sweet potato puree was the best one, none of the others stood out, I actually didn't like most of the others. The corn bread was the best thing of the meal and having said that, that's pretty sad now that I think about it.

I 1st went here with some co-workers after work and was very pleased. I love BBQ food and had never gone to a really good BBQ spot until I went here. I must say I'm not a fan of there cornbread that they give with your meal or of many of there sides either, but other than that i love the ribs and chicken. I'm giving it a 4 star because a few times I had problem with seating, people being seated before me (after an hour long wait) just because they were friends of the girl seating people which pissed me and my mother off. Other than that its a great spot but they offer no dessert, and they have great signature drinks (alcoholic). I will advise you to go here its a great spot and great vibe. Very crowded on the weekends and most nights. Oh and closed on mondays which sucks hehe :D

It's a themed bbq joint that really belongs in suburbia, but I'm glad it isn't. Yes, it's a bit cheesy but you're not going to eat the decor you're going to Dinosaur to get you some ribs. I ordered the half ribs, half chicken, and brisket belly-buster meal with all the intention of taking home leftovers. Ribs were tender and well seasoned, the chicken was a bit dry. Brisket wasn't so memorable and the sides weren't particularly tasty, a let down since the bbq sauce and ribs were so delectable. A great place for ribs, as long as you can stand the cheese. I came hungry and left with the -itis.

I generally prefer to visit a place a few times before writing a review, however I wanted to add my thoughts about reservations and timing. Being a librarian, I keyword search. A lot. I keyword search Yelp for "wait" and "reservation" to find out how long waits can be. I am impatient and hate waiting. Thanks to all the helpful Yelp reviews, I called to make a reservation on Saturday at 6pm, before seeing a show in Harlem. Whoa! Was I glad we did. The place was packed when we got there! It reminded me of a suburban restaurant with the microphone calling out names for seating, the amount of families and kids, and the size of the place. We waited about 15 minutes before our table was ready. The food was decent enough- the ribs were really quite good, and the chicken was deliciously BBQed. The ?beef brisket was meh. We ordered the extreme sampler for two people and had enough of food. Would have liked some more of that cornbread. Great beers on tap! The location is pretty cool, close to the elevated 1 train, which is quite something to look at.

Four stars for the atmosphere and the service. I shared "the sweetheart special" w/ my sweetie - including 4 sides and a full rack of ribs. ?The ribs are great, the mac & cheese is fantastic (tho I think Blue Smoke still wins by a nose) but those Syracuse Potatoes... damn. ?I could eat those everyday for the rest of my LIFE! ?The slaw was good too. I have to say, my favorite things about the whole meal? ?The wings - SO meaty and flavorful! And the DESSERT - some kind of oreo chocolate pudding/mousse cake goodness that I really wanted to just stuff in my face.

The triceratops is delicious and filling.. ?the ankylosaurus was okay.. ? the chicken wings were awesome, and the mild hotness was sufficiently potent to wreak numbness and tingling on my tongue/lips. ? the ribs in my ode to elgin were fantastic. ? I also appreciate their fine taste in hubcap wall decor and pulp b-movie posters.. ? ?some places just don't get those hubcaps right, but dinosaur bbq does. ? !

My family has been going to Dinosaur BBQ since they opened here in NYC. Oh man this place is amazing! The quality is always there. The crowds are always there so make a reservation if possible. Things to order... mac and cheese- their mac is so good it should be illegal. I don't know what they put in it but if you get a choice of sides make them all mac. fried green tomatoes- so crispy and delicious. the sauce is slammin' too. don't eat them too fast or you'll burn the crap out of your tongue like I do every time. Get the larger portion and you'll be happy. ribs- mmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm ribs wings- wango tango mmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm wings salt potatoes- salt+potato=delicious DO NOT GET THE GREENS- they're gross. Seriously why are they vegetarian? They suck so bad. This place is also easy to get to by public transportation.

Disclaimer: I am a vegetarian, and probably not the best person to rate Dinosaur BBQ, as I am unable to try the full range of food offered. With that said, I can rate the restaurant and the food I had, and I'm gonna go with okay. ?I had the portobella sandwich, which came with zucchini and peppers on top, melted Swiss cheese and BBQ mayo (on the side for me, please). ?It was delicious, and I really liked the mayo (I never ever ever eat mayo so this is huge for me!) but the bread was just okay. ?I had a side of mac & cheese which was delicious - slightly spicy but definitely not enough as a side! ?I wish I would have ordered two sides of mac & cheese, because the "simmered greens" I also had were not good at all. ?Now I've never had collard greens, and I figured I would just take a chance on them, but the reminded me of sauerkraut (yuck!). ? The rest of the people I was with all seemed to really enjoy their food! ?The sangria was really good, but we were all put off by the service: an hour wait, which we figured we'd stick around for because we didn't know where else to go in the neighborhood. ?After about an hour, we asked about how much longer it would be and we were told our name had already been called! ?Um, all four of us were sitting in the waiting area ACROSS from the hostess stand - I'm sorry but our party was never called. ?We were told we would be seated right away, but they still called a party of four minutes later, and when asked why, we were told that the hostess "forgot" that she had told us we'd be next. ?What? ?Was she stoned? ?The wait was astounding also because I could see empty tables in the back area the entire time I was waiting. Service aside, I'm sure this place is great for carnivores (my dad loves the one in Syracuse) and I loved the mac and cheese and BBQ sauce. ?I would rather give it 2.5 stars, but I'll bump it up to three because everyone loved the meat.

I am happy to have found this place - well, actually, my gf and a friend found it, and what I can only assume was a sister restaurant in Syracuse was featured on the Food Network. Living on the UES, pork is hard to find. Good pork is even harder. Many places don't have it on the menu and ground pork is nearly impossible to find at supermarkets. So Dinosaur is like an oasis of good BBQ. The menu is great and has everything you would expect at a BBQ place. I wouldn't go here if I was a vegetarian, but there are plenty of options for those who eat fish/seafood, but not meat. There are a couple franchises around like Dallas BBQ, which I can't fault for what they are trying to achieve and filling that BBQ void in NYC, but Dinosaur goes the extra mile and earns every bit of its following. It has a great atmosphere, too. Now there were not the best ribs of my life, because my mom makes those, and even mine are better, but these are still really good. I would be more impressed if they were falling off the bone, but they weren't, which is one of the reasons they didn't get 5 stars. The BBQ fried rice sounded like a good concept too, but it missed. It is too heavy on random veggies thrown in there (including onion overload) and not heavy enough on the meat and BBQ. This could have been much better. The beans were all right and so was the mac n cheese, but they didn't blow me away. That said, they hit the spot with what I wanted at the moment, but they weren't 'must haves' or 'must tries'. I'd also like to go back for lunch and have some sandwiches, which all sound delicious.

This is the place where I go when I want to EAT! I constantly crave Dinosaur, though every time I've been there it's without a reservation, and there's always been an hour + wait. Though the loophole to that is there's no wait if you want to eat in the "bar" area (which has a bar, but also a ton of communal tables)--the full menu is available, and often no wait. We just make a beeline to the bar and hope there's room to sit (and there usually is!). I live for the pulled pork, mac and cheese, and cornbread. One night I went with a group of friends and tried every one of the signature cocktails on the menu--they're pricey but SOOO good! I recommend the Donkey Punch and the Whiskey Smash...they'll get you pretty smashed, for about $8/each. Skip the margarita--it's overpriced. I love Dinosaur--I only wish it was less crowded--but what can I say, New Yorkers know their food.

Oh, Dino. I so want to love you. Going to college in upstate NY, I have fond memories of trips to the Syracuse Dinosaur BBQ. But despite many visits to the DIno BBQ in Harlem, I usually leave somewhat disappointed. The brisket is tasty and reliable. But the sides are really were it fizzles for me. The cornbread is dry and forgettable (at best). The baked beans and salt potatoes are similarly forgettable and kind of bland. The best side is the cajun corn which is one of the 'vegetables of the day' so not always available. Also, the wait is usually very long so come prepared.

I always pass by on my way to Fairway but never stopped by because that was too much to carry back, but finally I got a chance to try Dino BBQ out. Placing an order for pickup was a never-ending phone cycle (probably because they'd just opened), but the food (when ready late after I arrived late hungry enough to eat T-Rex Ryan's leg) was unbeatable, even from my non-meat-eating-BBQ-lover POV. I've been to the Syracuse location, but the NYC one topped it, as I'd hope. Got the original fried green tomatoes, the creole spiced deviled eggs and the smoked portobello sandwich platter with Roasted Whipped Sweet Potatoes with a Spicy Nut Topping & the Creole Potato Salad, all of which were top-notch. Returned to dine-in with a group of 4 on a rainy day with an OpenTable reservation and a 30% off coupon from BlackBoard Eats. We were seated across from Omar Miller, it was absolutely SLAMMED at one of those times where only NYC restaurants could possibly be busy. UNSPEAKABLE numbers of quality beers on tap... CU Eminent Domain relocated it.

For BBQ in Manhattan, especially on the upper west, this is the best place yet. The chicken wings are nicely big and the brisket is juicy, but for me it's the sides. Their collard greens and Syracuse salt potatoes are amazing!

Looking around Dinosaur Barbeque on your average Friday night and you'll see the place packed with Columbia grad students, brave enough to venture into the outskirts of Harlem for over-priced beer and meat slathered with sugary sauces. I've never been there and not spent a great deal of time being ignored by the waitstaff. ?I've also never been there and found the food especially good: even simple things like hamburgers or pulled pork sandwiches are pretty flat. ?Truth be told - I lived about 3/4 mile away and I mostly went there for a lack of better options. ? And this may be the value proposition that allows Dinosaur Barbeque to persist in a city of food snobs. ?Althogh the food isn't anything to rave about, it is a clean place within walking distance of Columbia's student housing that doesn't attract many of Harlem's (oh, how do we say this politely ...?) unsavory residents.

Given that we're in New York, Dinosaur is probably what I should be expecting as the best the city has to offer. ?I wish it had better. ?Not that Dinosaur is awful, but I've had so much better for so much cheaper. ?Alas, this isn't the South. Despite the promise of wood logs and the smell of slightly burnt sweet sauce hanging in the air, the ribs tasted decidedly average, like it was grilled. ?All the meats were too dry like they've been cooked too hot or too long. ?The taste also primarily comes from the sauce and not the meat. ?It hits you with a sudden sweetness and leaves you with a sour vinegar aftertaste. ?The ribs and brisket were decent, but the pulled pork was limp, a little slimy and and definitely not worth it. ?Mac and cheese was fine, but greens were too sour. ?The wings, surprisingly, were the best food in my meal. ?My next visit will likely revolve around the wings, with the ribs as a side. ?Service was slow but polite. If I were to place Dinosaur's quality, it is slightly worse than what you'd expect from Luby's in Houston, TX, and about double its price. ?At least it is (slightly) better than Outback, though if I had to wait for more than 20 minutes for a table at Dinosaur I'd definitely be pissed to find this quality of food at these prices. ?The first couple of times I tried to eat here, there were 1.5 hour waits. ?I'm glad I didn't stick around! ?Alternatively, there is take out, and you can shop at Fairway next door while the food is cooking.

Went here for a birthday celebration and folks with deep pockets so in a sense I was in heaven. We ordered a few combo plates to try it all out and capitalized on the sides - Bar-B-Que Beans * Syracuse Style Salt Potatoes * BBQ Fried Rice Simmered Greens (vegetarian) * Mac & Cheese Cole Slaw * Mini Iceberg Wedge with Bar-B-Blues Dressing Fresh Vegetable of the Day * Fresh Cut Fries* It's best to make reservations.

The hostess was great as soon as we walked in. Got a "Hiiii--llloooo" greeting. It was a first for me but I liked it. -A lot of beers on tap. -More than reasonably priced -Wings were good (recommended by the waitress) -Chopped salad was blah. I would pass next time. Homemade ranch dressing was good though. -Ribs, Sausage, Lean Brisket & Pulled Pork were very average. ?Nothing special like we had hoped. -Dessert was amazing though! Simple piece of Sweet potato pie with pecans & whipped cream. REALLY well done. The service was REALLY REALLY REALLY good here ?though. Our server was: pleasant, knowledgeable, affable and attentive. Our bartender for post dinner drinks was: Witty, attentive, engaging and funny. While the BBQ is good here, it's not much above a Brother Jimmy's level. I would go back b/c of the overall dining experience and I would highly recommend it because of that. Whoever laid this place out and hired and trained this staff really knows what they are doing! This place is a blueprint for a well oiled machine. It's built for volume and handles it well. One bad thing. The extremely loud phone ringing can get a little annoying if you are close to it. If you are in Harlem or the UWS/UES , it is worth the trip. From Midtown or south, debatable. One last note: If you are in the service industry ?or thinking about opening a restaurant, I would highly recommend checking this place out. Logistically beautiful.

Homesick Texans should come for a taste of what we're missing down south!! Be sure to make a reservation because this place gets PACKED! The wait can be long, but well worth it. ?The bar tends to move a little bit faster for seating, if you don't make a reservation- shoot for a table there. Service is great, have always had attentive, patient waiters. The food is AMAZING!!! While I can't say it's the best bbq I've had (I'm a Texan afterall!), it definitely is a nice reminder of home. I love all the sides- collard greens, cornbread, mac-n-cheese... Order a plate of the fried green tomatoes!!!

I went with a group of 80+ for a friends birthday. We called in early to make a reservation.. and they said they had it all under control. We had also arrived early to make sure everything was in order. But it ended up being over a 2+ hour wait and while some were already seated and done eating.. others were still waiting for a seat. Overall its a great place to eat for a small group.. the price is reasonable and the portions are as big as you can ever want. ?Service is fantasticcccc, and i will return back.

Devils Eggs are pretty good also as an appetizer. I love their Mac & Cheese. Their drinks are good also, I always have a Donkey Punch. which is good, 1st tastes like juice but after 2 you start to feel the "PUNCH" lol Their beer selection is good, (if your into beer) I like the Dino Ale. Over all i enjoy coming to this place whenever i head out to the BX or City. Been going for the past 2 years and i LOVE IT =) ENJOY!!!!

Always tried getting into the old location but had to wait hours, but finally managed to get in this memorial day weekend during the lazy afternoon. ?Had a group of buds gathered after an early day bike ride down the hudson and what better location to accommodate the bike crowd. ?I have to say the space in the new location is huge and very accommodating for large groups. ?The atmosphere is festive and loud and just a great way to enjoy lunch on a weekend. Now as for the food, I think it was your standard bbq fare. ?Bear in mind I was fairly hungry already, but the food wasn't anything spectacular. ?We ordered the family style option which included the ribs, pulled pork, chicken and brisket, plus 3 sides. ?It was probably the best choice as it can feed 4-6 folks for under $70. ?it was a good deal and the service was pretty responsive. i loved the atmosphere and the food is good. ?would definitely come back.

After much hype and anticipation I finally tried Dino BBQ. I have long heard from many people about just how great this place is. Due to the location of Harlem, it took me some time to get there. I have traveled near and far to try BBQ so I know a bit about it. With that said, this is just average BBQ. Its what I call "Tourist-Q". Its good for non fans of BBQ and your average everyday tourist. This is fast food BBQ. Literally, fast. We order, I got up, went to the bathroom, came back and the food was being put on the table. I had the Tres Hombres which includes ribs, pulled pork and brisket. When I go some place, I want to sample it all. None of the meat had any flavor. No hint of smoke, no hint of rub..nothing. The sauce I will admit was good but in my opinion, if done the right way, you should be able to eat some of the meat and get decent flavor from it with no sauce added. If you are a BBQ fanatic, don't waste your time. There are better places out there. If you are the type of person who normally goes to a place like Chilli's for ribs, than this is the place for you.

Definitely worth the five, perhaps slightly less due to the wait (we were told 2.5 but took only 1hour), usually even 30 mins is too much but 1, we didn't reserve and 2, didn't matter that we had to wait as we could drink their FANTASTIC selection of beer and order food in the bar area. By the time we devoured the best tasting chicken wings (okay, we tried the wango tango which was very spicy but I couldn't help but eat one after the other, the sauce is DELICIOUS! We also tried the hottest one, Devil's duel, at first I was like, this isn't that much hotter until about 2 minutes later and you pretty much get side kicked! REALLY HOT! We had a fairly big group of 8, ordered 2 large plates of chicken wings, plus the small plate of the devils duel, the family option - 4 sides, pulled pork, some other pork, whole chicken, rack of ribs! HUGE! There were 5 fairly big guys and 3 gals AND there were still LEFTOVERS! We had beers and lots of margaritas (perhaps 4-5 each) and it cost us only $45-50 each! Could not believe it! Although it's in Harlem, 45 mins away, I cannot wait to go again!

Me and my buddies went straight into the family Stylin BBQ and got a platter of honey BBQ wings. Man that was off the hook! The wings are perfect and the Family Stylin came with full rack of ribs, a whole chicken, and pound of brisket or pork of your choice and three sides. Did i forget a pitcher of homemade sweet tea! Man this place is bangginn! Definitely worth the wait and the effort it took to come here! Craving for BBQ? check this place out man cus it's definitely worth it!

I saw this place featured on the Food Network (I wish I could remember the show); they gave it a good review as a non-touristy place in New York, though they do have multiple locations around the state, so it can't be that unique. The atmosphere is a little contrived, with street signs and other knick knacks on the walls, but the crowd is quite diverse including the original bikers but also bicyclers, tourists and plenty of Harlem natives. The restaurant is not too easy to find, or to get too, really, up at 131st Street in Harlem. V and I walked over from her office, which I thought would be a quick walk, but we ended up a little lost trying to find the place. Once we arrived, we were quickly seated, though there seemed to be a good crowd even for a Saturday afternoon. The menu is pretty simple, a lot of BBQ: pork ribs, and pulled, sliced and chopped meats. Pick one and a side or two and you're good to go. I ordered the ribs and V opted for the "Big Ass Pork Plate, pork shoulder smoked low and slow the 'ol timey way. Hand pulled & piled high." Both were very tender and had great flavor -- not too strong or burned and not tough on the outside. Plus the portions were quite sizable and satisfying on a hot day, along with a pitcher of beer. We picked some sides as well, including Bar-B-Que Beans, Syracuse Style Salt Potatoes, Mac & Cheese, and fries. These were good, but not amazing. The salt potatoes were the most interesting; whole little potatoes boiled and then pretty much drenched in salt and garlic butter. The butter and garlic was a little overwhelming and didn't make for the most appetizing side. I'm sure if the same ingredients were combined in mashed potatoes (and you couldn't see the grease) they'd have been much more satisfying. Overall Dinosaur Bar-B-Que certainly filled my summertime craving for BBQ. The meats were great, the sides okay -- I guess the way it should be. Plus the prices were reasonable -- now if only it were a little more conveniently located.

Okay, I would like everyone to keep in mind that I do not give five stars unless I am COMPLETELY blown away. I had a pal visiting me from Chicago and on the last night I had a craving for BBQ, as foodies, we searched all over yelp and through friends to find the best BBQ joint in the city. ?Kyle (Chicago kid) said that the spot had some pretty tough competition in Chicago so he'd be excited to see what we came up with. ?Thoughts of The Smoke Room in Fort Greene came to mind, but ultimately we decided on Dinosaur, boy am I happy with our choice. ? Pulled Pork sandwich, SO tasty, Syracuse salted potatoes and mac and cheese made me a very happy happy lady. ?I also had a beer (which the waitress did forget, but it was busy so I understand) but she quickly apologized and brought it to us. ?Michelle was a great server and I had fun with her. Kyle had the 1/2 chicken and 1/2 rib with two sides. ?Potato salad and mac & cheese with a beer. ?The potato salad was good (although I was partial to the buttery sauce of my potatoes -- mm) and the mac & cheese had a great texture and quality to it. ?He said the meat was quite tasty as well. ?However, the cornbread was not tasty, he said. ?Pretty dry. ?To the point he said "eh..." at it. We finished it off with Key Lime Pie, I had wanted a crumble or a peach cobbler (which they don't have), but the crumble had blueberries in it, which I am allergic to. ?The key lime pie was nice and light (as both of us were STUFFED). I didn't really mind the neighborhood at all either, I was distracted the whole time doing my crossword there and back. :) would go back in a heart beat, even if it was just for the potatoes.

I have heard wonderful things about this place but I wasn't impressed. I had a cuban sandwich w/ potatoes which were pretty yummy and their mac & cheese which tasted like Kraft to me. The fried green tomatoes were a hit and so were the wings. My cousin had the ribs and said they were very yummy as well. Oh...we also had the banana coconut pudding for dessert which was also pretty good. Overall this place is ok but the service wasn't that great and the food wasn't mindblowing so three stars it is. ?They do have a variety of beers on tap and the wings and ribs are good so if you're with your buddies and want ribs/wings & beer on tap this may be the place to go - if you can get in. I hear that on weeknights as well as weekends there is a pretty long wait.

While I didn't leave this place feeling it's certainly the best bbq in NYC as many claim it to be, I'd say the BBQ here was good. I think I still prefer RUB over Dino. I ordered the following: Ribs: Good but RUB is way above this Pulled pork: Pretty good Brisket: I'm not a fan but perhaps that's just cos I'm not a brisket fan at all BBQ beans: which tasted good but nothing fantastic. Just regular baked beans with meat in my opinion Creole potato salad: (hoping to have some sort of big chunky red skin potatoes but it turned out to be like mashed potatoes. A little disappointing). I was rather surprised to find quite a crowd (though less than 20 peeps) here for lunch on Tuesday. Don't people work ??? ;p

Best BBQ ever! It is totally worth the trek from Queens to Harlem. The creamiest mac n cheese, the most tender and flavorful meats, and a huge selection of tasty sides (the syracuse salt potatoes are my second favorite). ?They have a big beer selection, I recommend the flight so you can try a few. On the down side, the service isn't great but the food makes up for it. It's always crowded so you MUST make a reservation, and even then you should plan to wait a little bit. ?If you come without a reservation the bar tables and outdoor picnic tables (weather permitting) are first come first served. Don't be scared by the bathroom walls full of writing, read em and enjoy. I get the same thing everytime I go, but I have tried everyone's food and it all makes me happy. ?Fried green tomatoes are a must! ?Fill up on the food and don't bother with dessert, it's generally disappointing.

Love this out of the way place in Harlem. ?Great BBQ, grilled wings, live music, extensive beer selection, and potent Donkey Punch that will knock you on your ass! The wait is hell, even with a reservation, but in the end, worth it. ?Even better is the collection of bikers whom gather here with their hogs - a place to be seen.

DBQ I fell in love with you in Rochester. ?The NYC version does not disappoint. ?Be sure you go on an empty stomach because as the reviews make reference to "it is hard to stop eating" The ribs are cooked for 24hrs. ?What else do I need to say? The Dino sauces is delicious. ?Defiantly worth the trip.

They should pass little snakies around while people wait... ha! Neverhteless, its a great place to hang out and eat... BIG TIME EATING! I usually get the sweetheart deal... yum!

I know my rating goes against the grain of most but I'm just not a fan. My lack of support may have to do with the wood taste or the pre-cooked dry meats that turns me off; but hey not everyone has to eat there--right? They have a nice menu and the place is always packed, service can be interesting depending on their personality. The people from Upstate NY swear by this place and the folks at Cornell University are jealous to find that Columbia University has one in their backyard. First timers be sure to try the - FRIED GREEN TOMATOES, they are good.

Over the weekend a friend of mine and I decided to try this place out. ?I've heard about their food for years and I was due to pick a BBQ bone or two. ? From my friends, this place was a hit or miss but I have to admit it wasn't bad when I went. ? The place looks like something you'd think would come out of the Bayou in Louisiana (which, from my own personal experience doesn't really exist). ?The ribs are good, but not as fully smoked as I'd like. ?The chicken was far better. ?The brisket was basically how you'd find it at most BBQ joints. which tends to be overcooked, but thankfully not like cardboard here. ? The drunk spicy shrimp boil is suggested, if you don't mind spicy. ?It is very tasty and the fact that they offer it per scale pound rather than per piece was a plus in my eyes. ?Generally most places don't give you enough. ?The fact that they give you the option of ordering 1/4 a pound at a dollar discount was a good choice. The fried green tomatoes were also tasty, and thankfully not as vinegary as some tend to be and also not as wet. ?Good call. The mac and cheese unfortunately was a bit too dry for my friend and my taste. ?Mac and cheese should be creamy, not chunky. The yams were a good call though. ?Not overly sweet, just right. ? As for dessert, we got the banana coconut pudding, which was good, but would have preferred it as a simple southern banana pudding with perhaps sweetened toasted coconut on top. ?It seemed like the mixture of coconut banana pudding swallowed up the banana taste until you bit into a large piece of banana. ? A good meal, however when they tell you it's going to be an hour/hour and a half wait, look at the restaurant to see if the time fits the crowd. ?I believe they generally tell everyone that, but the truth of the matter is it might just be a 20 minute wait instead.

I'd like to thank my wife for introducing me to this place. The ribs were so incredibly good. Normally, at a joint like this, I would pick up the ribs with my bare hands and do a number on them. Unfortunately, I was unable to do so due to a horrible tooth ache I was suffering from at the time. As a result, I had to be all civilized and eat the ribs with my fork and knives. Normally, I'd say that this ruin the experience but everything was so good that it didn't make an ounce of difference. The taste of the ribs was greater than the pain in my teeth... and I was in a lot of pain. Those were some good ribs!

Ordered the Dinosaur Brew which was very tasty and for lunh I got the BBQ Pulled Pork Sandwich with the Soup of the Day & Mac & Cheese. BBQ Pulled Pork Sand was AMAZING, tender & juicey The Sausage Onion soup was great even on a hot day As for the Mac & Cheese I've had better.

Everything in life is relative. Spending $5 to sit in the back seat of a plush, ripe, BO-smelling cab to go 30 feet in rush-hour traffic seems quasi-reasonable when it's pouring out, yet that same $5 might represent 50 miles in gas on a rural highway somewhere after midnight in the deepest recesses of the Southeastern US. To that end, Dinosaur BBQ is one of those businesses that tries to bring something -- in this case, authentic southern BBQ -- to the heart of Manhattan. I'm not sure where Dinosaur ranks in favor of the best that Austin, Dallas, Kansas City or Memphis has to offer, but I do know this: everything on their menu -- while pricey -- is not only delicious but patently unhealthy, incredibly filling, and ultimately memorable. Besides the fact that Dinosaur recently moved across the street (from its original location to 700 W 125th, diagonally across), the hour- or two-hour-long wait is still an exercise in patience, but the wait remains worthwhile. A small run-down of the best things on Dinosaur's menu: the ribs. Holy god, the ribs. A half-slab of this sampling of perfectly-smoked delicacy should rightfully inspire a trip to any of the aforementioned cities for comparison. Of course, everything else on the menu is quite nearly its equal: the brisket, the pulled pork, the chicken, and of course, the sides: drunken shrimp, macaroni and cheese, fried green tomatoes, BBQ beans, cole slaw, the syracuse "salt" potatoes -- it's all just amazing. It's unhealthy and makes no apologies for its indelible damage to your overall well-being, but there remains something to be said for consumption of these types of foods sating the soul. Dinosaur -- even in its pricey, unhealthy, long-delayed sitting -- is worth a visit, a return visit and many subsequent return visits. Relatively speaking, I'm not sure that Dinosaur would be #1 were it dropped in the BBQ meccas of Austin, Dallas, Kansas City or Memphis. However, given a twenty-minute cab from the Upper East Side, Dinosaur is -- by far -- the best option in NYC proper. The only caveats: bring plenty of cash and a big appetite -- both are required, along with an hour or two wait before feeding begins...

Having Texas BBQ since a child, I cannot in good conscious give Dinosaur BBQ 5 stars. ?That being said, it is the best BBQ I have had in NYC... and it has restored my faith in eating BBQ on the East (I'm still looking for the experience for TexMex... both of which I used to wait for my return to Texas to eat after so many disappointing attempts. The wings were excellent. The Ribs and pulled pork very good. ?The sides were asi asi.. some stand outs: Friend Green Tomatoes and Mac & Cheese ?as well as the beans. The beer selection is excellent as well as the liquor. They have Buffalo Trace which is a go to for me at home. ?Also, after a few beers I ordered the Harlem Cider which is on their fall menu. Perfect drink for the season and went surprisingly well with the BBQ. The new building is nice even though we all felt like we were in the burbs... someone even mentioned Texas Roadhouse..... Service: Very friendly, welcoming and helpful

What can I say? As a Dominican who rarely stops eating his basics (Arroz, Habichuelas, y Pollo), I must say, if you want something extraordinarily good come here. Had no time to sit down and eat, I did Take-Out but OMG! The ribs were as Mark M. said, ORGASMIC.

Made a reservation on opentable for 12pm. ?Went on a rainy sunday during lunch with a friend expecting a great meal. ?Arrived around 1245pm. ?The restaurant had a few people. ?Didn't need to make a reservation. ? Anyway, having heard so many reviews here and there, I was really looking forward to eating at Dinosaur Bar-B-Que. ?Just getting there was quite a trek... but that's another story. ? For starters, we ordered a plate of 5 Original Fried Green tomatoes with pecorino romano cheese and a side of cayenne buttermilk ranch dressing. ?The tomatoes had a nice crunch and went well with the dressing. ?They weren't oily nor soggy, which is always a plus when eating fried food. ? For our entrees, both my friend and I ordered the 1/2 rack of ribs (6 ribs) with two sides and cornbread. ? I got the Creole Potato Salad and the Bar-B-Que Fried Rice. ?The ribs were okay. ?I've had better. ?While they did fall of the bone quite easily ?I would have preferred a more 'saucy' rib. There was sauce, but not enough for my taste. ?Towards the end, the ribs did get a little bit salty. ? (Note: Dinosaur BBQ did have several sauces on the table but I didn't try any. ?Personally, I prefer sauce that is infused in the meat, rather than having to slather sauce from a jar) ? The potato salad wasn't your typical potato salad. ?In all honesty it looked like mashed potatoes but tasted like a potato salad should taste. ?It was nice and cold and refreshing. ?Not heavy at all. ?The Bar-B-Que Fried Rice tasted to me like asian fried rice, just a general comment, nothing good or bad. ? I enjoyed both sides. ? In hindsight, I would have ordered the 1/4 Rack of Ribs instead of the 1/2 Rack... ?(I ended up taking the leftovers home) For sides, my friend got mac and cheese, as well as Roasted Whipped Sweet Potatoes with Spicy Nut topping. ?Both had a weird flavor that we couldn't quite pinpoint. ?Again the sides were 'okay'. ? I don't know why everyone says this place is soo good. ?It was really "okay" at best. ?Both of us agreed that the Fried Green Tomatoes were the highlight of the meal. ? Having read many reviews on yelp on the tomatoes, I would definitely agree that if you go, you have to order them. To be honest, I still don't understand all the hype about this place. ?I really don't mind walking, but Dinosaur Bar-B-Que is pretty far from the train (15 minute walk from W.125th and B/C line) and the food is, as mentioned many times in this review, 'okay'. ? Glad I tried it, ?but I probably won't be coming back.

Decent BBQ. The fried green tomatoes were amazing! The place is packed so plan ahead. ?We were hanging out by the bar area when they called our table, and by the time we were able to pay our bar bill & make our way through the crowd to the front, they called Last Call on the table. ?WTF? ?After they seated us, there was some confusion on who our server was. ?Don't come here expecting quality service.

Mac & Cheese is the best I've ever tasted. ?Pulled pork, brisket and wango tang wings are reccomended. ?I am not a rib person but they look great and everyone tells me they are really good. ?Peanut Butter Pie for dessert is pretty good.

I had the ribs and my boyfriend had the pulled pork, but the ribs were the star, really. We also had the deviled eggs and the wings, both of which weren't the best I've had but really, really good. :) Overall, a great place, especially for the money and how ridiculously full you are after.

i'd love to give it 4 stars but i hate, hate, hate the wait! i've been here on so many different nights at different times and i can never seem to escape the wait. one time, i've waited nearly 2 HOURS to seat 4 people on a weekday at 8pm. it was TRULY ridiculous. we only waited because we kept saying, "we've already waited 30 minutes, 45 minutes, 1hr, etc. etc." but at that point, we were ready to walk down a couple blocks and eat mcdonalds. despite this being a BBQ place, the pork and steak aren't that good. ODD. the chicken however is GREAT. fried green tomatoes are really good too. and i like the sides as well. their sauce is good so just slap that on everything :) the drinks are nice and potent. oh and guys, they have sports on every single tv in the place so you'll be plenty entertained. and did i hear karaoke? too much. haha.

Big open woody atmosphere. Prices and food are average. Servings are large. We're that impressed with the ribs or chicken, because we found the flavor too smokey.

Dinosaur BBQ is a great place to have in the neighborhood, but my experiences there have been mixed. Based on my first trip there, I would've given them 4 stars, but based on my meal last night, I wouldn't give them over a 2. If you are thinking of coming here without a reservation, STOP! Both times I've eaten here, I've had to wait over an hour for a table, last night it was one hour and forty minutes. We showed up early, and not too hungry, so we weren't deterred when we were told it would be an hour wait. Also, the place is really loud and servers are always pushing their way through the crowded waiting area with full trays of food - so it is hectic to say the least. The Service: The restaurant was super busy last night, so I'll have to give them a tiny bit of leeway on the terrible service. Our server was distracted, left my water glass empty for a long time, and ignored my attempts to get his attention. He even spilled a bunch of water on my shoe when he first arrived at the table, and even though he looked down and noticed the spill, he didn't acknowledge that it had happened or apologize. The Food: I saw a few "quick tips" on here indicating that I should try to fried green tomatoes, so that was first on our list. Unfortunately, we could've done without them. They could've been mozzarella sticks for all we knew! The breading was way too thick and reminded us of frozen food breading, the tomato slices were white (not green) and flavorless, and the dish was served on top of a few pieces of scattered lettuce with unmelted mozzarella cheese shreds haphazardly thrown on top. The one redeeming moment of the night was when my sandwich came - the Bacon Brisket Sandwich I ordered was very tasty. Thick bacon, melt-in-your-mouth brisket, melted swiss cheese, and a not-too-spicy chipotle mayo. I ordered a side of salt potatoes, and was equally impressed by their far-from-bland flavor and perfectly tender crunch. My fiance is a big fan of the mac and cheese, and his sandwich was equally pleasing. So if you are planning to eat at Dinosaur BBQ, make a reservation, avoid the fried green tomatoes, and enjoy - everything else on the menu will probably be delicious.

Ribs were excellent, one of the best I've had. Nice casual atmosphere, good selection of beers, big tables, good bang for the buck. ?great place for groups. ? The Bad: ?You may have to wait even if you made a reservation. (45 minutes for us) The side dishes we're not as good as the meat. ?The mac and cheese tasted like it was from a box and it was also a bit spicy. ?The cornbread was stale and the other sides that we tried were just OK. ? Overall, my experience with Dinosaur was good. ?I think the BBQ meats at the place were very good but they can improve on the sides. ? But I would come back here.

I have been eating at this place almost one a month since I moved to NYC - last September - so see my shock that I have not yet once reviewed it on Yelp. I was introduced to this place from a coworker last year and I am glad that I made the walk in the freezing cold to find out if this place really is worth all the hype people were putting on it. The answer was yes, yes it was worth the hype. Being someone who does not eat meat - save for seafood - I was really impressed with their menu selection. The Peel and Eat shrimp is one of my favorite meals - the shrimp has just the right amount of spice and salt that I enjoy. The mushroom burger is good as well - the bun is near perfection and sitting on top of the patty is a heavenly mix of peppers and cheese that just scream fabulousness. I cant help but rave about the sides. The Cornbread is great, simple corn bred. When I make cornbread at home, I usually add some cheese, peppers, and onions, but the cornbread at DBBQ is just simple and tasty. The Collard Greens are great as well - salty, but not too salty. Speaking of salty, please try the Syracuse, Salty Potatoes. The sauce the use with the potatoes are to die for. I am not sure what is it in, but it is worth the try. They have a great selection of beer - I would suggest the Dino Ale - at an affordable price. I would really suggest making a reservation. The first time Warren and I went on a Saturday night, we had to wait about two hours to be seated. In the mean time, we pulled up to the bar and enjoyed beer and beer after beer. Even with a reservation, though, please expect to wait at least 15 minutes after your reservation time. The bathrooms are a hot mess, but fun to read all the graffiti people have left behind. I cant wait to get my ass back there soon.

The food was fine...satisfactory...borderline good. It seemed "over-seasoned," if I may use such a word. I had a platter of meat and although it was well-cooked, the "over-seasoning" (especially on the sides) was unnecessary. However, the food was still fresh and worth the price of admission. ? ? ? ? ?

Easy to get there right off the subway. BBQ is easily one of the best in the city. Make reservations on opentable to avoid a wait. The chicken was a bit bland but still very very good. The ribs were amazing i wish i ordered more. Mac n Cheese was unique and delicious The Beans were out of this world Corn bread wasnt that great. Fried Green Tomatoes were delicious Service was prompt and friendly. Beer was cold and large selection.

The wait can be long - unless you make reservations like we did on http://OpenTable.com - we still waited 5 minutes, but vaulted ahead of many. We went on a Tuesday night and table service itself was friendly and very good. This was a week or so after FLOTUS Michelle Obama visited. We brought our 3 year old. He loves dinos and the kids menu is a trio of dinos and you get triangular crayons. Very good service and support there. Animal heads and knicknacks on the walls help. Ordered the sampler for two - you get two of each: Fried Green Tomatoes were breaded and very good with a rémoulade sauce. Chicken wings were HUGE - meaty and good. Deviled eggs - nice. 3 peel 'em Shrimp (XL 16-20 size) - good spices. Entrees were not huge - so plan accordingly if you have larger appetites or order the BIG plates. Sliders - brisket and pulled pork. ?You could wolf these down by the basketfull - $4 each. Skirt steak with Chimichurri was very good. So they can grill and BBQ here. Sides were all excellent. Mac&Cheese. Whipped sweet potatoes are quite sweet - my wife prefers mine (with more butter & cream but no added sugar). Will try the BBQ fried rice next time. The BBQ sauce is very good - mild heat and spice with the sweet/vinegar tomato base. It apparently does not have much sugar in it and def none of the crap. It's for sale and worthwhile. I used some on some prime rib @ home in place of horseradish cream sauce. The beer selection is extensive - but not as great as a Old Chicago or a craft bar. I had a (correctly labeled) flight of four and two drafts. The right offering for the BBQ set (Checkered Cab and others). I would give this place 5 stars but it is just short... though I cannot name a better slow BBQ place in NYC. If their fried green tomatoes were the best... or if it was a super value... but I will get chicken next time and see... it is definitely worthwhile and a fave spot just MAKE A RESERVATION if heading for dinner. Otherwise, be prepared to wait and hang at the excellent Fairway grocery next door.

My first DBBQ experience came in Syracuse when a local family member told me I had to go but said I would have to wait 2 hours to get a table. ?I thought that sounded miserably but was nonetheless curious. ?I had seen local supermarkets carry the DBBQ sauces but never tried it. ?So we went and of course there was a huge wait. ?But that didn't matter. ?They had live blues playing and a great selection of beers and microbrews at the bar. ?The two hour wait came and went and we were finally seated. The experience at the restaurant in NYC is the same as Syracuse. ?The menu is overwhelming. ?At first you want everything: pulled pork, ribs, bbq chicken, wings. ?Luckily they have sampler platters so I get my wish (though, it's better if you share it with someone else). ?Gotta try out all their sauces - I like the wango tango. ?For appetizers I'd get wings or the fried green tomatoes. ?For sides, I'd get the mac n cheese, mashed sweet potatoes, or mixed vegetables. ?For dessert, you just can't go wrong.

Before I left for Vermont the week before last, I finally got a chance to go to Dinosaur BBQ. Everyone I know kept telling me they had the best BBQ in NY and I had to go.. so me, Ron Stew, and DJ Radio trooped it out there to see why everyone was so hype. We set it off with some appetizers.. I ordered the Deviled Eggs and they ordered some Wings.. the eggs were beyond salty.. it's like they poured a cup of cajun seasonings on top of each egg.. so I was glad I only ordered 3. The wings on the other hand were the best wings I've had in NY so far!! I actually had to order a separate to go box of them just to take home.. actually I feel like I want some more as I type this.. lol.. My entree.. I ordered the Korean Style Ribs (why, I don't know) I should've known better, this is not a korean restaurant so why do it.. but since korean food is my favorite cuisine, when I see them on a menu, my eyes see nothing else.. so I got them.. and honestly, mine taste better at home.. they were just okay.. nothing special at all.. the sauce they used on it was like a basic teriyaki sauce.. and you could tell they didn't even marinate the ribs.. the sides weren't that impressive either.. ?I'll say that the sweet potatoes were good, I guess.. but the other side I had isn't worth mentioning.. so after this review you probably are sayin.. why give them 4 stars.. and the only reason I am is because of those W I N G S!!! they were that good.. trust me.. everything else.. mediocre..

Dispite the fact that I had to wait an hour and a half to get seated, I will still give Dinosaur five stars. That's how good it is. ? We didn't have reservations and that was our mistake, because this place is packed on a Thursday night! All of New York seemed to be there. It was difficult to sit still and be patient, because waiters with plates full of food would pass us by and we were salivating! Pluses: ?Sweetheart rib deal for two (full rack of ribs with four sides). Sampler for two (fried green tomatoes! Yum! Old bay BBQ shrimp. Yum yum!, BBQ party wings. Oh boy! Deviled eggs...wow, so good!). ?BBQ baked beans are too die for. Mac & cheese was very cheesy and peppery. Liked it alot. Sweet potatoe with pecans. Yum yum! The dessert, apple and cranberry cobbler was excellent! I ate like a pig and the bill was only $55! You can't beat that. Ok: cole slaw was nothing to write home about. I would definitely go back in a heart beat.

Although I had to wait an hour and a half to be seated, the wait was well worth it. I recommend the chicken wings! Definitely the best in the city - No doubt about it. The chicken is perfectly good and the sauce - one of a kind. Share the plate of thirteen and split the sauces, because you don't want to miss out on them. Also, try the combination platter - It's great and affordable. The service too, despite the amount of people crowded in the restaurant, was great - Our waiter was always near us and brought us what we needed almost instantly. Like Southern food? You definitely have to try this place!

More of a Texas style and not NC style, but amazing. The sampler platter is a good call as the brisket and ribs are super good. Fried green tomatoes and peanut butter pie are great starts and ends to a good meal. Helpful tip, if they tell you you have to wait for a table for awhile...GO SIT AT THE BAR AND ORDER FOOD.

According to our Southern dining partner, this is legit stuff -- besides the fact that it was just plain delicious. We're docking a star ONLY BECAUSE one of us (one!) thinks that the plating wasn't gorgeous, but the food really was great. We split the half chicken and the brisket with jalapenos, and added sides of succotash, salted potatoes, sweet potatoes with nut topping, and mac 'n' cheese. I wasn't crazy about the mac 'n' cheese (I felt there was a weird aftertaste), but that's not enough for me to change my vote. Ambiance was fun, and service was relatively quick considering the massive wait. MAKE A RESERVATION. You will still wait with a reservation -- you'll just wait a bit less.

great bbq place. will definitely be back. i tried to make reservation for dinner time but no luck so i ended up with the 3pm reservation. walked in there and it was packed!! so i recommend making reservations ahead of time to save yourself from the long wait. parking wasnt that hard, just go up thh street or up the hill and u can find something. ordered the sweetheart deal and had the appetizer sampler for two. the appetizer sampler for 2 was kind of small. it had 2 wings (so good), 2 fried green tomatoes (MMMM), 2 devil eggs, and four shrimps. it was so good. for our entree, it came with four sides. we had mc n cheese, baked beans, bbq fried rice, and cajun corn. the food was so good and the ribs was excellent, the meat actually falls off the bone. i will definitely be back. oh and the price is actually decent. pretty cheap considering we ate all that and it only came out to 40ish.

I was born and raised in Buffalo, NY and those mild BBQ wings are yummy and comparable to some of Buffalo's best wing joints. Thanks Dinosaur BBQ!

I want to start with the good, the Arnold Palmer (sweet tea and lemonade) was excellent! The meats ( I had ribs and my friend had the chicken and it was unanimous that the meats were done well) were smoked very well and was a good starting point. According to my friend, the lemonade was bad. I had four sides ( greens, baked beans, Mac n cheese, and salt potatoes) none were good. My cornbread had an intense salt center but everywhere else was dry and tasteless. The baked beans were more like chili, the Mac n cheese was a fail, the veggies needed some meat sorry but there was little vegetarian dishes on the menu and Southern greens need ham, turkey, something, the salt potatoes were ok if you slathered it in the butter that it came in, and the sauces were a couple seasonings shy of being good. I have experienced good BBQ and this was not it. I'm from Florida and I know now not to bring anyone here. I did bring the ribs home but I plan to cook it down a bit in more seasonings, and a better sauce. Definitely not worth the hour ride from Brooklyn.

Is it a good bbq joint? Definitely. I do however think it's overhyped. The wings are amazing and the sweet potatoes were out of this world, but the ribs didn't impress me so much - considering this place is know for it. Also, I found the brisket to be dry and below average. So while there are some great items on the menu, it's not a mind-blowing experience.

I think, I think visiting Atlanta too many times and getting even a whiff of real Southern BBQ ruined Dinosaur for me. The BBQ here is a pale intimation of the real deal, as any of my Southern friends can attest to. The exultation of Dinosaur as being exemplary BBQ probably won't stop anytime soon, but I'm telling you, there's better out there. Though probably not in NYC.

If you have a car, go there! great food, atmosphere somewhere between a midwest BBQ joint and a dive bar. Prices Amazing (where else can you eat a god BBQ dinner for $20 a person). good variety of beers and they have a 'beer sampler' which is pretty cool. without a car you can get there but not that easy. with a car you can park in the large parking lot of fairway and get to do grocery shopping in a supermarket where vegetables actually have taste

Lots of wonderful things to say about this place. My friends and I like to hang out here on Fridays after getting out of work. The atmosphere in mid-afternoon is really relaxing, and there's a good happy hour from 3:00-7:00 PM. I switch over to the bar area around 4:30-5:00 (fantastic service at the bar, as good as it gets). Once you get to know the staff, both at the bar and out in the service area, they are almost like another group of friends once you chill out there long enough. I would suggest the dino burger with a mac and cheese side, along with the soup of the day, the chili and the pulled pork sandwiches. ?The only knock on the place is that it doesn't serve dessert...they'd be pretty good at that too! About the crowds...the place gets really packed between six and ten at night, and actually starts to clear a little bit when the house band plays (and their music is really good). I would suggest it for anyone wanting a quick bite as they are commuting out of the city.

So, I haven't actually eaten at Dinosaur yet, though I'm quite excited to try it. ?No, the reason I'm writing this review is the bar, which has the best selection of beer north of Columbia that I've seen yet. ?While the selection isn't as varied as Patrick Ryan's 22 taps, it seems to rotate more often, and contains more excellent beers. ?My girlfriend and I have become beer snobs recently, and usually have to trek down to the Village to get our fix, so we were quite pleased upon discovering Dinosaur's solid selection. They were just closing up shop when we arrived this past Sunday night, so I can't comment on what the crowd is like, but I will say that Manny, our bartender, was a way cool guy. ?Prices were about what we expected them to be -- $6 for a pint of Chelsea XXX Black Hole Stout (~7% ABV), for example. If you live uptown, like good beer, and don't feel like trekking all the way down to Blind Tiger or Jimmy's No. 43 all the time, definitely check out Dinosaur. ?(Being right across the street from the greatest supermarket in the world doesn't hurt, either.)

Ok, so I have to preface my review by saying that BBQ is not one of my favs but went here with a group. We landed in on a Sat night with no reservation. We were told the wait would be 2 hours for a 6 top. Usually we'd never wait this long but we didn't know of any other options close by so decided to go for it. 3 hours later we were finally seated. At this point our bellies were so full of drink we could barely eat, or speak... Vibe - packed to the rafters with people from all walks of life. Be prepared for a lot of jostling as you wait for your table. Seating - Well, for the wait period you're highly unlikely to score seats. We were lucky to find a high table to cluster around. When you finally get to your table there's plenty of space. I'd go so far as saying that our table was a little too big for our group leading to some people feeling left out. Alcohol - I enjoyed far too many glasses of tasty Sangria. Food - food served on plastic plates is just not my thing so I could only reach a certain level of enjoyment. That said, my food was tasty and I was reliably informed by other group members that this is as good as BBQ food gets. They thoroughly enjoyed theirs. I should also add that the house shouted us some free wings on account of our ridiculously long wait. A nice gesture but a plate of wings couldn't rescue our night. Our spirits had been so dampened by the time we were seated we simply ate and went home. Not what we'd planned at all.

This place is always packed, and for good reason. ?The food is fabulous. ?My boyfriend and I have been eating our way through the menu (him more than me--he's a meat-eating man) and we still have to go back so I can eat a lot of the pulled pork. Must eats: -Fried green tomatoes--they could fry up shoe leather in this batter and would be tasty -Chili on the half shell--spicy and slightly sweet -Syracuse salt potatoes (offered as a side)--not as underwhelming as they sound, buttery, flavorful goodness! Avoid: -Simmered greens--too sweet for my taste, though I appreciated the vegetarian option --Whipped sweet potatoes--not very smooth and not as sweet as I wanted Other than that, order what you like! ?Even the burger was good--firm and juicy says the burger-loving boyfriend. ?But don't get the sandwiches if you mind hamburger buns as that is what they are served on. ?I love'em though.

RIBS. RIBS. RIBS. RIBS. RIBS. RIBS. I dont know about the rest of the menu, but the ribs are amazing - juicy and flavorful on the inside, blackened with bbq sauce on the outside. We got the Sweetheart Deal for Two, which comes with a full slab and 4 sides. Started with fried green tomatoes, and a few pints. Jesse sampled a few of the sauces available, but I didnt want to do anything to the flavor. The sides were nothing to write home about, but the fried green tomatoes were better than expected. Also, the pint selection was great and seems to rotate. The deal was sweetened with the option of beer flights. Next time I probably would forgo the extra sides and save room for more ribs. Jesse says he would try more of the other meats, but I only have room in my heart for RIBS. ahhhh..... RIBS. RIBS. RIBS. RIBS. RIBS. RIBS.

Came here with a group of friends on a rainy, Tuesday night. ?I thought that there wouldn't be such a wait because the weather was so bad but when we got there there was a wait of an hour to an hour and a half! ? When we finally sat down we ordered the four of us 13 chicken wings, deviled eggs, the sweetheart deal for two ribs, and the pork brisket plates. ?For the sides, we had the mac & cheese, simmered greens, roasted whipped mashed potatoes, potato salad, and the french fries (side came with the brisket plate). ?For drinks we ordered a pitcher of the sangria. ?The wings and the eggs were ridiculously good! ?The ribs were definitely to die for and the briskets were good but a bit on the dry side. ?All the sides were good but wasn't too fond of the simmered greens. ?The sangria was good but nothing to brag about. ? Overall I would go back again except I would make reservations.

THE BEST, I MEAN THE BEST FREAKING BBQ IVE HAD IN A LONNGGG TIME.. the wait is pretty long but WELL worth it. the ribs are so moist both pork and beef , the mac and cheese is the bst ive had at a restaurant, the carrot and raisin salad is a light nice side treat. honey hush corn bread could be better (i.e. more honey) me and the MR lovee this place and we crave it almost every other weekend. its reasonable ($45 for two) and the ppl are very warm and welcoming. always very crowded so be ware to wait at least an 1hr. they have outdoor seating so if you dont wanna wait go for it.. the drinks are also as generous as the food!.. and OH yea the cupcake they sell at the takeout register is awesome! simply the best bbq spots in NY

I'm jumping on the bandwagon. I can't help it. The food, the beer, and the dessert forced me!! I've tried the various BBQ joints in town; this is up there nera the top. It's a very casual and fun atmosphere. The food is spot on, I have to agree with the fried green tomatos, chicken wings, deviled eggs, ribs, brisket, and cobbler (was peach/blueberrry) were very tasty. I'd never had fried green tomatoes before, so that was a first. But a first "good" experience. The wings, they're big, crispy and not over-sauced. How could that be better? Deviled eggs, zOMG!! Almost good as Mom use to make. They have that salty eggy yummy flavor. Serious good stuff. The ribs were tasty, they had a lot of flavor with a good sauce. They were cooked perfectly and they had tons of flavor. Serious good stuff. Now the brisket, I love my brisket. I can't stand places to where it falls apart from overcooking. This place is not that. I'm talking the brisket had a nice smoke ring on 1 side and then a nice layer of fat ont he other side to balance out the tasty bite. Definately in the top 2 of the best beef brisket I've had. For dessert we had the cold box chocolate mud pie and the seasonal cobbler. The cobbler was perfect, you can definately tell that the peaches were in season. There was that yummy natural peach flavor.... essentially the people I was with dog piled my cobbler since it was so tasty and left the cold box chocolate mud pie to linger until the end.

Came here on a Monday afternoon at 3:30. I had a reservation but it turns out that I really didn't need one seeing as the place wasn't even half full- lucky me! I ordered the chicken wings (mild) and the coleslaw and mac and cheese. The coleslaw and wings arrived 12 minutes later but I had to wait and extra 15 for the mac and cheese to hit the table. I was annoyed at the extra wait time but when I found the coleslaw too sour, they allowed me to replace it with the whipped sweet potatoes free of charge so I didn't complain too much. As for the food: Mac and cheese: Pretty good! I would order again Coleslaw: Good texture, but too sour for my taste Chicken wings- A ok. Got the job done Sweet Potatoes: Good but prefer it without the topping Oh, and the lemonade was excellent! I would probably return just to try the ribs.

Tried to call several times to make a reservation but each time was transferred to nowhere and the phone just rang and rang and rang. The person who answered the third time I called was pretty obnoxious, wouldn't help with the reservation, and again transferred me nowhere. Then tried to go online to make a reservation but couldn't access their online reservation system at all as the website said it was unavailable. I guess they are too busy opening new locations all over the place to provide any basic service anymore, as evidenced by the number of reviews here mentioning the poor service. Too bad as I like their food and they used to have good service. Will no longer be bothering with this place.

You know, I went there a couple of months back and I'm just now writing a review for them so I'm gonna keep it lite. The atmosphere was awesome, spacious, and vibrant. You just know you walked into an official restaurant. I was excited. The service was great, professional and friendly. I wish I could remember my waiters name so I could give him a shout out. He was great. He kinda looked like a young richard dreyfuss. I didn''t drink but I'm sure they have great cocktails. How could they not. Me and my date ordered if I remember like a lovers platter. A whole rack of ribs with 5 sides which were tasty, pretty much what I expected, but getting to the ribs, I'm going to be painfully honest, they were good BUT I've definitely tasted better. Sometimes the hole in the walls in the hood are where the best ribs dwell but overall, the food was good. No complaints. Will definitely be back. Great date spot or for out of towners wanting to get away from disneyland, I mean, times square ?or just wanting to explore a different neighborhood. I gave them 4 stars because personally, the ribs aren't as good as 5 stars gets but still, they were good. Get'em Harlem!!

Ladies and Gents let me introduce you to Dinosaur BBQ!!! This is the bbq place New York City has been in need of for a very long time! The reviews speak for themselves and the pictures tell what the reviews don't!! Every last side, especially the fried green tomatoes, the salt potatoes and the macaroni and cheese are eat in and order a few to go. (Yes they are that good!!!) Swag Sampler and the traditional sampler is the go to platters. The bar area with the television and raised tables and chairs are superbly layed out! Bathroom with the numerous "I was here" and "I love Jake" writings on the brown wooden type walls are unique. Check this place out!!

This is a great place to come with friends as it give an opportunity to share the food. Good size portions, great service, awesome food! I do advise making a reservation for this place. You can wait up to 2 hours for a table. Its a diverse crowd since many Columbia students frequent here. If you haven't gone-make your reservation and go now!

Finger Licking Good!! You want BBQ ribs, you come here! ?Ribs can't get better than this! ?So tender and tasty! ? If you eat huge portions, go ahead and order the 12 rack. Otherwise, the 6 should be enough. ?For your side order (included with your ribs), try the pork beans are and the Mac and Cheese. ?They are delicious! Dinosaur BBQ is a very casual kind of place. ?Think almost of your cool neighborhood bar, but with lots of tables serving great food. ? One downside, IT"S ALWAYS CROWDED!! ?People love this place, so don't go there when you are starving, cause it's common to have to wait up to 45-1 hour to get a table. ?Put your name down, and go for a walk on the pretty boardwalk a block away on the Hudson River if it's a nice weather and build up that appetite. You can eat at the bar if you are lucky to grab a chair after someone has left. ?And there are communal tables you don't need to put your name down for; but it's the same as the seat at the bar. ?You have to be vigilant of a spot opening up to grab it...and hope that someone else has not yet claimed it. ? Fun to go with a small group. Anyway, if you love BBQ ribs, you have to get to this place. You won't be disappointed if you are patient.

Ok it certainly aint worth the 1hr 30min, i could get similar quality food without the wait. The ribs were delicious tho and the sides were more like ehhh.... another thing that was good was our waitress she certainly was fun and on point... They need better sitting arrangement no reason why table should be open for more than 5 min seeing how busy it gets... if its slow go if not look somewhere else.

I havent actually been to this location but had them at a catered event at SiriusXm. they brought out ribs and pulled pork and when i tell you I was licking the bone, im not lying! The BBQ is some of the best I have ever tasted! I even brought back a menu (to DC) so that i could remember how good the food was the next time I come back to the city! It only takes one word to describe the meat at this place: YUMMMMMMM!!

This is an amazing restaurant, barbecue or otherwise! ?It's kind of hard for me to review it as a barbecue restaurant because I was so tempted by the Ultimate BLT (of which I was only able to eat half) that ?never got around to trying any of the barbecue at our table. ?So what was this Ultimate BLT that distracted me from my original intention of trying what some people have recommended as the best BBQ ever? ?Well, this was some bacon, thick and smoky, some romaine lettuce, some mayo and FRIED GREEN TOMATOES! ?On a sesame seed bun. ?It was huge like a burger and filling like a burger, and certainly like nothing I've ever eaten before! ?We started out with some appetizers: deviled eggs and salmon cakes. ?Both delicious. ?My sandwich came with two sides and I chose mashed sweet potatoes and coleslaw. ?Great choices. ? ?Excellent meal, hence five stars.

I can't believe I haven't written a review for Dinosaur yet. Then again, there's not a whole lot I can say that hasn't already been said. The last time we were here, hubby and I split the Sweetheart Deal: a full rack of ribs and four sides. We got the greens, roasted whipped sweet potatoes, bar-b-que fried rice, and the fries. The ribs were not falling off the bone, as other reviewers have noted, but the meat was incredibly flavorful and so tender. I didn't add extra sauce to the ribs because I like to taste the smokiness of the meat, but that's a personal preference. I did pour out a little bit of their Wango Tango Habanero Hot sauce just to taste it, and it had a nice sweet heat to it. The fried rice was a little on the greasy side, though the irony of complaining about something being greasy as I'm downing half a rack of pork ribs is not lost on me. The fries were good. The sweet potatoes tasted like dessert: so smooth and light, like a sweet potato mousse. I could have eaten it all afternoon. The greens were surprisingly tasty. I'm used to collard greens being cooked with ham hocks, but their completely vegetarian version was not lacking in flavor. I was thoroughly impressed. Our server was fairly attentive, and was able to recommend a beer to me that I really enjoyed with the food. We were customers since they were at the old location about a block away, and we'll definitely keep coming back.

Just came back from the restaurant. My favorite BBQ place in New York. The food is just outstanding. However, management has no clue how to run a place like this or they are just not interested in making money. They could easily service 50 % more people if they would get their act together. Two little girls are in charge of seating people and they just don't know what they are doing. Although there was an average waiting time of 1-1 1/4 hours, tables were frequently empty for 10-15 minutes before the next party was seated. While we were waiting there was a two seat table empty for an entire hour. In the mean time, they put parties of two in booths that can fit four ! Finally seated, the service today was really lousy. The waitress would just dissappear for extended periods a t the time.

The best BBQ in the NY Metro area. ?I absolutely love this place. ?Always bring out of town friends here and they love it. ?Do not be scared by the Harlem address, it is well worth it and i have never seen, heard or experienced anything shaddy (have been here over 30 times in the past 5 years and my 2 yr old son has been with us over 5 times). ?The wings are a must have. ?I sometimes think about just ordering wings because they are so good, but then I can't stop myself from ordering the Ode to Eldgin! ? Wings: ?smoked, big, absolutely amazing! ?The wango tango sauce has a bit of a kick. ?If you get the hot....your better be able to handle it because it made my eyes tear (and I can typically handle hot wings). ?The wings are always a reliable pick. Deviled eggs: damn good. Ribs: sometimes are better than others, but always delicious. Mac and cheese is great, but you should always order the Syracuse potatoes - they pop in your mouth and are smothered with Cajun butter...yummy. Dessert - please save room....the peanut butter pie is my absolute favorite dessert anywhere and the sweet potatoe pecan pie is WOW good. You must have a reservation for a Friday or Saturday night....otherwise you will be waiting long - it gets packed in there! ?Also, you must call two weeks in advance for a prime time (6-9pm) reservation. ?The hostesses up front have been doing this for years and they are great about taking care of you. ?The addition of the "we will text you when your table is ready" is also pretty cool. ? The bar gets packed, but sometimes you can squeeze in for a meal. Highly recommend Dino BBQ!

I live in lower Manhattan, but was up in Harlem after a job interview and decided to go here for lunch afterwards because I'd heard such rave reviews. This place definitely lives up to the hype! I ordered the BBS (Brisket, Bacon, Swiss) sandwich and fries. A lot of times I find brisket to be dry, but I didn't have that problem here at all. It was flavorful, and not overly fatty. The bacon and swiss were quite good too, and I loved the selection of barbecue sauces at the table. The fries were well-seasoned and crispy. Definitely one of the better barbecue meals I've had. I actually went here on Halloween, which added to the fun atmosphere because several of the staff members were wearing costumes. I also got free candy with my meal.

Life would be so much easier if I were smart................. Case in point, if I were smart I wouldn't have procrastinated and come here sooner. Yes it is a hike from downtown or Brooklyn and yes it's worth it. The only disappointment ?in my meal was the cornbread. Not so much bad as bland and boring. Everything else I ordered or tried was very good to excellent. I like that the sides are not afterthoughts as they are in many bbq places. The creole potato salad was great. It had a very nice tang to it sort of a cross between a deviled egg and potato salad. The mac & cheese was a little soupier than I'm accustomed to, but still tasted good. I love the dry rub ribs, tender, juicy without much fat. I liked them dry but a variety of sauces are available if you like your ribs wet. The spicy sausage was well..... a spicy sausage. Not as hot as a texas hot link, but very good. While I doubt this ?would be destination for vegetarians, if there are any in your party there is a smoked portobello sandwich plus a variety of sides to choose from. Dinosaur BBQ also has a fully ?stocked bar, even though on my visit I stuck with sweet tea. No I'm serious. I really did. And it was good. Many reviews complained about the wait for a table, so it should be noted they now take reservations directly or through Open Table. If I were smart I would've ordered more food. Not because my meal wasn't enough, I was stuffed and didn't eat again that day, but because this is a place you want to take a doggie bag from. I spent Sunday watching sports wishing I had brought some ribs or chicken home from Dinosaur. If you like BBQ don't be like me or the tin man, head to Dinosaur BBQ now.

I came here a few years ago, within the first few weeks of its opening, with a friend who apparently knew someone who owns and/or manages the place, we got completely intoxicated and I didn't really remember the food -- though, until my recent visits, I (for some reason) generalized Dinosaur Bar-B-Que as having very good beef ribs, so I suppose I actually did eat something after-all... A couple weeks ago I decided to come back with a friend -- there was a 2 hour and 45 minute wait (while waiting we walked around, went grocery shopping, had a couple drinks elsewhere) but after dinner I didn't regret a single second of it... We split the Swag Sampler Plate for two, it came with a few slightly-spicy peel-and-eat shrimp that were pretty good, a couple chicken wings which were extremely succulent, a couple fried green tomatoes which were terrific (even addictive, I thought about them for days afterward), and a couple deviled eggs that were extremely delicious... For my entree I got the Traditional Sampler which came with 1/4 barbecue chicken that had amazing charred skin and was super moist, 1/4 rack of beef ribs (which came in a much more generous portion than you'd expect) that were just fantastic, a few slices of Texas brisket which was extremely tender and juicy and flavorful, and some just-what-the-doctor-ordered cornbread (which I find superior here to other versions found at similar establishments offering comfort food) -- plus some excellent not-too-sweet very-meaty baked beans and some extremely delicious not-too-creamy yet not-too-chewy mac n' cheese that somehow only gets better as it cools (which is usually the opposite of how it happens -- I was craving this day and night for a few days following) -- A LOT of food for NOT A LOT of money... My dinner companion got the Big Ass Pork Plate and cole slaw and mac n cheese, all of which got rave reviews. On a return visit there was absolutely no wait, we got a couple pitchers of beer (Dogfish Head Raison D'Etre for cheap!!!), had the fried green tomatoes (which were just as good as I remembered them, perhaps even better), got the deviled eggs (which were very good but just not as exciting as the first experience), and for my entree I had the Bar-Be-Que Reuben (oh my god the meat was so smokey and luscious and mouth-watering, and it's topped with really good coleslaw and tasty Swiss cheese) with carrot/raisin salad and mac n cheese, and and my comrade got a 1/2 rack of ribs (which are lean and wonderfully spiced and supple and fall right off the bone, though may not have been as juicy as some people might prefer, but to me they are just perfect) with salt-boiled potatoes and mac n cheese... It's pretty obvious I'm a fan of this place, that explains why I'd give it four stars, but what justifies me giving it a fifth star? The service! One time I couldn't make up my mind what I wanted to order, so the waiter brought over a very generous sample to help me make up my mind. Another time, when I was done with my meal, there was a misunderstanding, perhaps I was drunk and not very clear with my words, so rather than packing up the remainder of my food the waiter threw it away instead, and when I said I wanted to take it home, without any complaint or visible dismay, the waiter came back a few minutes later with a brand new whole portion of my meal in a to-go bag! And on the way out a manager made small talk with us and asked us to come again soon. This makes me feel at home, this makes me want to come back often, and this makes me feel that the over-all experience is pretty much about as good as it gets.

I am not crazy about barbecue, but I did have a lot of fun here with Ryan M. and his friends for his birthday. Delicious food, and good company make for a merry time. Come hungry as the portions are huge. Come thirsty, since everything is better with tons of beer and they have quite a good selection of those!!! I would recommend making reservations since it is always packed in here, even on weeknights, though one can wait at the bar without a reservation.

I came here with 5 people on a Thursday night with a 9PM reservation. ?We waited about 20 minutes to be seated, which is annoying but we expected it. ?After being seated service was great. ?We stared with the fried green tomatoes, chinese hoisin wings, and wango tango wings. ?The wings were probably the best i've had in the city. ?They had a great char on them and the perfect amount of sauce. ?I'm not an expert on fried green tomatoes, but these were amazing, you definitely need to try them. ?The five of us decided to split a bunch of entrees, so we went with the sweetheart deal for 2 (full rack of pork ribs and 4 sides), the big ass pork plate, the texas brisket plate, and the korean style bbq beef ribs. ?As sides with went with the mac and cheese, bbq beans with pork, cole slaw, and potato salad. ?I thought almost everything was great, definitely the best bbq i've had in the city. ?The only thing i wasn't a fan of was the pork ribs. ?They were very chewy, the meat did not fall off the bone, you had to really rip it off. ?The korean style ribs were awesome and perfect for sharing, but the ribs are really small so i wouldn't recommend just getting those for a meal. ?They have some tasty sauces on the table that i tried on the pork and brisket. ?I'm a big fan of the wango tango sauce, has just the right balance of spiciness and sweetness. ?The mac and cheese was definitely my favorite side, it's so cheesey. ?I was a fan of the potato salad and beans as well but would probably skip the cole slaw next time. ?This was one of the best meals i've had in a while. ?I definitely recommend coming with a big group so you can share everything.

It's 10am the day after I had dinner at Dinosaur and I'm still ridiculously full!! Our waitress, Noemmy, was fantastic and made some great reccommendations. We ordered quite the feast considering there were only 3 of us...wings, wedge salad, pulled pork, 2 racks of ribs and 5 sides. The honey bbq wings and salt potatoes were my favorites, but the carrot salad and ribs were close behind. The pulled pork and mac n cheese were ok, but neither were served hot enough (temp, not spice). We were all really excited for the sweet potatoes, but they came cold and we were really disappointed. Luckily, our waitress saw that we had barely touched them after knowing how much we wanted them and quickly replaced them with the salt potatoes that we had decided not to order. Even though we wanted to try everything on the dessert menu we were too full to order any. Since my friends had told the waitress my birthday was the next day she brought out a slice of key lime pie with a candle on the house. It was amazing. I'll be back soon to order honey bbq wings, salt potatoes, carrot salad and key lime pie. Until then I'll just have to reminisce about that awesome fat kid dinner!

My eyes welled with happiness when I put the first bite of pulled pork in my mouth. ?I freakin love everything about this place. ?The staff is friendly and unpretentious, the decor is ?kitschy but homey, the beer selection is great, and the food of course it the best part... I went there on a Sunday afternoon and enjoyed a Guiness at the bar while we waited about an hour for a table (no complaints). ?We shared our orders of pulled pork, ribs, brisket, and sides (bbq beans, mac and cheese, collard greens) plus cornbread. ?Everything was well seasoned and delicious with different styles of bbq sauce to add if desired. ?The only complaint was the brisket was a little fatty and was my least favorite of everything, but still pretty good. ?We also got a sampler of beers while we waited for our food. ?Meat and side plates range $13-$20, and sandwiches range $7-$10. ?It opened in Dec '04 and it seems to get really good business. ?And now the crushing part...

Extremely disapppointing - Dinosaur BBQ is extremely overrated and definitley not worth the trek up to Harlem if you live downtown like me. The cornbread was dry, mac n cheese lukewarm and not cheesy enough, fried rice flavorless, and the brisket was dry. The ribs were good, but not phenomenal in any way - and the deviled eggs were tasty, but were a little too mustardy. Two good things to note: the bbq pulled pork was the best of all the food options, and WAS good, but again, nothing particularly special, and the banana pudding was delicious - the only thing on the menu that deserved more than three stars. The drinks served in mason jars are strong and some are actually really good - but overall, not really that great at all - plus the waitress was sassy (which, I guess, some guys like).

After years of build up, I finally ate here last night. ?While not exactly what I was expecting, I'll fondly recall the pulled pork for years to come, so I suppose it was worth the wait. Speaking of waiting, expect to wait when you come here. ?For a long time. ?Even if you have a reservation. ?It was very annoying to be crammed into the waiting area for over an hour, even though we had reservations. ?Granted, we were a party of 14, but it shouldn't take that long if they have been expecting you. ?I remarked to my dining companions that I found some comfort in the fact that, millions of people in Middle America were doing almost the exact same thing - standing around waiting for a table for hours - except that they were doing it in Texas Roadhouse instead of Dinosaur BBQ. ?This sparked an intense debate over wheather or not the decor here was a little too reminiscent of chain restaurants, or if it was kitschy, and why do chain restaurants in the Midwest always have such long wait times? ?Is the Olive Garden really THE place to be on a Friday night? ?Who waits 90 minutes for an Outback steak? This is how we continued to kill the time until we were seated. ?Once we were seated, it was an entirely different experience. ?Our waitress was quick and amazingly accurate for having such a large table. ?She was well worth the gratuity included, plus a little extra we threw in. And the food. ?Oh, the food. ?I was torn between the Big Ass Pork Platter and the Pulled Pork/Ribs combo; I opted for the latter, but strongly recommend the former. ?The pulled pork is tender, flavorful and covered in the perfect amount of the BBQ joint's famous sauce. ?The ribs were only mediocre by comparison (gristle and fat rather than meat), and next time I won't bother. ?I had french fries and macaroni and cheese as my sides (I know, I know, I should have had a vegetable in there somewhere) and while neither were particularly spectacular, both were satisfying and decent. ?But seriously, nothing compared to the pork. ?You just have to get it. Everything was decently priced and this is definitely worth a trip to Harlem if you're craving some BBQ. ?Just be prepared to wait.

Hands down the busiest BBQ place I have ever been to. Generous portions and reasonable prices make you think you're down south enjoying authentic Texas-style ribs and chicken and brisket. (Yes, we had it all) Absolutely delicious.

BEST BBQ EVERRRRRrrrr om nom nommmmmmmmm My bf took me here for my bday dinner and boy was I excited. Took the 1 up to 125th street and I was salivating just thinking about this place. We didn't wait too long on a Monday night but we also had a reservation, which is recommended. ? The venue is pretty big and open. You get to see the cooks in their kitchen right by the catering/take out order station. On the right hand side when you enter is a huge bar with a giant list of beers. We got seated immediately by the kind hostess and ordered our beers - him an IPA and me the belgian - both very tasty. They also have six point which we enjoy. We then ordered the 13 wings platter - half garlic chipotle and half wango tango. My bf went to the bathroom, literally gone for a minute..and suddenly the wings come out. Good thing he peed fast because they smelled amazing and I was inching towards a wing. First bite was AMAZING. These wings are probably the best non-fried wings I've ever had. Both sauces were delicious. Garlic chipotle's spice really builds on your tongue but it's not overwhelming to the point I was sweating bullets. The sauce also tastes more like a traditional buffalo sauce whereas Wango tango was sweet and tangy. After we finished most of the wings (btw they gave us 14 wings instead of 13 so we each could have an equal amount - :)), we got our 3/4 rack of ribs, sweet potatoes with spicy nut topping and mac n' cheese. At first the corn bread was dry but I liked it by the end because it offset the meat festival. Sweet potatoes were delicious but I wish the nuts were chopped and mixed in. Mac n' cheese was awesome and had a kick! Probably our favorite of the three. The ribs were SO tender, fall off the bone. I tend to not even like ribs but it's probably because I've never had amazing ones like these. I ate half the 3/4 which I never do. The bones were licked clean! At first we thought we couldn't eat anymore but then the waiter suggested the banana pudding. It had so many chunks of banana and didn't taste artificial at all. I tend to like nilla wafers crushed into my banana pudding but the vanilla cookie was fine. Not the highlight of the meal but still good! Overall the meal was one of my favorite birthday meals :). ?One star off for the waiter forgetting our beers and being a little distracted. He was courteous but could have smiled a bit more.

O. My. Jesus. That is probably the best Macaroni and Cheese I have ever had. I would push random strangers to have it again. I had been here once or twice before. And after going to Hill Country for dinner, and discovering they don't serve a bbq sandwich during dinner hours, I was ready to take the train to Dinosaur with open arms. The bbq sandwich was great. the mac and cheese makes you wanna slap someone, and the donkey punch (rum and 151 drink) is priced well and delicious. I also remember having the spicy garlic something-something wings a while back and they were fantastic too. I was disappointed when I called to make a reservation and was told "we don't do same day reservations." That is stupid. If I want to come to your place, and you won't put me down for a spot, and you have an hour wait, guess what, you aint gettin' my money. :) Bottom line: get the mac and cheese... and some sweet tea.

Anyone who gave more than 3 stars...does not get out much. Its was Aight but not outstanding BBQ. The food was cold when it arrived to the table. My cuz had a Ginger ale that was flat. Appetizers : The Samler Deviled Eggs were good. Shrimp was good. Not too salty. Chicken wings were tasty but it was cold. Fried green tomatoes were excellent and crispy. Flavorful. The dipping sauces were good. Entrée: My cousin had the brisket. He gave it two stars cuz he likes his meat to have texture. He could not differentiate between the fat and the meat. Good brisket doesn't have fat. He felt the flavor was ok. Mac n cheese was cold but if it was hot it would have been more enjoyable. Sweet mashed potatoes was average. I had the sampler with chicken, ribs and brisket. Cornbread was dry. The brisket had a medicinal/ metallic taste to it. I was thinking acetone at the time but metallic is more like it. However, the meat was moist and easy to chew. It would have been my favorite if not for the metallic taste. The chicken was decent/basic and it was the only part of the meal that was hot! The ribs were good. I enjoyed it. Mac n cheese was too cold for me to eat it. But I can tell I would have enjoyed it if they were served hot. The Collard greens was OK but I wouldn't suggest anyone order it. We ordered an extra side of beans so we can both try it. They were very elementary. Like the kind u get in your elementary school cafeteria. Haha! But all jokes aside, I've had better beans out of a can. ?Sorry Dessert: Caramel apple cake was really good. It taste very similar to carrot cake. Coconut banana pudding was Slamming. Try it! So... I'm not in a rush to go back but if I'm in the neighbor Hood and my friends are in the mood for dinosaur bbq ... I would order the appetizer sampler with a full order of fried green tomatoes and the coconut banana pudding. However, it wasn't worth the indigestion!

Although it is a little on the pricey side, you can't beat their Que! ?This is hands down one of the best Bar-Be-Que joints in the city! ?i've never had a bad experience at this place. ?The seasonal beer selection is great also! ?If you are going with a large group you have to make reservations well in advance because the wait will probably be long.

I've been to a handful of BBQ places in NYC because I think I was a Southern girl in another life. lol ?This place is one of the best that I've been to so far! Because I have Summer Fridays hours, my husband and I decided to head up to Harlem after my shortened work day to check out Dinosaur BBQ. We arrived after the "normal lunch time" and the place was busy. We were seated at one of the few empty tables. The table and chairs were wet and sticky (???) After we were served our drinks, we ordered our food. My husband ordered the brisket sandwich with a side of mac 'n cheese. I ordered the pulled pork sandwich platter (2 sides - mac n' cheese and sweet potatoes). They arrived quicker than we expected. OMG! The smell was intoxicating! :D ?My food was mouth watering. I wish that I would've left room for dessert! My husband wasn't too fond of his sandwich because he said that it was fatty. I wish that they would've had hush puppies on the menu. We will definitely be back again soon! :D

The restaurant was easy to get to by public transportation, about 3 blocks from the train. ?We had reservation (which I HIGHLY recommend) so only waited about 15 minutes for our table. ?The food came quick and was DELICIOUS. ?He had the ribs (to die for), mac & cheese (better then your usual), fried rice (tasty but just OK), salt potatoes (went well with the ribs) and fresh cut fries (we ate these all up). We were there on a Friday night so there was a live banf playing which was WAY too loud but other then that we had a great time. ?We didn't try the alcoholic drinks but many people were having them and seemed to be having a great time.

I was visiting a friend in the Harlem area and he suggested that we go try this BBQ place near his house for dinner due to the reputation. Being from Texas, I was hesitant first because obviously no BBQ/southern type of food in the New York area will be nearly as good as having it in the south. However I was starving and I am always open minded to giving anything a shot. TIME: We went around 8:00 PM to have dinner. I had heard that the wait can be long but shouldn't be too bad. The hostess had mentioned that it was going to be a 20 minute wait however that didn't happen. ?We ended up waiting for an hour and 15 minutes before they finally sat us. ?Even as we sat people were still coming in. ?Hopefully this was a sign of great tasting food, and that the wait was worth it. FOOD: When we finally got a table, I decided to try an original pulled pork sandwich platter which comes with two sides. I was suggested to try the beans and pork and the Mini Iceberg Wedge with Bar-B-Blues Dressing. The food came out rather quickly, being a BBQ type of place I expected everything to come out rather quickly. There really isn't much preparation needed to compose a plate in these types of places. ?When I finally got down to eating the food, I would have to say that it wasn't bad, but it wasn't anything that blew my mind. ?If you are not from the South, I would consider the place a decent location to get BBQ style food. But if you are from the south, you've probably have had better. Its just as good as having anything from Rudy's or Spring Creek BBQ. ?The pulled pork was your avg juicy/moist decent sandwich. And the beans and pork were flavorful. ?The Iceberg wedge was literally just a wedge with a sauce you dip in which was so-so. ? SERVICE: The service was below-par. They came to take our order and serve us water however, due to the size and the lack of servers, the service may seem slow or insufficient. ?They only seem to start coming when you gesture or yell across the room, or when you seem like your about to leave and trying to get a last minute impression for additional tip. ? SUMMARY: Overall I give the place a 3 out of 5. It just seemed like an avg BBQ place in the north. To Northerners it may seem like an awesome place for BBQ style food. But to southerners, its just your typical-what we expect from bbq style restaurants food. ?If your in for a craving for bbq this is a good place to go. If you are expecting more, then expect for a disappointment. The atmosphere seems like that of a Chili's-TGIF-esque. It is a great place to hang out if you want a couple of beers. They have tv's, kareoke, and live music from time to time. The bar area is a size-able area. ?In my book, I probably will not come back unless I am just missing BBQ and homesick of southern food. The Food Was not worth the wait.

it took us an hour and a half to get here from brooklyn (that sucked) we waited an hour for a table (that sucked) we got seated outside in 45 degree weather with 60000% (haha) humidity (sucked even more) but.... OMG. the food here is hands down the best in terms of BBQ food! The waiting and heat were definitely worth it. I think I left the place in a coma for I do not remember anything after my first bite of pulled pork. All jokes aside, Dinosaur is a must try if you are visiting NYC or live there and haven't ventured out. I had ordered the brisket + pulled pork main with two sides : mac & cheese and coleslaw. the dish came with some cornbread as well. the meat was tender, juicy and melt-in-your-mouth. i couldn't believe that something that is so common (pulled pork) could be done in such a way that would even astound me (i am very critical of pulled pork). I also have to comment on the cheesiest, most indulgent mac & cheese i've ever had. It was so gooey and delicious I felt like I was going to see stars after each bite. Everything was fresh, well done and scrumptious. The drinks were good as well - a nice compliment to the heavy dishes. The rest of my party had ribs with a mix of sides from raisin carrots to home fries. I can safely say that my taste-buds are totally spoiled now and BBQ will never be the same for me.

Decided to try this place out for my son's birthday. Though the wait was long, (you do good to make reservations) it was well worth it! The ambiance is just perfect for this barbecue joint. The food was delicious and the waiters were very nice. I've added this to another one of my favorite BBQ places. Would definitely recommend! Please take my advice and make reservations or be prepared for a wait!

A friend of mine did his research on this place and had a bunch of us go this past weekend. In short, it was awesome. I had my reservations (because I love BBQ I didn't want to set the bar too high), but I could tell it was a winner when I tasted some of their delicious beers while waiting for our table (with a reservation). The place is popular, and it does not surprise me: the BBQ is excellent. I had a tasty meat medley consisting of some pulled pork (amazing, really), meaty and oh so moist ribs (truly excellent), and brisket (great, but behind the other two). Surprisingly, though, is how earth-shatteringly good the sides were! The Syracuse potatoes blew my mind and the mac and cheese shocked the shit out of me (I mean, really, mac and cheese?!?! Yes, seriously, I am still coping with good it was). The only thing so-so was the corn bread, which was a bit dry, but I couldn't eat everything on my plate anyway. The service staff was nice and attentive as well. I skipped dessert because I was so full of meat, but my wife had some peanut butter pie, which was good. My fried had their pecan-encrusted sweet potato pie, though, and that easily kicked the other's ass. I could go on, but the point of this is that we all enjoyed the meal very much and will definitely go back. ?Oh and the prices were very good (surprisingly so).

Tucked away under the bridge across from Fairway and the famous Cotton Club, this location of upstate NY's Dinosaur BBQ can be a bit hard to find if you go strictly by the address and is a journey from most places in the city in any event. ?If you take the 1/9 to the 125th Street stop, it's about a 10 minute walk west. ?If you fall off the island into the Hudson, you've gone too far. ?Look for the honky-tonk roadhouse joint covered in grafitti - the one with the neon Dinosaur on top. But back to the food...which is, in short, pretty awesome. ?The garlic chipotle chicken wings are not for the faint of heart, but if you like spicy food, they are a must. ?I can usually handle the spicy stuff right up there with the best of them, but these had my eyes watering and my head sweatin' in pleasure. ?The half BBQ chicken has a subtle, smokey flavor, though sometimes isn't as juicy as I'd like. ?The ribs rate among the best in the city - right up there with Daisy May's. ?For sides, the potatoes are tender, salty and delicious. ?In an interesting and successful twist, the rich and creamy mac n'cheese is also slightly spicy. ?Add in a nice selection of draft beers and friendly, attentive service and you have a great place to get BBQ in NYC. ?And when you get the bill, you'll realize another reason why the hike out to the boondocks is worthwhile - this place has a seriously favorable value to food satisfaction ratio. ?That's right - Dinosaur passes the savings in rent along to you, loyal customer.

I lived in West Harlem for well over a year before I got my butt down to this place. Friends raved about it so I went in with high expectations and they were met and then some! I've never had Fried Green Tomatoes before my visit (so I can't compare to the 'real thing' down south) but oh my god, my taste buds were in heaven! The Deviled Eggs and Wings were just as tasty. I'm an appetizer gal as you can see and one thing I love about the place is you can customize the amount of appetizers that you want, which is great for sharing or if your eyes are bigger than your stomach. I'm a huge fan of their sweet tea, just the perfect amount of lip-smacking sweetness! I went with my mom a few times and while the service is prompt they are totally cool with letting you to your own devices and having a chat or just hanging out. This is really a great little gem in Harlem, that while it does get busy, it's not as crazy as some tourist restaurants can be. Granted I've never gone on a weekend but I'm thinking it wouldn't get too overwhelming even still.

Rumored touristy barbecue in the hinterlands of Harlem is not completely without merit. ?Do not miss the swag sampler with deviled eggs, spicy shrimp, and yummy fried green tomatoes. ?Now for the cue- I ordered the pork ribs and my friend got the catfish. ?The sides were all good with the mac and cheese being the standout with a slightly crunchy top, tasty creole potato salad and baked beans being flavored with chorizo was porkly good. ?The ribs were slightly dry inside and not the superstar ribs I had heard. ?Good beer selection, love blue moon. Cool roadhouse vibe though very confused servers who came to bring the entree while the app plates were still on the table. ?Miss that great corner cue joint and 20th. and 6th.

I know I reviewed this before but that was for dinner. Today I went for lunch in their new location (across the street from the old) and for lunch. Totally different experience. Ok not really. But a really goooood meal. Had to reiterate. For lunch I had the bbq shrimp platter which was delicious, spicy peanut bbq covered shrimpy over a bed of greens and 2 sides plus cornbread. I had the collared greens and they were THE BEST. Such a good spice to them! And the mashed sweet potatoes with walnuts. So good too. Others had a burger, the chicken and brisket and bbq pork and everyone was psyched about their choices. I tasted the yummy mac & cheese and there were no complaints on the corn bread. That is FOR SURE. I saw the extensive beer selection and have to make a mental note to come back for an evening gathering to combine a brew and some live music. YUM Galore!

I was really excited to try this neighborhood joint after all the word-of-mouth I've been getting on this place. The BBQ was decent but definitely not the best I've ever had. I got the ribs, which did not fall off the bone and were a bit dry for my liking and sampled my roommates picks. Nothing wowed me. I'm pretty sure with their volume of customers, they do some precooking of the meat...tricks of the microwave, if you know what I'm sayyinn. The foods OK, but I don't think it's worth the wait or hype. Maybe I'm just used to good ol southern BBQ - real BBQ.

My favorite NYC Barbeque place by far, and I've tried them all. Start yourself off with some fried green tomatoes and chipotle chicken wings, then move onto the main course with ribs, pulled pork, or brisket. The ribs are fall off the bone delicious, and the pulled pork is tender and flavorful. It's all great. The service is also friendly and great and the food comes out really quickly. Great beer selection too. Make sure to make reservations online before you go or you might find yourself waiting in line quite awhile for a table.

In my most recent trip up to visit some friends at Columbia, I suggested that we visit the nearby Dinosaur BBQ joint. It's pretty close to the 125th Street stop on the subway, and it was already pretty crowded when we got up there around 1 PM or so. The hostess was nice enough to take our name down, and after 15 minutes or so loitering at the bar and watching some basketball, we got ourselves a nice booth. It's a great atmosphere, but the first thing you will notice is how smoky it smells... ...which is a great indication of how freakin' awesome the barbeque here tastes. The prices are a bit cheaper than Blue Smoke, but the food is just as delicious. I ended up getting Tres Hombres, which is a great mix of ribs, pulled pork, and brisket. The ribs here were soft, tender, and juicy; they fell right off the bone and melted in my mouth. So much better than what I had at Rub, which is the most recent place I had some ribs from. The pulled pork was also delicious, particularly when you add a little more of the house BBQ sauce to it. I've never been a big pulled pork person before, but Dinosaur might've convinced me otherwise. The brisket was almost as good as Blue Smoke's; it was very tender as well. The sides were fantastic as well; there was a twist of Cajun spice to both the mac and cheese as well as the potato salad. No mac and cheese will ever come close to Blue Smoke, but this was awfully full of cheesy goodness as well. But the value is better - you get the two sides with your meal for free. All in all, this was a fantastic place to have a weekend lunch. The beer selection is also pretty decent, with a fair number of lagers from upstate available...not surprising given the upstate presence of the chain. I probably won't come back too often because it's quite a ways from where I live, but if I'm ever in the area again, I'll definitely be coming back. So tasty!

Finally I got to get up here and try the BBQ I've heard so much about. ?I had a birthday party here last week after atempting to organize a few trips unsucessfully. ?I was impressed. ?I have heard about how good the syracuse original is many times and this place is not that far from me, just behind the uptown fairway (where I regularly jog to). ?They were able to accomodate my somewhat nebulous party of 12 arriving at different times although this took negotiation and I warn you to have you whole party or expect a wait. ?It was mobbed on a thursday and I heard the hostess say the non reserved wait was an hour and a half so plan ahead! ?Most importantly though, the food was cheap, delicious and plentiful, a welcome combo in Manhattan. ?The chicken wings (all kinds) were amazing, and the fried green tomatoes were tasty as hell. ?Most of us got the tres hombres platter (brisket, ribs, and pork) which is aproximately three times the amount of food you would eat in a normal meal and it's like $15. ?Plan on next day sandwiches. ?I just had blue smoke recently and I vastly preferred this. ?I also like it over Daisy Mays and Pearsons. ?I will definitely be returning. ? P.S. ?It's not on Yelp but the best BBQ anywhere is the Top of the Hill Grill in Brattleboro VT... No joke

The best BBQ I've had in my life was a little place on the side of the road in East Texas. Part of the reason was that it was unexpected, the place, the time, and the portions, I recall a pork chop that was almost as big as my head. This was named the best BBQ in the entire USA. That raises the bar. That says something. What? I'm not really sure... That said, this place while very good, it didn't wow me, but that doesn't take anything away from it. I equate it to watching Michael Jordan play basketball during my rapscallion youth. His image was #1 dude, all by himself, all flash and dash and the slam dunk, but in reality he scored most of his points on dull 15 foot jump shots after Oakley or Rodman placed on elbow in the gut of the guy checking MJ so he could get open and hit the jumper. I think I saw him dunk maybe twice over the six or so games I saw him play. Still at the end of the day his team won, he got the job done, scored his 30, he was universally consistent. That's sort of like this place. Across the board it's very good. The ribs have a meaty quality goodness to them, not cooked too long, and the sides of BBQ beans and 'slaw added a respective yin and yang of sweet and tangy that added to the sass quotient. ?Service was pleasant and they enjoyed my humor which while didn't increase their above average tip it still was appreciated.

I think that this place is overrated and overpriced, the place is flooded with Columbia University students. ?I got the sweetheart deal for two, which is a full rack of ribs and 4 sides, the first time. ? ?The ribs were decent but the corn bread and baked beans were great. ?I also got the Mac and cheese side that was nothing special. ?I came back and I got the pork ribs and brisket. ?The latter was good and the former was not. ?Finally I just was not impressed with the decor and service.

The best BBQ! Affordable and delicious. Personal fav is the brisket sandwich. Also, the mac and cheese is so good I get a double order instead of 2 sides when I order the platter. Burgers and wings also real good. Also great beer selection and special drinks. The ladies I go with always get the Donkey Punch, sweet with lemonade and other juices, as well as 151.

After wanting to check this place out for over a year I finally made it up to D-BBQ on a recent Sunday afternoon. ?Despite a 45-minute wait for a table, I was totally impressed with the on-tap beer selection, the tasty mac & cheese (though it's rare that I encounter a mac & cheese that I can say something bad about) and our laid-back but efficient young server who replaced my beer before I could even ask. ?I had cuban-type sandwich that was pretty good, but the aforementioned mac & cheese was the highlight for me. ?The creole potato salad was good too. ?Well worth the trip--I'll definitely head back.

I had been to ?Dino-BBQ once a little over a year ago with my buddy Jack when he used to live nearby the place. ?He would frequent it, well, frequently, and we ordered take out from there and I was pleasantly surprised. ?So last night, for the NCAA Final Four, Jack and I decided to meet up again at Dino-BBQ for round two, only this time, the sequel was a dine-in experience. Dino-BBQ is a busy place, and on a Saturday night with two big basketball games going on, it was especially crowded. ?We of course showed up at 6:30 pm with no reservation, but, as luck would have it, a little sidling by the bar garnered us two prime stools right by a TV. ?There is a lot of bar sidling, so if that's not your thing, you should think about sitting in the dining room. ?There is a lot of bar space, but as we talked with the waitress, she spilled the beans (not of the baked variety) to us that the restaurant is moving across the street and the bar will be much larger. ?So if you're worried about bar space, wait a few months and check out the new location. ? Getting thirsty, I spotted the Sixpoint Sweet Action ale on the extensive Dino-BBQ draft beer menu and thought to myself, "Who wouldn't want some sweet action?" ?It was light, fizzy and refreshing. ?There is nothing I love more than an ample beer selection when I am about to stuff my face with saucy braised meats. ?Jack ordered a Hoegaarden, much to my chagrin and disapproval, but he loved it. ?We also ordered a couple apps as the first game was getting started. ?I was about to go with fried green tomatoes, but then I saw Cajun deviled eggs and got all antsy. ?I flipped a mental coin and the eggs won the toss. ?I was not disappointed. ?I feel like deviled eggs should be a must on any menu, and these were especially good, a little spicy and a little sweet. ?Jack had a half order of the the Original bbq wings. ?They were big, meaty, and tangy. ?All in all, good starters around. As the game ended a very friendly drunk couple next to us ordered a huge platter of apps. ?Out of nowhere, she offered me a fried green tomato. ?It could have been laced with arsenic, but I didn't care. ?I happily accepted and was pretty amazed at how crispy the breading was. ?Another starter winner for sure. As the second game was about to tip, we grabbed menus again and took a look at the sandwich selection. ?I thought back to my first visit which included a Brisket sandwich, and I remembered liking it. ?So of course I went with a Memphis pulled-pork (with slaw on top) sandwich instead. ?Jack orders the brisket every time so it was no surprise when he did again. ?But then when the sandwiches arrived, we were both kind of jealous of each others orders. ?So, elementary-school style, we traded half-sandwiches. ?The pulled pork was some of the best I'd ever had. ?Just enough sauce and plenty of meat. ?The slaw was fresh and crunchy. ?The brisket was a little disappointing though. ?It tasted great, but I remembered there being a lot more meat on my sandwich a year ago. ?This time it was more bread than meat which is never a good thing. ?Still it was sauced to perfection and tender and juicy. ?The sides I ordered were the collard greens which tasted like they were just made in Texas(that's a compliment, by the way) and the mac and cheese which was so good it should be an entree. ?Jack had the mac and cheese and the baked beans, which I didn't taste because I stopped to send a text message, turned back around, and he had finished them already. ?I assume that means they were pretty good. ?They also give you homemade pickle slices which were dilly and fresh. The bar staff is friendly at Dino-BBQ. ?Even when it's busy, like last night, they are happy to stop and chat. ?It's also a great place to just sit and hang with people. ?A middle-aged country music band was just getting started just as we finished up and paid the check so we stayed to listen for a couple songs. ?They were good. ?They also invited a 10 year old to play guitar with them. ?That has to violate some kind of child labor law, right? Fully gorged, we waddled out of the restaurant quite satisfied (except for Duke blowing out WVU) and headed our separate ways. ?Dino-BBQ is a good place for beer and braised meat. ?What more do you really want from a BBQ place? ?I mean, seriously?

Finally managed to try this place last week. It was a bit of a wait even with a reservation, but the restaurant was unbelievably busy for a rainy Wednesday evening so it is understandable. Started the meal off with some Garlic Chipotle wings. We ordered the smallest plate (3 wings) for two people, and Dinosaur BBQ was kind enough to give us an extra wing so we can share properly. The wings were delicious, as was the blue cheese that came along with them. They truly are really spicy though, so for anyone who can't handle that I recommend that you get one of the milder versions of the same wings. For my main course, I ordered the House Special, which is a quarter of a chicken and a quarter of a rack of ribs. With that, I got the fresh cut fries and the iceberg wedge salad with BBQ/blue cheese dressing. I also added the drunken spicy shrimp to my meal. Both the chicken and the ribs were very tasty, and went perfectly with Dinosaur's own BBQ sauce. I especially loved the wedge salad, the dressing, which was a mix of BBQ sauce and blue cheese was fresh and delicious, and a different take on what is usually a completely average salad. The shrimp were amazing, I recommend that anyone who comes to Dinosaur order them - they are perfectly cooked, and the dipping sauce that came along with them was great. The service wasn't the greatest, our waiter did not come once in an hour to check up on us or to ask us if we need more drinks. I understand that it's very busy, but service should still be better than that. I also am not a big fan of the look of the restaurant, but that is just personal taste and not a reflection on their delicious food which everyone must try at least once.

'I mean...I've had better bbq at family functions' were my exact thoughts while eating the bbq. After trekking to 12 Ave. in Harlem to even get there, I really expected more. On top of that, the serving size of the sides were made for small children. I just stared at it at first, then moved on. So needless to say, I'll pass on this haute.

Their ribs are the best! The cornbread is very good here as well. I normally hate cornbread but they make it so sweet and moist, but crispy in the right places.

We ordered the pulled pork with the brisket and the korean style. They pulled pork and brisket were cold, but they had pretty good flavor. The sides were ehhh. The mac and cheese was kind of gross. I prefer mine with crunchy topping and creamy cheese, not gloppy. The greens were good though. They were kind of sour as they should be. The short ribs were fantastic though. They were hot and nicely seasoned though with what I can't tell. The meat was moist and juicy, with a nice spice marinade. I would definitely return for these, but for the brisket and pork not so much.

I went to Dinosaur in Syracuse and loved it. ?I didn't love the NYC location quite as much, but it was still pretty good. ?Their mac and cheese sucks and that is one of my favorite things about barbecue joints. ?The ribs were really good and so were the salty potatoes. ?The service was friendly. ?We were told there was a 30 minute wait or that we could sit in the cocktail area immediately. ?We did and it ended up being pretty quiet and cozy.

This place is fun and feels like a chain restaurant inside but it's NOT! ?It's authentic, baby. ?There are two kinds of barbecue sauce and a BIG ASS pork plate that you can order (I heard this is awesome). ?My barbecued chicken was great, I beefed that up with some macaroni and cheese and even the collard greens had some kick! ?I didn't eat EVERYTHING that day... but I'd like to go back and order more to keep the flavors coming. ?I think that if you like barbecue, there's no way you can go wrong here. ?SOUTHERNERS... if you have a hankering and have been feeling deprived in the big city, head up to Harlem, honey!

I'll have to give this place another shot based on the raves I'm reading here, but I recently went to the original Syracuse location, and was disppointed with the ribs which were an unpleasant compromise between the juicy fall off the bone type or the flavorful but dry gnaw on the bone type (i.e they were chewy in a bad way). ?I forget what my friend ordered (I think a bbq sandwich), but she was disappointed as well. ?The fried green tomatoes were outstanding, however, and the atmosphere was fun.

The Bar-B-Que here is AMAZING, but whats even better? A good beer selection at reasonable prices! Went here for lunch and ate myself sick on Bar-B-Que and washed it all down with their 4 - 4 oz. sampler of beer (I was happy to see they had my favorite beer Blue Point Toasted Lager). The food is some of the best BBQ in NY and there prices are very reasonable. I will def be back.

Going to Dinosaur was like taking a trip to the 'burbs. ?The restaurant was huge and had plenty of space to accommodate our party of 7. ?Still, for a Sunday night around 6, the place was hopping. ?There was a line for tables and every seat in the house was filled. ?The decor was the attempt of a southern feel, but had biker influences. To start, my roommate insisted we order a pitcher of Syracuse Pale Ale. ?Unfortunately, the beer wasn't my favorite - it was ok, but I'd prefer a lighter beer or more of a wheat beer. ?We also ordered a round of wings, which my roommate claimed were huge. ?Once we received them, he went back on his statement but I have to admit these wings offered more meat than your typical wings you'd get at a bar. ?The Honey BBQ sauce on these wings were delicious, but the blue cheese dressing accompanying the wings was phenomenal. ?I almost wanted to get a side salad just for the dressing. Dinosaur is an incredible value - for $15.50, I was able to get a 1/4 rack of ribs, pulled pork, corn bread and two sides - essentially getting two meals for the price of one. ?The ribs were great, with the meat falling off the bone and the pork was delicious as well, although I decided to save most of it for another meal. ?My corn bread was wonderful, but I wish they had extra corn bread on the table just because I probably could have eaten several pieces of it. ?For my sides, I went with the creole potato salad and the mac and cheese. ?Both had a jalapeno aftertaste which I really liked - not that "hot my mouth is on fire" aftertaste, but the "wow that was a good pepper" aftertaste. ?The potato salad was more of a cold, mashed potato consistency with pieces of celery in it. ?I also sampled the Syracuse salt potatoes from my friend's plate. ?I don't know the sauce they put the potatoes in, but I swear it would make anything taste wonderful. After hearing so much about Dinosaur, I thought I was going to have high expectations and be disappointed - but I wasn't, it was definitely well worth the trip. ?Only downside is that I know I can't visit the place as much I'd like - because I'd weigh at least 50 more pounds.

Funny to think that this place is located at the very end of W125th St. No one would think this place existed next to my beloved Fairway supermarket. Peeps travel from far far land to come here.

On days when I tire of all of the bullsh*t that can be Manhattan, it's so refreshing to know that, merely a subway or bus ride away, I can find myself in a different neighborhood or borough. ?Case in point, Harlem: my friend, Michelle, just moved to the area and, instead of meeting at a restaurant downtown, I suggested that we grab dinner in her new neighborhood. ? I had been familiar with (to a point) - and even sampled some of their pulled pork at the Big Apple BBQ 2010 - Dinosaur BBQ for quite some time, but it wasn't until this past Wednesday evening that I was finally able to partake in the full-on, whole hog, 25+ napkin experience. ? At the actual establishment. After a quick subway ride uptown - followed by a 3-minute walk to the restaurant - it dawned on me that every one else + their mother/cousin/pharmacist/you-name-it had the same idea as me, Michelle, and our other friend, Vera: Dinosaur BBQ was bursting at the seam with hungry patrons of all ages. ?Luckily, its casual and rustic space was large enough to seat and, eventually, feed us all. Choosing to forgo the 45+ minute wait for a traditional table, the three of us decided to sit at the bar. ?And after receiving our first round of ice-cold Blue Moon's, we perused the lengthy menu and came to the mutual decision that we'd split a handful of appetizers and one combination plate. ? ? Jumbo BBQ Chicken Wings When Vera suggested 'wings for one of our appetizers, I objected. ?"They're messy, meatless, and stupid," I griped. ?Michelle agreed. ?But Vera stood firm, eventually convincing the two of us that Dinosaur's 'wings were the "best of the best, this side of Buffalo..." and that, after just one bite, these 'wings had the power to convert us naysayers in to believers. Vera was right. ?The 'wings were shockingly interlaced with a decent amount of meat and bathed in the most ridiculously smokey, slightly spicy, delicious sauce that I've tasted in a long time. ...And would you believe who fought over the last 'wing? ?Me and Michelle! ?Go figure. Cornbread I would have appreciated if our waitress, knowing that we were splitting everything, had brought us a third piece of cornbread. ?Two individual portions made for an awkward split between three people. ?With that being said, the cornbread, itself, was nothing to write home about. ?I was disappointed that it was not accompanied by some sort of butter and/or honey. Fried Green Tomatoes Aside from the incredibly random pecorino-romano cheese shreds (Seriously? Atop fried green tomatoes?), this plate of fresh-from-the-deep-fryer, warm, crispy-but not greasy, green t'maters proved to be the perfect batch. ?The accompanying cayenne buttermilk ranch dressing was the crowning glory. ?Had I not been dining with two model-esque girlfriends, I would have ordered a second helping. ?No questions asked. Extreme Sampler The combination platter that we chose to split was composed of three meats: sliced Texas beef brisket, 1/2 chicken (leg, thigh, breast), and 1/2 rack of pork ribs; plus our choice of two sides: macaroni and cheese, Syracuse-style salt potatoes. The verdict? ? ?* Beef brisket: Way too fatty and lacking that rich smoky flavor - I prefer my brisket lean. ? ?* Chicken: Since Vera doesn't eat red meat, this was her portion of the platter, which was fine 'n dandy by me. ?I didn't even touch the chicken. ? ?* Pork ribs: Excellent! ?Best pork ribs I've had in NYC. ?Rich, smoky, meaty, all-around finger lickin' good! ? ?* Mac 'n cheese: Served lukewarm and made with an awkwardly pungent cheese blend. ?Definitely worth skipping. ? ?* Potatoes: "Syracuse-style salt potatoes" sound pretty intriguing, no? ?Well, they're nothing more than boiled new-potatoes drowning in butter. ?Again, definitely worth skipping. As if all of the above was not enough grub, the three of us decided to split not one, but two homemade desserts. Key Lime Pie There's something magical about the flavor combination between a buttery graham cracker crust and a sweet 'n sour key lime curd. Although Michelle and Vera thought that the key lime filling was too "runny," I appreciated the fact that this dessert wasn't served stoically-firm and ice-cold. ?What's wrong with eating your key lime pie with a spoon, anyways? Peanut Butter Pie I had no idea what I was in for, as this particular dessert is not something that I would have otherwise ordered. ?One bite, however, and I was hooked: this peanut butter gut-bomb stole the show! ?The crust was composed of crushed Oreo cookies and topped with a dense, whipped, salty-peanut butter filling that wasn't overly sweet. ?The pie was crowned with halved peanuts, homemade chocolate sauce and whipped cream. ?I'd return to Dinosaur solely for a slice of this pie. ?Trust me, it's destination worthy!

At the urging of a friend, I finally made the trek up to Dinosaur's with a group of six friends. We started with swag appetizer sampler plate, deviled eggs, wings, friend green tomatoes and spicy shrimp. The eggs, wings, and tomatoes were very good, but I especially liked the shrimp. We ate light on the appetizers to save ourselves for the entrees, which turned out to be far more filling than anticipated.I had a three meat sampler of ribs, beef brisket and sausage. The ribs were great, probably the best I've had in a long time. The beef brisket, for the first few bites, were pretty awesome too. Unfortunately, it got dry pretty quickly and then had to be covered with sauce to remaion appetizing. The sausage was fine, but nothing spectacular. For sides, I had the mac and cheese and the Syracuse-style salt potatoes. Both were very good but especially the latter with its buttery sauce. Prices were reasonable as you would expect given the location. Overall, it was unanimous that we thought this would be a place we would return to. Oh yeah, the jalapeno peppers were nasty. They packed quite a punch and it took several minutes to get the heat out of my mouth. Try the Ithaca root beer. It's pretty good.

I have to say the first trip here was memorable, but not because of the food, and not necessarily in a good way. ?It involved a 300 pound man who was in desperate need of a belt. ?I want get into any details to save you all, but needless to say I wasn't so focused on the meal. ?This time was quite different. ?I love a good wedge salad and I think this place clearly fits the bill on that one. ?I would almost give them a five for that alone. ?Along with that I had the solo appetizer which allowed me to sample all the favorites (fried green tomato, wings, deviled egg, and shrimp) and it was all quite delish. ?Add that bucket of PBR for 16 dollars and you are in business. ?There is something special about finishing a tough test, (and in medical school they all seem to be tough) and heading down to a place like this. ?It hit the spot.

Can't say enough about the juicy goodness of this place! Their new spot directly on 125th and 12th Avenue is actually nicer than the former place. It allowed them to expand the bar which is long and nice. No long waits to place your drink order. Everything I have had here is delicious and it puts Dallas BBQ on final notice that all they really put out there is trash in comparison to this consistent deliciousness. My fave sides are the drunken shrimp, Mac and cheese and the salty potatoes. Mmmmmmmmmm! A definite MUST for seriously good barbeque.

It's been great living near Dinosaur for the past few years. ?Some great BBQ, nice twists on traditional plates, and a great atmosphere. ?I wish I could give them five stars, but I have to be honest and say that not all dishes are consistent or on par with other menu items. First, definitely make a reservation (they're on open table!)-- this place is packed just about every day of the week. Second- ribs are probably the weakest link for me, the rest (especially the brisket and pulled pork) are great, especially embellished with their sauces. ?The chicken wings are some of the largest and meatiest I've had (and while I LOVE spicy, and they do provide great spicy sauces, I also love the honey-bbq mild sauce). ?The BBQ fried rice is my favorite dish (even if it isn't "traditional" BBQ), and the beer boiled shrimp appetizer is fantastic. Finally, great beer selection, with a nice rotation of different seasonal and local brews. ?Not to mention a rotation of great Root Beers on tap (though I wish they'd have Sarnac at all times and rotate in a second one). Can't beat the enjoyment of sitting in a big warehouse space and see everyone around you pretty much loving how full they are.

Sat us immediately and we ordered the family stylin bbq and the Korean style BBQ ribs just as a bonus. When that food finally came out, we devoured the whole thing!!!! The food was delicious. From the briskets, the side orders of Mac and cheese, vegetarian styled collard greens and definitely those candied yams!!!! Mmmm!!!

Fun place to come with a group. The BBQ is quite good, no rival for Nashville or KC, but solidly tasty. ?This is New York after all. ?Prices are reasonable. Don't come for the service, which though adequate isn't stellar. ?You're better off getting a table with a real waitress than the tables over by the bar where you have to jump up and stand in front of a server to get them to slow down. ?The atmosphere is lots of fun, and portions are generous, so get ready to fill up.

Came here with a friend for a late dinner. You would think some BBQ joint in West Harlem would be ghetto, questionable food, etc. But this place definitely exceeded my expectations. We had to wait about 10 minutes for a table, which didn't bug me. Our waitress was friendly and on top of us the whole night, even though it was pretty packed once we sat down. Unfortunately, I wasn't starving so I just stuck with an entree and had the Texas brisket platter, with sides of mac n cheese and colesaw. The meat was super tender and tasty, the mac n cheese was just right, not to gooey, not to crunchy. The colesaw was perfect as well. The place is somewhat pricey, but this is Manhattan though. As we were leaving, some live music was starting by the bar, too bad we didn't come later, it sounded pretty good! Next time I'm uptown and starving, definitely stopping by again.

After finally trying Dinosaur's wings and ribs last night, I'm giving them the 5-stars they deserve. ?The meat on the ribs are fall-off-the-bone tender. ?The wings were meaty and a bit spicy with a little kick to it. ?And i think the best side ever-- the salted potatoes. ?Sorry mac n' cheese. ?You've become a distant second.

Simply the best bar-b-que. Nothing beats the wings or fried green tomatoes at Dinosaur. And the ribs....Wow! 30 beers on tap, can't be beat. Pulled pork and brisket pilled high with savory cornbread and a number of delicious sides. If you're in New York, head up to Harlem and give this Upstate transplant a try. You won't be disappointed!

4.5. ?Some of the best bbq I have had in my life, though still not the best. ?So I give it a 4.5. ?The Carolina pulled pork and a side of beans is exceptional, and I always try to order a beer from their extensive tap/bottle/can list. ?Love the Pork Slap ale, or a PBR and BBQ.

ribs - a-may-zing. corn bread - solid. chicken - moist & delicious. brisket - good. bbq beans - yum! mac n cheese - decent, but i've had better. cole slaw - necessary to cut through the tasty grease of all of the above. deviled eggs - yummy! wings - very good. shrimp - eh. but that may have been because i dont like peeling shrimp. fried green tomatoes - pretty good, but i wish the fried part stayed on the tomato better. sangria - tasty. beer selection - better than most all in all, a great experience. a few notes... it can be difficult to get the attention of your waiter. do NOT take the 2/3 there. make SURE to take the 1, as the walk from the 2/3 is long and unpleasant. and if i spill my nearly full sangria, id expect more prompt cleanup (my date ended up cleaning everything up himself), and a complimentary sangria, neither of which we got.

The food is definitely good enough to wipe the plate clean but the wait was ridiculous the time I went. I have to say it was the longest wait I have ever encountered. I'm not sure if waiting for almost 2 hours just to sit is typical? I would go back if I was certain that would not be the issue...the location isn't the most convenient spot. As far as the food, it all is yummy but my favorite are the fried green tomatoes.

I was skeptical, I have to admit, especially since I went to school in Syracuse and ate at the original Dino BBQ, but I had to give them a try! The wait is pretty long (not quite as long as the wait in the 'cuse), especially if you have a large party. However, the food was on-par with the Syracuse location. I ordered a Saranac Root Beer (yum!), salt potatoes and a pulled pork sandwich and it hit the spot! It's a trek to get out to Harlem (for some of us), but I think a visit to Dinosaur BBQ is completely worth it.

I love Dinosaur!!!!!! the ribs are delicious. I came here with some friends on a saturday and this was my first time at the new location. i have to say it is really nice. It was crowded like always, but some how we were seated right away. My friends and I came in around lunch so we decided to get appetizers instead of a full meal. I had six wings with Wango Tango sauce. I got 2 sides the mac and cheese and the fried rice. I really enjoyed the wings and the fried rice, I didn't care much for the Mac and cheese. One of my friends had the wings as well while the other got the Appetizer sampler with the boiled shrimp and fried green tomatoes. The tomatoes were so good he got an order to go. My only reservation was that our server would go missing for 15 minutes for at a time. other than that i would recommend Dinosaur to any body looking for great BBQ.

There's a lot to like about Dino BBQ. A spacious interior means you're not crammed into tiny spaces next to your fellow patrons like at many NYC restaurants. I ordered the sweetheart deal for 2 with someone else which includes a full rack of ribs and 4 sides. When drowned in the delicious Dino BBQ sauce, the ribs were extra tasty. On their own they were to my liking as well as they were very meaty with not a lot of fat. The sides we ordered were great (although the portions were somewhat small), especially the Mac and Cheese and the salted potatoes. My only real complaints were that the cornbread was tasteless and the sweet tea which was simply not sweet enough. That's probably not a big deal for most folk though. Overall it's definitely worth checking out if you have a craving for the ribs!

My pulled pork sandwich was okay - I had to slather on a lot of sauce (which I don't usually do at really good bbq places). ?My friends got extended samplers and they deemed it good, but not the best ever. ?We enjoyed the Dino house beer on tap, which was refreshing. ?It was good, but I wouldn't wait hours to be seated. ?Make reservations for a late afternoon on a Sunday and you should be okay - even in groups of 4 or more. ?Although 4 is probably the optimal group size.

Hello, gentrification. We had a pretty bad experience here. ? First, we wait almost two hours to get seating. ?We find out way into our wait that we could basically claim the outside tables. ?We proceed to do that, but due to the size of our group, we basically waited for other tables to open up. ?After a table frees up, we end up moving it to the other side of the entrance. ?Mind you, only the waitress bothered offering a hand - no other staff was around. We place our orders. ?The first round of plates come out, but our waitress ended up dropping the second round of food. ?More waiting. ? The waitress did her best to rectify the situation. ?Kudos to her. The food was not worth that wait, although it's hard to remember because my judgment is clouded by the bad experience.

This is my favorite BBQ place. I don't even like meat that much but will eat the meat here. The sides are great- even the collard greens! The meat off the ribs just falls off the bone.

I'm generally not a huge BBQ fan but this place is decent. It's actually the only BBQ place I like. Loved their hot sauce, mac and cheese, corn bread, and fries. Love their korean style beef BBQ.

Where do I begin, my husband have been coming here for years, in fact it was our first date. ?Apart from the sentimental attachment that I have for this place my review is objective. ?the ribs, wings and Korean BBQ ribs are awesome, although the ribs can sometimes be hit or miss. ?I don't like the corn bread or the Mac and cheese but the other sides including the BBQ pork fried rice, Cole slaw and baked beans are great! ?The drinks are great and if you love beer they have like 30 beers on tap. ? ? ? The sweet potato pie is a good dessert but I think my favorite most consistent menu item to get are the wings. ?You can see the smoke ring and you have sever different sauces to choose from. ?It gets really loud and noisy on the weekends so if you want to take the kids go on a weekday. ?The brisket lacks flavor but everything else is pretty good. ?The only reason that I'm giving this place three stars is because last time that I went my wings weren't cooked though which can get you sick

From the outside you would not think that this place is anything special and to be honest in my opinion it's not that great. There is better bbq in NYC for sure. The only reason that I gave it three stars to begin with is that their beer selection is pretty darn good. ?I'm huge into beer and what better drink than to accompany some decent smoky ribs? If you haven't been here make the journey up and check it out. It's worth at least one visit. Try to avoid weekend dinner rush because this place can get very very crowded. Oh and the decor is pretty much what you would expect.

Ok Folks, It appears there are a ton of NYC people out there who don't know their arse from their BBQ, and that's ok. I'm here to help. Georgia's East Side is not good, Sorry, neither is Dallas Jones ( I like the owner but no love in that BBQ). Bone Lick is exactly what you'd think a Fancy Greenwich Village BBQ place would taste like. Daisy Mays , Rub, Virgil's, Blue Smoke, Hill Country, Wildwood and Mo Gridders; they are the class of the field. Each of those does something better than the other, and we could sit and debate forever which and why. ? I have eaten at Dinosaur 5 times 2 times up at the original in Rochester before it was sold and 3 times here in NYC. The 2 times up in Rochester were awesome, great atmosphere, good waitstaff and excellent food. The Pulled pork, ribs and brisket were all top notch. ?Then it was sold and is now part of a conglomerate. Since the ownership change I have eaten twice here in NYC, the first time I could notice a big drop in the quality. Ribs were under cooked, the pulled pork was over cooked ?and the beans well they have changed that recipe altogether. Last Monday I found that they have somewhat righted the ship there was a huge shift in the Ribs in fact several of these on this day were sublime. The brisket was sweet heaven with a perfect smokey bark. They still seem to be having issues with the pulled pork, it was again overcooked and mushy. However, the atmosphere here is still number one for any NYC BBQ place. ?It's a schlep in terms of getting to, but once you do Dinosaur has good BBQ!

Where to begin? I went way out of my way to check this place out. Overall very disappointed. What I ordered, Tres ni?os with corn bread, Mac n cheese, fries, and sweet tea to drink. Why listen to me? I've worked in a few 5 star restaurants and have eaten in many places all over NYC and the world. My hobby is picking up chef internships to work with famous chefs and learn what great cooking is all about. Experience: Showed up alone to check out the place at 2:30pm. Had to wait 10 minutes for a table, sat down then waited 10 more minutes before my server showed up to the table. Ordered my meal. 24 minutes later it showed up. Meager server for a $16 plate. Very disappointed in the flavor, or lack of flavor in the majority of the food items. Only decent item was the ribs, while the cornbread was passable in flavor. I had to get up to find my server because my drink was empty and he did not return to my table the entire meal. The Mac n Cheese i ordered, noodles undercooked, cheese flavor poor, and topped with raw cayenne pepper, You can get more flavor from boxed 99cent macaroni. After waving down my server, I complained about the poor Macaroni, then 5 minutes later the manager came out and I had to complain again, then offered a new side. Ordered the Baked beans, which also lacked flavor as it was simply two dimensional. Hopeful that desert would be better, ordered a slice of the apple cake. The slice was fair for the cost, yet I would have to call it a spice cake with apples, as the flavor of the apples were masked by all the spices tossed in it. The cream cheese icing was good. I asked for the check, which came promptly after searching for my server again. Then after waiting 5 minutes to pay the bill i just left the cash on the table. Review of individual items. seating: ***Pro, lots of it ***Con, takes long to be seated (I was alone too!) Environment: ***Pro, large place ***Con, loud and dark. Server: ***Can't say all are bad but mine was not spectacular. FOOD: ***Pro, ribs and corn bread, sweet tea ***Con, pulled pork, brisket, fries, Mac n cheese. Would I recommend this place? Only if I did not really like the person.

True, we're not in the South so there are not too many places to compare Dino to, but the food was so good I stuffed myself silly and even looked forward to eating leftovers 2 days later. Best things about Dinosaur: wings, fried green tomatoes, ribs, pulled pork, MAC N CHEESE, and of course, the prices you won't find anywhere else on the island. Then again it IS a trek, and there are plenty of people waiting, so make your reservations and be ready to eat! Service was a tad slow, perhaps they do it on purpose so you're extra hungry and the food tastes even better :P

So I made the trip up to Harlem yesterday to get this highly recommened BBQ. Now, I have to be honest I was a little nervous since I have never been north of the Met. I traveled to a new part of town and had an amazing experience. I filled my belly with a massive amount of pork and other tasty things. I must say the wings there are THE BEST IN NEW YORK CITY. I have been searching for wings like the ones at Dino since my first taste of wings. (which I would guess is now over 20 years ago.) The Honey BBQ sauce is perfect. This place was recommened to me by many and I took the subway for what felt like a year, so I felt I needed to try everything. I had the tres ninos (pulled pork, brisket, ribs, 2 sides) ?1. Side- Mac and Cheese- amazing. 2. Side BBQ Rice-also great. Last but not least I had 3 wings. Which is great that you can get just three. Sometimes other people do not want wings ( I have no idea why) or perhaps you are dining alone. I see people saying "if you are in the area I recommend it'. Well, I recommend it if you live on this planet! I will most certainly return for more wings and M&C.

I finally made it up to Harlem to try Dino BBQ, that people have been raving about for years. I can definitely say, this was the best barbecue I've ever tasted! ?We started with the fried green tomatoes (excellent, a must get!) My brother and I shared the Extreme Sampler, so we could try a little of everything. The ribs were out of this world - and I don't even like pork! The chicken was good but I think the ribs are what are really worth coming for. I wasn't a fan of the brisket. ?I'm excited for them to open their second location in Williamsburg in the fall!

While the ribs are great, WAITING 2 HOURS for the food left a bitter taste in my mouth. It's not a one time thing either -- the wait here is always horrendous. First time it was 1.5 hours... 2 hours next time. I'm finding another place for BBQ in the city...

Rochester Stand Up! http://www.youtube.com/w…. Although there aren't many advantages for attending college in upstate/western NY, being able to frequent Dinosaur BBQ without having to go to Harlem is a HUGE positive. ?Please, please dinosaur man...bring me an outpost closer to home! ?The Dinosaur wings are a must-eat. ?The chicken is tender, juicy and not fried (the wings are pit smoked) so you have the illusion that you are eating something relatively healthy yet mind numbing. ?I recommend the Wango-Tango sauce but you can't go wrong with original. ?All of the meats are fantastic but the ribs are perfection. ?Perfectly smoked, these tender baby-backs melt like BBQ butter in your mouth, only if butter was made of meat and it had a bone that you could gnarl. ?Maybe the greatest threesome since the pool scene in Wild Things is the Tres Hombre plate, a trio of meats; pulled pork, Texas brisket and ribs. ?I'm not sure which one is Neve Campbell and which is Denise Richards but my mouth is watering as I type. ?If you are into monogamy with your smoked meats get the Big Ass Pork plate or ask them to make you a Big Ass Brisket plate... it is what it sounds like... delicious! I know they probably won't open a downtown location for fear that the Harlem spot will be cannibalized but a boy can dream can't he? ?In the meantime looks like I'm headed to Harlem...holla at me Juelz.

Dinosaur gets another star because they are truly ah-may-zing at serving up that smoky goodness. Their sides have never been a favorite of mine and their sauces tend to be on the watery side, but the meat is the real star. Well, as it turns out I cut back on eating meat so Dinosaur takes a cue and starts to offer a wider selection of seafood offerings! Salmon, catfish, and shrimp to be exact. Last time I order the catfish with a side of greens, and mac. The portions were perfect! The flavor of the catfish and greens were wonderful. The mac was lackluster. I also tried a couple of apps and was left underwhelmed. Stick to the entrees and the drinks and you're golden! I also notice that they must be excellent employers because they have a very low turnover rate. You will often see familiar faces working behind the scenes. ?Always crowded and always loud, but hey that is part of the ambiance.Keep up the good work Dinosaur!

Awesome ribs, but inconsistent. My group ordered two plates of ribs, and one was perfect while the other was a bit dry. Beside the ribs, I tried the BBQ chicken (moist and delicious), fried green tomatoes (yummy), sweet potatoes (too sweet), fries (good but on the salty side), fried rice (forgettable), mac and cheese (unique, smoky flavor), Syracuse potatoes (soaked in butter), collard greens (pretty good), baked beans (good), and cornbread (unforgiveably dry). ?They have a nice selection of sodas, including Sprecher root beer, which is amazing. ?I had the sweet tea, which was a little too sweet for my taste. ?If I went back, I think I'd skip the sides and just get the meat.

We'd been meaning to go here forever. Finally we decided to visit when we had family in town and we're so glad we did. First, we had thought it was kind of a far trek but it's really not. It's like a five min walk from the 1 train. You can smell the BBQ as you start to get close...mmmm. We had a reservation we made more than a week in advance since there were 9 of us. The table they gave us was pretty small for 9 people but we managed. Deciding what to get was a struggle. I wanted it all! There was a prix fix menu for $20 from 4-7pm that included an appetizer, entree and dessert. I wanted an assortment so I actually went with a traditional platter. For $18 or so I got a ton of BBQ chicken, beef brisket, ribs, two sides of my choosing and a piece of cornbread. The brisket was a bit fatty but the meatier parts were juicy and tender. The ribs were super yummy, they had BBQ sauce and a dry rub (I think). The chicken was juicy and delicious. Mac and cheese had a little bit of a kick to it and was super cheesy. I had the salted potatoes as well which were buttery and not too salty. The pork and beans were really good...with big chunks of pork. It was definitely enough for two meals and leftover BBQ is so good! It is also important to note that the spicy BBQ sauce and the garlic chili sauce were great to dip your meat into. I LOVED the spicy BBQ...I bet you could buy a bottle. Maybe next time. Everyone liked their food and sides. We left no room for dessert, which was sad cuz they looked really good. Overall a very satisfying experience and definitely the best BBQ in the city (that I've tried) and a great deal.

One of the best places to take a friend for late night ribs. The appetizers are a good warm-up. Go with the Swag Sampler Plate which has good portions of spicy shrimp boil, chicken wings, friend green tomatoes and deviled eggs. The sweatheart deal is a good deal, but choose something you will finish there, cuz reheat is not a good option. The pulled sanwiches are good, but not the top choice of the menu, stick with a rack and keep it moving.

Dinosaur is the best place for BBQ. It became popular upstate and finally moved its tail to Manhattan. ?Despite the fact that you'll see a lot of Columbia Law students there, the place is as far from fake as you'll get (just a joke, don't sue me). It's just a down home BBQ joint. The meats are flavored perfectly and fall off the bone. The mac and cheese can't be beat. ?One problem for some people is that there aren't really many vegetables. So don't take any herbivores. The collard greens are decent but you'll find better at Rack & Soul farther down on Broadway. The service is usually fine with a lot of young aspiring actors waiting tables, but the quality is tough to keep high with so many people. I recommend booking on OpenTable since it's so well known. Even with a reservation, you may have to wait a little.

Good food and friendly atmosphere, although it was a bit busy and our waitress service took longer than we wanted. ?We tried the full rack of ribs, texas brisket and skirt steak. ?We were somewhat disappointed with the ribs, as they were a bit dry. ?The flavor was there, but it was too dry for our taste. ?However, the brisket and skirt steak were excellent. ?We also loved all of the sides (we ordered one of each), so that was good. ?The portions of the sides are pretty small, so keep that in mind when ordering. ?Overall, I would go back there again.

What we are shocked about is that we never wrote a review for this place the first time! ?So the first time we went here we loved every aspect of our meal, it probably would have been a five. ?However this time we were split in our feelings. ?For apps we had the deviled eggs which were great last time, too salty on this outing. ?The chicken wings were sooo good, we had the honey bbq! ?We split the sweetheart deal, a little over zealous. ?The first time the meat was so tender, this time not as tender as we remembered it to be, maybe an off night? ?For our sides we had the mac and cheese, sweet potatoes, potato salad and syracuse potatoes. ?All the sides were great, the syracuse potatoes were interesting, although not quite what we expected. ? If you decide to eat here, make reservations, it saves you so much time, on both visits we were seated within 5 mins of arrival as opposed to the masses of people that were waiting for hours. Definitely get the wings as an appetizer...they're great!

I finally ate at this popular Harlem BBQ joint imported from Syracuse. I went during the earlier part of lunch, so there wasn't a wait for two. I tried the Wango Tango Wings, which more than a few people have raved about, as well as the BBQ pork ribs, mac-n-cheese, BBQ beans w/ pork & cornbread. Overall, everything tasted really good. However, I wasn't WOWED. Whenever I hear about this place, people rave about it like it's the best BBQ they've ever eaten. Yes -- it was good, but it wasn't an OMG experience. I would totally recommend this place, but come here early so you don't have to wait. I don't think it's worth the trek if you have to wait an hour.

The 2 things you can't miss here are the BBQ Chicken Wings and the ?Brisket. The wings you can just order a meal if you wanted to do so and the brisket was so moist and peppery. And if you a side definetly get the mac and cheese, it has this unique tangy flavor that I really enjoy. I liked the wings so much that I bought a gallon bottle of the wing sauce so I can enjoy it when I don't have the chance to get uptown. I was there for a birthday party with 20 people and we made reservations. ?If you don't there might be a 2 hour wait on weekends.( I heard people told this and they agreed to wait!) It would have gotten 5 stars if they had baby back ribs

I love Dino! Dined here this past weekend and it confirmed my thoughts following the first time I dined here - best BBQ all around that I have had. Although I have to admit, I prefer Hill Country brisket (the moist - not the lean)! Ribs and pulled pork = excellent Brisket = good Mashed sweet potatoes = excellent Baked beans = excellent Carrot & raisin salad = ok (just so many other better sides to choose from..but tried it to go on the "healthy" side!) Syracuse salt potatoes = good Buffalo wings = good Deviled eggs = good Mac & cheese = excellent

I am from Syracuse and would go to the original one all the time. This is more upscale and a lot nicer decor then the Syracuse one. That kind of takes a bit away from it. When I went to the NYC one I was a bit disappointed to learn the menu is not as big as the Syracuse one. Also they DON'T have the mashed potatoes on the menu for a side, those are the BEST. All and all the food is great the sauce is even better. But I miss the biker bar and take no crap waitresses that are in Syracuse.

I ordered a half rack of ribs and when the waiter brought out our food it looked like he might have dropped it on his way. ?Food just thrown on the plate and the sides were ridiculously small portions. ?The ribs were burnt on the outside and tough. ?I could go onm and on about all the great bbq i've had in the south but thats neither here nor there. ?What really bothered me was that the food just wasnt cooked well and everything was just super salty. ?I'm glad that i finally checked the place out and its certainly an experience but I would not go back.

Giving it 4 stars for it's great service and for the best wings I've had. Would have given it 5 if I felt the ribs were great, but they were just good. The ribs fell off the bone, but were not very flavorful. Mac n cheese was ok. I was expecting a very homemade taste for the mac, but it was a bit generic and so was the sweet potato. I will DEFINITELY go back for the wings. They were the sesame hiosin flavor wings. Also, the server was great and recommended coming back on a Thursday night when they have a jazz band playing.

I've seen a video of them preparing the ribs before, and let me tell you, it tasted every bit as good as it looked on the video. You can taste every layer of flavor and texture, from the slowly smoked meat to the tangy and spicy dry rub. It was love at first bite. And don't you ever forget the salt potatoes. Little baked potatoes drowned in an oregano butter sauce? I told my friend I can die happy after that meal. Go go go! It's not in a totally shady part of Harlem and even if it is, remember you can totally die happy after a meal of ribs and salt potatoes.

After much anticipation, last night I decided the time was right, the mood was ripe, and I was ready to try the dinosaur. I enjoy going to Fairway in Harlem more than I would like to admit, and so I always found myself near Dinosaur BBQ, and hear great things constantly. ?My date and I figured we could breeze right in on a whim and grab a table. ?First. ?Epic. ?Mistake. DO NOT go here without a reservation - the wait is ridiculous. ?We waited close to 50 minutes, and it doesn't help that the staff is extremely slow and relaxed, letting empty tables sit open for 10 plus minutes while the lobby is filled to the brim with people waiting to be seated, chit chatting and making jokes while all the hungry people give them angry death stares and try to mentally count all the names that have been called to gain some vague mental picture of when they might be seated. ? Still, to be honest, things like this don't bother me so much that I would give them a bad rating; next time I know to get a reservation, problem solved. Once seated, our waitress was an absolute peach, and knew we wanted to order right away after being prisoners to the wait list. ?What's better, totally unexpectedly, the food came out quick and pipin hot! Now for the good stuff: the food = amazing. ?We got an order of boiled peel and eat shrimp, which were both bomb and huge, a winning combination, and chicken wings with salt potatoes, mac and cheese, and corn bread. ?The salt potatoes were meh, but the mac and cheese was seriously off the hook. ?If you get an option for two sides, go for both mac and cheese, it's all you could ever want, all you will ever need. The chicken was great also, you could tell it was slowly BBQed with care and love, not some flash fried dirty ass wing covered in sauce. Overall this place was a huge success for a super indulgent dinner, and not too expensive. ? Just don't walk here, otherwise you'll have to roll home, and that will take a while.

I went there for a dinner on Sunday night. I arrived at the restaurant at 9:40pm. A lady at the front kindly sat my fiancé and myself at a high table. She said no table was available ( 90% of the entire restaurant was empty...) but we can certainly order at the high top tables. There were 3-4 wait staffs passing by. I tried waiving and calling them. Nobody looked. The restaurant was not that busy. We waited for someone to come until 10:00pm. Finally my fiancé grabbed someone. The wait staff said after 10:00pm they do not serve. She said she had to check with her manager if she can serve the food. Then we realized the wait staffs purposely ignored us until 10:00 pm so they didn't have to serve the food. We were waiting until the manage to come. By 10:20 pm, nobody came. The restaurant still had tables where the food was still serving w/ beer bottles. I was confused. I went up to one waitress at the cash register next to the bar and told her we have been waiting for a waitress to come. She called our waitress's name -the waitress was literally 2 steps in front of where a lady and ?I were standing. She completely ignored us and ran away. The lady at the bar called the manager's name-who also was right in front of us. She called "Steve!" 4-5 times. Im not sure if he heard her because he looked like he was drunk from a table where he was serving food to. It looked like it was his friends table. The manager walked away without even looking at the lady who called his name. He was literally 2 steps away from us. My fiancé ?and I got out of the Dinosaur Barbecue and headed to somewhere else to eat. This place used to have a good service w/ good food. BUT a drunk manager w/ the wait staffs who ignore customers because they do not want to work? Who knows what is happening in that kitchen?

Overrated!!!!!!!! So damn disappointed!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Let me say that I absolutely love ribs! I heard the best things abt Dino and decided to try it. Maybe it was an off day, but the ribs left me want to leave and check into a Chili's. It was that bad. In fact, I may love Chili's much more than this place. I tried the fried green tomatoes. There were around 4 on the plate. 3 were overfried and didn't taste much like anything but burnt mush and the last one...well...I heard great things about this dish too....the last one was truly unbelieveable. Had they make all 4 of them the same way, I would've been in love with this dish. I still can't believe they can deliver such crap to me. To put one perfectly good tomato is like a tease..... like I can't have any more. Anyway, I will never venture off to the north end for Dino's. Also, this place is full of after work businessmen and their assistants. Bad atmosphere. Again, overrated! Service was just OK!

I like the atmosphere. And the food is pretty good. I don't eat lots of BBQ, so I'm not a very good judge of the quality of the que here. I started with a small order of wango tango wings and they were very good. Tasty and not too spicy. Then I had the Tres Hombres with mac and cheese and the BBQ beans. The mac and cheese here really is good. The beans were a little different, but good. And the meats were all tasty. The ribs could have been more tender, but they were still good. For desert I had a flight of beer. Not a bad Friday afternoon.

Be careful! This isn't a Jurassic Park themed barbecue joint like I thought it was. When I asked if Jeff Goldblum was there they looked at me like I was crazy! All that aside, they have huge delicious ribs that make you feel like you're Fred Flintstone, (and not just because you aren't wearing any shoes), but because in the opening sequence of his hit show "The Flintstones", he finds himself burdened with a gigantic platter of ribs. UNLIKE the Flintstones however, these ribs are NOT made out of actual dinosaurs which was literally my only problem with it. I thought I had been fooled enough after I went to Galaxy Diner and found out that it wasn't actual Astronaut food. Thank god I exist to help you all.

As a former Southerner - I take my BBQ seriously. ?Now although the best ribs can only be found in the South, Dinosaur does an excellent job trying to convince you that you are below the Mason Dixon line - the fact that they serve sweet tea helps! ?My best lady-friend and I shared the Sweetheart special - a full rack of ribs, four sides, and corn bread . ?The ribs were plump and juicy - made even better drenched in Dino's bbq sauce (I prefer mixing the original and hot). ?We ordered the mac'n cheese, candied yams, carrot and raisin salad, and baked beans as our sides. All very tasty - I also highly recommend the salty potatoes that I have had on other occasions. ?On top of that hunk of good meat, we ordered fried green tomatoes for the table - my only complaint is that there were five of them and four of us - super-size that for us please!!!!

Wth happened to this place?!?!? Been here few times in the past few yrs prior to its renovations and was probably worth 3 stars back in the day. We went with a group of 14 and the service was horrible. Unsure if this was because the 20% gratuity is already included and they didn't care or because the service is just what it was...horrible. We had to ask for water 3 times for the tables, apps were all room temperature including the wings and the food came out almost an hour later. Ribs & brisket were subpar and the chicken was flavorless aside from the skin. If youve had real bbq then you know what to expect. The bday boy received a glop of peanut butter with some chocolate crumbs for dessert which we believe was supposed to be their version of Peanut butter pie. Basically, youre going to pay for the name and the advertisement that they pay in nyc tour guide books.

If you're looking for drinks and great BBQ, this is your place. Nestled off the beaten path in Harlem, you cant get any better. The servings are pretty large and their combos are best shared. In fact, when we go with large groups.. we literally make it a huge feast where forks are flying all over one anothers plates. (for those who dont mind others picking on your plate) . Try their brisket and Roasted Whipped Sweet Potatoes with Spicy Nut topping. ?You wont be dissapointed. the wait can be a bit long, but the bar is a great place to wait. w/ a ton of potent drinks that'll get you warm and fuzzy pretty quick!

The first time I tried to eat here, my friend tried and failed (thanks Tan N.) to make a reservation for a large group of us to come . ?We didn't realize you had to make reservations a week in advance and settled for eating at a lesser bbq joint. ?With this knowledge, we decided to make a reservation first (a week or so in advance) so that we could finally eat here. ?And I have to say, I'm glad we did. The food overall was good, but the barbecued meat was appropriately the star of the meal. ?I ordered the large family combo platter and the fried green tomatoes and we split that between 4 people. ?We were worried it wouldn't be enough food, but it was definitely more than enough. The fried green tomatoes were good, but the price was ridiculous. ?$9 for 5 slices of breaded, fried unripened tomatoes seems a bit steep. ?It was delicious, but the portion size was tiny. The family combo platter however, was a great value. ?For $60 (split between 4 people) you get: a rack of ribs, pulled pork and beef brisket, a whole chicken, corn bread, 3 sides including: mac n cheese, sweet potatoes, beans. The meats were great. ?The ribs were smoky, tender, and delicious. ?The same could be said about the other meats. ?The ribs had a nice bark, and were just delicious. ?The sides however, were disappointing. ?While the mac n cheese was great, the beans and the sweet potato along with the corn bread were average to mediocre. Overall, a great place to get barbecue. ?It's quite a trek to get here if you're not around the UWS to begin with, but its definitely worth the trip.

this most recent encounter was my first and definitely not my last. i've always heard mixed reviews about dinosaur through friends, eff what you heard because this place is the BOMB. i didn't encounter such a long wait because i had went on a tuesday, but even then it was still packed. so, between two famished girls we managed to completely clear 3 sides- macaroni, french fries and salted potatoes - swag sampler plate for 2, a half rack of pork ribs and a cheeseburger. it was a lot, but you have to go all out. get the swag sampler plate, it has all of the sampled appetizers - deviled eggs, fried green tomatoes, chicken wings, shrimp and veggies. the fried green tomatoes were so good - everything is deep fried to a golden crisp that crumbles at your first bite and melts in your mouth. you also cannot leave without doing at least a half rack of pork ribs, the rest is at your discretion. oh and stick to beer or the drinks on the menu, the bartender who was mixing my drinks that night was inconsistent and seemed to be a little weak in knowledge.

my one complaint is that this place has always been packed when i've gone. i'm gonna be brief, as the juice is low in the laptop, and the bus is almost back to the city. food, beer selection, ambiance is all that you'd want from a manhattan bbq joint, esp if hill country is lesser to your liking (hill country is my fave in nyc). all the 'q is good, really good, as are the fixin's. i like the atmosphere, and altho cannot drink beer (slight allergy) here, i'll suck it up and pay the price. its fun. consider the big-ass pork plate,but you're liikely to be happy w/ whatever you get. my aunts have lived in SYR for most of her life, yet i've not gone. that said, i KNOW this is a very different place than that.

it was my 5th day in NYC, i had been taking public transportation everywhere so instead of asking the local friends i had which buses or trains i should take, i went a head with bullhead and checked out hopstop for which trains to take. i ended up taking two of them, and walking 11 blocks. it was one bus ride away, since uh, i was staying in the bronx. i celebrated my 11 block walk with the two meat combo platter, ribs (duh) and brisket. i also might have potentially celebrated my aching legs with by downing a whole lot of whiskey. it was 11am. the food was fantastic, tender, and well prepared. the service was also fantastic, i had a lot of fun making fat jokes with the server, who looked like they would rather die than laugh at my jokes, you know, since they were working. i tipped her well though, because i was pretty obnoxious and because i was stupid drunk by the time 11:45 rolled around and i had to walk the 11 blocks back to take two more trains back, to walk back muttering about the hardships of this dang old city. on a real note, the food is fantastic, the decor is fun, and the servers are friendly. worth all 4 of my stars.

What the hell? How do they get 4 stars and Rack and Soul only 3.5? Fun atmosphere can't compensate for mediocre barbecue! Having tried Rack and Soul just a week or so prior, I could NOT understand the hype here. The bbq was just ok, measured against places I've tried all over the country it really fell into the mediocre pile. I have only tried a few Harlem spots but I don't see how this is THE place. My favorite items were the wings and the corn side dish - not a good sign for a bbq place! That and they have cheap beer flights which is cool. The place is huge but the wait can easily be 40 minutes to 2 hours, we had a reservation but I guess they gave it away since we were 15 minutes late. This produced an hour wait. So I am confused why people flock to this place and wait in the long lines. It is a fun atmosphere and accomodates large groups, has good bbq sauces on the table is all I could see. I tried a lot since we were in such a big group - fried green tomatoes (good but not amazing), wings - excellent, ribs - the worst part, pretty dry, chicken - pretty juicy, pulled pork - ok, not as good as rack and soul, and brisket - on the dry side, really stingy portion in the combo. I would stick to Hill Country for brisket. It was plenty of food cause there was so much chicken but I wasn't too impressed with the large combo portion size for ribs and beef. That's fine though cause it wasn't that good. Service here was very friendly, though it was tough to get service at times - its just too big and crowded to get their attention at times In summary - Rack and Soul was so much better in taste, portion size, and value. It could have been an off day (another set of friends went later in the night and had the same impression) but I have no desire to give it another shot. We brought a friend from out of town and she was really disappointed being her only impression of NY bbq.

I can't believe this is what all the hype is about. ?Dinosaur is super overrated. ?The ribs were so-so and the sides, both the selection and the taste, were straight-up WEAK. ?Daisy Mays blows this place out of the water. ?Honestly, even the mediocre Southern Hospitality is way better. ?Never again making the trek.

This is one of the busiest and best BBQ restaurants in NY. Don't believe me? Go on any day particularly in the evenings. Without a reservation, the wait alone is an hour and half with the crowds swarming into the restaurant. Although the food is worth it, I would highly recommend a reservation. I love their chicken wings and mac n cheese!! Their ribs are so tender and ?succulent! My usual order is the half chicken and a full rack of ribs to share with my group of friends/family. Their sweet tea is so refreshing! This is definitely a place to bring groups of co-workers, friends, family for a big hearty meal. Some of the local favorites I often see are rapper/actor Ice T with his wife Coco, actor Paul Giamatti, and Spike Lee. I can't wait to go back soon!

Will someone please tell me what is in their Mac n' cheese?! ?I am from NC where the mac n' cheese is considered a vegetable, and the pulled pork needs no sauce. ?For being in NYC, Dinosaur came close to satiating these needs while living near Columbia. ?The place can get packed, but if you sit at the bar, you can watch a game, and get quick service.

GREAT BBQ! Ive heard a lot about this place and was supposed to go a few times but never could make it. ?Finally I went with my boyfriend and my friend and her fiancee. ?After spending the day in a damp and dreary city with my boy and walking the soggy streets yet having fun it was time for some grub (I mean i had made Matt spend a good hour and a half in Victoria's Secret, the flagship store near Times Square, during a Saturday while I tried on oodles of bras). ?So after contacting our friends, it was the obvious choice (especially them coming from good ol' Jersey). ? We didn't have to wait long luckily, but the place was crowded as all hell! ?It was bumpin....and we lucked out with a small table right next to the window. ? It was a warm late summer night and we were starving. ?Having such appetites, the guys each ordered the biggest and most expensive dish they could find on the menu - something with ribs, half a chicken, brisket and pulled pork with two sides... absolute insanity. ?Best part.... my guy managed to eat wings before this w my friends fiancee and also finish his entire plate, along with some of mine. ?I ordered brisket and ribs and mac and cheese along w coleslaw as my sides. ?The mac and cheese was to die for!!! To start we had ordered wings for the boys and southern style pull and peel shrimp.... garlicky and good... it was yummy.... my friend had a few too many and didnt feel quite well... but what do you expect when you eat a pound of shrimp almost by yourself haha!?!? No dessert for us because it was too much food.... but everything was delicious. ?The atmosphere was somewhat southerny... and the service wasn't the best but with the amount of ppl it was alrighty. ?4 STARS!

tres hombres. a spirited serving of bar-b-que pork, texas beef brisket & bar-b-que ribs. get in my belly. all the time. but back to the beginning: your entire party needs to be present to be seated, and the bar was a fun place to wait for their arrival. we were seated promptly after everyone showed up, which made our rumbling tummies happy. fried green tomato app was really yummy, but just kind of tasted like something fried and good. i didn't get a lot of tomato. but...fried. mmmm. and wings lived up to their hype. we got hot (wango tango) and hotter (garlic chipotle) and my idiot brother got his own plate of hottest and was immediately covered in sweat. the waiter warned him multiple times... aside from my tres hombres, my dining mates got a variety of main dishes, including 3/4 racks, the pork+rib combo plate, korean bbq ribs, and bbq chicken. we loved everything with the exception of the korean bbq and bbq chicken, which were deemed not up to par with the other plates and dishes that you could easily find elsewhere. sides were delicious. really good mac & cheese with an interesting flavor - almost like a mac & cheese/macaroni salad hybrid. and YES for the syracuse salt potatoes in creole butter. make that your potato side over whipped/fries. ? cornbread was dry, but beer and sweet tea were delicious. i also felt like i was transported to fort wilderness at disney world, and i mean that in the best way possible. very cool theme-y atmosphere- a welcome and refreshing change from the loads of places in the blocks south of here that try way too hard to be too cool. i look forward to going back - would be really fun for a birthday dinner. and i love that they are on opentable!!

5 Stars for the Sweet tea alone! I'm from Georgia and can say, it's better than some of the places from my small southern town. The food also tastes just like down south bbq joints. It brings me back to my fav bbq place in GA, if you dont like this bbq, you either dont like bbq or your wanting NYC to to make a classic food all snazzy. But, back to 4 stars for the food not being hot. It was, warm.... but not hot like it should be. Although, they were extremely busy so maybe it sat for a second before someone could run it to our table. And I never got my salt potatoes, but the server came to us and said they were out and offered us something else to replace it and something for free. I was full and did not want another side but asked for maybe a dessert instead. He listed All of the desserts and described them well, and SOLD me out Peanut butter pie. He brought out 2 pies in a to go box for my boyfriend and I. So back to my 5 star rating. The service is GREAT (angel the waiter was awesome). Sweet tea is outstanding. The bbq sauce on the table, sooo good. I'd say the Mac and cheese is just ok, and id pass on the fried green tomatoes if your expecting them to taste like they do in the south (they DONT). Def recommend this place, and we'll be back! Oh and great bar/beer selection! GET The Peanut Butter PIE, it is insanely good!!

I can't believe how bad this place was. I had heard about it before, and after reading all these amazing reviews I was expecting something at least edible, and this food just wasn't. The BBQ chicken wings were OK, but pretty unexciting considering they were covered in what should have been delicious BBQ sauce. I have NEVER not finished a full rack of ribs before I came here, these were the worst I've ever had. The ribs were blackened to the point where the skin comes off in hard ass shards. You take one bite and all the skin comes off in one shot. These were NOT falling off the bone by any means, they were downright chewy and rough, which doesn't happen when you slow cook meat. And the meat itself has no flavor beyond what was on the skin- which itself was placed on the table practically dry. I had to smother them with the BBQ sauce which didn't help much, the sauce was too sweet for me. I will say that they were hands down the meatiest ribs I've ever had. They were joined together with a LOT of fat though, and picking through the fat and hard gross skin just wasn't worth it for the taste. The cornbread was a joke, it was literally the size of a silver dollar and tasted like crap. The BBQ rice didn't taste anything like BBQ, the Creole potato salad was just regular potato salad with some spice sprinkled lightly on the top. The sweet potatoes were alright but had a little too much spice in them. The sweet potato pecan pie is just sweet potato pie with some pecans on top- but it was still the best thing I ordered from them that night, which isn't saying much. The portions were not big, especially the sides which were actually tiny. Maybe I came on an off night but I still don't think I'll be giving them another shot, it was just that bad.

Above average, thats all I can really say. ?I wanted to give it a 3 stars for the huge hype it received, but I just couldnt because in all honesty this place is at least 3.5 stars. ?Im from Texas, so I know good bbq. ?And if this place were in Texas it would be about average, maybe a little below average. ?Where to begin, when you are walking to this restaurant from the outside you do NOT smell the aroma of smoke, that was my first inclination this wasnt going to be that great. ?Good bbq places, you can smell the restaurant at least 3-5 blocks away. ?Now it was my first time coming so I wanted to try a little of everything. ?I ordered the 1/4 rack ribs with Texas brisket. ?The 2 sides I chose to accompany the entree at no cost was the mac and cheese and the bbq fried rice. ?I also ordered the pulled pork slider. ?So as you can see the only meat I didnt try was the chicken and the sausage link. ?The pulled pork was pretty bland and required a lot of their sauce to have any taste. ?The consistency was decent though. ?The brisket were not moist at all, and not nearly fatty enough as well, some of the bigger pieces are borderline hard to chew. ?The brisket should melt in your mouth. ?As for the ribs, it was NOT fall off the bone. ?The flavors were pretty good however, just not cooked right. ?The 3 condiments of sauces at each table were: Mango habanero (too tangy, not spicy enough), Garlic chipotle (pretty good), and the Original (a good medium). ?Now the best bbq doesnt even need sauce, and a good measure of the quality of the bbq is the sauce ratio. ?If more sauce is required to make the meat taste good, the worst the bbq. ?I needed extra sauce for the pulled pork and the brisket. ?I could have used a tad touch more sauce on the ribs. ?As for the sides, the mac and cheese was undercooked, but the flavor was good. ?The bbq fried rice was probably my favorite thing served, tons of flavor and good ratio of meat, to veggies, to seasonings. ?The cornbread was decent, not too dry, but could use a more unique flavor. The pricing is actually better then what I would have expected. ?If i do come back i'll try the fried green tomatoes and maybe some chicken.

I was fortunate enough to be introduced to Dinosaur Bar-B-Que at a BBQ a neighbor of The Brit was having. ?That neighbor also happened to be the son of the owners of Dinosaur BBQ. ?He's a humble guy that neighbor, and didn't brag or promote the restaurant or his family. ?He just knew we like BBQ, made good BBQ and then told us about his family's restaurant. ?So when The Brit moved out to NYC, we just HAD to go. First tip, make reservations or be prepared to wait. ?I'd like to say you could saddle up to the bar and sip a beer from the extensive list, but you likely won't find a spot. We were seated about an hour later and found ourselves drooling over the possibilities that lay ahead. ?We were, of course, starving and everything sounded fantastic. ?We ordered the fried green tomatoes to start and shrimp to start. ?The shrimp were terrible... cold and gross. ?There was no warning that they would be cold and when we told our server we didn't like them, he just shrugged it off, leaving us to pay for a plate of uneaten shrimp. ?I had a chicken and rib plate with a side of macaroni and cheese and buttered potatoes. ?The mac and cheese was great, and the potatoes were just OK. ?The chicken was good and the sauce as good as the first time we tried it beach-side in Santa Monica. ?The Brit had the rib combo with a side of coleslaw and baked beans. ?The slaw was just OK, and it was one of the few things, with the shrimp of course, we didn't like. ?The ribs... great. ?Not an ounce of meat left on a single bone. ?The sauce is so yummy here. ?We bought two bottles to give as Christmas presents back in Blighty. ?It went over well. The decor inside is alright, I like the lights that were strung up most of all. Made it feel a little romantic, and a little like a nighttime summer festival picnic. ? Service was probably the most disappointing part, but the food and each others' company made it hardly an issue.

an intimidating 1h45m to 2h wait turned out to be just 45min... and i'm thankful for that because it was our first time there and we would have missed out! having had some amazing barbecue in texas last month, my boyfriend and i were eager to give the famed dinosaur bbq a shot. ?the restaurant was packed at 730pm on a sunday night over memorial day weekend but as i mentioned earlier, the wait time was cut drastically because a lot of people were not claiming their tables. ?:) ?we had a couple drinks at the bar and were seated shortly afterwards. the wait staff was very friendly, and the food came out promptly. ?we had the fried green tomatoes (absolutely delicious, omg) to start, the churrasco chicken plate and the brisket/pulled pork plate. ?my bf had the chicken which was good, but i definitely liked my plate better. ?he did,however, order the mac and cheese as a side which we DEVOURED before anything else. ? the portions were not huge which was a pleasant surprise.... unless you got one of the massive rib orders. ? we didn't try dessert because we were stuffed, so unfortunately i can't speak on that. overall, i think i'd go back if i was in the area, but it's a long way from brooklyn.

Very friendly and helpful staff. Cute place. Food was tasty. We had the swag sampler w four different apps. The deviled eggs were a tad salty, but the rest were tasty. The greens, potatoes, and mac and cheese were good. We tried the beef, pulled pork, and pork ribs. All were tasty. Loved the root beer on tap and the fact that they do have a full bar ( we were there for lunch). Notice that I say tasty and not fantastic. Was it the best meat I've ever tasted? No. ?Was it the best food I've ever had? No. Would I go back? Yes. As I mentioned, everything was good-just not the greatest.

I've had my share of delicious BBQ. After a 4 hour shopping trip to Fairway we were hungry and headed here being the only place around ?the area. The place was decorated cute, with the whole country-bbq theme. The staff was very nice. But the food. It wasn't anything special. In comparrsion to the other well known BBQ places in the city this placed came across to me as more of a chain, with decent low priced food. The brisket was a little fatty, and the portions were rationed. I would recommend this place for a group of a lot of friends, or to try a new neck of the woods.

If I could give Dinosaur BBQ more than 5 stars, I would. How can you beat awesome BBQ, great beer selection, and a fun casual atmosphere. ? I was here for a birthday dinner for a good friend with 14 people. ?We tried just about everything. Their wings are fantastic- juicy, super flavorful and tender- this is a must order! ?The fried green tomatoes were also great- probably one of the best I've had. ?The iceberg wedge was also very good if you want a salad. ?It was the bacon that they served on the salad that really made it special. ?My table ordered a side on bacon after we had it because it was that good! ?As for the BBQ- the pulled pork shoulder was tender and absolutely delicious! ?Their ribs were just right- meat was tender and well marinated. ?The beef brisket was not my favorite but some of my friends really enjoyed the flavor of the beef. ?The sides were very tasty but my favorites were the BBQ beans and the mac n' cheese. ? Nothing on the dessert menu stood out but the key lime pie was the best of all the pies we tried. ?The beer selection was extensive - what else can we ask for ?

Really really good ribs. The brisket was a bit disappointing but the bacon and cheese on my sandwich covered up its dryness. Sides were also good including the deviled eggs and fried green tomatoes. I really wish Dinosaur was closer/easier to get to......

Love the ribs, the mac n cheese, lemonade and sweet tea. DEFINITELY GET THE SWEET TEA AND LEMONADE. It gets super crowded on weekends so make reservations! Also, they've lovely outdoor seating if you'd like. Bathroom is nasty but we're not eating in the bathroom so whatever.

I love this place. The food is great and the service is good. Do yourself a favor though and make a reservation. A friend and I went there at 5pm on a Saturday expecting it was early enough to get a seat without much fuss but it was packed already. We waited close to an hour for a table. They do have a few community tables that are first come first serve but unless you want to sit with a bunch of people you don't know (I usually don't) expect that it will be difficult to get a table on a weekend.

I'm a fan of the original dinosaur in Syracuse having went to school there for 4 years and while I don't think the NYC branch is as good as the Syracuse branch I still think it's the best BBQ in the city. ?If you think you've had good ribs in New York City but haven't eaten at Dinosaur, think again. ?The only letdown is no mashed potato side dish. ?Every dish I've ever had there is positively mouth watering, the ribs fall right off the bone and the beef brisket and big ass pork plate cannot be beat. ?I count the days between each trip to the Dinosaur. ?It's truly a slice of Syracuse heaven in Harlem.

worth the trek!! the portions are huge but my friend and i ordered sensibly. we split the fried green tomatoes appetizer and a pulled pork platter with cornbread, mac and cheese and tasty veggies (some sort of beans & greens) on the side. then we had to go for the sweet potato pie for dessert. and of course beer. they have a great beer selection, our waiter was attentive and helpful, and all of the food we ate was great! we left quite happy and not over-stuffed. we went early -- around 6 on a friday night so we could get to a show at the apollo -- and the place very quickly filled up. so i imagine that the wait gets really long.

Holy southern food awesomeness. ?The food here was fan-friggin-tastic and the restaurant itself is charming in a bit of a divey way. ?The sides are incredible, as well as all of the meat. ?I know that from my one visit because my friends and I got the family feast - chicken, brisket, ribs, mac and cheese, potatoes and cornbread for about $60 total. ?Amazing deal! ?The wait is pretty long here (90 minutes on a Wednesday night at 8pm) but if you hang around the bar area you can usually grab a table in much less time.

Best BBQ Wings i've EVER had--hands down. I have had a couple of their pulled pork sandwiches and enjoyed them as well. But what brings me back are the wings. I order up a dozen of these dinosaur sized wings and manage to devour each and every one. I just cannot put them down once I get started. My biggest complaint about this place is that sooooooooooooooooo many people are there for dinner all the time that i've had to wait hours before. But since i willingly waited hours for these wings, that says a lot. I also really like their bbq sauce and have taken some bottles home--they sell them in the takeout area (I didn't steal them!) I highly recommend this place and specifically their wings.

Genuinely finger licking BBQ. ?The rids, chicken, pulled pork & let's not forget mac & cheese were all yum, yum, yum (that's right, a triple yum). ?Comfy atmosphere, good beer on tap selection but the place is just a mob scene (waited almost 2 hrs on a Friday night for a table for 4) and to top it all off you can't make a reservation. ?My recommendation, get it as take-out and while you wait for your take-out to be readied have a beer or two at the bar, just be ready to fight for a seat or resting spot.

food: me and girl friend got appetizer sampler, traditional sampler with mac'n'cheese/sauteed vegetable sides. the appetizers were portioned very well, enough to get a taste of all the best stuff but not an overwhelming amount so that you'd have no more space to fit things in your stomach. then our main course... the meats were pretty delicious. what I found especially good was the usage of spices. ribs were delish, as expected, sides were a little less impressive but it could also be because by the end of your indulgence a ginormous food coma is ready to dawn on you (cont. reading). service: we waited for 20 mins for a table for brunch on a saturday. good business indeed. the ladies were very amiable and friendly, good service i'd say. price: decent for what you get. that pretty much sums it up. decor: did not venture into the bar area, which is full service, because I find getting tipsy on a morning quite discouraging. the wooden indoors are very cozy, you get a small glimpse of the outside through the canvas-like red curtains. cute posters. food coma: I have never passed out so hard after a meal, ever in my short lifetime. very impressive. I went home and crashed for a good three hours. will I ever come back? maybe... let's first see if the food coma leaves any residues tomorrow.

i went to school at syracuse, home of the original dino, and this is far better than the original. beer selection and music are just awesome. the only downsides are the long waits and relatively poor service... but both of these can be negated by eating at the bar, which provides better access to aforementioned beer selection, great conversation with the bartenders (most of whom are from CNY), and the excellent blues music typically on display on friday and saturday nights.

Dinosaur BBQ takes me back to my StLMo summer days. Wango Tango wings were fabulous! Definitely a must order. Had the fried green tomatoes and they were great too, although I prefer mine a bit more fried. The ribs came out almost too hot to handle, but I couldn't stay away and used my napkin to hold on. The Syracuse potatoes are artery clogging buttery, but also delicious. I thought the baked beans were lacking though, could have used less brown sugar and more bacon. They've got a good selection of beer and I'm interested in the punch they've created. Go hungry and call for reservations, we waited an hour for 2 on a Friday night. I'll be going back and taking friends along for this mini-adventure to returning to my roots.

I've been to Dinosaur so many times that it would be easy to take them for granted....until the next time I go again! ?This is simply great comfort food. ?The BBQ is tasty and the appetizer and sides live up to the BBQ. ?The mac n cheese is smooth and creamy, the wings are messy and worth getting some sauce on your face for and of course, just awesome barbecue. ?The drinks, however, could use some umph, but there is a large selection of beer. ?It was always such a pain to wait for a table, but now you can reserve on Open Table.

My fav BBQ spot. Eat in or Take out is equally good. The restaurant used to be a barn. They gutted out the inside but kept the original structure. Looks really cool. If you want some back house bbq, this is the place to go. The service is excellent. Everyone is really friendly there all the time. Portions are awesome. You will get full. Drinks are great too. Try the Punch, fried green tomatos, and beef brisket. If you get a chance to sit and eat, make sure you look at some of the pictures hanging up on the wall. Some I wish I can get as screensavers. Oh and tag up their bathroom too. The place is awesome!

I went here for lunch one day and I had a man-sized appetite. So I ordered a full rack of ribs. The ribs were good. But not great. I've definitely had better ribs. But they were pretty serviceable I suppose. It's pretty hard to mess up ribs IMO. But the service was bad. My group of three were seated at the last table ALL THE WAY in the back of the restaurant. Where we were then ignored by the waitresses. We finally tracked down a waitress to take our order. But the food took forever to come out and we saw our waitress again only once after that. We had to track her down again to pay. They must not like money at Dinosaur BBQ. I can't really compare it to other BBQ places in NYC. But in my overall BBQ eating experience, as BBQ lover, it was average. I would need to visit again and try other dishes, and other service, to make a more definitive determination of Dinosaur's quality.

"From BBQer to BBQ Joint" I love the grill! And I love BBQ. I was satisfy after this meal. ?Really big fan of BBQ and that's why I had to come all the way up to Harlem to try this place out when I was in NYC. ? On to the food: We got the full rib rack + the brisket platter. I was stuff by the time I was finished with this. 6 side, oh wait 7 sides since we got an extra order of baked beans because someone ate the first batch and wanted more. The BBQ fried rice was just delicious. ?This is what I usually do for BBQ fried rice, left overs goes in for the mean and that's all you really have to say. ?The coleslaw was also really well done, not slopped with male everywhere. ?The greens - Yucky... Never liked them.(not my choice of sides) Mac n Cheese done right! and half mashed/half potato salad. ?The ribs that I had, could've been better. Brisket also could've been better. ?My guess what went wrong was that they were too packed to do it right. ?They had to pull the ribs and brisket early from the pit. This causes the meat not to be as tender as it could've been. ?I think 1 hour for both of the items would've just made it perfect. ?But yeah, don't get me wrong. ?It was still good. I think that this was a super busy night for them. ?The wait was over an hour long, that's why we just tried getting a seat in the lounge area. ?Which we ended up doing. Still have to wait around for at least 30 minutes for a seat in the lounge area. ?It's first come first serve for it, so when you see someone leave, grab the a seat. I want to come back when it's not so busy so they I can taste it there food at there peak!

I decided to take my boyfriend here for his birthday because i had read a lot of good reviews about the place. ?We got there and parked in a lot. ?On the short walk to dinosaur's from the lot we saw someone parking on the street. ?(mental note you can park on the street). ?We get in the restaurant and it was packed! We had 6:30 reservations but the city was crazy with traffic so we got there at 7. ?Even though it was crowded and we were late they were still able to seat us within a few minutes. The place smelled great and had a real barbeque kind of feel. ?We sit down and it felt like about 10 minutes before someone came over to get our drink order. ?It was really crowded though so i didn't mind. ?The table next to us got their food and it looked delicious. ?I think it was a meal for two. ?Our food comes and honestly i was disappointed. ?The plate was too big for the food, so mine looked kind of empty. ?my chicken wasn't anything special, but it wasn't bad. ?my boyfriends food was barely warm. ?the ribs were REALLY dry. ?and the cornbread was also dry. ?The traffic getting there and back, combined with the food makes it a place i probably wont be going to again. ?On our way out we saw the people we had seen parking on the street, still sitting there waiting for a table. ?I hope they were happier with their food than me and my bf were. ? Reservations are a must.

Only 3 as I'm basing on the average of 2 visits. ?The first visit got a 2 for cold sides and mediocre flavor. ?Last night I had Dino BBQ takeout and the meat was good, the mac and cheese was really good, and the dessert was FREAKING AMAZING. ?The peanut butter chocolate pie thing had the consistency of cheesecake + was like a super bomb Reeses (which I don't even like very much). ?4 of us devoured 2 pies and 1 ok sweet potato pecan pie. ?The dessert ups my rating of the place bc it was just that good. ?Is it wrong to go into a BBQ place only to order their sweets?

Since I signed up to Blackboard Eats I've been getting special deals to certain restaurants. A few weeks ago I got a 30% off lunch or dinner coupon for Dinosaur Bar-B-Que so I decided to try it today. Dinosaur Bar-B-Que has a reputation of being one of the best and authentic barbecue spots in Manhattan so I was pretty excited when I received the coupon. Dinosaur Bar-B-Que is on 131 Street and 12 Avenue which is all the way up in Harlem making it kind of out of the way for me but Dinosaur Bar-B-Que is worth the train ride. The space is massive and decorated sort of like a stereotypical truck stop and a saloon mixed together. There are gas station signs that line the walls along with graffiti all over the bathrooms and each table has a different set of chairs. Though personally I prefer the decor of Wildwood BBQ, its the most "elegant" (and I use elegant loosely) out of all the barbecue spots in Manhattan, Dinosaur Bar-B-Que has a very authentic feel and is definitely better looking than R.U.B. and Blue Smoke. The place is packed and everyone from all over NYC comes there. You have your Harlem and Upper West Side locals. Then you have your business men, students and large men with beer bellies huddling at the bar. The menu at Dinosaur Bar-B-Que is pretty typical and features Pork Ribs, brisket, BBQ Sandwiches, chicken wings amongst other things. The prices at Dinosaur Bar-B-Que are outstanding. I was at Dallas BBQ the day before, which is hands down the worst BBQ place in Manhattan...worse than Daisy May's, and Dallas and Dinosaur Bar-B-Que are priced competitively and for the quality and portion size you get at Dinosaur Bar-B-Que, I'd say you get the better deal at Dinosaur Bar-B-Que. I ordered the half rack of pork ribs plate which comes with 7 pork ribs, two sides and cornbread and is priced at $15.95. At Wildwood I get a half rack of ribs for $15.99...nothing more. Dinosaur Bar-B-Que serves their ribs dry so its your job to add their signature Barbecue sauce to them if you feel the need. The ribs are fantastic and the meat basically falls off the bone. Though personally I prefer the rub at Hill Country better, I'd say the ribs themselves are a bit better tasting than Hill Country's and I loved Dinosaur Bar-B-Que's BBQ sauce. It wasn't too spicy or overpowering and added the right amount of sweetness. The fries were pretty good as was the mac & cheese and cornbread as side dishes. The service at Dinosaur Bar-B-Que is super friendly and makes you feel like you're at home and even though the restaurant is super crowded at all times, the service is never frazzled or creates a bad experience with the customer. I really enjoyed my lunch at Dinosaur Bar-B-Que. The barbecue was excellent, the prices are amazing and the decor and service were great as well. My only issue is that its a bit out of the way for me, but after tasting those fantastic pork ribs its worth the trip!

This place was amazing!!! After spending a week in New York and getting overpriced food that left much to be desired, we decided to try this place which I had heard about on a Food Network show. We had to go a little outside of Manhattan but it was well worth it. The BBQ and sides were some of the best I had ever had. I had the big ass pork plate withbaked beans, BBQ fried rice, and an added side of mac and cheese. The pulled pork was tender (obviously the way pulled pork should be), flavorful, and moist, the baked beans were sweet and tangy the way that I love to make them, and the fried rice was different but a nice change. I didn't know what to expect from the fried rice but I am wishing after having it that all BBQ joints had this as a side. It goes so well with BBQ! The mac and cheese was a little underwhelming though. I just remember thinking that I have had better (that's what she said, haha). The corn muffin that came with the meal was excellent as well. The husband ordered pretty much the same thing except his sides were the baked beans and coleslaw. He also enjoyed it. My husband loved the hot sauce and contemplated buying a bottle before he realized he could just order it online. For dessert I opted for peach cobbler. It was good but I have honestly had better. The rest of the food besides the cobbler and mac and cheese pretty much rocked my world!!! As far as the cost, it was on par with what you would pay at a Famous Daves. When we got the bill (after paying 60.00 throughout the week for two sammiches), my husband said that was more like it. You can't beat the value and serving amounts of this Dinosaur in a place like NYC. The service was great as well. Our waiter was attentive and obviously knew we were from out of town so he let us know what was good to order. The location like I said is pretty far from the beat in path. The neighborhood around it seems a little scary to walk through at night (we had to do that to get to the subway). The restaurant itself very much looks like a dive inside which I think is what they were going for. Anyways, to sum it up, if you are looking for fancy schmancy upscale food in NYC, this is not the place for you. But if you are looking for down home good cookin at a reasonable price and a great value, make sure you go here and try it out. I sooooo wish we had one of these in AZ. ? :(

the best advice i can offer is to try and make a reservation. ?good luck getting a table with a regular sized group without waiting for about an hour+. ?just a shmorgishborg of beers to select from, some familiar some foreign. and we havent yet gotten to the food, so...lets. ?i had the club bbq chicken sangwich which was just a little bit o' awesome. ?the sides dominated as well, although it was def. my mistake not getting the mac and cheese. ?looked great. all in all, a great spot, just takes a while to get a seat. ?i give it 7 pascal units.

Fantastic barbecue! Went here with a party of sixty, some fantastic service with great ribs, chicken breast, cornbread, et al. With our reservation, everything was prepared for us, so I didn't get a chance to peek at the menu. Based on what I lunched on, I am sure that it would all have been great.

YUM! We waited an hour and half for a table Friday night because they had no reservations when I called in the night before (duly noted) but it was worth it. My bf doesn't eat pork, we ordered wings and the brisket plate to share, my friend ordered shrimp stuffs (I can't exactly remember) and some sides. Everything was fabulous, particularly the mac and cheese as others have stated and the wings were so tender, the BBQ sauce so incredible. Not the best, the brisket was moist but not mind blowing, the mashed sweet potatos went untouched, but we left full. Also, the bartender that night was generous, and we enjoyed stiff drinks while we waited. :)

Entirely worth the trek uptown, the pork and brisket plate is a great way to get the best of both worlds. ?The brisket has a nice smoky flavor and the sauces on the table are a wonderful compliment. ?In addition, they have a good selection of potent drinks, some of which come in decorative mason jars. ?The portions are perfect for sharing so choose your sides carefully and everyone can have a little bit of everything! I highly recommend the collard greens and the mac-n-cheese. ?Standards, yes -- but yummy standards!

The food here is really great. ?Took the family here about 2 months ago. ?Everyone loved the ribs. ?Two of my guests found the chicken to be a little undercooked. ?But other than that....food was great. ?I took the recommendations of Yelpers and was not disappointed. ?It was the first time I had Fried Green Tomatoes....Amazing. ?So many great dishes; just go by the suggestions offered here - you can't go wrong. The bar is HUGE. ?The drinks are F'-enomenal !!! ?Watch out for the Vodka Lemonade. ?3 of those babies will put you on your A@@. Cons: The only downside is that this place is so ridiculously popular; that it's almost always packed. ?So much so that they sometimes do not take reservations. ?Even with reserves -- you still might have to wait an extra 15-30 minutes. ? The noise level can be a bit loud It is true; your clothes will smell like the sauces from this place which is not good if you're going elswhere afterwards.

Damn, even with reservations we waited 30 mins, than another 30 to actually get the food. Everything tasted good. Ribs were awesome, Memphis style pulled pork sandwich was delicious, the sweet yams were amazing. However, the fried green tomatoes tasted like deep fried batter. I couldn't even taste tomato. I would come back with a lady friend.

Couldn't believe how disappointing a recent visit was. ?Hadn't been to Dinosaur for two years, and remembered ribs that were juicy, saucy, and falling off the bone. ?And didn't they used to offer three different varieties -- dry, wet, St. Louis (something like that??) On the Saturday of Memorial Day weekend, three adults and one kid went there and the ribs were none of the above. ?Bland, chewy -- like they forgot to cook them long enough and ran out of sauce. ?And the side orders ?-- the greens, succotash, even the mac n'cheese -- ?had that "been in a tin can" taste about them. ? A real letdown. ? Maybe since they've become a tourist attraction, they no longer care about the quality.

My favorite BBQ restaurant in NYC, which seems to have a lot of great ones these days. ?If you like smokey bbq, this is your place! ?Fantastic ribs and some tasty sides too (I always get the collard greens and the syracuse salt potatoes). ? I so badly want to love the Fried Green Tomatoes, but each time I've ordered them, they get consistently worse. ?Poor breading, under ripened tomatoes... ?I keep ordering them thinking they'll finally be like the one's I got while at the Syracuse restaurant. ?But no luck!

Considering I went ?on a goose-chase to Harlem, the food didn't buckle under the expectations. ?It was 330pm on a Friday so a long wait wasn't a problem and the service was good enough. ?Somewhat of a mixed crowd considering where it was, I assume due to the growing gentrification of Harlem. ? ?I ordered the pulled pork sandwich which i was craving the whole trip there. ? The bbq sauce was slightly splattered on and almost tasted like it was out of a bottle. ?Maybe I'm hard to please. I felt like I should've ordered the ribs to be able to judge how good this place really is. ?I have to say the mac and cheese side was AMAZING! ?It was a rush of so many different flavors, it's almost indescribable. ?The beer selection was great and priced fairly which rounded out a solid, affordable meal. All and all, it was worth the trip.

MMMM! I heart the dino! We went here for my bf's bday on a Thurs nite, and it was seriously good. Huge portions, not too expensive, great atmosphere. OK, so it was crowded, there were lots ?of tourists, and despite having a reservation we had to wait for 20 min, but still, it was worth it. I ordered the chicken wings (tasty) and the deviled eggs were awesome, and I don't even like deviled eggs! The Memphis style bbq plate is a must. PLUS it looked like a cheesy movie set but i mean that in the nicest possible way.

Dinosaur BBQ is friggin awesome! Yeah, it's a little out of the way for most of us but it's well worth the trip in my opinion.

I've only been once but I would definitely make the trip again so I can sample some different menu items.

Went here for lunch, it was good. The BBQ Cuban sandwich is what I had. It was good, although i wish the bread wasn't so soggy. The cornbread was not sweet which was disappointing to me, but if that's how you like it then this is the spot for you. The Mac and cheese was standard a little too cheese for me not a ton of flavor. I ordered the potato salad also, but i don't like potato salad so i don't know why i ordered it, cause i knew i wasn't going to eat it. All in all it was OK, but certainly wouldn't hike to the west side of harlem again to go to this place. I know better bbq joints.

As I mention before I review any BBQ establishment, my review is solely based on chicken platters and side orders because I do not eat red meat or pork. I was not impressed the chicken at all, but I admit the whole concept of a smoke pit within the restaurant is rather nice. The corn bread was solid (not the best, but not the worst). The sweet tea was a refreshing way to wash down food. So although my experience here wasn't the best, I wouldn't mind coming back for a random occasion.

We love their ribs! So smoky out and tender & moist inside, sometimes could be heavenly. Wings are also good but not to die for. We went there regularly at lease twice a month, if they have a place in Manhattan, we probably could go twice a week. They are trying to improve the quality of their sides recently. However, the ribs were kinda dry and not that flavorful the latest times we went there.

...Yes, the ribs were tender and juicy and came off the bone effortlessly. The properly smoke-ringed brisket melted in my mouth. The pulled pork was especially good, since it had shreds of lean, and fatty pork, as well as some crispy bits of skin, which I usually find sorely missing from most pulled pork around the city....

I've visited three of the four locations (haven't been to Troy yet) and I've enjoyed the experience everytime. The portions are generous and I find the prices reasonable. The meats are smoked to perfection. If I had to complain about anything, it would be the almost non-existant parking at the NYC location. Considering the heavy motorcycling influence of the interior decor, you'd think they'd at least provide motorcycle parking. Never had a problem in Rochester or Syracuse.

Just recently had dinner at the new location. Food still seems good although not as special as I last remembered it. The Memphis pulled pork sandwich was good. Mac n' cheese was the surprise hit of my meal. Deviled eggs were standard - but good. Chicken wings were not quite as large (no as many drumsticks provided) as last time, but they were nonetheless as good as I've had in the city. The selection of beers on tap and seasonals was pretty decent. Great group dinner spot.

perfect. go. GO. faster. the chipotle garlic wings, i'm fairly certain, would be the appetizer to my death-row-meal, if i were in such a situation. they moved across the street which momentarily scared the hell out of me. i stood there incredulous as my baby brother standing in the opposite direction pointed out 'hey, isn't it over there?' thank god, it was. i miss my 'nice tea', this delicious concoction of fresh plum and pear juice with rum. yum. i love the chicken, the ribs, the brisket.. all of it cooked perfectly and seasoned well. the sides are killer- seasonally available gingered sweet potatoes, syracuse salt potatoes [like a garlicky salt lick but more awesome], mac and cheese which i would kick a hamster for.. so, so good. the cornbread is also awesome. i used to live in the neighborhood and would frequent this joint after a day of.. whatever. good with friends for a couple drinks, good for date night. we had my 2 little nieces with us and the server was fantastic with them, so attentive and sweet with them even when they got bored. if you can keep little kids occupied so i can enjoy my dinner, your tip will get doubled. the only downside is the wait, at times. be prepared to put your name on a list and walk down riverside for a bit. though in my book, if a line is out the door and the wait is an hour and a half, there's a reason. this place rules. one of my top five ever in life.

If you went to college by one of their upstate locales (Rochester/Geneseo, Syracuse/Ithaca and now Albany/Troy) coming here is a real treat. We know it's not real southern BBQ so STFU already. But it's delicious, and there's no competition within 30 blocks. Fried green tomatoes and Syracuse salt potatoes are a must. Also the atmosphere is amazing. Reserve early (esp. for large parties)

I live really close to Dinosaur and it's become my go-to restaurant for a night out or takeout when I don't feel like cooking. It's consistently delicious. I always end up getting the same thing: fried green tomatoes, pulled pork sandwich - Memphis style (topped with coleslaw), iceberg wedge with house dressing and mac and cheese on the side. The fried green tomatoes are a must have. I'm not a big meat eater but I am addicted to their amazingly tender pulled pork. The highlight of the meal for me, though, is the house dressing on the iceberg wedge. It has their own BBQ sauce as a base and it is FANTASTIC. I would eat my own arm if it was covered in that dressing. The mac and cheese isn't the best I've ever had but it's still really good, and the pepper is a nice touch. For dessert, I'm a fan of their key lime pie. It's wonderfully tart and creamy. The sweet potato pecan pie is also quite good. My boyfriend is a huge fan of their cheesecake, but skip the bourbon caramel sauce unless you're a huge fan of bourbon.

The food and beer were delicious, the service was quick and courteous, and the atmosphere was enjoyable, but it would be a stretch to say the hassle of trying to go here was justified. The first time we trekked all the way up to Harlem to go here, I had asked on the phone if we could make a reservation, to which the hostess replied, "Oh, you can just walk in," meaning they won't be busy and we can get a table, right? When we got there, she told us it was a 3 hour wait! Why did she not mention this on the phone, I wondered. The next time, we made a reservation. After sifting through the availabilities ("uh...we have Saturday at 11 pm or Sunday at 3 pm"), we finally found a time on Thursday. I'd be totally willing to go through this whole song and dance if it was significantly better than any place else in Manhattan, but it wasn't the best BBQ I've ever had. I'd rather save time and go somewhere else closer, where the food is likely just as good and walking in with no reservation is possible. Overall, very good place, but not deserving of all the hype it gets.

This place has some of the best ribs I have had in NY and I love the potatoe salad. The chicken is petty good too. I would recommend making reseverations in advance for parties larger than 2.

Went here Sunday night 11/16 without a reservation and got here at 5:30 expecting to wait for a table. ?The restaurant and bar was packed. ?We got drinks and put our name on the list. ?We were told one hour wait. ?In 45minutes, we were seated at a table for four. ?Loved the ambiance, the pulse, the decor.. ?I felt like i stepped into Stubbs Barbeque in Austin. ?Loved the worn wodden planks, the music, the feel of the place. ?I didnt feel like i walked into a restaurant in Harlem. The food was great. ?We all shared the appetizer sampler for four, including boiled shrimp, spicy wings, fried green tomatoes and Devilled eggs. ?All delicious. ?Also we had a Iceburg Salad that was great with great tasting strips of smoky bacon on top. For an entree, two of us had a barbeque sampler of Ribs, pulled pork, and brisket. ?The brisket was probably the best ive ever had. ?the ribs were incredible, and i was too full to appreciate the pulled pork, but it was great too. ?My wife had the Churasco grilled chicken and she loved it too. ?The fries were yummy and the stir fried rice was great too. ?No food complaints. We didnt have dessert. ?Prices reasonable, beer selection (24 on tap) was fun. ?I got to try a few i never had before. After dinner I took my friends over to Fairway across the street. ?They had never been there before and loved the experience.

I personally don't understand the appeal. I've had lots of BBQ in my day, but when I heard of/went to Dinosaur, it wasn't worth all the hype. It tastes "different"- unlike any BBQ/sides I've ever had but that didn't make it great or memorable to me. Dinosaur is VERY popular and there are always a diverse crowd of people waiting in line, but I just don't get it. You might as well go to Dallas BBQ and get a better rate and extra large drinks! PS Don't ever order delivery from here. Yuck! If you enjoyed this place before, delivery doesn't match up to the in-house taste/experience.

I was hesitant about going all the way up to 131st St. (from 42nd) in the rain, but wow, that is some damn good food! The service was horrible, however I am still giving it 4 stars because it was that delicious. I don't even eat alot of meat (only chicken) so I was worried about being able to select something off of the menu and enjoy the full experience. With such a large menu, that was no problem. The best dishes I tried: fried green tomatoes, deviled eggs, and the wedge salad. My chicken sandwich was great too, although I think anything with their BBQ sauce on it would be delicious. Only thing not worth writing home about: the cornbread. Suggestion for the service: less bus boys and more waiter/waitresses. Overall great meal, great prices, I will definitely be heading back soon.

We made the trek up here on a cold night in January to get our bbq on. It helps to visit with several friends so you can all order different combos and simply share everything for the widest variety.

None of the food really stood out to my husband and I. The bbq ribs were only ok. The bbq chicken was good but not worth the trip out to Harlem in 20 degree weather. The cornbread and fried green tomatos were the only pretty good things we ate. The beef brisket was dry and not good and the salted potatos balls were gross. We waited 30 mins even though we had a reservation and it was not worth the wait. The chicken wings we ordered came out cold and although they were big, they didn't stand out in taste. ?This was one of our worst meals during our trip to New York.

okay, so first off let me say I am Syracuse where this restaurant began, when it was just a mere van grilling italian sausage sandwiches. ?So I am kind of partial to my home base. This location is good though, the mac and cheese is amazing, the pulled pork, ribs and wings will blow your mind but my one complaint is the 'syracuse style' salt potatoes. Clearly the cooks at this place do not know what they are doing. ?For all you non CNYers out there They are tiny little baby potatoes that are boiled in a salt brine and drawn butter is poured on top of them. Well i don't know who taught these Harlem kids but my 'salt potatoes' had some sort or weird fake margarine-like syrup substance pour all over them, NO SALT (HELLLLOOOO???) and some sort of garlic flavor added to them. ?WTF? I guess that's a lesson to me, ordering outside of the actual city of Syracuse. ?but overall, it's a fun place. The atmosphere is cool and the food is good. You should stop by. Oh, and the desserts are really good!

For those that can't wait to go to Texas or the carolina's for some BBQ, Dinosaur does the job. ?Very friendly service really enhances a solid plate of BBQ. ?I wish the ribs and brisket has a bit more smoke. ?That would give it that extra star. ?They did give the meat a nice crust on the outside with moist meat on the inside. ?Honestly, I have yet to find a better plate of BBQ in Manhattan. ?Sorry Daisy Mae's fans, this place is better. ?The best way to go is to order a combo platter to share. ?For two people, you get a variety of meats and a couple of sides. ?It is really a good sample of flavors and will make you full without feeling like you need a trip to the cardiologists afterwards. ?It is a trek uptown, but worth the subway ride on a Sunday afternoon.

Maybe a 4.5 DEFINITELY make a reservation, i'm surprised they even take them but we sat in 5 minutes and other ppl without reservations were quoted a 90 minute wait. This is a great place for groups. Portions are much bigger than i expected. Started with fried green tomatoes which were interesting but not amazing. Garlic chipotle wings were sooo so good, one of the standouts of the night. For main course, we shared the family platter ($60) between 5 people and had enough left over for at least 2 more people. Chicken was good, not overly memorable. Brisket was a little fatty but good, same with the ribs. Both were definitely good and cooked well but could have used a little more sauce. They provide a few bbq sauces on each table but its better to cook the meat in these sauces. Sides were delicous, better than the main dishes i think. Beer prices are great, good options and they have cheap buckets of cans and pitchers. I loved the atmosphere, price, and side dishes a little more than the actual bbq/meat but would definitely come back here again soon.

Atmosphere's great for a casual, social dinner; service was excellent, but the wings and ribs were just so-so. Nothing special about 'em, not even their signature sauce. The beans tasted funny. I prefer the pork and beans in a can over whatever the hell that was. But the mac n cheese and cornbread were decent.

I love the dinosaur! I just left there so I am feeling inspired. I had a few wings, wango tango of course, and the shrimp spiendini which was great. Collard greens and the salt potatoes were a great compliment. Sit in the bar area, no wait and tables big enough for groups. We had 8 people and our server was great. Rawr!

This place doesn't need another review. Being that it is my favorite place to pig out and be greedy, I felt compelled to to leave one. Hands down the best place to eat barbecue in New York. The macaroni is also the best restaurant bought macaroni I've tasted city wide. The atmosphere can be crowded and crazy which is one of the negatives about this place. seating isn't to comfortable either, wood chairs and tables the rock. I hate coming here during peak hours, food smells SO good but the wait can be SO long. Put your name on a waiting list and suffer the torture of good smelling food. Drinks at the bar is good but nothing special, selections are adequate. The wings are divine and addictive! I do prefer my wings cooked a little more crispier but I cant deny the taste, they are that good!

The hostess was great, and we were seated for our reservation. ?The waiter was attentive, and the bus staff were adequate. ?The food was pretty disappointing. ?My friend & I shared the app sampler & a meat sampler so we tasted a lot. ?The baked beans were awesome. ?The rest, not so much. ?The ribs were tough, the brisket was moist enough, and the pulled pork was very dry. ?The mac n cheese was dry also. ?Cole slaw was pretty good. ?I would not return. ?Good bbq does exist on this island, just not at Dinosaur.

Im not a barbeque expert, I never claimed to be, but I know what I like. ?And I like me some Dinosaur Barbeque. ?The best wings Ive had in NYC (haven't tried Virgil's but Ive heard it's good) and a really unique setting. ?Not a sports bar, I think theres only one tv, but a place to sit down and enjoy a really good barbeque meal. ?The beef brisket and ribs I'd rate above average, but the wings are cooked perfect. ?The meat just falls off the bone. ?And what a great serving of mac'n'cheese, an extra layer of cheese melted right on top. ?Okay so Im not adding anything anyone else hasnt already said. ?Im just here to give it my 5 stars and say best mac and cheese and wings in the city Ive had.

was i ordering from a different menu from the 100+ yelpers that gave this place rave reviews? ?because i was not impressed. before i get to the food, the greatest tip i can give is to make a reservation. ?make a reservation. ?MAKE A RESERVATION. ?because you will wait for your table. ?oh yes, be prepared to wait a loooong time. ?even WITH a reservation. ?and like most restaurants, they will not seat your party till everyone is there. ?i had dinner with my friends, there were 8 of us, and we all arrived in clumps. ?and the time from when the first clump of us got there to when we sat down was about 3 hours. ?hint though: if you don't want to wait forever for a table, snatch the bar tables near the bar area. ?those are first come, first serve. ?you have to hover over that area like a hawk though cuz the tables go like. that. but enough about the waiting. ?the food was.... okay. ?not great, not bad, just okay. ?the problem was i read a lot of the reviews on yelp and expected some of the best bbq this side of the country. ?i was severely disappointed. just off the top of my head: deviled eggs were awesome. the fried green tomatoes, which i expected to be a hidden treasure, were eh. ?it was almost like the tomatoes were frozen solid and deep fried in batter right before they hit my plate. pulled pork was moist but lacked flavor. ?had to douse it with dinosaur bbq's wango tango sauce (A+ on the sauce) brisket... a little dry. the ribs. ?majority of the people at my table had ribs, and the verdict was unanimous. ?disappointment. ?where are these super moist, fall-off- the-bone ribs everyone is talking about? ?they weren't at our table. ?the ribs weren't dry, but they weren't super moist either. ?and in general, i thought all of the meat i tried was pretty bland. ?i think good bbq is like a good steak: you shouldn't have to douse it with steak/bbq sauce when you eat it for it to taste good. ?its original flavor should stand on its own. mac & cheese: ahhhh why did i have to read all these yelp reviews that said this was supposed to be crazy amazing. ?again, it wasn't bad, and though it was good, i thought it was similar to the mac & cheese i've tried at tons of other random restaurants i've been to. carrot & raisin salad: i was expecting sweet, sliced carrots. ?it was like eating cole slaw but instead of cabbage, it was carrots. ?no mayo base, some kind of sweet sauce w/ raisins. corn bread: edible... a little grainy but okay ice box cake: first time i've ever tried it. ?pretty much chocolate pudding on oreo crust. ?i think it would have tasted better if it was chilled more. key lime pie: i love key lime pie, but dino bbq's version of it had no tart taste to it. so it's a given that i wouldn't come back here. ?true, portion sizes are good and prices are very reasonable especially for new york. ?but this isn't the kind of bbq i would write home about. ?and definitely not worth the trek all the way up to 131st street. ?maybe they had an off day... who knows? ?but in the future, i'd rather look around manhattan for other bbq places. ?but if you're in the area, check it out and see for yourself. ?you might have a better experience.

Really good BBQ, and i'm happy that it is right around the corner from me. We've never been disappointed with the food, and the prices are very good compared to the overpriced restaurants out here in NY. I recommend ordering the BBQ Fried Rice for sure, and personally, since I am a wing guy, I recommend ordering the BBQ wings, and get them spicy. Overall, their BBQ is delicious, and their service is always great. This is a spot we will always visit at least once a month!

Definitely NOT the best BBQ in NYC, and it definitely is overrated, though probably a notch above Dallas BBQ. For the millions of people that were here on a Thursday night, I was expecting a little better. I had the pulled pork which was okay, though lacking in a little flavor, their sauces are okay, as is their sides, even if they were cold. Service was below average. Nothing out of this world and certainly not worth the 45 minute wait.

I went to this place with my brother and his friends this place was really good especially since I'm still use to that asian diet where its mainly not that much flavoring as bbq. For once there is actually a place to satisfy my giant 300lb brother. I suggest going to the gym like we did if you go to this place because the food is really filling. Also I ?suggest that if you get the peanut butter pie split it with somebody because its good.....but it gets really nasty when you're just stuffing peanut butter down your throat when its just too much for you.

I highly recommend this place if you love BBQ ribs. The sauce was not too over powering. The ingredients ?were well balanced with bold flavors. The ribs were tender and juicy, in which I think is hard to find in a good BBQ place. ? We also had the slider pulled pork sandwich and it was the best I've had. ?They put a thick slice of tarty pickle in the sandwich which went perfectly well with the sandwich. ?Their side were also yummy. We had baked beans, mac and cheese & cole slaw. ? The dessert was also amazing! ?We had key lime pie and peanut butter pie. The only disappointment was the corn bread and chicken wings. ?I love corn bread and theirs were hard, greasy and a little tasteless. ? I like my chicken wings with a vinegar base sauce that's light, the chicken skin is slightly crispy and tender meat. ?Dinosaurs' wings had a much bolder sauce then I would prefer and the skin was not crispy and the wings were not tender. In summery, they make an amazing rack of ribs, pulled pork sliders and can't pass up desserts. ?Chicken wings were okay form me and I hope they improve their cornbread.

Having been born and raised in Upstate New York, and fondly remembering the deliciousness of the Dinosaur BBQ in Syracuse, I had really been wanting to try this place out for a long time. ?I was super excited to finally get a group together to hike up to this place and see if it could measure up. ?In a nutshell, the food was great. ?However, the service here was a huge disappointment. ?Maybe I've been spoiled by the politeness of Upstate New York. I made reservations for 11 of us on a Monday night at 8:00. ?I figured it would be a good time to go, since it was, after all, a Monday, and it was a little past dinner hours. ?We didn't sit until around 8:30, which I was willing to let slide. ?After we sat down, we didn't get water or have our drink orders taken for another 20 minutes. ?At this point, our annoyance was beginning to set in. ?The restaurant at this time was full, but by no means swamped. ?There were empty tables scattered around, and it seemed that they had enough staff to be paying attention to us. ?Other tables that sat down after us consistently got served before us by other waiters. ?By the time our waiter finally got around to taking our drink orders (after us prompting him), we ordered our food as well, not wanting to have to wait an additional 20 minutes for that. ? At around 9:15, our waters and pitchers of beer were finally delivered to the table (remember, our reservation was for 8:00). ?I'm surprised one of us didn't die from dehydration. ?Surprisingly, the food came quite fast, probably around 9:30, although it was very mixed up. ?Three or four people in our party were served the wrong item, plates had to be taken back to have the sides switched, etc. ?At this point, we almost expected this. The food, not surprisingly, was delicious. ?I ordered a 1/2 rack with a side of slaw and salt potatoes. ?The rib meat, as expected, fell right off the bone, and the salt potatoes were marinated in an exquisite butter-cream sauce that made them melt in your mouth. ?The cole slaw, as always, was delicious as well. ?Everyone at the table that had been to the Syracuse Dinosaur agreed that it was almost as good, if not right on par with the food from the upstate establishment. However, the one thing that did leave a bad taste in our mouth was the service. ?After the food was brought out, our waiter virtually ignored us. ?I asked for a refill of water pitchers that never came. ?My friend had an order of fries that were supposed to come with dinner. ?These came while we were finished and waiting for the check. ?After waiting for another 20 minutes, and after asking other waiters several times, we finally got our checks. ?At the beginning of the meal, our waiter told us that he was unable to split the checks up individually, which should never have been a problem in the first place, as the restaurant is as technologically advanced as most others. ?The checks were split three ways, with gratuity included on all of them, even though each check's party was 4 people or less (the minimum for included gratuity was 6 people on a check). ?All in all, I would say we had waited a total of 50-60 minutes extra because of being ignored and having extremely slow service. ?We took our checks to the front because we decided we didn't want to wait for our waiter to come back several minutes later to cash us out. The service here was piss poor. ?The waiter didn't deserve a tip in my opinion, and if gratuity wasn't included, I probably wouldn't have tipped at all (which is something I normally find extremely rude). ?I would've given this review 3 stars simply because of how delicious the food was. ?But, unbelievably, not one, but two of my friends got charged twice on their cards for their meals, and now have to go through the fiasco of calling their banks and having the erroneous charges refunded. If you have the passion for this awesome food though, rent a car, take a bus, or hitchhike to the Syracuse Dinosaur BBQ. ?You will get treated with respect, you will have great, speedy service, you won't be ignored, and most of all, you will have the most delicious ribs you could ever imagine eating. ?But as for this location, don't bother.

I was told it would be a 45min wait, but was sat right away. Staff was nice and they have a solid beer selection (Dale's Pale Ale is a local's favorite in Denver).

Great food. Enough said. Must try the devil's wings. Hot but tasty, but get the sauce on the side and just try it on one wing. ?The wings themselves have an outstanding taste and the "Devil's Duel" sauce just takes away from that. The brisket was awesome and I loved the ribs. Enjoyed the pulled pork. Now I am sure you are wondering how I ate this all in one sitting. Two words: family style. This plate gives you a little (and by a little I mean a lot) of everything. Also, try the pork sket sandwich as well. ?This thing is just a plate of brisket and pulled pork goodness coupled with some cheese and jalapenos topped with coleslaw ... I love dinosaurs!

Dinosaur's gets 5 stars all the way. My friends and I love this place. HUGE portions, awesome prices, awesome atmosphere, awesome service. Only advice? Make reservations. No trust me, this is not a "hey let's go to dinosaur's for dinner!" at the last minute, when you're starving kind of place. This is a "let's go to dinosaur's 2 weeks from now, and I'll make a reservation for us now, and we gotta get there half an hour before our reservation that night, and eat before we go" kind of place. I've never been here and not had to wait 2 hrs (at least) for a table, and then wait another 30 min. for your food to arrive after you order. But you know what? The food is so good, you wait those 2 hrs, watching other ppl eat and wanting to jump them for their last piece of rib. Unless you make reservations, in which case you only wait half an hour, and get treated like royalty by not only the wait staff, hostesses and manager! This amazing, shining example of what a manager should look like, continued to come over to us and apologize for the wait since we made reservations, and even brought us complimentary appetizers WHILE WE WAITED! even though it was a saturday night and the restaurant was packed. This dude was even waiting tables himself. You can't get any better than this people. So make reservations, and go to Dinosaur's! Drink beer, eat fried green tomatoes, get a full rack of ribs, and a side of Syracuse salt potatoes, end the night with a cheesecake, another beer, and some live music, and you will leave happy!

Best things I've had so far (both entrees, apps and sides) - Ultimate BLT sandwich: Thick hickory bacon, fried green tomatoes, and fresh Bibb lettuce on a soft semolina roll. Really delicious. - Brisket: very tender & delicious, perfectly matched by their sauce - unfortunately it sometimes comes out luke warm - Mac and Cheese: with smoked paprika. If you get a fresh batch its really amazing, otherwise its just OK. - Cole slaw: just perfect. - Potato salad: also great. - Deviled Eggs: very nice. - Ribs: solid. Not the best I've ever had, but very good. The biggest downside to this place is the wait, so go for lunch instead of dinner, or come for an early dinner. Delivery can take hours, and you have to go out on to the street and pull out your wallet in public since they no longer come upstairs or even into the building. One warning, I recommend never going late on a Saturday night, or you will hear the horrible screeching of hammered yuppies singing terrible karaoke. Also- the people who work here seem happy and are almost always really sweet. A real plus in a neighborhood dominated by establishments with ?very little regard for service.

If you're on the upper west side, there's really no better place for barbecue. ?It's a bit out of the way (waaaay on the west side at 131st street), but definitely worth the trek (make sure you go with a group--safety first!). I've been here quite often, as it's a favorite of several of my friends, and haven't encountered a dish that is anything less that excellent. ?Their pulled pork is amazing, and great on a sandwich or as part of a platter. ?I'm also a fan of the beef brisket and ribs. ?The sides are delicious, for the most part. ?I highly recommend the macaroni and cheese and the greens. ?Heck, everything on the menu is amazing.

Now this is a BBQ joint. ?The decor is urban biker bar (with the graffiti on the walls and everything) ?however you don't come here for decor. ?The food here is great, rib meat falls off the bone, the sides are great ?my favorites are the fried green tomato's and the chiken steak with some mac and cheese and the bbq fried rice. ?The wait staff is laid back but they know that menu front and back. ?It is always crowded so either be prepaired to wait for awhile or you have to to the table dance at the bar. ?However after you suck down a dinosaur demise or two you won't even mind waiting!

Sweet mother of all goodness, i highly highly enjoyed this place. the pulled pork, baby back ribs, chicken, brisket, sides, cornbread, and fried green tomatoes were a party in my mouth and tummy. it didn't hurt that our waiter looked like a hotter version of freddie prinze jr either (ok ok i gave this place an extra star just for him, haha).

I've been here many times and each time tohe food and service gets worse. I have never been a huge fan of the ribs (Daisy May's is much better), but the chicken wings were amazing. ?They have not been nearly as good as in the past. ?I was there last week and the wings, which normally are giant in size were the size of small, bar style buffalo wings...... ?but they still charged over $1.00 per wing. ? When asked, the waitress said something like- ?we got a batch of these in and wanted to use them." wow. I'm not sure what is going on but I want the old Dinosaur BBQ back!

I went there for the first time after hearing so much hype about this place. ?I'm from the south where bbq is like bagels down there. ?This place is mediocre at best. ?Pulled pork was bland and their hot sauce was hot but lacked flavor. ?Collard greens- way too much sugar and vinegar. ?I heard their wings are good...Lots of people so it made the place fun. Bartenders were attentive- skip the food if you don't want to be disappointed.

This is a place that I frequent with a group of friends... not sure if it's the best bbq in town but the atmosphere is fun for a weekend night, service is friendly and the place is good for groups. You'll probably have to wait for a table so it's better to call ahead and get a reservation. Portions are huge, but I think the sandwiches might be a more reasonable size. The sides and appetizers I've tried are all really good- go for the fried green tomatoes appetizer, and coleslaw, salt potatoes, or fries as sides. Cornbread is also delish and comes with your meal. I've had better brisket elsewhere, but i do like the ribs and bbq pork.

The food is pretty good, the ribs were a little undercooked in my opinion (not falling off the bone and not smoked enough) but everything was good, the brisket and brisket slider, as well the the pulled pork were great - the place can use a little training for the waiters and busboys - but hey, it's a BBQ joint....though I must say everyone were real friendly. A little expensive for what it it, but hey, my kid loved it...we had a good time, and that's why I bumped it up to 4 stars from 3. It was good not great. Will go there again, with my kids.

Went here a few weeks ago for the 1st time with my boy friend. Didn't think the wait would be a45min but we were in the mood for some good BBQ food. Waiter told us the seats outside were on a first come first served. We decided if a table opened up first before our name was called we wld sit outside it was a nice day neway. After 40 mins we sit outside nd 10 mins later our table was called.. We ordered jumbo wings to start and our food took a long time to get there nd by that time it was night nd getting chilly by the water.. Food was absolutely delicious and the mac nd cheese was the best I've had in a while!! I'll definetly go back again but I'll wait to be seated inside.

Very cool looking honky tonk style place located underneath the Henry Hudson Parkway on 131st St. You can eat outside (in front of the restaurant) or in (lots of tables as well as a bar). We went on a Wednesday afternoon for lunch and didn't have to wait, but apparently there's long waits for dinner! My wife and I enjoyed the food very much, but the only reason I didn't give it 5 stars was because we had such a hard time finding parking. There's a huge parking lot across the street, but you can't park there because it belongs to a supermarket and they have a guard. Not sure why they couldn't work a deal with the market to allow their customers to use the lot for free (Dino pays them) or a small fee (customer pays). The supermarket allows their customers to park for free. I would think they'd love to make some money from Dinosaur's customers. Perplexing. ? ? ? Anyway, Dinosaur was excellent. From the sweet tea ($2.50) with free re-fills to the pulled pork sandwiches ($9.95) that came with 2 sides. I had the beans and mac & cheese. It was the first BBQ place whose mac & cheese wasn't complete mush! The elbow noodles were nice and al dente and the sauce was cheesy delicious! It was so good I could have had a huge bowl of just that for dinner! My wife had the potato salad (so-so) and the coleslaw (good but not the slightly sweet kind I'm used to). The pulled pork sandwiches on a sesame roll were delicious and had ample amounts of meat with just a bit of sauce on it. No worries. For those of you who like extra, it's on the table. We also tried the salmon bites for an appetizer ($5.95). They were also excellent with a good dipping sauce. Next time I plan on trying the pork ribs. They also had a skirt steak sandwich marinated in Dr. Pepper (now that's interesting!) that looked very good as it passed by our table. Had a very extensive beer menu as well. All in all Dinosaur was a good experience. Just wish they could figure out the parking situation for non-locals. Good luck if you bring your car!

If you are particular about your BBQ then it is a 2 star. ?If you are happy with tender ribs and a watery BBQ sauce then it is 4 stars. ?I ordered the Tres Hombres, which was the ribs, pulled pork, and brisket. ? 1. the ribs are all St. Louis, so if you want baby back, go somewhere else. ?They were perfect tenderness, no smoke flavor or rub. ?only the burnt sauce. 2. the brisket was too marbled and fatty. ?i had a hard time finding a good bite without too much fat with the meat. ?Once again, no rub flavor. 3. the pork was top notch. ?Some of the best i have had. ?if i went back, i would get the pulled sandwich with the slaw and beans for sides. The beer selection was good and it wasn't too crowded until about 730pm when i left, then there was a line on a monday. ?Overall a good experience. ?good service. ?good background music. ?Mediocre BBQ. ? If you want Real BBQ in NYC, then go to Fette Sau in brooklyn. ?you wont be dissappointed.

Brilliant ribs, great brisket. Potato salad and carrot & raisin salad are choice sides. The cornbread is the best I've had at a BBQ place too. They brew their own beer and mix a swee-eet margarita. Even with a reservation, however, the wait was a good 30 minutes for a group of 6, which is a little bit annoying when you're paying a babysitter. Still, the best BBQ we've had and I really wouldnt look any further for any better.

Dinosaur BBQ is always crowded and you will get a filling meal no matter when you go. My boyfriend and I go there whenever we feel like a big protein fix. However, the food while generally great (I love the delicious ribs and the corn bread) there are times when the quality slips. Out of the multiple times I have been there, once or twice the BBQ is dry and some of sides taste like they have been cooking since the day before. With that said, I would still go back whenever I need my BBQ fix.

2.5 can't figure out the half... UGGGGGGGHHHHHH...i wanted to love this place. i had looked forward to it for days and walked a long time in the rain (going southeast instead of northwest on 125th...note one address is listed as 131 and broadway but this is the 'old' dinos) for my afternoon delight. I'll break it down into : food service beer menu impression FOOD: ?it wasn't what i expected. ?ribs were bland. they didn't fall off the bones and overall i think that's a preference issue. my tablemate met the chef (in thebathroom--) and the chef said ribs aren't supposed to fall off. Whether it was because i wasn't starving or i just wasn't in the moon (so unusual) i can only say they were ordinary. sort of bland. nothing that really said i had to have more. the fried green tomatoes excellent. mostly batter and a good dipping sauce. the chicken BBQ. pretty good. liked it better than the rib. Brisket...a little tough and covered again with a mystery sauce . the wings. gynormous...but covered in ?sauce of some sort. if you want your wings dry you should say so. ?the sauce is a bit overwhelming and too much. my table mate said wings were the best part of the meal. he got medium hot but said they weren't that hot. the weird thing is everything had a sort of sprinkling on it . like a paprika or something. even the mac and cheese which i found annoying. last...the wedge. ?I was so excited to see a side order of the wedge. ?I was sadly disappointed when it came flooded in russian dressing . . i always thought the wedge to be a blue cheese sort of meal. BEER: ?choices on tap good. the tap for red wagon went dry and it was about 20 minutes waiting for a beer resulting in a beer left almost untouched upon exciting. ?this could have been a combination of a slow waitress and a dry tap. ?i got a IPA dogfish 90 minute and this caused my tablemate to ask if it would take her 90 minutes to get me the beer. SERVICE. ?greated promptly. nice hostess waitress not so attentive but that's okay she was availlable but not really at our disposal. MENU: extensive. i think they do a good job with that. IMPRESSION: ?okay. would come again and give it another chance ?but would certainly not walk 1 mile in the wrong direction in the rain to come back. i think in short: ?OVERRATED.

Was taken here after admitting a mighty need for meat. And LOVED it. Went on a Saturday night...incredibly crowded. ?The friend I was out with decided to wait in the bar area for a table to open up...we probably stood around for a good 10-15 before two small parties left the same bench. ?Loud, dark, and full of amazing smells, if you don't like getting cozy with your table-neighbors then this may not be the place for you. ?Decent beer selection. ?Both of us got the pulled pork sandwich and two sides (I had the mac-and-cheese and the carrot salad). ?Pork was tender, but the BBQ sauces really made it. ?Mac-and-cheese had a nice spice to it, and the carrot/raisin salad had some great sweet and savory elements (think allspice). ?So busy that it wasn't easy to flag a server when you wanted them, but we weren't in a rush. ?Would love to come back and eat my way through more of the menu.

I came here for the first time tonight for dinner and quite frankly I was not impressed. After hearing all of the hype for this place and reading all of the amazing reviews I was really expecting something amazing. Maybe my expectations were too high but I truly was underwhelmed by pretty much everything here. I went with people who had been there before and were fans of this place. Based on their recommendation I ordered the 1/2 rack of ribs with mac and cheese and sweet potatoes. The ribs were ok, I thought the meat was ok not any real amazing taste to it but not awful. I love sweet potatoes but for some reason the sweet potatoes here were not so good, perhaps this was due to the fact that they were barely room temperature. The mac and cheese seemed like it came from a package. Maybe there's something wrong with me because the people I was with seem to really enjoy their meal. Overall, I was very disappointed.

Dinosaur BBQ: NYC outpost a BBQ joint started in Syracuse, New York. ?While not as good as its upstate parent, Dinosaur offers decent ribs, brisket and pulled pork, with their excellent sauces ranging from mild to very hot. ?And, the sides of mac and cheese, and fried green tomatoes are quite good. ?It's a fun place with music at night. ?Just keep your expectations grounded! ? As an aside, Dinosaur is at the start (or end) of the Hudson River Bike Trail at 125th Street on the Upper West Side, that goes down to Battery Park. ?For a great day, bring your bike (or rent one-- there are bike rental places along the Hudson), enjoy a fantastic, easy ride up and down the Hudson enjoying the sites and views, and have some BBQ along the way.

They make a fine BBQ -- better than RUB imho -- but certainly nowhere near the best I've had (disclaimer: I grew up in the south, so they're up against some pretty stiff competition). That said, the cavernous atmosphere is fun if you're looking for something lively. ?The beer selection is good. ?It's a solid choice for a night out with friends, but certainly not for an intimate date. ? Aside from being a bit noisy, the only real issue I had with dino was the wait for a table. ?I waited longer for a table there than anywhere else I have ever been in my entire life (over an hour and a half)... and I had a 'reservation.' ?I feel like they are able to get away with making people wait, because they're located under Henry Hudson expressway, pretty far from anything else. ?Perhaps I am old fashioned, but a simple apology isn't too much to expect, is it? In conclusion, I'll go again, but not during peak hours.

Dinosaur is just amazing BBQ. And I'm from the south. Yeah, there's often a wait, but it's always worth it. They now have table service outside as well. I have never felt unsafe in that neighborhood as the place itself and the Fairway across the street are always very busy. My favorite things to eat are the swag sampler which includes fried green tomatoes, boiled shrimp, BBQ chicken wings, and scrumptious deviled eggs. Then I like to follow it with some variety of pulled pork or brisket and wash it down with one of their many beers on tap. For sides, I 'd say definitely get the Syracuse salt potatoes and the mac and cheese. Bonus if you get cornbread as well. Everything there has just a little kick to it, and you can dump on some spicy sauce to jack it up a bit more if it suits you. I've eaten here probably 20 times, always busy and the food comes very quickly once you get a seat and the service is always top notch. I don't know too many places in Manhattan where you can stuff yourself silly for about $20 including a beer. The desserts are also fantastic but I'm usually on the verge of exploding and rarely indulge. My only complaint--they're closed on Monday so that's one less day I can enjoy their savory food.

I live a few blocks away from this place and have dined there, and while it was unspectacular we (GF and I) decided to give it a go for delivery as we were tired of the usual delivery fare (actually not very good in this area). First off, I've worked in a high-end NYC BBQ place and have had what I consider to be great, "real" barbeque in the south. ?I can say that this is not all that good, and considering the prices (which are not cheap given the smallish serving sizes) there are quite a few options in New York City that are much better choices (Virgil's, RUB, Hill Country to name a few). Let me get to the delivery experience...DON"T DO IT! ?It took 3 PHONE CALLS, being placed on hold for 4-5 minutes each , to even get someone to take the order. ?As I said, we live only a few blocks away, yet it took almost one hour (on a Wednesday evening) to get a pulled-pork platter with 3 sides and it arrived ICE COLD! ?(anyone who's worked in a restaurant can tell you that any BBQ place has plenty of pork on hand, it's one of the quickest things to get out of the kitchen). ? We were planning on sharing this, the "BIG ASS PORK PLATTER" ($14.95), yet the serving size was so meager as to not allow for it. ?With one extra side (it comes with 2), tax, and tip, we spent $24 on a meal that wasn't worth half of that. ? If you are looking for BBQ in the Harlem/Morningside Heights area, I'd suggest Rack 'n' Soul. ?For a comparable price you get enough to share and the quality is just as good (better if you consider how the food arrived after delivery). FYI, I've had the same dish while dining at Dinosaur BBQ, it is not supposed to be served ICE COLD. ? If you are looking for a typical southern-bar/frat party "scene" this is a good place, akin to Brother Jimmy's on the UWS. ?That's all it's really good for. ?Spend your money somewhere else.

As a grad of Syracuse, I love the Dino's in Syr. It took awhile but I finally went to the Dino's in NYC. The NYC location is no where near as good as the one upstate. In fact, it is really not that good in general. The wings are mushy, not crisp and the sauce not that spicy for my ordering spicy. The ribs were boring and a bit on the dry side. Mac and Cheese is awful. Service was nice and the location is not as bad as it seems. Bottom line, it was not an inspiring trip to the Upper Manhattan for BBQ. Virgil's is better so save the trip uptown.

The chicken wings are to die for! The ribs are also pretty damn awesome! The reason I give this place four stars and not five is because I waited super long to be seated and the service I received was decent. But other than that the food is great and reasonably priced. The only thing is that this place is in a very remote location I felt like I was going to get robbed when I went there. It can be a very dangerous area especially at night time with all the crackheads that are around. So if you go, bring a lil switchblade or something just in case.

We had a group of four on a Thursday night -- no wait. Service was a bit slow (dinner rush was just beginning) but the food was great. I had the fried green tomatoes (had never tried them -- tasted like fried zucchini but with a very tomatoey kick at the end), and the Tres Hombres platter. Pulled pork was fantastic, ribs were better than most places I've tried in the city, and brisket was good. One of our party got the "Big Ass Pork Plate" and said it was good, but didn't live up to its "big ass" name -- he's not a big dude but left feeling like he wanted more. Sides - the macaroni and cheese was great, cajun potato salad was *awesome*, and salt potatoes were interesting (in a good way). Anyway, definitely go and get the pulled pork or ribs.

The food is really two star. The drink selection deserves a star. Get the flight four drink sampler if you go. Really though, probably the worst BBQ ribs I've had. The meat was tough. The outside very burnt and dry. There wasn't much flavor.

Best BBQ in the city. ?The menu is like no other 'Cue restaurant in the city and if you can tell me where you can find better wings i'm all ears. ?The Fried Green Tomatoes are just mouth watering and the dipping sauces are some of the best in the world. ?The Sampler Platter is a steal and i'm still talking apps here. ?The Brisket is just to-die-for and the pulled pork is by far and away the best in the city. ?They have a great selection of sandwiches if you don't feel like Brisket, Pork or Ribs. ?I would suggest the catfish for anyone that wants to keep it light. ?The side dishes are amazing. ?The Mac is the best i've ever had and the fried rice is wonderful. ?Overall, I have to say that Dinosaur is a wonderful place to spend an evening or just go for lunch. ?I'm sad that I haven't been in a few months. ?The staff there is some of the most professional in NY!

Decided to try this place despite being quite far from my hotel in Manhattan but it was worth it. Had to wait an hour being it a saturday and during the lunch rush. But the food was great!

This place is delicious! I recommend the ribs and mac n cheese. The Macaroni and cheese has a little spicy kick that makes it great. The ribs are juicy and meaty. They also offer a variety of beers to drink and a few specialty drinks. But really, it's all about the food. The restaurant service is always a little slow. However, I'm always so stuffed I don't even mind.

The first time I went here, I thought I was transported into suburbia. ?I was actually just really surprised at how big this place was, but it was great. ?It's good to make a reservation via Open Table, that way you don't have to wait much and you get points. ?Now for the food: ?Brisket is good, but ribs are better. ?Best is the pulled pork (try the Big Ass Plate), which is simply divine. ?So tender and juicy, yum! ?As for the apps and sides: ?the sampler platter was a nice way to try a few of the ones I'd heard were really good (shrimp, fried green tomatoes, and deviled eggs). ?The Syracuse salt potatoes, the iceberg wedge, and fresh cut fries are my fave sides. ?Also good are the beans (though a bit soupy for my taste), potato salad, and collared greens. ?The cornbread was delish, though slightly on the dry side. ?I tried to order the banana pudding but they were all out. ?Instead, the oreo chocoloate pie (I think that's what it was) was a nice alternative, though extremely chocolatey.

I went to Dinosaur BBQ's Rochester location originally and enjoyed it so much I made a promise to return to their NYC location for my birthday in a few months. I did so with about 7 of my friends and was not at all disappointed. Their menu consists of a wide variety of BBQ options. I enjoy that fact that you can order precisely what you want without having to settle for a certain side simply because it comes with a certain dish. I was disappointed that they did not feature the "Cajun Corn" at the New York location, as they did in Rochester. ?Our waitress was extremely helpful especially when we requested that the bill be cut 4 ways to make paying a bit easier for the larger party. She was very patient and made the meal that much more enjoyable. When you come to Dino, bring your appetite and leave your belt at home. Their portions are not for the faint of heart. They also feature a great selection of Beer and tequila as well. (Being one of my personal favorite touches) Bottom line , if you don't care about looking dainty while eating out and want to enjoy good old fashioned BBQ this is the place for you.

In my on-going search for good Harlem BBQ, Dinosaur is pretty much as good as it gets. Piles of delicious, stick-to-your-ribs food, cold beers, and a fun down-home Southern atmosphere make this place a winner. It's popularity despite it's middle-of-nowhere location is a testament to just how tasty and fun Dinosaur is. I got a combination platter with ribs and brisket and a side of macaroni and cheese and I think sweet potatoes. I loved it. The meat was succulent and tender and the sauces were tangy and delicious. Mac and cheese was serviceable. The beer selection was a little unusual, and I loved whatever I ended up choosing, though I've since forgotten. The only thing that I absolutely didn't love was that the fried green tomatoes were only offered as an appetizer, not a side. Tricky tricky. I reluctantly ponied up the extra cash for a couple. It was a LOT of food, so I probably didn't need the extra tomatoes, but they're so uncommonly served at restaurants that I just couldn't help myself. Plus, the extra food meant that I had a sizeable doggie bag for lunch the next day. Double the Dinosaur delights!

Went here for lunch today. Several reviews said parking could be an issue but it was early (12 noon) and I found a parking spot one block away - so parking wasn't an issue. Large restaurant wit a good BBQ atmosphere. The hostess was very nice and seated me immediately. The waiter was also nice and attentive. Good choice of beer on tap. I had the Empire IPA which was nice and cold. I ordered the pulled pork/brisket platter for $16.95. My sides were baked beans and french fries. I wanted the coleslaw but I don't like too much mayo in my slaw and the waiter suggested I don't get the coleslaw if I didn't like too much mayo. The brisket was fatty and didn't have too much taste. The metal utensils are pretty flimsy and I bent my fork trying to cut the fat off of my brisket. No complaints with the pulled pork - it was pretty tasty. The cornbread was pretty small and nothing special. The baked beans were soupy and the "baked bean" compartment on my plate was pretty small so I wasn't going to get too many to begin with. The french fries were hot and crispy - no complaints there. In conclusion....good atmosphere, good service, good beer list, just average BBQ.

Good thing this place is far away from me! ? If I were in the hood, I would be coming ?here every day to eat. ?I would be so fat they would have to roll me off the entrance/exit ramp. ?It took me four trains to get up here and it was well worth it. ?Nestled in an area close to the highway, the surrounding streets are being developed. ?Cranes and other machinery line one of the streets while the dust and dirt flying around and really oppressive heat ?made me feel like I was in an open range in Texas. ?Yee-ha! ?I was ready to enter the saloon to get my meal. ?I came at the start of lunch hour and the waiter let me choose any seat I wanted. ?I chose a table big enough for four as I wanted to stretch out and really enjoy myself. ?I had the sweet tea and the 1/2 rib pit plate. ?It comes with two sides and honey hush cornbread. ?I had the mac'n cheese and the roasted ?whipped sweet potatoes with spicy nut topping. ?When the waiter brought my plate out, I said "oh hurt me" then OMG. ?My eyes were soaking up the lovely sight in front of me. ?My mouth formed an "O." ?The plate was smokin' hot. ?The smoke was still billowing in the air, when I whipped out my camera and took some photos. ?Then I proceeded to fold a paper napkin bib and then chow down. ?The ribs are delectable. ?They are succulent with finger linkin' good flavor. ?You don't need to put any sauce on it, but if you're like me you like the BBQ sauce too. ?I didn't slather too much on, there was no need to cover up such a delicous fall off the bone ribs. ?I then turned my attention ot the sides. ?I could taste the peppers in the mac'n cheese. ?I could also taste the spices in the sweet potatoes and I could see the fibers of the potatoes. Not something you get in a can. ?I had to have a full experience so eating up my whole platter would mean no room for dessert. ? I packed up the rest of my ribs and ordered dessert. ?I had the banana pudding with whipped cream and homemade vanilla cookie. ?It came with toasted coconut shreds and banana slices in the pudding. ?Mmmm. Nice way to end the meal. ? ?They don't serve their food on fine glass plates, so don't expect any. ?Just go and experience the kick-ass ribs. ?There is also a giant Fairway market 2 blocks away. ?The waiter was nice enough to tell me when I asked him about it.

Located at the end of 125th St, Dinosaur seems to have maintained its popularity despite being all the way out at the edge of the water. I understood this to be a good omen for the meal to come, and luckily for me, it was. I don't consider myself too experienced with barbecue, but I can compare Dinosaur to Hill Country, the only other barbecue place that I've been to in NY. I ordered a brisket plate - the brisket itself was slightly dry compared to HC, but the sauce compensated by adding moisture and a little sour tang. The mac and cheese was awesome; it wasn't just some fake cafeteria cheese, but even my unrefined palate could actually taste multiple types of cheese. One point to Dinosaur. The corn bread was springy and not too dry (a tie), and the wings were moist, but SUPER spicy. As in, 10 minutes later my tongue and mouth are still stinging from the capsaicin. Wunderbar! Dinosaur can definitely hold its own against Hill Country - a great place for a barbecue dinner by the water.

This place is REALLY good. ?And while there is a full menu, this place is simply about meat -- smoked, tender, flavorful meat. ? ?We had wings as an appetizer and then ribs and pulled pork for our meal. ?Rumor has it that our meal came with two side dishes but they really felt like ornamental afterthoughts to the plate of meat we were staring at. ?Those ribs will change your life. ?They were juicy and felt off the bone in large chunks. ?Shivers. ?But really I must say that I was even more impressed with the pulled pork. ?Dinosaur understands and delivers on the subtle nuance that pulled pork by definition is "pulled" and not "shredded". ?That allows for a combination of flavors and textures never described as mushy. ?The service was friendly and fast enough. ?The ambiance was nice but kind of bordering on the thematic...in the sense that appears designed to be replicated. ?Good for them - it's well done. ?I'll be back for sure.

My favorite BBQ spot by far!!! The deviled eggs is seasoned to perfection! Chili on the half shell with a Generous portion of melted cheese on top is served with tortilla chips can be a meal in itself. there are sooo many great things on the menu That i just can't pass up. The fried green tomatoes is served with their creamy buttermilk ranch...delicious!!! ?My all time staple for the main course is the half bbq chicken with Mac & cheese & potato salad.

I live around the corner and eat here as much as I can. Fried green tomatoes and wango tango wings get the party started, then it's time to tie that napkin around the neck. For lunch the Cuban, bbq reuben or smothered Churrasco chicken sandwiches are all finger-lickin' good. Otherwise I highly recommend the Big House Special (chicken n' ribs) or, if you got your chicken fix w/the wings (which I usually do), the "Ode to Elgin" sampler: a 1/4 rack of ribs, brisket and succulent sausage links. You may need more ribs, but the selection will satisfy most of your meatly cravings for at least a few days. Mmmm-mmm.

Went to thi place on a Saturday at 11 PM. I wanted to just grab some appetizers and drinks. The host told me the wait was an hour and a half so I said could we go to the bar. She said it's first come,first served. Mind you the music is blaring i could barely here her. So we went to the bar are and sat at a table. We sat there for about 10 minutes then a waitress comes over and says you can only sit there if a host seats you. Mind you the table is clearly in view of the host who never came to say anything when she saw us sit. The table was in the bar able and didn't have a reserved sign or anything to indicate that we could not sit there. My husband and I walked out because obviously they just didn't want our business. I just feel the restaurant should not have tables in the bar area that we can't sit at freely. And if they don't want you to sit there---put a sign! Clearly this restaurant is below par on customer service. Mind you the restaurant was not even full.

What can I say about this place that hasn't already been said -- well nothing really it's all already here but here is my take on Dinosaur BBQ. Personally I prefer this location vs the newer one in Newark by Prudential Center but that's just preference. The food is very very good. Everything was prepared very well. I have had the ribs and they are delicious, the brisket is always moist and tender, the pulled pork has always been cooked perfectly (yet could use a little more BBQ sauce, my own preference), the mac & cheese is so good, beans are also very good with an ever so slight kick to them, the cornbread is very good and not too sweet and the sweet tea is much more toned down that many places where there is so much sugar your teeth hurt after -- perfect balance between sweetened and unsweetened. The only downfall to this place is serving sizes compared to other BBQ places at this price point is smaller then what you are probably used to when typically dining on this type or fare but I'll take quality over quantity 9/10 times.

This place is awesome. ?Great atmosphere. ?U feel like you're not in NYC. ?It's a cool place at night when you see bikers park in front of the joint. ?Their bbq ribs are tender and smoked. ?I love the spicy wings appetizers and their own hot sauces are to die for. ?You can even buy their hot sauce to take home. ?The food has such great flavor and the sides ain't bad either. ?I had the 3 combo platter of ribs, chicken and brisket, i know how glutunous but I wanted to try it all. The menu prices are a pretty good bargain. I heard it was one of the best bbq places in the US. ?How great is that! ?I strongly suggest making reservations b/c this place gets so packed and u dont want to wait 2 hrs. ?The waiting staff and hostess are sooo friendly. ?They were very accomodating to me and my 25 colleages when we came there to eat. ?I definitely say try it at least once. ?You won't be disappointed. ?If you're taking the subway, just walk down 125th st twds the river and it's right there. ?I never had problems finding parking if you have patience.

My friend threw someone a surprise bday party here. However, although we reserved a space for 5:30 they didn't seat us until closer to 7pm. The surprise had to be stalled and some folks had to leave...just terrible. However once we were seated the food was decent. I've had better ribs but I have to say my fav part of the meal was the BBQ salmon. Totally awesome. If I ever decide to go back again I will order that with the BBQ rice. Otherwise I can leave it!

Did I miss something? Because all the other yelpers seem to love this place. ?I, on the other hand, was left unimpressed. I had a party of 3 and we arrived a little after 7pm and were told the wait was 45 minutes. I had a frozen margarita while we waited and it was pretty "good." By "good" I mean sweet (the way I like it) and seemingly nonalcoholic. I say this because I hadn't eaten before coming, my tolerance is low, and I didn't feel the slightest buzz.. Our wait ended up being 15-20 mins-kudos to them for exceeding expectations. Maybe it's the long wait that has everyone else ravenous by the time they're eating, leaving them with the false impression that the food is 4-5 star worthy. I came with an appetite and was excited when I previewed the menu. I picked at the chopped salad I ordered as an appetizer, though enough for 2 it was lackluster: a bag of grocery store mixed greens with some candied walnuts strewn on top...nothing to write home or really on here about. My friend had the chili , again enough for 2, which comes with a plate of nachos. The chili was decent but again nothing to write home or here about. Honestly, I think I would have been equally satisfied (perhaps more) with a can of Busch's chili. My other friend had the Mango Wango (?) wings, the charring was spot on but the sauce tasted as though it sat atop the wings instead of deeply marinated within them. For an entree I had the Original Brisket Sandwich which was described as "covered in sweet onions." Hungry as I was I envisioned a sandwich smothered in rings of juicy BBQ laden, sauteed onions, instead I received a sandwich ( the bun size being slightly wider that the circumference of your standard picnic hamburger bun) with a stingy dash/pinch of chopped onions. You know the saying that "we eat with our eyes," so true and my eyes and appetite were not interested in the least. My plate just looked unappetizing. ?Of course I was hungry so I ate out of necessity (I mean in these economic times you can't afford to waste food). My sandwich bun was very soft and the meat tender but flavorless (they didn't deliver on their promise of the spices from the 14 hour marinate!). As far as presentation goes, I know this is a BBQ "joint" but the plating was reminiscent of a school cafeteria and somehow that was a turnoff. My friend had the catfish and it didn't leave an impression and my other friend the ribs which were "alright." My last criticism? the crowd. I didn't feel as though I was in NYC, which sometimes can be a very good thing but not here. I don't know who these people were or where they came from but they seemed odd and out of place....I can't put my finger on it. My friend said he felt as though were were in a "subterranean city"...and ,contrary to what this review may have you believe, we are not a particularly picky bunch. I fell for the hype and ,as is often the case, was left unsatisfied and disappointed : (

I came here with a fairly large group or 10. I had called early in the week to make reservations for a sat night, however the person told me it was a 2 week minimum advance notice for a weekend???? Luckily, i knew someone who knew someone and I was able to be accomodated. SO just a heads up for you, if you are looking for reservations for the weekend. Anyway on to the food. I ordered a full rack of ribs. WOW....GINORMOUS! they dont' call it dinosaur for nuttin! While I thought the ribs were tender and the fat on the ribs were oh so fatty. I thought it could have used some extra kick. I'm used to ribs where extra bbq sauce is just not neccessary. So i found myself dousing ribs with the bbq sauce provided on the table. I enjoyed the sides(mac&cheese/beans) as well as the apps that consisted of chilli with nachos and wings. The wings were good...Although we ordered both medium and fiery wings. The fiery wings had no effect at all? Perhaps, they made a mistake. But oh well. Overall, I'd say one of the better places to enjoy a bbq meal for manhattan. Huge beer selection. Great for groups. Service was quick, friendly and attentive. I would def come back to try other items on the menu.

I finally got to experience Dinosaur BBQ last night and must confess, it wasn't as DINO-MITE as I would have hoped. ?We got there for an early dinner around 6 and didn't have to wait for a table. ?The decor is charming and touristy at the same time -- it reminded me of the Midwest (Ponderosa? ?Cracker Barrel?) not of a place under a bridge, by the river, ?in Harlem. ?Since I was with my sweetheart, we ordered the Sweetheart Deal for Two -- full slab of ribs and 4 sides of our choice. ?We also ordered fried green tomatoes as a starter. ?The fried green tomatoes (3 minis for $6??? I digress...) were very tasty, nicely battered and served with a peppercorn ranch. ?However, I couldn't tell if they were frozen or if they were fresh... I'm leaning toward frozen. ?Meh. ?The ribs arrived shortly after, while they were good, they weren't falling off the bone and pretty dry. ?They tasted good, but were far from outstanding. ?Sides on a 1-5 scale (5 being the best)... Simmered vegetarian greens (3 - too sweet, need PORK!), ?mac and cheese (4), sweet potato mash (3.5), cole slaw (3.5)... like everything else, the sides tasted good, but pretty forgettable. ?The sweet tea however was delicious... 5! ?I definitely will come back, but am looking forward to trying something else.

I have been meaning to try Dinosaur BBQ for quite awhile now, but not wanting to go on a weekend, or worrying about work the following morning it never seemed to be the right time. ?Last night being a full moon and the stars being perfectly aligned, Dinosaur BBQ received my patronage. ?The place was bigger than I expected, and nothing like the Dallas BBQ joints around the city. ?This was WAY BETTER!!! The wait was excruciating only because I had starved myself all day. ?In reality it was only an hour. Our server Jocie was great. We got the swagger sampler for 2, and the salmon cakes for appetizers, the salmon cakes were really good, the wings on the sampler were outrageously good, and the shrimp were good, I didn't try the deviled eggs but the fried green tomatoes were a first and were scrumdillyicious (thanks Zereena). ?For our entrees I ordered the brisket with salty potatoes and the mini wedge, and my company ordered the jerk salmon on a bed of sufferin succatash with mac and cheese and sweet mashed potatoes. ?All the food except for the wedge of lettuce was good. I won't order that again. ?It was a great night, with great food. ?The donkey punch was great but don't order the watermelon drink it was small and unflavored, maybe if a sweeter watermelon puree was used it could have competed with the flavor of everything else but it was disappointing to say the least. ?My company had the key lime pie but not being a fan of key lime I won't give my opinion , but to be fair my company didn't finish it either. Hey maybe it just wasn't our thing

AMAZING!! and completely worth the trek to the northwest side. Be prepared for a wait but the seating outside is first come first serve. We had a table within 25 minutes. Service was great. Food we even better. Ribs were great as was the pulled pork and mac and cheese.

I am a foodie with a slant toward the gourmet, while my husband is a "stick to the ribs" kind of guy. When his sister bought me this cookbook for Christmas a couple years ago, I wasn't particularly overjoyed. A cookbook from a local rib joint was the last thing I thought I wanted. It was with great reluctance (and an effort to please my husband!) that I made my first dish out of it, but that's all it took to make me a believer! I have since tried 12 recipes from this book and they have all been very good to excellent. Not only does it contain the traditional barbecue fare that you would expect from it, but there are many inventive tantalizing ones as well (like Sweet Potato-Crusted Mahi-Mahi with Roasted Red Pepper Sauce or Seared Tuna with Wasabi Green Onion BBQ Sauce). And the everyday barbecue recipes? Well, even I can't get enough of them, and that's saying a lot for someone whose dream dinner consists of crab towers and creme brulee. And as if that's not enough, the cookbook is just a really good read. The author's biker, blues-loving wit keeps you entertained as you cook. And even I can appreciate that. :-)

OMG first off, I've never written a review so here goes. I've lived in Harlem for 6 years and I've never been to this place. Last night I decided to order by phone. They told me it would be ready in 20 minutes so I went to pick it up. I ordered the wings meal which comes with 2 sides of your choice and corn bread, I also ordered the deviled eggs and cobbler. Ok let me say this, I have left overs because I couldn't eat it all. Everything was so delicious. The deviled eggs wow so amazing, the wings seasoned to perfection (love the wango tango sauce). The cobbler is so good I want to slap my own mother. I will definitely order again. I may even go and sit next time.

The brisket, pulled pork, and ribs were rather bland. ?I had to use half a bottle of Dinosaur BBQ sauce to get through my meal (1/2 + 1/2 + 1/2) The ribs had a very nice crisp sear; the brisket a nice fatty texture, but both are seriously lacking in flavor. ?The 3 stars are for the ambience (lovely music, chill servers, chill customers), and DELICIOUS appetizers and sides (wings, deviled eggs, fried green tomatoes, salt potatoes, and mac'n'cheese) ?I regret not ordering a meal that consisted only of appetizers and sides.

Reservations definitely recommended for this popular BBQ joint. ?I haven't really tried many BBQ joints in the city but why do I when there is Dinosaur BBQ. ?I think they have by far the best BBQ chicken wings that I have ever tasted. ?The flavor is there and most importantly, it is plump and juicy! Yes, juicy...and the ribs are what I'd call "finger lickin' good." ?They also have many choices of beer on tap and what's a good rib without good beer. ?Some good sides include the fries, corn and mashed potatoes. ?I have never been a big fan of the veggie side dish options as they're generally over cooked with butter and too mushy for my taste. ?In addition, the beef brisket is also a no no as it's been typically dry when I've had it, so it's been one item that I never order. ?On Saturday nights around 10pm, they have a band play in-house so try and make reservations a couple weeks in advance, esp if you have a large group or else you're in for a good 1.50 to 2hr wait!

I was dying to try this place after reading the reviews and seeing the pictures. ?I went one Tuesday night at around 10 pm - waiting a few minutes and sat down with my friend. ?I honestly do not get what is so amazing about this place. But, then again, I am not from out of town or a recent college student/grad. ?The meat is greasy and tough on the pork ribs and ALL of it was cold. ?The service was not good at all - but that didn't really bother me - the congealing (cold) macaroni and cheese did. So, I figured it was a fluke - so I was in Rochester recently (don't ask) and I tried that one. Once, again - if you're a fan of cold meat - this is your place. ?The waitress insisted that the meat on the wings "falls off the bone". No, no it doesn't. At both locations it seemed undercooked and was chewy. ?Never, never again. I really wanted to like it. I can't. Oh, and fried green tomatoes - whatever.

their ribs at this location kind of sucks because they are the pork ribs. the meat on the ribs are border line. i went to the one in syracuse and it was the best i've ever had. i've tried their other entrees as well and they are ok, nothing to report, not bad, but not great. would definitely come here since its a great atmosphere for friends and occasions - like a get together. expect long waits unless you make reservations!!! make them you wont be sorry. dont go without them. i come back here every few months.

The last time I went to Dinosaur, my party of 4 ordered so much food that the server had to push another table against ours to hold all our delicious BBQ. ?Dinosaur is not the best BBQ I've ever had in my life, but hands down the best I've had in NYC. ?I'm a fan of the pulled pork, while everyone else seems to love the ribs. ?They also have a great selection of beers on tap. ?If we have a group of at least 3 people, we usually order the Family package thing, which is an enormous sampling of BBQ, sides, and a WHOLE CHICKEN. ?It is a crazy amount of food for the price and we stuff our faces and then fight over divvying up the leftovers. ?I highly recommend it.

Went to Dinosaur last Saturday night...the ribs and most everything else was very good. We had a reservation, which was honored with no delay....but to walk in, would be a 1-2 hour wait. The only downside is the wait we endured for a glass of pinot noir that arrived 1/2 hour after ordering it with no apology from our waitress. Again, very good food and solid value so far as barbeque joints go.

This place gets pretty f'in crowded! The food i pretty good tho, the mac and cheese and the bbq chicken is soooo good! Love the wings too, just wish it wasnt all skin. If you ever have a few minutes to spare order a couple drinks at the bar, the caipirnha is so good and 3 got me fucked up. But the other drinks are just as good. Expect is to be crowded cause it pretty much always is and there's a lot of noise so if you're looking for a quiet low key place don't go here.

Glad I made the trek up here for some awesome BBQ!! ?We decided to drive up, as the ride from Hoboken would take awhile, and we were hungry! The drive was painless and we found parking right outside of Dinosaur. ?The vibe inside was chill, the place was PACKED and they had a ton of beers on draft for cheap-$5. ?Well, cheap for NYC :) ?We had to wait for about 45 minutes for a table, but the wait was well worth it. ?If you plan ahead, you can also make a reservation and avoid the wait. ?However, with a great beer and nice weather the minutes just fly by while you wait. ?I started with wings. ?These were to die for! Big and juicy wings with lots of BBQ sauce. ?These are a must try! ?Since I'm not a meat eater I had the BBQ 1/2 chicken. ?The sides were decent, the cornbread a little dry, but the chicken..... another story... yum! ?My b/f had brisket and pulled pork and said it was equally amazing. ?we'd been looking for a go-to BBQ place in the city, and think we just found it. ?Thank you Dinosaur.. keep doin what you're doin!

This place has been hyped beyond measure by everyone, so naturally, I had to give it a try since I'm a massive BBQ fan. Dinosaur BBQ lived up to the hype and then some. It was one of the most enjoyable meals I've had in a really long time. I've never been to the "old" Dinosaur BBQ, but the new place is SO nice and the decor is really imaginative and puts you in a completely whimsical mindset. I went on a Friday night -- you DEFINITELY want reservations if you don't care to wait for 2+ hours. The place was packed, but we were seated promptly. Service is quick. The food is delicious. We ordered 13 Wango Tango wings to start -- everyone said these wings were meaty. That's an understatement. We ended up taking half of them home. The best thing about these wings is that despite their massive size, the flavor cooked entirely through them. They were so moist and yummy. Wango Tango is a BBQ flavor, by the way. For those people looking for like a buffalo taste, this is not it. But it was delicious. For the main course, I ordered the Tres Ninos (and my date had the Tres Hombres, just a larger portion of the same). I could not get enough of the BBQ pork. It was so flavorful and tender and just perfect. It was my absolute favorite of the three. The brisket was just as tender and awesome. For people looking for the tender, meaty, Texas Roadhouse-type ribs, these ribs are not it... but they are still AMAZING. These are more like Memphis-style... very flavorful and smoky. Definitely can't say enough good stuff about this place -- bring your date, bring your family, bring everyone. It's such a warm and inviting place :) Just make a reservation...

Crazy delicious! ?Man-oh-man, this place is excellent. ?The food is great - really nice smoked pork. ?I love the pork porto sandwich which is a portobello mushroom and pulled pork with BBQ sauce on a roll. ?Yummy. ?The meats are nicely smoked and so flavorful that you really don't need the BBQ sauce but it is right there on the table if you want it. ?The BBQ wings are awesome - we had them on a snowy night in January and if you closed your eyes, you would think you were in your backyard in your flip-flops eating tasty wings right off the grill. ?Very good side dishes too - the salt potatoes are wonderful with a tasty sauce (not just salt which is what the name would lead you to believe). ?My fav is the fried rice with smoked pork - wow! ?Everything is delicious. ?The restaurant is very comfortable and the staff is very nice. ?Service is quick, drinks are good. ?Price is fair - sandwich entrees that comes with 2 sides was something like $12. ?Some nights we've been there they have live bands and they have been good. ?Always busy - eves and weekends there is a long wait but it is SO worth it.

Maybe it is just because I opted for take out instead of waiting for 45 mins for a table, but I don't see what all of the fuss is about. ?The chicken was dry, the brisket tasteless. The ribs were the only good thing about the meal- that and the beans which came in a dixie-cup sized container. ?I'm on the fence about going back- but if I do I'll eat there to give it a fair shake.

I have been here three times with friends from the neighborhood and after every meal I wonder what all the fuss is about. Each dining experience here has been different but none worth raving about and definitely not outstanding enough to make me say wow. The much vaunted sides and appetizers everyone raves about are really nothing special and kind of ordinary. The chicken wings we had the other day were oversauced but the bigger sin is that they were served to us rare. I prefer my chicken well done, thank you very much. ?Not eating that-what else ya got? Fried green tomatoes? ?I have had better and the cheese sprinkle on top is not necessary. ?But my favorite head scratcher last week was discovering that the vegetable of the day was....orzo pasta. Excuse me but why is that the veggie? Oh, ?you have some asparagus tips in the dish too. Well. At least they bothered to add a vegetable to a starch. Thanks Dinosaur. I laughed at the sheer insanity of this along with the waitress. ? The ribs I ordered were nothing special and the pulled pork one of my companions got was served to her as a hacked pork sandwich-big pieces of pork on a bun instead of the shredded kind that most ?bbq restaurants seem to prefer when they advertise something called pulled pork. ?She smartly took the meat and pulled it herself in order to avoid the Heimlich maneuver that was looming if she attempted to eat that sandwich. While I love connecting with my food in the most intimate ways I don't expect to be so interactive at the table to make the dish resemble what I ordered. And one helpful tip to your diners-maybe identify what you are simmering those vegetables in. Collard greens shouldn't be crunchy. Just saying. I get it-the place is huge, rowdy and loud; they serve a lot of people and have a healthy take out business. Other places do it better in my opinion. Never had a problem with service here-it is attentive enough for the size of this place and I always have received my order in a timely manner (too timely for the wings of course). Food is better elsewhere is all-Daisy Mae's blows them out of the water in my opinion. Hell, so do Virgils and RUB. This place though-can't recommend.

Wow! I was so excited to find out that there really is good BBQ in NYC. This place was fantastic. I loved the atmosphere - lots of space, a bit loud, a bit dirty, sports on tv - exactly what a barbecue place should be! We had the ribs and the fried green tomatoes - both were awesome. Definitely real-deal BBQ. I would recommend reservations -it was packed until pretty late in the evening. I would give it 5 stars but it is bbq and I can't justify rating bbq the same way I just rated gramercy tavern... ?;)

Raise your hand if you've had better BBQ? Me! Me! Me! This place left me really really annoyed. After waiting for about an hour and a half to be seated I was expecting this awesome mouth water food to satisfy my BBQ desire! Boy ohh boy was I soo wrong. The brisket was perfectly cooked but very bland. It wasn't seasoned at all! The ribs weren't even cooked all that well, and they too were poorly seasoned and not even hot. the mac and cheese was nothing to get too excited about. The beans were old! Baked beans should be a nice maroonish brown and of good consistency. Our beans were dark brown and the consistency of a paste. The potato salad had barely any mayonnaise and the sweet potatoes were old too. We went there on ?a Saturday night there is was no reason for us not to be served fresh food. ?I think I spent more time waiting than eating. Then it took me even longer to get the attention of the waitress to get the check. Ditch this place!

Hit this spot with my parents and wifey. We ordered wings and deviled eggs to start. I had the chicken steak joint, while my girl had pulled pork and a chicken sandwich while my moms had ribs. Dad just picked from our plates and ate the wings. The wings were weird, half were cold, like only the sauce was heated. We got the spiciest variety, they were tasty, the hot ones at least. The eggs were ok and my girl didn't like her sandwich. She sent it back and got shrimp. I don't eat pork so I didn't sample that or the ribs, which my mom said were good. Another just a step above run of the mill joint that city slicker types rave about which I just find a little over decent. Wings and my chicken plate were the highlights for me. The shrimp were good too. Service was really good as well. I'm a Harlemite born and raised, the whole area by the West Side Highway has been revamped. 3 stars because multiple dishes disappointed.

I went to Dinosaur BBQ tonight with a couple of riends and we thought the ambiance and decor was pretty cool. ?Beer list was ok! ?As far as the food was concerned we had the Swag for 2....shrimp was acceptable fried tomatoes were good and wings were really good! ?Then moved on to the tres hombre: the sides were bland and dry! (mac n cheese, cornbread). ?Tried a couple of ribs from the 3/4 rack was ok but the habanero sauce really gave them a nice spicy boost. ?The thing that turned me really off were the desserts (definetly not home made!). ?I understand that you dont go to a BBQ for desserts but give me something better than TGIF.........Service was very smooth and she was very nice and talkative but we really felt like we were getting rushed at about 11:15 and we thought with them closing at midnight that that was pretty inconsiderate for my table and the other ten in the restaurant....I mean lights went from dim to rise and shine! ?Probably would try another BBQ before I go back to Dinosaur BBQ. ?All in all, an ok experience!

I have been here several times because it's a convenient place for my co-workers and I to get some decent food and a drink after a long work week. ?The ribs, chicken and pulled pork are finger licking good. The sides were missing the M'm M'm good altogether, but most recently, baby puleze the chef must have kick it up a few notches, the mac & cheese and the potatoes where very good. ?The fried green tomatoes and the deviled eggs are eatable but not memorable. ? ? ? ?Now let talk about the drinks....mug of donkey punch, it has the kick in the ass the place is missing. ?Another good thing about Dinosaur is if you're into dining with celebrities, your chances are good here. ?I've dined with several - to bad we were not at the same table. ?Last but not least, parking is on the street and very limited. ?If you dare to park in Fairway parking lot, your dinner tab may also include towing fees or the yellow boot.

i came here with my brother our first night in new york. ?heard lots of good things about it and decided we needed to check it out. first of all...it was in a nice location, close to the hudson river. ?it was a beautiful night, nice and breezy. ?to top it off..it turned out to be biker's night...i fell in love with it already...nothing sexier than a black man in leather and a crotch rocket...sigh..okay, back to the restaurant....lol we had to wait about an hour, it was pretty busy. ?no worries though cuz we ended up walking around the area and even found a cool azz market...fairway market (will mos def write a review about that place too)...as soon as we had walked back, our table was ready:-) sat down and i looked at what other people around me were eating. ?it looked hella good. ?got our drinks, ordered an arnold palmer with sweet tea..dang, it was hella good. ?jonathon, our server, happened to be cutie pie was hella nice. ?asked him about the menu and he told us about the salt potatoes, the bbq fried rice, and the combo meals...my brother and i decided to try different combos so we can taste a bit of everything. bbq fried rice was hella good...only wish they had given us more...didnt they know there were asians sitting at this table? lol...we eat rice with everything! ?the pulled por,k was hella good as well as the brisket...really did like that bbq fried rice, nothing like i expected it to be. ?collard greens were tasty, mac n cheese was nice n cheesy...salt potatoes in cajun butter...hella good:-) we had a good meal and a fabulous waiter (thanks jonathon!) ?we were going to try another place for dessert and drinks...but we ended up stayin there cuz they had a cool ass band performing...bocci...which turns out had two of the band members as servers there. ?they freakin rocked the house and did some shiet i would never have thought they would do...absolutely awesome...plus we got a couple of free shots (from some cute waitresses per my bro) and i had lots of eye candy with all the bikers;-) i would totally reccommend this place and would definitely go back...trust me on that one!

if you're in the mood for some solid bbq in a great environment, head over to dinosaur. ?i've been here a couple of times and even though the ribs haven't lived up to my first trip there, they are still a solid choice. ?all the sides i've had have been really good, like the mac & cheese, bbq beans, and potato salad. ?i finally got to try the brisket this last time around and like everything else it was delicious.

I love this place! Nice, laid back atmosphere and very friendly staff. I've only had 2 lunches here, but was very pleased with both. Once I had a chicken dish which was like a pot pie and it was delicious. The second time I had another delicious barbecued chicken dish. I had mac and cheese with it (which I didn't really like, but that was the only think I didn't like) and the mashed yams with nuts on top, which was delicious and not too sweet. I definitely plan on going back.

Well...where should I start. We wanted to try this new restaurant "Dinosaur BBQ" who has a new location in Troy (377 Riverside). They don't take reservations so we got there really early knowing we would have to wait a bit. 3 hours later after numerous, "It will just be a little longer" by an unexperienced manager, we were finally seated. The food was OK...but sertainly not worth the wait. "Poor Form" Dinosaur BBQ. We won't be back...

Look, I am from the South... I know from BBQ... this is as good as you are going to get in NYC. ?The BBQ is good, but the sides and apps are better. ?The greens are heaven, and the deviled eggs are so good they will make you want to slap your mama. ?j/k... kinda... sorry mom. ?For real, the eggs RULE!

I can't say enough about Dinosaur's. ?It is perhaps my favorite restaurant in the city. ?I always get beef brisket and pulled pork. ?The mac 'n cheese is the best I've ever had. ?Just writing this makes me want to head there now. ?The service has always been great, except that one time... I try to forget it. ?But I swear if I go back and see that waitress I would wait for an hour before sitting in her section. ?Everyone else is great.

The restaurant itself was pretty neat, under the tracks. I ordered the Chili on the Half Shell, which is basically a chili cheese dip served with tortilla chips. ?It was okay, thought the dip had not much flavor, had a good amount of beans, but the cheese itself wasn't all that great. ?I used some of their featured hot sauces, but that didn't do much. ?I ordered the Sampler Extreme to share, which comes with 1/2 Chicken, 1/2 Rack of Ribs, and sliced Texas Beef Brisket. ?I didn't find the ribs all that great - very thin, not much meat, fatty, and not much rub seasoning on it. ?Wasn't that juicy or it did not fall off the bone. ?The chicken was okay - I just preferred eating the skin off. ?The brisket was just okay - large slices, juicy, but needed more sauce. ?The 4 different types of bbq sauces on the table weren't even bbq sauces, in my opinion. ?It had weird habanero peppers and god knows what else, and it just was not working. ?Their original bbq sauce was this weird sweet tang - the flavor was just way off, and I preferred not putting extra sauce on mine. ?I'm a sauce person, so I was extremely disappointed that their sauces were not at all up to par. ?I did, however, enjoy their macaroni & cheese, which was stringy, cheesy, and had this great flavor. ?I'd rather go to Rack & Soul off of Cathedral Parkway. Hmph.

love that this place is in harlem. i think it should be an "all nighter" spot as there are 2 big clubs down the street and it is a tease to drive by this place at 4am with closed doors. great food. love to go here with friends. the korean bbq ribs are slamming. the brisket is great too!

New Yorkers know NOTHING about bar-b-que. You should all be ashamed of yourselves for acting like you do. ?So I ordered the brisket and chicken dinner. I thought they forgot the brisket and had to look around the plate and ah, I thought I saw something. Well, I cant tell you what it tasted like because there was only one bite available. Yes, literally. There were 4 small strips of PURE FAT. Yes I looked at each piece of blubber. So thanks for the fat but in the rest of the country brisket is meat, beef. If you eat pieces of pure blubber you will look like pure blubber plus that is so disgusting. ?The chicken was very average. It was undercooked and too pink but the sauce was good but I dont think this was cooked on a bar-b-que. It really didnt taste like it at all. You guys do know that bar-b-que requires a grill of sorts right? Not the grill you cook eggs on. The potato salad was below average. It tasted like something out of the cool section at the grocery store, not one iota better. The coleslaw was a little tangy so that at least tasted good. The cornbread was good, nothing special but not bad, good actually. Do not order the fried green tomatos. disgusting! How cheap can a place be? They used slices of tomato that were thinner than the jalepenos then battered them in some gross stuff and deep fried them! That is not how you make fried green tomatoes. They were terrible, I ate 1 and not the other 2, in total , if the pieces were put together, it wouldnt not make even half of a small tomato, MAYBE 1/4. A disappointing meal to say the least. I am convinced that people from NYC are so deprived of good food that they think anything tastes good. Now if people are wealthy they can try great 5 star restaraunts and get good food but this other stuff like Dinosaur? Please, what an awful meal. I cant believe I paid $24.00 for blubber, a bit of coleslaw and a small piece of cornbread. ?The one star is because the delivery man was very nice. The restaraunt gets zero stars!

collard greens, fried green tomatoes, braised catfish, & bbq chicken wings are the best here! ribs and mac are good too.

i used to love this place that now moved to bigger digs close by. ?but tonight our takeout order of chicken, wings, brisket and some sides was less than impressive. ?brisket was greasy. ?wings were over sauced. ?mac n' cheese was ok but not great. ?don't get me wrong, i'm sure to go back to try again. ?but blue smoke was pretty good 2 weeks ago, and so was hill country.
